THE MUSCULAR SYSTEM. 260 anterior jugular vein; it lies on the sterno-thyroid, crico, and thyro-hyoid muscles. Action—To depress the os hyoides, and assist in the elevation of the sternum in forced respiration; its nervous supply is similar to the omo-hyoid; as these muscles converge above they are, consequently, nearer to each other than the sterno-thyroid; above or opposite the crico-thyroid space they, therefore, bound laterally the position for the operation of laryngotomy. Sterno-thyeoid.—Situated below the last, which should be divided to expose it; flat and broad, it arises fleshy and with short tendinous fibres intermixed, from the posterior surface of the first bone of the sternum, lower down than the sterno-hyoid; also from the cartilage of the second rib; it passes obliquely upwards and inwards, and is inserted into an oblique ridge on the ala of the thyroid cartilage, where it appears to give ofi" the thyro- hyoid muscle. Relations.—It lies on a deep layer of fascia, which separates it from the remains of the thymus gland and left vena innominata in the thorax; above this it lies on the trachea; on the right side the arteria innominata, right carotid, and subclavian arteries, the internal jugular and subclavian veins; on the left side, the left subcla- vian and carotid, with veins similar to those on the right; it now lies over the vertebral and inferior thy- roid arteries, lateral lobe of the thyroid body, cricoid cartilage, insertion of crico-thyroid muscle, thyroid car- tilage, and thyroid branch of the artery of that name; it is covered by the sterno-hyoid and mastoid muscles, branches of the omo-hyoid plexus intervening; this mus- cle is wider than the sterno-hyoid, on the inner side of which its margin projects, so as to overlap the trachea; it is, therefore, between these that the operation of tra- cheotomy is performed; the width of the muscle is always dependent on the size of the thyroid body; we lately saw a case where its breadth was two inches; sometimes a waving tendinous line occurs, a little be- low the centre, producing a digastric disposition. Thyro-hyoid Seems to be a continuation of the last; arises, by an oblique margin, from the ridge on the side of the thyroid cartilage; passes obliquely upwards and

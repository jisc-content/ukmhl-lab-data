863 BRANCHES OF POPLITEAL, found double, and it may divide into its terminal branches, either on or above the poplitseus. Collateral Branches—Superior external, superior internal, inferior external, inferior internal, azygos, articular, and sural. Superior External Articular.—Rather large, aris- ing from the outer side of the poplitseal, opposite the ' external condyle; passes outwards, and slightly up- wards, resting on the bone beneath the poplitteal vein and nerve, tendon of the biceps, and peroneal nerve; be- neath the vastus externus it divides into two branches, a superficial, which, piercing that muscle, runs to the , superior external angle of the patella to anastomose with the descending branches of the external circum- flex of the profunda, and the adjacent articular; and a ' deep, which, forming an arch above the condyles with : a similar branch from the internal, supplies the syno- vial membrane. Superior Internal Articular arises opposite the last from the inner side of the popliteal; it runs up- wards and inwards, likewise, on the bone, beneath the tendons of the semitendinosus, semimembranosus, graci- lis, sartorius, and adductor magnus, and on arriving beneath the vastus internus divides into two branches, a superficial, which runs to the upper and inner side of the patella, to anastomose with the anastomotica magna and adjoining articular; and a deep, which proceeds to supply the joint. Inferior External Articular arises exactly op- posite the articulation; it winds outwards over the ■ tendon of the poplitasus and external semilunar carti- lage, and beneath the external head of the gastrocne- mius, plantaris, biceps, external lateral ligament, and peroneal nerve, and, reaching the front of the joint, di- vides into two branches,—a superficial, which runs to the front of the patella to anastomose with the anterior tibial recurrent, and its fellow of the opposite side; and : a deep, to supply the interior of the joint. Inferior Internal Articular.—This arises a little I lower than the last, and passes downwards and inwards : along the upper margin of the poplitoeus, resting on the back part of the tibia, and under the internal head of I

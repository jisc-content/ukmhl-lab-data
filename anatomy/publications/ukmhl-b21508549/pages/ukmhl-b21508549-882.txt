ARTERIES AND VEINS. 872 left vein, whilst the right terminates in the confluence of the two branches, where they form the cava; the left phrenic, pericardiac, and mediastinal veins have a simi- lar termination, whilst the right open into the cava. The vertebral vein commences at the transverse process of the atlas by a branch of communication with the oc- cipital, frequently receiving a small vein, which emerges from the posterior condyloid foramen, producing a communication with the lateral sinus, then descending in the succession of foramina in the transverse processes of the cervical vertebras, until it reaches the sixth, where it may divide into two,—one passing m front ot the subclavian artery, and the second behind that vessel, to terminate in the brachio-cephalic veins of their cor- responding sides; but although we have given these vessels as opening in the ven^ innommatiE, still we do not believe that such a termination is the rule, but ra- ther the exception, as we have almost invariably seen them open into the subclavian. There are many pomts ot difference between the right and left venae innominate: thus the latter is the longer, more oblique, and larger, and it should be borne in mind that in infancy it is close to the superior edge of the sternum, which should in- duce a great amount of caution when prolongmg the incision for tracheotomy downwards. The Jugular Veins are four in number on each side,— namely, the external, internal, anterior, and posterior. EXTERNAL Jugular is formed in the lower lobe ot the parotid gland by the superficial temporal veins, which, uniting with the transverse facial, constitute the temporo-facial, and this again being joined by the in- ternal maxillary, the vessel receives the name of tem- poro-maxillary; and lastly, by the posterior auricular But sometimes the external jugular commences by an arched branch, which connects it with the internal iugular, and, receiving the veins before mentioned, and Vin<r at first beneath the fascia, then becoming super- /cial to it, and crossing the surface of the sterno-ma^^^ toid, covered only by the platysma, it passes down^ids, backwards, andout'vards, as far as the PO^^erior infenor triangle of the neck, and terminates by piercing t e fascia and opening into the subclavian vein.

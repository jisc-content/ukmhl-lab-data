342 THE MUSCULAR SYSTEM. inflammation in this situation constitutes one of the most dangerous forms of paronychia, as the matter cannot reach the surface in consequence of the dense covering; it consequently becomes diflPused into the palmar region, and may travel up the fore-arm. Posterior Annular Ligament.—Much weaker than the anterior; depth about half to three-quarters of an inch; arises from the styloid process of the radius, passes downwards and inwards, and is inserted into the pisi- form bone and the fascia covering the styloid process; in its passage across, it adheres to the bony ridges which separate the grooves on the back of the radius; above it is continuous with the fascia of the fore-arm, of which it is a part, merely strengthened by transverse fibres; below with the fascia of the dorsum of the hand; this latter is prolonged over the back of the hand and fingers, is weak, and connected to the subjacent tendons by a fine but lax areolar tissue, that permits with facility the gliding of those tendons on the adjacent smfaces. The muscles to be examined in this region consist of those of the fore-arm and hand; the former are divided into pronators and flexors, occupying the front, and su- pinators and extensors, found on the posterior part. As the origins of these are complex and diflScult, it may here be remarked that the majority of the pronators and flexors are attached to the internal condyle, and the su- pinators and extensors to the external condyle of the humerus. Dissect up the fascia from below, which facilitates its removal for some distance, but superiorly it adheres so intimately to the fleshy fibres beneath, that some diffi- culty will be experienced, and much care required in the dissection, particularly in separating the muscles from each other; this should also be done from below upwards, as it is much easier to separate the tendons than the fleshy bellies. The muscles on the front of the fore-arm are placed in three layers from superficial to deep; those m the first layer are four in number,—pronator radu teres, flexor carpi radialis, palmaris longus, and flexor carpi uloaris; one in the second,—flexor digitorum sublimis; three in the third,—flexor pollicis longus, flexor digito- rum profundus, and pronator quadratus. 11

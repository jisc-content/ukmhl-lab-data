MUSCLES OF THE LEG. 475 anterior surface of the muscle, which then runs down- wards, forwards, and inwards, passing xmder the annu- lar ligament in a separate but incomplete groove, runs over the astragalus, navicular, internal cuneiform, me- tatarsal, and phalangeal bones, and expanding, is inserted into the last or ungual phalanx of the great toe. Relations.—Internally, tibialis anticus and tibial ar- tery ; externally, extensor communis, and at the annu- lar ligament the tibial artery, which crosses beneath the tendon to its outer side; the groove in the annular liga- ment is only complete anteriorly, not posteriorly; this muscle is usually concealed by those which lie on each side, and its sheath is very imperfect. Action.—To extend the great toe, and flex the ankle- joint. Extensor Digitorum Communis.—Also a semipenni- form muscle, arises fleshy from the outer side of the head of the tibia, from the two superior thirds of the inner edge of the fibula; also from the interosseous ligament; the superior fibres pass vertically, the middle and infe- rior downwards and forwards, to be attached to a ten- don which commences on the anterior surface of the inferior third of the muscle; this tendon is divided into two portions,—an internal and external, which, remain- ing in contact, pass through a groove in the annular li- gament, then wind forwards and outwards on the dor- sum of the foot, the internal dividing into two slips, the external also into two; these, diverging, continue their course over the tarsus and metatarsus, then along the phalanges on the outer edge of the short extensor; at the first phalanx they receive the insertions of the lumbricales and interossei, and at the first interpha- langeal articulation each divides into three slips, one of which is inserted into the edge of the second phalanx, the lateral, passing forwards and again uniting, are in- serted into the posterior margin of the last phalanx. Peronjeus Tertius, or Anticus, arises from the an- terior surface of the inferior third of the fibvila, is in- separably blended with the long extensor, forms a ten- don which passes through the annular ligament, in the same groove with that muscle, and on the dorsum of the foot this tendon runs outwards and forwards, and is in-

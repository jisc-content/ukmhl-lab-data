350 THE MUSCULAR SYSTEM. Action.—It will extend the fore-arm on the arm, and the wrist on the fore-arm; it also abducts the wrist. Extensor Carpi Radialts Brevior lies beneath the last. It arises tendinous from the external condyle, from a tendon common to it and the last-described mus- cle; it forms a fleshy mass, projecting on each side of the long extensor; at the junction of the upper and mid- dle thirds of the fore-arm, it forms a long flat tendon, which descends, first along the outer side, and then on the posterior part of the radius; passes through a groove common to it and the long extensor, where it is bound down by the posterior annular ligament, and is provided with a bursal membrane; becoming more expanded, the tendon is inserted into the head of the metacarpal bone of the middle finger. Relations.—It is covered by the extensor carpi radialis longior, and the tendons of the extensors of the thumb; it lies on the supinator brevis, on the pronator teres, ra- dius, carpus, and metacarpal bone. Action.—To extend the carpus, also to abduct the hand. Extensor Digitorum Communis lies internal to the last. It arises by a triangular tendon, common to it and the former muscle, from the external condyle, from the fascia which covers it, and the intermuscular septa; forms a thick fleshy belly, somewhat flattened, ending a little below the middle of the fore-arm in four slips; these terminate in a corresponding number of tendons, those for the middle and ring fingers being the larger; the compound tendon then passes through a groove on the back of the radius, provided with a bursa projecting above and below the annular ligament; they now sepa- rate for the four inner fingers; at the head of the meta- carpal bone they are round, and communicate—that for the little finger with that for the ring, and the latter ■ with the middle, the index tendon remaining distinct; on the first phalanx they are wide, and receive the inser- tion of the lumbricales; at the second they divide into three slips, the central one of which is inserted into the anterior extremity of the second phalanx; the lateral run along its sides, and unite on the last, into which they are inserted.

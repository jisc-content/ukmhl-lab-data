373 MUSCLES OF THE ABDOMEN. lies in front of the pyramidalis and rectus; and at the linea innominata, Poupart's a!nd Gimbernaut's ligament are in front of them. It is usually considered that the tendon extends only so far out as the base of Gimber- naut's ligament, but such is not the case, the external margin being prolonged outwards over the deficient abdominal wall, strengthening the fascia transversalis in this situation. If the rectus muscle is raised, the point where the aponeurosis ceases to form a posterior sheath for it is marked by a semilunar tendinous edge, but this is not well defined, as Mr. Harrison remarks, as it invariably sends down a prolongation on the peritoneum and fascia transversalis, and occasionally a second lu- nated margin occurs two inches below the first, but more faintly marked, indicating that the aponeurosis merely becomes weaker on the posterior surface of the muscle, but is not absolutely deficient at any point. Now raise ^he muscle in a manner similar to the former, and the transversalis abdominis, rectus and pyramidalis, are seen, which, with the cord and tranversalis fascia, form the deep relations of this muscle; but if it is a male let the cremaster be first dissected, and in order to see this the integument must be removed from the scrotum, also the superficial coverings of the cord in that region. Cremaster—It arises from the lower margin of the mternal oblique muscle, also from the outer half and upper edge of Poupart's ligament; the fibres descend in loops, with the concavities directed upwards, on the anterior and external part of the cord; at the tunica vaginalis it expands between the internal and external spoutlike fascias to form the tunica communis; it then ascends on the posterior surface of the cord and epidi- dymis, adhering to the latter, and is ultimately inserted into Poupart's ligament where it covers the spine of the pubis. Relative Desceiption.—This muscle surrounds the testicle, but its anatomy is extremely variable. The looped arrangement, attributed by Cloquet to the im- pulsion of the fibres of the internal oblique into the scrotum by the descending testicle, is rarely visible • and even when such is the case it merely forms a por- tion of the cremasteric apparatus.

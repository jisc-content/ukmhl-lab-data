CEREBRAL NERVES. Q>J^ being,_deep temporal, buccal, masseteric, and ptery- goid; and the latter the inferior dental, gustatory and the temporo-auricular. ' Deep Temporal consists of two branches,_an an- terior and posterior, which, arising from the outer side ot the inferior maxillary, pass between the external pterygoid and the crest on the great wing of the sphe noid bone, and, communicating with branches from the buccal and masseteric nerves, ascend, one on the anterior and the other on the posterior part of the temporal fossa beneath the muscle of that name, in which they termi- nate, a branch being sent through the muscle and fascia to communicate with the temporo-auricular in the in tegument, whilst filaments are also detached deeply to ind^a^yZ^^ ~y Buccal BRANCH.—This sometimes arises sin-le or by two or three roots, from the outer side of the inferior maxillary, and these, piercing the external pterygoid unite into a single trunk, that passes forwards be-tween the temporal tendon and the external pterygoid, giving ofF twigs to those muscles, and, having a^Sved It thf posterior margin of the buccinator, divides into three sets of branches, which, diverging, supply the skin com municating with the portio dura, the greater number however, piercmgthe muscle, and being ultimately lost m the mucous membrane. Masseteric Branch.—Smaller than the last but .bavmg a similar origin; it passes outwards, p ercW : the superior attachment of the external pterygoid her! • giving off a twig to the periosteum of thf temporal .fossa, and then escapes through the sigmoid noteh of tthe lower jaw in front of the articulation, to which it .sends a filament, and behind the coronoid process Id •.the insertion of temporal, then divides intVbranres ^which descend in the deep fibres of the masseter as low ms the angle of the jaw. '^'^^ Pterygoid Branches usually consist of three or four -short filaments, and one long branch; two of the formed enter the external pterygoid, whilst one enters l^^e t eternal; but the latter, much larger and lonrrpr 1^^ aanseu from the inferior maxillLy Tn fe^"! 2 G

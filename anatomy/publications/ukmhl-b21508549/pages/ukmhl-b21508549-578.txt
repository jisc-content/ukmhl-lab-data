CAVITY OP THE ABDOMEN. 568 of the liver. Transverse sections of the organ made from above downwards will clearly demonstrate the gradual increase in capacity in those vessels, as their cut sur- faces continue patulous, and have no tendency to col- lapse. Hepatic Ducts.â€”According to Mr. Kiernan, these commence from a complicated biliary plexus in the cen- tre of the lobule, and that they pass out to the surface, on which they again ramify before they enter the in- terlobular fissures, to anastomose with each other at the interlobular spaces, until, by repeated junctions, they at length terminate in forming the right and left hepa- tic ducts, which emerge from the portal canals at either extremity of the transverse fissure. The researches of succeeding observers have, however, rendered the exist- ence of this biliary plexus questionable, and it is now more generally supposed that they do not perforate the lobule at all, but terminate in blunted and csecal expansions in the interlobular spaces, presenting at this point an irre- gular tuberculated appearance from the pressure of the cells, of which the lobule is principallycomposed, on their walls. Those cells, the active agents in the elimination of the biliary secretion, are sometimes nucleated and some- times the reverse, and are arranged with a certain degree of regularity in a species of linear direction around the intralobiilar vein and its formative branches, which occu- py the centre of the lobule. It is at this point the elimi- nation of the fluid is conceived to commence, and to be thence propagated from cell to cell, which sometimes are found to communicate for its more ready transit, until it reaches the surface, where it is poured into the inter- lobular spaces by the bursting of the cell, to be absorbed by the ctecal extremities of the biliary tubes, which pur- sue the course already indicated, to terminate at the right and left hepatic ducts at the extremities of the transverse fissure. After proceeding downwards for about an inch and a half, these ducts unite to form the common hepatic, which, after a course of nearly the same distance, is joined by the cystic, constitutmg the ductus communis choledochus, which passes doAvnwards, backwards, and slightly to the right side, until it reaches the posterior and internal border of the duodenum, which

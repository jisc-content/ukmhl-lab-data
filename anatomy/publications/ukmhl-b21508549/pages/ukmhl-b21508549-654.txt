KERVOUS SYSTEM. 644 enter the pons they become round, on which account a small depression results between them, bounded in front by the pons (foramen cascum), and then, entering the latter body above the transverse fibres on its superficial surface, but crossing others which are deeper, they reach the crura cerebri, passing through their anterior and external part to arrive at the thalami and striated bodies in their course to the hemispheres. They are bounded above and behind by a groove separating them from the olivary bodies, from which arises the ninth nerve, whilst from the superior part immediately behind the pons the sixth pair of nerves take their origin. Olivary Bodies—Small, oval projections on the side of the medulla, bounded behind by a depression (respiratory tract of Bell) separating them from the res- tiform bodies, from which arise the eighth pair of nerves; in front, by the groove for the origin of the ninth pair; above, by a depression in which the portio dura arises; and below, by the arciform fibres. On tracing them downwards, their fibres are seen to become continuous with the antero-lateral column of the cord; and supe- riorly, although apparently separated from the pons by a depression, still they enter that body, and, on passing through it, form the greater portion of the upper surface of the crura cerebri, entering subsequently the optic thalami and tubercula quadrigemina. If the anterior pyramids are removed, and the olivary body is subjected to the action of a stream of water, a yellowish, folded mass will be seen, which, from its resemblance to a folded leaf, is called corpus dendroideum, which can be traced inwards into the substance of the medulla as the fillet of Reil. The olivary body is, therefore, hollow internally, being compared by Rolando to an open purse, and hence he named it " borsa appiattita." Gall and Spurzheim conceived that these bodies, Avhich are peculiar to the human subject, were the ganglia of increase connected with the medulla oblongata. Eestiform Bodies.—Round and cylindrical, like a rope, from which circumstance their name is derived, and placed on the posterior and lateral part of the me- dulla; they are continued inferiorly from the posterior, and the postero-lateral columns of the cord; and then,

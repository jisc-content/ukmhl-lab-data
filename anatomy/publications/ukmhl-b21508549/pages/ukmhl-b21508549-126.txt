THE OSSEOUS SYSTEM. 116 a crown, neck, and fang, the first being free above the gum; the second surrounded by the fibro-mucous tissue; and the third imbedded in its proper alveolus. These several parts undergo modifications resulting from' age, position, use, &c., although strictly formed according to a single type. Incisors—The crown is somewhat triangular, con- stricted towards the neck, fi.at or convex from side to side on the anterior surface; deeply excavated, on the posterior to a chisel edge. The two central are the larger, and those of the upper predominate in size remarkably over those of the lower jaw; the neck is constricted and rough, with numerous small apertures for the transmission of vessels; the fang or root, conical in shape, is planted in the alveolar depression, and pre- sents at the extremity an opening for the transmission of the nutritious artery, and a branch of the dental nerve, to the pulp; a vertical section reveals a cavity within, corresponding in outline to the tooth, and oc- cupied during life by the dental pulp. Canine Laniares or Cuspidati.—The crown con- stricted superiorly into a blunted point, convex ante- riorly, and cut ofl^" from below on the posterior surface; the neck is also constricted, and surrounded by the gum; the fang, thick, strong, and much prolonged, is planted in the alveolus, whilst its gradual increase from point to neck protects the artery and nervous filament from pressure. MoLARES.—These consist of five, three posterior on each side, true molars, or multicuspidati, and two on each side anteriorly, false molars, or bicuspidati. These latter present a crown with a double tubercle su- periorly,—the external, the more elevated of the two, convex internally and externally, short from above downwards, surrounded by a constricted neck; the fang is still single, with a linear depression on both surfaces, showing a tendency to that future division which sometimes, in those of the upper jaw exists, espe- cially in the posterior pair. True molares:—the crown is square, surmounted by three or four tubercles, convex on both surfaces, generally exhibiting two linear depres- sions, running from above downwards, shaping the crown like a wool-pack; the neck is constricted and

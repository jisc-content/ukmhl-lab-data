PAROTID GLAND. 249 pliosphate and silicate of lime, soda in combination with'mucus, and a peculiar principle, sulpho-cyanogen, •which gives to the saliva the character of striking a pur- ple colour Avith a persalt of iron. Its uses are various, but not of that importance which the quantity of the secre- tion would seem to indicate. Amongst the most obvious may be enumerated,—to promote the sense of taste, to stimulate the stomach, to saturate the acidity of the superabundant gastric juice, to assist in the produc- tion and modulation of sound, and, lastly, to act che- mically on the amylaceous aliments, converting them into sugar. Parotid Gland occupies a deep recess between the posterior edge of the ramus of the jaw and the anterior margin of the mastoid process and sterno-mastoid mus- cle; its salient outline can be easily distinguished in the living subject; this space undergoes considerable variations in size, produced firstly by the position of the head; secondly, by the movements of the lower jaw; if the head is depressed so as to approximate the chin to the sternum, the ramus of that bone glides back- wards over the sterno-mastoid muscle, almost obliterat- ing the recess inferiorly, whilst its greatest degree of magnitude is attained by throwing the head backwards and advancing the chin; when the lower maxilla is de- pressed to its utmost, the angle passes backwards, covering the space inferiorly; but during this movement the upper part is increased by the gliding forwards of the condyle; in the old edentulous subject, and in the infant, the space is large, but with the subsequent de- velopment of the incisor teeth, it gradually diminishes; the skin in this region is thin and fine, loosely attached to the subjacent parts; on raising it some fibres of the platysma are seen, frequently forming a strong, flat, muscular plane, passing from the ramus of the jaw to the angle of the mouth (musculus risorius); through these fibres may also be observed the anterior branch of the auricularis magnus nerve, imbedded in the sub- stance of the fascia, which constitutes the next covering of the gland. Fascial Investment.—This is derived from the cer- vical region, and consists of a strong layer, not only M 3

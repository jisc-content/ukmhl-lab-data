THE OSSEOUS SYSTEM. 94 towards its inferior extremity, terminated in a rounded head, whicli articulated with a cuplike cavity on the upper surface of the os hyoides, at the junction of its cornu with its body. The Sphenoid, so termed from the manner in which it is wedged in at the base of the cranium, forming the bond of union between all the bones of the head, and several of the face. In figure it has been compared to a bat, with the wings expanded; and the similarity is more obvioxis when observed with the ethmoid attached to it anteriorly. In its description we will give it a body, which we wUl first examine, and afterwards the processes which are connected to it. The central thick portion of the bone is that to which the name of body has been applied; it is of a cuboid shape, and presents an upper and lower surface; an anterior and posterior extremity and two sides. The superior surface is very irregular, presenting in the mesial line anteriorly a slight elevation, which is prolonged into a triangular spine that fits into a corresponding notch in the eth- moid bone; on either side of this is a slight depression, on which the olfactory nerve rests in its course forwards and inwards to the cribiform plate, and external to this the small pedicle, the anterior root of the lesser wing. As we proceed backwards we reach a grooved portion of the bone, narrow and concave from before backwards, long and convex from side to side; this is the olivary process for supporting the optic commissure, and which is terminated at either extremity by a rounded hole, the optic, through which pass the nerve of the same name and the ophthalmic artery; behind the oli- vary process there is a deep excavation, concave from before backwards, the sella turcica; the pituitary gland rests in it, and a remarkable sinus, the circular ofEidley, as well as the transverse sphenoidal; more posteriorly there is an abrupt but narrow elevation, at the extremities of Avhich are two rounded processes: the posterior clinoid, which give attachment to the con- vex margin of the tentorium. The back part of the body is flat, but very rough, for articulation with the basilar process of the occipital. The inferior surface presents in the mesial line, stretching downwards and

THE INFERIOR MAXILLA. 113 t two superior the genio-hyoglossi of opposite sides arise, a and from the two inferior, the genio-hyoidei; on either 5 side of the two last, and a little lower down, is a slight L depression,—the digastric pit, into which the nmscle of t that name is inserted; the upper edge of the body is I perforated by four foramina for the incisor teeth, the : septa of division between each being marked by slight (depressions, more deeply on the anterior than posterior : surface; the inferior border of the body is rounded and ] prominent, one of the characteristic distinctions of the 1 human species; the sides of the lower jaw curve back- ' wards and outwards, as far as the angle where they 1 unite with the ascending ramus; the external surface iis slightly convex, and at its anterior part, and a little 1 below its centre, from above downwards, is a round 1 foramen,—the mental, which gives passage to the nerve I and artery of the same name, both branches of the dental; i an oblique line commences below this hole, and passes up- ' wards and backwards, to terminate in the external lip of 1 the coronoid process; to this is attached, anteriorly, the 1 triangularis oris muscle, whilst behindit is crossed nearly 1 at a right angle by the facial artery; the internal surface i is very irregular, and presents a ridge similar to that I on the outside, but more elevated, passing from before, upwards and backwards, to terminate in a spur-like ■ process, overhanging the dental foramen; this has been ' called the mylo-hyoid ridge, which gives attachment by its two anterior thirds to the muscle of that name, ; and by its posterior third to the superior constrictor of the pharynx; above it, but anteriorly, is a superficial ' depression for the sublingual gland, and below it, but ; posteriorly, another for the submaxillary; a slight groove is likewise found inferior and parallel to it, which lodges a small nerve, the mylo-hyoid, a branch of the inferior dental for the supply of that muscle; the upper margin of the side is studded with the depressions for the molar teeth; it is curved inwards, particularly at its posterior part, and terminates in a shallow groove, which is gradually lost on the anterior edge of the co- ronoid process, while the inferior is rounded and curved outwards; the rami join the sides of the bone at variable angles, at different periods of life; in the very young it

184 THE ANATOMY OF THE JOINTS. of the posterior portions of the internal and external lateral ligaments with the tendons posteriorly, which actively oppose it beyond a certain extent. There are a combination of several circumstances which confer on the ankle-joint a certain degree of security, and these it may be as well to recapitulate. In the first place, the tibia falling on the astragalus at a right angle, the weight of the body in the upright po- sition is transmitted in a manner admirably calculated to prevent displacement under natural conditions; secondly, the socket formed by the malleoli on either side, and the tibio-peroneal ligaments in front and be- hind, forms, with the elevation of the astragalus, a com- plete morticed joint, admitting of those motions calcu- lated to favour progression, without, however, any rotatory movement, except such as may depend, in a slight degree, on the elasticity of the fibula, which might diminish its security without adding materially to its useful functions; thirdly, we have observed that its ligamentous connexions are of a very powerful cha- racter, and these are further strengthened by the series of tendons acted on by the vital agency of their corre- sponding muscles Avhich surround the articulation, and, as sentinels, watch over and preserve the bones which compose it from displacement. CALCANEO-ASTRAGALOID ARTICULATION. This is a double arthrodia; the two bones which com- pose it coming in contact at two distinct points,â€”pos- teriorly and externally, and anteriorly and internally; the means of union between them consists of an inter- osseous, an external, and an internal ligament. Interosseous Ligament It is to be premised that for the examination of all the connecting media of the foot it will be necessary that all the soft structures should be removed, but this must be done with great care, as the tendinous origins of the numerous muscles of this region are intimately blended with the ligaments; but to form a just conception of the one at present under consideration, both the astragalus and os calcis must be sawn through from before backwards, which will enable the student to obtain a lateral view of it;

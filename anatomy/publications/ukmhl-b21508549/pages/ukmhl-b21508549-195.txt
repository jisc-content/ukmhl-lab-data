TARSAL LIGAMENTS. 185 the only manner in Avhich he can acquire a proper idea of its true character; it consists of a series of oblique and vertical fibres of great strength, mixed up with a quantity of fat, stretching between the astragalus above and the os calcis below, occupying the groove which exists between them, and amply sufficient, except under the most peculiar circumstances, to maintain the union between them; it is broader and stronger externally than internally. External and Internal Lateral Ligaments.— These consist of a series of short fibres stretching be- tween the adjacent margins of the bones on each side, but they scarcely deserve the name that has been applied to them, as they are sometimes incapable of demonstration; the sheaths, however, of the flexor tendons, posteriorly and internally, confer a vast amount of security on the articulation in this direction. Synovial Membranes.—That of the posterior arti- culation is peculiar to this alone, and is very lax in its nature; that of the anterior is smaller, and conti- nuous with the astragalo-scaphoid. Motion, exceed- ingly limited, and of a gliding character. ASTRAGALO-SCAPHOID ARTICULATION. This is an arthrodial joint, formed by the convex and oval head of the astragalus, fitting into a corresponding oval depression on the back part of the scaphoid; pro- perly speaking, it*has only a single ligament for its security, which is found superiorly composed of a strong series of fibres springing from the upper part of the neck of the astragalus, and, passing forwards, are inserted into the upper and posterior margins of the scaphoid bone; it is strong and tense in its character; a loose synovial membrane, prolonged from the calcaneo- astragaloid articulation, lines the joint. Motion.—Very extensive, as the elasticity of the foot, in a great measure, may be referred to the union be- tween those two bones. The admitted strength of this articulation must by no means be inferred to depend on the simple ligamen- tous connexion just described, as its security is refer- rible to causes much more remote; a single glance will

875 VENOUS SYSTEM. cles, behind the facial artery, and in front of the an- terior edge of the inasseter crosses obliquely the ramvis of the jaw, and is then received into a groove in the posterior edge of the submaxillary gland, then, curving downwards and backwards, divides into two branches, one of which joins the external, and the other the in- ternal, jugular vein. In its course it receives the great alveolar vein, which commences immediately behind the jugal ridge of the superior maxillary bone by the union of the Vidian, superior palatine, and spheno-palatine veins in a plexiform arrangement, and passing forwards beneath the zygomatic muscles, and being joined by the superior dental and infra-orbital, it opens into the facial, which is increased to nearly double its diameter after its reception; the facial vein also receives masseteric, nasal, coronary, and labial branches, and whilst in the neck it is joined by the glandular palatine, submental, and tonsillitic. Lingual Veins.—These consist of a dorsal plexus, situated between the mucous membrane and the mus- cular tissue of the organ, which unite to form a dorsal trunk on the base of the tongue, accompanying the lingual nerve to terminate on each side in the facial or pharyngeal veins, and likewise, of the inferior or ranine trunks, which are seen lying longitudinally on the under surface of the tongue, forming an eminence be- neath the mucous membrane, and joining the lingual venous trunks, which are two in number, and accom- pany the artery of that name, terminating either in the internal jugular or facial vein; but they often form a common trunk with the thyroid and facial as they ap- proach the jugular. Thyroid Veins.—Superior transverse commence by branches corresponding to the divisions of the supe- rior thyroid arteries, particularly receiving the efferent branches from the larynx; it passes backwards over the external and internal carotids and pneumogastric nerves, and terminates in the internal jugular vein, but often as we have seen it uniting with the lingual and facial, we have never observed its termination in either the external or anterior jugular. Inferior transverse commences in the lateral lobe of the thyroid body at

CEREBRAL NERVES. 657 also follows each branch for some distance into these canals, but again abandoning it, forms a cul de sac as- cendmg to re-enter the cranium, while the pia mater also accompanies the nervous filaments; but after a short course in these canals the dura mater becomes in- timately adherent to them, conferring on them great resistance, and rendering it difficult to break down the bone without likewise destroying the nerves. Of the branches, the external are distributed to the pituitarv membrane, on the middle and superior spongy bones the internal to the septum, and the middle to the roof (see page 130). The olfactory nerves are peculiar in the lower ver- tebrata from the olfactory bulb, being the seat of a cavity which communicates with the lateral ventricle an organization absent in man. These nerves are like- wise peculiar, m arising by three roots of different slides 01 colour, m converging within the cranium, in their prismatic form, in lying in a deep sulcus or furrow, in being above the arachnoid, and devoid of neurilemma in leaving the cranium by a number of foramina, and in not possessing the power to excite reflex action The olfactory nerves are sometimes, but rarely, absent, and wanting ^ ^^^^^^"^=7 exists the olfactive sense is also Optic Nerves, or Second Pair.-Iu order to see the origins of these nerves the cerebellum should be raised from the semilunar notch of Bichat, then follow them orwards, as they wind around the crus cerebri, remo^ Flh Z ''"'^^^^^"'^/^d pia mater from this situation. Each nerve arises by two roots, one from the nates, the other from the testes; these pass forwards, being next attached to the corpora geniculata externa'and interna then forming a flattened band, it winds downwards for- wards, and inwards, winding round the crus cerebri from which it likewise takes an origin, constituting the tractus opticus; next, converging towards its fellow they both unite m the optic chiasma, or commissure' wnich may be said to derive a sixth attachment from i the tuber cinereum.

MUSCLES OF THE UPPER EXTREMITY. 311 against the sternum, promoting security when the shoul- ders are thrown forcibly backwards; by fixing the sca- pula it may assist in inspiration. Eemove the costo-coraco-clavicular ligament from the clavicle; this will expose the small muscle lying beneath that bone. SuBCLAvms Muscle.—Somewhat round; arises by a short tendon from the cartilage and anterior extremity of the first rib; it immediately becomes fleshy, passes upwards, backwards, and outwards, and is inserted into a groove on the under surface of the clavicle as far out as the ridge for the attachment of the trapezoid liga- ment, between which and the conoid it lies. Relations.—Anteriorly to a layer of the costo-coracoid ligament, and the acromial, branch of the thoracia-acro- mialis, and below to the axillary vessels and nerves; behind, to the subclavian vein and the transversalis humeri artery, the posterior layer of the costo-coracoid ligament and insertion of scalenus anticus. Actions.—To fix the first rib; to press the sternal end of the clavicle against the sternum; also to depress the shoulder. The mode in which this muscle is enveloped by a dense fascial sheath prevents its contraction under ordinary circumstances interfering with the circulation in the axillary vessels; but still, by forcibly depressing the shoulder, and contracting the muscle by a voluntary effort, the pulse at the wrist may be rendered almost imperceptible. The student should now remove the fat, areolar tis- sue, and glands from the axilla, referring for the descrip- tion of its contents to the Vascular System. Having done so, let him saw across the clavicle, throw outwards and backwards the arm, in order to examine the follow- ing muscles:— Serratus Magnus.—A thin, flat sheet of muscle, lying on the anterior and lateral part of the thorax, somewhat quadrilateral; the upper margin being the shortest, the anterior the longest; it arises by trian- gular slips from the eight first ribs, external to their cartilages; the two first are tendinous, and often united; the six succeeding fleshy, and much broader than the first; these origins advance forwards as they descend, but the inferior slips are attached most remotely from the

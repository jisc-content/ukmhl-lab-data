467 MUSCLES OF THE ABDOMEN. three-quarters of an inch intervening between them, the intercostal nerves and arteries escaping between the attachments of the diaphragm and transversalis. The superior surface of the diaphragm is arched, but more so on the right than the left side; anteriorly it is almost horizontal. The highest point of the right half is on a level with the cartilage of the fourth rib, and on the left with the fifth; it is covered by the pleurae, bases of the lungs, pericardium, and heart, while inferiorly it is related to the liver, stomach, kidneys, and supra- renal capsules, spleen, and peritoneum; on the right crus rest the liver, pancreas, suprarenal capsules, kid- ney, semilunar ganglion, right phrenic artery, vena cava, and porta; it is also crossed by the hepatic ar- tery and superior transverse portion of the duodenum, likewise the renal artery: on the left crus lie the spleen, left lateral ligament of the liver, kidney, supra- renal capsule, tail of the pancreas, oesophagus, pneumo- gastric nerves, left phrenic, renal, splenic, superior and mesenteric arteries, semilunar ganglion, and the aorta. Action Haller conceived the diaphragm to rank only second in importance to the heart, as being the principal and indispensable agent in the function of respiration. Although placed within the cavity of the body, and internal to the levers on which it is destined to act, like the motive structures of invertebrate ani- mals, it is by no means an organ extensively present in the animal series, being peculiar to mammalia in its perfect state, a substitute existing in birds, consisting of two fleshy fasciculi, arising from the ensiform carti- lage, and attached to the base of the lungs, the inter- vals on either side being occupied by the upper extre- mities of the air sacs. In mammalia it pertains to the class of mixed muscles, possessing characters equally common to both: thus it is red, attached to bone, equally composed of tendon and muscular structure, supplied by the cerebro-spinal system, is partially under the control of volition, and contains striped fibres,â€” these being the distinctive characters of voluntary mtiscles. Again, it is contained within a cavity, is thin and expanded, placed between two serous membranes, the fibres, like those of the heart, are feebly striped,

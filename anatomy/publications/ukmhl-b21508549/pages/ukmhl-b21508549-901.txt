VENOUS SYSTEM. ggi fifth usually cross the spine to open separately into the greater azygos, whilst the two or three upper, with me- diastinal branches, and the phrenic form the left superior intercostal vein, which crosses the spine opposite the third dorsal vertebra, and likewise terminates in the ^reat azygos. The lumbar veins are five in number, bein" each formed by a branch from the spinal canal; a second trom the lumbar mass of muscles, and a third from the psoas and quadratus lumborum; these open into a series oi loops which surround the transverse processes of the lumbar vertebrae, constituting the ascending lumbar vein that communicates above with the vena azyo-os major whilst from each loop a transverse branch is de- tached to terminate in the cava, those of the left side ruumng behind the abdominal aorta. In addition to tiiese the ilio-lumbar vein may also be classed with the lumbar set; commencing by branches correspondin<r to the division of the artery of that name, it opens into°the common ihac; but we have often seen it terminating in the internal iliac vein. The sacral set consist of the lateral and middle sacral veins, the former receiving branches from the sacral canal, levator ani, coccygeus and pyriformis, whilst a series of transverse branches unite them with the middle sacral, and they terminate m the internal iliac; whilst the middle, commenciuff by communicating branches from the lateral and heemor- rhoidal plexus, ascends to join the left common iliac vein. We have seen this vessel absent. Vena Azygos Major and MiNOR.—These trunks are common both to the lumbar and dorsal divisions. The tornier commences in the abdomen from the ascending lumbar vein, a branch also uniting it with the cava, and sometimes,a similar communication with the renal or su- prarenal exists; it then ascends through the aortic opening m the diaphragm on the right side of the thoracic duct and, passing upwards through the posterior mediasti- num. It receives on its right side the nine inferior in- tercostals, and on the left, in succession from below up- wards vena azygos minor, fourth and fifth intercostal and the left superior intercostal; and anteriorly, the bronchial and oesophageal; opposite the third dorsal ver- tebra It arches forwards, curving over the root of the 2 Q 2

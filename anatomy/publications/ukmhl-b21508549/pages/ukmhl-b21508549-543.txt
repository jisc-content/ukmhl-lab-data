533 PERITONEUM. great omentum, small intestines; and, lower still, the caecum, sigmoid flexure, and bladder, if distended. Before entering into a description of the individual parts that are found in the abdominal cavity, it will be necessary to take a slight view of the peritoneum, and explain the relation which it holds to the several viscera, both hollow and solid, and how by its peculiar inflec- tions it envelops some only partially, while again, it affords to others a covering which might be sai'd to be all but complete. The Peritoneum is the most extensive serous mem- brane in the whole body. It forms a closed sac, the an- terior part of which is intimately attached to the abdo- minal walls in front and laterally, whilst its posterior, much larger and looser, is folded around the several viscera, which by this arrangement are seen to be com- pletely external to its cavity. In following out its several reflections it is a matter perfectly unimportant where it is commenced; but as the umbilicus has been hitherto assumed as the starting-point, we will adopt the same system, and trace it through its tortuous course, until it is again brought to the same place from which we set out. The incisions already made clearly expose the peri- toneum passing upwards, lining the whole of the ante- rior and lateral walls of the abdomen, and continuing Its course backwards to cover in the concave surface of the diaphragm, as far back as the thick margin of the hver. As it proceeds in this direction it meets with the umbilical vein, around which it forms a falciform fold which on reaching the liver spreads out and becomes continuous with the serous covering of that viscus From the under surface and posterior part of the dia- phragm It 13 now inflected downwards to the upper surface of the liver near its thick border, and, passing forwards over its convexity, it reaches its anterior mar- gin, around which it sweeps to cover in its inferior sur- face as far as the transverse fissure, where its further progress is impeded by the vessels which enter at that part. In order to cover in that portion of the liver that lies behind the fissure, we must now assume a pro- cess, that we will presently account for, sweeping irom

354 THE MUSCULAE SYSTEM. don that pursues a similar course; is received into the same groove with the extensor ossis, but separated from it by a septum; then it passes over the back of the metacarpal bone, and is inserted into the base of the first phalanx of the thumb. Relations.—These are the same as the last muscle. Action To abduct the thumb and wrist-joint, which it also extends, while the extensor primi internodii, in addition, extends the first phalanx of the thumb. Extensor Secundi Internodii Pollicis,—Narrow and shorter than the last; arises from the outer surface of the ulna, internal and inferior to the extensor primi, and from the interosseous membrane, and the strong septum which separates it from the extensor indicis; ends in a fleshy belly, to which succeeds a tendon, very low down, that enters a distinct groove in the radius, bound down by the posterior annular ligament, and lu- bricated by a bursa; next crosses the radial extensors, the first interosseous space, then the metacarpal bone of the thumb, the first phalanx, and terminates by being inserted into the last or ungual phalanx. Relations These are similar to the former, but it is much longer than it, as the insertion is advanced to the last joint. Action.—Similar to the extensor primi, but, in addi- tion, extends the last phalanx of the thumb. Extensor Indicis.—Internal to the last; arises from the outer and back part of the ulna, the interosseous ligament, and intermuscular septum; forms a fleshy belly, terminating in a tendon at the annular ligament, enters the groove for the extensor communis, lying between that tendon and the extensor secundi inter- nodii pollicis, passes over the carpus and second in- terosseous space, and at the anterior extremity of the metacarpal bone it joins the outer tendon of the exten- sor communis, with which it is inserted into the second and third phalanges. Relations.—It is covered by the superficial layer and interosseous vessels and nerves; it lies on the ulna, m- terosseous membrane, radius, carpus, first dorsal inter- osseous muscle, near its back part, and lastly, on the phalanges.

460 THE MUSCULAE SYSTEM. short head, that arises from the linea aspera, below the glutEeus maximus tendon, also from the external mter- musciilar septum; it passes downwards, backwards, and outwards, and joins the common tendon on the ante- rior surface; this tendon then passes downwards, pos- terior and external to the external lateral ligament oi the knee-joint, expands so as to inclose it m its bifur- cation; the anterior portion being inserted into the head of the fibula, the posterior also mto the head of the fibula, external side of the tibia, and fascia oi the le^'' Relations.—It is covered by the glutaeus maximus m its upper third, and fascia lata in the rest of its course; it lies on the semitendinosus and membranosus above, and vastus externus in its entire length, the sciatic nerve being first external, then crossing beneath it, and finally being to its inner side; the peroneal nerve is parallel to its tendon, which also covers the external lateral ligament, and external superior articular artery. Action-To flex the leg, and rotate it outwards when the knee-joint is flexed; also to extend the thigh on the pelvis, and support the erect position. _ ^ SEMiTENDiNOSUS—Long, flat, and slender; arises from the tuber ischii and inner edge of the biceps tendon for two or three inches; it forms a small fleshy belly, which, about four inches above the flexure ot the joint, ends in a long, round, slender tendon, that passes downwards and inwards, runs behind the internal condyle of the fZur, is th;n reflected forwards, and is inserted into th^ internal condyle of the tibia, below and behind the gracilis, with which it is united. ^ -u „ ^ Belatio.is.-lt is intersected about its centre by a tendinous line, like the complexus cervicis, and it iies onte adductor magnus, quadratus f-oris and b^^^^^^^^ nn the tendon of the semimembranosus, which it sepa rates from the inner head of the gastrocnemius, then on the bone, internal lateral ligament of the kne^jomt^ and internal inferior articular artery, and is covered by the gluteeus maximus, biceps, fascia, tendon of sar- '°"-To ^^^^^^^^^ leg and rotate the knee-joint in- wafds; aiso to" support thf pelvis in the erect position.

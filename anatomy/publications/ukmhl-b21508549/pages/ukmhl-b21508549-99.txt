89 TflE TEMPORAL BONE. forming an elevated boundary for the depression. The first or styloid, as its name implies, is similar in figure to the ancient pen, broad at its base where it is in con- nexion with the vaginal; thin and pointed inferiorly; of variable length, directed forwards and downwards, giving attachment by its apex to the stylo-glossus; by its middle to the stylo-hyoid, and by its base to the sty- lo-pharyngeus; two ligaments are also connected to it, the stylomaxillary above, and the stylohyoid below. The vaginal process surrounds its base like a sheath, and can be traced forwards and inwards to form the outer wall of the carotid hole, an important relation in the surgical operation of dividing the capsule in the removal of the lower jaw; posteriorly it stretches back as far as the mastoid process, from which it is separated by a slight groove, through which the auricular branch of the fascial nerve glides to supply the retrahens muscle of the ear; anteriorly and externally it passes upwards and forwards to separate the glenoid cavity from the external auditory meatus (processus audito- rius), and terminates at the outer edge of the fissure of Glaser by bending backwards, posterior to a small offset from the horizontal root of the zygoma, which descends in front of it. The external auditory meatus, which lies on a plane superior and posterior to the last described cavity, is of an oval shape, long from above downwards, its edges rounded off, except anteriorly, where it is sharp and rough, being the terminal portion of the vaginal process already described, more generally known as the auditory; behind it is the mastoid process, and above the horizontal ramus of the zygoma; to its edges is at- tached the cartilage, which completes the tube of the ear, which, with the bony portion to be more particu- larly described hereafter, forms a canal about an inch in length. The mastoid portion of the bone is much stronger than the squamous; in figure it is triangular or nipple- shaped,â€”hence its name; its margins, thick and ser- rated, articulate above with the postero-inferior angle of the parietal; behind and inferiorly with the occipital; its external surface rough and convex; broad above, but gradually becoming more contracted as it descends,

CEREBRAL NERVES. 665 and inwards, are distributed to the integument on the side of the nose. This branch is sometimes very large, and supplies a portion of the filaments of the proper frontal. The proper frontal passes through the supra- orbital notch, sending a small branch into the osseous diploe, which may be traced to the frontal sinus, then runs between the corrugator supercilii and the orbi- cularis palpebrarum, and, ascending, divides into two branches,—an external and internal: the former, large, passes upwards and outwards between the occipito- frontahs and the periosteum, and, dividing into long and flat branches, is principally distributed to the intpgu- ments, very few being given either to the periosteum or muscle; whde the latter or internal frontal pierces the upper fibres of the orbicularis muscle, being distributed to the integument, both sending branches as far back ; as the lambdoid suture. Nasal Nerve arises from the ophthalmic, and is in- I termediate in size between the lachrymal and frontal : enters the orbit through the base of the sphenoidal I fissure between the two heads of the external rectus I then passes between the two divisions of the third- .coursing forwards and inwards between the superior '.division of that nerve, with the superior rectus above sand the optic below, it reaches the inner wall of the .orbit, where it lies above the internal rectus and below ttbe superior oblique, here dividing into an external or imtratrochleator, and an internal or proper nasal; the 1 latter, appearing as the continued trunk of the nerve •enters a groove leading to the anterior ethmoidal fora- :imen, and, passing through it, arrives within the cavity of tthe cranium, then crosses the cribriform plate in a sul- cus or groove, and descends through the nasal slit at ^the side of the crista galli, and, entering the cavity of tthe nose, divides into an internal and external branch- ! the former passes downwards and forwards, entering the ; Jeep surface of the mucous membrane of the septum and -can be traced even as low as the floor of the nose, while tthe latter, after giving one filament to ramify on the ^anterior part of the external wall and the spongy bones rruns on the posterior surface of the nasal bones in an osseous groove, sending filaments through it to the skin

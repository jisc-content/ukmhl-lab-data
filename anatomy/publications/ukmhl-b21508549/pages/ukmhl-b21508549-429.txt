419 BLADDER. there being no absolute separation, a thin covering of fascia preserving their relations to the ligaments. The external edge of each is united with the lateral liga- ment at the pubic attachment, the lower margin re- ceiving the posterior layer of the apex of the triangular ligament, and the superior, the fascia transversalis; the upper surface corresponds to a cellular interval behind the pubis, and the lower to the prostate, forming the superior part of its capsule; posteriorly they are so in- timately connected with the longitudinal muscular fibres of the bladder, that some authors consider them to be the tendons of those musclesv The Bladder is divided into a summit, body, in- ferior fundus, and cervix, these occurring from above downwards in the order in which they are enume- rated ; it is also divided anatomically into six re- gions,—anterior, posterior, lateral, superior, and in- ferior. The anterior corresponds to the recti, parti- cularly when the organ is distended either wholly or partially, to the posterior surface of the symphisis pubis, anterior true ligaments, triangular ligament, and prostate gland; the posterior is in relation with the pos- terior false ligaments and their contents, recto-vesical cul de sac, and the convolutions of the ilium and rectum; la- terally the lateral true and false ligaments, levatores ani, and vasa deferentia, with the obliterated hypogastric arteries; the superior region corresponds to the superior false ligament, hypogastric arteries, and urachus, also to the convolutions of the small intestines in the erect posi- tion ; the inferior region is in relation with the recto-ve- sical fascia, rectum, vesicute seminales, and vasa defe- rentia. The coats or coverings are five in number, se- rous, cellular, muscular, deep cellular or submucous, and mucous. The serous tunic is a partial investment only, the anterior region being wholly uncovered, the pos- terior altogether covered; the lateral as far forwards as the vasa deferentia, or about one-half; the superior as far as the urachus and obliterated hypogastric arteries ■ the inferior to the base of the vesiculas seminales. Thus about the posterior half of the whole organ is invested by peritoneum; but there is a larger amount covered when it is distended, as it enlarges between the layers

V 666 NERVOUS SYSTEM. and continuing its course, pierces the fibrous tissue, ■which unites the lateral cartilage to the bone, and, be- coming cutaneous, expands into fan-like branches on the side of the nasal ala. Branches Whilst in the anterior part of the caver- nous sinus, the nasal nerve receives filaments from the sympathetic or carotid plexus, and on entering the orbit a twig of communication is given off to the superior di- vision of the third; after this, and whilst on the outer side of the optic nerve, the long root of the lenticular ganglion is given off, which will be examined hereafter with the two long ciliary branches, arising on the inner side of the optic nerve, as they appertain to the same system; lastly, at the inner wall of the orbit, the infra- trochleator branch comes off, which, passing forwards beneath the pulley of the superior oblique, pierces the inferior palpebral ligament, sending branches through the fibrous covering of the lachrymal sac to supply it as well as the nasal duct, and ultimately terminating in the lower lid, assisting in forming the inferior tarsal arch with the subcutaneous malse, and a branch from the infra-orbital. Lenticular or Ophthalmic Ganglion is somewhat lenticular or ovoid in shape, the larger extremity situated behind; the smaller in front, placed on the external side of the optic nerve, and internal to the external rectus, lying about three lines from the optic foramen; and be- hind, but at some distance from the globe of the eye, and generally surrounded by a quantity of loose fatty tissue; the surface turned towards the optic nerve is concave, whilst that on the outer side is convex, and it presents four angles,—the posterior superior receiving the long root from the nasal, and the posterior inferior that from the inferior oblique division of the third, whilst from the anterior angles arise the ciliary nerves. The ganglion consists of two very obvious constituents: at its posterior margin the two white filaments which form it unite in a loop, the concavity of which is di- rected backwards, and from these, short plexiform fila- ments pass forwards, whilst in their areolsE the granular ganglion cells are involved, so that the posterior margin is white, the anterior or greater portion being grey; but

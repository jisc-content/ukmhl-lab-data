THE OSSEOUS SYSTEM. 60 tlie pyriformis; then the superior gemellus; then the obturator internus; then the inferior gemellus; and lastly, the obturator externus. On the outer and upper part of the shaft is the great trochanter, quadri- lateral in shape, higher posteriorly than anteriorly, in- clined inwards so as to overlap the neck; rough exter- nally and covered by a large bursa, over which the crlutseus maximus glides; on its upper edge are two facettes, the most posterior for the insertion of the glu- teus medius; the anterior for that of the glutseus mini- mus. The lesser trochanter is much smaller m size and conical in shape, situated on the internal and posterior part of the bone on a plane inferior to the greater; its apex is rounded, and is covered by a small bursa, over which the conjoined tendons of the psoas and iliacus glide to be inserted into its root inferiorly; anteriorly at its junction with the shaft there is a rough concave de- pression for the insertion of the accessory ligament of the hip-joint; and posteriorly it gives origin to the vastus internus. The shaft of the bone is cylindrical in shape, expanded above and below; contracted in the centre; twisted inwards, presenting for examination four surfacesâ€”an anterior, internal, external, and pos- terior Of these the anterior is convex from above downwards; generally rounded, but rather flat supe- riorly and inferiorly; its superior three-fourths gives attachment to the crurasus; its inferior to the subcru- reeus. Externally it is nearly straight, affording origin to the vastus externus for its whole length. Int^naUy it is concave, and has the vastus internus attached to it Its posterior surface is concave, and presents m its middle third an elevated ridge or crest, the Imeaaspera; its upper extremity bifurcates into two roots; a long one externally, which connects it to the great tro- chanter; a shorter one internally which unites it to the lesser- to the first is attached from without inwards the vastus externus, glutasus maximus, and adductor macrnus; to the second from within outward, the vastus internus, pectineus, and adductor brevis. The linea aspera itself presents two lips: an external, affording attachment to the vastus externus and gluteus max- imus with the short head of biceps, the latter muscle

FIBULA, 67 by a vertical ridge dividing it into two parts; from its three superior fourths the extensor digitorum communis takes its origin; from its middle third, but on a plane posterior to the last, the extensor pollicis arises, and to its inferior half, but anterior to the other two, the pe- ronffius antieus is attached. The external surface is rounded and slightly convex; from its upper third the peronfEus longus arises, and immediately below it the peronseus brevis; still lower down the bone is subcu- taneous. Its posterior surface is contracted above, ex- panded in the centre, and again constricted below; su- periorly the long head of the soloeus is attached; along its inner margin for a great part of its length, the tibi- alis posticus, and more externally for its inferior two- thirds, the flexor pollicis longus. The lower part of the bone expands into the external malleolus. This is of a conical shape, gradually diminishing to a point be- low ; it is exceedingly thick, rounded, and subcutaneous externally, fitted closely into the groove of the tibia internally; flattened and covered with cartilage; still lower down, where it articulates with the astragalus, comparatively sharp and prominent anteriorly, where the anterior slip of the external lateral and anterior an- nular ligaments are connected to it; broad and grooved posteriorly for the tendons of the perontei; pointed in- feriorly and posteriorly for the origin of the posterior slip of the external lateral ligament, and hollowed out immediately internal to this for the middle slip. The fibula articulates with two bones only, the tibia and astragalus, but at two points with the former bone. It is developed from three points of ossification, one for the shaft, which is visible about the seventh or eighth year, one for the upper portion, which appears about the fifth year, and one for the lower extremity, about the second. The wliole are united from the twentieth to the twenty-fifth year. The Foot.â€”This portion of the skeleton, exactly as the hand, is composed of several bones of different sizes, united firmly to each other by ligament; but as it is destined to support the weight of the whole trunk, it is natural to expect that the osseous parts entering into its formation should be on a much larger and stronger

It is probable that they increase the surface on which the vessels are primarily ramified, but that their size and number exercises any peculiar influence on the psychical manifestations is at present without sufficient proof The internal surface of each hemisphere is flat, and separated from its fellow by the great longitudinal fissure, containing the falx cerebri, which in the majority of cases constitutes a septum be- tween them; but in some rare examples the greater part of the falx has been noticed deficient when the two hemispheres were fused with each other. The longi- tudinal fissure passes completely through the cerebrum before and behind, but in the centre the corpus callo- sum renders it imperlect. If now the hemispheres are gently drawn asunder the arachnoid will be seen uniting them on the upper surface of the corpus callosum, this latter coming into view when that membrane is torn. On the internal surface of the hemisphere a well-marked and persistent lobule is observed, called callosal lobule, outlet, or gyrus fornicatus, which, passing in an arched direction above the corpus callosum, bends forwards and downwards on the inner surface of the anterior lobe, anterior to which, and eccentric to its curve, lies the proper lobule of the anterior lobe; behind, bending downwards and backwards, it is continued along the inferior surface of the brain to the inner edge of the middle lobe, where it bounds the transverse fissure ex- ternally; so that the fissure of Sylvius is the only point of interruption in the continuity of this lobule; supe- riorly its margin is serrated, constituting the crest of Vic d'Azir, whilst its inferior surface is separated from the corpus callosum by the ventricle of the hemisphere, into which the handle of a scalpel can be passed. Now cut ofi" one hemisphere to the level of the corpus callosum, and the centrum ovale minus of Vic d'Azir will be exposed. This consists of a central surface ol white or fibrous structure, surrounded byawavylme of cineritious or grey matter,-some red points being also visible, indicating the extremities of vessels divided by the incision. On removing the opposite hemisphere,

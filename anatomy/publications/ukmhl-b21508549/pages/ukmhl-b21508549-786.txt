776 ARTERIES AND VEINS. roots to which they are connected, and covered on both surfaces by a layer of serous membrane, the hmng ot the artery; their figure is such as their name would im- ply, but remarkable from the fact of presentmg m their free margin, about the centre, a small but firm tubeix e, of variable size, and always constantly present ihe fibrous structure constituting these curtains, although exceedingly thin, still presents an arrangement ot its fibres easily demonstrable, the most external formmg continuous curves parallel to their attached margms while the internal, on the contrary, which are much thicker and stronger, form a double crescent, of which the cornu of the valve constitutes one extremity, and the tubercle or corpus Arantii the other. _ Now, m the passage of the blood from the ventricle into the aor a, ^he valves are necessarily thrown up against its walls, and here the corpora Arantii accomplish a very impor- tant office, in producing such an amount of separation as to permit the fluid to insinuate itself between them, and thus, by distending the aortic sinuses, to act me- chanically on the valves in forcing them downwards, and thus' opposing the retrograde course of the com- pressed stream; these Arantian bodies have been like- wise said to strengthen the valves, and, more accurate y, to occlude any minute aperture that might possibly exist between their approximated margins. If we now direct our attention to the boundaries of the commencement of this vessel, or the aortic zone, we will find them to be the following :--Anteriorly he prolongation upwards of the base ot the right ventiicle ^ infundibulum, coronary arteries, and -Uf^fi--;^^;^ diac plexus: posteriorly it rests upon, and is accuiately adapS to, ^h^ anterior'median furrow l-Jween the t.^^^ auricles- on the right side it corresponds to a groove Sween'the infundibulum and auriculo-ventricular ori- fice and on the left to the wall of the corresponding auricir It is here the arch of the aorta may be said o commence, a point corresponding to tbe junction of die can luge of the fourth nb with tl- sternum oi the lef side, and passing upwards, f^^^^^s, a. d o th^^^^^^^^^ as far as the second costal cartilage on ^^^^^^^^^^ ing portion), turns backwards and shghtly upwards,

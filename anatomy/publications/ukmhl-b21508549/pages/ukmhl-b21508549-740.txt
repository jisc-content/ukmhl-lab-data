730 NERVOUS SYSTEM. together by neurine of analogous character to the cord itself. These ganglia are situated on the head of each corresponding rib, and intercostal artery and vein, and are covered by the pleura and subjacent fibrous tissue. The branches which they throw off may be divided into external and internal. External Branches.—These are filaments of com- munication from each ganglion to each corresponding dorsal nerve; they are always two in number, one springing from its external angle, and the second from its deep surface, _ Internal Branches.—These may be divided into thoracic and abdominal; the former being distributed by several fine filaments to the aorta, to the pulmonary and cardiac plexuses, and, according to one very high au- thority, to the bodies of the vertebras, while the latter consist of the greater and lesser splanchnic nerves. Greater Splanchnic Nerve arises generally from the sixth ganglion, but it may come ofi" higher up; the cord which it forms receives in succession filaments from the seventh, eighth, ninth, and tenth, which join it_ at a very acute angle, increasing its size. On reachmg the lower part of the thorax, it becomes flattened, and, piercing the crura of the diaphragm, it enters the abdo- men, where it expands into two ganglionic bodies,— the semilunar, the convexities of which are turned downwards and outwards, are serrated, giving off nu- merous branches from each tooth-like process; the con- cavity upwards and inwards, from which likewise numerous branches are thrown off, presenting several minute ganglia, surrounding completely the ca3liac axis, and constituting the solar plexus. Each semilunar ganglion rests on its corresponding crus, and is partially overlapped by the suprarenal capsules, which, however, are a little external to them, the vena cava covering the rio-ht, while the solar plexus is supported by the abdo- mTnal aorta, and has in front of it the ascendmg layer of the transverse mesocolon ; it receives filaments Iroin the ri<Tht pneumogastric, occasionally also some Irom the plu-enic, and it has a quantity of loose areolar tissue, minc^led up in its formation with numerous small lym- phatic glands. The plexuses which are derived from

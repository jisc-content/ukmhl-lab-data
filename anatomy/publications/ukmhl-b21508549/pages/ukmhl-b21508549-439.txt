429 URETHRA, The vesiculffi seminales are reservoirs for the seminal fluid, which is proved by several circumstances: firstly, that in animals where coitus is rapid they are inva- riably present, and when, on the contrary, that act is prolonged, as in the canine species, these sacs are absent; secondly, the semen is perfect in all its essential constituents before it arrives at this ,point, and conse- quently they cannot add any important element to that secretion; thirdly, fluids injected into the vas deferens passes first into the vesicula, before it reaches the ure- thra. During the act of coitus, the irritation of the glans excites a reflex action of the levatores ani, by which the secretion is urged from the vesicles into the urethra, from which it is then ejected in jerks. But in opposition to this view it may be remarked, that Hun- ter found the vesicles full even to distention, imme- 1 diately after coitus, and in a case where the testicle had 1 been removed, the vesicle on the corresponding side was ( discovered to be quite full. Again, spermatozoa are not <. observed in the fluid taken from the vesicula in any i great amount, and in the elephant there exist special : seminal reservoirs, although the vesiculse are present. Membranous Portion of the Urethra extends from I the prostate to the bulb; it is arched upwards and for- 1 wards, lying partly within and partly without the pelvis; uts length varies above and belowâ€”superiorly being from t three-quarters to an inch, and inferiorly scarcely half- san-mch; the disparity results from the direction of the I bulb being downwards and backwards, overlapping the 1 lower surface of the canal, and thus diminishing the s space for the opening of the urethra in lithotomy. It fperforates the triangular ligament one inch below the ssymphisis pubis, but as the two layers are somewhat sseparated at this point, the greater portion of this di- msion of the canal is found between them, and as it Fpasses through, a layer or process is reflected forwards con the bulb, and a similar process backwards on the nntrapelvic portion of tiie canal and under surface of tthe prostate, for which it assists in forming the capsule, rbecoming continuous with the recto-vesical layer, or iTyrrell's fascia. This should not be confounded with

In this stage of the operation the obturator artery may be wounded, when arising from the internal epigastric, instead of its usual origin from the internal iliac, in which case it usually passes internal and anterior to the neck of the sac, but even with this anomalous origin it may pass be- hind the neck, and thus be removed from all danger (see Anatomy of the Arteries). This form of hernia is more frequent in the female: first, because the crural arch is wider, because the fasciee are weaker, and the muscles which naturally occupy the space are smaller than in the male. The abdominal rings are also smaller in the female, obviating the tendency to inguinal protrusion. GLUTJEAL REGION. In order to examine this region, place a block beneath the pelvis, to make the parts tense; carry an incision round the crest of the ilium from the posterior spinous process "downwards on the side of the sacrum to the coccyx, and then let it be continued obliquely down- wards and outwards to the junction of the upper and middle thirds of the femur. The skin is thick and dense in this region, particularly over the tuber ischii, and is supported by a fatty subcutaneous areolar tissue, usu- ally described as the superficial fascia; anteriorly and superiorly it partakes somewhat of the characters of that structure; but inferiorly, where it forms the fold of the buttock, the fatty granules constitute a thick elastic mass, being supported by dense bands of areolo-fibrotis struc- ture, which preclude displacement of the adipose tissue during the sitting posture. In this layer on the buttock several cutaneous nerves are exposed; most anteriorly a branch being sent back from the musculo-cutaneous, a branch of the lumbar plexus, arising from that nerve, half- an-inch below the anteriorspine of the ilium, and running backwards over the sheath of the tensor vaginse to be lost in the skin; more posteriorly, the external branch of the last dorsal nerve, having pierced the transversalis, internal and external oblique muscles, turns over the crest of the ilium, and also terminates in the integu- u 3

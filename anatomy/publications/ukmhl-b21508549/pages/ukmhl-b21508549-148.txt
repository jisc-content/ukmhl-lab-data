THE OSSEOUS SYSTEM. to the Olfactory filaments; it now descends through a slit at the side of the crista galli and reaches the roof ot the nose where it divides into two branches,_a pos- terior, which passes downwards and backwards on the septum which it supplies, and anastomoses with the spheno-palatme; and an anterior, which grooves the nasa bones, and then passes out between these and the nasal cartilages to be distributed to the tip or lobe of tne nose. I his nerve connects in some measure the nose and orbit together, as irritation of it causes copious lachrymation. ^ The last cavities which we will have to describe are the orbits, those bony cases which contain the orcran of vision, with Its muscular and nervous provisions °They are two in number, placed immediately beneath the cranium and above the face; conical in shape, the base turned forwards and outwards, the apex backwards and inwards, so that two probes, if made to traverse the long axis of each, and carried backwards into the cra- nium, would decussate nearly at the sella turcica The rim or edge of the orbit is quadrilateral in figure, but the angles are rounded off, composed of three bones,— the frontal above, the malar externally and inferiorly, and the superior maxillary inferiorly and internally. It has four walls,—a superior or roof, an inferior or floor an external and internal; all of which terminate in a point, and meet posteriorly at the ridge of bone between the lacerated and optic hole. The superior wall or roof IS concave, and consists of two bones, the frontal and lesser wmg of the sphenoid; it looks downwards and forwards, and presents externally and anteriorly a deep depression for the reception of the lachrymal gland, and internally and anteriorly a small spicula of bone for the tendon of the superior oblique to be attached to. The inferior wall is flat and smooth; it looks upwards, for- wards, and outwards, and is formed by three bones,— the malar anteriorly, the superior maxillary in the middle, and the small process of the palate bone poste- riorly. At its junction internally with the malar bone It gives origin to the inferior oblique muscle, and near Its centre it is generally more or less fissured for the infra-orbital canal. The internal wall is slightly con-

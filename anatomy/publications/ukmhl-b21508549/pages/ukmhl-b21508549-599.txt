FEMALE ORGANS OF GENERATION. 589 surface is covered by a vascular mucous membrane, which is exceedingly sensitive; its structure will be better understood by raising the integument of the labia majora and the mucous membrane of the nymphae, and then cleaning away some areolar tissue. It will now become apparent that the clitoris is formed by the union of the crura clitoridis, resembling in many respects the crura penis; they arise narrow from the rami of the is- chium and pubis, run upwards, forwards, and inwards, converging, and about a line in front of the symphisis pubis they join, then curve a little downwards, and terminate in a pointed extremity, convex superiorly and posteriorly, concave inferiorly, and presenting a groove below, in which the urethra is lodged. On the surface of these tubes of erectile tissue a small erector is visible, and the sphincter vaginte splits superiorly to inclose the clitoris, resembling the accelerator muscle in the male. Meatus Urinarius.—Tiis opening is situated about an inch below the clitoris, and immediately above the anterior edge of the vagina, being full, prominent, and projecting m the adult, but depressed in the old sub- ject. It is always closed, except during micturition. Vagina—This is a membranous canal, extending from the uterus above to the vulva inferiorly, con- stituting the organ of copulation in the female. The whole canal is conical in shape, large above, narrow and constricted inferiorly, curved, with its concavity • directed upwards and forwards, and placed in the axis of the pelvis, the anterior wall being about four inches, and the posterior five; it presents for descrip- tion an anterior and posterior, with two lateral sur- faces, and a uterine and vulvar extremity; anteriorly It corresponds to the base of the bladder, to which it . is united by areolar tissue, and a process of the vesical I fascia, while more inferiorly it receives the urethra in la grooved canal in its structure; posteriorly it corre- ssponds to the recto-vaginal pouch of the peritoneum in I Its upper fourth, and in the remainder to the rectum ;to which it is united by lax areolar tissue; laterally it tcorresponds to the broad ligament of the uterus and !more mleriorly to the fibres of the levator ani; the su- iperior or uterine extremity embraces the cervix uteri

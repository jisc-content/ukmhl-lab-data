CAVITY OP THE ABDOMEN, 570 each other, but a small interval exists between them, which is always more or less dilated. At the termina- tion of the neck the cystic duct commences; it is usually very small in caliber, and contrasts strikingly in size with that of the common bile duct, which is generally as large as a goose-quill; passing downwards, and to the left side, it unites after a course of about an inch and a half with the last-named tube at a very acute angle, the mucous membrane again forming a well-marked valve at their point of junction. It lies between the layers of the lesser omentum on the vena porta and to the right side of the cystic artery, which always gives olF a small branch for its supply. The structure of the biliary ducts and gall bladder is precisely similar: they have three coats,—an external or serous, a middle or areolo-fibrous, and an internal or mucous. The peritoneal tunic is not complete, but is deficient altogether on the lower portion of the common biliary duct, the upper, with the cystic, only borrowing a partial investment from the lesser omentum; the gall bladder is covered generally only inferiorly, the serous membrane simply binding it to the fossa in the liver, but sometimes it has been found forming a species of mesentery for it, and embracing it nearly completely. The areolo-fibrous tissue which constitutes the middle coat is strong, but very lax in its character; in the gall bladder it isintersected by several strong, cord-like fibres, which form elevated ridges on the mucous membrane internally, their apparent usebeing to preserve the shape of the viscus, and counteract over-extension. The mu- cous lining is derived from that of the duodenum; it is thin, and presents numerous follicles irregularly ar- ranged in the ductus communis choledochus and hepatic ducts, but constituting two distinct vertical rows in the smaller tubes. In the gall bladder it is also follicular, and the depressions are so very numerous as to give it the appearance of an affection sometimes seen in the skin,—cutis anserina. We have already alluded to the two large valves which are found in its neck, but exclu- sive of these, a great number, but much smaller in size exist, in the cystic duct; these never observe the same direction, but may be transverse, vertical, or ob-

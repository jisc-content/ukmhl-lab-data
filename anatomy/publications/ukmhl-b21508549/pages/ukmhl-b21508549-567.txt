LARGE INTESTINE. 557 fold wtiich connects the sigmoid flexure to the left iliac fossa is generally very loose and long, and consequently it embraces it nearly completely, but the rectum re- ceives a perfect tube from it in its superior third, but in its middle only a partial covering, while in its infe- rior it is altogether deficient. The serous membrane likewise embraces and binds to the large intestines a series of fatty processes (appendices epiploicas), which are generally found on its anterior and internal walls. They are of variable size, being sometimes exceedingly small, and again so large as nearly to embrace the en- tire caliber of the gut. Their precise use is not known, but they have been usually described as reservoirs of nutrition, a theory which is not certainly borne out by fact, as we have observed them of a more than ordinary size in cases where emaciation had proceeded to very great extent. In the infant they are always absent. Muscular Coat.â€”This consists of two planes, a longitudinal, which are superficial, and a circular, which are deeper; the former can be traced from the apex of the vermiform appendix to its base, where they are very numerous, but as they pass up on the csecum, they converge towards three distinct points, so as to form three bands, which extend along the gut, sometimes as far as the iipper third of the descending colon, but oc- casionally to the commencement of the sigmoid flexure, where they are reduced to two in number, those on the posterior surface gradually converging and ultimately uniting. On the inferior part of this portion of the tube they are scattered, and for the whole extent of the rectum surround it completely, and appear to be at last blended with the fibres of the levator ani. Of the three bands which are found on the ascending colon, one is anterior; this is strong, dense, and of a glistening whiteness; one posterior and external; and one poste- rior and internal, the two latter being weaker and badly marked. In the transverse colon the position of these bands becomes changed, that which was anterior becomes inferior, that which was internal, superior, and that which was external, anterior; in the descending colon, however, they again resume the arrangement which they bore on the ascending, this transposition, in fact, depend-

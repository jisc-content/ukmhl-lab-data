243 MUSCLES OF THE FACE. M 2 muscles of opposite sides produce a rotatory movement of the jaw. If the mouth be widely opened, these mus- cles assist in dislocating the condyle forwards. The Tempokal Aponeurosis is dense, white, and se- micircular ; attached above to the curved ridge on the frontal, parietal, and mastoid portion of the temporal boneT^nd below inclosing the zygomatic arch between its layers. It consists of two strata, dilFering in strength and density, and separated by a small quantity of fat, the zygoma, the middle branch of the temporal artery, and a twig of the orbital division of the superior maxil- lary nerve; the superficial layer is strong, with inter- lacing fibres; the deep, weaker, but intimately adhe- rent to the muscvilar fibres beneath, which it retains in their proper position during their contraction. Now raise the aponeurosis, and carefully dissect off the mas- seter from the ramus of the jaw; as yet it is unneces- sary to interfere with the zygomatic arch. Temporal Muscle.—Fan-shaped or triangular, broad and fleshy above, narrow and tendinoris below; arises from the fascia, which covers it, from the temporal fossa and inner surface of the zygoma, and by short fibres from the crest on the great wing of the sphenoid bone above the external pterygoid; the anterior fibres pass downwards and backwards, the middle vertically, the posterior almost horizontally forwards, gliding over the trochlear origin of the zygoma, and the sphenoidal for- wards and outwards, becoming all attached to the sur- faces and edges of a triangular flat tendon, similar in figure to the muscle, between the layers of which it is seen commencing about an inch superior to the arch, composed of flat bands or fasciculi at its commence- ment, loosely connected with each other above, but fused into a dense fibrous mass below, where it reaches the coronoid process of the inferior maxillary bone, into which it is inserted. Relations.—It is covered by the skin, superficial fas- cia, temporal artery and its branches, attrahens and attollens aurem muscles, temporo-auricular nerve, with the temporal branches of the portio dura, and temporal branch of superior maxillary; then a layer of the epi- cranial aponeurosis, which intimately adheres to the

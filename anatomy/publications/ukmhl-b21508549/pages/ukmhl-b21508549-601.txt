FEMALE ORGANS OF GENERATION. 591 skin, the epithelium on its surface being squamous or cuneiform; the secretion has an acid re-action, beino- destitute of mucous corpuscles, and in many diseased conditions containing a peculiar animalcule, described by Donne as the trichomonos vaginse; vibirones are also seen in this secretion, associated, like the former, with puriform exudation. Internal Fibrous Layer.—This is stronger above than below, and loosely attached to the mucous layer. Erectile Layer resembles somewhat in structure the corpus spongiosum urethree, inferiorly being thick and well marked, the veins forming an intricate network on its surface, but superiorly scarcely visible in the majority of instances, while it becomes atrophied in old age. External Fibrous Layer—This tubule is derived from the vesical fascia; strong and dense below, it serves to support the vaginal venous plexuses, whilst above it is mcorporated with the cervix uteri. In addition to the foregoing the peritoneum constitutes a partial se- rous mvestment on the superior fourth of the posterior surface of the canal. Dartoid Layer surrounds the canal, and also con- nects it to the contiguous organs; it possesses a con- tractile power analogous to the similar tissue in the scrotum of the male, assisting in the resiliency of the vagina, when that tube has been distended. Vessels—The vaginal arteries are two in number, arising from the internal iliac, which course alono- the sides of the canal, while branches of the vesicaf and middle hemorrhoidal are also distributed to it The veins communicate with the vesical and ha^morrhoidal plexuses, before entering the internal iliac. Nerves.—These are derived from two sources, namely --the sacra plexus of the spinal, and the hypogastric of the sympathetic. The Uterus is of a pyriform figure, situated ob- liquely m the axis of the true pelvis, the base being directed upwards and forwards, the os downwards and backwards, the anterior surface flattened, looking down- wards and forwards, the posterior more convex up- wards and backwards; its measurement being in length

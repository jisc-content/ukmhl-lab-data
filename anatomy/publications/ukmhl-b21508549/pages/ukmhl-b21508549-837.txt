827 BRANCHES OF BRACHIAL. chial may also separate into its two divisions, at some distance either above or below the coronoid process, and it should likewise be borne in mind that the median nerve often crosses behind and not in front of the artery. Collateral Branches of the Brachial.—Several to the muscles clothing the humerus, and one usually large as the nutritious artery of the bone; those which have received names are,—the superior profunda, infe- rior profunda, and anastomotica magna. Superior Profunda—The largest branch; arises from the brachial immediately below the tendons of the latissimus dorsi and teres major; passes backwards and outwards in company with the musculo-spiral nerve between the short and long head of the triceps; then between that muscle and the bone, where it divides into two branches,—an olecranoid or posterior, and a muscu- lo-spiral or anterior; the latter winds round the humerus, which it grooves, and, dividing into two branches, of which one perforates the external intermuscular sep- tum, reaches the cleft between the supinator longus and brachialis anticus, where it anastomoses with the an- terior radial recurrent, while the second descends be- hind the external condyle to communicate with the posterior interosseous recurrent; the olecranoid branch passing nearly vertically downwards, lying in the sub- stance of the triceps, to the same point, where its anasto- mosis is similar. Anomalies—It may arise in common with the pos- terior circumflex, the trunk of origin being in this in- stance from the brachial, or it may spring from a branch common to it and the inferior profunda. Inferior Profunoa Smaller than the last; arises from the brachial opposite the insertion of the coraco- brachialis, and passing at first downwards and back- wards on the brachialis anticus, and between the ulnar nerve and brachial artery, perforates with the former the internal intermuscular septum, then a few fibres of the triceps, and arrives at the groove between the in- ternal condyle and olecranon process, between the two heads of the flexor carpi ulnaris, and anastomoses with the posterior ulnar recurrent. Anomalies.—It arises generally in common with the

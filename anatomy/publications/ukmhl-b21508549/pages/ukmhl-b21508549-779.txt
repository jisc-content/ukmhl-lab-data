THE EAR. fjgg the jugular fossa, can only be considered, like that of the vestibule, to be a channel for the removal of the venous blood from the interior of the cavity. Having now concluded the descripiion of the osseous It will be necessary to direct our attention to what has been termed the membranous labyrinth, and before do- ing so. It may be necessary to observe, that it is by no means as extensive as the preceding, beinn- deficient altogether in the cochlea. It consistsTm fact, of three semicircular canals, moulded, as it were, within, and exactly resemb ing the osseous; but as the former are much smaller than the latter, an interval exists between them which is_ filled up by a transparent fluid,_the iquor Co unnii, or perilymph ofBreschet; they have likewise the dilatation or ampulla at one of their ex tremities, and the two vertical open by a common onfice, thus forming for the three,'five aJertureraUo- The Membranous Vestibule differs from the osseous n not consisting of a single, but a double cavity ThZ have been termed the saccule, situated superiorly and apparently constituted by the five orifices of the mem branous semicircular canals, which expand as they opm nto It; and the utricle which lies in the lower part of the fovea semi-elliptica, and which is much la ger I an the preceding; It has not exactly been determin^l whe- ther these cavities communicate, but the general idea I , that they do not. Like the membranous semicir- cular canals, they are likewise surrounded by the peri- lymph of Breschet, and they are all preserved in /hL tended state by a similar fluid, called^ eJdoirpl o" Scarpa. _ I should be recollected that, althoCh the cochlea IS devoid of an apparatus similar to tl Se iust de cnbed, sti 1 it, as well as the vestibule and sc^',idr cular canals, is lined by a fine fibrous membrane aX gous nearly to serous, which adheres closely to heir bony walls constituting, in fact, a periosteun^i or t e entire cavity. ^'^ exiV^i";'" membranous utricle and ventricle there exists a cretaceous powder, deposited in two whhe hming masses, analogous to the calcareous deZshl found m the ears of fishes, and known by the zX of

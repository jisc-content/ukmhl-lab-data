424 THE MUSCULAR SYSTEM. liquely forwards and inwards; if a fine probe is intro- duced into the opening, and passed upwards, it will be seen that the tube first enters the muscular coat di- rectly, then passes obliquely for about six lines, and pierces the fibro-elastic tissue of the trigone, at its pos- terior external angle. At the point of termination there is a direct fusion of the fibrous coat of the ureter and the trigone, the reticular muscular fibres and ex- ternal cellular coat of the bladder being continued on its external surface for some distance upwards. • Arteries of the Bladder—These are divisible into anterior and posterior; the anterior are several twigs, arising from the obturator and its transverse pubic branch -, the posterior consist of superior, middle, and infe- rior : the first arises from the contracted hypogastric ar- tery, near the summit of the organ; the second is derived directly from the internal iliac; and the third are most numerous, being branches of the pudic sciatic, middle hemorrhoidal, and are distributed to the inferior fundus. Veins These are situated at the inferior fundus, where they form a plexus, receiving in front the pro- static plexus, laterally the dorsal veins of the penis, and also the branches of the vesical veins. In old age these veins are often large and varicose, sometimes con- taining veinstones or phlebolites, and are supported by the recto-vesical fascia, surrounded by lax areolar tissue; they frequently adhere to this fascia, particu- larly in advanced life, and if divided in the operation of lithotomy, give rise to troublesome hemorrhage, because the mouths are kept open by the adhesion to the fascia. These veins pour their contents into the in- ternal iliac by two efferent venous trunks provided with valves. t • , • ^ The Absorbents of the Bladder are divisible into two sets,—a superficial and deep plexus. The efferent vessels are found at the base, in the vicinity of the veins which they accompany, pass through the lumbar glands, in their course to the common lymphatic receptacle. Cruveilhier once saw them filled with pus m a case of catarrh, but still, their existence has been disputed, and the fact of the watery parts of the urine being absorbed during retention proves nothing, as this iunc-

BRANCHES OF AORTA. 837 hepatic, thus constituting an arch, from the convexity of which branches are detached for the supply of both the anterior and posterior surface of the stomach, communicating with similar offsets from the epiploic arteries. Hepatic—This is much larger than the preceding, and extends from the celiac axis as far as the transverse fissure of the liver, but because in its course it presents a well-marked angle, it has been divided into two stages,—a transverse, running directly to the right side, nearly as far as the ductus communis choledochus; and a vertical, from the latter point to within an inch of the transverse fissure, where it divides into two branches,— a right and left, which enter the extremities of the lat- ter, to be distributed to the hepatic structure as vagi- nal, interlobular, and lobular branches. Relations—First Stage.—Ant&ciovlj, pyloric extremity of stomach and lesser omentum; posteriorly, rio-ht crus of the diaphragm, semilunar ganglion, vena ports; and cava, crossing likewise the azygos and thoracic duct, between the crus and aorta; inferiorly, upper margin of pancreas; and superiorly, lobulus Spigelii and foraraen of Win slow. Second Stage.—Between the layers of the lesser omen- tum to the left side of the duct, and in front of the porta. Anomalies.—It may arise separately from the aorta, or from the superior mesenteric, and the left frequently from the coronary. Collateral Branches—Superior pyloric, gastro- duodenalis, and cystic. Superior Pyloric—Generally small; mayarise before or after, and sometimes from the gastro-duodenalis; it curves downwards and backwards, between the layers of the lesser omentum, and anastomoses with the coronary Gastro-duodenalis.—Very large, arising from the angle of division between the transverse and vertical stages of the hepatic, and divides at the upper edge of the pancreas into gastro-epiploica dextra and pancrea- tico-duodenalis. Relations.—ATvtQTior^j, superior transverse portion of duodenum; posteriorly, right crus and vena portee; and to the right side, ductus communis choledochus.

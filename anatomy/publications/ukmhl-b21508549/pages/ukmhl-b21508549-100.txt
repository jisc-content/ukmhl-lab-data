THE OSSEOUS SYSTEM. 90 until it terminates in a mammillary tubercleâ€”the mas- toid process; superiorly it affords attachment to the occipito-frontalis, a little lower to the sterno-cleido mastoid; lower still to the splenius capitis, and anterior to these, to the ratrahens aurem; towards its posterior edge, but superiorly, is a small hole for the emunctory vessel of Santorini, communicating externally with the occipital vein, and internally with the lateral sinus. On the inferior part, and directly internal to the mas- toid process, is a deep furrow, called the digastric fossa, for tlae origin of the muscle of the same name; it is di- rected backwards and outwards, and internal to it is a much shallower groove for the occipital artery; conti- nuous with it in front, but separated from it posteriorly by a crest of bone, slightly elevated for the insertion of the trachelo-mastoideus. If we now turn to the internal surface, we will find it to be limited in front by the base of the petrous portion, which likewise forms the ante- rior boundary of a deep curved groove, corresponding to the lateral sinus. Behind this is a small oval portion, uneven, long from above downwards, forming the ex- ternal boundary for the fossa, for the reception of the lobes of the cerebellum. The petrous portion of the bone, so termed from its stony hardness, is prismatic in shape; its base, which is cut off very obliquely, and turned backwards and out- wards, corresponds to the union of the squamous and mastoid portions; its apex, turned forwards and in- wards, truncated, rough internally, perforated exter- nally for the termination of the carotid canal, is wedged in between the posterior part of the great wing of the sphenoid and the basilar process of the occipital, forming the posterior boundary of the anterior lacerated foramen already described with the latter bone. In examining it we will give it a superior, an internal, and inferior sur- face, separated from each other by three margins: a superior internal, an inferior internal, and a superior external. The superior surface is separated from the squamous portion anteriorly by the slight wavy fissure already alluded to, but behind it is completely blended with it; marked with alternating elevations and de-^ pressions, posteriorly and externally, we observe one oi

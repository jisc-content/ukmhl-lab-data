LIGAMENTS OF THE SPINE. 153 pposterior portion of the section which has been already nmade to expose the posterior common ligament of the f spine ■vvill enable us to obtain an excellent view of them; tthey consist of thick masses of ligamentous tissue, 5 stretching between the corresponding laminas, consist- iing of fibres closely packed together, converging and raneeting at an angle posteriorly, so as completely to fill mp the intervals left between the adjoining vertebra; ttheir attachment, however, to the laminse is peculiar, t'for while they spring from the upper edge of the one tbelow, they are prolonged anteriorly on the bevilled ssurface of the one above, thus increasing their length, aand conferring a high degree of smoothness and regula- rrity on the internal part of the spinal canal. They vwill be found, however, to vary in strength in the sseveral regions of the spine, being exceedingly strong iin the lumbar and dorsal, btit weak and much deeper ifrom above downwards, in the cervical. Their elasti- ocity is very remarkable, and as an adjuvant to themus- ccles of extension they must be of the greatest import- iance. The form of Articulation of the spine is amphiar- tthrosis, with one single exception existing between the ooblique processes, which is arthrodia; it possesses all the Emotions,—rotation, circumduction, flexion, extension, aand lateral inclination. The first of these, or rotation, fscarcely deserves this name, as it is rather a movement of ttorsion of the intervertebral disc; it is extremely limited tbetween any two contiguous vertebrae, but when dilFused aamongst several it can be carried to a considerable ex- ttent. Circumduction is, however, much more exten- ' sive; in this motion the apex of the cone is at the upper [part of the sacrum, and the base formed by the superior Lparts of the body. The amount of flexion is apparently vvery great, but if we except the cervical region, it is rreally very limited, for the curvature which is generally aascribed to the spinal region truly depends upon the hbending forwards of the body at the coxo-femoral arti- cculation. Extension is likewise circumscribed by the pprotrusion backwards of the spinous process, and the ppeculiar manner in which they overlap each other in tthe dorsal vertebrae precludes it altogether in this

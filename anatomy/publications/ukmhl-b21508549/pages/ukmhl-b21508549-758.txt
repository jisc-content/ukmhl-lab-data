748 NERVOUS SYSTEM. terior elastic cornea is situated, and is thus described by Professor Jacob:—The structure here alluded to is a firm, elastic, exquisitely transparent membrane, exactly applied to the inner surface of the cornea pro- per, and separating it from the aqueous humour V\ hen the eye has been macerated for a week or ten days in water by which the cornea is rendered completely opaque, this membrane retains its perfect transparency, it also retains its transparency after long-continued im- mersion in alcohol, or even boiling water. When de- tached it curls up and does not fall flaccid or float loosely in water, as other delicate membranes; it also presents a peculiar sparkling appearance in water, depending on its greater refractive power; in fact, it presents all the characters of cartilage, and is evidently of the same na- ture as the capsule of the crystalline lens. —(Article, Eye, in Todd's Encyclopedia, p. 179-) When sloughmg or ulceration extends so deep as to reach this membrane, a pellucid prominence presses forwards into the opening; and when an opacity results after puncture it resembles in appearance capsular cataract; but its structure is very different from cartilage, being composed of elastic tissue with scarcely a visible character, not affected by acids as the ordinary fibrous tissues; the use of this layer being to preserve the requisite concavity of the po'sterior Lface of the cornea. The cornea becomes opaque if the globe is subjected to compression, and this has been attributed to the expression of the fluid ou of its areolar structure, and again to an oPP^f Jj^"; namely, the expression of a larger — ^/f.-^/^^^ the anterior chamber into its areola; but if a small lamina raised by a needle is subjected to pressure it rewise becomes opaque, proving that the opacity de- pends on a derangement of its intimate structure The Membrane of the Veous humour, which lines its pos- Srior aspect is merely epithelial in its character.

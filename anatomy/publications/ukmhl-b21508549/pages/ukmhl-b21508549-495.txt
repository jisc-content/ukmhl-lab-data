485 MUSCLES OF THE FOOT. and inwards, crossing beneath the tendons of the exten- sor digitorum and pollicis at an acute angle, at the first phalanx each lying to the outer side of the correspond- ing long tendon, that which is destined for the great toe being the larger; they then become united with the long tendons, expand, and are inserted into the dorsal surface of the phalanges. Relations—It lies on the tarsal bones and phalanges, the internal tendon crossing the dorsalis pedis artery, and it is covered by the long extensor tendons, while a large branch of the anterior tibial nerve passes throuffh the muscle. ° Action.—To extend the toes, and keep the tarsal bones in close apposition. The integument on the sole of the foot has been al- ready examined, and on removing this covering and the cushion of fat lying beneath it, the os calcis and promi- nent points of the first and fifth metatarsal bones and plantar fascia aie exposed, the last consisting of three portions,—the middle, triangular in figure, being the strongest; the external, of mediate strength; and the in- ternal, which lies on a plain superior, is the weakest. Middle Portion of Plantar Fascia Triangular, apex behind, base anteriorly; it arises thick and round from the inferior part of the os calcis, passes forwards, ex- panding, and at the metatarso-phalangeal articulations it divides into four, sometimes five slips; these again subdi- vide, arching over the flexor tendons, to be attached to the lateral ligaments of the joints before mentioned; trans- verse bands passing across the sulci between the toes, and forming an osteo-fibrous arch for the transmission of the tendons of the lumbricales, with the digital nerves and vessels; the anterior, or curved margin of each sub- division being continuous with the sheaths of the flexor tendons on the four outer toes. The fibres of this layer run forwards, but anteriorly the slips are connected by cross bands, which can frequently be raised as a distinct structure. External Division arises posteriorly from the os calcis and sheath of the peronaji; it passes forwards, one portion being connected to the projecting point of the fifth metatarsal bone, the second much weaker, be-

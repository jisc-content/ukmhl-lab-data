PENIS. 413 Relations.—In the perineum each crus is covered by the skin, two layers of fascia, erector penis, and ante- rior fibres of the accelerator urinee; it lies on the bone and termination of the pudic artery, and in the penis they have the common coverings of that organ, and are compressed towards each other, so that each wants one- fourth of being a perfect cylinder. In the groove be- neath is placed the corpus spongiosum urethrae; and in that on the dorsum, the dorsal vein, but not the artery, and hence the appearance of a section is not inaptly compared to a double-barrelled gun. Structure oftlu Corpus Cavernosum.—If a transverse section is made of the penis, it will be seen that a dense tunic of fibrous tissue surrounds the internal vascular structure, stronger inferiorly than superiorly, the fibres being principally longitudinal, and sometimes presenting a reddish tinge in the neighbourhood of the pubis. Now let a stream of water play on the section, and then draAv Its margins apart; the fibrous tunic is thick where the urethra is lodged, and from this point numerous glis- tening fibres (trabecule) radiate, to be attached to all points of the internal surface of the cylinder in order to limit distention. Make a second cut with a pair of scissors on one side of the middle line longitudinally; wash the part so as to remove the blood. This exhibits the— Septum Pectiniforme—A structure forming a verti - cahmperfectpartitionbetween thecrura, extending from the pubis to the extremity of those bodies, and consisting ot bands, with intervals between them more or less large but not of equal size. The bands are always more complete behind than before, and thicker above than be- low; and by careful manipulation we have been able to demonstrate that the septum is double, each crus contributing the bands for its own side: its use is to prevent over-distention of the urethral portion of the crura; also to allow a free communication between the cavernous structure of opposite sides. Questionable Muscular Fibres—Professor Muller has seen bundles of pale red fibres between the anastomo- sing vems, frequently connected by cross filaments itiese, he observes, when examined microscopically, do

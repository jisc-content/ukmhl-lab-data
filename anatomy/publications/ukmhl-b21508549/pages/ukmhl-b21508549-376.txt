366 THE MUSCULAR SYSTEM. the spines it is first diminished in width, but again somewhat expands; a line drawn downwards from the cartilage of the eighth rib to the iliac spine would in- dicate the external edge. The fibres which form the tendon take an obliqiie course downwards, forwards, and inwards, arranged in fasciculated bands, but inferiorly as the pubis is approached these are more or less se- parated, leaving an important opening in this situation at the pubis, the fibres being inserted in three ways on the anterior surface of the symphisis; the decussating being continued down to the fascia, covering the adduc- tor longus tendon; a second flat band glides downwards over the symphisis and spine, does not decussate, but is attached to the pubic portion of fascia lata; the third are deep, decussate with each other, and are inserted into the crest and linea ileo-pectinea, forming the liga- ment of Mr. Colles. Relations. This muscle is subcutaneous, and lies on the internal oblique, rectus, pyramidalis, and intercos- tals, the posterior edge forms the anterior boundary of a triangular space, in which the internal oblique is seen, also the last dorsal nerve and internal circumflex ilii branches, but it frequently occurs that the latissi- mus dorsi wholly covers this space, and even in some cases overlaps the external oblique. Action. To compress the abdominal viscera, stimulat- ing the perisaltic action, and assisting in the expyilsion of urine and faaces; also to depress the ribs as in ex- piration ; to raise the pelvis in leaping, and likewise to rotate the body to the opposite side during the sittmg posture. On the dissected tendons of the last-described muscle there are many parts visible to which the student should next direct his attention; namely, linea alba and semilu- naris; also transversse, umbilicus, square openings for the passage of vessels, external abdominal ring, and Poupart's ligament. Linea Alba is formed by the union of the tendons ot opposite sides, and acts as a ligament connecting the ensi- form cartilage to the sternum; it is narrow below, wider above, but here weak and depressed, presenting several small apertures, through which portions ol fat may pro-

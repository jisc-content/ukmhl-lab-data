251 PAROTID GLAND. quill, an inch and a half in length, formed by the conflu- ence of the efferent tubes of the lobules, it passes forwards over the tendinous portion of the masseter, half-an-inch below the zygoma; at the buccinator it becomes involved in a quantity of fat, in which it dips backwards, pierces the superior posterior angle of that muscle directly, then passes betAveen the muscular fibres and the mucous membrane of the mouth for some distance, and perfo- rates the latter also, directly opposite the second superior molar tooth, below the reflection of the mucous mem- brane from the cheek to the gums; this duct, imme- diately after its origin, perforates the fascial capsule, a process of which is prolonged on its surface; beneath this a dense fibrous layer, of a white and glistening ap- pearance, preserves the figure and gives resistance to the tube; internally it is lined by a pale mucous mem- brane, continuous with that of the mouth; surrounding the duct, just as it pierces the buccinator, are from three to five small granular bodies, communicating with its cavity by short eff"erent tubes; it is difiicult to say whether these are naked buccal glands, or are the earliest developed portion of the parotid; deeper than these the duct loses its fibrous coat, and is then merely a mucous tubule to its termination; above the duct a distinct portion of glandular structure is sometimes pre- sent, named socia parotidis,â€”its ducts communicate with that of Steno, and never open separately into the mouth; it appears to us as a subsequent development of the gland, as we never could succeed in detecting its existence in the foetus or infant; above the duct the transverse facial ar- tery and vein, with the socia parotidis, when it exists, and the temporo-fascial branches of the portio dura nerve, are found, and it is covered by integument, platysma, fascia, fat, and the zygomaticus major muscle. Now make a transverse section through it; the coats appear of great thickness, the central cavity wonderfully small, so much so that we have sometimes experienced great difficulty when trying to introduce the pipe of a mercurial appa- ratus into its orifice at the anterior edge of the masse- ter ; it is requisite to be acquainted with the direction of the duct, and after many observations and compari- sons of the several methods which have been suggested,

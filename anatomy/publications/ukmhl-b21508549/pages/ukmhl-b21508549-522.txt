512 CAVITY OF THE CHEST. terior and inferior surface, resting on the cordiform ten- don of the diaphragm, is flat, and also divided by a con- tinuation of the median furrow, but here the formative relations are reversed, the left ventricle constituting three-fourths of its extent, and the right the remainder. The right edge is thin and sharp, convex superiorly, straight inferiorly, resting on the diaphragm; the left is exceedingly thick, round, and convex, being almost perpendicular, and resting in a concavity of the_ left lung, of course with the intervention of the pericardium. The third surface corresponds to the base of the ventri- cular portion of the heart, looks upwards, backwards, and towards the right side, surrounded by a furrow which marks the limit between the auricles and ventri- cles ; this furrow contains some fat with the coronary vessels, producing a deceptive appearance as to depth; but by removing the fat the muscular fibres of the ven- tricles are seen to turn inwards as far as the auricular tendinous rings, an arrangement more obvious poste- riorly than anteriorly. Attached to the base of the ven- tricles are two vessels and two cavities; of the former the pulmonary arterial zone is most anterior, the aortic posterior and a little to the left side, whilst the auricu- lar rings occupy a still more posterior plane, and are moulded on the back part and sides of the aortic. Ihe base of the ventricles present an oblique plane, being cut off from above, downwards, and backwards, so that the anterior surface of the heart exceeds the posterior in length by nearly an inch and a quarter; but although this disparity exists in the surfaces, we will find here- after that both ventricles are nearly of equal extent in the vertical direction. The student should now exa- mine the configuration of the auricular portion oi the orcran. These two cavities are situated on the back part of the ventricular base, and are of an hour-g ass figure, the anterior surface being prominent on each side, but excavated in the centre, where it corresponds to the Dosterior part of the aorta and pulmonary artery, while on each side it presents the right and left auricular ap- pendices-long, narrow, muscular cylinders serrated L thSr margins, curved forwards on the right side, but situated mo?e posteriorly on the left, the former rest-

NERVOUS SYSTEM. 678 the vertical and horizontal semicircular canals; the se- cond supplies the saccule; and the third, which is the smallest, is distributed to the ampulla of the oblique semicircular canal. The latter, or cochlear nerve pierces the intundibuliform canal at the inner extremity of the modiolus, and gives off lateral branches which perforate the walls of the canal, and pursuing a spiral course are distributed to the lamina spiralis. The portio mollis is extremely soft, and its neurilemma is so fine that the trunk is easily divided into fascicles, with a remarkable tendency to become varicose, in fact, seeming to be a continuation of the substance of the brain. As to its ultimate distribution much diiFerence of opinion pre- vails, analogy appearing to imply a looped arrangement, but observation has determined a primary plexiform interlacement with ultimate free points. (Todd and Bowman, pp. 83, 84.) Course and Termination of the Portio Dura.—At the inner extremity of the auditory meatus the nerve enters the aqueductusFallopii, passing at first outwards, and then bending backwards, running through the sub- stance of the inner wall of the tympanum, superior to the fenestra ovalis, and then turning downwards escapes by the stylo-mastoid foramen, whilst at the posterior wall of the tympanum it presents an enlargement (in- tumescentia gangliformis), with which the Vidian uerve is connected, and immediately previous to its escape from the bone it receives a communicating branch from the pneuraogastric (auricular nerve of Arnold). After its emergence from the stylo-mastoid foramen, it passes for- wards in the substance of the parotid gland for about half-an-inch, and then divides into temporo-facial and cervico-facial branches, and these, uniting frequently by cross branches, constitute the parotidean plexus or pes Anseriuus. Cervico-facial.—Exceedingly large, passes upwards and forwards, forming a concavity which is directed up- wards, and crossing the neck of the lower jaw, and re- ceiving a branch of communication from the temporo- auricular nerve, divides into temporal, orbital, and in- fra-orbital buccal branches, which frequently anastomose with each other, forming arches, with their convexities

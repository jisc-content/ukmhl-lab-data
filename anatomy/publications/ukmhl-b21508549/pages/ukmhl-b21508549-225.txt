215 SECTION III. MUSCULAE SYSTEM. Muscles constitute the active agents of locomotion; they are stretched from bone to bone in the extremities which they surround, enveloping also cavities; pro- ducing the requisite change in the inclosed organs by their contractions, and again investing the hollow vis- cera, they urge their contents towards the natural outlets. A muscle is an aggregation of a peculiar fibrous ele- ment united by areolar tissue, and usually (at least in one class) presenting a tendon or an expanded aponeurosis at either extremity, by which it is connected to the bones. In their vital properties they exhibit contrac- tility and sensibility; the physical being, elasticity, re- sistance, and pliability; the colour may be red or pale; and in shape exhibiting an infinite variety, as, thick, round, or fusiform; flat and expanded; penniform; or bipenniform arrangement of their fibres. The nomen- clature is derived, first, from their position, as brachialis anticus; secondly, from direction, as, obliquus externus rectus, &c.; thirdly, from shape, as, rhomboideus, sca- lenus ; fourthly, from action, as, pronator teres, supi- nator longus; fifthly, from structure, as, digastric; and, lastly, from attachment, as, the sterno-hyoid and thyroid. The muscular system is divided into the animal, vo- luntary or striped, and the organic, involuntary or un- striped. The former is usually arranged in a thick, round mass, of a deep red colour; has tendon in its composition, with bony attachments placed external to the skeleton; voluntary in action, supplied by the cerebro-spinal system of nerves, and composed of fibres visibly striped in a transverse direction. The latter is thin and pale, surrounds internal viscera, destitute of tendon or bony attachment; involuntary, supplied by

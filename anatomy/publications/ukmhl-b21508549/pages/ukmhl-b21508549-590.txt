580 CAVITY OF THE ABDOMEN. on the head; their superior extremity, truncated is in contact on the right side with the liver, and on the lett with the spleen, and to these they are usually attached by condensed areolar tissue; they are likewise over- lapped by those organs, while they rest on the crura oi the diaphragm and semilunar ganglia, the latter lying slightly internal to them, and freely supplying them with larce and numerous hlaments. In addition to a thin fibrous membrane analogous to that of the kidney, which forms its outer envelope, these bodies are composed of two distinct structures,_an ex- ternal or cortical, and an internal or medullary. Ihe first is of a yellowish colour, consisting of a series ol fibres arranged parallel to each other, formed both by the arteries, by which it is very copiously supphed, as well as by c^cal tubules of basement membrane, which are found on examination to contain cell germs and fat cells in various stages of development. 1 he medullary tissue is principally constituted by a dilated venous plexus, which receives the blood from the arterial branches already alluded to, and a quantity of minute cavTties, containing a reddish, gray fluid; while these are bound together by a proper parenchyma, m which are interspersed an abundance of cells displaying dif- ferent degrees of maturity. With respect o the cavxty which is°said to occupy its centre, care ul observation has rendered the fact of its existence extremely doubt- fu aTd t appears to be truly the result of rough ma- niulation, breaking down the delicate erectile tissue of which its interior is principally composed. In the foetus the suprarenal capsules are relatively xnuch larger than in the adult; they are ful y apparen dm^ng the second month of mtra-uterine life, and t tl^s ptriod exceed the kidney both m size and weight, : !L this a change ensues, the latter while the former remains stationaiT, so ^ t^^^^^Yt is nnP is three or f^ur times larger than the other, it is ?rom t e fbregoing facts that the older physiologists hZ a sumed'the idea that these organs are in some nave asbuiuL,.^ urinary secretion du- ■..ro,r nr otlii^r connected witn rue uiuiuij 7Z the tul condition.

259 MUSCLES OF THE NECK. the angles of the notch, in the superior costa of the sca- : pula, also from the ligament of the notch, on which its : fibres are sometimes prolonged to the base of the coracoid • process; it soon becomes fleshy and ascends obliquely ; forwards and inwards; beneath the sterno-mastoid it forms a narrow silvery tendon, and emerging from under that muscle, becomes again fleshy, then ascending almost vertically along the outer border of the sterno- hyoid, it is inserted into the lower part of the body and cornu of the os hyoides. Relations.—Its origin is between the supraspinatus externally, and the serratus magnus internally; it crosses the posterior scalenus, brachial plexus, anterior scalenus, phrenic nerve, transversalis colli and cervicalis ascendens arteries, omo-hyoid plexus, carotid artery, jugular vein, pneumogastric and sympathetic, thyroid body, siiperior thyroid artery, and superior laryngeal nerve; it is covered by the trapezius; anterior to this by the fascia and external jugular vein, sterno-mastoid muscle; and lastly, by the anterior jxigular, when that vein exists; the suprascapular nerve runs along the upper edge of the posterior belly; the subclavian ar- tery and vein below it; the anterior belly has internal to it the sterno-hyoid, and externally the common and external carotid arteries. The tendon of this muscle is absent in the foetus and infant, and gradually increases until the twenty-fourth year. Action.—To make tense the cervical fascia; as an ele- vator of the shoulder, its action is slight; it also draws downwards and backwards the os hyoides, thus acting on the larynx and pharynx in deglutition, a function vfith which it is connected through the descendens noni nerve of the ninth. Sterno-htoid—Flat and narrow, placed at one side of the mesian line; arises, tendinous and fleshy, from the posterior surface of the first bone of the sternum, ster- nal end of the clavicle, posterior sterno-clavicular liga- ment, and the cartilage of the first rib at its posterior aspect; ascends obliquely outwards, and is inserted into the lower edge of the body of the os hyoides, internal to the omo-hyoid. Relations.—It is covered by the sternum, fascia, and

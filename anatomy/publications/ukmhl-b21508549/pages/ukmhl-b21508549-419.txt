PENIS. 409 fat wliich occupies the ischio-rectal fossa, and the ex- ternal hemorrhoidal arteries and veins; the coccyo-eal fibres have, to their posterior and external surface, 'the coccygeus muscle, and a special branch of the sacral plexus supplies each muscle, the arteries being derived from the hemorrhoidal and sacral. Action—To close the outlet of the pelvis, to support Its contents, to assist in closing the rectum, and eleva- ting it_ after it has been depressed by the action of the abdominal muscles in defecation; also to constrict and raise the vaginal orifice, which it surrounds in the female, to raise the prostate, and compress it during micturi- tion, and to force the seminal secretion into the bulb of the urethra. Coccygeus, or Ischio-coccygeus, lies external and posterior to the last muscle; arises tendinous from the internal surface of the spine of the ischium ; passes backwards and inwards, and is inserted broad and ten- dinous into the side of the coccyx and extremity of the sacrum. Relations—It corresponds, by its internal and ante- rior surface, to the levator ani, externally and posteriorly to the lesser sacro-sciatic ligament. Action.—To support and raise the coccyx, and thus preserve the position of the rectum and uterus, with the vagina. P£Nis._This organ, in its collapsed condition, is cy- lindrical, and when distended, prismatic, the margins bemg formed below by the urethra, and on each side by the crura. The principal bulk of the organ is formed by the crura and corpus spongiosum urethra; and in addition, there are several superficial investments which require individual examination. The skin is fine and delicate, of a brownish colour, especially on the inferior surface, very moveable, and, tracing this investment for- wards to the corona glandis, it becomes free, and forms the prepuce by a replication or folding on itself; at the corona and glans it adheres very intimately to the sub jacent structures—in the former, on account of its pro longations into a series of follicles (glandule Tysoni or odoriferffi), which surrounds the corona, and secretes a viscid semifluid matter, the precise use of which is not

BRANCHES OP INTERNAL ILIAC. 845 and a half or to its point of origin or termination, which may be either above or below the situation indi- Collateral Branches.â€”These are classed into those within and those without the pelvis, the former bein<^ hve in number, viz.: ilio-lumbar, middle hcemorrhoidaL lateral sacral, vesical, and umbilical, with the uterine and vaginal in the female, while the latter are four viz glutasal, obturator, sciatic, and pudic. ' Ilio-lumbar. Usually a large branch, arising from the outer and back part of the internal iliac; it passes upwards, outwards, and backwards, and terminates in three branches, one of which ascends under the psoas to anastomose with the lumbar; the second runs outwards to the posterior part of the crest of the ilium, and across tlie liiac fossa, either under or over or throucrh the iliacus internus, to communicate with the gluteal and internal circumflex ilii; whilst the third passes down- wards and outwards, close to the bone, to which it sends a large branch, and at the anterior superior spinous process anastomoses with the circumflex branches of the temoral, external iliac, and profunda Relations of Ilio-lumbar Trunk.~Anteriorly, external Iliac artery and vein, obturator and anterior crural nerve, and psoas muscle; posteriorly, ilio-sacral sym- tlt:^obtur'ator'""^"^ "'"^^ -P-tesfiom Middle ILemorrhoidal arises from the front of the internal ihac, and, passing downwards and forwards be- low the recto-vesical fold of peritoneum, reaches the sides of the rectum and divides into numerous long branches for the supply of that gut, anastomosing with the superior hemorrhoidal from the inferior mesenteric, and the inferior from the pudic. VESiCAL._Generally three in number, and are termed the posterior, anterior, and superior. The first is usually a branch from the middle ha^morrhoidal, which run^ at first dowr. wards and forwards to the entrance of the ureter, arid then ascends on the lateral regions of the viscus; the second is given off by the internal iliac Itself, and It passes forwards along the inferior Ibndus of the bladder, supplying it and the commencem nt o '

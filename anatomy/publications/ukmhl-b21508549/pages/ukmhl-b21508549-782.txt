772 SECTION VI. AETEEIES AND VEINS. The vessels of the body are divided into the arteries, veins and lymphatics, but the two former wHl only be described in the present section. The arteries are elas- tic, yielding, membranous tubes, commencing by the great systemic vessel,—aorta, which, breaking up into branches, ultimately terminates in the capillaries or the connecting link between the arteries and veins. These vessels are usually found empty after death, but pre- sent sufficient resistance, even in that condition, to maintain their cylindrical form. Commencing by trunks, they divide dichotomously as a general rule, and the combined area of the branches (with the one exception of the basilar) exceeds that of the trunks from which they emanate; the arterial system would, therefore, represent a cone with its apex situated at the root ot the aorta, and its base at the capillaries. The arteries are usually described as having three coats,—an external or areolo-fibrous, a middle or elastic, and an internal or serous; but these are further subdivided into addi- tional layers, of which six have been enumerated, and will be presently described. Areolo-fibrous coat con- sists of an investing tubule of condensed or membram- form areolar tissue, moulded by its deep surface, which is dense on the middle coat, whilst externally, more lax, it connects the vessel to the surrounding parts, the fibres which constitute it being either spiral longi- tudinal or interlacing in their direction, and althougti merely consisting of the elements of ordinary areolar tissue, still the elastic fibres almost invariably predo- minate, in fact, becoming continuous with the middle coat. This tunic is the most resisting constituent ot an artery, and it is observed that, after the internal and middle give way in aneurism, that it supports the im-

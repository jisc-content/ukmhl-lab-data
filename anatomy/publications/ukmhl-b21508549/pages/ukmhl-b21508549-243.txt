233 LACHRYMAL APPARATUS. side; the terminations near the orbital margin of the cartilage may also be coecal; this arrangement is the most frequent. From the sides smaller tubes pass off, that also subdivide, and ultimately terminate in grape- like bunches of coecal extremities; these secrete a resi- nous fluid, that prevents the escape of the lachrymal se- cretion over the edges of the lids; small, straight, but in diseased conditions, tortuous vessels are seen running to- wards the base of each follicle, from which small branches are continued to the orifice, where a circular anasto- mosis is formed; in scrofulous children, where the lids are thin, these follicles may be often observed through the skin and tarsal cartilage; at the internal sixth of the lid the orifices no longer appear visible, and at this point are situated the puncta lachrymalia,—two in num- ber, one above and one below, represented by annular projections, with a foramen in the centre, looking back- wards; these are certainly in the substance of the tar- sal cartilage. Now introduce a pin curved, with its con- cavity directed upwards, into the inferior punctum; press it inwards towards the nasal process of the supe- rior maxillary bone; this will show the direction of the lachrymal canals, which are two in number, and lead from the punctal orifices to the outer side of the lachry- mal sac; each canal is curved, the concavities turned towards each other, and consists of a tubule of mucous membrane, surrounded by a sheath from the reflected layer of the tendo oculi. We have observed that they as frequently open into the sac distinctly as by a com- mon orifice; they are related posteriorly to Horner's muscle and conjunctiva, anteriorly to the tendo oculi and orbicularis muscle. Raise the tendo oculi from its attachment to the superior maxillary bone, and reflect it outwards. Obtain a dry skull for the examination of the lachrymal sulcus, which will assist the student in acquiring a correct idea of the relations of the most important of the appendages of the eye. Lachrymal Sac.—Oval, about three-quarters of an inch in length, consists of two portions,—the osseous sulcus, in which it is lodged, and the membranous saccule. Osseous portion, a semi-ovoid depression formed by the grooved posterior edge of the superior maxil- lary and the anterior half of the lachrymal bone;

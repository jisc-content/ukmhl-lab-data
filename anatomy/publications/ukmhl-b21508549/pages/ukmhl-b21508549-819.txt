809 BRANCHES OF SUBCLAVIAN. : also a common trunk on the left side, from whicli the two subclavians may spring, or where it arises from the 1 left angle the right usually passes to its own side, be- 1 hind the oesophagus and trachea, but sometimes between ; these two tubes, as we had an opportunity of observing ^ about six years ago in an aged female subject, and in 1 this case the vessel was of a more than ordinary size. • Generally speaking, the left subclavian is very regular iin its origin, but exceptions occasionally occur, where it i forms a common trunk with the right or left carotid, ithe latter being the more frequent arrangement. Collateral Branches.—These are, in its first stage, tthe vertebral, internal mammary, and thyroid axis; and lin its second, the superior intercostal and cervicalis pro- ifunda; in its third it normally gives off no branch. Vertebral arises from the upper and back part of ithe subclavian, and, ascending backwards and upwards, centers the foramen in the transverse process of the sixth ''cervical vertebra, and through the others in succession, rtill it reaches the axis, where it suddenly curves upr i-wards, backwards, and outwards, to pass through the ^elongated transverse process of the atlas, on reaching ithe upper surface of which, it bends backwards and in- wards to the triangular space on the back of the neck, ;iand here again changing its direction, it runs upwards, ['forwards, and inwards, perforating the posterior occipi- tto-atlantoid ligament and dura mater, and thus getting \withm the cranial cavity, approximates to its fellow, with which it unites at the lower part of the pons va- i :oIii to form the basilar trunk. Relations—Immediately after its origin it lies in a !r,riangular space, having internal to it the longus colli • ind pneumogastric nerve; externally, anterior scalenus imd phrenic; inferiorly, its own parent trunk; ante- ■luorly, mternal jugular vein and inferior thyroid artery; )OSteriorly,transverse process of seventh cervical verte- ■ttra, and a lymphatic gland; and internally and ante- uorly, mferior cervical ganglion of sympathetic. As it ontmues its course upwards through the foramina iu he transverse processes, it has anterior and posterior to U the intertransversalis muscles, the cervical nerves "merge behind it, and it is invested by a plexus from these ind the inferior ganglion of the sympathetic, whilst one

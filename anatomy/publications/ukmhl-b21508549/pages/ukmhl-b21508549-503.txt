493 LUNGS. membrane. The pulmonary portion is fine, smooth, and perfectly transparent in the child, but often much thickened in old subjects, exhibiting laminated scales of bone in some situations. It is believed that the sub- pleural fibrous layer is absent, but of this we will speak presently. The Lungs are symmetrical organs, communicating only through the medium of the bronchial tubes, each being somewhat conical in figure, presenting an apex and base, two margins, and two surfaces. The apex, di- rected upwards, lies superiorly between the scaleni mus- cles, extending higher on the right side than on the left; an horizontal constriction, corresponding to the inner margin of the first rib, limits below the extrathoracic portion; the base is concave and triangular, and rests on the diaphragm; the anterior margin, thick above, thin and interrupted below, overlaps the pericardium, corres- ponding to the anterior mediastinum; that on the right side presenting two grooves and a similar number of notches; commencing at the apex, there is first an oblique groove for the descending cava; this is directed inwards and downwards; secondly, an excavation for the pro- minence of the right auricle; and lastly, the anterior extremities of the greater and lesser pulmonary fissures; the left anterior edge is interrupted from above down- wards, first near the apex by a groove for the left sub- clavian artery, sometimes enlarged to accommodate the descending curve of the aorta; secondly, a wide notch for the apex of the heart; and lastly, immediately above the base, the anterior termination of the great pulmo- nary fissures. The posterior thick margin lies on the sulcus, between the sides of the bodies of the vertebra and angles of the ribs, the left being sometimes grooved longitudmally for the descending aorta; the internal or concave surface corresponds to the pericardium and pos- terior mediastinum, also to the root of the orcran by which the vessels enter and leave, this being situated one-third from the apex, and two-thirds from the an- terior thin edge; the external surface, convex, corre- sponds to the concavities of the ribs and pleura; it is deeply marked by fissures dividing the lung into lobes- the great pulmonary fissure runs downwards, forwards'

672 NERVOUS SYSTEM. wards, the superior communicates with the anterior dental, and the inferior with that above it, close to the canine fossa. From their inferior surface a number of branches arise, which form an intricate interlacement in the diploe, from this branches being sent into the neural apertures in the fangs of the molar and bicuspid teeth; but it does not appear that all the plexus is consumed by the dental branches, many being lost on the diploic cancellous walls of the bone. Anterior Dental.—An exceedingly large branch, arising from the infra-orbital, near the facial extremity of the canal, enters a special channel, passing at first inwards, then downwards, separated from the antrum and its lining membrane by a thin osseous plate, and having arrived at the root of the nasal process, it divides into a number of branches, some of which remain in the bone, whilst the greater number supply the incisor, canine, and first bicuspid teeth; from the outer side of the trunk a small filament passes to communicate with the posterior superior dental branch. Inferior Maxillary Nerve, or. Third Division of the Fifth, of which it is the largest branch, arises from the posterior inferior angle of the ganglion, then passes downwards, forwards, and outwards, and, escaping from the cranium by the foramen ovale, reaches the zygoma- tic fossa. In this course the hard root of the fifth lies beneath it, at the foramen ovale posterior to it, and m the fossa first lying external, then wmdmg to its fore- part, where they become intimately united; but prior to this union they can easily be distinguished, one being rrrey and plexiform, the other white and distinctly fibrous; the former giving off the sensitive branches, the latter those which are traced to the muscles of mas- tication. Whilst in the zygomatic fossa the inferior max- illary nerve has thefollowing relations:—Anteriorly the posterior edge of the internal pterygoid and the tensor Llati muscles; posteriorly the middle meningeal artery and origin of the internal lateral ligament ot the lower iaw; externally the external pterygoid; and mternally, otic ganglion ami Eustachian tube. It here divides into two sets of branches,-external and mternal, the former

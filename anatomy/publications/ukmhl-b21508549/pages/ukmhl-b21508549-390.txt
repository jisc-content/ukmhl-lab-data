380 THE MUSCULAR SYSTEM. non-development of the horizontal rami of the pubis; but as life advances, the internal ring moves outwards, coincident with the development of that bone. In the female, the canal is proportionately increased, owing to the width of the pelvis, so remarkable a characteristic of that sex. Now turn to the opposite side, which has been dissected, and observe that on the removal of the mus- cles, the peritoneum is covered by a strong fibrous mem- brane, first described by Sir A. Cooper as the transversalis fascia; the latter is attached to the inner lip of the crest of the ilium, to Poupart's ligament for its whole length, and then, meeting with the outer edge of the rectus ab- dominis, it becomes ultimately adherent to it, and is further continued on its posterior surface to become con- tinuous with the similar sheet of the opposite side. At the crest of the ilium it is connected with the iliac fas- cia, and this junction continues as far inwards as the external iliac artery, a whitish line parallel to Poupart's licrament marking their union with the formation of a canal for the transmission of the internal circumflex ilii artery and two accompanying veins; inferiorly this fas- cia is strong, but as it ascends it becomes much weaker, and at the diaphragm is confounded with the subperi- toneal areolar tissue. At Poupart's ligament, a process is sent downwards into the femoral region to form the anterior half of the sheath for the femoral vessels; a point midway between the anterior superior spinous â€¢ process of the ilium and the symphisis pubis, and three- quarters of an inch above Poupart's ligament, will indi- cate the situation of the internal ring; not a defined aperture, even when examined on its deep or peritoneal surface. When the fascia transversahs is torn Irom the latter, the elements of the cord are seen diverging at an acute angle, the course of the vas deferens being in- wards and backwards, whilst the spermatic artery and vein ascend with a very slight degree of obliquity up- wards and inwards. At the site of the ring a mass of areolar tissue, occasionally fatty, and extending down- wards and backwards on the external ihac artery, indi- Tates the remains of that process of peritoneum which formed the tunica vaginalis, and when this is cautiously removed, the cord implies the situation of the internal

482 THE MUSCULAR SYSTEM. surface of the tibia; arises from that bone inferior and internal to the poplitaeal line, and continues to adhere to its posterior and internal surface for about six inches; also from the interosseous ligament and the intermuscu- lar septum, which separates it from the tibialis posti- cus- the fibres pass downwards and backwards, becom- ino-'attached to a tendon that lies in the centre of the muscle, producing a penniform arrangement of the fibres; the tendon now assumes a rounded form, stiil covered by a few fleshy fibres, then passes beneath the in- ternal annular ligament, buried in a groove on the back of the internal malleolus, in company with the tibialis posticus, but each possessing its separate fibrous sheath and bursal membrane; this sheath is continued into the plantar region, where the tendon runs forwards and outwards, lying beneath the flexor pollicis, to which it is connected by a fascia, sometimes by an obliquely de- fined tendinous slip; anterior to this the outer edge re- ceives the insertion of the musculus accessorius, and then divides into four tendons, which at the metacarpo- phalangeal articulations enter an osteo-fibrous canal, similai in structure and formation to that m the hand, and likewise containing the slips of the short flexor, both being surrounded by a distinct synovial saccule; and at the second phalanx the short flexor tendons are split, the long passing through them to be inserted into the posterior edge of the ungual or last phalanx; the short slips expanding on the bone, and again uniting, are inserted in the middle phalanx. _ Relations—It is covered by the deep fascia, posterior tibial vessels and nerves, annular ligament, and in the sole of the foot by the superficial layer of muscles and phalangeal sheaths; it lies on the tibia, interosseous iga- Sent tendon of tibialis posticus, interna lateral liga- ment; OS calcis, flexor pollicis tendon, third layer of plantar muscles, and phalanges.

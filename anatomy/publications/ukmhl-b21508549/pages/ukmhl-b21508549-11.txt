ANATOMY OF THE HUMAN BODY. SECTION 1. THE OSSEOUS SYSTEM. The term skeleton is applied to those denser elements of the animal tissues that, when combined as immove- able plates or jointed segments, constitute solid shields for the protection of the softer structures, or subserve to the active movements of animals, by supplying the passive organs for attachment of the muscular system. In all the invertebrate class, with the exception of the ce- phalopoda, the skeleton is found external to the muscles (exo-skeleton); but although many of the vertebrate class retain certain portions of the external skeleton in various grades of development, still its gradual extinc- tion is perceptible in proportion as increasing perfec- tion and symmetry prevail in the internal (endo-ske- leton). In many classes this perfection may be evi- denced only in reference to particular functions, sym- metry may be sacrificed to those arrangements confer- ring strength and solidity, or these again may yield to the mechanical requirements conducing to rapidity of motion, combined with excessive lightness. But whilst a continual change of the centres of increased develop- ment IS observed in the lower orders of vertebrata, producing physical characters in unison with the habits and necessities of the animal, the human skeleton exhi- bits a persistent form not constituted for the predo- B

THE ANATOMY OF THE JOINTS. 166 than the preceding, internal to whicla it lies. Exter- nally it is in relation with the greater sacro-sciatic and ramus coccygasus of the ischiatic artery. Internally it corresponds to the coccygseus muscle. Exclusive of their evident use to complete the infe- rior outlet of the pelvis, these ligaments must likewise confer on it a great amount of strength, from the mode in which they are stretched between two fixed points of it, connecting them like the stays of a chain bridge, without at the same time interfering with the im- portant parts that pass through the notches, which they circumscribe, and which have been already enumerated in the general description of the pelvis. OBTURATOR LIGAMENT. This must be exposed by removing carefully the two muscles of the same name, which are closely at- tached to it. Thin, but extremely strong and unyield- ing, and composed of fibres interlacing with each other, so as to give it a reticular appearance, it is attached posteriorly and externally to the outer edge of the ob- turator foramen, and anteriorly and internally to its posterior, thus completely filling it up, except supe- riorly, where an aperture is left oblique in its nature for the passage of the vessels and nerves. As we have already remarked, it is in contact by both its surfaces with the obturator muscles. SYMPHISIS PUBIS. This is an amphiarthrodial joint, possessing a slight degree of motion. It is formed by the two ossa pubis of opposite sides, but it is to be observed that they do not touch anteriorly, a broad interval existing between them in this direction, which in the natural state of the part is filled up by cartilage of a wedge-shape, with the base turned forwards, and closely adherent by its lateral surfaces to the opposite bones. In addition to this cartilage, we have the security of the joint fur- ther increased by an anterior and posterior, a superior and inferior ligament.

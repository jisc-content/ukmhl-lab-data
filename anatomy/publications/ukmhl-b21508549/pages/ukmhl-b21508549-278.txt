268 THE MUSCULAR SYSTEM. short tendon from the inferior genial eminence, soon becomes fleshy, passes downwards and backwards, and is inserted into the upper edge of the os hyoides. Relations It corresponds internally to its fellow, from which it is often with difficulty separated; exter- nally to the sublingual deep process of submaxillary gland, lingual and gustatory nerves, hyo-glossus, ra- nine artery, but some distance intervenes; below, to the mylo-hyoid, and above to the geuio-hyo-glossus. Action.—To elevate the os hyoides, and assist in the protrusion of the tongue. Hyo-glossus.—Oblong, flat, and fleshy, arises from the upper edge of the cornu of the os hyoides; its fibres pass upwards, backwards, and outwards, and are in- serted into the side of the tongue. Relations.—Externally and anteriorly it corresponds to the lingual nerve, hyo-glossal plexus, gustatory, with Whartonian duct, stylo-glossus, and sublingual gland, covered by the mylo-hyoid, stylo-hyoid, and digastric muscles; it lies on the lingual artery, which separates it from the middle constrictor and stylo-hyoid ligament, on the superior constrictor, mucous membrane, and ge- nio-hyo-glossus muscle. Action.—To elevate the os hyoides, and draw down the sides of the tongue, so as to cause a convexity of the dorsum of that organ. In order to expose fully the genio-hyo-glossus, saw through the jaw at its symphisis; draw the tongue from the mouth, and separate the muscles of opposite sides. Genio-hyo-glossus.—Triangular, arises narrow and tendinous from the middle genial eminence; the fibres diverge, the superior arching upwards and forwards to the point, the middle to the base of the tongue, and the inferior curving downwards and backwards, and are in- serted into the body of the os hyoides. Relations.—Internally it is in contact with its fellow, except immediately above the hyoid bone, where a nar- row triangular plate of cartilage, sometimes ligament, intervenes; a thin stratum of yellowish fatty tissue unites the two muscles, particularly below; externally it corresponds to the mylo-hyoid, hyo-glossus, and the inferior lingualis, the sublingual gland, the Wharto-

FEMORAL HERNIA. 439 canal, wtiich is bounded by flie cribriform fascia, and Hey's ligament in front; by the femoral vein and inter- nal septum crurale externally; by the pectineus muscle and pectineal portion of the fascia lata internally and posteriorly; it is prismatic, and about one inch and an eighth in length. If the finger is still pressed forwards, it will emerge at the saphenic opening, where the her- nia ultimately becomes superficial, an analogy existing between this space and the canal engaged in inguinal hernia, the femoral ring, the crural canal, and the sa- phenic opening representing the internal ring, inguinal canal, and the external abdominal ring. Now divide the superior cornu of the iliac portion of the fascia from Poupart's ligament, and reflect it outwards in order to examine the femoral sheath, which is a funnel-shaped tube, larger above than below, prolonged superiorly from the iliac and transverse fascise; it remains strong to the saphenic opening, but we have traced it as a dis- tinct structure to the middle of Hunter's canal, where it is lost in a strong adherent sheath which surrounds the vessels. Above, it contains three canals separated by two septa, sent backwards from the transverse fascia to join the iliac; the external containing the artery, the middle, which is much larger, the vein, and the internal, the smallest, giving passage to the deep lymphatics. The septum separating the venous and lymphatic canals is exceedingly strong, and that which divides the artery and vein is also well marked, particularly in old subjects where the former vessel is diseased. A transverse section of both artery and vein exhibits very well the arrange- ment of this structure, and it exists in the whole course of the vessels to the inferior part of Hunter's canal. The occurrence of a femoral hernia is prevented between the anterior spine of the ilium and the external iliac artery, by the junction of the iliac and transverse fasciee; it rarely occurs in front of the femoral vessels, owing to the upward reflection of Abernethy's fascia, and the mode in which these vessels are wedged beneath Pou - part's ligament; Gimbernaut's ligament obviates any protrusion internal to the ring, as a general rule, but it is necessary to be aware that hernial protrusions have occurred in the three situations alluded to; but these are

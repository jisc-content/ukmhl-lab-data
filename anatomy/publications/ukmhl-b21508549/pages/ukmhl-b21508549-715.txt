705 DORSAL NERVES. and posterior part of the fore-arm, as low down as the carpus. Circumflex Nerve.—This is a very large nerve, arising by a common trunk with the last described; it passes immediately backwards in company with the posterior circumflex artery through a quadrilateral space, boimded externally by the neck of the humerus; internally by the long head of the triceps; above by the capsule of the joint; and below by the conjoined tendons of the latis- simus dorsi and teres major, here occasionally throwing off twigs to the teres minor and subscapularis. Arriving now at the posterior part of the shoulder, it divides into two sets of branches,—cutaneous and muscular, the former piercing the fascia, and ramifying in all directions through the integument covering the deltoid, while the latter are distributed to the deep surface of that muscle, and can be traced as far as its insertion. DORSAL OR INTERCOSTAL NERVES. The dorsal nerves are twelve in number, and are found to decrease gradually in size from the first to the tenth, a slight increase being visible in the two last. In the description of their origin from the spinal mar- row we have already explained their double roots, the ganglion formed on their posterior, their subsequent union and division into proper anterior and posterior, with the first of which we have only now to deal, pro- posing to examine them in succession from above down- wards. First Dorsal or Cervico-brachial This is a very large nerve, emerging from between the first and second dorsal vertebras; we have already explained how it crosses upwards and outwards, in front of the neck of the first rib, and behind the superior intercostal artery to join the last cervical for the formation of the brachial plexus, but just as it escapes from the intervertebral foramen it throws oflf a small branch, a representative of the superior intercostal, which, however, does not truly enter the space between the two layers of muscles till it reaches the anterior extremity of the rib, when it then 2 H 3

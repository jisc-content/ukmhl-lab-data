339 MUSCLES OF THE FORE-ARM. extremely fine and moveable on the back of the hand and fingers, terminating in a lunated fold at the root of the nail; ordinary sensibility prevails in this situation, tac- tile on the palmar aspect. Now make an incision along either border, and prolong it on the thenar and hypo-the- nar eminences, also slit the skin along each finger to the extremity; throw this down both on the back and front of the fore-arm and hand; this exposes the superficial fascia, which does not offer any peculiarities, but con- tains in its tissue several plexiform meshes of veins, and also several cutaneous nerves; these are,—on the front, in- ternal cutaneous; external cutaneous; cutaneous branch of the ulnar, to communicate with the internal cuta- neous ; short radial cutaneous from the radial nerve, an inch above the wrist; palmar and thenar cutaneous from the median, two inches above annular ligament;—on the posterior part, spiral cutaneous; posterior branch of ex- ternal cutaneous; radial nerve; and dorsal branch of the ulnar. The fascia, or investing tunic, is continuous before and above with the semilunar fascia of the biceps; behind with the superficial expansion of the triceps; attached to each condyle, to the posterior edge of the ulna its whole length, and below to the annular ligaments, an- terior and posterior. This fascia consists of two sets of fibres, the superficial, longitudinal, the deep, transverse or oblique, stronger behind than before, and increasing gradually in density as it descends towards the wrist; superiorly it gives attachment by its deep surface to the fleshy fibres of the several muscles, sending aponeurotic septa, which insulate and separate them from each other; these form superiorly trumpet-shaped sheaths, which are wide below, and narrow above; a thin layer also passes between the superficial muscles on the front of the fore-arm and the flexor sublimis; a second layer likewise separates the latter from the third or deepest set of flexors; in a similar manner the super- ficial and deep layers of extensors are isolated by a thin process, and the several muscles both anteriorly and posteriorly are surrounded each by a distinct sheath or tubule, that follows its course and figure; the radial and ulnar arteries, with their accompanying nerves also Q 2

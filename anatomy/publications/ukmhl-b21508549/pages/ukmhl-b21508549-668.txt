/ 658 NERVOUS SYSTEM. cinereum, above and before to the grey floor of the third ventricle, which attaches it to the brain, below to the olivary process of the sphenoid bone, and, externally, to the carotid artery and external perforated plate. It con- sists of three sets of fibres, non-decussating, decussating, and commissural:â€”the first, being the external, pass ou to the eye on their own side; the second, or middle set, crossing the centre of the chiasma, supply the inner part of the retina of the opposite side; whilst the third, or most internal, behind the chiasma, run forwards, and are then reflected backwards, being the commissural fibres of origin; and in front of the chiasma, running from the retina of one side backwards, again turn forwards to the opposite eye, constituting the commissural fibres of ter- mination. With reference to a decussation from above downwards, though it may exist, we confess, even after the most careful preparation, that such an arrangement has eluded our observation. In front of the commissure the optic nerves pass outwards and forwards, lying be- low the anterior cerebral arteries, and above the lesser winces of the sphenoid bone, which they groove, and, entering the optic foramen, become surrounded by a dense sheath of dura mater, and continuing their course downwards, forwards, and outwards, present a slight constriction, and then, perforating the sclerotic coat by a cribriform, and the choroid coat by a well-defined aperture, they expand to form the retina. On passing from the chiasma to the optic foramen the nerve lies superior and internal to the deep carotid artery, and here the ophthalmic lies to its outer side, but afterwards winds round it to its internal. In the orbit surrounded by the recti muscles and ciliary nerves, it has those ad- ^'^Relati^ns.^Ahove, the superior division of the third and nasal nerves; externally, the lenticular ganglion, its roots, and the ophthalmic artery and vem; internally, Sie naso-ciliary benches; and inferiorly the inferior ob- lique division of the third. The optic nerves consist of vei y delicate filaments, similar to those of the bram and cord possessing the same disposition to become varicose 'vi e; ^subjected to pressure, as exhibited by the olfac-

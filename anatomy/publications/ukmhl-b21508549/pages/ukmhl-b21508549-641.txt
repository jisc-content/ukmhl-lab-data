631 CEEEBRUM. but generally double, emerge from within the brain by the transverse fissure, and open into the straight sinus. Now divide the velum cautiously, avoiding the re- moval of the pineal gland, and beneath the former will be seen the— Choroid Plexuses of the Third Ventricle.—Two small granulated folds of pia mater that pass forwards on the upper surface of the optic thalami, united by their margins with the similar structures of the lateral ventricles, and not unfrequently being absent altogether. The following parts are now brought into view from before backwards, and may be examined individually: Anterior commissure, descending pillars of the fornix, foramen commune anterius, commissura mollis covering the third ventricle, foramen commune posterius, pos- terior commissure, transverse band of the pineal gland with its peduncles, pineal gland resting on the tuber- cula quadrigemina, valve of Vieussens, origin of the fourth nerve, processus a cerebello ad testes, and lastly, the superior vermiform process of the cerebellum. Anterior Commissure.—A thick, white, round cord of white medullary tissue, stretched between the an- terior and internal parts of the corpora striata, in which their fibres radiate in their course to the cerebral he- mispheres, where some believe them to be continuous with the external roots of the olfactory nerves. In its course it is a little curved, being convex forwards, and it is related behind to the descending pillars of the for- nix ; before and above to the septum lucidum, and be- low to the lamina cinerea. Foramen Commune Anterius (Monroe).—This aper- ture, first described by the anatomist whose name it bears, is bounded above and before by the fornix and the anterior commissure; posteriorly by the optic tha- lami, choroid plexuses, and velum; laterally communicat- ing with the lateral, and below with the third ventricle, and in the fcctus also with the fifth by the canal of Wenzel; it transmits the arachnoid lining into those cavities, being thus traced by its discoverer. This mem- brane enters by the foramen of Bichat, forming a canal lymg below the velum (we believe between its layers), and at the foramen commune anterius it passes into the

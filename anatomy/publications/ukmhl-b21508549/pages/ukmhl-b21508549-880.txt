870 ARTERIES AND VEINS. receives its nutrition from the dorsalis pedis; but the integument of the three outer toes and a half is supplied by the metatarsal branch of the dorsalis pedis, while to the skin of the inner toe, and half the second, the internal plantar artery is distributed. Hence it may be observed, that a very close analogy exists in the distri bution of the vessels of the lower and upper extremi- ties, the anterior tibial representing the radial, and the posterior the ulnar. VENOUS SYSTEM. For the purpose of examining the veins, they should be injected from the branches towards the heart; but as these vessels are usually found distended with blood after death, the larger branches are sufficiently evident for the purpose of the anatomist; but if it is an object to follow the osseal venous networks, or the minute ra- dicles and plexuses of organs, their artificial distension becomes absolutely indispensable. The veins are divi- sible into the general and portal systems, whilst the ior- mer may again be subdivided into thoracic, cervico-ce- phalic, brachial, abdominal, femoral, and Rachidian._ Vena Cava Descendens.â€”This large trunk, which receives all the veins from the upper half of the body, is about three inches in length, two inches being situated without the pericardium, and one withm that sac. it commences at the upper margin of the cartilage of the second rib at its junction with the sternum on the right side, and, running downwards, inwards, and forwards, terminates at the posterior superior angle of the riglit auricle, where the posterior part of its cylinder is con- tinuous with the inferior cava. In this course it is curved, the concavity being towards the left side, and as it pierces the fibrous pericardium a thin process ot that membrane is prolonged upwards on its coats; some- times, however, this vessel is replaced by the two vena3 innominataj, opening separately mto the Collateral BRANCHES.-The vena azygos opens mto its posterior and right side, just as the serous layer ot theCricardium is tbout being reflected from the vesse , also pericardial branches, right phrenic, internal mam-

511 HEART. 4> left auricle, right ventricle, and that portion of the left which constitutes the apex of the heart; aorta, pulmo- nary artery, ascending and descending cavte, pulmonary veins; and lastly, the coronary vessels, ramifying in the interventricular furrow. Let the student now pro- ceed with the dissection of the heart. The Heart is a muscular organ contained within the pericardium, consisting of four cavities, namely,â€”two auricles, and a similar number of ventricles, the former occupying the superior portions, the latter the inferior, constituting the greater part of the organ. It is of a triangular figure, the base above, the apex below, but situated obliquely, so that its axis would be represented by a line passing from the cartilage of the second rib obliquely downwards, forwards, and towards the left costal cartilage, or the interval between fifth and sixth, occupying a space corresponding to the right margin of the sternum, the whole width of that bone, and the car- tilages of the third, fourth, and fifth ribs of the left side in front, and the bodies of the fifth, sixth, and seventh dorsal vertebrfE posteriorly. It has been likewise sub- divided into sides, a single auricle and ventricle apper- taining to each. In the lower animals these may be cor- rectly described as right and left, but in man, although a similar nomenclature has been adopted, it is certainly inaccurate, and should be consequently exploded, as the cavities lie rather anterior and posterior, the former being synonymous with the right, the latter with the left side of the older authors. However, we prefer to adopt the names derived from the function which each performs: thus, the right or anterior side, inasmuch as It propels the venous blood through the vascular sys- tem of the lungs, should be called pulmonary or venous chamber, and the left or posterior side, that urges the blood through the whole arterial system, may be de- scribed as the systemic or arterial. As the organ lies obliquely within the pericardium, it presents three sur- faces and two edges: the anterior surface, convex and triangular, looks forwards, and is marked by a median vertical furrow, which divides it into two unequal por- tions; of these the right ventricle forms three-fourths, the remainder being constituted by the left.

393 TESTICLES. s 3 must be sought in the foetal position, for whilst in the abdomen the right testicle lies much lower than the left, as the liver depresses the right kidney, and thus the cremaster and gubernaculum testis are shorter on the right side, as also the vas deferens, which at that period runs to the base of the bladder directly; it follows, there- fore, as a result that might be anticipated, that when the testicles descend, the shorter cremaster and vas deferens prevent the organ on the right side extending so low as that on the left, which has a much longer cremaster and duct, as it previously lay higher in the abdomen. Tunica Albuginea vel Propria. —Individually a fibrous, but in connexion with the tunica vaginalis, a fibro-serous membrane; it covers and adheres to the surface of the testicle, and at the posterior edge dips into the gland between it and the epididymis, to form a triangular cavity,—the mediastinum testis, or cor- pus Highmorianum. To fully appreciate this arrange- ment, a transverse section should be made of the gland, and it will then be seen that the mediastinum is trian- gular, the apex directed towards the anterior edge, the sides formed by the inverted portion of the fibrous tunic. From the apex a number of sepimenta or tra- beculas radiate forwards to the internal surface of the tunic, thus separating the lobuli testis, and inclosincr each in its distinct compartment. The tunica albu- ginea is of a bluish white colour, resembling the dura mater, equally dense, but thinner and more transparent; the unyielding nature of this membrane explains the absence of any great amount of swelling of the gland Itself m testitis, but it does yield to long-continued distention as in sarcocele. The perfect sepimenta also account for the fact that the contents of one loculus only may escape in lipoma or scrofulous sarcocele, and that the disease may then terminate. Structure of the Testicle.—Raise off the tunica albu- ginea on one side of the gland, and to its deep surface will be seen adhering a vascular membrane, tunica vasculosa; it surrounds the glandular structure, and sends a process on each lobule, enclosing it like a sheath of pia mater, to which it is analogous in structure, bein^ areolo-vascular.

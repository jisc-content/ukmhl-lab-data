MEMBRANES OF CORD. 649 yet fully displayed, as it is invested by a layer of wa- tery adipose tissue wliich surrounds it, forming the bed or stroma for numerous plexuses of veins (Rachidian) which ramify on it in every direction. When these have been carefully examined, the cord may be next re- moved from the canal, and this can always be affected with greater facility by commencing below, and cuttino- the nerves of the cauda equina as they issue from the sacral foramina; these can now be lifted upwards, and as the dissection is continued towards the cranium, the nerves may be divided in succession, and the fibrous bands which connect the membrane to the posterior va- ginal ligament likewise cut across; ultimately the knife may be swept through the entire structure immediately below the foramen magnum, when it becomes thus de- tached for examination. The membranes of the cord are three in number,â€”an external or fibrous, derived from the dura mater, a middle or serous, and an inter- nal or areolo-vascular, the two last being continuous with the arachnoid and pia mater of the cranial cavity Ihe dura mater may be considered as a tubular pro- longation from that of the cranium, expanded at both extremities and contracted in the centre, attachedfirmlv above around the margin of the foramen magnum and terminating below at the inferior part of the lumbar re- gion, where it forms a well-marked dilatation, from which separate processes are given off to constitute sheaths for the nerves of the cauda equina; its exter- nal surface is smoother than that which lines the cavity of the skull, neither does it form a perfect periosteurn for Its bony case, as it only adheres to it at a few and detached points, but its internal is remarkable for its glistening, polished appearance, a character which it derives from the visceral layer of the arachnoid; it is perforated along its sides by a double row of foramina for the passage of the anterior and posterior spinal nerves, and a tubular prolongation from its structure as reflected upon them for some distance after they emerge. The differences between it and the dura mater of the bram are therefore the following :-First]y, it does not form a perfect periosteum, being separated from the walls of the canal by loose areolar tissue of a watery

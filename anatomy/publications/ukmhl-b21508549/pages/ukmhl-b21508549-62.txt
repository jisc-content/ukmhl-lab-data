52 THE OSSEOUS SYSTEM. SO as to strike the junction of the upper with the middle third of the obturator hole. Passing now across this foramen, it meets the edge of the acetabulum at the upper part of the notch, and continuing its course in- wards, the portion of the bone in question becomes de- tached. In shape the ischium has been compared to a horse-shoe, and for the purpose of description may be divided into a body formed by the acetabulum, a spine, tuberosity, and ramus. The body of the bone is very broad and thick, as contrasted with the other parts ot it It forms something more than two-fifths of the ace- tabulum, and next to the ilium is the most promment part, except internally where it is excavated, constitut- ing what is called the notch, a natural deficiency left for the entrance of branches of the obturator and internal circumflex of the profunda, to enter to supply the parts within the capsular ligament. Immediately below the lip of the acetabulum, between it and the tuberosity, is a deep groove, traversed by the tendon of the obturator externus, passing upwards, backwards, and mwards, m the direction of the spine. Behind the acetabulum, and between it and the spine, the bone is of a triangu ar shape, and slightly convex, over which the capsular muscles of the hip-joint glide to their insertion. The spine is situated posteriorly, directed downwards back- wards, and inwards; broad at its root, contracted at its free extremity, forming the Hne of demarcation betwe^i thetwosciaticnotches, corresponding by its external sur- face to the pudic vessels and nerves, and having attached to it the superior gemellus; the lesser sciatic ligament is inserted into its point; the coccygseus arises from its posterior part; the levator ani from its internal surtace interior to the spine is a small but deep groove, directed Tut wards and backwards, which, m the natural state of the parts, is a foramen formed by the great sciatic li^a- men This is the lesser sciatic notch through which the pudic vessels and nerves enter, with a small branch f om^ the sacral plexus, to supply the obturator muscle 2Zh passes out, and is separated from the tuberosity Tf the ischium by a bursa. This last-named process lupies the posterior and inferior part of the bone, and presents for examination two surfaces and two margms.

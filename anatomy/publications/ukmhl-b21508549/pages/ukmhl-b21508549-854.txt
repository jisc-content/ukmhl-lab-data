ARTERIES AND VEINS. 844 Internal Iliac.—Opposite and internal to the sacro- iliac symphisis the common iliac bifurcates into the external and internal, the former vessel being the longer and larger, though in foetal life the exact reverse ob- tained, the latter preponderating in both measurements. In the adult, therefore, the internal iliac commences at the point indicated, and, passing downwards, backwards, and outwards, terminates at the upper part of the sciatic notch, in a trunk common to the pudic and sciatic. Relations.—Anteriorly, recto-vesical fold of peritoneum and ureter; posteriorly, lumbo-sacral nerve, ilio-lumbar and glutseal arteries, which separate it from the bone; in- ternally, origin of pyriformis, exit of sacral nerves from their foramina, lateral and middle sacral arteries, with sympathetic nerves; and externally, obturator nerve, artery, and vein, which are also somewhat superior to it. On the left side the corresponding vein lies almost directly posterior, but slightly internal to it; while on the right, though still in the same position, it is also a little external to it. _ Remarlcs.—l^ fostal life this artery is continued as the umbilical to the navel, and traversed, not the pel- vic, but abdominal region, and in its course described a well-marked curve, the concavity of which looked up- wards and forwards; but the ligature applied to the cord at the period of birth produced its obhteration as far as the bladder, and the descent of that viscus into the true pelvis likewise caused a change in its direc- tion the concavity of the curve which it forms in the adult being the opposite of that in the foetus, viz., up- wards and backwards. We have observed this to be the case in the numerous instances which we have exa- mined, and the very shape of the bone which it passes over and the traction exercised by the gluta;al, are sut- ficient to confirm this view. We have omitted men- tioning as posterior relations either the sacral plexus or pyriformis muscle, because if the artery, as generally admitted, terminates at the upper margin of the great sciatic notch, it is impossible that it could rest on either one or the other. ~ . ^nomafe._These are only such as refer to its vane- ties of length, its average being from one inch to an inch

THE SUPERIOR MAXILLARY. 105 face, prominent and convex, is called the tuberosity, which is perforated by several small foramina for the mental nerves and vessels, and is likewise marked by a small groove, corresponding to the pterygo-palatine ca- nal ; the outer is smooth and concave, and gives origin to the buccinator muscle. The orbital surface is trian- gular in shape, flat and smooth, looking upwards, for- wards, and outwards, marked by a deep groove poste- riorly, which runs forwards to terminate in the infra- orbital canal. It has three margins: an internal, thin and bevilled off posteriorly, to articulate with the os planum of the ethmoid and a small portion of the lachry- mal, notched anteriorly for the commencement of the nasal duct; its external edge is smooth and rounded, where it forms the internal boundary of the spheno- maxillary fissure; but two notches are visible in it an- teriorly, one for the infra-orbital canal, the other for the spheno-maxillary fissure; its anterior margin is concave upwards, presenting externally the rough sur- face for articulation with the malar bone, while inter- nally it is smooth and free. The naso-palatine portion of the bone is situated inferiorly; it presents three sur- faces,—a superior, an inferior, and internal. The supe- rior forms the floor of the nose, is concave from side to side, and likewise so from before backwards, broader be- hind thatn in front, and bounded internally by a thin ir- regular lip,—the nasal crest; external to this process, and half-an-inch from its anterior edge, is a small fora- men,—the anterior palatine, which communicates below with the incisive fossa, and gives passage to the naso- palatine nerve. The inferior surface presents a remark- able contrast to that already described; it is of a trian- gular shape, bounded externally by the alveolar pro- cess, internally by the symphisis with its fellow of the opposite side, and posteriorly by its junction with the palate; it is concave and rough for the attachment of the mucous membrane of the hard palate, while ex- ternally, as it unites with the alveolar arch, a groove appears for the branch of the posterior palatine nerve to ' anastomose with the naso-palatine; the posterior edge , is rough and serrated to articulate with the palate bone. Its internal surface is triangular in shape,—the base an- F 3

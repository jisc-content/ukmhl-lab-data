676 NERVOUS STfSTEM. trie, and one which winds over the symphisis to the qua- dratus menti. Gustatory Nerve.â€”Smaller than the last, and on arising from the inferior maxillary, lies between the ex- ternal pterygoid and the pterygo-pharyngeal aponeu- rosis, then passes downwards between the two ptery- goids, and here receives the chorda tympani, then runs between the internal pterygoid and the ramus of the jaw, and, escaping from beneath the anterior edge of that muscle, lies on the mylo-hyoid attachment of thesuperior constrictor, above the submaxillary gland; still pursu- ing its course forwards and upwards, accompanied by the Whartonian duct, which it crosses at an acute angle, lying on the hyo-glossus and mucous membrane of the mouth, above the sublingual gland and mylo-hyoid mus- cles, it reaches the inferior surface of the tongue; and, dividing into long and slender filaments which pierce the inferior lingualis and stylo-glossus, its ultimate twigs may be traced to the simple papillae on the dorsum and tip of the tongue, where they terminate in loops. The gustatory nerve receives in the pterygoid space a con- stant branch of communication from the inferior dental, and a little lower down the chorda tympani, which is in- separably united with it; then sends the formative branches to the submaxillary ganglion, also twigs to the tonsil, half-arches of the palate and mucous membrane of the'fauces, while on the hyo-glossus a number of fila- ments join the lingual or hypo-glossal nerve to form the hyo-glossal plexus, which rests on the hyo-glossus muscle. The sense of taste resides in those parts sup- plied by the gustatory nerve. Sixth Nerve, or Abducens, is intermediate m size between the third and fourth, arising from the pyrami- dal body, just as it joins the pons varolii, then passes upwards, forwards, and outwards between the pons and the basilar process of the occipital bone, separated from its fellow by the basilar artery; it then perforates the dura mater about a quarter of an inch below the pos- terior clinoid process, and passing over the suture be- tween the petrous portion of the temporal with the sphenoid bone, courses along the inner wall of the ca- vernous sinus, lying on the outer side of the carotid ar- tery and merely separated from the blood ot the sinus

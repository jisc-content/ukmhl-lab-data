555 LARGE INTESTINE, 2 B 2 acute angle. It is not exactly horizontal, but forms k curve, the convexity of which is directed downwards and forwards; and it is found in both hypochondriac regions^ as well as partially in the epigastric and umbi- lical, its relations are,_in front, the abdominal pa- netes; behind, the root of the mesentery and transverse mesocolon; above, theliver, gall bladder, inferior border of stomach and spleen; and below, the small intestines. Descending Colon—This reaches from the spleen, where it passes from the transverse at an acute angle, as far down as the iliac fossa, occupying this rerrion as well as the hypochondriac and lumbar. It differs from the ascending in being more deeply situated, and presents a slight concavity which is directed forwards In its course downwards it is supported by the kidney and quadratus lumborum, and has in front of it the small intestines, which are also folded in external to it,_on Its inside it is in relation with the psoas. Sigmoid FLExuRE.—This lies between the descending colon above, and the rectum below; but it is difficult to dehne its limit m either direction. It is very irregular in Its length, as it may vary from six inches to three feet m extent; but it is always convoluted, and imparts to the touch a denser and thicker feel than the rest of the large intestine, while the serous membrane is loosely re- flected around it, which confers on it a mobility nearly equal to that of the ilium and jejunum. It corresponds by its deep surface to the iliac fossa, and in front to the abdominal parietes,_in every other direction it is en- veloped by the convolutions of the small intestines KECTUM.—This portion of the gut has been very in- correctly named, as from its designation it mio-ht be presumed to be perfectly straight, which is far from be- ing the case. It commences at the left sacro-iliac syn- chondrosis a point which is rather arbitrary, and takes a curved and tortuous direction downwards, to terminate at the anus. It has generally been divided into three parts: the first extending from its origin to the third piece of the sacrum, passing obliquely downwards back- wards, and towards the right side; the second reaches as lar as the tip of the coccyx, its course being down- wards, forwards, and slightly to the left side; the third

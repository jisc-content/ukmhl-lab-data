CEREBRAL NERVES. 667 it does not seem that the existence of ganglionic cells is essential to the function of the ciliary branches emanat- ing from the ganglion, as we have often observed the formative branches coalescing to form a loop vfithout the presence of a ganglion or its elements, whilst from a careful examination of the iris we could not detect any anatomical character indicating inefficiency of function during life. The ciliary branches which arise from the anterior angles of the ganglion are divisible into a su- perior and inferior fasciculus, the former consisting of from four to six, the latter of from six to ten fila- ments; these pass forwards tortuously around the optic nerve, which they leave at the sclerotic, and, turning for- wards, pierce the sclerotic at its posterior third, then run between it and the choroid, perforate the ciliary ligament, in which some of them remain, whilst others emerge from its inner circle to terminate in the iris. Tiedemann believes that the ciliary arteries are accom- panied by branches of the lenticular ganglion, the for- mer conducting them to the retina; and also states, that he has also seen a filament perforate the optic nerve with the arteria centralis retina; but that filament, described as arising from the Casserian ganglion, and joining the inferior root of the lenticular, does not exist. Naso-ciliart Nervesâ€”These are two slender fila- : ments which arise from the nasal nerve on the internal side of the optic, and, communicating with the other ci- : liary branches, run one on each side of the optic nerve, 1 having a similar termination to those before mentioned! These nerves have been sometimes termed "long ciliary," 1 without any obvious reason or advantage. Superior Maxillary, or Second Division of the 1 Fifth, arises in common with the ophthalmic from the ^anterior and external part of the ganglion, runs almost ^horizontally forwards to reach the foramen rotundum, tthrough which it passes into the pterygo-maxillary tfossa; curving forwards along the superior wall of that tfossa, with its concavity directed upwards and forwards, lit enters the infra-orbital canal, through which it runs 'forwards and downwards, and, emerging by the infra- Ibital foramen, terminates on the face. The superior iimaxillary nerve is commonly overlapped at its origin by

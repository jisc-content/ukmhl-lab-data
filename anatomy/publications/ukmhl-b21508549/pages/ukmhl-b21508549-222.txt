THE ANATOMY OF THE JOINTS. 212 is essentially an organ of prehension; its basis or foun- dation,—the carpus, is remarkable for its strength, de- pending as well on the manner in which its bones are accurately dovetailed together, as on the number of its ligaments; the union between it and the metacarpus permits but very limited motion, except in the instance of the thumb, where great mobility is requisite, as it is the organ which is essentially destined to oppose the prehensile functions of all the other fingers; in the me- chanism of the latter we have combined great delicacy of touch with vast strength, and the power of those hinge- joints can be regulated by the will, which can increase or diminish it, according to the degree of exertion required. TEMPORO-MAXILLARY ARTICULATION. This is formed by the condyle of the inferior maxil- lary bone being fitted or received into the glenoid cavity of the temporal; the articulation is condyloid, and it has for its security an external and an internal, a capsular ligament, and an interarticular fibro-cartilage. External Lateral.—This is a short thick ligament, arising from the tubercle at the bifurcation of the zygo- matic arch; it passes downwards and backwards, and is inserted into the outer side of the neck of the lower jaw; it rests by its deep surface on the joint, while superficially it is covered in by the skin and fascia. Internal Lateral.—This is long, thin, and weak; it is attached above to the spine of the sphenoid bone, and be- low to the lip or spur forming the inner edge of the dental foramen, sending a prolongation downwards and for- wards over the my lo-hyoid nerve, which becomes continu- ous with the periosteum; externally it is in relation with the internal maxillary, dental, and middle meningeal ar- teries, gustatory, dental, temporo-auricular and Vidian nerves, with a thin process of the parotid gland,—all which separate it from the vertical ramus of the inferior maxilla; its internal surface corresponds to the internal pterygoid below, and to the levator palati and Eustachian tube above. Great variations of opinion exist as to the use of this ligament; it cannot, as it is commonly said, be of any benefit in protecting the vessels and nerves

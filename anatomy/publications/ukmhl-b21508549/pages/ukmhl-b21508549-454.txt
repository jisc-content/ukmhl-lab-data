THE MUSCULAR SYSTEM. 444 and the vastus externus. In one instance the three bursal sacs farmed a continuous chain, a free commu- nication existing between them, but the rule is that each should be distinct. We have also seen a bursa in three cases between the tendon of the muscle where it commences, and the superficial fascia. GLUTiEUS Medius. —Triangular, thick, and fleshy above, tendinous and narrow below; it arises from the superior curved line on the dorsum of the ilium, from the surface above, and below that line, from the three anterior fourths of the crest of the ilium, anterior superior spine, notch below, and from the strong fascia which covers its anterior fourth, and frequently ten- dinous from the anterior point of the inferior curved line; the anterior fibres pass downwards and backwards, the posterior downwards and forwards, the middle ver- tically, and are inserted by a fan-shaped tendon, which is formed in the muscle, into an oblique facette on the external side of the great trochanter, and into a tuber- cle at the anterior part of that facette. Relations.—It is covered by the gluteus maximus, tensor vaginge femoris, and in front only by the fascia; also by the superficial branches of the glutseal artery, and a thin fibrous layer; it lies on the glutaeus mini- mus and the deep branches of the gluteal artery and nerve on the ilium and trochanter, from the latter ot which it is separated by a bursa. _ Adioii —The anterior fibres flex and rotate inwards; the posterior extend and rotate outwards, the anterior being much the more powerful; the whole muscle will abduct the limb, and strengthen the capsular ligament ^^GlumJ's Minimus is seen by reflecting the last mus- cle to which its shape is similar, but it is much smaller; it arises from the inferior curved line on the dorsum of the ilium, and from the capsular ligament of the hip- ioint; the anterior fibres pass downwards and back- ward , the posterior obliquely forwards the middle vertically, and are attached to a fan-shaped tendon, by which it^is inserted into the upper and anterior part Tf the great trochanter, the bone being usually marked by a facette, which is transverse.

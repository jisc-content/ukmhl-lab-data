210 THE ANATOMY OF THE JOINTS. Fourth Metacarpal.—This articulates with the os magnum and unciform, but it has only one dorsal and one palmar ligament, which spring from the anterior and posterior aspects of the bones alluded to, and stretch to the corresponding surfaces of the head of the meta- carpal bone. Fifth Metacarpal.—This is united to the unciform bone only, and has three ligaments for its security,— an anterior, a posterior, and an internal; they pass from one bone to another, and firmly connect them. Synovial Membrane.—There are three distinct pro- cesses for the carpo-metacapal articulation; the first has been already alluded to as being peculiar to the thumb, but the second and third, which are prolongations from that of the carpus, are supplied, the former to the second and third metacarpal bones, and the latter to the fourth and fifth. UNION OF THE METACARPAL BONES WITH EACH OTHER. These are united both at their carpal and digital ex- tremities ; in the first instance they present small late- ral facettes, whicb are in contact with each other, and are secured by dorsal, palmar, and interosseous liga- ments ; of these the two first consist of thick fasciculi of fibres, stretching from the head of one metacarpal bone to that of the next, the palmar being much the stronger; the interosseous occupy the intervals between the fa- cettes, and are possessed of very great strength. The. digital extremities do not, strictly speaking, ar- ticulate with each other, but a small synovial sac is interposed between each, to facilitate their motions; they are united together hj a loose transverse ligament, which stretches between them on their anterior surface, and thus prevents their divarication; this band of fibres does not, however, include the metacarpal bone of the thumb.

The several lymphatics from the in- guinal region enter the pelvis through the crural ring, internal to. the femoral vein, and divide into a descend- ing fasciculus, which enters the internal iliac, and an ascending, which passes through the external iliac, the former receiving the deep glutseal, vesical, hemor- rhoidal, and deep lymphatics of the penis, also those of the uterus and vagina in the female, and plexuses are formed on the external and internal iliac vessels, which, passing through the lumbar glands, terminate in the recepfcaculum chyli. The lumbar lymphatics also re- ceive those from the testicle, which are divided into superficial and deep, the former lying beneath the tu- nica vaginalis testis, and the latter commencing m the gland, both, however, communicating; they then ascend in the cord, interlacing with the spermatic veins, and following the course of these latter vessels, they termi- nate in the lumbar glands, in common with those of the kidneys and suprarenal capsules, in both of wHch or- gans the lymphatics are superficial and deep. ^ Lymphatics of the Liverâ€”The glands are situated in the lesser omentum, behind the pylorus, and are usually of a yellowish-black or brown colour. The lymphatic vessels of the organ are first superficial, form- ing arborescent plexuses 'beneath the peritoneal tunic of the liver on its convex and concave surfaces; the for- mer run forwards between the layers of the falciform ligament, passing through a space behind the ensiform cartilage, but the most numerous run backwards, pass- ing between the layers of the respective lateral and the coronary ligaments, some perforating the flat diaphragm posteriorly, to reach the thoracic duct in the thorax, whilst others pierce the crus, and join the same duct m the abdomen. The latter, or the lymphatics on the under surface of the liver, having formed a plexus round the rrall-bladder, some communicate with the glands ot the lesser curvature of the stomach, whilst others enter those of the lesser omentum. The deep-seated set emerge from the transverse fissure, passing through the glands of the lesser omentum, then through those surrounding

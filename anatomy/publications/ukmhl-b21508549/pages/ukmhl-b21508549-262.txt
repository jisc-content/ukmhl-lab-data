THE MUSCULAR SYSTEM. 252 â– we think that half-an-inch below the apophysary tn- bercle of the malar bone and zygomatic arch indicates its position correctly; but in one case the distance amounted to three-quarters of an inch. The deep surface may be divided into three processes; from the situations they occupy these may be named glenoid, maxillary, and styloid; the first is the most simple process; it is wedged into the posterior part of the glenoid cavity of the temporal bone, and is related anteriorly to the capsu- lar ligament of the lower jaw, behind to the cartilaginous meatus, and internally to the vaginal process; the tem- poral artery runs upwards through it, also the temporo- auricular nerve that runs through this process, to reach the back part of the temporal artery, then winds upon its superficial surface, following the course of that ves- sel ; above it lies in contact with the bone, the chorda- tympani nerve, and laxator tympani tendon; this por- tion is small in the foetus and infant, in consequence of the processus auditorius not being developed, also in old age, when the teeth disappear, when the condyle of the jaw passes backwards, and causes atrophy of this process; the maxillary portion difi'ers greatly in size, even on opposite sides of the same subject; caudate and prolonged, it passes inwards between the internal late- ral ligament and ramus of the jaw, also between the pterygoid muscles, into the space of that name, incor- rectly stated to be in contact with the inferior maxillary nerve, from which it is separated by the external ptery- goid muscle; the internal maxillary artery runs through it, deeply situated; externally it corresponds to the ramus of the jaw and the inferior dental artery; inter- nally to the dental and gustatory nerves, and the inter- nal lateral ligament; still more internally it corresponds to the pterygoid muscles, the before-named nerves, and the internal maxillary artery. It has been mentioned that this process varies in size, sometimes it is even absent altogether; a mere vertical sulcus in the gland, corresponding to the ramus of the jaw, signifies the only attempt at the formation of the process, and when absent a lobule of fat supplies its place. The styloid process lies in a recess of a triangular form, bounded behind by the posterior belly of the digastric, inter-

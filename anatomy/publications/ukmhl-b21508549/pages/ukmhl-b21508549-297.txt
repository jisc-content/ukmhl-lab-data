TONGUE. 287 tide, it may be raised by irritants, forming vesicles si- milar to aphthae; or, again, it may be peeled off in an extensive layer after maceration. This covering has much greater density on the tongue than in any other situation. The Tongue is composed essentially of muscular tis- sue, being similar to the heart in that respect. Its figure is oVal, and corresponds to the space included between the horizontal rami of the inferior maxillary bone. When in the natural and unconstrained posi- tion, it extends from the incisor teeth to the os hy- oides, so that its absolute base is concealed; but if only that portion disclosed when the mouth is opened be considered as representing the figure of the organ, it would then be triangular, the base posteriorly, the apex in front, free on the dorsum, margins, and the anterior third of the inferior surface; it receives an investment from the oral mucous membrane, and is exceedingly moveable,â€”these motions exercising no inconsiderable influence on the larynx, pharynx, and palate, in conse- quence of the attachments of the organ anteriorly; it is connected to the symphisis menti by the frsenum lin- guas and the genio-hyo-glossi muscles; posteriorly to the epiglottis by the glosso-epiglottidean folds of mu- cous membrane, which are three in number, the cen- tral being the largest; superiorly to the palate by the palato-glossus and mucous membrane; superiorly to the OS hyoides by mucous membrane, a fibrous layer (hyo-glossal membrane), also by the genio-hyo-glossi and inferior linguales muscles. This organ presents margins, surfaces, and a point, for examination. The margins are thick posteriorly, thin and sharp in front; the inferior surface is smooth and concave, with a tri- angular mesial depression continued from the attach- ment of the fr^num, and on either side a longitudinal elevation, formed by the linguales and hyo-glossi mus- cles, the ranine veins being also visible through the mucous membrane. The Dorsum likewise presents amesian raphe, extend- ing from the foramen coscum to the point, where it forms a notch, the depth varying with the tension of the frse- num. In cases where the latter fold is preternaturally

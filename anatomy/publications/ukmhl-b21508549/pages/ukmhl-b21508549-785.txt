AORTA. 775 of the diaphragm, and ultimately terminates about the fourth lumbar vertebra. In order to facilitate its de- to render its complicated relations more intelligible, it has been generally divided into three parts, VIZ.,—the arch, the thoracic, and abdominal por- tions. But before entering into a detailed examination ot these several divisions, it will be necessary to state briefly Its mode of attachment to the heart, and its- peculiar relations at its point of connexion to this or- gan with the peculiar mechanism which nature has employed (valves) to obviate that regurgitation which must have resulted from the elasticity of this capacious tube, had no means been providentially employed to antagonize it. i j In .the description of the left ventricle of the heart It lias been shown that at the right extremity of its base a fabrous annulus is situated, connected to its mus- cular structure, to which the term " aortic zone" has been attached, presenting to the touch a sensation of a dense, resisting ring, and to this the vessel under con- sideration IS attached in the following manner :_From the distal edge of the zone three triangular processes are given off, their bases broad and continuous with each other at the zone, but as they ascend towards the artery with the walls of which they are ultimately blended by their apices, they leave spaces between theni, completed by the serous membrane of the pericardium externally, and the endocardium or ventricular lining prolonged into the aorta internally, whilst the middle tunic of that vessel exhibiting three convex roots com- pletes the attachment,_thus constituting three dis- tinc pouches formerly described by Morgagni, after- wards by Valsalva, and now generally kfown'as the Z the ed'"- ^««^"ption, it is manifest that the edges of the roots present crescentic margins the concavities of which look towards the vessel, and to these sharp edges are attached the convex margins of the semilunar valves, which are of course similar in number to the interspaces between the roots, viz three 1 hcse valves are precisely the same in structure ot a thin process of fibrous tissue prolonged from the

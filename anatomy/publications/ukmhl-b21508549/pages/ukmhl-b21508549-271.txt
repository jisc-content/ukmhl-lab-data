261 MUSCLES OF THE NECK. backwards, and is inserted into the lower edge of the body of the os hyoides. Relations.â€”It lies on the thyroid cartilage, thyro- hyoid membrane, and branch of the superior thyroid artery, sometimes on the superior laryngeal nerve; it is covered by the sterno-hyoid and a branch of the lin- gual nerve that supplies it. Action To depress the os hyoides; vrhen that bone is fixed it may elevate the thyroid cartilage, and thus relax the vocal chords by diminishing the crico-thyroid space. Let the student now direct particular attention to the surgical regions into which the neck has been di- vided, conceiving that the mesian line divides this space into two symmetrical halves; each presents a figure somewhat quadrilateral', longer from above downwards than transversely; the sterno-mastoid crosses it ob- liquely, forming an antero-lateral triangle in front of that muscle, and a postero-lateral behind it; the former has its base at the ramus of the jaw, and a line prolonged from the angle of that bone to the mastoid process; the apex at the sternum; the base of the latter corresponds to the clavicle; its apex to the occipital bone behind the mastoid process of the temporal; these are again sub- divided by the omo-hyoid, coursing from below and behind, obliquely upwards and forwards, into four lesser triangles, which have been named the anterior inferior, and the anterior superior (but this latter would be incomplete without the continuation of the line of the omo-hyoid, by the anterior belly of the digastric), the posterior inferior and posterior superior triangles. The anterior inferior triangle is bounded internally by the sterno-hyoid and thyroid muscles, below by the anterior edge of the sterno-mastoid, and above by the anterior belly of the omo-hyoid; the base is at the mesian line; the apex at the decussation of the sterno-mastoid and omo-hyoid muscles. On removing the fascia the ante- rior jugular vein is seen coursing along the outer mar- gin of the sterno-hyoid and the omo-hyoid plexus, formed by the descendens and communicans noni of the cervical plexus; on raising the anterior part of the sheath the carotid artery and jugular vein are exposed, the pneumogastric nerve lying behind and between

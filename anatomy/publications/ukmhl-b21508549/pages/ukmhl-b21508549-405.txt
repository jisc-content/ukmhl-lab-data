I VAS DEFERENS. 3(|5 enters the cord, lying behind the spermatic artery and vein; then passes through the external ring, courses outwards and upwards through the inguinal canal; en- ters the internal ring, crosses the external iliac artery, vein, and genito-crural nerve, iliac and psoas muscles,' winds round the outer side of the epigastric artery,' separated from it by one of the vena; comites, but as it crosses the descending portion of the epigastric, it is separated from it by the spermatic artery; the order of superposition in this situation would be,—vas deferens, spermatic artery, epigastric artery, and lastly, exter- nal iliac vein; it then passes downwards, backwards, and inwards, to reach the side of the bladder, involved in the lateral false ligament of that organ, and on the side of the bladder, it crosses external to the obliterated hypogastric artery; continuing backwards it passes next internal to the ureter, then alters its direction, turnino- downwards, forwards, and inwards, to reach the pros° tate; and just at the turn it lies in front of the ter- minal point of the internal iliac artery; arriving at the internal side of the vesiculs seminales, its figure^under- goes a change; in the cord it was round,°but at the base of the bladder it becomes flattened and involved in the same fibrous capsule with the seminal vesicle; reach- ing the base of the prostate it receives the duct of the seminal reservoir, and then assumes the name of ductus communis ejaculatorius, which, losing its proper tunic pierces the base of the prostate gland, where there ap- pears a notch for its reception, being here smaller than the combined diameters of the ducts that formed if and passing obliquely upwards and forwards, below the'mid- dle or Home's lobe, it pierces the mucous membrane of the floor of the prostatic portion of the urethra, openino- at one side of the verumontanum in the prostatic sinus" Structure of the Seminiferous Tubules.—Each tubule of the gland is highly elastic, and consists of a cylin- der of nucleated elastic tissue (Hassal), these nuclei being most visible in the immature testis; the secretin? surface, which is general throughout the entire length of the tubes, being lined by a layer of cells, constitutin-r the epithelium. Some contain but a single nucleus'' others three or four, but all have this common character

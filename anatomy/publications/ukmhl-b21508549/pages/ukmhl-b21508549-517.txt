507 z 2 TRACHEA. giving attachment to the interannular elastic liga- ments which connect them to each other. The first and last rings present some peculiarities, the former sometimes being complete, and united to the cricoid cartilage, into which it ascends during expiration in the generality of instances, and as life advances partak- ing in those structural ossific changes to which the la- ryngeal cartilages are so prone. This perfect annular condition is natural in the bird tribe, being likewise os- seous, even to the fourth ring. The latter or last ring is triangular, the base above, the apex inferiorly, corre- sponding to the angle of bifurcation, the base supe- riorly connected to the penultimate cartilage, the lateral margins being cut off obliquely downwards and inwards, and presenting an aspect directed downwards and out- wards, to which the primary rings of the bronchi are attached. We have sometimes seen this divided into two lateral and a central prismatic portion, as if it was the type of a compound structure, composed of three minor rings; but it has never appeared to us as a per- fect circle, or even the seat of osseous deposits, the existence of such a form and structure being rather drawn from analogy than founded on observation; and when we reflect on the peculiar function performed by the inferior larynx in birds as a producer and modula- tor of sounds, and then contrast it with the bifurcation of the human trachea, and the offices it sustains, we at once become cognizant of the necessity for a dense and sonorous material in the former, and the inutility of a similar structure in the latter. The posterior surface ot the trachea for about one-fourth is composed of several structures; from within outwards we observe hrstly, mucous membrane; secondly, tracheal glands' thirdly, elastic tissue; and fourthly, transverse mus- cular fibres (Reiseissen). Mucous Membraneâ€”This is pale on the surface of the cartilaginous rings, but of a rose colour in their in- tervals, and is with difficulty removed from the subjacent parts, the epithelial covering belonging to the ciliated va- riety. Through the mucous layer the elastic tissue appears, consisting of vertical fibres, in front and late- rally being interrupted by their attachment to the

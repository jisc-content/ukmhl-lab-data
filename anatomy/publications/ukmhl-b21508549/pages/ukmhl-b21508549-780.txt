fjYO NERVOUS SYSTEM. otolithes, but which in the human subject, from their liability to fall into powder, have been called otoconia. It is supposed to be of use in increasing and condensing the perception of sound with the labyrinth. In the description of the tympanum we have already remarked, that the vibrations produced by sound on its memtat is propagated by the chain of bones direct^ to the membrane of the fenestra ovalis, and so to the fluid which fills the vestibular cavity; but in addition to this it also reaches the latter through the fenestra ro- tunda, and so through the scal^B, but in a less intensified form The bones of the head form likewise a conduct- ng medium, but it would appear that the sonorous undulations thus conveyed act only through the cochlea and of course their perception is not so well marked as in the preceding instances. The ear derives its supply of blood from the ex ternal and internal carotids, the basilar and cerebellar; its nerves are borrowed from the sympathetic, seventh, and eighth; these will be found fully described m the ■=;potions devoted to each system. . . ^ The organ of hearing is found to exist m the great maioiity of the animal series, but its development la byC means equally well marked m all.

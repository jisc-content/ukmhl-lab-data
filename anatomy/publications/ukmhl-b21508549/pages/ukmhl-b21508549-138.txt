THE OSSEOUS SYSTEM. 128 and face; it is quadrilateral in its outline, and concave, bounded externally by the crest on the great wing of the sphenoid, internally by the external pterygoid plate, an- teriorly by the tuber maxillare, and behind by the trans- verse root of the zygoma; towards its outer part it is crossed from before backwards by the external pterygoid muscle; posteriorly and internally is the small spinous hole for the artery of the same name, lying between the spinous and styloid processes of the sphenoid, and having internal to it, the groove for the Eustachian tube; anterior and a little internal to this hole is the foramen ovale, for the transmission of the inferior maxil- lary nerve, and the anterior meningeal from the pha- ryngea ascendens. The foramen ovale is bounded an- teriorly by the origin of the internal pterygoid muscle, posteriorly by the spinous and styloid processes of the sphenoid internal lateral ligament and middle me- ningeal artery, internally by the Eustachian tube, and externally by the external pterygoid muscle. As we pass still further forwards, we arrive at a remarkable cleft, broad above and narrow below,â€”the pterygo- maxillary fossa; this is bounded in front by the tuber maxillare, behind by the pterygoid plates, above by the great wing of the sphenoid, below by the junction of the superior maxillary palate and pterygoid plates, internally by the nasal plate of the palate bone; while externally it is free, and opens into the zjfgomatic fossa; this bony recess is deep, and contains the superior maxil- lary nerve, Meckel's ganglion, and the terminal stage of the internal maxillary artery. To accommodate the several parts which enter and leave it, we will accord- ingly find that several foramina are found communi- cating with it; in its roof or upper part is the foramen rotundum, through which the superior maxillary nerve enters; from its floor or lower part the posterior pala- tine canal, formed by the tuber maxillare, nasal plate of the palate, and pter3'goid processes stretch down- wards, for the transmission of the posterior palatine nerve from Meckel's ganglion; its inner wall is perfo- rated by the spheno-palatine hole, for the nerve of the same name, likewise from the ganglion to enter the supe- rior meatus of the nose; this small foramen is bounded by

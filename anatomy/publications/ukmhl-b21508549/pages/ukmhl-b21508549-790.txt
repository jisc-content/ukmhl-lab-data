tJ80 AKTERIKS AND VEINS. 1 The two coronary; 2. Arteria innominata; 3. Left clrotid; and 4. Subclavian: but as the last three will be described with the head and neck, we will conhne our attention at present to the first only, which consist of a right and left. . j • Eight Coronary arises from the anterior and right side of the arch of the aorta, between the infundibulum and right auricle. It passes backwards and downwards throu<?h the right auriculo-ventricular furrow till it reaches the upper part of the posterior yentricular groove, along which it runs to the apex of the heart, where it anastomoses with the left coronary, having, however, previously communicated with it by a cross brrnch at the point where it enters the ventricular ^""leTt Coronary arises from the anterior and left side of the aorta, above the margin of the sigmoid valve, and passing downwards and towards the left side, between Ihl infundibulum and left auricle, enters the anterior ventricular furrow, through which it runs to the apex of the heart to anastomose with the right ; as it enter, the ventricular groove it throws off a large branc^i, which winds around the base of the left ventricle, through the left auriculo-ventricular groove, to anasto- mose with the right. Remarks.-Yrom this ™^g«^,^°*V^\'',t, served that the heart is surrounded by two arterial zones -one of which encircles it from above downwards, and ihe other from side to side. From these zones branches are given off for the supply of the walls of he auricl and ventricles, the septum and ongms of the 'reat arterial trunks. In their course along the fur- rows of the heart they are always ^"^^1°?^^;" ^^^^ „^ Anomalie3.-Thej may arise by a common tiunk, or thev may be three, or even four, m number.

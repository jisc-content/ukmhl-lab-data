682 NERVOUS SYSTEM. The Tympanic Nerve of Jacobson arises from the juguhir ganglion, and enters a small canal, or some- times a lissure on the crest, which separates the carotid and jugular openings, and ascending, reaches the pro- montory on the inner wall of the tympanum, dividing in this situation into three short and three long branches, the former being thus distributed:—one to the fenestra ovalis; the second to the fenestra rotunda; and the third to the Eustachian tube: of the latter, one passes for- wards through the bone to join the carotid plexus in the canal of that name; the second runs upwards and forwards to communicate with the Vidian; while the third, which is named nervus petrosus superficialis mi- nor, passes upwards through a canal in the bone, and^ appears on the upper surface of the petrous portion of the temporal, external to the Vidian nerve, and then leaves the cranium in either of three ways,—namely, by the foramen spinosum, ovale, or by a fissure between the posterior extremity of the spine of the sphenoid and the petrous portion of the temporal bone, and then join- ing the otic ganglion as its long root. The three long branches of the tympanic nerve lie in canals on the promontory, but sometimes merely in grooves, several important communications being established by these branches, the glosso-pharyngeal being brought into relation with the sympathetic, fifth pair, and Vidian nerves. The branch of communication to the facial nerve also arises from the jugular ganglion; it passes downwards and outwards behind the styloid process, then curves up- wards and forwards, presenting a concavity looking up- wards, and joins the facial nerve just as it emerges from the stylo-mastoid foramen; communicating branches also unite the glosso-pharyngeal with the pneumogas- tric and the spinal accessory, sometimes appearing al- most incorporated with each other. Muscular Branches.—These are two in number, one being sent to the posterior belly of the digastric, the second subdividing for the stylo-hyoid and stylo- pharyugeus. Vascular Branches.—These are exceedingly small but numerous, running downwards on the carotid and

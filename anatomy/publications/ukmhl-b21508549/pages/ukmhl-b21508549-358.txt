348 THE MUSCULAR SYSTEM. arises from the inner edge, anterior surface, and exter- nal margin of the inferior fourth of the ulna; the fibres pass outwards and downwards, to be inserted into the anterior surface and outer edge of the inferior fifth of the radius. Relations.—It is covered by the superficial and deep flexor, ulnar and radial flexors, and radial artery; it lies on the interosseous ligament and bones; the muscular fibres are of different lengths; the superficial being at- tached to the distal edges of the bones, the deep, which are much shorter, to the proximal; a branch of the in- terosseal artery and nerve enters the muscle at the upper edge. Actions.—To pronate the hand, and to preserve the bones in contact; and in that fracture of the radius de- scribed by Mr. Colles it draws the fragments towards the ulna, and thus obliterates the interosseous space. The muscles on the outer side and back of the fore- arm are twelve in number, and are divided into a super- ficial and deep layer; seven in the former, five in the latter; the muscles in the former situation are,—supina- tor radii longus, extensor carpi radialis longior and bre- vior, extensor digitorum communis, extensor minimi digiti, extensor ulnaris, and anconeus; in the latter, the supinator radii brevis, extensor ossis metacarpi pollicis, extensor primi internodii pollicis, extensor secundi in- ternodii pollicis, and the extensor indicis. Supinator Eadii Longus is the most external of the svxperficial layer, and forms the fleshy mass on the outer side of the fore-arm; it arises, commencing narrow and fleshy, below the insertion of the deltoid from the exter- nal condyloid ridge, continuing adherent to the bone to within one inch and a half of the external condyle, also from the intermuscular septum, which separates it from the triceps; it forms a fleshy belly, which descends on the outer side of the elbow-joint, and about the middle of the fore-arin it becomes tendinous, and is inserted into the rough crest, sometimes a depression above the sty- loid process of the radius. Relations.—It is covered by the aponeurosis of the arm and fore-arm; it corresponds internally in the arm to the brachialis anticus and biceps tendon, from which

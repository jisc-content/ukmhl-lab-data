1 CEREBRUM. g29 which the white fibres of the crura pass to the cerebral hemispheres, as well as the posterior commissure, which enters them posteriorly and internally. Choroid Plexuses are also symmetrical, being com- posed of a fold of pia mater, and occupying the inferior cornua and bodies of the lateral ventricles. It enters the horizontal portion of the great semilunar notch at the base of the brain, which is situated between the inner edge of the middle lobe (lobule of the transverse fissure) externally, and the crus cerebri and tractus opticus in- ternally; and it passes through the inferior cornu of the lateral ventricle, having above it the optic thalamus, and below it the tsnia and pes hippocampi; it now ascends obliquely upwards and backwards, followino- the concavity of the hippocampus major in the inferior cornu, then, winding round the posterior extremity of the optic thalamus, it passes downwards, forwards, and inwards, on its superior aspect, lying in the body of the lateral ventricle, and on the outer margin of the fornix, beneath which it dips to terminate at the fora- men commune anterius, by joining the velum, with which, however, its margin is continuous for some dis- tance previously. The choroid plexus contains at its outer margin the choroid branch of the internal carotid artery, and the vein of the corpus striatum runs beneath It in Its course to the venÂ« Galeni. In structure it con- sists of the lining membrane of the ventricles, includins? a fold of pia mater, in which small cells are very often seen We have repeatedly observed them so numerous as almost wholly to obscure the vascular structure of the part. Hippocampus MmoR._Unguis or ergot lobule; lies on the inner and inferior part of the posterior cornu of the lateral ventricle, and is merely an involuted convo- lution of the brain; it is white on its surface, containing withm a large mass of grey matter, while in shape it resembles a half crescent, convex outwards and for- wards, large and round posteriorly, small and pointed m tront, where it is continuous with the fornix- im- mediately on its outer side a deep triangular fossette is tound, called digital fossa, bounded internally by the hin- pocampus minor, anteriorly by the hippocampus major

Below the symphysis is the edge of the descending ramus, bent outwards, affording attachment to the subpubic liga- ment. The anterior part of the descending ramus by some called the crest, is flattened and quadrilateral m front; it gives origin, between the spme and angle to ?he adductor longus; between the spine, angle and thyroid foramen, to the adductor brevis; stretching downwards, about its centre, from below the br^as o the tuberosity, the adductor magnus and veen it and the svmphysis, the gracilis; behind, it is mucti moother 3 c'onv'ex, and affords attachment to the pelvic fascia, levator ani, and Wilson's muscles; exter-

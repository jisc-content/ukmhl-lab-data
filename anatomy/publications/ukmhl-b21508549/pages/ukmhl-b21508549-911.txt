901 ABSORBKNTS. Lymphatic Glanbs of the Upper Extremity A few fusiform glands lie in the course of the radial and ulnar arteries, one or two beneath the basilic vein at the bend of the elbow, and a large one, sometimes double, above the internal condyle; several follow the brachial ves- sels, and in the axilla they are both numerous and large (see Anatomy of Axilla). One is always si- tuated beneath the costo-coraco-clavicular ligament, and we have seen a continuous chain of small glands on the anterior and external edge of the great pectoral muscle. Lymphatic Vessels of the Upper Extremity.â€”The superficial commence on the backs of the fingers, and ascend, becoming anterior and posterior on the fore-arm, and divided into groups internal and external, the for- mer ascending behind and before the internal condyle, and, uniting, pass through the succession of glands in the course of the brachial vessels to reach the axillary glands; the latter or external passing before and be- hind the external condyle, and, uniting, cross the arm obliquely to reach the axillary glands similar to the in- ternal; one of the external is large, and follows the course of the cephalic vein, and enters the subclavicular gland, while the deep follow the course of the vessels to the axilla, and having passed through these glands, they terminate in their respective thoracic ducts. Great Thoracic Duct commences in the abdomen in the receptaculum chyli (Pecquet), wdiich latter receives below the lymphatics of the lower half of the body, in front the lacteals, while from its superior part the duct emanates; it is about tw^o lines wide, and one inch and a quarter long, lying behind the aorta, and on the ver- tebrte and anterior vaginal ligament; from this the tho- racic duct ascends between the vena azygos and the aorta, enters the thorax through the aortic opening, running in the posterior mediastinum, still related to the above-named vessels, but opposite the third or fourth dorsal vc'rtebra, it passes behind the oesophagus and aorta, and, bending upwards and to the left side, it lies behind the origin of the left subclavian artery, and still ascending between the carotid and subclavian, it lies behind the left vena innominata and on the left edge of the oesophagus and vertebral artery, and then curving

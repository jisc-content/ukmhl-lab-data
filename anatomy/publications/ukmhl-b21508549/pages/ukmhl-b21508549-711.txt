701 BRACHIAL PLEXUS. of the ten or twelve most internal, are separated from each other by a thin fluid; but still, however, are con- nected by fine processes passing between the fibrous lamina, closely uniting them with each other. The fluid which fills the several intercapsular spaces does not communicate, and it may be discharged by puncture from one while the remainder still continue in a state of tension; but if once completely exhausted and al- lowed to dry, they will not become distended when immersed. The Avail of each capsule consists of two layers, the most internal of which contains minute oval nuclei, while the external is apparently fibrous. In the centre of the corpuscle is a hollow stalk, stretching through its long axis, and into this the nerve enters° having previously lost the white substance of Schwann^ which it had retained up to its perforation of the last capsule, and, running to the distal extremity of the stalk-like process, suddenly expands into a small knob, which affixes itself to the inner side of the cap- sule. It was once supposed that the Paccinian cor- puscles were in some way connected with the sense of touch, but their existence in several situations where this function could not possibly be exercised must com- pletely negative this idea. The Median Nerve gives off no branch in the arm, except occasionally a small anastomotic twig to the ex- ternal cutaneous, but in the fore-arm its filaments of supply are very numerous. In addition to several which perforate the elbow-joint, it distributes branches to all the muscles on the front of the fore-arm, with the excep- tion of the flexor carpi ulnaris, and half of the flexor profundus, which are supplied by the ulnar. It also throws off two, which have received distinct names,— the anterior interosseous and palmar cutaneous. The first of these is a long slender branch arising from the median at the bend of the elbow; it passes downwards on the interosseous ligament between the flexor pollicis on the outside, and the flexor profundus on the inside, giving numerous filaments to each as it descends; and iri front, and external to the artery of the same name, it runs beneath the pronator quadratus, and, dividing into two branches, one is distributed to the deep surface of

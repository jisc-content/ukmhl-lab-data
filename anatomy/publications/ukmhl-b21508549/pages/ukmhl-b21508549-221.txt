211 PHALANGEAL ARTICULATIONS. UNION OF THE METACARPAL BONES WITH THE PHALANGES. These are a series of condyloid joints, formed by the union of the heads of the metacarpal bones, which are comparatively large, with the smaller cups presented by the extremities of the first phalanges; their media of connexion are an anterior and a posterior, an inter- nal and external lateral ligament. Anterior Ligament.—This is dense and strong, attached above to the constricted neck of the metacar- pal bone, and below to the under surface of the cor- responding phalanx, it is also continuous by a thin aponeurosis with the lateral ligaments; it is grooved, and supported anteriorly by the flexor tendons, while it is concave posteriorly, for the reception of the ends of the adjacent bones. Posterior Ligament. — This is thin, occasionally scarcely capable of demonstration; it merely passes from the upper surface of one bone to the other, and is covered by the extensor tendons. External and Internal Lateral Ligaments— These are thick, strong slips, pointed posteriorly, where they are attached to the tubercles on the sides of the metacarpal bone, broader but thinner anteriorly, at their insertion into the tubercles, on the lateral surfaces of the first phalanx; their direction is forwards and down- wards, and their margins are blended with the dorsal and palmar ligaments; two sesamoid bones are found in this articulation of the thumb, into which the ten- dons of its small muscles are inserted. Synovial Membrane.—This is very lax, especially posteriorly, where it is required to be folded out in motions of flexion. phalangeal articulations. These, like the preceding, are condyloid, and have precisely similar ligaments; it would, therefore, be a needless repetition to reiterate them. The hand, constituted in the manner just described,

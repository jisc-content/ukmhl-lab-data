632 NERVOUS SYSTEM. lateral, third, and fifth ventricles; as a membrane it is thin and fine, consisting of a surface layer of pavement epithelium, ciliated according to Henle, simple, accord- ing to Hassal, beneath which is a basement membrane, but the areolar tissue which is subjacent in other situa- tions is here imperceptible. CoMMissuRA Mollis vel Media.—A transverse la- mina of grey neurine, uniting the inner and upper mar- gins of the optic thalami, corresponding above to the velum and peduncles of the pineal gland; below, to the thirdventricle; anteriorly and posteriorly, to the anterior and posterior common holes; and on tearing through its soft structure the third ventricle is exposed. Third Ventricle consists of a chink or fissure be- tween the optic thalami, deeper and wider before than behind; bounded laterally by the optic thalami, and also in the inferior half by the crura cerebri, lined by a layer of grey matter; anteriorly by the foramen commune an- terius, descending pillars of the fornix, and the anterior commissure; posteriorly by the foramen commune pos- terius, posterior commissure, pineal gland, and tubercula quadrigemina; superiorly by the commissura mollis, velum, and fornix; and inferiorly by the lamina ciuerea, optic commissura, tuber cinereum, corpora albicantia, middle perforated plate, and origin of the third nerve, or the parts from before backwards in the circle of Willis. There are three, sometimes four openings com- municating with this ventricle,—namely, foramen com- mune anterius, infundibulum, and the aqueduct of Sylvius, with occasionally the foramen commune pos- terius when it is pervious; by the first the arachnoid enters the cavity at its upper and anterior part; by the second, which commences at the central part of the floor, a connexion is established between the ventricle and the pituitary body; by the third, which commences supe- riorly and posteriorly, the arachnoid passes to the fourth ventricle. • j i f Foramen Commune Posterius.—Lies behind the sott commissure, and in front of the posterior, and bounded on each side by the horizontal peduncles of the puieal gland; it is usually cajcal, but occasionally we have seen it giving passage to a few arterial twigs, as well as a slip

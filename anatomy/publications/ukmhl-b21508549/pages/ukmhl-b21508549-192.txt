182 THE ANATOMY OP THE JOINTS. stronger than the preceding, and is composed of continu- ous fibres, but much broader below than above, and hence its name,—deltoid; it arises narrow from the inferior ex- tremity of the internal malleolus, and, passing downwards, its posterior fibres are inserted into a rough space on the inside of the astragalus, behind its articular facette,— its middle, a short dense mass, into the sustentaculum tali; and its anterior into the inner side of the scaphoid bone, becoming connected to the calcaneo-scaphoid liga- ment. Of all these processes the last is the weakest and longest, and the middle strongest and shortest; it is partially concealed by the tendons of the tibialis posti- cus and flexor communis, which cross it in their course to their insertion. In addition to those ligaments already described, the ankle-joint is surrounded by a series of others, termed annular, beneath which the several tendons run to their destination to the foot; they are three in number, called from their position, the anterior, external, and posterior or internal; the first is devoted to the extensor, the second to the perongei, and the third to the flexor, tendons. Anterior Annular Ligament.—This is quadrilate- ral in shape, but broader internally than externally; it consists of a series of strong transverse fibres, stretching obliquely from the front of the internal malleolus and scaphoid bone, downwards and outwards, to be inserted into the anterior surface of the external malleolus and OS calcis: it is composed of two layers, of which the superficial is much the stronger, united together by two septa, which leaves between them three distinct' canals for the passage of the extensor tendons; of these the most internal is occupied by the tibialis anticus, the middle by the extensor pollicis; but the two layers lie superficial to this tendon,its groove beingincomplete;and Jhe external by the extensor communis and peronseus tertius. This ligament is continuous above with the fascia of the leg, and below with the thin aponeurosis on the dorsum of the foot. External Annular Ligament.—This is short but very strong, attached above and anteriorly to the outer and back part of the external malleolus, and below and behind to the outer part of the os calcis, posterior to its

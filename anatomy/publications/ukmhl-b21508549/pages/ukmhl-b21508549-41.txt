CLAVICLE. 31 cera by compressing together the liver and lungs, and forcing downwards from their ordinary position the stomach and transverse colon. The foetal thorax is remarkable for its very great expanse inferiorly, owing to the large size of the liver, for its extreme shortness from above downwards from the non-development of the sternum, for its contraction from side to side from the want of expansion of the lungs, and for its depth from before backwards, owing to the great volume of the thymus gland and the greater comparative magnitude of the heart. These several peculiarities give to the foetal thorax a strik- ing resemblance to the same cavity in those animals where a want of the clavicle exists, viz., its flatness from side to side, and its equally obvious antero-poste- rior depth; but as the lungs expand and the thymus gland becomes atrophied, the ribs gradually assume their rounded form, and their angles begin to make their appearance, while the sternum, hitherto prominent, now commences to recede. The upper aperture, too, oval in shape, but with its long measurement antero- posteriorly, is, from the same causes, gradually length- ened from side to side, to assume that form which it is afterwards to retain; while the inferior one, from the diminished size of the liver, as contrasted with what it was at birth, is no longer conspicuous for its vast cir- cumference. The laboured respiration which often occurs in old age frequently depends on the ossification of the costal cartilages, a change to which they are very liable. Clavicle—We have now to turn our attention to a bone in the human subject which, from the important function that it performs, has been justly styled the key, as upon it depends the ready play of the arm, •which bestows upon man one of his highest attributes over the rest of the creation. It belongs to the class of long bones curved like an italic S, and stretching obliquely upwards, outwards, and backwards, from the upper part of the sternum to the acromion process. In the description of the bone it will be necessary to give it two extremities, an internal and external; two sur- faces, a superior and an inferior; and two margins, an I

293 LARYNX. in the superior and inferior cornua. The superior is long, cylindrical, and curved inwards; to the apex the thyro- hyoid ligament is attached; also to the posterior and in- ternal part the stylo and palato-pharyngei muscles; the inferior shorter than the last, but thicker and flatter, also curved forwards, articulates internally and ante- riorly by a plane surface with the side of the cricoid cartilage, and gives attachment anteriorly to the poste- rior fibres of the crico-thyroid muscle, and by its exter- nal surface to the inferior constrictor, which conceals it; to the posterior or inner surface of the angle or po- mum Adami, the stalk-like process of the epiglottis is attached; below this the superior vocal chords; exter- nal and inferior to this the thyro-arytenoid muscle; and lastly, the inferior vocal chord. The internal surface of the ala corresponds from above downwards to the ary- teno-epiglottidean folds of mucous membrane, contain- ing Hilton's muscles, superior vocal chord, thyro-ary- tenoid muscle, sacculus and ventricle of the larynx, inferior vocal chord, external to which is situated the crico-arytenoideus lateralis; also, more posteriorly, to the external angle of the arytenoid cartilage and mucous membrane, with the descending branch of the superior laryngeal nerve. In the child this cartilage is extremely small, nor are the alar tubercles developed until after puberty; previous to that period the surface is smooth, and the whole structure diaphanous. At the period of the maximum development of the male, or the thirty-first year, these tubercles become opaque from ossific depo- sits; and up to a late period of life it is only that por- tion of the cartilage below and behind the oblique ridge which becomes continuously osseous. In the anterior portion, a point or two may be visible at forty years; but after that age the upper and lower edges, also the angle, exhibit well-formed plates; between these, inter- mediate plates may pass through the ala, uniting the upper and lower margins; but in the ala a continuous osseous layer is never seen, even in advanced life. From the remark, that the development of this carti- lage occurs rapidly at the period when the voice is as- suming a grave tone, it might be inferred that its depth depended on the magnitude of the cartilage, but it will

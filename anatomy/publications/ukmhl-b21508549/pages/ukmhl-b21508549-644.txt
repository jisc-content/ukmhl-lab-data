634 NEEVOUS SYSTEM. These bodies originate in exceedingly small and bright circular discs, which, when seen with the quarter-inch object-glass, are less in size than the head of a pin ; in this appears, first one, and afterwards other divisions, indicating the compound or cellular character, which they ultimately more completely exhibit. The earthy matter entering into their composition consists of phosphate of lime, a small portion of phos- phate of magnesia, and a trace of carbonate of lime. These bodies, which are almost peculiar to the human subject, are stated not to occur in the pineal gland until after the age of seven years (Hassal's Microscopic Ana- tomy, page 535). 1 • .1 I -J We have seen similar bodies, not only m the choroid plexus, but likewise in the velum interpositum, but in- variably in old subjects. Peduncles of the Gland (Haben^).—These are four in number, two being horizontal, and a similar number vertical; the former are connected posteriorly with the transverse band of the gland, which lies above the pos- terior commissure, then, diverging and passing forwards above the inner margins of the optic thalami, they join the descending pillars of the fornix; the latter or vertical peduncles can only be seen by making a longitudinal vertical section of the brain; they arise from the base ot the gland, and, passing downwards on the inner and pos- terior part of the optic thalami, are lost on the back part of the floor of the third ventricle. Descartes believed the pineal gland to be the seat ot the soul, and Magendie conceived the equally absurd opinion, that it acted as a plug to the iter a tertio ad quartum ventriculum. i i + TuBERCULA QuADRtGEMiNA.—A quadrilateral plate of medullary structure, lying on the superior suriace ot the pons varolii; covered by the velum interpositum, pineal gland, and posterior commissure, and correspona- ing behind to the valve of Vieussens and the processus a cerebello ad testes, whilst it is related anteriorly to the third ventricle and posterior commissure. -^A^e su- perior surface is divided by an antero-postenor hssure Is well as a transverse, which latter is semilunar t e concavity being directed forwards, thus producmg four

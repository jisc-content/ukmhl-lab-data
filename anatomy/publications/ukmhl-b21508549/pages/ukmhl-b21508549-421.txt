T 2 PENIS. 41 1 and corona, wliere it anastomoses with the deep dorsal artery. Dorsal Cutaneous Veins—These are tegumentary, and commence by numerous radicles from the prepuce' run backwards, receiving all the cutaneous branches from the inferior part of the organ, which are most nu- merous in that situation, then communicate with the superficial pudic, and at the pubis dip deep to join the proper dorsal vein. The lateral cutaneous nerves are derived from the dorsal, and run downwards, formino- arches, the convexity directed forwards, and commu- nicating with the long perineal and pudendal, which have been already described in the anatomy of the Pe- rineum. True Suspensory Ligament.—This fibrous layer is strong, dense, and triangular, attached posteriorly to the symphisis pubis, where it is continuous with the de- cussating fibres of the external oblique tendon, and is iully one inch and a half in depth; the anterior supe- rior edge is free and round; the inferior and posterior IS split, and expands to invest the organ with a dense unyielding covering which binds down the dorsal vein and artery, also the nerve between the layers of this ligament. There sometimes exists a thin flat band of muscular fibre, described by the late Dr. Houston in this situation; it arises from the rami of the pubis and ischium; passes upwards and inwards, and unites in a common tendon with its fellow over the dorsal vein of the penis; but, although constant in the lower animals such IS not the case in the human subject, as in forty- five subjects their existence could only once be fairly demonstrated. The deep fibres of the suspensory U<rl ment, with attachments similar to those muscles, are often confounded with them, but the former are of a similar structure m their entire course, whilst the lat ter are three-fourths fleshy, and the remainder tendi nous; they are separated from the accelerator urinse where it turns over the dorsum of the penis by the ex- pansion of the suspensory ligament, and from the erector penis by the crus. Use.—To compress the dorsal vein of the penis and prevent the return of venous blood. On the dorsum of

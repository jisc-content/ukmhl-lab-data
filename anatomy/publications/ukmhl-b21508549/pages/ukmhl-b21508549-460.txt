THE MUSCULAR SYSTEM, 450 ists in its integrity as a sheath to preserve the position of the muscles, and to control their movements, but without subjecting them to any injurious pressure. Superiorly it is attached to Poupart's ligament, crest of the ilium, tubercles on the back of the sacrum, ascend- ing ramus of the ischium, and descending ramus and symphisis of the pubis; inferiorly and anteriorly to the patella, the involucrum of the knee-joint, which it assists in forming; and posteriorly it passes over the popliteal space, adhering to those tendons which form its lateral boundaries, to become continuous with the fascia of the leg- externally it sends a process between the vastus externus in front, and the glutseus maximus, and short head of the biceps behind, constituting the external in- termuscular septum, which is attached to the outer side of the linea aspera from the great trochanter to the external condyle; immediately above the latter it is thick and round, and can be traced downwards, cover- ing and adhering to the external lateral hgament of the knee-ioint; this septum is strong, but weaker above than below in the former situation; it is pierced by the posterior branches of the external circumflex, and m the latter by the superior external articular artery; a similar process is sent in on the internal side between the vastus internus anteriorly, and the adductors pos- teriorly, attached from the root of the lesser trochanter to the internal condyle; like the former, it is strong be- low where it becomes thick, round, and incorporated with the tendon of the adductor magnus, becoming con- tinuous with the internal lateral ligament of the knee- ioint; this is pierced above by the internal circumflex, next in order by the first and second perforating, then by the profunda femoris, the third and fourth perfora- ting the femoral artery and vein, and lastly, by the Snal superior articular. A thin sheet also sinks deep to separate the adductors from the Pos^ior layer ot muscles; thus there are three S^-'eaJ sheaths one ante- rior, the second posterior, and the third ^'^^^'if j^^ dividing the muscles into anterior, "^^-f' ^^^f^f;, rior sets- with very few exceptions each muscle has iTeJfse its special sLath derived ^^^^^^^^^^ we prefer to describe these with each distinct muscle

416 THK MUSCULAR SYSTEM. Structure This is similar to the cavernous bodies; but here it is expanded into a thin layer, hollowed in the centre, forming the urethra. On the superficial surface some reddish longitudinal fibres are seen, con- ceived by Home, Wilson, and Hunter, to be muscular; but this opinion is, however, erroneous. Development of the Penis.—This appears about the sixth week as a small papilla in front of the anus, and, advancing forwards, exhibits inferiorly a canalicular depression; at the second month two prominent folds appear on either side,—the rudiments ol' the future scro- tum or labia; in the fourth month the canalicular cleft is closed, and becomes the urethra; and lastly, the la- teral folds coalesce in the middle of the fifth month, constituting the raphe of the scrotum; but the corpora cavernosa do not attain their full degree of develop- ment until the period of puberty arrives. THE BLADDER AND ITS APPENDAGES. To examine the urinary bladder, the student should make a lateral section of the pelvis by sawing through the pubis, half-an-inch to the right side of the symphisis, then separating the ligaments on the right side and pressing the organ towards the left, sawing through the sacrum on a line with the pubic section; he should fill the rectum with hair or tow, and inflate the blad- der from the ureter, and afterwards secure it with a ligature. The bladder in foetal life is situated in the abdomen; but as the pelvis expands in the infant, it sinks to the lower part of the hypogastric region, and on its still further expansion falls into the cavity of the true pelvis, where it is found in the adult. In the foetus its outline is cylindrical, in the infant pyra- midal, the base above, the apex inferiorly at the neck, which at that period is the most dependent portion of the viscus; but in the adult, in consequence of the de- velopment of the inferior fundus, the figure is reversed, the "bas fond" being the most dependent part; but the cervix can be made so by a slight inclination of the body forwards. In the empty state the organ is trian- gular, the base inferiorly; and when in a condition of or-

On the body of the third dorsal vertebra the latter divides into two branches of unequal diameters, the right being the lar- ger, shorter and more transverse; the left longer, smaller, and more in the direction of the original tube; the for- mer, in its course to reach the hilus of the lung, lies on the right side of the oesophagus, and crosses the vena azygos; in front, corresponding to the pericardium and right pulmonary artery, which separates the vena cava from the tube, while the left bronchus crosses the (Esopha- gus and aorta, lying posterior to the pericardium, pulmo- nary veins, and artery. On entering the h\ng the tubes divide into two branches, the inferior on the right side again subdividing for the middle and inferior lobes; a dichotomous division occurs in the substance of the organ for about fifteen repetitions, the terminal tiibes then entering their proper lobules where their ultimate ramifications are situated. Structure of the Bronchial Tubes.â€”The extra-pulmo- monary portion, and also as far as the tertiary divisions in the lung, present the same anatomical elements as the trachea, consisting of a series of rings, forming each about three-fourths of a circle, and incomplete pos- teriorly. These rings terminate in blunted points, the space between them being occupied by mucous mem- brane, glands, elastic tissue with well-marked longitu- dinal fibres; and lastly, with a transverse muscular layer, from within outwards; the margins of the ring being also united to each other by mucous membrane and elastic tissue. Subsequent to the tertiary subdivi- sion, the structural anatomy undergoes a peculiar mo- dification, the cartilaginous rings completely surround- ing the tube, but yet the circle being composed of se- parate segments, three or four in number, with angular extremities, or notched, united by mutual reception, but always admitting of a certain amount of overlapping, which is more evident when the tube has been artifi- cially contracted by exhaustion of the air it may con- tain. The muscular layer assumes a circular arrange- ment, and the elastic tissue is still visible as elevated longitudinal fibres, while the mucous membrane is less vascular, fine, and thinner than that of the primary sub-

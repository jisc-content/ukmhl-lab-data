NERVOUS SYSTEM. 660 gives off immediately after its origin the sliort root to the lenticular ganglion, and then running beneath the optic nerve, and on the ocular surface of the inferior rectus, winds round the outer margin of that muscle, and, sinking beneath it, supplies the ocular aspect of the inferior oblique; the second, or middle branch, lies at first on the inferior rectus, near its back part, into which it sinks also on the ocular aspect; whilst the third or internal, larger than the last, and flattened transversely, passes inwards beneath the optic nerve, and above the inferior rectus, and supplies the deep surface of the internal rectus. It will be seen that the third nerve supplies five out of the seven muscles in the orbit, all on that aspect which is turned towards the eye, and from the peculiar relation which the nerve bears immediately after its origin to the cerebral and cerebellar arteries, affections of its motor function are frequently associated with cerebral vascular derange- ment, producing a drooping of the upper eyelid, or pto- sis ; but in addition to the levator palpebrae, all the other muscles supplied by the nerve participate in the loss of power, the eye being, therefore, drawn downwards and outwards by the external rectus and superior oblique, which possess an independent nervous supply. Fourth or Trochleator Nerves, sometimes called pathetici, are extremely small and fine, like a thread; they arise usually by two filaments, from the valve of Vieussens and the processus a cerebello ad testes, but nearer to th6 latter bodies, a transverse white band oc- casionally acting as a commissure between them, and here they are covered by the velum iuterpositum, and lie on the valve of Vieussens; then, passing forwards and outwards, winding round the meso-cephale, they appear between the cerebrum and cerebellum, enter a canal be- tween the lamintB of the tentorium, and, being received between the layers of the outer wall of the cavernous sinus, they lie at first above the ophthalmic and below the third, but after some distance they mount above the latter; then entering the sphenoidal fissure at its base, between the periosteum above, and the frontal nerve inferiorly and externally, and crossing the superior rec- tus and levator palpebra% they become flattened, and are

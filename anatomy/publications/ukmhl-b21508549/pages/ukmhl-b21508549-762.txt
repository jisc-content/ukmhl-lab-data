NERVOUS SYSTEM. 752 forming an imperfect septum between the anterior and posterior chambers, it presents two margins,—the ex- ternal or ciliary, which is thick, receiving fibres from the cornea elastica anterior, and is attached to the cili- ary ligament; the second or papillary edge surrounds the pupil, and is thin and well defined. The anterior surface presents a striated aspect, numerous fibres con- verging from the external to within ^\th. of an inch of the pupil, where they terminate in a circular set of ■ knotted and much thicker elevations, from which again branching filaments pass inwards to the verge of the pupil; the posterior surface is dark, being tinged by the pigmentum nigrum, constituting the uvea, whilst , the external third of the posterior surface lies in con- tact with the ciliary processes. The structure of the iris consists of the arched branches of the long ciliary arteries with the ciliary nerves; and so great is its vas- cularity that some authorities consider its structure to be erectile. The principal fibres composing it run from the ciliary towards the pupillary edge, whilst near the latter a fasciculus of circular fibres may also "be de- tected, these last being very apparent in birds, and of the striped variety of muscular structure, but m man undoubtedly unstriped. Now it has been supposed that the radiating fibres are merely elastic, whilst the circular are muscular,—belladonna acting by paralyzing the circular set, whilst the elastic, still preserving intact their physical property, dilate the pupil. But although these fibres are evidently unstriped, still, pathologically they are allied to the voluntary muscles; lor in coma, which paralyzes only the latter, the pupil is unitormly di- lated. Although motor filaments derived from the motor oculi can be traced to the iris, still the mechanical stimuli which excite muscular contraction fail to produce that effect in the pupil which is sometimes evidenced during the operation for cataract; for when the needle acci- dentally pierces the iris it remains perfectly quies- cent, and it is only by acting on the retina that con- tractions can be induced. The iris is immovable in fishes, and of a green colour, the pupil being angular, while in the horse a thin membrane exists, which passes across the pupil like a curtain, giving it an opaline

CEREBRUM. 639 and consisting of granular cells imbedded in fibrous lo- culi; the latter soft, -with larger cells, and a smaller amount of fibrous tissue, and it receives the pointed ex- tremity of the infundibulum. This body sometimes contains a cavity, but usually the centre is occupied by a yellowish-white substance, and is much larger in all the lower order of vertebrata than in man, and in the for- mer always containing a cavity. It is also much larger at the middle of intra-uterine life than at birth, and at the former period a central ampulla exists, which com- municates with the third ventricle. The use of this body is still obscure, some believing it to be a ganglion of the sympathetic (Budge); others, glandular, as Monroe; but neither of these opinions are supported by the exa- mination of its structure. Corpora ALBicANxrA vel Candicantia, are two small hemispherical bodies, lying in front of the middle perforated plate, and behind the tuber cinereum, receiv- ing superiorly the descending pillars of the fornix, and being separated from each other by a deep fissure, pro- ducing that symmetrical arrangement peculiar to man and the carnivora; as in other vertebrata they form a single and undivided body. Middle Perforated Plate.—A triangular lamina of medullary substance, bounded laterally by the crura cerebri, to which it is attached; before, by the corpora albicantia; and posteriorly, by the pons varolii. Its su- perior surface corresponds to the third ventricle; whilst the inferior gives origin to the third pair of nerves, and is marked by several openings through which small ar- terial twigs enter the cavity of the third ventricle. Pons Varolii—So called from the fact of its being stretched like a bridge of communication between the •cerebrum, cerebellum, and the medulla oblongata. Cu- boid in figure, it presents six sides: a superior and infe- rior, two lateral, with an anterior and a posterior sur- face, superiorly corresponding to the tubercula quadri- gemina, with the iter a tertio ad quartum ventriculum ■ mferiorly, to the basilar process of the occipital bone' dura mater, sixth pair of nerves, with the basilar ar- tery, running in a mesian groove, and superior cerebel- lar arteries; laterally, to the crura cerebelli, with the

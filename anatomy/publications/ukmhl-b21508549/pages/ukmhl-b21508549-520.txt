510 CAVITY OF THE CHEST. a smooth and glistening surface, being lined by a proper serous layer, which, like other membranes of the same class, forms a shut sac, and consists of a parietal and visceral portion, with a perfect continuity of structure subsisting between them. This membrane may be traced upwards on the posterior surface of the anterior wall of the fibrous pericardium, from which it is re- flected on the three great vessels at the base of the heart, inclosing the aorta and pulmonary artery m a common sheathâ€”complete anteriorly and posteriorly, but deb- cient where these vessels are in contact, a circunistance accounted for by the fact, that they originally formed but a single trunk, the subsequent development of sep- tal wall producing the division into the distinct aorta and pulmonary artery, from an inch and a half to two inches of both vessels being inclosed within the serous sheath. The superior cava is covered only on the an- terior and right side, but not posteriorly; and this in- vestment only extends for one inch of the vessel, or to that point where the vena azygos opens into its cavity. It may then be carried over the anterior surface of the heart down to its apex, round that point to its poste- rior surface, covering the inferior cava and the pulmo- nary veins on the anterior and lateral surfaces, but not posteriorly, then up to the posterior surface of the Lrta and pulmonary artery, from this to the pericar- dium, and round its posterior part to the base, then to the anterior surface to the point where the description commenced.

FEMUH. 61 arising where the insertion of the former terminates; its internal lip to the vastus internns adductor longus magnus. Its inferior extremity likewise bifurcates into two roots: an external, rough and well-marked, and terminating at the external condyle for the attach- ment of the vastus externus and biceps; an internal, only visible above and below, but smooth in the centre for the femoral artery to glide over it, and running to the inner condyle, has connected to it the vastus in- ternus and adductor magnus. At the inner side of the linea aspera, a little below the centre of the bone, is the large hole for the nutritious artery, passing up- wards and forwards; this is sometimes double.Â° The lower part of the femur continues to increase gradually in size till it terminates in the two condyles, in struc- ture becoming exceedingly cellular; anteriorly it is broad and concave, perforated by several foramina, and sometimes covered by a bursa, over which the subcru- rseus glides. Posteriorly it is flattened and triangular m figure, corresponding to the popliteal region, and presenting two roughened spaces above the condyle for the origin of the plantaris and outer head of the gas- trocnemius externally, and for the inner head of the latter muscle internally. The bone is more expanded on Its outside than its inside, where it is covered by the aponeurosis of the two vasti. The two condyles which occupy the inferior extremity of the femur are large and prolonged backwards, separated from each other by a space in front; broad, concave, and covered with cartilage for articulation with the patella; a simi- lar space likewise exists posteriorly, but it is deeper and narrower, not covered with cartilage, and in the natural condition of the parts filled with fat, alFordino- insertion to the crucial and mucous ligaments. The two condyles, if contrasted with each other, present the following difference: the internal is thinner, longer and proceeds much farther backwards, while the ex- ternal IS much thicker, advances prominently forwards and is covered with cartilage much higher up. On the outer side of the last, interiorly and posteriorly is si- tuated a small eminence for the attachment of the external lateral ligament, and beneath it a groove for

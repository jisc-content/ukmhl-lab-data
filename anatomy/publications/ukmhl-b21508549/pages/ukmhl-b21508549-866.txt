ARTERIES AND VEINS. 856 Relations—First Stage, or Scarpa's Space.—Anteri- orly, integument, superficial fascia, with lymphatic glands, fascia lata, crural branch of genito-crural nerve, and sartorius; posteriorly, psoas muscle, which separates it from the capsular ligament of the hip-joint, pecti- neus, adductor brevis, but with the interposition of the profunda artery, femoral, profunda, and external cir- cumflex veins, communicating branch between internal saphenous and obturator nerves, and loose areolar tissue, and ultimately adductor longus; externally, anterior crural nerve above, and edge of sartorius below; and in- ternally, its own vein superiorly, and adductor inferiorly. Relations—Second Stage, or Hunter's Canal.—Anteri- orly, sartorius and strong aponeurosis, the latter stretched in inverted arches between the vastus internus and ad- ductorslongus andmagnus, and internal saphenous nerve; posteriorly, the conjoined tendons of the adductors, vas- tus internus, and femoral vein; internally, the former; and externally, the latter muscle. Remarks.—Ks it is a matter of some importance to define the point where the femoral artery emerges from beneath Poupart's ligament, it may be stated, as a ge- neral rule, that it descends about two inches and a half from the spine of the pubis, and three from the ante- rior superior spine of the ilium. In a well-formed man, when in the upright position, if a plumb-line is allowed to fall from this point perpendicularly downwards,_ it will very nearly map out the course of the vessel, which will be, however, slightly external to it, the twist m the femur giving an apparent, but not a real, curve to the artery. On examining its relative position with re-rard to its vein, we will find, that immediately below Poupart's ligament the latter lies directly internal to it, but as they continue to descend the vein gradually in- clines behind it, so as to lie completely posterior to it, in the middle of Hunter's canal, and slightly external as it passes from that canal into the poplita^al region. The student should also remember that, in the iisual condition of the limb, although the insertions of the pectineus and adductor brevis are given as posterior relations for the artery, still they are really at some distance from it, and the thigh must be forcibly rotated

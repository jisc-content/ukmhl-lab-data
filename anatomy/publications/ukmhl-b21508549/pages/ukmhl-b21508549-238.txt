228 THE MUSCULAR SYSTEM. this muscle is so intimately connected with the orbicu- laris that it appears as an additional origin of it, which accounts for the concerted action that so frequently exists between them. Tensor Tarsi (Horner's muscle) is dissected by di- viding vertically the upper and lower lid, and reflecting the internal flaps towards the nose; the conjunctiva should then be raised and the areolar tissue removed; it arises from the crest on the os unguis, behind the lachrymal groove, passes forwards and outwards, divides into two slips, which are inserted into the lachrymal ducts, being prolonged as far as the puncta. Relatiom It corresponds anteriorly and internally to the lachrymal sac and tendo oculi; externally and posteriorly, to the conjunctiva and areolar tissue. It is conceived by many authorities to be merely a deep origin of the orbicularis palpebrarum, but it appears to be a distinct muscle, and is always present, at least, we have never observed its absence. Action.â€”To compress the lachrymal sac; also, it may draw the puncta backwards, placing them in a favour- able position to receive the tears. As it is the natural course to examine the lachrymal apparatus in this stage of the dissection, we prefer to sacrifice arrangement to convenience. The portion of the appendages of the eye which can now be examined with advantage are the eyelids, brows, the lachrymal sac, and nasal duct; this may be done on the opposite side, which is still untouched. The Eyelids are two pendulous curtains, which cover, when closed, the anterior surface of the globe, but in their ordinary condition are separated by an elliptical space, of varying magnitude in different indi- viduals; those curtains are of unequal size, the superior being three times as large as the inferior, which rarely extends above the margin of the cornea; the superior is bounded above by an arch of hairs, directed obliquely outwards, sometimes meeting across the dorsum of the nose, but generally a space intervenes where they are deficient; the integument in which they are set is thick and strong, and this is again supported by the orbicu- laris and corrugator supercilii muscles, from which it is

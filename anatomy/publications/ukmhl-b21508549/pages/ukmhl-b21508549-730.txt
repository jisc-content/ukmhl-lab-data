NERVOUS SYSTEM. 720 side of the great toe; the second to the cleft between the first and second toes, where it divides into two to sup- ply their opposed surfaces; the third to the cleft be- tween the second and third toes, where a similar divi- sion also takes place for their opposed sides, while the fourth runs to the cleft between the third and fourth, supplying their adjacent surfaces in the same manner, and generally throwing off an anastomotic twig to the external plantar. In addition to those digital branches it also gives filaments to the contiguous muscles, several to the skin on the inner side of the sole of the foot, and others to the articulations in its vicinity. The External Plantar Nerve is much smaller than the internal-, it crosses the foot obliquely forwards and outwards, also in a dense fibrous canal between the flexor digitorum brevis and musculus accessorius, then turns forwards between the flexor digitorum brevis and flexor minimi digiti, and at the base of the meta- tarsal bone of the little toe divides into two branches,— a superficial and deep: the former continues its course forwards, and subdividing into two, the most external is distributed to the outer side of the lesser toe, while the internal, on reaching the cleft between the fourth and fifth, also divides into two for the supply ot their opposed surfaces; the latter or deep branch accompa- nies the external plantar artery, sinking deep y beneath the three first layers of the plantar muscles, and throwing off branches to the adductor poUicis, transversus pedis lumbricales, interossei, and musculus accessorius, with a few articular filaments. _ While in the popliteal space the posterior tibial nerve gives off three twigs to the joint, viz., superior and in- ferior articular, and azygos; these accompany the arte- ries of the same name, supplying the inner and posterior part of the articulation. It also here throws off a remark- able branch,_the communicans tibialis, which, pass- in- downwards and outwards beneath the fascia at first, and then between the heads of the gastrocnemi s, um^^^^^ at variable distances on the back of the leg, with a .ma twi-from the peroneal,—communicans peronei; tlitir twi"'troni \nti ut^iuuciii,— —- . , junction constituting the posterior or -^^ernal saj^^^^^ nous nerve, which descends in company with its corre

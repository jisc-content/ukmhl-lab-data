FEMORAL HERNIA. 435 from, the muscle of that name, and the external iliac ar- tery and vein cleaned from the peritoneal and fascial in- vestment. The crural arch is that space included be- tween Poupart's ligament in front and the bone poste- riorly; it is son\ewhat triangular, the base externally, and the apex at Gimbernaut's ligament; most externally the external or musculo-cutaneous nerve passes beneath the ligament, which, with the origin of the sartorius, assists in closing the crural arch at this point; next in order the iliacus internus, anterior crural nerve, then the psoas magnus, the outer wall of the sheath of the ves- sels, next the femoral artery, the middle septum, the femoral vein, internal septum crurale, the femoral ring filled by a gland, through which pass the deep lympha- tics, also the crural branch of the genito-crural nerve, and lastly, Gimbernaut's ligament. Now continue the dissection of the fascia of the thigh. The fascia lata is divided into three portions,â€”iliac, pubic, and cribriform; the iliac is the most external and the strongest; it is likewise on a plain anterior to the pubic, and is attached above to the crest of the ilium and the lower edge of Poupart's ligament, as far inwards as the base of Gim- bernaut's ligament; the internal edge is lunated, form- ing the falciform process of the fascia lata, the concavity looking downwards and inwards, and is divided into a superior cornu (Hey's ligament), and an inferior cornu (Burns's ligament), with an intervening edge; the su- perior cornu is of different strengths, being thick in the male adult, thin and often separated into bands in the female and child, attached superiorly to Poupart's liga- ment, at the internal fifth of which it divides into two processes : one superficial, thin, is prolonged downwards and inwards on the pubic portion of the fascia lata (Colles's ligament, see Flood on Hernia); the second, stronger, dips backwards, and is attached to the linea ileo-pectinea and base of Gimbernaut's ligament (Hey), which lies in front and internal to the femoral ring; the inferior cornu is sharp and well defined; it unites with the pubic portion to form the saphenic opening, the whole arch being described by some authors as consti- tuting the saphenic aperture; but it is much better to restrict that term to the inferior portion only, formed u 2 4

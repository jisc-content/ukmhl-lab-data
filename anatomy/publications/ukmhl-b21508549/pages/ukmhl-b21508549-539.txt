SUPERIOR APERTURE OF THORAX. 529 diverging. On these muscles branches of the omohyoid plexus descend to supply their origins, each being in- vested by a thin layer of fascia; beneath these the left and right vena innominatee are disclosed, the left vena innominata being from two and a half to three inches in length, commencing opposite to the sterno-clavicular articulation by the union of the left jugular and sub- clavian veins, passes obliquely towards the right side, and at the upper edge of the cartilage of the second rib lorms the descending cava by its confluence with the right. In this course it presents a curve, the concavity looking upwards and backwards, and crosses the fol- Wng parts from left to right:—Left internal mam- mary artery and phrenic nerve, left pneumogastric nerve subclavian artery, thoracic duct, left carotid, arch of the aorta, with cardiac nerves, trachea, arteria innominata and right pneumogastric nerve. The parts superficial to It are, the left sterno-clavicular articulation, sternum sterno-hyoid, and thyroid muscles, and the remains of the thymus gland, a layer of fascia also covering and connecting it to the aorta, which ultimately becomes continuous with the fibrous layer of the pericardium- It receives a number of branches in its course, —namely' the descending thyroid, sometimes the left vertebral and superior intercostal, with the internal mammary vein of the left side. The right vena innominata is one inch and a halt m length, commencing opposite the rio-ht sterno-clavicular articulation, a little higher than the lelt; It passes downwards and inwards, to reach the left at the origin of the cava, corresponding on the ri<.ht side to the lung, pleura, and phrenic nerve; on the ?eft to the origm of the subclavian, from which it is sepa- rated by the pneumogastric nerve; also to the arteria innominata; anteriorly it is covered by the sterno-cla- vicular articulation and cartilage of the first rib also by the remains of the thymus gland, whilst posteriorly It rests on the right wall of the anterior mediastinum and pneumogastric nerve, which is at first internal and subsequently behind it. This vein is smaller than that of the left side, the vertebral sometimes open ing into Its termination, and occasionally the rio-ht i lerior thyroid veins; posterior to these the arteria in". 2 A

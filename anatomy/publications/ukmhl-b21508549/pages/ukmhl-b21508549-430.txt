THE MUSCULAR SYSTEM. 420 of the false ligaments, stretching them on its surface. This serous coat is but loosely attached, and in the col- lapsed condition of the bladder, it presents many trans- verse rugae, particularly posteriorly. The cellular tunic is derived from the vesical fascia, splitting to invest the organ; it adheres most intimately to the subjacent mus- cular fibres, sending processes to invest the several fas- ciculi, and sinking deep to be attached to the deep cel- lular coat; it is strong where the organ is deficient of serous covering, and particularly so where it forms the recto-vesical layer at the base of the bladder, and sup- ports the veins in that situation. The muscular coat is well marked, and much redder in colour than the fibres of the small or large intestines; but it somewhat resembles those of the rectum and oesophagus, at least in colour and thickness; this, although forming one uninterrupted plane, still, in consequence of difference in direction and arrangement, is described as consisting of longitudinal, oblique, circular, and reticular planes or sets. The longitudinal are strong and distinct on the anterior and posterior surfaces; they arise from the urachus, and descend on the fore and back part of the orcran; those on the side are oblique in direction, and evidently merely the longitudinal fibres deviating from their usual direction; but although the urachus is stated as the superior attachment, still on either side of it, numbers may be seen, looped, passing over the suni- mit, both anterior and posterior fibres being conti- nuous; and again, others are observed to dip deep, like the cardiac fibres at the apex of that organ, to reach the deep reticular layer. In one case, where there was a very slight thickening of the muscular tunic, the ar- rangement at the summit forcibly reminded us of the crucial weaving of the " apicial" bands of the heart m their anatomy. The inferior termination of these fibres may be divided into anterior, posterior, and lateral, and each acrain subdivided into a superficial and deep layer :â€” anterior superficial, strong and interlaced, sometimes, but by no means constantly, decussating, are inserted into the symphisis pubis by the anterior ligaments, which are sometimes described as the tendons of these muscles; anterior deep are few, and weaker than the

630 NERVOUS SYSTEM. m and externally by the medullary substance; this space is subject to much variation as to size, and is sometimes absent. Hippocampus Major is situated in the inferior cornu of the lateral ventricle, being variously known as the cornu ammonis, or foot of the seahorse. It is a conoidal eminence, curved on itself, having its larger extremity turned downwards and forwards, either bulbous or di- vided by a notch into two tubercles (pes hippocampi), a third or smaller tubercle often being visible above the last (pes accessorius); the smaller end is directed up- wards and backwards, then curves forwards to be con- tinuous with the fornix; its concave surface looks for- wards and inwards, bordered by the taenia or corpus fimbriatum; it consists of an external white capsule, derived from the corpus callosum, and an internal mass of grey matter, and it resembles the hippocampus mi- nor in being an involuted convolution of the brain. TiENiA Hippocampi, or Corpus FiMBRiATUii, is seen by raising the choroid plexus, which usually conceals it ; this small, flat, white band lies in the concavity of the hippocampus major, arising below from the pes, and then, passing upwards and backwards, terminates in the posterior root of the fornix. Fascia Dentata is seen by raising the inner margin of thetsenia; it is immediately connected with the inner edge of the hippocampus major, and consists of a linear band of grey substance, indented or crenated at the in- ternal margin, and hence the name fascia dentata. Let the student now recur to the examination ot tne velum interpositum, the relative anatomy of which Has already been disposed of, except that of its inferior sur- face, and also the contents of the fold, viz., vena^ Galeni, arachnoid canal, and pineal gland. VENiE Galeni are formed by the choroid and striate vein, the former commencing posteriorly and then mn- Bing forwards, having received the veins from tl e two hip?ocampi, the latter also commencing poster orly and coursing forwards in the groove between the corpus stril urn and optic thalamus, under the t^"^.Â«^- cularis, and at the foramen commune anterius both un te to form the ven^ galeni; these latter, sometimes single,

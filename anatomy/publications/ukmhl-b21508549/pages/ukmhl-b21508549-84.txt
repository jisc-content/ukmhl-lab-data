THE OSSEOUS SYSTEM. 74 convex for the second metatarsal bone; on its internal side is a small triangular facette, for uniting with the internal, and on its outer side a similar one for the ex- ternal cuneiform bones; these are of a triangular shape and small, situated near the upper margins, while the lower part of each surface is very rough, for the attach- ment of ligaments. Its apex presents a sharp, well- defined edge, which is concealed by the approximation of the two bones on either side, while its base is almost flat, but rough for the attachment of ligaments. It articulates with four bones also: the scaphoid be- hind, the second metatarsal bone in front, and the inter- nal and external cuneiform bones laterally. The External Cuneiform is intermediate in size be- tween the two last described, and presents for examina- tion the same parts. On its posterior extremity we observe a plane, oval facette, covered with cartilage, for articu- lation with the scaphoid; on its anterior another, trian- gular and slightly convex,for the third metatarsal bone; on its internal surface it has two, one posteriorly, for the middle cuneiform, and one anteriorly, for the second metatarsal bone; on its external two are likewise ob- served the posterior, large, flat, and triangular, for the cuboid; and an anterior, much smaller, oval, for the fourth metatarsal bone; its apex, which is turned down- wards, is more rounded than that of the preceding, affording origin to one head of the flexor pollicis brevis; its base, forming a part of the dorsum of the foot, is rough for the insertion of ligaments. The external cuneiform articulates with six bones: the scaphoid posteriorly; the third metatarsal an- teriorly; the second metatarsal and middle cuneiform internally; and the fourth metatarsal and cuboid ex- ternally. T 1 jr All the tarsal bones just described are developed trom a single point of ossification, with the exception of the OS calcis, which has two ; the first being primitive for the anterior part, and the second for the calx or The Metatarsal Bones are five in number, and all belong to the class of long bones. Their posterior extre- mities are thick and clubbed, and articulate with the tar-

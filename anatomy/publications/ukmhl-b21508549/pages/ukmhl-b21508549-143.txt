THE NOSE. 133 which the nerve of Cotunnius passes to reach the in- cisive fossa, to assist in forming the ganglion of Clo- quet. The nasal duct, the orifice of which is situated a little posterior to the extremity of the inferior spongy- bone, and three-quarters of an inch from the anterior nares, is the canal through which the tears are trans- mitted from the inner can thus of the eye to the nose, beino-, in fact, nothing more than the continuation downwards of the lachrymal sac. It is about three-quar- ters of an inch in length, curved, with the convexity turned forwards and inwards, its direction being at first downwards and forwards, and then backwards and out- wards. Three bones enter into its formation, the nasal process of the superior maxillary, the os unguis, and inferior turbinated bone, the canal which is left between them being capable of admitting a large probe. At the posterior extremity of the inferior spongy bone, and lying against the inner side of the internal pterygoid plate, the nasal extremity of the Eustachian tube is ob- served, but as this will be minutely examined in the description of the pharynx, we will defer its considera- tion till we are treating of that region. Anatomists have conferred the name of the Schnei- derian membrane on the mucoiis lining of the nose, from the individual who first properly described it. In front it is continuous with the skin, while behind there can be drawn no direct line of division between it and what is found in the pharynx; extremely thin and firmly ad- herent to the bony structures of the canals and sinuses which it lines, it becomes absolutely incorporated with the periosteum, and hence its name of fibro-mucous; but on the septum and spongy bones, particularly to- wards their posterior parts, its character is completely changed, becoming in those situations dense and thick. This increase of development is due to, in a great mea- sure, the numerous vascular plexuses, especially venous, which are found in this part, as well as to a multitude of glands which are here found in vast numbers. In its external characters likewise, the mucous membrane dif- fers in the several parts of the cavity in which we may examine it, in front exhibiting a scaly appearance very similar to that of the skin with which it is continuous,

The anterior or right, as well as the left valves, are attached to a thick fleshy band connected to the anterior wall of the ventricle, whilst the posterior, smaller than the last, and more fixed, is attached to the septal wall by chordae tendineaj only. The left valve is generally described as separating the auricular and ar- terial openings (septum of Lieutaud), and so preventing the escape of the blood into the pulmonary artery until the ventricle is fully distended, but this assertion is perfectly gratuitous; firstly, because the distance of fully three-quarters of an inch intervenes between the openings; secondly, because the pulmonary artery is in its systolic movement with the semilunar valves thrown down at the moment the ventricle is being filled; and the third objection, the most important, being that the wide portion of the valve does not separate the openings, but is much more anterior, the narrow posterior edge only intervening between them. Mr. King has attri- buted a very important function to the anterior valves both left and right; these being attached by their free margins to the anterior or moveable wall of the ventri- cle, it follows, that during excessive distention they are prevented from accurately closing the auricular openino-, thus permitting regurgitation to ensue, and obviating that paralysis which would necessarily result from over- distention. The origin of the pulmonary artery occurs from the anterior superior and left side of the base of the right ventricle, that cavity being prolonged upwards at this point as the infundibuliform process (the arterial por- tion of the ventricle). It is usual to describe the inner surface of this tubule as smooth, but that character is only present on the septal portion, while anteriorly it is marked by reticulated fibres. The infundibulum is separated from the auricular opening by a thick, tumid lip of muscular tissue with its concavity directed down-

702 NERVOUS SYSTEM. that muscle, while the other passes through the interos- seous space to communicate with the posterior interos- seous from the musculo-spiral. The palmar cutaneous is given off a little above the annular ligament, and, se- parating into two branches, the external winds out- wards to the ball of the thumb, the integument of which it supplies, while the internal passes downwards to the palm of the hand, where it is also distributed to the sldn of this region, sending a twig to the palmaris brevis. Ulnar Nerve.—This is rather smaller than the last described, with the inner head of which it arises in common; it passes obliquely downwards and inwards, at first to the ulnar side of the brachial artery, but gra- dually diverges from it, and ultimately joins the inferior profunda, lying internal to it; both now perforate the internal intermuscular septum, then the sheath of the triceps, passes into the groove between the internal con- dyle and olecranon process, between the two origins oi the flexor carpi ulnaris, arches forwards to the front of the fore-arm, in its upper third lying internal, but at some distance from the ulnar artery; as it, however descends, it gradually approximates this vessel, so that in its inferior third it is in contact with it, but still on a plane internal and slightly posterior to it; crossing now the anterior annular ligament, to which it is bound down by an expansion from the ulnar flexor, it reaches the palm of the hand, where it divides into two branches, -asuperficialanddeep; theformer again subdivides mto two, the internal of which is distributed to the inner aspect of the little finger, while the external, having thrown off- a twig of communication to the median, con- tinues its course to the fourth intercarpal space, where, bifurcating, each is distributed to the opposed surfaces of the fourtH and fifth fingers, their terminal extremities being marked with the same Paccinian corpuscles as are found on the median, dorsal lateral filaments being a so given ofl^ for the supply of the root of the nail. The poste- rior or deep branch sinks between the origins of the ab- ductor and flexor minimi digiti, m compan.y with e deep division of the artery, supplying in co^rs^^^^^^^^ muscles of the little finger; arriving now 1^ th« dons of the deep flexor, it winds outwards, thi owing ott

490 SECTION IV. CAVITY OF THE CHEST. The thorax is situated at the superior part of the trunk, and contains the organs of circulation and respiration, together with the several nerves and vessels appertain- ing to and connected with their functions. The walls of the cavity are yielding, to accommodate the varying increase and diminution of the lungs, but at the same time sufficiently resisting to protect them from the in- fluence of atmospheric pressure during their_ active function in respiration. Let the cavity be laid open by dividing the cartilages of the ribs, and cautiously raising the sternum; immediately posterior to the latter a longitudinal gutter may be observed, wide superiorly and inferiorly, and constricted a little above its centre; this is the anterior mediastinum, receiving that name from its almost median position, being bounded ante- riorly by the posterior surface of the sternum and pos- terior sternal aponeurosis, laterally by the pleur^ passing from the sternum to the anterior and lateral part of the pericardium, and posteriorly by the peri- cardium, where it is deficient of serous covering. The constriction of the centre has given rise to its division into a superior and inferior triangle, whilst from before backwards the figure is also triangular, with the base in front and the apex behind; in the upper part are situated the remains of the thymus gland, origins of the sterno-hyoid and thyroid muscles, with branches oi the omohyoid plexus passing downwards to supply them and the internal mammary artery, which borders its margins; in the lower division are the triangulares sterni muscles, rami abdominales of the internal mammary arteries, and lymphatic glands, through which pass the superficial ab- sorbents from the liver. During life the pleura3 are accu- rately moulded on the contained parts, so that no actual space exists until the sternum is raised.

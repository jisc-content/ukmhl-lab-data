453 MUSCLES OF THE THIGH. the latter a strong process passes downwards over the inner edge of the gastrocnemius, to become continuous with the fascia of the leg; its tendon is separated from the gracilis, above by the internal saphena vein and nerve, and below by a bursa; with the tendons of the gracilis and semitendinosus it forms that peculiar arrangement known as the goose's foot. Three nerves pierce the sar- torius,—the middle and internal cutaneous, and the re- flected cutaneous branch of the internal saphenous, that passes to the skin over the knee-joint; in its entire extent it is enclosed in a separate sheath of the fascia lata, which is remarkable for its prismatic form; and in structure it is peculiar in possessing but a small amount of tendinous tissue, and its fibres run the whole length of the muscle without any interruption. Action—To flex the leg on the thigh, and to cross the limbs; also to flex the thigh on the pelvis, and if the leg is fixed, to rotate the pelvis to the opposite side. Bectus Femoris lies on the anterior and external part of the thigh, extending from the ilium to the pa- tella; it arises by a thick round tendon, which grasps the anterior inferior spine of the ilium, this origin being anterior and internal; the external and posterior, flat, thin, and curved, arises from the upper and outer lip of the acetabulum, which sometimes presents a groove for its reception; it passes downwards, forwards, and in- wards, adhering to the capsular ligament of the hip- joint; the tendons then unite, and form at first a thick, round cord, that then expands, continuing on the upper third of the anterior surface of the muscle, also sendino- a slip downwards through its entire extent, as the cen- tral tendon of origin; the fleshy fibres arising from the posterior surface and sides pass downwards and out- wards, as applied to the mesian line of the muscle; and at the inferior third they become attached to the ante- rior surface of a tendinous expansion that contracts as it descends, and is inserted into the base of the patella, sending fibres on the surface of that bone to become con- tinuous with the ligamentum patellae, through which the muscle is inserted into the tubercle of the tibia. The direction of the entire muscle is downwards and in- wards in the axis of the femur; but the patellar liga-

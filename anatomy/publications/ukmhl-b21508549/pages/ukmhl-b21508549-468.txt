THE MUSCULAR SYSTEM. 458 shape, the base at the femur; it arises by a narrow ten- don from the anterior surface of the symphysis pubis, inferior and internal to the spine, and forms a thick, fleshy belly, increasing in width as it passes downwards, backwards, and outwards; it then ends in a broad ten- don, which sheaths the termination of the fleshy fibres, and is inserted into the middle third of thelinea aspera, between the vastus internus in front, and the adductor magnus behind, with which it is intimately united to constitute the conjoined tendons. ^ Relations.—In the upper three-fourths it is merely subfascial; inferiorly the sartorius crosses it, separated from it by the femoral vein and artery; it lies on the adductor brevis, anterior division of the obturator nerve, and at its insertion on the adductor magnus, the profunda artery and vein intervening. Action To adduct, flex, and rotate the thigh out- '^^^Adductor Brevis.—Lies deeper than the last, and is of a similar figure, but wider and thicker; it arises by a strong round tendon from the symphisis pubis below the adductor longus; becomes fleshy, passes downwards backwards, and outwards, to be inserted by a broad but strong tendon into the upper third of the Imea aspera, above the longus, and below the pectmeus. Relations.-li is covered by the branches of the ob- turator nerve, adductor longus, and pectmeus, a small triangular portion appearing between them, over which lie the femoral and profunda arteries and their corres- ponding veins; the tendon presents three opemngs for ?he perforating arteries of the profunda; ^^^f^nrl adductor magnus and posterior branches of the obtura tor nerve; the superior edge is separated from the ob turator externus by the internal circumflex artery. A Mion Similar to the last. iCcTOR Magnus.-In order to see this muscle com- pletely, it must be dissected from the posterior as weU as the anterior surface; triangular m shape, it a"ses !hort tendinous fasciculi from the lower part of the de- Sing -mns of the pubis, ascending ot t^^^^^^^^^^ and also from the apex of the tuberosity of that bone, the nlcle becomes immediately fleshy and divided in fas-

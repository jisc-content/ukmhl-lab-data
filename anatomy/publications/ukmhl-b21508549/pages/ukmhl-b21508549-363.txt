353 MUSCLES OF THE FORE-ARM. lateral, and interosseous ligaments, and it is covered ex- ternally by the supinator longus, extensor carpi radia- lis longior and brevior, and the posterior interosseous nerve, which pierces its external fibres; it is covered posteriorly by the anconeus, extensor ulnaris, minimi digiti, and communis, also by the posterior interosseus recurrent artery; anteriorly by the inner edge of the supinator longus, radial artery, nerve, and pronator radii teres. The biceps tendon notches the inner edge of the muscle; sometimes the superior portion is altogether tendinous, and the fleshy fibres are only seen on the anterior part. Action.—To extend the fore-arm, to roll the radius outwards, and when it is fleshy above to make tense the coronary ligament of the radius. Extensor Ossis Metacarpi Pollicis Arises from the posterior and inner part of the ulna below the an- coneus, from the posterior surface of the radius below the supinator brevis, and from the interosseus ligament; the tendinous origin ends immediately in a fleshy belly, which is flat on the deep surface; it passes obliquely downwards and outwards, and terminates in a tendon, which runs at first outwards and then vertically on the outer edge of the radius; it then is received into a groove in front of the styloid process, where it is bound down by a strong fibrous sheath, lined by a bursa; pass- ing next over the anterior edge of the external lateral ligament, it divides into two slips, the stronger of which is inserted into the head of the metacarpal bone of the thumb, the narrower into the trapezium bone. Relations.—It is covered by the superficial layer of muscles, but below it lies merely under the fascia. It rests on the ulna, interosseous membrane, radiiis, radial extensors, radial artery, and external lateral ligament of the wrist-joint. Extensor Primi Internodit Pollicis, or, the Exten- sor of the First Joint of the Thumb, lies internal to the last muscle, to which it is intimately connected. It arises tendinous from the ulna, interosseous ligament, and receives a few fibres from the radius below the ex- tensor ossis metacarpi; it then becomes fleshy, and passes obliquely downwards and forwards; ends in a ten-

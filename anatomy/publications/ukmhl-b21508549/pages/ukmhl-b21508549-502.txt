492 CAVITY OF THE CHEST. fibrous tissue. As the membrane differs in its characters, it will be better examined in distinct portions; thus, the costal is strong, but the absolute serous membrane thin and transparent, the strength resulting from the marked density of the fibrous layer, which adheres firmly to the costal periosteum; it is stronger ^nd thicker over the intercostal muscles, to which the ad- hesion is slight; while on the pericardium the serous layer is strong, but the fibrous is lax, and contains adeps in old subjects; it here unites the pleura to the pericardium, and retains the phrenic nerve in its situa- tion. As the pleura forms the walls of the anterior mediastinum, it is lined on its external surface by a fascial layer, differing from the fibrous membrane here- tofore mentioned in being weaker, and the fibrous cha- racter less appreciable; it is also distinctly laminated, and with such facility can it be separated from the serous layer, that it appears to be more connected to the mediastinum and pericardium than to the pleura, and we have distinctly traced its continuity with the fibrous tissue of the cervico-thoracic septum. The diaphragmatic portion is thin, and the fibrous layer is here represented by fine connecting areolar tissue. The cone of the pleura ascends into the neck, bounded above and before by the subclavian artery, anteriorly by the internal mammary, and posteriorly by the superior intercostal, here occupying a recess between the sca- leni muscles; it is surrounded and indented by the inner margin of the first rib, to which it intimately ad- heres, and frequently exhibits in this situation a hori- zontal white line dividing the supra-costal from the intra-thoracic portion; a strong and dense layer of fascia, derived from the prsevertebral aponeurosis, covers and adheres to its surface, protecting the lung from atmos- pheric pressure; this can be raised, layer after layer, by a needle, and its manifest resistance is shown by the difticulty experienced in the attempt to force a blunt instrument through its structure. The existence of this fibrous layer coating the pleura externally ex- plains the fact that abscesses rarely open into the cavity of the chest, although the collection of matter may he in immediate contact with the superficial surface ot the

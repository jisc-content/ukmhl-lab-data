552 CAVITY OF THE ABDOMEN. sarily much increased by the mucous folds or valvula; conniventes, which have been already described as oc- cupying the superior part of the small intestine princi- pally, and we accordingly find that they are more nume- rous where these processes are best developed, as in the lower portion of the duodenum and entire of the jeju- num: but where these begin to diminish mniimber and become less marked, so also do the villi decrease in number, as towards the termination of the ilmm where they are thinly scattered over the surface of the gut. We have already alluded to the manner m which the sihall intestine tapers gradually from the pylorus to within about two inches of its termination, Avhere it again slightly expands till it reaches the cscum uni^ng with this portion of the gut at an acute angle, ihe manner in which this union takes place is peculiar, and can only properly be understood on the dry inflated preparation. On the posterior and internal part of the c^cum, just at its junction with the colon, an elliptical aperture appears, more concave on its inferior than superior border, long from behmd, downwards, and forwards, the two lips which compose it meeting ante- riorly and posteriorly at a very acute angle. Ihe iliuni on reaching this aperture, is united to it by the p rhoneuni, which is tensely reflected from one to the other as well as by its longitudinal muscular fibres, wS a?e arranged in a similar manner, but its circular fibres, basement membrane, and mucous lining, appeal to be thrust into the aperture, to form two remarkabk valves, the ilio-colic and ilio-ca.cal, which J^t pro-^ nently out within the cavity of the c^cum. That this is really the mode of their formation may be proved by the simple experiment of dissecting away the connect- Int redia -tL serous membrane, and longitudina fibres-when, by pulling on the ilium, the valves will become effaced. In their'natural condition these valves are oTa ctcentic shape, being attached bj the. c-^^^^^ borders to the edge of the ^^^^^^P'^f'^^L'^iferpe ' free borders are closely approximated to Â° ^^^^^^ mittinsc however, of easy divarication, so as to allow ot an mitung, iiuwv.v^ , J intestinal contents to

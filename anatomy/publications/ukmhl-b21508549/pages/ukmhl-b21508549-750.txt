NERVOUS SYSTEM. 740 bone in front of tliat opening; becoming wide andflesby, it passes forwards and outwards, and behind the edge of the orbit forms an aponeurotic layer, which, curv- ■ ing downwards, is inserted into the superior margin of the tarsal cartilage, being continued downwards on the posterior surface to its ciliary edge (Sir P. Crampton), and also into the superior palpebral sinus on the deep surface of the palpebral ligament. Relations It is covered by the periosteum, the fourth and frontal nerves, with its supratrochleator branch, also by the upper lid, and it lies on the superior rectus, superior division of the third and ocular fascia. Action.—To elevate the superior eyelid, and by ad- mitting the advance of the globe to depress the lower lid. Sir P. Crampton considered tonic contraction of this muscle to be the usual cauoe of entropium, and on this opinion his peculiar operation for that disease is founded. Now cut the muscle, and reflect its portions forwards and backwards, and examine the— Superior Oblique.—Situated at the internal part of the orbit, being tendinous behind and before, and fleshy in the centre; it arises from the superior and internal part of the optic foramen, and, forming a fusiform fleshy belly, it runs forwards parallel to the os planum of the ethmoid bone, and, having reached the internal canthus, forms a round tendon which plays through a fibro-car- tilaginous, sometimes osseous, pulley, at the inner angle of the frontal bone, from which it is separated by a bursa; then expanding, it turns downwards, backwards, and outwards, between the superior rectus and the globe, and, having pierced the ocular fascia, is inserted by a silvery tendon into the sclerotic coat, between the ex- ternal and superior recti. _ Rdatiom.^lt is covered by the periosteum, lourtli and supratrochleator nerves, with the superior rectus, and it lies on the internal rectus, nasal nerve, ocular fascia, and the sclerotic coat; as the tendon pierces the ocular fascia a process of that membrane is prolonged on it towards the trochlea, whilst a much finer tubule is sent on the ocular part of the tendon. The Recti Muscles are four in number, situated in the long axis of the orbit:—one being above, attollens;

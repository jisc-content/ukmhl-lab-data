554 CAVITY OF THE ABDOMEN. ino- colon, which it joins at an obtuse angle, salient towards the right side, the apex below, but presenting not a pointed, but a rou.nded extremity. It is of varia- ble length, but always limited by an horizontal section carried°horizontally across, immediately above where it is perforated by the termination of the ilium. As it lies in position it occupies the right iliac fossa, resting upon the iliac fascia, and connected to it by a quantity of loose areolar tissue; in front it corresponds to the abdominal w^all, from which it is usually separated by some coils of the small intestines; externally it is in relation with the wall of the iliac fossa, internally with the ilium, and inferiorly Avith the vermiform appendix. Processus Vermiformis.—This is a narrow, worm- like appendage, springing from the posterior and inter- nal part of the csecum. It is of very variable length, ranging from one to six inches, and is equally irregular in its position, being sometimes found m the iliac fossa, sometimes in the pelvic cavity, and sometimes coiled up behind the ceecum itself. In caliber it is about as large as a goose-quill, and at its point of junction with the gut a loose valve is thrown across, but it does not ap- pear to be sufficient to prevent the entrance of f^cal matter, which is often found within it. The perito- neum which is inflected around it, sometimes is ex- tremely long and falciform, conferring on it a degree of mobility which is occasionally very extensive. With respect to its use in the human subject nothmg what- ever is known with regard to it- Ascending CoLoN.-This reaches from the c^cum as far as the inferior surface of the liver and is compara- tively straight. In its course upwards it rests on the quadratus lumborum and right kidney but is separated from them by a quantity of loose areolar tissue; ante- ; oSy and externally it corresponds to the abdominal parleys, from which it is generally separated by a few SsTfthesmallintestine, alsodirectlyinfront butabo^^^^ to the right lobe of the liver, while internal to it is the psoas muscle and vertical portion of the duodenum ^ Transverse Colon extends from the iver, where it passes from the ascending, nearly at a right angle, as lar spleen, there uniting with the descending at an

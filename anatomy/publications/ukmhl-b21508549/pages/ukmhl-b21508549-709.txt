699 BRACHIAL PLEXUS. 2 H 2 Internal Cutaneous.—Smaller than the precedino-; it arises in common with the inner head of the median- descends nearly vertically, and at variable distances be- low the axilla, perforates the fascia, and becomes subcu- taneous ; here it throws off a small twig for the supply of the integuments ofthe inner side of the arm; continuing Its course now downwards, anterior and internal to the basihc vein, about four inches above the internal con- dyle, it divides into an anterior and posterior branch; the former then subdivides into two, both occasionally' and sometnues only one, passing in front of the median basilic vem, the most external crossing to the middle of the fore-arm, the internal on its inner side, both sup- plying the integuments with numerous filaments, and can be traced down as far as the carpus. The poste- rior division descends obliquely downwards and in- wards, and on reaching the dorsal aspect of the fore-arm throws off a recurrent branch to anastomose with the nerve of Wrisberg above the olecranon process; it then proceeds downwards as for as the posterior annular liga- ment, freely supplying in its descent the skin of the back and inner part of the fore-arm. _ Nerve of Wrisberg, or Lesser Cutaneous This IS a very small twig which springs from the plexus ra- ther high up; it passes downwards and outwards, and anastomoses with the intercosto-humeral from the second dorsal, and with it is distributed to the integument of I the posterior and inner part of the arm as far down as •the elbow-jomt. Median NERVE.-This is a very large trunk, arising by two heads, which embrace the axillary artery, the external long, and intimately connected with the exter- nal cutaneous, the internal shorter and thicker, conti- nuous with the internal cutaneous and ulnar; the union ot these two heads takes place in front and a little ex- rternal to the vessel, but as it descends it crosses the lartery generally in front, but sometimes behind, and lies to Its inner side; at the bend of the elbow it is •covered by the semilunar fascia of the biceps, and then disappearing between the two heads of the pronator rraclii teres, its external or coronoid attachment separa- tting It from the ulnar artery, which it crosses, it descends

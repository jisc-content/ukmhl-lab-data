189 TARSAL LIGAMENTS. phoid, the fibres pass directly forwards, but between the other two they pass obliquely forwards and out- wards. Plantar.—These are nearly analogous to the pre- ceding, but are much weaker, with the exception of the internal, which forms a dense fibrous cord blended with the second insertion of the tendon of the tibialis posti- cus. This articulation likewise presents a well-marked internal lateral ligament, stretching between the inner surfaces of the contiguous bones. Interosseous Ligaments are short, strong fibres, some transverse, others decussating,—stretching be- tween the non-articular edges of the adjacent bones. UNION BETWEEN THE CUBOID AND EXTERNAL CUNEIFORM. This is precisely similar to the last, comprehending dorsal, plantar, and interosseous ligaments; they there- fore require no separate description. The synovial membrane is reflected and continuous through all the articulations just described. ARTICULATION OF THE CUNEIFORM BONES WITH EACH OTHER. These bones partly lie in contact with each other, and are in part separated by intervals of unequal lengths. They are connected together by dorsal, plantar, and in- terosseous ligaments. Dorsal—These are broad bands, thin but strong, stretching from bone to bone nearly transversely across their upper surfaces; they are difficult of demonstra- tion, and are covered by the extensor tendons. Plantar.—These are nearly analogous to the last, but situated on the under surface of the foot; they are concealed by the deeper layer of plantar muscles. Interosseous.—These are very dense, consisting both of transverse and decussating fibres; they form the strongest bond of union between those bones. Synovial Membrane.—Tense, and common to them all.

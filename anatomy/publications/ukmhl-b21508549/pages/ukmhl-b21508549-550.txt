CAVITV OF THE ABDOMEN. 540 edge; it is in contact with the greater omentum and the arch of the epiploic arteries; the left extremity is rounded and capacious, forming a large part of the en- tire organ; it corresponds to the spleen, diaphragm, and cartilages of the four or five inferior ribs; the pyloric extremity is small and constricted, and becomes conti- nuous directly with the duodenum, the point where this union takes place being variable, generally occupying a position between the horizontal fissure of the liver and o-all bladder; the line of demarcation between the two being, however, better marked and defined by a dense x'mo; the pylorus, which sinks in and contracts the ori- fice of communication between them. A little to the left side of the pylorus there is a dilatation perceptible on the stomach, particularly on its inferior margin, which has received the name of the antrum. If we now look to the relations of the pylorus, we will find them to be the following:—Anteriorly the abdominal wall, poste- riorly the pancreas; above, the liver; and below, the in-^ flection inwards of the peritoneum to form the sac ot the omentum. The oesophageal orifice of the stomach is situated at the left extremity of the lesser curvature, on a plain superior and posterior to its pyloric ; the left lobe of the liver is in front of it, partially embrac- ing it, while the lobulus Spigelii is thrust in behind it. Exclusive of the pressure of the surrounding parts and its vessels, which in some degree serve as ligaments, the stomach is maintained in position by its direct con- nexion with the oesophagus and duodenum, by the lesser omentum, which binds it to the liver; the splenic, which unites it to the spleen; and the greater omentum, which connects it to the transverse colon; a distinct process ol peritoneum is also reflected on it from the diaphragm around the oesophagus, which serves to attach it directly to this muscle. Structure.—The stomach may be said to have lour coats,—a serous, muscular, fibrous, and mucous. The serous may be considered to be almost perfect; it is derived from the gastro-hepatic omentum, which splits to receive it, and unites again at its inferior border to ihrm the srreat omentum, being closely adherent along its centre'^on both surfaces, but loosely towards its mar-

ARTERIES AND VEINS. 782 posteriorly, bodies of the vertebra and anterior common Lament; on the left side the five or six mfenor run behind the azygos minor, and the two last under the attachments of the crura of the diaphragm. Anteeior Branch, from its direction, must be con- sidered the common trunk; it passes directly outwards on the anterior costo-transverse ligament, then on the external layer of intercostals, and covered by the pleura as far as the angle, where it enters between the two lavers of the intercostal muscles, winds upwards to the inferior margin of the rib above, where it has its corre- sponding vein above it and its nerve below it, and with these relations it proceeds to. the anterior third ot the rib, and, dipping downwards, terminates by anastomos- in<^ with the internal mammary, phrenic, and lumbar; a little beyond the angle it always throws off a small branch, which runs on the upper margin of the nb be- low, and is lost in supplying the intercostal muscles. Posterior Branchâ€”Smaller than the preceding; it passes directly backwards through a quadrilateral space, bounded above and below by the transverse processes, externallv by the anterior costo-transverse ligament, and internally by the bodies of the vertebra. It is dis- tributed to the erectors of the spine and integument, anastomosing with the branches from the opposite ar- terv As it passes through the intertransverse space^ it throws off a small branch, which enters the spinal canal through the intervertebralhole, communicates with Te spinal arteries, while a slender filament runs on he back part of the body of the bone, and, arriving at the venous foramen, which occupies its centre, bfrca es the branch above and below, anastomosing with similar ones from the opposite sides,-thus constituting a circle around it, from which numerous ramusculi enter the cancellous structure of the bone itself. ARTERIES OF THE HEAD AND NECK. The arteries destined for this region consist of the carotfds and subclavians, with their several branche ; hut as those trunks on the right side spring from the arte'a tnoniinata, it will be first necessary to examme this vessel.

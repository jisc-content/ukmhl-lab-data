848 ARTERIES AND VEINS. ing division of the external circumflex of the profunda; while the third, or inferior, descends along the posterior margin of the glutteus minimus, which it afterwards perforates, and, entering the digital fossa, anastomoses with the obturator, sciatic, and internal circumflex of the profunda. Obturator arises from the outer and anterior side of the internal iliac, and, passing downwards, forwards, and outwards, leaves the pelvis through the upper part of the thyroid foramen, and terminates on the inner region of the thigh by dividing into two branches; it also has been divided into two stages,—one within and one without the pelvis. Relations Witliin the pelvis:—Superiorly and ante- riorly, obturator nerve; inferiorly and posteriorly, ob- turator vein; externally, wall of the pelvis and origin . of levator ani; and internally, peritoneum. In this stage it is always invested in loose areolar tissue. On reach- ing the thyroid foramen it detaches a small branch which runs inwards above the neck of the bladder, and behind the symphisis, to anastomose with its fellow of the opposite side; the artery then perforates the vesi- cal fascia, fibres of the levator ani, obturator fascia, ob- turator internus, obturator membrane, and obturator externus; arriving now on the inside of the thigh, or its second stage, it lies in a kind of triangular recess, formed in .front by the pectineals, behind by the quadratus femoris, and upper margin of the adductor magnus; externally by the neck of the bone and capsular liga- ment, psoas and iliac muscles; internally by the adduc- tors brevis and longus; and superiorly by the obturator externus; here it throws off some twigs to the hip- joint, and then divides into two branches,—an internal which passes downwards and inwards along the inside of the obturator muscle, supplying the origins of the adductors, sides of the scrotum, and labia in the female, anastomosing Avith muscular branches of the femoral; and an external, which runs on the outside of the ob- turator muscle, accompanying its tendon to the digital fossa, where it communicates with the sciatic, gluteal, and internal circumflex of the profunda.

HEART. 521 returned by the pulmonary veins into the left auricle of the heart, to which the attention of the student may be now directed. Left Auricle is placed on a plane posterior, in- ferior, and to the leftside of the right; it is some- what of a cuboid figure, corresponding behind to the pulmonary veins; superiorly and posteriorly to the au- ricular appendix; anteriorly and on the right side to the septum and groove for the aorta and pulmonary artery; inferiorly to the auriculo-ventricular opening, with the circular furrow containing the left coronary artery, and the great vein of the same name. It appears smaller than the right, than which its coats are thicker and deeper in colour, being, however, one-fifth less in capa- city. In order to dissect the cavity an incision should be made vertically on the anterior wall, between the appendix (at its root) and the aorta; a second cut, of smaller extent, backwards and towards the left side, will further facilitate the examination of the cavity; on its walls are observed seven openings, namely: four pul- monary veins, orifice of the appendix, oblique aperture at the summit of the fossa ovalis, and lastly, the auri- culo-ventricular opening. Pulmonary Veins.â€”These are four in number, two for the right, and a similar set for the left lung; the former at first consist of three trunks, corresponding to the superior middle and inferior lobes, but the superior and middle unite after a short course, so that at the root of the lung there are only two: those on the left side, consisting only of two branches, pass towards the right, piercing the pericardium, and receiving a cover- ing of serous membrane on the anterior surface from Its lining, then pierce the posterior and left angle of the auricle. Without the pericardium they lie on the left bronchus, and within that bag on the descending aorta. The right pass towards the left side, also pierc- ing the pericardium, and receiving a serous layer on the anterior surface; they then perforate the posterior and right angle of the auricle; and lie on the right pulmonary artery and oesophagus, and behind the de- scending cava, right auricle, and descending aorta. These veins do not possess valves, and at their auricu-

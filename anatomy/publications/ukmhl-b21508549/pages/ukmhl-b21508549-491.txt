MUSCLES OF THE LEG. 481 Action.—It acts on the ankle as an extensor, assist- ing the gastrocnemius. On cutting across the last muscle the deep fascia is seen, attached to the tibia and fibula above, and to the sheaths of those tendons which pass behind the malleoli inferiorly; internally it is firmly connected to the inner edge of the tibia, and externally to the fibula; supe- riorly it is strengthened by the expansion of the semi- membranosus muscle, and the fibres run transversely, becoming much stronger below than above. On re- moving this fascia the deep layer of muscles is exposed; these are four in number,—poplitseus, flexor digito- rum communis, tibialis posticus, and flexor pollicis proprius. PoPLmEus lies external and posterior to the knee- joint, arising by a strong round tendon from a hori- zontal groove on the external condyle of the femur under cover of the external lateral ligament; also from the synovial membrane of the articulation which con- nects it to the external semilunar cartilage. The ten- don now divides into fasciculi, and gives "origin to the flat, fleshy, triangular muscle, the direction being downwards, backwards, and outwards, to reach an oblique Ime on the tibia, into which it is inserted, as well as into the bone above that line and the fascia which covers its surface. Relations—It lies on the external condyle of the fe- mur, external semilunar cartilage, to which it is con- nected by synovial membrane and tendinous fibres ti- bio-fibular articulation, and tibia; and it is covered by the external lateral ligament, tendon of the biceps, and peronajal nerve, external head of gastrocnemius and plantaris, popliteeal nerve, vein, and artery, expansion of the semimembranosus muscle, internal inferior arti- cular artery, and inner head of the gastrocnemius Occasionally the poplitfeal'artery divides on its surface when it will also support the anterior and posterior ti- bial arteries. _ Action.—To flex the knee-joint and rotate the leo- inwards during flexion, but the thigh outwards in the extended state. Flexor Digitorum Communis lies on the posterior

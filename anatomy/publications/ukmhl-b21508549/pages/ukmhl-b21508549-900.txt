At about one inch and three- quarters below Poupart's ligament it receives the pro- tinda vein, which increases it to nearly double its ori- ginal size, and superior to this the internal ^aphena tbe former opening by an oblique oval aperture, whilst that of the lafter is ne'arly circular. Near the pubis the vein can be separated from the artery with great ease, but inferiorly the union of the two is much more intimate, but not lo great as. that of the popliteal vein to its cor- responding vessel.

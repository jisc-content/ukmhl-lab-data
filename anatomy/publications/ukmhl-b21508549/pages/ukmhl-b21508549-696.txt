NERVOUS SYSTEM. 686 beneath the ala of the thyroid cartilage, and turned for- wards between the latter cartilage and the cricoid, sink- ing into the deep surface of the crico-thyroid muscle; but this arrangement is far from being the rule, rather, in fact, constituting the exception. The termination of the superior laryngeal nerve enters the larynx some- times by an aperture in the thyro-hyoid membrane, or again it may run through the thyroid cartilage, and, having passed into the cavity, it divides into ascending filaments, which ramify on the epiglottis and base of the tongue, and descending, some of which terminate in the aryteno-epiglottidean folds of mucous membrane; others enter the proper arytenoid muscles, whilst a third set passes downwards internal to the thyro- and crico- arytenoid muscles, to communicate with the inferior laryngeal behind the crico-thyroid articulation. Cardiac Branches arise from the nerve at the in- ferior third of the neck,—two usually existing on the left side, and one on the right; the former cross the left carotid, communicating with the cardiac branches of the sympathetic, whilst the latter cross the subclavian artery and the arteria innominata, and assist in forming the great cardiac plexus. Eecurrent Laryngeal Nerves.—The right and left arise at different points, the former curving round the right subclavian artery, and the latter round the ductus arteriosus and arch of the aorta. The right usually winds upwards, surrounding about one-third of the subcla- vian artery in its first stage: but should it take its^ origin a little higher, it may inclose three-fourths of that vessel, then passing upwards and inwards, behind the subclavian and carotid arteries, as well as themferior thyroid and lateral lobe of the thyroid body, supported by the longus colli, it ascends in a groove between the trachea and oesophagus, then passing between the m- ferior constrictor and the oesophagus, behind the crico- thyroid articulation, it sends one branch to the posterior crico-arytenoid, two slender filaments to the lateral crico-arytenoid and thyro-arytenoid, and divides into two branches,—one ascending to anastomose with a de- scending twig of the superior laryngeal, whilst the se- cond, running upwards and backwards, tormmates lu

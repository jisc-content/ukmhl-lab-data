573 F(ETAL CIRCULATION, course backwards, and unites witli one of the vense cavse hepaticae, by which its contents is ultimately poured into the ascending cava, and by it is conveyed into the right auricle of the heart. In the description of this organ it has been already explained that an aperture exists at this period in the septum auricularum (fora- men ovale), and that this is provided with a peculiar structure (Eustachian valve) which has a tendency to direct the blood from the cava immediately from the right into the left auricle, from which it passes into the adjacent ventricle, to be propelled from it into the arch of the aorta; by the three great branches which spring from the upper portion of this tube it is next conveyed to the head, neck, and upper extremity, and, having supplied these several parts, the effete blood is carried back by the superior cava to the right auricle, but does not mingle with that of the inferior, but passes directly through the auriculo-ventricular opening into the right ventricle; from this it is propelled into the pulmonary artery, a small portion proceeding by its right and left branches to the lungs, but its greater volume is carried by the ductus arteriosus to the arch of the aorta, which it joins a little below the junction of its transverse with its descending portion, and there, mingling with the re- sidue of the purer stream which was more than suffi- cient for the head and neck, it proceeds downwards through the great arterial trunk to its bifurcation into, the common iliacs; passing through these to their divi- sion into external and internal, a part proceeds through the former for the supply of the lower extremity, while the remainder, the larger portion, is carried by the lat- ter, the hypogastric of this period, along the side of the bladder up to the umbilicus, which it pierces, and then, coiling around the umbilical vein, it reaches the pla- centa, to submit its contents to the vivifying process of that structure. It will be observed from this brief sketch that there is only one organ in the foetus that receives pure blood, and this indeed only partially—the left lobe of the liver^ —that of the right being more or less imbued with that of the porta. It will be borne in mind that at the point where the umbilical vein discharges its contents into

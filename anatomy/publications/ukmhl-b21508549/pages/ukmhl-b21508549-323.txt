MUSCLES OF THE BACK. 313 tubercle of the occipital bone downwards to the base of the coccyx, and a second upwards and forwards to the middle of the crest of the ilium; conclude by cutting downwards and outwards from the occipital bone to the external third of the clavicle; reflect the integument forward, and expose the superficial fascia: this structure is dense above, but lax and loaded with serosity infe- riorly; in it are seen the cutaneous filaments of the cer- vical, dorsal, and lumbar nerves; and when this is re- moved the muscles are brought into view. These con- sist of four layers:—the first being the trapezius and latissimus dor si. Trapezius.—Triangular, base at the spine, apex at the clavicle and scapula; arises by thin aponeurotic fibres from the internal third of the superior curved line on the occipital bone, from the ligamentum nuchse, from the spinous process of the last cervical vertebra, and from similar points of all the dorsal and the su- praspinous ligaments ; the superior fibres pass down- wards, forwards, and outwards; the middle outwards di- rectly; and the inferior upwards, forwards, and out- wards ; the spinal portion ends in a thin tendon, which glides over the commencement of the spine of the sca- pula, from which it is separated by a bursa and a layer of stratiform cartilage; they then are inserted ten- dinous into the spine of the scapula and posterior edge of the acromion; and the occipital portion into the an- terior edge of the external third, sometimes half of the clavicle being united in the latter case to the posterior edge of the sterno-mastoid. The occipital attachment is thin and intimately adherent to the integument; the cer- vical, tendinous, forming the aponeurosis of that region This latter structure is oval, attached in the middle line to the ligamentum nuclree, and to the spinous processes from the fifth cervical to the third dorsal vertebra; the edges are blended with the fleshy fibres of the muscle; the dorsal origin is also tendinous, and is pierced by the small twigs of the intercostal cutaneous arteries and scapular cutaneous, also by cutaneous filaments of the posterior dorsal nerves, but these are at some distance in front of the tendinous origin.

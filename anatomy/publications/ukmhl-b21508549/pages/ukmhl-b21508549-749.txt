739 THE ORBIT. teum, and the following parts are brought into view from without inwards:—Lachrymal gland, nerve, and artery, lying on the upper edge of the external rectus muscle; and internal to this, a latty interval, wider be- fore than behind; still more internally, the frontal nerve and its supratrochleator branch, lying on the levator palpebra?, and on the outer side of the latter a small portion of the superior rectus muscle is seen ; internal to the parts enumerated, a second fatty interval occurs, crossed in front by the supra and infratrochleator nerves; and lastly, at the innermost part of the cavity, the supe- rior oblique muscle, with the fourth nerve lying on its orbital aspect near its back part, is observed. The stu- dent should turn to the description of the cerebral nerves, and may now examine the frontal, lachrymal, and fourth,' and subsequently the muscles as they appear. _ Lachrymal Gland—This conglomerate gland con- sists of two portions, one large, occupyino; a fossa in the external angular process of the frontarbone (orbital portion); the second smaller, which is situated between the conjunctiva and the upper lid (palpebral portion). The orbital portion is transversely oval and extremely variable in size, but usually equalling one-half of a hazel nut, correspoDdiug above to the bone, a layer of perios- teum, and filaments of the lachrymal nerve; inferiorly and internally to the external rectus and the globe of the eye, and anteriorly to the superior palpebral lijrament, so that It projects through the upper eyelid when enlarged, whilst posteriorly it corresponds to the lachrymal vessels and nerve. The palpebral portion is usually caudate and flat, being granular or finely lobulated in its struc- ture, with a dense process of the periosteum investing us surlace and sending processes into its tissue, in fact entirely enclosing it, this prolonged portion of the gland resting on the superior rectus, levator palpebral, and upper eyelid. The ducts of the gland, about from twelve to sixteen in number, open on the superior palpebral sinus, pouring tlieir contents over the free surlace of the globe of the eye (see page 232). Levator PALPEBRyE Superioris Triangular in fi- gure, apex behind, and the base anteriorly; arises from the upper margin of the optic foramen, and the frontal

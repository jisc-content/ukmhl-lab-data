440 THE MUSCULAR SYSTEM. merely exceptional cases. . At the femoral ring there is less resistance than in any other part of the crural arch; the intestine or omentum having passed through the Ting, protrudes the peritoneum as its sac, and also car- ries before it Abernethy's fascia, as the fascia propria of the hernia, then passes downwards in the sheath of the vessels, separated from the vein by the hiternal septum crurale, which prevents injurious pressure on that ves- sel Whilst in this position, the coverings are:â€”1. Inte- gument; 2. Superficial fascia; 3. Cribriform fascia, an- terior layer of the sheath, fascia propria, and the perito- neal sac; but, the pressure still continuing to operate m a direction from above, the intestine descends until it reaches the saphenic opening, beyond which it cannot pass within the sheath, owing to the close adhesion ot that structure to the femoral vessels, and likewise to the entrance of the saphena into the femoral vein; nor can it pass dowAwards beneath the fascia lata m con- sequence of a process which is sent backwards from the margin of the saphenic opening on the femoral sheath; it therefore escapes through that sheath and cribriform fascia, and its further descent m this direc- tion is obviated by the superficial epigastric artery ascending, which curves the hernia upwards over Pou- part's ligament, and it lies here between Scarpa s and the superficial fascia; the covering being from superfi- cial to deep, integuments, superficial fascia, fascia pro- pria, and the peritoneal sac. The intestine may be strangulated by the following points:-by the orifice m the cribriform fascia, by Burns' Hej^s, GimWu s ligaments, contraction of the neck of the sac, or by bri dies of lymph crossing the cavity. In the reduction of a fully formed femoral hernia, it will first be necessary to relL the abdominal walls, also by flexion and inver- sion of the thicrh to relax Poupart's ligament by acting the itc portion of the fascia lata; the tumo-^^^^^^^^ then be drawn downwards, then pressed backwards, fnd finally forced upwards backwards, and outw^^^^^ the direction of the crural canal. In the operation tor SLgulated femoral hernia, after the sac - opened and the finger introduced to the stricture, it sl^ould be di vided upwards and inwards, many authorities conceiv-

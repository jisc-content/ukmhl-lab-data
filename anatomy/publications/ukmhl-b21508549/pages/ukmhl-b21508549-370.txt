360 THE MUSCULAR SYSTEM. Anterior Interossei arise from the metacarpal bones on the same side to which they are attached; form a fleshy mass, with a penniform arrangement of the fibres and terminate in tendons which are inserted, the two outer into the ulnar side of the first phalanx, and the two inner into the radial side of a similar point, and also into the extensor tendons; these he on the dorsal interossei which appear at their margins; per- forating branches of the deep palmar arch pass between them It will now be seen that the posterior interossei are adductors with reference to the mesian line of the hand. DISSECTION OF THE LOWER EXTREMITY. Let the subject, placed on the back, be raised by a block beneath the loins, in order to render the muscles of the anterior abdominal region tense; the latter term is applied to that portion of the trunk extending between the ensiform cartilage and pubis, varying m comparative lenc^th at different periods of life,-in the infant forming oneÂ°third of the entire extent of the subject, but in adult life a comparative diminution occurs, at this period constituting one-fifth, the difference being attributable not to any absolute shortening of the cavity but to thp increase in the extent of the lower extremities and hox^x exce ding that of the abdomen. The anterior abdominar egio? is bounded above by the ensiform cartiSge, cos?o-xiphoid ligament cartilage of the las ^rue and all the false ribs, with the last rib in its entire length; inferiorly by the crest of the ihum, Pou- part's ligament, crest, and symphisis pubis; and poste- riorly by the anterior edge of the latissunus dorsi. If the abdominal wall was carefully dissected from its attach- ment and extended, it would resemble m its outline a It ulL period of Ufe. The relative prominence of the

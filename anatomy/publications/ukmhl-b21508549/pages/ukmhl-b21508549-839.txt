BRANCHES OF RADIAL. 829 Remarhs—The radial nerve is in communication with its artery only in the upper and middle thirds of its vertical stage, in both being external to it, but more remote in the former, but we will see that it again gets into relation w^ith it in its oblique stage on the back of the carpus, where the vessel lies in a perfect triangular space, bounded externally by the extensor ossis meta- carpi and primi internodii; internally by" the extensor secundi internodii pollicis; superiorly by the lower edcre of the posterior annular ligament, while the apex "is formed by the convergence of the several tendons to their insertion into the thimib. Here the vessel is most superficial, being covered only by the integument, fascia, and the filaments of the radial nerve, until it dips be- tween the first and second metacarpal bones, and be- tween the heads of the origin of the abductor indicis, and divides under that muscle, and on the adductor pollicis. Anomalies.—It may arise from the axillary or from the brachial, either higher or lower than its ordinary position. Collateral Branches.—In addition to the several muscular branches in its course down the fore-nrm, it gives off the anterior radial recurrent, superficialis voLt3, anterior and posterior carpal, dorsalis manu, princeps pollicis, radialis indicis, and ramus profunda or communicans. Anterior Radial Recurrent arises from the radial immediately after it comes off from the brachial; it passes at first directly outwards between the supinator l(5ngus and brevis, divides into two branches,~an as- cendmg, which passes upwards to the clei't between the supmator longus and brachialis anticus to anastomose with the musculo-spiral branch of the superior pro- funda, and an inferior, to supply the radial extensors of the fore-arm. Superficialis VoLyK.—Variable in size; arises about an inch above the annular ligament, over which, and through the tendinous origins of the muscles of the thumb. It passes to anastomose with ihe superficial branch of the ulnar, to form the superficial arch of arteries. Anterior CARPAL—Extremely small; it arises oppo-

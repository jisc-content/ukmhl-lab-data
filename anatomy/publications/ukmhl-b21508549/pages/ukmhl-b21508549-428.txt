418 THE MUSCULAR SYSTEM, the ischium, to the falciform process of the great sacro- sciatic ligament, forming the canal for the pudic artery, and at the great sacro-sciatic notch it appears to form a lunated margin ; but such is not really the case, tu- bular prolongations being sent on the parts which escape by that opening. From this point a thin layer is conti- nued inwards, to cover the pyriformis and sacral plexus, behind the internal iliac artery and its branches. As it passes from the origin of the levator ani, a thin pro- cess is prolonged on the perineal surface of that muscle, that becomes continuous with the posterior layer of the base of the triangular ligament. Relations.â€”Externally, bone, obturator internus, in- ternal pudic nerve, artery, and vein: internally, the ischio-rectal fossa and its contents. The Internal or Vesical Layer of the Pelvic Fascia passes inwards and downwards on the pelvic surface of the levator ani, to which it adheres, reaches the side of the inferior fundus of the bladder, and half-an-inch above the vesiculse seminales divides into two portions, a superior and inferior. The superior passes upwards, expanding upon the upper four-fifths of the organ; the inferior, much stronger, divides into a superior and inferior layer, that run above and below the vesiculse seminales, forming a loose cap- sule for these bodies; at the inner edge again uniting, that with its fellow it may constitute the recto-vesical fascia, or Tyrrell's layer, which is exceedingly dense. The anterior edge of these ligaments is united with the anterior true, and the posterior margin incloses the rec- tum in a tubule, completed by the fascia of the opposite side. These ligaments are higher before than behind, being also stronger in the former situation, where they adhere to the prostate, forming the lateral part of its capsule. The anterior true ligaments are strong and dense, and ^re exposed by drawing the bladder back- wards from the pubis; anteriorly they arise froin the symphisis, pass backwards above the prostate, and ex- panding, are inserted into the longitudinal fibres on the anterior surface of the bladder; superiorly they are con- cave and smooth, the dorsal vein of the penis running backwards between them, but merely m a groove,

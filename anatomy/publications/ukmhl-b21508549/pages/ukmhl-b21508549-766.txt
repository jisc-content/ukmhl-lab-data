756 NERVOUS SYSTEM. from a single puncture may be accounted for by the fine homogeneous nature of the investing membrane permitting a slow transudation; anteriorly, and sur- rounding the margin of the lens, the surface is marked by a series of plaiting, the impressions of the ciliary processes, these constituting the zonula ciliaris of Zinn, which is dovetailed or intimately united to the similar circle of the choroid coat. At the margin of the lens the hyaloid membrane appears to split, the anterior layer forming the zonule of Zinn, and the pos- terior attached to the capsule of the lens, producing a canal of a triangular shape, bounded before and behind by the hyaloid membrane; internally by the margin of the lens, which forms its base; and externally by the ciliary processes, where the apex is situated; it is named the canal of Petit from the author who first directed attention to its anatomy, and it appears to al- low the ciliary muscle to advance the lens during visual adaptation. The presence of this canal may be shown by injection, when it exhibits a beaded appearance, owing to the ciliary processes impinging on it. In the centre of the vitreous body a canal exists, very apparent in foetal life (canal of Cloquet), through which a branch, the arteria centralis retinse (artery of Zinn), passes to reach the posterior part of the capsule of the lensâ€” however, it ceases to be evident, in the adult, at least, although always easy of detection in the eye of the horse. COMPOSITION OF THE VITREOUS HUMOUR.

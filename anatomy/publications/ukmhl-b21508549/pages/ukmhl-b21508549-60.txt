50 THE OSSEOUS SYSTEM. ligament; a little above it the capsular, and still higher and anteriorly the outer head of the rectus. As we ad- vance still more superiorly the bone becomes expanded, and from its resemblance to the wing of a bird it has been .termed the ala of the ilium. It is convex ante- riorly, concave posteriorly, and on it may be observed two or three large foramina, through which the nutri- tious branches from the gluteal artery enter the diploe. Three rough elevated lines are also observed on it. ilie first is situated superiorly and posteriorly, commencing at the posterior fifth of the crest, and termmating mid- way between the two posterior spinous processes. It gives attachment to the gluteus maximus The se- cond is more in the centre, beginning a little behmd the anterior superior spinous process, and stretching as far as the upper part of the great sciatic notch, it is curved, the concavity looking downwards and forwards, and gives origin to the glutseus medius. The third is iust above the edge of the acetabulum, commencing at the depression between the two anterior spinous pro- cesses, and terminating at the lower part of the great sciatic notch. It likewise is concave downward, and from it the gluteeus minimus arises. Internally the bone presents a broad triangular concave surface, smooth and p^erforated by one or two holes for t^e nutritious twigs from the ilio-lumbar ^^tery- bounded above by the crest, below by the pectineal line, behind by he auricular facette for the sacrum, ^^<i/^ f two spinous processes, and the interval betw^^^..^^^^^' This is the iliac fossa which gives origm to the iliacus internus muscle. Behind the iliac fossa the character of the bone becomes completely altered Anteriorly it presents an auricular surface, broad above and narrow below, marked by elevations and depressions covered with cartilage fo/ uniting with the sacrum Still m^^^^^ posteriorly the bone is irregular ^-^.'^^^f^^^'^^^^ ng attachment to the strong sacro-i lac lig^'^^^J â€¢ ^ small portion of the ilium is found lymg immediately below the pectineal line.

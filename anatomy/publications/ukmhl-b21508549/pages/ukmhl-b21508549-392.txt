THE MUSCULAR SYSTEM. 382 external direct inguinal hernia of Mr. Guthrie, whilst a similar escape through the internal division produces the ordinary form of direct inguinal hernia and the internal direct of Mr. Guthrie; these differential characters are of but very trivial importance, although it is true that the external direct possesses a cremasteric covering, which is absent in the ordinary form, but still the po- sition of both remains the same in relation to the epi- gastric artery, which seems to us the most useful point in a practical sense, which the student should seek to impress on his mind. We have now noticed somewhat in detail the anatomy of those parts concerned in the production of inguinal hernia; but as there occur two forms of this accident, each with different anatomical relations, we will now proceed with their individual peculiarities. An oblique inguinal hernia, in protruding at the internal ring, car- ries before it a portion of the peritoneum, which lines the abdominal walls; this constitutes the sac; then emerging from the ring, it receives an investment from the internal spoutlike fascia, which is a prolongation from the fascia transversalis, forming the tunica pro- pria of the hernia; it next lies beneath the fleshy mar- o-in of the transversalis, when that muscle arises as far fnwards as the centre of Poupart's ligament, or it sphts it, Avhen that arrangement of the lower fibres exists as described by Mr. Guthrie; it then lies beneath, or un- der cover of the fleshy margin of the internal oblique, and, further pursuing its course towards the external ring, it insinuates itself beneath the cremaster in the male subject; then lies covered only by the tendon of the external oblique, and, escaping through the exter- nal ring, it receives a tubular sheath from the mterco- lumnar bands, or external spoutlike fascia, then Scarpa's layer, superficial fascia, and the integument; thus pur- .viino- its course into the scrotum, with the spermatic cordÂ°behind it, the testicle and tunica vaginalis at its inferior part, the tumour being closely related to the epididymis. It will be observed, that the direction of the hernia is downwards, forwards, and inwards, follow- ing the course of the inguinal canal and spermatic cord; but where the protrusion is large, and has existed for a

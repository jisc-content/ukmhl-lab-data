48^) THE MUSCULAR SYSTEM. If the foot is raised from the ground during extension of the ankle, it represents a lever of the first order, the power being behind, the weight anteriorly, and the lul- crum intermediate; and here it may be mentioned that flexion of the ankle represents the third order of lever, the weight being in front at the toes, the fulcrum pos- teriorly at the joint, and the power intermediate be- tween them. In progression, the second order of lever occurs, because, being the most powerful, it contributes a greater facility to that motion; and sometimes the sudden contraction of the muscular fibres ruptures the tendo Achillis,—an accident most liable to take place '"pL'rr; lies beneath the last, which should be di- vided to expose it. The muscle arises fleshy from the ligament of Winslow, where it joins the capsule of the oin^ and from the termination of the outer hp of the inea Lspera; it forms a fleshy belly, about three inches n lS wlaich terminates in a membranous narrow tendon but yet thelongestin the body; it descends atfirst between the^gastrocnemius and soteus, then runs along ETnner ed-e of the tendo Achillis, and is inserted ntVthTos c'aldsranterior and -ternal to that t^^^^^^^^^ but sometimes it terminates by expanding lu the iascia on the inner side of the common tendon. hea'd:X%xternal, — ^fSS «f !Llr a^rX, also tendinous, from the the internal, shorter ana w , the popliteal line, plantaris, and lies °^ ^^^^J'^P.^^g separating the two connects them.

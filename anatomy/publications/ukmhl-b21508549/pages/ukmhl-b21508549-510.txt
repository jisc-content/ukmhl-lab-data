500 CAVITY OP THE CHEST. the anterior pulmonary plexus. On the posterior sur- face of the root the nerve becomes flattened, lying be- tween the serous membrane and the bronchial tubes, and in this situation a number of branches are detached, more numerous than the anterior, to constitute the pos- terior pulmonary plexus, which also receives filaments from the third, fourth, and fifth thoracic ganglia of the sympathetic; and having communicated with that of the opposite side, its branches enter the substance of the lung, several pursuing the pulmonary vessels, but the principal set of both anterior and posterior divisions follows the successive divisions of the bronchial tubes, communicating frequently through filaments which run between the angles of bifurcation, some disappearing on the muscular layer of the bronchi, whilst the majority can be traced even to the lobular terminations of the tubes. These nerves exercise an important influence over the function of respiration, both in man and the lower animals, and have been frequently made the subject of experimental research. When divided, it appears from the observations of Dr. Eeid that the respirations di- minish in frequency; secondly, that congestion ensues; and thirdly, an effusion of frothy serum takes place into the air-cells, with exudation of blood plasma into the parenchymatous tissue, producing the second stage of pneumonia; and if the animals survive for a period suflaciently long, purulent infiltration supervenes, and even gangrene may result, where a prolonged tolerance of the section exists, as in dogs. Lymphatics.—These are divisible into a superficial and deep set of branches, on the surface forming a re- ticulated network with frequent varicose enlargements; they run towards the bronchial glands at the root of the lung, the deep set being seen in the interlobular areolar tissue, and also reaching the glands at the root, where they communicate with the superficial division; those on the left open into the great thoracic duct, im- mediately before it leaves the chest, whilst those on the right open into the lesser or right thoracic duct. Development—lungs are developed as diverti- cula from the oesophageal membraneabout the sixth week of intra-uterine life, the tubes consisting of right and left. From their surface cajcal wartlike buds are de-

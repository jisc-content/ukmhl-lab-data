SYMPATHETIC NERVES. 729 communicating filaments of tlie right and left cardiac nerves, with twigs from the pneumogastric. It must, however, be confessed that the most careful dissection will sometimes fail in discovering it. Cardiac Plexus Formed in a great measure by the middle and inferior cardiac, but likewise receiving some filaments from the superior, and usually display- ing a ganglionic enlargement at its formation; it rests upon the front of the trachea, immediately behind the transverse portion of the arch of the aorta, and above the right pulmonary artery. The distribution of those nerves to the heart and great vessels may be more clearly understood by divid- ing them into three sets, namely,—an anterior, middle, and posterior. The Anterior Division is very small, although it receives the filaments from the ganglion of Wrisberg, when present; it passes downwards, and to the right side of the arch of the aorta, reaches the right coronary artery, and there forms a plexus, which is situated on the upper part of the right ventricle, the branches of which are distributed to the walls of that cavity. The Middle Division is that portion usually known as the great cardiac plexus of Haller; it is very large, and some of its branches present ganglionic enlarge- ments. Its position has been already alluded to as lying between the transverse portion of the arch of the aorta and trachea, above the right pulmonary artery. It unites with the— Posterior Division, which rests in the bifurca- tion of the trachea, beneath the right pulmonary ar- tery, below which and on the front of the auricles it joins the middle division, throwing off branches to sup- ply the walls of those cavities, whire others, larger in size, course through the auriculo-ventricular grooves, forming the anterior and posterior coronary plexuses, for the supply of the ventricular portions of the heart. Thoracic Ganglia.—The sympathetic in this cavity consists of a long knotted cord at each side of the bo- dies of the vertebras, the ganglions which it presents twelve in number, being nothing more than fusiforni dilatations on it as it descends, being always connected 2 1 3

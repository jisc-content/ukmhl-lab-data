STOMACH. 539 tissue, containing numerotis elastic fibres. Its vascular supply is limited, while its nervous organization has not hitherto been clearly demonstrated, although, when the seat of inflammation, the manifestations of pain are of a most poignant character. Uses.—To connect as well as to facilitate the move- ments of the several viscera contained within the cavity. The cavity of the abdomen contains essentially the or- gans devoted to digestion, secretion, and excretion. In order to simplify them, they may be divided into the hollow or membranous, and the solid or glandular. The first consists of the stomach, duodenum, jejunum, caecum, ascending, transverse, and descending colons, sigmoid flexure and rectum; and the second comprises the liver, spleen, pancreas, and kidney. We will commence our description with the— Stomach.—This hollow viscus, truly a dilatation of the CBSophagus, is in the human subject a flattened cone, with the larger extremity directed towards the left side, the smaller towards the right, where it becomes continiious with the duodenum at the pylorus. It occupies nearly the entire of the epigastric and left hypochondriac regions, and presents, for the purposes of description, an anterior and posterior surface, a superior and inferior margin, a right and left extremity, and a cardiac and pyloric ori- fice. The anterior surface looks forwards and upwards, and is in relation with the diaphragm, abdominal walls, and left lobe of the liver, which overlaps it to a very variable extent; the posterior, directed downwards and backwards, corresponds to the sac of the omentum and ascending layer of the transverse mesocolon, which sepa- rates it from the inferior transverse portion of the duo- denum, pancreas, crura of the diaphragm, psose muscles, aorta, and several of its branches; the superior edrre, turned upwards and backwards, is short and concave,' except towards its pyloric extremity, where it is slightly convex; it corresponds to the lesser omentum, and the co- ronary and pyloric arteries, which are contained within its folds; the inferior margin, directed downwards and forwards, is much longer than the preceding, convex except at its smaller extremity, where a slight conca- vity exists, corresponding to the convexity on its upper

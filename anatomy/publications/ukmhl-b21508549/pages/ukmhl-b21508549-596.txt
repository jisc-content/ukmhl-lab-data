586 CAVITY OF THE ABDOMEN. a middle or fibrous, and an internal or mucous. The first of these, or the serous, is very imperfect, covering it only anteriorly, but still adhering to it with some degree of tenacity; the second, or fibrous, is derived from the proper capsule of the kidney, it invests it completely, is extremely dense, and also possesses much strength; it does not terminate abruptly at the hylus, but is prolonged into the substance of the kidney, forming the external envelopes of the infundibula, ca- lyces, &c. The third, or mucous layer, is remarkable for its pale character and peculiar tenuity; it is merely a prolongation upwards of the internal coat of the blad- der, which, after lining the ureters, is inflected in suc- cession into the infundibula, calyces, uriniferous ducts, and ultimately into the convoluted tubes of Ferrein, where it terminates in those pouch-like csecal processes already alluded to. In this latter situation they are lined by small epithelial cells with oval nuclei, but at the patulous extremity of the flask-like dilatation these o-ive place to the ciliated variety, which is again suc- ceeded in those of the cortical structure by the pave- ment form, angular and coarsely granular; in the tubes of the medullary structure they diminish in size, and display evident nuclei, surrounded by a very narrow The Kidneys, exactly as in the lower classes of animals, are developed from peculiar embryonic structures, termed the Wolflaan bodies after the name of their discoverer. These make their appearance towards the end of the first month, but it is near the end of the second before the rudiment of the kidney is visible, and during the third, the latter organ continues to increase rapidly in size while the former diminishes in a similar ratio, so that at birth scarcely a vestige of them remains. At the twelfth week the kidney consists of from eight to twelve lobules, which are destined to form the future pyramids, and these are loosely connected together by lax areolar tissue, but which afterwards become more firmly united by a condensation of this substance, so that at length the lobulated appearance is completely obli- terated. The Wolffian bodies are highly vascular-, they receive four or five large branches from the abdominal

471 MUSCLES OF THE ABDOMEN. by the pressure of the matter, or from inutility of the muscle, or both in combination. Action.—To draw forwards and flex the thigh, also to rotate it outwards; to keep the spine erect, and bend it to one side. QuADRATUS LuMBORUM lies external and posterior to the last, oblong in shape, and stretched between the last rib and the crest of the ilium; it arises by short tendinous fibres from the posterior fourth of the crest of the ilium, and from the ilio-k;mbar ligament; the fibres pass upwards and inwards, the external being in- serted into the lower edge of the last rib for about two inches and a half, the internal passing upwards and in- wards, and are inserted by four tendinous and fleshy slips into the summit of the transverse processes of the four first lumbar vertebrae. Where these terminate three fleshy slips frequently pass upwards and out- wards, superficial to the remainder of the miascle, cross- ing its fibres at acute angles, and are inserted into the last rib. Relations—It is between the anterior and middle layers of the transversalis abdominis tendon, the last dorsal nerve, lumbar arteries, psoas, kidney, crus of the diaphragm, being also anterior to it. The resemblance to the rectus abdominis, in being inclosed in a fibrous sheath, is sometimes still further increased by the pre- sence of a transverse tendinous intersection in its struc- ture. Action—To depress the last rib, also to bend the spine to its own side, and if the spine be fixed, to ele- vate the pelvis. Iltacus Internus is seen by removing the iliac fascia; it is broad and triangular above, narrow inleri- orly, arising from all the iliac fossa, from the three an- terior fourths of the crest of the ilium, from the ante- rior superior and inferior spines, and the notch between them, from the iliac fascia and brim of the acetabulum, and from the last lumbar transverse process; the fibres converge, passing over the iliac sulcus on the brim of the acetabulum, and are inserted into the outer side of the tendon of the psoas, and then continued down to the lesser trochanter, which is embraced by its anterior

With the general venous system it forms endless communications, and it is not astonishing that, in occlusion of the superior or inferior cavae, it should undergo a remarkable dilatation. The representatives of this system in the skull are, the si- nuses, the superior and inferior longitudinal, straight, and occipital, corresponding to the posterior intraspinal veins, the cavernous, petrosal, and lateral to the ante- rior, whilst the circular, transverse sphenoidal, and ba- silar, correspond to the communicating branches. ABSORBENT VESSELS. Absorption is that function by which structural changes are accomplished of parts of the body itself ; the product being carried into the venous system; likewise, by which matters placed in contact either with natural or artificial surfaces are introduced into the system, and also by Avhich certain parts of organs or structures are removed, modelling the body into symmetry. Absorp- tion is a very general function in all classes of animals; and though Hunter and Monro maintamed the opinion that the lymphatics constituted the only absorbing channels, still it is now generally admitted that tlie veins participate in the action to no small degree, as Maeendie and Segalas satisfactorily proved by a series of well-contrived experiments. It will be sufficient here to state, that the absorbents have been divided into alands, lymphatic vessels, and lacteals. The glands are conglobate, oval in shape, of a yellowish-grey colour indefinite in number, size, and situation, depending tor their capsule on the condensation of the areolar tissue in the Vicinity, and they do not possess any proper ducts.

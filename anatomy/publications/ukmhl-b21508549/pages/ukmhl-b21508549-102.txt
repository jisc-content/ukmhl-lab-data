THE OSSEOUS SYSTEM. 92 always present, into which the dura mater insinuates Itself. The inferior internal margin is very irregular. Commencing posteriorly we observe a slight depression corresponding to the inner wall of the jugular fossa; then a small elevation, separating it from a slight notch, the internal boundary of the aqueduct of the cochlea; in the remainder of its course it is convex and rough, and articulates with the basilar process of the occipital bone. The inferior surface forms part of the base of the cranium, and is the most irregular of the three. Anteriorly it is exceedingly rough, and gives attach- ment to the petro-pharyngeal aponeurosis and levator palati; more posteriorly, but externally, is a large for- amen,—the carotid, into which enters that artery, and branches of the superior cervical ganglion of the sym- pathetic, the nervi molles; a thin crest separates this foramen from a depression of variable depth posteriorly, —the jugular fossa formed by the regurgitation of the blood in this vein; in this crest is a minute foramen for the tympanic branch of Jacobson in its course to the tympanum; and in the outer wall of the same fossa, another for the passage of Arnold's auricular twig, to reach the stylo mastoid-hole. Behind, the jugular fossa and internal to the carotid hole, is a small cleft of a tri- angular shape,—the aqueduct of the cochlea, for the transmission of a small vein to the inferior petrosal sinus. At the back part of the inferior surface, just as the digastric groove commences, and between the sty- loid and mastoid processes, but internal to both, is another hole, the stylo-mastoid, through which emerges the portio dura nerve, and into which enters a small branch of an artery from the posterior auris to anasto- mose, in the aqueduct of Fallopius, with the Vidian bo-anch of the middle meningeal. The external supe- rior is the shortest of the three margins; it forms an acute angle with the squamous portion, and at the point of junction we observe a canal leading back^vards, and divided into two by a thin plate of bone,—the pro- cessus cochleariformis; the superior, the smaller, giving origin to the tensor tympani, the inferior larger, con- stituting the bony portion of the Eustachian tube. An- terior to this the margin is rough and rather broad for

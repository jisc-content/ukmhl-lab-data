THYROID GLAND. 271 Relations.—Externally it corresponds to the parotid, from wbicli it is separated by fascia, to the stylo-maxil- lary ligament, internal pterygoid, the tonsillitic artery intervening, external carotid, mylo-hyoid muscle, and submaxillary gland; internally to the internal carotid, jugular vein, superior constrictor, ascending pharyngeal artery and hyo-glossus; separating its lower edge from the stylo-pharyngeus are seen the styloid process, the stylo-hyoid ligament, glosso-pharyngeal nerve, and as- cending palatine artery. Action.—To retract the tongue, also to draw it to one side; when both these muscles act, the tongue is rapidly retracted into the mouth, if it has been pro- truded, for the performance of which function they are admirably adapted. Stylo-pharyngeus.—Longer than the la,st; arises from the back part of the root of the styloid process; passes downwards, forwards, and inwards, insinuates itself between the superior and middle constrictors, and is inserted into the posterior part of the thyroid cartilage, from the superior to the inferior cornu. Relations.—It is covered by the external carotid, facial artery, the glosso-pharyngeal nerve winding round it to reach its forepart, superior laryngeal nerve, mid- dle and inferior constrictors; it lies on the internal carotid artery, jugular vein, pneumogastric, glosso- pharyngeal, lingual, superior laryngeal, and sympathe- tic nerves, ascending pharyngeal artery, mucous mem- brane, and superior constrictor. We have seen this muscle frequently split by the glosso-pharyngeal nerve. Action.—To raise and dilate the bag of the pharynx. The Thyroid Gland should now be examined. This glanduliform mass may be seen to occupy the front of the trachea, the sides of that tube, and the larynx, to a greater or lesser extent in diflferent cases. It consists of two lateral lobes, with a central or connecting slip; each lobe is convex on its external surface, narrow and pointed above, large and wide inferiorly, somewhat con- cave on its tracheal aspect; the middle lobe is usually situated at the inferior part, but always nearer to the lower than the upper of the lateral, which it unites, but this is subject to variety in position, as well as in

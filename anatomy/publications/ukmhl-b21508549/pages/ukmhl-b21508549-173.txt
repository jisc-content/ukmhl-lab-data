PELVIC LIGAMENTS. 163 The FiBRO-CARTiLAGiNOUS Disc is thin -when con- 1 trasted with those between the bodies of the vertebrae. 1 It is always, however, denser in the female than in the } male. The strength of this articulation is greatly increased I by the origin of the sciatic ligaments, which, stretching I along their sides, form a strong bond of union between the adjacent bones. ILIO-LUMBAR ARTICULATION. There is no direct union between the last lumbar vertebra and the ilium, but they are connected together by a powerful ligament,—the ilio-lumbar. This arises narrow from the under part of the transverse process of the fifth lumbar vertebra, and, becoming broad and expanded, is inserted into the posterior superior spi- nous process and a part of the adjacent crest. The strength of this ligament is much increased by the muscles that are attached to it,—the gluteus maximus and iliacus internus springing from it below, and the latissimus dorsi, erectores of the spine, and quadratus lumborum, superiorly. It is a syndesmoid articulation, nearly the strongest of that class in the whole body, and is exposed by removing the muscles that have been enumerated. SACRO-ILIAC ARTICULATION. This belongs to the class amphiarthrosis, and is formed by the apposition of the sacrum and os innomi- natum. To examine this joint, as well as the ligaments of the other articulations, it will be necessary to divide the horizontal ramus of the pubis immediately exter- nal to its spine directly downwards into the thyroid hole, carrying the saw afterwards through the junction of the descending ramus of the same bone where it joins the ascending of the ischium; by now forcibly tearing asunder the sacro-iliac symphysis of the corre- sponding side, we will be enabled to examine the joint under consideration,—the symphysis pubis, and both sacro-ischiatic ligaments on the larger portion.

484 THE MUSCULAR SYSTEM. is retained by a process from the posterior di-f ision of the external lateral ligament; and" lastly, it grooves the inferior surface of the internal process of the os calcis (sustentaculum tali); then runs forwards and inwards above the flexor communis, to which it is united by a slip, passes between the heads of the short flexor of the "•reat toe and the two sesamoid bones, and is ultimately fiiserted into the posterior edge of the ungual phalanx of the great toe. Relations.—li corresponds mternally to the tibialis posticus and peroneal vessels, externally to the peronsei; behind to the solseus, tendo Achillis, and fascia; and it lies on the fibula, tibia, and interosseous ligament; also on the peroneal vessels. Action. To flex the phalanges of the toe, to extend the aukle-joint, and turn the foot outwards. These three tendons pass beneath a fibrous or fascial band (internal annular ligament), stretched between the internal mal- leolus and the os calcis ; this has been fully described with the ligaments of the ankle-joint. ANATOMY OF THE FOOT. The fascia on the dorsum of the foot is thin, and in- closes the superficial veins and nerves in thin sheaths, while similar funnel-shaped tubules surround the ten- dons to which the fascial investment is connected by re- ticul'ar areolar tissue. The superficial veins consist ot a tarsal arch and the origins of the external and internal saphena from either of its angles; the superficial nerves are the internal and external tarsal branches of the musculo-cutaneous for the supply of the dorsal aspect ot the toes; and on removing these superficial parts a sin- gle muscle is exposed,—the extensor digitorum brevis. Extensor Digitorum Brevis.—Somewhat square; lies on the dorsum of the foot, arising from the trian- gular fossa formed by the neck of the astragalus and upper surface of the os calcis, also from the os calcis at the^outer and anterior part of its neck, and from the dorsal aspect of the cuboid bone; it passes forwards and inwards, dividing into four fleshy bellies, to each of which a narrow tendon is attached; these pass forwards

NERVOUS SYSTEM. 684 internal carotid and jugular vein, lying behind and be- tween them, and having descended in the sheath, as far f as the root of the neck, it enters the thorax, crossing b the right subclavian artery in front, and lying behind the right vena innominata, at a right angle to the for- mer; but on the left side it passes parallel, but anterior and internal to the corresponding subclavian, and behind the left vena innominata. The right nerve then runs backwards and inwards, lying in a space bounded exter- nally by the right vena innominata, internally by the arteria innominata, and above by the subclavian artery, then passing on the posterior and right side of the de- scending cava, it reaches the root of the lung, whilst the left nerve crosses the junction of the transverse and de- scending portions of the arch of the aorta, lying poste- rior and external to the corresponding phrenic, which crosses it, and, having attained the root of the left lung, it passes to its posterior surface between the ductus arteriosus and left pulmonary artery; both trunks now enter the posterior mediastinum, the left lying on the anterior and left side of the oesophagus, whilst the right is situated on the posterior and right side of that tube, and, following its course, they pass through the (Eso- phageal orifice in the diaphragm, and terminate on the stomach. From the foregoing account it will be seen that these nerves may be divided into four stages,—firstly, cranial, which, with the branches arising in this stage, have been described in detail; secondly, cervical; thirdly, thoracic; and fourthly, abdominal. The student may now examine the branches arising in the three latter stages according to the following order: — Cervical branches:—Communicating, pharyngeal, superior la- ryngeal, cardiac, right inferior laryngeaL Thoracic:— Left inferior laryngeal, pulmonary, oesophageal. Abdo- minal:—Gastric,—terminal branches to stomach, &c. Immediately below the base of the cranium the vagus presents a fusiform swelling, of a grey colour, and about one inch and a quarter iu length,—here communicating with the glosso-pharyngeal, ninth or lingual, superior cervical ganglion of the sympathetic, nervous loop of the atlas, and receiving the branch of bifurcation from the spinal accessory.

LIVER. 563 upper and convex surface of the liver; the base is free, looks downwards and backwards, and contains the um- bilical vein, while its apex, pointing upwards and back- wards, bifurcates into two processes, in figure similar to the flukes of an anchor, attached above to the diaphragm and below to the liver,â€”this is the coronary ligament, which can be traced out on either side to become conti- nuous with the lateral, which are situated at the extre- mities and posterior edge of the liver, the left lying im- mediately in front of the oesophagus, pneumogastric nerves, and superior coronary artery, while the right occvipies a position external to the groove for the vena cava. The vessels and duct, with the pressure of the adjacent viscera, assist materially in keeping the oro-an in situ. It is to be presumed that the student has already examined the arteries, great veins, and duct, in this re- gion, and having done so, he may now proceed to re- move the liver by dividing its connexions to the Avails of the abdomen, as well as the vessels in relation with it, taking care, however, to leave a sufficient length of the latter to enable him to observe their ultimate course and destination. He may now clean away the loose areolar tissue and peritoneum from the fissures, and more accurately examine the peculiarities of the organ. We have already stated that the liver on its upper surface is convex, and marked by a slight antero-pos- terior groove, corresponding to the falciform process, which divides it into its two lobes, the right being atleast three or four times larger than the left. Its inferior is much more irregular, presenting a deep antero-pos- terior sulcus, which, as has been previously stated, is sometimes converted into a complete canal by a process of the liver which is thrown across it; this contains anteriorly the obliterated umbilical vein and posteriorly the ductus venosus. Passing off at a right angle from this, and extending for about an inch and a half on the right lobe, is another fissure, broad and deep, limited externally by the sulcus for the gall bladder, and situ- ated a little behind the centre; this is the transverse, which must be regarded as of great importance, as through it the vessels, duct, and nerves enter and

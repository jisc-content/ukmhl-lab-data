BRANCHES OF EXTERNAL CAROTID. 787 mose with a similar one from the opposite side; this also sometimes gives off a small laryngeal branch. Collateral Branches—Hyoid, muscular, and la- ryngeal. Hyoid Branch.—This is always very small, spring- ing from the artery immediately after its origin; it passes forwards and inwards between the thyroid muscle and ligament, below the cornu of the os hyoides, anas- tomosing in the middle line with that from the opposite side,.and with a similar branch from the lingual. Muscular Branch.—Small and slender, arises close to the last; it passes downwards and outwards over the sheath of the great vessels, and beneath the sterno-mas- toid, to which, and the adjoining glands, it is distributed. Laryngeal Branch—Usually large, arises from the thyroid at the angle of flexion, between its first and second stages, passes inwards, at first between the middle and inferior constrictors, with the superior laryn- geal nerve, then between the thyro-hyoid muscle and membrane, perforates the latter, or sometimes the thy- roid cartilage, and beneath the mucous membrane di- vides into two branches,—an ascending, to supply the epiglottis and aryteno-epiglottidean folds; and a de- scending, which runs downwards to be distributed to the lining membrane of the larynx and trachea. Remarks.—The size of the superior thyroid is very •variable, and seems to depend, in a great measure, on the capacity of the inferior thyroid, it being generally ' observed, that where the one is extremely large, the other is relatively small, a fact which would appear to argue strongly against the use of the ligature in aflfec- itions of the thyroid gland. Anomalies—Thh vessel, as the rule, may be said to ; arise immediately below the cornu of the os hyoides, but - exceptions will occur, when it may come off either some distance above or below that point, in the latter in- ?stance its origin being usually from the common ca- irotid. It may also arise by a single trunk, in common iwith the lingual, or its laryngeal branch may proceed -•separately from the external carotid. Lingual Artery arises from the external carotid, a llittle above the superior thyroid, the cornu of the'os

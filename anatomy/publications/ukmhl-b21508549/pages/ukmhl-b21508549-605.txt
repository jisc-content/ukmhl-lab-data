595 FEiMALE ORGANS OF GENERATION. exhibits a superficial stratum of longitudinal and a deeper set of circular fibres, both being continued from the uterus. The mucous lining, pale and fine, presents numerous longitudinal rugse, the epithelium being cili- ated to the point where it becomes continuous with the peritoneum at the fimbriated extremity of the tube. _ Ovaries—These are two small oval bodies or glands, situated in the lateral broad ligament of the uterus, behind and below the Fallopian tubes, their long measurement, which is placed transversely, being in the virgin about one inch and a half, in breadth three- quarters, and in thickness half-an-inch; but in advanced life, and even at the age of forty, if the female has borne many children, the difference in size and weight is very remarkable: in the virgin being from ninety to one hundred grains, and in the multiparient from forty to fatty. These glands are convex behind and before, also : above, and covered by serous membrane, but otherwise unattached; the inferior edge is notched for the en- 1 trance and exit of vessels, externally receiving the at- itachment of the Fallopian fimbriae, and internally fixed I by the ligament of the ovary, this latter appearing as i a strong round cord, attached externally to the ovary •where it becomes expanded and mixed with the fibrous jstroma of the gland, and internally inserted into the 1 lateral and superior angle of the uterus. In the fcEtus tthey occupied the lumbar region, and after birth as- <sumed their future position in the true pelvis; durin? Fpregnancy they follow the uterus into the abdominal ccavity, and after parturition remain for some time in tthe ihac fossffi; occasionally they become displaced into > the recto-uterine cw/ de sac, where their existence can :be detected by the introduction of the finger through "the rectum. ° ° Structure.-The first,or indusium,is derived from the pperitoneum; the second, or tunica albuginea, is merely condensed stroma, and is deficient at the hylus, where tthe nerves and vessels enter the organ; the parenchv- imatous tissue consisting of a fibrous stroma, which se- poarates and connects the ovisacs, and permeated in all -lirections by a vascular network. Each ovary con

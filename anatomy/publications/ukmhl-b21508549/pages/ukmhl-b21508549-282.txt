THE MUSCULAR SYSTEM. 272 ! shape; it may lie in front of the second, third, and fourth rings of the trachea, or it may pass behind that tube or the cesophagus;. as to shape it may be a mere transverse band, or thick and convex, projecting ante- riorly like a tubercle; or lastly, it may be wholly absent, the two lateral lobes being fused into a single mass in the middle line. The lateral lobe is covered by the sterno-hyoid and thyroid muscles, the latter corresponding in width with the development of the gland; by its deep surface it rests against the oesopha- gus, laryngeal recurrent, inferior thyroid artery, infe- rior constrictor, trachea, cricoid cartilage, and inferior third of the thyroid; the outer lip overlaps the sheath containing the carotid, jugular vein, and pneumo- gastric nerve, the amount depending on the size of the gland; the upper edge is concave, embracing the lower edge of the cricoid cartilage, and corresponds to the ramus thyroideus of the superior thyroid artery; from its centre, sometimes from the right or left margin, a thin band may be observed to ascend, either in the middle line or on one side, reaching the thyroid car- tilage, or, more rarely, mounting on the thyro-hyoid membrane to reach the os hyoides; this structure has been by some considered as a muscle,—" levator thy- roidei," a view principally derived from the circum- stance, that in some cases it is distinctly fibrous, but this certainly constitutes the exception, for in many cases where a favourable opportunity occurred, we have examined this structure in a recent subject, and have found it always presenting an appearance similar to the body of the gland, with but slight modification; in one instance the band became swollen in the notch of the thyroid cartilage, resembling in its external characters a small lymphatic, but a section revealed the same tissue that constitutes the peculiar characteristic of the gland itself. Again, we have seen it with an inter- rupted structure, partly fibrous, the remainder glan- dular, presenting the appearance of a string of berries; this is plainly the remains of the laryngeal portion of the gland, its diminution occurring spontaneously with the development of the larynx.

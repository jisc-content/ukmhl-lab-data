Prior to the descent of the testicle, the internal ring is not formed, but is produced by the continued pressure of the testicle on the posterior aspect of the fascia transversalis, which ultimately car- ries a pl-olongation of that structure on its surface; thus the tunica vaginalis consists of two layers, tunica vaginalis scroti lining that bag, and tunica vaginalis testis covering the gland, a cavity intervening, smooth, polished, and glistening. The external layer adheres but slightly to the scrotum, and should now be laid open, and when slit anteriorly and reflected, the testicle, epididymis, and vas deferens are seen. The tunica va- ginalis adheres to the surface of the testicle most inti- mately, is thence reflected on the sides as far back as the epididymis; it then covers the outer side of the globus major and minor, sinking in between the body and the gland, forming a pouch in this situation in which the extremity of the handle of a scalpel can be buried. From the inside of the testicle it is reflected on the vas deferens, which here intervenes between it and the epididymis, the former being very loosely attached to the tube; tracing it upwards, it passes as'a distinct membrane about half-an-inch on the cord, somewhat higher internally than externally. This tunic is trans- parent, through its structure the subjacent tunica albu- gmea, with the vessels of the gland, are always visible; It is stronger on the epididymis in consequence of the deficiency of the tunicaal buginea, but even on this part we have always been able to detect a well-marked fibrous layer, that not only surrounds it, but also sends processes to invest the convolutions of which the epi- didymis IS composed; this is very remarkable on the globus major and body, and we have been accustomed to describe it as the " fibrous capsule of the epididymis " This capsule is rendered more distinct in the enlarge- ment of the epididymis remaining after specific testitis- also in cases of scrofulous disease, where it forms a cap- sule for tubercular deposits. The object of the serous tunic appears to be to facilitate the gliding motion of the testicle, assisting it to elude concussions. The Tunica Vaginalis is the seat of congenital her-

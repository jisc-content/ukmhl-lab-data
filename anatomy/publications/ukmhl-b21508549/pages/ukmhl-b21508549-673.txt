CEREBRAL NERVES. 663 face is concave, rough, and plexiform, and intimately united to the dura mater, which covers it, looking up- wards, forwards, and outwards. The recess in which the ganglion is situated represents a conoid triangle, the base anteriorly and externally, the apex posteriorly and internally, and is separated from the cavernous sinus by a layer from the convex edge of the tentorium and the internal carotid artery, whilst externally it is bounded by the spinous process of the sphenoid bone and middle meningeal artery; anteriorly or at the base, it exhibits three funnel-shaped apertures, the highest and smallest for the ophthalmic; the middle both in size and position for the superior maxillary; and the most inferior, the largest, for the inferior maxillary, which last is sometimes divided by a narrow septum; the smaller opening containing the hard root of the fifth,' while from the margins of these apertures processes are sent on each nerve as it escapes. _ Ophthalmic Nerve arises from the superior ante- rior angle of the ganglion, and, passing upwards and forwards, enters the outer wall of the cavernous sinus, being here somewhat flattened, with the superior mar- gm internal, and the inferior external; corresponding superiorly to the fourth, with which it is closely united, but near the sphenoidal fissure, losing that nerve, it becomes related to the third, the sixth lying below'it; but m the two posterior thirds being separated from It by the sinus and one layer of dura mater; anteriorly, however, it lies immediately below it, in consequence of crossmg from within outwards, and immediately be- hind the sphenoidal fissure it divides in three branches —lachrymal, frontal, and nasal. ' Lachrymal NERVE—Extremely small, and surround- ed by a tubule ol dura mater, enters the orbit through the apex of the sphenoidal fissure, lying above the nasal and below the superior division of the third; passing forwards and outwards, along the upper edge of the ex- ternal rectus muscle, accompanied by the lachrymal artery, it divides into three sets of filaments, namely, glandular, palpebral, and communicating: the first be- ing very numerous and flat, entering the osteal surface ot the gland, in which they terminate; the second con- sisting usually of two filaments, which pass either

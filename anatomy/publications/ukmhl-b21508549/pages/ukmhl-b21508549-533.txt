523 HEART. larger, attached to the anterior half segment of the auricular zone, separating the aortic from the aurictilo- ventricular opening, about two lines intervening be- tween them; the posterior, smaller and more fixed, connected above to the posterior half segment of the auricular zone; the inferior margins of both right and left receiving the attachment of numerous chordse ten- dinea?. These valves, particularly the anterior, are much stronger than the tricuspid, and are also more calcu- lated accurately to close the mitral opening, and thus prevent regurgitation. The aorta arises from the su- perior, anterior, and left side of the base of the left ven- tricle, which appears to be divided into two portions by the anterior mitral valve, an anterior or arterial, and a posterior or auricular portion, as it receives the blood from that cavity. The arterial division is bounded anteriorly and to the right side by the septum, which m this situation presents a smooth surface; posteriorly and to the left side by the anterior mitral valve; and superiorly by the aortic tendinous annulus. This ring receives externally and inferiorly the ventricular mus"^ cular fibres; and superiorly it presents three concavities, with intervening triangular elevations; the former, the convex roots of the aorta, are connected to the latter, occupying the spaces between them. This opening, like that of the pulmonary artery, presents three semi- lunar valves, for the purpose of obviating regurgitation, but these will be fully described with the arch of the aorta (see Arterial System). The Muscular Tissue of the Heart appertains to the involuntary system, and although wholly removed from the control of volition, it still presents, however some peculiarities which seem to ally its structure to the voluntary system; thus, it is thick, firm, and re- sisting, of a deep red colour, the fibres presenting a feeble striation, and attached to tendinous tissue. These peculiarities, though they cannot influence the volitional effect, may provide in a great measure for that ener- getic action which the heart exhibits in a much greater degree than any other muscle of the involuntary class. These muscular fibres may be divided into an-auricular and ventricular system, and in order to examine them

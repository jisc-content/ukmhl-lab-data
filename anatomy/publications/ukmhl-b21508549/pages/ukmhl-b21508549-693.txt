CEREBRAL NERVES. 683 jugular vein, and communicating with branches of the superior cervical ganglion of the sympathetic. Branches to the Tonsil—These pierce the superior constrictor, forming a plexus in the gland with filaments from the gustatory and palatine nerves. Branches to the Pharynx—These consist of three or four flat filaments, passing in front of the internal carotid artery, and, curving a little upwards and for- wards, join the superior angle of the pharyngeal plexus. Terminal Branches to the Tongue The trunk of the nerve, having passed beneath the hy o-glossus, appears much diminished in size, and dividing into a number of slender branches, which, ramifying in the submucous tissue at the base of the tongue, terminate by sup- plying the mucous membrane at the base and margins of that organ. According to the experiments of Dr. Reid, the function of this nerve is purely afferent or sensative, and although essential to the gustative sense It should not be regarded as the proper nerve of taste', as Magendie endeavours to prove. Pneumogastric—The largest of the three branches and whilst within the jugular foramen it exhibits a ^n-ey or ganglionic structure, but usually without any well- marked enlargement; from this two branches come off, one, very fine and slender, joins the ganglion of An- dersch, and a second, which is named the auricular nerve of Arnold, passes backwards and outwards between the jugular vein and the bone, enters a canal at the posterior and external part of the jugular fossa, and reaches the portio dura, with which it emerges from the stylo-mastoid foramen, and having, whilst in the jugu- lar lossa, given an anastomotic twig to the nerve of Ja- cobson. It divides into three small branches, of which one joms the facial, the second communicates with the posterior auricular of the same nerve, and a third pass- ing over that crest of bone, uniting the vaginal and 1 auditory processes, which often presents a groove in this situation, terminates on the cartilage of the ear Ine trunk, having now emerged from the jugular fora' I men, lies in front of the internal jugular vein, being (here crossed by the hypo-glossal nerve; then, passing ■ backwards and inwards, it insinuates itself between the

THE OSSEOUS SYSTEM. 140 orbit. In the inferior and external part of the cavity another remarkable fissure is observed, called the spheno-maxillary; it is hour-glass in shape, broad at either extremity, and contracted a little behind its centre; its direction is backwards and inwards, and it has the following boundaries:—externally the great wing of the sphenoid, internally the orbital plate of the superior maxillary and palate, and anteriorly the edge of the malar; it transmits small twigs from the internal maxillary artery for the supply of the inferior muscles, and the orbital twig of the superior maxillary nerve, to anastomose with the lachrymal on the outer wall of the orbit, in which two or three small foramina are visible for the transmission of the superficialis mal^ and temporo-malar; these are here given off from them after they unite. In the internal Avail, and to- wards its posterior part, two small round holes are visible, apart from each other about a quarter of an inch; they are called the anterior and posterior ethmoidal, because they are occasionally proper to that bone. They transmit, the anterior, a small artery, and the nasal twig of the ophthalmic, the posterior, a small artery only. In the front part of the internal wall, we likewise observe the opening of the nasal duct, which has already been fully examined in the description of the nose. The upper wall presents only a single hole, sometimes a notch, just at its verge, for the supra-orbi- tal artery and nerve, while the lower can scarcely be said to be similarly circumstanced, as the infra-orbital hole is the termination of a canal which, properly speak- ing, is without the cavity. Having now completed the outside of the skull, we must next proceed to take a slight review of its inte- rior. This may be done by making a horizontal section from a little above the superciliary arches, and carried back to the occipital protuberance, which will give us two portions for examination,—a superior, constituting the vault; and an inferior, comprising the cerebral fossae. The vault of the cranium is arched, both antero- posteriorly and laterally, formed on either side by the greater portions of the parietal bones, with a small part of the squamous plates of the temporal; behind by

The posterior branch of the middle meningeal winds backwards, indenting the squamous plate of the temporal bone, and anastomosing with the posterior meningeal from the vertebral or occipital. Be- sides those branches which are given off for the supply of the dura mater and bone, it likewise distributes several small ones to the Casserian ganglion, as well as a very constant offset which passes directly backwards beneath that ganglion, and accompanies the Vidian nerve into the aqueduct of Fallopius, where it anatomoses with the stvlo-mastoid branch of the posterior auricular Inferior Dental arises from the internal maxillary a little anterior to the last; it passes downwards and outwards between the ramus of the jaw, and internal lateral ligament, and behind the inferior dental nerve; as it enters the dental hole, it throws off a minute fila- ment to accompany the mylo-hyoid nerve to the poste- rior border of that muscle, and then contmumg its course through the dental canal, and f^tributing nu- merous branches to the fangs and P}^lP till it reaches the mental hole, where it divides into two branches, incisive and mental, the former continuing alone th^ roots of the anterior teeth, and ultima ely anastomosing with its fellow of the opposite side, while the latTer emerges through the mental hole, and spread- W out into a star of branches which supplies the mu- cous membrane and muscles, ultimately anastomoses with the coronary, labial, and submental.

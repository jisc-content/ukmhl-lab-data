600 CAVITY OF THE ABDOMEN. The breast is the organ for the secretion of milk, not being fully developed until puberty; but still it is very constant in its presence, cases of total absence being unrecorded; but, on the other hand, their number may be augmented to four, as in a case recorded by Mr. Shannon, surgeon to the South Union Hospital, in the Quarterly Journal of Medical Science. _ In this ex- ample the supernumerary organ secreted with the same freedom as those occupying the normal position. As conglomerate glands their structure is exceedingly com- plex, a circumstance that would scarcely be expected when it is remembered that milk may be vicariously secreted by the mucous membrane and skin, and also, that the fluid is found in the blood as pregnancy ap- proaches its termination, from which it might be inferred that the glands are merely outlets for the secretion.

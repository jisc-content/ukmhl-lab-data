694 NERVOUS SYSTEM. bending inwards in front of this vessel, whicb throws off the comes nervi phrenici, to accompany it in the rest of its course, it becomes internal to it; reaching now the pericardium, to which it is bound down by the pleura, it runs down in front of the roots of the lung, along the sides of this fibrous bag, till it arrives at the upper surface of the diaphragm, where its pecu- liar mode of distribution to this muscle will be pre- sently described. The Left Phrenic, on entering the thorax, lies at first external to the pneumogastric nerve, but as it passes over the transverse portion of the arch of the aorta, and beneath the left vena innominata, it crosses and becomes internal to that nerve. In the remainder of its course it has similar relations to the right; but it is of greater length, as the diaphragm does not descend as high on this side as it does on the other; its direc- tion is also more oblique, from the tendency of the apex of the heart to the left side. On reaching the diaphragm the nerves from opposite sides anastomose by trans- verse filaments behind the cava, and then, dividing into numerous branches, supply both surfaces of the muscle, some ramifying between it and the pleura, others be- tween it and the peritoneum, and several extending out as far as its costal attachments; twigs are likewise sent down to supply the crura, but it is doubtful whether any filaments are given to the solar plexus. It may be necessary to observe, that a great difference in size oc- casionally may exist in the nerves of opposite sides. It may here be remarked, that the right phrenic is con- ducted to the pericardium by the arteria innominata, and the left by the left vena innominata. The posterior branches of this plexus will be de- scribed with the similar ones of the brachial. Brachial Plexus.â€”This is exposed by removing the superficial structures from the lower and posterior part of the neck, and separating the sterno-mastoid and the an- terior scalenus from their attachments to the clavicle and rib, and throwing them upwards and forwards; it is to be presumed that the axilla has been laid open, and properly cleared of its glands and loose areolar tissue, so that by now dividing the clavicle at the junction of

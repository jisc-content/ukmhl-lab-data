LIVER. 567 lesser omentum lying to the left side of the duct and portal vein, and at the distance of about an inch, or perhaps a little more, from the transverse fissure, di- vides into two branches, a right and left, the former be- ing the larger, as it usually gives off the small branch, the cystic, to the gall bladder, while it also has to sup- ply the larger portion of the organ. Both branches penetrate the fissure at its extremities between the duct and vein, breaks up into a number of minute branches, ■which pass into the interlobular spaces; they then ra- mify on the capsule until they ultimately reach the lo- bule which they are destined to supply; these are se- verally known by the name of the vaginal, interlobular, and lobular branches; of the last a few twigs only pe- netrate the lobule, apparently for its supply, their effete blood mingling with that of the porta, to be after- wards removed by the hepatic veins. The function is principally that of nutrition to the various tissues of which the organ is composed. •Vena Portje—This is a very large trunk, deriving its blood principally from the mesenteric and splenic. From the point where it is formed, between the head of the pancreas and aorta, it passes upwards and to the right side, and when between the layers of the lesser omentum, lies on a plane posterior as well as between the artery and duct. Like the former, its primary di- vision is into two branches, which again subdivide into vagmal, interlobular, and lobular, the latter not only ramifying on the lobule, but likewise perforating its cap- sule, and forming within it a close and complicated ve- nous plexus, from which is derived, by exosmotic transu- dation, the bile, a subject to which we will again have occasion to revert, while the principal portion of its blood which remains after the elimination of this secre- tion IS conducted by a series of small branches into the centre, where they form by their union a trunk, to which the name intralobular has been applied; this ultimately emerges at the base of the lobule, where the sublobular vein is situated, and these latter, continuously uniting and increasing in size as they proceed, at length pour their blood by three or four large orifices into the vena cava inferior, as it fissures the posterior thick mar<^in

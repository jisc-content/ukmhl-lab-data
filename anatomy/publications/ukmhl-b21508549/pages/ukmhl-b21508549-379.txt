MUSCLES OF THE ABDOMEN. 369 R 3 teriorly being produced by the attachment of the iliac fascia to the posterior edge. The superior posterior edge is grooved, and gives attachment to the internal oblique, transversalis, and cremaster muscles; the posterior in- ferior surface is smooth, and forms the anterior boun- dary of the crural arch; the inner half is more horizon- tal, and about one inch from the pubis becomes twisted to form Gimbernaut's ligament. Taken with the tendon of the external oblique, which is attached to its upper edge, a sulcus is thus formed, on which the spermatic cord rests; at the pubis its fibres may be divided into decussating and direct; the former cross the anterior surface of the symphisis pubis beneath the insertion of the external oblique; the latter cross the crest of the pubis, forming a suprapubic ligament, with which the structure described by Mr. Colles is continuous. The attachment primarily is to the spine of the pubis, or more properly it rests on that salient point of bone, but is not inserted into it by any fibres. Gimbernaut's Ligament is triangular, with an ex- cavated base, looking outwards towards the crural ring, of which it forms the internal boundary; the anterior edge is continuous with Poupart's ligament; the pos- terior thin and sharp, attached to the linea ileo-pectinea, and a narrow slip may be traced outwards on that line, between the junction of the iliac and pubic portions of the fascia lata, as far as the ileo-pubal eminence. The anterior surface looks downwards, forwards, and out- wards, and corresponds to the attachment of Hey's liga- ment ; the posterior looks upwards and backwards, and is in contact with the conjoined tendons of the internal oblique and transversalis. It would appear that in the formation of Poupart's ligament the tendon of the ex- ternal oblique became inflected, and then, turning up- wards on the deep surface of the abdominal wall, it forms the fascia transversalis, so that the internal oblique and transversalis muscles are placed between two aponeuro- tic layers. From the anatomical arrangements of this, it will be seen, that position adopted so as to relax its attachments must tend to facilitate the return of hernial protrusions that escape at any point of the crural arch; also that pressure, in order to be elFectual on the arterial

650 NERVOUS SYSTEM. character, with the Rachidian veins and posterior vagi- nal ligament; secondly, it does not form sinuses, nei- ther does it send prolongations or processes into the structure which it invests; thirdly, it is much thinner, and presents the fibrous character in a less marked de- gree; and fourthly, it is less vascular and adheres less intimately to the subjacent arachnoid. It must not, however, be supposed that it closely invests the cord, as it is in reality much too large for it, and the inter- val which exists between them is left for the purpose of affording room for the subarachnoid fluid, which is found in the canal in some quantity. In structure the dura mater is essentially fibrous, and its vascular supply is derived from several sources: viz, deep cervical, intercostal, lumbar and sacral, Avhile its veins terminate in those of the Rachidian system. With respect to its nerves, it has not as yet been clearly demonstrated whether they exist at all. Arachnoid is the serous envelope of the cord, conti- nuous with that of the cranium, and is remarkable for its delicacy and tenuity: it consists of two layers,â€”an external or parietal, and an internal or visceral; the for- mer lines the entire of the outer fibrous membrane just described, sending off around each of the nerves, as they escape through its foramina, processes which are again reflected back on the sheaths in cul de sacs; the visce- ral layer does not embrace the cord tensely, but an in- terval exists between them of variable capacity in dif- ferent individuals and at diflPerent periods of life, and this can be clearly demonstrated either by inflation or injection of any liquid material; this has been called the subarachnoid space, first pointed out by Haller, after- wards by Cotugno, and lastly by Magendie, whose di- rect experiments conclusively establish the fact oi its existence. It consists of a thin transparent fluid, wliicn, surrounding the cord in all directions, defends it Irom those shocks and concussions to which it would have been otherwise so liable, while it likewise communicates with similar spaces in the cranium, and, according to some authors, with the ventricles of the brain. Long fibrous filaments, described by Rainey as nervous, con- nect this loose sac of the arachnoid with the subjacent

MUSCLES OP THE FORE-ARM. 351 Relations—It is covered by the fascia and posterior annular ligament; lies between the extensor minimi di- giti and the short radial extensor, and rests on the su- pinator brevis, the posterior interosseous artery and nerve, the extensors of the thumb and index finger, also on the raditis, wrist, metacarpus, and phalanges. Action.—To extend the phalanges, the wrist-joint, and fore-arm; in consequence of the slip to the index finger being free, it can act separately; but many per- sons can also extend either of the other fingers inde- pendently; this may be acquired by habit. Extensor Minimi Digiti.—Internal to the last; arises narrow and tendinous from the external condyle, from the fibrous septa, which separate it from the com- mon and ulnar extensors; forms a narrow fleshy belly, compressed laterally, succeeded by a small flat tendon below the middle of the fore-arm, which passes on the back of the articulation between the radius and ulna, retained by the posterior annular ligament, and provided with a bursa; it continues its course over the fifth me- tacarpal bone, on which it is retained by a fibrous sheath and synovial membrane; at the head of the me- tacarpal bone it receives a slip from the common ex- tensor, and is inserted into the posterior aspect of the phalanges of the little finger, exactly in a similar man- ner to that muscle. Relations.—It lies on the extensors of the thumb and index finger; the ulna, carpus, metacarpal bone, and phalanges, between the common and ulnar extensors, covered by the fascia and annular ligament. Use—To extend the fifth finger and carpus; it may also slightly adduct the hand. Extensor Carpi Ulnaris arises by a triangular ten- don from the posterior part of the external condyle, from the posterior surface and middle third of the posterior ridge of the ulna; also from the fascia which covers it. The tendon commences in the fleshy structure of the muscle, and at the inferior third it appears on the pos- terior surface, constituting a semipenniform muscle; it runs beneath the posterior annular ligament in an oblique groove, internal and posterior to the styloid process of the ulna, provided with a bursa; passes then behind the wrist-ioint, and increasing somewhat in

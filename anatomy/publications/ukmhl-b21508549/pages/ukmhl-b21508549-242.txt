232 THE MUSCULAR SYSTEM. lunar fold is placed with its concavity directed out- wards ; it is the rudiment of the third eyelid in the pre- daceous birds. In some persons, and particularly those who have resided in warm climates, this fold is large, lax, and protrudes between the lids when they are opposed. At the internal extremity of the last, the caruncula lachrymalis forms a projecting pea-shaped tubercle; it consists of a congeries of mucous follicles, surrounded by conjunctiva, small in the child, but gradually increasing with age, and sometimes project- ing between the lids, also developing short hairs from its surfaces. Several uses are ascribed to it,—namely, to act as a barrier to prevent the escape of tears from the triangular depression at the internal canthus (lacus lachrymarum); likewise to prevent the accurate approxi- mation of the punctal portion of the lids, and allow the tears to enter those openings; or to oppose the too great inversion of the lids; and lastly, to secrete an additional quantity of mucus, to defend the reservoir from the saline and irritating tears. The sclerotic portion is pale, but thick, the closeness of its adhesion increasing as the cornea is approached; on the cornea the epithelium is still present, but the anterior elastic cornea constitutes the basement membrane; this structure is thin and perfectly transparent, in all other respects being similar to a mucous membrane. In the superior and external part of the upper palpebral sinus, from twelve to six- teen small openings are with difficulty seen, forming a semi-ellipse, occasionally appearing as dark points (Zinn); these are the openings of the ducts of the lachrymal gland, from which the tears are eflfused on the free surface of the globe; they are brought more fully into view by rubbing the conjunctiva corresponding to their open- ings with any coloured fluid, as ink or white paint. Meibomian Follicles.—At the junction of the edge with the posterior surface of the lids, a number of small openings are now visible, from forty to fifty in the upper, and about thirty in the lower; they lie be- tween the conjunctiva and the tarsal cartilages, which they groove. Each follicle, commencing at the orifice, consists of a single tube; this bifurcates and some- times communicates with a similar division on each

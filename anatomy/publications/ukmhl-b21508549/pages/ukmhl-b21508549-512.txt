1 502 CAVITY OF THE CHEST. tioed. It consists of a series of ganglia, twelve in num- ber, on either side united with each other by vertical filaments, and lying on the neck of the several ribs, from which they are separated by the stellate ligaments, and are covered by the pleura. Delicate filaments from the sixth, seventh, eighth, ninth, and tenth thoracic ganglia pass downwards and inwards, forming a single nerve opposite the tenth dorsal vertebrae; these pierce the crura, the left occasionally passing through the aortic opening, and ultimately in the abdomen, there formino- the semilunar ganglia from which is derived the sofar plexus. The lesser splanchnic are likewise left and right; they are formed by fine filaments from the tenth and eleventh thoracic ganglia; they then pierce the crura, and form in the abdomen the renal plexus. Vena Azygos arises in the abdomen from the as- cendino- lumbar loops which surround the transverse pro- cesses of the vertebra in that region; it passes through the aortic opening on the right side of that vessel, and the thoracic duct; ascends on the rignt side of the pos- terior mediastinum, and at the fourth dorsal vertebra curves forwards over the root of the lung, and enters the descending cava, as that vessel is about to perforate the pericardium, and one inch above its termination. In this course it receives the bronchial, esophageal, and intercostal veins, and is destitute of valves. _ _ Thoracic Duct commences at a dilated reservoir m the cavity of the abdomen, named receptaculum chyii, and its diameter is about equal to a goose-quiU when distended; ascending through the aortic opening, be- tween that vessel and the vena azygos, it enters the pos- terior mediastinum, and passes upwards internal to the vena azygos, and opposite the fourth dorsal vertebra becomes posterior to the oesophagus, pa^««!^^f left extremity of the transverse portion of the arch of tliP aorti above this lying posterior to the ongm of the ft rublvkn artery;'^ the duct occupies a space bounded internally by the left carotid and trachea, externally by the subclavian, posteriorly by the oesopha-- eus andi front by the left vena innommata; passing Upwards as far as the sixth cervical vertebra, it curve.

BRANCHES OF INTERNAL CAROTID. 803 through the optic foramen in the same sheath, but lying at first inferior, and then external, to the optic nerve, in the latter position being between the sixth nerve and external rectus, and behind the lenticular ganglion; it next crosses forwards and inwards, above the optic, and below the nasal and superior rectus, then between the superior oblique and internal rectus, where it ter- minates in its ultimate branches. Collateral Branches.—While external to the optic nerve,—lachrymal and arteria centralis retinse; while above it,—ciliary, muscular, and supra-orbital; and while internal to it,—anterior and posterior ethmoidal, nasal, frontal, and palpebral. Lachrymal.—This is usually the largest branch of the ophthalmic; it passes forwards and outwards, invested in a fibrous tubule of the dura mater, in company with its corresponding nerve, till it reaches the lachrymal gland, where it breaks up into a number of filaments for its supply, sending a long branch forwards, which, piercing the broad tarsal ligament, anastomoses on the eyelid with the superior palpebral, forming the superior palpebral arch. In cases where the lachrymal branch is small, it is always reinforced by the twig from the in- ternal maxillary, already alluded to in the description of that artery. Arteria Centralis Retina—Remarkable for its tenuity; it pierces the optic nerve at first obliquely, and then, running directly through its centre, expands into a number of filaments, which radiate on the surface of the retina as far as its circumference; a distinct branch perforates the vitreous humour, and can be traced to the capsule of the lens. Ciliary Branches.—These may be divided into pos- terior, middle, and anterior; the first are extremely numerous, but very small; they form a complicated plexus around the optic nerve, and then, perforating the sclerotic, are distributed to the choroid and ciliary- processes; the second are only two in number, which also perforate the sclerotic, but at some distance from the optic nerve; they then pass forwards, between the sclerotic and choroid, along the horizontal axis of the eye, and before reaching the iris bifurcate, and inclose

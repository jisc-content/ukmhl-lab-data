THE MUSCULAR STSTEM. 368 tliey are the tendinous intersections of the rectus abdo- minis ; one is situated on a line with the ensiform carti- lage; the second about one inch below it; the third opposite to the umbilicus; sometimes a fourth and fifth exist, but always below the latter point. Umbilicus.—This depression is situated in the linea alba, a little below its centre, but when the integument has been removed it becomes prominent as at birth. In foetal life it transmitted the umbilical vein from the mo- ther to the child, and the hypogastric arteries from the latter to the placenta, also the urachus, and the ompha- lo-meseraic artery and vein; the depression which ulti- mately remains aft^-r the sloughing or ulceration of the cord is attributed to the umbilical vein drawing the integument upwards and backwards, and the hypogas- tric arteries downwards and backwards. In conse- quence of a portion of the intestinal tube being deve- loped external to the abdomen, this opening is frequently the seat of congenital hernias. When it passes directly through the umbilicus, the tumour presents depressions on the surface corresponding to the vessels of the cord; but in the adult form of umbilical hernia, it protrudes on either side of the opening; sometimes on both, when the tumour is divided by a septum. The situation would naturally point to the colon as the probable con- tents, but it may, however, contain merely omentum. Openings of communication of a square shape are ob- ■ served in various parts of the tendon, for the passage of vessels; these may become the seat of ventral hernise, when subject to" continued distention and debilitating influences. Poupart's Ligament This fibrous cord is formed by the folded inferior edge o^ the external oblique, and has three attachments, the first being to the anterior superior spinous process of the ilium, which it appears to embrace; the second to the spine of the pubis, and the third, broad and expanded, into the linea ilio-pec- tinea. In the iliac half it is ciirved, the convexity look- ing downwards and outwards; this arch is preserved by the attachment of the iliac portion of fascia lata, and can be obliterated by flexing and rotating the thigh in- wards ; it is also concave forwards, the convexity pos-

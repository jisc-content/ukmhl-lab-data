'188 THE ANATOMY OF THE JOINTS. Superior Calcaneo-scaphoid Ligament.— This is smaller and weaker than the last, extending between the anterior edge of the os calcis and the outer side of the scaphoid. It appears to be an offset from the inter- nal calcaneo-cuboid ligament, and must be exposed in the same manner. UNION BETWEEN THE SCAPHOID AND CUBOID BONES. This is sometimes immediate,—small articular facettes existing on the adjacent surfaces of the bones for mu- tual contact, at other times they do not touch; how- ever, under either circumstances, they are united by a strong interosseous, and a superior and inferior, liga- ment. Interosseous Ligament.—This is short, but of great strength. It consists of a series of fibres, some trans- verse and some decussating, stretching between the op- posite bones. Superior Ligament—This is a narrow, flat band of fibres, extending obliquely outwards from the upper surface of the scaphoid to the corresponding one of the cuboid. Inferior Ligament. — Much stronger and thicker than the preceding. It arises from the outer edge of the tubercle of the scaphoid, and is inserted into the in- ner side of the cuboid, becoming continuous with the sheath of the peron^us longus. It is concealed by the origins of the deeper layer of the plantar muscles. This articulation is very strong, as may be proved by endeavouring to tear the bones forcibly from each other. articulations between the SCAPHOID AND CUNEIFORM BONES. The three cuneiform bones are in direct contact with the scaphoid, and are united by dorsal, plantar, and in- terosseous ligaments. Dorsal.—These are narrow slips, extending betweeu the superior surface of the adjacent bones. In the ar- ticulation between the internal cuneiform and the sea-

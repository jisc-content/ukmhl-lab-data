266 THE MUSCULAR SYSTEM. gual gland and genio-liyoglossus muscle, then running forwards and upwards, it pierces the mucous mem- brane of the sublingual space opposite the inferior in- cisor teeth, the exact situation of its termination being marked by a papilla on either side of the fraenum linguae. The facial artery runs through the posterior edge of the body of the gland, occasionally dividing it into two distinct lobes; the vascular supply, which is very abun- dant, is derived from this trunk and its submental branch, as well as from the sublingual branch of the lingual artery; the veins are subsidiary to the forma- tion of the facial. If the posterior margin of the mylo- hyoid muscle be drawn forwards, or a few of its ex- ternal fibres divided, on following the gustatory nerve forwards, two branches are seen to be detached from it; these pass downwards to the posterior edge of the gland, and there form a gray swelling or ganglion (the submax- illary), which again sends two branches upwards to reach the formative nerve further on in its course; this ganglion also receives filaments of the sympathetic, con- ducted by the facial artery, and the branches which it yields are lost in the gland and on the coats of the duct; the chorda tympani is conceived to be the principal source of this ganglion, and if it be received in the light of a branch of the portio dura, it will probably preside over the active movements of the ducts of the glands. In addition to the foregoing, filaments from the mylo- hyoid branch of the inferior dental nerve can be traced into the substance of the gland; between it and the ramus of the jaw three or four lymphatic glands are situated; these receive the absorbents, which are few in number, and of but slight importance. Structural Anatom7j.â€”l^he capsule surrounding the lo- bules is exceedingly weak; it is consequently much more easy to unravel the tissue of this gland than that of the parotid; the smaller tubes coalesce to form the ultmiate duct which is peculiar for its large size, the thmness of its coats, and the length of its course, with its vicinity to the mucous membrane of the mouth. When any ob- struction occurs to its orifice it easily suffers distention, eventuating frequently in the formation ot calculi from the solid elements of the salivary secretion; the amount

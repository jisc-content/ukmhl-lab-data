I 816 ARTERIES AND VEINS. brachial plexus, middle and posterior scaleni, splenius colli, and serratus posticus superior, Eemarks.—It will be recollected that this artery is found in the two posterior triangles of the neck, viz., in the apex of the lower, and base of the upper, in both situations being comparatively superficial, as it is covered by the skin and fascia only; and in its descent along the base of the scapula it is often found buried in the insertion of the serratus magnus. At its termina- tion it occupies the triangular interval, circumscribed by the trapezius above; the latissimus dorsi below, and posterior border of scapula externally. Anomalies.—It may arise by a common trunk with the transversalis humeri, or from the subclavian m its first, second, or third stages. Collateral Branches.—Two in number,—super- ficial cervical and spinal. , r .-u Superficial Cervical arises from the angle of the transversalis colli, as it bends downwards beneath the levator anguli scapulae, and ascends beneath the trape- zius, supplying it with the glands and areolar tissue, and anastomosing with the vertebral and occipital. Spinal—Generally a large branch, arising Irom the artery while it lies at the base of the scapula; it passes inwards, supplying the erectors of the spine, and com- municating Avith the posterior intercostals. Transversalis Humeri, or Suprascapular, arises, likewise, from the back part of the thyroid axis, passes downwards and backwards to the superior costa of the scapula, and entering the supraspinous iossa above the transverse ligament, and through the fibres of the omo- hyoid muscle, divides into two branches,-the superior supplying the supraspinatus, while the inferior winds downwards between the spine of the scapu a and edge of the glenoid cavity, and under the spino-glenoid liga- ment, supplying the infraspinatus muscle, and anasto- mosing with the circumflexus scapula. Eelations.-Anteriorly, sterno-mastoid f^^^^'f^J^' ternal jugular vein, clavicle, trapezius, and omo-hyo d posteriorly, scaleni, phrenic, and brachial plexus, with subclavian artery in its third stage. Remarks.-This vessel crosses the subclavian artery

449 MUSCLES OP THE THIGH. the ilium, as well as into the sciatic notch, the tendon is torn from the fleshy fibres, but rarely from its insertion into the bone. ANTERIOR REGION OF THE THIGH. Let the thigh be supported on a block, the anterior surface directed forwards, and prolong the incision pre- viously made in the examination of femoral hernia, downwards and inwards, to two inches below the in- ternal condyle of the tibia; reflect the flaps of skin, and the superficial fascia is exposed; internally this is thick, but not so dense as on the external side; the in- ternal saphenous vein is seen internally, and also the in- ternal posterior cutaneous branch joining it; several cuta- neous nerves are also observed; the external cutaneous, a branch of the musculo-cutaneous, and the middle cu- taneous, a branch of the anterior crural, pierce the sar- torius and fascia lata three inches below Poupart's liga- ment; the internal cutaneous, also derived from the anterior crural, perforates the fascia and sartorius about two inches inferior to the last, and is sometimes double; lastly, a branch of the internal saphenous pierces the sartorius and fascia, and, curving forwards, one filament forms a plexus on the patella, the other ramifies on the inner side of the knee-joint and the internal and ante- rior surface of the leg. The crural branch of the geni- to-crural and short saphenous nerves have been already described; but in addition to these, two or three small, slender, and flat branches of the anterior crural pierce the fascia, and accompany the vein in the thigh. Thus on the anterior, external, and internal aspects of the thigh, there are seven cutaneous nerves, five being de- rived from the anterior crural or its branches, and two from branches of the lumbar pi exus. Now remove the superficial fascia, and clean the surface of the fascia lata. Fascia Lata.â€”Although descriptions of individual parts of the great fibrous investment of the thigh have been already given, still, in conformity with the conve- nience of examination, it will be preferable at present to speak of the whole structure extending from the limit of the thigh above, to the knee-joint inferiorly, as it ex-

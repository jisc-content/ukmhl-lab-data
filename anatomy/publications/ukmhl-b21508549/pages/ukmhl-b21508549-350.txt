340 THE MUSCULAR SYSTEM, possess distinct sheaths; but this is only well marked on the ulnar side in the inferior third of the fore-arm. Anterior Annular Ligament—A strong aponeu- rotic band or arch, stretched across the carpus, attached internally to the pisiform and hamulus of the unciform bone, and externally to the trapezium and scaphoid. It is deeper and more defined on the external side, but stronger internally in consequence of a slip sent off from the tendon of the flexor carpi ulnaris to bind down the ulnar nerve and artery; the tendon of this muscle ap- pears to split the ligament in this situation as well as the tendon of the radial flexor externally, but with the latter this arrangement is only exceptional; to its upper edo-e the fascia of the fore-arm is intimately attached; to°its lower margin the palmar aponeurosis adheres, but only to those superficial fibres which have a verti- cal direction; the anterior surface corresponds to the flexor ulnaris and palmaris longus tendons, the ulnar and median cutaneous nerves, superficalis vols, and ulnar arteries; the deep surface completes an osteo-fi- brous canal of communication between the fore-arm and palmar region, bounded behind by the concave anterior aspect of the carpus; it therefore necessarily occurs that the space is semilunar in figure, straight before, hollowed out behind, and gives transmission to the ten- dons of the flexor sublimis, profundus, pollicis, and ra- dialis muscles; the branches of the median and anterior interosseal arteries; the median nerve lying between the superficial and deep flexors. The use of this fibrous arch is to retain the tendons in their position during the contraction of the muscles, and to facilitate their movements a large bursa surrounds them, which will be alluded to hereafter. In the fatty areolar tissue which covers the palmar fascia posteriorly, a small cutaneous muscle is situated, but is not invariably present. _ Palmaris BREVis.—Thin and indistinct; arises from the annular ligament internal to the abductor pollicis, and passes forwards and inwards, being inserted into the superficial surface of the fascia, covering the muscles of the little finger, sometimes continued for some distance posteriorly. It is subcutaneous, and rests on the palmar

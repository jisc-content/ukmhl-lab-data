548 CAVITY OF THE ABDOMEN. Mucous Membrane.â€”The pendulous ring which this forms at the pylorus has been already alluded to. From this point it forms a complete lining for the small in- testine, as far as its junction with the caecum. _ In or- der to observe the various modifications which it exhi- bits in its lengthened course, it will be necessary to di- vide longitudinally portions of the duodenum, jejunum, and ilium, and examine them under water, when seve- ral of their peculiarities, which would not otherwise be visible, will at once become manifest. The mucous membrane of the superior transverse portion of the duodenum is generally uniform in its character, presenting a smooth velvet-like appearance, of a pale pinkish hue, but as we pass on to its vertical and inferior transverse divisions, a gradual change en- sues both in its colour and general surface, the biliary secretion imparting to it a yellowish-brown shade, while it is elevated into numerous ridges, taking a transverse direction, called valvulse conniventes, separated from each other by a series of corresponding furrows or depressions. These mucous folds are most evident in the lower parts, more especially in the neighbour- hood of the opening of the ductus communis choledo- chus, the aperture for which is visible a little above the inferior angle on the posterior internal surface of the gut, marked out by a papilla which becomes very apparent under water. The valvulae conniventes rarely form perfect circles, but more generally large segments, embracing about three-fourths of the cylmder, their extremities bifurcating and becoming insensibly lost on the adjacent surfaces, being always most promi- nent on the anterior wall of the intestine. These folds are not peculiar to the duodenum only, but are found also in the jejunum and ilium, but they gradually diminish both in size and number as we descend, form- ing little more than linear elevations in the last-named portion. On dissection they are found to be folds ot fine areolar tissue, supported on the fibrous framework of the gut, and covered by the mucous membrane. According to the opinion of some anatomists, they are said to be of use in favouring the rapid distention ot the gut, but this theory cannot be correct, as the ut-

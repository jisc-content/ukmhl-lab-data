852 ARTERIES AND VEINS. and cross tlie iscliio-rectal fossa, tlirougli the fat of this region, and are distributed to the verge of the anus, anas- tomosing with the superior and middle hsemorrhoidal. Transverse Perineal—A short, thick trunk, which arises a little external to the last; it perforates the obtu- rator fascia and base of triangular ligament; runs in- wards and forwards, at first behind, then below, and ultimately in front, of the transverse perineal muscle, reaches the accelerator urinse, which it supplies, and anastomoses with its fellow of the opposite side. Long Perineal Longer, but smaller in caliber than the last, in common with which it usually arises; it also pierces the obturator fascia and base of triangular liga- ment, and, running upwards, forwards, and inwards through the ischio-bulbar space, between the erector penis and accelerator urings, reaches the root of the scrotum, where it divides into two branches,—an in- ternal, which supplies the scrotum, and communicates with its fellow of the opposite side; and an external, which ramifies on the outside of the scrotum, anasto- mosing with the superficial pudic of the femoral. Artery of the Bulb.—This arises from the pudic, as the latter vessel lies between the layers of the triangular ligament; it passes upwards and inwards, anterior and inferior to Guthrie's muscle, and before reaching the urethra divides into two branches,—bulbar and glan- dular ; the former, large, pierces the anterior layer of the triangular ligament, enters the bulb, to the substance of which and the spongy structure of the urethra it is distributed, while the latter, which is very small, sup- plies Cowper's glands. The artery of the bulb, while be- tween the layers of the triangular ligament, lies about half-an-inch above its base. Anomalies.—This artery may be sometimes double, and occasionally takes a very peculiar course to reach its destination, running at first from its origin directly inwards towards the mesial line along the lower edge of the triangular ligament, and then descending nearly ver- tically to the urethra: under these circumstances it always arises about half-an-inch posterior to its ordinary position. Artery of the Cavernous Structure arises oppo-

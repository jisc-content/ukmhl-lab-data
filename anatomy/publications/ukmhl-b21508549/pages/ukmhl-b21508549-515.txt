POSTERIOR MEDIASTINUM. 505 served that the oesophageal muscular tunic constitutes an example of the insensible transition from the volun- tary to the involuntary class of muscular fibre. Mucous Membrane—This is thick and pale, con- trastmg m colour with the gastric and pharyngeal por- tions; its external surface is rough, and covered by lax areolar tissue, the fibrous framework of which is thin and weak, adhering more intimately to the muscular coat than to the mucous membrane. The internal sur- face is wrinkled, and presents from ten to fifteen lono-i- tudinal phcffi or folds, which terminate at the cardfac orifice of the stomach in projecting fringes; a dense epi- thelium, by some described as a cuticular layer, covers the free aspect, and this can be raised by subjecting the membrane to the action of an acid; it appears to termi- nate m the festoons at the cardiac orifice; but this is only apparent, as it is continued through the whole ali- ■ mentary canal, although with altered anatomical cha- racters. Organization or Vascular Supply This is derived from the inferior thyroid arteries in the neck, aorta in the thorax, and coronaria ventriculi in the abdomen- the veins openmg into the inferior thyroid, mammarv' cava, and azygos, and in the abdomen into the Gastric and phrenic. The lymphatics open into the glands which surround the tube, and the nerves are derived from the pneumogastric. ?75e.—The oesophagus urges and transmits the food to the stomach. The Thoracic Aorta commences opposite to the lower edge of the body of the third dorsal vertebra at most m the mesian line, and descends on the anterior surface of the spine to the tenth dorsal, where, incSg towards the left side and projecting towards the cavity of the lef pleura, it enters the aortic canal to become abdominal. It is covered anteriorly by the lower edee oftheroot ofthe left lung, pericardium, heart' tfo- phagus, and pneumogastric nerves, and lies on the sninp anterior vaginal ligament, left intercostal veins and vena azygos minor; to its left side are the left lung and pleura, and to the right vena azygos major, with the thoracic duct.

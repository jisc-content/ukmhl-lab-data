509 PERICARDIUM. the lungs. The pericardium is a sero-fibro-serous sac, which contains the heart and great vessels, conical in shape; the base below, attached to the diaphragm'at its central tendinous portion, and also to the fleshy fibres of the left leaf for a short extent; from the former it may be detached as a distinct layer in the foetus, while in the adult the adhesion is rather intimate posteriorly, but quite inseparable anteriorly, or towards the ster- num ; the apex superiorly is prolonged on the great vessels, becoming continuous with the fascia of the neck: laterally it corresponds to the concave surfaces of the lungs and their roots, in front to the sternum in the centre, from which, however, it is separated by cellular tissue, also on the left side to the cartilages of the fifth, sixth, and sometimes seventh rib, with the intervention of the left lung, which, being notched at the thin anterior border, permits a portion of the peri- cardium to become superficial in the space between the fifth and sixth ribs. The phrenic nerves, with the ar- terias comites nervi phrenici, lie between the pleural investment and the fibrous layer, while posteriorly it is related to the posterior mediastinum and its contents. The Pericardium consists of three distinct struc- tures: first, a serous layer, derived from the pleura, which is only a partial investment, deficient in a nar- row space anteriorly and posteriorly; also at the base, where the fibrous layer is attached to the diaphragm, as well as in those positions where vessels enter and leave. The fibrous layer by its superficial surface is attached to the pleura, but rather loosely, some fat often intervening in old subjects, and by its deep sur- face It IS intimately connected with the serous pericar- dium. In the adult nine perforations occur in its struc- ture,â€”one for the aorta, two for the cav^, a similar number for the right and left pulmonary arteries, and four for the pulmonary veins, an additional perforation existing m the foetus, constituting a tenth for the duc- tus arteriosus. These openings are undefined, in con- sequence of a process from the sac being prolonged on their coats as they enter and leave towards their differ- ent destinations. Now lay open the sac by a crucial incision on the anterior surface; internally it presents

THE ANATOMY OF THE JOINTS. 196 longed a few fibres of the subclavius muscle and a small quantity of adipose tissue. The coraco-clavicular liga- ments are endued with great strength, and their obvious use is to prevent dislocation of the clavicle upwards on the acromion process of the scapula. They likewise, in a great measure, limit the backward and forward move- ment of the shoulder, which might be otherwise carried to a dangerous extent, as far as the security of the sterno-ciavicular articulation is concerned. ACROMIO-CLAVICULAR ARTICULATION. This is an arthrodial joint, formed by the union of the outer end of the clavicle with the inner side of the acromion process, connected by two ligaments,—a su- perior and inferior, with occasionally an interarticular fibro-cartilage. Superior Ligament—This is exposed by removing the deltoid and trapezius, with their aponeurosis which covers the articulation. It consists of a series of dense, strong fibres, stretching from the upper surface of the clavicle to that of the acromion process, being much stronger posteriorly than anteriorly. Inferior Ligament.—This is similar to the last, but weaker in its character. It is always covered with a quantity of adipose tissue, from which it is sometimes exceedingly difficult to isolate it. Interarticular Cartilage. — This we have very rarely had an opportunity of observing; where it does exist it is always thin, and only occupies the upper part of the articulation. Synovial Membrane—Small, and merely suflScient to cover the opposing articulating surfaces; it is some- times deficient. Motions.—These are both gliding and rotatory; both are pretty extensive, from the looseness of the connect- ing ligaments. The security of the articulation is much enhanced from the manner in which the two great muscles, the deltoid and trapezius, embrace it before and behind,—serving, in fact, as powerful ligaments to guard against displacement.

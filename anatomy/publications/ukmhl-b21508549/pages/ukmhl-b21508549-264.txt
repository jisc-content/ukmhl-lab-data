254 THE MUSCULAR SYSTEM. divides into two branches,—temporo-facial and cer- vico-facial, that communicate in their diverging course through the gland, forming the pes anserinus, or paro- tidean plexus; deeper than this is seen the external carotid, coursing upwards, between the anterior edge of the sterno-mastoid and the ramus of the jaw, deep below, more superficial about half-an-inch inferior to the condyle, where it divides into the temporal, internal maxillary and transverse facial branches; there is also another small artery in the lower part of the gland,—the posterior auris that runs upwards and backwards to reach the ear. For each of those parts enumerated it is obvious that there must be apertures in the fibrous capsule of the gland; now if the gland be dissected up from below, and the deep layer of the capsule removed, the lingual, spinal-accessory, glosso-pharyngeal, pneu- mogastric, and sympathetic nerves, the internal carotid, and jugular vein, become visible. THE MUSCLES OF THE NECK. The region of the neck may be divided into anterior and posterior cervical; the former consists of all that space which is included between the ramus of the jaw above, the clavicles and interclavicular ligament below, and bounded behind by the anterior margins of the trapezii muscles; this space is unequally concave at either side of the middle line, but presenting many well-marked prominences in the latter situation; these can only be properly understood when the student has dissected the parts; any enumeration of them will, there- fore, be avoided until the larynx is being examined in de- tail. Eaise the shoulders of the subject by a block, and allow the head to droop; then secure it to one side by hooks, so as to render tense the integument; make an inci- sion from the chin to the sternum, carry another back- wards along the ramus of the jaw; and lastly, along the clavicle to its acromial extremity; raise the skin from before backwards, carefully avoiding the subjacent parts, as the fineness of this investment may cause a mistake to be committed in this respect. The areolar tissue is fine, but small in quantity, beneath the skin, and connects

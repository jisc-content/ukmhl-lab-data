590 CAVITY OF THE ABDOMEN. towhicliitseems to be attached by the peritoneum exter- nally and posteriorly, and internally by the continuity of the mucous membrane, and intermediately by the fusion of the fibrous layers of the canal with the elastic tissue of the cervix uteri; the inferior or vulvar extre- mity is usually closed and compressed laterally, being surrounded by the sphincter vaginse, which, arising from the sphincter ani, and a dense tendinous point poste- riorly, divides into two portions that surround the ex- tremity of the vagina, and uniting again in front, but again separating, ascend to be inserted into the dor- sum of the clitoris. Structure The vagina is composed of five distinct layers, which are,â€”most internally, mucous; then inter- nal, fibrous; external to this, erectile layer; still more externally, the external fibrous coat; and lastly, an areolo-contractile tissue resembling the dartos. The mucous layer is continued from the vulvar, covermg the sphincter vaginae, and forming in the virgin asemi- elliptical fold at the orifice, named the hymen, which occupies generally the posterior or inferior fourth of the opening when expanded, but in some cases forming a complete occluding membrane, with a small aperture m the centre, or this last may even be absent m some cases, constituting imperforate hymen. This struc- ture is peculiar to the human species only, and never to- tally'absent in the virgin state; but where the hymen ceases to exist a few small projecting tubercles (carun- culffi myrtiformes) mark its ruptured remains, btiii tracino- the membrane within the canal, its vascularity diminrshes, while its surface is marked by transverse folds which are more numerous inferiorly, and on these are observed the openings of themucous glands of the va- ffin^; two longitudinal folds (columns vagina) are like- wise present on its anterior and posterior walls. The mu- cous lining having now reached the upper part ol the canal, is reflected downwards on the surface ot the cer- vix uteri, and into the os, becoming here much finer and paler, and at the same time more adherent to the sub- jacent structures, while by its reflection [7;^ ^he va- gina on the uterus, a circular sulcus is left between fhose parts, much deeper before than behind.

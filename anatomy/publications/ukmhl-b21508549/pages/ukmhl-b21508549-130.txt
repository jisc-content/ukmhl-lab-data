120 THE OSSEOUS SYSTEM. peculiar in being developed in the primitive dental groove, like the milk teeth, from which it diifers, how- ever, in not being deciduous. The third molar, or wisdom tooth, does not reach its proper range with the other teeth until the eighteenth or twentieth year.* The stage of eruption is accomplished by absorption and continued growth of the tooth below, and occurs in the following succession :—The four central incisors about the seventh month, those of the lower jaw first; lateral incisors next appear, between seventh and tenth months ; anterior molares at the commencement of the second year; the canine between the fourteenth and twentieth months; and the posterior molares from the eighteenth to the thirty-sixth month. The permanent teeth appear at the following ages (see " Carpenter's Physiology"):— Central Incisors developed at 8 years. Lateral Incisors „ 9 » First Bicuspid „ 10 „ Second Bicuspid „ 11 » Canines „ 12-12^-years. Second Molars „ 12-14^ „ The second series of teeth are requisite, in conse- quence of the increase in the size of the jaws, and it is on this account that the primary set become deciduous. These b^ones are considered merely as calcified cell transformations of the elements of the mucous mem- brane, similar to corneous tissues. They difi'er in many respects from the bones of the true skeleton: namely, in being exposed, devoid of periosteum, con- taining chondrine instead of gelatine; in the amount of fluoride of calcium found in the enamel; in being deci- duous; and, with few exceptions, not lasting the life of the individual where senility is much prolonged. Other circumstances strengthen the opinion of their being more nearly allied to the dermal structures. Amongst the more obvious are the attachment of the teeth to the jaw by ligaments in thelophius piscatorum, • Goodsir, in Edinburgh Medical and Surgical Journal.

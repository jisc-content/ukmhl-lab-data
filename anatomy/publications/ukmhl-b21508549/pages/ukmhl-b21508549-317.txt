307 MUSCLES OF THE NECK. Action. To draw the head forwards and to one side; when both act, to bend it directly forwards. Scalenus Anticus occupies the lateral region; tri- angular in figure; arises from the anterior tubercles of the transverse processes of the third, fourth, fifth, and sometimes sixth cervical vertebrse, by tendinous, short slips, that soon become fleshy and thick; passes then downwards, forwards, and outwards, and is inserted by a tendon, about half-an-inch in width, into an oblique crest on the upper surface of the first rib. Relations Anteriorly, sterno-mastoid and omo-hy- oid; also, the posterior surface of the subclavius muscle, subclavian vein, transversalis humeri and colli arteries and veins, phrenic nerve, and ascending cervical artery, with a strong layer of fascia binding the latter parts to its surface. It lies on the subclavian artery, brachial plexus of nerves, cervicalis profunda, and superior in- tercostal arteries, the posterior scalenus, and the lower branches of the cervical plexus; the inner edge is sepa- rated from the longus colli, above by the rectus major, and below by the vertebral artery, veins, inferior cervi- cal ganglion, and the subclavian trunk; the external margin is in contact with the trapezius. Action. To fix the first rib; also to bend the head to one side. Scalenus Posticus, sometimes considered as two mus- cles ; it arises by tendinous slips from the posterior tu- bercles on the transverse processes of all the cervical vertebras, except the first and last; the fibres pass down- wards and outwards, separating into two fasciculi, which are inserted into the first rib behind the subclavian ar- tery ; also into the upper edge of the second; but this attachment is sometimes wanting, and in its place a long slender muscular band passes from that rib to the trans- verse process of the atlas; this may be called the scale- nus posticus minor, to distinguish it from a small band that is brought into view by cutting across the anterior scalenus, and throwing it upwards, when a short but broad fasciculus may be observed arising from the sixth transverse process, and passing downwards and forwards, is inserted into the first rib, separating the subclavian I

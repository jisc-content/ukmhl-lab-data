869 BRANCHES OF ANTERIOR TIBIAL. the extensor pollicis, whicli is internal to it, and the inner tendon of the extensor commtinis, which is exter- nal to it, covered only by the integuments and fascia; and on reaching the base of the metatarsal bone of the great toe, it divides into its terminal branches. Collateral Branches.—Tarsal, metatarsal, commu- nicating, and princeps pollicis. Tarsal.—Generally a small branch, arising imme- diately below the annular ligament; it passes outwards and forwards beneath the extensor brevis, supplying it and the structures of the dorsum of the foot, and ulti- mately bending backwards and outwards, terminates at the external malleohis by anastomosing with the malleo- lar, peroneal, and metatarsal. Metatarsal Larger than the last, below which it arises; it also bends downwards and outwards beneath the common extensor tendons, and then, arching back- wards and outwards, terminates at the external malleo- lus by communicating with the peroneal and tarsal; from the convexity of the arch, which is directed towards the toes, four digital branches are given off, which, bi- furcating at the clefts between each of the four outer toes, supply their adjacent sides, while three interos- seous branches are detached from it inferiorly to supply those muscles, and to anastomose with similar ones from the deep plantar arch. CoMMDNiCATiNG BRANCH may be considered as the true termination of the dorsalis pedis; it comes off in common Avith the princeps pollicis, and, piercing the first interosseous spaces, inosculates with the external plantar. Princeps Pollicis arises in common with the last, and runs downwards and forwards along the first inter- osseous space, crossed by the inner tendon of the ex- tensor brevis, and, dividing into two branches, the internal is distributed to the inner side of the great toe, while the external, subdividing, supplies the opposed surface, of the great and second toes. Remarks.—The supply of the toes may be thus briefly recapitulated. The muscular structure of the three outer toes and a half is supplied by the deep plantar arch, while that of the great toe, and half the second,

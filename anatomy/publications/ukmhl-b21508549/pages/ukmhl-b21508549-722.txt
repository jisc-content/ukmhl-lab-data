The third or accessory cutaneous passes downwards along the inner side of the sartorius, and about its middle divides into two branches,â€”a superficial, which, becoming cuta- neous, and crossing to the inner side of the thigh, ac- companies the internal saphenous vein as far as the in- ternal condyle, where it joins the nerve of the same name; and a deep, which runs on the anterior surface of the femoral artery in the inferior fourth of its course, and terminates in forming a plexus around it as it passes through the aperture in the adductor magnus to reach the popliteal space, anastomosing here freely with the articular branch of the obturator. _ Internal SAPHENOUS.-This nerve is remarkable from its very long course, and from its distribution must be also Considered as cutaneous. It arises from the inner side of the plexus, receiYiDg immediately after its origin a twig of communication from the obturator which runs between the femoral and profunda arteries in order to reach it; passing then downwards at farst lying to the outside of the former vessel, but fterward diectly in front of it; at the lower part of Hunter s canal where the artery winds backwards and outwards to enter the popliteal space through the openiBg m the triceps it leaves it altogether, crossing to its mner side, where It gets into company with the anastomotica mag- na runs downwards along the tendon of the adductor mm then between the tendons o the gracilis and Trforius, and at the inner side of the knee becomes cu- taneous, and joins the internal saphenous vem, lying at fir anterior'to it, then behind it, and then m fron o it again; with it, along the posterior and ^"^^^P^^/^^^ the le-, it continues Its course, passing m front of the nte nal malleolus, and then winding forwards on the inner side of the foot, the ^^^^^S^^-^^^^f :^^:\t.^h the nliP^ as far as the great toe.

NERVOUS SYSTEM. 636 the columella; the inferior anterior surface, somewhat convex, bounds the fourth ventricle and the aqueduct of Sylvius above. Vieussens believed that this lamina acted as a valve to the aqueduct of Sylvius, but this is ob- viously an error, and it is only when a transverse sec- tion is made near the anterior part of the superior cerebellar peduncles that any such appearance exists. We will now more particularly describe the walls of the fourth ventricle. This cavity is of a rhomboidal figure, contracted above and below, and expanded in the centre, the anterior inferior wall being ibrmed by that portion of the isthmus encephali consisting of the pons varolii and the posterior surface of the medulla oblongata, on which the restiform bodies, posterior pyra- mids, and calamus scriptorius, are seen; the superior posterior wall is formed by the valve of Vieussens and superior vermiform process; its posterior, by the cere- bellum ; and still more inferiorly by the arachnoid mem- brane and valvules Tarini, which are merely thickened portions of the pia mater passing from the cerebellum to the cord; the anterior superior angle corresponds to the aqueduct of Sylvius, and the inferior communicates with the spinal subarachnoid space, whilst the lateral are formed by the processus a cerebello ad testes. The choroid plexus of the fourth ventricle are two folds of pia mater, narrow below, but expanding somewhat in their ascent; they pass upwards and outwards from the inferior vermiform process, as far as the centre of the fourth ventricle, then turn horizontally outwards on the back-part of the restiform bodies, here separating the portio mollis and dura of the seventh pair of nerves, and, having reached the under surface of the subpedun- cular lobules, they expand on their surface, becoming continuous with the general pia mater. Let the student now reverse that portion of the brain which remains, or, what is preferable, procure a fresh organ for the examination of the base. The brain, on its inferior surface, is somewhat irre- o-ular, and divided into three lobes, which are symme- trical on each side of the mesian line, named anterior, middle, and posterior. The anterior is triangular, the base anteriorly and externally, the apex posteriorly and

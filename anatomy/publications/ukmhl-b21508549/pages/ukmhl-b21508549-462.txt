452 THE MUSCULAR SYSTEM, action it is associated with the glutaeus medius and mi- nimus by the superior glutaeal nerve, Sartorius.—Long and prismatic; it occupies the ex- ternal, anterior, and inner sides of the thigh, and the superior part of the leg; it arises from the anterior su- perior spine of the ilium, and from the upper part of a notch below that process by a flat tendon, more marked posteriorly than anteriorly; it becomes fleshy almost immediately, and passes at first downwards and inwards, then vertically downwards on the internal side of the thigh, courses behind the internal condyle of the femur, then, becoming tendinous, it curves forwards oyer the internal condyle of the tibia, the tendon expanding be- low the inner side of the knee-joint, and is inserted into the internal and anterior side of the tibia, below the condyle, and above the gracilis and semitendinosus. Belations.—This is the most superficial muscle of the thigh, and the longest in the body, consequently its deep relations are numerous; it is immediately beneath the fascia, and crosses the psoas, iliacus, and rectus muscles, the femoral artery, vein, and internal saphenous nerve, the vastus internus, adductors longus, magnus, and gra- cilis, the internal lateral ligament of the knee-jomt, and the tibia in its upper third; the inner edge forms the outer boundary of Scarpa's angle, and it, therefore, serves as a guide to the femoral artery in this region; in the middle third it lies on a strong fascia which con- stitutes the anterior wall of Hunter's canal, but always inclining to the internal portion; and in the operation of securing the artery in this region it is a disputed point as to whether it should be drawn outwards, in- wards, or divided; from the figure of the surface and the connexions of the muscle there is not a doubt,—and of this we have satisfied ourselves frequently,—but that it can be drawn inwards with far greater facility than in the opposite direction; inferior to this the muscle lies between the gracilis and vastus internus, the saphena vein and nerve lying at its posterior margin; as the tendon curves forwards it is concave upwards and tor- wards, and convex downwards and backwards; from the former a thin layer is continued over the synovial membrane of the knee-joint as far as the patella; from

674 NERVOUS SYSTEM. vicinity of the otic ganglion, courses along the inner surface of the muscle and supplies it. Otic or Arnold's Ganglion.—This small nervous centre may either be dissected from v?ithin by removing the petro-pharyngeal aponeurosis and Eustachian tube, or, having turned inwards the internal pterygoid, the inferior maxillary nerve should be cut across, when it will be found on its inner side. The ganglion is smaU and grey, like the ophthalmic, and possesses three roots, —one, short, from the internal pterygoid branch of the inferior maxillary; the second long, being the nervous petrosus superficialis minor, derived from the tympanic plexus; while the third is grey and soft, and comes off from the sympathetic as it surrounds the middle menin- geal artery. Its relations are the following :_Externally the inferior maxillary nerve, above the origin of its exter- nal branches; internally the Eustachian tube; anteriorly the tensor palati and the posterior edge of the internal pterygoid muscle; and posteriorly, the middle menin- geal artery, and a nervous plexus which surrounds that vessel Its branches are four,—one to the tensor tyra- pani, "a second to the tensor palati, a third to the Eus- tachian tube, and a fourth to communicate with the temporo-auricular branch. . j , The absence of this ganglion has been noticed by many anatomists, but we have invariably found it pre- sent, but with some variety as to the origin of its short root which has sometimes arisen from the trunk ot the inferior maxillary, instead of from its internal pterygoid ^^Temporo-auricular Branch.—The smallest of the three internal divisions of the nerve; arises from its outer and back part, near the base of the skull, and passes backwards and outwards between the Eustachian tube and the external pterygoid ^^'^^^'^ ^^'^'^''''^'''^^^^^^ two branches, which, having surrounded the middle me- ninc^eal artery, again unite into a single nerve which Tuus between the internal lateral ligament and the neck of the lower jaw, here dividing into a superior and in- ferior branch; the former winding round the posterior part of the superficial temporal artery and then ascend- ?ng oa the temporal region, superficial to the artery of

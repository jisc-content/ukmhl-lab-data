NERVOUS SYSTEM. 700 between the superficial and deep flexors of the fingers, passes beneath the annular ligament to the radial side of the flexor commiTnis, between it and the flexor pol- licis, reaches the palm of the hand, where it is flattened and expanded, lying beneath the palmar fascia above and posterior to the superficial arch of arteries; here it divides into six terminal branches, of which the most external is muscular, and destined for the muscles of the ballof the thumb, while the remaining five are distri- buted in the following manner : â€”One runs to the outer side of the thumb; a second to its inner side; a third to the outer side of the index finger; a fourth to the cleft between the index and middle, there subdividing to supply their opposed surfaces; and a fifth to the cleft between the middle and ring fingers, which likewise subdivides for their opposed surfaces. Those digital nerves pass beneath the arterial arch, but on arriving at the base of the first phalanges, the digital arteries split the former, so that the nerves become the most superficial, but opposite the middle of the second phalanx they again re-perforate, assuming again their primary position with respect to each other, which they retain to their termination, and besides the continued trunk which is destined for the anterior aspect of the fingers, each throws off a dorsal lateral branch, which sup- plies the root of the nail. The termination ot the ante- rior filaments is peculiar, ending in loops, which are distributed to the tactile papillae of the extremities of the fingers. In connexion with this nerve, we con- ceive it a proper place to allude to a series of re- markable structures which are found principally m the extremities, but not solely confined to them, called after the name of their discoverer, Paccinian corpuscles. Thev are situated in the areolar tissue on the extremi- ties ^ot the small offsets thrown off from the trunk of Te nerve, and are connectod to it by the neurdemma which is prolonged over them. In figure they are ge- ZevaUy oval, averaging in length in the human subject a line or perhaps a little more, and they consist of a series'of In^iina. from thirty to sixty in number, over- lamoTng each other like the layers of an onion, but with hi difference, that all the layers, with the exception

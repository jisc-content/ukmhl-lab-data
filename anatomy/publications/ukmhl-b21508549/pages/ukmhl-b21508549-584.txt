574 CAVITY OF THE ABDOMEN. the cava, this latter vessel is more or less filled with the effete blood of the lower extremity, and hence naturally ensues a mixed fluid, which, pursuing the course already indicated, is destined for the supply of the upper por- tion of the trunk, while the lower receives a stream still more degenerated, owing to its admixture with the re- turning venous blood of the former. The appearance presented by the infant at birth serves to confirm in a great measure the correctness of this scheme of the cir- culation, as there exists a marked disparity in the de- velopment of its upper and lower parts, showing the excess of nutrition Avhich the former receives when com- pared with the latter; the enormous size of the liver, too, would aid in strengthening the theory. The par- tially oxydized condition of the blood at this period of existence can be only compared to the state of the cir- culation as exemplified in the reptile. But with the first inhalation of the atmospheric air a change rapidly ensues: the lungs expand and protrude the elastic walls of the thorax, at the same time forcing downwards the diaphragm, thus causing a species of vacuum to which the blood, gorging the right side of the heart and pul- monary trunk, finds a readier access than pursuing its original course through the ductus arteriosus, which now becomes useless, and, pressed on by the left bron- chus, is gradually converted into a ligamentous cord. Ramifying over the air-cells, and receiving its vital pro- perties from their contents, it is again brought back to the heart by the pulmonary veins, which thus distend the left auricle with their blood, at the same moment that the right is filled with that from the two cava;. The equable pressure thus produced on the valvular opening of the fossa ovalis either causes its complete occlusion, or at least prevents any admixture from taking place between the two currents. Independent existence now established, the ligature encircles the placental ves- sels thus severing the bond of union that connected it to the parent; while the portal circulation, assuming its proper activity, renders useless the ductus venosus, which is ultimately obliterated completely by the pres- sure of the diaphragm as it gradually descends. _ Spleen occupies the left hypochondriac region m its

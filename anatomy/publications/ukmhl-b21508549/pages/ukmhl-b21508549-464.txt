454 THE MUSCULAE SYSTEM. ment is not in the same direction, passing downwards and outwards. Relations and Structure.—is a bipenniforni mus- cle the fibres diverging from a central tendon; the ten- don of origin is prolonged on the anterior surface to ia- cilitate the movements of the sartorius, whilst that ot insertion commences on the posterior surface to allow a similar gliding on the subjacent crureus. The external tendon lies on the bone and capsular ligament of the hip- ioint, and is covered by the glutaius minimus, medius, and tensor vaginae muscles. We have seen this tendon absent in advanced cases of rheumatic arthritis; the in- ternal tendon lies between the external and the iliacus, which overlaps it, and the remainder of the united ten- don lies on the great trochanter and vasti, covered by the sartorius; the external branches of the external cir- cumflex artery separate the deep surface from the crureus above, and below descending branches of the same artery are found between these muscles; in its in- ferior three-fourths it is only covered by the fascia lata. The fibres of this muscle are not above two inches in lencrth, so that contracting one-third of the length ot each they will only draw up the patella to such an ex- tent'as to cause extension of the leg, but in consequence of the bipenniform arrangement, the fibres are multi- plied as to number, greatly augmenting the power of ?he muscle. In some rare instances the tendon may be ruptured above the patella, but in the majority that bone or its ligament yields before the tendon. A trans- verse section of the rectus exhibits the^orifaces of nu- merous branches of the external circumflex, and proves the large vascular supply of the muscle Vastus ExTEENUS—Flat and expanded; lies on the outer side of the thigh; it is tendinous superiorly and ex nally, also mfenorly and internally, and larger above than below; it arises fleshy from the anterior part of the base of the great trochanter, which frequently exhibits a cres at this point, from the outer lip of the hne lead- tnrr from the great trochanter to the linea aspera, also rom t7e ute'r side of that line, from the lemur, rom the external intermuscular septum and fascia lata; finally from the external condyloid line, external to the

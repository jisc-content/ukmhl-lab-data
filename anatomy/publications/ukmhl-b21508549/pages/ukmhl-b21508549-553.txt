STOMACH. 543 tical section, are found to terminate by a c£Bcal extre- mity in the submncons tissue. These are the gastric follicles for the secretion of that fluid so essential to the process of chymification,—the gastric juice, consisting of muriatic, acetic, and lactic acid, the first jareponderating in quantity,—and of muriates of lime, potash, and soda, and a peculiar product termed pepsin. The walls of the alveoli, or depressions, in which those tubes are placed, are thickly studded with follicles similar to those of Lie- berliuhn in the small intestine; they dip into the mu- cous membrane nearly as far as the submucous tissue, and their cavity is lined internally by an aggregation of conoidal epithelial cells, so closely packed together, as only to leave at their free extremity a very minute orifice for the escape of the mucous secretion, while the intervals between the several follicles are filled up by a vascular network, which extends to the surface of the stomach, covered also by a layer of epithelium. With respect to the action of the several planes of muscular fibres of the stomach, the particular function of each has not as yet been accurately determined. The researches of Dr. Beaumont have, however, established the fact, that the food during chymification performs a rotatory movement from left to right along the great curvature of the stomach, and again from right to left along its lesser. It might be therefore assumed, that the longitudinal fibres of its upper and lower borders, by being alternately in a state of relaxation and contrac- tion, would have a tendency to impart this motion; while the oblique, situated at its great extremity, woiild na- turally, by their tension, expel it from the large cul de sac of the organ; the function of the circular is evi- dently to propel such portions as are properly chymified through the pyloric orifice into the duodenum. The arteries which supply the stomach are, the coro- nary from the caaliac axis, and the superior pyloric from the hepatic, inosculating between the layers of the lesser omentum on its concave border; and the two epiploic, the one a branch of the gastro-duodenalis, the other of the splenic, anastomosing on its inferior between the folds of the great omentum, with some large twigs from the latter,—the vasa brevia, confined especially to its

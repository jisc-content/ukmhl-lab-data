MUSCLES OF THE ABDOMEN. 469 Psoas Magnus—Narrow above and below, wide in the centre, placed on the sides of the spine, on the brim of the pelvis and on the anterior and inner part of the thigh; it arises by short tendinous fibres from the an- terior surface of the transverse processes of all the lum- bar vertebrse; also from the sides of the bodies of the two last dorsal and four first lumbar by tendinous arches, five in number, the extremities of each being attached to the projecting margin of the vertebras and intervertebral substances; beneath these arches pass the lumbar arteries and veins, with branches of the sym- pathetic nerve; the fibres, forming a thick mass, pass downAvards and outwards over the brim, drooping a little into the cavity of the true pelvis, then pass un- der Poupart's ligament, and form a tendon on its outer side, but continuing fleshy internally; in the thigh it turns at first downwards, backwards, and inwards, af- terwards is reflected a little outwards, and is inserted into the posterior and inferior part of the lesser trochan- ter and the ridge below that point. Relations—Superiorly, or in the abdominal portion, it is covered by the crus of the diaphragm and ligamen- tum arcuatum internum, psoas parvus, kidney, and renal vessels, the ureter, spermatic vessels, iliac fascia, external iliac artery, and genito-crural nerve; poste- riorly it rests on the transverse processes of the verte- brae, quadratus lumborum, from which it is separated by the external branches of the lumbar arteries and the anterior lamina of the transversalis abdominis ten- don; also by a few branches of the lumbar plexus; be- low this on the brim of the pelvis and iliac sulcus. ' The internal edge corresponds to the crus of the diaphragm and sympathetic trunk, and the external to the quadra- tus lumborum, and lower down to the iliacus internus and anterior crural nerve. In the femoral portion it is covered by the sartorius, femoral artery and vein, pro- funda artery and vein, external circumflex, and the an- terior layer of the pubic fascia; and it lies on the cap- sular ligament of the hip-joint, a bursa and the posterior layer of the pubic fascia intervening. Sometimes this bursa communicates with the joint, a deficiency existing- in the capsule, in which case the tendon of the muscle

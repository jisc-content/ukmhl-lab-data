MUSCLES OF THE LEG. 483 an opposite direction, as well as by the musculus acces- sorius, which is also attached to it. Tibialis Posticus lies in the interosseous space, and arises from the inner and posterior edge of the fibula, from the outer margin of the tibia below and ex- ternal to the solseus and flexor communis, interosseous ligament, and also from the fascia which covers it; pass- ing downwards and inwards, it forms a tendon that runs inwards under the flexor communis, appearing on its inner margin at the internal malleolus, where they are contained in the same groove and fibrous sheath; it then passes into the sole of the foot beneath the calca- neo-scaphoid ligament, usually having a sesamoid bone at this point; the tendon is then inserted into the tu- bercle on the under surface of the navicular bone; secondly, into the internal cuneiform; thirdly, by an external slip which passes over the two external cunei- form into the base of the second and third metatarsal and cuboid bone, but sometimes it does not reach the latter. Relations—It lies on the tibia, fibula, and interos- seous ligament in the leg, and is overlapped by the flexors communis and poUicis, and posterior tibial ves- sels and nerve. In the foot it lies on the internal lateral ligament, in a strong fibrous sheath, and beneath the calcaneo-scaphoid above the adductor pollicis; at its ori- gin the anterior tibial vessels run between its heads often carrying fibres of the muscle through the interos- seous ligament to its anterior surface. Action.—To extend the ankle-joint, also to turn the toot inwards, co-operating with the tibialis anticus. iLEXOR Pollicis Longus is the most external of the deep muscles, and also the largest and most fleshy It arises from the two inferior thirds of the posterior and external surface of the fibula, from the septum of the tibialis posticus, and also from a fibrous layer which separates it from the peronsei; the muscle continuing fleshy to the ankle receives a slight attachment from the interosseous ligament; the tendon is first clearly vi- sible at the posterior edge of the tibia, which it some- times slightly grooves; an oblique notch in the posterior edge of the astragalus then receives the tendon, where it Y 2

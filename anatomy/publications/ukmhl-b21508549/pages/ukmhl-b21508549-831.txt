821 AXILLAKY ARTERY. the axilla, varying in size according to the height the arm is elevated. The interior of the cavity, when cleaned of its contents, represents a cone with three sides, the apex corresponding to the coracoid process superiorly, and its base to the latissimus dorsi, teres major, and great pectoral, the interspace between the two iirst and last of these muscles being completed by the integument, fascia, and a few muscular bands stretched between their opposite margins, through which the branches of the intercosto-humeral nerves ramify in their course to reach the back and inner side of the arm. The boundaries of this space may be thus briefly stated:—Anteriorly, both pec- torals and ligamentum bicorne, the lesser pectoral, how- ever, only forming a partial covering, being deficient both- above and below; internally, ribs, intercostal muscles, and serratus magnus; and posteriorly and externally, subscapular, teres major, and latissimus dorsi. In its na- tural condition it is filled up by a quantity of lax watery areolar tissue, numerous glands, axillary artery and vein, with their branches, brachial plexus, and intercosto- humeral nerves. The axillary glands observe the fol- lowing arrangement, being divisible into four sets, the first is irregularly scattered through the cavity; the second being found on its posterior wall in company with the subscapular artery; the third on its anterior with the thoracica longa; and the fourth passes upwards with the axillary trunk itself and becomes continuous with those of the neck. This, accordingly, implies the existence of a communication between the cervical re- gion and the axilla, which may be thus shortly defined. The clavicle anteriorly diverges from the first rib pos- teriorly and internally as they pass outwards, leaving between them a triangular interval Avhich is bounded externally by the superior costa of the scapula and root of the coracoid process, and through this pass in order from within outwards,—subclavian vein, artery, Avith accompanying lymphatics, and brachial pie xus, oi'course including its supraclavicular branches. 'J'he inferior outlet ol' the axilla communicates with the brachial re- gion, and is close to the humerus, bounded in front by the insertion of the great pectoral; behind by the con- joined tendons of the latissimus dorsi and teres major-

364 THE MUSCULAR SYSTEM. with the lumbar region; in addition to the cutaneous branches already described, the scrotal branch of the ilio-scrotal and hypogastric branch of ilio-hypogastric escape through the external ring, or through the tendon external to that point; the genital branch of the geni- to-cranial also passes through the ring, but is not dis- tributed to the integument of the abdomen as the two former always are. The cutaneous arteries are branches of the intercos- tals, with perforating twigs of the deep epigastric and mammary, and in addition to these, three branches are found on the surface more or less regular, namely, su- perficial epigastric, external circumflex ilii, and superior external pudic. Superficial Epigastric arises from the femoral, from three-quarters to an inch below Poupart's liga- ment; it first passes forwards piercing the sheath of the vessels and cribriform fascia, then turns upwards, for- wards and inwards, passing over Poupart's ligament, and can be traced to a point corresponding to the um- bilicus, sending branches through the tendon of the external oblique to communicate with the deep epigas- tric and also with the inferior intercostals; this vessel is accompanied by two veins which lie on either side ot it, and ultimately terminate in the curve of the internal saphena as it is about piercing the fascia. . . ^ External Circumflex Iliiâ€”Smaller than the last, from which it sometimes arises, but is usually a branch of the femoral, springing from its outer side; it pierces the sheath of the vessels, courses for some distance be- neath the iliac portion of fascia lata, which it also per- forates, then runs parallel but below Poupart s_ liga- ment, gives off branches to the glands, and terminates at the crest of the ilium by anastomosing with super- ficial branches of the internal circumflex ilu; the accom- panvins veins have a similar termination to the last. Superficial PuDic.-The superior arises from the fe- moral, pierces the cribriform or pubic portion of fascia lata, and, having emerged from the sheath ol the vessels superficial to tlie femoral vein, it theii crosses the cord and runs upwards over the spine of the pubis, supplies the mons veneris in the female, and the tegumentary

INGUINAL HERNIA. 383 long period, the deep ring is carried inwards, and the external pillar of the sup'erficial ring, yielding in the out- ward direction, the two openings are approximated, the inguinal canal shortened, with a consequent diminution of that obliquity, characteristic of that form of hernia of which we speak, so that it becomes often impossible to determine the nature of the case from the mere fact of direction. Connecting this circumstance with the close relation of the internal epigastric artery, which in recent and small protrusions lies only a quarter of an inch internal to the neck of the sac, and in old forms being m much closer proximity, in many cases presentino- a concavity, mto the outer side of which the hernia is°re- ceived, we will appreciate the advice of Sir A. Cooper, who proposes that in all cases where it is dithcult to discnmmate whether the protrusion is by the oblique or direct descent, to cut upwards directly when divid- ing the structure. Now replace the coverings which have been raised and examine the parts which must be divided in an ope- ration lor the relief of a strangulated inguinal hernia by the oblique descent; these are,—integument, super- hcial, and Scarpa's fascia. Camper's bands or external spouthke fascia, cremaster, fascia propria, and peritoneal sac, with a small portion of the tendon of the external obhque above the external ring; the incision should commence a little above the external ring, and be carried downwards and inwards in the axis of the tumour for about two and a half inches; each covering must be divided cautiously, by raising a portion with the for- ceps and then making a small aperture, cutting with the kniie held horizontally, and subsequently introduc- ing the director, so as to divide each successive layer to an extent similar to the original incision. According to the number of layers divided, so should the caution of the surgeon increase, for although, as a general rule, the coverings are thickened, there are exceptions, one ot which we observed in a case operated on by Dr Jameson m Mercer's Plospital, where they were so at- tenuated that the sac was exposed by the removal of two layers only. Having arrived at the sac, which is recog- nised in the majority of cases by its smooth and free

1/ PIA MATER, 619 contained; but the predominance of the fluid inferiorly in the vicinity of the large vessels which supply the or- gan would seem to imply an equalizing function in re- ference to the cerebral circulation. In the description of the visceral portion of the arachnoid membrane we have not as yet alluded to that involuted part particu- larly noticed by Bichat, and after him by Monro. If the posterior part of the hemispheres is raised, immedi- ately above the superior vermiform process of the cere- bellum the venffi Galens are seen emerging, and around them a process of arachnoid entering the centre of the brain, while in connexion with them we may often ob- serve a circular aperture (foramen of Bichat); but this, however, is not always present. Still we hardly think that the latter occurrence, even if constant, should ne- gative the fact of the continuity of the whole arachnoid; and we would believe, from the frequent examinations of fojtal brains, that the perfect continuity of ventri- cular and external arachnoid should be received as an established fact; nor is the similarity which has been traced between the foramen of Bichat and that of Wins- low in the abdomen the effort of imagination that some writers seem to think. Dr. Sharpey conceives that a distinct but fine serous layer lines the subarachnoid spaces, and may also reach the ventricles, passing down in a similar situation to line the subarachnoid space of the cord; but the absence of an epithelial layer on the deep surface of the arachnoid is sufficient to render this view at least questionable. The arachnoid consists of a surface layer of pavement epithelium, with a thin basement membrane, supported by a fine but lax areo- lar tissue. Its vascular supply is limited, perhaps only amounting to nutritive imbibition, and even when in- flamed It fails to exhibit any trace of vascularity, beintr only rendered opaque in that morbid condition. The use of this membrane appears to be for the purpose of facilitating the almost imperceptible movements of the brain, synchronous with the circulatory and respiratory rhythms.

832 ARTERIES AND VEINS. anterior and posterior carpal, with the superficial and deep, its terminal branches. Anterior Ulnar Recurrent.—Very small, arising from the front of the ulnar immediately below the bifur- cation of the brachial; it passes upwards and inwards on the brachialis anticus, and under the pronator teres, and anastomoses with the anastomotica magna. Posterior Ulnar Recurrent.—Larger than the preceding, with which it often arises in common; it runs upwards and backwards, between the flexor sub- limis and flexor carpi ulnaris, anastomosing between the two heads of the latter, and under the ulnar nerve with the inferior profunda and anastomotica magna. Interosseous.—A large trunk, about three-quarters of an inch in length, arising from the back part of the ulnar, about an inch below its origin; it passes down- wards, backwards, and outwards, as far as the tubercle of the radius, where it divides into two branches,—an anterior and posterior. Anterior Interosseous extends from the upper ed"-e of the ligament of the same name to the pronator quadratus, where it terminates in supplying that mus- cle, and in sending a branch backwards to communicate with the posterior interosseous, posterior carpal, and perforating. Relations.—Anteriorly, flexor sublimis; posteriorly, interosseous ligament; externally, flexor poUicis; and internally, flexor profundus. , , , i Posterior Interosseous passes backwards through a quadrilateral foramen; bounded superiorly by the oblique ligament; inferiorly by the interosseous; and on either side by the radius and ulna. Arriving now between the superficial and deep extensors, it breaks up into a lash of branches for the supply of those muscles, sending one large branch upwards, between the anconeus and supinator brevis, to anastomose with the musculo-spiral and vertical branches of the superior profunda and ano- ther downwards to communicate on the back ot the carpus with the anterior interosseous, posterior carpal, and perforating from the deep palmar arch. _ Median BRANCiL-Alwaysconstant, but very variable in size; arising sometimes from the ulnar, and sometimes

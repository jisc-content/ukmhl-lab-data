258 THE MUSCULAR SYSTEM. them; and above, the ramus of the jaw with the parotid gland. The deep, or prevertebral layer will be fully- described subsequent to the removal of the pharynx. Now remove the fascia, and expose the sterno-mas- toid muscle, also remove the deeper layer of fascia, and the cellular tissue occupying the interspaces between the vessels and nerves. Sterno-mastoid.—Broad and flat below, narrow in the middle, expanded again superiorly; it arises by an oval tendon from the upper and anterior surface of the first bone of the sternum, also by a broad tendon, from the upper edge of the external third of the clavicle; a narrow triangular space intervenes between these at- tachments; the sternal portion ascends obliquely up- wards and backwards; the clavicular, wider and thinner, passes vertically upwards behind the sternal; about the middle of the neck they become united, and imme- diately below the mastoid process form a strong tendon, weak and expanded posteriorly, which is inserted into the outer and posterior part of the mastoid process, above its apex, and into the external third of the supe- rior transverse ridge of the occipital bone. Relations.—It is covered superficially by the skin, fascia, and platysma, external jugular vein, superficialis colli and auricularis magnus nerves, parotid and posterior auris artery; it lies on the sternum, clavicle, carotid artery, subclavian and arteria innominata, jugular and subclavian veins, anterior scalenus, sterno-hyoid and thyroid, and omo-hyoid muscles, thyroid axis, phrenic nerve; above this, the brachial and cervical plexus, middle scalenus, sterno-mastoid and cervicalis ascen- dens arteries, rectus capitis anticus major, digastric and splenius, parotid gland, occipital artery, and spinal accessory nerve, which pierces its upper third. Action.—Both muscles acting will draw the head downwards and forwards; if one acts it will rotate it to the opposite side; if the head be slightly drawn back- wards, these muscles will then increase the retroflexion, as in opisthotonos. Omo-hyoideus.—Placed at the side and inferior part of the neck, consists of two fleshy bellies and a central tendon; the posterior arises, flat and tendinous, from

708 NERVOUS SYSTEM. have seen it thrown off immediately after the emer- gence of the nerve between the rib and the first lumbar vertebra, or about the centre, or towards the outer ex- tremity of the former, and it is always easily recognised by its peculiar wavy course and flattened appearance. It joins directly with the first lumbar, and hence its name dorsi-lumbar. Before concluding our account of these nerves, it may be necessary to state that each receives a communi- cating filament from the corresponding dorsal ganglion of the sympathetic; that they pass in front of the ante- rior costo-transverse ligament, and under the pleura, to reach their proper intercostal space, where they lie be- neath the artery and vein, the latter vessel, and not the former, occupying the groove in the rib above. LUMBAR PLEXUS. This is a very important plexus, and it must be exa- mined after the abdomen has been laid open and its con- tents removed; then, by raising cautiously the anterior three-fourth of the psoas, or that portion which is at- tached to the sides of the bodies of the lumbar verte- brse, it will be observed lying on the deeper origins of that muscle, where it springs from the transverse pro- cesses ; its branches must then be each cautiously fol- lowed to their destination. The plexus is formed by the first, second, third, and fourth lumbar nerves, com- municating with each other by branches nearly vertical, also by the last dorsal and twigs from the lumbar gan- glions of the sympathetic, which descend between the vertebral origins of the psoas to unite with it. These nerves will be observed to increase rapidly in size from the first to the last, which is extremely large and flattened, while the plexus formed by their junction is of a triangular shape, the base corresponding to the side of the vertebral column and the apex externally and in- feriorly constituted by the anterior crural nerve. It consists primarily of four great divisions, viz.: inguino- cutaneous, anterior crural, obturator, and lumbo-sacral. Inguino-cutaneousâ€”This, in order to be properly understood, must be again subdivided into four, which

THE OSSEOUS SYSTEM. 112 ont on either side to articulate with corresponding grooves on the under parts of the body of the bone; its inferior edge is thin, and is received into a cleft formed for its reception by the union of the palate and maxillary of opposite sides; its anterior margin is fissured above, where it receives the nasal lamella of the ethmoid; rough and serrated below, where it unites with the septal cartilage; its posterior edge is sharp and thin, looks downwards and backwards, and appears free, as the division between the posterior nares. The vomer articulates with two bones of the head,— the ethmoid and sphenoid; and four of the face,—the two palate, and two superior maxillary. It is developed from a single point of ossification, which makes its ap- pearance at its anterior margin about the eighth week; at birth it is merely a bony groove, which embraces the cartilage in front, and its complete development pro- ceeds very slowly. Inferior Maxilla This is a single bone, and has been compared in shape to a horse-shoe. In order to examine it we will divide it into a body, sides, rami, coronoid, and condyloid processes. The body, which is the most anterior part, is square in shape, present- ing an anterior and a posterior surface, and an upper and a lower margin; its lateral parts becoming continuous with the rami at each side, at a very obtuse angle; the anterior surface is convex, having in the mesial line a vertical elevation,—the point of union between the two portions of opposite sides: this has been called the sym- physis menti, and it terminates below in a prominence, triangular in shape,—the genial process; external to this, and extending outwards nearly as far as the men- tal hole, is a superficial depression, for the origin of the quadratus menti; above it is another, smaller, and not so well-marked, limited externally by the prominence of the canine tooth,—the myrtiform or incisor fossa; from it arises the levator labii inferioris; the posterior sur- face is concave and much smoother, a mere line marking out the point of junction between the two bones, and to this the frsenum linguEe or mucous fold connected to the under surface is attached; near its lower part we observe four tubercles,—the genial eminences; from the

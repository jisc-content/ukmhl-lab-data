MUSCLES OF THE THIGH. 451 rather than enumerate them individually, which could only be done' in the present stage of the dissection. The fascia lata consists of fibres passing in three different directions, the superficial transversely, the deeper lon- gitudinally, and an intermediate set of decussating, lying between the two former; the difference in direction of the fibres observed in certain situations arising not from any particular change, but from the greater deve- lopment of one set obscuring others. Now remove the fascia and examine the muscles, which on this region are,—tensor vagina femoris, sartorius, vastus externus, vastus internus, rectus femoris, crureus, and sub-cru- reus. Tensor Vaginae occupies the upper and outer side of the thigh; is somewhat quadrilateral in shape, and arise tendinous from the outer side of the anterior su- perior spinous process of the ilium, and from the crest above that point, between the glutaeus medius and the iliacus internus; it passes downwards and backwards, terminating in a broad expansion anteriorly, and a num- ber of tendinous slips posteriorly, by which it is in- serted into a sheath of the fascia lata, about the superior fourth of the thigh, below and behind the great tro- chanter. Relations.—Externally it is covered by the stronger layer of fascia, which here appears tendinous; internally it corresponds to the deep layer of fascia, beneath which lie the rectus, vastus externus, and ascending branches of the external circumflex artery; also to the glutseus medius; the posterior edge lies on the glutseus medius, a deep branch of the glutagal artery, passing downwards to anastomose with the circumflex, separating them; the anterior edge corresponds above to the sartorius, but somewhat lower a triangular space intervenes, contain- ing the rectus, branches of the anterior musculo-cuta- neous nerve, with inferior ramusculi of the external circumflex artery; while the terminal branch of the superior gluta?al nerve is in its sheath. Action—To make tense the fascia, and prevent dis- placement of the vastus externus during its contraction; to flex the thigh and extend the leg by acting on the fascia lata; also to rotate the thigh inwards, in which

ARTERIES AND VEINS. 792 circumstances, the transversalis faciei is always unusu- ally large, and supplies its remaining branches. Muscular Branch arises about half-an-inch above the bifurcation of thecommon carotid, and passes horizontally backwards, to terminate in the sterno-mastoid muscle. Belations—Auteviorly, integument, platysma, and fas- cia; posteriorly, internal carotid, pneumogastric nerve, and internal jugular vein. i + Remarks.—This is usually very small, so much so that it is sometimes difficult to be demonstrated; it appears to be exclusively devoted to the sterno-mastoid muscle. Anomalies.—It occasionally arises in common with the occipital, and in many instances the Ungual nerve winds around it, and not the occipital. Occipital arises from the external carotid, about an inch above its bifurcation from the common carotid; it passes upwards, backwards, and outwards, to the pos- terior part of the scalp, where it terminates by divid- ing into two branches,_-an internal and external, which anastomose with each other, and with the temP°^^ fj^^ posterior auricular. It has been dmded m o three stages,_the first extending from its origin to the inner edge of the rectus capitis lateralis; the second while it crosses that muscle, and the third from its outer border to its ultimate termination. „ . , . ^.U Relations-First ^^a^/e-Externally, ^"tegument, p a- tvsma, fascia, and digastric muscle; internally, it crosses Lual nerve, internal carotid, pneumogastnc, spina accessory, and internal jugular vein; while above it is the parotid, a small process of which sometimes sur- """letnd Stage.-^xternBllj, integuments a^^^ f^^cia, sterno-mastoid splenius, trachelo-mastoid and origin of d^^a trie; internally, rectus capitis lateralis; supenorly Hiastoid portion of temporal bone; and mfenorly, tran. princeps cervicis.

EXTERNAL ILIAC. 853 site the subpubic ligament in company with the dor- sal artery of the penis; it perforates the crus penis on its internal and inferior wall, runs through the cellular structure of the corpus cavernosum penis, separated from its fellow of the opposite side by the septum pec- tiniforme, frequently communicating with it through its teeth; it gives off numerous capillary branches for the nutrition of the organ, and others which terminate in the venous cells, of which it is principally composed. (See Anatomy of the Penis, p. 414). Dorsal Branch.—This arises in company with the last, and winds upwards and forwards between the crus externally and the bulb internally, then between the true suspensory ligaments of the penis, along the dorsum of which it runs forwards between its correspondinrr nerve, which is on the outside, and vein, which is to its inside, till it arrives at the corona glandis; here it sinks deeply, and forms, between the truncated extremity of the corpora cavernosa and glans penis, a plexus from which numerous filaments are detached to supply the latter structure. The dorsal artery always throws oifa large cutaneous branch about the centre of the penis, which is distributed to the integument of that organ and the side of the scrotum. External Iliac arises from the common, internal but opposite to the sacro-iliac synchondrosis, and, pass- ing downwards, forwards, and outwards, terminates in the femoral at the pectineal line, a little internal to the eminence of that name. Relationi^—Anteriorly, peritoneum, Abernethy's or expansion of fascia iliaca, ureter above, and vas deferens below, internal circumflex ilii vein and genito-crural nerve; posteriorly, fascia iliaca, psoas muscle, and ac- cessory obturator nerve; externally, anterior crural nerve, but separated from it by some fibres of the psoas and fascia iliaca; and internally, its own vein below, but above it becomes posterior to it. Ramarks—We have omitted the spermatic vessels as an anterior relation for this artery, although they do occasionally lie over it near its termination; but we believe that, as the rule, they are generally external to It. The anterior crural nerve also, although external

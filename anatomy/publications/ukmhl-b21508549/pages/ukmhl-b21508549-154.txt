144 SECTION II. SYNDESMOLOGY, OR THE ANATOMY OF THE JOINTS. Ajoint or ARTICULATION inthehumaBskeletonisformed by two or more solid tissues (generally bones) united by ligaments either fixed or moveable on each other. It is complete when bone, cartilage, ligaments, and synovial membrane enter into its conformation; and incomplete when any one of these is absent. We will now proceed to examine the several structures enumerated indivi- dually. The articular extremities of bones are expanded laterally in hinge-joints, and circumferentially in the enarthrodial class for the purpose of increasing the sur- face of apposition; but this augmentation would neces- sarily produce an excess of weight inconsistent with ra- pidity of motion, if the extremity exhibited a density and compact nature similar to the shaft. But to ob- viate this inconvenience, the volume of the articular ex- tremity is composed principally of a light spongy tissue; an arrangement that would seem to incur a certain sus- ceptibility to fracture, which is prevented, first, by the shock being equally dififused over an extensive surface; and, secondly, by a thin layer of an elastic tissue (carti- lage) being interposed between the opposed surfaces. Cartilage, in connexion with joints, is observed to present two varieties: the articular, or cartilage of in- crustation, which covers and adheres to the articular extremities; and interarticular, which is placed in such situations that it tends to adapt varying convexities and concavities, as well as to diminish the intensity of those shocks to which the extremities are constantly liable. These cartilages differ from each other in struc- ture, the articular being termed true; the interarticu- lar, false or fibro-cartilage; the former consists of an hyaline or structureless basis, containing numerous cells

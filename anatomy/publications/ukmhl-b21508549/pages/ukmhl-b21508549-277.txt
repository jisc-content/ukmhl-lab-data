267 MUSCLES OF THE NECK. of the secretion of each in twenty-four hours is about four ounces. Now raise the superficial portion of the gland and throw it backwards, when the following muscles will be brought into view. Mylo-htoid.—Triangular in shape, the base at the lower jaw, the apex at the os hyoides; it arises by short, tendinous, and fleshy fibres, from the two anterior thirds of the myloid ridge of the lower jaw, extending from the maxillary attachment of the superior constric- tor to the symphisis menti; the fibres pass downwards, backwards, and inwards, and are inserted into a central tendinous raphe, common to it and the muscle of the opposite side, extending from the chin to the os hyoides, also into the upper edge of the body of that bone. Relations.— Below to the submaxillary gland, and the anterior belly of the digastric, submental, and fa- cial arteries, mylo-hyoid nerve, facial vein, with the skin, platysma, and fascia; the external edge is related to the superior constrictor, gustatory nerve, deep process of submaxillary, stylo-hyoid, and glossus muscles, stylo- hyoid ligament, lingual nerve and artery, and middle ■ constrictor; the internal edge is united with its fellow ■ of the opposite side. Now remove its insertion into the ' OS hyoides, separate the median raphe, and throw the muscle upwards towards the ramus of the jaw; it will now be seen that its upper surface is related to the fol- lowing parts, from above downwards:—The mucous membrane of the mouth, sublingual glands, deep pro- ' cess of the submaxillary, and Whartonian duct, gusta- tory nerve, hyo-glossal plexus, lingual nerve, and at the ; anterior edge of the hyo-glossus, the ranine artery, also the genio-hyoid, genio-hyo-glossus, hyo-glossus, stylo- : glossus, and lingualis muscles. Action.—To depress the lo-wer jaw; also to elevate : and draw forwards the os hyoides, and press the tongue I against the teeth if the mouth is closed, or protrude it : if it is open. It likewise forms the floor of the mouth, I and preserves the outline of the sublingual space when the cavity is distended. Genio-hyoid.—Short, fleshy, and fusiform in shape, : is placed beneath the lower edge of the genio-hyo-glossus, of which it appears to be an appendage; it arises by a N 2

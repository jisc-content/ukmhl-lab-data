408 THE MUSCULAK SYSTEM. rated from the side and inferior fundus of the bladder by the recto-vesical fascia; the posterior run downwards and backwards, inferior and posterior to the rectum; both sets then encircle the intestine, becoming united with the internal sphincter, from which the fibres can- not be distinguished; the prajcoccygeal portion passes downwards and inwards, and is inserted into the ano- coccygeal ligament; and, finally, the coccygeal fibres run backwards and inwards to be attached to the side and forepart of the coccyx. Relations and Structural Anatomy.— There is ex- treme variability in the thickness and density of this muscle in difi'erent subjects,—in some being weak and thin, with wide intervals separating its fasciculi; in other instances strong and red; but the division into bands of unequal widths is a character always present^ which renders its structure not unlike that of the diaphragm; the prostatic fibres are weak, as also the coccygeal, but the anal and prsecoccygeal are much stronger; it is not unfrequent to find the prostatic exhibiting a number of separate bands, wholly unconnected with the anal fibres. In the male there are two openings m this muscular plane, but in all other situations they are united. One opening permits the passage of the apex of the prostate, and is somewhat elliptical, wider below than above, the edges well defined, and abrupt; the second, posteriorly, is on a plane inferior to the last, and is funnel-shaped, prolonged on the rectum, and impossible to define; its circular orifice allows the rectum to pass to the anus; the superior edge is lunated, the concavity looking up- wards and backwards; in this situation the pelvic tascia splits into an internal vesical and external obturator layer, and through this medium the levator am maybe attached to the brim of the pelvis, but it is quite incor- rect to say that the muscle itself has such an_ origin. By its pelvic surface it corresponds to the anterior true ligaments of the bladder and prostate gland, to the vesical fascia and recto-vesical layer, which separates it Lm the inferior fundus of the bladder, vesicul^ semi- nales, and vasa deferentia, also to the rectum and a quantity of lax areolar tissue. The perineal surface cor- respond^ to the triangular ligament superficial sphinc- ter the reflected base of the triangular ligament, to the

THE SKULL. 125 from before backwards:—malar, frontal, great wing of sphenoid, squamous plate of temporal and parietal; in shape it is semicircular, and it affords attachment to the temporal muscle, and by its upper margin to the strong aponeurosis of the same name. Below, and slightly posterior to the temporal fossa, is the external auditory meatus, oval in figure, bounded above by the horizontal root of the zygoma, behind by the mastoid, and in front and below by the auditory process; it forms the orifice of the osseous tube of the organ of hearing; immediately posterior to it, is the mastoid process, displaying unequal degrees of development at various periods of life, its size increasing with age; it is nipple-shaped, and rough for the attachment of the muscles already described with the separate bone, and presents at its posterior superior part the emunctory hole of Santorini, commu- nicating with the great lateral sinus internally. If we now direct our attention to the true base, we will find it to be irregular on its surface, but rather quadrilateral in its outline. That part behind the foramen magnum presents in the mesial line the occipital protu- berance for the attachment of the ligamentxim nuchse; the superior and inferior semicircular lines with the groove separating them; the muscles attached to these have been already mentioned. Passing still farther forwards, we arrive at the foramen magnum, oval in shape, and long antero-posteriorly, for the transmission of the spinal cord; its vessels,—vertebral artery and spinal accessory nerve. On either side of it are the two condyles, oval in shape, and very prominent, look- ing downwards, forwards, and outwards, internally marked by a small pit for the insertion of the cheek ligaments; perforated anteriorly and posteriorly by two foramina; that in front being large and round, for the passage of the ninth nerve; that behind small, and oc- casionally absent, for the transmission of a small vein to the lateral sinus; depressed externally, they become continuous with a ridge,—the jugular, into which is inserted the rectus capitis lateralis; external to this ridge is the small groove for the occipital artery, then a slight elevation, external to which is the elongated fossa, for the origin of the digastric, which is bounded

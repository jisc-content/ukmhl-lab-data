POPLITEAL ARTERY. 861 in ligature of the femoral artery, where their caliber is increased to that of the radial. Anastomotica Magna The only branch in Hun- ter's canal which has received a name; it arises from the inner and anterior side of the femoral at the lower part of the space, and runs downwards and inwards on the upper edge of the adductor magnus tendon, in com- pany with the internal saphenous nerve, at first beneath the aponeurosis which connects it to the vastus internus, but it soon perforates it and divides into two sets of branches,—an anterior, which passes forwards and out- wards to anastomose with the superior internal articular artery; and a posterior, which winds backwards and outwards into the poplitseal space to communicate with the collateral branches of that vessel. Remarks—The femoral artery enters the poplitseal space through an oval opening, tendinous in structure, its long measurement being from above downwards, situated really in the tendon of the adductor magnus; but because two other muscles are in some degree con- nected with its margins it is usually described as having the following boundaries:—Superiorly, tendons of ad- ductor magnus and longus; inferiorly, those of the ad- ductor magnus and vastus internus; internally, adduc- tor magnus; and externally, vastus internus. This aperture is much too large for the artery and its vein, and here the sheath which invested them, being con- tinued downwards from Poupart's ligament, formed in front by a process from the transversalis fascia, and be- hind by that of the fascia iliaca, ceases to exist, or at least is incapable of demonstration beyond this point. P0PLIT.EAL Artery is the direct continuation of the femoral, commencing at the opening in the adductor, and passing downwards and slightly inwards, termi- nates at the lower margin of the poplita^us muscle. Relations—It is covered at first for about an inch by the semimembranosus, then by a quantity of fat and ■ areolar tissue, the poplitaeal nerve and vein, and the ap- proximation of the two heads of the gastrocnemius; and it is supported by the flat surface of the back of the femur, from which it is separated by a cushion of fat, ' on the ligamentum posticum of the knee-joint, a lym-

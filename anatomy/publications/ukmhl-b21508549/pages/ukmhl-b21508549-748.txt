NERVOUS SYSTEM. 738 THE ORBIT. In order to dissect this region turn the subject on the face, raised to a convenient height by a block placed beneath the chest; let a second block, with an excava- tion superiorly, be fixed beneath the chin, so as to re- tain the skull in an almost erect position, and make a saw-cut through the roof of the orbit, about a line and a half external to the internal angular process of the OS frontis, and let a second be carried through the ex- ternal angular process of the same bone, both converg- ing behind to meet at the sphenoidal fissure; but the ring of bone bounding the optic foramen above may be left entire by running the saw lightly across, about two lines anterior to the anterior clinoid process, when a few light blows of a hammer will now throw the bone forward. The orbit contains the globe of the eye, rauscles, nerves, arteries, lachrymal gland, absorbents, veins, and a quantity of soft adeps, which, occupying the interstices between the muscles, forms a soft and yielding cushion for the support of the globe, diminishing, however, in old age and all emaciating diseases, a circumstance indi- cated by the recession of the eye within the orbit. When the bone has been removed, the periosteal membrane may be observed. Periosteum. This dense white fibrous membrane is a continuation of the dura mater, entering the orbit by the foramen opticum and the sphenoidal fissure, but differs from that structure in being weaker and less - intimately adherent to the bone. It lines the whole internal surface of the orbit, and, passing forwards to the rim of the cavity, becomes continuous with the broad palpebral ligament, being nnich stronger posteriorly and internally than antoriorly and externally; and as the optic nerve enters it sends forwards a process around it to become attached to the sclerotic coat, whilst sujie- riorly and externally it splits to inclose the lachrymal gland, the outline of which is now visible, as well as a horizontal groove running from before backwards, cor- responding to the frontal nerve. Now raise the penes-

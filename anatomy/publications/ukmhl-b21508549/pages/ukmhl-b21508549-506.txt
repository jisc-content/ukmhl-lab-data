KooTS of the Lungs.—These are fixed points by which a communication is established between the heart and atmosphere on the one hand, and the lungs on the other; they consist of the bronchial tube, pulmonary artery and vein, bronchial arteries and veins, nerves, absor- bents, and areolar tissue, each being about an inch in length, bounded externally by the concave surface of the lung, which here presents a hilus, oval from above downwards, for the reception of its constituents; and internally and anteriorly by the pericardium; their length is variable, being from three-quarters to an inch and a half, and two inches from above downwards, cor- responding^ to the fourth dorsal vertebra on the left side, to the third on the right. The root of the right lung corresponds above to the curve of the vena azygos and division of the pneumogastric nerve; below to the hga- inentum latum pulmonis; anteriorly to the phrenic nerve and descending cava, and posteriorly to the vena azygos ascending in the posterior mediastmum. The root ot the left lung is bounded above by the arch of the aorta, ductus arteriosus, left laryngeal recurrent nerve, and di- vision of the pneumogastric nerve into anterior and pos- terior branches; inferiorly by the ligamentum latum pulmonis; anteriorly by the phrenic nerve; and poste- riorlv by the descending aorta. Now remove the pleura from the surface, and it will be seen that the pu mo- narv veins are the most anterior and inferior on both sides, but on the right the pulmonary artery lies above it, and most superiorly the bronchial tube, while on the left side the tube is above the vein and below the ar- tery the order being from below on the right side,—vein, artery, tube; on the left in a similar direction,-vem, tSrtery but on both, from before backwards, the orde isthesame,-namely, vein, artery,tube. Now raise the lung, and draw it to the opposite side by hooks, when, by removing the pleura, with some areolar tissue Tnd bronchial glands, the parts constituting the roots '''Bronchial TuBES.-These are continuations of the

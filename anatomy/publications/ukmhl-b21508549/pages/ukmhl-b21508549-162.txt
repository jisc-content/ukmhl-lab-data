THE ANATOMY OP THE JOINTS. 152 the occipital protuberance, and below to the prominent spine of the seventh cervical vertebra; as it passes down- wards it sends oflf thin prolongations, which are con- nected to the intervening spines, forming a species of septum between the muscles of opposite sides; from the point where this terminates the supraspinous pro- perly commences, stretching as a rounded cord from the summit of one spine to that of the next, but on reaching the lumbar region its character becomes altered, as it is here flattened out, and much stronger; they afford origin to the erectors of the spine, and are a powerful bond of union between the adjacent bones. Interspinous. — These ligaments are also deficient in the cervical region, their place being supplied by muscles; in the dorsal they are thin and diaphanous, triangular in shape, and extremely weak, but in the lumbar, where they are quadrilateral; they are very thick and strong; they extend, as their name implies, from the under part of one spine to the upper of the adjoining; and they require a very troublesome dissec- tion to expose them. Intertransverse.—This name has been applied to a few scattered fibres which extend between the adjacent transverse processes; they are very irregular in their arrangement, and sometimes do not exist at all, at least we have looked in vain for them in repeated instances; they contribute very slightly to the strength of the spi- nal column. Capsular.—These are found encircling the conti- guous articulating processes of adjoining vertebrae; they have been most unjustly described as being weak and imperfect, but such is not the case, as they are exceed- ingly strong, completely surrounding the joint, the synovial membrane of which they protect, while they confer no small degree of security on the articulation; the removal of the dense mass of muscles which over- lap them is, however, an operation tedious, and attended with much trouble. LiGAMENTA SuBFLAVA—Theso have been so named from their bright yellow colour, which is very beauti- fully seen in the fresh preparation; as it is always better to observe them from their internal surface, the

THE EAE. yg2 the band or foot of the stapes rests. The promontory which hes immediately below the hole last described is an elevated process of bone, corresponding, and indeed formed, by the first turn of the cochlea; it is marked by several small furrows or grooves for the tympanic plexus of Jacobsou the destination of which will be fully con- sidered in the section on that subject. The fenestra ro- tunda, which lies posterior and inferior to the promon- tory, is also situated in a depression or fossette; like the fenestra ovalis, it is likewise closed by a thin membrane (lesser membrana tympani), which separates the tym- panum from the tympanic scala of the cochlea, ov, to al^o into the vestibular cavity, as the foramen is divided mtotwoby thespiral lamina of the cochlea, which exSnds downwards as far as this point but for this membrane The circumference of the tympanum may be examined superiorly, mfenorly, anteriorly, and posteriorly. Su- periorly it presents a sulcus or recess, corresponding to a projection on the upper surface of the petrous portln of he temporal bone, and in it is placed ihe head of the ma eus; inferiorly it is contracted to a narrow groove or turrow, and communicates indirectly with the Glal- senan fissure; anteriorly it is perforated by two canals ii^inTateTf '^^^'^^ ^^'^^ eac'h oTher by thin plate of bone (processus cochleariformis), the con- vex surface of which is turned downwards, fuming the upperwalloftheosseous portion of the Euskchian tube the concave upwards, the floor of a more constriPfpH canal, which lodges the tensor tympanTmuscle posS norly it is marked by one or tio irre-ular foraS communicating with the mastoid cells, and to Z Zer- na side of these is the pyramid, a conical projection of variable size, in the apex of which a hole appir fr'om which emerges a small, cord-like process, appa^en W on> posed of fibrous tissue, but which has hifferto been re. cognised as muscular, under the name of the stapedius The tympanum, with the boundaries just described may be strictly considered as morplv tl.o . \ , ' tation of the Eustachiaftubr It^s L^ed b?'^i,-'" mucous membrane, prolonged^rom t^ie'tte^^i^t:t

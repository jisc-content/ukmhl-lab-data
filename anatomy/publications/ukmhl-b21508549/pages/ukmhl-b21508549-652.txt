The fifth lobule is the pneumo- gastric or subpeduncular flocculus, connected to the crura cerebelli by two stalk-like processes, and lying behind the eighth, and below the seventh nerve. In con- nexion with the cerebellum, the isthmus encephali, or nodus cerebri, ought to be examined: it is a narrow medullary mass which, occupying the space between the cerebrum, cerebellum, and the medulla oblongata, should be regarded as a compound body, being made up of the following parts:— Pons Varolii.—inferiorly, tubercula quadrigemina above, crura cerebri in front, with the medulla oblon- gata and the superior crura cerebelli above. Cerebellar Peduncles.—These are three on each side, superior, middle, and inferior; the superior thick, round, white cords (processus a cerebello ad testes), which pass downwards and backwards, diverging from the testes to the central white portion of the cerebellum; internally they correspond to the fourth ventricle and the valve of Vieussens; externally and inferiorly, to the middle crura; and superiorly they are overlapped by the cerebellum, and afford origin to the fourth nerve. Mid- dle crura cerebelli pass from the cerebellum to the side of the pons, which they enter, forming its transverse fibres, and are related behind to the seventh, and in front to the fifth pair of nerves, and inferiorly to the subpe- duncular flocculus or pneumogastric lobule. Inferior crura are constituted by the restiform bodies, which diverge to reach the inferior part of the incisura an- Internal Structure of the Cerebellum.—A longitu- dinal section on either side of the middle line displays the arbor vitse of the lateral lobes, and a similar section in the mesian line, that of the middle lobe, the former consisting of a central white nucleus, which gives off from its circumference from fifteen to twenty branches, and these, again subdividing, are covered at their extre- mities by a yellow layer, on which, lastly, is moulded the grey substance, which is about a line m thickness. In the centre of each white nucleus a mass of grey mat- ter (corpus rhomboideum) occurs, of an ovoid figure, possessing also a yellowish investing surface layer; this

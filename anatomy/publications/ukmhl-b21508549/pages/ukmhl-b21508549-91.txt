81 THE FRONTAL BONE. supraciliary arches; the apex, posteriorly and internally, concave and smooth, forming the upper Avail of the or- bit, looking downwards and forwards, presenting a deep depression, externally and anteriorly, for the lachrymal giand—a small spicula of bone, sometimes merely a de- pression for the pulley of the superior oblique, situated near its internal and anterior part. The orbital pro- cesses are extremely thin, and are separated from each other by an oblong interval, completed in its natural condition by the cribriform plate of the ethmoid, hence called the ethmoidal notch; the sides of this notch are cellular anteriorly, where they communicate with the frontal sinuses; rough posteriorly, where they often present slight rounded depressions, which are converted into foramina by their junction with the ossa plana of the ethmoid,—the anterior and posterior orbital fora- mina; the former transmitting the anterior ethmoidal artery and nasal twig of the ophthalmic; the latter, the posterior ethmoidal artery only. The posterior margin of the orbital plate is bevilled oif on its upper surface internally, to support the lesser wing of the sphenoid; on its under surface externally, to rest upon its greater wing. The remainder of its circumference is thick and serrated, and articulates for its whole extent with the parietal bones, but in such a manner that while it over- laps them superiorly, it is in turn overlapped by them inferiorly, constituting what is termed the coronal su- ture. If we now proceed to examine the internal surface of the bone, we will find it to be deeply concave and uneven, owing to the depressions and elevations already alluded to. At its most anterior part, and in the mesia'i line, we observe a hole, sometimes only part of one, and completed by the ethmoid; this is the foramen CEecum, foriliing a communication between the nose and the great longitudinal sinus. Passing backwards from this point is a ridge which, after proceeding for a short dis- tance, bifurcates into two, leaving a groove between them, and affording attachment to the falx cerebri, on each side of which are occasionally depressions for the glandulse Pacchioni. The upper parts of the orbital plates are exceedingly convex and irregular, and form

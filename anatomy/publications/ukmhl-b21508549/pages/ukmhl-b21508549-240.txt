230 THE MUSCULAR SYSTEM. idea to be more ingenious than correct; the orifices of the Meibomian follicles are also seen a little nearer the posterior margin than the anterior, and into the latter the cilias or eyelashes are implanted; of the two cornua the internal is most acute; it is fixed by a slip of the tendo oculi; the external is firmly attached to the cor- responding canthus by the external tendo oculi; the inferior tarsal cartilage is not more than two lines in depth, whilst the superior is in its deepest portion fully half-an-inch; sometimes it consists merely of the thick ciliary edge and no more; the superior is also a quarter of an inch wider than the inferior; but, with the excep- tion of the levator palpebra, their relations are similar. Palpebral Ligaments.â€”At the margin of the orbit the periosteum of that cavity becomes continuous with a similar structure from the external surface of the frontal bone, and also that of the malar and maxillary, passing upwards and downwards, to be attached to the orbital margins of the tarsal cartilages; it retains them loosely in their situations; at the internal canthus they are weak and thin where they become continuous with the tendon; externally they decussate, forming a thick round cord superficially; this may be termed the exter- nal tendo oculi; it is bifid internally, where it is attached to the cartilages, round externally, and firmly connected to the malar bone; the deep portion is here very broad, and appears to compensate for the excavation in the or- bital edge of that bone. The internal tendo oculi, about a quarter of an inch in length, consists of a superficial and deep portion; the former is thick and round inter- nally, where it is attached to the nasal process of the superior maxillary bone in front of the groove for the lachrymal sac; externally it becomes twisted and flat- tened, and divides into two well-marked slips, which are attached to either tarsal cartilage, covering the lachrymal cunals; the deep portion of this tendon is un- defined, thin but strong, adhering intimately to the edges of the groove for the sac, which it appears to protect from atmospheric pressure. The Eyelashes, or ciliaj, are strong, stiff hairs, forming a double, and sometimes treble, row in the anterior margin of each lid; those in the superior being more

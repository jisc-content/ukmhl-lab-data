487 MUSCLES OF THE FOOT, separates it, flexor digitorum longus, and the external plantar artery and nerve. Action—To flex the toes. Abductor Minimi Digiti Lies on the external side of the foot, and arises from the external tubercle on the OS calcis, fascia, and intermuscular septum; also from the external thickened margin of the plantar fascia, as far forward as the metatarsal bone; it passes forwards, and is inserted into the base of the first pha- lanx of the little toe. Relations.—Inferiorly it lies on the plantar fascia, superiorly it corresponds to the musculus accessorius, flexor brevis minimi digiti, and bones of the little toe. Action—As its name implies. In the second layer are found the tendons of the flexor digitorum and poUicis, musculus accessorius, and lumbricales. The Flexor Pollicis Tendon is seen coursing for- wards and inwards, and the common flexor crossing be- neath it at an acute angle, both so connected that the obliquity of action produced by their direction may be modified. Musculus Accessorius.—A fleshy sheet; arises from the inferior and internal part of the os calcis, passes obliquely downwards, forwards, and inwards, to be in- serted, thin, aponeurotic, and fleshy, into the outer side of the long flexor tendons. Relations.—It is covered by the flexor digitorum brevis, abductor minimi digiti, and the external plantar artery and nerve, and it lies on the os calcis and caL- caneo-cuboid ligament. Action.—To counteract the obliquity of the long flexor muscle. Lumbricales.—Four small muscles, which arise from the internal sides of the long flexor tendons, pass for- Avards, and are inserted by small but flat bands into the extensor tendons on the back of the first phalanx; also into the side of the latter. Relations.—They lie beneath the third layer, and are concealed superficially by the short flexor tendons; the tendons, at first round, pass in the intervals between the heads of the metatarsal bones, above the brido-ed

DURA MATER. are considered of importance, a transverse cut from ear to ear, the flaps being turned forwards and backwards, appear to be most suitable. Having removed the scalp] the bone may now be fractured in a circular direction with the claws of a hammer; but this course is attended with very great disadvantage in consequence of the ir- regular spicule resulting from the fracture being con- stantly liable to puncture the hands of the operator in the future examination of the membrane. We would therefore advise the use of the saw on all occasions: al- though a little more tedious, the subsequent safety amply compensating for the additional trouble. The bones should be sawed in a circular direction, half-an- inch above the superciliary arches in front, the same distance above the occipital protuberances behind, and laterally on a level with the superior edge of the carti- lage of the ear. Having sawn to a sufficient depth, a chisel may now be introduced into the groove ante- riorly, lorcmg off the calvarium from before backwards the attempt being attended with much facility in the adult, but with no small amount of difficulty in the in- fant and old age; in the former the intimate adhesion depending on the free vascular communication between the pericranium and dura mater, and in the latter on the ossification of the external layers of that membrane. Ihe student should observe the different thickness of the calvarium at its margins; laterally being thin and brittle where the parietal and squamous plates of the temporal bones enter into its formation; thick and dense m its occipital portion, with a similar depth ante- riorly, resulting from the separation of the tables to lorni the frontal sinuses. The dura mater, now exposed, belongs to the class of fibrous tissues, and is strong, dense, and of a bluish white colour, the structure being distinctly fibrous in all situations. It covers and adheres to the whole in- ternal surface of the bones, presenting two surfaces â€” one external, rough and fibrous; the other internal smooth, polished, and glistening; a character which re- sults from the parietal layer of arachnoid which adheres to It. In many situations this membrane can be divided into two layers, the external being adherent to the bone in all parts, and therefore acting as a periosteum- the

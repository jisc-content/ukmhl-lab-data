INGUINAL HERNIA. 379 cremaster, the fifth; the transversalis abdominis the sixth; and the fascia transversalis and subperitoneal tis- sue, with the peritoneum, the seventh stratum of tissues superimposed on this region. When the integument and fascise have been removed, the external ring becomes apparent; this is easily appreciable even in the living sub- ject, immediately above the crest of theptibis, and a little external to it. In consequence of the peculiar arrange- ment of the external spoutlike fascia, this affords a tem- porary obstacle to the escape of a hernial protrusion, but the continued pressure gradually expands its pillars, the thin portion of the external being forced outwards, and the internal gradually yielding in the upward di- rection, and becoming thin and expanded, the edges are prolonged on the tumour for some distance, the ring then representing a funnel, with the base towards the cavity of the abdomen. When the external oblique ten- don is thrown down cautiously, a space is observed in which the spermatic cord or round ligament is lodged, extending outwards to the point where these emerge from the cavity; this is the inguinal canal, of a prisma- tic form, the base corresponding to the abdominal edge of Poupart's ligament, its direction being obliquely downwards and inwards, extending between the rings. It is bounded anteriorly by the tendon of the external oblique in its whole length; in the outer half, the in- ternal oblique, and in the external third, the transversa- lis abdominis, so that in the internal third the tumour is most superficial, being covered only by the superficial layers and oblique aponeurosis; but in the direction of the internal ring, the inferior fleshy margins of the in- ternal oblique and transversalis, overlapping the canal, augment the coverings of a hernia in this division of It. It is bounded posteriorly by the conjoined tendons and Colles's ligament, fascia transversalis, and internal epigastric artery; below by Poupart's ligament; and above by the apposition of its opposite walls. This canal measures between the distal margins of the rings an ave- rage of three inches, and between the proximal two; these measurements having been deduced as the mean from seventy-two cases examined. In the foetus the rmgs are nearly antero-posterior, in consequence of the

357 MUSCLES OF THE HAND. outer edge of the metacarpal bone of the index finger; the fibres pass upwards from the latter, and upwards and outwards from the former, to be inserted tendinous into the outer side of the base of the first phalanx of the second finger. Relations—It has anterior to it the adductor and flexor pollicis brevis muscles, and the termination of the radial artery. The posterior surface is covered by integuments and extensor secundi internodii pollicis; its two origins are separated by the radial artery and veins. Action.—To abduct the index finger and to adduct the thumb; this muscle is also considered to be the first dorsal interosseous. The muscles of the hypo-thenar region are three in number, namely, the abductor minimi digiti, flexor brevis, and adductor minimi digiti. Abductor Minimi Digiti arises tendinous from the pisiform bone, annular ligament, and the insertion of the ulnar flexor tendon; it passes downwards, and is inserted by a short tendon into the base of the first phalanx. Relations.—It is superficial, and lies on the flexor brevis, a portion of which is seen at its outer edge. Action.—As its name implies; but as it moves the little finger towards the middle line; it would be more properly named an adductor. Flexor Minimi Digiti Brevis Sometimes want- ing; lies to the outer edge of the last; arises tendinous from the unciform bone and annular ligament; it passes downwards, and is inserted by a flat tendon into the base of the first phalanx. Relations—It is overlapped by the preceding muscle, and lies on the adductor; the ulnar artery and nerve separate its origin from the abductor. Action.—To flex, with but slight power. Adductor or Opponens arises from the hamulus of the unciform bone and annular ligament; the fibres pass inwards and forwards, and are inserted into the whole length of the metacarpal bone of the fifth finger. Relations.—It is covered by the two former muscles.

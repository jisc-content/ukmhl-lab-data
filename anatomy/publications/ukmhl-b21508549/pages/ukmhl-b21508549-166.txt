156 THE ANATOMY OF THE JOINTS. a saw vertically downwards, so as to divide the foramen ovale laterally, about its centre; this should be con- tinued downwards to about the fourth cervical vertebra, and by cutting across the spinal column at this point we will have the internal part of the canal and the edge of the foramen magnum exposed; by now dissecting off the dura mater, the ligament will be brought into view; it is exceedingly strong, and may be said to consist of three distinct parts,—a median and two lateral; of these the median is dense, taking its origin from the edge of the foramen magnum, and, passing downwards nearly vertically, crosses the transverse ligament, into which a great part of its deep fibres are inserted, while the more superficial continue their course, to be implanted into the back part of the axis, where they become blended with the posterior common ligament of the epine. The lateral arise more externally from the margin of the occipital hole, where they are extremely broad; they descend, inclining slightly inwards, gra- dually becoming narrower, to be attached to the back part of the axis, where they join the middle fasciculus; the relations of this ligament are behind the dura ma- ter, and in front the odontoid process, transverse, and check ligaments. Check or Moderator Ligaments.—These are ex- posed by dissecting off the last described; they are two rounded ligamentous cords, about three-quarters of an inch in length, arising from a slight furrow on the up- per part of the odontoid process, and passmg nearly transversely outwards, to be inserted into a small de- pression on the inside of the condyloid process. Those ligaments are strong, and their use is to limit over- rotation of the atlas, and, of course, the head which is attached to it on the axis; this can be clearly shown on the dissected preparation, where we are enabled to turn the head to a certain extent, and no further, the liga- ments in this condition being found twisted around the odontoid process, the insertion of one of them being directed partially backwards, of the other partially for- wards. With respect to their relative anatomy we will find the anterior occipito-atlantoid ligament Hes m front

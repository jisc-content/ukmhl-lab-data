426 THE MUSCULAR SYSTEM. project backwards on each side of the vesical cervix, covering this part of the bladder more on each side than above or below; on the under surface there is not any separation, but merely a furrow between them. The middle lobe is exposed by turning the bladder on its forepart, and throwing forwards the vesiculse semi- nales and vasa deferentia; it lies between the ducts of the latter and the floor of the iirethra; its usual appearance is that of a flat band, uniting the lateral lobes posteriorly, the nipple-shaped projection of Home being a fallacy. Therelations of the middle lobe are,â€”below, the ductus communis ejaculatorius, prolonged muscular fibres from the bladder, and the junction of the lateral lobes; above, the mucous membrane and uvula, and on each side, the lateral lobes. Now let the gland be laid open above, to examine its surface: the mucous membrane is pale and loose in the middle line, but closely attached to the other parts of the surface. The Canal is small behind, somewhat expanded in the centre, and contracted again in front, also slightly concave upwards, the inferior part being called the sinus; on either sides of the middle line from ten to sixteen openings are observed, of suflicient size to admit the introduction of a bristle, and with a low mag- nifying power, innumerable smaller orifices are visible; through the former the mucous membrane is continued down into an equal number of pouches or crypts, the latter being simple involutions of that membrane, not passing, like the first, into the proper structure of the gland, but terminating in the submucous tissue. The Verumontanum commences by a slight elevation of the lining membrane at the membranous portion, passes backwards, the fold then separating incloses the seminal papilla; again uniting posteriorly, then di- viding into two frseaula, bounding the floor of the cervix at its vesicular extremity on each side of the luette; the fossete formed by the separation of the veru- montanum is called sinus pocularis, and the projecting papilla, the seminal caruncle, which resembles in its appearance one of the papilla? circumvallat^ m the tongue; on this point occurs the opening of the ductus communis ejaculatorius.

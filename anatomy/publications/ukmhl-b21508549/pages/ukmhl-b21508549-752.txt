NERVOUS SYSTEM, 742 supporting the muscles which surround the globe, and presenting six perforations, by which they enter to reach the sclerotic, namely,—four for the recti, and two for the oblique muscles; but from the margins of the apertures a tubule is sent back on each, forming a complete sheath for the recti and inferior oblique, whilst on the supe- rior oblique it passes only as far as the trochlea; it is likewise perforated by the optic and ciliary nerves, as well as the ciliary vessels. If a tenaculum is introduced into its surface, layer after layer may be raised, which are united to each other by fine areolar tissue, and when divided longitudinally its thickness will be observed to vary, being much stronger before, but more loosely con- nected to the contained eyeball in this situation. On drawing the divided margins asunder the internal per- forations for the muscles are seen, each tendon being surrounded by a fine glistening membrane, difFermg altogether from the structure of the vaginal tunic, whilst small thread-like filaments pass from the internal aspect of the capsule to the sclerotic, the surface ot the latter being smooth, polished, and shining like to a se- rous tunic. Although probably premature, we may here state our opinion, that we believe the tunica vaginalis to consist of two layers, namely,—tunica fibrosa and serosa, the latter being a distinct serous sac resembling the arachnoid membrane, of which there are anatomical and physiological proofs, but which we reserve for the present. , This membrane prevents the pressure ot the sur- rounding muscles on the eye, likewise keeping the globe in contact with the lids; it also, according to Dr. U l-er- rall, alters the action of the recti by preventing their retracting the eye within the orbit, and making them act as if they arose from points of the orbit opposite their insertions; but the capsule, with its smooth and polished surface, in fact allows the globe to perform its short rotatory movement with greater ease and rapidity than if the organ moved on the fat at the back of the ''''External Rectus or Abductor lies on the outer wall of the orbit, and arises tendinous from the ligament of Zinn and the ridge separating the optic foramen from

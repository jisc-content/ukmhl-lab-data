401 PERINEUM. of the perineum and tlie median tendinous raphe which separates the two muscles; the fibres pass upwards, for- wards, and outwards; the most posterior, short, are inserted into the perineal face of the triangular ligament, often extending to the bone; the middle bend upwards above the urethra and below the crura, to be attached to a shining aponeurotic band in that situation ; while the anterior and internal fibres are the longest, and are directed upwards, forwards, and outwards, and are in- serted into the surface of the fibrous tube of the corpus cavernosum penis. Relations.—It lies on the corpus spongiosum and bulb of the urethra, from which it is separated by a tubule of the triangular ligament; also on the triangular ligament and crus penis, and it is covered posteriorly by a slip of the transversus perinei, and more externally by the erector penis; externally it corresponds to the erector, long perineal artery and nerve, and the entire of the cutaneous surface is invested by a strong funnel of the perineal fascia. Where this muscle is attached to the crus it bends over its surface to the dorsum of the penis, which is considered by many anatomists to represent the muscles of Houston, described in the Dublin Hospital Reports: these will be referred to in the anatomy of the Penis. Action.—To compress the urethra, and sustain a gra- dual pressure on that canal during its distention by the column of urine; also to expel the last drops of urine that remain in the bulb, together with the seminal fluid, which IS accomplished by momentary, but energetic contractions, producing their expulsion by jerks rather than by sustained efforts. This muscle, from the pecu- liar manner in which it is inserted above the urethra, may be engaged in spasmodic stricture; and perhaps is more frequently the seat of this disease than Wilson's muscles. They can often be felt like a cylinder of wood beneath the skin when an instrument is being in- troduced into an irritable urethra. Between the muscles just described a triangular space exists, with its base behind, at the transversalis perinei • the apex in front, bounded externally by the erector and crus penis, and internally by the accelerator urins

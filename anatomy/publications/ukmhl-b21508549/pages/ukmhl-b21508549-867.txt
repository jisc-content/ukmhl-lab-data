BRANCHES OF FEMORAL. 857 outwards before they are brought in close proximity to it. As Scarpa's space or angle, and Hunter's canal, are invested with great importance,—the former from its practical utility in a surgical point of view, and the lat- ter from the historical associations connected with it, we consider it necessary to give in detail the several boundaries of each. When the integuments and in- vesting fascia have been removed from the upper part of the thigh, the region described by Scarpa will be ex- posed : it represents in figure a scalene triangle, its exter- nal and longest leg formed by the sartorius; its internal by the adductor longus; its base by Poupart'sligament; and Its fioor by the edge of the rectus, psoas and iliacus, ipectmeus and adductor brevis ; the three important 'parts which it contains are,—the anterior crural nerve most externally, the femoral artery in the middle, and ;its vem most internally; and, in addition, but of minor :note, the superficial epigastric, circuniliex ilii, pudic, ;profunda, and internal and external circumflex, two superior perforating arteries, with the accompanyin^r vems of those vessels. Hunter's canal forms a prism"^ but broader above than below; it occupies the middle tthird of the thigh, and is bounded externally by the vvastus internus; internally, by the adductors longus aandmagnus; posteriorly, by the conjoined tendons of ithese muscles at their insertion into the linea aspera; and anteriorly, by a strong aponeurosis, on which the ssartorius rests; here the artery occupies a middle posi- ;.-.ion between the internal saphenous nerve, which lies at first external to it, then anterior, and ultimately in- ■■zerna.]; while the femoral vein is at first posterior and internal, then directly behind it, and ultimately pos- terior and slightly external; it also contains the anas- ;omotica magna artery. Anomalies—The femoral artery is generally very re- ■{ular in its course; but some few cases are on record vhere it has been double, and also where the two tranches, after continuing separate for some distance .gam united, forming a single trunk.

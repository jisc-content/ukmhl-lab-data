262 THE MUSCULAR SYSTEM. them; lower down, but deeper, on removing the pos- terior layer of the sheath, the inferior thyroid artery, inferior cervical ganglion of the sympathetic, with the trunk of the nerve, are seen; behind these the vertebral artery; and in the groove between the trachea and oeso- phagus the laryngeal recurrent nerve is observed ascend- ing, lastly the lateral lobe of the thyroid body, lying on the trachea; in addition to these the thoracic duct on the left side. Posterior Inferior Triangle is bounded below by the clavicle which forms its base, above by the pos- terior belly of the omo-hyoid, and in front by the poste- rior edge of the sterno-mastoid; it contains a quantity of lax areolar tissue and lymphatic glands, the external jugular vein, the transversalis humeri and colli veins, and from below and before, upwards and backwards, the subclavian vein; behind this the artery of the same name, supported by the first rib; and, still more poste- riorly, the formation of the brachial plexus; the transver- salis colli artery crosses the apex, and parallel to the base runs the transversalis humeri, connected to the posterior edge of the clavicle by a strong fascia. The Anterior Superior Triangle may be considered as consisting of two regions: the proper triangle being below the posterior belly of the digastric muscle, whilst above that muscle and below the ramus of the jaw, the digastric space is situated. The Superior or Middle Trlw^gle is bounded behind by the sterno-mastoid, above by the posterior belly of the digastric, and below by the anterior belly of the omo-hyoid; the apex corresponds to the cornu of the OS hyoides, the base to the sterno-mastoid. Immediately beneath the fascia a number of veins are seen, forming a plexiform and intricate interlacement; the facial, ex- ternal, and anterior jugulars contributing to its forma- tion ; on removing these the descendens noni nerve is seen on the external and anterior part of the sheath, and by further dissection the common carotid artery, in its superficial stage; also its division into external and internal or deep carotids, internal jugular, and its subsidiary veins,â€”the pneumogastric and branches of sympathetic and lingual nerves, the latter running

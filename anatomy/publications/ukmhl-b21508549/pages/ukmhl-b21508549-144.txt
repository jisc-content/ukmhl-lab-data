THE OSSEOUS SYSTEM. 134 ■whilst below and in the sinuses we find it changing to the columnar variety, and ciliated. This epithelium is exceedingly minute in the cells, while above and be- hind it is scarcely visible, not well defined, but folded over each other and presenting a darker hue from the pigment which is here very freely deposited. In the an- terior part likewise, we observe it studded with hairs, termed vibrisste—in the young, being fine and short, but increasing in length and thickness with advancing years. The mucous membrane exercises a peculiar in- fluence over the appearance of the several cavities of the nose, rounding olFits prominent edges, partially closing, and in some instances modifying, and in others oblite- rating, the several foramina and sinuses. In tracing it round its circumference we might commence at any point, for instance the septum, down which it is conti- nued as far as the floor, as it sweeps along which it covers in the anterior palatine hole; a little farther back it meets with the inferior orifice of the nasal duct, around the edges of which it forms a loose fold, from which it is continued upwards through the canal to the lachrymal sac, its ducts, and then through the puncta to become continuous with the conjunctiva. More poste- riorly it meets with the Eustachian tube and after forming another fold round its lips, it is prolonged within it as far as the tympanum, which it lines as well as the mastoid cells. Ascending now along the outer wall of the inferior meatus to its summit, it is again re- flected downwards-on the concave or outer surface of the inferior turbinated bone to its lower edge, where it forms a pendulous fold before it again ascends on its convex or inner surface. Arriving now at the middle meatus, it passes up through the infundibulum into the frontal sinuses, which it lines, sends prolongations into the anterior ethmoidal cells, and folds around the orifice of the foramen antri, which it afterwards enters to spread out on the walls of that cavity, where it is re- markable for its tenuity. Having lined the middle meatus on both walls, we again find it forming its fold on the free edge of the middle turbinated bone and then winds up on its convex surface into the superior meatus; here it is tensely stretched across the spheno-

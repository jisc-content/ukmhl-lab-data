788 ARTERIES AND VEINS. hyoides separating tliem at their origins, and it termi- j nates at the under surface of the tip of the tongue, it has been divided into three stages,—the first, transverse, from its origin till it passes beneath the hyoidean at- tachment of the hyo-glossus; the second, vertical, while it lies beneath that muscle; and the third, also trans- verse, as it runs along the under surface of the tongue, where it communicates with its fellow only. Relations-First ^to5re._Anteriorly, integument, pla- tysma, superficial fascia, posterior fibres of hyo-glos- sus, and thyroid branch of lingual nerve; anteriorly and superiorly, tendon of digastric, stylo-hyoid mus- cle, and lingual nerve, which runs parallel to it, but separated from it by the posterior fibres of the hyo-glos- sus; inferiorly, cornu of os hyoides; and posteriorly, superior laryngeal nerve, some loose areolar tissue, and a few fibres of origin of the middle constrictor. Second or Vertical ^to^/e—Anteriorly, integuments, platysma, fascia, anterior belly of digastric, mylo-hyoid, hyo-glossus, and lingual nerve, which here crosses it to become internal to it; posteriorly, middle constrictor; and, at its termination, mucous membrane ot moutli. Third Stage, or i^a/zme.—Superiorly, muscular tis- sue of tongue ; inferiorly, mucous membrane ranine veins, and branches of gustatory nerve; into;nally, genio-hyo-glossus ; and externally, prolonged lingual fibres of the hyo-glossus. , Collateral BRANCHES—Hyoid, dorsalis hngu^, and '""nS-Very small; arises immediately after the origin of the lingual, passes forwards ^j^P^^fi^^^^^y on die upper edge%f the cornu of the ^^^f/^' anastomose with a similar branch of the opposite side, and with the hyoidean of the thyroid. DoRSALis lJngii^ arises from ^^^S^^^™ that artery lies under the posterior fibres of the hyo gtsus beneath which, and\n f-t of the a^vterior pil- others to the same region from the mternal maxillary.

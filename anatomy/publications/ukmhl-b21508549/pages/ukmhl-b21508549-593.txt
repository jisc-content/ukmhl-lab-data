583 KIDNEYS. kidney made in the manner just described, two struc- tures, very different in their outline and general ap- pearance, are brought into view,—the one lying external, of a reddish colour, the cortical; the other disposed in triangular masses of a pale, livid hue,—the medullary. Those latter vary from six to twelve in number, and were first described by Malpighi, and have since been known as the pyramids of that anatomist. The bases of the entire of them are turned outwards towards the cortical substance, while thin processes of the latter structure are sent down between them, isolating them from each other, while they terminate inferiorly in a blunted extremity, termed a mammilla or papilla, each lobule thus constituting a separate kidney in fcetal ex- istence, an arrangement which is persistent in a great majority of the lower classes of animals during their entire period of existence. Bellini and Belingheri were the anatomists who first distinctly pointed out that those pyramidal masses were composed of a series of urini- ferous tubules, and hence they are generally known by the name of the latter (tubes of Bellini); but it was reserved for Ferrein to give a true theory with respect to their ultimate disposition. According to him, each single tubule of Bellini consists of an aggregate of smaller ducts, amounting in the majority ot^instances to one hundred, in consequence of their dividing in di- chotoraous order as they advance from the apex to the base of the Malpighian pyramid, while they are bound together by a thin fibrous sheath. On reachino- the cortical structure, he described them as passino- into it and becoming twisted and convoluted like the tendrils ot a vine, and at last terminating in flask-like extremi- ties, or by forming a loop with an adjacent one. If we now direct our attention to the cortical substance, we will observe that it invests the whole kidney to a depth varying from a quarter to half an inch, sending, as has been already observed, processes inwards between the several tubular cones. In structure it is composed of the ramifications of the renal artery, vein, and convo- luted tubes already alluded to; and in order properly to understand its arrangement, a few brief remarks must be made on the distribution of those vessels.

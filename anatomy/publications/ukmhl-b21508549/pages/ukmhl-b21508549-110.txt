100 THE OSSEOUS SYSTEM. commences behind, at a small notch, triangular in shape, for the reception of the ethmoidal spine of the sphe- noid, continues depressed for some distance, then rises obliquely upwards and forwards to variable heights, and ultimately descends, nearly perpendicular, to ter- minate in two small oval wings, which, diverging ante- riorly, unite with similar processes of the frontal to form the foramen caecum, the orifice of communication between the nose and superior longitudinal sinus. The crista galli is not always vertical, but may incline either to the right or left; it is smooth and rounded, and af- fords attachment to the falx cerebri. The margins of the superior surface articulate anteriorly and laterally with the frontal, and behind with the body and lesser wings of the sphenoid. If we now direct our attention to the sides of the bone, we will find them to be ex- tremely smooth, and hence their name, ossaplana; they are also quadrilateral in shape, long from before back- wards, their external surface corresponding to the in- ner wall of the orbit, their internal to the outer of the nose; their anterior margin, short, articulates with the OS unguis, their posterior with the sphenoid and palate bones, their inferior with the superior maxillary and inferior spongy, and their superior with the frontal; this last suture is pierced by two foramina, the ante- rior and posterior ethmoidal; the first transmitting the anterior ethmoidal artery and nasal twig of the ophthal- mic, the second a small artery only. The anterior ex- tremity of the bone is very irregular in its appearance, displaying several apertures which open into cells; these are completed when in situ by the os unguis ex- ternally, and the nasal processes of the superior maxil- lary in front. The posterior extremity, m its general character, is very analogous to the preceding; in it we find the openings into the posterior ethmoidal cells, completed above by the body of the sphenoid, and be- low by the palate, on this we likewise observe the ex- tremities of the superior and inferior turbinated bones, with a groove, the superior meatus, dividing theni. The inferior surface is the most irregular of any of those we have hitherto described: in the mesial line is placed a thin plate, seldom perfectly vertical, the nasal lamella,

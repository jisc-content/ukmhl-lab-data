745 THE ETE. oblique muscles may also press the globe against thp inner wall of the orbit, altering the optical ^a -dlax, and hkewise advance the eyeball. With Reference, however to the advance and retraction of the globe, it appears that these motions are extremely limited, as the oblique and recti exactly antagonize each other. ^ THE GLOBE OF THE EYE. The globe of the eye is situated in the anterior part of the orbit, hxed m its situation by the optic nerve and the muscles which surround it, and retained in con- tact with the hds by the ocular fascia and the conjunc- tiva which last covers and adheres to about the anterior hird of the _ eyeball. It is of a spheroidal figure and to Its front 13 attached a segment of a smallfr sphere increasing the antero-posterior diameter to eleven lines' whilst the vertical and transverse are only ten t S dmded into membranes and humours, the former beinl eight in number, viz.,_sclerotic, cornea, choroid, retTna hyaloid, aqueous, capsule of the lens, and iris; knd the humours three, namely,_aqueous, vitreous, and crys! The ScLEEOTic Coat constitutes about four-fifths of d.'.ff'r ""T^'^'^' ""^'^^ belongs to the class of fibrous tissues; commencing posteriorly at the entrance of the optic nerve, which pieVces it int^ernal to the centre by a cribriform aperture, and surround n' the posterior four-fifths of the globe, it terminates ao parently at the margin of the cornea.' It was customar^; to describe the corneal aperture of the sclerotic as beS bevilled on Its inner surface, whilst the cornea, be ng rnfl7v^ off externally, was received into the scle? rotic like a watchglass mto its case; but by recent inve^ tigations It has been proved that a perfect fusion o S structure occurs, the cornea only differing from the spI^ rotic in the altered arrangement of its element^ ^ i tero-posterior section shows the sclerotic to be of diff^' rent thicknesses, being much thicker behind than be' fore, and thinnest a little anterior to the centre and this augmentation at the posterior part is found toT greater m animals, wherethe eye is flattened from before

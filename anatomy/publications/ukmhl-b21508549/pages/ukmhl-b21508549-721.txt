LUMBAR PLEXUS. 711 the sheath, then the fascia of the thigh, supplying the in- teguments on its anterior part as far as its middle third Anterior Crural Nerve—The student having exa- mined the inguino-cutaneous branches, may now direct his attention to this large nerve, which springs princi- pally from the third and fourth, but also receives a branch from the second, its formation taking place within the psoas, and on emerging from that muscle it lies buried between it and the iliacus, and covered by the lascia ihaca, being above fully an inch from the external Iliac artery, from which it is separated by the psoas and tascia, but as it passes under Poupart's ligament it is quite close to that vessel. While within the pelvis it throws off several slender branches to the iliacus but generally only one, but sometimes two, to the psoas. On reaching the upper part of the thigh the nerve be- comes flattened and expanded, and after running about two inches below Poupart's ligament it is pie?ced by the external circumflex of theprofunda; here it divides into twosets of branches,_muscular and musculo-cuta- neous: the former supplying by large and distinct branches the rectus, vastus externus and internus cru- reus and subcrureus, and to these may be added the adductor longus, brevis, and pectineus, which receive a lew filaments from the twig destined for the supply of the femoral vessels. The latter or musculo-cutaneous is divided into two sets of branches,-muscular, that run along the deep surface of the sartorius, which they ulti- mately enter and supply; and cutaneous, three in num- ber,_a superior, middle, and inferior. The first passes ■ downwards beneath the sartorius, and then, perf .ratln. Its upper third and the fascia, divides into wo bran he! : abou the middle of the thigh; these can be traced down on Its front and mner part as far as the pateUa, where 'they terminate in flattened anastomotic arches- this I nerve communicates in its course downwards with the .crural division ot thegenito-crurah The second or mid- dle continues in the sheath of the sartorius, much lower down but It ultimately pierces it a little below the mid- dle ot the thigh, and becomes cutaneous. On reaching- .the mternal condyle it is reflected outwards and slightif ^upwards, over the patella, in the subcutaneous areoW

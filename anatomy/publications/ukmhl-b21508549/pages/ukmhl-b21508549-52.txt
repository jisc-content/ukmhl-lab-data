42 THE OSSEOUS SYSTEM. three margins, the only one that is remarkable is the internal, which is sharp, and extends from about an inch below the tubercle to about two inches above the lower extremity of the bone, where it bifurcates into two ridges, forming the li^s of the articulating facette for the extremity of the ulna. The lower part of the radius is broad and expanded as contrasted with the shaft; an- teriorly it is concave, presenting a very irregular, un- dulating lip, to which the anterior carpal ligament is attached, and over which the flexors of the forearm glide; externally it is prolonged into the styloid process, which is short, thick, and triangular; bounded m front by a groove, through which the tendons of the ex- tensor ossis metacarpi and the primi internodii glide; behind by a broader but shallower one, sometimes divided into two by a slight ridge, for the extensors carpi radialis longior and brevior. The styloid process gives attachment by its point to the external lateral ligament; and by its posterior surface to the pos- terior annular. External to the groove which lodges the radial extensors is another, small but deep; it is directed downwards and outwards, and accommodates the extensor secundi internodii pollicis; internal to this is still a fourth channel, broad but superficial, through which the extensor communis and indicis ghde to their insertion. The internal surface of the bone, as already remarked, is marked by a facette, concave antero-pos- teriorly, and covered with cartilage for the reception ot the head of the ulna; its lower border is sharp and gives attachment to the base of the interarticular fibro- cartilage. The inferior extremity of the radius looks downwards, forwards, and inwards; it is covered with cartilage, and presents two distinct facettes, both con- cave, the external, triangular, to articulate with the scaphoid, the internal, quadrilateral, tojom with the TheTadius is connected with four bones: the hume- rus above, the ulna laterally, and the scaphoid and semi- lunar below. It is developed from three points of ossi- fication: one for the shaft, which is visible about the thirtieth day; one for the lower extremity, apparent

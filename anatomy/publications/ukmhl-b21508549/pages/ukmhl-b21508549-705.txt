BRACHIAL PLEXUS. 695 its middle with external third, and removing the por- tion of bone between this point of section and the acro- mion process, the entire plexus will be exposed as far down as its ultimate division into its branches for the supply of the arm, fore-arm, and hands. The brachial plexus is formed by the anterior branches of the four last cervical nerves and first dorsal, which increase very slightly in size as they descend. They emerge be- tween the anterior and middle scaleni, and present the following arrangement:—The fifth and sixth run down- wards and outwards, at first separately, but, gradually converging, unite at the outer edge of the anterior sca- lenus into a single cord, which, after proceeding for a slight distance, again bifurcates, the inferior division descending to join an ascending branch of the seventh which likewise issues out between the same muscles' : and passes with less obliquity outwards, nearly as far ' ■ as the clavicle, where it also bifurcates, one division : Stretching upwards to unite with the inferior branch of ithe fifth and sixth, and the other downwards to anasto- •mose with the superior of the eighth and first dorsal. Ihese two last-nained nerves have the followint^ di^po- -sition:--The eighth cervical runs outwards, as far as the edge of the scalenus, and here unites with the tfirst dorsal, which sweeps upwards and outwards in (front of the neck of the first rib, and behind the supe- rrior intercostal artery; the compound trunk thus formed by their union soon likewise bifurcates, and Its superior branch, ascending, anastomoses with the .inferior of the seventh, thus constituting the bra- nchial plexus, which lies partly in the posterior in- •fenor and partly m the posterior superior triangle .of the neck, superior and external to the subclavian aartery, bound down and isolated by a process of the ddeep cervical fascia, which is prolonged on it from tthe margin of the anterior scalenus. Continuing now itts course downwards, it passes under the clavicle and SBubclavius muscle, lying upon the first rib and first r-ndigitation of the serratus magnus, crosses the axilla x,ehmd the artery, and ultin.ately rests on the tendon of the subscapular, the two roots of the median nerve em tracing the vessel at this point.

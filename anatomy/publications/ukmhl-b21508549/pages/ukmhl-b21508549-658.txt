648 NERVOUS SYSTEM. month the posterior notch, with the surface fissures, be- come evident, and during the further period of foetal life the lateral lobes increase, so as ultimately to con- ceal the middle. The cerebrum at the end of the eighth week presents the corpora striata, covered by a thin fold of membrane, representing the cerebral hemispheres, but this vesicular enlargement still leaves the optic tha- lami, tubercula quadrigemina, and cerebellum exposed, the corpus callosum not as yet being formed, the whole mass resembling the brain of fishes. At the end of the twelfth week the nascent hemisphere covers also the op- tic thalami, and now the corpus callosum also begins to appear as a narrow band. In the fifth month the hemi- sphere covers the tubercula quadrigemina, and traces of anfractuosities, with the fissures of Sylvius, are observed. In the sixth month they conceal the anterior part of the cerebellum; in the sixth and seventh months the cere- bellum becomes entirely concealed, the posterior cere- bral lobes projecting behind them; during the remain- der of festal life the convolutions become more perfect, and the corpus callosum reaches the tubercula quadri- gemina. The weight of the brain varies with age and sex: in the male its average weight may be stated as about three pounds, whilst in the female it is about two pounds ten ounces, this average being only approximate. DISSECTION OF THE SPINAL CORD. In order to examine this important part the subject must be placed on a table, with blocks beneath the chest and abdomen, so as to render the muscles of the back tense; an incision should then be carried perpendicu- larly downwards on either side, three inches external to the spines, from the occiput to the base of the coccyx: the great erectors of the spine must now be removed, and the posterior half-arches of the vertibrce exposed; these should next be divided either with the saw or, what is still better, with a mallet and chisel, close to the pedicles, and each of them cautiously lifted up; by this means the interior of the canal will be exposed, but the dura mater or first covering of the spmal cord is not as

NERVOUS SYSTEM. 608 figure, the base formed by the periosteal layer of the dura mater, and the sides by the internal laminaj dip- ping inwards to form the falx cerebri; it commences by a small vein which passes upw^ards from the nose through the foramen ctecum, sometimes by a cul desac, and termi- nates in the torcular Herophili, or in the right lateral sinus. Within the cavity the following parts are ob- served :—ChordsaWillisii, openings of the veins, and glan- dnXse Pacchioni. The chordae Willisii are white silvery bands which cross the sinus, being more numerous posteriorly; the venous membrane is reflected around them, sometimes giving them a flattened appearance, their use appearing to be for the purpose of prevent- ing over-distention of the walls of the sinus. The veins opening into the sinus are derived from the internal and superior surface of the cerebral hemisphere. The inter- nal hemispheric veins, from eight to ten in number, run upwards to the falx, and there unite with the superior branches, while the superior, about ten in number, course upwards, the most anterior passing also back- wards,—the largest being the middle cerebral, which commences in the fissure of Sylvius, runs at first upwards and backwards, then curves forwards, and this, with the other superior branches, proceed from ten to twelve lines between the layers of the falx in a forward direc- tion prior to opening into the sinus, which they enter in a direction from behind forwards, or contrary to the current of the blood, a course which is conceived to ob- viate the tendency to regurgitation; the anterior branches, however, constituting an exception to this rule, many entering the sinus directly. Immediately at the open- ings in the sinus an areolar structure may be seen, and where this is absent the venous set of glandule Pac- chioni, being situated exactly at the orifices, are said to act as ball-valves, thus precluding regurgitation from the sinus into the veins. In addition to the cerebral, many branches from the dura mater and osseous diploe pour their contents into the sinus, and in the majority of instances a small vein passes through tlie posterior superior angle of the parietal bone, producingan indirect communication between the cerebral and general venous system.

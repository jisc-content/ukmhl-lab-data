312 THE MUSCULAR SYSTEM. cartilages; the fibres pass backwards, the superior and middle almost horizontally, the inferior, thick and con- verging, ascend obliquely; they are inserted mto the in- ternal surface of the superior and inferior angles of the scapula, and in the intermediate space into a strong fas- cia, stretched between these points, lying anterior to the rhomboid, and behind the subscapular muscles. Structural Peculiarities.—muscle consists ot three distinct portions,—superior, middle, and inferior. The superior is triangular, and has its base attached to the first and second ribs, sometimes to the second only, the apex to the superior angle; the middle por- tion weaker than the first, is square, attached anteriorly to the third, fourth, and fifth ribs, and posteriorly_ to the fascial structure at the base of the scapula. The in- ferior division, the strongest and most fleshy, is trian- gular, attached by the base to the sixth, seventh, eighth and ninth ribs, and by the apex to the inferior angle of the scapula. ^ . j u +t,^ Belations—The external surface is covered by the pectorals, the axillary vessels and nerves, by the sca- pular and subscapular muscle, and a lax, areolar tissue which separates them; also the long thoracic nerve and artery, and inferiorly by the latissimus dorsi, internal to wh ch it lies; the internal surface lies m con act with the ribs, intercostals, and the scapular branch of the pos- '"ic'^^T^o drlw'lbrward the scapula and shoulder; if the inferior portion acts alone, it rotates the bone so as to elevate the glenoid cavity, assisting the trapezius by :reversed action; it may also assist --^P-f The student should now examine the thorax and its con- tents —for which, see Anatomt of that cavity.

21 THE SPINE IN GENEEAL. the axis stands boldly out; the third, fourth, and fifth are more depressed, while those of the sixth and seventh, par- ticularly the last, are very prominent; they are bifid and exceedingly strong, giving attachment to the numerous muscles which move the head and neck. In the dorsal region those processes are differently arranged, bending downwards and backwards—overlapping each other so as to limit in a great measure all attempts at extension, and terminating in points or hooks, turned downwards and backwards. The spines of the lumbar vertebrse stand out at a right angle with the column; they are thick and strong, and separated from each other by a considerable interval, while those of the sacro-coccygeal region gradually diminish in size, till they are ulti- mately lost in a depressed triangular space—the termi- nation of the spinal canal. On either side of the spine appear deep grooves, the vertebral furrows, the floor formed by the lamina, and the interspaces between those processes completed by the yellow ligaments already alluded to. These furrows, filled up by the great ex- tensors of the spine, present in the living subject two well-marked, prominent, fleshy masses, extending on either side of the mesial line, for during life a depression marks the course of the spine, and this depression is deep and obvious according to the muscularity of the individual. The lateral aspect of the spinal column presents for observation the transverse processes, with the several peculiarities characteristic of each region. They are short and bifid in the cervical; thick, strong, and directed backwards, with a facette on their extre- mity, in the dorsal; pointed and comparatively weak in the lumbar. Situated between the roots of the transverse processes are the oblique, forming an irregular, wavy line from above downwards; and still more anteriorly between these and the body, are the intervertebral holes, krge and double in the sacral region, gradually dimi- nishing in size in the lumbar and dorsal, and again ex- panding in the cervical. Through these holes the nerves from the spinal marrow, with the communicating branches between the intra and extraspinal veins, pass, and the size of those several parts which traverse

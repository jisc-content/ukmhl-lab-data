478 THE MUSCULAR SYSTEM. Action.-lt assists the last muscle. In Key's ampu- tation of the foot the insertions of the long and short peronei are both removed; the tibialis anticus and pos- ticus then exerting an uncontrolled action on the stump, turning it permanently inwards. Now remove the integument on the posterior surface of the leg with the superficial fascia, and beneath it the posterior saphenous vein and nerve are seen,_the forn^er commencing at the outer extremity of the tarsal arch of veins, and ascending behind the external malleo- lus and piercing the fascia, opens into the popliteal ve k, opposite th! flexure of the knee-joint ; sometimes [t w nds round the inner side of the thigh, and jom the internal saphena. The posterior ^-V^^^^^''"^^J formed by a branch from the posterior tibial (commu- Srs tibialis) and a smaller one from the peronea (communicans peronsei); these f' f, ^i verging and unite in the upper third of the leg, to form iSsterlr saphena nervef which lies at first deeper than Se vein in a fibrous canal beneath the fascia, then, becoming superficial to that vessel, it descends on the posSr%ar\ of the external malleolus, gives off cal- fXTaBtarif., the latter four.-poplteus, Hexor d>g>to- rum oommunis, flezor poUiois propnus, and tibialis Ptl"TKOC»M,us.-Bicipital above; jndta^^^ twfpforent ridges, aWe and the c„n dyles of the fe4 ben^^^^^^ about the snpenOT.fif*°''''^,3^,„ .f ,i,e leg again belly succeeds, which a '«J^'*''^^^^^^^^^^^ J^U- div/de; these t=™'"4tk ^^^^^^^^^ -M-ly- tTieh^tesTe^dTt: ttTlgSiLtion of the muscle,

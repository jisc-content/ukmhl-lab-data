73 THE MIDDLE CUNEIFORM. OS calcis posteriorly; the fourth and fifth metatarsal bones anteriorly; and the external cuneiform and scaphoid internally. Internal Cuneiform—This bone is of a triangular shape, the base being situated inferiorly, the thin portion superiorly. It presents for examination a pos- terior and anterior extremity, an internal and external surface, and a superior and inferior margin. The pos- terior extremity presents an ovoid facette, wider below than above, concave, and covered with cartilage, to articulate with the scaphoid ; the anterior is likeAvise marked by one similar in shape, longer, and slightly concave from above downwards; convex from side to side, to unite with the metatarsal bone of the great toe; the internal surface is rather quadrilateral,°flat- tened but rough, giving attachment by its margins to ligaments which connect it to the adjacent bones, and towards its anterior and inferior part to the tendon of the tibialis anticus; externally it presents two facettes, separated by a slight ridge, the posterior triangular, for uniting with the middle cuneiform; the anterior, more oval, for the side of the metatarsal bone of the second toe; below these it is rough for the interosseous liga- ments ; superiorly it is sharp, and convex where it enters into the formation of the arch of the foot; inferiorly, broad and expanded, and presents towards its anterior part a tubercle for the attachment of the tibialis pos- ticus; a few fibres of the peron^us longus are likewise inserted into its outer edge. The internal cuneiform articulates with four bones: the scaphoid posteriorly, the first metatarsal bone an- teriorly, and the middle cuneiform and second metatar- sal bone externally. Middle Cuneiform.—This is nearly of the same shape as the last, but it is much smaller, and its base, which is turned upwards, is nearly perfectly quadrila- teral. It presents, like the preceding, a posterior and anterior extremity, an internal and external surface, a base, and an apex. On the posterior extremity we ob- serve a facette, broad above, narrow below, covered with cartilage, for articulation with the scaphoid; on • the anterior, another of the same shape, but slightly £

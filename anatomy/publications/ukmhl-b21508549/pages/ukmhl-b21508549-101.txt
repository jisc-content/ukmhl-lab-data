91 THE TEMPORAL BONE. the former conspicuotis for its size; this corresponds to the superior semicircular canal, a part which -will be more accurately examined in the description of the in- ternal ear; about three-quarters of an inch anterior to this is a small groove directed backwards, terminat- ing in a foramen, the hiatus Fallopii, which leads into tlie aqueduct of the same author; through this is trans- mitted the Vidian nerve, from Meckel's ganglion and Vidian branch of the middle meningeal artery. Slightly external, and anterior to the hiatus, is another small hole for the passage of the nervous petrosus superficialis minor, a branch of the tympanic division of Jacobson, in its course to join the internal pterygoid twig of the fifth, for the formation of the otic ganglion; anterior to these foramina is a slight ridge, corresponding to the upper part of the cochlea, and still more anteriorly, near the point of the bone, a depression on which rests the Casserian ganglion of the portio mollis of the fifth. Its superior internal edge is grooved slightly for the superior petrosal sinus, communicating posteriorly with the great lateral, and anteriorly with the cavernous; immediatel}'- behind its apex, however, there is a slight notch, concave superiorly, and directed upwards where the groove is deficient, and converted into a semilunar foramen by the sinus, which crosses it for the trans- mission of the two portions of the fifth nerve. The in- ternal surface of the bone forms the external boundary of the posterior fossa of the cranium; it is convex and irregular, presenting a large aperture at the junction of its middle with the anterior third, oval in shape, di- rected obliquely backwards and outwards, the internal auditory meatus. As we look into the bottom of this we observe, superiorly and anteriorly, a large foramen; the opening of the aqueduct of Fallopius, into which passes the portio dura nerve; in the inferior part of it several smaller foramina, lamina spiralis foramenulenta, or base of thecochlea, for the branches of the portio mollis to pass into the vestibule. Behind, and a little superior to the meatus, is a slight fissure, likewise directed back- wards; the aqueduct ofthe vestibule, for the transmission of a small vein from that cavity to the superior petrosal sinus; below and behind this is another cleft, but not

THE MUSCULAR SYSTEM. 286 laterally by distension of the cheeks, and the vertical space is constantly suffering change in extent, depending on depression and elevation of the tongue. Mucous membrane can be traced from the free border of the lower lip on its posterior surface; from this to the gum; then over the intervals between the teeth to the posterior surface of the gum; then backwards, forming the floor of the sublingual space to the under svirface of the tongue, producing a fold in the middle line (frse- num linguffi); from this over the apex and edges of this organ tu its base, and by the glosso-epiglottid folds, three in number, on the lingual face and margins of the epiglottis; from the free margin of the upjjer lip to the posterior surface, then backwards on thegum,form- ing a fold in the middle line, the frgenum of the upper lip. Sometimes franulse are also observed opposite the lateral incisors, indicating the original development of the lip from three centres; it then passes between the teeth to the posterior surface of the gum, from which it is prolonged on the lingual surface of the hard and soft palate: the membrane also lines the buccal plane and the outer side of the gums. On the lips the mucous membrane is thin, but very vascular; whilst on the gums the vascularity is diminished, but the thickness is greatly augmented in consequence of a dense fibrous layer that adheres to the periosteum; the membrane is therefore compound, being fibro-mucous. On the buccal surface it is smooth and soft; an elevated fold, corre- sponding to the anterior edge of the internal pterygoid and ramus of the jaw, signifies the posterior limit of the buccal space: on the palate it is likewise of a com- pound structure, hard, dense, and of considerable thick- ness, a linear depression marking the original symme- trical development of the palate. The glands in con- nexion with this tract are follicular. Some are mere simple involutions of the mucous membrane; others are convoluted in the submucous tissue, but yet simple in constitution, and lined in every case by a prolonga- tion of the common membrane. The Epithelial Covering is strong, and forms a continuous layer, formerly considered cuticular, of which it was conceived the continuation. Like the cu-

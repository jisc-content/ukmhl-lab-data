300 THE MUSCULAR SYSTEM. Crico-arytenoideus Posticus.—Oval or diamond- shaped; arises from the depression on each side of the posterior vertical ridge on the cricoid cartilage; the fibres pass obliquely upwards, outwards, and forwards, and are inserted by a tendon into the outer angle of the base of the arytenoid cartilage. Relations.—It lies on the cricoid cartilage and crico- arytenoid articulation; it is covered by the mucous membrane, and separated from its fellow by the median ridge and the longitudinal fibres of the oesophagus, and corresponds externally to the origin of the inferior constrictor and inferior laryngeal nerve. Action.—To draw backwards and outwards the ary- tenoid cartilage, producing tension of the vocal chords, and at the same time dilating the rima glottidis in all directions. Proper Arytenoid Muscles.—These are placed on the superior and posterior surface of the arytenoid car- tilages, immediately beneath the mucous membrane. They consist of two layers: the supei'ficial are flat bands that arise from the base of one cartilage, and then pass to the apex of the opposite; sometimes being like- wise attached behind to the upper edge of the cri- coid ; in connexion with these fibres it may be remarked, that superficial to them a distinct band for each side is not unfrequently seen arising from the upper edge of the cricoid, passing upwards and forwards, and inserted into the cornicula of the same side; this may be found on one side only, and sometimes is continuous with the posterior arytenoid. The transverse arytenoid consist of two sets of fibres, the one superficial, ex- tending between the distal edges of opposite cartilages; the deep set between their proximal edges, from base to apex. Relations.—They are covered by the mucous mem- brane, and lie on the arytenoid cartilages. Action The oblique fasciculi approximate directly the cartilages, if not acting in concert with the crico- arytenoideus lateralis; the transverse also rotate the bases of the arytenoid cartilages; thus tending to sepa- rate, not approximate, the vocal chords.

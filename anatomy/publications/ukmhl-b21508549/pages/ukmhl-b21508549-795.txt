785 CAROTIDS. innominata; the common carotid maybe also altogether absent, the external and internal springing separately from the arch of the aorta (Power). The poiiit of their bifur- cation may be likewise very high, as already stated; we have seen it more than once extending higher than the angle of the jaw before its division took place; but in those examples the superior thyroid always sprung from the common carotid. External Carotid arises from the common, oppo- site the upper edge of the thyroid cartilage, ascends at first upwards and slightly inwards as far as the pos- terior belly of the digastric, then passes upwards, back- wards, and outwards, and terminates in the parotid gland, half-an-inch below the zygoma, a little posterior to the condyle of the lower jaw. Relations.—Antevioi'ly, integument, platysma, form- ing the musculus risorius of Santorini in the parotid region, superficial fascia, lingual nerve, stylo-hyoid and digastric muscles, portio dura, and formative branches ot the external jugular vein; posteriorly, glosso-pharyn- geal nerve, stylo-pharyngeus, and glossus muscles, point of styloid process and stylo-hyoid ligament, and ascend- ing palatine artery, all of which separate it from the in- ternal carotid; the superior laryngeal nerve also lies behmd it; externally, internal carotid, sterno-mastoid, and external auditory meatus; and internally, thyroid, lingual, and facial arteries, the stylo-maxillary artery separating it from the latter, while above the angle of the jaw it is invested on all sides by the parotid gland. Remarks.—From what we have stated with respect to the direction of this artery it will be at once seen that It forms in its course a curve, representing a limited segment of a circle, the concavity of which looks down- wards, backwards, and outwards, and although very superficial at its origin, it becomes more deeply situated as it ascends, being protected by the angle of the jaw, which is in a great measure calculated to defend it from mjury; its average length is three inches. Anomalies.—'YhasQ are rare in the external carotid, but still cases occur wliere it might almost be said to be absent, as in the following instance, which we have i had an opportunity of observing. The common carotid

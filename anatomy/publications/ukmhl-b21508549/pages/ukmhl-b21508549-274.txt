THE MUSCULAR SYSTEM. 264 aponeurosis; sometimes a thin slip arises from the os hy- oides following theinner edge of the anterior belly, one por- tion being inserted into the lower jaw, and a second, which is deeper, into the mylo-hyoid muscle; or the slips of op- posite sides may be united in the mesian line; the pos- terior belly lies on the occipital artery, which separates it from the rectus capitis lateralis muscle, on the sub- occipital nerve, internal jugular vein and spinal ac- cessory, the lingual, pneumogastric and sympathetic nerves, but at some distance from them; it next crosses the internal, external carotids and facial arteries, stylo- hyoid muscle, and at the posterior part of the cornu of the OS hyoides it again crosses the lingual nerve; here it also lies on the lingual artery and hyo-glossus muscle; whilst in the pulley it conceals the insertion of the my- lo-hyoid, and on this muscle the anterior belly lies to its insertion; it is covered by fascia platysma and facial vein, also by a small portion of the parotid, the anterior edge of the sterno-mastoid and facial vein; fibres of the stylo- hyoid must, of necessity, lie superficial to it, with the submaxillary gland; the posterior belly is pierced by the anastomotic filament of the digastric branch of the portio dura, passing to the glosso-pharyngeal; the ante- rior belly is perforated by branches of the submental artery; a case has been observed where this muscle did not pierce the stylo-hyoid. Action.—li the lower jaw be fixed, it will first raise the OS hyoides, and then draw the head backwards; the posterior belly will draw the pharynx upwards and backwards, the anterior upwards and forwards; but it appears to us that the principal action of this muscle is to draw the os hyoides upwards, forwards, and out- wards, thus expanding the pharynx during deglutition. Now dissect off the fascial pulley, and turn up the di- gastric over the ramus of the jaw, so that it be replaced when requisite, and attentively examine the following ^^mlsTRic Space—Semicircular, situated below the iaw; is bounded above by the ramus of the jaw and a line continued from that to the mastoid process; behind, by the posterior belly; and in front by the anterior por- tion of the digastric; below by the tendon of that muscle.

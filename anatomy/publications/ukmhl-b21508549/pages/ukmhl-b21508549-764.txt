fj^^ NERVOUS SYSTEM. serous,—Jacob's membrane; the middle, nervous; and the third or most internal, vascular. On removing the, sclerotic and choroid coats under water from a perfectly fresh human eye the external layer is exposed, or the serous tunic, of which Dr. Jacob gives the following de- scription, he being the first anatomist who directed at- tention to this structure:-" If the exposed surface be now carefully examined, an experienced eye may per- ceive that this is not the appearance usually presented by the retina; instead of the blue, white, reticulated surface of that membrane, a uniform villous structure, more or less tinged by black pigment, presents itself. If the extremity of the ivory handle of a dissecting-kmte be pushed against this surface, a breach is made in it and a membrane of great delicacy may be separated and turned down in folds over the choroid coat, presentmg the most beautiful specimen of a delicate tissue which Te human body affords. If a small opening be made m t e membrane, and the blunt end of a probe introduced beneX it may be separated throughout without being turned down, Remaining loose over the retina. If a few drop of acid be added to the water after the membrane has been separated it becomes opaque and much firmer, and may thus be preserved for several days even with- out beTng immersed in spirit. The extent and con- nexions of this are sufficiently explained by saymg that U Svers the retina from the entrance of the optic nerve to the ciliary processes"-(Todd's Encyclopedia, Article Eve P iser He also remarks, that it is exceeding y deb^ate in the infant, firmer in the adult, and stained bv S pigBient of the choroid; and it presents the same characters in all classes of mammalia, whilst m birds t is ^^rrictyellow colour -d jii ^^^s ^^^^^^^^^^^ Sse brdtsshow a^endency^o separation when im- ^'ertdTn water, and then seem ^-t at their ™ Tliis membrane forms the connecting link '^ct^^een in 'e a and epithelial layer of tlie choroid, and it corre- sponds to the bacillous layer of Wagnei.

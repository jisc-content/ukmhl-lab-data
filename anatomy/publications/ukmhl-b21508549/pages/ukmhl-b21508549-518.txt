The muscular Hbres which form the fourth layer are confined m the trachea to theintervalsbetweentherings;theycommence posteriorly beneath the cricoid cartilage and are con- tinued down to the bronchial tubes, their direction being transverse, and the extremities attaclied to the terminal pomts of the tracheal rings; but we have seen them con- tinued for a short distance on their surfaces as if exhi- biting a tendency to that arrangement, which is normal n thf smaller br'ouchial tubes.

\ 1 758 NERVOUS SYSTEM. spiral tube itself; having arrived at the funnel-shaped apex of the modiolus, it ceases to be attached to it lor a short distance, but ultimately becomes connected to it again near its termination. Hence the lamina spiralis divides the cochlea tube into two distinct canals,—a superior and external, the scala vestibuli, which com- municates directly with that cavity, and an inferior and an internal, the scala tympani, which would open into that chamber through the fenestra rotunda, but for the , membrane, which in the natural condition of the parts 1 completely closes it in. Near the apex of the cochlea the two seals communicate through an opening which we have already described as existing where the spiral lamina ceases to be attached to the modiolus; this aper- ture was described by Breschet under the name of the helicotrema. It will be now necessary to take a briei view of the structure of the lamina spiralis, and in order to understand it properly we must suppose it to be completely folded out, in which state it would be of an obZg fi/ure, divided by a line drawn diagonally from thelpolite angles into two triangles,_the internal, its base mrned inwards, consisting of a thick plate of bone perforated by several canals for the cochlear nerve and terminating by its apex in a curved process (hamulus) , and the external, which is membranous, its base being tSrned outwards and its apex inwards, corresponding to the base of the last. It will, therefore, naturally follow, that when th s plate, composed of those different tissues, is coil J edgeways around'the modiolus, that the osseou structure must prevail in the first turn, must diminish n the second, and cease altogether m the commence- Sent of the third, but the rule must be reversed in th membranous portion, as it forms but a very smau Son indeed of the first coil, an ff^^f^^/'X.'t ?°on 0? ihe second, and the entire of the third or last "ddition to the openings of the two be necessary to mention another, which also commu

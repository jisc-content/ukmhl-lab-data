437 FEMORAL HERNIA. Next proceed to the examination of the iliac fascia in the false pelvis and in the right iliac fossa; tear the cascum from its attachments, also the peritoneum, ob- serving the lax areolar tissue connecting the intestine to the subjacent fascia, sometimes the seat of ileo-csecal abscess; in the left, raise the sigmoid flexure of the colon, which occupies only the superior part of the fossa, and the peritoneum, wrhich invests it. The areolar tissue here is more dense and smaller in quantity, and less subject to abscess; the external iliac vessels are seen covered by a thin fascia, and on their external and an- terior part, the genito-crural nerve, and, running obli- quely towards the anterior spine of the ilium, is the musculo-cutaneous, sometimes double, all these being superficial to the iliac fascia. Sheath of the External Iliac Vessels.â€”This is a condensation of the subperitoneal areolar tissue, some- times described as a process of the iliac fascia, which is evidently incorrect; it covers and adheres to the artery and vein, and sends also a thin septum between them, separating and connecting them to each other. On tracing the fascia downwards on the forepart of the ves- sels to Poupart's ligament, it turns upwards, becoming lax and often divisible into two or more layers, and is lost on the deep surface of the fascia transversalis, between it and the peritoneum, thus closing the posterior aspect of the femoral ring; when this is removed the iliac fascia can be examined; it is attached to the internal lip of the crest of the ilium, to the posterior margin of Poiipart's ligament, from the anterior superior spinous process of the ilium to the outer edge of the external iliac artery, and in this situation it is continuous with the fascia transversalis, a dense white line parallel to Poupart's ligament signifying their junction; this forms one wall of a fibrous canal, in which is found the internal circum- flex ilii artery, accompanied by one or two veins; the fascia then passes beneath the artery and over the psoas, behind which it sends a thin layer, then becomes at- tached to the linea ileo-pectinea, as far inwards as the base of Gimbernaut's ligament; and as it passes on the bone, it sends a layer downwards into the thigh to form the posterior part of the sheath of the vessels; a similar i

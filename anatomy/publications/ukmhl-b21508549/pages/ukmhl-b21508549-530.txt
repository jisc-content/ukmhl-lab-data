520 CAVITY OP THE CHEST. wards, and from the aortic opening by the superior part of the septum, which is thin but strong; occa- sionally a congenital deficiency existing in this situa- tion allowing the pulmonary artery and aorta to com- municate, and becoming a cause of cyanosis; superiorly the infundibulum is terminated by a tendinous annulus, to the upper edge of which the pulmonary artery is attached by three convex roots, composed of the fibrous coat of the vessel, these being implanted into the ten- dinous ring, whilst on the other hand triangular pro- cesses of the latter are prolonged into the spaces between the roots. In addition to this, the lining membrane of the heart is continued into the vessel, forming at its orifice three semilunar or sigmoid valves, which are attached by their convexities to the margins of the roots, the concavities free, looking from the heart, and containing in the centres each a small nodule of fibrous tissue (corpus Arantii vel sesamoideum). To these latter several uses have been assigned, namely, to keep the valve apart from the wall of the vessel, so that during its contraction the blood may insinuate itself with greater ease between it and the valve; also to close a small triangular space that exists when the valves are opposed, as well as to confer on them increased strength and resistance. These valves are composed of a repli- cation or fold of the serous endocardium, with an inter- vening fibrous layer derived from the tendinous ring, their "use being to prevent reflux of blood from the artery into the ventricle, an action which is purely me- chanical. The pulmonary artery from its origin passes at first upwards and forwards, then backwards and towards the left side, curving round the anterior and left side ot the aorta, and after a course of about two inches it di- vides into right and left branches, which pass, one to each lung As it ascends it is covered in front by the serous layer of the pericardium, which serves to connect it to the heart, and here sometimes a deficiency exists be- tween the aorta and this vessel near their roots, some- what resembling in arrangement similar parts in the Crocodilus Lucius. The blood, having undergone the requisite change from venous to arterial in the lungs, is

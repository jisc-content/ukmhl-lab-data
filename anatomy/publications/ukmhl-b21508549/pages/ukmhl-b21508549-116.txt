106 THE OSSEOUS SYSTEM. teriorly, the apex posteriorly, marked by numerous elevated lines, vertical in direction, which dovetail with similar ones of the opposite side, constituting the arti- culation called harmonia; near the anterior extremity a deficiency exists where the bones do not come in con- tact; this is called the incisive fossa, which occupies about the inferior third in thickness of the bone; from this point it bifurcates into two distinct foramina, which fork out like the letter Y—the anterior palatine canals which open on the floor of each nostril; the incisive foramen contains the naso-palatine ganglion described by Jules Cloquet. If we now direct our attention to the nasal surface, we will observe it to spring nearly perpen- dicularly upwards from the palate plate; smooth and concave inferiorly, it corresponds to the outer wall of the inferior meatus, perforated above by a large foramen which opens into the antrum of Highmore. This ca- vity occupies the greatest part of the body of the bone, is of a pyramidal shape; the base turned internally, the apex externally, bounded above by the orbital process; in front and externally by the facial, behind by the zygomatic, below by the alveolar, and internally it is closed in by four bones,—the lachrymal anteriorly, the palateposteriorly, the ethmoidabove, and inferior spongy below; these, by their apposition, convert the large foramen into a mere chink, which is further constricted by the mucous membrane, which is thrown into loose folds around its edges. The superior maxillary articulates with two bones of the head,—the frontal and ethmoid, occasionally with the sphenoid, and with all the bones of the face, which it is unnecessary to enumerate, except the infe- rior maxillary. It has eight processes,—the orbital, alveolar, palatine, zygomatic, malar, nasal process, crest, and spine. Its proper foramina are four,—the anterior palatine canal, foramen antri, infra-orbital, and dental; its common, the same number,—the foramen incisivum, posterior palatine, nasal duct, and spheno-maxillary fis- sure. This bone is very early in its development; ossi- fication being apparent in its alveolar arch about the fifth week Another osseous point is said to exist for that portion of the bone which supports the incisor

877 VENOUS SYSTEM. bends outwards behind the inferior attachments of the sterno-mastoid, and opens into tlie subclavian, internal to the entrance of the external jugular, sometimes in common with it. During its course it receives several communicating branches from the internal and external jugular, and immediately above the sternum a trans- verse branch unites them, which receives small twigs from the descending thyroid veins, and below this a branch ascends from the thorax to enter it, which is always large in the lactating female. This vein is fre- quently absent, and is always inversely proportioned to the external jugular. Posterior Jugular Vein commences in the occi- pito-atloid space by a branch from the occipital, verte- bral, and often likewise receiving the small vein which escapes through the posterior condyloid foramen; it passes backwards to clear that space, then runs down- wards and inwards, communicating with that of the opposite side at the transverse process of the axis, then, curving downwards and outwards between the com- plexus and semispinalis colli, covered by the splenius, it winds forwards at the root of the neck, between the transverse process of the seventh cervical vertebra and the upper margin of the first rib, and opens into the posterior part of the corresponding vena innominata, or into the subclavian; we have also seen it joining the external jugular. It receives in its course cross branches from the vertebral and the supraspinous venous plexus, as well as from the muscles of the neck, and its deve- lopement is always inversely proportioned to that of the vertebral veins; it likewise forms a part of the posterior external Eachidian system. VEINS OF THE UPPER EXTREMITY. We will commence the description with those of the hand, first examining the superficial set up to the axilla, and subsequently those deeper branches accompanying the arteries of the fore-arm and arm. Veins of the Hanoâ€”These are principally found on the dorsal region, being situated in that position in order to obviate the pressure to which they would bo con-

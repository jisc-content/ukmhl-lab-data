442 THE MUSCULAR SYSTEM. ment; still further backwards the iliac branch of the ilio-scrotal pierces the external oblique, crosses the crest of the ilium, and bending downwards, supplies the skin ; still nearer the sacrum some cutaneous filaments are vi- sible, derived from the lumbar nerves, and inferiorly a cutaneous flat filament from the lesser sciatic winds round the lower edge of the glutaeus maximus, and is lost about the centre of the region; this is the last cu- taneous nerve found in this situation. A peculiar ab- sorption of the fat of the buttock occurs in morbus coxa, producing flattening; while the numerous cutaneous nerves account for the exquisite sensibility manifested in those hysterical aff'ections simulating hip-jomt disease. GLUTiEAL Fascia On removing the fat, the proper fascia is exposed, strong before, weak posteriorly; it passes from the tensor vagina? over the glutasus medius, where it is tense, and, arriving at the anterior margin of the glutgeus maximus, it splits, one layer passing superficial, the other deeper than that muscle; the su- perficial is attached to the crest of the lUum and to the spines of the sacrum; the deep, weaker, passes be- neath the muscle, adhering to the glutseus medius and capsular muscles, attached behind to the greatsciatic liga- ment, covering and adhering to the gluteal vessels, on which it sends tubules, so confounding them with the surrounding parts that they are with difiiculty isolated Raise the fascia in a line from the sacrum to the great trochanter, and thus expose the— GLUTiEUS Maximus.—Somewhat square, placed on the buttock and superior fifth of the thigh; it arises from a triangular surface on the posterior fifth ot the crest of the ilium, from a depression below it, from the side and back of the fifth piece of the sacrum, also from the coccyx, from the sheath of the erector spins, pos- terior sacro-iliac ligament, and great sacro-sciatic liga- ment; the fibres pass obliquely downwards, outwards, and forwards, become attached to a broad aponeurotic expansion, by which it is inserted into the ias^ia la a and into the line leading from the great trochanter to the linea aspera, between the vastus externus and the ad- ductor magnus, and likewise into the upper third of that Une, above the origin of the short head ot the biceps.

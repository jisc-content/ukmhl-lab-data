860 ARTERIES AND VEINS. wards, between the rectus and crureus, sending several I long branches to both, then descends along the outside ^ of the thigh between the rectus, which is in front of it, ' the crureus, which is behind it, and the vastus extemus, which is to its outside, and, becoming subfascial about two inches above the knee, runs downwards to the upper and outer part of the patella, and anastomoses with the superior external articular artery. Internal Circumflex.—Larger than the external, but close to which it usually arises; it passes at first directly backwards, between the tendons of the psoas and inner edge of the pectineus, and then, dividing into two branches,—an ascending, which passesupwards and back- wards on the obturator externus, enters the digital fossa and anastomoses with the obturator, sciatic, and gluteal; and a descending, which runs directly backwards to the posterior surface of the bone, between the obturator ex- ternus and adductor brevis, then between the adductor magnus and quadratus femoris, to communicate mth a siniilar branch from the external, and with the glutasal, sciatic, and first perforating artery. The internal cir- cumflex always gives ofi" a branch to supply the joint, and while in the triangular space, behind the pectineus, anastomoses very freely with the obturators. Anomalies Both circumflex, may arise by a common trunk, or, where the profunda arises some distance below Poupart's ligament, both may spring from the femoral, or one from it, and the other from the profunda. Perforating Arteries.—These are three in number, and they all arise from the posterior wall of the pro- funda,—the first passes backwards, usually between the pectineus.and adductor brevis, and then through the adductor magnus; the second always perforates the ad- ductor brevis, and then the adductor magnus, while the third pierces the latter muscle only; lying now under the hamstring muscles, they freely supply the great sciatic nerve and the areolar tissue m which it is em- bedded, and dividing, each into two branches, whicn anastomose with each other, they likewise communicate above with the sciatic and glutasal, and below with branches of the poplita^al, thus cstablishmg an impor- tant chain of inosculation, which is beautifully displayed

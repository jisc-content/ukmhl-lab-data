THE MUSCULAR SYSTEM. 302 covered on botli surfaces by mucous membrane; tlie handle of a scalpel can be passed upwards on its exter- nal side from the ventricle, showing the existence of a pouch, which in some cases extends upAvards even to the aryteno-epiglottidean folds of mucous membrane: this is the sacculus laryngis, and is covered externally by Hilton's muscle and the ala of the thyroid cartilage. The inferior vocal chord is thick, strong, and round, attached posteriorly to the manubrium of the aryte- noid, and passing horizontally forwards to the angle of the thyroid, close to its lower edge. If the mucous membrane is now carefully dissected from these liga- ments, and also from the stalk of the epiglottis, it will be seen that these structures are continuous, and that they are composed of elastic tissue with parallel fibres, weak and few in the superior, but forming a strong prismatic cord below. Between the superior and inferior cords the ventricle is seen, of a semilunar shape, curved above, straightbelow: from its superior and anterior part the sacculus proceeds; in this situation a foreign body may lodge, and so be without the influence of the co- lumn of air either entering or leaving the larynx. Now cut off the cricoid cartilage from the thyroid, leaving, however, a ring attached, supporting the basis of the arytenoid; in this manner a view may be obtained of the rima glottidis. This constricted space is situated midway between the glottis and tracheal opening, in fio-ure closely resembling the ace of spades on playing- cards. It commences posteriorly narrow between the manubria of the arytenoid cartilage, this portion occu- pying the posterior third of the space; the anterior portion is triangular, the base behind curved, the con- vexity looking backwards, the apex anteriorly blunted; it is bounded before by the angle of the thyroid carti- latre behind by the basis of the arytenoid and upper edge of the cricoid, laterally by the true vocal chords. This opening is subject to extreme variations m size and fiffure during the varied intonations of the voice, and also during respiration, being dilated during inspiration, and contracted whilst expiration is being performed. Above this the false vocal chords project for a short distance into the laryngeal cavity; but it isquite absurd physiologically

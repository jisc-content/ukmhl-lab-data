BRANCHES OF INTERNAL ILIAC. 851 of the great sciatic ligament. Having occupied this tri- angular groove as far as the anterior part of the tube- rosity, it perforates the base of the posterior layer of the triangular ligament, runs between it and the anterior for about half-an-inch, and then, piercing the latter, ascends upwards, forwards, and inwards, between the crus penis, which is anterior and inferior to it, the an- terior layer of the triangular ligament, which is superior and posterior to it, and the ramus of the pubis, which is external to it, dividing at the subpubic ligament into its two terminal branches. Anomalies.—Cases sometimes occur where the com- mon trunk of the sciatic and pudic will pass out of the pelvis before it bifurcates into those two branches, but they are very rare. The most important anomaly in this vessel is, however, where it terminates in the long perineal or artery of the bulb, as in this instance an ac- cessory branch is detached either from the epigastric or external iliac, which passes downwards and backwards behind the back part of the pubis on either side of the membranous portion of the urethra, and then, piercing the triangular ligament, pursues the normal course and division of the true pudic; this branch is occasionally found occupying a more dangerous position, running along the sides of the prostate,—a perilous situation to the lithotomist. During the course of last session we had an opportunity of observing a very curious variety: —the obturator artery sprang abnormally from the epi- gastric, and immediately after its origin threw off a very large branch, which perforated the transversalis fascia, and emerged through the external abdominal ring, de- scended on the front of the pubis, and became the dor- sal artery of the penis. CollateralBranciies of thePuDic.—In its first stage generally a few small twigs to the neck of the bladder; in its second, none; and in its third, from behind for- wards, inferior hajmorrhoidal, transverse perineal, long perineal, artery of the bulb, artery of the cavernous structure, and dorsal artery of the penis. Inferior llyEMORRHoiDAL Generally two or three small twigs, which arise from the pudic at the commence- ment of its third stage; they pierce the obturator fascia

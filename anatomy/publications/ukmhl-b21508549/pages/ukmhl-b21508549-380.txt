External Abdominal Ring.â€”In the present stage of the dissection the ring is still obscured by Camper's fascia or bands. This structure differs in density in accordance with age, and also with the general struc- tural development of the fibrous tissues. If the tendon of the external oblique is examined on a level with the anterior superior spine of the ilium, white silvery fibres can be recognised, passing at first downwards and in- wards, then curving upwards, crossing in direction the fibres of the subjacent tendon; if an attempt is made to raise these bands as a distinct layer, it will fail, as they appear incorporated with the tendon; but as the ring is approached the distinct fibrous arrangement disap- pears, and at the margins of that opening it is suflfi- ciently loose in its attachment to admit of being raised by cautious dissection; it now passes downwards on the cord, or its analogue, the round ligament of the uterus 5 in the former, continued into the scrotum, and in the latter, to the labia, as the external spout-like fascia; in the male it forms the external investment for the tunica communis of the testicle, serving to retain the expanded cremasteric fibres in their natural connexion to each other. Raise this fascia and examine the ring. In the majority of subjects the first separation of the fibres of the tendon of the external oblique occurs above the centre of Poupart's ligament; from this it gradually in- creases until the pubis is reached; this space is covered by the intercolumnar bands, or Camper's fascia, which strengthens the wall of the abdomen in this situation; but where it leaves the tendon, a funnel-shaped space results, and on laying this open the ring is fully exposed. From this description it is evident that the extent of the opening is merely arbitrary in the vertical direc- tion. Although it is customary to consider the ring as triangular, with its base inferiorly and internally at the crest of the pubis, the apex above and without, if the proper attachments of its constituents ought to form the basis of its anatomical description, it will be necessary to examine its condition both on and above the pubis, when this opening will represent an ellipsoid or oval

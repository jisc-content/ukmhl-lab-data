ASTHAGALUS. 69 inferior surface is larger than the superior; it is marked by twofacettes; one posterior and external, oval in shape, concave, looking downwards, forwards, and inwards; the other anterior and internal, likewise of an oval figure, slightly convex, looking directly downwards, much smaller than the other, both covered with cartilage to articulate with corresponding surfaces on theoscalcis; a deep sulcus leading from within, forwards, and out- wards, much larger externally than internally, sepa- rates them, giving attachment to the powerful inter- osseous ligaments that unite the bones together. The external margin is very irregular in its appearance; behind it presents an articulating surface for the ex- ternal malleolus, triangular in shape, the base above, the apex below; concave from above downwards, slightly convex from before backwards; bounded behind and in- feriorly by a rough ridge for the insertion of the poste- rior slip of the external lateral ligament; anteriorly it is scooped out, forming a deep depression, correspond- ing to the side of the neck of the bone. The facette on the internal margin, for the internal malleolus, dif- fers in size and shape from the preceding; it is much smaller, auricular in form, and a little convex. It is bounded below by a wavy groove, studded with fora- mina for the entrance of the nutritious vessels, and be- coming continuous with the neck in front; below and behind is the ridge for the insertion of tlae posterior portion of the internal lateral ligament. If we now ex- amine the anterior extremity of the bone, we will ob- serve a well-marked convex head, forming about one- third of a sphere, oval in shape, long from above and without, downwards, and inwards, covered with carti- lage ; its aspect forwards, inwards, and downwards to articulate with the scaphoid. Its posterior extremity terminates in a well-marked tubercle, internal to which is a deep groove, directed downwards and inwards, through which the tendon of the flexor poUicis glides. The astragalus articulates with four bones: the tibia above and internally, the fibula externally; the os calcis below, and the scaphoid in front. It should, however, be recollected that it has six facettes, as both the tibia and calcis unite with it at two distinct points.

888 ARTERIES AND VEINS. posterior saphenous nerve, on which it lies, but separated from it by a layer of fascia; it possesses two valves, one of which is found at its entrance into the poplitaeal, and the second corresponding to the upper third of the gas- trocnemius; however, we have counted five valves m this vein. Sometimes this vessel, when it arrives at the poplitEEal space, divides into two branches, one of which terminates as usual, passing between the pero- neal and posterior tibial nerves, but always nearer to the latter, in order to reach its destination, whilst the second curves upwards and inwards around the inner side of the thigh, to communicate with the internal saphenous. . , The Deep Veins commence m the sole and dor- sum of the foot, and terminate at Poupart's ligament as the femoral. We will trace them from below up- ^^Plantar Veins are external and internal, the for- mer being the larger of the two, and they follow the course of the corresponding arteries, opening poste- riorly into the venee comites of the posterior tibial ar- tery. The external plantar is nearly four times larger than the internal, and it receives all the muscular branches from the sole of the foot, whilst both are the eflPerent vessels of the deep plantar venous plexuses, as the superficial open into the dorsal venous arch, wind- ing upwards on the outer and inner margins of the *^ Posterior Tibial Veins are two in number, lying one on either side of the corresponding artery, and frequently communicating with each other by cross branches. We have seen but one vein accompanying this vessel, in which case it received the peroneal three inches above the ankle-joint; we have also seen he posterior tibial veins leaving the artery about t e Lddleofthe leg, and passing beneath the margin o th^^^ flexor poUicis to join the peroneal, the POÂ«f *^bial artery not having any accompanying vem from the point mentioned until it arrived at the lower margin of '^SneTvein accompanies the artery of that name, being double like the last, than which it is much larger,

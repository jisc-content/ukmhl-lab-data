551 SMALL INTESTINE. white tenacious secretion, whicli renders them much more easy to be distinguished. Villi—These are distributed throughout the entire of the alimentary tract, but are much more numerous in the small than the large intestines, where they are very few in number; it has, however, been stated that they are altogether absent in the superior transverse and upper part of the vertical portion of the duode- num (Carpenter). They are foliaceous in shape, con- sisting of an involution of mucous membrane, freely supplied by a capillary plexus of both arteries and veins, but they appear to be totally deficient in nerves; generally speaking, they are about one-fourth of a line m length. A vertical section exposes a single duct, sometimes two or three, which anastomose together, and which becomes dilated as it approaches the base of the villus, but on the free surface of the gut no orifice is visible. It was formerly supposed to be covered in by a closed network (Meckel), but according to more recent researches they are found to be clothed with a series of cells of the conoidal class, which are endowed with a selective property of absorbing solely the chyli- ferous products, and when fully distended with this fluid, they burst, discharging their contents into the ducts within the villus, leaving behind their nuclei for the_ regeneration of another series of cells, which are again destined to perform the same office (Goodsir) The nutritive portions of the food having by this means entered within the cavity of the villus, is transferred v.°™ l^- *° lacteals, a class of vessels remarkable for the thinness and transparency of their coats. These run between the layers of the mesentery, traversing in their course the numerous glands which are found in this position, frequently anastomosing, and gradually dmimishing m number, until at length reduced to five or SIX, they pour their contents into the receptaculum chyh or dilated extremity of the thoracic duct, which IS situated opposite the third lumbar vertebra on the front of the spine, immediately behind the abdominal aorta, from which the chyle is ultimately carried into the general venous system. The absorbent surface occupied by the villi is neces-

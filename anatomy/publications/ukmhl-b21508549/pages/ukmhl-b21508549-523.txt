HEART. 513 z 3 ing against the side of the aorta and cava, and the latter against that of the pulmonary artery; while the posterior surface is convex, and marked by a vertical furrow continuous with that between the ventricles, and indicates the situation of the septum auricularum; to its left are seen the terminations of the four pulmo- nary veins, and to the right the two cavse, and the great coronary vein. This surface corresponds to the oesopha- gus, aorta, and spine. The weight of the heart averages from seven to eight ounces. In the adult the blood takes the following course in its pulmonary and systemic circulation:—Collected by the superior, inferior cavse, and great coronary veins, it passes into the right auricle, from which it is urged into the right ventricle, through the right auriculo-ven- tricular opening; from thence propelled through the pulmonary artery,- traversing the pulmonary capillaries, and there undergoing the requisite change from venous to arterial, it is returned by the pulmonary veins to the left auricle, then through the left auriculo-ventricular opening into the left ventricle, and from this cavity it issues by the aorta to ramify through the entire arterial system. Eight Auricle—This is of a conical figure, the apex above a,t the auricular appendix, the base inferiorly at the auriculo-ventricular opening. In order to examine Its cavity make an incision on the posterior wall, from the superior cava to a quarter of an inch above the infe- rior; then carry a second forwards from the last; re- flect the flaps and sponge the cavity, so as to remove any coagulated blood which obscures the several parts on Its walls. The openings into the right auricle are se- ven,—namely, superior and inferior cavse, auriculo-ven- tricular, cofonary veins, one, two, or three in number a small aperture at the superior part of the fossa ovalis,' the opening of communication between the appendix and sinus of the auricle; and lastly, a number of small openings (foramina Thebesii), which are seen principally on the posterior wall. At the highest point of the pos- terior wall the opening of the superior cava is observed • this vessel commences at the upper margin of the car- tilage of the second rib on the right side, formed by the

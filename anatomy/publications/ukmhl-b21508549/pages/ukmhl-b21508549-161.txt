LIGAMENTS OP THE SPINE. 151 disc, which is most intimate in its character. In the lumbar region it is broadest, in the dorsal densest, and in the cervical much the weakest; but in the last it is strengthened by the aponeurotic expansions of the longi colli, which in a great measure conceals it from view; it has no adventitious support in the dorsal, but lies bare, forming the floor for the support of the parts contained in the posterior mediastinum, whilst in the lumbar it is overlapped and supported by the tendinous origins of the crura of the diaphragm and psose muscles. The Posterior Common, or Vaginal Ligament, is situated within the spinal canal, and can, therefore, only be examined by separating the processes from the bodies of the bone through its entire extent; thus exposed, it presents a great similarity to the anterior, but in structure it is much more dense and compact; like it, it stretches from the second cervical vertebra, where it ap- pears to be a continuation of the apparatus ligamentosus colli, presently to be described, to the first bone of the sacrum; its margins are peculiar, from the scolloped appearance which they present, depending on the man- ner in which processes are prolonged on the interverte- bral substance, even through the foramina of conjuga- tion, to be continuous with the anterior vaginal in front; its connexion to the back part of the bone is very slight, being confined to the upper and lower lip only, as the transverse venous sinuses, receiving the blood from the diploe, pass between and separate them, but it is com- pletely incorporated with the posterior edge of the disc; in the dorsal region it is extremely narrow, in the lum- bar more expanded; its posterior surface is divided from the dura mater by fine areolar tissue, which is usually of a reddish colour and watery character. Both the anterior and posterior common ligaments are highly inelastic, and flexion and extension of the spine depends upon displacement, or rather thinning of the intervertebral disc, according as undue pressure is brought to bear on it. Supraspinous Ligaments These are visible only in the dorsal and lumbar regions, but not in the cer- vical, where the ligamentum nuchaj takes their place. This latter is a strong fibrous band, attached above to

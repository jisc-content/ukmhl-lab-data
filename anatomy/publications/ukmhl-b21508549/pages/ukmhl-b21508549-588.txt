578 CAVITY OF THE ABDOMEN. surface, concave, lies on the right cms of the diaphragm, the portal and caval veins, semilunar ganglion, aorta, left crus, with the splenic and mesenteric veins, left su- prarenal capsule and kidney; it also rests partially on the superior mesenteric artery, which tilts forwards its inferior margin; its anterior surface, convex, is in rela- tion with the stomach, but is separated from it by the ascending layer of the transverse mesocolon and sac of the omentum; its superior margin, nearly straight, cor- responds to the superior transverse portion of the duo- denum, lobulus Spigelii of liver, hepatic and splenic ar- teries,—the latter grooving it deeply,—and caahac axis; its inferior, to the second transverse portion of the duodenum, superior mesenteric artery, which emerges from beneath it, and attachment of root of mesentery; this margin is sometimes rendered very irregular by a process which springs from it near its head, passes downwards and to the left side, beneath the superior mesenteric artery, and, after embracing it again be- comes continuous with the body; this has been called the lesser pancreas. . , , The pancreas crosses the spinal column opposite tlie first lumbar vertebra, and is very firmly fixed in its po- sition bv the cEeliac axis and superior mesenteric arte- ries, as well as by the ascending layer of the transverse mesocolon, which confines it closely to the back part of the abdominal cavity. In order to examine its duct (canal of Wirsung), the anterior surface of the gland should be very cautiously removed from one extremity to the other to a depth a little beyond its centre; it will be known at once by its milk-white colour, which contrasts strikingly with the general hue of the gland, in the tail of which it will be observed to commence, generally double, being very small at first but gradu- ally increasing in size as it approaches its head ; at thi point it bends downwards and to the right side ,and onens either into the duodenum directly or umtes very Sue y w'th the ductus communis choledochus imme- dia elv before thelatter perforates the gut; occasionally a second duct is present from the lesser pancreas, and tlS mav either terminate in the ordinary manner or by a era-te%erture in the gut.

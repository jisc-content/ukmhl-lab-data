38 THE OSSEOUS SYSTEM. external condyle is small; it lies on a plane inferior to the internal, afFording origin to the extensors and su- pinators. The extremity of the humerus is twisted forwards, cut off obliquely from above downwards and inwards, presenting a series of processes which may be thus enumerated from without inwards. First, the ca- pitulum, oval in shape, covered with cartilage, looking directly forwards for articulation with the radius, be- condly, a groove, shallow, and limiting the process in- ternally. Thirdly, a ridge slightly elevated, the ex- ternal boundary of-fourthly, the trochlea, a large articular surface for the sigmoid notch of the uhia, concave from side to side, convex from before back- wards, limited behind by a deep depression for the ole- cranon process during extension of the fore-arm, and for the Haversian gland, in front by a shallower excavation for the coronofd process during flexion. These depres- sions often communicate, and at all times are separated merely by a thin plate of bone. The aspect of the trochlea is downwards, forwards, and outwards. Fifthly, the epi- trochlea, the internal lip of the last-mentioned process prominent and well marked, forming three-fourths of a circle, oblique on its external aspect and covered ^^nth cartilage, flattened on its internal, and presentmg nume- rous foramina for the passage of nutritious vessels. The humerus articulates with tnree bones :_the sca- pula above, and the radius and ulna below. It is de- veloped by seven points of ossification: one for the body, whkh is visible from the fortieth to the fiftieth day; Tne for the head; and one for the great tuberosity; one for the capitulum; one for the trochlea, and one for each condyle m^nng seven in all. The last six make their T^Zr^nl from the first to the twelfth year, but they a?? not all united together, so as to constitute one bone, ''U.~^^^^^^^^^ belongs to the class of long bones; and for the purposes of description ^e^^^^^^^^^^ into a; olecranon and coronoid process, ^^P^^f;^ ^y t^^^^ great sigmoid cavity; a shaft; a head, and ^t^l;^^ cess The olecranon forms the highest point of the bon; and may be justly regarded as the continuation upwards of the shaft, 'on observing it superiorly, we

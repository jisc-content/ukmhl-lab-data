CEREBRAL NERVES. 685 Pharyngeal Nerve—A small branch, which is sometimes double, arising from the ganglion of the pneu- mogastnc, about a quarter of an inch below the base of the skull, and passing downwards and inwards, rein- forced by filaments from the glosso-pharyngeal and sym- pathetic, It joins the pharyngeal plexus. Pharyngeal PLExus.-Triangular in figure, the base corresponding to the superior and middle constrictors and the apex posteriorly between the two carotids: it IS formed by the pharyngeal branch of the pneumogas- tric, by a branch from the superior laryngeal and glosso- pharyngeal, with many grey filaments from the superior cervical ganglion of the sympathetic; and its branches, atter frequent intercommunications, are distributed to the superior and middle constrictors, as well as to the mucous membrane of the pharynx. Of this plexus the superior laryngeal and glosso-pharyngeal are alFerent, and the pharyngeal branch of the pneumogastric efi-e- rent or motor, this latter probably deriving its function from the communicating branch of the spinal accessory. Superior Laryngeal equals in size the third cere- bral nerve, and arises from the pneumogastric ganglion below the pharyngeal, then passes downwards, forwards and inwards and piercing the thyro-hyoid membrane' IS distributed principally to the mucoils membrane of the larynx In its course it lies on the superior cervical ; ganglion of the sympathetic, ascending pharynaeal ar- tery, rectus capitis anticus major, descending fi'bres of ^the s ylo-pharyngeus muscle, between the inferior and : middle constrictors; and lastly, on the thyro-hvoid : membrane; it passes behind the internal andTxterna ^ carotids, lingual and superior thyroid arteries and thyro-hyoid muscle, and whilst parsing behind the Tn :ternal carotid it gives off the external laryngeal nerte mhich running downwards and inwards, sends a fila^ ■ment to the pharyngeal plexus; a second to the thyroid ^body and a third to the inferior constrictor; the^con- tinuation of the trunk, passing beneath the tlmoidbodv ^and lying between the inferior constrictor and the ak o^- he thyroid cartilage, terminates in the crico-thyroid muscle In one case only we observed that this branch ran between the inferior and middle constrictors, Jl"cn

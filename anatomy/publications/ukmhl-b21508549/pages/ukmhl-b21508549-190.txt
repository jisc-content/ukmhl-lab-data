180 THE ANATOMY OF THE JOINTS. seous; the two former are very strong, composed of dense white fibrous tissue, running in parallel fasciculi from the anterior and posterior parts of the tibia, downwards and outwards, to the corresponding margins of the external malleolus; they are prolonged^ particu- larly the posterior, below the edges of the tibia, and thus tend to increase materially the depth of the arti- cular socket for the reception of the astragalus; the fasciculi which compose these ligaments are occasionally interrupted by a considerable interval, which has led many anatomists to describe them as double; that in front is covered by the extensor, and that behind by the flexor tendons. Interosseous or Middle Trtjio-FisuLAR Liga-aient This is so completely enveloped in adipose tissue, that it is sometimes difficult to find it; when, however, this has been removed, its white shining fibres will be ob- served decussating with each other, and extending for some distance between the adjacent bones; its rem°ark- able strength may be tested by dividing the anterior and posterior ligaments, and then endeavouring to se- parate them: this will often be found an operation of some difficulty. Synovial Membrane—This is a process derived from that of the ankle-joint. ANKLE-JOINT. The tibia, fibula, and astragalus, enter into the for- mation of this articulation, which, from the motions which it possesses, is termed an incomplete ano-ular ginglymus; it is remarkable for its great strength and security, which it derives as well from its powerful ligaments, as the manner in which the bones that com- pose it are arranged,—the two malleoli with the ante- rior and posterior tibio-fibular ligaments, constituting a very perfect socket for the reception of the trochlea of the astragalus; the several tendons springing from the leg likewise act as auxiliary media in conferring additional security on the articulation. Its ligaments consist of an anterior, a posterior, an external, and an internal lateral. Anterior Ligament.—This is exposed by removing the extensor tendons from the front of the joint, but

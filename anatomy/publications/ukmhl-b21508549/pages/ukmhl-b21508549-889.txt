VENOUS SYSTEM. 879 the annular ligament, and, ascending a little to the outer side of the middle of the fore-arm, perforates the fascia about an inch below the flexure of the joint to termi- nate in one of the vense comites of the brachial, thus constituting the mediana profunda; but it also gives off two additional branches,—median basilic, which, run- ning upwards and inwards over the origins of the flexors and pronators, with the semilunar fascia of the biceps, this latter structure separating it from the brachial ar- tery, it joins the basilic vein; while the median cepha- lic, passing upwards and outwards over the external cutaneous nerve in the fissure between the tendon of the biceps and the supinator longus, enters the cephalic vein. It must be observed, that these veins are by no means regular in size, number, or arrangement, fre- quently differing on the opposite sides of the same sub- ject, so that in the foregoing description we have merely selected the more usual course. In their whole extent they are situated in the superficial fascia. The Deep Veins of the Fore-arm are, the radial, ulnar and interosseal, which, being usually two for each arterial vessel, exactly follow their course. The Brachial Veins are double, but at the junction of the upper and middle third of the artery they unite with the basilic to form a single trunk. We say that the former unite with the latter, because the resulting vein is in the direct course of the basilic, and lies in- ternal to the brachial artery, but sometimes the three branches remain separate, even to the point where the vessels are supported by the subscapular tendon. Axillary Vein.—This is a large trunk, forming a continuation of the brachial, commencing at the lower edge of the latissimus dorsi and teres major tendons; and, passing upwards, forwards, and inwards in an arched direction, it terminates at the lower border of the first rib, at tiie commencement of the subclavian. Below, or in its first stage, it lies in front of the axillary artery; in the second stage, still anterior, but a little internal; and above, or in the third, anterior and internal, and usually a little inferior; as it lies beneath the clavicle a process of the ligamentum bicorne is prolonged on it, this tubule having a tendency to retain the vessel in a pa-

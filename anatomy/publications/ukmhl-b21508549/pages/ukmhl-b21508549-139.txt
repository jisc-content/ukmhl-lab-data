PALATINE PROCESS. 129 G 3 the orbital process of the palate anteriorly, its nasal plate interiorly, its sphenoidal process posteriorly, and above by the body of the sphenoid. From its posterior wall the Vidian canal commences, and passes back- wards and outwards, to terminate in the anterior lace- rated foramen; it contains the nerve of the same name; from its anterior wall springs the infra-orbital canal, which opens on the face beneath the orbit, carry- ing the infra-orbital nerve and artery. We will now return to the mesial line, and examine the posteriornares; these present oval apertures, long in their vertical diameter, constricted from side to side, bounded above by the body of the sphenoid, below by the palate processes of the palate bone, externally by the internal pterygoid plates, and internally by the vomer; they communicate directly with the cavity of the pharynx, and are the channels for respiration in normal condi- tions. As we pass still farther forwards, we find lying on a plain anterior and inferior to these, the hard pa- late, parabolic in shape, with the curve directed for- wards, bounded anteriorly and laterally by the alveolar arches, and posteriorly by the free margins of the palate bones, which here present a double lunated edge, owing to the prominence of the spine in the mesial line. The hard palate is always more or less concave in all indivi- duals, but it is very variable as to its degree, extremely rough for the attachment of the mucous membrane, pre- senting, in the middle line, at the junction of its pos- terior with its two anterior thirds, a crucial ridge formed by the decussation of the sutures between the palates and superior maxillaries; that between the latter being incomplete anteriorly from the existence of the inci- sive fissure; towards its posterior and external angles â– we observe two foramina, the anterior large, the exter- nal orifice of the posterior palatine canal; the posterior much smaller, its accessory transmitting a small nerve for the supply of the soft palate. Leading from this ori- fice in a direction forwards and inwards, and bounded externally by the alveolar arch, is a deep groove, which lodges the anterior branch of the posterior palatine nerve in its course to the foramen incisivum, to form by its

651 MEMBRANES OF CORD. pia mater, and in the mesian line on the posterior aspect of the cord a species of septum, sometimes imperfect or cribriform, appears to unite one to the other (Sharpey). The continuity of the visceral with the parietal layer is* preserved by the reflection of the membrane in a series of tiibules on the nerves. Pia Mater.—This, which forms the immediate in- vestment of the cord, is continuous with the same struc- ture of the brain, but it differs from it in several im- portant particulars, being fibrous in its character, and having little vascularity; it likewise invests the cord most tensely, as may be shoAvn by puncturing it, when there will be a hernia of the neuriue through the aper- ture; it sends a dense process into the anterior median furrow (membrana resplendens of Haller), and a smaller and less obvious one into the posterior. As it descends, it throws off a neurilemma around each of the nerves as they pass through it, and inferiorly it terminates in a thm filament (filum terminale), which is prolonged downwards in the centre of the cauda equina, surrounded by a tubule of dura mater, becoming attached to the lower part of the canal of the coccyx; this was for- merly considered by the older anatomists as a prolonga- tion of the cord itself, to which they applied the name nervus impar. On tracing this fibrous envelope up- wards from the medulla oblongata, a gradual change in Its character will be observed to take place, as it imper- ceptibly becomes more areolar, and its vessels more numerous, as it spreads out to invest the tissue of the brain. LiGAMENTUM Denticulatum.—This is a flattened band ol fibrous tissue, extending from the foramen mag- num to the first lumbar vertebra; it presents an internal plane margin, which is thin, and attached to the pia mater of the lateral part of the cord, between the ante- rior and posterior roots of the nerves, and an external thicker and deeply serrated, having twenty-one or twenty-two teeth,_the first, the longest, being at- tached to the dura mater, on a level with the foramen magnum, separating the vertebral artery from the lin- gual and spinal accessory nerves; the others are in a similar manner connected by their points to the same 2 F 2

179 TIBIO-FIBULAR ARTICULATION. internal condyle of the femur is fixed, while the exter- nal glides in the corresponding socket of the tibia. The active instruments in producing this motion are the biceps and poplitseus, the former pulling the head of the fibula, and, of course, that of the tibia, to which it is firmly connected, backwards, while the latter replaces it in its original position; rotation is more extensive outwards than inwards, owing to the peculiar arrange- ment of the crucial ligaments,—in the first they are untwisted, and become nearly parallel to each other, while in the second their decussation is increased, limiting effectually all further inversion. TIBIO-FIBULAR ARTICULATION. The tibia and fibula articulate with each other above and below, forming at each point a plane arthrodial joint, the motions of which are of a gliding character, but very inconsiderable; they are secured by very strong ligaments, partictilarly inferiorly, while a powerful in- terosseous serves as a further bond of union between the bones. Superior Tibio-fibular Ligaments.—These are an- terior and posterior, consisting of very strong fibres, irrunning obliquely from above and within, downwards j and outwards; they are extremely tense, and scarcely permit the slightest motion between the contiguous surfaces; they are covered in by the tendinous origins if the extensor longus, peronseus, and solseus; a synovial membrane, sometimes isolated, but sometimes conti- nuous with that of the knee, lines the joint. Interosseous Ligament This extends between the adjacent margins of the bones nearly for their entire length, being, however, deficient above, for the passage of the anterior tibial vessels, and below for the ante- rior peroneal; it is exceedingly strong, the majority of its fibres running from within, downwards and out- j wards, but traversed by others fewer in number, and ttaking a contrary direction; besides its use as a liga- nraent, it likewise serves to give origin to the numerous ranuscles which are found in this region. Inferior Tibio-fibular Ligaments.—These are three lin number,—an anterior, a posterior, and an interos-

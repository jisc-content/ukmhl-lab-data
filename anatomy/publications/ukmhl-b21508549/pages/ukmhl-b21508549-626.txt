616 KERVOUS SYSTEM. cranii, terminates in the jugular vein. In the posterior portion it is triangular, lying in the bifurcated edge of the tentorium, but anteriorly circular, in consequence of the depth of the bony groove, and being only covered by one layer of dura mater. The terminal point of this sinus has the following relations:—Anteriorly, inferior petrosal sinus; posteriorly, the transverse process of the occipital bone, which presents an excavation for its re- ception; externally, the jugular fossa in the petrous portion of the temporal bone; and internally, the eighth pair of nerves. The veins communicating with the la- teral sinus are the following:—Lateral and inferior cere- bral, commencing by branches on the sides and under surface of the posterior part of the cerebral hemispheres, uniting into four or five trunks, and opening from be- fore backwards into the horizontal portion of the sinus: also the inferior and lateral cerebellar veins, which, commencing on the under surface of its lobes, run to- wards its circumference, and, uniting into three trunks, likewise open into the lower wall of the horizontal por- tion of the sinus; and lastly, it receives the mastoid vein, by which a communication is established between it and the occipital. Posterior Occipital Sinuses.—These are exceedingly small, and lie between the layers of the falx cerebelli; commencing at the lower angle of the torcular Hero- phili, they pass at first vertically downwards; then, di- verging behind the foramen magnum, they run forwards to communicate with the lateral sinuses just at their terminations; but occasionally we have seen them join- ing the posterior condyloid vein, and still more rarely beuig cffical, inferiorly receiving veins from the dura mater and bone, but we have not observed any other communication. Torcular Herophili implies the occipital conhuence of the sinuses. It is well seen by removing a portion oi bone about one inch square, including theoccipital protu- berance. Its figure is diamond-shaped, being formed by the common attachment of the falx cerebri, cerebelh, and tentorium, and exhibits six openings,-one superiorly, superior longitudinal sinus; two inferiorly, occipital; one at each lateral angle, lateral; and one anteriorly, the

CAVITY OF THE ABDOMEN. 542 sufficient strength to preserve the shape and general ap- pearance of the organ. This may be proved by a sim- ple experiment. In removing the outer coats as far as the fibrous layer, and making a small perforation in the latter, on forcibly inflating the stomach, the mucous membrane will be found to protrude; and if the organ is again inverted, and the mucous membrane dissected off, a similar result will follow with respect to the muscular layers, when inflation has been carried to a sufficient ex- tent. The fibrous coat is reticular in its arrangement, and is closely adherent to the muscular. Mucous Coat.—This can only be examined properly in a recent stomach, which should be everted, and the mucus washed off by a gentle stream of water. It is smooth and soft to the touch, of a pale pmk colour, not of an uniform hue, but alternately presentmg lighter and darker shades, marked by a series of sinuous folds, o-enerally longitudinal, but sometimes intersected by others, taking an oblique direction (rugs), with inter- vening furrows,—those folds being more numerous and better developed near the pyloric orifice and its inferior border, a mechanism employed by nature to allow rapid distention, in which state they become nearly oblite- rated At the oesophageal orifice it forms small, loose, pendulous processes, divergent like the rays of a star which may likewise be effaced by the dilatation of that tube, and these are said to be typical of the valve found in this position in the horse. At the pyloric openmg it is suspended from the muscular ring, presenting a rounded constricted orifice, partially impeding the tran- sit of the chyme from the stomach into the duodenum, and equally preventing its regurgitation from the latter into the former. It is very loosely connected to the sub- iacent fibrous tissue by fine areolar tissue, and is much denser and stronger towards its oesophageal than pylo- ric extremity, while it is covered for its entire extent by a thin layer of columnar epithelium. But although the surface, on a cursory examination, ^^PP^^^^^ ° smooth and uniform, it is not really so, as it is .tudded with numerous elevations, each presenting a small pit ov depression, in the bottom of which are apparent the o ifices of several small tubes, which, if traced by aver-

CAVITY OF THE ABDOMEN. 534 its thick margin forwards as far as this point, thus pro- ducing two layers of the membrane, one in front and one behind the fissure; these pass downwards, separated from each other, however, by the vessels of the liver, till they reach the concave margin of the stomach, consti- tuting the gastro-hepatic or lesser omentum. At the upper edge of the stomach they diverge,—one passing in front of it, the other behind it, but after inclosing this viscus they again unite at its convex margin and proceed downwards as a double layer, free and floating in front of the viscera, and, arriving at the lower part ot abdomen, they are suddenly inflected upwards and back- wards on themselves, thus forming four layers,—the great omentum. As they now continue their course upwards and backwards, they meet with the transverse colon, which they split to inclose, and again uniting continue their course to the spine,-the transverse meso- colon. Here they are again divided by the inferior transverse portion of the duodenum, which crosses the vertebral column at this point; one layer proceeds di- rectly upwards, the ascending layer of the transverse mesocolon, investing partially the first and second por- tion of the duodenum, the aorta, pancreas, and cava; reaches the back part of the diaphragm, from which it is inflected on the under surface of the l^^^^' ^^/f .^1 the transverse fissure, becoming continuous ^ttl^is point with the process which we assumed ^^^f instituting he posterior layer of the lesser omentum. If we now leturn to the second portion of the transverse mesocolon called its descending layer, we will find that it is attached to the left side of ie body of the second lumbar vei-tebra and to the right ilio-sacral symphysis,--the ™ot ot the mesentery; and from this it sends out a la^^ge pioces which nearly encircles the small intestines, ^^^^n it again returns to it's original attachment the mesen ei y foWs being likewise prolonged into the lumbar ^^S^^^'^^f incr down and partially covering the ascending and de sLVdrng colonsUthe ^ght and left ^^^^^^^^^^ into the Uiac regions, to the Ccnecum ^^^^/^S'^^^^g^^^^^^^^ whicli they likewise incompletely mvest-the hist bcm^ c med thlmesoccum, but tbo latter has received no d^^^^ finite name.

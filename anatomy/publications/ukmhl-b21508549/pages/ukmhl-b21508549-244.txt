THE MUSCULAR SYSTEM. 234 the anterior edge is curved, bounded by the tendo oculi, and sometimes by a projecting crest of bone, for its attachment; posteriorly the edge is straight and limited by the origin of Horner's muscle; below, its junction with the nasal duct is indicated by a spur of the superior maxillary, directed backwards; its superior termination is marked by the naso-frontal suture; the sulcus is deeper below than above, its greater depth in- feriorly resulting from the standing out of the maxillary bone; this projection is sometimes so great that a knife passed directly backwards will fall external to the sac, but the nearer to the lower edge of the tendon the more easily is the cavity reached, in consequence of the arrangement of the bony sulcus. Internal Attachment of the Tendo Ocull —Now that the lids have been divided, and one attachment of the tendon raised, and reflected outwards, it will be seen that this structure really consists of four por- tions, but still united with each other. One layer, thin but strong, is attached to the ridge of the os unguis; a second to the nasal process of the maxillary, bounding the sac above; this is continuous with the last by its posterior edge, and in front with the following,—the thick straight tendon which is attached to the superior maxillary above and before the sac; and the fourth por- tion is a continuation of the latter downwards, on the anterior edge of the lachrymal groove. About one- third of the sac is above the straight tendon, but some- times less, this variation not depending on the size of the latter, but rather on the point of attachment of the tendon itself to the bone. Now lay open the cavity; the mucous membrane lining it is reddish and soft, and adherent to the bone by a fibrous layer. Below, its junction with the nasal duct is marked by a circular fold; this is rarely complete, merely visible on the an- terior part, and depending on that osseous spur before alluded to in the description of the bony fi-amework. Now pass a probe into the nasal duct and dilate the an- terior nares, when its extremity will be seen projecting beneath the inferior spongy bone, about an inch from the anterior opening, thus indicating the passage by which the lachrymal secretion reaches the nose. The tears secreted by the lachrymal gland are poured out

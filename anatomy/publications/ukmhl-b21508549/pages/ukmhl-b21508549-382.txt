THE MUSCULAR SYSTEM. 372 prolonged backwards through the muscle to its posterior edge; reflect the flaps from before in order to expose the internal oblique. OBLiQuuslNTERNUSvelAscENDENS.—Somewhat quad- rilateral; wider before than behind; tendinous ante- riorly and posteriorly; fleshy superiorly and inferiorly; it arises from the anterior edge of the lumbar fascia, from all the crest of the ileum, from the two iliac thirds of the inner surface of Poupart's ligament, which is grooved for the receptioxa of its fibres; the iliac and lumbar por- tions pass obliquely upwards, forwards, and inwards, and those from Poupart's ligament curve downwards and inwards to reach the conjoined tendons, arching over the spermatic cord; it is inserted into the points of the cartilages of the six inferior ribs, and at the linea semi- lunaris forms an aponeurosis, which is wider above and below than in the centre, and at the last-named line splits into two laminses to enclose the rectus; that layer which passes behind becoming continuous with the apo- neurosis of the transversalis muscle, and that in front Avith the tendon of the external oblique; in the mid- space, between the umbilicus and pubis, the four leaves of aponeurosis pass in front of the rectus, and become intimately incorporated inferiorly. This aponeurosis is attached superiorly to the cartilage of the last true and first false rib, to the ensiform cartilage, crest, and linea innominata of the pubis. Relations.—It is covered by the external oblique and latissimus dorsi, a small triangular portion being seen above the crest of the ileum, between the last-named muscles; on the surface the scrotal branch of the ileo- scrotal nerve, also the ilio-hypogastric, are observed; near to the spine of the ileum the inferior fibres of this muscle are arched over the cord, this margin in the male being closely incorporated with the cremaster, but in the female its limit is obscurely defined. The conjoined tendon consists of the aponeurosis of the internal oblique and transversalis; from this the external oblique can be separated with the handle of the scalpel, but they are themselves so closely incorporated that even by dis- section it is impossible to produce a separation; in exa- mining their pubic attachment, that into the symphisis

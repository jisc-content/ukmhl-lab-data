THE MUSCULAR SYSTEM. 308 artery and brachial plexus; it is very often absent. It may be called scalenus anticus minor. Relations.—In front, the anterior scalenus, brachial plexus, and subclavian artery, behind, levator angub, scapulae, splenius, transversalis colli, and the cervicalis descendens; externally, serratus magnus,sterno-mastoid, and transversalis colli artery; internally, the first inter- costal layer and rib, cervical vertebrae, and intertrans- verse muscles. It is pierced by the long respiratory nerve. Action Similar to the last. DISSECTION OF THE UPPER EXTREMITY. Directions.—The shoulders of the subject being raised by a block, and the arms elevated to right angles with the side, make an incision through the integument from the sternal end of the clavicle to the ensiform cartilage; also continue the incision backwards on the side of the chest, at right angles to the first; then let a third be car- ried outwards along the clavicle, arching downwards to terminate at the upper third of the arm; reflect the skin, and the following parts are brought into view:— origin of platysma myoides, descending branches of cer- vical plexus of nerves, and the superficial fascia. Superficial Fascia.—A thin sheet of areolo-fibrous tissue; continuous with the similar covering in the contiguous regions; descending from the neck, and pass- ing over the clavicle, it covers the anterior and lateral parts of the thorax; externally it forms the floor ol the axilla; internally, continuous with that of the opposite side and below with the abdominal superficial layer; thick above, thin and indistinct inferiorly, occasionally loaded with fat, and generally so in the female; and with the absence of fatty deposit in the male, there is a more distinct fibrous character, with consequent density and resistance; in the female, it also splits to fonn'a capsu e for the breast, sending processes into the gl'^^f jor its support (ligamenta suspensona); on the clavicle are the uJLlalicular branches of the cei;vical plexus, ong and flat like ribbons; they lie in the struc ure of the fascia beiig destined for tl/e supply of the jl-racic - tegument; a few scattered fibres of the platysma, that

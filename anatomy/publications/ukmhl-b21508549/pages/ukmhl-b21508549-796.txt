786 ARTERIES AND VEINS. bifurcated regularly at the thyroid cartilage, but while the internal carotid ran its usual course, that which re- presented the external only ascended a line or two, and then broke up into its numerous branches, each pursu- ing its ordinary direction; the appearance of this ano- maly when dissected was extremely beautiful. Branches of the External Carotid.—Besides those which it gives off to the tympanum and parotid, which are very variable in number and size, it likewise throws off ten others which are always capable of demonstra- tion • thesemay be termed, anterior, posterior, transverse, and ascending,—the first consisting of three, viz., su- perior thyroid, lingual, and facial-, the second also ot three, viz., muscular, occipital, and posterior auricular; the third of two, viz., the transverse facial and internal maxillary; and the fourth also of two, viz., ascendmg pharyngeal and temporal rri Superior Thyroid is the first branch given off by the external carotid from its internal side alter its origin, and may be divided into two stages,—a transverse, reaching, in a curved direction, the convexity directed upwards, from its parent trunk to the side of the larynx, and vertical, extending from the latter point to the thy- roid gland. , . x i„ Rdations-FirstStage.-Kui^riox\y, integument, pla- tysma, superficial fascia, formative branches of the an- terior jugular vein, and twigs of the descendens noni to the sterno-hyoid and omo-hyoid muscles -, posteriorly, loose areolar tissue, and superior laryngeal nerve, sepa- parating it from tli.e longus colli muscle. ^ Second ^fai7e.-Anteriorly, omo-hyoid, and, near its termination, sterno-thyroid; posteriorly, ^VV^l^^^^^_ of sterno-thyroid, and then winding beneath its exter nalmargin,'thy-id origin of tl--feinor constri tor On reaching the latter point, it divides into three bianches,_an external, which runs on the outside of tl e thy;oid gland, and anastomoses with the interior ti yroS; a middle, which perforates the substance of M and breaks up into numerous ramusculi for s supply ; and an internal, which ^uns on its inner side towards &e middle line, supplies the middle obe, and ends a branch across the crico-thyroid space to anasto-

SUBMAXILLARY GLAND. 265 ' This space is divided into two unequal parts by the stylo- : maxillary ligament,—the anterior, or submaxillary, : the posterior, or parotidean region; the latter is the ;smaller of the two; the anterior contains the submaxil- lary and sublingual glands, and the genio-hyoid range of [lymphatics, the mylo-hyoid, lingual, and gustatory I nerves, the facial, lingual, and submental arteries, with tthe supra-hyoid muscles. In the posterior are contained, I from superficial to deep, the auricularis magnus nerve, texternal jugular vein, lower lobe of the parotid, cer- 'vico-facial branch of portio dura, external carotid, ^ styloid process, origin of styloid muscles, stylo-hyoid [ligament, internal carotid, jugular vein, eighth, ninth, :and sympathetic nerves, and ascending pharyngeal and [palatine arteries. Submaxillary Gland.— Intermediate in size be- •tween the parotid and sublingual, is situated in the : anterior digastric space, and consists of a superficial and deep portion; it is bounded in front by the ramus of :the jaw, which presents an oval depression in this situ- ;ation; behind, by the posterior belly of the digastric; ^externally, by the angle of the jaw, stylo-maxillary liga- tment, and internal pterygoid muscle; internally, by •.the anterior belly of the digastric; inferiorly, it is co- >vered by the integument, platysma, and fascia; it lies lin contact with the mylo-hyoid, stylo-hyoid, and ten- . don of the digastric; the superficial portion is oblong J and lobulated, surrounded by a quantity of lax areolar ttissue, which separates it from the fascia, and allows of periodic enlargement; at the posterior margin the (duct emerges from the body of the gland, and winds I round the posterior edge of the mylo-hyoid, so as to get tabove that muscle and lie on the hyo-glossus; the deep [process accompanies the duct, forming a linear series ■of lobules on each side of that tube, connected above tto the sublingual gland. The course of the Whar- ctonian duct is first backwards and upwards, then for- \ wards and inwards, over the inferior surface of the :hyo-glossus; in this situation it lies below the sublin- :gual gland, to which it is connected, but the communi- cation between them is not at all certain; it next winds 1 above the gustatory nerve, getting between the sublin- N

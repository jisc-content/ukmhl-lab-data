THE MUSCULAR SYSTEM. 296 arytenoid muscles; and still more inferiorly, the edge is prolonged forwards and inwards, forming a remarkable process, the manubrium, which gives attachment to the inferior vocal chord. The superior surface looks back- Avards, is broad and concave, covered by the arytenoid muscles and mucous membrane; the external surface is separated from the ala of the thyroid by the lateral crico-arytenoid, and above by mucous membrane; the internal surface is merely involved by the proper lining membrane. CoRNicuLA or Capitula of Santorini.—These are two small pyramidal cartilages, directed inwards and backwards, moveable on the arytenoid, rarely fixed, surrounded by the aryteno-epiglottidean folds of mu- cous membrane, and a few fibres of the epiglottidean muscles. Cuneiform Cartilages.—These small bodies are found in the aryteno-epiglottidean folds, just in front of the cornicula; they are sometimes absent, a reddish mass occupying their usual situation; when removed from their situation it is difficult to free them from the investing areolo-fibrous tissue, which has^ led many authors to mistake their natural figure ; it is only after maceration for a short period that a correct opinion can be formed of them; they are are pris- matic, the base above, the long axis directed from be- fore bacKwards. Epiglottis.—A fibro-cartilage, situated above and before the glottis; when examined before any dissection, it appears to be triangular, but on tracing it to the inferior attachment the figure is leaf-shaped; it is pro- perly divisible into two portions,—the superior, free, shaped like the mouth of an ewer, concave on the lingual surface in the vertical direction, and convex trans- versely; the opposite on the laryngeal surface; the inferior or fixed portion is stalk-like, attached below to the notch in the angle of the thyroid cartilage by the thyro-epiglottidean ligament; above to the tongue by- three folds of mucous membrane (glosso-epiglottidean), the central being the larger of the three, and called the frajnum epiglottidis; a yellow elastic lamina also acts as a bond of union in this situation (glosso-epiglot-

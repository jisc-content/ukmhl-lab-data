CEREBRUM. 623 the whole surface represents the centrum ovale majus of Vieussens, containing in the median line the corpus callosum. Corpus Callosum, or Commissura Magna Cerebri, consists of a white strong layer of transverse fibres uniting the hemispheres of opposite sides. It is from four to five inches in length, situated nearer the anterior than the posterior part of the brain, and presents for description two surfaces, two margins, with an anterior and posterior extremity. The superior surface, convex from before backwards, corresponds to the hemispheres, from which it is separated by the hemispheric ventricle' also to the callosal arteries and the arachnoid membrane,' which separates it from the concave margin of the falx cerebri; on this surface are seen the following parts: Directly in the median line, running from before back- wards, a depression (raphe) indicating the union of the opposite sides of the brain, and on either side of it two white longitudinal filaments, not unfrequently absent (longitudinal nerves of Lancisi), and about a quarter ot an inch external to these are the grooves for the cal- losal arteries, and still more externally the covered bands of Reil, which are likewise longitudinal, lying on Its surface beneath the gyrus fornicatus. The inferior surface, concave, corresponds in the mesian line ante- riorly to the septum lucidum, but more posteriorly seems blended with the fornix, while on either side it corresponds to the anterior cornu and body of the late- ral ventricle; the margins inclose between them the width of the corpus callosum, which is about one inch and a half, but much wider behind than before and they receive the converging fibres of the hemispheres which, forming the principal structure of this body' unite in its central raphe. The anterior extremity is curved downwards and backwards, constitutino- the genu, then, dividing into a central and two lateral bands, the former passes almost horizontally backwards above the anterior communicating artery and optic com- missure, being intimately connected with the latter and continuous with the grey floor (lamina cinerea) of the third ventricle and tuber cinereum, the latter curv

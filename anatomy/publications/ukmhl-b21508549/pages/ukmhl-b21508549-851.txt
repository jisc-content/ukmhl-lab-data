BRANCHES OF ABDOMINAL AORTA. 841 downwards as far as the scrotum, where they terminate by dividing into two, one for the epididymis, and another tor the testicle, anastomosing with the cremasteric from the deep epigastric, and the deferential from the umbi- lical. Ihey are divided into two stages,—an abdominal and scrotal. Relations First Anteriorly, peritoneum, ure- ter, last coil of the ilium on the right, and sigmoid flexure on the left; posteriorly, psoas muscle and outer edge of the external iliac artery. In this stage the rio-ht may lie either before or behind the cava, and in leaving the abdominal cavity, which they do through the in- ternal ring, they both pass between the vas deferens and epigastric artery, but separated from the latter by one 01 its own venaj comites. In its second stage it descends through the oblique inguinal canal, behind the spermatic veins and in front of the cord, escapes through the ex- ternal ring and runs downwards over the front of the pubis to the upper part of the epididymis, where it divides as already explained,_the testicular branch en- tering the testicle at i ts upper part, and passing between the layers of the mediastinum testis, is distributed by fine_ filaments to the septa of the organ, forming the txinica vasculosa of Sir A. Cooper, while the second is devoted to the supply of the epididymis. In the female the spermatic arteries are shorter and thicker, and are I destined for the ovaries, passing into the pelvis over the .Iliac arteries, and thus entering the broad ligaments. .7";,^^^^'^'««.MESENTERic.-Much smaller^nd shorter .than the superior; it arises from the left side of the ^aorta, opposite the third vertebra, and, passing down! uvards as far as the left sacro-iliac synchondrosist terml mates in the superior hemorrhoidal Collateral Branches—Colica sinistra, arteria si^- ■moidea, and superior ha^morrhoidal ^ •fhp^lpft^'lf-f'''''^''^ VP^^'*^' ^"'^ outwards over the left kidney, and beneath the left lumbar mesocolon aand divides into two branches, the superior a cendinJ tto anastomose with the left branch of the colica iS Hnd the interior descending to communicate wi h th' huperior of the colica sigmoidea, the arches thul formed =mpplying the splenic flexure and descending colon ■ 2i o

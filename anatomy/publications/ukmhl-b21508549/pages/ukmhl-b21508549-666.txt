NERVOUS SYSTEM. 656 the seventh, spinal accessory, and lingual, are motor; whilst the soft root of the fifth pair, pneumogastric and glosso-pharyngeal, are sensitive; and the fifth, taking the anterior and posterior roots conjointly, affords a good example of a compound nerve; further, the nerves of special sense include the olfactory, optic, auditory, and the gustatory branch of the fifth. We will not make any further allusion to this subject at present, as the function of each nerve will be connected with its indi- vidual description. Olfactory or First Pair.—Each olfactory nerve arises by three roots,—an external, middle, and inter- nal; the external, long, slender, and white, takes its origin from that convolution most posteriorly situated in the Sylvian fissure, where it is continued into the corpus striatum, communicating with the fibres of the anterior commissure; the middle, which is grey, arises from the most posterior convolution of the anterior lobe of the brain (caruncula mammillaris); while the inter- nal, white and small, takes its origin from the innermost lobule of the anterior lobe, continued inwards to the rostrum of the corpus callosum, sometimes this latter being double, and of a silvery colour. The three roots converging, unite to form a prismatic trunk, whicb, passing forwards and inwards, is imbedded in a sulcus on the anterior lobe, lying above the arachnoid and be- loAV the pia mater, the grey filament forming the apex of the prism; and on the cribriform plate of the eth- moid bone it expands, forming an oval bulb ot a light arey colour (olivary ganglion), soft, and devoid ot neu- rilemma, and separated from its fellow by the crista galli, whilst inferiorly it is supported by the dura ma- ter body of the sphenoid, and cribriform plate of the ethmoid bone, occasionally extending so lar forwards that it conceals the nasal branch of the ophthalmic nerve. From its inferior surface three sets of branches pass ott, namely, external, middle, and internal; these descend through similarly arranged foramina in the cribriform plate of the ethmoid bone, each branch bemg surrounded by a process of the dura mater, which descends into the nLal^avity to become continuous with the fibrous layer of the Schneiderian membrane.

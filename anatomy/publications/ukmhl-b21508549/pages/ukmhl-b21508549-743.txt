THE SKIN, 733 basement membrane, and united to the subjacent parts by areolar tissue. We will first examine the anatomi- cal elements of the integument, and then describe its function and peculiarities, taking them in the following order:—Ciiticle, rete mucosum, corpus papillare, and the cutis vera or dermis,—these constituents being ana- logous to those of the mucous membrane, the two tissues being continuous at the great outlets of the body. Cuticle—This horny layer of the integument forms a continuous covering for the sensitive surface of the subjacent cutis, and consists of scales which, overlap- ping each other, produce intervening ridges, following a waving or concentric disposition, particularly well marked at the extremities of the fingers. When mi- nutely examined with a lens, funnel-shaped apertures are observed on these ridges, indicating the orifices of the sudoriferous glands and sebaceous follicles, together with the apertures through which the hairs are evolved. The surface may also be observed divided into small square or lozenge-shaped elevated spaces, in consequence of the projection of the papillaj of the cutis. When a portion of the cuticle is raised by maceration, the deep surface appears soft, and impressed by the papilla;, with elongated processes which sink into the hair follicles, sudoriferous and sebaceous glands, and if a portion is scraped off it will be found to consist of cells containing pigment granules, as if they were the scales of the cuti- cle in an immature condition. The cuticle is composed of albumen, and differs re- markably in density in different parts of the body; thus, on the palms of the hands and soles of the feet, glutseal region, scalp, and back, it is thick; whilst on the face, eyelids, penis, points of the fingers, and front of the body generally, it is fine and comparatively smooth. Neither nerves nor vessels have been traced into its structure, which is therefore; like the nails and hair, without orga- nization. Breschet conceived that special glands, of a reddish colour, and exceedingly small, situated in the subcutaneous fatty tissue, secreted the cuticle; but such glands are not present, and it is more just to look on it as a, cell growth evolved by the superficial surface of the cutis; and, in conformity with this view, we find that the

CEREBRUM. g27 of Bicliat, -which is situated at the posterior part of the brain, below the corpus callosum and fornix, and above the superior vermiform process of the cerebellum, and the tubercula quadrigemina. This is merely the trans- verse portion of the great semilunar notch, which may still be traced downwards and forwards on each side of the base of the brain, between the crura cerebri and middle lobes, thus constituting the longitudinal portion of the fissure; through the former the velum interpo- situm enters the brain, and by the latter the choroid plexuses pass into the inferior cornua of the lateral ven- tricles. The velum interpositum consists of a double fold of pia mater, and is triangular in shape, the apex in front, and the base behind, terminating at the foramen commune anterius by uniting with the choroid plexuses, which coiirse along its margins; between the folds of the ve- lum, the vena; Galeni, arachnoid canal, and the pineal gland are situated, and it lies beneath the fornix con- cealing certain parts which will be again noticed when the relative anatomy of the several bodies in the lateral ventricles will be examined. Corpus SxRiATUMâ€”Pyriform in shape, the lamer extremity being directed forwards and inwards the smaller upwards, backwards, and outwards; it is grey on Its external surface, but both white and grey within which has given origin to its name. It corresponds above to the floor of the anterior cornu and body of the lateral ventricle below to the fissure of Sylvius, the island of Reil, and inferior cornu of lateral ventricle- ex- ternally to a white medullary capsule and the substance of the hemisphere; and internally to the anterior com- missure, septum lucidum, sides of the foramen com- mune anterius, tfBnia semicircularis, and optic thala- mus If a section is now made longitudinally into its substance, an horizontal layer of white fibres will be ob served passing outwards to reach the hemisphere an peanng to divide this body into an upper, or vent'ricii- lar, and an inferior, or extraventricular portion, and m addition to these, white fibres from the anterior com' missure radiate through its anterior part. This is thp most vascular body in the brain, and is frequently She

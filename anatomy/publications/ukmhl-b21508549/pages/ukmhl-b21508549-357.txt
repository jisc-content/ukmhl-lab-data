347 MUSCLES OF THE FORE-ARM. ligament and vessels, carpus, interossei, phalanges, and insertion of flexor sublimis tendons; the outer edge cor- responds to the flexor pollicis; the inner to the flexor ulnaris. Action.—To flex the last phalanx, also the wrist; the tendons are firmly bound down by the splitting and in- sertion of the superficial flexor; the slip that passes to the index finger can act separately, as it is not closely connected with the others. Flexor Pollicis Longus. —Narrow and fleshy above, tendinous below; arises from the anterior and inner edge of the radius, from the tubercle above to the pronator quad- ratus below, also from the outer third of the interosseous ligament, and from the coronoid process of the ulna by a fleshy slip, which always is adherent to the flexor sub- limis on its deep surface; sometimes it is digastric; the fibres all pass to a tendon formed on the anterior sur- face, thus constituting a semipenniform arrangement; this tendon passes beneath the annular ligament, lying most external in this situation, crosses obliquely the os trapezium, passes next between the two heads of the short flexor, where it is surrounded by a bursa, then between the sesamoid bones at the base of the first pha- lanx, is received into the digital sheath, and is ultimately inserted into the ungual phalanx. Relations.—This muscle is covered by the radial ori- gin of the flexor sublimis, radial artery and nerve, supinator longus, radial flexor tendon, annular liga- ment, outer head of flexor pollicis brevis, and digital sheaths. It lies on the flexor profundus by its coronoid origin, on the radius, interosseous ligament and vessels, carpus, pronator quadratus, inner head of flexor pollicis brevis, and phalanges; the outer edge lies in contact with the supinator longus; internally the tendon is in close proximity with the flexor profundus; and it here presents a peculiar plicated appearance. Action.—To flex the wrist-joint, also the thumb; an action which is increased by the curving around the tra- pezium bone.

514 CAVITY OP THE CHEST. confluence of the right and left venae innominate; it passes downwards, inwards, and a little forwards, pierces the pericardium obliquely, and reaches the posterior and superior part of the auricle, into which it opens. In its course it lies on the trachea and root of the right lung, the phrenic nerve being anterior, and to its right side with the pneumogastric posteriorly-, internally it lies to the right side of the aorta, towards which it pre- sents a concavity; the auricular orifice looks a little backwards and inwards, being circular and smooth, a perfect continuity subsisting between the fibrous wall of the vein and the areolo-fibrous subserous layer of the auricle, and in addition to this the serous membrane on the external surface of the heart, bemg reflected over the anterior and right side of the vein, whilst the Immg membrane of the auricle (endocardium), which likewise belongs to the class of serous membranes, is prolonged into the venous cylinder. Beneath the opening of the superior cava a projecting lip of thickened muscular tis- sue is observed, but this is by no means invariably pre- sent- it is called tuberculum Loweri, and separates the two caval openings. The projection ot the auricular wall in this situation has been attributed to the meetmg of the currents of blood entering from the superior and inferior cav^, also to the passage of the right pulmonary v7ns behind'the auricular wall impinging on the ca- vity; and lastly, to the existence of a portion of fat very frequently observed in this situation, particularly in old subiects! Beneath this the mterior cava orifice is s en c reular in figure, and much larger than the superior; this vein commences on the right side ot the body of he fifth lumbar vertebra by the confluence o the common iliac; in its course, on the right side of the spineTt'eceives the lumbar, right spermatic renal, and hemtic veins, then passes through the tendmous and TnS ualeral opening in the diaphragm, and, entering ttrtiLa diuX it bends almost horizontally towards u S .Tde openino- into the posterior and inferior part '^ttr^^t^u^^o near Z corresponding aperture :;t:^.eriorc^,tl.t^eir^^^ :^;e:^^r m be â€”n^^o examine the Eustachian

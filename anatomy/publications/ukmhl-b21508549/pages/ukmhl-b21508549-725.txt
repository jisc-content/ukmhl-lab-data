SACRAL PLEXUS. 715 divides into two branches,—a sujoerior, which courses along'the upper margin of the latter muscle, supplying both It and the medius; and an inferior, which, crossing It about its centre, gives filaments to both, and, emerg- ing from between them, pierces the sheath of the tensor vagina3 femoris, in which muscle it is ultimately ex- pended. SACRAL NERVES. These are six in number, and, unlike the lumbar, de- crease m size as they descend. The first and second, which are very large, pass obliquely downwards and outwards, and on the pyriformis unite; the third and fourth, which are only half as large as either of the two pre- cedmg, run more horizontally outwards, and join the compound trunk of the first and second; the fifth, on .emerging from the sacral foramen, divides into two branches, one of which ascends to unite with the fourth, \while the other descends to communicate with the sixth; ■this last nerve is so very small, that its very existence has been sometimes denied, but it always may be found -by cautious dissection. While still within its proper : toramen it divides into its anterior and posterior branch Uhe former, on reaching the front of the sacrum, again >3Ubdividing, one ascending to join the fifth, and the other passing downwards to supply the integument about the coccyx, and also sending a few filaments to 'the giutffius maximus. ^ The Sacral Plexus is, however, constituted by the -our first nerves only, with the communicating branch 3t the himbo-sacral and twigs of the sympathetic. It -s of a triangular shape, the base at the sacrum, and the upex at the great sciatic notch, resting on the pyrifor- nis and covered by the bladder, rectum, vesicular semi- lales, and posterior layer of the pelvic fascia, which eparates it from the descending branches of the inter- lal iliac artery. While within the pelvis it gives off tranches to the bladder and rectum, with the uterus and •agma m the female—some directly to these organs, and 'thers lo join the hypogastric plexus; these being princi- )ally derived from the Iburth and fifth nerves- it likc- nse supplies the following muscles :-Pyriformis, levator

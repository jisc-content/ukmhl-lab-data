BRANCHES OF CAROTID. 797 the latter muscle, along its anterior and posterior mar- gins anastomose with the middle branch of the super- ficial temporal and the perforating twigs of the middle meningeal. Masseteric—Generally small; it passes directly outwards through the sigmoid notch, occasionally pierc- ing the lower fibres of the external pterygoid, bends downwards betVeen the ramus of the jaw and masseter, and then enters the latter muscle, to which it is distri- buted, anastomosing with branches of the facial Pterygoid.—Several small, short twigs, variable in number, which are distributed to those muscles. Buccal —A small but long branch; it runs forwards through the upper part of the pterygoid space along the interior margin of the external pterygoid to the bucci- nator muscle, and on it anastomoses with the facial Posterior Dental.—This is usually a very large branch which is given off at the tuber maxillare, down which It descends for some distance very tortuously and then divides into three branches,-an external, micll die, and internal: the first runs along the alveoli, sup- plying the periosteum and mucous membrane of the teeth; the second pierces the tuber and distributes its branches to their roots, while the third enters the an- trum of Highmore, and its filaments ramify between its mucous membrane and the walls of the cavity Posterior Palatine arises from the internal maxil- lary m the pterygo-maxillary fossa; it immediately bends downwards through the posterior palatine canal and emerging on the hard palate, divides into two prin- cipal branches,-a posterior, which descends to supply the soft palate and tonsils, anastomosing with its fellow . of the opposite side, and with the sublingual; and an an- ■ tenor which curves along the hard palate, internal to ^the alveolar arch, and covered by the mucous mem- ibrane, reaches the foramen incisivum, where it anasto- ■ moses with its fellow and septal branches of the spheno- ; palatine. ^ ,w Jr'^''."^^'''''^' ^ ^^i^'^ passes back- ^wards and outwards in company with the nerve of the ^same name, and is expended on the base of the cranium im supplying the Eustachian tube, anastomosing with ttwigs from the ascending pharyngeal.

ARCH OF THE AORTA. 777 2 L 3 crossing the upper part of the thorax in an oblique di- rection to the left aspect of the second dorsal vertebra (transverse portion), and then descending vertically terminates at the inferior margin of the third (descend- ing portion) by becoming continuous with the thoracic aorta. Relations of Ascending Portion.—AntexiorU ster- num, pericardium, with its serous lining, infundibu- lum, coronary and pulmonary arteries, and superficial cardiac plexus; posteriorly, left auricle, right pulmo- nary veins and artery, and posterior cardiac plexus: to the right side the right auricle and vena cava descen- dens;and to the left the appendix of left auricle and Dilurcation of pulmonary artery. Relations of Transverse Portion.—KxiX^x\ox\y ster num, origin of sterno-thyroid, remains of thymus gland left vena mnominata, which is also superior to it left phrenic, pneumogastric, and superficial cnrdiac nerves- posteriorly, trachea, a little above its bifurcation,' ceso- phagus, thoracic duct, left recurrent laryngeal and sym- pathetic nerves, vertebral column, and longi colli- superiorly, arteria innominata, left carotid, and subcla- vian; and mferiorly, recurrent laryngeal, ductus arte- riosus, right pulmonary artery, left bronchial tube, left auricle, bronciiial glands, and cardiac plexus, which is l.kewise slightly posterior to it, and these may be said to Jie in the arch. Relations of Descending Portion.—Knt^x\or\Y consti tuents of the root of left lung; posteriorly.

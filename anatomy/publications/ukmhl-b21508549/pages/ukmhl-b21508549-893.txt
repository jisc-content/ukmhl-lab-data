VENOUS SYSTEM. 883 binds them down and preserves their relations, and the peritoneum covers their entire length. Common Iliac Veins are two in number,—right and left, commencing opposite the sacro-iliac symphisis, the right on the posterior and external side of its corre- sponding artery. At the upper third of the body of the fifth lumbar vertebra it unites with the left iliac to form the inferior cava, whilst the left, formed on the internal side of its corresponding artery, crosses the body of the fifth lumbar vertebra, anterior vaginal liga- ment, and middle sacral artery, covered by the perito- neum, commencement of the rectum, ureter, and near its termination by the right common iliac artery, behind which it runs to join the cava. The common iliacs do not, as a general rule, receive collateral branches, with the exception of the middle sacral vein, which opens into the left, but we have seen the ilio-lumbar veins terminating in them on both sides. Inferior Cava is formed by the confluence of the common iliac veins on the right side and upper third of the body of the fifth lumbar vertebra, and ascends at first vertically, but having reached a point correspond- ing to the third lumbar vertebra, it curves a little to- wards the right side, entering a groove in the posterior edge of the liver, then, passing through the caval open- ing in the diaphragm, it enters the pericardium, and, turning towards the mesian line, terminates in the pos- terior and inferior angle of the right auricle. Relative Anatomy.—It lies on vertebrte, intervertebral substance, anterior vaginal ligament, and when dis- tended on the anterior margin of the psoas and sympa- thetic nerve, right renal artery, crus of diaphragm, and right phrenic artery. It is covered by the right com- mon iliac artery, right spermatic, mesentery, and small intestines, inferior transverse portion of the duodenum, head of pancreas, vena porta?, superior transverse por- tion of duodenum, and the lobulus dexter of the liver; it is a little constricted as it passes through the quadri- lateral tendinous diaphragmatic opening, but on enter- ing the pericardium it again enlarges and diminishes as it enters the auricle (see Anatomy of Diaphragm). In its course it receives the lumbar, right spermatic, renal,

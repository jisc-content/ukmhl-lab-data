CEREBRAL NERVES. QQg those which ought to have arisen from the ganglion _ the branches being an inferior or palatine, an internal or nasal, and a posterior or Vidian. The Palatine Nerves are three in number, namely anterior, middle, and posterior. The first, or great pa- latine, descends in the posterior or pterygo-palatine canal, and, emerging on the soft palate inferiorly, passes forwards, dividing into an external and internal branch the former running internal to the alveolar process in a groove as far as the incisive foramen, where it joins Cloquet's ganglion; the latter proceeding on the centre ' of the palate, both being distributed to the mucous ; membrane and palatine glands. During the course of J the trunk through the posterior palatine canal, it sends I branches forwards through the bone (long nasal) to ra- i mify on the pituitary membrane covering the middle and ithe inferior spongy bones; also several small twigs that i pierce the inner wall of the maxillary sinus, and supnlv ; the molar teeth. -^^ ^ Middle Palatine BRANCH.—Smaller than the last- descends through a special canal in the pterygoid pro- cess of the palate bone, and, emerging inferiorly is dis- ttnbuted on the nasal surface of the soft palate. ' PosteriorPalatine Branch.—An exceedingly slen- ■:der twig, often absent; pierces the pterygoid process of tthe palate bone by a small foramen, and is lost in the -solt palate and uvula. Nasal, or Spheno-palatine, arises from the inter- nnal surface of Meckel's ganglion, and consists of two branches an external and internal, both passing into the aose by the spheno-palatine foramen; the former, on en- :tering the cavity, runs along the superior meatus and -spongy bone, supplymg the pituitary membrane of these : oarts and sometimes giving off a pharyngeal branch >which descends to the superior part of the pharynx - the aatter, or internal, sometimes called the naso-palatine or laerve of Cotunnius, passes inwards, crossing the inferior imd anterior part of the side of the body of the sphenoid 'Wne, reaches the septum, and runs downwards, forwards >:^nd inwards, enters the anterior palatine canal, and joins !he superior part of Cloquet's ganglion, the anterior ^'aiatine being connected with its inferior extremity

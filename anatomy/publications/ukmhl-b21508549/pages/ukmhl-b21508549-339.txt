MUSCLES OF THE SHOULDER. 329 united by tendinous septa, that form the terminal tendon by their confluence. Relations.—It is covered by the origin of the platysma, a thin layer of fascia derived from the infraspinous apo- neurosis ; also by the supra-acromial branches of the cer- vical plexus, and the circumflex cutaneous, which pierces the posterior fibres; the posterior edge is longer than the anterior, overlapping the infraspinatous muscle; the anterior, shorter and thicker, corresponds to the great pectoral, which it sometimes overlaps; between them the cephalic vein and the humeral thoracic artery, &c.,_ are seen. It conceals and covers the acromion, clavicle, coracoid process, deltoid ligament, origins of biceps, co- raco-brachialis, insertion of lesser pectoral, capsular liga- ment, and insertion of external capsular muscles, the two anterior thirds of the infraspinatous, teres minor and major, or triangular and quadrilateral space, and the parts passing through them; the circumflex arteries, veins, and nerve, long and outer head of the triceps, a large biirsa, and a layer of fascia, separate its deep sur- face from the shoulder-joint; the insertion is embraced by the origins of the brachialis anticus; the anterior edge of the tendon is separated from the pectoral by a bursa. Action.—When the arm lies at the side, the action of the muscle would press it more firmly to the glenoid ca- vity ; the anterior fibres draw it forwards, the posterior backwards, and if the arm be slightly raised it will con- tinue the elevation until the humerus is on a line with the acromion. The integrity of this muscle is essential to the security of the joint, a fact proved by the effect of paralysis consequent on stretching or laceration of the circumflex nerve, when the head of the humerus de- scends to sometimes within an inch from the glenoid ca- vity. It also makes tense the brachial aponeurosis. The ScAPtTLAR Muscles are five in number:—supra and infraspinatous, subscapularis, teres major andminor. SuPRASPiNATua is covered by a layer of fascia, which, with a quantity of fat that varies in amount, separates it from the trapezius. This fascia is attached behind to the base, below to the spine, above to the superior costa of the scapula, and in front it follows the tendon

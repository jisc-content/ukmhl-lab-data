BRANCHES OF CAROTID. 7g3 Posterior Meningeal.—Always given off in the first stage; it passes upwards through the posterior lacerated ho e and ramifies in the occipital fossa, anastomosing with the posterior branch of the middle menino-eal ° Princeps CoLLi._This is generally a large%ranch which arises from the occipital in its third sta^e and passes downwards and inwards, between the con^piexus and semispinalis colli, to anastomose with the cervicalis profunda of the subclavian. Remarks.—HhQ occipital artery is usually very re<^u- ^.'^^^^i^^^lly it exhibits some vana- tlons Ihus It sometimes runs completely through the parotid gland, and again may be half-an-inch below t In its third stage it generally divides into two branches' —one of which passes superficial to, and the other deeper than, the occipital attachment of the splenius: the latter is accompanied by the great occipital nerve, which lies internal to it. ^ Anomalies.-lt may arise by a common trunk with either the muscular or posterior auricular, or as a branch of the internal carotid, or it maybe the continuation of the cervicahs ascendens. In more than one instance we have observed it running superficial to all the muscles which in Its regular condition overlap it, and lyinS mediately beneath the skin and fascia; but there ce^ tainly was a small delicate twig pursuing the course" which It ought to have followed in its nornal state _ Posterior Auricular arises a little above the'last an the substance of the parotid gland, and passes up awards, backwards and outwards, to terminate in the .integument behind the ear, anastomosing with the oc '-'Cipital and temporal. ^ i?.fo^.o«..-Externally, digastric muscle, portio dura ^process of the parotid gland; internally, parotid gland ^spmal accessory nerve, and mastoid process MUSCULAR.—A few twigs to the digastric, sterno- mastoid, and splenius. ' "''^^^O' Stylo-mastoid-Small, but very constant; it runs ackwards directly on the inner border of the portio Hura, enters the stylo-mastoid hole, and, followin^. th^ cortuous course of the aqueduct of Fallopius, meetsliJh 2 M

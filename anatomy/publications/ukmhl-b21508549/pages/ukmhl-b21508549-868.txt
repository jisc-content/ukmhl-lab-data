858 ARTERIES AND VEINS. Hunter's canal, several muscular, from its inner side, and anastomotica magna. Superficial Pudic—Usually small; arising from the femoral about three-quarters of an inch below Pou- part's ligament; it passes at first directly inwards for a short distance, and divides into two branches,—-a superficial, which pierces the pubic portion of the fascia lata, and then runs upwards and inwards between the layers of the superficial fascia to the front of the sym- physis pubis, supplying that region, and anastomosing with its fellow of the opposite side and a deep branch, which continues beneath the fascia lata, as far as the side of the scrotum, where it becomes cutaneous, sup- plying it, and anastomosing with the perineal division of the deep pudic. Superficial Circumflex Ilii.—Also small; it arises from the external side of the femoral, nearly at the same point with the preceding; it perforates the iliac portion of the fascia lata, sometimes the cribriform, and runs upwards and outwards, parallel but inferior to Poupart s ligament, to the anterior superior spine of the liium, where it communicates with the internal circumflex, ilio-lumbar, and glutseal. Superficial Epigastric—Larger than either ot tiie two preceding; it perforates the cribriform process ot the fascia lata, and, running upwards and inwards over Poupart's ligament, invested in the layers of the super- ficial fascia, anastomoses at the umbilicus with the deep epigastric and internal mammary. Eemarks.-These three vessels may arise by a com- mon trunk, and they all pierce the sheath ot the te- moral vessels. . n:„„ Profunda.-Always very large; sometimes equali ng in size the femoral, from the outer and back part ot which it arises, and passing at first downwards and outwards, then winding downwards and inwards be neath its parent trunk, ultimately perlorates the ad- ductor minus, opposite the middle third of the thigh, ^Trunnkig outwards and downwards, terminates in Sle biceps, by anastomosing with muscular branches of the poplitajal.

108 THE OSSEOUS SYSTEM. site side; the posterior smooth and concave, and has attached to it the soft palate; the anterior rough for unitingwith the superior maxilla; the external stretches backwards and outwards, and terminates in a pyramidal process,—thepterygoid; its base turned inwards, its apex outwards; on its upper surface it presents three well- marked grooves, the central, forming the greater portion of the posterior palatine canal; the lateral, not so well marked, articulates with the internal and external ptery- goid plates, between which it is firmly wedged. If we now direct our attention to the vertical plate, we will find it to be likewise quadrilateral, but larger and thin- ner than the preceding. It accordingly presents two surfaces,—an internal and external, and four margins,— an inferior, anterior, a posterior, and superior. On the internal surface we observe two horizontal ridges and two grooves; the inferior ridge is the best marked, and supports the posterior extremity of the inferior spongy bone; the superior is only visibletowards the anterior part for the middle spongy to rest on. The grooves are concave from above downwards, and extremely smooth, corres- ponding to the inferior and middle meatuses of the nose. The external surface is convex, and also smooth, forming the internal boundary of one of the most important fossae at the base of the cranium,—the spheno-maxillary, con- taining the superior maxillary nerve, Meckel's ganglion, and internal maxillary artery. Of its four margins the inferior becomes continuous with the horizontal plate nearly at a right angle; its anterior is very thin, arti- culates below with the superior maxilla, and above with the OS planum of ethmoid; the posterior is grooved for the palatine canal, and unites with the pterygoid plates; the superior is remarkable for being surmounted by two processes,—one anterior, and much more ele- vated than the other,—the orbital; the other, posterior, thin and sharp,—the sphenoidal; a deep notch, forming two-thirds of a circle, divides them from each other, and across this the body of the sphenoid is thrown, convert- ing it into a foramen for the passage of the spheno-pa- latine nerves and arteries; the anterior or orbital pro- cess is of a conical figure, and presents two non-articular facettes,—one external, corresponding to the spheno-

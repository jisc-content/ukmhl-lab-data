473 MUSCLES OF THE LEG. taining fat, but usually laminated and mucli weaker on the dorsum of the foot than on the leg. The following parts also are seen:—Internal saphenous vein and nerve; also the musculo-cutaneous. The internal saphenous vein commences from an arch on the dorsum of the foot, situated over the proximal extremities of the metatar- sal bones, receiving in front cutaneous branches from the toes, and by the internal and external extremity giving origin to the saphenous trunks; the vein then ascends in front of the internal malleolus, and on the in- ner side of the leg over the internal edge of the gastroc- nemius ; then passes between the tendons of the gracilis and sartorius muscles, and commences its femoral stage, lying in its whole extent in the structure of the super- ficial fascia. Internal saphenous nerve, a branch of the anterior crural, accompanies the femoral artery in the thigh, pierces the tendon of the adductor magnus, and, passing beneath the saphena vein, between the tendons before mentioned, it reaches the leg; then winding to the anterior part of the vein, follows its course, and ter- minates on the inner side of the dorsum of the foot. Musculo-cutaneous nerve, a branch of the peroneal, de- scends between the peroneus longus and extensor digi- ' torum communis; below the middle of the leg it be- comes superficial, and divides into internal and external tarsal branches, that are distributed—the external to the three outer toes, and the internal to the two inner (see Anatomy of Nerves). When the superficial fas^ cia is removed, the proper investment of the anterior surface of the leg is exposed, and with this may be de- scribed the whole fascial envelope, as it surrounds the limb, and includes three sheaths,_an anterior, external, and posterior, producing a corresponding arrangement of the muscles; the superior circumference is attached anteriorly to the head of the tibia, fibula, and tendon of biceps; posteriorly being continuous with the fascia lata, and strengthened by expansions from the gracilis, sartorius, semitendinosus, and biceps; the inferior cir- cumference is attached to the annular ligaments; ante- riorly the fascia is strong, the fibres interlacing at acute angles, and attached to the spine of the tibia its whole length; but posteriorly it is much weaker, the direc- '

240 THE MUSCULAR SYSTEM. above the incisor teeth; it passes downwards and for- wards to be inserted into the deep surface of the qua- dratus menti. Relations.—It lies on the bone, and is covered by the quadratus and mucous membrane; its insertion assists in forming the prominence of the chin. Action.—To raise and project forward the lower lip. Buccinator is seen by removing the zygomatics, and a quantity of fat that lies beneath the ramus of the jaw; it is irregularly quadrilateral, consisting of a flat plane of fibres, arising from the external side of the three posterior alveoli of the upper jaw, as far as the tuber, and from an oblique line on the outer side of the ramus of the inferior maxilla, corresponding to the two last molar teeth; and in the interval between these from a strong aponeurosis,—the pterygo-maxillary li- gament, or bucco-pharyngeal aponeurosis, extending from the point of the external pterygoid plate, and inserted into the inner side of the root of the coro- noid process, where it joins the mylohyoid ridge; this ligament gives origin by its anterior edge to the buc- cinator, and by its posterior to the superior constric- tor of the pharynx; from these attachments the mus- cle passes forwards, the inferior fibres ascending, the superior descending, the middle passing horizontally; the superior become continuous with the upper segment of the orbicularis oris; and the superior with the lower; ■whilst the middle are inserted into the angle of the mouth; thus there is a decussation of the superior and inferior fibres, but not of the middle. Relations.—It is covered by skin, fat that separates it from the ramus of the jaw, insertion of the temporal, and the anterior edge of the masseter muscle; it is also covered by the levator and depressor anguli ori's, zygo- maticus major and minor, and the musculus risorius, the facial artery and vein, traiT^verse facial artery, buccal branches of the portio dura, and Steno's duct, by which it is pierced in its posterior and superior third or ancrle. It lies on the mucous membrane and buccal ^^^Adion.—'To draw backwards the angle of the mouth, and thus oppose the orbicularis oris. When the cheeks

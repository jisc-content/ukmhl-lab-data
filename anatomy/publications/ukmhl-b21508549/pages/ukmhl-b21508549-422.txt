THE MUSCULAR SYSTEM. 412 the penis the vein lies in the centre, the arteries exter- nal to the vein and the nerve again external to the artery from without inwards, the order being—nerve, artery, vein. The dorsal vein commences by a circular plexus, which is situated at the corona, communicating with the superficial veins, and also by numerous branches which pass through the fibrous covering of the crus with the deep veins; it then passes beneath the sub- pubic and above the triangular ligament, which mvests it in a fibrous tubule, afterwards between the anterior true ligaments of the bladder, divides into two branches, which run backwards and downwards, to terminate in the prostato-vesical plexus. Sometimes, but rarely, there are two veins on the dorsum. Dorsal Arteet.—This vessel is seen ascending be- tween the crus penis and pubis to reach its upper sur- face- its origin cannot be seen until the crus is raised from' the bone, when it is observed to arise, in common with the artery of the crus, from the pudic whilst it lies on the bone; it passes forwards beneath the suspen- sory ligament, and, reaching the corona, forms a plexi- form circle surrounding it, also sending branches to the prepuce. (For peculiarities see Vascular System.) Dorsal Nerve.—A branch of the pudic; pierces the triangular ligament, winds round the crus, and passing forward, external to the artery, it sends cutaneous branches downwards on the side of the penis, a large number to the prepuce, while those to the glans are lar!?e, flat, and terminating in loops like the nerves con- nected with the sense of touch at the extremities ot the fingers. ^ „ , Crura, or Corpora Cavernosa Penis.—Each crus consists of a fibrous cylinder, containing a mass of vas- cular texture, narrow and pointed behmd, truncated anteriorly; it arises from the anterior edge of the tuber and ascending ramus of the ischium, also from the de- scending ramus of the pubis; it passes upwards and in- wards, immediately beneath the symphisis, where they approximate and unite; and at the corona they are cut off from above and behind, downwards, and forwards, to support the glans, the fibrous tunic being continued between them.

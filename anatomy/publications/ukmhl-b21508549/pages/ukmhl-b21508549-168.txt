158 THE ANATOMY OF THE JOINTS Posterior Occipito-atloid Ligament. — This is brought into view by removing all the muscles from the back part of the neck till we reach the oblique and recti; by now separating these from the occipital bone, and re- moving thefat,we will observe the ligament, much weaker in its character than the preceding, but more extensive; it takes its origin from the posterior edge of the foramen magnum, as far forwards as the condyle, and is inserted into the upper surface of the posterior half-arch of the atlas; it is perforated by two foramina, one large, for the vertebral artery, the other small, for the suboccipital nerve, and it corresponds by its anterior surface to the dura mater of the cord, and by its posterior to the supe- rior oblique and recti muscles, and vertebral artery, which rests on it for a short distance. Lateral Occipito-Atlantoid Ligament—These are exposed by removing all the soft parts immediately over the transverse process of the atlas, and then detaching the rectus capitis lateralis from the occipital bone, and reflecting it outwards, when the ligament, never well- marked, consisting only of a few scattered fibres, and extremely short, will be brought into view, arising from the jugular ridge, and inserted into the root of the transverse process of the atlas; externally it is covered by the rectus lateralis; internally it corresponds to the articulation between the atlas and occipital bone; anteriorly it assists in completing the fibrous canal, which contains the internal carotid and jugular vein, and the eighth, ninth, and sympathetic nerves. Capsular Ligaments.—These consist of a series of fibres, the majority passing nearly vertically down- wards, but interlaced by others, running in an oblique direction from the edge of the condyle above to the at- lantoid articulating depression below; externally and anteriorly they are exceedingly strong; but internally and posteriorly they are very weak and indistinct, afford- ing rather a protection to the synovial membrane than any security to the joint itself. We have already alluded to the extreme size and laxity of the synovial membrane, which is reflected downwards in loose folds, on the edges of the articulation.

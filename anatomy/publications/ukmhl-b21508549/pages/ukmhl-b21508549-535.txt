HEART. Ventricular Fibres—These consist of a double set like those of the auricles. When the serous layer of the pericardium is removed from the ventricles the most superficial common fibres are observed descending from the auricular zones downwards, forwards, and to°wards the apex, or from right to left on the anterior surface, and on the posterior part running obliquely from left to right, in order to reach the apex. In this situation we observe an anterior and posterior band which wind around each other, producing a stellate disposition at the apex, where they dip into the interior of the ven- tricles to form the inner wall of these cavities, and ascending to be attached to the deep surface and inner edge of the tendinous zones. Thus the superficial sur- face of each ventricular wall, and also the deep, are con- stituted of common fibres, in the interval between them the proper being situated; these latter consist of a mus- cular sac for each ventricle of a conical shape, the base attached superiorly to the auricular zones, the apex in- teriorly presenting a small aperture, through which the common fibres gain access to the internal cavities _ Three layers of muscular fibres have been described m the right ventricle, six in the left; but instead of tracing these individually it will simplify the subiect in some degree to state, that on the external surface of the ventricles common fibres, or, more correctly speak- ing, bands, assume three forms,—the first passing ob- liquely from apex to base, the second surroundin^oth ventricles, and the third describing a double circle in- vesting each cavity, and preserving their continuity !dmi"t^f tV'P'r n ^^""^ fibres afs^ admit of a three-fold arrangement.

ARTERIES AND VEINS. 846 the urethra; while the third is derived from the oblite- rated itmbilical, its twigs being distributed to its supe- rior fundus; other branches are occasionally given off to this organ from the obturator, pudic, and sciatic. Lateral Sacral.—Variable in size; it arises from the back part of the internal iliac, and passes downwards and inwards over the origins of the pyriformis and points of emergence of the sacral nerves, and, reachmg the coccyx, anastomoses by reversed arches with the middle sacral, from which it is separated in its course down- wards by the sympathetic nerve. This vessel as it de- scends throws off branches, which, entering by the anterior sacral foramina, again emerge after supplymg the Cauda equina through the posterior, and on the back of the sacrum anastomoses with the superficial branches of the glutseal. Umbilical.—This is usually known as the oblite- rated hypogastric, but, as already observed it always continues patulous to the upper fundus of the bladder, constituting the superior vesical artery; at this pomt a small twig is always detached from it (deferential branch of Sir A. Cooper), which accompanies the vas deferens as far as the epididymis, there anastomosmg with the spermatic and cremasteric arteries. _ Uterine arises in common with the inferior vesical from the termination of the internal iliac, passes for- wards to the neck of the uterus, and, ascendmg a ong its sides, divides into anterior and posterior branches for the front and back of this organ, which can be traced as high as its fundus, and which become remarkably large and tortuous during pregnancy. . Vaginal arises sometimes with the last, and some- times anterior to it; passing forwards along the sides o the vagina, it divides into a series of branches w ich supply its vails and the neck of the bladder, while hey Sinate in anastomosing freely with each other; they ir^^Z ba^: part of the internal iliac aW^^^^^^^^ an-inch before its termination, and, PP^^^S and backwards to the upper edge ol S f;^^^^'^];^ notch, leaves the pelvis through that aperture, and di-

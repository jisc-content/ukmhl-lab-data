142 THE 0S8E0DS SYSTEM. galli, on each side of which are the slits for the trans- mission of the nasal twig of the ophthalmic; more ex- ternally and posteriorly the double row of holes for the passage of the branches of the olfactory bulb; at its verge the orifice for the entrance of the nasal nerve from the anterior ethmoidal foramen; more posteriorly the line of suture between the ethmoid and sphenoid, with a slight elevation in the centre corresponding to the spine of the latter, with a depression at each side, on which the olfactory nerves recline. The lateral por- tions, consisting of the frontal and lesser wing of the sphenoid, present a most irregular appearance, the mam- millary eminences and digital depressions being nume- * rous and well marked; and this is the more striking from the same part of the bones on their inferior aspect, where they form the roof of the orbit, being remark- able for their smoothness and regularity. The anterior fossa just described supports the anterior lobe of the cerebrum. The middle fossa of the cranium lies on a plane, posterior and inferior to the last described,â€” bounded in front by the lesser wings of the sphenoid and anterior lip of the olivary process; behind by the upper margins of the petrous portions of the temporal bones, and posterior clinoid processes; externally by parts ^f" the great wing of the sphenoid-parietal and squamous plate of temporal. Its floor is formed by the body and great wing of the sphenoid and petrous portion of the temporal, and is very concave. Like the preceding, it may be divided into a central or sphenoidal, and two lateral regions. The central portion presents anteriorly the groove of the olivary process, terminating on either side in the optic foramina for the passage of the optic nerve and artery, behind which are the two anterior clinoid processes; still more posteriorly, the sella tur- cica for the reception of the pituitary gland and cir- cular sinus; this deep recess being bounded behind by the prominence of the posterior clinoid processes. The lateral regions are perforated anteriorly by the sphe- noidal fissure for the transmission of the nerves into the orbit; behind this is a slight depression corresponding to the cavernous sinus; more posteriorly, the opening of the anterior lacerated foramen; external, and a little

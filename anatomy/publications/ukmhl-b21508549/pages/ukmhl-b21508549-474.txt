464 THE MUSCULAK SYSTEM. part of tlie bodies of the four superior lumbar vertebra, also from the intervertebral substance and the anterior vaginal ligament; the left, which is more posterior, arises from the sides of the bodies of the three superior lumbar vertebree and vertebral ligaments; these tendons are united superiorly to form an arch, bounding the aortic opening, and to their posterior, superior, and external edge the fleshy crura are attached; the fibres radiate, and, passing upwards and forwards, are inserted into the notched or posterior edge of the cordiform tendon; from the summit of the arch, and deep surface of the tendon, two fleshy muscular bands arise, the right being most anterior and crossing the left; these are the de- cussating fibres of the crura, which are continued up- wards and forwards, to be inserted into the inferior surface of the central tendon, near the posterior edge; the angle of decussation being immediately behind the oesophageal, and in front of the aortic opening, and therefore separating those orifices. It has been stated that the right fasciculus was anterior at the pomt of decussation, but at the insertion the position is altered, the left being at the right and anterior segment of the oesophageal opening, and the right band at the left and posterior edge. t i. Relative Anatomy.—Th^ openings m the diaphragm are, first, single,—aortic, oesophageal and caval; the sym- metrical are two triangular spaces, behind the ensiiorm cartilage; and two for the splanchnic nerves, —greater and lesser. Let these now be examined in detail. The aortic opening, or, more critically speaking, canal, corresponds to the eleventh and twelfth dorsal and upper margin of the first lumbrar vertebra, is about one inch and a half in length, infundibuliform in shape, large, wide, and fleshy on the thoracic aspect, constricted and tendi- nous on the abdominal, the latter not being defined, the fibrous arch sending a prolongation downwards on the aorta and ca^liac axis; the canal is bounded anteri- orly by the aortic arch and decussating fasciculi, posteri- orly by the bodies of the vertebrae, anterior common liga- ment of the spine, and also by the origins of the left crus; and laterally by the crura. The aorta passes through its centre, having, on the right side, vena azygos and tho-

337 MUSCLES OF THE ARM. posterior part of the arm, consists of three heads, exter- nal, middle, and internal; the middle or long head arises tendinous from the inferior costa and neck of the scapula; it is also prolonged on the inferior surface of the capsular ligament; it then becomes fleshy, first on its posterior surface, descending between the teres major and minor muscles, on the back of the humerus, but not attached to it; the external head arises narrow and tendi- nous from a ridge terminating the great tuberosity, below the insertion of the teres minor; it continues to arise from the outer side of the bone and external condyloid rido-e, from the external intermuscular septum and external condyle, the fibres ascending from this last point; the internal head arises somewhat tendinous, but narrow, from the inner side of the humerus, commencing below the insertion of the teres major; it continues to adhere to; the bone, and internal condyloid ridge, and to the inner condyle; at the junction of the upper and middle thirds of the arm, the three portions unite, and about three inches above the olecranon they end in a triangular flat tendon, which first gives off a superficial expansion continuous with the fascia of the fore-arm, and then is inserted into the summit of the olecranon process. Relationsâ€”The long head has in front the teres ma- jor, and behind the teres minor, further concealed by the deltoid; it is separated from the humerus, first by the posterior circumflex artery and nerve; then by the musculo-spiral nerve and superior profunda artery and the posterior ligament of the elbow-joint; at the posterior edge of the scapular portion, the circumflexus scapulae artery escapes from the axilla; in the rest of Its extent the posterior surface is superficial Exter- nal head is covered in its upper third by the deltoid posteriorly, and externally it is superficial; anteriorly : and internally it is related to the long head and the bone, external intermuscular septum, the musculo-spiral I nerve and artery, which pierce it, the extensor carpi iradiahs longior, and supinator longus. Internal head ns related externally to the bone and long head, the t brachial and inferior profunda arteries, the ulnar nerve ! the coraco-brachialis, intermuscular septum, and bra- ^chiahs anticus; a bursa separates the fascia from the Q

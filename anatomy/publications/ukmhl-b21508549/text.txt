But whilst we disclaim being actuated by the mere desire of producing a book, we must admit our belief that the existing class-books might be made more consistent with the wants of the student and profession generally; and with this view a systematic description has been adopted; whilst the discursive style, although more facile of execution, and certainly more beautiful, has been rigidly avoided,—thus allowing a greater amount of anatomical information to be condensed into this, than into any other work of a similar mag- nitude. The relative anatomy of organs and parts has been also carried out minutely, together withjy PREFACE. their functions and structure, the descriptions being in conformity with the most recent discoveries on each subject, verified by our own observation and researches. The remarks on the Arteries and Veins have been confined to their practical anatomy only, as the volumes of Power, Harrison,and Corbett, ren- der any further observations on the surgical relations of those vessels quite superfluous. 21, York-street, Dublin, Octoher, 1852.CONTENTS.

The term skeleton is applied to those denser elements of the animal tissues that, when combined as immove- able plates or jointed segments, constitute solid shields for the protection of the softer structures, or subserve to the active movements of animals, by supplying the passive organs for attachment of the muscular system. In all the invertebrate class, with the exception of the ce- phalopoda, the skeleton is found external to the muscles (exo-skeleton); but although many of the vertebrate class retain certain portions of the external skeleton in various grades of development, still its gradual extinc- tion is perceptible in proportion as increasing perfec- tion and symmetry prevail in the internal (endo-ske- leton). In many classes this perfection may be evi- denced only in reference to particular functions, sym- metry may be sacrificed to those arrangements confer- ring strength and solidity, or these again may yield to the mechanical requirements conducing to rapidity of motion, combined with excessive lightness. But whilst a continual change of the centres of increased develop- ment IS observed in the lower orders of vertebrata, producing physical characters in unison with the habits and necessities of the animal, the human skeleton exhi- bits a persistent form not constituted for the predo- BTHE OSSEOUS SYSTEM. minance of any one function, but equally calculated to promo e the perfect series of actions which, by harxnom.

In the adult period these present a certain proportion in relation to each other, producing the greatest amount of density and strength; but these relations are subject to changes, depending principally on the period of life, totally inde- pendent of any diseased condition of the system. During infancy the animal matter preponderates, whilst in advanced life the salts are in excess. On this account elasticity is as remarkable a physical character of the former as brittleness and a consequent liability to fracture of the latter period. The following are the proportions at different periods of life, from Schre- ger:- CHILD. ADULT. OLD AGE.

When the fluid is removed and allowed to cool, it solidifies, forming a transparent jelly. This may again be liquefied by heat, and from a dilute solution the animal matter may be precipitated by tannic acid, as tannate of gelatine. The insoluble organic matter con- sists of the fibrine and albumen, yielded by the coats of the blood-vessels and any small remains of blood they may contain.

To these we will apply the term secondary laminfe. In their structure may also be observed a second series of dark points, the osseous lacunse or corpuscles, some- times called calcigerous cells. In the human bone they are semilunar, with the concavity turned towards the Haversian canal, of which they are the satellites. Inter- nally they communicate with the Haversian canal by fine pores or transverse canaliculi, and externally with those of the proximate lamina. Neither lacunae nor canaliculi are visible in the bone tissue of the intertu- bular spaces. A longitudinal section represents the canals passing parallel with the axis of the shaft, and frequently communicating with each other. The true figure of the lacunae may also now be determined, being that of menisci. The Haversian canals have an average diameter of of an inch; the canaliculi, -j-^oo-; and the lacunse, in their vertical diameter, an average of TsTTu-) usually half as wide, and one-third as thick (Todd and Bowman). The external surface of the bone is surrounded by laminse proper to its entire thickness; these are from seven to ten in number, and can be well observed in a section which has been macerated in acid. These may be called primary laminse, to distinguish them from those of the Haversian system; they consti- tute the periosteal layer, that again passes insensibly into the mediate structure. The pores of the most superficial lacunse open on the periosteal surface, and those of the most deep on the medullary, an arrange- ment that might be anticipated in consequence of the con- tinuity of all the elements of its anatomical composition. The ultimate structure of the laminse is difiicult to determine. With a high power of about 650, the sur- face seems granular, according to Dr. Sharpey, with small lozenge-shaped spaces, formed by the crossing of minute fibres. We have observed these spaces and the so-called fibres well marked in the lachrymal bone, pre- pared on one side only so as to be transparent under a high power, particularly when the light was reflected obliquely. Mr. Tomes conceives the ultimate structure to be formed by minute granules, oval, oblong, or an- gular, imbedded in a tissue with characters not yet definite.

Gra- dually the appearance of dark points indicates the for- mation of nuclei and cell-walls; this constitutes the second or cartilaginous stage. The cartilaginous cells now exhibit a disposition to arrange themselves in columns, with a further tendency to form groups. At the same time the cells are flattened on their opposed sides, the nuclei enlarge and sometimes divide. In the centre of the shaft of a long bone an opaque, trans- versely oval mass appears; from its upper and lower sur- faces lamince of a similar nature grow into the intercellu- lar spaces; these send their transverse laminte across the groups thus enclosing them in perfect cells, elongated in the axis of the bone. These laminas are distinctly fibrous. This we consider as the third or fibrocellular stage. As the elongation of the laminaj continues, the hyaline is being absorbed, but the cartilage cells increase in number. Within the cells of the laminas they are also altered; highly refracting points appear within them, signifying the presence of fatty matter; these enlarge, and, coincident with this increase, the cells attach themselves to the laminar wall of the cancellus which contains them. The fluid of the latter cavity becomes fatty, granular, and of a reddish colour, deve- loping the elements for the endogenous growth of new lamina?, imbedding, of necessity, the cartilage cells, which after some time disappear, but the nuclei remain to form the osseous lacunae. The absorption of the trans- verse septa converts the cell-spaces into canals (Haver- sian), and the radiate prolongations of the nuclei deve- lope the canaliculi, but these nuclei are not persistent; a coarse earthy material is substituted that occupies the lacunae in fully developed bone. This is the fourth or ossific stage, in which the assumption of the several cal- careous salts obliterates all fibrous arrangement. Ossi- fication commences in the long bones by three centres, one for the shaft, and one for each extremity. These gradually extend towards each other, encroaching on the mass of cartilage intervening. The extreme points are called epiphyses, the shaft or centre the diaphysis.8 THE OSSEOUS SYSTEM. It is in the space -between them that elongation as to gr lth occurs, wMlst the already ossified portxcn^^^^^^ mains unaltered. At a period ranging from the twenty- Tst to the twenty-fourfh year, ossification is completed, and any further increase of length precluded.

The true spine consists of twenty-four distinct pieces, firmly united together by cartilage, ligament, and di- rect articulation; but as the several bones which com- pose the whole differ from one another in many essential particulars, it has been divided into three regions: the cervical above embracing the first seven; the dorsal in the middle, comprehending the twelve succeeding; and the lumbar below, consisting of the last five. The ver- tebree, however, possess some general features which may be said to be common to the whole, as, for example, each presents for consideration a body forming the en- tire of the anterior part of the bone, and a series of pro- cesses, nine in number, constituting its posterior por- tion. These processes are known by the following names: two pedicles, springing from the posterior and lateral parts of the body, and connecting it to the oblique and transverse processes; they are short, strong, and rounded, presenting a shallow groove above, a deep notch below. These, by the articulation of two cor- responding vertebras, are converted into irregular holes, the foramina of conjugation, for the transmission of the nerves from the spinal marrow, and for the entrance of arteries and veins, the one to supply the structures within the canal, the other to establish a communica- tion between the general venous system and the Eachi- dian vessels. From the posterior extremity of those pedicles the transverse processes jut out laterally. They are about an inch in length, and present various pecu- liarities which will be more particularly noticed in the description of the several regions. The articular or oblique processes are situated above and below the root of the transverse; they are covered with cartilage of incrustation, and interlock with those of the vertebraj above and below. Springing from the roots of the trans- verse and articular processes are the lamina, broad plates of bone, taking a direction backwards and inwards, con- verging to form the spinous process, the last in our enumeration. Lumbar Region—A vertebra in this region has the following peculiarities:—Its body is of an oval shape b3IQ THE OSSEOUS SYSTEM. being rather longer from side to side than from before backwards; its W-ior.and inferior surfac^^^^^^^^^^ cave and rough, and are intimately united to the inter ::;iLalcarlliinousdiscs,.hich connect^^ below to the corresponding vertebra.

The superior are con- cave from side to side, straight from above downwards, and look inwards and backwards, while the inferior are exactly the reverse, being convex from side to side, and look forwards and outwards. They are covered with car- tilage, and lock closely with the facettes of the adjoin- ing bone, where they are kept in position by a tense capsular ligament. The laminae in this region are broad and strong, stretching obliquely downwards and back- wards, diverging anteriorly where they become conti- nuous with the roots of the oblique and transverse pro- cesses, converging posteriorly where they unite to form the spine; their upper and lower margins connected to the corresponding vertebrse by elastic tissue, called the ligamenta subflava. The spinous process is thick and wedge-shaped, thin superiorly, broad inferiorly, blunted at its extremity, where it is bordered by a thick crest of bone. It stands out nearly horizontally, and gives attachment to the inter and supraspinous ligaments, lumbar aponeurosis, and extensors of the spine. The canal in this region is triangular in shape, and large, owing to the amount of mobility which this part enjoys. It is bounded in front by the back part of the body; on each side by the pedicles, roots of the transverse and oblique processes; and behind by the la- mina, converging to form the spine. The fifth or last lumbar vertebra differs from the others in the following particulars. It is cut off obliquely on its inferior surface, so that its vertical depth in front far exceeds its similar measurement posteriorly. The same rule prevails with respect to the intervertebral disc between it and the sacrum, and this produces that re- markable appearance at the junction of those bones known as the promontory of the sacrum or sacro-verte- bral angle. Dorsal Region—The dorsal vertebrae, taken as a whole, are much smaller than the lumbar, and dif- fer from them in several important particulars. The body is more circular, and shorter in its vertical mea- surement before than behind. On its sides posteriorly, at the upper and lower margins, two small facettes are visible, the superior being a little larger than the infe-J 2 THE OSSEOUS SYSTEM. rior- they are covered with cartilage and articulate S corrLponding facettes on tbe beads of the nb^^^ The pedicles are not so strong as those m the lumbar re4n while the transverse processes which pass more ubl qu'ely backwards and outwards possess far greater rior look backwards and sl.ghtly ^'t.S dorsal -f-P-^rrS " "Ja^?S:;ro';ei*er sides of at once distinguished from each ot^er by u r.^fw^^rei^^^^^^^^ the first, whilst It s below ^..^g^erse process, has also an articulating "^^^ifti, i^^s but a single which the latter has not.

Between the two is situated a small round foramen, which transmits the vertebral artery, veins, and a plexus of nerves from the sub-occipital and inferior cervical ganglion of the sympathetic. The anterior extremity of the transverse processes gives attachment to the lon- gus colli, rectus capitis anticus major, and anterior scalenus; the posterior to the scaleni, medius and pos- ticus, splenius colli, levator anguli scapula; while the intertransverse muscles are attached both anteriorly and posteriorly. The articulating processes are covered with cartilage, round and nearly flat; the superior look backwards and upwards, the inferior forwards and downwards. The lamina are flattened and compara- tively strong, terminating in the spine, which stands out horizontally from the bone, and terminates poste- riorly in a bifid arrangement. They give attachment to the cervical aponeurosis, trapezius, and splenius. The spinal canal is very large and triangular, owing to the great amount of motion that exists in this region. The particular vertebra; that are found in this portion of the column are the first, or atlas; the second, or axis; and the seventh. Of these the last is easily known from its greater size and resemblance to a dorsal. It is remarkable for the great length of its spinous process, which juts out boldly backwards, presents but a single tubercle, and gives attachment to the ligamentum nu- chse and lesser rhomboid. Its transverse processes are also very long, and similar to rudimentary ribs; and when a hole exists in them, it is for the transmission of the vertebral veins only. Atlas—This vertebra, as contrasted with the others, presents a very remarkable appearance, being nothing more than a mere circle of bone, with the lateral masses applied to its sides. It has been divided into two portions, called its anterior and posterior half- arches, the former being much shorter than the latter. Anteriorly it presents a tubercle in the me- sian line, for the insertion of the cord-like process of the occipito-atloid ligament, and external to this It IS concave, for the origin of the rectus capitis anticus minor.

The body is extremely long from above downwards anteriorly, but short in the same direction posteriorly. This is owing to the anterior lip, which is prolonged so as to overlap the vertebra below to some extent. In front the body presents a concave depression on either side, with an intervening ridge; to the first are attached the longi colli muscles, and to the last the commencement of the anterior vagi- nal ligament. The transverse processes are extremely short, and rounded at their extremities; the articulating nearly flat, superiorly large, circular, looking upwards and outwards; the inferior concave, and much smaller, looking downwards and forwards; the lamina are ex- ceedingly thick and strong, terminating in a well-marked triangular spine, which bifurcates posteriorly to give attachment to the recti postici majores, and the obliqui inferiores. Development.—Each vertebra, as a general rule, is developed from three primary points of ossification: one for the anterior part of the spinal canal correspond- ing to the body, and one for each of the laminte. These osseous points are generally visible from the fortieth ta the fiftieth day. The lateral ones spread out gradually, and become united about a year after birth, while they are not connected with that of the body for nearly five. The complementary points are one for the upper, and one for the lower part of the body: thus forming three separate discs, which remain laminated for a lengthened period; one for the extremity of each transverse process; and one for the spine. The union between those comple- mentary points is complete about the twenty-fifth year The atlas is developed from six points of ossification^ VIZ. two for the anterior half-arch, two for the posterior and two for the lateral masses. Those for the posterior part of the body appear about the end of the sixth week, while those for the anterior are not visible for some time after birth.

The two first are very large, while the ttwo last are comparatively small. To the surface of the tboue, between each of the foramina, is attached a fasci- cculus of the pyriformis, and along their edges sweep cdown the lateral sacral arteries, which throw small tbranches into each, to pass out posteriorly, to anasto- tmose with the lumbar and gluteal. Corresponding to iits central portion we observe the middle sacral artery aand rectum. The posterior surface is rough, convex, aand extremely irregular. It presents, in the median nine, a series of elevated tubercles, which gradually di- iiminish in size from above downwards; they are gene- rrally three in number, while the fourth and fifth bifur- ccate, and appear as small prominences, two on either sside of the sacral canal, to which the strong ligament ffor its completion posteriorly is attached. These are aanalogous to the spinous processes of the true vertebrae. .'A little external to these are a second row of tubercles; tthey are very badly marked, and represent the articu- lilar processes. Still more external are the four sacral iforamina for the transmission of the posterior nerves, bbut they are much smaller than those on the anterior sisurface. Passing out still farther, a third series of emi- nnences appear, the type of the transverse processes; tlhey are intermediate in size between the first and se- ccond rows. These several elevations give attachment tito the lumbar fascia, extensors of the spine, glutseus naiaximus, and the powerful sacro-iliac ligaments. The sppmal canal is triangular in shape above, but flattened aand extremely small inferiorly. It is bordered supe- rriorily and laterally by the oblique processes, looking (backwards and inwards, and concave from side to side, l :or articulation with the last lumbar vertebra. The -sacrum articulates with four bones; the ossa innomi- I nata on either side, the spinal column above, and the ccoccyx inferiorly.

Its apex points infe- riorly and anteriorly, and terminates in a small nodule of bone, to which the ano-coccygeal ligament is attached. Its margins are very irregular, and give origin to the sciatic ligaments, and insertion to the posterior fibres of the levatores ani and coccygasus. Its anterior surface is smooth and concave from above downwards, and con- tributes to support the rectum as it descends. Its pos- terior, convex and rough, presents above, on each side of the mesial line, two small demi-tubercles, which are found to be firmly united by bone to corresponding processes on the lower part of the sacrum. These cir- cumscribe a foramen for the transmission of the fifth sacral nerve; to this surface is attached the aponeurosis of the glutseus maximus. Development of the Sacrum.—This bone, taken as a whole, has numerous points of ossification; but as they vary in the several pieces of which it is composed, it may be preferable to examine each separately. The three first are developed exactly as the true vertebrs, viz.: one point for the body, one for each lamina, and one for each lateral mass, making five points in aU. The two last have, however, only three, viz.: one for the body, and one for each lamina; thus constituting twenty- one primitive points in all; but at a later period of life twelve complementary points appear, viz.: two lor the upper and lower parts of the body of each bone, and one for each articulating surface for the ossa innomi- nata, thus increasing the number to thirty-three. Each separate piece of the coccyx is developed from a single point; but the ossific nucleus is much sooner apparent in the sacral than in the coccygeal region, it bemg visi- ble in the former about the third month, and m the latter not until during the first year after birth. Ihe union of the several bones of the sacrum and coccyx may be said to be completed about the twenty-fifth year, but this rule is of course liable to many excep- tions.19 THE SPINE IN GENERAL. THE SPINE IN GENERAL. It will be necessary, before proceeding further, to take a general view of the spinal column, as it appears in the adult human being, as well as the modifications which may be induced in it by age, habit, or disease. When observed on its anterior aspect it presents the appearance of a knotted stick, tapering at either extre- mity, but gradually enlarging a little below its centre, constituting, in fact, two pyramids, with their bases op- posed to each other, at the upper part of the sacrum. However, on a closer examination it will be found that the superior pyramid maybe again subdivided into three smaller ones, depending upon the unequal size of cer- tain vertebrse, presenting too obvious a difierence to be easily overlooked. The last lumbar vertebrae is ex- ceedingly large, while the fourth dorsal is comparatively small; thus the first pyramid is formed with the base below and the apex above. From this point, however, there is a gradual increase in size, as far as the seventh cervical, thus constituting the second, with its apex be- low united to that of the first, and its base above. • The vertebrse again diminish up to the second, which forms the apex of the third cone, its base being opposed to and at the same point as the second. The spinal column, when viewed anteriorly, is by no means perfectly straight, but presents four great curva- tures in its course downwards. These, although differ- ing from each other in the manner in which their direction is concerned, still, however, modify and coun- terbalance each other in their degree of intensity. Thus the convexity is directed forwards in the cervical region, and corresponds to the longus colli and anterior va- ginal ligament, supporting the pharynx, larynx, and upper part of the CBSophagus. In the dorsal region the concavity is directed forwards, is covered almost entirely by the broad common ligaments, supports the pericardium and great vessels, with the several parts contained in the posterior mediastinum. The concavity in this region increases the antero-posterior20 THE OSSEOUS SYSTEM. dimensions of the thorax, thus affording increased space for the organs devoted to the important offices of circu- lation and respiration. The lumbar region presents a well-marked convexity, concealed by the psose and crura of the diaphragm, but appearing prominently below, where it is only covered by its shining ligament, sup- porting on the right side the cava, and on the left the aorta The direction of its convexity has a tendency to throw the abdominal viscera forwards, and cause them to rest on the arch of the pubis. The concavity is forwards in the sacral region, and has resting on it the tectum, pyriformis and sacral plexus. The direction of its curve increases the capacity of the pelvis tor the re- ception of the important parts which it contains. But in addition to those curvatures which observe an antero-posterior direction, we likewise have two others situated laterally, one in the dorsal, the other m the lum- bar region; the convexity of the first bemg turned to the right fide, that of the second to the left. Two ideas have been assigned for the production of the first of those curves; it has been supposed by some that the thoracic aorta lying on the left side has a tendency by its pul- sations, gradually to force the vertebral column m the opposite direction, while others assert that the more frequent use of the right side naturally tends to cause the curvature in that line. The last observation seems to be correct, as in left-handed individuals the con- vexity of the curve is always turned m that direction, and in those pursuing laborious occupations the de- viation from a straight line is always more obvious than in those whose avocations require the application ot less physical exertion. It may be merely requisite to state that the slight curve in the lumbar region is only theie to antagonize that which exists m the dorsal, and is more or less apparent according to the degree of m- now S our attention to the posterior part of the spinal column we will observe the same alternating curvatures as on its anterior surlace but of course turned in an opposite direction. In mesial line the spines jut out prominently, forming ^^^ll-marked ri^^^^^^ from above downwards. In the cervical region the spmeot21 THE SPINE IN GENEEAL. the axis stands boldly out; the third, fourth, and fifth are more depressed, while those of the sixth and seventh, par- ticularly the last, are very prominent; they are bifid and exceedingly strong, giving attachment to the numerous muscles which move the head and neck. In the dorsal region those processes are differently arranged, bending downwards and backwards—overlapping each other so as to limit in a great measure all attempts at extension, and terminating in points or hooks, turned downwards and backwards. The spines of the lumbar vertebrse stand out at a right angle with the column; they are thick and strong, and separated from each other by a considerable interval, while those of the sacro-coccygeal region gradually diminish in size, till they are ulti- mately lost in a depressed triangular space—the termi- nation of the spinal canal. On either side of the spine appear deep grooves, the vertebral furrows, the floor formed by the lamina, and the interspaces between those processes completed by the yellow ligaments already alluded to. These furrows, filled up by the great ex- tensors of the spine, present in the living subject two well-marked, prominent, fleshy masses, extending on either side of the mesial line, for during life a depression marks the course of the spine, and this depression is deep and obvious according to the muscularity of the individual. The lateral aspect of the spinal column presents for observation the transverse processes, with the several peculiarities characteristic of each region. They are short and bifid in the cervical; thick, strong, and directed backwards, with a facette on their extre- mity, in the dorsal; pointed and comparatively weak in the lumbar. Situated between the roots of the transverse processes are the oblique, forming an irregular, wavy line from above downwards; and still more anteriorly between these and the body, are the intervertebral holes, krge and double in the sacral region, gradually dimi- nishing in size in the lumbar and dorsal, and again ex- panding in the cervical. Through these holes the nerves from the spinal marrow, with the communicating branches between the intra and extraspinal veins, pass, and the size of those several parts which traverse22 THE OSSEOUS SYSTEM. them, of course, corresponds with the capacity of the Thrspinal column thus formed contains within it the spinal cord, lodged in the bony cavity which extends from^the atlas to the coccyx.

This is proved by the late appearance of the ossific nuclei in the processes • they are comparatively of little consequence, and accord- ingly are not completed till an advanced period the fifteenth or twentieth year. The atlas is, however, pe- culiar in its ossification, for while its posterior half-arch follows the general rule of the laminte of the other ver- tebrae, no ossific point appears in its anterior till a year after birth. We have already alluded to the late period in which the change is produced in the sacrum and coccyx, so that it is quite unnecessary to repeat them here. THE THORAX. In pursuing the description of the osseous framework of the body, the thorax naturally comes next after the spinal column, both from its direct connexion with it and its very great importance in the animal economy. It is a large cavity, imperfectly conical, situated rather above the centre of the trunk; and, in addition to the other structures entering into its formation, has the ribs and sternum, which we shall now proceed to de- scribe. EiBS.—These bones from their position and use have been classed both as long and flat bones, acting in the one instance as levers, to which the muscles are attached, and in the other as flat ones, to enclose a cavity. They are twenty-four in number, or twelve on each side, while from the different manner in which they are situated with regard to the sternum, they have been divided into sternal, asternal, and floating. The first of these are seven in number, and are directly con- nected to the sternum by their own proper cartilages. The second consist of the three succeeding, which, although attached to the sternum, are only so indirectly, for their cartilages unite after proceeding for some dis- tance, and then the common one formed by the three becomes blended with that of the seventh, which gives them a species of connexion to the sternum. The two last are called floating ribs from the manner in which they seem to float in the cavity, having only a single24 THE OSSEOUS SYSTEil. point of attachment to the vertebral column by their head, while their anterior extremity, tipped by a short process of cartilage, has no bony connexion whatever ^ The ribs are by no means similar^ to each other m leno-th, while in some of them, for instance the farst, eleven h, and twelfth, certain striking peculiarities exist whkh will hereafter be noticed As a ge-ral r^k ^^^^^^ may be said to increase in ^^g^^^fr^^,^^^,,^^;' seventh, when they again dimmish gradually from that point to The twelfthr With respect to breadth they Kea e from the first to the last; but this rule is Hable to many variations, as an extended examination of those bon J in different subjects will clearly demon- strate. 1 rib is divided into a head, neck, tubercle, angle, and shaft. The head is triangular m shape and pre- sents on its extremity two oval, concave facettes the inferior slightly larger than the superior. These arti cukte with th Jdemi-facettes which appear on the upper and ower margins of the two contiguous vertebra while the iTgS ridge or crest which separates them is buried Jn thServertebral substance, and has attached to it tL interarticular ligament.

This is called the angle, and to that part of the bone intercepted between it and the tubercle on its posterior surface are inserted the great extensors of the spine. The shaft is the flattened portion of the bone between the angle behind and costal cartilao-e in front. It presents for examination two surfaces, an external and internal, and two margins, a superior 'and inferior. The external surface is flattened and very convex from before backwards, broader posteriorly than anteriorly. They give attachment to the great muscles of respiration, the serrati, pectorals, obliquus exter- nus, rectus, latissimus, dorsi, &c. The internal surface, concave from behind forwards, is covered by the pleura! The upper margin is rounded and smooth, and forms a smaller circle than the lower, which is deeply grooved for the reception of the intercostal vessels and nerves. This groove occupies about the posterior two-thirds of the bone, and is gradually lost as it approximates its anterior extremity. Its external lip is much deeper than Its internal, and to each is attached the muscles of the same name. The anterior extremity is deeply ex- cavated for the reception of the costal cartilage which is imbedded in it. The first rib is recognised immediately by its peculiar shape. It forms a larger segment, but of a smaller circle, than the others, and presents no angle of torsion Its head is small and rounded, and has only onefacette," as it articulates with one vertebra only, viz., the first' Its neck is contracted and small, while its tubercle is very prominent and differs from all the rest in its arti- culating facette being placed on its upper portion. Its two surfaces are very broad and flat, but they can no longer be called external or internal, but superior and mferior—one looking upwards, the other downwards, ihe upper presents the following peculiarities: a su- perficial groove anteriorly for the subclavian vein- behind this, a tubercle for the attachment of the sca- lenus anticus; behind this, another groove for the sub- clavian artery; and posterior to this, a longitudinal rid^e tor the insertion of the scalenus medius. The under surface presents nothing remarkable: it has no groove- the anterior margin is very convex, while the posterior c26 THE OSSEOUS SYSTEM. is equaUy concave. The point of this rib is flattened, and is tipped with cartilage, short, which connects it to the sternum. The two last ribs are very unlike the others; they form segments of larger circles, and are not near so deep from above downwards. They present but one facette on the head, as they articulate with one vertebra only. They have no neck, properly speaking, while the tu- bercle is not required, as they do not unite with the transverse process. They are likewise deficient, both in the angle and groove for the vessels. Their cartilage is also ve?y short. The ribs may be said to articulate directly only with the vertebral column but at two points, for they are only connected to the sternum by means of cartilage. They are developed by a single primitive point of ossification, which is for the body, and this makes its appearance from the fortieth to the fiftieth day. There are also two complementary points, one for the head, and one for the tubercle; these are united to the shaft about the fifteenth year. Sternum—This bone occupies the front oi the tho- rax and is not placed vertically, but slopes obliquely downwards and forwards, so as to increase the capacity of the lower part of the cavity. It is a single bone, and lies in front of the heart and pericardium, and hence its name, from forming a species of shield fo^f^t impor- tant organ. In early life it consisted of five distinct bones; and the division which existed at that period is generally marked out by a series of ridges, which are, however, nearly entirely effaced in more J^ature age, with the exception of the one between the first and se- Tond pieces. The persistence of this, with the addition of the xiphoid cartilage, has given origin to a fanciful nomenclature which the older anatomists applied to it from its supposed resemblance to an ancient sword. To the first piece they have applied the appellation, ma- nubrSmf the handle; to the second, gladiolus, or mucro whicTsignifies the blade; and to the third processus Ins formi°s, or point. It is, however, preferable, while considering it, to regard it only as one bone, o an hour- Xss shapf, b^oad above and below, and contracted in fhe centre. By this means we can examine its two sur-RIBS. 27 faces, its margins, and superior and inferior extremities. The anterior surface is slightly convex from above downwards, the same from side to side above, but flat- tened, and a little concave in the same direction beloAV. It is rough, and gives attachment to the aponeurosis of the pectoral of opposite sides, which cover it completely. Its posterior surface is concave from above downwards, and concave from side to side above, but completely flat below, and covered by the posterior sternal aponeurosis. It is much smoother than the anterior, corresponds to the anterior mediastinum, and gives origin above to the sternohyoid and thyroid muscles, and below to the tri- angulares sterni. Its margins, taken generally, are con- cave and rough, owing to the pits or depressions for the reception of the cartilages of the ribs; these are concave and oval in shape, and are arranged in the following manner: a whole and a half facette on the side of the first bone; four whole and two half ones on the side of the second; the half ones being found above and below, the whole ones between them; and, ultimately, a demi- facette on the upper part of the xiphoid cartilage. These constitute the seven for the articulation of the true ribs. The superior extremity of the bone is ex- tremely thick, as contrasted with the inferior. It pre- sents in the centre a rounded surface from before back- wards, concave from side to side, usually known as the fourchette, across which the interclavicular ligament passes, and is united to it by dense areolar tissue. This is limited on either side by the depression for the ex- tremity of the clavicle, forming an articulating surface, concave from within downwards and outwards; slightly convex from before backwards, looking upwards, back- wards, and outwards, and covered with cartilage for its reception. The inferior extremity is formed by the xiphoid cartilage, which is exceedingly irregular in its form and position. It may be either square or triangu- lar, hanging vertically, or turned forwards, backwards, or to either side. As the continuation of the sternum it gives attachment to the linea alba, the rectus, and flat abdominal muscles, the diaphragm, &c. The' ster- num articulates with the clavicles on either side and the costal cartilages of the true ribs. In structure it is ex- c 2THE OSSEOUS SYSTEM. 28 ceedingly spongy, two thin plates of compact tissue covering it in anteriorly and posteriorly. In its deve- lopment it is exceedingly late, the first ossific point not appearing till after the fifth month for the first piece, -while the others are not visible for some time longer. Generally speaking, there is a single point for each sepa- rate piece, but these are very often found double. The hole which exists occasionally between the first and se- cond piece is clearly an arrest of development in cases where there are double ossific points for the upper portion. The costal cartilages, which complete the thorax in front and -laterally, are remarkable for their elasticity and promptness to recover their original shape and posi- tion when distorted by the motions of the thorax. Hence they perform an important function by aiding the expiratory muscles, in restoring the cavity to its former dimensions after inspiration. In number they are twelve, and, like the ribs, they increase in length from the first to the seventh, and again gradually de- crease from that point to the twelfth. The first costal cartilage is remarkable for its shortness and thickness, and for the wide interval which separates it from the one below. The second, third, and fourth present no peculiar features; but the fifth, sixth, and seventh are found to approximate each other, so as to be completely in contact at their point of connexion with the sternum. The eighth, ninth, and tenth are much narrower, and more curved than the true; they taper off" gradu- ally towards their anterior extremity; become blended with each other, and the common cartilage thus formed is ultimately joined to that of the seventh rib; thus af- fording them a species of attachment to the sternum in front. The eleventh and twelfth are only a few lines in length, and terminate abruptly between the layers of muscles constituting the abdominal wall. If we now turn our attention to the mode of union between those cartilages and the osseous structures which they con- nect, we will find, as already explained, that there exists in the extremity of the rib a deep oval depression, into which the cartilage is imbedded, and the union between the two is still further strengthened by a process oi thinbut extremely strong fibrous tissue which stretchesTHE THORAX. 29 from the one to the other. The cartilage and the ster- num are bound together in precisely a similar manner, the cup-like cavity in the latter receiving the elongated extremity of the former, with fibrous bands stretching between both. The thorax, formed by the union of the parts thus described, with the addition of the dorsal vertebra and intercostal muscles, to fill up the intervals between each rib, holds an appropriate position, both in size and con- stitution, between the other two great cavities, the cra- nium and abdomen, being larger than the former, but smaller than the latter. The structure of its walls, partly osseous and partly muscular, bestows upon it a certain degree of mobility, but it is limited, being by no means equal to that of the abdomen, while it forcibly contrasts with the rigid, unyielding nature of the cranial cavity. In the Avell-formed male adult subject, when the upper extremities are removed, it presents a conical figure, but with a truncated apex, which is turned upwards. The anterior wall, sloping downwards and forwards, flat- tened, and about half the length of the posterior, is formed by the sternum and costal cartilages. The late- ral, rounded in their outline, and expanding in their descent, are constituted by the ribs and intercostal muscles. The posterior, flattened like the anterior, but convex from above downwards, is made up of the twelve dorsal vertebrse and the angles of the ribs. If we now contrast the inner part of the cavity with the outer, which we have just described, we will find that they ac- curately correspond with each other, of course substi- tuting what is convex in the one for what is concave in the other. We find, however, that the posterior wall, on its internal aspect, presents the following peculiarity: The bodies of the several vertebrte bulge forwards into the thorax, forming an elevated ridge in the mesial line, while a deepened guttur exists on either side, between the prominent spine and the angles of the ribs, a con- formation peculiar to erect man alone. Comparing now the organ of circulation with those of respiration, we observe, that a great disparity exists in their vo- , lume, and we accordingly find that the former is placed30 THE OSSEOUS SYSTEM. in the contracted interval between the vertebral column and sternum, while the greater bulk of the latter are accommodated in the wider space between the angles of the ribs and the costal cartilages. Thethorax communi- cates with the cervical region by what has been termed its upper outlet. This is of an oval form, its greatest breadth, from side to side, cut oflf obliquely from above and behind, dowuAvards and forwards; bounded ante- riorly by the first bone of the sternum, extremity of the clavicle, and inter-clavicular ligaments; laterally by the first rib, and behind by the body of the first dor- sal vertebra. A vast number of most important parts traverse it, some descending from the neck to the chest, and others again taking a contrary direction. These will be all enumerated in their proper place. The inle- rior aperture of the thorax is of much greater extent than the superior, but it is of the same oval figure, and cut off obliquely from before downwards and backwards, bounded anteriorly by the xiphoid cartilage; laterally by thecartilagesof thelasttrue, and all the false with the last rib itself; and posteriorly by the last dorsal vertebra. In the natural condition of the parts a strong muscle, the diaphragm, is thrown across the opening, forming a partition between the abdominal and thoracic cavities and through certain foramina in it parts are transmitted essential to the vital functions of the individual. 1 he obliquity of these two openings explains the reason why the vertical measurement anteriorly is much shorter than that posteriorly, the superior being cut olt from above, and behind downwards and forwards the mierior from below and behind upwards and forwards. The chest in the female subject is shorter than that of the male, owing to the abdomen being longer for the purpose of utero-gestation, but it is deeper antero-pos- teriorly. The habit, however, of using stays and iga- tures around the body produces gradually a striking alteration in its original shape by narrowing tje infe- rior outlet, and thus rendering it of an ovoid foim. The injurious effects which this produces are not con- fined solely to the lungs, which are foijihly thrust upwards; but they act likewise on the abdominal vis-CLAVICLE. 31 cera by compressing together the liver and lungs, and forcing downwards from their ordinary position the stomach and transverse colon. The foetal thorax is remarkable for its very great expanse inferiorly, owing to the large size of the liver, for its extreme shortness from above downwards from the non-development of the sternum, for its contraction from side to side from the want of expansion of the lungs, and for its depth from before backwards, owing to the great volume of the thymus gland and the greater comparative magnitude of the heart. These several peculiarities give to the foetal thorax a strik- ing resemblance to the same cavity in those animals where a want of the clavicle exists, viz., its flatness from side to side, and its equally obvious antero-poste- rior depth; but as the lungs expand and the thymus gland becomes atrophied, the ribs gradually assume their rounded form, and their angles begin to make their appearance, while the sternum, hitherto prominent, now commences to recede. The upper aperture, too, oval in shape, but with its long measurement antero- posteriorly, is, from the same causes, gradually length- ened from side to side, to assume that form which it is afterwards to retain; while the inferior one, from the diminished size of the liver, as contrasted with what it was at birth, is no longer conspicuous for its vast cir- cumference. The laboured respiration which often occurs in old age frequently depends on the ossification of the costal cartilages, a change to which they are very liable. Clavicle—We have now to turn our attention to a bone in the human subject which, from the important function that it performs, has been justly styled the key, as upon it depends the ready play of the arm, •which bestows upon man one of his highest attributes over the rest of the creation. It belongs to the class of long bones curved like an italic S, and stretching obliquely upwards, outwards, and backwards, from the upper part of the sternum to the acromion process. In the description of the bone it will be necessary to give it two extremities, an internal and external; two sur- faces, a superior and an inferior; and two margins, an ITHE OSSEOUS SYSTEM. 32 anterior and a posterior. The internal extremity is tri- angular in shape, the base turned upwards and for- wards, the apex downwards and backwards. It is covered with cartilage, and its inferior third, which is concave from before backwards, and convex from above and within downwards and outwards, articulates with the corresponding facette of the sternum, while the remaining portion is on a plane higher than the margin of the sternum, and gives attachment to the interclavi- cular ligament. Its circumference is rough anteriorly and posteriorly for the sterno-clavicular ligaments— superiorly for the origin of the sterno-mastoid, while below it is smooth and rests on the cartilage of the first rib, from which it is separated by a bursa. Its external extremity is flattened, and presents an oval facette covered with cartilage, cut off obliquely from above and without downwards and inwards, so that it rests on and is supported by the acromion pro- cess; its upper and lower edges are also rough for the attachment of ligaments. Of its two surfaces, the superior is the rounder and smoother, directed rather upwards and forwards; its internal third gives origm to the outer head of the sterno-mastoid, while its two external thirds can be easily felt in the livmg subject, being covered only by the skin and a strong aponeu- rosis from the deltoid and trapezius. Its inferior sur- face is more irregular. Internally we observe a ridge for the insertion of the rhomboid ligament; a little more externally a longitudinal groove for the attach- ment of the ligamentum bicorne and subclavius muscle the latter extending out as far as the outer fourth ot the bone, where two rough eminences appear, the inter- nal and posterior for the conoid, and the external and anterior for the trapezoid ligaments. Its anterior mar- o-in directed also downwards, is convex for its internal ?wo-thirds, and gives attachment to the great pectoral- concave externally where it affords ongin to the del- toid. Its posterior edge is rough and convex exter- nally, and into it the fibres of the trapezius are inserted concave internally and smooth, embracing the first rib, and permitting the great vessels and neryes to pass up and down behind it. The clavicle articulates with33 SCAPULA. two bones only, the sternum and scapula; occasionally it lies on the cartilage of the first rib. It is developed at a very early period, generally about the thirtieth day, and continues to grow very rapidly during the term of intra-uterine life. It has but one single point of ossification, but sometimes a complementary nodule is found on its under surface near the sternum, and a se- cond for the tubercles, of thecoraco-clavicular ligaments. This bone in the female is easily distinguishable from that of the male; it is comparatively longer, much straighter, and always more rounded. The clavicle, in fact, appears to be more influenced in shape and size above all the other bones by the nature of the avoca- tions, whether laborious or otherwise, in which its pos- sessor was engaged. Scapula—This belongs to the class of flat bones, and is found on the lateral and posterior part of the thorax, occupying the interval between the first and seventh ribs. It is of a triangular form; its base turned backwards and inwards; its apex, which is formed by the glenoid cavity, pointing upwards, for- wards, and outwards. In the description of the bone it is necessary to give it two surfaces, an internal and external; three borders, a superior or cervical, a poste- rior or vertebral, or base, and an inferior or anterior, or axillary; three angles, a superior posterior, an inferior posterior, and an anterior; three processes, a coracoid, acromion, and spine. If we take the internal surface of the bone we will find it to be concave and marked by three or four elevated ridges or lines, which give attachment to the subscapular muscle. The external surface is divided into two distinct portions by the spine, leaving a fossa above it, called the supraspinous; another below it, the infraspinous. These diff"er from each other in size, the inferior being three times as large as the superior. The latter, which is of an irre- gular triangular shape and concave, affords attachment to the supraspinous muscle, while the former, which is of a similar figure and convex, bounded below by an elevated ridge, gives origin to the infraspinous muscle. The ridge which appears on it below is broad and expanded posteriorly, narrow andconstricted anteriorly;34 THE OSSEOUS SYSTEM. behind it presents a quadrilateral surface for the attachment of the teres major, and in front of this a grooved elongated channel for the origin of the teres minor. A large foramen is always visible m the mfra- spinous fossa near its upper part, for the nutritious artery to enter; of its three margins, the superior is the shortest; it commences anteriorly at the root oi the coracoid process, where it is deeply notched and to the lips of this notch, anteriorly and posteriorly, is attached the transverse ligament, converting it into a foramen, through which the suprascapular nerve en- ters while the artery of the same name passes above the'ligament, perforating the omohyoid, which arises from it and the adjacent bone. The rest of the su- perior border is gently concave, terminating m the posterior superior angle, rounded, and mto which the levator anguli scapulee is inserted. The posterior ed^e is the longest, and is very convex; it gives at- tachment to the serratus magnus and the two rhom- boids, the lesser of the two last-named muscles being attached to the space corresponding to the root ol the spine, the greater from that point to its inferior angle. The inferior or axillary margin is thickest and ge- nerally deeply grooved; posteriorly it is embraced by the origin of the teres muscles and subscapularis, while anteriorly, immediately behind the glenoid cavity it affords attachment to the long head of the triceps. The spine is that process which commences posteriorly by a triangular surface of variable extent, covered with cartilale and a bursal membrane at its posterior bor- der over which the dorsal fibres of the trapezius glide; and, becoming gradually more prominent, termmates anteriorly in the expanded acromion process: i pre- sents two margins; a superior, regular and slightly concave which gives attachment to the trapezius; an inS convex posteriorly, concave in tl- centre and again convex anteriorly for the origin of ^he deUo d The acromion, which terminates it m front, but takes a different direction, being inclined -P-^f ^'/-^"^^^^^^ external margin to which the attachment of the de to d is still continued; an internal border, covered w h cartilage and cut off obliquely to articulate with the clavick; a pointed process anteriorly which can be35 SCAPULA. easily felt during life, and is of much importance to the surgeon; its upper surface rough for the attachment of the acromio-clavicular ligaments, and covered by a strong aponeurosis from the deltoid and trapezius. Its inferior surface, springing like an arch from the back part of the bone behind the neck, where it is thick and rounded, gives attachment to the spino-glenoid liga- ment, while above, where it is broad and expanded, it gives origin to the apex of the triangular. The cora- coid process springs by a thick root from the upper margin of the scapula, anterior to the notch; its first direction is upwards, then forwards and inwards, ter- minating in a blunted extremity. Its posterior angle, very obtuse, gives origin to the transverse ligament; its external margin has inserted into it the base of the triangular, its internal the costo-coraco-clavicu- lar; its superior surface, which is slightly convex and rough, affords attachment to the coraco-clavicular liga- ments; its inferior surface, smooth and arched, cor- responds to the head of the humerus, and has con- nected to it anteriorly the coraco-humeral or accessory ligament. Three muscles are attached to its point, viz., the lesser pectoral internally, the biceps externally, and the coraco brachialis between the two. The glenoid cavity lies immediately beneath the co- racoid process. It is of an ovoid shape, the inferior part broad and rounded; the superior, narrow, and pointed, and affording attachment to the long tendon of the biceps. It is concave, but superficial, covered with cartilage and surrounded at its margins by the glenoid ligament, which partially deepens it for the reception of the head of the humerus. In its ordinary position it looks upwards, forwards, and outwards. The scapula articulates with two bones, the clavicle and humerus, while it is connected with the trunk by muscle or sysarcosis. It is developed from a single pri- mitive point for the body, visible about the eighth or ninth week; and four complementary, viz., one for the coracoid process, generally visible at birth; two for the acromion about the fifteenth year; one for the spine about the third month; and one for the vertebral bor- der about the sixteenth year.THE OSSEOUS SYSTEM. 36 Humerus.—Occupies the highest part in the upper extremity, and belongs to the class of long bones. It is comparatively straight, slightly twisted inwards, ex- panded at either extremity, and constricted m its centre. It presents for consideration a head, anatomical neck, two tuberosities, a surgical neck, shaft, and inferior ex- tremity. The head is a rounded process of bone, form- inrr about one-third of a sphere, situated on the lateral and posterior part of the bone, looking upwards, back- wards, and inwards, and covered with cartilage, to arti- culate with the glenoid cavity of the scapula. It is limited all round by an irregular, slightly-depressed, wavy hne, the anatcmiical neck into which the capsular ligament of the joint is inserted. Directly below this, and on the anterior and external part of the bone, two promi- nent processes are observed, the greater and lesser tu- berosities; the former lying on a plane external to the latter, and presenting on its upper part three weii- marked facettes—the most superior for the supraspi- natus: the middle for the infraspinatus, and the interior for the teres minor. The coraco-humeral ligament is also inserted into it. The lesser tuberosity is more co- nical in shape, and presents only one facette for the attachment of the subscapularis. These two processes are separated from each other by a groove, deep above, but broad and shallow below. It is called the bicipi- tal, because the long tendon of the biceps plays through it in its course downwards and inwards to unite with its second or short head. The bicipital groove has two lips an anterior or external, and a posterior or internal; to the first is attached the pectoralis major to the second the latissimi dorsi and teres major. The space intercepted between the insertion of those muscles and the tuberosities has been called, from the i^^q^ency of fractures in this position, the surgical neck To the back part of this porti^on of the bone, and extending upward L 1 i'h as the facette for the teres minor, the external head of the triceps is attached; from its internal surface, as high up as the insertion of the teres major i s inner head'arises. The shaft of the bone is irregularly pris- matic presenting three margins: an anterior which is, Tu^^'sp aSng, the externallip of the bicipital groove,37 HUMERUS, prominent above, depressed and nearly lost below; an internal, which must also be regarded as the inner lip of the same groove, much more elevated below, where it forms the internal condyloid ridge, than above; and an external, which is scarcely visible above, but well- marked inferiorly, where it forms the external condy- loid ridge. These three naturally divide the bone into as many surfaces, an external, internal, and posterior. On looking at the latter, we observe that it is rounded, slightly convex from above do\vnwards, and deeply- grooved by the musculospiral artery and nerve ; the whole of this surface is clothed by the triceps. The ex- ternal side presents, a little above the mesial line, a well- marked V-shaped crest for the insertion of the deltoid, and on either side of it a furrow or groove for the origin of the brachialis anticus, the two heads of which em- brace the tendon of the deltoid. The internal surface, which is exceedingly flat, has a rough portion about its centre for the insertion of the coraco-brachialis. The inferior fifth of the bone is of a triangular shape, ex- panded and flattened out below, twisted inwards, and bounded on either side by the condyloid ridges. Of these the external is by far the most prominent and best marked, its lip curled forwards, and exceedingly rough, terminating below in the external condyle. To its upper third is attached the supinator radii longus ; to its middle third the extensor carpi radialis longior; and to its lower, the extensor carpi radialis brevior. The external intermuscular septum is connected to its posterior edge, separating the origin of those muscles from the triceps. The internal condyloid ridge is much thicker, more rounded, and depressed; a little anterior to it, and about the centre of the shaft is the foramen for the nutritious artery of the bone, directed down- wards; the internal intermuscular septum is attached to its centre for its whole extent, separating the triceps from the brachialis anticus. On contrasting the two condyles with each other, the internal is found to be much the strongest and most elevated; it is conical in shape, rounded anteriorly, flattened posteriorly, having an inclination backwards, and giving origin to the powerful flexors and pronators of the fore-arm. The38 THE OSSEOUS SYSTEM. external condyle is small; it lies on a plane inferior to the internal, afFording origin to the extensors and su- pinators. The extremity of the humerus is twisted forwards, cut off obliquely from above downwards and inwards, presenting a series of processes which may be thus enumerated from without inwards. First, the ca- pitulum, oval in shape, covered with cartilage, looking directly forwards for articulation with the radius, be- condly, a groove, shallow, and limiting the process in- ternally. Thirdly, a ridge slightly elevated, the ex- ternal boundary of-fourthly, the trochlea, a large articular surface for the sigmoid notch of the uhia, concave from side to side, convex from before back- wards, limited behind by a deep depression for the ole- cranon process during extension of the fore-arm, and for the Haversian gland, in front by a shallower excavation for the coronofd process during flexion. These depres- sions often communicate, and at all times are separated merely by a thin plate of bone. The aspect of the trochlea is downwards, forwards, and outwards. Fifthly, the epi- trochlea, the internal lip of the last-mentioned process prominent and well marked, forming three-fourths of a circle, oblique on its external aspect and covered ^^nth cartilage, flattened on its internal, and presentmg nume- rous foramina for the passage of nutritious vessels. The humerus articulates with tnree bones :_the sca- pula above, and the radius and ulna below. It is de- veloped by seven points of ossification: one for the body, whkh is visible from the fortieth to the fiftieth day; Tne for the head; and one for the great tuberosity; one for the capitulum; one for the trochlea, and one for each condyle m^nng seven in all. The last six make their T^Zr^nl from the first to the twelfth year, but they a?? not all united together, so as to constitute one bone, ''U.~^^^^^^^^^ belongs to the class of long bones; and for the purposes of description ^e^^^^^^^^^^ into a; olecranon and coronoid process, ^^P^^f;^ ^y t^^^^ great sigmoid cavity; a shaft; a head, and ^t^l;^^ cess The olecranon forms the highest point of the bon; and may be justly regarded as the continuation upwards of the shaft, 'on observing it superiorly, weULNA. 39 perceive that it is quadilateral in shape, rough on its surface, and covered by a bursa, which the tendon of the triceps, inserted into its posterior margin, plays over. Its internal edge gives origin to the flexor carpi ulnaris; its external has the anconeus inserted into it; its posterior surface, extending downwards for about an inch and a half, is triangixlar, the base above and apex below; it is smooth and subcutaneous; its anterior surface is covered with cartilage, and enters into the formation of the greater sigmoid cavity, presently to be described. The coronoid process lies on a plane inferior and anterior to the last; it also is conical in form, con- cave from above downwards, and exceedingly rough, for the attachment of the following parts: most supe- riorly, the anterior ligament of the joint; below this the insertion of the brachialis anticus; then the pronator radii teres; more inferiorly, flexor digitorum sublimis, and slip of the flexor pollicis longus. The great sigmoid cavity separates these two processes, forming a little more than one-third of a circle; it is concave from above downwards, convex from side to side, and looks up- wards, forwards, and inwards; a prominent vertical ridge, corresponding to the trochlea of the humerus, oc- cupies its central part; while a transverse depression is sometimes found to exist, showing the point where the upper portion became united to the shaft. Situated on the outer and lower part of the greater sigmoid notch is the lesser, concave from before backwards, deeper behind than in front, forming about one-fourth of a circle, for articulation with the head of the radius, the orbicular ligament completing the remainder of the ring for connecting the bones together. The shaft is prismatic in its superior three-fourths, rounded and contracted in its inferior. It presents three margins and three surfaces. The external margin is well-marked superiorly, where the interosseous membrane is attached, but gradually lost below, where this ligament ceases. The anterior internal edge is the direct continuation downwards of the apex of the coronoid process. It is much more rounded than the external, while the pos- terior internal presents nearly the same characters as40 THE OSSEOUS SYSTEM. the last, hut stretches from the olecranon process above to the styloid below. Of the three surfaces, the anterior is concave from above downwards, and slightly concave from side to side; its three superior fourths give at- tachment to the flexor digitorum profundus, and its inferior to the pronator quadratus. Near its upper nart is the foramen for the nutritious artery, leading upwards to the coronoid process.

The union between the several parts is not com- pleted till the eighteenth or twentieth year. Eadius.—This also belongs to the class of long bones, but is shorter, but not quite so Strong as the last. For the purposes of description it may be divided into a head, neck, tubercle, shaft, and lower extremity. The head is caliciform in shape, slightly excavated, and covered with cartilage, to articulate with the capitulum of the humerus. It is surrounded by a rim of bone, broader internally, where it articulates with the lesser sigmoid notch of the ulna, than externally, where it is embraced by the orbicular ligament. Below this the bone presents an evident constriction for about an inch, as far, in fact, as the tubercle; this is the neck, not ob- serving the same axis as the shaft, but taking a direction upwards, backwards, and outwards. The tubercle is on the inner and anterior part of the bone, slightly ele- vated, and covered by a btirsa, over which the tendon of the biceps glides, to be inserted immediately below it. The shaft of the bone, although prismatic in shape, like the ulna, differs from it in having its contracted part superiorly, its broad and expanded portion in- feriorly. It presents for examination three surfaces, and as many margins; the anterior surface is concave from above downwards, and flat, and has attached to its superior three-fourths, internally, the flexor poUicis longus; to its middle third, externally, the flexor digi- torum sublimis; and to its inferior fourth, the pronator quadratus. Near its upper and outer part is the hole for the nutrient artery. The external surface is convex and rounded. Into its superior third is inserted the supinator brevis; on its middle third a well-marked crest appears, for the attachment of the pronator radii teres; and inferiorly, at the base of the styloid process, it is again rough, for the tendon of the supinator longus. The posterior surface is likewise convex; it is rounded above and below, and grooved longitudinally about the centre. Siiperiorly it gives attachment to the extensor digitorum communis; and inferiorly to the extensor ossis, and primi internodii pollicis. Of its42 THE OSSEOUS SYSTEM. three margins, the only one that is remarkable is the internal, which is sharp, and extends from about an inch below the tubercle to about two inches above the lower extremity of the bone, where it bifurcates into two ridges, forming the li^s of the articulating facette for the extremity of the ulna. The lower part of the radius is broad and expanded as contrasted with the shaft; an- teriorly it is concave, presenting a very irregular, un- dulating lip, to which the anterior carpal ligament is attached, and over which the flexors of the forearm glide; externally it is prolonged into the styloid process, which is short, thick, and triangular; bounded m front by a groove, through which the tendons of the ex- tensor ossis metacarpi and the primi internodii glide; behind by a broader but shallower one, sometimes divided into two by a slight ridge, for the extensors carpi radialis longior and brevior. The styloid process gives attachment by its point to the external lateral ligament; and by its posterior surface to the pos- terior annular. External to the groove which lodges the radial extensors is another, small but deep; it is directed downwards and outwards, and accommodates the extensor secundi internodii pollicis; internal to this is still a fourth channel, broad but superficial, through which the extensor communis and indicis ghde to their insertion. The internal surface of the bone, as already remarked, is marked by a facette, concave antero-pos- teriorly, and covered with cartilage for the reception ot the head of the ulna; its lower border is sharp and gives attachment to the base of the interarticular fibro- cartilage. The inferior extremity of the radius looks downwards, forwards, and inwards; it is covered with cartilage, and presents two distinct facettes, both con- cave, the external, triangular, to articulate with the scaphoid, the internal, quadrilateral, tojom with the TheTadius is connected with four bones: the hume- rus above, the ulna laterally, and the scaphoid and semi- lunar below.

They are all united, and form a whole about the twentieth year after birth. Hand.—The hand, subservient to the functions which it is destined by nature to perform, is endowed with an organization far more complex than the other parts of the body. To bestow upon it variety of motion we find that it is composed of a great number of bones, firmly bound together by powerful ligaments, and yet allowing a certain degree of freedom to adapt it to those offices which it is momentarily called on to perform. In order to render its structure more simple, anato- mists have divided it into three distinct parts: the superior, consisting of the eight small bones, the carpus; the middle, consisting of the five intermediate; the me- tacarpal, and the inferior of the last fourteen, the pha- langes. The Carpus—The assemblage of bones constituting the carpus are arranged in two distinct rows,—a supe- rior and inferior,—four in each. Taking the first from without inwards, we find it to be composed of the sca- phoid, semilunar, cuneiform, pisiform; the second, in the same direction, of the trapezium, trapezoid, os mag- num, and unciform. We will now proceed to give a brief description of each, beginning with the scaphoid. Scaphoid—This bone is very irregular in figure, being elongated from without inwards, and boat-shaped as its name implies. Superiorly and externally we ob- serve on it an oval surface covered with cartilage, con- vex, looking upwards and backwards for articulation with the radius; inferiorly and internally a large con- cave facette, looking downwards and forwards to receive the head of the os magnum; external to this, but still inferiorly, a smaller facette of the same shape, but con- vex, to unite with the trapezium, while the small ridge that separates the two discs looks downwards to articu- late with the trapezoid; internally it presents a flattened surface, to articulate with the semilunar; externally it terminates in a rounded extremity, which gives attach- ment to the external lateral, annular ligaments, and the aponeuroses of the abductor, opponens, and outer44 THE OSSEOUS SYSTEM. head of the flexor poUicis brevis; posteriorly it is rough and convex for the dorsal ligaments, while ante- riorly it is contracted and concave for the palmar. The scaphoid is thus seen to articulate Avith five bones: the radius, semilunar, os magnum, trapezoid, and trape- zium. Semilunar.—This bone is wedge-shaped, broad pos- teriorly, convex, and rough, for the attachment of the dorsal ligaments; thin anteriorly for the palmar; supe- riorly it is convex, covered with cartilage, irregularly quadrilateral to articulate with the radius; inferiorly it presents two facettes, both concave and oblong from before backwards; the outer to articulate with the head of the OS magnum, the inner with the unciform. Ex- ternally it unites with the scaphoid by a flattened, long facette, and internally with the cuneiform by a trian- gular one. This bone, like the preceding, articulates with five: the radius, scaphoid, os magnum, unciform, and cuneiform. Cuneiform.—This is also wedge-shaped, with its broader surface turned posteriorly, which we find to be generally convex, but irregularly marked by elevations and depressions. To these are attached the dorsal liga- ments. The anterior surface is much smaller, but like- wise irregular; it presents a circular facette for the pisiform bone, and gives attachment to the palmar liga- ments. Its superior surface, rounded externally, grooved internally, is separated from the head of the ulna by the triangular fibro-cartilage. Its outer presents a flat quadrilateral facette, to articulate with the semilunar. Its inner is free and blunted, and has inserted into it the internal lateral ligament. Its inferior border has a long convex facette to articulate with the unciform; it is connected directly to three bones only, the semilu- nar, unciform, and pisiform. Pisiform Small and rounded like a pea, very va- riable in size in diff^erent individuals. It is not placed exactly on the same plane with the three preceding bones, but rather on the anterior aspect of the cunei- form, internally with which it articulates by an oval concave facette. This small bone gives attachmentCARPUS. 45 to the flexor carpi ulnaris, the abductor minimi dio-iti and the anterior annular ligament. It articulates only with one bone, the cuneiform. Trapezidm.—Is of an irregular cuboid figure, and as such presents six surfaces, which we will describe in order. The posterior is semilunar and rough for the at- tachment of the dorsal ligaments; the anterior, wedoe- shaped, the sharp edge of the wedge, which looks di- rectly forwards, giving attachment to the anterior annular ligament and abductor, opponens and flexor pollicis brevis muscles; internal to this is a deep groove, through which the tendon of the flexor carpi radialis glides. The superior presents a circular concave facette to articulate with the scaphoid; the inferior, a larger one, concave from before backwards, convex from side to side for the extremity of the first metacarpal bone; a smaller facette is likewise visible on it inferiorly, and internally for the second; the external is rounded, and has inserted into it the external lateral ligament; the internal is concave from above downwards, and unites with the trapezoid. This bone thus articulates with four: the scaphoid, trapezium, and first and second metacarpal. Trapezoid—A very small bone and wedge-shaped. Its broader part, directed posteriorly, is of an oval figure; it gives attachment to the dorsal ligament; small and rough anteriorly for the palmar. 1°articu- lates superiorly by a small concave surface with the scaphoid; inferiorly it presents a large oblong facette, concave from before backwards; convex from side to side for the second metacarpal bone; externally it is flat and triangular where it unites with the trapezium- and mternally quadrilateral, but still flattened where it lies m contact with the os magnum. It articulates, like the preceding, with four bones: the scaphoid, trape- zium, second metacarpal bone, and os magnum. Os Magnum.—This is the largest bone°of the carpus and has been divided into a head, neck, and body. The head is the highest part; is very convex; looks up- wards, backwards, and outwards, and is received into a kind of ^cket formed by the scaphoid and semilunar bones. The neck is the constricted portion, lying im-45 THE OSSEOUS SYSTEM. mediately below the head; it is much better marked posteriorly than anteriorly The body is quadrx^^^^^^^^^^^^ but much larger behind than m front.

In- form, and two last metacarpal bones.47 METACARPAL. All these small bones are developed by single points of ossification. These become visible at different pe- riods for each. Thus, it appears in about the first year in the os magnum and unciform; in the cuneiform in the third; in the trapezium and semilunar in the fourth; and in the scaphoid and trapezoid in the eighth. The pisiform is not ossified till the fifteenth year. Metacarpal—These are five in number, and belong to the class of long bones. They each present two extremities, a carpal and phalangeal, and a shaft. The carpal ends are generally square in shape and expanded, and to a certain extent may be distinguished from each other by the number and shape of the facettes which appear on them. Thus, the first has only a single one on its extremity, concave transversely, and convex antero-posteriorly, but none laterally. The second has four; three on its extremity, the central being the largest for the trapezoid, with two smaller ones on either side for the trapezium and os magnum, with one internally and laterally for the third metacarpal bone. This last has only one facette on the extremity for the OS magnum, with two lateral ones for the adjacent me- tacarpal bones. The fourth has four: two superiorly, the smaller external for the os magnum, the larger in- ternal for the unciform; it also has two lateral ones for the contiguous bones. The fifth has only one superiorly for the unciform, and one externally for the fourth metacarpal bone. The carpal ends of those bones which are rough anteriorly and posteriorly for the attachment of ligaments give insertion to the following tendons. To the posterior and external part of the first the ex- tensor ossis metacarpi pollicis; to the second in front the flexor, and behind to the extensor carpi radialis longior. To the third posteriorly the extensor carpi radialis bre- vior; to the fifth in front the flexor, and behind, the ex- tensor carpi ulnaris. The shaft of these bones are con- stricted, prismatic in shape, convex posteriorly and concave anteriorly; their sides flattened for the attach- ment of the iuterossei muscles. They terminate in large rounded extremities for articulating with the proximal ends of the first phalanges. If we look to the differential characters of those metacarpal bones, we48 THE OSSEOUS SYSTEM. will find them to be the following. The first is known at once by its shortness and thickness; it is also much flatter than any of the others. We recognise the third immediately by its greater length. There is astr^^^^^^^ similarity between the second and fourth, but the ior Tr ma/be known without difficulty by the absence of the facette on its outer and lateral part.

These bones are developed from two points of ossification, one for the upper extremity, and one for the shaft. They are very variable as to their appearance,' from the first to the seventh year. THE LOWER EXTREMITY. The bones entering into the formation of the lower extremity are the two ossa innominata, the femur, pa- tella, tibia, fibula, and foot. We will commence our de- scription with the first, and go through each of them severally in the same order as was observed in the upper. Os Innominatum.—Taken as a whole it may be said to be hour-glass in shape, expanded at both extremities, and contracted and twisted inwards in the centre, but because in early life it was divisible into three distinct parts—the ilium, ischium, and pubis, we will take each of these separately, and having examined them in- dividually, will afterwards consider them as a whole in the general review of the pelvis. Ilium.—This forms by far the largest part of the bone. It may be separated from the other two by makmg a cut with a saw between the pubal eminence and the anterior inferior spinous process, as far as, and a little above, the centre of the acetabulum. Another cut must now be made in the great sciatic notch, to meet the preceding one in the same cavity. This will detach the ilium from the other two. On examining the bone thus removed we find it to be fan-shaped, broad and expanded above, thick and constricted below; its central part bounded on either side by the sawn sur- faces, forming a little less than two-fifths of the aceta- bulum, covered with cartilage, and looking downwards forwards, and outwards. It is bounded above by an elevated ridge or lip, to which is attached the cotyloid50 THE OSSEOUS SYSTEM. ligament; a little above it the capsular, and still higher and anteriorly the outer head of the rectus. As we ad- vance still more superiorly the bone becomes expanded, and from its resemblance to the wing of a bird it has been .termed the ala of the ilium. It is convex ante- riorly, concave posteriorly, and on it may be observed two or three large foramina, through which the nutri- tious branches from the gluteal artery enter the diploe. Three rough elevated lines are also observed on it. ilie first is situated superiorly and posteriorly, commencing at the posterior fifth of the crest, and termmating mid- way between the two posterior spinous processes. It gives attachment to the gluteus maximus The se- cond is more in the centre, beginning a little behmd the anterior superior spinous process, and stretching as far as the upper part of the great sciatic notch, it is curved, the concavity looking downwards and forwards, and gives origin to the glutseus medius. The third is iust above the edge of the acetabulum, commencing at the depression between the two anterior spinous pro- cesses, and terminating at the lower part of the great sciatic notch. It likewise is concave downward, and from it the gluteeus minimus arises.

If we now turn to the edge of the liium.OS INNOMINATUM. 51 and commencing inferiorly, we first observe a deep groove between the anterior inferior spinous process and pubal eminence; through this pass out the ten- dons of the psoas and iliacus muscles, with the anterior crural nerve between them. As we ascend we next meet with a well-marked prominence, the anterior in- ferior spinous process; from this arise the internal head of the rectus femoris, and accessory ligament of the hip- joint. Still higher up we reach a depression or groove for the passage of the middle musculo-cutaneous nerve; and highest of all an obvious eminence, the anterior su- perior spinous process, to the lower part of which is at- tached the sartorius; to its outside the tensor vaginae femo- ris, and to its point Poupart's ligament. Proceeding from this backwards we come to the crest. This is curved presenting anteriorly a convexity outwards, posteriorly a convexity inwards; broad in front and behind; sharp in the centre, giving attachment by its outer and inner lips for its anterior three-fourths to the glutteus medius and iliacus internus; by its anterior two-thirds to the external oblique, by its whole extent to the internal oblique and transversalis; by its posterior fourth to the glutEBus maximus, latissimus, dorsi, erectors of the spine, and quadratus lumborum. The crest terminates pos- teriorly in a sharp point, the posterior superior spinous process, to which is attached the ilio-lumbar ligament. We now descend over a thin, sharp part of the bone for about an inch, till we reach the posterior inferior spine, which gives origin to the great sciatic ligament. Curv- ing now forwards, and again descending downwards and backwards, it becomes broad, rounded, and smooth, forming the upper and anterior part of the great sciatic ; notch, under which the gluteal artery, with its vein and 1 nerve, passes outwards, sometimes grooving the bone 1 throwing off in its course a large branch, which perfo- I rates the edge of the notch, near its posterior part, and t establishing a remarkable anastomosis in the substance (of the bone, with the ilio-lumbar, which pierces the wall of the iliac fossa. Ischium.—This portion of the bone may be detached ifrom the pubis by carrying the saw between the ascend- ung ramus of the one and the descending of the other V 252 THE OSSEOUS SYSTEM. SO as to strike the junction of the upper with the middle third of the obturator hole. Passing now across this foramen, it meets the edge of the acetabulum at the upper part of the notch, and continuing its course in- wards, the portion of the bone in question becomes de- tached. In shape the ischium has been compared to a horse-shoe, and for the purpose of description may be divided into a body formed by the acetabulum, a spine, tuberosity, and ramus. The body of the bone is very broad and thick, as contrasted with the other parts ot it It forms something more than two-fifths of the ace- tabulum, and next to the ilium is the most promment part, except internally where it is excavated, constitut- ing what is called the notch, a natural deficiency left for the entrance of branches of the obturator and internal circumflex of the profunda, to enter to supply the parts within the capsular ligament. Immediately below the lip of the acetabulum, between it and the tuberosity, is a deep groove, traversed by the tendon of the obturator externus, passing upwards, backwards, and mwards, m the direction of the spine. Behind the acetabulum, and between it and the spine, the bone is of a triangu ar shape, and slightly convex, over which the capsular muscles of the hip-joint glide to their insertion. The spine is situated posteriorly, directed downwards back- wards, and inwards; broad at its root, contracted at its free extremity, forming the Hne of demarcation betwe^i thetwosciaticnotches, corresponding by its external sur- face to the pudic vessels and nerves, and having attached to it the superior gemellus; the lesser sciatic ligament is inserted into its point; the coccygseus arises from its posterior part; the levator ani from its internal surtace interior to the spine is a small but deep groove, directed Tut wards and backwards, which, m the natural state of the parts, is a foramen formed by the great sciatic li^a- men This is the lesser sciatic notch through which the pudic vessels and nerves enter, with a small branch f om^ the sacral plexus, to supply the obturator muscle 2Zh passes out, and is separated from the tuberosity Tf the ischium by a bursa. This last-named process lupies the posterior and inferior part of the bone, and presents for examination two surfaces and two margms.53 OS INNOMINATUM. The external surface is slightly convex, and perfo- rated by one or two holes for the entrance of the nu- tritious vessels. It gives attachment above to the ob- turator externus and adductor magnus. The internal surface is comparatively smooth, affording origin supe- riorly to the obturator internus; below and anteriorly to the transversus perinaei, erector, and cruspenis. Its an- terior margin is concave and sharp, and gives attachment to the obturator membrane. Inferiorly it is triangular in shape, the base behind, the apex in front, convex from before backward, rough, looking downwards, backwards, and outwards, giving origin superiorly and externally to the long head of the biceps, more anteriorJy, to the semi-tendinosus,external to both the semi-membranous; still further inwards, above, to the inferior gemellus, and inferior to this to the quadratus femoris. The great sciatic ligament is inserted into its inner lip, forming there a falciform process. The ascending ramus is the connecting link between the tuberosity and pubis. It IS of an oblong figure, concave on its external surface antero-posteriorly, giving origin internally to the gra- cilis, in the centre, to the adductor magnus, and exter- nally to the obturator externus. Its internal surface is convex, and affords attachment internally to the obtu- rator internus; more externally to the triangular liga- ment, and near its upper extremity to Guthrie's muscle or compressor urethra. Its posterior edge is sharp, and has connected to it the obturator membrane; its ante- rior is rounded, and twisted outwards, and gives origin to tlie crus penis. The pubis, which is already detached, is of a triangular : form, and may be divided into a body, horizontal ramus, • spine, crest, and descending ramus. The body consti- ■ tutes about one-fifth of the acetabulum; it is less pro- imment than the other two portions. Immediately ! above and anterior to it is a large expanded eminence, I the pubal, bounding internally the groove for the psoas I and iliacus; into this the lesser psoas is inserted. Pro- cceeding forwards and inwards, we reach the horizontal !ramus, extending as far as the spine; the anterior part <of Its superior surface is rounded and gives origin to the34 THE OSSEOUS SYSTEM. pectineus muscle; more posteriorly is a sliarp elevated ridge, the linea innominata, wliich affords attachment to the following parts: for its internal third Gimber- naut's, Keys', and Colles' ligaments and the conjoined tendons; for its internal two-thirds, the iliac and pubic portions of the fascia lata of the thigh, and the lascia iliaca; inferiorly it corresponds to the obturator fora- men, and is deeply grooved from without forwards and inwards, for the passage of the vessels and nerves oi the same name; anteriorly it presents nothing remarkable, being only flattened and expanded at each extremity, rounded and constricted in the centre; posteriorly it is also flattened and broad, and is covered by the pelvic fascia; at the termination of the horizontal ramus, an- teriorly and superiorly, is the spine, of variable size, directed backwards and outwards, and giving insertion to Poupart's ligament and the cremaster muscle; it likewise corresponds to the base of the external abdo- minal ring; the crest is that portion of the bone extend- ing between the spine and angle; it is about an mch m length, rounded, and covered with cartilage, giving attachment to the flat abdominal muscles, the rectus and pyramidalis; the angle forms the commencement oi the symphysis, which is placed internally, descending nearly vertically from the crest, covered with cartilage, and cut off obliquely from before, backwards, and in- wards, so that whUe posteriorly the lips of the opposite bones are nearly in contact, anteriorly a broad interval, filled up with fibro-cartilage, separates them. Below the symphysis is the edge of the descending ramus, bent outwards, affording attachment to the subpubic liga- ment. The anterior part of the descending ramus by some called the crest, is flattened and quadrilateral m front; it gives origin, between the spme and angle to ?he adductor longus; between the spine, angle and thyroid foramen, to the adductor brevis; stretching downwards, about its centre, from below the br^as o the tuberosity, the adductor magnus and veen it and the svmphysis, the gracilis; behind, it is mucti moother 3 c'onv'ex, and affords attachment to the pelvic fascia, levator ani, and Wilson's muscles; exter-OS INNOMINATUM.. 55 nally it is sharp, and forms the boundary of the thyroid hole; inferiorly it becomes continuous with the ascend- ing ramus of the ischium. The OS innominatum, taken as a whole, is developed from eight points of ossification, of which three are pl-i- mitive and five complementary. The three primitive are for the three separate pieces of bone, and are visible in the following order: that of the ilium, about the second month; that for the ischium about the third; and that for the pubis about the fifth. These several portions are not, however, united fully till the fifteenth year. The complementary points are, one for the crest of the ilium; one for the tuberosity of the ischium; one for the anterior superior spinous process; one for the angle of the pubis; and one for the centre of the aceta- bulum. The pelvis, thus constituted by the ossa innominata, the sacrum, and coccyx, forms a whole, remarkable not only for its great strength, but likewise for its extreme lightness. Not situated perpendicularly, but obliquely, owing to the saliency of the sacro-vertebral angle, with its superior outlet looking upwards and forwards, its inferior downwards and backwards, it is admirably adapted both to break the force of sudden shocks transmitted along the vertebral column, as well as to retain securely the contents of the abdomen, by throw- ing them forwards on the arch of the pubis, and not suf- fering them to press too heavily on the less solid struc- tures which complete its inferior aperture. In examin- ing the interior of the pelvis, we are struck at once by a prominent ridge which encircles it about its centre; this is constituted by the pectineal lines laterally, the upper part of the crests of the pubis anteriorly, and the sacral promontory posteriorly. Anatomists have taken advan- tage of this fact to divide the pelvis into two great parts, terming all above the ridge the false pelvis, all below it the true. The former is by far the larger and more expanded, looks upwards and forwards, and is bounded posteriorly by the last lumbar vertebra; late- rally by tUe alae of the ossa ilii, excavated into the iliac fossae; while anteriorly there is no osseous structure, the abdominal muscles filling up the large interval inTHE OSSEOUS SYSTEM. 56 front between the wings; the false pelvis during life is filled up by the iliac and psose muscles, the ccECum and sigmoid flexure, and external iliac arteries. It affords a good indication of the difference of sex, being broad and expanded in the female, while they are much more vertical in the male; in infantile life they are nearly perpendicular and flat. The true pelvis, much smaller than the former, is of an oval figure from side to side; bounded anteriorly by the symphysis pubis and the back part of its descending rami; laterally by the ischium, and those portions of the pubis and ilium en- tering into the formation of the acetabulum; and poste- riorly by the anterior surface of the sacrum and coccyx. Its upper aperture is entirely osseous, presenting nearly a tiniform line, already alluded to as separatmg it from the false pelvis; it looks upwards and forwards. The inferior aperture, directed downwards and back- wards, is very irregular in its outline, presenting a de- ficiency anteriorly between the rami of the ischium and pubis; a well-marked prominence laterally, formed by the tuberosities of the jschia; broad deficiencies behind these, the sciatic notches; and directly posteriorly an eminence constituted by the extremity of the coccyx. A striking difference is visible in both the configuration and size of the true pelvis in the male and female; m the former it is contracted in its circumferential mea- surements, but deep from above downwards; m the latter, on the contrary, its diameters, both conjugate and transverse, are much more extensive, but it is shal- low from above downwards. These differences naturally depend on the functions which the opposite sexes are called on to perform in the offices of procreation. The true pelvis in the male contains the bladder m front, the rectum behind; and in addition to these the prostate aland, vesicute seminales, terminations of the ureters and vasa deferentia; sacral plexus of nerves; internal iliac arteries and their branches; levatores am; pyri- formus, and obturator internus muscles. In the temale, in addition to the bladder and rectum, the uterus, with its broad ligaments, containing the round ligament, ovaries, and Fallopian tubes, with the nerves, arteries, and muscles already enumerated m the male.57 PELVIS. In examining the exterior aspect of the pelvis it is better to divide it into four regions—an anterior, pos- terior, and two lateral. The anterior region may be said to occupy that space intercepted between two verti- cal lines drawn between the pubal eminence above, and the anterior part of the tuberosity of the ischium below. On it we observe two well-formed arches; a superior, its pillars constituted by the horizontal rami of the pubis, supported by the acetabula on either side; an in- ferior, its pillars formed by the rami of both ischium and pubis, and terminating at the tuberosities. A trian- gular interval, broader in the female than in the male for obvious reasons, separates the pillars of the inferior arch, filled up above by the subpubic, and below by the triangular ligament. These structures, stretched tensely across, serve to give great security to the arch, and, without interfering with the important parts which pass through it, bestow on it extreme lightness, with sufficient strength. External to this we have another deficiency in the pelvic wall; the obturator foramen, of an oval shape, broader above than below, bounded in- ternally, inferiorly, and externally by the ischium; superiorly by the pubis. In its natural condition it is completed by the obturator membrane, a strong tense process of fibrous tissue which fills it up altogether, except superiorly where an oblique canal is left di- rected forwards and inwards for the transmission of its own artery, nerve, and vein. In this instance nature has aga,in added considerably to the lightness of the bone without detracting materially from its strength. The lateral region of the pelvis is that portion inter- cepted between the pubal eminence and anterior part of the tuberosity of the ischium in front, and the edge of the sacrum behind. It presents superiorly and ante- riorly the acetabulum formed by the proportions of the several bones already enumerated; its border not pre- senting an horizontal plane, but elevated superiorly opposite the ala of the ilium; depressed posteriorly at the junction of the ischium with the last-named bone; again prominent opposite the tuberosity; excavated into a deep notch at the thyroid foramen; elevated at d358 THE OSSEOUS SYSTEM. the pubal eminence, and again depressed a little pos- terior to this process. The acetabulum is a deep and cup-like cavity, covered with cartilage of incrustation, except inferiorly and internally opposite the notch, where it is deficient, constituting about one-fourth of the whole, and in figure resembling the ace of spades; the aspect of this cavity is downwards, forwards, and outwards, and it articulates with the head of the femur. Below and behind the acetabulum we have the tubero- sity, a well-marked process, which supports the body when in a sitting position; it is exceedingly rough for the attachment of the muscles already mentioned m the description of the separate bone. Behmdthe tuberosity is the excavation for the lesser sciatic notch, converted into a foramen by the greater sciatic ligament passing forwards and inwards to be inserted into the tuber. This is traversed by the obturator muscle, its nerve and the pudic vessels and nerve. Still more posteriorly is the greater sciatic notch, bounded anteriorly by the ischium,.superiorly by the ilium, posteriorly by the sacrum, and inferiorly by both greater and lesser sciatic ligaments. This is traversed by the pyriformis muscle, which may be said to divide it into two parts, an upper and lower, through the one passes the gluteal vessels and nerves, and through the other the pudic and sciatic arteries, with all the external branches of the sacral plexus. The appearance of the posterior region of the pelvis has been already noticed in the description of the sacrum and coccyx. If we examine the pelvis in early infancy, it presents the following peculiarities :-It is much more oblique, its superior aperture looking almost directly forwards, extremely contracted in all its dimensions, so much so as to be incapable of containing at this period the bladder, which lies in the lower part of the abdomen. Its al^ likewise are nearly straight; the sacrum vertical and narrow, while the horizontal rami of the pubis are ex- ceedingly short. This gives rise to the peculiar position of the acetabula, which are placed more anteriorly than in adolescence, being at the same time remarkably shallow. In old age the pelvis again becomes very59 FEMUR. oblique, but this obliquity is counteracted by the bend in the knees, which is the usual characteristic of ad- vanced life. Femur.—This is a long bone, and is the largest of its class in the whole human body; it is also the strongest, as it is destined fb support the weight of the entire trunk. In order to examine it properly it will be necessary to divide it into a head, neck, greater and lesser tuberosities, shaft, and two condyles. The head of the bone is globular, forming about three- fourths of a sphere, covered with cartilage, except infe- rior and posterior to the centre, where a deficiency exists for the attachment of the ligamentum teres. A very irregular wavy line limits the head, which articu- lates with the acetabulum of the pelvis. The neck of the bone is of a triangular figure, its apex above conti- nuous with the head; its base below and without rest^ ing upon two ridges; one anterior, long, but badly marked, to which the capsular ligament is attached, the anterior intertrochanteric line; the other posterior and exceedingly prominent, affording insertion to the quadratus femoris, the posterior intertrochanteric line. The axis of the neck is very oblique, directed upwards, forwards, and inwards, forming an obtuse angle with the shaft; concave on its upper surface to permit the lip of the acetabulum to lodge in it in motions of ex- treme abduction; rounded inferiorly, where we find a thick lamina of compact tissue, flattened anteriorly, and short,, corresponding to the cervical ligament; longer posteriorly and slightly concave, where it gives inser- tion to the capsular and the ligament before mentioned. Several foramina for the passage of the nutritious ves- sels are visible on this surface towards its lower part. It will be observed that the vertical diameter of the neck is much greater than its antero-posterior, an im- portant provision of nature in giving strength to the bone in that direction in which fracture would be most liable to occur. Oa the upper and posterior part of the neck, near its outer extremity, is a deep fossa, bounded externally by the great trochanter. This is the digital depression which gives insertion to the cap- sular muscles in the following order:—Most superiorlyTHE OSSEOUS SYSTEM. 60 tlie pyriformis; then the superior gemellus; then the obturator internus; then the inferior gemellus; and lastly, the obturator externus. On the outer and upper part of the shaft is the great trochanter, quadri- lateral in shape, higher posteriorly than anteriorly, in- clined inwards so as to overlap the neck; rough exter- nally and covered by a large bursa, over which the crlutseus maximus glides; on its upper edge are two facettes, the most posterior for the insertion of the glu- teus medius; the anterior for that of the glutseus mini- mus. The lesser trochanter is much smaller m size and conical in shape, situated on the internal and posterior part of the bone on a plane inferior to the greater; its apex is rounded, and is covered by a small bursa, over which the conjoined tendons of the psoas and iliacus glide to be inserted into its root inferiorly; anteriorly at its junction with the shaft there is a rough concave de- pression for the insertion of the accessory ligament of the hip-joint; and posteriorly it gives origin to the vastus internus. The shaft of the bone is cylindrical in shape, expanded above and below; contracted in the centre; twisted inwards, presenting for examination four surfaces—an anterior, internal, external, and pos- terior Of these the anterior is convex from above downwards; generally rounded, but rather flat supe- riorly and inferiorly; its superior three-fourths gives attachment to the crurasus; its inferior to the subcru- reeus. Externally it is nearly straight, affording origin to the vastus externus for its whole length. Int^naUy it is concave, and has the vastus internus attached to it Its posterior surface is concave, and presents m its middle third an elevated ridge or crest, the Imeaaspera; its upper extremity bifurcates into two roots; a long one externally, which connects it to the great tro- chanter; a shorter one internally which unites it to the lesser- to the first is attached from without inwards the vastus externus, glutasus maximus, and adductor macrnus; to the second from within outward, the vastus internus, pectineus, and adductor brevis. The linea aspera itself presents two lips: an external, affording attachment to the vastus externus and gluteus max- imus with the short head of biceps, the latter muscleFEMUH. 61 arising where the insertion of the former terminates; its internal lip to the vastus internns adductor longus magnus. Its inferior extremity likewise bifurcates into two roots: an external, rough and well-marked, and terminating at the external condyle for the attach- ment of the vastus externus and biceps; an internal, only visible above and below, but smooth in the centre for the femoral artery to glide over it, and running to the inner condyle, has connected to it the vastus in- ternus and adductor magnus. At the inner side of the linea aspera, a little below the centre of the bone, is the large hole for the nutritious artery, passing up- wards and forwards; this is sometimes double.° The lower part of the femur continues to increase gradually in size till it terminates in the two condyles, in struc- ture becoming exceedingly cellular; anteriorly it is broad and concave, perforated by several foramina, and sometimes covered by a bursa, over which the subcru- rseus glides. Posteriorly it is flattened and triangular m figure, corresponding to the popliteal region, and presenting two roughened spaces above the condyle for the origin of the plantaris and outer head of the gas- trocnemius externally, and for the inner head of the latter muscle internally. The bone is more expanded on Its outside than its inside, where it is covered by the aponeurosis of the two vasti. The two condyles which occupy the inferior extremity of the femur are large and prolonged backwards, separated from each other by a space in front; broad, concave, and covered with cartilage for articulation with the patella; a simi- lar space likewise exists posteriorly, but it is deeper and narrower, not covered with cartilage, and in the natural condition of the parts filled with fat, alFordino- insertion to the crucial and mucous ligaments. The two condyles, if contrasted with each other, present the following difference: the internal is thinner, longer and proceeds much farther backwards, while the ex- ternal IS much thicker, advances prominently forwards and is covered with cartilage much higher up. On the outer side of the last, interiorly and posteriorly is si- tuated a small eminence for the attachment of the external lateral ligament, and beneath it a groove for62 THE OSSEOUS SYSTEM. the origin of the poplit^us muscle. Internally it is rough for the insertion of the anterior crucial liga- ment. A much larger tubercle is visible on the inter- nal condyle; to it is attached the adductor magnus above, and the internal lateral ligament below; on its outer surface it is also rough for the insertion of the posterior crucial ligament. The femur articulates with three bones—the os innominatum above, and the tibia and patella below. It is developed from five points of ossification. Of these, three are primitive; one for the shaft apparent about the sixth week; one for the lower portion, visible about a fortnight before birth, and one for the head, which is not developed till a year after birth. The two complementary points are .for the greater and lesser trochanters; that for the first makes its appearance about the fourth, that for the second, about the twelftli, year. All those separate points are united about the age of twenty. _ There are certain modifications existing m the femur which have a reference to its upper portion, dependent on both sex and age. In the festal bone, the neck is a mere extension of the shaft, both forming a contmuous line; in the female, on the contrary, it is longer, nar- rower, and placed more at a right angle with the shatt; in old age it is shortened considerably, is much weaker, and as in the female, springs also at right angles Irom the bone. In making a longitudinal section o_t the neck of the femur, we observe that it is cellular m its character, except inferiorly, where a dense arch of com- pact tissue passes upwards and inwards to the head. A change takes place in old age from the effects of inter- stitial absorption, which enlarges the cells, and renders the compact tissue more porous, producmg a conse- quent liability to fracture at that period of life de- nendino- on diminished cohesion. , , , ^ Patella, or, as it is sometimes called, Rotula, belongs to the class of sesamoid bones, being developed in the tendon of the rectus. It may, however, be said to differ from sesamoid bones generally, from its greater size and from its being found on the angle of extension, and not flexion, as the others of the same description are. It presents for examination an anterior and posteriorTIBIA. 63 surface, and a circumference. The anterior surface is rough, convex, and marked by a number of vertical lines or strife. It is covered by a dense fibrous struc- ture, derived from the tendon of the rectus and fascia lata of the thigh. Its posterior surface has a vertical ridge in the centre, corresponding to the trochlea of the femur, dividing it into two portions, both covered with cartilage; the external, the larger, to articulate with the outer condyle; the internal, narrower, to articulate with the inner. Its circumference presents the figure of a curvilinear triangle, flattened and thick superiorly, affording attachment to the rectus and cru- rasus; sharp and convex on its inner and outer border, for the attachment of the vasti, and pointed inferiorly for the origin of the ligamentum patellae. It articulates with the femur only, and is developed from a single point of ossification, which is visible between the second and third.year. Tibia.—This is another of the long bones, and is next to the femur in size and strength. We will examine it by dividing it into a shaft, upper and lower extremity. The upper extremity presents two articular facettes for the condyles of the femur; they are both covered with cartilage, but they differ from each other in the follow- ing particulars: the internal is oval from before back- wards, deeply concave, and looks upwards, backwards, and inwards; the external is comparatively flat, more circular in figure, and looks upwards, backwards, and outwards. These articular facettes are deepened for the reception of the femur by the semilunar carti- lages, and are separated from each other by an ir- regular crest of bone, extending from before back- wards, and terminating in a prominent point towards its posterior and inner part, inclined upwards and inwards; this is the spine, anterior and posterior to which is a pit or depression for the attachment of the crucial ligaments and cornua of the semilunar car- tilages. The anterior part of the head of the bone is of a triangular shape, the base above and apex below formed by an elevated process which is called the tu- bercle, into which the ligamentum patellee is inserted. The surface alluded to is rough, perforated by severalTUE OSSEOUS SYSTEM. 64 foramina for the nutritious vessels, and corresponds to the Haversian gland, which separates it from the ligament. The posterior part is flattened, and co- vered by the ligamentum posticum of Winslow. Pos- teriorly and externally we observe a circular facette looking downwards, backwards, and outwards, to arti- culate with the fibula; still more anteriorly a rough portion for the second slip of the external lateral liga- ment. On the inner part of the bone is a deep channel or groove, leading from behind forwards for the tendon of the semi-membranosus which is attached to its ante- rior part, immediately beneath the internal lateral liga- ment. The shaft is prismatic in shape in its four supe- rior fifths, qiiadrilateral in its inferior, and twisted out- wards. It accordingly presents three margins: an an- terior, external, and internal, with as many surfaces. The anterior, commonly known as the crest or shin, commences above at the tubercle, passes downwards, forming a wavy line, sharpest in the centre, till it reaches the inferior fourth, where it becomes flattened out and gradually lost in the smooth surface below. The external margin, not so prominent, begins above, anterior to the facette for the fibula; extends down- wards until it arrives at a point about two inches . above the inferior extremity of the tibia, when it bitur- cates to form the anterior and posterior lips ol t ie groove for the fibula; to this margin is attached the interosseous ligament. The internal edge is badly marked; it reaches from the head down to the back part of the internal malleolus, giving attachment to the deep fascia of the leg. Of its three surfaces the mter- nal is the smoothest; it is slightly convex above, and concave below; immediately below and behind the tuber- cle the sartoriusis inserted; a little lower, and still more posteriorly, the gracilis; and still more interiorly and posteriorly the semi-tendinosus; in the rest ol its extent it is subcutaneous. The external surlace is con- cave above, convex below, giving attachment by its two superior thirds to one muscle only, the tibialis anticus. The posterior surface is comparatively flat, and presents in its superior fifth an oblique line or ridge, extending downwards and inwards; into this, and the space above65 TIBIA. it, is inserted the poplitasus muscle; below the line and internally is the hole for the nutritious artery, and for a distance of two inches arises the inner head of solceus, and external and inferior to this, for a variable distance, the flexor digitorum communis. The bone for its inferior fifth is quadrilateral, and accordingly presents four surfaces,—an anterior, posterior, external, and internal. The anterior is rounded and smooth for the extensors tendons to glide over; it gives attachment by its inferior lip to the anterior ligament of the ankle- joint; posteriorly it is much flatter, and on it we ob- serve two remarkable grooves, both extending down- wards and inwards; the internal is exceedingly deep for the tendon of the tibialis posticus and flexor com- munis ; the external is scai'cely ever well marked for the passage of the tendon of the flexor pollicis longus. The external surface presents a triangular notch,—the base below, the apex above, for the reception of the lower end of the fibula. The internal is prolonged into a quadrilateral process—the internal malleolus, smooth superficially where it can be felt beneath the skin and fascia, covered with cartilage towards the joint, where it articulates with the astragalus, roiigh and prolonged anteriorly, for the attachment of the anterior annular ligament; thicker and shorter posteriorly for aff'ording insertion to the posterior annular and inferior tibio- fibular ligament, occasionally grooved inferiorly for the internal lateral ligament of the joint. The lower extremity of the tibia is quadrilateral in shape, convex from side to side, concave from before backwards. The convexity is due to a ridge which traverses it in an an- tero-posterior direction, dividing it into two facettes, of which the external is oblong in shape; its length from before backwards exceeding that of the internal; the cartilage of incrustation which covers it is likewise prolonged into the tibio-fibular articulation. The in- ternal facette is more quadrilateral, and is bounded in- ternally by the articular surface of the internal malle- olus. The anterior and posterior lips of bone which bound the astragaloid surface of the tibia are of unequal length, the latter extending lower down than the for- mer, which is concave in its outline. It may also beTHE OSSEOUS SYSTEM. 66 observed that the internal malleolus is on a plane ante- rior to the external and also to the internal condyle, in consequence of the twisting of the bone. The tibia articulates with three bones: the femur above, the fibula laterally, and the astragalus below. It is developed from three points of ossification: one for the shaft, which appears about the sixth week; one for the lower, and one for the upper extremity both of these latter are visible from the first to the second year. There has occasionally been found a fourth com- plementary point for the tubercle. The union of these several parts is not completed till the twentieth or twenty-first year. Fibula Is the most slender of all the long bones, and seems to be placed in the leg, not for the purpose of bestowing additional strength, but to afford a broader basis for the attachment of muscles, and to complete the peculiar mortice-joint which the ankle presents. Like all of the same class, it may be divided into a shaft and two extremities. Of these last the upper is usually called the head. This is of a conical figure, termi- nating superiorly and posteriorly in a pointed process, into which is inserted the tendon of the biceps and ex- ternal lateral ligament. Internally and anteriorly co- vered with cartilage, and presenting a concave facette, looking upwards, forwards, and inwards, to articulate with the tibia; rough anteriorly and posteriorly for the attachment of the tibio-fibular ligaments. The shaft is prismatic in shape, presenting an anterior well-marked edge, which gives attachment to the intermuscular sep- tum, between the muscles attached to the external and anterior part of the bone; it stretches from the head downwards to within two or three inches of the mal- leolus, where it bifurcates into two lines, one of which forms the anterior, and the other the posterior boun- dary of that process. The internal ridge is also promi- nent, but deficient in its superior and inferior fifths; it affords attachment to the interosseous ligament. Ihe external may be said to exist only in its inferior four- fifths, and has connected to it the deep fascia of the leg. Of the three surfaces of the bone one is internal and anterior, concave, traversed from above downwardsFIBULA, 67 by a vertical ridge dividing it into two parts; from its three superior fourths the extensor digitorum communis takes its origin; from its middle third, but on a plane posterior to the last, the extensor pollicis arises, and to its inferior half, but anterior to the other two, the pe- ronffius antieus is attached. The external surface is rounded and slightly convex; from its upper third the peronfEus longus arises, and immediately below it the peronseus brevis; still lower down the bone is subcu- taneous. Its posterior surface is contracted above, ex- panded in the centre, and again constricted below; su- periorly the long head of the soloeus is attached; along its inner margin for a great part of its length, the tibi- alis posticus, and more externally for its inferior two- thirds, the flexor pollicis longus. The lower part of the bone expands into the external malleolus. This is of a conical shape, gradually diminishing to a point be- low ; it is exceedingly thick, rounded, and subcutaneous externally, fitted closely into the groove of the tibia internally; flattened and covered with cartilage; still lower down, where it articulates with the astragalus, comparatively sharp and prominent anteriorly, where the anterior slip of the external lateral and anterior an- nular ligaments are connected to it; broad and grooved posteriorly for the tendons of the perontei; pointed in- feriorly and posteriorly for the origin of the posterior slip of the external lateral ligament, and hollowed out immediately internal to this for the middle slip. The fibula articulates with two bones only, the tibia and astragalus, but at two points with the former bone. It is developed from three points of ossification, one for the shaft, which is visible about the seventh or eighth year, one for the upper portion, which appears about the fifth year, and one for the lower extremity, about the second. The wliole are united from the twentieth to the twenty-fifth year. The Foot.—This portion of the skeleton, exactly as the hand, is composed of several bones of different sizes, united firmly to each other by ligament; but as it is destined to support the weight of the whole trunk, it is natural to expect that the osseous parts entering into its formation should be on a much larger and stronger68 THE OSSEOUS SYSTEM. scale than in the hand, the function of which is pre- hension. To adapt it to this office we accordingly find that the phalanges are exceedingly long, while in the foot they are comparatively short; the metatarsal bones of the latter are also lengthened and strong, for they assist in supporting the body, especially in progression, while in the metacarpal bones of the latter, Avhich cor- respond to them, we observe a marked contrast both in length and strength. But it is in the carpus of the one and the tarsus of the other, that the most striking dif- ference prevails; the first being remarkable, with a single exception, for their diminutive size and delicacy of their contiguous surfaces ; the second, for their rnag- nitude, and the broad facettes by which they are united to each other. Anatomists have divided the foot into three distinct parts: the tarsus, comprising the astragalus, os calcis, navicular or scaphoid, cuboid, and three cuneiform bones; the metacarpus, consisting of five; and the pha- langes, which are fourteen in number, the great toe, as the thumb, being deficient in the second. We shall describe each in the order as we have enumerated them, commencing with the astragalus. Astragalus.—This belongs to the class of round or irregular bones, and is one of the highest in the tarsus. In shape it is rather quadrilateral, presenting for exami- nation two surfaces, a superior and inferior; two sides, an external andinternal; and two extremities, an anterior and posterior. On examining its superior surface we observe on it a large facette, covered with cartilage, looking upwards, backwards, and inwards; convex from before backwards, concave from side to side; its exter- nal lip much more prominent than its internal, limited behind by a superficial groove, to which is attached a thin layer of areolar tissue, by some described as the posterior ligament of the joint; bounded anteriorly by a depression much broader, the neck, Avhich is perfo- rated by several foramina for the nutritious vessels, and affording insertion to the anterior ligament, and by its outer edge to the anterior slip of the external late- ral. This facette, much wider in front than behind, articulates with the lower extremity of the tibia. TheASTHAGALUS. 69 inferior surface is larger than the superior; it is marked by twofacettes; one posterior and external, oval in shape, concave, looking downwards, forwards, and inwards; the other anterior and internal, likewise of an oval figure, slightly convex, looking directly downwards, much smaller than the other, both covered with cartilage to articulate with corresponding surfaces on theoscalcis; a deep sulcus leading from within, forwards, and out- wards, much larger externally than internally, sepa- rates them, giving attachment to the powerful inter- osseous ligaments that unite the bones together. The external margin is very irregular in its appearance; behind it presents an articulating surface for the ex- ternal malleolus, triangular in shape, the base above, the apex below; concave from above downwards, slightly convex from before backwards; bounded behind and in- feriorly by a rough ridge for the insertion of the poste- rior slip of the external lateral ligament; anteriorly it is scooped out, forming a deep depression, correspond- ing to the side of the neck of the bone. The facette on the internal margin, for the internal malleolus, dif- fers in size and shape from the preceding; it is much smaller, auricular in form, and a little convex. It is bounded below by a wavy groove, studded with fora- mina for the entrance of the nutritious vessels, and be- coming continuous with the neck in front; below and behind is the ridge for the insertion of tlae posterior portion of the internal lateral ligament. If we now ex- amine the anterior extremity of the bone, we will ob- serve a well-marked convex head, forming about one- third of a sphere, oval in shape, long from above and without, downwards, and inwards, covered with carti- lage ; its aspect forwards, inwards, and downwards to articulate with the scaphoid. Its posterior extremity terminates in a well-marked tubercle, internal to which is a deep groove, directed downwards and inwards, through which the tendon of the flexor poUicis glides. The astragalus articulates with four bones: the tibia above and internally, the fibula externally; the os calcis below, and the scaphoid in front. It should, however, be recollected that it has six facettes, as both the tibia and calcis unite with it at two distinct points.THE OSSEOUS SYSTEM. 70 Os Calcis.—Thislikewise belongs to the round bones, and is the largest of all those constituting the tarsus, lying immediately inferior to the last described. It is of an oblong shape, presenting four surfaces: a supe- rior, inferior, external, and internal, and two extremi- ties,' an anterior and posterior. Of the surfaces we will first examine the superior. If we take its two anterior thirds we will observe on it the two facettes to unite with the astragalus; one anterior and internal, supported by a peculiar process, the sustentaculum tali; it is oval in shape and concave, looking directly upwards; the other larger, of the same figure, convex, looking up- wards, forwards, and inwards, both covered with carti- lao-e, and separated by a sulcus shallower than that ot the astralagus for the interosseous ligaments Behind, the bone is prolonged into a process called the calx or heel- the inferior surface is comparatively narrow; be- hind it presents two tubercles, giving origin to the strono- plantar fascia, and beneath it to the abductor pollicts internally; the abductor minimi digiti exter- nally, and the flexor digitorum brevis m the centre. Advancing forward we find the bone becoming rough and rounded, giving attachment on either side to the forked head of the musculus accessorius, and between them to the superficial portion of the calcareo-cuboid lia-ament. Still more anteriorly there is another tu- bercle, to which is connected the deeper portion of the calcaneo-cuboid ligament and outer head of the flexor noUicis. The external surface is broad posteriorly, nar- rower anteriorly; a little behind its centi^ is the tu- bercle for the inseition of the middle slip oi the exter- na lateral ligament; and in front of the tubercle is occasionally visible a superficial groove for the peronjei tendons The remainder of it is subcutaneous. Ihe internal surface presents a well-formed arch, constituted principally by the sustentaculum, which juts out con- Sably Tbe inner margin of this process is grooved ; nto it is inserted the internal lateral bgament, and over ts insertion the tendons of the tibialis posticu. and flexor digitorum communis glide to their insertion. More eSernally but mfenorly, where this Focess j^ns with the side of the bone, is a deeper sulcus, conti-SCAPHOID. 71 nuous with that on the back part of the astragalus, for the tendon of the flexor pollicis longus. Beneath this it is concave, and in the natural condition of the parts is filled with fat and loose areolar tissue, giving insertion behind and below to the posterior annular ligament. The posterior extremity of the bone is ovoid in figure, convex; smooth above where a bursa rests; rough inferiorly for the attachment of the tendo Achillis, and more internally to that of the plantaris; anteriorly, much more contracted in size, covered with cartilage, concave from above downwards, convex from side to side, and cut off obliquely from without backwards and inwards for articulation with the cuboid. The os calcis articulates with two bones; above by two points, some- times three, with the astragalus, and in front with the cuboid. Scaphoid—This bone has received its name from its shape, resembling in some measure a boat or canoe. Strictly speaking it is of an ovoid figure, broad supe- riorly and externally, narrow and pointed inferiorly and internally, where it affords insertion to the tendon of the tibialis posticus muscle. In examining it we give it a posterior and anterior surface and a circumference. The posterior surface is oval and concave, covered with cartilage, and receives the head of the astragalus; the anterior is irregularly convex, and marked by three fa- cettes, of which the internal is the largest; triangular in shape, the apex above, the base below; convex from above downwards for articulating with the internal cuneiform. The second or middle is also triangular, but its base, which is situated superiorly, is broader than that of the first; it is also shorter from above down- wards, not so convex, and unites with the middle cunei- form. The third or external is similar to the last de- scribed in figure, but intermediate in size between it and the first; it articulates with the external cuneiform. If we look now to its upper part, we will find it to be rough and convex for the attachment of the dorsal liga- ments for connecting it to the adjacent bones. The in- ternal surface is much flatter, and gives insertion to the anterior slip of the internal lateral ligament. This sur-72 THE OSSEOUS SYSTEM. face is prolonged into the process already alluded to for the insertion of the tibialis posticus and calcaneo-sca- phoid ligament, of surgical importance in amputation of the foot. The external sometimes presents an arti- cular facette for the cuboid, but this is not always ma- nifest. The scaphoid articulates with four bones: the astra- galus posteriorly, and the three cuneiform anteriorly. The Cuboid.—This bone is situated on the outside ot the foot, and is very thick as contrasted with the pre- ceding. It also presents two surfaces: a posterior and an anterior, and a circumference. The posterior exhibits an articular facette for the os calcis, covered with carti- lao-e, convex from above downwards; concave from side topside. The anterior is cut ofiP obliquely from withm, backwards and outwards, and has on it two facettes, separated by a slight ridge; the internal is_ verti- cally oval, slightly concave, and articulates with the extremity of the fourth metatarsal bone ; the exter- nal is larger, rounder, and flat, cut off obliquely, so as to form an obtuse angle with the preceding, for uniting with the fifth. The upper part of its circum- ference is irregularly quadrilateral and rough, broad internally, constricted externally; having attached to it the dorsal ligaments for the contiguous bones, and givintr origin to a slip of the extensor brevis. i he ex- !ernaT surface is very small, and presents a hp anteriorly and posteriorly, separated by the commencement of the groove for the tendon of the perona3US longus; to these lips ligaments are likewise attached. The inferior sur- face has anteriorly the continued groove for the peroneal tendon, directed forwards and inwards; more posteriorly it is quadrilateral and elevated, covered with cartilage, affording attachment to the two portions of the calcaneo- cuboid ligament, and insertion to a slip ot the tibialis posticus. Internally the bone becomes expanded, its two anterior thirds are covered with cartilage, to articulate with the external cuneiform; and a facette is visible on its posterior third, where it is in contact with the sca- phoid, but not invariably. ti„. The cuboid articulates with four bones or five; the73 THE MIDDLE CUNEIFORM. OS calcis posteriorly; the fourth and fifth metatarsal bones anteriorly; and the external cuneiform and scaphoid internally. Internal Cuneiform—This bone is of a triangular shape, the base being situated inferiorly, the thin portion superiorly. It presents for examination a pos- terior and anterior extremity, an internal and external surface, and a superior and inferior margin. The pos- terior extremity presents an ovoid facette, wider below than above, concave, and covered with cartilage, to articulate with the scaphoid ; the anterior is likeAvise marked by one similar in shape, longer, and slightly concave from above downwards; convex from side to side, to unite with the metatarsal bone of the great toe; the internal surface is rather quadrilateral,°flat- tened but rough, giving attachment by its margins to ligaments which connect it to the adjacent bones, and towards its anterior and inferior part to the tendon of the tibialis anticus; externally it presents two facettes, separated by a slight ridge, the posterior triangular, for uniting with the middle cuneiform; the anterior, more oval, for the side of the metatarsal bone of the second toe; below these it is rough for the interosseous liga- ments ; superiorly it is sharp, and convex where it enters into the formation of the arch of the foot; inferiorly, broad and expanded, and presents towards its anterior part a tubercle for the attachment of the tibialis pos- ticus; a few fibres of the peron^us longus are likewise inserted into its outer edge. The internal cuneiform articulates with four bones: the scaphoid posteriorly, the first metatarsal bone an- teriorly, and the middle cuneiform and second metatar- sal bone externally. Middle Cuneiform.—This is nearly of the same shape as the last, but it is much smaller, and its base, which is turned upwards, is nearly perfectly quadrila- teral. It presents, like the preceding, a posterior and anterior extremity, an internal and external surface, a base, and an apex. On the posterior extremity we ob- serve a facette, broad above, narrow below, covered with cartilage, for articulation with the scaphoid; on • the anterior, another of the same shape, but slightly £THE OSSEOUS SYSTEM. 74 convex for the second metatarsal bone; on its internal side is a small triangular facette, for uniting with the internal, and on its outer side a similar one for the ex- ternal cuneiform bones; these are of a triangular shape and small, situated near the upper margins, while the lower part of each surface is very rough, for the attach- ment of ligaments. Its apex presents a sharp, well- defined edge, which is concealed by the approximation of the two bones on either side, while its base is almost flat, but rough for the attachment of ligaments. It articulates with four bones also: the scaphoid be- hind, the second metatarsal bone in front, and the inter- nal and external cuneiform bones laterally. The External Cuneiform is intermediate in size be- tween the two last described, and presents for examina- tion the same parts. On its posterior extremity we observe a plane, oval facette, covered with cartilage, for articu- lation with the scaphoid; on its anterior another, trian- gular and slightly convex,for the third metatarsal bone; on its internal surface it has two, one posteriorly, for the middle cuneiform, and one anteriorly, for the second metatarsal bone; on its external two are likewise ob- served the posterior, large, flat, and triangular, for the cuboid; and an anterior, much smaller, oval, for the fourth metatarsal bone; its apex, which is turned down- wards, is more rounded than that of the preceding, affording origin to one head of the flexor pollicis brevis; its base, forming a part of the dorsum of the foot, is rough for the insertion of ligaments. The external cuneiform articulates with six bones: the scaphoid posteriorly; the third metatarsal an- teriorly; the second metatarsal and middle cuneiform internally; and the fourth metatarsal and cuboid ex- ternally. T 1 jr All the tarsal bones just described are developed trom a single point of ossification, with the exception of the OS calcis, which has two ; the first being primitive for the anterior part, and the second for the calx or The Metatarsal Bones are five in number, and all belong to the class of long bones. Their posterior extre- mities are thick and clubbed, and articulate with the tar-THE METATARSAL BONES. sal bones; their anterior, also espanded, but rounded, to articulate with the first phalanx. The shaft is con- stricted and prismatic, narrow above and below; con- cave inferiorly, convex superiorly; the sides flattened and opposed to each other, and giving origin to the in- terossei muscles. If we now examine the peculiarities which each presents, we will find them to be the follow- ing:—The first may be at once distinguished by its greater shortness and thickness; its posterior extremity is marked by a large, oval, concave facette, where it unites with the internal cuneiform bone; externally a small articulating surface is visible on it, where it is in contact with the second metatarsal bone; superiorly and internally it affords insertion to the tibialis anti- cus; inferiorly and externally is a tubercle, for the attachment of the tendon of the peronseus longus, while the rest of its circumference is rough for the ligaments which connect it to the internal cuneiform posteriorly; its shaft is remarkable for its extreme thickness; while its anterior extremity, rounded and covered with cartilage, to articulate Avith the first phalanx, pre- sents on either side two tubercles, for the attachment of the lateral ligaments which connect it to that bone. The second metatarsal bone is remarkable for its great length, which results from the manner in Avhich'^it is wedged in between the three cuneiform bones; present^ ing not only a concave facette on its posterior extre- mity, for articulation with the second, but likewise smaller ones on each side, where it is in contact with the first and third, as well as with the corresponding meta- tarsal bones. The upper part of its tarsal extremity is broad and rough, for the attachment of ligaments; its lower marked by a small tubercle, for the insertion of an offset of the peroneal tendon. Its shaft is thin and prismatic, and terminates in a head of the same shape, but smaller than that of the preceding. ' The third metatarsal bone is shorter than the last and like it, has three facettes posteriorly: one on its extremity, triangular, but nearly flat, for articulation with the third cuneiform bone, and one on either side, for the adjacent metatarsal bones. Its upper surface is E 2/ 76 THE OSSEOUS SYSTEM. broader, the lower sharper, than those of the preceding; the one for the attachment of the dorsal ligament, and the other for the plantar, as well as some fibres of the tendon of the tibialis posticus. Its shaft and head pre- sent no marked difference from the preceding. The fourth metatarsal bone is about the same length as the last, but rather more slender. On it we also ob- serve three facettes: one posterior, quadrilateral in shape, flat, rounded below, convex, to articulate with the cuboid; one on either side, the internal being much the larger, as it unites not only with the adjacent metatarsal bone, but likewise with the external cunei- form ; while the external is very small, for the fifth metatarsal only. Its upper and lower parts are both rough for ligaments. The shaft and head are similar in appearance to the preceding. The fifth metatarsal bone has the following pecu- liarities at its posterior extremity: it is cut ofl" ob- liquely from within backwards and outwards ; covered with cartilase on its inner two-thirds, forming a trian- gular facette for articulation with the cuboid; its exter- nal third is prolonged backwards and outwards into a remarkable process—the spur, which afi"ords insertion to the tendons of the peron^us brevis and anticus. Its inner portion is occupied by a small facette, where it is in contact with the fourth metatarsal, while its outer is roucrli. for the insertion of the external slip of the plan- tar ^fascia. It is broad and irregular superiorly, for the dorsal ligaments; of a similar character interiorly, where it afiTords origin to the flexor brevis minimi digiti.

Into the base of the second phalanx is inserted inferiorly the flexor pollicis longus; superiorly its exten- sor. The corresponding rows of the four outer toes present a striking resemblance to the former, so that they can only be distinguished from each other by their size, as they imperceptibly become smaller from the second to the fifth. Posteriorly they are excavated, forming cups for the reception of the heads of the ad- jacent bones; anteriorly rounded and convex, and divided on their under surface into two small condyles, xvhich are accurately adapted to similar facettes on the contiguous phalanges. The last is very peculiar, from its constriction in the centre, and its expanded extre- mities. At their distal and proximal ends, laterally, are the tubercles, for the attachments of the lateral ligaments; superiorly they are invested by the aponeu- rosis of the long extensor tendons; inferiorly they form the anterior part of the sheath in which the flexor ten- dons work; the base of the first giving insertion to the lumbricales and interossei; the middle of the second to the flexor brevis; and the base of the third to the flexor longus. The bones of both the metatarsus and phalanges are developed from two points of ossification: one for the shafts, and one for the posterior extremities. They are visible at varying periods before birth, but are not completely united till the eighteenth or twen- tieth year. The foot, the great point of support of the whole body, is remarkable for its extreme strength, combined with an extent of elasticity which imparts a facility of motion and springiness in progression which man pos- sesses in an eminent degree. It is of a triangular shape, the apex turned posteriorly, the base in front; but be- cause three points only meet the ground when resting upon it, it has been compared to a tripod; the posterior78 THE OSSEOUS SYSTEM. leg being represented by the os calcis; the two ante- rior externally by the base of the little toe, internally, by that of the great. Between these the bones form three remarkable arches, that on the inside being much the longest, strongest, and most curved, because on it the principal weight of the foot is thrown when in pro- gression. The deep excavation which here naturally exists in almost all individuals is commonly known as the hollow of the foot. The external arch wants the convexity of the last; it is much shorter, weaker, and in some presents almost a plane surface—such being termed flat-footed. The transverse arch extends be- tween the balls of the great and little toe; it is the shortest of the three, but extremely elastic and move- able, readily adapting itself to the inequalities which it may meet with, and again resuming its original shape where these cease to exist. It can readily be imagined what a tendency those arches must possess in breaking those shocks to which we are daily so liable, and of which we are scarcely sensible, unless in an un- conscious moment, when the foot, unprepared for such an occurrence, slips suddenly from an elevation into a depression; the shock striking the os calcis only, and not the arches, is propagated upwards along the limb, losing, no doubt, much of its intensity at each jomt and angle of curvature, but still is severe enough to cause some unpleasant feelings in the highest part of the framework of the human skeleton. We will avoid men- tioning here the peculiar cushions which nature has placed beneath the feet of the tripod, or the powerful apparatus by which these are maintained m position, as these will appear more properly in a different part of the work. -n ^ If we now look to the dorsum of the foot, we will ob- serve that it is likewise arched, the convexity varying essentially in different individuals, in some being consi- derable, in others presenting little or no elevation, but it is always higher on the inside than on the outside. It terminates above in the articulation with the bones of the leg, behind which it is again prolonged into that peculiar process, the calx—the arm of the lever, which, acted on by the powerful muscles attached to it, raisesTHE SKULL. 79 the body on the anterior part of the foot, where the elasticity of the phalangeal arch is now brought into action. This last, hitherto little noticed, is of essential service in progression; its buttresses are the distal ex- tremities of the metatarsal bones, and the points of the toes themselves; its convexity is turned upwards, the concavity downwards. Any one can readily satisfy him- self by experiment as to the great amount of elasticity which this arch possesses, and its power of propulsion where the body is inclined forwards, anterior to its na- tural equilibrium. THE SKULL. We must now proceed to examine one of the most important parts of the whole skeleton—the cranium; and in doing so we will merely state here, that it is si- tuated on the upper part of the spinal column; that it is of an irregular, ovoid shape, broader behind than in front,—containing an organ, the integrity of which is essential to life; that it is anteriorly blended with the bones of the face, which lie anterior and inferior to it, reserving the more general observations on it as a whole till we have examined minutely the several parts which constitute it. The Cranium consists of eight bones, of which four are single and two double. The four single are the fron- tal, occipital, sphenoid, and ethmoid; the two double, the parietal and temporal,—one being found on either side. We will begin with the description of the frontal. Frontal—This has been compared in shape to a bivalve shell, smooth and convex externally, concave internally, and marked by prominences and pits corre- sponding to the convolutions of the brain, known by the name of mammillary elevations and digital impres- sions. It lies anterior and superior to the other bones, and forms a part of the cranium, forehead, and orbits. In examining it, we will give it two surfaces,—an ex- ternal and internal,—and a circumference. The exter- nal surface may be divided into two parts; the cranial reaching from its margin posteriorly, where it articu-80 THE OSSEOUS SYSTEM. lates with the parietal to the supra-orbital ridges; it is convex and very smooth, and is covered by the occipito- frontalis muscle; in its mesial line it usually presents an irregular ridge, indicating the junction of the two parts of which it was composed in foetal life; and on each side of this, anteriorly, an elevation which corre- sponds to the points of ossification; these are called the frontal eminences. Below this the bone is smooth, where it is covered by the eyebrow; and still lower are the supraciliary arches, prominent but rounded, forming about one-third of a circle, presenting a notch, sometimes a complete foramen, at the junction of their middle with the internal third, for the passage of the supra-orbital artery, a branch of the ophthalmic and supra-orbital nerve, a division of the frontal; a small hole leads from this notch into the diploe of the bone, conveying a minute nerve and vessel for the supply of the sinuses. The supraciliary arches are bounded exter- nally and internally by the angular processes; the external, deeply serrated, articulates with the superior orbital process of the malar bone, and from it a curved ridge is continued backwards and outwards, circum- scribing that small portion of the bone, semilunar in shape, which enters into the formation of the temporal fossa, and gives origin to the muscle and fascia of the same name; the internal angular process is situated on a plane anterior to the preceding; it is also very rough, and articulates above with the nasal bones, and a little lower with the nasal process of the superior maxillary; to these are attached the orbicularis palpe- brarum and corrigator supercilii. A prominence ap- pears in the mesial line—the spine; it is of variable lengths, curved downwards and forwards, giving sup- port to the small nasal bones already alluded to. On either side of the spine are the frontal sinuses, lying between the internal and external plates of which the bone is composed, well marked in the adult and aged, but not visible in festal life. If we noAV turn to the orbital portion of the bone, we wall find that it curves backwards and downwards, forming nearly a right angle with the cranial. It consists of two distinct plates, tri- angular in shape; the base anteriorly formed by the81 THE FRONTAL BONE. supraciliary arches; the apex, posteriorly and internally, concave and smooth, forming the upper Avail of the or- bit, looking downwards and forwards, presenting a deep depression, externally and anteriorly, for the lachrymal giand—a small spicula of bone, sometimes merely a de- pression for the pulley of the superior oblique, situated near its internal and anterior part. The orbital pro- cesses are extremely thin, and are separated from each other by an oblong interval, completed in its natural condition by the cribriform plate of the ethmoid, hence called the ethmoidal notch; the sides of this notch are cellular anteriorly, where they communicate with the frontal sinuses; rough posteriorly, where they often present slight rounded depressions, which are converted into foramina by their junction with the ossa plana of the ethmoid,—the anterior and posterior orbital fora- mina; the former transmitting the anterior ethmoidal artery and nasal twig of the ophthalmic; the latter, the posterior ethmoidal artery only. The posterior margin of the orbital plate is bevilled oif on its upper surface internally, to support the lesser wing of the sphenoid; on its under surface externally, to rest upon its greater wing. The remainder of its circumference is thick and serrated, and articulates for its whole extent with the parietal bones, but in such a manner that while it over- laps them superiorly, it is in turn overlapped by them inferiorly, constituting what is termed the coronal su- ture. If we now proceed to examine the internal surface of the bone, we will find it to be deeply concave and uneven, owing to the depressions and elevations already alluded to. At its most anterior part, and in the mesia'i line, we observe a hole, sometimes only part of one, and completed by the ethmoid; this is the foramen CEecum, foriliing a communication between the nose and the great longitudinal sinus. Passing backwards from this point is a ridge which, after proceeding for a short dis- tance, bifurcates into two, leaving a groove between them, and affording attachment to the falx cerebri, on each side of which are occasionally depressions for the glandulse Pacchioni. The upper parts of the orbital plates are exceedingly convex and irregular, and form82 THE OSSEOUS SYSTEM. the principal portion of the anterior fossae of the cra- nial cavity for the support of the anterior lobes of the brain. The frontal articulates with four bones of the head, —the two parietal, sphenoid, and ethmoid; and with eight of the face,—the two nasal, two superior maxil- lary, two lachrymal, and two malar. It has thirteen processes,—two orbital, two superciliary arches, four angular, two frontal eminences, two temporal ridges, and one spine. Its proper foramina are three in number,— two supra-orbital, and one foramen ca3cum. Its com- mon, six,—four ethmoidal or orbital, and the openings of the two frontal sinuses. It is developed from tAvo points of ossification, one for each lateral portion, the ossific nucleus being visible about the sixth week in the orbital arches. At birth, their lower parts are in con- tact with each other, but their upper are still uncon- nected, having between them an interval constituting one-half of the anterior fontanelle. During the first year they are joined by a suture, which gradually dis- appears, especially towards its posterior part, although it may continue persistent to a very advanced age. In early life, the frontal sinuses are not developed; they appear towards the termination of the first year after birth, and continue to increase gradually in size until death puts a period to their further progress. The Parietal Bone is situated on the lateral and su- perior part of the cranium. It is of a quadrilateral shape, presenting two surfaces,—an external and internal; and four margins,—an anterior, posterior, superior, and in- ferior. The external surface is very convex and smooth, and is covered on its upper part by the tendon of the occipito-frontalis; towards its posterior superior angle it is perforated by a small foramen, giving passage to one of the emissary veins of Sautorini, communicating between the vessels externally and the great longitudi- nal sinus; a little below its centre is a well-marked prominence, the parietal eminence; and still lower a curved ridge, forming the upper boundary of the tem- poral fossa, and affording attachment to the temporal muscle and fascia); its inferior margm is bevilled oft obliquely, where it is overlapped by the squamous plateTHE PARIETAL BONE. 83 of the temporal bone. Its internal surface is concave and uneven, being marked like the frontal with the mammary eminences and digital depressions correspond- ing to the sinuosities of the brain; it is likewise tra- versed by several grooves for the middle meningeal artery; one better marked than the rest appears in front for the trunk; it varies in the appearance which it presents, being sometimes quite superficial, at others a complete bony canal, in which the vessel is concealed; tills groove is always found about half-an-inch from the anterior edge; another groove, much broader and deeper, is seen at its posterior inferior angle, corre- sponding to the lateral sinus. Of its four borders, the superior is the longest and straightest; it is exceed- ingly serrated, and marked by prominent spiculae, simi- lar in shape to the pointed head of an arrow, locking with its fellow of the opposite side, and forming the sagittal suture. From this the anterior border bends downwards at nearly a right angle; it is slightly con- cave; cut off superiorly, so as to be overlapped by the frontal; bevilled oif inferiorly, so as to rest upon the same bone, forming the coronal suture. The inferior margin is curved and fluted; anteriorly it presents a long, pointed angle, which is wedged in between the great wing of the sphenoid and frontal; this is grooved by the canal for the middle meningeal artery; behind this it is concave, and bevilled off to articulate with the latter; and still farther back very thick and rough, to unite with its mastoid portion, between which and the squamous plate its posterior inferior angle is wedged. This is the squamous suture. Its posterior margin is irregular, spiculated, convex, and generally marked by deep undulations; these latter being filled up by sepa- rate pieces of bone,—ossa Wormiana or triquetra, form- ing the lanibdoid suture. It may be necessary to state, that the internal surface, near its upper part, is often marked by depressions of variable size and depth, the result of absorption from the pressure of the Pacchio- nian glands. The parietal articulates with five bones,—the frontal, sphenoid, temporal, occipital, and its fellow of the op- posite side. It has but a single process, the parietal84 THE OSSEOUS SYSTEM. eminence; and one proper hole, which is sometimes ab- sent, that for the emissary vein of Santorini. It is de- veloped from a single point of ossification, which is visible between the fifth and sixth week. In foetal life it is not quadrilateral but oval in shape, as its angles at this period are not developed, and hence the existence of the fontanelles, which are six in number,—one an- terior and superior, of a diamond figure, formed by the two parietal and the frontal, which at that time con- sisted of two bones; a posterior superior, triangular in shape, its sides formed by the parietals, its base by the occipital; an antero-lateral, very small and semilunar, bounded by the parietal, frontal, and sphenoid; and a postero-lateral, oval, constituted by the occipital, tem- poral, and parietal. The Occipital Bone.—This is of an irregular oval shape, but pointed anteriorly and posteriorly. When in position it occupies the back and inferior portion of the cranium. In examining it we will consider an internal and external surface, and a circumference. The exter- nal surface is convex, smooth in its upper third, where it is covered only by the integuments and cellular tis- sue, which is here particularly dense, and the ramifi- cations of the occipital artery and nerve; below this and in the mesial line is a prominence of variable size, giving attachment to the ligamentum nuch«; this is called the occipital protuberance; on either side of this are two well-marked ridges, extending out as far as the mastoid portion of the temporal bone, affording origin by its two external thirds, superiorly, to the occipito- frontalis; and inferiorly, for the same space, having in- serted into it the sterno-cleido-mastoid; the trapezius arises from its internal third. Below this is a groove, into which two muscles are inserted,—the complexus internally, and the splenius capitis externally. Still lower is another ridge, but not so well marked as the preceding, for the attachment of the rectus capitis pos- ticus major, and superior oblique. Between this and the foramen magnum is a slight depression, for the in- sertion of the recti minores. Running vertically down- wards from the occipital protuberance, and separating the bone into two parts, is a slight, elevated crest; this,THE OCCIPITAL BONE. 85 on reaching the foramen magnum, bifurcates into two processes, which surround its edges and meet again in front. The hole thus formed is one of great importance, —oval in shape from before backwards, apparently- larger on its internal than external aspect; it gives passage to the medulla oblongata and its membranes to the vertebral and spinal arteries, and to the spinal acces- sory nerve. As we pass along its margins on its inferior surface we meet with the condyles, situated anterior to the transverse axis of the hole, of an oval shape, converg- ing anteriorly, covered with cartilage, looking down- wards, forwards, and outwards, to articulate with the ob- lique processes of the atlas; on their internal surface is a small tubercle, for the insertion of the cheek or mode- rator ligaments; externally they become continuous, ■with a process somewhat elevated, and extending directly outwards,—the jugular or transverse, which gives at- tachment to the rectus capitis lateralis, and forms the posterior boundary of the jugular or posterior lacerated foramen. Immediately above the root of the condyle are two foramina,—one, anteriorly large, directed for- wards and outwards—the anterior condyloid, through which is transmitted the lingual or ninth nerve, and the small occipito-meningeal artery; the other much smaller, directed backwards and outwards, sometimes altogether absent,—the posterior condyloid, for a small vein which communicates with the lateral sinus inter- nally, and the vertebral vein externally. The basilar process, which lies in front of the foramen magnum, is thick and quadrilateral in shape ; it is convex and rough on its inferior surface, giving attachment to the following parts from behind forwards :—most poste- riorly, and to the lip of the opening, the apparatus liga- mentosus colli; secondly, to the broad and cord-like por- tions of the occipito-atloid ligament; thirdly, to the rectus capitus anticus minor; fourthly, to the rectus major; fifthly, to the middle; and sixthly, to the supe- rior constrictors of the pharynx;—and lastly, towards its anterior part, it is covered by the mucous membrane of the pharynx. The sides of the basilar process are rough superiorly, to articulate with the edge of the petrous portion of the temporal bone; anteriorly, it isTHE OSSEOUS SYSTEM. 86 still more irregular where it unites with the posterior part of the body of the sphenoid, from which it is al- ways most difficult to detach it,—this is the clivus basis cranii; superiorly, it is concave from side to side, slop- ing downwards and backwards to the foramen magnum, and supporting the medulla oblongata, sixth pair of nerves, and basilar artery. As we proceed backwards from the upper surface of the basilar process, we ob- serve on the edges of the foramen magnum, correspond- ing to the condyles inferiorly, an oblong, elevated pro- cess of bone, forming the upper wall of the anterior condyloid hole. Behind and external to this is a, short but deep groove for the lateral sinus, before it joins the internal jugular vein. The anterior surface of the bone is concave, and divided into four compartments by two lines, which intersect each other at a right angle about the centre, forming an elevation which corresponds to the torcular Herophili internally, and the occipital pro- tuberance externally. The two superior chambers are triangular in shape, and lodge the posterior lobes of the cerebriim; the two inferior are irregularly quadri- lateral, to support the hemispheres of the cerebellum. The vertical ridge which divides them stretches from the foramen magnum below to the pointed process above, where it becomes continuous with the sagittal suture between the parietal bones; inferiorly, it is ele- vated and well marked, giving attachment to the falx cerebelli; superiorly, much more depressed where the falx cerebri is connected to it. The transverse ridge is double, with a groove dividing them; this is of unequal depth on either side, corresponding to the great lateral sinuses,—the conduits which convey the blood from the torcular Herophili to the internal jugular vein, and gives attachment to the tentorium cerebelli. If we now examine the circumference of the bone, we will find it to be deeply serrated above, for articulation with the parietal, several deep indentations occasionally occur- r'mcr for the reception of the ossa triquetra. It is here also comparatively thin; but below, where it umtes with the temporal, it becomes thicker and less spicu- lated anterior to the short groove for the termination of the lateral sinus; the margin becomes smooth andTHE TEMPORAL BONE, 87 concave ^where it joins -with the temporal to form the foramen lacerum posterius; a slight spicula of bone often appearing on it, dividing it into two parts, the smaller portion being situated anteriorly. The remain- der of the circumference has been already described. The occipital articulates with six bones,—the two parietal, two temporal, sphenoid, and atlas. Its pro- cesses are six in number,—the two condyles, two jugu- lar eminences, the basilar and occipital protuberance. It has five proper foramina,—the foramen magnum, the two anterior and the two posterior condyloid; and two com- mon,—the anterior and posterior lacerated holes. The first is of an irregular figure, and is formed by three bones,—the body of the sphenoid, basilar process of oc- cipital, and point of the petrous portion of the tempo- ral. In the natural condition of parts it is filled up with cartilage, which is traversed by the Vidian nerve in its passage into the cranial cavity. The posterior la- cerated foramen is formed by two bones only,—the occi- pital and temporal; it is of an ovoid figure, broad behind, narrow and pointed in front, intersected by two septa, which are sometimes bony, sometimes cartilaginous; the posterior is for the jugular vein, the middle for the spinal accessory and pneumogastric nerves, and the an- terior for the glosso-pharyngeal. The bone is developed from four osseous points,—one for the basilar process, one for either condyle, and one for the upper part; the first ossific point is visible from the seventh to the eighth week. The Temporal Bone is of an irregular oval figure, and is found in the lateral and inferior part of the cranium. It has been divided by anatomists generally into three portions: a squamous, situated anteriorly and superiorly; a mastoid, posteriorly and inferiorly; and a petrous in- ternally, at the junction of the other two. We will commence with a description of the squamous. This is of a semilunar shape, limited internally and inferiorly by the petrous portion; externally and inferiorly by zygomatic arch, and bounded in its curved outline by the free margin of the bone. Its outer surface is very smooth and convex, it enters into the formation of the temporal fossa, of which it forms a large part, and88 THE OSSEOUS SYSTEM. gives origin to the muscle of the same name; its inner is marked more strikingly by mammillary eminences and digital depressions than in the bones already de- scribed, and is separated from the petrous by a narrow, wavy groove, extending in a direction backwards and outwards. Its margin, particularly superiorly, is be- villed off to overlap the parietal bone, forming the squa- mous suture, and it forms the outer boundary of the middle fossa of the cranium. The zygomatic arch is a process of bone, a little more than an inch in length, cut off obliquely on its under surface, and serrated so as to rest on the malar, stretching backwards to a tu- bercle, where it bifurcates into its two roots; its upper edge is thin and sharp, giving attachment to the tem- poral fascia; its lower, thicker, to the parotidian apo- neurosis; its internal surface is concave and smooth for the temporal muscle to glide behind it to its inser- tion; its external, convex, for the origin of the deep por- tion of the masseter and zygomaticUs major. The tu- bercle which limits it posteriorly is generally well marked for the attachment of the external lateral liga- ment; bifurcating at this point into its two roots, the horizontal and transverse,—the former stretching back- wards towards the mastoid portion, where it becomes gradually lost, the latter extending inwards and slightly backwards, more elevated and rounded, wider internally than externally, they enclose the glenoid cavity, an oval depression; long from before backwards and inwards, divided by theGlaserian fissure, which runs forwards and inwards into two parts, the anterior, larger, and concave for the condyle ofthelower jaw, the posterior, smaller and flatter, lodging a process of the parotidian gland, the glenoid. The Glaserian fissure is remarkable for afi'ord- ing attachment to the capsular ligament, and it is said to give passage to the Vidian nerve and laxator tympani muscle, but improperly, as Ave have always observed the former to emerge internal to it, and the latter ought rather to be considered as a band of fibrous tissue stretching from the spinous process of the sphenoid to the point of the processus gracilis of the malleus,_ which terminates within the lips of the fissure. Behind the glenoid cavity are two processes, the styloid and vaginal,89 TflE TEMPORAL BONE. forming an elevated boundary for the depression. The first or styloid, as its name implies, is similar in figure to the ancient pen, broad at its base where it is in con- nexion with the vaginal; thin and pointed inferiorly; of variable length, directed forwards and downwards, giving attachment by its apex to the stylo-glossus; by its middle to the stylo-hyoid, and by its base to the sty- lo-pharyngeus; two ligaments are also connected to it, the stylomaxillary above, and the stylohyoid below. The vaginal process surrounds its base like a sheath, and can be traced forwards and inwards to form the outer wall of the carotid hole, an important relation in the surgical operation of dividing the capsule in the removal of the lower jaw; posteriorly it stretches back as far as the mastoid process, from which it is separated by a slight groove, through which the auricular branch of the fascial nerve glides to supply the retrahens muscle of the ear; anteriorly and externally it passes upwards and forwards to separate the glenoid cavity from the external auditory meatus (processus audito- rius), and terminates at the outer edge of the fissure of Glaser by bending backwards, posterior to a small offset from the horizontal root of the zygoma, which descends in front of it. The external auditory meatus, which lies on a plane superior and posterior to the last described cavity, is of an oval shape, long from above downwards, its edges rounded off, except anteriorly, where it is sharp and rough, being the terminal portion of the vaginal process already described, more generally known as the auditory; behind it is the mastoid process, and above the horizontal ramus of the zygoma; to its edges is at- tached the cartilage, which completes the tube of the ear, which, with the bony portion to be more particu- larly described hereafter, forms a canal about an inch in length. The mastoid portion of the bone is much stronger than the squamous; in figure it is triangular or nipple- shaped,—hence its name; its margins, thick and ser- rated, articulate above with the postero-inferior angle of the parietal; behind and inferiorly with the occipital; its external surface rough and convex; broad above, but gradually becoming more contracted as it descends,THE OSSEOUS SYSTEM. 90 until it terminates in a mammillary tubercle—the mas- toid process; superiorly it affords attachment to the occipito-frontalis, a little lower to the sterno-cleido mastoid; lower still to the splenius capitis, and anterior to these, to the ratrahens aurem; towards its posterior edge, but superiorly, is a small hole for the emunctory vessel of Santorini, communicating externally with the occipital vein, and internally with the lateral sinus. On the inferior part, and directly internal to the mas- toid process, is a deep furrow, called the digastric fossa, for tlae origin of the muscle of the same name; it is di- rected backwards and outwards, and internal to it is a much shallower groove for the occipital artery; conti- nuous with it in front, but separated from it posteriorly by a crest of bone, slightly elevated for the insertion of the trachelo-mastoideus. If we now turn to the internal surface, we will find it to be limited in front by the base of the petrous portion, which likewise forms the ante- rior boundary of a deep curved groove, corresponding to the lateral sinus. Behind this is a small oval portion, uneven, long from above downwards, forming the ex- ternal boundary for the fossa, for the reception of the lobes of the cerebellum. The petrous portion of the bone, so termed from its stony hardness, is prismatic in shape; its base, which is cut off very obliquely, and turned backwards and out- wards, corresponds to the union of the squamous and mastoid portions; its apex, turned forwards and in- wards, truncated, rough internally, perforated exter- nally for the termination of the carotid canal, is wedged in between the posterior part of the great wing of the sphenoid and the basilar process of the occipital, forming the posterior boundary of the anterior lacerated foramen already described with the latter bone. In examining it we will give it a superior, an internal, and inferior sur- face, separated from each other by three margins: a superior internal, an inferior internal, and a superior external. The superior surface is separated from the squamous portion anteriorly by the slight wavy fissure already alluded to, but behind it is completely blended with it; marked with alternating elevations and de-^ pressions, posteriorly and externally, we observe one oi91 THE TEMPORAL BONE. the former conspicuotis for its size; this corresponds to the superior semicircular canal, a part which -will be more accurately examined in the description of the in- ternal ear; about three-quarters of an inch anterior to this is a small groove directed backwards, terminat- ing in a foramen, the hiatus Fallopii, which leads into tlie aqueduct of the same author; through this is trans- mitted the Vidian nerve, from Meckel's ganglion and Vidian branch of the middle meningeal artery. Slightly external, and anterior to the hiatus, is another small hole for the passage of the nervous petrosus superficialis minor, a branch of the tympanic division of Jacobson, in its course to join the internal pterygoid twig of the fifth, for the formation of the otic ganglion; anterior to these foramina is a slight ridge, corresponding to the upper part of the cochlea, and still more anteriorly, near the point of the bone, a depression on which rests the Casserian ganglion of the portio mollis of the fifth. Its superior internal edge is grooved slightly for the superior petrosal sinus, communicating posteriorly with the great lateral, and anteriorly with the cavernous; immediatel}'- behind its apex, however, there is a slight notch, concave superiorly, and directed upwards where the groove is deficient, and converted into a semilunar foramen by the sinus, which crosses it for the trans- mission of the two portions of the fifth nerve. The in- ternal surface of the bone forms the external boundary of the posterior fossa of the cranium; it is convex and irregular, presenting a large aperture at the junction of its middle with the anterior third, oval in shape, di- rected obliquely backwards and outwards, the internal auditory meatus. As we look into the bottom of this we observe, superiorly and anteriorly, a large foramen; the opening of the aqueduct of Fallopius, into which passes the portio dura nerve; in the inferior part of it several smaller foramina, lamina spiralis foramenulenta, or base of thecochlea, for the branches of the portio mollis to pass into the vestibule. Behind, and a little superior to the meatus, is a slight fissure, likewise directed back- wards; the aqueduct ofthe vestibule, for the transmission of a small vein from that cavity to the superior petrosal sinus; below and behind this is another cleft, but notTHE OSSEOUS SYSTEM. 92 always present, into which the dura mater insinuates Itself. The inferior internal margin is very irregular. Commencing posteriorly we observe a slight depression corresponding to the inner wall of the jugular fossa; then a small elevation, separating it from a slight notch, the internal boundary of the aqueduct of the cochlea; in the remainder of its course it is convex and rough, and articulates with the basilar process of the occipital bone. The inferior surface forms part of the base of the cranium, and is the most irregular of the three. Anteriorly it is exceedingly rough, and gives attach- ment to the petro-pharyngeal aponeurosis and levator palati; more posteriorly, but externally, is a large for- amen,—the carotid, into which enters that artery, and branches of the superior cervical ganglion of the sym- pathetic, the nervi molles; a thin crest separates this foramen from a depression of variable depth posteriorly, —the jugular fossa formed by the regurgitation of the blood in this vein; in this crest is a minute foramen for the tympanic branch of Jacobson in its course to the tympanum; and in the outer wall of the same fossa, another for the passage of Arnold's auricular twig, to reach the stylo mastoid-hole. Behind, the jugular fossa and internal to the carotid hole, is a small cleft of a tri- angular shape,—the aqueduct of the cochlea, for the transmission of a small vein to the inferior petrosal sinus. At the back part of the inferior surface, just as the digastric groove commences, and between the sty- loid and mastoid processes, but internal to both, is another hole, the stylo-mastoid, through which emerges the portio dura nerve, and into which enters a small branch of an artery from the posterior auris to anasto- mose, in the aqueduct of Fallopius, with the Vidian bo-anch of the middle meningeal. The external supe- rior is the shortest of the three margins; it forms an acute angle with the squamous portion, and at the point of junction we observe a canal leading back^vards, and divided into two by a thin plate of bone,—the pro- cessus cochleariformis; the superior, the smaller, giving origin to the tensor tympani, the inferior larger, con- stituting the bony portion of the Eustachian tube. An- terior to this the margin is rough and rather broad forTHE TEMPORAL BONE. 93 J (irticulating with the side of the spine of the sphe- I noid. The temporal articulates with three bones of the I head,—the parietal, occipital, and sphenoid; and with I two of the face,—the malar and inferior maxillary. Its {processes are six in number,—the mastoid, styloid, vagi- ;nal, auditory, zygomatic, and cochleariform. It has : fourteen proper foramina,—the external and internal i auditory, the mastoid and stylo-mastoid, the aqueducts , of the cochlea and vestibule, the hiatus Fallopii, and the I hole for the lesser petrosal nerve, the foramina for the ; Eustachian tiibe and tensor tympani, glenoidal fissure, : and carotid hole, the small openings for the tympanic I nerve of Jacobson and auricular of Arnold. The com- ] mon are two,—the anterior and posterior lacerated, al- ] ready described with the occipital. The temporal is developed from five points of ossifica- ' tion: one for the squamous portion, one for the petrous, one for the mastoid, one for the auditory meatus, and one for the styloid. These make their appearance in I periods varying from the second to the fifth month, but I do not become thoroughly united—we allude to the three principal portions—till a year after birth. The ; styloid process may remain separate for several years. The appearance of the temporal bone in the foetus is pe- culiar : the bony portion of the auditory meatus is not developed to any extent, but consists of a mere bony ring; the transverse root of the zygoma is but slightly ■ elevated, so that the glenoid cavity is nearly flat. The mastoid portion of the bone is extremely small, and its cells, on making a section, are not as yet visible. The upper surface of the petrous portion is also remarkable from the prominence of the superior semicircular canal and size of the cochlea, while the small ossicula of the tympanum exhibit all their future elements in a state of high perfection. With respect to the remark so often quoted, of the styloid process articulating with the os hyoides, we have only to observe that, in a large number of subjects that ' came under our own inspection, it occurred but in one 1 individual instance; in this case the styloid process, thick and strong, not tapering, but increasing in sizpTHE OSSEOUS SYSTEM. 94 towards its inferior extremity, terminated in a rounded head, whicli articulated with a cuplike cavity on the upper surface of the os hyoides, at the junction of its cornu with its body. The Sphenoid, so termed from the manner in which it is wedged in at the base of the cranium, forming the bond of union between all the bones of the head, and several of the face. In figure it has been compared to a bat, with the wings expanded; and the similarity is more obvioxis when observed with the ethmoid attached to it anteriorly. In its description we will give it a body, which we wUl first examine, and afterwards the processes which are connected to it. The central thick portion of the bone is that to which the name of body has been applied; it is of a cuboid shape, and presents an upper and lower surface; an anterior and posterior extremity and two sides. The superior surface is very irregular, presenting in the mesial line anteriorly a slight elevation, which is prolonged into a triangular spine that fits into a corresponding notch in the eth- moid bone; on either side of this is a slight depression, on which the olfactory nerve rests in its course forwards and inwards to the cribiform plate, and external to this the small pedicle, the anterior root of the lesser wing. As we proceed backwards we reach a grooved portion of the bone, narrow and concave from before backwards, long and convex from side to side; this is the olivary process for supporting the optic commissure, and which is terminated at either extremity by a rounded hole, the optic, through which pass the nerve of the same name and the ophthalmic artery; behind the oli- vary process there is a deep excavation, concave from before backwards, the sella turcica; the pituitary gland rests in it, and a remarkable sinus, the circular ofEidley, as well as the transverse sphenoidal; more posteriorly there is an abrupt but narrow elevation, at the extremities of Avhich are two rounded processes: the posterior clinoid, which give attachment to the con- vex margin of the tentorium. The back part of the body is flat, but very rough, for articulation with the basilar process of the occipital. The inferior surface presents in the mesial line, stretching downwards andTHE SPHENOID. 95 forwards, a triangular plate of bone for uniting with the vomer, which is split to receive it posteriorly, and with the nasal lamella of the ethmoid anteriorly, where the tongue-like prolongation of the triangular fibro-cartilage of the nose is also attached to it; this is called the ros- trum or azygos process; on either side of it is a deep furrow, partially overlapped by a thin lamella of bone, under which the edges of the vomer are implanted. The anterior extremity of the body has springing from it the ethmoidal spine already alluded to, descending from which is a thin crest becoming continuous with the rostrum below; it forms the septum between two holes on either side, the openings into the sphenoidal sinuses, which extend into the body, and occasionally into the lesser wings, consisting of several minute com- partments, separated from each other by thin laminse; the lower wall of these holes is completed by two small curved slips of bone which connect it to the palate, the turbinated bones of Bertin; external to this the bone is rough to articulate with the orbital process of the palate. If we now direct our attention to the sides of the body we will find that the lesser wings, or wings of Ingrassius, spring from them anteriorly and superiorly; below these it is smooth and concave from above down- wards, forming part of the inner wall of the orbit, and the internal boundary or base of the lacerated or- bital foramen; posterior to this it is smooth, and de- scends obliquely downwards and outwards to terminate in the greater wing, forming the internal wall of the cavernous sinus; still more posteriorly it is marked by a shallow groove for the passage of the internal carotid, while inferiorly the greater wing springs from it by a broad thick root. We will now proceed to the examina- tion of those wings. The lesser wing is of a triangular shape, with the apex directed forwards and outwards; the base inwards and slightly backwards, connected to the body by two roots, one anterior and superior, broad and strong, the other inferiorly and posteriorly, much thinner and weaker, separated bya round foramen, the optic; the base terminates behind in a tuberculated pro- cess,—the posterior clinoid, which gives attachment to the concave margin of the tentorium; the upper sur-THE OSSEOUS SYSTEM. 96 face is slightly concave; it forms part of the anterior fossa of the cranium; the inferior convex constituting the su- perior wall of the foramen lacerum orbitale; the poste- rior edge is rounded and smooth, and has connected to it the sphenoidal fold of dura mater; the anterior rough and bevilled off so as to rest on the frontal. The greater wing is of an irregular wedge shape, and accordingly presents three surfaces: a superior or cere- bral, an external or temporo-zygomatic, and an internal or orbital; each circumscribed by corresponding margins of articulation. The superior or cerebral surface is in its outline irregularly rhomboidal and deeply concave for the reception of the middle lobe of the brain; in its posterior external angle it presents a small hole,—the spinous, for the passage of the middle meningeal artery; more anteriorly and internally a foramen, oval in shape, large for the transmission of the inferior maxillary nerve, hard root of the fifth, and occasionally the ante- rior meningeal artery and small petrosal nerve; more anteriorly and internally still is the hole for the passage of the superior maxillary nerve, the rotundum; it is much smaller and rounder, and is directed forwards and slightly outwards to open into the pterygo-maxillary fossa. The greater wing has four margins: a posterior, external, anterior, and internal. Of these the first is the shortest, flattest, and broadest, elevated into a thin crest above, forming a posterior boundary for the foramen ovale, and lying in contact with the outer side of the petrous portion of the temporal bone; the external margin is the longest, and concave; thick, rough, and serrated posteriorly, where it articulates, behind the edge of the glenoid cavity, and, in front of this, with the squamous plate; more anteriorly it is bevilled off where it is overlapped by the parietal bone. The anterior edge unites with that already described at a very acute angle, cut off obliquely externally, while it is broad and extremely rough internally for articula- tion with the frontal; its inner margin for its two an- terior thirds is free, thin, and irregular, where it forms the inferior boundary of the lacerated hole; its poste- rior third becomes blended with the lower part of the side of the body of the bone. The external or tem.THE SPHENOID, 97 poro-zygomatic surface is remarkable for its curved appearance; long and convex from above downwards and inwards, narrow and concave from before back- wards. It is divided a little below the centre by an horizontal elevated crest into two portions, a superior or temporal, and an inferior or zygomatic. The supe- rior is wedged in between the temporal and parietal behind, and the malar and frontal in front, and forms part of the temporal fossa; bounded below by the crest already alluded to, which gives attachment to the tem- poral and outer head of the external pterygoid muscle; the inferior is more concave, quadrilateral in shape; bounded in front by a ridge of bone, prolonged from the root of the external pterygoid plate; above by the crest, while posteriorly and externally it presents a sharp-pointed angle, which is fitted into the interval between the squamous and petrous portions of the tem- poral bone. It forms the roof of the zygomatic fossa, and is perforated by two foramina, the oval anteriorly and the spinous posteriorly; in front of and behind the last mentioned are two small processes, one oblong and sharp, the spinous; the other broader, but thin, the styloid; these give attachment to the laxator tympani muscle, and the internal lateral ligament of the lower jaw. The internal or orbital surface is of a diamond figure, flat and smooth, looking forwards and inwards, forming the principal portion of the external wall of the orbit; its superior edge is rough and thick, to ar- ticulate with the frontal; its anterior, likewise rough, but thin, to unite with the malar; its inferior smooth, rounded, and free, forming the outer boundary of the spheno-maxillary fissure; its posterior likewise non- articular, but thin, constituting the inferior wall of the foramen lacerum orbitale, for the transmission of the several nerves to the orbit. As we proceed down- wards and backwards from the orbital, we find a flat portion of the bone terminating below in the roots of the pterygoid processes; it is quadrilateral in shape, forms the posterior boundary of the pterygo-maxil- lary fossa, and is perforated by two foramina; the supe- rior, the external opening of the foramen rotundum • FTHE OSSEOUS SYSTEM. 98 the inferior much smaller, the entrance into the Vi- dian canal. The pterygoid processes are two remark- able plates of bone, and have received their name from their supposed resemblance to the wings of a bird. They are of an oblong shape, convex anteriorly, and only separated by a narrow fissure, into which the sphe- noidal process of the palate bone is fitted; concave pos- teriorly and separated by a broad groove, which is occupied by the tensor palate as it runs to its insertion, origin of the internal pterygoid and pterygoid process of the palate bone. The external pterygoid plate is the broader, thinner, and shorter; concave on its outer surface, it gives origin to the external pterygoid muscle; convex on its inner, the internal pterygoid is attached to it. The internal pterygoid plate arises by two roots, one external and long, connecting it to the spinous pro- cess ; the other short, bending inwards, and forming a thin lamina, which overlaps the side of the vomer; be- tween them is a depression, triangular in shape,—the scaphoid fossa, from which the tensor palati arises. The inner side of the internal pterygoid plate is slightly convex, and forms the external boundary of the poste- rior nares; concave externally where it corresponds to the tensor palati; it terminates in a remarkable hook- like appendage, round which, but separated from it by a small bursa, the tensor palati plays,_ Tvhile to its point the pterygo-pharyngeal aponeurosis is attached. The sphenoid articulates with all the bones of the l-iead,—the ethmoid and frontal anteriorly, both parie- tals and temporals laterally, and the occipital behind; and with five of the face,—the two malar, the two pa- late, and vomer. It has twenty-eight processes,—two greater and two lesser wings, two orbital and two tern- poral, two spinous and two styloid, four pterygoid plates and four clinoid, two hamular and two lesser bones of Bertin, one ethmoidal, one olivary, one basi- lar, and one azygos. It is perforated by fourteen pro- per foramina, or seven on either side,—the spinous, oval, round, lacerated—orbital, optic, Vidian, and openings into sphenoidal sinuses. Its common foramina are eight, or four at each side,—the anterior lacerated,THE ETHMOID. 99 spheno-maxillary, spheno-palatine, and posterior-pala- tine. These last will be fully discussed in the general description of the cranium. In the earlier periods of foetal life, indeed occasionally up to birth, the sphenoid is composed of two distinct parts,—an anterior, consisting of the lesser Avings and that part of the body to which they are attached; and a posterior, constituted by the sella turcica, greater wings, and external pterygoid plate, the internal form- ing a distinct process. We will accordingly find that the points of development will in a great measure de- pend on this early arrangement. The lesser wings and their contiguoiis portion of the body have each a sepa- rate nucleus, forming four in all; the greater with their corresponding half have each one, making four also. If we now add one for each internal pterygoid process, and one for each bone of Bertin, these will form twelve altogether. The periods of ossification vary in making their appearance from the sixth week to the fifth month. The sphenoidal sinuses do not exist at all in the young subject. Ethmoid—This bone is situated in the anterior in- ferior part of the cranium, forming the greater part of the nasal cavity. It is remarkable for its light and spongy character, being composed principally of a se- ries of cells which communicate with the meatuses of the nose. In shape it is cuboid, and we may accord- ingly give it a superior, inferior, two lateral surfaces, and an anterior and a posterior extremity. The superior surface is quadrilateral, longer antero-posteriorly than from side to side. When in position it supports the bulbs of the olfactory nerves, and is perforated by a number of small rounded foramina, for the transmis- sion of their filaments into the cavity of the nose. In the mesial line we observe an elevated process, which, from its resemblance to the comb of a cock, has been called the crista galli; and on each side of this, but anteriorly, is a fissure about two lines in length, the nasal slit, through which passes the nasal branch of the ophthalmic to supply the septum and tip of the nose. The crista galli, which can only be regarded as a pro- longation upwards of the vertical plate of the ethmoid,100 THE OSSEOUS SYSTEM. commences behind, at a small notch, triangular in shape, for the reception of the ethmoidal spine of the sphe- noid, continues depressed for some distance, then rises obliquely upwards and forwards to variable heights, and ultimately descends, nearly perpendicular, to ter- minate in two small oval wings, which, diverging ante- riorly, unite with similar processes of the frontal to form the foramen caecum, the orifice of communication between the nose and superior longitudinal sinus. The crista galli is not always vertical, but may incline either to the right or left; it is smooth and rounded, and af- fords attachment to the falx cerebri. The margins of the superior surface articulate anteriorly and laterally with the frontal, and behind with the body and lesser wings of the sphenoid. If we now direct our attention to the sides of the bone, we will find them to be ex- tremely smooth, and hence their name, ossaplana; they are also quadrilateral in shape, long from before back- wards, their external surface corresponding to the in- ner wall of the orbit, their internal to the outer of the nose; their anterior margin, short, articulates with the OS unguis, their posterior with the sphenoid and palate bones, their inferior with the superior maxillary and inferior spongy, and their superior with the frontal; this last suture is pierced by two foramina, the ante- rior and posterior ethmoidal; the first transmitting the anterior ethmoidal artery and nasal twig of the ophthal- mic, the second a small artery only. The anterior ex- tremity of the bone is very irregular in its appearance, displaying several apertures which open into cells; these are completed when in situ by the os unguis ex- ternally, and the nasal processes of the superior maxil- lary in front. The posterior extremity, m its general character, is very analogous to the preceding; in it we find the openings into the posterior ethmoidal cells, completed above by the body of the sphenoid, and be- low by the palate, on this we likewise observe the ex- tremities of the superior and inferior turbinated bones, with a groove, the superior meatus, dividing theni. The inferior surface is the most irregular of any of those we have hitherto described: in the mesial line is placed a thin plate, seldom perfectly vertical, the nasal lamella,THE BONES OF THE FACE. IQl dividing the whole bone into two lateral masses; this is thin below, where it is received between the lips of the fissure in the anterior superior margin of the vo- mer; rough in front, where it joins the septal cartilage and nasal bones; irregular posteriorly, where it is united to the body of the sphenoid in front of the ros- trum ; above, it becomes continuous with the crista galli already alluded to. Between this median septum in- ternally, and the os planum externally, is placed the spongy masses of the bone, consisting of the anterior and posterior ethmoidal cells, separated from each other by a thin transverse septum; the former communicat- ing with the middle, the latter with the superior mea- tus. The surface which they present inferiorly is un- even, projecting so as in some parts to overlap and help to close in the maxillary sinus. The two spongy bones which are connected to the ethmoid are thin, osseous laminse, curled upon themselves, convex towards the septum, and divided from each other by a horizontal narrow groove, the superior meatus, into the upper and posterior part of which open the sinuses of the sphenoid and cells of the ethmoid. The inferior spongy bone is the larger of the two; anteriorly, it rests on a ridge of the nasal process of the superior maxillary; posteriorly, on a similar crest on the palate. The ethmoid articulates with two bones of the head, —the frontal and sphenoid; and eleven of the face, the two superior maxillary, two malar, two lachrymal, two palate, and vomer. Its proper holes are those for the olfactory and nasal nerves; its common, the ante- rior and posterior ethmoidal. It has two processes only, the crista galli and nasal lamellae. The ossific nucleus of the ethmoid is not visible till the fifth or sixth month, and the cells in its interior are not deve- loped till the fourth year. THE BONES OF THE FACE. The Face, although much smaller in its dimensions than the cranium, consists of more numerous bones. They are, of course, miich smaller, and are altogether fourteen in number, six being double and two single. The double are the malar, superior maxillary, palate,102 THE OSSEOUS SYSTEM. nasal, lachrymal, and inferior spongy; the single, the vomer and lower jaw. We will begin with the malar, as the most prominent. Malar Bone.—This occupies the superior and ex- ternal part of the face, and presents the appearance of a curvilinear triangle resting on a broad base, the or- bital plate. We may therefore describe it as having two surfaces,—an external and internal; and three mar- gins, a superior, an inferior, and anterior. The external surface is smooth and convex, and is perforated at its internal inferior part by a small foramen for the pas- sage of the superficialis malse nerve; it likewise affords origin to a few fibres of the masseter below, the zygo- maticus major in the middle, and the zygomaticus minor above. The internal surface is concave, and enters into the formation of the temporal fossa; the muscle of the same name likewise arising from it, while it is also pierced by a small hole for the temporo-malar nerve. The superior margin is thin and undulating, and has attached to it the temporal aponeurosis, presenting above a sharp process,_the superior orbital, for articu- lation with the external angular process of the os frontis, while below and behind it is cut off very obliquely to support the zygomatic arch of the temporal bone. The inferior edge is likewise thin, but straight, giving origin to the deep fibres of the masseter; the an- terior, concave and sharp, forms the outer and inferior part of the rim of the orbit, terminating below and in- ternally in a tapering point—the inferior orbital process, which articulates with the superior maxillary bone. Bending backwards and inwards at a very acute angle with the part of the bone already described, is the orbi- tal plate, smooth and concave, semilunar m shape, bounded in front by its anterior free edge, and behind by a serrated margin, articulating above with the frontal aiid great wing of the sphenoid, and below with the malar process of the superior maxilla, into which it is re- ceived • a slight notch is immediately above this last point of articulation, corresponding to the spheno-max- illary fissure, of which it forms the anterior boundary. The malar articulates with four bones only: three ot the head,—the frontal, sphenoid, and temporal and one of the face,—the superior maxilla. It has four pro-THE SUPERIOR MAXILLARY. 103 cesses: the zygomatic, the superior, inferior, and internal orbital. Its proper foramina are the two already men- tioned for the passage of the two small cutaneous nerves; its common the spheno-maxillary, for the passage of the orbital branch of the superior maxillary nerve and small twigs from the infra-orbital artery, for the supply of the parts in the cavity of the orbit. It is developed from a single point of ossification, which is visible about the seventh week. Superior Maxillary.—This is one of the most irre- gular bones of the whole face, and extremely compli- cated from the number of parts which require to be considered. In order to examine it properly it should be divided into a facial, malar, zygomatic, palatine, naso- palatine, and orbital surfaces, each presenting peculiar margins, which will each require an individual descrip- tion. We will commence with the anterior edge. This, inferiorly, is prominent, corresponding to the root of the inner incisor tooth; above this it is concave, afford- ing attachment to the frsenum of the upper lip; this is limited above by a sharp spicula of bone,—the nasal spine, to which is connected the caudate extremity of the alar cartilage. As we proceed still higher up we find the bone abruptly hollowed out, concave with the margins, smooth and rounded below, sharp above; this is the nasal notch, which gives attachment to the alar and late- ral cartilages of the nose. Above this is a long process,— the nasal, quadrilateral in shape, having an external and internal surface, an anterior and posterior edge, and an upper extremity; the lower being continuous with the bone inferiorly. The external surface is smooth and slightly convex; it has attached to it the long head of the levator labii superioris alseque nasi, the orbicularis palpebrarum, and tendo oculi; its internal surface is rough, and has two remarkable horizontal ridges on it; one below, near its root, to support the inferior spongy bone, the other a little above its centre for the middle; the depression which separates them corresponds to the middle meatus of the nose; higher up it is very irregu- lar, and lies against the ethmoid, the anterior cells of which it assists in closing; the anterior margin is thin and sharp, but straight; it articulates with the nasal104 THE OSSEOUS SYSTEM. bone; its posterior edge is much thicker and deeply grooved inferiorly, where it forms the greater part of the nasal duct; behind this groove it articulates with the OS unguis; its upper extremity is rough and spiculated for uniting with the internal angular process of the frontal. The facial surface of the bone is very exten- sive, and is, generally speaking, concave. It consists of two fossae,—one anterior, small and quadrilateral,—the incisive or myrtiform; the other large, concave, and likewise square,—the canine. The myrtiform fossa (so called from its shape) is bounded below by the in- cisor teeth, above by the lower part of the nasal notch, in front by the symphysis, and behind by the promi- nence of the canine tooth; it gives origin to the de- pressor labii superioris alaeque nasi. The canine fossa is bounded below by the alveoli of the two anterior molar teeth, above by the edge of the orbit and articu- lation of the malar bone; in front by the elevation of the canine tooth and nasal notch, and behind by the jugal ridge; it affords attachment to the compressor nasi internally, to the levator anguli oris externally, and to the short head of the levator labii superioris alseque nasi superiorly; between these two last muscles is the infra-orbital hole, directed downwards and forwards, through which passes the vessels and nerves of the same name. The jugal ridge which bounds this fossa poste- riorly commences below at the third molar tooth, where it is but slightly elevated, but as it ascends it becomes gradually more prominent till it terminates in a sharp point above and externally; here it changes its course and bifurcates into two laminae,—one sharp and thin, which runs forwards and inwards to the anterior edge of the orbit, where it terminates; the other thick, more elevated and irregular, which strikes backwards and in- wards towards the spheno-maxillary fissure, where it ceases abruptly; between the two is circumscribed a rough depressed triangular surface for the reception of the malar bone. The zygomatic portion of the bone is situated posteriorly, bounded below by the two last molar teeth, above by the edge of the orbital process, externally by the jugal ridge, and internally by its ar- ticulation with the palate. The inner part of this sur-THE SUPERIOR MAXILLARY. 105 face, prominent and convex, is called the tuberosity, which is perforated by several small foramina for the mental nerves and vessels, and is likewise marked by a small groove, corresponding to the pterygo-palatine ca- nal ; the outer is smooth and concave, and gives origin to the buccinator muscle. The orbital surface is trian- gular in shape, flat and smooth, looking upwards, for- wards, and outwards, marked by a deep groove poste- riorly, which runs forwards to terminate in the infra- orbital canal. It has three margins: an internal, thin and bevilled off posteriorly, to articulate with the os planum of the ethmoid and a small portion of the lachry- mal, notched anteriorly for the commencement of the nasal duct; its external edge is smooth and rounded, where it forms the internal boundary of the spheno- maxillary fissure; but two notches are visible in it an- teriorly, one for the infra-orbital canal, the other for the spheno-maxillary fissure; its anterior margin is concave upwards, presenting externally the rough sur- face for articulation with the malar bone, while inter- nally it is smooth and free. The naso-palatine portion of the bone is situated inferiorly; it presents three sur- faces,—a superior, an inferior, and internal. The supe- rior forms the floor of the nose, is concave from side to side, and likewise so from before backwards, broader be- hind thatn in front, and bounded internally by a thin ir- regular lip,—the nasal crest; external to this process, and half-an-inch from its anterior edge, is a small fora- men,—the anterior palatine, which communicates below with the incisive fossa, and gives passage to the naso- palatine nerve. The inferior surface presents a remark- able contrast to that already described; it is of a trian- gular shape, bounded externally by the alveolar pro- cess, internally by the symphisis with its fellow of the opposite side, and posteriorly by its junction with the palate; it is concave and rough for the attachment of the mucous membrane of the hard palate, while ex- ternally, as it unites with the alveolar arch, a groove appears for the branch of the posterior palatine nerve to ' anastomose with the naso-palatine; the posterior edge , is rough and serrated to articulate with the palate bone. Its internal surface is triangular in shape,—the base an- F 3106 THE OSSEOUS SYSTEM. teriorly, the apex posteriorly, marked by numerous elevated lines, vertical in direction, which dovetail with similar ones of the opposite side, constituting the arti- culation called harmonia; near the anterior extremity a deficiency exists where the bones do not come in con- tact; this is called the incisive fossa, which occupies about the inferior third in thickness of the bone; from this point it bifurcates into two distinct foramina, which fork out like the letter Y—the anterior palatine canals which open on the floor of each nostril; the incisive foramen contains the naso-palatine ganglion described by Jules Cloquet. If we now direct our attention to the nasal surface, we will observe it to spring nearly perpen- dicularly upwards from the palate plate; smooth and concave inferiorly, it corresponds to the outer wall of the inferior meatus, perforated above by a large foramen which opens into the antrum of Highmore. This ca- vity occupies the greatest part of the body of the bone, is of a pyramidal shape; the base turned internally, the apex externally, bounded above by the orbital process; in front and externally by the facial, behind by the zygomatic, below by the alveolar, and internally it is closed in by four bones,—the lachrymal anteriorly, the palateposteriorly, the ethmoidabove, and inferior spongy below; these, by their apposition, convert the large foramen into a mere chink, which is further constricted by the mucous membrane, which is thrown into loose folds around its edges. The superior maxillary articulates with two bones of the head,—the frontal and ethmoid, occasionally with the sphenoid, and with all the bones of the face, which it is unnecessary to enumerate, except the infe- rior maxillary. It has eight processes,—the orbital, alveolar, palatine, zygomatic, malar, nasal process, crest, and spine. Its proper foramina are four,—the anterior palatine canal, foramen antri, infra-orbital, and dental; its common, the same number,—the foramen incisivum, posterior palatine, nasal duct, and spheno-maxillary fis- sure. This bone is very early in its development; ossi- fication being apparent in its alveolar arch about the fifth week Another osseous point is said to exist for that portion of the bone which supports the incisorTHE PALATE BONES. 107 teeth. The suture which connects this to the body of the bone has been occasionally observed, even in the adult, running from the septum between the outer in- cisor and canine tooth inAvards to the back part of the incisive fossa, and afterwards extending upwards to the nasal process, where it is gradually lost. This, on either side, would circumscribe a segment corresponding to the intermaxillary bone in certain animals, and its arrest of development would account for the occurrence of harelip. A second fissure is likewise sometimes seen extending from the edge of the orbit to the infra-orbital foramen; this can only be considered as a continuation of the canal of the same name, which in early life is al- ways incomplete. In the foetus the superior maxilla is remarkable for the extreme shortness of its vertical measurement arising from the non-development of the antrum, and its great length from before backwards, the teeth not having as yet emerged from the tuberosity. In old age the loss of those implements of mastication bestow upon it something of a similar character. Palate Bones.—These are found lying immediately behind the superior maxillary, and have been divided into two parts,—a horizontal and vertical plate, which unite with each other externally nearly at a right angle. The horizontal plate is irregularly quadrilateral, presents two surfaces, a superior and an inferior, and four margins,—an anterior, a posterior, an internal, and ex- ternal. The superior surface, or nasal, is smooth, concave from side to side, forming the floor of the inferior meatus of the nose; bounded internally by an elevated lip, which articulates with the vomer, and which termi- nates posteriorly in a sharp-pointed process, the spine, which gives attachment to the tensor palati and azygos uvulse. The inferior surface is grooved from side to side, and covered with the mucous membrane of the palate, and pierced by a foramen externally for the transmission of the posterior palatine nerve and artery; two or three smaller foramina issue from this, perforat- ing the posterior part of the bone, for the accessory twigs of the nerve for the supply of the neighbouring structures. Of its margins the internal is short, thick, and rough, for articulating with its fellow of the oppo-108 THE OSSEOUS SYSTEM. site side; the posterior smooth and concave, and has attached to it the soft palate; the anterior rough for unitingwith the superior maxilla; the external stretches backwards and outwards, and terminates in a pyramidal process,—thepterygoid; its base turned inwards, its apex outwards; on its upper surface it presents three well- marked grooves, the central, forming the greater portion of the posterior palatine canal; the lateral, not so well marked, articulates with the internal and external ptery- goid plates, between which it is firmly wedged. If we now direct our attention to the vertical plate, we will find it to be likewise quadrilateral, but larger and thin- ner than the preceding. It accordingly presents two surfaces,—an internal and external, and four margins,— an inferior, anterior, a posterior, and superior. On the internal surface we observe two horizontal ridges and two grooves; the inferior ridge is the best marked, and supports the posterior extremity of the inferior spongy bone; the superior is only visibletowards the anterior part for the middle spongy to rest on. The grooves are concave from above downwards, and extremely smooth, corres- ponding to the inferior and middle meatuses of the nose. The external surface is convex, and also smooth, forming the internal boundary of one of the most important fossae at the base of the cranium,—the spheno-maxillary, con- taining the superior maxillary nerve, Meckel's ganglion, and internal maxillary artery. Of its four margins the inferior becomes continuous with the horizontal plate nearly at a right angle; its anterior is very thin, arti- culates below with the superior maxilla, and above with the OS planum of ethmoid; the posterior is grooved for the palatine canal, and unites with the pterygoid plates; the superior is remarkable for being surmounted by two processes,—one anterior, and much more ele- vated than the other,—the orbital; the other, posterior, thin and sharp,—the sphenoidal; a deep notch, forming two-thirds of a circle, divides them from each other, and across this the body of the sphenoid is thrown, convert- ing it into a foramen for the passage of the spheno-pa- latine nerves and arteries; the anterior or orbital pro- cess is of a conical figure, and presents two non-articular facettes,—one external, corresponding to the spheno-109 THE NASAL BONES. maxillary fissure, the other, superior and anterior, form- ing part of the floor of the orbit, and three articular,— one in front and above to unite with the orbital plate of the superior maxilla; one behind and above for the body of the sphenoid; and one internally for the eth- moid. An imperfect cell is usually found in this process, which communicates with the sphenoidal sinus. The posterior process is thin and prolonged backwards to articulate with the roots of the pterygoid plates as they springfrom its body, and henceitsname,—thesphenoidal. The Palate unites with two bones of the head,—the ethmoid and sphenoid, and four of the face; its fellow, the superior maxilla, the inferior spongy, and vomer. It has seven processes,—the horizontal and vertical plates, the pterygoid, crest, spine, orbital, and sphe- noidal. Its foramina are two proper—the palatine hole and its accessory,—and two common—the spheno-max- illary and spheno-palatine canal; the two last will be more particularly alluded to in our description of the cranium. It is developed from a single point of ossifi- cation, which is visible about the sixth week at the ex- ternal inferior part, or the junction of the two plates with the pterygoid process. In the foetus its vertical measurement is less than its transverse, and it is also much broader comparatively in the antero-posterior direction. Nasal Bones.—These are two in number, and form part of the roof of the nose. In figure they are oblong, narrow and thick above, broader and thin below. They are of variable shape in different individuals: in some being flat, in others concave or convex; presenting for ex- amination an anterior and a posterior surface, a superior and an inferior extremity, and an internal and external margin. The anterior surface is smooth, and corres- ponds to the integuments and pyramidalis nasi; the posterior, concave and marked by a groove, for the nasal twig of the ophthalmic, is covered by the pituitary mem- brane ; the superior extremity is rough, thick, and serrated to articulate with the internal angular process of the os fronds; the inferior, sharp and thin, sometimes notched, is connected to the nasal cartilages; the internal edge thick and bevilled, so that their anterior parts come in110 THE OSSEOUS SYSTEM. contact, leaving a groove between them posteriorly to receive the spine of the frontal and perpendicular plate of the ethmoid; its external is almost straight, and smooth to unite with the process of the superior maxillary. The nasal articulates with two bones of the head,—the ethmoid and frontal; and three of the face,—the superior maxillary, vomer, and its fellow of the opposite side. It is developed from a single point of ossification, which is visible about the eighth or ninth week. The OssA Unguis or Lachrymal are found in the an- terior part of the orbital cavity, and are two in number. They are ex tremely thin like paper, quadrilateral in shape, and accordingly present two surfaces,—an internal and external, and four margins,—a superior, an inferior, an anterior, and a posterior. The external surface is marked by a perpendicular ridge, which divides it into two por- tions,—aYi anterior and a posterior; the former is deeply grooved and porous, and enters into the formation of the nasal duct; the posterior is larger, slightly concave, and assists in completing the inner wall of the orbit, the ridge which separates them terminates below in a hook, and gives origin to the tensor tarsi muscle. The internal surface is slightly concave, owing to a depression which exists on it, corresponding to the ridge on the opposite side; that portion which lies anterior to it corresponds to the middle meatus, while that posterior, covers in the ethmoidal cells. Its anterior margin is nearly straight for articulation with the nasal process of the superior maxillary; its posterior extremely thin, and shorter, unites Avith the os planum of the ethmoid; its inferior, slightly denticulated, is joined to the orbital plate of the superior maxillary, sending downwards and backwards a long process to meet the inferior turbinated bone; the superior, the shortest and thickest of the whole, articulates with the frontal. The lachrymal articulates with two bones of the head: the frontal and ethmoid, and two of the face,—the su- perior maxillary and inferior turbinated. It is developed from a single point of ossification, which is visible from the thirteenth to the fourteenth week. Inferior Turbinated Bones.—These are two in number, situated in the cavity of the nose, on its outerVOMER. Ill 1 wall, below the ethmoid. They are thin and rough, owing t to the numerous grooves with which they are marked, for t the veins and arteries which ramify on them under the I pituitary membrane. They present for examination an 3 internal and external surface, an upper and lower mar- i gin, and an anterior and a posterior extremity; the inter- inal surface is convex and turned towards the septum, 1 from which it is usually separated by a narrow interval, : sometimes it is in contact with it; the external surface ;is concave, forming a large portion of the inferior : meatus; the superior border is articular and irregular, ' being very thin anteriorly, where it rests on the inferior horizontal ridge, on the nasal process of the superior maxilla; moreposteriorlyis athin elevated portion,—the lachrymal process, slightly grooved, forming a part of the nasal duct, and articulating with the os unguis; still more posteriorly it is bent downwards and out- wards into a small triangiilar plate, which lies against and assists in closing the antrum Highmorianum, while above it articulates with the os planum of the ethmoid; still farther back it rests on the inferior horizontal ridge of the palate bone; the inferior margin is thicker, free, curved outwards, and lies at very variable distances from the floor of the nose; its anterior extremity is much broader than its posterior, which indicates at once the side of the nose to which it belongs. The inferior turbinated articulates with one bone of the head,—the ethmoid, and three bones of the face,— the OS unguis, superior maxillary, and palate.. It is developed from a single point of ossification, which is visible from the fifth to the sixth month. Vomer—This is a single bone, placed in the median line, forming the posterior part of the septum nasi. It is usually perpendicular, but it may incline to either side, sometimes in a very remarkable degree. In figure it is quadrilateral, presenting two surfaces, correspond- ing to either nostril, marked by some small foramina and grooves, for the passage of veins and nerves. It has four margins,—a superior or sphenoidal, an inferior or maxil- lary, an anterior or ethmoid, and a posterior pharyngeal. The superior border presents an elongated fissure for the azygos process of the sphenoid, with two alaj spreadingTHE OSSEOUS SYSTEM. 112 ont on either side to articulate with corresponding grooves on the under parts of the body of the bone; its inferior edge is thin, and is received into a cleft formed for its reception by the union of the palate and maxillary of opposite sides; its anterior margin is fissured above, where it receives the nasal lamella of the ethmoid; rough and serrated below, where it unites with the septal cartilage; its posterior edge is sharp and thin, looks downwards and backwards, and appears free, as the division between the posterior nares. The vomer articulates with two bones of the head,— the ethmoid and sphenoid; and four of the face,—the two palate, and two superior maxillary. It is developed from a single point of ossification, which makes its ap- pearance at its anterior margin about the eighth week; at birth it is merely a bony groove, which embraces the cartilage in front, and its complete development pro- ceeds very slowly. Inferior Maxilla This is a single bone, and has been compared in shape to a horse-shoe. In order to examine it we will divide it into a body, sides, rami, coronoid, and condyloid processes. The body, which is the most anterior part, is square in shape, present- ing an anterior and a posterior surface, and an upper and a lower margin; its lateral parts becoming continuous with the rami at each side, at a very obtuse angle; the anterior surface is convex, having in the mesial line a vertical elevation,—the point of union between the two portions of opposite sides: this has been called the sym- physis menti, and it terminates below in a prominence, triangular in shape,—the genial process; external to this, and extending outwards nearly as far as the men- tal hole, is a superficial depression, for the origin of the quadratus menti; above it is another, smaller, and not so well-marked, limited externally by the prominence of the canine tooth,—the myrtiform or incisor fossa; from it arises the levator labii inferioris; the posterior sur- face is concave and much smoother, a mere line marking out the point of junction between the two bones, and to this the frsenum linguEe or mucous fold connected to the under surface is attached; near its lower part we observe four tubercles,—the genial eminences; from theTHE INFERIOR MAXILLA. 113 t two superior the genio-hyoglossi of opposite sides arise, a and from the two inferior, the genio-hyoidei; on either 5 side of the two last, and a little lower down, is a slight L depression,—the digastric pit, into which the nmscle of t that name is inserted; the upper edge of the body is I perforated by four foramina for the incisor teeth, the : septa of division between each being marked by slight (depressions, more deeply on the anterior than posterior : surface; the inferior border of the body is rounded and ] prominent, one of the characteristic distinctions of the 1 human species; the sides of the lower jaw curve back- ' wards and outwards, as far as the angle where they 1 unite with the ascending ramus; the external surface iis slightly convex, and at its anterior part, and a little 1 below its centre, from above downwards, is a round 1 foramen,—the mental, which gives passage to the nerve I and artery of the same name, both branches of the dental; i an oblique line commences below this hole, and passes up- ' wards and backwards, to terminate in the external lip of 1 the coronoid process; to this is attached, anteriorly, the 1 triangularis oris muscle, whilst behindit is crossed nearly 1 at a right angle by the facial artery; the internal surface i is very irregular, and presents a ridge similar to that I on the outside, but more elevated, passing from before, upwards and backwards, to terminate in a spur-like ■ process, overhanging the dental foramen; this has been ' called the mylo-hyoid ridge, which gives attachment by its two anterior thirds to the muscle of that name, ; and by its posterior third to the superior constrictor of the pharynx; above it, but anteriorly, is a superficial ' depression for the sublingual gland, and below it, but ; posteriorly, another for the submaxillary; a slight groove is likewise found inferior and parallel to it, which lodges a small nerve, the mylo-hyoid, a branch of the inferior dental for the supply of that muscle; the upper margin of the side is studded with the depressions for the molar teeth; it is curved inwards, particularly at its posterior part, and terminates in a shallow groove, which is gradually lost on the anterior edge of the co- ronoid process, while the inferior is rounded and curved outwards; the rami join the sides of the bone at variable angles, at different periods of life; in the very young itTHE OSSEOUS SYSTEM. 114 can scarcely be said to exist at all, but with succeeding years it gradually becomes more developed, so as to ap- proach at the adult period to a right angle; with de- clining life it again diminishes, and as the teeth decay and fall, it gradually becomes more obtuse, assuming in old age, with its imbecility, the characteristic features of childhood. We will examine it as it appears in the adult; at this period it is quadrilateral in shape, pre- senting two surfaces, an internal and external, and four margins, an anterior, a posterior, inferior, and superior; the external surface is generally flat, but rough in order to afford firmer attachment to the masseter muscle, the anterior portion of which is inserted into the lower part in front of its angle, while the aponeurotic fibres of its posterior part, gliding beneath the other, are firmly implanted into the upper part of the ramus, as high as the sigmoid notch; the internal surface is very irregular; the angle and the parts adjacent are elevated, and rough for the insertion of the internal pterygoid and stylo- maxillary ligament; above, and a little anterior to this is the large dental foramen, leading obliquely down- wards and forwards into the canal of the same name, for the transmission of the dental vessels and nerves for the supply of the teeth; the orifice of this canal is bounded superiorly and internally by a sharp process, the spur, which gives attachment to the internal lateral ligament of the jaw; above and posteriorly the bone is concave and smooth, where the internal maxillary glides over it in order to reach the pterygoid space, while more anteriorly it is elevated, and rough for the attachment of the buccino-pharyngeal aponeurosis. We have already stated that the alveolar process posteriorly is prolonged as a groove, forming the anterior edge of the coronoid pro- cess ; this groove inferiorly gives attachment to the bucci- nator muscle, while above it afi'ords insertion to the ante- rior fibres of the temporal; the posterior edge is rounded, slightly concave, and is imbedded in the parotid gland; the superior presents two remarkable processes, the coro- noid anteriorly, andcondyloid posteriorly; these are sepa- rated by a depression, concave and nearly semicircular, its margins exceedingly sharp—the sigmoid notch, which gives passage to the masseteric nerve and artery, forTHE TEETH. 115 the supply of that muscle; the coronoid process is trian- gular in shape, the base below, the apex above, the latter curved outwards and backwards, imbedded in the ten- don of the temporal muscle, which it splits like a wedge; the condyloid process is broad at its root below, and flattened from side to side, becoming constricted as it ascends upwards and backwards,—the neck; this is grooved anteriorly and internally, for the insertion of the external pterygoid muscle, while it is rounded and smooth behind; it is encircled by the attachment of the capsular ligament; it is surmounted by an oval facette, covered with cartilage, elongated from without inwards and slightly backwards, looking upwards and forwards, and buried in the interarticular cartilage, which separates it from the glenoid cavity. The inferior maxilla articulates with one bone only of the head, the temporal, and has two proper fora- mina, the openings of the dental canal. Its processes are also two,—the coronoid and condyloid. It has also two points of ossification for each lateral portion,—one for the mass of the bone in general, the other for the inner border of the dental groove. Ossification takes place very early in this bone from the fourth to the fifth week; and the alveolar portion, which we have stated was distinct, becomes united to the other about the seventh or eighth. We have already alluded to the changes which it undergoes at the several periods of life, modifying the character of its angle; and we will merely state that the ridges we have described on the outer and inner surfaces of its sides, stretching ob- liquely downwards, forwards, and inwards, seem to di- vide them into two distinct parts,—a superior or alveo- lar, constituting about two-thirds in depth of the bone anteriorly; and an anterior or basilar, the foundation on which the entire bone appears to be built. THE TEETH. The teeth are divided into permanent and temporary or deciduous, and are variously considered to apper- tain to the neural and dermal skeletons; they are sixteen in number in each jaw, and divisible into four incisors, two canine, and ten molares. Each tooth hasTHE OSSEOUS SYSTEM. 116 a crown, neck, and fang, the first being free above the gum; the second surrounded by the fibro-mucous tissue; and the third imbedded in its proper alveolus. These several parts undergo modifications resulting from' age, position, use, &c., although strictly formed according to a single type. Incisors—The crown is somewhat triangular, con- stricted towards the neck, fi.at or convex from side to side on the anterior surface; deeply excavated, on the posterior to a chisel edge. The two central are the larger, and those of the upper predominate in size remarkably over those of the lower jaw; the neck is constricted and rough, with numerous small apertures for the transmission of vessels; the fang or root, conical in shape, is planted in the alveolar depression, and pre- sents at the extremity an opening for the transmission of the nutritious artery, and a branch of the dental nerve, to the pulp; a vertical section reveals a cavity within, corresponding in outline to the tooth, and oc- cupied during life by the dental pulp. Canine Laniares or Cuspidati.—The crown con- stricted superiorly into a blunted point, convex ante- riorly, and cut ofl^" from below on the posterior surface; the neck is also constricted, and surrounded by the gum; the fang, thick, strong, and much prolonged, is planted in the alveolus, whilst its gradual increase from point to neck protects the artery and nervous filament from pressure. MoLARES.—These consist of five, three posterior on each side, true molars, or multicuspidati, and two on each side anteriorly, false molars, or bicuspidati. These latter present a crown with a double tubercle su- periorly,—the external, the more elevated of the two, convex internally and externally, short from above downwards, surrounded by a constricted neck; the fang is still single, with a linear depression on both surfaces, showing a tendency to that future division which sometimes, in those of the upper jaw exists, espe- cially in the posterior pair. True molares:—the crown is square, surmounted by three or four tubercles, convex on both surfaces, generally exhibiting two linear depres- sions, running from above downwards, shaping the crown like a wool-pack; the neck is constricted andTHE TEETH. 117 ! short, the fangs three or four, with a corresponding 1 number of neural and vascular foramina. Occasionally i in the lower set two roots only occur, and a divergent ■ excurvation exists, which increases their security. We 1 have noticed this arrangement much more frequently in ■ the upper set, although the contrary opinion is usually I entertained. The pulp cavity is figured like a Maltese I cross, large and well marked. Structure.—A tooth consists of three hard tissues and : a central vascular matrix,—the enamel surrounding the I crown, the dentine or tooth ivory, intermediately placed ' between the enamel and the pulp cavity, and the crusta petrosa, or cementum, holding the same relation to the : fang as the enamel to the crown. This latter structure is the hardest in the human body, smooth on the exter- : nal surface, more rough internally ; thicker on the 1 summit than the sides of the crown, which it wholly ; surrounds. In order to examine its structure, a section ■ must be prepared for the microscope, both longitudinal ; and transverse. It consists of a series of hexagonal : fibres, with opposed surfaces mutually corresponding, • one extremity free, the second resting on and attached to the surface of the dentine. Maceration in acid proves these fibres to be merely an organic sheath, containing a crystaline deposit (fluoride of calcium), and consequently a modified cell-structur& We have been unable to de- tect any wave in the enamel fibres, but an obliquity, in many cases amounting to a single curve, is often visi- ble. The figure is best observed in an oblique fracture of the edge of a section, when the surface appears beau- tifully crystaline. Dentine.—This structure gives form and strength to the tooth, and consists of tubular fibres, commencing by large, open extremities on the surface of the pulp cavity, from thence radiating and dividing dichoto- mously in their course to reach the enamel, to which they are attached by filamentous extremities, but where they reach the crusta petrosa, they are the efferent tubes of osseous lacunse, which they form by dilata- tions of their own cavities. Each tube has a proper osseous wall, granular when examined with a high power, and much denser than the intertubular struc-THE OSSEOUS SYSTEM. 118 ture in which the cylinders are imbedded in their course. The tubes present two systems of curves,—pri- mary and secondary; the angles, by alternately inter- cepting the light, produce their apparently baccated condition. The object of these osseous vessels appears to be for the purpose of conveying the elements of nu- trition to the most remote portions of the dental struc- ture, being similar in function to the Haversian canals of long bones ; they likewise, by their direction and numerous incurvations, produce strength, and confer a certain degree of elasticity on the tooth structure. Cementum, crusta petrosa, or tooth bone, surrounds the root, lines the vascular canal for some distance, and at the emergence of the tooth covers the enamel with a thin stratum. It is thickest at the extremity of the fang, and presents true lacunas and canaliculi exactly similar to the bones of the true skeleton. Development.—This process consists of four stages, the papillar, follicular, saccular, and eruptive. It will be preferable in an anatomical work merely to present a general view of the subject, referring to trea- tises on structural anatomy for more exact informa- tion. (See Miiller by Baily, Todd and Bowman's Phy- siology of Man, and Dr. Carpenter's beautiful work on General Physiology.) It may be stated generally, that about the sixth week the superior maxillary bone presents a shallow groove anterior to the palate-plate or its rudiment, lined by mucous membrane. The first stage consists of the development of a series of papillae; within the sulcus folds are produced, separating the papillas, the rudiments of the future alveolar septa, representing the follicular stage. From the margins of the follicle, opercula or coverlids overlap the papillae, forming closed saccules, or the third stage. The crown of the tooth is first developed from the dentinal pulp, the enamel by a second and distinct pulp, the ossifying sur- face being the columnar epithelium of the enclosed mucous membrane; the cementum is a subsequent formation, probably derived from a distinct membrane, which, from the fact that the enamel is covered by a thin layer at the period of eruption, would seem to119 THE TEETH. rline the sac external to the pulp of the last described .-structure. Taking these changes more in detail at the -sixth week of foetal life, the upper jaw presents a pro- nminent mucous fold anteriorly,—the rudiment of the liip; and a second, internal to this,—the nascent palate, ; separated from the former by a groove, all receiving a .covering from the proper mucous membrane. A little iilater a ridge is developed from the floor of the groove aanteriorly, — the rudiment of the external alveolar rridge. The order of parts from before backwards;— ffirst, the lip; second, a depression; third, the external salveolar ridge; fourth, primary dental groove ; fifth, I'fold representing the internal alveolar border ; sixth, tthe palate. Order of primary formation:—papilla of tfirst deciduous molar, seventh week ; of canine, eighth \week; of incisor,—the central having precedence,—ninth \week; second molar, tenth week. When the germs of :iall the deciduous teeth are perfected, those in the lower ijaw being a little later prolonged until the eleventh vweek, the follicular stage is completed. At the thirteenth week the closure of the follicles and their conversion ; into saccules is accomplished. During the fourteenth a and fifteenth weeks, the primary dental groove is closed, '.but a portion nearer to the surface remains open,—the ^secondary dental groove; processes from the dental sac tare prolonged into it to form the saccules of the perma- 1 nent teeth; those are styled cavities of reserve, the pro- Uongations for the incisors preceding the canine and imolares. The secondary dental groove is now closed, and at the fifth month papillae are developed, produc- ling saccules like to the primary forms; these like- \ wise recede from the surface of the gum, and lie internal • to the deciduous sacs. The first permanent molar is . developed, not in the secondary dental groove, but by i a papilla, situated in the posterior extremity of the 1 primitive sulcus; the reserve cavities of the two last 1 molares being situated superficial to the former in the ; secondary groove, a sufficient distance being procured tfor their development by the elongation of the jaws 1 backward. Prior to that period, the first permanent 1 molar is imbedded in the coronoid process and tuber of I the maxillary bones. This permanent first molar is120 THE OSSEOUS SYSTEM. peculiar in being developed in the primitive dental groove, like the milk teeth, from which it diifers, how- ever, in not being deciduous. The third molar, or wisdom tooth, does not reach its proper range with the other teeth until the eighteenth or twentieth year.* The stage of eruption is accomplished by absorption and continued growth of the tooth below, and occurs in the following succession :—The four central incisors about the seventh month, those of the lower jaw first; lateral incisors next appear, between seventh and tenth months ; anterior molares at the commencement of the second year; the canine between the fourteenth and twentieth months; and the posterior molares from the eighteenth to the thirty-sixth month. The permanent teeth appear at the following ages (see " Carpenter's Physiology"):— Central Incisors developed at 8 years. Lateral Incisors „ 9 » First Bicuspid „ 10 „ Second Bicuspid „ 11 » Canines „ 12-12^-years. Second Molars „ 12-14^ „ The second series of teeth are requisite, in conse- quence of the increase in the size of the jaws, and it is on this account that the primary set become deciduous. These b^ones are considered merely as calcified cell transformations of the elements of the mucous mem- brane, similar to corneous tissues. They difi'er in many respects from the bones of the true skeleton: namely, in being exposed, devoid of periosteum, con- taining chondrine instead of gelatine; in the amount of fluoride of calcium found in the enamel; in being deci- duous; and, with few exceptions, not lasting the life of the individual where senility is much prolonged. Other circumstances strengthen the opinion of their being more nearly allied to the dermal structures. Amongst the more obvious are the attachment of the teeth to the jaw by ligaments in thelophius piscatorum, • Goodsir, in Edinburgh Medical and Surgical Journal.THE OS HTOIDES. 121 and their arrangement on the tongue, palate, and gills of the salmon, and the similar organization of the beak in birds. Os Hyoides.—This bone is single and situated in the anterior part of the neck, between the larynx and tongue. It is parabolic in shape, or rather, it resembles in a great measure the small Greek upsilon, and hence its name. In order to examine it we will divide it into a body, two lesser cornua or appendices, two greater cornua, and two cartila- ginous nodules at the extremities of these last. The body is quadrilateral in shape, presenting two surfaces,—an anterior and posterior; and two margins,—a superior and inferior; the anterior surface is prominent, rough, and convex, looks upwards and forwards, and affords attach- ment to three muscles,—the mylo-hyoid, genio-hyoid, and genio-hyoglossus; the posterior is concave, looks downwards and backwards, and its depression is filled with a mass of condensed cellular tissue, at one period de- scribed as a gland, the duct of which was said to have opened on the upper and posterior part of the tongue; the lower edge is more prominent than the upper; it has in- serted into it the sterno-hyoid internally, and the omo- hyoid externally; the superior margin is curved back- wards, it gives attachment to the anterior thyro-hyoid membrane, and to a strong ligamentous structureof a yel- lowish colour, which is prolonged into the centre of the tongue,—the analogue to the lingual bone in the lower class of animals; the lateral extremities of the body be- come continuous with the greater cornua at an obtuse angle, the junction between them being sometimes car- tilaginous, and sometimes osseous; at their point of union, but situated superiorly, is the appendix, or lesser cornu; it is of a conical shape, directed upwards, backwards, and outwards, of variable length, affording attachment to the stylo-hyoid muscle and ligament, and to small muscular slips of the hyoglossus and middle constrictor of the pharynx. The greater cornua stretch backwards and outwards, diverging from each other, and terminate posteriorly in a cartilaginous tubercle, which in the natural condition of the parts occupies a cleft, bounded above by the lingual artery, below by the superior thy- roid, and posteriorly by the external carotid; it gives G122 THE OSSEOUS SYSTEM. attachment to the posterior thyro-hyoid ligament. These processes of the bone differ essentially from the body; they are much smaller and rounder, tapering gradually oft' as they proceed backwards. The thyro-hyoid muscle and membrane are inserted into them below, the hyo- glossus and middle constrictor above. The OS hyoides has no immediate connexion with any other bone of the skeleton, but this rule is occasionally liable to exception, as the styloid process of the temporal has been sometimes observed to articulate with it. This, however, would appear to depend on the ossification of the stylo-hyoid ligament—a structural change which it is exceedingly prone to undergo. It is developed from five ossific points,—one for the body, one for each cornu, and one for each appendix. These at birth are seldom or ever found to be united, but are separated by carti- laginous intervals, which are sometimes persistent for a lengthened period. Having now described the several bones of the cranium and face in detail, we shall next proceed to an examina- tion of them as a whole—a subject, no doubt, of much complexity, but at the same time of paramount import- ance, as a thorough acquaintance with the several regions, fossae, and foramina are essentially requisite in order properly to understand the intricate anatomy of the head and neck. It may be necessary here to remark that it is our intention to confine our observations for the present to the cranium, properly speaking, excluding the face, which in general may be said to form about one-fourth of the whole mass of the skull; but as this proportion is not always exact, varying in some degree in the several races of man, physiologists have attempted to define with some degree of precision the capacities of both in relation to each other as a standard of intellect, which, to say the least of it, appears to be exceedingly proble- matical. Amongst the various theories which have been propounded on this subject, it may be, however, neces- sary briefiy to allude to that of Camper; he proposed what is termed the measurement of the facial angle, by123 THE SKULL. G 2 dropping a vertical line from the most prominent part of the forehead to the incisor teeth, and another from the last-named point to the tube of the ear. The angle in- cluded between these has been found to vary from 80° to 85° in the European, from 70° to 75° in the Mongolian, from 60° to 65° in the Negro, 40'' in the Chimpanzee, and 30° in the ouran outang. This idea, extremely inge- nious, and supported by the foregoing facts, contributes to support the views inculcated by comparative ana- tomy, which teaches us that in the ascending scale of intellectual development the face and cranium are in an inverse ratio to each other, and that the one is always increased at the expense of the other. We also find the brain, and, of course, its bony case, comparatively larger in the child than in the adult, while that of the male is always much more capacious than that of the female. The Cranium, with its facial appendage removed from it, is of an ovoid figure, more expanded behind than in front, flattened on its inferior surface anteriorly, as well as on its sides, while superiorly it is smooth, rounded, and convex. It does not necessarily follow that its two lateral portions should exactly correspond in size, as variations exist more or less obvious in all; but where the deviation is very striking it has been generally found that some cerebral affection had been evidenced during life. As it is a hollow cavity, we must give it two surfaces,—an external and internal; the one in its general character convex, the other con- cave. We will begin with the first. The exterior of the skull may be divided into the sinciput or frontal region ; the bregma or vertex, with the lateral regions on each side; the occiput, and true base. Of these the first or sinciput occupies the anterior superior part of the cranium, and is formed solely by the frontal bones. It is smooth and convex, bounded anteriorly by the supraciliary ridges, and the suture between the frontal and nasal bones; posteriorly by the coronal suture; and laterally by the temporal ridges. Immediately above the edge of the orbit we observe a small hole, sometimes a mere notch, for the supra-orbital nerve and artery; higher up there is a slight transverse depression, above which it becomes124 THE OSSEOUS SYSTEM. again prominent,—the frontal eminences, the points where the first ossific nuclei are deposited. Between these two elevations is generally observed the imperfect remnant of the suture where the opposite bones were disunited in early life; at this period the posterior su- perior angle was rounded, as already alluded to in the description of the separate bone, giving rise to a de- ficiency in the osseous structure,—the anterior superior fontanelle. The bregma or vertex is of a quadrilateral shape, bounded anteriorly by the coronal suture, be- hind by the lambdoidal, laterally by the temporal ridges. It also presents in the mesial line a suture,—the sagittal, which lies between two well-marked eminences on either side of the parietal. Two small foramina are generally found near the posterior part of the suture, for the transmission of a small vein from the longitudinal sinus. We have already stated that this bone is also rounded at its angles, where it forms in foetal life a part of the two superior and two lateral fontanelles. The occipital region is exceedingly circumscribed, being entirely formed of the upper part of the occipital bone, bounded above by the lambdoidal suture, and below by the superior semicircular line. It is smooth and convex, is covered by the occipito-frontalis, and the ramifications of the occipital artery and nerve. The lateral regions are defined by a curved line, drawn from the external orbital process of the os frontis, backwards to the point where the superior semicircular line on the occipital bone strikes the os frontis. This would form its superior boundary; its inferior is constituted by the zygomatic arch; its horizontal root as far back as the auditory meatus; it now bends downwards, and is limited by the auditory process and edge of the mas- toid as far back as the lambdoid suture. According to this definition we would find the lateral regions to be semicircular in form, flattened anteriorly, and slightly convex posteriorly. It presents for consideration the following parts:—most anteriorly the temporal fossa, bounded above by the temporal ridge, below by the horizontal root of the zygoma and crest on the great wincv of the sphenoid, which separates it Irom the zygo- matic fossa, and it is formed by the following bones,THE SKULL. 125 from before backwards:—malar, frontal, great wing of sphenoid, squamous plate of temporal and parietal; in shape it is semicircular, and it affords attachment to the temporal muscle, and by its upper margin to the strong aponeurosis of the same name. Below, and slightly posterior to the temporal fossa, is the external auditory meatus, oval in figure, bounded above by the horizontal root of the zygoma, behind by the mastoid, and in front and below by the auditory process; it forms the orifice of the osseous tube of the organ of hearing; immediately posterior to it, is the mastoid process, displaying unequal degrees of development at various periods of life, its size increasing with age; it is nipple-shaped, and rough for the attachment of the muscles already described with the separate bone, and presents at its posterior superior part the emunctory hole of Santorini, commu- nicating with the great lateral sinus internally. If we now direct our attention to the true base, we will find it to be irregular on its surface, but rather quadrilateral in its outline. That part behind the foramen magnum presents in the mesial line the occipital protu- berance for the attachment of the ligamentxim nuchse; the superior and inferior semicircular lines with the groove separating them; the muscles attached to these have been already mentioned. Passing still farther forwards, we arrive at the foramen magnum, oval in shape, and long antero-posteriorly, for the transmission of the spinal cord; its vessels,—vertebral artery and spinal accessory nerve. On either side of it are the two condyles, oval in shape, and very prominent, look- ing downwards, forwards, and outwards, internally marked by a small pit for the insertion of the cheek ligaments; perforated anteriorly and posteriorly by two foramina; that in front being large and round, for the passage of the ninth nerve; that behind small, and oc- casionally absent, for the transmission of a small vein to the lateral sinus; depressed externally, they become continuous with a ridge,—the jugular, into which is inserted the rectus capitis lateralis; external to this ridge is the small groove for the occipital artery, then a slight elevation, external to which is the elongated fossa, for the origin of the digastric, which is bounded126 THE OSSEOUS SYSTEM. on the outside by the tip of the mastoid process. Two foramina are situated anterior to the parts we have enumerated,—one internal, large and ovoid in shape, the posterior lacerated, for the transmission of the in- ternal jugular vein, and eighth pair of nerves. This hole is formed between the temporal and occipital bones, and is bounded behind by the jugular ridge, in front by the carotid foramen, internally by the anterior condy- loid, and externally by the styloid process of the tem- poral bone; the other much smaller and rounder,—the stylo-mastoid, for the exit of the facial nerve and en- trance of the artery of the same name; it lies between the styloid process in front, the mastoid behind, and pos- terior lacerated internally. Eeturning now to the mesial line, we find the cuneiform process of the occi- pital, stretching upwards and forwards to join the body of the sphenoid; it is flattened but rough, broader behind than in front, giving attachment by its posterior border to the apparatus ligamentosus colli; more an- teriorly to the two portions of the occipito-atlantoid ligament, the rectus capitis anticus minor and major, middle and superior constrictors; and ultimately it is covered by the mucous membrane of the upper part of the mouth. This process of the occipital is bounded on either side by the petrous portion of the temporal bones; these divaricate posteriorly, converge anteriorly, terminating in front in a remarkable foramen,—the anterior lacerated, formed by the union of the sphenoid, occipital, and temporal; in the natural condition of the parts it is filled up by cartilage, to which is attached in- feriorly the Eustachian tube; and superiorly the carotid artery rests on it, while it is likewise perforated by the Vidian nerve, the canal for which opens on it ante- riorly. Behind this hole the bone presents a broad, rough expansion for the origin of the levator palati and petro-pharyngeal aponeurosis, and still farther back a rounded hole,—the carotid, for the entrance of the artery of the same name, and the branches of the sym- pathetic nerve which accompany it. The carotid fora- men is bounded behind by the posterior lacerated hole; anteriorly and internally by the petro-pharyngeal apo- neurosis, externally and anteriorly by the Eustachian127 ZYGOMATIC FOSSA, tube, directly anteriorly by the middle meningeal ar- tery and internal lateral ligament of the lower jaw, and externally by the vaginal process of the temporal bone. On the outer side of the carotid foramen is the glenoid cavity, oval in shape, concave, and covered with cartilage; bounded anteriorly by the transverse root of the zygoma, externally by its horizontal root and auditory process, posteriorly by the styloid and vaginal processes of the temporal bone, and internally by the spinous and styloid of the sphenoid, the internal lateral ligament, and middle meningeal artery; tra- versing it from without, forwards, and inwards, we have the Glaserian fissure, for the passage of the parts already enumerated in the description of the separate bone. Between the outer edge of the petrous portion of the temporal bone and great wing of the sphenoid is a groove, directed backwards and outwards; it termi- nates in an osseous canal, which, about three-quarters of an inch in length, forms the bony portion of the Eustachian tube. From this point, as we have already premised, it will be necessary for us to consider the remainder of the ex- ternal part of the cranium in connexion with the face, for the two are so completely blended with each other in the formation of the several fossa regions and cavi- ties, that to separate them would be only to render a subject already intricate still more complicated. We shall therefore be content to observe, that the face, taken as a whole, is of a triangular shape—its base su- periorly; its greatest vertical measurement being from above downwards, between the nasal spine of the fron- tal bone and the lowest part of the symphisis menti; its greatest transverse between the prominence of the malar bones. Its lower or guttural surface would be mapped out by a line extending backwards from the lower part of the symphisis, in the direction of the foramen magnum; it is extremely irregular, as we shall presently observe; the upper becomes completely blended with the lower and anterior part of the cranium. We will now proceed to describe in detail these several parts, commencing with the inferior surface. The zygomatic fossa is common both to the headTHE OSSEOUS SYSTEM. 128 and face; it is quadrilateral in its outline, and concave, bounded externally by the crest on the great wing of the sphenoid, internally by the external pterygoid plate, an- teriorly by the tuber maxillare, and behind by the trans- verse root of the zygoma; towards its outer part it is crossed from before backwards by the external pterygoid muscle; posteriorly and internally is the small spinous hole for the artery of the same name, lying between the spinous and styloid processes of the sphenoid, and having internal to it, the groove for the Eustachian tube; anterior and a little internal to this hole is the foramen ovale, for the transmission of the inferior maxil- lary nerve, and the anterior meningeal from the pha- ryngea ascendens. The foramen ovale is bounded an- teriorly by the origin of the internal pterygoid muscle, posteriorly by the spinous and styloid processes of the sphenoid internal lateral ligament and middle me- ningeal artery, internally by the Eustachian tube, and externally by the external pterygoid muscle. As we pass still further forwards, we arrive at a remarkable cleft, broad above and narrow below,—the pterygo- maxillary fossa; this is bounded in front by the tuber maxillare, behind by the pterygoid plates, above by the great wing of the sphenoid, below by the junction of the superior maxillary palate and pterygoid plates, internally by the nasal plate of the palate bone; while externally it is free, and opens into the zjfgomatic fossa; this bony recess is deep, and contains the superior maxil- lary nerve, Meckel's ganglion, and the terminal stage of the internal maxillary artery. To accommodate the several parts which enter and leave it, we will accord- ingly find that several foramina are found communi- cating with it; in its roof or upper part is the foramen rotundum, through which the superior maxillary nerve enters; from its floor or lower part the posterior pala- tine canal, formed by the tuber maxillare, nasal plate of the palate, and pter3'goid processes stretch down- wards, for the transmission of the posterior palatine nerve from Meckel's ganglion; its inner wall is perfo- rated by the spheno-palatine hole, for the nerve of the same name, likewise from the ganglion to enter the supe- rior meatus of the nose; this small foramen is bounded byPALATINE PROCESS. 129 G 3 the orbital process of the palate anteriorly, its nasal plate interiorly, its sphenoidal process posteriorly, and above by the body of the sphenoid. From its posterior wall the Vidian canal commences, and passes back- wards and outwards, to terminate in the anterior lace- rated foramen; it contains the nerve of the same name; from its anterior wall springs the infra-orbital canal, which opens on the face beneath the orbit, carry- ing the infra-orbital nerve and artery. We will now return to the mesial line, and examine the posteriornares; these present oval apertures, long in their vertical diameter, constricted from side to side, bounded above by the body of the sphenoid, below by the palate processes of the palate bone, externally by the internal pterygoid plates, and internally by the vomer; they communicate directly with the cavity of the pharynx, and are the channels for respiration in normal condi- tions. As we pass still farther forwards, we find lying on a plain anterior and inferior to these, the hard pa- late, parabolic in shape, with the curve directed for- wards, bounded anteriorly and laterally by the alveolar arches, and posteriorly by the free margins of the palate bones, which here present a double lunated edge, owing to the prominence of the spine in the mesial line. The hard palate is always more or less concave in all indivi- duals, but it is very variable as to its degree, extremely rough for the attachment of the mucous membrane, pre- senting, in the middle line, at the junction of its pos- terior with its two anterior thirds, a crucial ridge formed by the decussation of the sutures between the palates and superior maxillaries; that between the latter being incomplete anteriorly from the existence of the inci- sive fissure; towards its posterior and external angles ■we observe two foramina, the anterior large, the exter- nal orifice of the posterior palatine canal; the posterior much smaller, its accessory transmitting a small nerve for the supply of the soft palate. Leading from this ori- fice in a direction forwards and inwards, and bounded externally by the alveolar arch, is a deep groove, which lodges the anterior branch of the posterior palatine nerve in its course to the foramen incisivum, to form by itsTHE OSSEOUS SYSTEM. 130 anastomosis with the naso-palatine or nerve of Cotunnius the ganglion of Cloquet. We will now direct our attention to the anterior part of the face, which we have already described as being triangular in form, with the base above, the apex below formed by the prominence of the symphisis menti. Above this last, and on either side of it, are the myrti- form fossae which we have already described. Similar de- pressions exist above the incisors of the superior maxilla, which, with the canine fossae, have been likewise alluded to in the general examination of the separate bones. We will, therefore, at once proceed to the examination of those great cavities which the face presents, the nasal and orbital, commencing with the former. The anterior orifice of the nose, as viewed on the dry skull, is heart-shaped, the broader part turned down- wards and backwards—contracted, and slightly rounded above. The greater part of its margin is formed by the two superior maxillary bones, which bound it infe- riorly and laterally; the two nasal bones which complete it above, constituting a very limited portion of it. The cavity, however, taken as a whole, may be said to be conical, with a vaulted roof; the base or floor of which is turned directly downwards, separated by a vertical partition, which divided it into two lesser chambers,— the nares. It accordingly presents for examination an external wall on either side, a floor below, a roof above, and a septum. The external wall slopes gently down- wards and outwards, and is formed by the apposition of six bones; these, taken from before backwards, are the nasal process of the superior maxillary, behind which is the lachi-ymal; still farther back, the os planum of the ethmoid, below which is the inferior spongy; more posteriorly, the nasal plate of the palate, and behind this is the internal pterygoid plate. The floor, Avhich is inclined slightly downwards and backwards, concave from side to side, is composed of two bones only, or ra- ther parts of them; these are the nasal processes of the superior maxillary and palate; the roof, which is vaulted or crescentic, consists of five bones,—the two nasal and frontal, which look downwards and backwards, the cribri-THE NOSE. 131 form plate of the ethmoid, which is directed nearly ver- tically downwards, and the body of the sphenoid, the aspect of which is downwards and forwards. Five bones contribute to form the septum,—the vomer, nasal lamella of the ethmoid, azygos process of the sphenoid, with the crests of the palate and superior maxillary. Each of these nares are again subdivided into a series of minor cavities, three in number, called meatuses, which are deep grooves lying between the spongy bones. These are three in number, the two superior connected with the ethmoid, of which they form a part, as we have already stated in the description of that bone, having between them a broad fissure directed downwards and backwards,—the superior meatus. Beneath the middle turbinated bone we have the inferior, attached to all the bones constituting the outer wall, except the inter- nal pterygoid plate, as far back as which it rarely ex- tends, but a similar groove exists between it and the one above,—the middle meatus, the anterior part of which is curved upwards and forwards, while its posterior is nearly horizontal, but with a slight inclination down- wards and backwards. Between the inferior turbinated bone and the floor of the nose another channel is left, longer than the other two, but narrower towards the centre,—the inferior meatus; this receives the secretion from the other two, previous to its being expelled from the anterior orifice of the cavity, or its being swallowed with the saliva, as it invariably trickles down the back part of the pharynx. These meatuses are very apparent if we look into the posterior nares, as well as the curled appearance of the spongy bones as they lie above each other, their convexities directed towards the septum, from which they are distant generally two or three lines, but occasionally they are in contact with it. Anteriorly they have no communication with each other, but pos- teriorly their extremities are free, leaving patulous in- tervals between each, by which they freely communi- cate with each other, and with the cavity of the pharynx. The superior meatus receives the openings of the sphe- noidal sinus, the posterior ethmoidal cells, and spheno- palatine hole. The orifice of the first of these is usually single, but the cells of the ethmoid have distinct aper-132 THE OSSEOUS SYSTEM, tures, generally very small, about five or six in number. The spheno-palatine hole is found near its superior and posterior part, opening from the pterygo-maxillary fossa; it is bounded above by the body of the sphenoid, below by the nasal plate of the palate, anteriorly by its orbi- tal process, and posteriorly by its sphenoidal. From the manner in which the mucous membrane is reflected over it, the opening is not very apparent on its nasal sur- face ; it, however, transmits the spheno-palatine branches of the internal maxillary, and the nerve of the same name, from Meckel's ganglion, for the supply of the ca- vity. Into the middle meatus, which we have already stated is very curved in its figure, the frontal sinus, anterior ethmoidal cells, and foramen antri, open. The first of these, or the frontal sinus, curves downwards and backwards, and terminates in a kind of tube, the infundibulum, composed partly of bone and partly of the Schneiderian membrane; it presents a slight dilata- tion at its nasal extremity, and can be seen properly only on raising upwards the middle spongy bone. By this means we also bring into view the small orifices of the ethmoidal cells, some of them opening directly into the meatus, and others into the infundibulum. A little below this last-named process, the fissure of the an- trum is also visible. This hole, so very large in the su- perior maxillary, if examined in its dry condition, is extremely circumscribed, so much so, as scarcely to admit the introduction of the blunt end of a probe, if viewed in connexion with the nose. This is owing to the manner in which its orifice is encroached on by the other bones contiguous to it. Thus the lachrymal over- laps it in front, the nasal plate of the palate behind, the OS planum of the ethmoid above, and the inferior spongy below. If we now proceed to the inferior meatus, we will find that the anterior palatine canal in front, the nasal duct in the middle, and the Eustachian tube be- hind, severally open into it. With respect to the first or anterior palatine canal, it cannot be said properly to open into the cavity of the inferior meatus, as the mu- cous membrane is reflected over it, and thus excludes it; but as it is apparent on the dry bone, we have con- sidered it proper to be mentioned. It is the canal throughTHE NOSE. 133 which the nerve of Cotunnius passes to reach the in- cisive fossa, to assist in forming the ganglion of Clo- quet. The nasal duct, the orifice of which is situated a little posterior to the extremity of the inferior spongy- bone, and three-quarters of an inch from the anterior nares, is the canal through which the tears are trans- mitted from the inner can thus of the eye to the nose, beino-, in fact, nothing more than the continuation downwards of the lachrymal sac. It is about three-quar- ters of an inch in length, curved, with the convexity turned forwards and inwards, its direction being at first downwards and forwards, and then backwards and out- wards. Three bones enter into its formation, the nasal process of the superior maxillary, the os unguis, and inferior turbinated bone, the canal which is left between them being capable of admitting a large probe. At the posterior extremity of the inferior spongy bone, and lying against the inner side of the internal pterygoid plate, the nasal extremity of the Eustachian tube is ob- served, but as this will be minutely examined in the description of the pharynx, we will defer its considera- tion till we are treating of that region. Anatomists have conferred the name of the Schnei- derian membrane on the mucoiis lining of the nose, from the individual who first properly described it. In front it is continuous with the skin, while behind there can be drawn no direct line of division between it and what is found in the pharynx; extremely thin and firmly ad- herent to the bony structures of the canals and sinuses which it lines, it becomes absolutely incorporated with the periosteum, and hence its name of fibro-mucous; but on the septum and spongy bones, particularly to- wards their posterior parts, its character is completely changed, becoming in those situations dense and thick. This increase of development is due to, in a great mea- sure, the numerous vascular plexuses, especially venous, which are found in this part, as well as to a multitude of glands which are here found in vast numbers. In its external characters likewise, the mucous membrane dif- fers in the several parts of the cavity in which we may examine it, in front exhibiting a scaly appearance very similar to that of the skin with which it is continuous,THE OSSEOUS SYSTEM. 134 ■whilst below and in the sinuses we find it changing to the columnar variety, and ciliated. This epithelium is exceedingly minute in the cells, while above and be- hind it is scarcely visible, not well defined, but folded over each other and presenting a darker hue from the pigment which is here very freely deposited. In the an- terior part likewise, we observe it studded with hairs, termed vibrisste—in the young, being fine and short, but increasing in length and thickness with advancing years. The mucous membrane exercises a peculiar in- fluence over the appearance of the several cavities of the nose, rounding olFits prominent edges, partially closing, and in some instances modifying, and in others oblite- rating, the several foramina and sinuses. In tracing it round its circumference we might commence at any point, for instance the septum, down which it is conti- nued as far as the floor, as it sweeps along which it covers in the anterior palatine hole; a little farther back it meets with the inferior orifice of the nasal duct, around the edges of which it forms a loose fold, from which it is continued upwards through the canal to the lachrymal sac, its ducts, and then through the puncta to become continuous with the conjunctiva. More poste- riorly it meets with the Eustachian tube and after forming another fold round its lips, it is prolonged within it as far as the tympanum, which it lines as well as the mastoid cells. Ascending now along the outer wall of the inferior meatus to its summit, it is again re- flected downwards-on the concave or outer surface of the inferior turbinated bone to its lower edge, where it forms a pendulous fold before it again ascends on its convex or inner surface. Arriving now at the middle meatus, it passes up through the infundibulum into the frontal sinuses, which it lines, sends prolongations into the anterior ethmoidal cells, and folds around the orifice of the foramen antri, which it afterwards enters to spread out on the walls of that cavity, where it is re- markable for its tenuity. Having lined the middle meatus on both walls, we again find it forming its fold on the free edge of the middle turbinated bone and then winds up on its convex surface into the superior meatus; here it is tensely stretched across the spheno-135 THE NOSE. palatine hole, passes into the posterior ethmoidal cells and sphenoidal sinus, converting the latter into a fun- nel-shaped chamber; then, after covering in the whole of the superior meatus, it descends to the inferior border of the superior spongy bone, where, forming a very small fold, it is inflected upwards to the roof of the nose, which it crosses inwards to the septum, or to that point from which we at first started. In order to complete the nasal cavity, it will be now necessary to take a view of its flexible portion, or that formed by the cartilages. These are five in number,—one median or septal, and two lateral,—the superior or nasal, and the inferior or alar. The septal cartilage is of an irregular quadrilateral figure, presenting four margins and two surfaces. The two last correspond to either nostril, covered with miicous membrane, which is here extremely thick and studded with hairs. The anterior margin stretches upwards and slightly backwards, and is received between the lateral cartilages and the slight groove of the nasal bones,—its posterior superior edge, directed backwards and downwards, unites with the nasal lamella of the ethmoid; its inferior posterior margin is received into a slit of the vomer, which is here fissured for its reception. Inferiorly it is attached to the sym- phisis of the two superior maxillary bones for a very short distance posteriorly; is free anteriorly, forming a broad and rounded columella, constituting the line of division between the nares of opposite sides. At the re- treating angle of junction above and behind, between the nasal lamella of the ethmoid and vomer, a caudate pro- longation is sent upwards and backwards between these bones, to be attached to the azygos process of the sphe- noid ; it resembles a narrow band, thin and irregular above, smooth and rounded below. The nasal cartilages, which are situated superiorly, are of a semilunar shape, thick anteriorly, where they are united to each other, forming the dorsum of the nose, leaving a triangular groove between them posteriorly for the reception of the septal cartilage,—united above to the nasal bones, and on either side to the sharp edge of the nasal notch of the superior maxillary,—below connected to the alar cartilages. The mode of union at all those points is byTHE OSSEOUS SYSTEM. 136 •white fibrous tissue, strong, but at the same time suffi- ciently lax to allow of a great amount of mobility. The alar or inferior cartilages are irregular in shape; they may be said to consist of a body and caudate process. The body is of an oval shape when viewed on its exter- nal surface, but on examining it more carefully it will be found that a thin plate curves backwards and in- wards, those of the opposite sides being in contact with each other inferiorly, with the intervention of some loose areolar tissue, and occasionally a cartilaginous nodule to facilitate motion, constituting the lobe of the nose, but above they are apart where the septum fits in between them, and is attached to them by fibrous membrane. Their upper edge is connected with the nasal cartilage, but only for a limited extent. Their inferior margin is deeply scolloped to increase the size of the nostril, Avhile their caudate extremity is prolonged around the margin of the orifice, to be attached to the nasal spine of the superior maxillary by strong ligamentous tissue. Around this is reflected the dense integument which constitutes the principal part of the ala of the nose. The vessels and nerves for the supply of the organ of smell are derived from different sources. Its arterial is received principally from the internal maxillary in its third stage, as it lies in the pterygo-maxillary fossa. These enter the nose through the spheno-palatine fora- mina, and break up into numerous branches, which form plexuses with the artery of the filtrum from the supe- rior coronary; the anterior and posterior ethmoidal, from the ophthalmic; twigs from the posterior palatine, and small perforating offsets from the lateral nasal of the facial. Their effete blood is again taken up by a se- ries of veins, which likewise anastomose freel}'-, and form plexuses much larger than the arterial, to be ultimately removed by two trunks,—a superior, which runs along the convex border of the nose; and an inferior, along the lower edge of the lateral cartilage; these unite on the outside of the ala, stretch obliquely upwards, an^ join the angular. The spheno-palatine likewise aids in its removal; it opens into the great alveolar plexus, which again terminates in the facial. The nerves which supply the nose are also numerous,THE NOSE. 137 jand derived from several sources. The principal of these ids the olfactory, standing pre-eminent above the others :'ifrom the function over which it presides,—the sense of fsmell. At present we have merely to direct our atten- ttion to its termination, without regarding its remarka- tble origin, or the other peculiarities which it exhibits lin its course from the brain to the cribriform plate of tthe ethmoid, where it expands into its bulb. From its iinferior surface it throws off about twenty or twenty- tfive filaments, which enter the cavity of the nose through tthe small foramina of the perforated plate, each invested iwith its proper sheath, borrowed from the dura mater. ] Dividing now into three sets,—an external, middle, and iinternal, they descend between the mucous membrane iand the bony structure, forming plexuses at first, but L afterAvards pursuing their course in separate filaments ttobe lost in the mucous lining, into which they can be t traced. The external set stretch down as far as the mid- i die spongy bone; the middle cover the roof; while the i internal extend nearly as far as a horizontal line drawn t through the centre of the septum. Some anatomists as- : sert that they anastomose freely with the spheno-pala- : tine and proper nasal, but we are not quite certain of this fact. The spheno-palatine nerve is a branch from Meck- ' el's ganglion, which enters the nose through the fora- men of the same name from the pterygo-maxillary fossa. It divides into numerous branches, which ra- : mify on the surfaces of the septum and spongy bones. One filament has been invested with great importance from the anatomist who first described it,—the nerve of Cotunnius, or naso-palatine; it passes downwards and forwards along the caudate appendage of the septal cartilage, generally overlapped by the edge of the vomer till it reaches the incisive fossa, where it unites with the posterior palatine to form Cloquet's ganglion. These branches, as we learn from pathology, all preside over common sensation. The proper nasal is a branch of the ophthalmic divi- sion of the fifth, which leaves the orbit through the an- terior ethmoidal hole, enters the cavity of the cranium, and crosses the cribriform plate of the ethmoid anteriorTHE OSSEOUS SYSTEM. to the Olfactory filaments; it now descends through a slit at the side of the crista galli and reaches the roof ot the nose where it divides into two branches,_a pos- terior, which passes downwards and backwards on the septum which it supplies, and anastomoses with the spheno-palatme; and an anterior, which grooves the nasa bones, and then passes out between these and the nasal cartilages to be distributed to the tip or lobe of tne nose. I his nerve connects in some measure the nose and orbit together, as irritation of it causes copious lachrymation. ^ The last cavities which we will have to describe are the orbits, those bony cases which contain the orcran of vision, with Its muscular and nervous provisions °They are two in number, placed immediately beneath the cranium and above the face; conical in shape, the base turned forwards and outwards, the apex backwards and inwards, so that two probes, if made to traverse the long axis of each, and carried backwards into the cra- nium, would decussate nearly at the sella turcica The rim or edge of the orbit is quadrilateral in figure, but the angles are rounded off, composed of three bones,— the frontal above, the malar externally and inferiorly, and the superior maxillary inferiorly and internally. It has four walls,—a superior or roof, an inferior or floor an external and internal; all of which terminate in a point, and meet posteriorly at the ridge of bone between the lacerated and optic hole. The superior wall or roof IS concave, and consists of two bones, the frontal and lesser wmg of the sphenoid; it looks downwards and forwards, and presents externally and anteriorly a deep depression for the reception of the lachrymal gland, and internally and anteriorly a small spicula of bone for the tendon of the superior oblique to be attached to. The inferior wall is flat and smooth; it looks upwards, for- wards, and outwards, and is formed by three bones,— the malar anteriorly, the superior maxillary in the middle, and the small process of the palate bone poste- riorly. At its junction internally with the malar bone It gives origin to the inferior oblique muscle, and near Its centre it is generally more or less fissured for the infra-orbital canal. The internal wall is slightly con-THE ORBITS. 139 cave; we find in it three bones,—the os unguis ante- : riorly, the os planum of the ethmoid in the centre, and the side of the body of the sphenoid posteriorly. In the • external wall are two bones only,—the malar in front, : and the great wing of the sphenoid behind. If we now ' contrast the length of the four walls, we will find that they present the following differences:—the superior is ■ the longest, the external the shortest, while the slight ' differences which exist between the internal and infe- rior preponderates in favour of the latter. The deep ' excavated groove in the rim of the external wall is very remarkable, evidently placed there by nature for the purpose of extending the range of vision in that di- rection, a similar arrangement not being required inter- nally, as the eye of the opposite side can fulfil the func- tions of its fellow. We will next proceed to the examination of the : several foramina which are found in the orbit; and first, with respect to the optic. This is a large hole, long transversely on its cranial aspect, and from above down- • wards on its orbital, directed downwards, forwards, ; and outwards, situated a little internal and superior to : its apex—in the side of the body of the sphenoid, trans- : mitting two very important parts into its cavity,—the I optic nerve and the ophthalmic artery. On a plane I external and inferior to this is the sphenoidal fissure, or : foramen lacerum orbitale, irregularly triangular in shape, with the base turned backwards, inwards, and down- ■ wards; the apex upwards, forwards, and outwards; it : is formed by the lesser wing of the sphenoid above, the : greater below, the body internally, and the junction of the two wings with the frontal, externally. The fol- : lowing parts pass through it in order from above down- ■ wards:—first, the fourth; second, the frontal; third, ■ the superior division of the third; fourth, the lachrymal; fifth, the nasal; sixth, inferior division of the third; se- venth, the sixth; eighth, the ophthalmic vein, with a few branches of the sympathetic; ninth, lachrymal branch I of middle meningeal externally; tenth, the dura mater, to form the periosteum of the orbit, and one head of the external rectus. The sphenoidal fissure separates ; partially the superior from the external wall of theTHE OSSEOUS SYSTEM. 140 orbit. In the inferior and external part of the cavity another remarkable fissure is observed, called the spheno-maxillary; it is hour-glass in shape, broad at either extremity, and contracted a little behind its centre; its direction is backwards and inwards, and it has the following boundaries:—externally the great wing of the sphenoid, internally the orbital plate of the superior maxillary and palate, and anteriorly the edge of the malar; it transmits small twigs from the internal maxillary artery for the supply of the inferior muscles, and the orbital twig of the superior maxillary nerve, to anastomose with the lachrymal on the outer wall of the orbit, in which two or three small foramina are visible for the transmission of the superficialis mal^ and temporo-malar; these are here given off from them after they unite. In the internal Avail, and to- wards its posterior part, two small round holes are visible, apart from each other about a quarter of an inch; they are called the anterior and posterior ethmoidal, because they are occasionally proper to that bone. They transmit, the anterior, a small artery, and the nasal twig of the ophthalmic, the posterior, a small artery only. In the front part of the internal wall, we likewise observe the opening of the nasal duct, which has already been fully examined in the description of the nose. The upper wall presents only a single hole, sometimes a notch, just at its verge, for the supra-orbi- tal artery and nerve, while the lower can scarcely be said to be similarly circumstanced, as the infra-orbital hole is the termination of a canal which, properly speak- ing, is without the cavity. Having now completed the outside of the skull, we must next proceed to take a slight review of its inte- rior. This may be done by making a horizontal section from a little above the superciliary arches, and carried back to the occipital protuberance, which will give us two portions for examination,—a superior, constituting the vault; and an inferior, comprising the cerebral fossae. The vault of the cranium is arched, both antero- posteriorly and laterally, formed on either side by the greater portions of the parietal bones, with a small part of the squamous plates of the temporal; behind by141 CRANIAL VAULT. .about one-third of the occipital, and in front by two- • thirds of the frontal. In the mesial line from before bbaclcwards it presents anteriorly the frontal ridge, vwhich as it proceeds backwards bifurcates, becomes c continuous more posteriorly with the parietal groove, aand still farther back with the occipital ridge. Along tthis line the remains of the sutures are visible, but not tto the same extent as on the outer surface of the sktill, meither are they denticulated. The openings of the eemissary holes of Santorini may be likewise observed luear the posterior superior angle of the parietal bone. .-Anteriorly are the frontal fossee; on each side the pa- rrietal; and behind the occipital, all corresponding to the eeminences on the outside, while the general surface is rmarked by irregular elevations and depressions, coin- cciding with the convolutions of the brain, and laterally vwith the shallow grooves for the lodgment of vessels in : their sinuous course between the bone and dura mater. ^"We may also remark the line of suture between the : frontal and parietal, between the latter and the tem- fporal, and likewise between the occipital and parietal. [Between the two last are wedged in the ossa Wormiana, :the sutures of which are much more apparent than any cof the others. The lower part of the cavity is more complex in its aarrangement. It comprises, as we have already stated, tthe cerebral fossas, which do not lie on the same plane, I but incline like the steps of a stairs from above, and in ifront downwards and backwards. They are three in mumber,—the anterior, middle, and posterior, and these v-we will examine each in the order in which we have : named them. The anterior fossa is of a semilunar shape, Abounded in front and on each side by the curve of the t frontal bone; behind by an undulating line, the con- vexity of which is turned forwards, formed by the pos- terior margin of the lesser wings and anterior lip of the .olivary groove. It may be divided into three distinct [portions,—a median or ethmoidal, and two lateral cor spheno-frontal. The ethmoidal is oblong, narrow 'from side to side, depressed; presenting anteriorly the ' foramen coecum or canal of communication between the tnose and great longitudinal sinus; behind it the crista142 THE 0S8E0DS SYSTEM. galli, on each side of which are the slits for the trans- mission of the nasal twig of the ophthalmic; more ex- ternally and posteriorly the double row of holes for the passage of the branches of the olfactory bulb; at its verge the orifice for the entrance of the nasal nerve from the anterior ethmoidal foramen; more posteriorly the line of suture between the ethmoid and sphenoid, with a slight elevation in the centre corresponding to the spine of the latter, with a depression at each side, on which the olfactory nerves recline. The lateral por- tions, consisting of the frontal and lesser wing of the sphenoid, present a most irregular appearance, the mam- millary eminences and digital depressions being nume- * rous and well marked; and this is the more striking from the same part of the bones on their inferior aspect, where they form the roof of the orbit, being remark- able for their smoothness and regularity. The anterior fossa just described supports the anterior lobe of the cerebrum. The middle fossa of the cranium lies on a plane, posterior and inferior to the last described,— bounded in front by the lesser wings of the sphenoid and anterior lip of the olivary process; behind by the upper margins of the petrous portions of the temporal bones, and posterior clinoid processes; externally by parts ^f" the great wing of the sphenoid-parietal and squamous plate of temporal. Its floor is formed by the body and great wing of the sphenoid and petrous portion of the temporal, and is very concave. Like the preceding, it may be divided into a central or sphenoidal, and two lateral regions. The central portion presents anteriorly the groove of the olivary process, terminating on either side in the optic foramina for the passage of the optic nerve and artery, behind which are the two anterior clinoid processes; still more posteriorly, the sella tur- cica for the reception of the pituitary gland and cir- cular sinus; this deep recess being bounded behind by the prominence of the posterior clinoid processes. The lateral regions are perforated anteriorly by the sphe- noidal fissure for the transmission of the nerves into the orbit; behind this is a slight depression corresponding to the cavernous sinus; more posteriorly, the opening of the anterior lacerated foramen; external, and a little143 CKANIAL VAULT. vjinterior to this, the foramen rotundum for the passage . of the superior maxillary nerve; more posteriorly, the llforamen ovale for the exit of the inferior maxillary and 'entrance of the small meningeal artery; still farther boack, the spinous hole for the artery of the same name; irmore posteriorly, the hiatus Fallopii for the entrance of t!;he Vidian nerve, external and anterior to which is the SBmall fissure for the exit of the nervus petrosus super- fiicialis minor. The middle fossa of the cranium sup- poorts the middle lobes of the cerebrum. The posterior fossa is situated on a still lower plane thhan the other two, and is equal to them both in capa- ci;ity. It is deeply concave, bounded in front by the iiuperior edges of the petrous portions of the temporal boones and posterior clinoid processes, laterally and be- hiind by the posterior inferior angles of the parietal boones, and the transverse ridges on the occipital. The idoor is formed by the occipital, part of the sphenoid and mastoid portion of the temporal. It likewise pre- ^oents a median and two lateral regions. The central reegion is occasionally marked towards its anterior part boy the line of suture between the occipital and sphe- Qdoid bones; it is grooved, and supports the pons varolii, boasilar artery, and sixth pair of nerves; more poste- riorly is the foramen magnum for the passage of the medulla oblongata, with the nerves and vessels accom- paanying it, on each side of which are the anterior and poosterior condyloid foramina, the one for the exit of Ithe lingual nerve; the other has a small vein passing ;lihrough it. The lateral regions comprehend the deep wcipital fossas for the reception of the lobes of the ce- : ebellum. They are separated from each other by a ^ veil-marked vertical ridge, to which the falx cerebelli >3 attached; anteriorly they are grooved deeply for the aateral sinuses, which terminate into a large ovoid fora- men, the posterior lacerated for the transmission of the nnternal jugular vein and eighth pair of nerves; more uuperiorly is the internal auditory meatus, into which nnters the seventh pair of nerves and the small auri- iTilar artery; behind which is the aqueduct of the ves- ibule, from which a small vein emerges.144 SECTION II. SYNDESMOLOGY, OR THE ANATOMY OF THE JOINTS. Ajoint or ARTICULATION inthehumaBskeletonisformed by two or more solid tissues (generally bones) united by ligaments either fixed or moveable on each other. It is complete when bone, cartilage, ligaments, and synovial membrane enter into its conformation; and incomplete when any one of these is absent. We will now proceed to examine the several structures enumerated indivi- dually. The articular extremities of bones are expanded laterally in hinge-joints, and circumferentially in the enarthrodial class for the purpose of increasing the sur- face of apposition; but this augmentation would neces- sarily produce an excess of weight inconsistent with ra- pidity of motion, if the extremity exhibited a density and compact nature similar to the shaft. But to ob- viate this inconvenience, the volume of the articular ex- tremity is composed principally of a light spongy tissue; an arrangement that would seem to incur a certain sus- ceptibility to fracture, which is prevented, first, by the shock being equally dififused over an extensive surface; and, secondly, by a thin layer of an elastic tissue (carti- lage) being interposed between the opposed surfaces. Cartilage, in connexion with joints, is observed to present two varieties: the articular, or cartilage of in- crustation, which covers and adheres to the articular extremities; and interarticular, which is placed in such situations that it tends to adapt varying convexities and concavities, as well as to diminish the intensity of those shocks to which the extremities are constantly liable. These cartilages differ from each other in struc- ture, the articular being termed true; the interarticu- lar, false or fibro-cartilage; the former consists of an hyaline or structureless basis, containing numerous cellsLIGAMENTS. 145 ■ with indistinct walls and compound nuclei, with oily i particles,—these cells having a linear arrangement, ver- I tical to the surface in the articular cartilages; but in ; the laryngeal, tracheal, costal, nasal, and auricular car- tilages the cells are without any definite arrangement, I although all belonging to the same system. The false or : fibrous cartilages are composed of wavy bands of fibrous 1 tissue, containing in their areolae but few cells, and these I devoid of that bold outline that characterizes the true. ' The fibro-cartilages are principally interarticular, but Ithis tissue also lines those osseous grooves, through or (over which tendons play (stratiform cartilage). True (cartilage yields an animal matter, when subjected to llong boiling, chondrine—nearly allied to gelatine, but iit differs from the latter in not being precipitated from 3a solution by tannic acid, and in being thrown down tby acetic acid, acetate of lead, and protosulphate of iron. :The cartilage of bone before ossification (true) yields . chondrine only, but at the completion of that process, ^gelatme is the product obtained. Fibro-cartilage yields ^gelatine without a trace of chondrine. Articular car- ttilage is thicker on the centre of a convexity; but the .-opposite rule holds in reference to concavities. Its con- mexion to the bone is not exactly determined; four rmeans of conjunction have been enumerated: firstly, by imutually irregular but indigitating surfaces; secondly, thy vascular loops; thirdly, by a continuation of the sy- nnovial membrane over its surface; and, fourthly, by a pprolongation of the periosteum between it and the bone. IThe vessels terminate at the margins in loops, dilatecl ifrequently into ampullffi,_not, at least in the adult, ireaching the deep surface of the cartilage,—a thin layer ODt dense but porous bone intervening. In fcetal life ca- unals exist, by which the blood plasma permeates the ttissue fonts nutrition; a vascular plexus also occurs nt that period on the synovial surface, which disappears S(30on after birth. The fibrous cartilages are supplied by H circumferential vascular circle, from which loops are continued into the structure, but always terminating boefore they reach the centre or that point most liable tec pressure. Ligaments—These belong to the class of fibrous tis- HTHE ANATOMY OF THE JOINTS. 146 sues, in many, indeed the majority, of situations these structures are devoid of elasticity; but in some that physical property is the predominant character: white fibrous tissue constituting the former; yellow elastic, the latter. The white or non-elastic is found in the hu- man body expanded to control and preserve the position of the muscles (fascisfi) surrounding bones (as the perios- teum, dura mater, giving insertion to muscles, as ten- dons and aponeuroses), confining and protecting organs (pericardium, sclerotic, and tunica albuginea), uniting bones as ligaments. The white fibrous tissue consists of wavy bands, that may pass parallel or interlace, present- ing faint longitudinal strise, more indicative of simple creasing than divisibility. Under the action of acetic acid it becomes transparent, and yields gelatine on boil- ing; its vascular siipply is limited, and nervous orga- nization probably absent. It is opaque, dense, resisting, inelastic, slow to take on inflammation; but on the su- pervention of that process, if acute, it rapidly sloughs; subject to chronic inflammatory action, it becomes vas- cular, and thickened by interstitial deposit, as in false nodes and diseases of the joints, producing false anchy- losis. Yellow elastic tissue is composed of fibres smaller than the last, branched and uniting with neighbouring filaments, with a disposition to become curled when rup- tured. Acetic acid does not produce transparency, but discloses the existence of nuclei. This tissue occurs in the ligamenta subflava, thyro-hyoid, crico-thyroid, sty- lo-hyoid, and calcaneo-scaphoid ligaments; also in the middle coat of the arterial tubes. A second form of elas- tic tissue also is found in those situations where a cer- tain degree of contractility exists, as in the skin, nipple, dartos, crus penis, and smaller blood-vessels. It is cha- racterized by the presence of nuclei at regular intervals, and is the principal constituent of the vascular coats m the erectile tissues (Hassall). Ligaments are divided into three forms: funicular, capsular, and the fascicu- lated, or membranous. The first occur in connexion with ginglymoid joints; the second in the ball and socket; and the third are common to both. Synovial membranes form a sub-class of serous tis-147 CLASSIFICATIONS OF JOINTS. > sues. They are thin, semi-transparent, and constitute s shut sacs. The external surface is rough, cellular, and ^attached; the internal smooth, free, and lubricated by aa glairy fluid, termed synovia. Structurally it consists cof a superficial covering of squamous epithelium, be- rneath this a basement membrane, and most externally aareolar tissue. In foetal life the epithelium can be traced cover the surface of the cartilage, but not in the adult, lln many joints there occur fringed processes and fatty tbodies, described by Clopton Havers as special glands; Ibut the synovial fluid is equally secreted by the entire ffree surface. The Classifications of joints are numerous, the first ddepending on the mode of union, as syndesmosis or ssyneurosis, where they are united by ligament; syn- cehondrosis, where cartilage is the bond of union; me- ijiingosis, by membrane, as in the foetal cranial bones; aand sysarcosis, by muscle, as between the scapula and rribs. The second classification depends on motions en- jgoyed by the bones. Being in a great measure physiolo- --gical, we will only briefly state the divisions of Bichat. Uhe motions are four, namely, gliding, as between astra- ggalus and calcis; opposite motions in the ginglymoid cslass, as elbow; and circumduction, as in shoulder; ro- Ttation, in hip-joint. He next subdivided them 'into jioints with every motion perfect; secondly, into those with all motions save rotation, as the metacarpo-phalan- g;eal articulation of the thumb; thirdly, joints only ceapable of the motion of opposition ; fourthly, joints lonly admittmg a rotatory movement; and lastly, joints uwhich ghde on each other without any other motion. The division now in use in this country is that of I'jalen, with some variation, however. He divided joints iLuto two classes, moveable or diarthroses; immoveable DDr synarthroses, to which Winslow added the third imixed class, or amphiarthrosis. ^ Diarthrosis is subdivided into ginglymus, enarthro- ;iis, arthrosis, and planiform arthrosis. Ginglymus is ?i!ither perfect, as in the humero-cubital and interpha- aangeal articulations, or imperfect, as the knee-joint, in which some lateral motion exists. Lateral ginglymus, !»r trochoides, occurs where bones are opposed by their H 2THE ANATOMY OF THE JOINTS. 148 sides, as the radius and ulna (double), the odontoid process with the atlas (single). The oblique processes of the lumbar vertebrae may be said to form similar ar- ticulations or hinges. Enarthrosis is where a large convexity and concavity are united, forming a ball and socket, as in the ilio-fe- moral artictilation. Arthrosis, where there is a shallow concavity and a slight convexity, or where a disparity occurs between the surfaces, as in the shoulder, costo-transverse, and a single carpal and tarsal articulation. To the same class may be appended the raetacarpo-carpal joint of the thumb. Planiform Arthrosis is where plane surfaces are op- posed, as in the junction of the metacarpal and metatar- sal bones with the carpal and tarsal. Amphiarthrosis is divided into symphisis and synchondrosis, or union by cartilage, as in the ilio-sacral symphisis and the junction of the ribs with their cartilages; also the union of the vertebral bodies. Synarthrosis, or the immoveable class, is divided into the following:—Suture, harmonia, gomphosis, and schyndylesis. Sutures are serrated, as the saggital: den- ticulated or dove-tailed, as in the lambdoidal; and squa- mous, as between the squamous plate of the temporal and the parietal. The palate plates of the superior maxil- lary bones are examples of harmonia. Schyndylesis occurs between the rostrum of the sphenoid, nasal la- mella of the ethmoid and the vomer. The connexion of the teeth with the maxillae affords instances of gom- phosis. In the enumeration of the illustrations of each form of articulation a few only have been mentioned, the remainder being deferred, until the further conside- ration of the individual joints. LIGAMENTS OF THE SPINE. The structures which unite the spinal column may be divided into those which bind together the bodies, consisting of the intervertebral substance, and an an- terior and posterior common, or vaginal ligament, and those which connect the processes, comprising the in- terspinous and supraspinous, the intertransverse, im-149 LIGAMENTS OF THE SPINE. : perfect capsular, and ligamenta subflava. These we now I propose to examine in order. When describing the vertebas we stated, that their I bodies did not lie in contact with each other, but were s separated by a greater or lesser interval, according to tthe region which they contributed to form, being most aapart in the lumbar, and least in the cervical. The ex- cception to this rule is the articulation of the atlas and aaxis where they lie in direct contact with each other. IThe interval alluded to is filled up by a substance de- sscribed by some anatomists as fibro-cartilaginous, but bby others said to be fibrous; it is called the inter- vertebral disc; in shape oval, but slightly flattened pos- tteriorly, its lateral measurement exceeding somewhat iits antero-posterior; its surfaces, both superior and in- tiferior, convex, to correspond to the partial cavities ex- idsting on the upper and under part of the bodies of the bbone, to which they are united by fibrous prolongations :implanted into the osseous structure, and this with such a a, degree of tenacity, that we can with greater facility ifracture the body of the bone than rupture its attach- rment to the disc. If we call in the aid of maceration in oDrder to examine its more intimate structure, we will fifind that the arrangement of its fibres is not truly con- ccentric, but decussating, crossing from the vertebra aibove to the vertebra below, at a very oblique angle, tithus presenting a strong barrier to over-rotation. The C3ircumferential portion of the disc is dense and compact, aand has attached to it before and behind the anterior iand posterior common ligaments; but as we advance to upoint situated a little posterior to its centre, we observe II 1 gradual change taking place in its appearance. The ^lbres insensibly become more apart, until they are at laast completely lost in a pulpy substance, white, and esxtremely elastic in youth, but yellow and brittle in old uge. _ If a knife be passed in through the middle of the liisc in front, so as to pierce its anterior two-thirds, and tbhen withdrawn, this soft, pulpy matter will exude :hhrough the fissure by pressing the bodies of the adja- :t;ent bones together. The intervertebral disc must be regarded not only as u powerful medium of connexion, but also as of vastTHE ANATOMY OF THE JOINTS. 150 importance in breaking shocks transmitted to the ver- tebral column. It is likewise of use in bestowing faci- lity of motion, and in imparting elasticity and supple- Bess to this fundamental portion of the human body. The best method, and indeed the only true one, of examining the peculiarities which the disc presents in the several regions of the spine, is to make a vertical section in the antero-posterior direction, from the se- cond vertebra to the second bone of the sacrum. On directing our attention to the cut surfaces, we will ob- serve a greater thickness in the lumbar region, its wedge-like form, with the base turned anteriorly, espe- cially conspicuous between the last vertebra and first bone of the sacrum, where its posterior thin margin is fined o& to a striking degree of tenuity. In the dorsal region, on the contrary, there is a sensible decrease in the vertical height of this substance, while the base of the wedge is directed backwards; in the cervical again the gradual diminution in depth still continues, but it follows the arrangement observable in the lumbar, in being deeper before than behind. Thus the alternating changes in the position of these wedge-like discs are in a great measure the cause of the normal curvatures which are observed in the spine, the abnormal ones likewise depending in a great measure upon their irregu- lar development. The Anterior Vaginal, or Common Ligament, is si- tuated on the front of the vertebral column, extending from the body of the second cervical vertebra to the upper part of the first bone of the sacrum; it is of a pearly- white colour, and consists of three distinct bands,—a median, and two lateral, separated by imperfect inter- vals, through which the vessels pass in their course to the bone. Maceration proves that it forms two, some- times three, planes of fibres, the deeper set attached to the lips of two contiguous vertebrae, and an intervening intervertebral disc, while the more superficial extends over three, four, or five; their connexion to the bodies of the bone is very slight, so much so that the handle of the scalpel can be sometimes passed between them and the ligament, but it is far otherwise with respect to its attachment to the margins of the bone and theLIGAMENTS OP THE SPINE. 151 disc, which is most intimate in its character. In the lumbar region it is broadest, in the dorsal densest, and in the cervical much the weakest; but in the last it is strengthened by the aponeurotic expansions of the longi colli, which in a great measure conceals it from view; it has no adventitious support in the dorsal, but lies bare, forming the floor for the support of the parts contained in the posterior mediastinum, whilst in the lumbar it is overlapped and supported by the tendinous origins of the crura of the diaphragm and psose muscles. The Posterior Common, or Vaginal Ligament, is situated within the spinal canal, and can, therefore, only be examined by separating the processes from the bodies of the bone through its entire extent; thus exposed, it presents a great similarity to the anterior, but in structure it is much more dense and compact; like it, it stretches from the second cervical vertebra, where it ap- pears to be a continuation of the apparatus ligamentosus colli, presently to be described, to the first bone of the sacrum; its margins are peculiar, from the scolloped appearance which they present, depending on the man- ner in which processes are prolonged on the interverte- bral substance, even through the foramina of conjuga- tion, to be continuous with the anterior vaginal in front; its connexion to the back part of the bone is very slight, being confined to the upper and lower lip only, as the transverse venous sinuses, receiving the blood from the diploe, pass between and separate them, but it is com- pletely incorporated with the posterior edge of the disc; in the dorsal region it is extremely narrow, in the lum- bar more expanded; its posterior surface is divided from the dura mater by fine areolar tissue, which is usually of a reddish colour and watery character. Both the anterior and posterior common ligaments are highly inelastic, and flexion and extension of the spine depends upon displacement, or rather thinning of the intervertebral disc, according as undue pressure is brought to bear on it. Supraspinous Ligaments These are visible only in the dorsal and lumbar regions, but not in the cer- vical, where the ligamentum nuchaj takes their place. This latter is a strong fibrous band, attached above toTHE ANATOMY OP THE JOINTS. 152 the occipital protuberance, and below to the prominent spine of the seventh cervical vertebra; as it passes down- wards it sends oflf thin prolongations, which are con- nected to the intervening spines, forming a species of septum between the muscles of opposite sides; from the point where this terminates the supraspinous pro- perly commences, stretching as a rounded cord from the summit of one spine to that of the next, but on reaching the lumbar region its character becomes altered, as it is here flattened out, and much stronger; they afford origin to the erectors of the spine, and are a powerful bond of union between the adjacent bones. Interspinous. — These ligaments are also deficient in the cervical region, their place being supplied by muscles; in the dorsal they are thin and diaphanous, triangular in shape, and extremely weak, but in the lumbar, where they are quadrilateral; they are very thick and strong; they extend, as their name implies, from the under part of one spine to the upper of the adjoining; and they require a very troublesome dissec- tion to expose them. Intertransverse.—This name has been applied to a few scattered fibres which extend between the adjacent transverse processes; they are very irregular in their arrangement, and sometimes do not exist at all, at least we have looked in vain for them in repeated instances; they contribute very slightly to the strength of the spi- nal column. Capsular.—These are found encircling the conti- guous articulating processes of adjoining vertebrae; they have been most unjustly described as being weak and imperfect, but such is not the case, as they are exceed- ingly strong, completely surrounding the joint, the synovial membrane of which they protect, while they confer no small degree of security on the articulation; the removal of the dense mass of muscles which over- lap them is, however, an operation tedious, and attended with much trouble. LiGAMENTA SuBFLAVA—Theso have been so named from their bright yellow colour, which is very beauti- fully seen in the fresh preparation; as it is always better to observe them from their internal surface, theLIGAMENTS OF THE SPINE. 153 pposterior portion of the section which has been already nmade to expose the posterior common ligament of the f spine ■vvill enable us to obtain an excellent view of them; tthey consist of thick masses of ligamentous tissue, 5 stretching between the corresponding laminas, consist- iing of fibres closely packed together, converging and raneeting at an angle posteriorly, so as completely to fill mp the intervals left between the adjoining vertebra; ttheir attachment, however, to the laminse is peculiar, t'for while they spring from the upper edge of the one tbelow, they are prolonged anteriorly on the bevilled ssurface of the one above, thus increasing their length, aand conferring a high degree of smoothness and regula- rrity on the internal part of the spinal canal. They vwill be found, however, to vary in strength in the sseveral regions of the spine, being exceedingly strong iin the lumbar and dorsal, btit weak and much deeper ifrom above downwards, in the cervical. Their elasti- ocity is very remarkable, and as an adjuvant to themus- ccles of extension they must be of the greatest import- iance. The form of Articulation of the spine is amphiar- tthrosis, with one single exception existing between the ooblique processes, which is arthrodia; it possesses all the Emotions,—rotation, circumduction, flexion, extension, aand lateral inclination. The first of these, or rotation, fscarcely deserves this name, as it is rather a movement of ttorsion of the intervertebral disc; it is extremely limited tbetween any two contiguous vertebrae, but when dilFused aamongst several it can be carried to a considerable ex- ttent. Circumduction is, however, much more exten- ' sive; in this motion the apex of the cone is at the upper [part of the sacrum, and the base formed by the superior Lparts of the body. The amount of flexion is apparently vvery great, but if we except the cervical region, it is rreally very limited, for the curvature which is generally aascribed to the spinal region truly depends upon the hbending forwards of the body at the coxo-femoral arti- cculation. Extension is likewise circumscribed by the pprotrusion backwards of the spinous process, and the ppeculiar manner in which they overlap each other in tthe dorsal vertebrae precludes it altogether in this154 THE ANATOMY OF THE JOINTS. region. In the cervical and lumbar, particularly in the former, it is much better marked. Lateral motion partakes in a great measure of the character of the last, and is least limited in the same regions. It may be here necessary to repeat what we have before stated generally,—that flexion, extension, and lateral motion depend not on the absolute stretching of the connect- ing tissues, but on the degree of displacement of the soft portions of the intervertebral disc. To whatever side the body is inclined, there it is thinned, while it becomes thickened in the opposite direction in a ratio with the degree of pressure it sustains from the conti- guous vertebr$e. ATLO-AXOID ARTICULATION. The union between the first and second vertebrse takes place at three distinct points, viz.: between the oblique processes at either side, and the odontoid of the one with the body of the other in the centre. For the security of this joint it is provided with an anterior and posterior ligament, a capsular on each side, and a transverse. Anterior Ligament.—This consists of a lamina of fibres, particularly dense in the mesial line, stretching from the tubercle of the atlas, and the anterior surfaces of its contiguous half-arches, to the front of the body of the axis, where it becomes blended with the anterior common ligament; it is exceedingly strong, and partially covered by the tendinous insertions of the longus colli. Posterior Ligament.—This is much weaker and looser than the last, extending between the posterior half-arches of the atlas and upper edges of the lamina? of the axis; it seems to be typical of the ligamenta sub-flava in the other regions. The inferior oblique muscle must be re- moved in order to expose it. Capsular Ligaments—These are compact, and pos- sessed of great strength, particularly anteriorly and ex- ternally, but at the same time sufficiently lax to admit of the great amount of motion that exists between those two bones; they are attached to the edges of the cor- responding oblique process, and are lined by a synovial sac, which is remarkable for its great extent.LIGAMENTS OF THE SPINE. 155 Transverse Ligament.—This is strong and dense, f stretching across the spinal foramen in the atlas, to be ; attached by its extremities to two small tubercles, which i are situated on the inner side of its lateral masses; it is : grooved anteriorly where it lies in contact with and em- i braces the odontoid process of the axis, flattened poste- 1 riorly, where it is covered by the apparatus ligamentosus icoUi; from its inferior margin a strong fibrous process (descends, which is inserted sometimes into the back j part of the body of the axis, and sometimes into that (of the third cervical vertebra; from its upper another I ascends, but much weaker, which is implanted into the I edge of the foramen magnum. The circular canal ; formed by the bone in front and the ligament behind i is lined by a loose synovial sac, which appears to be 1 much too large for it; the superior border of the liga- I ment likewise forms a larger segment of a circle than I the inferior—an arrangement which, from theconstric- 1 tion of the odontoid process at its junction with the 1 body of the bone, has a tendency to keep the parts more i inseparably united. This articulation is compound,—arthrodial between • the oblique processes, and lateral ginglymus between the odontoid and body of the atlas. Its principal, and indeed only, motion is rotation, and this is by no means as extensive as we would on a cursory view be led to suppose, as in turning the face to either side the whole of the vertebral column assists in the motion, more par- ticularly the cervical region. OCCIPITO-AXOID ARTICULATION. There is no direct union between the occipital bone and axis, as the atlas intervenes and separates them; it is, therefore, merely syndesmoid. The means of con- nexion are three powerful ligaments,—the apparatus ligamentosus colli, and the check, or moderator, or odontoid. Apparatus Ligamentosus Colli—To expose this it will be necessary to have a skull with the calvarium and brain removed; an incision must now be made with156 THE ANATOMY OF THE JOINTS. a saw vertically downwards, so as to divide the foramen ovale laterally, about its centre; this should be con- tinued downwards to about the fourth cervical vertebra, and by cutting across the spinal column at this point we will have the internal part of the canal and the edge of the foramen magnum exposed; by now dissecting off the dura mater, the ligament will be brought into view; it is exceedingly strong, and may be said to consist of three distinct parts,—a median and two lateral; of these the median is dense, taking its origin from the edge of the foramen magnum, and, passing downwards nearly vertically, crosses the transverse ligament, into which a great part of its deep fibres are inserted, while the more superficial continue their course, to be implanted into the back part of the axis, where they become blended with the posterior common ligament of the epine. The lateral arise more externally from the margin of the occipital hole, where they are extremely broad; they descend, inclining slightly inwards, gra- dually becoming narrower, to be attached to the back part of the axis, where they join the middle fasciculus; the relations of this ligament are behind the dura ma- ter, and in front the odontoid process, transverse, and check ligaments. Check or Moderator Ligaments.—These are ex- posed by dissecting off the last described; they are two rounded ligamentous cords, about three-quarters of an inch in length, arising from a slight furrow on the up- per part of the odontoid process, and passmg nearly transversely outwards, to be inserted into a small de- pression on the inside of the condyloid process. Those ligaments are strong, and their use is to limit over- rotation of the atlas, and, of course, the head which is attached to it on the axis; this can be clearly shown on the dissected preparation, where we are enabled to turn the head to a certain extent, and no further, the liga- ments in this condition being found twisted around the odontoid process, the insertion of one of them being directed partially backwards, of the other partially for- wards. With respect to their relative anatomy we will find the anterior occipito-atlantoid ligament Hes m frontLIGAMENTS OF THE SPINE. 157 of them, the apparatus ligamentosus colli behind them, except at their insertion, where they are covered by dura mater. OCCIPITO-ATLANTOID ARTICULATION. In this joint the occipital bone and the atlas are in contact at two distinct points, and it possesses but one motion, which is that of opposition, for this reason it is termed condyle-arthrosis; it is a most important articu- lation, requiring great strength, and accordingly we find that it has numerous ligaments for its security; these consist of an anterior, which is double, a posterior, two lateral, and two capsular, with a very loose syno- vial membrane. Anterior Occipito-Atlantoid Ligament.—To ex- pose this the pharynx must be removed in the usual manner, but in doing so we must be careful to make the section accurately between the cephalo-pharyngeal aponeurosis and the recti muscles, so as to leave the latter attached to the basilar process; these may be now detached from the bone, and reflected downwards, the fat and areolar tissue removed, when the ligament will be brought into view, consisting, as has been already observed, of two distinct portions, an anterior and a posterior; the first of these is always well-marked, is rounded atid cord-like in its appearance, attached above tothebasilarprocess, from which it stretches downwards, to be inserted into the tubercle, on the front of the atlas; posteriorly it rests upon the flattened portion, with which it is intimately blended anteriorly; it is covered by the recti majores, while on each side it has the two lesser recti, as they converge to their insertion; the posterior portion is weaker than the last, but much broader, particularly below; it arises from the anterior lip of the foramen magnum, extending out on each side nearly as far as the condyles, and descends nearly ver- tically to be inserted into the upper edge of the ante- rior half-arch of the atlas; posteriorly it rests on the point of the odontoid process and check ligaments, which separate it from the apparatus ligamentosus colli, while anteriorly it is covered by the greater and lesser recti, and its own rounded portion.158 THE ANATOMY OF THE JOINTS Posterior Occipito-atloid Ligament. — This is brought into view by removing all the muscles from the back part of the neck till we reach the oblique and recti; by now separating these from the occipital bone, and re- moving thefat,we will observe the ligament, much weaker in its character than the preceding, but more extensive; it takes its origin from the posterior edge of the foramen magnum, as far forwards as the condyle, and is inserted into the upper surface of the posterior half-arch of the atlas; it is perforated by two foramina, one large, for the vertebral artery, the other small, for the suboccipital nerve, and it corresponds by its anterior surface to the dura mater of the cord, and by its posterior to the supe- rior oblique and recti muscles, and vertebral artery, which rests on it for a short distance. Lateral Occipito-Atlantoid Ligament—These are exposed by removing all the soft parts immediately over the transverse process of the atlas, and then detaching the rectus capitis lateralis from the occipital bone, and reflecting it outwards, when the ligament, never well- marked, consisting only of a few scattered fibres, and extremely short, will be brought into view, arising from the jugular ridge, and inserted into the root of the transverse process of the atlas; externally it is covered by the rectus lateralis; internally it corresponds to the articulation between the atlas and occipital bone; anteriorly it assists in completing the fibrous canal, which contains the internal carotid and jugular vein, and the eighth, ninth, and sympathetic nerves. Capsular Ligaments.—These consist of a series of fibres, the majority passing nearly vertically down- wards, but interlaced by others, running in an oblique direction from the edge of the condyle above to the at- lantoid articulating depression below; externally and anteriorly they are exceedingly strong; but internally and posteriorly they are very weak and indistinct, afford- ing rather a protection to the synovial membrane than any security to the joint itself. We have already alluded to the extreme size and laxity of the synovial membrane, which is reflected downwards in loose folds, on the edges of the articulation.COSTAL LIGAMENTS. 159 COSTO-SPINAL ARTICULATIONS. The articulation between the ribs and spinal column is a double arthrodia,—the former uniting by its head with the bodies and intervertebral substance, and by its tubercle with the extremity of the transverse process of the vertebra below; for this reason they have been called costo-vertebral and costo-transverse. The liga- ments which tend to secure each of those articulations are three in number: those of the first being an ante- rior or stellate, a middle or intervertebral, and a poste- rior or imperfect capsular; those of the second are an anterior, middle, and posterior. Stellate, or Anterior Costo-vertebral. — This may be exposed with great facility in a subject from the thorax of which the soft parts have been removed, by dissecting off the costal pleura,—the fibrous mem- brane which lies beneath it,—and turning on one side the dorsal ganglia of the sympathetic. The dissection will be greatly facilitated by sawing across all the ribs anterior to their angles. The stellate ligament, which is now brought into view, is of a triangular shape, nar- row externally, but broad internally, it arises by a thick, narrow process from the anterior surface of the head and neck of the rib, passes inwards, and divides into three distinct parts, the superior being inserted into the vertebra above, the inferior into that below, and the middle into the intervertebral substance. It differs in the mode of its insertion in the first, eleventh, and twelfth, being attached to a single vertebra in each of those instances, although it still consists of three slips. This ligament is exceedingly strong, and rests on the contiguous bones and cavity of the joint, and is covered by some loose fibrous tissue, the dorsal ganglia of the sympathetic and pleura. Capsular Ligament—In order to examine this, it will be necessary to detach from the back all the large muscles which cover it; a cautious dissection must now be made, when the ligament will be perceived, consist- ing of a few scattered fibres stretching from one bone to the other. Although rather apparent posteriorly, it160 THE ANATOMY OF THE JOINTS. is very weak and indistinct anteriorly, where it is scarcely required, the strong stellate taking its place. Intervertebral Ligament.—In order to expose this, the stellate ligament must be divided as well as the capsular; the attachment of the tubercle of the rib to the transverse process must likewise be cut through, and then, by pulling it slightly apart from the spine, the intervertebral ligament may be observed arising from the ridge or crest between the two articular fa- cettes on the head, and stretching directly inwards, to be inserted into the side of the intervertebral disc. In its character it is comparatively weak; flattened from above downwards, so as to form a septum or partition between the two synovial membranes which line the superior and inferior articulations. Anterior Costo-transverse Ligament. — This is extremely strong, but flattened, and is fully exposed in the dissection already made. It arises from the under surface of the extremity of the transverse process of the vertebra above, and stretches downwards and in- wards, to be inserted into a slight crest or ridge on the upper edge of the neck of the rib below, which it thus directly supports. It appears to be a thickened portion of the fibrous membrane which covers the external in- tercostal muscles, and corresponds anteriorly to the anterior intercostal vessels and nerves, and a quantity of loose areolar tissue; posteriorly, to the longissimus dorsi; internally, to the posterior dorsal vessels and nerves, which pass through a quadrilateral opening in- tercepted between it and the bodies, and transverse pro- cesses of the adjacent vertebra; and externally, to the levator costse. Posterior Costo-transverse.—This is a strong band of fibres, stretching between the extremity of the trans- verse process and non-articular portion of the tubercle of the rib. It is covered in by the insertion of the erectors of the spine and levatores costarum. Middle Costo-transverse—This is truly an inter- osseous ligament, and possesses some degree of strength. It is very difficult to obtain a good view of it; a partial one may, however, be accomplished by dividing all the other ligaments and forcibly tearing one bone from theCOSTAL LIGAMENTS. 161 !)ther, when we may observe its fibres stretching irre- -i-ularly from one facette to the other; it is likewise iDrovided with a synovial membrane. The articulations just described are remarkable for tbheir strength, admitting of very slight motion, strictly sppeaking, but when propagated along the curved lever ivvhich the rib represents, it becomes amply sufficient fcbr the proper distention of the thorax. In its act of B2xpansion, the tubercle glides to a certain extent on tbhe transverse process, communicating a species ^ of se- imirotatory movement to its head, which plays in the wocket formed by the contiguous vertebrce and inter- Tfening intervertebral substance. CHONDRO-COSTAL AND CHONDRO-STERNAL ARTI- CULATIONS. The union between the ribs and their cartilages is vvery peculiar: the extremities of the former are exca- vvated, and into these the cartilages are implanted, while tithe, periosteum is continued uninterrupted from the .one to the other. The connexion between them is very iintimate, although there are no ligaments for their secu- rrity. The cartilages are in the same manner imbedded iin grooves in the sides of the sternum, according to ssome authorities having a synovial membrane inter- pposed, but this we have hitherto been unable satisfac- ttorily to demonstrate: They have for their security a ssuperior and inferior, an anterior and posterior liga- nment. The Superior and Inferior Ligaments scarcely deserve • the name as such, being merely processes of fibrous tis- -sue extending from the sides of the sternum to the up- . per and lower margins of the costal cartilages; but the a anterior and posterior are much better marked, parti- cularly the first, which stretches obliquely from the aanterior surface of the cartUage of one side, decussating ^with its fellow across the sternum. It is covered by tthe aponeurosis of the great pectoral muscle. The Posterior Chondro-sternal.—This is much >weaker than the last, but is arranged in a similar man- iner, presenting the same radiated appearance on the ITHE ANATOMY OF THE JOINTS. 162 back part of the sternum, where it corresponds to the anterior mediastinum and the parts contained in it. SACRO-VERTEBRAL ARTICULATION. The union of the spinal column with the sacrum is closely analogous to that of the vertebrse with each other, but is remarkable for the great vertical depth in front of the intervertebral disc, and its shallowness be- hind contributing in a great measure to the production of the prominence which is so observable in front. In addition, however, to the ligaments which it has in common with the spine, it likewise possesses another peculiar to it,'—the sacro-vertebral, a strong fasciculus of fibres, which extends from the transverse process of the fifth lumbar vertebra, and is inserted into the back part of the base of the sacrum, where it becomes blended with the sacro-iliac ligaments. It is extremely hard to dissect, from the manner in which the ten- dinous origins of the erectors of the spine are blended with it. SACRO-COCCYGEAL ARTICULATION. This is an arthrodial joint in early life, although at a later period it becomes a synarthrosis, the two bones composing it being united by ossific deposit. Its mode of connexion consists of an anterior and posterior liga- ment, and a thin disc of fibro-cartilage. Anterior Sacro-coccygeal Ligament This usu- ally consists of two distinct bands, with a slight inter- val between them, stretching from the anterior surface of the sacrum to the front of the coccyx. To expose it, the rectum must be removed, some loose areolar tis- sue, and coccygeal ganglion of sympathetic. Generally speaking, it is always comparatively weak. Posterior Sacro-coccygeal.—This stretches from the last tubercles on the lower edge of the sacrum to similar processes on the upper part of the coccyx. It is rather stronger than the anterior, and completes the spinal canal below. The glutajus maximus covers and takes an origin from it.PELVIC LIGAMENTS. 163 The FiBRO-CARTiLAGiNOUS Disc is thin -when con- 1 trasted with those between the bodies of the vertebrae. 1 It is always, however, denser in the female than in the } male. The strength of this articulation is greatly increased I by the origin of the sciatic ligaments, which, stretching I along their sides, form a strong bond of union between the adjacent bones. ILIO-LUMBAR ARTICULATION. There is no direct union between the last lumbar vertebra and the ilium, but they are connected together by a powerful ligament,—the ilio-lumbar. This arises narrow from the under part of the transverse process of the fifth lumbar vertebra, and, becoming broad and expanded, is inserted into the posterior superior spi- nous process and a part of the adjacent crest. The strength of this ligament is much increased by the muscles that are attached to it,—the gluteus maximus and iliacus internus springing from it below, and the latissimus dorsi, erectores of the spine, and quadratus lumborum, superiorly. It is a syndesmoid articulation, nearly the strongest of that class in the whole body, and is exposed by removing the muscles that have been enumerated. SACRO-ILIAC ARTICULATION. This belongs to the class amphiarthrosis, and is formed by the apposition of the sacrum and os innomi- natum. To examine this joint, as well as the ligaments of the other articulations, it will be necessary to divide the horizontal ramus of the pubis immediately exter- nal to its spine directly downwards into the thyroid hole, carrying the saw afterwards through the junction of the descending ramus of the same bone where it joins the ascending of the ischium; by now forcibly tearing asunder the sacro-iliac symphysis of the corre- sponding side, we will be enabled to examine the joint under consideration,—the symphysis pubis, and both sacro-ischiatic ligaments on the larger portion.164 THE ANATOMY OF THE JOINTS. The Sacro-iliac Synchondrosis has for its security anterior and posterior ligaments, with a dense cartila^^e of incrustation. ° Anterior Ligament—This requires very little pre- paration,—merely the removal of the great vessels and nerves, and a little loose areolar tissue, when it is brought into view, consisting of a series of parallel fibres of unequal lengths, stretching from the surfaces of one bone to the other, by no means remarkable for their strength. It is covered by the lumbo-sacral nerve and internal iliac arteries. Posterior Ligament.—A tedious dissection is neces- sary to expose this, as all the muscles on the back of the sacrum must be removed, as the ligaments lie deeply between its spines and the posterior edge of the ilium. In its character it differs completely from the preced- ing, as it consists of three or four triangular fasciculi of exceeding strength and thickness, stretching between the tubercles on the back of the sacrum, and the adja- cent non-articular surface of the ilium. When these are cautiously removed, another deeper set are brought into view, much weaker, horizontal, and running pa- rallel to each other between the contiguous edges of the two bones. They are, as we have already stated, co- vered by the organs of the lumbar muscles, and rest on the bones from which they are separated by a quantity of loose areolar tissue, through which ramify several very large veins. Having examined those ligaments, they may now be divided; and having torn the bones forcibly from each other,—an operation sometimes of great difficulty, as they are generally more or less anchylosed,—the inter- vening cartilage may be observed. It is thick, particu- larly on the sacrum, and very rough, so that the pro- cesses of the one seem to indigitate with corresponding ones of the other, rendering the joint by this arrange- ment very secure, even without the aid of its ligaments. It has been said that a synovial membrane can be de- tected in this articulation both in childhood and in the female during the period of pregnancy. In the first there is no doubt a structure bearing a close resem- blance to a tissue of this nature, but in the latter we165 PELVIC LIGAMENTS. aave never had an opportunity of demonstrating it. Fa'rom an examination made in repeated instances, it ■nay be safely stated that any motion that does exist is ivery limited, indeed, in the great majority of cases, not poerceptible, a fact that might be inferred from the pow- ecrful nature of its connecting media. LATERAL LIGAMENTS OF THE PELVIC OUTLET. These are two in number, commonly called the c^reater and lesser sacro-sciatic, from the marked difFe- rcence in their size. The greater, which is also exter- naal, is of an irregular hour-glass figure, but much bDroader posteriorly than anteriorly. It arises behind ffrom the posterior inferior spine of the ilium, from the sside of the sacrum and coccyx, extending on the latter Ibone for about its first and second pieces; it stretches I obliquely downwards, forwards, and outwards, becom- iing narrow as it crosses the lesser sciatic notch, again I expands on reaching the tuberosity of the ischium, into i the inner lip of which it is inserted, as well as into its iascending ramus, where it becomes continuous with tthe base of the triangular ligament. Its internal mar- gin is prolonged inwards and slightly upwards for some cdistance, processus falciformis, which, vmiting with the lobturator fascia, leaves a slight interval between it and tthe obturator muscle, for the reception of the pudic \vessels and nerves; its external expands over the pyri- fformis muscle. The great sciatic ligament is covered externally by tthe glutseus maximus, which is very closely adherent tto it, and more anteriorly by the hamstring muscles \ which arise from it. Internally it corresponds to the . lesser sciatic ligament and coccygeal branch of the is- i chiatic artery posteriorly, and to the fat in the ischio- 1 rectal fossa and pudic artery more anteriorly. Lesser Sacro-sciatic Ligament—This is trian- igular in figure, broad posteriorly, and narrow and ! pointed anteriorly. It is attached behind to the side I of the sacrum and coccyx, and takes a more horizontal ' course to be inserted into the posterior edge of the ; spine of the ischium. It is much weaker and shorterTHE ANATOMY OF THE JOINTS. 166 than the preceding, internal to whicla it lies. Exter- nally it is in relation with the greater sacro-sciatic and ramus coccygasus of the ischiatic artery. Internally it corresponds to the coccygseus muscle. Exclusive of their evident use to complete the infe- rior outlet of the pelvis, these ligaments must likewise confer on it a great amount of strength, from the mode in which they are stretched between two fixed points of it, connecting them like the stays of a chain bridge, without at the same time interfering with the im- portant parts that pass through the notches, which they circumscribe, and which have been already enumerated in the general description of the pelvis. OBTURATOR LIGAMENT. This must be exposed by removing carefully the two muscles of the same name, which are closely at- tached to it. Thin, but extremely strong and unyield- ing, and composed of fibres interlacing with each other, so as to give it a reticular appearance, it is attached posteriorly and externally to the outer edge of the ob- turator foramen, and anteriorly and internally to its posterior, thus completely filling it up, except supe- riorly, where an aperture is left oblique in its nature for the passage of the vessels and nerves. As we have already remarked, it is in contact by both its surfaces with the obturator muscles. SYMPHISIS PUBIS. This is an amphiarthrodial joint, possessing a slight degree of motion. It is formed by the two ossa pubis of opposite sides, but it is to be observed that they do not touch anteriorly, a broad interval existing between them in this direction, which in the natural state of the part is filled up by cartilage of a wedge-shape, with the base turned forwards, and closely adherent by its lateral surfaces to the opposite bones. In addition to this cartilage, we have the security of the joint fur- ther increased by an anterior and posterior, a superior and inferior ligament.PELVIC LIGAMENTS. 167 Anterior Ligament This may be brought into yiew by cautiously removing the muscles attached to ■.;the anterior part of the crest. It consists of a series of cbblique fibres, stretching from one bone to the other, tihose of the left side crossing in front of those of the riright. They are seldom very well marked, and are ccovered by the decussating tendons of the external ijojblique muscle, which thus adds greatly to their I sstrength. Posterior Ligament—By removing the fascia from tthe back part of the symphisis, this will be exposed. l[t diiFers from the preceding in the arrangement of its fibres, which are transverse and much weaker. It is ;oncealed by the pelvic fascia, as it dips downwards to [ terminate in the true ligaments of the bladder. Superior Ligament—This is strong, rounded, and ccord-like, a continuation of Poupart's ligament. It ex- pends across the whole of the upper edge of the crest, lifrom the spine of one side to that of the opposite, be- ccoming exceedingly thick opposite the articulation. It sgives attachment to the muscles of the abdomen, parti- ccularly the recti. Inferior Ligament stretches across between the rrami of opposite sides, immediately beneath the sym- {phisis. It is broad at its points of attachment, but irounded and flattened out about its centre, presenting aan arched appearance, with the concavity directed down- \wards. It forms the strongest bond of union of the 3articulation, and its strength is still further increased Iby the triangular urethral ligament, with which it is in - some degree continuous below. Interpubic Fibro-cartilage.—In order to obtain a i : proper idea of this, a horizontal section must be made I across the joint about its centre, by which means the ' wedge-like appearance of the fibro-cartilage will be at once understood. In the disposition of its fibres it 1 bears a close resemblance to those of the discs of the : spinal column, being dense at the margins, and semi- ! fluid and palpy in the centre. They cross each other ■ very obliquely, to be firmly implanted into the contigu- ous surfaces of the opposite bones. It is, however, ' denser in its character, and would of itself be quite168 THE ANATOMY OF THE JOINTS. sufficient to bestow great solidity on the articulation, exclusive of the other ligaments which protect it. ILIO-FEMORAL ARTICULATION. This is true enarthrosis, or ball-and-socket joint, the deep cup or acetabulum of the os innominatum re- ceiving the globular head of the femur. As it is an ar- ticulation the functions of which are so incessantly called into play, nature has taken pains to confer on it a proportionate degree of strength, depending as well on its muscular as ligamentous connexions. The latter consist of five—the capsular, accessary or ilio-femoral, teres or round, cotyloid, and transverse. Capsular.—All the muscles around the articulation must be cautiously removed, in order to examine this, as well as the loose areolar tissue which is sometimes very abundant in this situation. When perfectly ex- posed, we observe it to be of a dull, opaque, white colour; in shape cylindrical, but much more capacious above than below,—attached superiorly around the acetabulum, but not to the cotyloid ligament, which lies free within it, and separated from it by the syno- vial membrane, which is inflected between them, in- serted inferiorly into the anterior intertrochanteric line, and posterior part of the neck of the femur, at the junction of its external with its two internal thirds, so that it is much longer in front than behind. As a liga- ment, it is tense and strong, especially superiorly and externally, where the principal weight of the body is thrown, as in progression, but internally and inferiorly it is comparatively laxer and weaker. The several muscles which surround it must, in a great measure, contribute to its power of resisting displacement of the bones which it encloses. Thus we find the psoas, iliacus, and internal head of the rectus, sweeping down in front; and the very motion which would have a ten- dency to rupture the capsule in this direction, viz:— over-extension,—naturally brings their tendons to the highest pitch of tension, which must have a powerful influence in keeping the bone fixed in its socket. Ex- ternally it is strengthened by the gluteus medius, andILIO-FEMORAL ARTICXJLATION. 160 I minimus and outer head of the rectus. Posteriorly the same remark applies to the several rotators out- wards, for the position of the limb, semiflexed and fwisted inwards, favourable to displacement in this direction, will necessarily put them on the stretch, and cause them to make pressure upon the protruding head. Inferiorly and internally the tendon of the ob- turator sweeps beneath it, and partially sustains it in forced abduction. Ilio-Femoral or Accessory Ligament.—This is a dense, flattened band of fibres, apparently a thickened portion of the capside, arising from the anterior infe- irior spinous process of the ilium; and passing from this point downwards, backwards, and outwards, it is inserted into a rough space anterior to the lesser tro- L'chanter. It rests upon the capsule, and is covered by the ttendons of the psoas and iliacus. Its use is to prevent oover-rotation inwards, and extreme extension; and in t'lforcibly attempting either of those motions, it becomes eexceedingly tense, and resists every effort to carry it tbeyond a certain point. LiGAMENTDM Teres, or EoUND LiGAMENT.—The cap- <sule must be divided, and the head of the bone dislo- ccated, in order to bring this into view. The syno- vial membrane which invests it must be cautiously cdissected off", when the ligament is seen to arise by two -small crura from the upper and lower edge of the notch lin the acetabulum; and proceeding outwards, back- mards, and upwards, they unite into one, but diverge ;again before they reach the head of the bone; and, becoming twisted and expanded, are inserted into a de- pression below its transverse axis. Eegarded as a liga- iraent, it is of very little use indeed to confer security on the joint; but it forms the medium by which the ves- sels are conducted to the head of the bone, as well as a jiieans of reflecting the synovial membrane from the ihead to the acetabulum. As it is closely connected to the IHaversian gland, it may be likewise of use in moving tthis, so as to fill up the several interstices which must ttake place in the various motions of the joint. Cotyloid Ligament—This, which is fully exposed by itheremovalof thecapsular, is attached all round the brimTHE ANATOMY OF THE JOINTS. 170 of the acetabulum, and deepens the cavity to a conside- rable extent, while at the same time it fills up all its de- pressions and sinuosities, and renders it quite plain on its free border. A section of it would represent nearly an equilateral triangle, which shows that it is much thicker at its attached than its femoral border; the latter also forms a smaller circle than the former, closely embracing the neck of the bone, and in a great degree adding to the strength of the articulation. On examining it behind and above, we find it much denser and stronger at this point than at any other, the reason for which is obvious, this being the point on which the entire weight of the body is thrown in the upright position. The fibres which compose this ligament are not concentric, but they spring from all parts of the margin of the acetabulum, decussate each other at a very acute angle, and terminate finally in its free margin, in a kind of rounded cord. Its extremities, on reaching the notch, are prolonged across it; the one from above being inserted into its lower lip; that from below into its upper, leaving between them and the edge of the bone, an irregular foramen for the passage of the vessels and nerves to the articulation. Transverse Ligament.—This is sometimes very ob- scure, consisting merely of a few fibres stretching across to complete the interval which must exist between the decussating extremities of the cotyloid ligament, as they dip backwards to their insertion. In addition to those already described, there is ano- ther peculiar to the femur alone, called the cervical ligament. It is found surrounding the neck, stretching obliquely upwards and inwards, from the insertion of the capsular to the sinuous line which defines the head. It usually consists of strong ligamentous fibres rarely continuous, covered by folds (retinacula) of the synovial membrane (Stanley's Ligament). Synovial Membrane—This envelopes the head of the bone, the acetabulum, and ligamentum teres. It also sends off" two small processes, one into the narrow groove which separates the cotyloid ligament from the cartilage of incrustation, and another, which becomes blended with the mass of fat, found in the inferior and internal part of the acetabulum, and described by171 ILIO-FEMORAL ARTICULATION. Clopton Havers as a gland for the secretion of the synovial fluid for the lubrication of the joint. Without stopping to inquire whether this idea has any founda- tion or not, we will merely observe that its more obvious use is to form an elastic cushion for the sup- port of the head of the bone, and to fill up any interstices that might occur in its varied motions. The Motions of the ilio-femoral articulation are very numerous. They consist of flexion, extension, abduc- ,tion, adduction, circumduction, and rotation. Flexion.—This motion is very extensive, and may be carried so far, that the anterior surfaces of the thigh and abdomen will come in contact, while the head of the femur rolls in the acetabulum on an imaginary axis, represented by a line passing upwards and inwards through its neck. Extension.—This is limited from several causes:—from the peculiar aspect of the acetabulum; any attempt at throwing the thigh backwards, bringing the neck of the femur in contact with the lower edge of this cavity, which forms the fulcrum on which the head is thrown forwards, thus protruding the capsule. The ilio-femoral ligament, with the tendons of the psoas, iliacus, and rectus, are immediately rendered tense, and powerfully resist all further movement in this direction. Abduction is very considerable. The laxity of the capsule internally permits the head to glide partially out of the cotyloid cavity, while the great trochanter points towards the ala of the ilium. This has the effect of bringing the upper part of the neck in contact with the edge of the acetabulum, which necessarily resists all further motion in this direction. Adduction is extremely slight, as the meeting of the thighs limits it at once; but if either be slightly flexed, it may be carried over the other for some extent. The ligamentum teres and the rotator muscles becoming tense prevent its being carried beyond a certain point. Circumduction. — This is merely the revolution of the limb, forming a cone, the apex being at the joint, and the base below formed by an imaginary circle de- scribed by the foot. Rotation In this motion the head turns slightly172 THE ANATOMY OF THE JOINTS. in the socket, but the radius, above, is the neck of the bone. In its lower part it does not revolve on an axis corresponding to the femur, but on an imaginary line supposed to be passed from the joint to the internal condyle. Rotation outwards is always better marked than that inwards. FEMORO-TIBIAL ARTICULATION. This is one of the most important articulations in the whole body, and as it is continually brought into action in all our movements, nature has been solicitous to confer on it the utmost security, in order to preserve the parts which compose it in proper apposition. For this reason we will find that its ligaments are extremely numerous, but so placed as in no degree to interfere -with the due degree of motion required, while it is fur- ther strengthened by a series of tendons, so disposed as to perform the office of ligaments, when their functions as muscles are no longer of value. It belongs to the class of angular ginglymus; but as it possesses a slight degree of rotatory motion, it is of course incomplete, though in all other respects it exhibits the usual cha- racteristics of this form of articulation. Its media of connexion consist of, first, an imperfect capsule; second, an anterior ligament; third, a posterior, or that of Wins- low; fourth, an external; fifth, an internal; sixth, a mucous; seventh, two alar; eighth, two crucial; ninth, ligament of Wrisberg; tenth, coronary; eleventh, trans- verse; twelve, two semilunar cartilages to deepen the cavity of the tibia for the reception of the condyles of the femur. The bones which enter into its formation are three:—the femur above; the tibia below, and the patella in front. Imperfect or Surgical Capsule.—This consists of three layers, the fascia lata most superficially, beneath which is an expansion from the adjacent tendons; and still deeper, a thin fibrous layer from the surrounding ligaments. The first of these, or the fascia lata, is extremely strong in this region. It is stretched tensely across, and is firmly inserted into the condyles at each side, adhering to the surface of the patella as it passesFEMORO-TIBIAL ARTICULATION. 173 over it; below it is attached to the tibia internally and externally, and to its tubercle in front. When this is cautiously removed, the second layer, formed by the expansion from the rectus anteriorly, the vasti laterally, and the semimembranosus behind, is exposed; and like the preceding, is inserted around the head of the tibia. This is very dense immediately over the front of the joint. The third layer, or that derived from the liga- ments, is thin; but its existence can, nevertheless, be clearly demonstrated, its principal use being to confine the large synovial sac which lines the articulation within its proper cavity. Having concluded the examination of the capsule, it may be removed, and the tendons surrounding the joint cut and thrown down; the ligaments may be detached from the synovial membrane, and separately examined. Anterior Ligament, or Ligamentum PATELLiE.— This is situated immediately in front of the articula- tion, and from its general character evidently appears to be a continuation of the common extensors of the leg; the patella being interposed as a sesamoid bone, in. order to bestow a different direction on their tendon. It arises by a broad origin from the point and anterior surface of the bone alluded to, and, passing nearly ver- tically downwards, is inserted into the lowest part of the tubercle of the tibia. As it descends it decreases considerably in tranverse width, but it becomes much thicker from before backwards. It rests posteriorly on a quantity of fat which separates it from the joint, and below on a bursa which intervenes between it and its tubercle of insertion. In front it is in relation with the capsule already described, and two bursse which are situated near its extremities. The fibres of this liga- ment are, when submitted to maceration, found to take a vertical direction, and to be united together by a fine areolar tissue. Ligament of Winslow—This is a broad aponeuro- tic band, given off from the outer margin of the semi- membranosus tendon, stretching upwards and outwards over the posterior condyloid notch, to be inserted into the external condyle of the femur; this is further strengthened by numerous fibres borrowed from theTHE ANATOMY OF THE JOINTS. 174 poplitaeus and gastrocnemius,—the whole forming a li- gament of vast strength; its deeper layer being con- nected to the edges of the tibia and margins of the semilunar cartilages; spreading out over the condyles at each side, so as to invest them with a kind of sheath; passing up superiorly, to be lost in the masses of fat found on the flattened posterior aspect of the femur; inferiorly, becoming continuous with the deep fascia of the leg; while opposite the flexure of the joint it is perforated by an oblique foramen, for the passage of the azygos artery, for the supply of the joint, its two ac- companying veins, and the articular branch of the ob- turator nerve. This ligament corresponds by its ante- rior surface to the back part of the tibia, semilunar cartilages, posterior crucial ligament, intercondyloid notch, and poplitsus muscle; and by its posterior to the popliteal vessels and nerves, with their branches, the heads of the gastrocnemius, plantaris, tendon of the semi- ten din osus, and a large quantity of adipose tissue. In extension it is extremely tense, while in flexion it be- comes relaxed. External Lateral Ligament. — This is strong, rounded, and cordlike, broader at its points of attach- ment than in the centre. It arises from a tubercle on the outer side of the external condyle, immediately above the popliteal groove, and, taking a direction down- wards, outwards, and backwards, is inserted into the upper part of the head of the fibula. In its course downwards it crosses the tendon of the poplitseus, which separates it from the external condyle and the inferior external articular artery, which divides it from the se- milunar cartilage of the same side. The tendon of the biceps lies at first posterior, but afterwards becomes external to it. This ligament occasionally bifurcates inferiorly, and under such circumstances its second in- sertion is into the outer part of the head of the tibia. Internal Lateral Ligament.— This is diamond- shaped, and differs from the preceding in being much flatter, broader, and stronger. It arises from a tubercle on the inner side of the internal condyle, below the in- sertion of the adductor magnus; its direction is down- wards and forwards, to be inserted into the inner andFEMORO-TIBIAL ARTICULATION. 175 .interior part of the tibia, a little below its head. It crosses in its course downwards the internal semilunar cartilage, to which it is firmly attached, the tendon of the semimembranosus, and the inferior internal articu- lar artery, both of which separate it from the tibia. By its internal surface it is crossed by the tendons of the sartorius, gracilis, and semitendinosus, as they arch forwards to tbeir insertion. Both the external and in- ternal lateral ligaments are attached posterior to the axis of motion, and are of course relaxed in flexion and rendered tense by extension. Rotation of the leg in- wards will also slightly relax them. Mucous Ligament This is exposed by throAving downwards and forwards the patella. In consists of a fold of synovial membrane, enveloping a thin process of fibrous tissue,—attached above to the intercondyloid fossa, and below to the mass of fat which lies imme- diately behind the patella. Alar Ligaments.—These are likewise processes of the synovial membrane,—continuations of the mucous, ■which are stretched downwards along the sides of the patella to the fat in front of the joint. The use of these and the preceding is to act upon the adipose tissue, and to cause it to fill up the several interstices that would otherwise exist within the cavity of the joint during its various motions. Crucial Ligaments These are two in number,— an anterior or external, and a posterior or internal. In order to obtain a good view of their course and attach- ments, all the external ligaments should be removed, as well as the mucous and alar; the synovial membrane, which is reflected round them, removed; and the lower part of the femur split vertically downwards by a cut that will pass antero-posteriorly between the condyles. The anterior crucial ligament arises broad from a de- pression in front of the spine of the tibia, is directed obliquely backwards, upwards, and otitwards, and is inserted into the inner side of the external condyle. The posterior takes its origin from a notch behind the spine, posterior to the cornua of both semilunar carti- lages, and, passing upwards, forwards, and inwards, is attached to the outer side of the internal condyle.176 THE ANATOMY OF THE JOINTS, From this arrangement it will be observed, that those bgaments cross each other as they proceed to the r destination at an oblique angle, and hence their nZZ They are strong; and as they are attached behind the tense in extension,-a motion which they completely iimit, if attempted to be carried to excess. The decus- sa ion can be removed, and the ligaments brought pa- rallel to each other, by rolling the leg outwards. ^In tTr.L^fli"'^ '^^bia, it will be recol- lected that the anterior is intimately connected to the anterior horn of the internal semilunar cartilage; and the posterior, which is the more vertical, to the poste- rior one of the external. ^ Ligament of WmsBERG.-This is not always to be found, and when present appears to be only an offset from the posterior crucial. It arises from the posterior edge of the external semilunar cartilage, and is inserted into the outer side of the internal condyle in front of the posterior crucial ligament. Its use appears to be to hx the posterior cornu of the external semilunar carti- lage, and prevent its displacement. Semk-unab Cartilages.—Iu order to examine these It will be necessary to detach the femur from the tibia by cutting across the crucial ligaments,—leaving how- ever, a small portion connected to the latter bone in order to observe more closely their attachments The semilunar cartilages are two in number,—an internal and external. The former, as its name implies, is cres- centic m shape; its cornua so far apart as to allow those ot the external, which is more circular, to be ™ped or embraced by them. In describing those cartilages, it will be necessary to give them a superior and inferior surface, an internal and external margin, and an ante- rior and posterior cornu. Their superior surface is concave, and corresponds to the convexities of the con- dyles of the femur; their inferior is convex, and is ac- curately moulded on the glenoid cavities of the tibia. Their external margins are thick, and are attached to the bone by some scattered fibres, the coronary liga- ment, and folds of the synovial membrane, called reti- nacula; their internal edges are thin and sharp, andFEMORO-TIBIAL ARTICULATION. 177 pass in on the articular surfaces of the bone to an un- equal extent,—the external covering nearly the whole of that portion of the head of its own side, while the internal leaves a large part of its corresponding tibial depression free. The cornua are sharp and pointed; those of the external inflected towards each other so as to approximate very closely, and are inserted into the fossa between the two prominences constituting the spine of the tibia; those of the internal are separated by a broader interval, and are severally attached to slight depressions, anterior and posterior to the spine, embracing the insertions of the preceding. It will be likewise recollected, that the internal lateral ligament is firmly connected to the circumferential margin of the internal cartilage; but the same rule does not apply to the external, as it is separated from its corresponding ligament by the tendon of the poplitseus and inferior external articular artery. The use of the semilunar cartilages is to deepen the cavity for the reception of the condyles of the femur, and to adapt it to the vary- ing convexities of the latter, as well as to break those shocks to which the joint would be liable from its con- struction, the bones which compose it being nearly per- pendicular to each other. ° Coronary Ligament.—This has been already cur- sorily alluded to. It consists of a few scattered bands of fibrous tissue, passing from the edges of the tibia to the margins of the semilunar cartilages. They are some- times very difiicult to be demonstrated. Transverse Ligament.—This must be exposed by a cautious removal of the fat in front of the joint. It is thm but strong, and is attached on either side to the anterior margins of both semilunar cartilages. Its ob- vious use is to prevent the displacement of these from each other,—an accident they would be liable to from their wedgehke shape, when by the weight of the body transmitted to the condyles they must necessarily be compressed and forced outwards. _ Synovial Membrane.—This is one of the most capa- cious of this class in the whole body: it lines the entire cavity of the joint, covers the articular extremities of the bones, the semilunar cartilages, invests the crucial I 3THE ANATOMY OF THE JOINTS. 178 ligaments, is reflected around the fat behind the pa- tella, over the posterior surface of which and its proper ligament it is also spread out; it throws off distinct folds, forming the mucous and alar ligaments already described, and, passing upwards beneath the extensor tendons, it forms a large cul de sac, which extends for some distance between the vastus internus and the bone. Its continuity is clearly demonstrated from disease. Adipose Tissue.—This is found in a great quantity in this joint. Besides the large mass which is situated immediately behind the iigamentum patella, it occupies likewise the space between both condyles. Always ex- isting, even after the most wasting disease, which only ap- pears to modify its structure, rendering it of a more wa- tery character, without sensibly diminishing its volume. Motions.—These are confined to flexion and exten- sion, with slight rotation. Flexion. — This is most extensive, and is limited only by the leg and thigh coming in contact; in this motion the head of the tibia glides upon the rounded condyles of the femur, relaxing all the ligaments but that of the patella, which becomes extremely tense and prominent; in this condition the knee presents gene- rally a rounded form, owing to the position of the pa- tella, which covers in the depression which would otherwise naturally exist between the bones, forming a kind of shield for its protection, while so firmly is it fixed in the trochlea of the femur that it resists every effort to displace it. Extension can be only carried so far as to bring the thigh and leg to a straight line, but any motion beyond this is impossible, as all the ligaments, with the excep- tion of the Iigamentum patellas, are on the stretch; the several tendons also which glide behind the condyles are in the same state, and actively resist further motion in this direction; the knee may, in fact, be compared to a hinge at present much used by mechanics, which from its peculiar construction permits motion in one direc- tion, while it limits it completely in the opposite; it is called a stop-hinge. Rotation.—This is very inconsiderable, and may be said only to exist in semiflexion; in this motion the179 TIBIO-FIBULAR ARTICULATION. internal condyle of the femur is fixed, while the exter- nal glides in the corresponding socket of the tibia. The active instruments in producing this motion are the biceps and poplitseus, the former pulling the head of the fibula, and, of course, that of the tibia, to which it is firmly connected, backwards, while the latter replaces it in its original position; rotation is more extensive outwards than inwards, owing to the peculiar arrange- ment of the crucial ligaments,—in the first they are untwisted, and become nearly parallel to each other, while in the second their decussation is increased, limiting effectually all further inversion. TIBIO-FIBULAR ARTICULATION. The tibia and fibula articulate with each other above and below, forming at each point a plane arthrodial joint, the motions of which are of a gliding character, but very inconsiderable; they are secured by very strong ligaments, partictilarly inferiorly, while a powerful in- terosseous serves as a further bond of union between the bones. Superior Tibio-fibular Ligaments.—These are an- terior and posterior, consisting of very strong fibres, irrunning obliquely from above and within, downwards j and outwards; they are extremely tense, and scarcely permit the slightest motion between the contiguous surfaces; they are covered in by the tendinous origins if the extensor longus, peronseus, and solseus; a synovial membrane, sometimes isolated, but sometimes conti- nuous with that of the knee, lines the joint. Interosseous Ligament This extends between the adjacent margins of the bones nearly for their entire length, being, however, deficient above, for the passage of the anterior tibial vessels, and below for the ante- rior peroneal; it is exceedingly strong, the majority of its fibres running from within, downwards and out- j wards, but traversed by others fewer in number, and ttaking a contrary direction; besides its use as a liga- nraent, it likewise serves to give origin to the numerous ranuscles which are found in this region. Inferior Tibio-fibular Ligaments.—These are three lin number,—an anterior, a posterior, and an interos-180 THE ANATOMY OF THE JOINTS. seous; the two former are very strong, composed of dense white fibrous tissue, running in parallel fasciculi from the anterior and posterior parts of the tibia, downwards and outwards, to the corresponding margins of the external malleolus; they are prolonged^ particu- larly the posterior, below the edges of the tibia, and thus tend to increase materially the depth of the arti- cular socket for the reception of the astragalus; the fasciculi which compose these ligaments are occasionally interrupted by a considerable interval, which has led many anatomists to describe them as double; that in front is covered by the extensor, and that behind by the flexor tendons. Interosseous or Middle Trtjio-FisuLAR Liga-aient This is so completely enveloped in adipose tissue, that it is sometimes difficult to find it; when, however, this has been removed, its white shining fibres will be ob- served decussating with each other, and extending for some distance between the adjacent bones; its rem°ark- able strength may be tested by dividing the anterior and posterior ligaments, and then endeavouring to se- parate them: this will often be found an operation of some difficulty. Synovial Membrane—This is a process derived from that of the ankle-joint. ANKLE-JOINT. The tibia, fibula, and astragalus, enter into the for- mation of this articulation, which, from the motions which it possesses, is termed an incomplete ano-ular ginglymus; it is remarkable for its great strength and security, which it derives as well from its powerful ligaments, as the manner in which the bones that com- pose it are arranged,—the two malleoli with the ante- rior and posterior tibio-fibular ligaments, constituting a very perfect socket for the reception of the trochlea of the astragalus; the several tendons springing from the leg likewise act as auxiliary media in conferring additional security on the articulation. Its ligaments consist of an anterior, a posterior, an external, and an internal lateral. Anterior Ligament.—This is exposed by removing the extensor tendons from the front of the joint, but181 ANKLE-JOINT. this must be done with great caution, as the ligament is very weak in its character; it arises from the whole of the convex surface of the tibia, a little above its in- ferior border, from which it descends to be inserted into the upper part of the astragalus, close to its head; it is lax and of little iise as a means of connexion, serving apparently to protect and confine the synovial membrane within the joint. Posterior Ligament.—This is brought into view by removing the flexor tendons; it is much weaker than the last, indeed its existence has been altogether denied by several anatomists; it can, however, be generally demon- strated as a thin layer of lax fibrous tissue, stretching between the inferior margin of the tibia posteriorly, and the groove behind the trochlear surface of the astragalus inferiorly; it is solely of use as a protection to the syno- vial membrane. External Lateral Ligament This consists of three distinct slips or processes,—an anterior, a posterior, and a middle; the first of these is short but broad, it arises from the anterior edge of the external malleolus, from which it stretches downwards, forwards, and inwards, to be inserted into the outer side of the neck of the astraga- lus ; it is covered by the peronajus anticus; the middle pro- cess is extremely strong and rounded,—its origin is from the inferior extremity of the malleolus, from which it de- scends, with a slight obliquity backwards, to be inserted into a tubercle on the outer side of the os calcis; it is strong, and partially covered by the sheath of the pero- nsei tendons; the posterior is long and nearly horizontal; it is attached to a depression on the inner and posterior part of the malleolus, and proceeds inwards and back- wards, to be implanted into the edge of the astragalus external to its tubercle posteriorly; from this point three processes are sent off,—one superiorly and inter- nally, to the back part of the tibia; one directly inter- nally, to bind down the flexor pollicis in its groove; and one inferiorly, to be inserted into the upper part of the os calcis: this might almost truly be calledkn interosseous ligament, being partially within the joint, and running nearly parallel to the posterior tibio-fibular ligament. Internal Lateral Ligament. — This is much182 THE ANATOMY OP THE JOINTS. stronger than the preceding, and is composed of continu- ous fibres, but much broader below than above, and hence its name,—deltoid; it arises narrow from the inferior ex- tremity of the internal malleolus, and, passing downwards, its posterior fibres are inserted into a rough space on the inside of the astragalus, behind its articular facette,— its middle, a short dense mass, into the sustentaculum tali; and its anterior into the inner side of the scaphoid bone, becoming connected to the calcaneo-scaphoid liga- ment. Of all these processes the last is the weakest and longest, and the middle strongest and shortest; it is partially concealed by the tendons of the tibialis posti- cus and flexor communis, which cross it in their course to their insertion. In addition to those ligaments already described, the ankle-joint is surrounded by a series of others, termed annular, beneath which the several tendons run to their destination to the foot; they are three in number, called from their position, the anterior, external, and posterior or internal; the first is devoted to the extensor, the second to the perongei, and the third to the flexor, tendons. Anterior Annular Ligament.—This is quadrilate- ral in shape, but broader internally than externally; it consists of a series of strong transverse fibres, stretching obliquely from the front of the internal malleolus and scaphoid bone, downwards and outwards, to be inserted into the anterior surface of the external malleolus and OS calcis: it is composed of two layers, of which the superficial is much the stronger, united together by two septa, which leaves between them three distinct' canals for the passage of the extensor tendons; of these the most internal is occupied by the tibialis anticus, the middle by the extensor pollicis; but the two layers lie superficial to this tendon,its groove beingincomplete;and Jhe external by the extensor communis and peronseus tertius. This ligament is continuous above with the fascia of the leg, and below with the thin aponeurosis on the dorsum of the foot. External Annular Ligament.—This is short but very strong, attached above and anteriorly to the outer and back part of the external malleolus, and below and behind to the outer part of the os calcis, posterior to its183 ANKLE-JOINT. tubercle; it is divided into two compartments by a thin septum, affording passage to the tendons of the peronseus longus and brevis. Posterior or Internal Annular Ligament.—This is more dense and strong than either of the two preced- ing; it arises from the back part of the internal malleo- lus, and is directed downwards and backwards, to be inserted into the internal and posterior part of the os calcis; it, like the anterior, is divided into three canals by two septa,—the most internal being traversed by the tibialis posticus and flexor digitorum communis, but sepa- rated from each other by a thin process of fibrous tissue; the middle by the posterior tibial vessels and nerve; and the most external by the flexor pollicis proprius; this ligament has united to it superiorly the fascia of the back part of the leg, and inferiorly the internal process of the plantar, and one head of the abductor pollicis. Synovial Membrane—This is common both to the ankle-joint and the inferior tibio-fibular articulation; it forms a loose fold anteriorly and posteriorly, but is tense laterally,—an arrangement that might be inferred from the peculiar motions of the joint. Motions.—These, according to very high, and indeed the best, authorities, are confined simply to flexion and extension; rotation or lateral motion, however limited, being impossible, from the peculiar mechanism of the j oint. ExtCTision.—This movement is remarkable from the manner in which the articular surfaces of the opposing bones become altered in their relations to each other; the trochlea of the astragalus gliding forward beneath the inferior extremity of the tibia, so that the posterior lip of the former rests on the groove of the latter posteriorly; beyond this extension cannot be carried, as the anterior portion of the internal lateral, and the anterior slip of the external lateral ligament, with the extensor tendons, are put violently on the stretch, and present an insur- mountable obstacle to further motion in this direction. Flexion This is the reverse of the other ; the trochlear surface of the astragalus is carried backwards behind the tibia, and projects posteriorly, the anterior lip of the tibia resting on the neck of the astragalus; an excess in this movement is limited by the tension184 THE ANATOMY OF THE JOINTS. of the posterior portions of the internal and external lateral ligaments with the tendons posteriorly, which actively oppose it beyond a certain extent. There are a combination of several circumstances which confer on the ankle-joint a certain degree of security, and these it may be as well to recapitulate. In the first place, the tibia falling on the astragalus at a right angle, the weight of the body in the upright po- sition is transmitted in a manner admirably calculated to prevent displacement under natural conditions; secondly, the socket formed by the malleoli on either side, and the tibio-peroneal ligaments in front and be- hind, forms, with the elevation of the astragalus, a com- plete morticed joint, admitting of those motions calcu- lated to favour progression, without, however, any rotatory movement, except such as may depend, in a slight degree, on the elasticity of the fibula, which might diminish its security without adding materially to its useful functions; thirdly, we have observed that its ligamentous connexions are of a very powerful cha- racter, and these are further strengthened by the series of tendons acted on by the vital agency of their corre- sponding muscles Avhich surround the articulation, and, as sentinels, watch over and preserve the bones which compose it from displacement. CALCANEO-ASTRAGALOID ARTICULATION. This is a double arthrodia; the two bones which com- pose it coming in contact at two distinct points,—pos- teriorly and externally, and anteriorly and internally; the means of union between them consists of an inter- osseous, an external, and an internal ligament. Interosseous Ligament It is to be premised that for the examination of all the connecting media of the foot it will be necessary that all the soft structures should be removed, but this must be done with great care, as the tendinous origins of the numerous muscles of this region are intimately blended with the ligaments; but to form a just conception of the one at present under consideration, both the astragalus and os calcis must be sawn through from before backwards, which will enable the student to obtain a lateral view of it;TARSAL LIGAMENTS. 185 the only manner in Avhich he can acquire a proper idea of its true character; it consists of a series of oblique and vertical fibres of great strength, mixed up with a quantity of fat, stretching between the astragalus above and the os calcis below, occupying the groove which exists between them, and amply sufficient, except under the most peculiar circumstances, to maintain the union between them; it is broader and stronger externally than internally. External and Internal Lateral Ligaments.— These consist of a series of short fibres stretching be- tween the adjacent margins of the bones on each side, but they scarcely deserve the name that has been applied to them, as they are sometimes incapable of demonstration; the sheaths, however, of the flexor tendons, posteriorly and internally, confer a vast amount of security on the articulation in this direction. Synovial Membranes.—That of the posterior arti- culation is peculiar to this alone, and is very lax in its nature; that of the anterior is smaller, and conti- nuous with the astragalo-scaphoid. Motion, exceed- ingly limited, and of a gliding character. ASTRAGALO-SCAPHOID ARTICULATION. This is an arthrodial joint, formed by the convex and oval head of the astragalus, fitting into a corresponding oval depression on the back part of the scaphoid; pro- perly speaking, it*has only a single ligament for its security, which is found superiorly composed of a strong series of fibres springing from the upper part of the neck of the astragalus, and, passing forwards, are inserted into the upper and posterior margins of the scaphoid bone; it is strong and tense in its character; a loose synovial membrane, prolonged from the calcaneo- astragaloid articulation, lines the joint. Motion.—Very extensive, as the elasticity of the foot, in a great measure, may be referred to the union be- tween those two bones. The admitted strength of this articulation must by no means be inferred to depend on the simple ligamen- tous connexion just described, as its security is refer- rible to causes much more remote; a single glance willTHE ANATOMY OF THE JOINTS. 186 be sufficient to show, that as far as the contiguous sur- faces of the bones are concerned, displacement would appear to be the obvious consequence of force applied to them from above, the shallow cup of the scaphoid being quite insufficient to contain the large head of the astragalus, which, in its natural condition, protrudes from beneath it into the hollow of the foot; but nature has been careful to guard against such an accident by placing beneath it the calcaneo-scaphoid ligament, which both deepens the cavity, and at the same time supports the head of the bone, while, in addition to this, the tendon of the tibialis posticus, with its sesamoid bone developed in it, and rendered tense at the moment its assistance is more particularly required, winds beneath it to its insertion, and forms an active ligament to sus- tain it, as the weight transmitted from above would operate to depress it from its natural position. CALCANEO-CUBOID ARTICULATION. In this joint the anterior extremity of the os calcis articulates with the posterior of the cuboid; as the sur- faces are alternately concave and convex, the union takes place by a process termed mutual reception; its ligaments are,—a superior, an inferior, and internal. _ SuPEEiOR Calcaneo-cuboid Ligament.— This lies under the extensor digitorum brevis, which must be re- moved in order to see it. The fibres which compose it are rather weak, and stretch from fhe upper and ante- rior part of the os calcis to the posterior margin of the cuboid bone. Inferior Calcaneo-cuboid Ligament.—This pro- perly consists of two distinct portions,—a superficial, originally known as the ligamentum longum plantas, and a deep, the ligamentum breve. The first is a dense, shining, pearly band, extending from the whole of the under surface of the os calcis as far back as its tubercles, horizontally forwards to the inferior part of the cuboid, to be inserted into the posterior lip of the peroneal groove, and the rough space immediately behind it. In its character it is exceedingly strong. The deep por- tion is brought into view by cautiously removing the preceding, and a small quantity of adipose tissue which187 TARSAL LIGAMENTS. lies between them. It is shorter and weaker than the last, being attached behind to a ridge on the anterior part of the os calcis, and in front to the margin of the cuboid. The musculus accessorius must be removed in order to expose this ligament. Internal Calcaneo-cuboid Ligament—This is, pro- perly speaking, merely a continuation of the superior, but much thicker and stronger in its nature, passing between the adjacent surfaces of the bones on their in- ner side. In order to bring it into view, the fat and areolar tissue between the os calcis and astragalus, ex- ternally, must be removed. This is a very secure joint, not only from the pecu- liar shape of the contiguous surfaces, but likewise from its powerful ligamentous connexions. As in the astra- galo-scaphoid articulation, the providence of nature is likewise exemplified in the present instance, by placing the most powerful means of resistance on the sole of the foot, where it is more essentially required to resist the pressure from above. INDIRECT ARTICULATION OF CALCANETJM AND SCAPHOID. This is syndesmodial, as the two bones are at no point in apposition with each other. They are connected by two powerful ligaments,—a superior and inferior,—the latter of which is by far the stronger. Inferior Calcaneo-scaphoid Ligament.—This is broad and thick, triangular in shape, arising from the under surface and anterior part of the os calcis; from this it stretches inwards and slightly forwards, passes between the head of the astragalus above and the ten- don of the tibialis posticus below, where it is almost cartilaginous, and is ultimately inserted into the tu- bercle on the inferior and inner part of the scaphoid, and slightly into the adjacent surfaces of that bone. Its use, in addition to its forming a bond of union between the two bones under discussion, -with regard to the head of the astragalus, has been already alluded to. It is concealed by the musculus accessorius and long flexor tendons.'188 THE ANATOMY OF THE JOINTS. Superior Calcaneo-scaphoid Ligament.— This is smaller and weaker than the last, extending between the anterior edge of the os calcis and the outer side of the scaphoid. It appears to be an offset from the inter- nal calcaneo-cuboid ligament, and must be exposed in the same manner. UNION BETWEEN THE SCAPHOID AND CUBOID BONES. This is sometimes immediate,—small articular facettes existing on the adjacent surfaces of the bones for mu- tual contact, at other times they do not touch; how- ever, under either circumstances, they are united by a strong interosseous, and a superior and inferior, liga- ment. Interosseous Ligament.—This is short, but of great strength. It consists of a series of fibres, some trans- verse and some decussating, stretching between the op- posite bones. Superior Ligament—This is a narrow, flat band of fibres, extending obliquely outwards from the upper surface of the scaphoid to the corresponding one of the cuboid. Inferior Ligament. — Much stronger and thicker than the preceding. It arises from the outer edge of the tubercle of the scaphoid, and is inserted into the in- ner side of the cuboid, becoming continuous with the sheath of the peron^us longus. It is concealed by the origins of the deeper layer of the plantar muscles. This articulation is very strong, as may be proved by endeavouring to tear the bones forcibly from each other. articulations between the SCAPHOID AND CUNEIFORM BONES. The three cuneiform bones are in direct contact with the scaphoid, and are united by dorsal, plantar, and in- terosseous ligaments. Dorsal.—These are narrow slips, extending betweeu the superior surface of the adjacent bones. In the ar- ticulation between the internal cuneiform and the sea-189 TARSAL LIGAMENTS. phoid, the fibres pass directly forwards, but between the other two they pass obliquely forwards and out- wards. Plantar.—These are nearly analogous to the pre- ceding, but are much weaker, with the exception of the internal, which forms a dense fibrous cord blended with the second insertion of the tendon of the tibialis posti- cus. This articulation likewise presents a well-marked internal lateral ligament, stretching between the inner surfaces of the contiguous bones. Interosseous Ligaments are short, strong fibres, some transverse, others decussating,—stretching be- tween the non-articular edges of the adjacent bones. UNION BETWEEN THE CUBOID AND EXTERNAL CUNEIFORM. This is precisely similar to the last, comprehending dorsal, plantar, and interosseous ligaments; they there- fore require no separate description. The synovial membrane is reflected and continuous through all the articulations just described. ARTICULATION OF THE CUNEIFORM BONES WITH EACH OTHER. These bones partly lie in contact with each other, and are in part separated by intervals of unequal lengths. They are connected together by dorsal, plantar, and in- terosseous ligaments. Dorsal—These are broad bands, thin but strong, stretching from bone to bone nearly transversely across their upper surfaces; they are difficult of demonstra- tion, and are covered by the extensor tendons. Plantar.—These are nearly analogous to the last, but situated on the under surface of the foot; they are concealed by the deeper layer of plantar muscles. Interosseous.—These are very dense, consisting both of transverse and decussating fibres; they form the strongest bond of union between those bones. Synovial Membrane.—Tense, and common to them all.THE ANATOMY OF THE JOINTS. 190 TARSO-METATARSAL ARTICULATION. These are all arthrodial, and present such a varied ligamentous connexion, that it will be necessary to ex- amine each separately. We will accordingly begin with the first. 1. The first metatarsal bone articulates with one tarsal bone only,—the internal cuneiform. Its bond of union consists of two ligaments,—a superior or dorsal, and an inferior or plantar. They are formed by strong fibrous bands passing between the adjacent bones, the inferior being much the best marked. The tendon of the tibialis anticus over the upper and inner part, and the peroneeus longus below and internally, add mate- rially to the strength of the articulation. Its synovial membrane is peculiar to itself. 2. The second metatarsal bone articulates with the three cuneiform, being completely wedged between them, and is maintained in this position by dorsal and plantar ligaments. The former of these consists of three dis- tinct bands, the most internal passing from the upper surface of the internal cuneiform bone, forwards and outwards, to be inserted into the head of the metatarsal bone; the middle, of great strength, stretches horizontally between the middle cuneiform and the same bone; and the external, the weakest, between the third cuneiform and a similar insertion. These are covered by the extensor tendons. The plantar are only two in number, and nearly of the same strength; the most internal extends from the first cuneiform, forwards and outwards; and the external from the second, directly forwards, to be implanted into the sharp ridge on the under surface of the second metatarsal bone. They are covered by the deep plantar muscles. 3 The third metatarsal articulates with the third cuneiform only. Its ligaments are a dorsal and plantar. The former of these is a strong bundle of fibres extend- in<r between the adjacent bones, but the latter are weak and indistinct, and partially blended with the sheath of the peronajus longus. 4. The fourth metatarsal articulates with the cuboid,191 METATARSAL ARTICULATION. and sligbtly with the external cuneiform; it has a dor- sal ligament, which is double, but no plantar. A nar- row but strong band of fibres springs from the outer edge of the third cuneiform, and is implanted into the corresponding outer margin of the fourth metatarsal bone. A second arises from the upper surface of the cuboid, and passes horizontally forwards, to be inserted into the head of the same bone. An expansion of the sheath of the peronseus longus serves as its plantar li- gament. 5. The fifth metatarsal articulates with the cuboid only. It has one oblique dorsal ligament, extending forwards and outwards from the upper surface of the cuboid to the head of the metatarsal bone; but it de- rives additional security from other sources. Thus, below it is strengthened by the sheath of the pero- naeus longus, and externally by the insertion of the peronseus brevis and outer process of the plantar aponeurosis, which is inserted into the spur of the me- tatarsal bone. Synovial Membrane.—These are three in number, divided between the five metatarsal bones. One, as we have already stated, is confined exclusively to the first; another to the second and third; and another to the fourth and fifth. UNION OF THE METATARSAL BONES WITH EACH OTHER. This is amphiarthrodial, and the bond of rmion is by dorsal, plantar, and interosseous ligaments. The dorsal are a series of fibres, passing from the upper surface of one bone to the corresponding surface of the other, forming, in fact, a continuous band from the inside to the outside of the foot. The plantar are precisely simi- lar, but much thicker and stronger. Their principal security, however, depends on the interosseous, which stretch between the adjacent sides of the several bones They are short, but endued with vast strength.192 THE ANATOMY OF THE JOINTS. I UNION OF THE DIGITAL EXTREMITIES. These are not in contact with each other, but still are united by a transverse ligament of tolerable strength, though sufficiently loose to admit of free motion, which is further facilitated by a synovial membrane interposed between each. UNION OF THE METATARSAL BONES WITH THE PHA- LANGES. These constitute an imperfect angular ginglymus, the head of each metatarsal bone being received into the cup of the corresponding phalanx. They are con- nected by an external and internal lateral, and a supe- rior and inferior, ligament. The External and Internal Lateral are strong and thick They arise from a tubercle situated a little behind the head of the metatarsal bone, and passing forwards and downwards, becoming broader m their course, are inserted into the sides of the adjacent pha- ^^Tferior Ligament is of great strength particularly opposite the articulation. It is attached m front to the inferior lip of the first phalanx, from which it stretches backwards to be implanted into the under part of the neck of the metatarsal bone.

ARTICULATION OF THE PHALANGES WITH EACH OTHER. These are complete angular ginglymi, possessing only193 STERNO-CLAVICULAR ARTICULATION. motions of opposition, or flexion and extension. The mode of union between them is precisely similar to the last described, so that it would be to no purpose to re- peat them. The Foot must be regarded as the basis of support of the entire weight of the body; and with this object in view, nature has been more anxious to confer on it strength and solidity to enable it to perform this office effectually, than to endue it with that delicacy of move- ment, which she has so lavishly expended in the con- struction of the hand. We accordingly find that the motions, generally speaking, are those of a gliding nature, as far as the tarsus and metatarsus are con- cerned, with a slight power of abduction, adduction, and torsion between the first and second rows of the former. In the latter as well as the phalangeal articu- lation, the mobility is greatly increased. Flexion and extension prevail to a very marked extent, conferring elasticity in progression, without compromising the strength which is so essential to the security of this important organ. LIGAMENTS OF THE UPPER EXTREMITY. Steeno-clavicular Articulation.—This is formed by the union of two bones,—the extremity of the cla- vicle and the upper and lateral part of the sternum. From the peculiar configuration of the articulating sur- faces, alternately concave and convex, it is a joint by mutual reception, having for its security an anterior, a posterior, and an interclavicular ligament, with a thick intervening fibro-cartilage. Anterior Ligament—This consists of a series of strong fibres stretching obliquely downwards and in- wards from the anterior surface of the clavicle to the front of the sternum. Posterior Ligament—This is nearly similar to the preceding, but situated on the back part of the adjacent bones. A few scattered fibres on the upper surface of the articulation connect both together, and render them in some degree orbicular. It is right to remark, that one very high authority considers the posterior liga- KTHE ANATOMY OF THE JOINTS. 194 ment the stronger; but this we have never found to be the case in the repeated instances in which we have examined them. The anterior derives additional strength from the inner origin of the tendon of the sterno-mas- toid, the fibres of Avhich are intimately blended with them. Interarticular Fibro-caetilage.—This is exposed by dividing the preceding close to the sternum, and bending the clavicle downwards. It is rather circular in figure, extremely thick at its margins, which are closely united in front and behind to the anterior and pos- terior ligaments, but in the centre it is sometimes deficient; attached below to the sternum, where it arti- culates with the first rib, and above to the extremity of the clavicle, it forms an elastic cushion between the two bones, and breaks those shocks to which this joint is so peculiarly liable. Interclavicular Ligament.—This is exceedingly strong; it stretches between clavicle and_ clavicle, firmly attached to their non-articular extremities, and for some distance to their upper surfaces; it is concave superiorly, and has united to it the deep fascia of the neck; convex inferiorly, connected to the fourchette of the sternum, and posteriorly to the pericardium. If a section is made of this^ ligament, it is found to be tri- angular in shape. Synovial Membrane.—They are two m number; separated from each other by the fibro-cartilage; when this is perforated, they communicate with each other. A third synovial sac occasionally exists between the lower edge of the clavicle and the cartilage of the first rib, which is usually found to enlarge the articulating surface for the former to play upon. Motions. Forwards, backwards, upwards, and down- wards. In the first of these, or the motion of the shoul- der forwards, the articular surface of the clavicle glides backwards, and puts the posterior ligament on the stretch; in that backwards, the clavicle bulges forwards, and carries before it the anterior ligament, so that the limitation of both these movements depends "pon the unyielding nature of those media of connexion. When the shoulder is elevated, the clavicle gUdes outwardsCORACO-CLAVICULAR ARTICULATION. 195 on the facette of the sternum; the rhomboid or costo- clavicular ligament and subclavius forming the check that prevents this motion from being carried to a too great extent. In depression, the clavicle slips forwards; its shaft or body comes in contact with the first rib, which offers a strong barrier to its sinking too far in this direction. COSTO-CLAVICULAR ARTICULATION. The inferior part of the sternal extremity of the cla- vicle and the cartilage of the first rib are generally in contact with each other, and are united by a strong ligament, called from its shape,—the rhomboid. This arises from the upper edge of the cartilage of the first rib, and passes upwards and outwards, to be inserted into a rough ridge on the inferior surface of the cla- vicle. It is of great importance in strengthening the sterno-clavicular articulation, and preserving the bones which compose it in the requisite apposition with each other. CORACO-CLAVICULAR ARTICULATION". This is syndesmodial, as the bones which compose it are not in apposition with each other, but are connected by two powerful ligaments, deriving their name from their shape,—the conoid and trapezoid,—the former being triangular, and situated on a plane posterior and inter- nal to the latter, which is quadrilateral. The conoid takes its origin by a narrow-pointed extremity from the upper surface of the coracoid process near its root, and passes upwards to be inserted into two tubercles on the posterior edge of the inferior surface of the clavicle by a broad base. The trapezoid is attached to the inner lip of the coracoid process, and stretches obliquely up- wards and outwards to be implanted into a rough ridge on the clavicle, external and anterior to the last. On observing those ligaments from the outside, they appear to be single, and are, in fact, more or less continuous; but on viewing them from the inside, an interval trian- gular in shape exists between them, into which is pro- k2THE ANATOMY OF THE JOINTS. 196 longed a few fibres of the subclavius muscle and a small quantity of adipose tissue. The coraco-clavicular liga- ments are endued with great strength, and their obvious use is to prevent dislocation of the clavicle upwards on the acromion process of the scapula. They likewise, in a great measure, limit the backward and forward move- ment of the shoulder, which might be otherwise carried to a dangerous extent, as far as the security of the sterno-ciavicular articulation is concerned. ACROMIO-CLAVICULAR ARTICULATION. This is an arthrodial joint, formed by the union of the outer end of the clavicle with the inner side of the acromion process, connected by two ligaments,—a su- perior and inferior, with occasionally an interarticular fibro-cartilage. Superior Ligament—This is exposed by removing the deltoid and trapezius, with their aponeurosis which covers the articulation. It consists of a series of dense, strong fibres, stretching from the upper surface of the clavicle to that of the acromion process, being much stronger posteriorly than anteriorly. Inferior Ligament.—This is similar to the last, but weaker in its character. It is always covered with a quantity of adipose tissue, from which it is sometimes exceedingly difficult to isolate it. Interarticular Cartilage. — This we have very rarely had an opportunity of observing; where it does exist it is always thin, and only occupies the upper part of the articulation. Synovial Membrane—Small, and merely suflScient to cover the opposing articulating surfaces; it is some- times deficient. Motions.—These are both gliding and rotatory; both are pretty extensive, from the looseness of the connect- ing ligaments. The security of the articulation is much enhanced from the manner in which the two great muscles, the deltoid and trapezius, embrace it before and behind,—serving, in fact, as powerful ligaments to guard against displacement.SCAPULAR LIGAMENTS. 197 LIGAMENTS PROPER TO THE SCAPULA. These are exposed by removing all the muscular at- tachments from this bone, when they will be brought into view, consisting of the coraco-acromial, or trian- gular, the transverse, and the spino-glenoid. CORACO-ACROMIAL, or TRIANGULAR LiGAMENT.—This is a very powerful band of fibres, extending between the two processes of the scapula, immediately above the shoulder-joint. It arises by a narrow-pointed process from the under surface of the acromion, and passes downwards and inwards to be inserted by a broad base into the outer and posterior border of the coracoid for its whole length; its anterior edge being prolonged into a thin fascia separating the deltoid from the articula- tion; while its inferior surface is lined by a distinct synovial sac. This ligament, with the two processes to which it is attached, constitutes a perfect vault or arch, beneath which the head of the humerus plays, and which prevents dislocation upwards of that bone. In a recent dissection, we found it to be completely ossified. It is covered by the deltoid muscle, and lies upon the supraspinatus and a quantity of fat. Transverse Ligament—This is a strong bundle of fibres, stretching from the root of the coracoid process backwards to the posterior edge of the notch in the su- perior costa of the scapula. It converts it into a fora- men, through which the suprascapular nerve runs to its destination, while the suprascapular artery passes above it. The omohyoid tendon usually arises from it by a broad origin, and partially conceals it. Its use appears to be merely to protect the nerve, in its passage, from pressure. Spino-glenoid.—This scarcely deserves the name of a ligament, as it is usually constituted by a little areo- lar tissue stretching from the under part of the spine of the scapula to the outer lip of the glenoid cavity. A ridiculous use has been assigned to it,—that of sup- porting the glenoid cavity of the scapula and head of the humerus, and preventing their sinking into the ca- vity of the axilla in fractures of the neck of the latter198 THE ANATOMY OF THE JOINTS. bone. For this purpose it is obviously too weak; but it may be of use in protecting the branch of the supra- scapular artery, as it descends beneath it to the infra- spinous fossa, from the pressure of the adjacent muscles. SCAPULO-HUMERAL ARTICULATION. This is an arthrodial joint, for it scarcely deserves the name of enarthrosis, which has been sometimes ap- plied to it. Portions of two bones only enter into its formation,—the head of the humerus and glenoid ca- vity of the scapula; and these are connected by four ligaments,—the capsular, accessory or coraco-humeral, glenoid, and interarticular. Capsular.—In order to obtain a view of this liga- ment, the upper extremity must be detached from the trunk in the usual manner, the deltoid and coracoid muscles cut across at their origin and thrown down, and the capsular treated in the same manner; but their tendons of insertion must be left untouched, in order to observe their relative position with respect to the articulation. The capsule thus exposed resembles in figure a sack open at both extremities,—the superior, which is the smaller, being closely applied around the neck of the scapula, while the inferior encircles the de- pression immediately above the tubercles of the hume- rus, known as its anatomical neck. It must not, how- ever, be supposed to be sufliciently tense to preserve the bones to which it is attached in close apposition; on the contrary, it is exceedingly lax, and permits an interval of separation between them, varying from half to three- quarters of an inch; nor is it equally strong in all directions,—for superiorly and externally it is dense, while inferiorly and internally it is comparatively weak and thin. The fibres which compose it take generally a longitudinal course, stretching from the neck of the humerus to that of the scapula, but an interval usually exists between them at the upper edge of the subscapu- laris, through which a fold of the synovial membrane escapes to communicate with the bursa, separating its tendon from the bone; a second, likewise, occasionally is found in the position of the infraspiuatous tendon.SCAPDLO-HUMERAL ARTICULATION. 199 This ligament is in relation with, above, the supra-spi- natus; externally, with the infra-spinatus and teres minor; inferiorly and posteriorly, with the long head of the triceps; and internally, with the subscapularis tendon. It will be perceived at once, that a broad in- terval naturally exists between the two tendons last named, and here displacement most usually occurs. Accessory, or Coraco-humeral Ligament.—This is a dense band of fibres arising from the inferior and an- terior part of the coracoid process; it passes downwards and outwards, expanding as it proceeds, becoming blended and lost in the capsule, of which it is truly a part, immediately above the great tuberosity of the humerus. Its use is to limit over-extension of the arm and rotation outwards. Glenoid Ligament.—This is proper to the scapula itself, around the glenoid cavity of which it is inserted. If cut across, the section is triangular, the base attached, the apex free. It consists of a series of fibres irre- gularly disposed, and decussating each other very ob- liquely. It deepens the recipient cavity about a quar- ter of an inch, altering its shape from an ovoid, which it exhibits in the dry condition, to an oval. It appears to be of little use as a protection against dislocation, but it is of marked advantage in forming a cushion for the head of the humerus, to preserve it from being in- jured against the sharp edges of the socket in the nu- merous and free motions with which this joint has been endowed. It has been stated that this ligament is formed by the long tendon of the biceps, which bifur- cates, and thus encloses the cavity. Interarticular Ligament.—According to some au- thorities, this has been said to be formed by the tendon of the biceps, which traverses the articulation imme- diately beneath the capsule, and in support of this view cases have been cited where it has been found to be in- serted into the upper part of the bicipital groove be- tween the tuberosities, and from thence to have pro- ceeded as from a new point of origin in its course downwards. This we have never had an opportunity of witnessing in repeated examinations, but we have in several instances observed a complete deficiency of theTHE ANATOMY OF THE JOINTS. 200 tendon of the biceps from the upper part of the glenoid cavity to the tuberosities of the humerus, and in those cases it was firmly attached to the bicipital groove; but it was evidently the result of the disease. The inter- articular ligament is, more properly speaking, that de- scribed by Dr. Flood, of the Richmond, now the Car- michael. School of Medicine. It is exposed by throwing upwards the arm, and dividing the capsule in its infe- rior part,; a strong fold of synovial membrane will then be observed, enclosing a little fibrous tissue stretching from the inner side of the glenoid cavity, just where it is crossed by the tendon of the subscapularis, outwards and forwards, to be implanted into the upper part of the bicipital groove. It is bifid at its extremities; but indeed it varies in appearance, being sometimes exceed- ingly well marked, while in other instances it can scarcely be satisfactorily demonstrated. Synovial Membrane.—This is extensive, as, in addi- tion to its inflection within the joint, it likewise sends processes beyond it. Those to the burs^ of the infra- spinatus and subscapularis we have already alluded to, but a large process is also folded around the tendon of the biceps, which it accompanies for some distance, when it is again folded back, to become continuous with the general sac. Motions.—Very extensive, consisting of flexion, ex- tension, abduction, adduction, circumduction, and rota- tion. Flexion, or the motion forwards, can be carried to a great extent,—even so far that the humerus may be elevated vertically in a direction exactly opposite to the * position it occupies in its quiescent state. This mobi- lity is due in some degree to that of the scapula, which revolves on its imaginary axis in unison with the huine- rus, and is limited by its neck coming in contact with the triangular ligament. Extension is the reverse of the preceding, but cannot be carried so far, as it is checked by the tensity of the accessory ligament and the tendons which surround the articulation. Abduc- tion is remarkable for its extent. In this motion the head of the humerus leaves the glenoid cavity, and can be distinctly felt in the axilla, and hence the frequencyHUMEEO-CUBITAL ARTICULATION. 201 of displacement in this direction. Adduction is ex- ceedingly trifling, as the contact of the arm with the trunk presents an effectual bar to it. Circumduction. —This motion is very perfect, the head of the bone representing the point of the cone, and the revolution of its inferior extremity its base. Rotation.—This move- ment is enjoyed to a moderate degree, and is partially favoured by the muscles which are inserted into its neck, forming an angle to its shaft. HUMERO-CUBITAL ARTICULATION. This is formed by the union of three bones,—the humerus, ulna, and radius. The articulation of the two former bones, if taken separately, would constitute a complete ginglymoid joint; but as the radius likewise enters into its formation, and enjoys more unlimited motion than that of flexion and extension,—being, in fact, an arthrodia,—it will be necessary to class the el- bow under the designation of an arthrodial ginglymus. Its media of connexion are an anterior and a poste- rior, an internal and external lateral ligament. In or- der to obtain a good view of these, all the muscles about the joint should be removed, and this must be done with great caution, as several of them are inti- mately attached to them. Anterior Ligament.—This is thin, but possessed of a moderate degree of strength; it arises by a series of fibres which are implanted above the depression on the anterior surface of the humerus, particularly towards the internal condyle; from this it descends obliquely downwards and outwards, and is inserted into the coro- noid process of the ulna, becoming blended with the attachment of the orbicular ligament. Its strength is greatly increased by certain transverse fibres which cross it nearly at right angles, and it is covered by the brachialis anticus, which lies immediately over it. Posterior Ligament This, as contrasted Avith the preceding, is very weak and lax; it is attached to the humerus above the olecranon depression, and on either side to the back part of both condyles; as it sweeps across the joint, it is inserted by a few scattered fibres K 3202 THE ANATOMY OF THE JOINTS. into the upper edge of the olecranon process. The te- nuity and looseness of its structure are so obvious, that its use as a ligament may be fairly questioned, and it should be more properly regarded as a kind of protec- tion to the synovial membrane against the pressure of the tendon of the triceps, which lies directly over it. Internal Lateral Ligament.—This is possessed of great strength, and is triangular in shape. Strictly speakings it may be said to consist of two distinct fas- ciculi, continuous at their apex, but divergent at their base; bound together by a powerful transverse band, strong below, but gradually becoming weaker as it as- cends. The anterior slip arises from the internal con- dyle, and passes nearly vertically downwards to be in- serted into the inner side of the coronoid process; it affords a point of origin to the flexor sublimis. The posterior arises in common with the preceding, but its direction is downwards and backwards, to be implanted into the inner side of the olecranon; to this some fibres of the triceps are attached. The transverse band which connects them is inserted below into the lip of the sig- moid notch of the ulna, and is here dense and well marked, but as it passes upwards towards the internal condyle it gradually becomes weaker and less ligamen- tous in its character. Exteenal Lateral Ligament.—This is inferior m strength to the preceding, hut is of the same triangular shape. It arises from the external condyle by a narrow, thick, pointed extremity, and from this it descends nearly vertically, becoming gradually broader, and is inserted into the orbicular ligament of the radius, and by a few scattered fibres into the outer and anterior surface of the coronoid process. It is concealed and strengthened by the supinator brevis, which adheres to it very intimately. Synovial Membrane—This is common to this as well as the radio-ulnar articulation; it must therefore be necessarily extensive; posteriorly it is especially lax, where it blended with a little adipose tissue, and pro- longed for some distance between the triceps and bone. Motions.—Flexion and extension only. In the first of these movements the fore-arm can be bent on the arm203 RADIO-DLNAR ARTICULATION. until the coronoid process strikes against the fossa for its reception on the front of the humerus, but beyond this it cannot be carried. In this condition of extreme flexion the triceps and posterior ligament are on the stretch, while the hand, from the twisting inwards of the lower extremity of the humerus and obliquity of the trochlea, is directed towards the mouth. Extension is the opposite of the preceding, but it is much more circumscribed, as it is checked, the moment the arm and fore-arm form a continued straight line, by the olecra- non process striking against its recipient cavity poste- riorly, and the ligaments and muscles on the front of the joint becoming tense. The rapidity of these mo- tions is very remarkable, and depends upon an admirable contrivance of nature, by which strength, which is here not so much required, has been sacrificed to in- sure celerity; the tendons which act upon the joint being inserted so close to the centre of motion that a length of radius is obtained, the extremity of which, the hand, moves swiftly through the arc of its circle, with a very trifling contraction of the muscles which constitute the moving power. RADIO-ULNAR ARTICULATION. This is a double lateral ginglymus, the two bones constituting it being in contact laterally at two dis- tinct points,—above where the radius is received into a depression in the ulna, and below where the ulna is in turn received by the radius; they are united above by the orbicular and oblique ligaments, in the middle by the interrosseous, below by an anterior and a posterior, and indirectly by the attachments of the interarticular fibro-cartilage. Orbicular Ligament,—This is a flattened band of fibres, about a quarter of an inch deep, exceedingly strong, especially posteriorly, forming about three-fourths of a circle; its two extremities attached to the anterior and posterior edges of the lesser sigmoid notch, thus com- pleting the ring for the reception of the rim which sur- rounds the head of the radius. Its inferior margin forms the segment of a circle smaller than that of theTHE ANATOMY OF THE JOINTS. 204 superior, an arrangement whicli has a manifest tendency to add to the security of the articulation. It is covered in front and externally by the supinator brevis, which is intimately attached to it, and behind by the anconeus; above, the external lateral ligament is inserted into it, and below it is slightly prolonged on the neck of the radius. Synovial Membrane.—This is extended as a cul de sac from the elbow-joint. Oblique Ligament This is thin but strong, arising from the shaft of the ulna, immediately below the co- ronoid process, from which it passes downwards and outwards to be inserted into the anterior surface of the radius, below its tuberosity. It lies between the supi- nator brevis and flexor sublimis, supination renders it quite tense, while pronation relaxes it. Interosseous Membrane.—This, like that between the tibia and fibula, is extremely strong. It consists of a series of fibres, stretching downwards and inwards from the inner edge of the radius to the outer of the ulua, intersected by a few others which take a contrary direction. It is deficient both above and below for the passage of the interosseous vessels and nerves, while it aiFords attachment by its anterior surface to the flexor profundus and pollicis, -and by its posterior to the ex- tensors of the thumb. This ligament, like the preced- ing, is relaxed in pronation, and rendered tense by supination. Inferior Radio-ulnar Ligaments.—These consist of a series of weak fibres, extending nearly transversely across from the anterior and posterior surfaces of the ulna to the corresponding ones of the radius. They are lax, to allow of the necessary degree of mobility in the articulation, and are concealed by the flexor tendons in front, and the extensor behind. Interarticular Fibro-cartilage.—This is trian- gular in shape, very thick at its apex and margins, but thin at its base and in its centre. Internally it is at- tached by its point to the depression between the head and styloid process of the ulna, and passing beneath the former it is inserted by its base into the internal mar- gin of the articular groove on the inner side of the ra-205 CARPAL ARTICULATION. dius. It accordingly not only forms a bond of union between the bones of the fore-arm, but likewise assists in completing the cavity for the reception of the bones of the carpus. Synovial Membrane.—This is peculiar to this arti- culation, but from the manner in which it is invested by fibrous tissue, and prolonged upwards between the radius and ulna, it has received the designation of a ligament, being termed the sacciform. It is attached internally to the styloid process of the ulna, and ex- ternally to the articular surface of the radius. Motions.—Kotatory, or pronation, and supination. Pronation.—This motion is much more extensive than supination, and can be carried so far that the ra- dius may lie across the ulna at a very oblique angle, the curvature in the former bone adding materially to its freedom of mobility in this direction. In this move- ment the ulna is invariably fixed, the head of the ra- dius rotates in the lesser sigmoid notch, and is protruded backwards, while its inferior extremity glides forwards on the rounded head of the ulna, performing in fact a motion of semicircumduction, Avhich is only limited by the assistance of the anterior and posterior ligaments, which connect the bones below,—the interrosseous and oblique being in a state of complete relaxation. In supination, on the contrary, exactly the reverse takes place, the head of the radius advancing forwards, its inferior extremity protruding backwards, but neither to the same extent as is observed in the preceding, for here both the interrosseous and oblique ligaments be- come decidedly tense, and allow the motion of supi- nation to be carried only to a certain point. Force suddenly applied to the hand, in either forced prona- tion or supination, is very liable to produce displace- ment of the head of the radius either backwards or forwards, the former being more likely to occur, ana- tomically considered. ARTICULATION OF THE WRIST. This is an arthrodial joint; or, according to some, a condylar throsis. A cavity is formed above by the ra-THE ANATOMY OF THE JOINTS. 206 dius and triangular fibre-cartilage, which receives a convexity below, composed of the scaphoid, lunar, and cuneiform bones. The styloid processes of the radius and ulna bound it internally and externally. Its secu- rity is insured by an internal, external, anterior, and a posterior ligament. ExTEUNAL Lateral.—This is exceedingly strong. It takes its origin narrow from the point of the styloid process of the radius, and passes doAvnwards, gradually increasing in breadth, to be inserted into the outer side of the scaphoid bone, and sometimes by a prolonga- tion into the trapezium. Internal Lateral.—This is weaker than the pre- ceding, and consists usually of two fasciculi, both of which are attached above to the point of the styloid process of the ulna, from which they descend to be in- serted into the pisiform and cuneiform bones. Both slips are occasionally completely blended together. Anterior and Posterior Ligaments..—These are broad but thin, weak and lax, especially the latter. They take their origin from the anterior and posterior edges of the radius, and pass downwards and inwards, and are inserted into the corresponding surfaces of the first row of carpal bones, except the pisiform. There are two distinct processes of the anterior, which are implanted into the semilunar bone by a single attach- ment, though they are bifid Avhere they spring from the radius. A similar arrangement is visible with re- spect to the posterior, but it is not so obvious. The division between the two portions is visible at the ra- dius as well as at the cuneiform and semilunar bones, into which they are inserted. This articulation, like the ankle-joint, is provided with annular ligaments, to confine the several tendons, which play around, in their position. They consist of two, an anterior, which is short, thick, and exceed- ingly strong, stretching between the scaphoid and trape- zium externally, and the unciform and pisiform inter- nally, continuous with the fascia of the arm superiorly, and with the palmar aponeurosis inferiorly; and a pos- terior, much thinner and weaker, but longer, extending from the styloid process of the radius externally toCARPAL ARTICULATION. 207 the styloid process of the ulna and pisiform bone inter- nally ; continuous above and below with the fascia of the fore-arm and back of the hand. Their processes, prolonged from the deep surface of the latter to the bones beneath, form a series of distinct channels, lined by a synovial bursa, for the passage of the several ten- dons. These channels are six in number on the back of the hand; the four externally are in the radius; the fifth between that bone and the ulna; and the sixth in the ulna itself. In the first of these, commencing from the outside, are the tendons of the extensor ossis metacarpi and primi internodii pollicis; in the second, the two ra- dial extensors; in the third, the extensor secundi inter- nodii pollicis; in the fourth, the extensor communis and indicis; in the fifth, extensor minimi digiti; and in the sixth, the ulnar extensor. Beneath the anterior ligament there are three grooves: the most internal for the flexor communis and profundus; the middle, for the flexor pollicis longus; and the most external, for the flexor carpi radialis. It is crossed by the palmaris longus and flexor carpi ulnaris, the superficialis volse and ulnar arteries, and ulnar and superficial palmar nerves. Motions.—Flexion, extension, abduction, adduc- tion, and circumduction. In the two first of these motions the hand can be brought nearly to a right angle with the fore-arm, and is limited by the ten- sion of the ligaments before and behind, and the ten- dons which cover them. The range of abduction is very trifling, from the styloid process of the radius and scaphoid coming in contact almost immediately; but adduction is less circumscribed, from the interval which naturally exists between the lower part of the ulna and its corresponding carpal bone. Circumduc- tion is nothing more than a rapid alternation from one to the other of those motions thus described. CARPAL ARTICULATION. This is constituted by the eight bones of the carpus, forming a series of articulations one with the other; and as nature has arranged them in two rows we will208 THE ANATOMY OF THE JOINTS. adopt the same plan, by first explaining the connexion between the two tiers, and then describing the union between tier and tier. The first row of carpal bones are in contact with each other by extremely small facettes, but those of the se- cond are much larger. They are connected by anterior, posterior, and interrosseous ligaments. The two first of these are narrow slips, extending from bone to bone in front and behind, the anterior being much the stronger; the interrosseous are thick but short bundles, stretching between the non-articular adjacent surfaces, possessed of extreme strength, and quite sufficient of themselves to insure the integrity of the whole. The pisiform bone is, however, an exception to the rule; it is isolated, and forms a distinct joint with the cunei- form, to which it is united by an imperfect capsular ligament, extending downwards to the unciform and base of the fifth metatarsal bone below. Generally speaking, it has a separate synovial capsule, but it is sometimes continuous with the radio-carpal. The two rows of bones connected together, as just described, are again united to each other in the follow- ing manner: The prominent head of the os magnum is received into a socket formed by the scaphoid and semilunar, while internally the cuneiform dips down to articulate with the unciform, and externally the sca- phoid is prolonged in the same direction to meet the trapezium and trapezoid. The os magnum is retained in its position by a strong anterior ligament and a weaker posterior; the former is always well marked, and consists of a vertical set of fibres, which arise by a single process from the neck of the os magnum and pass upwards, diverging to be inserted by three slips into the anterior surfaces of the scaphoid, semilunar, and cunei- form; these are crossed by a series of transverse fibres, extending between the unciform bone on the inside and the trapezoid on the outside. The posterior ligament is not so well marked; its fibres decussate each other over the posterior part of the head of the os magnum, dipping down to be attached to its neck, and terminat- ing by being inserted into the adjacent bones of the first row. The union of the scaphoid with the trape-CARPO-METACARPAL ARTICULATION. 209 zium and trapezoid is completed by anterior and poste- rior ligaments, consisting of two slips before and be- hind, stretching from the bone above to the two below, the posterior being much the thinner and weaker. In addition to the ligaments just described as connecting the preceding bones, the cuneiform and unciform have an internal lateral, which is rounded and strong. Synovial Membrane.—This forms one large sac com- mon to all the articulations. carpo-metacarpal articulation. The first metacarpal bone, or that of the thumb, articulates with one bone only,—the trapezium,—the surfaces of both being alternately concave and convex, forming a joint by mutual reception; it has only one ligament,—a capsular, which is loose, very strong pos- teriorly, but weaker and thinner in all other directions; it consists merely of a series of fibres stretched between the contiguous margins of the bones composing the joint, and has a separate synovial membrane; its mo- tions are very extensive, having them all exceedingly well marked, except rotation. Second Metacarpal This articulates with three carpal bones,—the trapezium, the trapezoid, and the OS magnum; its ligaments are the dorsal and plantar; the first consists of three,—an external, from the trape- zium ; a middle, from the trapezoid; and an internal, from the os magnum; they are all inserted into the pos- terior surface of the metacarpal bone; the palmar is thin and weak, and extends from the trapezoid to the anterior face of the metacarpal bone. Third Metacarpal This is united to one carpal bone only,—the os magnum; it is connected by two dorsal and three palmar ligaments; the first arise from the os magnum and unciform, and pass forwards, con- verging towards each other, to be inserted into the pos- terior surface of the metacarpal bone; the palmar take their origin from the trapezium externally, the os mag- num in the centre, and the unciform internally,—con- verge, and are implanted into the anterior face of the metacarpal bone.210 THE ANATOMY OF THE JOINTS. Fourth Metacarpal.—This articulates with the os magnum and unciform, but it has only one dorsal and one palmar ligament, which spring from the anterior and posterior aspects of the bones alluded to, and stretch to the corresponding surfaces of the head of the meta- carpal bone. Fifth Metacarpal.—This is united to the unciform bone only, and has three ligaments for its security,— an anterior, a posterior, and an internal; they pass from one bone to another, and firmly connect them. Synovial Membrane.—There are three distinct pro- cesses for the carpo-metacapal articulation; the first has been already alluded to as being peculiar to the thumb, but the second and third, which are prolongations from that of the carpus, are supplied, the former to the second and third metacarpal bones, and the latter to the fourth and fifth. UNION OF THE METACARPAL BONES WITH EACH OTHER. These are united both at their carpal and digital ex- tremities ; in the first instance they present small late- ral facettes, whicb are in contact with each other, and are secured by dorsal, palmar, and interosseous liga- ments ; of these the two first consist of thick fasciculi of fibres, stretching from the head of one metacarpal bone to that of the next, the palmar being much the stronger; the interosseous occupy the intervals between the fa- cettes, and are possessed of very great strength. The. digital extremities do not, strictly speaking, ar- ticulate with each other, but a small synovial sac is interposed between each, to facilitate their motions; they are united together hj a loose transverse ligament, which stretches between them on their anterior surface, and thus prevents their divarication; this band of fibres does not, however, include the metacarpal bone of the thumb.211 PHALANGEAL ARTICULATIONS. UNION OF THE METACARPAL BONES WITH THE PHALANGES. These are a series of condyloid joints, formed by the union of the heads of the metacarpal bones, which are comparatively large, with the smaller cups presented by the extremities of the first phalanges; their media of connexion are an anterior and a posterior, an inter- nal and external lateral ligament. Anterior Ligament.—This is dense and strong, attached above to the constricted neck of the metacar- pal bone, and below to the under surface of the cor- responding phalanx, it is also continuous by a thin aponeurosis with the lateral ligaments; it is grooved, and supported anteriorly by the flexor tendons, while it is concave posteriorly, for the reception of the ends of the adjacent bones. Posterior Ligament. — This is thin, occasionally scarcely capable of demonstration; it merely passes from the upper surface of one bone to the other, and is covered by the extensor tendons. External and Internal Lateral Ligaments— These are thick, strong slips, pointed posteriorly, where they are attached to the tubercles on the sides of the metacarpal bone, broader but thinner anteriorly, at their insertion into the tubercles, on the lateral surfaces of the first phalanx; their direction is forwards and down- wards, and their margins are blended with the dorsal and palmar ligaments; two sesamoid bones are found in this articulation of the thumb, into which the ten- dons of its small muscles are inserted. Synovial Membrane.—This is very lax, especially posteriorly, where it is required to be folded out in motions of flexion. phalangeal articulations. These, like the preceding, are condyloid, and have precisely similar ligaments; it would, therefore, be a needless repetition to reiterate them. The hand, constituted in the manner just described,THE ANATOMY OF THE JOINTS. 212 is essentially an organ of prehension; its basis or foun- dation,—the carpus, is remarkable for its strength, de- pending as well on the manner in which its bones are accurately dovetailed together, as on the number of its ligaments; the union between it and the metacarpus permits but very limited motion, except in the instance of the thumb, where great mobility is requisite, as it is the organ which is essentially destined to oppose the prehensile functions of all the other fingers; in the me- chanism of the latter we have combined great delicacy of touch with vast strength, and the power of those hinge- joints can be regulated by the will, which can increase or diminish it, according to the degree of exertion required. TEMPORO-MAXILLARY ARTICULATION. This is formed by the condyle of the inferior maxil- lary bone being fitted or received into the glenoid cavity of the temporal; the articulation is condyloid, and it has for its security an external and an internal, a capsular ligament, and an interarticular fibro-cartilage. External Lateral.—This is a short thick ligament, arising from the tubercle at the bifurcation of the zygo- matic arch; it passes downwards and backwards, and is inserted into the outer side of the neck of the lower jaw; it rests by its deep surface on the joint, while superficially it is covered in by the skin and fascia. Internal Lateral.—This is long, thin, and weak; it is attached above to the spine of the sphenoid bone, and be- low to the lip or spur forming the inner edge of the dental foramen, sending a prolongation downwards and for- wards over the my lo-hyoid nerve, which becomes continu- ous with the periosteum; externally it is in relation with the internal maxillary, dental, and middle meningeal ar- teries, gustatory, dental, temporo-auricular and Vidian nerves, with a thin process of the parotid gland,—all which separate it from the vertical ramus of the inferior maxilla; its internal surface corresponds to the internal pterygoid below, and to the levator palati and Eustachian tube above. Great variations of opinion exist as to the use of this ligament; it cannot, as it is commonly said, be of any benefit in protecting the vessels and nervesTEMPORO-MAXILLARY ARTICULATION. 213 from being compressed against the jaw by the action of the internal pterygoid, as it is too weak and too lax to accomplish such an object against the contraction of such a powerful muscle; neither can it be supposed to be placed there solely to conduct the middle meningeal artery to its destination, but in foetal existence, where the jaw consisted of two distinct pieces, it with the ex- ternal might have formed a species of sling for its sup- port, and preserved the condyle in proper contiguity with the glenoid cavity. Capsular Ligament.—This is barrel-shaped and loose, in order to permit free motion of the jaw; it is attached above, anteriorly to the transverse root of the zygoma; externally to its horizontal; posteriorly to the Glaserian fissure, and internally to the roots of the spinous and styloid processes of the sphenoid bone; below it encir- cles the neck of the jaw, which it tensely embraces; its degree of strength is very variable,—thus it is found to be very strong and dense anteriorly and externally, but internally and posteriorly it is weaker and thinner; it is perforated in front and on its inner side by the ex- ternal pterygoid, as it passes to its insertion into the interarticular fibro-cartilage. Interartjcular Fibro-cartilage This is oval in shape, thick at the edges, but extremely thin, often per- forated in the centre; its upper surface is concavo-con- vex,—concave anteriorly, where it rests on the trans- verse root of the zygoma; convex posteriorly, where it corresponds to and fills up the glenoid cavity; its infe- rior surface is deeply concave, and moulded on the up- per part of the condyle, to which it is closely united by the reflection of the inferior sac of the synovial mem- brane, strengthened by a little scattered fibrous tissue; this, as well as the attachment of the external pterygoid' muscle, insures its following the condyle in all its mo- tions, thus guarding against the displacement to which it would be so liable from the action of the powerful muscles which are connected to it. Synovial Membrane. — This, generally speaking, consists of two distinct processes, separated from each other by the cartilage; the superior is remarkable for its laxity, the inferior for its tensity; they occasionally communicate through the foramen in the cartilage.THE ANATOMY OF THE JOINTS. 214 Motions Downwards, upwards, gliding, and late- ral. In the first of these, which is eiFected by the con- traction of the muscles attached from the os hyoides, the condyle, with the interarticular cartilage, glides for- wards on the transverse root of the zygoma, and, if the motion is carried too far, may slip anterior to it, but the occurrence of this accident is usually prevented hj the extreme tense condition in which the masseter, in- ternal pterygoid, and posterior fibres of the temporal are placed; the external lateral ligament and anterior part of the capsular are likewise on the stretch, and so pre- vent it; the upward motion, which is accomplished by the muscles of mastication, is limited effectually by its contact with the upper jaw; here the condyle and car- tilage, favoured by the natural inclination, pass back- war°ds into the glenoid cavity, and press against the posterior part of the capsule; in this condition the gliding motion forwards and backwards is most appa- rent,—the first being effected by the contraction of the external pterygoid and anterior fibres of the masseter, while it is restored again to its normal position by the posterior fibres of the latter muscle, aided by the same portion of the temporal. In the lateral motion, the con- dyle of one side advances on the transverse root of the zy- goma, whilst the other presses against the capsule poste- riorly; it is accomplished principally by the external pterygoid of the corresponding side being called into action, while the other remains quiescent. We may here cursorily allude to the stylo-maxillary and inter-maxillary ligaments. The former is merely a process of the deep cervical fascia, stretchmg between the upper and outer edge of the styloid process of the temporal bone and the angle of the lower jaw. It is •strono- and well defined, and serves in some measure to limit the lateral motion of the articulation. It lies between the parotid and submaxillary glands, and se- parates the facial from the external carotid artery. ^ Intermaxillary LiGAMENT.-This extends between the hamular process of the internal pterygoid plate, and the root of the coronoid process of the inferior maxilla. It is merely a strong aponeurosis, giving origin to the superior constrictor posteriorly, and the buccinator anteriorly.215 SECTION III. MUSCULAE SYSTEM. Muscles constitute the active agents of locomotion; they are stretched from bone to bone in the extremities which they surround, enveloping also cavities; pro- ducing the requisite change in the inclosed organs by their contractions, and again investing the hollow vis- cera, they urge their contents towards the natural outlets. A muscle is an aggregation of a peculiar fibrous ele- ment united by areolar tissue, and usually (at least in one class) presenting a tendon or an expanded aponeurosis at either extremity, by which it is connected to the bones. In their vital properties they exhibit contrac- tility and sensibility; the physical being, elasticity, re- sistance, and pliability; the colour may be red or pale; and in shape exhibiting an infinite variety, as, thick, round, or fusiform; flat and expanded; penniform; or bipenniform arrangement of their fibres. The nomen- clature is derived, first, from their position, as brachialis anticus; secondly, from direction, as, obliquus externus rectus, &c.; thirdly, from shape, as, rhomboideus, sca- lenus ; fourthly, from action, as, pronator teres, supi- nator longus; fifthly, from structure, as, digastric; and, lastly, from attachment, as, the sterno-hyoid and thyroid. The muscular system is divided into the animal, vo- luntary or striped, and the organic, involuntary or un- striped. The former is usually arranged in a thick, round mass, of a deep red colour; has tendon in its composition, with bony attachments placed external to the skeleton; voluntary in action, supplied by the cerebro-spinal system of nerves, and composed of fibres visibly striped in a transverse direction. The latter is thin and pale, surrounds internal viscera, destitute of tendon or bony attachment; involuntary, supplied byTHE MUSCULAE SYSTEM. 216 the sympathetic system of nerves and the fibre is un- striped, the contractions being slow and rhythmical. The heart, although an organic muscle, is red, thick, and strong, the fibres presenting a faint striation. In addition to these, a third class of muscles exists, which are of a mixed character, as, the diaphragm, sphinc- ters, and oesophagus. Structure of Muscle—It consists of fibres varying in size, and irregular in shape, but usually angular, each surrounded by a proper sheath,—sarcolemma. This fibre, when examined with a power of 450 dia- meters, presents a number of transverse, equidistant, dark lines or stripes, with fainter longitudinal markings, by no means constant or regular in their appearance. The spaces intervening between the stripes are longer than broad when the fibre is quiescent, but the reverse during contraction. If this fibre is torn transversely, a disc results, but if longitudinally, a fibrilla (Bowman). The fibrilla is remarkably fine, and, without branching, it consists of a series of cells, which at their opposed edges produce the strias (Sharpey, Carpenter); or of a number of particles opposed by their extremities, con- stitutino- sarcous elements, the animal contents being termed °sarcine (Bowman), or of fibriUae constituting the fibre (Fontana, Hassal). The organic muscular fibre is more simple; smaller than the voluntary; flattened, without transverse markings, and containing numerous nuclei imbedded in its tissue, indicative of the primary development from nucleated cells. Their diameter is from the l-2000th to the l-3000th of an inch. The tendons of muscles are composed of white fibrous tissue; the sarcolemma of the fibres being continuous with them, and each fibre terminating individually either m or on their extremities. Muscles are the active agents of the economy,—con- tractility, or the generation of power, being the inhe- rent attribute of the fibre,-the force of any given muscle being exactly in proportion to the quantity of fibres that it contains. The fibres m sustained action diminish one-third of their original length, but where a limited extent of motion is requisite, and where energy and power are also of importance, the fibres areTHE MUSCLES. ^17 augmented with diminished extent of action by a pen- niform arrangement, as in the rectus femoris. The causes assigned as the source of contraction are nu- merous. Volition is obviously the natural excitor of the action, and although the effects are visible, the immediate cause is exceedingly obscure. A muscle is observed during contraction to become shortened, thicker, harder, with an increase of temperature. A similar condition is easily excited in muscles laid bare and subjected to galvanism. The whole muscle is not thrown at once into contraction, but it radiates from the stimulated point, until it equally pervades the en- tire fibres. As to the immediate causes of contraction, Prevost and Dumas conceived that the nervous fila- ments were distributed to the fibres at angles, and that, being dissimilarly electric, they attracted each other, producing the zig-zag condition observed so frequently; but this appearance is merely the result of the short- ening of the neighbouring fibres. It has also been attributed to the sudden influx of a large quantity of blood into the vessels of the muscle; and the contrary opinion has likewise been sustained,—that the escape of the blood was the excitor of contraction. Haller conceived it to be a power inherent in the fibre; Skey, the shortening of a spiral cord that surrounded it. It has also been attributed to contraction of the transverse stripes, and to alteration in the sarcous elements; but these are wholly inadequate to account for this functional activity. In the voluntary muscles, the contractions are energetic, but of short duration; in the involuntary, on the contrary, they are less en- ergetic, but more prolonged. Muscles acting on bones represent levers. Of these, three orders exist: the first, with the power atone extremity, thcAveight at the opposite, and the fulcrum or fixed point occupying an intermediate position, as in the nodding motions of the head and extension of the fore-arm by the triceps muscle. The second order has the weight in the centre, the power at one extremity, and the fulcrum or fixed point at the opposite; the action of the gastrocnemius during progression is an example of this class, which is the most powerful, and termed the crushing lever. The hTHE MUSCULAR SYSTEM. 218 third order has the fulcrum at one extremity, the weight at the opposite, and the power at any interme- diate point between them. It is generally found in the body, and by its adoption, rapidity of motion and sym- metry of form are obtained, but power is sacrificed. Certain mechanical circumstances tend to diminish the power of individual muscles,—as for instance, their in- sertions being at acute angles to the lever on which they act, the obliquity of direction, acting through a disadvantageous lever, and the passive contraction of opposite muscles. The masseter and gastrocnemii are from the mode of their insertion the most powerful in the body, the fibres forming right angles with the lever into which they are inserted. Muscles are highly orga- nized, the arteries running in the interfibrous spaces; the nerves are also numerous, and it may be stated as a general rule, that the greater the amount of vascular and nervous supply, the more energetic are the con- tractions of the muscle; and in certain pathological con- ditions, in which nutrition is diminished, as where the arteries are ossified, the contractions are feeble and weak. MUSCLES OF THE HEAD AND FACE. Raise the subject by a block placed beneath the shoulders, and support the head in an almost vertical condition. Several different modes of incision may be adopted with almost equal advantage, for the purpose of raising the integument. In making post-mortem ex- aminations, where it is an object to avoid disfiguring the features with blood, a transverse incision from ear to ear, and the subsequent reflection of the flaps, will be found most advantageous; but for anatomical pur- poses it will be preferable to run a circular incision around the scalp, in front, above the superciliary arches, laterally above the ear, and posteriorly above the occi- pital protuberance, when an antero-posterior incision will further facilitate the raising of the integument. This should be accomplished cautiously, commencing before, as it adheres loosely to the muscular fibres, but strictly to the subjacent tendon. Having raised it, ex- amine the several constituents which compose it. The219 MUSCLES OF THE HEAD. cuticle is thick and laminated, adhering intimately to the cutis, in consequence of the number of prolonga- tions sent into the hair-follicles, which accounts for the difficulty experienced in producing vesications on the scalp. The cutis is dense, and the fibrous arrangement of this structure can be well observed in the section. The hair-bulbs variegate the surface, and tend to in- crease the density of the tissue. The deep aspect is rough, and attached to the subjacent muscle and ten- don by dense areolar tissue, which constrains the inte- gument to follow the fnuscle during its contractions. OcciPiTO-FRONTALis covers the anterior, middle, and posterior regions of the cranium,—thin and weak in some subjects, thick and well marked in others. It consists of two fleshy portions behind (occipital), and the same in front (frontal), with an intervening ten- dinous expansion (epicranial aponeurosis), and arises by short tendinous fibres from the two external thirds of the superior curved line on the occipital bone, also from the outer and back part of the mastoid process; the fleshy masses ascend on the occipital bone, converg- ing to be inserted into the posterior edge of the apo- neurosis ; the anterior fleshy portion is also double, but not so strong as the former; it arises from the anterior edge of the aponeurosis by a lunated border, passes for- wards over the frontal bone, and is inserted into the eyebrow, mixing with the fibres of the orbicularis pal- pebrarum, and internal to this, by a few fibres, into the internal angular process of the os frontis and levator labii superioris alaeque nasi; still more internally, into the aponeurosis of the compressores nasi, by two flat bands which descend on the dorsum of the nose, named pyramidales nasi. Epicranial Aponeurosis is a thin sheet of dense fi- brous tissue, wider behind than before, but narrower in the centre than at either extremity. Laterally, it is attached to the temporal ridges, where it sends a thin process over that fascia; anteriorly and posteriorly, the frontal and occipital fleshy bellies are respectively at- tached to it, while it sends down a process between the latter to be attached to the occipital protuberance; this occupies the space between their inner edges. The super-220 THE MUSCULAR SYSTEM. ficial surfece is attached to the integument by dense areolar tissue; the deep is free, and extremely moveable on the bone, being attached to the pericranium by fine lax areolar tissue. Relations. — It lies on the occipital, parietal, and frontal bones, on the dorsum of the nose; a thin layer also rests on the temporal fascia. It is covered by the integument and areolar tissue, and on it are seen the following nerves and vessels:—Anteriorly, supra-orbital artery and nerve, supratrochleator nerve, and frontal artery; laterally, the temporal artery and four nerves,— auricularis magnus, temporo-auricular, temporal branch of superior maxillary, and lastly, temporal branches of portio dura; posteriorly, the posterior auris artery and occipital, the posterior auricular nerve, the lesser occi- pital, and great occipital. Before proceeding further with the dissection, the stu- dent should carefully observe the position of the several nerves and vessels exposed and enumerated. Supra-orbital Artery.—A branch of the ophthalmic arises within the orbit, passes through the supra-orbital notch in company with the frontal nerve, turns upwards between the orbicularis and corrugator supercilii, co- vered by the former and occipito-frontalis. It sends branches outwards, to communicate with the anterior branch of the temporal, then divides into two—a super- ficial that pierces the orbicularis, then lies on the occi- pito-frontalis, merely covered by the integument which it supplies; the deep branch is not visible until the muscle is raised; it lies on the periosteum, which it principally supplies, but its termination is generally cutaneous. We often have seen the frontal artery sup- plying the place of this vessel. . Frontal Artery, also a branch of the ophthalmic, is seen emerging from the orbit above the pulley of the superior oblique, by raising the upper and inner por- tion of the orbicularis. Sometimes it is very large, and supplies the supra-orbitnl branches, but always small twigs are sent upwards to the occipito-frontalis and in- tegument. , , 1 • Frontal Nerve, a branch of the ophthalmic, escapes by the supra-orbital notch, divides into a superficial and221 t MUSCLES OF THE HEAD. deep branch; the former pierces the orbicularis, some- times passes between its edge and the occipito-i'rontalis, lies between the last-named muscle and the integu- ment, and can be traced as high as the coronal suture. The deep, larger than the last, external to which it lies, remains between the muscle and the bone, where it di- vides into a number of flat, ribbon-like branches that at the coronal suture pierce the muscle and terminate in the skin. SupRATRocHLEATOR Branch of the frontal escapes from the orbit, with the frontal artery, above the pul- ley of the superior oblique. Two or three long branches turn up, to supply the occipito-frontalis and integu- ment. Temporal Artery.—This arises from the external carotid in the substance of the parotid gland, then as- cends between the cartilage of the ear and the temporo- maxillary articulation, passes over the horizontal root of the zygoma, and one inch and a quarter above this it divides into anterior, middle, and posterior branches. The former passes forwards towards the brow, where it anastomoses with the supra-orbital; the middle pierces the temporal fascia; and the posterior ascends almost vertically as high as the summit of the cranium, where it divides into its terminating branches, communicating behind with the posterior auris. Temporo-auricular Nerve arises from the inferior maxillary; is seen emerging from the parotid superfi- cial to the artery, after sending backwards an auricular branch; it terminates in the integument of the side of the cranium. AuRicuLAins Magnus arises from the cervical plexus, and is seen in the present dissection sending upwards a branch anterior and superficial to the last-described nerve. _ Temporal Branch of the orbital division of the supe- rior maxillary nerve pierces the temporal aponeurosis about three-quarters of an inch above the zygoma, and the same distance from the posterior edge of the malar bone. Its distribution is tegumentary, having pre- viously communicated with the portia dura. Temporal Branches of the portio dura emerge from222 THE MUSCULAR SYSTEM. the anterior and superior edge of the parotid, and radi- ate on the temporal region as far forward as the orbicu- laris palpebrarum. Posterior Auricular Artery is seen emerging from the posterior and inferior part of the parotid, where it overlaps the sterno-mastoid muscle; it passes then ob- liquely upwards and backwards between the mastoid process and cartilage of the ear, sends a branch to anas- tomose with the occipital, and the larger or anterior ramifies on the cartilage of the ear. Occipital Artery, like the last described, arises from the external carotid. It is now only observed in its last stage. It pierces the trapezius an inch external to the middle line, and divides into two branches,—an external and internal,—which lie on the occipito-fron- talis, and supply that muscle and the integument. These branches are often exceedingly tortuous, so as in some cases to resemble the splenic artery. The Nerves seen in this region are,—nearest to the mesian line, the great occipital; midway between it and the mastoid process, the lesser occipital; and on that process, the posterior auricular. Great Occipital is the posterior branch of the se- cond cervical. It pierces the trapezius superficial to the artery, and on the occipito-frontalis divides into branches, which are lost in the integument and muscle. Posterior Auricular Nerve arises from the trunk of the portio dura, leaves the parotid at its back part, winds over the anterior and external part of the mas- toid process, sends one branch backward to the occipi- tal region; the other ascends to the retrahens aurem muscle and cartilage of the ear. Lesser Occipital Nerve, a branch of the cervical plexus, ascends at first at the posterior margin of the sterno-mastoid, lying on the splenius, then on the in- sertion of the former, and finally on the occipito-fron- talis, which it supplies with the integument. The veins of the scalp, as a general rule, correspond to the arteries, and accompany them in their divisions. They, with the foregoing, will be found minutely de- scribed, with the systems to which they belong. The Muscles of the external ear are seen by raising223 MUSCLES OF THE EAR. the fine integument which covers the auricle. They are large and well marked in the lower animals, but merely- rudimentary in man. The division into a common and proper set is that usually adopted,—the former being three, the latter five, in number. Common Muscles.—Attrahens aurem, attollens au- rem, retrahens aurem. Attrahens Aurem, weak and indistinct, arises from the temporal fascia and epicranial layer, passes back- wards, and is inserted into the descending portion of the helix. Relations.—It lies on the temporal fascia and vessels, and epicranial layer; it is covered by the inte- guments and superficial fascia. Action.—To draw for- ward the helix, and thus dilate the concha. Attollens Aurem, triangular, arises broad and ex- panded from the epicranial aponeurosis and temporal fascia, passes downwards,—the fibres converging to be inserted into the upper part of the concha. A branch of the lesser occipital nerve supplies it. Relations.—It lies on the temporal and epicranial aponeurosis, and is covered by the integuments; it is often united by its anterior margin with the attollens aurem. Action—To elevate the whole auricle, and dilate the concha. Retrahens Aurem, the strongest of the three mus- cles, arises double, sometimes by three portions, from the base of the mastoid process, passes forwards, and is inserted tendinous into the posterior part of the concha. Relations It lies on the bone and posterior auris ar- tery, and is covered by the skin; a branch of the pos- terior auricular nerve enters it. Action.—To retract the whole auricle, and assist the other muscles in dilat- ing the concha. The Proper Muscles of the ear are,—the helicis ma- jor and minor, the tragicus, antitragicus, and trans- verso-helicis. These are seen by removing the fine integument cautiously from the concave surface of the auricle. Helicis Major.—A flat, oval bundle of fibres, wide and fleshy in the centre, narrow and tendinous at each extremity; it lies immediately beneath the integument, on the superior and descending portion of the helix,THE MUSCULAR SYSTEM. 224 above the tragus. This band is usually about three- quarters of an inch in length. Helicis Minor.—A flat, tongue-shaped band, lying obliquely on that part of the helix within the concha. This will draw inwards the helix, and thus, by acting with the last-mentioned, deepen the concha. Tragicus A flat, diamond-shaped band, sometimes wanting; lies on the cutaneous surface of the tragus ■without any other attachment. Antitragicus.—Caudate in shape; arises from the cutaneous aspect of the antitragus, passes upwards and backwards, and is inserted tendinous into the com- mencement of the concha. Transverse Helicis.—A semicircular set of trans- verse fibres, lying on the mastoid surface of the auricle, passing from the concha to the helix. These certainly are not muscular, but are highly elastic. Before proceeding to the dissection of the face, intro- duce a piece of tow into the anterior nares, also place a portion between the cheek and teeth, so as to render the structures tense in this situation. It is preferable to dissect the eyelids without any such preparation, as their margins require at all times to be free, for the proper examination of the appendages of the organ of vision. The cranium being raised to a convenient posi- tion, make an incision from the middle line of the fron- tal bone along the dorsum of the nose, upper and lower lips, to the chin. Carry a second, at first backwards, then upwards, along the rami of the lower jaw; now reflect the integument carefully forwards until the lids are reached; then dissect from above, to expose the up- per and from without and below for the lower lid, cutting away the attachments altogether at the margins of the cliiasma oculi. It will also be easier to remove the skin from the dorsum of the nose from within out- wards. This is most difficult to accomplish on the alaj, owing to its intimate adhesion to the cartilages that bound the anterior nares. The skin is thin on the fore-,MUSCLES OF THE FACE. 225 head, but thick on the eyebrow, again thin and fine on the eyelids, thicker over the masseter, particularly in the male, but becoming fine and delicate on the cheek. Over the superior and inferior labial region its struc- ture is dense in the male, in consequence of the num- ber of hair bulbs, but their absence in the female ac- counts for the extreme fineness usually observed, at least before the middle periods of life. Beneath the skin, a layer of soft adeps surrounds and connects the muscles, nerves, and vessels of the face. This is prin- cipally seen on the cheeks and superior and inferior labial regions, but on the forehead it is scarcely pre- sent, absent altogether in the lids, and nearly so on the dorsum of the nose. This must be all carefully re- moved before the deeper structures can be examined with advantage. The muscles of the face in many subjects are weak, pale, and indistinct, particularly so in the aged, so that in many cases it requires an experienced dissector to exhibit them. They have been divided into superficial, or the muscles of expression; and deep, or muscles of mastication,—the former consisting of thirteen pairs and a single muscle, the latter of five pairs, which are perfectly symmetrical.

It arises from the upper and lower margins of the tendo oculi, from the internal angular process of the os frontis, and nasal process of the superior maxillary bone; the fibres pass in semicurves outwards, meeting at the external can- thus; the inferior segment has likewise an origin by short fibres from the orbital edge of the superior maxil- lary and malar bones. Structure and Relations.—It is divided into three portions,—the orbital, palpebral, and ciliary, forming concentric curves from without inwards. The orbital fibres are thick, strong, and red, like other animal muscles; the palpebral are thin, pale, and weak, with the physical aspect of the organic sheets of muscular fibre; the ciliary constitute a thin fasciculus at the margin of either lid, decussating at their commissures; these are also pale, very much resembling the tissue of the longitudinal bands of the large intestine. Its rela- tions will now be considered. Above, it lies on the corrugator supercilii, supra-orbital nerve, and artery bone, superior palpebral ligament, and tarsal cartilage; and also on the superior tarsal arch of nerves and arte- ries ; inferiorly, it lies on the bone, the outer head of the levator labii superioris alajque nasi, which sepa- rates it from the infra-orbital nerve and artery, on the origin of the great zygomatic and subcutaneous malse nerve, inferior palpebral ligament, tarsal cartilage, tar- sal branch of the superior maxillary nerve, and palpe- bral artery; internally, on the nasal process of the superior maxillary bone, tendo oculi, lachrymal sac, supra and infratrochlear nerves, frontal and nasal branches of ophthalmic, and corresponds by its inner margin to the pyramidalis nasi, and outer head of the levator labii superioris alosque nasi ; externally, it lies on the temporal fascia and malar bone, and also on the orbital branch of the superior maxillary nerve, as it pierces the temporal fascia. In addition, the superior marain of the muscle is united to the occipito-frontalis; the lower part receives the highest fibres of the platys-MUSCLES OP THE FACE. 227 ma. It is covered by the skin, areolar tissue, and pal- pebral branches of the portio dura. Action.—To close the lids, principally by depressing the upper; also to compress the lachrymal sac by acting on the tendo oculi, and thus forcing the tears into the nasal duct, and from thence into the nose, when it is fully contracted. The further tension of the ciliary fibres will turn the internal sixth of the tarsal cartilage inwards, as it is here unsupported, and by this action immerse the punc- tal orifices in the lake of tears at the inner canthus. When the eyes are closed firmly by a voluntary move- ment, the orbital fibres are the principal agents, being quickly obedient to the will; but in those involuntary movements which are continually occurring, the palpe- bral set are the sole agents. Even during sleep, we have frequently seen the superior lid in rapid motion, but without the orbital fibres at all participating in the action. These involuntary movements in some indivi- duals are so frequent and regular, that they might be classed with true rhythmical contractions. Under the microscope, the fibres of the palpebral portion exhibit but faint strias, which entirely disappear under the action of acetic acid, forming a marked contrast to the orbital in this respect. We are disposed to look on the former as exhibiting one of the connecting links be- tween the voluntary and involuntary system of muscles. In old persons the palpebral portions frequently pre- sent marked deficiencies between the fibres, accounting for the diminished energy of the movements of the eye- lids at that period of life. Now turn downwards the superior portion of the last muscle, and expose the corrugator supercilii. CoRRUGATOR SuPERCiLii arises narrow and tendinous from the internal angular process of the os frontis, passes obliquely upwards and outwards, and is inserted into the deep surface of the orbicularis, and the integu- ments of the eyebrow. Relations.—It is covered by the orbicularis, frontal nerve, and supra-orbital artery: it lies on the bone. Action.—To throw the forehead into vertical wrin- kles, to depress the brows, and to erect the hairs,— thus defending the eye from intense light. Sometimes228 THE MUSCULAR SYSTEM. this muscle is so intimately connected with the orbicu- laris that it appears as an additional origin of it, which accounts for the concerted action that so frequently exists between them. Tensor Tarsi (Horner's muscle) is dissected by di- viding vertically the upper and lower lid, and reflecting the internal flaps towards the nose; the conjunctiva should then be raised and the areolar tissue removed; it arises from the crest on the os unguis, behind the lachrymal groove, passes forwards and outwards, divides into two slips, which are inserted into the lachrymal ducts, being prolonged as far as the puncta. Relatiom It corresponds anteriorly and internally to the lachrymal sac and tendo oculi; externally and posteriorly, to the conjunctiva and areolar tissue. It is conceived by many authorities to be merely a deep origin of the orbicularis palpebrarum, but it appears to be a distinct muscle, and is always present, at least, we have never observed its absence. Action.—To compress the lachrymal sac; also, it may draw the puncta backwards, placing them in a favour- able position to receive the tears. As it is the natural course to examine the lachrymal apparatus in this stage of the dissection, we prefer to sacrifice arrangement to convenience. The portion of the appendages of the eye which can now be examined with advantage are the eyelids, brows, the lachrymal sac, and nasal duct; this may be done on the opposite side, which is still untouched. The Eyelids are two pendulous curtains, which cover, when closed, the anterior surface of the globe, but in their ordinary condition are separated by an elliptical space, of varying magnitude in different indi- viduals; those curtains are of unequal size, the superior being three times as large as the inferior, which rarely extends above the margin of the cornea; the superior is bounded above by an arch of hairs, directed obliquely outwards, sometimes meeting across the dorsum of the nose, but generally a space intervenes where they are deficient; the integument in which they are set is thick and strong, and this is again supported by the orbicu- laris and corrugator supercilii muscles, from which it is229 LACHRYMAL APPARATUS. separated by a qvianlity of fatty tissue; by their erec- tion, combined with depression of the brows, the organ of vision is shielded from intense light; and also they direct the perspiration downwards and outwards, that might otherwise reach the eyes, in addition conducing to the symmetry of the brow. The structures forming the lids, from superficial to deep, are, the skin, areolar tissue, orbicularis, tarsal car- tilage, palpebral ligaments, expansion of the levator palpebra3, and conjunctiva,—the levator being absent in the lower lid; the skin is fine, thin, and smooth, but not very sensitive, transversely rugated both on the upper and lower lids; internally and externally it pre- sents a sulcus parallel with the chiasma; at the margins it becomes continuous with the conjunctiva,—a transi- tion almost imperceptible; the areolar tissue beneath the skin is lax and reticular, permitting with facility the occurrence of serous efi'usion, but at the margins it is dense, so that the skin is very adherent in this situa- tion, but in no single point does it ever present the cha- racter of a fascial covering, accounting in some degree for the separation of the muscular fibres before alluded to. The muscular layer has already been fully described, and on removing it, the palpebral ligaments and tarsal cartilages are seen on the same plane; the fibro-carti- lages, called tarsal, are two, one for each lid,—that for the upper being much the larger and best marked; it is semilunar in figure, presenting two surfaces, two edges, and two cornua; the superficial aspect is covered by the orbicularis and is convex; the deep or concave surface corresponding to the globe of the eye is lined by the conjunctiva and the expansion of the levator palpebrse superioris. A number of vertical but irregular grooves mark the situations of the Meibomian glands; the superior margin is thin, and receives the attachment of the levator palpebras and palpebral ligament; the inferior or ciliary edge is thick, and bevilled in such a direction that when the lids are closed, a triangular canal results, two of its sides being formed by the car- tilages, and the base by the globe of the eye; it has been asserted that this only occurs after death, when the globe has collapsed, but observation proves this I230 THE MUSCULAR SYSTEM. idea to be more ingenious than correct; the orifices of the Meibomian follicles are also seen a little nearer the posterior margin than the anterior, and into the latter the cilias or eyelashes are implanted; of the two cornua the internal is most acute; it is fixed by a slip of the tendo oculi; the external is firmly attached to the cor- responding canthus by the external tendo oculi; the inferior tarsal cartilage is not more than two lines in depth, whilst the superior is in its deepest portion fully half-an-inch; sometimes it consists merely of the thick ciliary edge and no more; the superior is also a quarter of an inch wider than the inferior; but, with the excep- tion of the levator palpebra, their relations are similar. Palpebral Ligaments.—At the margin of the orbit the periosteum of that cavity becomes continuous with a similar structure from the external surface of the frontal bone, and also that of the malar and maxillary, passing upwards and downwards, to be attached to the orbital margins of the tarsal cartilages; it retains them loosely in their situations; at the internal canthus they are weak and thin where they become continuous with the tendon; externally they decussate, forming a thick round cord superficially; this may be termed the exter- nal tendo oculi; it is bifid internally, where it is attached to the cartilages, round externally, and firmly connected to the malar bone; the deep portion is here very broad, and appears to compensate for the excavation in the or- bital edge of that bone. The internal tendo oculi, about a quarter of an inch in length, consists of a superficial and deep portion; the former is thick and round inter- nally, where it is attached to the nasal process of the superior maxillary bone in front of the groove for the lachrymal sac; externally it becomes twisted and flat- tened, and divides into two well-marked slips, which are attached to either tarsal cartilage, covering the lachrymal cunals; the deep portion of this tendon is un- defined, thin but strong, adhering intimately to the edges of the groove for the sac, which it appears to protect from atmospheric pressure. The Eyelashes, or ciliaj, are strong, stiff hairs, forming a double, and sometimes treble, row in the anterior margin of each lid; those in the superior being moreLACHRYMAL APPARATUS. 231 numerous and stronger than those of the lower; they are curved, so that their convexities look towards each other, and meet before the eyelids are accurately closed: they are deficient at the internal sixth of the lid, on account of the inversion which this portion undergoes during the action of the orbicularis muscle; their use is to break up the rays of light, and thus defend the eye, also to entangle, like a net, any foreign bodies that may suddenly approach the globe. Conjunctiva In order to form a correct idea of this structure, divide by a transverse incision the ex- ternal canthus, and reflect the lids. It belongs to the class of mucous membranes, and is divided into the pal- pebral and ocular portions. Eble arranges it into the dermoid, mucous, and serous portions,—that which lines the lids being a continuation of the dermis; that part intermediate between the lid and the globe he considers mucous, and the corneal covering serous, in structure. Commencing at the margin of the lower eyelid, where it is continuous with the skin, it passes into the Meibo- mian follicles, and also into the puncta; then lines the posterior surface of the lower lid, is reflected from it on the fibrous ocular fascia and sclerotic; then passes up- wards over the cornea, internally forming the plica semilunaris and caruncula; from the superior portion of the globe it is reflected forwards on the upper lid, forming in the angle of reflection the superior palpebral sinus, from which it is reflected into the ducts of the lachrymal gland, then descending at the margin of the lid, it again passes into the superior set of Meibomian glands and puncta, and terminates by continuity with the integument. The conjunctiva of the lids is thick, vascular, villous, covered by squamous and ciliated epithelium, and but loosely adherent to the subjacent parts; in the superior palpebral sinus it is thinner and less vascular, and exceedingly loose; at the outer side it has similar structural characters, forming in this situation a deep sinus, like the superior palpebral, for the purpose of allowing the rolling of the globe down- wards and inwards, according to the usual view, but really to permit the motion in a contrary direction, or upwards and outwards; at the inner canthus the semi-232 THE MUSCULAR SYSTEM. lunar fold is placed with its concavity directed out- wards ; it is the rudiment of the third eyelid in the pre- daceous birds. In some persons, and particularly those who have resided in warm climates, this fold is large, lax, and protrudes between the lids when they are opposed. At the internal extremity of the last, the caruncula lachrymalis forms a projecting pea-shaped tubercle; it consists of a congeries of mucous follicles, surrounded by conjunctiva, small in the child, but gradually increasing with age, and sometimes project- ing between the lids, also developing short hairs from its surfaces. Several uses are ascribed to it,—namely, to act as a barrier to prevent the escape of tears from the triangular depression at the internal canthus (lacus lachrymarum); likewise to prevent the accurate approxi- mation of the punctal portion of the lids, and allow the tears to enter those openings; or to oppose the too great inversion of the lids; and lastly, to secrete an additional quantity of mucus, to defend the reservoir from the saline and irritating tears. The sclerotic portion is pale, but thick, the closeness of its adhesion increasing as the cornea is approached; on the cornea the epithelium is still present, but the anterior elastic cornea constitutes the basement membrane; this structure is thin and perfectly transparent, in all other respects being similar to a mucous membrane. In the superior and external part of the upper palpebral sinus, from twelve to six- teen small openings are with difficulty seen, forming a semi-ellipse, occasionally appearing as dark points (Zinn); these are the openings of the ducts of the lachrymal gland, from which the tears are eflfused on the free surface of the globe; they are brought more fully into view by rubbing the conjunctiva corresponding to their open- ings with any coloured fluid, as ink or white paint. Meibomian Follicles.—At the junction of the edge with the posterior surface of the lids, a number of small openings are now visible, from forty to fifty in the upper, and about thirty in the lower; they lie be- tween the conjunctiva and the tarsal cartilages, which they groove. Each follicle, commencing at the orifice, consists of a single tube; this bifurcates and some- times communicates with a similar division on each233 LACHRYMAL APPARATUS. side; the terminations near the orbital margin of the cartilage may also be coecal; this arrangement is the most frequent. From the sides smaller tubes pass off, that also subdivide, and ultimately terminate in grape- like bunches of coecal extremities; these secrete a resi- nous fluid, that prevents the escape of the lachrymal se- cretion over the edges of the lids; small, straight, but in diseased conditions, tortuous vessels are seen running to- wards the base of each follicle, from which small branches are continued to the orifice, where a circular anasto- mosis is formed; in scrofulous children, where the lids are thin, these follicles may be often observed through the skin and tarsal cartilage; at the internal sixth of the lid the orifices no longer appear visible, and at this point are situated the puncta lachrymalia,—two in num- ber, one above and one below, represented by annular projections, with a foramen in the centre, looking back- wards; these are certainly in the substance of the tar- sal cartilage. Now introduce a pin curved, with its con- cavity directed upwards, into the inferior punctum; press it inwards towards the nasal process of the supe- rior maxillary bone; this will show the direction of the lachrymal canals, which are two in number, and lead from the punctal orifices to the outer side of the lachry- mal sac; each canal is curved, the concavities turned towards each other, and consists of a tubule of mucous membrane, surrounded by a sheath from the reflected layer of the tendo oculi. We have observed that they as frequently open into the sac distinctly as by a com- mon orifice; they are related posteriorly to Horner's muscle and conjunctiva, anteriorly to the tendo oculi and orbicularis muscle. Raise the tendo oculi from its attachment to the superior maxillary bone, and reflect it outwards. Obtain a dry skull for the examination of the lachrymal sulcus, which will assist the student in acquiring a correct idea of the relations of the most important of the appendages of the eye. Lachrymal Sac.—Oval, about three-quarters of an inch in length, consists of two portions,—the osseous sulcus, in which it is lodged, and the membranous saccule. Osseous portion, a semi-ovoid depression formed by the grooved posterior edge of the superior maxil- lary and the anterior half of the lachrymal bone;THE MUSCULAR SYSTEM. 234 the anterior edge is curved, bounded by the tendo oculi, and sometimes by a projecting crest of bone, for its attachment; posteriorly the edge is straight and limited by the origin of Horner's muscle; below, its junction with the nasal duct is indicated by a spur of the superior maxillary, directed backwards; its superior termination is marked by the naso-frontal suture; the sulcus is deeper below than above, its greater depth in- feriorly resulting from the standing out of the maxillary bone; this projection is sometimes so great that a knife passed directly backwards will fall external to the sac, but the nearer to the lower edge of the tendon the more easily is the cavity reached, in consequence of the arrangement of the bony sulcus. Internal Attachment of the Tendo Ocull —Now that the lids have been divided, and one attachment of the tendon raised, and reflected outwards, it will be seen that this structure really consists of four por- tions, but still united with each other. One layer, thin but strong, is attached to the ridge of the os unguis; a second to the nasal process of the maxillary, bounding the sac above; this is continuous with the last by its posterior edge, and in front with the following,—the thick straight tendon which is attached to the superior maxillary above and before the sac; and the fourth por- tion is a continuation of the latter downwards, on the anterior edge of the lachrymal groove. About one- third of the sac is above the straight tendon, but some- times less, this variation not depending on the size of the latter, but rather on the point of attachment of the tendon itself to the bone. Now lay open the cavity; the mucous membrane lining it is reddish and soft, and adherent to the bone by a fibrous layer. Below, its junction with the nasal duct is marked by a circular fold; this is rarely complete, merely visible on the an- terior part, and depending on that osseous spur before alluded to in the description of the bony fi-amework. Now pass a probe into the nasal duct and dilate the an- terior nares, when its extremity will be seen projecting beneath the inferior spongy bone, about an inch from the anterior opening, thus indicating the passage by which the lachrymal secretion reaches the nose. The tears secreted by the lachrymal gland are poured out235 MUSCLES OF THE FACE. on the free surface of the globe by the ducts, collected in the chiasma by the action of the lids; the fluid passes towards the internal canthus, urged in that di- rection by the horizontal movement of the inferior lid, and also by gravitation, in consequence of the external canthus being on a plane superior to the internal. The orbicularis muscle or tensor tarsi compressing the sac, their sudden relaxation produces a tendency to a va- cuum within that cavity, and at the same moment,^ the puncta being immersed in the lake of tears, the fluid is forced into the sac by atmospheric pressure, and its de- scent through the nasal duct follows. Nerves and Vessels of the Lids—The lachrymal nerve sends a branch to the upper eyelid which commu- nicates with the supratrochleator branch of the frontal; the infra-orbital nerve, and infratrochleator form the inferior tarsal arch; while the portio dura sends a branch to the muscle, but not to any other structure. The Arteries are the superior and inferior palpebral branches of the ophthalmic, communicating in the upper lid with the frontal and supra-orbital, and in the lower ■with the infra-orbital. Raise the lower and internal portion of the orbicularis to exhibit the first of the nasal group of muscles. Levator Labii Superioris Al^eque Nasi.—A thin, narrow slip of fleshy fibres, arising from the nasal process of the superior maxillary bone; sometimes extending as far upwards as the frontal; it descends on the side of the nose, and is inserted by two slips, one into the dense skin of the ala of that organ, the second into the upper lip. Relations Above, it is overlapped by the orbicularis, but below it is pale and subcutaneous. It lies on the bone, the ala of the nose, and compressor nasi. Use.— To expand the nostril in forced inspiration, to express contempt, and raise the upper lip. Levator Labii Superioris (Proprius), arises broad and flat from the orbital margin of the superior maxil- lary bone, above the infra-orbital hole; the fibres pass downwards, converging, and are inserted into the upper lip and orbicularis oris. Relations.—It is covered by the orbicularis palpebra-THE MUSCULAR SYSTEM. 236 rum and facial nerve, and lies on the levator anguli oris, infra-orbital nerve, and vessels, facial artery, which afterwards emerges between its inner edge and the com- mon elevator. Action.—To elevate the upper lip. The two last mus- cles are sometimes described as a single mass. Pyramidalis Nasi.—A narrow slip, continued from the occipito-frontalis above, and inserted into the apo- neurosis of the compressores nasi. Relations—It lies on the dorsum of the nose, and the triangular cartilage, covered by the skin, to which it intimately adheres; it is separated from its fellow by a cellular interval, wider below than above. Use To raise the alas, also to draw down the skin at the inner part of the brow, assisting the corrugator supercilii in expressing anger. Compressor Nasi Seen by raising the levator labii; is triangular; arises narrow from the inner part of the canine fossa, passes forwards and inwards, becom- ing wider, and terminates in a thin aponeurosis, which is continuous on the dorsum of the nose with that of the opposite side. Relations.—It is covered by the levator labii, skin and lateralis nasi artery, and lies on the bone and alar carti- lage. Use—To compress the nostril if the alee are pro- jecting, but if concave, to dilate the opening. Depressor Labii Superioris Aljeciue Nasi.—To ex- pose this muscle let the upper lip be raised, and the mucous membrane dissected from the side of the frse- num; narrow at its origin, broad at the insertion, it arises from the myrtiform fossa above the incisor teeth of the upper jaw; the fibres radiate in a direction up- wards and outwards; the inferior are inserted into the orbicularis oris, the middle into the deep surface of the lip, and the superior into the alee nasi. Relations.—The upper margin corresponds to the compressor nasi, and it is covered by the orbicularis oris, levator labii superioris aleeque nasi, and mucous membrane, supported on the deep surface by the bone. This is so intimately connected with the orbicularis that it is often considered as a portion of that muscle. Those of opposite sides are separated by the frffinum,MUSCLES OF THE FACE. 237 and a small ascending branch of tlie united coronary, named the artery of the filtrum. Action.—To depress the upper lip and ala of the nose; the lower fibres may likewise elevate the lip. Now draw the angle of the mouth downwards and forwards, and thus make tense the following muscles:— Zygomaticus Major.—Arises fleshy and flat above the lower edge of the malar bone, becomes rounded, and passes obliquely downwards and forwards, and is inser- ted into the angle of the mouth. Relations It is covered by the orbicularis palpebra- rum, branches of the portio dura, with a quantity of fat, and lies on the bone, transverse facial artery, and vein, masseter, buccinator muscles, fat in which it is buried, and facial vein and artery. Zygomaticus Minor Sometimes wanting, arises from the upper part of the malar bone above and be- fore the major, passes downwards and forwards, and is inserted into the upper lip and orbicularis oris. Relations.—It lies on the bone, levator anguli oris, and facial vein, covered by the orbicularis palpebrarum and integument. This muscle is frequently united at its origin with the fibres of the orbicularis, and at its inser- tion with the levator labii superioris, of which it might be considered an additional origin. Action.—These muscles draw upwards and backwards the angle of the mouth and upper lip, as in tetanus. Raise the levator labii, together with the last muscles, and expose the following:— Levator Anguli Oris vel Musculus Caninus Arises thin from the canine fossa, external to the compres- sor nasi, passes downwards and a little backwards, and is inserted into the angle of the mouth, and the orbicularis oris, a slip being often continued downwards to the triangularis oris. Relations.—It is covered by the orbicularis palpe- brarum, levator labii superioris, the infra-orbital nerve and artery, which is interposed between them; it lies on the bone, buccinator, and mucous membrane. Some- times it is fasciculated at its origin, many of its fibres being then inserted into the integument. Action—To elevate the angle of the mouth, and thusTHE MUSCULAR SYSTEM. 238 deepen the tegumentary sulcus extending from the ala of the nose to the angle of the mouth; this is known as the abdominal angle, in consequence of its characteristic contour in disease of that cavity. Orbicularis Oris.—Surrounds the oral aperture, and consists of two semi-elliptical planes, united at the commissures; the fibres are of unequal thickness in dif- ferent individuals, turned outwards at the free margin, and intersecting with each other at the angles of the mouth; the superior are united with the lower fibres, and the inferior with the upper fibres of the bucci- nator. Beneath the integument of the filtrum, or space of skin beneath the nose, a band of fibres pass, at first upwards, and then turn forwards, to be inserted into the anterior extremity of the septum nasi; this might be separately described as the naso-labialis; in depth the superior segment extends from the septum to the free margin of the lip; and the inferior, from the trans- verse depression bounding the chin to the free border of the lower lip. Relations.—It receives the insertions of the labial and angular muscles, and lies on the mucous membrane and coronary arteries, covered by the integument. Ac- tion To diminish the oral aperture; assists also in pre- hension, and articulation of certain consonants. The Oral Muscles connected with the lower jaw are four pair proper, namely,—musculus risorius of Santorini, triangularis oris, quadratus menti, and levator labii inferioris; one common to the upper and lower jaw,—the buccinator. Musculus Risorius.— Consists of a flat plane of pale muscular fibre, evidently a portion of the pla- tysma myhoides, arising from the masseter and angle of the jaw, and inserted into the angle of the mouth and integument; wide at the origin, narrow at its insertion, and unequally developed in different individuals. It covers the lower portion of the parotid, the masseter, triangularis oris, facial vein, artery, and buccinator, and lies immediately beneath the skin. We have never seen this muscle extending to the occipital or mastoid process, as described by Gruveilhier, but have observed its frequent absence.MUSCLKS OF THE FACE. 239 Action To draw downwards and backwards the L angle of the mouth, as in laughter. Triangulaeis Oris is seen by raising the last; it ; arises thin and fleshy from the side of the ramus of the 1 lower jaw, from two lines in front of the masseter to tthe mental foramen; the fibres ascend the anterior up- 1 wards and backwards, the posterior vertically; inserted tthin and narrow into the angle of the mouth, continuous 'with the levator anguli, and superficial to the buc- . cinator. Helations.—It lies on the ramus of the jaw, the mental I nerve, and artery, which separate it from the quadratus imenti, on the buccinator and facial artery at its inser- 1 tion, but at its origin this vessel is posterior, and sepa- ]rates it from the masseter; at the commissure, an inti- imate connexion exists between this muscle and the I levator anguli; also the zygomaticus major, so that they 1 would seem to form a single muscle with three points of origin. Action—To depress the angle of the mouth. If act- 1 ing in combination with the musculus caninus, the I aperture may be diminished in the transverse diameter. Quadratus Menti—Somewhat square, and inti- imately adherent to the skin which covers it; arises 1 from the side of the body of the lower jaw, between the 1 mental foramen and symphisis; the fibres pass upwards ; and inwards, and are inserted into the half of the 1 lower lip. Relations.—It is covered by the skin and a yellowish • fatty tissue, which sinks between its fibres, also by the triangularis oris, mental nerve, and artery; it lies on : the bone and the levator of the lower lip; a small space 1 intervenes between the muscles of opposite sides, in ' which is felt below, even through the integument, the 1 mental prominence. Action.—To depress the lip, also draw it outwards i and downwards, making it tense transversely. Levator Labii Inferioris is seen by dissecting I the mucous membrane from the posterior part of the lower lip; there is some difficulty in separating the ! muscles of opposite sides, as they are intimately united 1 in the middle line. It arises I'rom a small depression240 THE MUSCULAR SYSTEM. above the incisor teeth; it passes downwards and for- wards to be inserted into the deep surface of the qua- dratus menti. Relations.—It lies on the bone, and is covered by the quadratus and mucous membrane; its insertion assists in forming the prominence of the chin. Action.—To raise and project forward the lower lip. Buccinator is seen by removing the zygomatics, and a quantity of fat that lies beneath the ramus of the jaw; it is irregularly quadrilateral, consisting of a flat plane of fibres, arising from the external side of the three posterior alveoli of the upper jaw, as far as the tuber, and from an oblique line on the outer side of the ramus of the inferior maxilla, corresponding to the two last molar teeth; and in the interval between these from a strong aponeurosis,—the pterygo-maxillary li- gament, or bucco-pharyngeal aponeurosis, extending from the point of the external pterygoid plate, and inserted into the inner side of the root of the coro- noid process, where it joins the mylohyoid ridge; this ligament gives origin by its anterior edge to the buc- cinator, and by its posterior to the superior constric- tor of the pharynx; from these attachments the mus- cle passes forwards, the inferior fibres ascending, the superior descending, the middle passing horizontally; the superior become continuous with the upper segment of the orbicularis oris; and the superior with the lower; ■whilst the middle are inserted into the angle of the mouth; thus there is a decussation of the superior and inferior fibres, but not of the middle. Relations.—It is covered by skin, fat that separates it from the ramus of the jaw, insertion of the temporal, and the anterior edge of the masseter muscle; it is also covered by the levator and depressor anguli ori's, zygo- maticus major and minor, and the musculus risorius, the facial artery and vein, traiT^verse facial artery, buccal branches of the portio dura, and Steno's duct, by which it is pierced in its posterior and superior third or ancrle. It lies on the mucous membrane and buccal ^^^Adion.—'To draw backwards the angle of the mouth, and thus oppose the orbicularis oris. When the cheeks241 MUSCLES OF THE FACE, are distended, to expel the air or fluid which the mouth may contain. When expelling air the action of the or- bicularis may graduate the column, as when playing on wind instruments, and hence the name buccinator or trumpeter's muscle. It also presses the food between the teeth, thus assisting in mastication and deglutition. Eqt the Vessels of the face, see Vascular System. For the Nerves, see Nervous System. General Remarks.—The muscles of the face are in many subjects but slightly developed; in others well marked, producing a decided contour of the more pro- minent points of the countenance. Their number is not less remarkable than the peculiar association of their action during expression, and the various evidences of mental emotion, whether connected with pleasing sensations, or indicative of painful impressions. These sudden changes are in part volitional; but under many circumstances the features are thrown into forms exhi- biting perfectly the working of the innermost thoughts, notwithstandins; the most violent efforts which the iudi- vidual may put in action to control them. Habit exer- cises a considerable influence on their action; the fre- quent repetition of the same expression may leave a peculiar contour, although the sensation which caused it has vanished; in this way those striking alterations of the features may be produced, which continue as the outward signs of those deep mental operations that mark the dissimilarity of man from all other animals. Independent of expression, their action is important as the regulators of the several openings with which they : are connected, as the eye, nose, and mouth; but as the action of each has been described with its anatomy, we will avoid any further allusion to the subject, and refer the student to the work of Sir C. Bell on Expression. DEEP MUSCLES OF THE FACE. The Deep Muscles of the face are four pair,—masseter, temporal, and the external and internal pterygoids. The masseter covers the external side of the ramus of the lower jaw, tendinous above, thick and fleshy below; it M242 THE MUSCULAR SYSTEM, consists of three portions, which should be examined successively. The first, superficial or anterior portion, arises thick and tendinous from the lower edge of the malar bone and its apophysary tubercle; also from the zygomatic arch of the temporal to within half-an-inch of the articulation; it continues tendinous for one inch and a half of its course, then becomes fleshy, and, passing downwards and backwards, is inserted into the external side of the ramus and angle of the jaw. To examine the second or posterior portion, it maybe exposed by rais- ing the last described, commencing at the posterior edge, and dividing the tendinous septa which attach it to the bone; it arises from the zygomatic arch of the temporal, as far back as the tubercle for the origin of the external 1 ateral ligament, the fleshy fibres then pass downwards and forwards, to be inserted tendinous into the ramus of the jaw, as far down as the angle. The third, or deep portion, may be called transverse, and can only be seen by re- moving the zygoma, and turning it outwards; it arises fleshy from the internal surface of the arch, passes for- wards and inwards, to be inserted into the outer side of the coronoid process of the lower jaw, adhering to the insertion of the temporal muscle. Relations.— It is covered by the parotid, Steno's duct, the transverse facial artery and veins, branches of the portio dura, platysma, and fascia, inferior fibres of the orbicularis palpebrarum and the zygomaticus major; a small part of the posterior portion is superfi- cial immediately in front of the articulation. It lies on the ramus of the jaw, the insertion of the temporal, masseteric nerve and artery, external pterygoid, fat, and buccinator. When a transverse section is made of the muscle, the tendinous origin is observed to be con- tinued through the fibres, forming septa and dividing it into compartments. Action.—This is an exceedingly poAverful muscle, in consequence of its fibres being at right angles to the lever on which it acts. As a whole, it raises the lower jaw; but if the anterior fibres act alone, they elevate and draw it forwards, while the posterior elevate and draw it backwards: thus the alternate actions of the243 MUSCLES OF THE FACE. M 2 muscles of opposite sides produce a rotatory movement of the jaw. If the mouth be widely opened, these mus- cles assist in dislocating the condyle forwards. The Tempokal Aponeurosis is dense, white, and se- micircular ; attached above to the curved ridge on the frontal, parietal, and mastoid portion of the temporal boneT^nd below inclosing the zygomatic arch between its layers. It consists of two strata, dilFering in strength and density, and separated by a small quantity of fat, the zygoma, the middle branch of the temporal artery, and a twig of the orbital division of the superior maxil- lary nerve; the superficial layer is strong, with inter- lacing fibres; the deep, weaker, but intimately adhe- rent to the muscvilar fibres beneath, which it retains in their proper position during their contraction. Now raise the aponeurosis, and carefully dissect off the mas- seter from the ramus of the jaw; as yet it is unneces- sary to interfere with the zygomatic arch. Temporal Muscle.—Fan-shaped or triangular, broad and fleshy above, narrow and tendinoris below; arises from the fascia, which covers it, from the temporal fossa and inner surface of the zygoma, and by short fibres from the crest on the great wing of the sphenoid bone above the external pterygoid; the anterior fibres pass downwards and backwards, the middle vertically, the posterior almost horizontally forwards, gliding over the trochlear origin of the zygoma, and the sphenoidal for- wards and outwards, becoming all attached to the sur- faces and edges of a triangular flat tendon, similar in figure to the muscle, between the layers of which it is seen commencing about an inch superior to the arch, composed of flat bands or fasciculi at its commence- ment, loosely connected with each other above, but fused into a dense fibrous mass below, where it reaches the coronoid process of the inferior maxillary bone, into which it is inserted. Relations.—It is covered by the skin, superficial fas- cia, temporal artery and its branches, attrahens and attollens aurem muscles, temporo-auricular nerve, with the temporal branches of the portio dura, and temporal branch of superior maxillary; then a layer of the epi- cranial aponeurosis, which intimately adheres to the244 THE MUSCULAR SYSTEM. following covering, the temporal fascia, zygoma, and masseter. To examine the deep relations, saw across the zygoma, and carefully dissect down the muscle from above; it will then be seen to lie on the bone, the deep temporal vessels and nerves, a deep layer of fascia, ex- ternal pterygoid, from which it is separated by the in- ternal maxillary artery; also on the buccinator, with the intervention of a large quantity of fat, that like- wise separates it from the pterygo-maxillary ligament. It may now be observed, that the greater portion of the fleshy fibres are situated on the internal side of the ten- don, where they are continued nearly to the upper third of the ramus of the jaw, but the external terminate above the coronoid process. A bursa is interposed be- tween the posterior fibres and the trochlea of the zygo- ma; the middle temporal artery and the temporal branch of the superior maxillary nerve piercing the fleshy fibres of the muscle. Action To elevate the lower jaw, by acting on the vertical ramus from behind, as on a bell-crank. It is thought that the anterior and posterior fibres will draw the bone in their respective directions, and that the posterior antagonize the external pterygoid and avert dislocation. We believe, however, that it can only act in its totality as an elevator in simple vertical move- ments,—a circumstance rendered more probable by its greater development in the carnivora. Its contractile energy must be subject to much variation, as it is often seen pale and weak, with a great predominance of the tendinous over the fleshy structure; but the thickness of the muscle cannot be estimated correctly from ex- ternal appearances,—for in those subjects where the temporal region, before dissection, presented a marked concavity, w"e have found the muscle above the average thickness, this appearing to depend on the depth ot the bony fossa rather than on the superficial structures. At this stage of the dissection, the brain should be removed for future examination; but the dura mater sinuses, and orbit, may now be dissected with much advant;ge, for which see Anatomy of the Nervous ^^The^PTERYGOiD Muscles are situated deep beneath245 MUSCLES OF THE FACE. the ramus of the jaw, and with difSculty exposed in the present stage of the dissection; the masseter should :be removed, together with the parotid gland; then saw through the vertical ramus of the lower jaw, so as to remove the anterior half as far as the angle, where a transv^se section will free it below; now, as the zy- ;goma has been previously cut, the temporal muscle, with the detached portion of the bone, may be thrown idowu, commencing the dissection from above, avoiding cautiously the deeper-seated parts. We think it more advisable always to defer their examination until the ;dissection of the pharynx is about to be commenced, rwhen a more perfect view of their relations may be ob- :tained. Pterygoideus Externus Conical in shape, base :before, apex behind; lies in the zygomatic fossa, within the ramus of the jaw; it arises by short tendinous fibres from the outer surface of the external pterygoid plate, as low down as the triangular process of the pa- late bone, from a spine which is directed downwards,— the commencement of the crest on the great wing of the sphenoid, from that crest its whole length, and be- :hind it from an antejrior-prolongation of the transverse 'root of the zygoma, sometimes from the ti;ber maxil- lary ; the fibres from the pterygoid plate and crest are ^somewhat distinct at first, then forming fleshy bellies, ;that pass backwards and a little outwards, and terminate in around tendon, which is inserted into an oval depres- :sion on the anterior and inner side of the neck of the lower jaw, and by short fibres that pierce the capsular ligament, into the interarticular fibro-cartilage and the inferior synovial sac. Relations.—It corresponds above to the bone, which lis generally hollowed for its reception; sometimes its t tendon grooves the transverse root of the zygoma, near t the internal extremity. It is in contact below with the I internal maxillary artery and vein, a portion of the pa- rrotid, the dental, and gustatory nerves, and the internal lateral ligament, all of which pass through the ptery- :goid space, and consequently lie below it; externally, ■- it is covered by the ramus of the jaw, insertion of the temporal muscle, the masseter at the sigmoid notch, in-246 THE MUSCULAR SYSTEM. ternal maxillary artery and vein, the capsular ligament, and neck of the jaw; internally it corresponds to the external pterygoid plate, which separates it from the internal pterygoid; but behind this it is in contact Avith Its posterior fibres, to the inferior maxillary nerve, its dental and gustatory branches, also temporo-auricular branch, internal lateral ligament, and middle meningeal artery. The depth of the zygomatic fossa influences the size of the muscle, it being much larger where the pterygoid plate is concave externally, and the crest of the sphenoid standing out boldly, or approximating the zygomatic arch; the two fasciculi of the muscle are se- parated by the internal maxillary artery, and it is per- forated by branches of that artery and the inferior maxillary nerve, that will be described with their pro- per systems. Actions.—To draw forwards the lower jaw, also draw in a similar direction the interarticular cartilage, so as to adapt the articular eminence to the condyle. When the jaw is depressed, this muscle is an active agent in the production of dislocation of the condyle, when as- sisted by the muscles that depress the chin; after the displacement of the bone, the muscle is in a state of tonic contraction, and certainly not relaxed, as stated by Nelaton. The production of an artificial disloca- tion in the dead subject, and an accurate examination of all the muscles in its vicinity, has satisfied us of the correctness of Sir A. Cooper's views on this subject. Pterygoideus Internus lies internal to the last, oval in shape; it arises by tendinous fibres from the internal side of the external pterygoid plate, also from the pterygoid process of the palate bone; then becom- ing broad and fleshy, it passes downwards, backAvards, and outwards, and is inserted into the internal side of the angle of the lower jaw. Relations.—Externally, it corresponds to the external pterygoid plate, external pterygoid muscle, gustatory and chorda-tympani nerves, internal lateral ligament, which separates it from the inferior dental artery and nerve, internal maxillary vessels, and a small process of the parotid gland; internally, it corresponds to the ten- sor palati, from which it is separated by a dense pro-247 PAROTID GLAND. cess of the pharyngeal aponeurosis, superior constrictor, tonsil, from which it is separated below by the ptery- go-pharyngeal space, to the stylo-glossus muscle, stylo- maxillary ligament, tonsillitic and facial arteries, and the submaxillary gland. The anterior edge corresponds from below, upwards, to the mylo-hyoid branch of the inferior dental nerve, mylo-hyoid attachment of the superior constrictor, pterygo-maxillary ligament, and the fossa of that name; the posterior edge is related above to the inferior maxillary nerve and otic ganglion, the dental, gustatory, and chorda-tympani nerves, and a portion of the parotid, with the internal lateral liga- ment. Its origin consists of a strong tendon, continued on its inner aspect, not very dissimilar to the masseter; the posterior edge is thinner than the anterior, while it is also thicker above than below. Action To elevate the jaw, and also throw it for- wards,—an effect greatly increased by the muscle being inserted at a right angle to its lever; thus it assists both the masseter and external pterygoid muscles. Glands signify organs that eliminate effete materials from the blood mass, which, remaining in the system, would exercise an injurious influence; or they serve to promote the more perfect performance of the requisite functions of assimilation and absorption. We will di- vide this system into the conglomerate, conglobate, folli- cular, and lymphatico-vascular glands; a division founded on anatomical characters that can be recognised without difficulty. Under the first, the salivary glands, mammae, pancreas, lachrymal, liver, kidneys, may be classed. The lymphatics are the only representatives of the se- cond; their particular description will be given with the absorbent system. The third class includes those glands which are spread over the mucous surfaces, and are more or less simple, being devoid of a ramified, se- creting, tubular system, as the buccal, labial, tonsilli- tic, Brunnerian glands. The fourth are principally com- posed of a vascular structure, without a proper efferent duct; are variable in size, in contour, and even in per- sistency ; these are the spleen, suprarenal capsules, thy- mus and thyroid bodies. At present, it will be prefer-THE MUSCULAR SYSTEM. 248 able to confine our remarks solely to the salivary system and its peculiarities. Tliese glands are disposed in three pairs, in the im- mediate vicinity of the lower jaw, and communicating with the buccal cavity. The parotid is the largest, the submaxillary intermediate in size, and the sublingual the smallest of the three; but although they differ in size and position, still they possess many well-marked common characters, each being related structurally to a large vessel, and occupying sucli a situation that al- most continual pressure is the result of the natural motions of the lower jaw. Their structure presents a uniform friability, and an efferent duct emanates from each, forming a communication with the mucous cavi- ties ; they are also similarly developed from the mucous layer of the germinal membrane, and are devoid of any proj)er capsule save that which is derived from the fas- cial investments in the neighbourhood. Their struc- ture is difficult to determine without careful prepara- tion; the ducts commence by oval granular follicles, that constitute the parenchymatous tissue of the glands; these are collected into lobules, from which a short tube, sometimes recognised with difficulty, passes to join the common efferent duct; from their number they confer on the tubular structure an arborescent appearance. The lobules are inclosed by sepimenta of the investing fascia, the capillaries ramifying in the interlobular spaces; the whole system of tubes is lined by a continuation of the mucous membrane of the mouth. In the larger, the epithelium is squamous; but in the ultimate rami- fications, a granular layer supplies its place. Branches both of the sympathetic and cerebro-spinal nerves, sup- ply these glands copiously; they secrete the salivary fluid, which varies in quantity from 15 to 24 ounces in the twenty-four hours; it is a clear, transparent fluid, with an alkaline re-action when not overcharged with mucus, which is acid, and consequently may alter or neutralize the re-action of the saliva. It consists of water, a peculiar animal matter named ptyaline, mu- cus, epithelium, and the granules of the secreting sur- face; also, chlorides and lactates of potash and soda.PAROTID GLAND. 249 pliosphate and silicate of lime, soda in combination with'mucus, and a peculiar principle, sulpho-cyanogen, •which gives to the saliva the character of striking a pur- ple colour Avith a persalt of iron. Its uses are various, but not of that importance which the quantity of the secre- tion would seem to indicate. Amongst the most obvious may be enumerated,—to promote the sense of taste, to stimulate the stomach, to saturate the acidity of the superabundant gastric juice, to assist in the produc- tion and modulation of sound, and, lastly, to act che- mically on the amylaceous aliments, converting them into sugar. Parotid Gland occupies a deep recess between the posterior edge of the ramus of the jaw and the anterior margin of the mastoid process and sterno-mastoid mus- cle; its salient outline can be easily distinguished in the living subject; this space undergoes considerable variations in size, produced firstly by the position of the head; secondly, by the movements of the lower jaw; if the head is depressed so as to approximate the chin to the sternum, the ramus of that bone glides back- wards over the sterno-mastoid muscle, almost obliterat- ing the recess inferiorly, whilst its greatest degree of magnitude is attained by throwing the head backwards and advancing the chin; when the lower maxilla is de- pressed to its utmost, the angle passes backwards, covering the space inferiorly; but during this movement the upper part is increased by the gliding forwards of the condyle; in the old edentulous subject, and in the infant, the space is large, but with the subsequent de- velopment of the incisor teeth, it gradually diminishes; the skin in this region is thin and fine, loosely attached to the subjacent parts; on raising it some fibres of the platysma are seen, frequently forming a strong, flat, muscular plane, passing from the ramus of the jaw to the angle of the mouth (musculus risorius); through these fibres may also be observed the anterior branch of the auricularis magnus nerve, imbedded in the sub- stance of the fascia, which constitutes the next covering of the gland. Fascial Investment.—This is derived from the cer- vical region, and consists of a strong layer, not only M 3250 THE MUSCULAR SYSTEM. confining the gland to its anatomical region, but also sending septa into its structure, connecting and like- wise isolating its lobules, attached superiorly to the zy- goma, posteriorly to the mastoid process, cartilage of the ear, and tendinous anterior edge of the sterno-mastoid muscle; anteriorly it dips beneath the edge of the gland, separating it from the masseter, passing deep to be connected with the following; when the external jugular vein is raised with its superficial covering, the deep cervical fascia will be seen attached to the styloid process and internal side of the ramus, together with the angle of the lower jaw, forming the stylo-maxillary ligament, ascending to be attached to the vaginal pro- cess above, and continuous with the internal lateral ligament anteriorly; thus the parotid is enclosed in a fibrous pouch with a well-marked outline that precludes the escape of purulent depots in several directions; for- wards the diffusion is prevented by the dipping in of the superficial layer beneath the gland, backwards by the continuity of the two layers at the anterior edge of the sterno-mastoid, below by the pouch formed by the separation of the superficial cervical fascia from the stylo-maxillary ligament, and above the intimate junc- tion of the fascia to the zygoma, precludes the possibi- lity of escape in that direction; it consequently seeks the nearest and least resisting outlet, escaping through the fissure of Santorini in the cartilaginous meatus of the external ear; in this capsule there exist certain openings, by which parts enter and leave the gland, that will more properly come under consideration with the deeper structures. The parotid is somewhat square on its superficial surface, often with a caudate prolon- gation inferiorly, and a similar expansion superiorly in the vicinity of the duct. The following are its bounda- ries:—superiorly by the zygoma, inferiorly by a line drawn from the angle of the jaw to the sterno-mastoid muscle, one inch, sometimes more, below its insertion; posteriorly by the cartilage of the ear, themastoid process, sterno-mastoid, and digastric muscles; anteriorly by the ramus of the jaw, masseter muscle, of which it overlaps the posterior third; from the superior anterior angle of the gland arises Steno's duct; this is about the size of a goose-251 PAROTID GLAND. quill, an inch and a half in length, formed by the conflu- ence of the efferent tubes of the lobules, it passes forwards over the tendinous portion of the masseter, half-an-inch below the zygoma; at the buccinator it becomes involved in a quantity of fat, in which it dips backwards, pierces the superior posterior angle of that muscle directly, then passes betAveen the muscular fibres and the mucous membrane of the mouth for some distance, and perfo- rates the latter also, directly opposite the second superior molar tooth, below the reflection of the mucous mem- brane from the cheek to the gums; this duct, imme- diately after its origin, perforates the fascial capsule, a process of which is prolonged on its surface; beneath this a dense fibrous layer, of a white and glistening ap- pearance, preserves the figure and gives resistance to the tube; internally it is lined by a pale mucous mem- brane, continuous with that of the mouth; surrounding the duct, just as it pierces the buccinator, are from three to five small granular bodies, communicating with its cavity by short eff"erent tubes; it is difiicult to say whether these are naked buccal glands, or are the earliest developed portion of the parotid; deeper than these the duct loses its fibrous coat, and is then merely a mucous tubule to its termination; above the duct a distinct portion of glandular structure is sometimes pre- sent, named socia parotidis,—its ducts communicate with that of Steno, and never open separately into the mouth; it appears to us as a subsequent development of the gland, as we never could succeed in detecting its existence in the foetus or infant; above the duct the transverse facial ar- tery and vein, with the socia parotidis, when it exists, and the temporo-fascial branches of the portio dura nerve, are found, and it is covered by integument, platysma, fascia, fat, and the zygomaticus major muscle. Now make a transverse section through it; the coats appear of great thickness, the central cavity wonderfully small, so much so that we have sometimes experienced great difficulty when trying to introduce the pipe of a mercurial appa- ratus into its orifice at the anterior edge of the masse- ter ; it is requisite to be acquainted with the direction of the duct, and after many observations and compari- sons of the several methods which have been suggested,THE MUSCULAR SYSTEM. 252 ■we think that half-an-inch below the apophysary tn- bercle of the malar bone and zygomatic arch indicates its position correctly; but in one case the distance amounted to three-quarters of an inch. The deep surface may be divided into three processes; from the situations they occupy these may be named glenoid, maxillary, and styloid; the first is the most simple process; it is wedged into the posterior part of the glenoid cavity of the temporal bone, and is related anteriorly to the capsu- lar ligament of the lower jaw, behind to the cartilaginous meatus, and internally to the vaginal process; the tem- poral artery runs upwards through it, also the temporo- auricular nerve that runs through this process, to reach the back part of the temporal artery, then winds upon its superficial surface, following the course of that ves- sel ; above it lies in contact with the bone, the chorda- tympani nerve, and laxator tympani tendon; this por- tion is small in the foetus and infant, in consequence of the processus auditorius not being developed, also in old age, when the teeth disappear, when the condyle of the jaw passes backwards, and causes atrophy of this process; the maxillary portion difi'ers greatly in size, even on opposite sides of the same subject; caudate and prolonged, it passes inwards between the internal late- ral ligament and ramus of the jaw, also between the pterygoid muscles, into the space of that name, incor- rectly stated to be in contact with the inferior maxillary nerve, from which it is separated by the external ptery- goid muscle; the internal maxillary artery runs through it, deeply situated; externally it corresponds to the ramus of the jaw and the inferior dental artery; inter- nally to the dental and gustatory nerves, and the inter- nal lateral ligament; still more internally it corresponds to the pterygoid muscles, the before-named nerves, and the internal maxillary artery. It has been mentioned that this process varies in size, sometimes it is even absent altogether; a mere vertical sulcus in the gland, corresponding to the ramus of the jaw, signifies the only attempt at the formation of the process, and when absent a lobule of fat supplies its place. The styloid process lies in a recess of a triangular form, bounded behind by the posterior belly of the digastric, inter-253 PAROTID GLAND. nally and anteriorly by the stylo-maxillary ligament and styloid process; on raising it from its deep relations the external carotid is seen perforating the stylo-maxil- lary ligament, and then enters the gland. If the finger be now passed deep into the space, the internal carotid may be felt, also the styloid process; but although the glandular structure lies over the internal carotid artery, internal jugular vein, the eighth, ninth, and sympathe- tic nerves, it never can be in contact with them, as there does not exist any opening in the capsule, at any part of its deep surface, to allow the gland to reach the ves- sels above-mentioned. This portion contains generally three lymphatic glands, sometimes only one; these are subject to chronic enlargement, and coincident with that change a consequent absorption of the parotid structure. Let attention now be directed to the parts lying in the gland: on the surface is seen the auricu- laris magnus nerve, a branch of the cervical plexus, ascending on the fascia, and dividing into an auricular and facial branch, which are both tegumentary; descend- ing in front of the tragus, on the horizontal root of the zy- goma is seen the temporal vein, lying superficial and anterior to its corresponding artery,—this is formed above the zygomatic arch by the confluence of the an- terior middle and posterior temporal veins; it then re- ceives the transverse facial, and becomes the temporo- facial vein ; about half-an-inch below the condyle of the lower jaw it is joined by the internal maxillary vein, and then receives the name of temporo-maxillary; accompanying the external carotid in the gland, separated from that vessel, however, by the portio dura, at the angle of the jaw it receives the posterior auris, and sometimes the occipital, and then becomes external ju- gular in the inferior lobe of the gland. Now dissect deeply in front of the mastoid process, and the portio dura will be seen passing at first downwards, then turning forwards and upwards, deep behind, but super- ficial at its exit from the gland; between the gland and the stylo-mastoid foramen it gives off three small fila- ' ments,—posterior auricular to the ear, digastric branch to the muscle of that name, and stylo-hyoid branch, named from its destination to that muscle; it then254 THE MUSCULAR SYSTEM. divides into two branches,—temporo-facial and cer- vico-facial, that communicate in their diverging course through the gland, forming the pes anserinus, or paro- tidean plexus; deeper than this is seen the external carotid, coursing upwards, between the anterior edge of the sterno-mastoid and the ramus of the jaw, deep below, more superficial about half-an-inch inferior to the condyle, where it divides into the temporal, internal maxillary and transverse facial branches; there is also another small artery in the lower part of the gland,—the posterior auris that runs upwards and backwards to reach the ear. For each of those parts enumerated it is obvious that there must be apertures in the fibrous capsule of the gland; now if the gland be dissected up from below, and the deep layer of the capsule removed, the lingual, spinal-accessory, glosso-pharyngeal, pneu- mogastric, and sympathetic nerves, the internal carotid, and jugular vein, become visible. THE MUSCLES OF THE NECK. The region of the neck may be divided into anterior and posterior cervical; the former consists of all that space which is included between the ramus of the jaw above, the clavicles and interclavicular ligament below, and bounded behind by the anterior margins of the trapezii muscles; this space is unequally concave at either side of the middle line, but presenting many well-marked prominences in the latter situation; these can only be properly understood when the student has dissected the parts; any enumeration of them will, there- fore, be avoided until the larynx is being examined in de- tail. Eaise the shoulders of the subject by a block, and allow the head to droop; then secure it to one side by hooks, so as to render tense the integument; make an inci- sion from the chin to the sternum, carry another back- wards along the ramus of the jaw; and lastly, along the clavicle to its acromial extremity; raise the skin from before backwards, carefully avoiding the subjacent parts, as the fineness of this investment may cause a mistake to be committed in this respect. The areolar tissue is fine, but small in quantity, beneath the skin, and connects255 MUSCLES OF THE NECK. the latter to the following muscle, — plastysma my- hoides vel panniculus carnosus, a flat subcutaneous muscle, longer than broad, thin, and often scarcely per- ceptible below, thick and fleshy above; it arises from the fascia covering the deltoid and pectoral muscles, passes obliquely upAvards, forwards, and inwards, over the cla- vicle, to which it adheres, reaches the chin and ramus of the jaw; becoming attached to the latter, and at the chin decussating with its fellow, it is inserted into the muscles of the lower lip, angle of the mouth, and lower edge of the orbicularis palpebrarum, some fibres ascending upon the fascial covering of the parotid to the zygoma. Relations.—Subcutaneous, some of its fibres being mixed with the basement membrane of the skin; it lies on the superficial fascia, and the parts which are beneath that structure, with the external jugular vein, and the superficial branches of the cervical plexus. Actions.—To draw down the integument of the cheek, retract the angle of the mouth, and corrugate the skin of the neck; it is the analogue of the panniculus carno- sus of the lower animals; in the otter we have seen this muscle nearly a quarter of an inch in thickness; it acts in this animal as a depressor of the lower jaw, but whether it may have any effect in urging the lymph through the glands and vessels beneath it, is question- able. Before this muscle is removed the following parts are seen through its fibres:—external jugular vein, auricularis magnus, occipitalis minor, and superficialis colli nerves; also, inferiorly, the supraclavicular and acromial branches of the cervical plexus. The ex- ternal jugular, formed in the inferior lobe of the parotid, as before described, or by an arched branch, which con- nects it with the internal jugular, passes obliquely doAvnwards, backwards, and outwards, at first beneath the superficial cervical fascia, but crossing the sterno- mastoid, it becomes superficial to that structure, con- tinues its course to the posterior inferior triangle of the neck, pierces the fascia, is joined by the transversalis humeri and colli veins, and, becoming a little dilated, opens into the subclavian vein, corresponding to the third stage of the artery ; it forms an exception toTHE MUSCULAR SYSTEM. 256 the general rule of the cervical veins, being destitute of valves, this having two, one at the point where it crosses the sterno-mastoid, and the second at its termi- nation, but these valves are quite incapable of prevent- ing regurgitation. AuRicuLARis Magnus This nerve, a branch of the second cervical, passes at first backwards to clear the posterior edge of the sterno-mastoid, pierces the fascia, winds upwards, forwards, and inwards, on that muscle, parallel, but behind the jugular vein, and supplies the integument over the parotid and ear. The SuPERFiciALis Colli consists generally of two branches, with a similar origin to the last; they pass backwards, pierce the fascia, then run forwards and inwards, one superficial, the other deeper, than the jugu- lar vein, and terminate in the integument on the side of the neck and supra-hyoid region. The Occipitalis Minor lies at the posterior edge of the sterno-mastoid, beneath the fascia, and on the sple- nius, aponeurotic portion of the sterno-mastoid, and lastly, on the occipito-frontalis, and terminates in the integument of the scalp; its origin is also similar to the former branches. The SupEA-CLAVicuLAR and Acromial branches are derived from the third and fourth cervical nerves, are flat, like ribbons, and lie in the structure of the super- ficial fascia, pass over the clavicle and acromion, to ter- minate in the integument. Fascia or Fibrous Investment consists of several laminse, which may be divided into the superficial, mid- dle, and deep, or prevertebral layers; amongst these there is a perfect continuity, but in order that the de- scription of its parts may be understood, an artificial division is adopted by anatomists. The Cervical Fascia commences from the ligamen- tum nuchee, and can be traced forwards between the superficial and second layer of muscles on the back of the neck; it then passes forwards, covering the posterior lateral triangle, and, arriving at the posterior edge of the sterno-mastoid, it splits into a superficial and deep layer, which enclose that muscle; the superficial passes upwards over the ramus of the jaw, to which it is at-257 MUSCLES OF THE NECK. ttacted; also to the fascia of the masseter, then passing over the parotid to the zygoma; in the middle line it is -continuous with its fellow of the opposite side, below descending over the clavicle and sternum, to be conti- inuous with the thoracic fascia; the deep layer lies be- ineath the sterno-mastoid, attached above to the styloid jprocess and inner surface of the angle and ramus of the 1 lower jaw, forming the stylo-maxillary ligament, which ■separates the parotid from the submaxillary gland; in t the supra-hyoid region it passes beneath the sub-maxil- llary gland, constituting its capsule; surrounds the I tendons of the digastric muscles, and is stretched be- I tween their anterior bellies, where it is thick and strong; lit also adheres to the sheath of the carotid; tracing it I down in the middle line, its thickness is greatly aug- I mented, and it is attached below to the interclavicular 1 ligament and posterior edge of the sternum; this strong : layer forms by its margins the pulley for the omo-hyoid tendons; thus the action of those muscles causes ten- ; sion of the fascia, averting both atmospheric pressure . on the trachea, and likewise bears off the contractions ' of the sterno-mastoid during sustained muscular ex- . ertion; inferiorly and externally it reaches the clavicle to which it attaches the subclavian vein, with the trans- versalis humeri artery; and, still descending, it envelops the subclavius, passing beneath the bone into the ax- illa, forming the costo-coraco-clavicular ligament; at the outer margin of the sterno-hyoid, a layer passes between that muscle and the sterno-thyroid; also a se- cond stronger portion crosses the front of the trachea, firmly stretched between the sterno-thyroid muscles, but not adherent to the trachea, merely covering it, and traceable on its surface, as far down as the bifur- cation of that tube, where it is considered, but erro- neously, to become fused with the fibrous layer of the pericardium, — a circumstance receiving some sup- port from the position the fibrous structures of the neck bear to the pericardium in foetal life; the parts separating the superficial from the deep cervical fascia are, above, the sternum, the interclavicular ligament, cellular tissue, and a few lymphatic glands; in the whole extent the sterno-mastoid intervenes between258 THE MUSCULAR SYSTEM. them; and above, the ramus of the jaw with the parotid gland. The deep, or prevertebral layer will be fully- described subsequent to the removal of the pharynx. Now remove the fascia, and expose the sterno-mas- toid muscle, also remove the deeper layer of fascia, and the cellular tissue occupying the interspaces between the vessels and nerves. Sterno-mastoid.—Broad and flat below, narrow in the middle, expanded again superiorly; it arises by an oval tendon from the upper and anterior surface of the first bone of the sternum, also by a broad tendon, from the upper edge of the external third of the clavicle; a narrow triangular space intervenes between these at- tachments; the sternal portion ascends obliquely up- wards and backwards; the clavicular, wider and thinner, passes vertically upwards behind the sternal; about the middle of the neck they become united, and imme- diately below the mastoid process form a strong tendon, weak and expanded posteriorly, which is inserted into the outer and posterior part of the mastoid process, above its apex, and into the external third of the supe- rior transverse ridge of the occipital bone. Relations.—It is covered superficially by the skin, fascia, and platysma, external jugular vein, superficialis colli and auricularis magnus nerves, parotid and posterior auris artery; it lies on the sternum, clavicle, carotid artery, subclavian and arteria innominata, jugular and subclavian veins, anterior scalenus, sterno-hyoid and thyroid, and omo-hyoid muscles, thyroid axis, phrenic nerve; above this, the brachial and cervical plexus, middle scalenus, sterno-mastoid and cervicalis ascen- dens arteries, rectus capitis anticus major, digastric and splenius, parotid gland, occipital artery, and spinal accessory nerve, which pierces its upper third. Action.—Both muscles acting will draw the head downwards and forwards; if one acts it will rotate it to the opposite side; if the head be slightly drawn back- wards, these muscles will then increase the retroflexion, as in opisthotonos. Omo-hyoideus.—Placed at the side and inferior part of the neck, consists of two fleshy bellies and a central tendon; the posterior arises, flat and tendinous, from259 MUSCLES OF THE NECK. the angles of the notch, in the superior costa of the sca- : pula, also from the ligament of the notch, on which its : fibres are sometimes prolonged to the base of the coracoid • process; it soon becomes fleshy and ascends obliquely ; forwards and inwards; beneath the sterno-mastoid it forms a narrow silvery tendon, and emerging from under that muscle, becomes again fleshy, then ascending almost vertically along the outer border of the sterno- hyoid, it is inserted into the lower part of the body and cornu of the os hyoides. Relations.—Its origin is between the supraspinatus externally, and the serratus magnus internally; it crosses the posterior scalenus, brachial plexus, anterior scalenus, phrenic nerve, transversalis colli and cervicalis ascendens arteries, omo-hyoid plexus, carotid artery, jugular vein, pneumogastric and sympathetic, thyroid body, siiperior thyroid artery, and superior laryngeal nerve; it is covered by the trapezius; anterior to this by the fascia and external jugular vein, sterno-mastoid muscle; and lastly, by the anterior jxigular, when that vein exists; the suprascapular nerve runs along the upper edge of the posterior belly; the subclavian ar- tery and vein below it; the anterior belly has internal to it the sterno-hyoid, and externally the common and external carotid arteries. The tendon of this muscle is absent in the foetus and infant, and gradually increases until the twenty-fourth year. Action.—To make tense the cervical fascia; as an ele- vator of the shoulder, its action is slight; it also draws downwards and backwards the os hyoides, thus acting on the larynx and pharynx in deglutition, a function vfith which it is connected through the descendens noni nerve of the ninth. Sterno-htoid—Flat and narrow, placed at one side of the mesian line; arises, tendinous and fleshy, from the posterior surface of the first bone of the sternum, ster- nal end of the clavicle, posterior sterno-clavicular liga- ment, and the cartilage of the first rib at its posterior aspect; ascends obliquely outwards, and is inserted into the lower edge of the body of the os hyoides, internal to the omo-hyoid. Relations.—It is covered by the sternum, fascia, andTHE MUSCULAR SYSTEM. 260 anterior jugular vein; it lies on the sterno-thyroid, crico, and thyro-hyoid muscles. Action—To depress the os hyoides, and assist in the elevation of the sternum in forced respiration; its nervous supply is similar to the omo-hyoid; as these muscles converge above they are, consequently, nearer to each other than the sterno-thyroid; above or opposite the crico-thyroid space they, therefore, bound laterally the position for the operation of laryngotomy. Sterno-thyeoid.—Situated below the last, which should be divided to expose it; flat and broad, it arises fleshy and with short tendinous fibres intermixed, from the posterior surface of the first bone of the sternum, lower down than the sterno-hyoid; also from the cartilage of the second rib; it passes obliquely upwards and inwards, and is inserted into an oblique ridge on the ala of the thyroid cartilage, where it appears to give ofi" the thyro- hyoid muscle. Relations.—It lies on a deep layer of fascia, which separates it from the remains of the thymus gland and left vena innominata in the thorax; above this it lies on the trachea; on the right side the arteria innominata, right carotid, and subclavian arteries, the internal jugular and subclavian veins; on the left side, the left subcla- vian and carotid, with veins similar to those on the right; it now lies over the vertebral and inferior thy- roid arteries, lateral lobe of the thyroid body, cricoid cartilage, insertion of crico-thyroid muscle, thyroid car- tilage, and thyroid branch of the artery of that name; it is covered by the sterno-hyoid and mastoid muscles, branches of the omo-hyoid plexus intervening; this mus- cle is wider than the sterno-hyoid, on the inner side of which its margin projects, so as to overlap the trachea; it is, therefore, between these that the operation of tra- cheotomy is performed; the width of the muscle is always dependent on the size of the thyroid body; we lately saw a case where its breadth was two inches; sometimes a waving tendinous line occurs, a little be- low the centre, producing a digastric disposition. Thyro-hyoid Seems to be a continuation of the last; arises, by an oblique margin, from the ridge on the side of the thyroid cartilage; passes obliquely upwards and261 MUSCLES OF THE NECK. backwards, and is inserted into the lower edge of the body of the os hyoides. Relations.—It lies on the thyroid cartilage, thyro- hyoid membrane, and branch of the superior thyroid artery, sometimes on the superior laryngeal nerve; it is covered by the sterno-hyoid and a branch of the lin- gual nerve that supplies it. Action To depress the os hyoides; vrhen that bone is fixed it may elevate the thyroid cartilage, and thus relax the vocal chords by diminishing the crico-thyroid space. Let the student now direct particular attention to the surgical regions into which the neck has been di- vided, conceiving that the mesian line divides this space into two symmetrical halves; each presents a figure somewhat quadrilateral', longer from above downwards than transversely; the sterno-mastoid crosses it ob- liquely, forming an antero-lateral triangle in front of that muscle, and a postero-lateral behind it; the former has its base at the ramus of the jaw, and a line prolonged from the angle of that bone to the mastoid process; the apex at the sternum; the base of the latter corresponds to the clavicle; its apex to the occipital bone behind the mastoid process of the temporal; these are again sub- divided by the omo-hyoid, coursing from below and behind, obliquely upwards and forwards, into four lesser triangles, which have been named the anterior inferior, and the anterior superior (but this latter would be incomplete without the continuation of the line of the omo-hyoid, by the anterior belly of the digastric), the posterior inferior and posterior superior triangles. The anterior inferior triangle is bounded internally by the sterno-hyoid and thyroid muscles, below by the anterior edge of the sterno-mastoid, and above by the anterior belly of the omo-hyoid; the base is at the mesian line; the apex at the decussation of the sterno-mastoid and omo-hyoid muscles. On removing the fascia the ante- rior jugular vein is seen coursing along the outer mar- gin of the sterno-hyoid and the omo-hyoid plexus, formed by the descendens and communicans noni of the cervical plexus; on raising the anterior part of the sheath the carotid artery and jugular vein are exposed, the pneumogastric nerve lying behind and between262 THE MUSCULAR SYSTEM. them; lower down, but deeper, on removing the pos- terior layer of the sheath, the inferior thyroid artery, inferior cervical ganglion of the sympathetic, with the trunk of the nerve, are seen; behind these the vertebral artery; and in the groove between the trachea and oeso- phagus the laryngeal recurrent nerve is observed ascend- ing, lastly the lateral lobe of the thyroid body, lying on the trachea; in addition to these the thoracic duct on the left side. Posterior Inferior Triangle is bounded below by the clavicle which forms its base, above by the pos- terior belly of the omo-hyoid, and in front by the poste- rior edge of the sterno-mastoid; it contains a quantity of lax areolar tissue and lymphatic glands, the external jugular vein, the transversalis humeri and colli veins, and from below and before, upwards and backwards, the subclavian vein; behind this the artery of the same name, supported by the first rib; and, still more poste- riorly, the formation of the brachial plexus; the transver- salis colli artery crosses the apex, and parallel to the base runs the transversalis humeri, connected to the posterior edge of the clavicle by a strong fascia. The Anterior Superior Triangle may be considered as consisting of two regions: the proper triangle being below the posterior belly of the digastric muscle, whilst above that muscle and below the ramus of the jaw, the digastric space is situated. The Superior or Middle Trlw^gle is bounded behind by the sterno-mastoid, above by the posterior belly of the digastric, and below by the anterior belly of the omo-hyoid; the apex corresponds to the cornu of the OS hyoides, the base to the sterno-mastoid. Immediately beneath the fascia a number of veins are seen, forming a plexiform and intricate interlacement; the facial, ex- ternal, and anterior jugulars contributing to its forma- tion ; on removing these the descendens noni nerve is seen on the external and anterior part of the sheath, and by further dissection the common carotid artery, in its superficial stage; also its division into external and internal or deep carotids, internal jugular, and its subsidiary veins,—the pneumogastric and branches of sympathetic and lingual nerves, the latter runningMUSCLES OF THE NECK. 263 parallel to tlie digastric; the superior laryngeal branch of the vagus crosses deeply behind the two carotids, in its course to the thyro-hyoid space; the spinal accessory is also seen in the posterior superior angle, between the sterno-mastoid and digastric, with the following branches of the external carotid arising within the space,—supe- rior thyroid, lingual, facial, occipital, posterior auris, muscular, and ascending pharyngeal arteries. The Posterior Superior Triangle is bounded below by the omo-hyoid, behind by the trapezius, and in front by the posterior margin of the sterno-mastoid; it con- tains the cervical plexus, a number of lymphatic glands, forming a chain along the posterior edge of the sterno- mastoid (glandulae concatenatEe); also the spinal acces- sory nerve, which crosses obliquely towards the acromial edge of the trapezius and twigs of the cervicalis super- ficialis artery, with the transversalis colli. The student should defer the more particular examination of the several parts enumerated until the muscles of the suprahyoid region have been described. Digastric.—To see the origin of this muscle the parotid must be removed, the sterno-mastoid raised, and the splenius capitis drawn backwards. As its name im- plies, it consists of two bellies, united by a central tendon, taking an arched direction beneath the ramus of the jaw; it arises narrow from a deep pit or groove, internal to the mastoid process of the temporal bone, forms a fleshy belly that passes downwards, forwards, and inwards, about an inch and a half from its origin; it becomes tendinous, and pierces the stylo-hyoid mus- cle, then is connected to the cornu of the os hyoides by a dense fascial pulley, and reflected upwards, forwards, and inwards; is inserted into the digastric pit, at one side of the symphisis menti, below the mylo-hyoid. Relations.—It will be seen that the origin of this muscle is thin, wide, and tendinous, similar to its inser- tion, with the intervening tendon, representing a double cone united at the apices, the narrow portion contained in a pulley with a synovial lining. In order to produce further security, the cervical fascia is firmly stretched between the tendons, covering the space above the os hyoides; this is sometimes described as the supra-hyoidTHE MUSCULAR SYSTEM. 264 aponeurosis; sometimes a thin slip arises from the os hy- oides following theinner edge of the anterior belly, one por- tion being inserted into the lower jaw, and a second, which is deeper, into the mylo-hyoid muscle; or the slips of op- posite sides may be united in the mesian line; the pos- terior belly lies on the occipital artery, which separates it from the rectus capitis lateralis muscle, on the sub- occipital nerve, internal jugular vein and spinal ac- cessory, the lingual, pneumogastric and sympathetic nerves, but at some distance from them; it next crosses the internal, external carotids and facial arteries, stylo- hyoid muscle, and at the posterior part of the cornu of the OS hyoides it again crosses the lingual nerve; here it also lies on the lingual artery and hyo-glossus muscle; whilst in the pulley it conceals the insertion of the my- lo-hyoid, and on this muscle the anterior belly lies to its insertion; it is covered by fascia platysma and facial vein, also by a small portion of the parotid, the anterior edge of the sterno-mastoid and facial vein; fibres of the stylo- hyoid must, of necessity, lie superficial to it, with the submaxillary gland; the posterior belly is pierced by the anastomotic filament of the digastric branch of the portio dura, passing to the glosso-pharyngeal; the ante- rior belly is perforated by branches of the submental artery; a case has been observed where this muscle did not pierce the stylo-hyoid. Action.—li the lower jaw be fixed, it will first raise the OS hyoides, and then draw the head backwards; the posterior belly will draw the pharynx upwards and backwards, the anterior upwards and forwards; but it appears to us that the principal action of this muscle is to draw the os hyoides upwards, forwards, and out- wards, thus expanding the pharynx during deglutition. Now dissect off the fascial pulley, and turn up the di- gastric over the ramus of the jaw, so that it be replaced when requisite, and attentively examine the following ^^mlsTRic Space—Semicircular, situated below the iaw; is bounded above by the ramus of the jaw and a line continued from that to the mastoid process; behind, by the posterior belly; and in front by the anterior por- tion of the digastric; below by the tendon of that muscle.SUBMAXILLARY GLAND. 265 ' This space is divided into two unequal parts by the stylo- : maxillary ligament,—the anterior, or submaxillary, : the posterior, or parotidean region; the latter is the ;smaller of the two; the anterior contains the submaxil- lary and sublingual glands, and the genio-hyoid range of [lymphatics, the mylo-hyoid, lingual, and gustatory I nerves, the facial, lingual, and submental arteries, with tthe supra-hyoid muscles. In the posterior are contained, I from superficial to deep, the auricularis magnus nerve, texternal jugular vein, lower lobe of the parotid, cer- 'vico-facial branch of portio dura, external carotid, ^ styloid process, origin of styloid muscles, stylo-hyoid [ligament, internal carotid, jugular vein, eighth, ninth, :and sympathetic nerves, and ascending pharyngeal and [palatine arteries. Submaxillary Gland.— Intermediate in size be- •tween the parotid and sublingual, is situated in the : anterior digastric space, and consists of a superficial and deep portion; it is bounded in front by the ramus of :the jaw, which presents an oval depression in this situ- ;ation; behind, by the posterior belly of the digastric; ^externally, by the angle of the jaw, stylo-maxillary liga- tment, and internal pterygoid muscle; internally, by •.the anterior belly of the digastric; inferiorly, it is co- >vered by the integument, platysma, and fascia; it lies lin contact with the mylo-hyoid, stylo-hyoid, and ten- . don of the digastric; the superficial portion is oblong J and lobulated, surrounded by a quantity of lax areolar ttissue, which separates it from the fascia, and allows of periodic enlargement; at the posterior margin the (duct emerges from the body of the gland, and winds I round the posterior edge of the mylo-hyoid, so as to get tabove that muscle and lie on the hyo-glossus; the deep [process accompanies the duct, forming a linear series ■of lobules on each side of that tube, connected above tto the sublingual gland. The course of the Whar- ctonian duct is first backwards and upwards, then for- \ wards and inwards, over the inferior surface of the :hyo-glossus; in this situation it lies below the sublin- :gual gland, to which it is connected, but the communi- cation between them is not at all certain; it next winds 1 above the gustatory nerve, getting between the sublin- N266 THE MUSCULAR SYSTEM. gual gland and genio-liyoglossus muscle, then running forwards and upwards, it pierces the mucous mem- brane of the sublingual space opposite the inferior in- cisor teeth, the exact situation of its termination being marked by a papilla on either side of the fraenum linguae. The facial artery runs through the posterior edge of the body of the gland, occasionally dividing it into two distinct lobes; the vascular supply, which is very abun- dant, is derived from this trunk and its submental branch, as well as from the sublingual branch of the lingual artery; the veins are subsidiary to the forma- tion of the facial. If the posterior margin of the mylo- hyoid muscle be drawn forwards, or a few of its ex- ternal fibres divided, on following the gustatory nerve forwards, two branches are seen to be detached from it; these pass downwards to the posterior edge of the gland, and there form a gray swelling or ganglion (the submax- illary), which again sends two branches upwards to reach the formative nerve further on in its course; this ganglion also receives filaments of the sympathetic, con- ducted by the facial artery, and the branches which it yields are lost in the gland and on the coats of the duct; the chorda tympani is conceived to be the principal source of this ganglion, and if it be received in the light of a branch of the portio dura, it will probably preside over the active movements of the ducts of the glands. In addition to the foregoing, filaments from the mylo- hyoid branch of the inferior dental nerve can be traced into the substance of the gland; between it and the ramus of the jaw three or four lymphatic glands are situated; these receive the absorbents, which are few in number, and of but slight importance. Structural Anatom7j.—l^he capsule surrounding the lo- bules is exceedingly weak; it is consequently much more easy to unravel the tissue of this gland than that of the parotid; the smaller tubes coalesce to form the ultmiate duct which is peculiar for its large size, the thmness of its coats, and the length of its course, with its vicinity to the mucous membrane of the mouth. When any ob- struction occurs to its orifice it easily suffers distention, eventuating frequently in the formation ot calculi from the solid elements of the salivary secretion; the amount267 MUSCLES OF THE NECK. of the secretion of each in twenty-four hours is about four ounces. Now raise the superficial portion of the gland and throw it backwards, when the following muscles will be brought into view. Mylo-htoid.—Triangular in shape, the base at the lower jaw, the apex at the os hyoides; it arises by short, tendinous, and fleshy fibres, from the two anterior thirds of the myloid ridge of the lower jaw, extending from the maxillary attachment of the superior constric- tor to the symphisis menti; the fibres pass downwards, backwards, and inwards, and are inserted into a central tendinous raphe, common to it and the muscle of the opposite side, extending from the chin to the os hyoides, also into the upper edge of the body of that bone. Relations.— Below to the submaxillary gland, and the anterior belly of the digastric, submental, and fa- cial arteries, mylo-hyoid nerve, facial vein, with the skin, platysma, and fascia; the external edge is related to the superior constrictor, gustatory nerve, deep process of submaxillary, stylo-hyoid, and glossus muscles, stylo- hyoid ligament, lingual nerve and artery, and middle ■ constrictor; the internal edge is united with its fellow ■ of the opposite side. Now remove its insertion into the ' OS hyoides, separate the median raphe, and throw the muscle upwards towards the ramus of the jaw; it will now be seen that its upper surface is related to the fol- lowing parts, from above downwards:—The mucous membrane of the mouth, sublingual glands, deep pro- ' cess of the submaxillary, and Whartonian duct, gusta- tory nerve, hyo-glossal plexus, lingual nerve, and at the ; anterior edge of the hyo-glossus, the ranine artery, also the genio-hyoid, genio-hyo-glossus, hyo-glossus, stylo- : glossus, and lingualis muscles. Action.—To depress the lo-wer jaw; also to elevate : and draw forwards the os hyoides, and press the tongue I against the teeth if the mouth is closed, or protrude it : if it is open. It likewise forms the floor of the mouth, I and preserves the outline of the sublingual space when the cavity is distended. Genio-hyoid.—Short, fleshy, and fusiform in shape, : is placed beneath the lower edge of the genio-hyo-glossus, of which it appears to be an appendage; it arises by a N 2268 THE MUSCULAR SYSTEM. short tendon from the inferior genial eminence, soon becomes fleshy, passes downwards and backwards, and is inserted into the upper edge of the os hyoides. Relations It corresponds internally to its fellow, from which it is often with difficulty separated; exter- nally to the sublingual deep process of submaxillary gland, lingual and gustatory nerves, hyo-glossus, ra- nine artery, but some distance intervenes; below, to the mylo-hyoid, and above to the geuio-hyo-glossus. Action.—To elevate the os hyoides, and assist in the protrusion of the tongue. Hyo-glossus.—Oblong, flat, and fleshy, arises from the upper edge of the cornu of the os hyoides; its fibres pass upwards, backwards, and outwards, and are in- serted into the side of the tongue. Relations.—Externally and anteriorly it corresponds to the lingual nerve, hyo-glossal plexus, gustatory, with Whartonian duct, stylo-glossus, and sublingual gland, covered by the mylo-hyoid, stylo-hyoid, and digastric muscles; it lies on the lingual artery, which separates it from the middle constrictor and stylo-hyoid ligament, on the superior constrictor, mucous membrane, and ge- nio-hyo-glossus muscle. Action.—To elevate the os hyoides, and draw down the sides of the tongue, so as to cause a convexity of the dorsum of that organ. In order to expose fully the genio-hyo-glossus, saw through the jaw at its symphisis; draw the tongue from the mouth, and separate the muscles of opposite sides. Genio-hyo-glossus.—Triangular, arises narrow and tendinous from the middle genial eminence; the fibres diverge, the superior arching upwards and forwards to the point, the middle to the base of the tongue, and the inferior curving downwards and backwards, and are in- serted into the body of the os hyoides. Relations.—Internally it is in contact with its fellow, except immediately above the hyoid bone, where a nar- row triangular plate of cartilage, sometimes ligament, intervenes; a thin stratum of yellowish fatty tissue unites the two muscles, particularly below; externally it corresponds to the mylo-hyoid, hyo-glossus, and the inferior lingualis, the sublingual gland, the Wharto-SUBLINGUAL GLAND. 269 rnian duct, and deep process of the submaxillary; the ;gustatory and lingual nerves and ranine artery are also :external to it; the genio-hyoid lies along its lower bor- der and the frtenum linguse, and a slip of the sublin- ;gual gland, correspond to its upper edge. Action.—The anterior fibres may depress the tip of I the tongue into the sublingual space; the middle fibres I may draw down the centre of the organ, rendering it I concave transversely; the inferior fibres will retract the t tongue if the os hyoides is fixed, as in deglutition; they Lalso, by acting from the chin, will raise the hyoid bone, . and thus protrude the organ; this is evidenced in hemi- ] plegia, the muscle on the sound side, by elevating the 1 bone, protruding the tongue to the opposite or paralyzed ihalf of the body. On the outer side of this muscle is :seen a longitudinal muscular fasciculus, named— Inferior Lingualts, pale in colour, a longitudinal ! fasciculus, wide behind, narrow before, attached poste- 1 riorly to the os hyoides, and passing forwards to the : apex of the tongue. Relations.—Externally hyo-glossus, internally genio- 1 hyo-glossus, below with the ranine artery, branches of 1 the lingual and gustatory nerves, the filaments of the Hatter piercing its substance; above with the central I muscular nucleus of the tongue. Action.—To shorten and retract the tongue. Sublingual Gland.—The third representative of the ! salivary system, is situated immediately below the mu- • cous membrane of the mouth; in size it scarcely exceeds a filbert, although a difi'erent estimate might be formed of : its magnitude until fully isolated from the deep process of the submaxillary ; it is bounded above by the mucous membrane of the sublingual space, below by the mylo- hyoid, separating it from the body of the submaxil- lary ; anteriorly by a depression on the posterior sur- face of the symphisis menti; posteriorly by the root of the tongue; internally by the hyo-glossus and genio-hyo-glossus muscles, above the edge of which it sometimes passes to reach its fellow of the opposite side; externally by the deep process of the submaxil- lary gland; its capsule is weak, and the whole gland is very moveable; the ducts are numerous and divisible270 THE MUSCULAR SYSTEM. into three sets: four or five open on a fold at the in- ferior and lateral part of the tongue; three to seven on the sublingual space behind the inferior canine teeth; and five or six unite to form a single tube, which either iinites with or more frequently follows the course of the Whartonian duct, opening external to it on the mucous membrane of the sublingual space; the amount of the secretion of both glands is about two ounces in twenty- four hours; the nervous stipply is derived from the gustatory nerve, and the vascular from the sublingual branch of the lingual artery. The Styloid Muscles should now be examined, but in doing so avoid injuring the carotids or their branches; these muscles are three in number,—stylo-hyoid, glos- sus, and pharyngeus. Stylo-hyoid.—A narrow fleshy fasciculus, arises by a round tendon from the outer side of the styloid pro- cess, about its centre; this tendon winds at first back- wards and outwards, then turns forwards so as to surround two-thirds of the external carotid; it then becomes fleshy, is pierced by the tendon of the digastric, and continues its course to be inserted into the body of the OS hyoides, superficial to the hyo-glossus. Relations It lies on the styloid process, the external and internal carotids, jugular vein, pneumogastric and sympathetic nerves, partly on the digastric, lingual nerve and artery with the facial and the hyo-glossus; it is covered at its origin by the external carotid, facial vein, submaxillary gland, also at the os hyoides, by a few fibres of the mylo-hyoid. This muscle is very rarely absent; the stylo-hyoid branch of the portio dura supplies it. Action To draw the os hyoides, larynx, and pha- rynx upwards and backwards; it cannot act independent of the digastric. Stylo-glossus.—Arises tendinous from the anterior and internal part of the styloid process, from its centre to its point; also from the stylo-maxillary ligament; it passes obliquely forwards and inwards, and is inserted into the side of the tongue, external to the hyo-glossus, extending as far as the apex, there uniting with its fellow to form a loop.THYROID GLAND. 271 Relations.—Externally it corresponds to the parotid, from wbicli it is separated by fascia, to the stylo-maxil- lary ligament, internal pterygoid, the tonsillitic artery intervening, external carotid, mylo-hyoid muscle, and submaxillary gland; internally to the internal carotid, jugular vein, superior constrictor, ascending pharyngeal artery and hyo-glossus; separating its lower edge from the stylo-pharyngeus are seen the styloid process, the stylo-hyoid ligament, glosso-pharyngeal nerve, and as- cending palatine artery. Action.—To retract the tongue, also to draw it to one side; when both these muscles act, the tongue is rapidly retracted into the mouth, if it has been pro- truded, for the performance of which function they are admirably adapted. Stylo-pharyngeus.—Longer than the la,st; arises from the back part of the root of the styloid process; passes downwards, forwards, and inwards, insinuates itself between the superior and middle constrictors, and is inserted into the posterior part of the thyroid cartilage, from the superior to the inferior cornu. Relations.—It is covered by the external carotid, facial artery, the glosso-pharyngeal nerve winding round it to reach its forepart, superior laryngeal nerve, mid- dle and inferior constrictors; it lies on the internal carotid artery, jugular vein, pneumogastric, glosso- pharyngeal, lingual, superior laryngeal, and sympathe- tic nerves, ascending pharyngeal artery, mucous mem- brane, and superior constrictor. We have seen this muscle frequently split by the glosso-pharyngeal nerve. Action.—To raise and dilate the bag of the pharynx. The Thyroid Gland should now be examined. This glanduliform mass may be seen to occupy the front of the trachea, the sides of that tube, and the larynx, to a greater or lesser extent in diflferent cases. It consists of two lateral lobes, with a central or connecting slip; each lobe is convex on its external surface, narrow and pointed above, large and wide inferiorly, somewhat con- cave on its tracheal aspect; the middle lobe is usually situated at the inferior part, but always nearer to the lower than the upper of the lateral, which it unites, but this is subject to variety in position, as well as inTHE MUSCULAR SYSTEM. 272 ! shape; it may lie in front of the second, third, and fourth rings of the trachea, or it may pass behind that tube or the cesophagus;. as to shape it may be a mere transverse band, or thick and convex, projecting ante- riorly like a tubercle; or lastly, it may be wholly absent, the two lateral lobes being fused into a single mass in the middle line. The lateral lobe is covered by the sterno-hyoid and thyroid muscles, the latter corresponding in width with the development of the gland; by its deep surface it rests against the oesopha- gus, laryngeal recurrent, inferior thyroid artery, infe- rior constrictor, trachea, cricoid cartilage, and inferior third of the thyroid; the outer lip overlaps the sheath containing the carotid, jugular vein, and pneumo- gastric nerve, the amount depending on the size of the gland; the upper edge is concave, embracing the lower edge of the cricoid cartilage, and corresponds to the ramus thyroideus of the superior thyroid artery; from its centre, sometimes from the right or left margin, a thin band may be observed to ascend, either in the middle line or on one side, reaching the thyroid car- tilage, or, more rarely, mounting on the thyro-hyoid membrane to reach the os hyoides; this structure has been by some considered as a muscle,—" levator thy- roidei," a view principally derived from the circum- stance, that in some cases it is distinctly fibrous, but this certainly constitutes the exception, for in many cases where a favourable opportunity occurred, we have examined this structure in a recent subject, and have found it always presenting an appearance similar to the body of the gland, with but slight modification; in one instance the band became swollen in the notch of the thyroid cartilage, resembling in its external characters a small lymphatic, but a section revealed the same tissue that constitutes the peculiar characteristic of the gland itself. Again, we have seen it with an inter- rupted structure, partly fibrous, the remainder glan- dular, presenting the appearance of a string of berries; this is plainly the remains of the laryngeal portion of the gland, its diminution occurring spontaneously with the development of the larynx. Structure.—The gland is divisible into lobes andTHYROID GLAND. 273 lobules, the latter being composed of cells of an angular or flattened shape, containing nucleated cells, and an oily fluid; in hypertrophy these cells become circular,, resembling fat vesicles, but differing from them in pos- sessing fibrous walls. Mr. Simon believes this struc- ture to be an organ supplemental in foetal life to the development of the great nervous centres. The gland adheres very intimately to the first ring of the trachea, but there is not a trace of any duct at this point, or in any situation in connexion with the air-tube. Arterial supply is derived from the superior and inferior thyroid arteries, and sometimes the fifth branch passes upwards, in front of the trachea, from the arch of the aorta or arteria innominata. The nervous supply is derived from the sympathetic; we have not succeeded in tracing any filaments from the pneumogastric itself into the gland, except a doubtful branch of the recur- rent, which seems to terminate in the interannular membrane of the trachea; the lymphatic vessels open into the glands above the sternum; the veins are superior, inferior, and transverse, and will be found described with their proper systems. The weight of the gland varies from one ounce and a half to two and a half, but is subject to excessive enlargement (goitre), induced by the influence of climate and peculiarities in the aqueous aliments; it is also comparatively larger in the foetus than the adult, and is developed as two distinct and independent bodies, the middle lobe being the last to appear. The student should now proceed to the dissection of the vessels, commencing with the subclavians, and then following the anatomy of the carotids and their branches; he may now also trace the several nerves to which allusion has been made in the account of the muscles; full descriptions of both will be found in the proper section devoted to their examination, to which reference should now be made. Let him then proceed with the dissection of the pharynx and larynx. In order to prepare the pharynx for examination cut across the trachea and oesophagus, together with the n3THE MUSCULAR SYSTEM. 274 great vessels and nerves, and raise them carefully from the deep muscles, as high as the base of the skull. If it is desirable to preserve the skull, disarticulate the atlas from the occipital bone, but if otherwise, and this is the mode to be preferred, place the saw between the styloid and mastoid processes, and cut through the temporal and basilar process of the occipital bones; introduce tow or hair, so as to distend the bag and make tense the muscles; this object is facilitated by lirst passing the matei-ial used for distention through the cavity of the mouth, and subsequently completing the process from the oesophagus. The Pharynx is a musculo-membraneous bag, of a conical form, with its base above at the cranium, the apex at the oesophagus, and extending from the skull to a point level with the fifth cervical vertebra. The following are its general relations:—Behind it cor- responds to the longi colli and recti antici muscles, covered by the prasvertebral fascia; in front it cor- responds, from above downwards, to the openings of the Eustachian tubes and posterior nares, to the velum, isthmus faucium, base of the tongue, epiglottis, glottis, and posterior surface of the larynx; laterally to the great vessels and nerves of the neck; below to the oeso- phagus; above to the basilar process of the occipital bone. The structures entering into its formation are muscles, fibrous membrane, and a mucous lining, form- ing part of the gastro-pulmonary system; the muscles are divided into the intrinsic and extrinsic, the former are represented by the constrictors, the latter by the stylo-pharyngeus, palato-pharyngeus, with other super- numerary slips to be hereafter described. The CoNSTRiCTOKS, thin plates of muscular fibre, are symmetrically arranged, three on either side, inferior, middle, and superior, overlapping each other from below upwards; consequently the inferior is most super- ficial, the superior the deepest of the three. This arrangement cannot be seen when the pharynx is removed, the muscles being covered by a strong but thin fascia, which adheres more intimately to the infe- rior constrictor than to either of the others, and is very275 PHARYNX. strong in tliis situation. When this is removed the fibres are seen, but the several origins require for their exposition a more definite description of each. Inferior Constrictor.—The origin is exposed by- throwing up the sterno-hyoid and thyroid muscles, and then removing the lateral lobe of the thyroid body; it is somewhat square, the upper and lower edges being oblique, the posterior straight, and the anterior irregu- lar ; it arises from an obliqu.eline on the ala of the thyroid cartilage, between the sterno-thyroid and crico-thyroidin front, and the insertion of the stylo-pharyngeus behind ; also from the inferior cornu of the same cartilage, and from a ridge on the cricoid, between the crico-thyroid and crico-arytenoideus posticus, sometimes from the first ring of the trachea or thyroid body, and more rarely by a slip from the superior and posterior edge of the cricoid cartilage, which, when it exists, is connected with the proper arytenoid muscles; from these points of origin the fibres pass upwards and backwards, and are inserted into a central tendinous raphe, extending from the cuneiform process to the oesophagus on the posterior surface of the pharynx; the lower margin embraces the oesophagus, and behind the cricoid origin, the inferior laryngeal nerve and the inferior laryngeal branch of the thyroid glide between it and the oesophagus; the upper margin overlaps the middle constrictor, and be- tween their origins are found the superior laryngeal nerve and artery, and the superior cornu of the thy- roid cartilage; in this space may likewise be observed the thyro-hyoid ligament and the insertion of the sty- lo-pharyngeus muscle. Now divide the inferior constric- tor in the middle line, reflecting it forwards towards the thyroid cartilage, when the peculiarity of its origin may be seen; this consists of three arches, the first extends from a tubercle in front of the superior cornu to a se- cond inferiorly, at the j unction of the posterior with the middle third of the ala of the thyroid; a tendinous band intervenes between them; it is next attached to the in- ferior cornu on the external surface, sometimes a little anterior to it, thus forming a second arch smaller than the former, beneath which the crico-thyroid muscle passes to its insertion; lastly, a third arch is formed be- tween the last attachment and the cricoid origin; the cri-THE MUSCULAR SYSTEM. 276 CO-thyroid articulation lying beneath it. These arches are not always equally well marked, but can in every case be discovered with careful dissection. Middle Constrictor Triangular; apex at the os hyoides; base at the tendinous raphe posteriorly; to see its origin, the digastric, stylo-hyoid, andniylo-hyoidmus- cles, also the hyo-glossus and the lingual artery, should be removed; it arises from the appendix of the os hy- oides, from the stylo-hyoid ligament, from the whole length of the upper edge of that bone, and from the pos- terior edge of the thyro-hyoid ligament; the fibres di- verge: the superior pass obliquely upwards and back- wards, the middle horizontally, the inferior downwards andbackwards, the fibres from the thyro-hyoid ligament being almost vertically downwards; it is inserted into the middle tendinous raphe and cuneiform process of the occipital bone; the lingual artery lies on its origin, co- vered by the hyo-glossus; it is overlapped in its course backwards by the inferior constrictor, and it again con- ceals the superior; it is separated from the latter by the stylo-pharyngeus muscle and glosso-pharyngeal nerve; its superior insertion separates the lesser sinuses of Mor- gagni, beneath the occipital bone. Superior Constrictor.—Irregular as to shape and outline; will be exposed by drawing the pharynx to one side and removing the stylo-glossus, with the parts occu- pying the interval between it and the internal pterygoid (the pterygo-pharyngeal space); it is attached to the base of the cranium by an aponeurosis, which should now be examined. Pharyngeal Aponeurosis.—This structure is di- vided into portions really continuous, but receiving dis- tinct names, derived from their attachments; these are, the occipito-pharyngeal, petro-pharyngeal, pterygo-pha- ryngeal, and bucco-pharyugeal divisions; the occipito- pharyngeal is attached above to the basilar process of the occipital bone, then passes downwards between the constrictors and mucous membrane, becoming weaker in its descent, except in the middle line, where it forms the raphe, and finally terminates by being lost on the external surface of the ossophagus; externally its margin becomes connected with the petro-pharyngeal process, their junction forming an acute angle, lying internal to277 PHARYNX. the carotid artery and jugular vein, but separated from them by the superior cervical ganglion of the sympa- thetic. The petro-pharyngeal portion is directed from before, backwards, attached to the petrous portion of the temporal bone external to the levator palati and Eusta- chian tubes, passing forwards and downwards, it splits into two layers, to form the pterygo-pharyngeal por- tion, one of which is attached to the posterior lip of the internal pterygoid plate on the internal side of the ten- sor palati; the other, much stronger, to the crest which bounds internally the navicular fossa; on the internal side of the last-named muscle, at the hamular process, these unite and descend to the inner side of the root of the coronoid process of the lower jaw as the pterygo- maxillary ligament or bucco-pharyngeal aponeurosis, but still it can be traced to the mylo-hyoid ridge of the lower jaw, constituting another origin of the constrictor, and with good reason should be named mylo-pharyngeal process; through the instrumentality of this continuous hbrous sheet, the superior constrictor is attached, but anteriorly it has an additional connexion to the side of the base of the tongue, as the glosso-pharyngeal muscle. It therefore arises from the side of the base of the tongue, from the posterior third of the mylo-hyoid ridge, from the pterygo-maxillary ligament, hamular pro- cess, and internal pterygoid plate, from the petrous por- tion of the temporal bone, and cuneiform process of the occipital; the fibres run in curv-es between the several points of attachment, the concavities directed upwards; and in the intervals of the fixed points certain parts are found; thus, between the maxillary and pterygoid at- tachments the internal pterygoid muscle and gustatory nerve are seen, and in the interval between the ptery- goid and petrosal, the muscles of the palate and Eusta- chian tube are placed; and lastly, between the petrous and occipital, two semilunar spaces are situated, bounded above by the occipital bone, where the muscular tissue is deficient, allowing the fibrous aponeurosis to become visible. The Extrinsic Muscles are the stylo-pharyngei and palato-pharyngei ; the former have been already described; the latter will be examined with the palate.THE MUSCULAR SYSTEM. 278 In addition to these there are some accessory slips that are only present in some cases; the first arising from the hamular process and internal pterygoid plate, passing downwards over the tendon of the tensor palati, expand, and are attached to the mucous surface of the superior constrictor; this is often connected to the soft palate, and contained in its mucous fold (Albinus); the name of pterygo-pharyngeus has been applied to it. A fleshy band arises from the petrous portion of the temporal bone between the levator palati and the pharyngeal aponeurosis, with which it is blended; this sometimes expands and invests the Eustachian tube, and is then continued as far as the palato-pharyngeus, which may have induced Winslow to consider it as a distinct mus- cle, under the name of salpingo-pharyngeiis, on account of its attachment to the Eustachian tube, but the term petro-pharyngeus appears more applicable. A small fasci- culus, more like ligament than muscle, arises from the spine of the sphenoid bone, internal to the internal lateral ligament of the lower jaw, and external to the Eustachian tube, over which it arches downwards, to be attached to the pharynx (Riolauus). In the majority of cases this is merely a process of that ligament, forming an arch be- neath the Eustachian tube, becoming continuous with the pharyngeal aponeurosis; it is named spheno-pharyn- geus. An occipito-pharyngeus has also been described, arising from the cuneiform process, and descending to be inserted with its fellow of the opposite side into the middle line; this has no existence, but sometimes a few fibres of the rectus capitis anticus major are attached to the pharynx, which may have been confounded with a distinct muscle. The pharynx is supplied by the ascending pharyngeal, palatine, superior, and inferior thyroid arteries, also by branches from the internal ca- rotid and lingual; the pharyngeal plexus of nerves is destined for it solely, as well as branches from the su- perior and inferior laryngeal and glosso-pharyngeal. Action. It will beobserved, that thebag of thepharynx is attached to fixed points, lying at its superior part, that serve to keep its walls apart. At the highest limit it is stretched between the pterygoid plates; beneath this, between the rami of the jaw, and again, below the latter,EUSTACHIAN TUBE. 279- I the cornua of the os hyoides preserve its width, dividing 1 it anatomically into nasal, buccal,and laryngeal portions; ithe first can suffer but slight alteration either as to i length or width; on the contrary, the buccal, in conse- I quence of the mobility of the points to which it is at- • tached, undergoes extensive changes as to length and width during the performance of the act of deglutition ; the laryngeal is but slightly moveable during that func- tion. From the independence of each constrictor, the gradual contraction of the canal from above is provided, for as the function of deglutition is purely reflex, that portion contracts to which the stimulus is first applied,of course indirectly, as it is on the mucous surface the excito-motive impression occurs. Lay open the pharynx by a vertical incision on the back part; wash it out; the canal is similar in figure internally to the external out- line, and is lined by mucous membrane, presenting seven openings, all situated at the anterior wall; four of these are placed above the velum, namely, the Eustachian tubes and posterior nares; three below that fold,—the isthmus faucium, glottis, and oesophagus. Posterior Nares Two oval openings, one inch from above downwards, and from half to tliree-quarters of an inch transversely, form the only communication of the nose with the pharynx; they are bounded above by the body of the sphenoid bone, below by the palate plates of the palate bone; internally by the vomer, crest of palate, and rostrum of the sphenoid; externally by the internal pterygoid plate and nasal process of the palate bone. In the recent state the openings are somewhat diminished by the mucous lining. Eustachian Tube—In order to dissect this canal, let the levator and tensor muscles of the palate be ex- posed behind the internal pterygoid process. It is one inch and three-quarters in length, extending from the anterior wall of the tympanum to the posterior nares. In consequence of its tympanic dilatation, and a similar enlargement at the nasal extremity, but of greater size in the latter situation, the tube taken in its whole length is trumpet-shaped; the osseous portion is continued in the temporal bone between the outer side of the petrous and squamous portion, the termination appearing in theTHE MUSCULAR SYSTEM. 280 retreating angle between them. Here the cartilaginous part commences, one inch in length, directed forwards and inwards, but it is not completely surrounded by cartilage, the deficiency inferiorly and internally being made up of fibrous tissue; at its termination the pos- terior lip is the more prominent of the two, and lies im- mediately behind the posterior, extremity of the inferior spongy bone. Eelations.—Superiorly it is in contact with the union of the spinous process of the sphenoid with the petrous portion of the temporal bone, both being grooved so as to form a half cylinder, deeper before than behind for the reception of the tube; more anteriorly the cartilage closing the anterior lacerated hole, the Vidian nerve, with the root of the internal pterygoid plate and body of the sphenoid, are above it; externally it corresponds to the middle meningeal artery, temporo-auricular, and inferior maxillary nerves, the latter being separated from it by the otic ganglion; still more anteriorly to the tensor palati, internal pterygoid plate, and pterygo-pha- ryngeal aponeurosis; internally to the petro-pharyngeal, aponeurosis, which it pierces, also the levator palati and mucous membrane. This tube conveys air into the ca- vity of the tympanum, in order to support the membrane stretched across the outer opening of that portion of the middle ear; occasionally its canal is obstructed, a change inducing Eustachian deafness; its permeability may be discovered by compressing the nostrils, closing the lips, and then forcing the air contained in the cavity of the mouth bacliAvards; if it obtain access to the tympa- num, it produces a crackling of the membrane perfectly audible to the experimenter. This tube is absent in fishes, and has a common opening at the posterior nares in birds. Its vascular supply is derived from the posterior auris, ascending pharyngeal, and the descending pala- tine, with twigs from the internal carotid arteries; its nervous, a branch from the lesser palatine nerve and otic ganglion. The mucous membrane lining the tube is pale, soft, and thick; the epithelium is clubbed and ciliated, but the latter character is peculiar to that of the tube, and never extends to the lining oi the tym- panum.281 VELUM PENDULUM PALATI. Velum Pendulum Palati.—Composed of a double fold of mucous membrane, a distinct fibrous, or aponeu- rotic layer, with the expanded attachments of five pair of muscles, presents a quadrilateral outline, with the uvula projecting from the lower margin; the anterior superior border is attached to the posterior edge of the palate plates of the palate bones, continuous in this po- sition with the mucous membrane of the mouth and nose; the posterior inferior margin presents a double curve or arch, with tlie projecting uvula forming the centre; the nasal surface is convex and looks upwards and backwards; the oral, concave, looks downwards and forwards; the edges laterally are attached to the superior constrictor. Now dissect off the mucous membrane from the nasal surface, and also from the inner aspect of the pharynx, and thus will be brought into view three pair of muscles, namely, levator, tensor palati, and motor uvulse. Levator Palatl—Roimd, thick, and fleshy above, broad and expanded below; it arises by a short tendon from the petrous portion of the temporal bone in front of the carotid foramen; also from the cartilaginous part of the Eustachian tube on its posterior surface; it passes at first downwards and forwards, then expanding, turns inwards, and is inserted into the dorsum of the soft pa- late, extending from the posterior to the anterior edge of that membrane; some of its fibres terminating in the palatine aponeurosis, others crossing the middle line to become continuous Avith those on the opposite side; these latter are short and often tendinous in structure. Relations.—Externally with the tensor palati and su- perior constrictor, also the Eustachian tube; internally with the mucous membrane: its horizontal portion is covered by the motor uvulse, and lies on the palato-pha- ryngeus. Action.—To raise the soft palate. Tensor vel Circumflexus Palati—Fleshy above, tendinous below; it arises from the fossa navicularis at the root of the internal pterygoid plate, from the base of the spine of the sphenoid, and anterior surface of the Eustachian tube. It forms a thin, fleshy fasciculus, flat- tened from side to side, descends along the internal282 THE MUSCULAR SYSTEM. pterygoid plate, terminates in a round tendon that plays around the hamular process, from which it is separated by a bursa; then expands, and is reflected horizontally inwards, and is inserted into the aponeurosis of the ve- lum, and also into the posterior edge of the palate bone. Relations.—Externally with the internal pterygoid muscle, from w^hich it is separated by a fibrous layer; internally with the internal pterygoid plate, superior constrictor, and Eustachian tube, which separates it from the levator palati; the horizontal portion is continuous with the palatal aponeurosis, and above and before the levator, it is covered by the motor uvulee. Action. —To make tense the velum, and if the lower part is fixed, to dilate the Eustachian tube. Motor Uvulae occupies the middle line of the palate; it arises by a long tendinous slip from the spinous pro- cess of the palate bone; passes at first backwards, then curves forwards, and is inserted into the areolar tissue of the uvula. Relations.—Above, mucous membrane; below, levator palati muscles, with the palatal aponeurosis. These muscles are often described as a single fleshy mass, un- der the name of azygos uvulse, but an areolar line al- ways separates them. They have been said to be occa- sionally absent, but this opinion probably arose from examining them too near the palate bone, where the structure is fibrous. Action.—To shorten and elevate the uvula. Palato-pharyngeus is seen by drawing upwards the velum, and dissecting oflF the mucous membrane behind the tonsil, also from the under surface of that fold itself; it arises broad and fasciculated, fleshy in structure, from the inferior surface of the palatine aponeurosis, becomes narrow, and passes downwards and backwards, to be in- serted into the superior cornu and posterior border of the thyroid cartilage. Relations.—li\ the palate it is below the insertions of the superior muscles; in the pharynx it is between the mucous membrane and superior constrictor, where it forms the posterior half-arch of the palate. Its action will be described with the palate in general. Palato-glossus.—Smaller and shorter than the last,VELUM PENDULUM PALATI. 283 is seen by removing the mucous membrane in front of the tonsil; it arises broad from the inferior surface of the velum, passes downwards, becoming narrow, and then again expanding, is inserted broad into the side of the tongue with the stylo-glossus. Relations.—Internally, mucous membrane; externally, superior constrictor; posteriorly, tonsil. It forms the anterior half-arch of the palate. The mucous membrane of the velum is formed^ on the nasal aspect by a continuation from that cavity; that on the lower aspect is prolonged from the mouth; both layers uniting at the posterior free edge and apex of the uvula. This membrane is comparatively thick and soft, pale on the upper, more vascular on the lower, surface; the epithelium partakes of the characters pecu- liar to the cavity in its vicinity, being columnar and ciliated on the nasal surface, squamous on the oral aspect. In addition to the five pairs of muscles already described, a dense aponeurosis occupies the upper half, continuous above with the fibrous layer of the hard palate, of the nasal fossae, and the Eustachian tubes, this receives the insertions of the several muscles, but does not extend to the inferior border, where the two layers of mucous membrane are in contact with the intervention of lax areolar tissue and glands, largely prolonged into the uvula. The glands are involuted mucous tubules, and are more numerous on the inferior than superior sur- face ; their ccecal extremities lie in the areolar tissue. This latter constituent of the velum is lax, and permits of ra- pid and extensive effusion, in which the uvula partici- pates. The uvula is a pyramidal projection, sometimes flat or bifid; it may also be absent; but this is a rare occurrence in the normal state; it curves forwards above the base of the tongue, but does not touch it. In relaxa- tion of the palate subsequent to repeated attacks of in- flammation, particularly of an asthenic character, it fre- quently becomes elongated to such an extent as to lie continually on the tongue, but its very slight sensibility does not permit it to produce any irritation, except that during a sudden inspiration, or an attempt at degluti- tion, it may be carried so far back as to touch the epi- glottis. That such is the explanation is proved by the284 THE MUSCULAR SYSTEM, fact, that when the palate is swollen to such an extent as to lie in contact with the tongue, spasmodic cough- ing rarely, if ever, occurs. The soft palate is of utility in the expression of sounds, both natural and acquired, but its integrity is of paramount importance in con- nexion with the function of deglutition. During the performance of this act, when the food is passing over the retracted and elevated root of the tongue, when at the first impression of irritation the upper part of the pharynx contracts, and the isthmus of the fauces is closed, there is a natural tendency to regurgitation through the nares. Magendie believes that it is obviated by the elevation of the soft palate, but the subsequent observations of Dzondi have proved that a more com- plex mechanism fulfils this important office. The pa- late, no doubt, suffers tension; but then the palato- pharyngei contract, forming an oblique plane directed downwards and backwards, but still there exists a fis- sure between them to which the elevated and shortened uvula is applied; thus a perfect partition is established between the nasal and buccal portions of the pharynx, and in this way regurgitation is avoided. The vascular supply is derived from the ascending and descending palatine arteries; the nerves Avhich influence it are the palatine branches of Meckel's ganglion. Isthmus Faucium is an oval opening of communica- tion between the mouth and pharynx, in shape trans- versely oval, bounded above by the velum and uvula; below by the base of the tongue, and laterally by the half-arches of the palate and the tonsil. This opening is subject to variations in figure, depending on the po- sition of the tongue, the movements of the palato-pha- ryngei and glossi, and also on the degree of development of the tonsil. Tonsils or AMYGDALiE.—These are oval or almond- shaped follicular glands, placed in a recess between the anterior and posterior pillars of the palate, large above, narrow and pointed below, covered by afiue mucous mem- brane prolonged into the follicles which constitute the greater portion of these bodies. Each tonsil has anteriorly the palato-glossus; posteriorly, the palato-pharyngeus; below, the base of the tongue; and externally, the supe-285 MOUTH, rior constrictor and internal pterygoid muscle. The vici- nity of these muscles evidently provides for a certain de- gree of pressure on the gland, urging the secretion of mu- cus from the follicles. Severallarge vessels are also in close proximity, usually described as the boundaries of the gland; thus on the external side is the external or super- ficial carotid; anteriorly the facial, and posteriorly the internal carotid. When the tonsil enlarges, it becomes of necessity much closer to those vessels by its external surface, the pterygo-pharyngeal aponeurosis, however, obviating its enlargement to any considerable extent in that direction, the principal increase being towards the mucous surface, impinging on the cavity of the mouth, so that, in applying a cutting instrument to the internal surface of an enlarged tonsil, it is really more remote from any large vessel than in the healthy condition of the gland. The tonsil is very freely supplied with blood from the following arteries:—Internal carotid, ascend- ing pharyngeal, tonsillitic, ascending and descending pa- latine ; these form a plexus surrounding the gland, from which the capillaries freely enter its structure; it pos- sesses but slight sensibility, and is supplied by branches from the glosso-pharyngeal nerve, gustatory, and sym- pathetic. The student should now direct attention to the ca- vity of the mouth and its contained organ,—the tongue. The oral cavity may be examined either by making a vertical section of the skull and face, or by dividing the buccinator and removing one-half of the ramus of the jaw. It is of an oval figure, bounded above by the hard and soft palate; below by the tongue and the sub- lingual space; laterally by the cheeks, molar teeth, and alveoli; posteriorly by the isthmus faucium; and an- teriorly by the incisor and canine teeth, with the lips. The superior wall is arched, the concavity directed downwards; so that anteriorly the roof looks downwards and backwards, the posterior part downwards and for- wards. Although fixed and immovable anteriorly, that portion constituted by the floating curtain can alter its position with freedom and facility. The anterior por- tion of the wall of the cavity may also be elongated by protrusion of the lips; a similar enlargement may ensueTHE MUSCULAR SYSTEM. 286 laterally by distension of the cheeks, and the vertical space is constantly suffering change in extent, depending on depression and elevation of the tongue. Mucous membrane can be traced from the free border of the lower lip on its posterior surface; from this to the gum; then over the intervals between the teeth to the posterior surface of the gum; then backwards, forming the floor of the sublingual space to the under svirface of the tongue, producing a fold in the middle line (frse- num linguffi); from this over the apex and edges of this organ tu its base, and by the glosso-epiglottid folds, three in number, on the lingual face and margins of the epiglottis; from the free margin of the upjjer lip to the posterior surface, then backwards on thegum,form- ing a fold in the middle line, the frgenum of the upper lip. Sometimes franulse are also observed opposite the lateral incisors, indicating the original development of the lip from three centres; it then passes between the teeth to the posterior surface of the gum, from which it is prolonged on the lingual surface of the hard and soft palate: the membrane also lines the buccal plane and the outer side of the gums. On the lips the mucous membrane is thin, but very vascular; whilst on the gums the vascularity is diminished, but the thickness is greatly augmented in consequence of a dense fibrous layer that adheres to the periosteum; the membrane is therefore compound, being fibro-mucous. On the buccal surface it is smooth and soft; an elevated fold, corre- sponding to the anterior edge of the internal pterygoid and ramus of the jaw, signifies the posterior limit of the buccal space: on the palate it is likewise of a com- pound structure, hard, dense, and of considerable thick- ness, a linear depression marking the original symme- trical development of the palate. The glands in con- nexion with this tract are follicular. Some are mere simple involutions of the mucous membrane; others are convoluted in the submucous tissue, but yet simple in constitution, and lined in every case by a prolonga- tion of the common membrane. The Epithelial Covering is strong, and forms a continuous layer, formerly considered cuticular, of which it was conceived the continuation. Like the cu-TONGUE. 287 tide, it may be raised by irritants, forming vesicles si- milar to aphthae; or, again, it may be peeled off in an extensive layer after maceration. This covering has much greater density on the tongue than in any other situation. The Tongue is composed essentially of muscular tis- sue, being similar to the heart in that respect. Its figure is oVal, and corresponds to the space included between the horizontal rami of the inferior maxillary bone. When in the natural and unconstrained posi- tion, it extends from the incisor teeth to the os hy- oides, so that its absolute base is concealed; but if only that portion disclosed when the mouth is opened be considered as representing the figure of the organ, it would then be triangular, the base posteriorly, the apex in front, free on the dorsum, margins, and the anterior third of the inferior surface; it receives an investment from the oral mucous membrane, and is exceedingly moveable,—these motions exercising no inconsiderable influence on the larynx, pharynx, and palate, in conse- quence of the attachments of the organ anteriorly; it is connected to the symphisis menti by the frsenum lin- guas and the genio-hyo-glossi muscles; posteriorly to the epiglottis by the glosso-epiglottidean folds of mu- cous membrane, which are three in number, the cen- tral being the largest; superiorly to the palate by the palato-glossus and mucous membrane; superiorly to the OS hyoides by mucous membrane, a fibrous layer (hyo-glossal membrane), also by the genio-hyo-glossi and inferior linguales muscles. This organ presents margins, surfaces, and a point, for examination. The margins are thick posteriorly, thin and sharp in front; the inferior surface is smooth and concave, with a tri- angular mesial depression continued from the attach- ment of the fr^num, and on either side a longitudinal elevation, formed by the linguales and hyo-glossi mus- cles, the ranine veins being also visible through the mucous membrane. The Dorsum likewise presents amesian raphe, extend- ing from the foramen coscum to the point, where it forms a notch, the depth varying with the tension of the frse- num. In cases where the latter fold is preternaturally288 THE MUSCULAR SYSTEM. short, the notch is occasionally a quarter of an inch in depth. The mucous membrane on this surface should be particularly examined, both with the unassisted eye and also with lens of a low power, as it is extremely dif- ficult to become conversant with its structure without a close investigation. This investment exhibits the several constituents peculiar to its class, namely, a basement membrane, a papillary layer, and an epi- thelial covering; which will be examined in succession. The basement membrane is composed of the two forms of fibrous tissue. Thick, dense, and resisting, it re- ceives the insertions of the superficial muscular fibres, thus assisting in the formation of the skeleton of the or- o-an; while the surface is marked by papillae. These latter consist of two classes, the simple and compound,—the former being found in all situations, the latter restricted to the dorsal region. In order that a proper idea may be formed of them, it is requisite to macerate the organ to remove the epithelial investment: it will then be ob- served that the peculiar organization found in this situa- tion is not wholly dependent on the epidermoid tissue, but that the subjacent basement membrane participates in the modifications of the surface. Simple papilla are found in the largest number on its sides and under surface; also on the dorsum, in the intervals between the filiform and fungiform (compound bodies), but more scattered in the latter situation. Each consists of a pointed or pyriform prolongation of the basement mem- brane, covered by epithelium; some being perforated, representing a follicle containing granular bodies or nucleated cells, a single vascular loop, with nervous fila- ments, completing their organization. Compound pa- pillaj are divided into three varieties,—the filiform, fungiform, and calyciform. Their situation is re- stricted to the dorsum and edges of the tongue, each com- pound papilla being merely an assemblage ot the simple, modified in arrangement according to the variety with which they are connected. The filiform are the most numerous, being as twenty to one in comparison with the other varieties. Each consists of a cylindrical pro- iection, formed of a circularly arranged series of simple papillae; these are fused into each other at the marginsTONGUE. 289 to constitute the wall of the cylinder, but are free at the point, reminding one forcibly of the tentacular arms of the polype; these points vary from sixteen to thirty in number. This circular arrangement is very obvious in the papillae of the sides and apex, but more difficult to be detected in those of the middle re- gion. On further inspection, they present a depression in the central part exactly like a mucous follicle; lo each acuminated extremity of the formative simple pa- pillee a cylinder of epithelium is attached, which is hol- low, the walls being composed of scales of that struc- ture, attached by their edges to form a tubule. These are of different lengths, short, and badly defined at the apex and edges, but long and well-marked in the middle region of the tongue. It is in consequence of these fili- form prolongations that this class of 'papillas has re- ceived its name. Fungiform—These occur at the centre of the organ, and are narrow at the base, dilated at their summits. The simple formative papillas are flattened, the epithe- lium thin, and destitute of filamentous processes. Be- hind the calyciform class there are a few which appear to be a modification of the fungiform; they are sessile, and the simple papilla on their surface are pyriform. Calyciform, or, Papillae Circumvallam, are from twelve to sixteen in number, arranged at the posterior part of the organ in two diverging lines, meeting poste- riorly at the foramen coecum. Each represents a cup, out of the centre of which is evolved a papilla, sometimes ad- herent to the surrounding rim. Both .papilla and margin are beset with simple papillte, which are very much flat- tened; the epithelial investment is thin, and less adhe- rent to these than any of the foregoing forms. Behind this is a V-shaped space, where the tongue is smooth, but irregular, and presents the opening of numerous mucous glands, to which tlie mucous membrane has but a slight adhesion. The use of the compound pa- pillae appears to be gustative sensibility, and this is limited to the point between the foramen coecum and the apex of the organ. For a further description, see Hassal's " Microscopic Anatomy," p. 495. , On raising the mucous membrane from the dorsum 0THE MUSCULAR SYSTEM. 290 of the tongue the muscular structure becomes appa- rent. This tissue is divided into muscles extrinsic and intrinsic: the former have been described as the stylo- glossus, hyo-glossus, genio-hyo-glossus, glosso-pharyn- geus, and the inferior lingualis; the class to which it appertains being doubtful. The intrinsic muscles are, the superior and inferior linguales and the central muscular nucleus. The existence of these can be shown by making a transverse section of the tongue anterior to its centre. Superior Lingualis This is formed by a series of fibres, constituting a continuous layer on the dor- sum, intimately attached to the basement portion of the mucous membrane. Their course is obhquely for- wards and inwards towards the raphe; the internal are short, the external much longer, extending to the pointof the tongue, where they are weak, but posteriorly their thickness sometimes exceeds a quarter of an inch. Lateral Lingualis.—This consists of three sets of fibres. The superficial, most visible at the base, pass downwards and forwards; these are often raised Avith the mucous membrane. Beneath the last a deeper set pass backwards and downwards; these may be seen about the centre: and lastly, some longitudinal fibres, derived from the stylo-glossus, form the deepest layer of this region. Inferior Lingualis.—This fasciculus, lying between the hyo and genio-hyo-glossi on each side, has been described with the extrinsic muscles. As it often takes an origin from the hyoid bone, it may be therefore con- sidered as common to both. Now make a transverse section of the tongue: m the centre will be seen an oval mass, concave below, and of a pale yellowish colour, a whitish septum dividing it into two symmetrical halves; this is the lingual muscular nu- cleus, extending from the os hyoides forwards for about one inch and a half, -superiorly related to the upper lin- gualis, laterally to the stylo and hyo-glossus ; belo w to the inferior lingualis and genio-hyo-glossus. Its fibres are transverse and vertical, and on its superior aspect also longitudinal. When the three folds of mucous mem- brane attaching the tongue to the epiglottis are raised291 LARYNX. and also the membrane in the concavity of the os hy- oides, a ligamentous layer is seen passing from that bone to the lingual nucleus (glosso-hyoid ligament); and deeper in the mesian line, but seen more easily from the inferior surface, between the genio-hyo-glossi, the lingual cartilage appears. This is triangular, the base posteriorly, apex in front; it is, however, incomplete, being pectinated similar to the septum of the penis; we have observed it to be often merely a ligamentous structure, without a vestige of cartilage, and fused with the fatty tissue of the base of the tongue. Three nerves are distributed to this organ; the lingual or ninth to the muscular structure, the glosso-pharyngeal to the mu- cous membrane at the base, and the gustatory to the papillated surface. The lingual branch of the external carotid, the ascending palatine, and tonsillitic arteries, also supply it. The functions of the tongue are numerous and im- portant: first, it is a material agent in mastication, also in deglutition and in the act of sucking, its retraction producing the requisite vacuum; secondly, as an agent in the articulation of sounds; thirdly, the sense of taste is located in its mucous surface. In many animals, as the woodpecker and chamelion, it subserves to the function of prehension; and in reptiles its motions are intimately connected with respiration. THE LARYNX. This organ of natural language in man is situated above the trachea and below the os hyoides, correspond- ing from the third to the fifth cervical vertebrae. Several different structures enter into its composition,—carti- lage, muscle, ligament, mucous membrane, vessels, and nerves, arranged with no slight degree of complexity. The student will, therefore, find great assistance by first studying a dry skeleton before proceeding to the examination of the recent larynx. The natural course to be pursued in the following description will be to describe the cartilages and ligaments; afterwards the muscles and openings of the tube. The larynx consists of eight cartilages, of which four are large and four small. 0 2THE MUSCULAR SYSTEM. 292 The larger are,—the thyroid, cricoid, and two ary- tenoid; the smaller consist of two cornicula and two cuneiform. There is also a fibro-cartilage,—the epi- glottis. Thyroid Cartilage.—Situated at the superior part of the tube, is shield-shaped, but the resemblance to a saddle is much less remote; it is divided into two alse or wings, an angle or body, and four cornua; each ala is somewhat quadrilateral; on the external surface are seen two tubercles, sometimes united by an obhque ridge, the superior situated in front of the base of the upper cornu; the inferior, smaller, one-third from the posterior edge; to the lower margin of the intervening ridge the sterno-thyroid is attached; the thyro-hyoid arises from the superior margin, while the inferior con- strictor takes its origin from both tubercles, and also from a ligamentous arch between them; superiorly and posteriorly two foramina are often seen for the trans- mission of the superior laryngeal nerve and artery, but this is by no means constant. Anteriorly, the alse unite to form the angle or body; more prominent above than below; larger in the male and adult than in the female or child, its greatest development being coincident with the increase of gravity in the voice; it is covered by the skin, fascia, a bursa to facilitate the movements of as- cent and descent, and occasionally by an ascending slip of the thyroid body; the posterior edge is thick and round, covered by mucous membrane, beneath which are the vertical fibres of the stylo-pharyngeus. The superior margin is thin and convex, forming a notch when taken in conjunction with its fellow, that receives the insertion of the stalk of the epiglottis, the thyro- hyoid membrane being also attached in its whole length; the inferior edge is thicker than the preceding, and pre- sents three arches: the largest excavation m the centre forming the superior boundary of the crico-thyroid space, and giving attachment to the crico-thyroid mem- brane; this is bounded on each side by the inferior alar tubercles, and behind these the edge is excavated to form a smaller arch on each side, overhanging the cricoid car- tilage, and receiving the anterior and middle fibres of the crico-thyroid muscle. The posterior edge terminates293 LARYNX. in the superior and inferior cornua. The superior is long, cylindrical, and curved inwards; to the apex the thyro- hyoid ligament is attached; also to the posterior and in- ternal part the stylo and palato-pharyngei muscles; the inferior shorter than the last, but thicker and flatter, also curved forwards, articulates internally and ante- riorly by a plane surface with the side of the cricoid cartilage, and gives attachment anteriorly to the poste- rior fibres of the crico-thyroid muscle, and by its exter- nal surface to the inferior constrictor, which conceals it; to the posterior or inner surface of the angle or po- mum Adami, the stalk-like process of the epiglottis is attached; below this the superior vocal chords; exter- nal and inferior to this the thyro-arytenoid muscle; and lastly, the inferior vocal chord. The internal surface of the ala corresponds from above downwards to the ary- teno-epiglottidean folds of mucous membrane, contain- ing Hilton's muscles, superior vocal chord, thyro-ary- tenoid muscle, sacculus and ventricle of the larynx, inferior vocal chord, external to which is situated the crico-arytenoideus lateralis; also, more posteriorly, to the external angle of the arytenoid cartilage and mucous membrane, with the descending branch of the superior laryngeal nerve. In the child this cartilage is extremely small, nor are the alar tubercles developed until after puberty; previous to that period the surface is smooth, and the whole structure diaphanous. At the period of the maximum development of the male, or the thirty-first year, these tubercles become opaque from ossific depo- sits; and up to a late period of life it is only that por- tion of the cartilage below and behind the oblique ridge which becomes continuously osseous. In the anterior portion, a point or two may be visible at forty years; but after that age the upper and lower edges, also the angle, exhibit well-formed plates; between these, inter- mediate plates may pass through the ala, uniting the upper and lower margins; but in the ala a continuous osseous layer is never seen, even in advanced life. From the remark, that the development of this carti- lage occurs rapidly at the period when the voice is as- suming a grave tone, it might be inferred that its depth depended on the magnitude of the cartilage, but it willTHE MUSCULAR SYSTEM. 294 be constantly observed that persons having an excess of development in this situation exhibit frequently a pe- culiar weakness of voice and high pitch of tone. The su- perior cornua are occasionally observed to be merely ar- ticulated with the ala,—a condition which we have seen in a subject aged thirty-five years,—but the infe- rior cornua are a growth or prolongation from the ala, and therefore they are not at any period moveable. Cricoid Cartilage.—Annular or oval in shape, the cavity which it circumscribes being greater antero-pos- teriorly than transversely; it is situated between the thyroid cartilage and the trachea, forming the most fixed portion of the larynx. The lower edge is horizon- tal, thin, and occasionally irregular, attached to the first tracheal ring by elastic tissue, mucous membrane, and muscular fibres at the posterior part; the upper margin is oblique from above and behind, downwards, and for- wards, so that the posterior surface is at least five times greater in vertical extent than the anterior; commenc- ing this edge in the middle line posteriorly, a small notch is seen, bounded by two tubercles on either side; this is covered by the transverse arytenoidei and mu- cous membrane; the tubercles on either side form the commencement of the articulating surface for the ary- tenoid cartilages. To these we have seen attached, in many subjects, longitudinal arytenoid muscles, and often an origin of the inferior constrictor; the articu- lating surface for the arytenoid cartilage is observed more° externally, convex, looking upwards, forwards, and outwards, its long axis being directed downwards, forwards, and outwards; anterior to this, the crico-ary- tenoideus lateralis muscle arises, and in front ^^c^' vated for about three-quarters of an inch in width, and aives attachment to the crico-thyroid ligament, and bounds inferiorly the crico-thyroid space. The circum- ference is covered anteriorly by the integument and fasciee, and a slip of the thyroid body, usually a little to one side of the middle line; external to this, the con- vex surface gives attachment to the crico-thyroid mus- cle; still farther posteriorly, on a prominent angle, an oval, planiform, articular facette, looking backwards and outwards, receives the inferior cornu of the thyroid car-295 LARYNX. tilage; from this a ridge leads vertically downwards, giving origin to the lower fibres of the inferior con- strictor ; this facette and ridge separates the lateral from the posterior surface of the cricoid •, the posterior surface is marked by a median vertical ridge, to which the lon- gitudinal fibres of the oesophagus are attached; on either side of this it is concave, giving origin to the crico-ary- tenoidei postici; the internal circumference is lined by the mucous membrane of the larynx. This cartilage is much denser and heavier than the thyroid; by its great height posteriorly it compensates for the deficiency of the thyroid in that direction; it forms the basis of the tube, and the most active of the laryngeal muscles are attached to it as their fixed point. Ossific changes oc- cur at a later period than in the thyroid, and are prin- cipally found in the situation of the origin of the crico- thyroid muscle; and in the median vertical ridges, pos- teriorly and laterally, the cavity is somewhat larger than the first ring of the trachea, so that it receives it in the quiescent state. In some rare instances the lower edge is fused with that ring, but a circular indentation always marks their division. Arytenoid Cartilages Two in number, of a tri- angular figure, the base below resting on the cricoid; the apex above surmounted by the cornicula; the base presents an oblique concavity, which articulates with the cricoid; the apex is curved backwards, sometimes united immoveably with the cornicula, or more fre- quently an articulation occurs between them. Of the three suri'aces, one is external; the second, internal; and the third, posterior and superior. The external edge looks forwards and outwards, and gives attachment to the crico-arytenoideus lateralis and mucous membrane, which here contains numerous glands, called arytenoid; this edge at the base is prolonged into a projecting cornu, passing backwards and outwards, into which the crico-arytenoideus posticus is inserted. The inner sur- face looks towards its fellow, and gives origin to the transverse arytenoid muscles. The anterior edge is feebly marked above, more apparent below; it gives at- tachment from above downwards to the aryteno-epiglot- tidean folds and muscles, superior vocal chord, thyro-THE MUSCULAR SYSTEM. 296 arytenoid muscles; and still more inferiorly, the edge is prolonged forwards and inwards, forming a remarkable process, the manubrium, which gives attachment to the inferior vocal chord. The superior surface looks back- Avards, is broad and concave, covered by the arytenoid muscles and mucous membrane; the external surface is separated from the ala of the thyroid by the lateral crico-arytenoid, and above by mucous membrane; the internal surface is merely involved by the proper lining membrane. CoRNicuLA or Capitula of Santorini.—These are two small pyramidal cartilages, directed inwards and backwards, moveable on the arytenoid, rarely fixed, surrounded by the aryteno-epiglottidean folds of mu- cous membrane, and a few fibres of the epiglottidean muscles. Cuneiform Cartilages.—These small bodies are found in the aryteno-epiglottidean folds, just in front of the cornicula; they are sometimes absent, a reddish mass occupying their usual situation; when removed from their situation it is difficult to free them from the investing areolo-fibrous tissue, which has^ led many authors to mistake their natural figure ; it is only after maceration for a short period that a correct opinion can be formed of them; they are are pris- matic, the base above, the long axis directed from be- fore bacKwards. Epiglottis.—A fibro-cartilage, situated above and before the glottis; when examined before any dissection, it appears to be triangular, but on tracing it to the inferior attachment the figure is leaf-shaped; it is pro- perly divisible into two portions,—the superior, free, shaped like the mouth of an ewer, concave on the lingual surface in the vertical direction, and convex trans- versely; the opposite on the laryngeal surface; the inferior or fixed portion is stalk-like, attached below to the notch in the angle of the thyroid cartilage by the thyro-epiglottidean ligament; above to the tongue by- three folds of mucous membrane (glosso-epiglottidean), the central being the larger of the three, and called the frajnum epiglottidis; a yellow elastic lamina also acts as a bond of union in this situation (glosso-epiglot-297 LARYNX. tidean ligament); anteriorly to the concave surface of the OS hyoides, by mucous membrane, areolar tissue, and two yellowish fatty bodies, the so-called epiglotti- dean glands, and, in addition to these, some bands of fibrous tissue are also observed to connect them (hyo- epiglottidean ligaments); and posteriorly to the arytenoid cartilages, by the aryteno-epiglottidean folds of mucous membrane. In the adult it is wide, and notched at the point, in the child narrow and much compressed late- rally; it consists of fibro-cartilage, and is covered by a fine mucous membrane, the laryngeal surface being studded with numerous foramina, the openings of glands which are simple in structure, and have no communi- cation with the so-called epiglottidean gland. The epiglottis is principally for the purpose of defending the irritable surface of the glottis from contact Avith the food in its passage; in man it is a passive organ, depending for its motions on the parts to which it is attached; in deglutition, when the larynx is raised and the tongue retracted, it is forced over the glottis like a coverlid; in the quiescent state the opening is much less than the epiglottis, and the disparity much greater "when that opening is contracted, as during the passage of any matter into the pharynx; except during de- glutition, it is always vertical, leaving the glottis free; in the living subject it is with difficulty seen; but when the finger is passed over the base of the tongue and any attempt made at vomiting, it becomes per- fectly evident to the touch. In children the glottis can even be reached by the finger inti'oduced from the mouth, and if during the attempt the epiglottis be rubbed even roughly, it does not excite coughing or spasm, but the moment the margins of the glottal opening are touched, it excites the greatest suffering; but as far as we could observe in a case where we had occasion to pass the finger downwards to the glottis of a child, it did not appear to exhibit the same irritability either in intensity or continuance that manifests itself in the adult under the influence of contact of foreign matter. Whether these parts were clothed with mucus, and so shielded from the impression of irritation, we are not certain; additional observations would, therefore, seem o .3THE MUSCULAR SYSTEM. 298 requisite to determine the question, which appears of some interest physiologically. The Muscles of the Larynx may be examined after the description of the glottis. This opening is broad anteriorly, narrow posteriorly; bounded in front by the epiglottis, which forms the base, curved, -with the concavity directed backwards; posteriorly by the ary- tenoid cartilages, their cornicula, and a notch which lies between them; laterally by the aryteno-epiglotti- dean folds of mucous membrane, which are lax, con- taining a quantity of loose areolar tissue, permitting of extensive effusion in oedema glottidis. During de- glutition the epiglottis is thrown down upon this open- ing, increasing the security of the aperture against the entrance of foreign bodies; at all other periods it is free to admit of the ingress and egress of atmospheric air. The muscles may be divided into three sets,—two pair anteriorly, crico-thyroid and thyro-arytenoid; two pair posteriorly, crico-arytenoideus posticus and proper ary- tenoid ; three pair laterally, crico-arytenoideus lateralis, aryteno-epiglottideus, and Hilton's muscles, to which may be added the hyo and thyro-epiglottideus. Crico-thyroid,—Triangular in shape, arises from a convex eminence, which occupies the side of the cricoid cartilage; the fibres pass upwards and backwards, and are inserted into the inferior edge and cornu of the thyroid cartilage. Relations It lies on the cricoid and thyroid cartilages, and crico-thyroid articulation, and is covered by the sterno-hyoid, superior thyroid artery, and lateral lobe of the thyroid body, also by the edge of the inferior constrictor, which arches over it; the crico-thyroid membrane lies between them, with the artery of the same name. Action.—1o approximate the anterior edge of the cricoid and thyroid cartilages, and thus make tense the vocal chords, by increasing the distance between their attachments. . Now cut vertically the ala of the thyroid cartilage half-an-inch external to the angle, and turn it back- wards, which will bring into view both the thyro-ary- tenoid and the lateral muscles.299 Thtro-ARYTENOID.—Narrow behind, broad and fleshy before; arises from the posterior surface of the angle of the thyroid; it passes backwards and outwards, and is inserted into the external and anterior side of the ary- tenoid cartilage. Relations.—Externally, the ala of the thyroid carti- lage ; internally, the superior vocal chord; below, a tri- angular space, which separates it from the crico-aryte- noideus lateralis, and above, Hilton's muscle; sometimes this muscle is divided into three or four bands, with cellular intervals between them, but we have never seen the muscle so low as to be in contact with the inferior vocal chord, nor the insertion prolonged into the manu- brium, as stated by some. Action.—To draw downwards and forwards the ary- tenoid cartilages, also to approximate them, diminish- ing the rima by their contraction ; they may force the superior vocal chord into the cavity, rendering it more prominent, but certainly can exert little in- fluence in modifying vibration. Explicable by their anatomical position with reference to the vocal chords, we consider them functionally as a part of the lateral crico-arytenoid, assisting in drawing forwards the outer edge of the arytenoid cartilages, and by this means ap- proximating the manubria and vocal chords, and in that manner contracting the lateral diameter of the rima. Crico-arytenoideus Lateralis.—Triangular, base above and behind, apex below and before; much thicker than the last-described muscle; it arises from the upper and outer edge of the side of the cricoid cartilage, passes upwards and backwards, and is inserted into .the external edge of the base of the arytenoid cartilage. Relations.—Externally it is covered by the crico- thyroid muscle and the thyroid cartilage; internally it is in contact with the true vocal chord and mucous membrane; its lo\ver edge corresponds to the superior margin of the cricoid cartilage, and above to a triangular interval, separating it from the thyro-arytenoid. Action To draw downwards and forwards the ary- tenoid cartilage; to rotate the base so as to turn the manubrium inwards; also to approximate the superior to the inferior vocal chord.300 THE MUSCULAR SYSTEM. Crico-arytenoideus Posticus.—Oval or diamond- shaped; arises from the depression on each side of the posterior vertical ridge on the cricoid cartilage; the fibres pass obliquely upwards, outwards, and forwards, and are inserted by a tendon into the outer angle of the base of the arytenoid cartilage. Relations.—It lies on the cricoid cartilage and crico- arytenoid articulation; it is covered by the mucous membrane, and separated from its fellow by the median ridge and the longitudinal fibres of the oesophagus, and corresponds externally to the origin of the inferior constrictor and inferior laryngeal nerve. Action.—To draw backwards and outwards the ary- tenoid cartilage, producing tension of the vocal chords, and at the same time dilating the rima glottidis in all directions. Proper Arytenoid Muscles.—These are placed on the superior and posterior surface of the arytenoid car- tilages, immediately beneath the mucous membrane. They consist of two layers: the supei'ficial are flat bands that arise from the base of one cartilage, and then pass to the apex of the opposite; sometimes being like- wise attached behind to the upper edge of the cri- coid ; in connexion with these fibres it may be remarked, that superficial to them a distinct band for each side is not unfrequently seen arising from the upper edge of the cricoid, passing upwards and forwards, and inserted into the cornicula of the same side; this may be found on one side only, and sometimes is continuous with the posterior arytenoid. The transverse arytenoid consist of two sets of fibres, the one superficial, ex- tending between the distal edges of opposite cartilages; the deep set between their proximal edges, from base to apex. Relations.—They are covered by the mucous mem- brane, and lie on the arytenoid cartilages. Action The oblique fasciculi approximate directly the cartilages, if not acting in concert with the crico- arytenoideus lateralis; the transverse also rotate the bases of the arytenoid cartilages; thus tending to sepa- rate, not approximate, the vocal chords. The Aryteno-epiglottidean Muscles shoiild beLARYNX. 301 examined by cautiously dissecting off the aryteno-epi- glottidean folds, and raising one layer of mucous mem- brane. They are not easily seen, unless the larynx is quite recent, and they may be divided into the inferior and superior; the former, described by Mr. Hilton, arises narrow from the edge of the arytenoid cartilage, above the superior vocal chord, passes forwards and outwards, expanding, and is inserted into the side of the base of the epiglottis; the sacculus laryngis is inter- nal to it, and a layer of mucous membrane external. Action To compress the sacculus laryngis; but we cannot conceive this to be a separate muscle, as it is frequently united with the thyro-arytenoid. The Superior Aryteno-epiglottideus.—A few fibres arising from the apex of the arytenoid cartilage, bor- dering the sides of the glottis, and inserted into the margin of the epiglottis; this is sometimes absent, and Avhen present, so pale and confounded with the sub- raucous tissue, that it easily escapes observation. There are a few muscles in addition to those already described, but they are without the slightest rudiment in the hu- man subject, and their description is consequently ex- cluded. The superior aperture of the larynx has been already described; and to examine the inferior, let the first ring of the trachea be removed by a transverse section. The lower edge of the cricoid cartilage circumscribes the outlet, which is oval, its long measurement from before backwards. The margin of the cartilage is bevilled off on the internal surface, and although lined by mucous membrane, it permits the first ring of the trachea to glide within it during the quiescent condition of that tube. The distance between the tracheal and glottal orifices is about one inch behind, and an inch and a half in front, the difference depending on the obliquity of the glottis. Now let a section be made through the vertical ridge of the cricoid cartilage, and the sides se- parated, in order to see the vocal chords; these are two in number on each side. The superior is thin and curved, the convexity looking upwards, attached be- hind to the arytenoid cartilage; and before to the posterior surface of the angle of the thyroid; this isTHE MUSCULAR SYSTEM. 302 covered on botli surfaces by mucous membrane; tlie handle of a scalpel can be passed upwards on its exter- nal side from the ventricle, showing the existence of a pouch, which in some cases extends upAvards even to the aryteno-epiglottidean folds of mucous membrane: this is the sacculus laryngis, and is covered externally by Hilton's muscle and the ala of the thyroid cartilage. The inferior vocal chord is thick, strong, and round, attached posteriorly to the manubrium of the aryte- noid, and passing horizontally forwards to the angle of the thyroid, close to its lower edge. If the mucous membrane is now carefully dissected from these liga- ments, and also from the stalk of the epiglottis, it will be seen that these structures are continuous, and that they are composed of elastic tissue with parallel fibres, weak and few in the superior, but forming a strong prismatic cord below. Between the superior and inferior cords the ventricle is seen, of a semilunar shape, curved above, straightbelow: from its superior and anterior part the sacculus proceeds; in this situation a foreign body may lodge, and so be without the influence of the co- lumn of air either entering or leaving the larynx. Now cut off the cricoid cartilage from the thyroid, leaving, however, a ring attached, supporting the basis of the arytenoid; in this manner a view may be obtained of the rima glottidis. This constricted space is situated midway between the glottis and tracheal opening, in fio-ure closely resembling the ace of spades on playing- cards. It commences posteriorly narrow between the manubria of the arytenoid cartilage, this portion occu- pying the posterior third of the space; the anterior portion is triangular, the base behind curved, the con- vexity looking backwards, the apex anteriorly blunted; it is bounded before by the angle of the thyroid carti- latre behind by the basis of the arytenoid and upper edge of the cricoid, laterally by the true vocal chords. This opening is subject to extreme variations m size and fiffure during the varied intonations of the voice, and also during respiration, being dilated during inspiration, and contracted whilst expiration is being performed. Above this the false vocal chords project for a short distance into the laryngeal cavity; but it isquite absurd physiologically303 LARYNX. to consider tliis as an opening of the larynx. The mucous membrane is fine, pale, and soft, covered in its entire ex- tent by ciliated epithelium. At the superior opening it is loosely adherent, but on further descending within the cavity the attachment to the cartilages becomes strict; on this account cedema is of constant occurrence in the neighbourhood of the glottis, but exceedingly rare be- low that point. The ligaments of the larynx are,—the broad and round thyro-hyoid, the crico-thyroid, crico- arytenoid, and thyro-arytenoid; also the inferior, or tra- cheal ligament. Thyro-hyoid Ligament (broad), attached inferiorly to the upper edge of the thyroid cartilage, and supe- riorly to the superior and posterior edge of the os hy- oides; strong in the middle, weak at the sides, where it becomes continuous with the following:— Thyro-hyoid Ligament (round) arises from the su- perior cornu of the thyroid cartilage, and is attached above to the point of the cornu of the os hyoides; a sesamoid bone sometimes exists in this ligament. The broad is pierced by the superior laryngeal nerve and artery; an oval bursa separates it from the posterior surface of the os hyoides, and is covered by the thyro and sterno-hyoid muscles. The round ligament gives attachment to the fibres of the middle constrictor. Crico-thyroid Ligament.—The anterior is broad and diamond-shaped, attached above to the thyroid car- tilage, and below to the cricoid; strong in the middle line, but becoming weaker externally. It is covered by the sterno-hyoid and crico-thyroid muscles, also by the crico-thyroid artery, and is principally made up of elastic tissue. In this space the operation of laryngo- tomy is performed. Lateral Crico-thyroid Ligaments. — A strong but imperfect capsule surrounds the articulation of each inferior cornu of the thyroid with the side of the cricoid cartilage. The fibres are strongest posteriorly, and anteriorly a flat band, formed of elastic tissue, passes forwards from the inferior cornu to the side of the cricoid. "When the former cartilage is depressed, this band is stretched, and its resiliency tends in a great measure to restore it to its former position. When the304 THE MUSCULAR SYSTEM. articulation is opened the surfaces are seen smooth, in consequence of a distinct synovial lining within the ar- ticulation. The crico-thyroid lies in front of the arti- culation, the crico-arytenoideus posticus behind it, and the inferior constrictor covers the external surface. Crico-arytenoid Ligaments consist of an imperfect capsule, the anterior and posterior fibres being the strongest; a synovial lining facilitates the motions of the articulating surfaces, and a strong band of fibres also may be traced downwards from the posterior and external angle under the posterior crico-arytenoid muscle to the inferior cornu of the thyroid cartilage; at its back part occasionally this is strong and well marked. Crico-tracheal Ligament is represented by a plane of elastic tissue, uniting the lower edge of the cricoid cartilage to the first ring of the trachea. Sometimes this is fibro-cartilaginous, or it may be absent, the first ring being fused with the cricoid. Thyro-arytenoid Ligaments have been already de- scribed as the vocal chords; also the ligaments of the epiglottis, with the description of that part. The Larynx is supplied by the superior and inferior laryngeal arteries from the thyroids, also by the supe- rior and inferior laryngeal nerves of the pneumogastric. See Nervous and Vascular Systems. DEEP MUSCLES OF THE FOREPART AND SIDE OF THE NECK. These consist of three pair in front,—longi colli, recti capitis antici majores and minores, those of the late- ral region being,—the scaleni, antici, and postici. _ In order to expose them, the deepest layer of the cervical aponeurosis or prasvertebral fascia must be removed, after having examined its attachments. It comes off superiorly from the basilar process of the occipital bone, passes downwards on the front of the spine, becoming strong and dense inferiorly, on each side coveruig the scaleni and levator anguli scapula, attached below to the superior costa of the scapula and posterior edge ot the cavicle; thus separating the posterior mlerior tri- angle of the neck from the axilla, and constituting the cervico-axillary septum. It is also in intimate connexion305 MUSCLES OF THE NECK. ■.with the first rib, between the anterior and middle sca- i.leni, completing, in this situation, the upper boundary ^ of the thoracic wall, where it is pierced by the branches i.of the brachial plexus in their course to reach the axilla, I as well as the subclavian artery. On these several parts • tubular prolongations are sent, which adhere to and ; strengthen their structure, conferring a degree of resist- l ance calculated to avert the injurious effects of tension, I to which they are liable during extensive movements of Ithe upper extremities. Its physiological relation to the 1 lungs is also of much importance in protecting these (organs from the effects of atmospheric pressure, an ofEce I that, from its peculiar resisting nature, it is perfectly i adequate to sustain. Pathologically considered, the 1 utility of this fascia is tinquestionable; in the cervical 1 region preventing abscess consequent on caries of the ivertebrse becoming diffused amongst the lax areolar I tissue of the neck, whilst the costal portion opposes an (effectual obstacle to the passage of scrofulous collections (of matter into the thoracic cavity, and when the fre- I quency of glandular diseases in this region is remem- 1 bered, with their tendency to impinge on and compress (organs in their vicinity, the advantage resulting from a : resisting wall of fibrous tissue will be at once recognised. LoNGUs Colli.—Narrow and tendinous above, broader 1 and fleshy below; it arises from the sides of the bodies I of the three superior dorsal vertebras, from the stellate Uigament, head and neck of the first rib, also from the t transverse processes of the fourth, fifth, and sixth, the ! bodies and intervertebral substance of the same cervical ivertebrte; it ascends obliquely upwards and inwards in ttwo fasciculi,—an internal and external; the former i arising from the bodies, the latter from the transverse ] processes of the vertebrae, and is inserted tendinous into 1 the forepart of the bodies of the three superior cervical 1 vertebrEe. Relations—The deep surface rests on the spine, the i inner edge is separated from the opposite muscle by t the bodies of the vertebrse and the anterior vaginal li- : gament below; but superiorly they converge and con- ceal these parts. The external margin is separated from t the anterior scalenus by the vertebral artery and in-306 THE MUSCULAR SYSTEM. ferior cervical ganglion of the sympathetic below, but is closely related to the rectus capitus anticus major above: it is covered by the left subclavian, carotid, and aorta on the left side; by the arteria innominata on the right; in the neck, on either side, the subclavians, the common carotids, and jugular veins, pneumogastric and sympathetic nerves, the pharynx, oesophagus, and la- rynx, cover its anterior surface. Action. To bend the neck forwards and to turn it on one side; also to preserve its erect position. Rectus Capitis Anticus Major lies external to the last; it arises from the anterior surface of the trans- verse processes of the third, fourth, fifth, and sixth cer- vical vertebra by tendinous slips; to these succeed fleshy fasciculi, that unite to form a muscular mass, which ascends obliquely upwards and inwards, and is inserted into the cuneiform process of the occipital bone, which is often depressed in this situation. Relations.—Its origin is between the longus colli and the anterior scalenus; it rests on the spine and rectus minor; is covered by the pharynx, internal carotid and jugular vein, pneumogastric, superior la- ryngeal, pharyngeal, and sympathetic nerves, also the ascending pharyngeal artery and vein. Action.---To depress the head and bend it forward. Rectus Capitis Anticus MmoR—In order to see this muscle, let the major be raised and drawn inwards. It is somewhat square, and arises from the anterior half-arch of the atlas, between the anterior crest and the rectus capitis lateralis; the fibres pass upwards and inwards, and are inserted into the cuneiform process posterior and external to the rectus major. .1^ *^^ si- tuation of the insertion of this muscle there is likewise 'Sr«!llt covers tbe ocoipito-atlantoid artic^^^^ lation and broad ligament, and is concealed by the last muscle sympathetic nerve, and jugular vein. ine Tter ma -gin corresponds to the rectus lateralis, from ;~i? separate? by a triangular space — the ninth and suboccipital nerves; the inner edge is separated from the opposite by the anterior or vertical occipito-atlantoid.307 MUSCLES OF THE NECK. Action. To draw the head forwards and to one side; when both act, to bend it directly forwards. Scalenus Anticus occupies the lateral region; tri- angular in figure; arises from the anterior tubercles of the transverse processes of the third, fourth, fifth, and sometimes sixth cervical vertebrse, by tendinous, short slips, that soon become fleshy and thick; passes then downwards, forwards, and outwards, and is inserted by a tendon, about half-an-inch in width, into an oblique crest on the upper surface of the first rib. Relations Anteriorly, sterno-mastoid and omo-hy- oid; also, the posterior surface of the subclavius muscle, subclavian vein, transversalis humeri and colli arteries and veins, phrenic nerve, and ascending cervical artery, with a strong layer of fascia binding the latter parts to its surface. It lies on the subclavian artery, brachial plexus of nerves, cervicalis profunda, and superior in- tercostal arteries, the posterior scalenus, and the lower branches of the cervical plexus; the inner edge is sepa- rated from the longus colli, above by the rectus major, and below by the vertebral artery, veins, inferior cervi- cal ganglion, and the subclavian trunk; the external margin is in contact with the trapezius. Action. To fix the first rib; also to bend the head to one side. Scalenus Posticus, sometimes considered as two mus- cles ; it arises by tendinous slips from the posterior tu- bercles on the transverse processes of all the cervical vertebras, except the first and last; the fibres pass down- wards and outwards, separating into two fasciculi, which are inserted into the first rib behind the subclavian ar- tery ; also into the upper edge of the second; but this attachment is sometimes wanting, and in its place a long slender muscular band passes from that rib to the trans- verse process of the atlas; this may be called the scale- nus posticus minor, to distinguish it from a small band that is brought into view by cutting across the anterior scalenus, and throwing it upwards, when a short but broad fasciculus may be observed arising from the sixth transverse process, and passing downwards and forwards, is inserted into the first rib, separating the subclavian ITHE MUSCULAR SYSTEM. 308 artery and brachial plexus; it is very often absent. It may be called scalenus anticus minor. Relations.—In front, the anterior scalenus, brachial plexus, and subclavian artery, behind, levator angub, scapulae, splenius, transversalis colli, and the cervicalis descendens; externally, serratus magnus,sterno-mastoid, and transversalis colli artery; internally, the first inter- costal layer and rib, cervical vertebrae, and intertrans- verse muscles. It is pierced by the long respiratory nerve. Action Similar to the last. DISSECTION OF THE UPPER EXTREMITY. Directions.—The shoulders of the subject being raised by a block, and the arms elevated to right angles with the side, make an incision through the integument from the sternal end of the clavicle to the ensiform cartilage; also continue the incision backwards on the side of the chest, at right angles to the first; then let a third be car- ried outwards along the clavicle, arching downwards to terminate at the upper third of the arm; reflect the skin, and the following parts are brought into view:— origin of platysma myoides, descending branches of cer- vical plexus of nerves, and the superficial fascia. Superficial Fascia.—A thin sheet of areolo-fibrous tissue; continuous with the similar covering in the contiguous regions; descending from the neck, and pass- ing over the clavicle, it covers the anterior and lateral parts of the thorax; externally it forms the floor ol the axilla; internally, continuous with that of the opposite side and below with the abdominal superficial layer; thick above, thin and indistinct inferiorly, occasionally loaded with fat, and generally so in the female; and with the absence of fatty deposit in the male, there is a more distinct fibrous character, with consequent density and resistance; in the female, it also splits to fonn'a capsu e for the breast, sending processes into the gl'^^f jor its support (ligamenta suspensona); on the clavicle are the uJLlalicular branches of the cei;vical plexus, ong and flat like ribbons; they lie in the struc ure of the fascia beiig destined for tl/e supply of the jl-racic - tegument; a few scattered fibres of the platysma, thatMUSCLES OF THE UPPER EXTREMITY. 309 constitute the origin of this muscle, are also visible, and likewise superficial ramusculi of the thoracic arteries. Let it now be raised, and the great pectoral is seen. Pectoralis Major.—Triangular; base at the ster- num, apex at the humerus; arises by short tendinous fibres from the sternal half of the anterior edge of the clavicle, which is sometimes grooved; from the carti- lages of the second, third, fourth, and fifth ribs, and also from the cartilage and bone of the sixth, these origins being fleshy on the superficial, but tendinous on the deep surface, from the anterior and outer edge of the ster- num, by an aponeurosis that covers the anterior surface of that bone, the fibres of opposite sides decussating ob- liquely ; from these origins the fibres pass in diff"erent directions, the clavicular downwards, backwards, and outwards; the costal obliquely upwards, backwards, and outwards; and the middle, or sternal, outwards and backwards; all converging to be inserted into the ante- rior and outer lip of the bicipital groove; the clavicu- lar passing to the most inferior and anterior part of the tendon; the costal and sternal portions being twisted upwards and backwards behind the clavicular, thus ly- ing superior and posterior to the latter; the tendon like- wise participates in this twisted arrangement. We have once seen a long flat muscular band arising from the ex- ternal insertion of the rectus, and passing upwards on the serratus magnus; then winding beneath the costal fibres of the great pectoral, to be attached to the supe- rior and posterior edge of the tendon of that muscle. Relations.— The upper and outer edge corresponds to the deltoid, from which it is separated by a triangular interval occupied by the cephalic vein, the thoracica hu- meraria artery, lesser pectoral, subclavius, infra-acro- mial artery, with a branch of the anterior thoracic nerve, and at the superior part may be felt the point of the co- xacoid process; the inferior margin forms the anterior fold of the axilla; anteriorly it is covered by the inte- gument, superficial fascia, with origin of platysma and mammary gland; it is also overlapped inferiorlyby the anterior edge of the deltoid, from which the tendon is S'jparated by a bursa, to diminish friction during con-310 THE MUSCULAR SYSTEM. traction. It lies on the clavicle, sternum,_ ribs, inter- costals, lesser pectoral, serratus magnus, axillary vessel, and nerves, coraco-brachialis and biceps muscles. Action.—It will be observed that the clavicular, ster- nal, and costal fibres are distinct and separated by cel- lular spaces, but still the muscle can only act as a whole to press the arm to the side, or if the arm be fixed, it elevates the ribs in forced inspiration; by presenting a soft cushion it protects the superior ribs from fracture, and by the proximity of its insertion to the head ot the humerus, it serves, it would seem, to avert dislocation, not produce it. „ . ^- Cut across the last muscle, and reflect it cautiously, avoiding the superior thoracic artery ; this brings into view the lesser pectoral, the ligamentum bicorne, the biceps, coraco-brachialis, axillary vessels and nerves. Pectoralis Mince.—Triangular in shape, broad and expanded at its origin, narrow at its insertion; arises by short aponeurotic fibres, giving place to three fleshy slips from the third, fourth, and fifth ribs external to the cartilages; the fibres pass upwards, backwards, and outwards, and end in a tendon which is inserted into the internal and anterior edge of the coracoid process; a thin slip passes ofi-from its lower margin to bind down the biceps and coraco-brachialis, assistmg to form the fascia on the inner side of the arm; a second prolonga- tion is continued over the coracoid process, passing through an aperture in the triangular ligament to be- come continuous with the supraspmatus tendon; but this is sometimes absent. ■ r ■ ■k^,,r. Relations.-The upper margm forms the ^"f^rior boun- dary of the space in which the axillary artery lies mits firi sta-e and gives attachment to the expansion of S Vgame'ntlm Lorne, which sends a thin layer over the anterior surface of the muscle; the lower margin Iroiects below the great pectoral.

Eemove the costo-coraco-clavicular ligament from the clavicle; this will expose the small muscle lying beneath that bone. SuBCLAvms Muscle.—Somewhat round; arises by a short tendon from the cartilage and anterior extremity of the first rib; it immediately becomes fleshy, passes upwards, backwards, and outwards, and is inserted into a groove on the under surface of the clavicle as far out as the ridge for the attachment of the trapezoid liga- ment, between which and the conoid it lies. Relations.—Anteriorly to a layer of the costo-coracoid ligament, and the acromial, branch of the thoracia-acro- mialis, and below to the axillary vessels and nerves; behind, to the subclavian vein and the transversalis humeri artery, the posterior layer of the costo-coracoid ligament and insertion of scalenus anticus. Actions.—To fix the first rib; to press the sternal end of the clavicle against the sternum; also to depress the shoulder. The mode in which this muscle is enveloped by a dense fascial sheath prevents its contraction under ordinary circumstances interfering with the circulation in the axillary vessels; but still, by forcibly depressing the shoulder, and contracting the muscle by a voluntary effort, the pulse at the wrist may be rendered almost imperceptible. The student should now remove the fat, areolar tis- sue, and glands from the axilla, referring for the descrip- tion of its contents to the Vascular System. Having done so, let him saw across the clavicle, throw outwards and backwards the arm, in order to examine the follow- ing muscles:— Serratus Magnus.—A thin, flat sheet of muscle, lying on the anterior and lateral part of the thorax, somewhat quadrilateral; the upper margin being the shortest, the anterior the longest; it arises by trian- gular slips from the eight first ribs, external to their cartilages; the two first are tendinous, and often united; the six succeeding fleshy, and much broader than the first; these origins advance forwards as they descend, but the inferior slips are attached most remotely from the312 THE MUSCULAR SYSTEM. cartilages; the fibres pass backwards, the superior and middle almost horizontally, the inferior, thick and con- verging, ascend obliquely; they are inserted mto the in- ternal surface of the superior and inferior angles of the scapula, and in the intermediate space into a strong fas- cia, stretched between these points, lying anterior to the rhomboid, and behind the subscapular muscles. Structural Peculiarities.—muscle consists ot three distinct portions,—superior, middle, and inferior. The superior is triangular, and has its base attached to the first and second ribs, sometimes to the second only, the apex to the superior angle; the middle por- tion weaker than the first, is square, attached anteriorly to the third, fourth, and fifth ribs, and posteriorly_ to the fascial structure at the base of the scapula. The in- ferior division, the strongest and most fleshy, is trian- gular, attached by the base to the sixth, seventh, eighth and ninth ribs, and by the apex to the inferior angle of the scapula. ^ . j u +t,^ Belations—The external surface is covered by the pectorals, the axillary vessels and nerves, by the sca- pular and subscapular muscle, and a lax, areolar tissue which separates them; also the long thoracic nerve and artery, and inferiorly by the latissimus dorsi, internal to wh ch it lies; the internal surface lies m con act with the ribs, intercostals, and the scapular branch of the pos- '"ic'^^T^o drlw'lbrward the scapula and shoulder; if the inferior portion acts alone, it rotates the bone so as to elevate the glenoid cavity, assisting the trapezius by :reversed action; it may also assist --^P-f The student should now examine the thorax and its con- tents —for which, see Anatomt of that cavity.

These con- sist of four layers:—the first being the trapezius and latissimus dor si. Trapezius.—Triangular, base at the spine, apex at the clavicle and scapula; arises by thin aponeurotic fibres from the internal third of the superior curved line on the occipital bone, from the ligamentum nuchse, from the spinous process of the last cervical vertebra, and from similar points of all the dorsal and the su- praspinous ligaments ; the superior fibres pass down- wards, forwards, and outwards; the middle outwards di- rectly; and the inferior upwards, forwards, and out- wards ; the spinal portion ends in a thin tendon, which glides over the commencement of the spine of the sca- pula, from which it is separated by a bursa and a layer of stratiform cartilage; they then are inserted ten- dinous into the spine of the scapula and posterior edge of the acromion; and the occipital portion into the an- terior edge of the external third, sometimes half of the clavicle being united in the latter case to the posterior edge of the sterno-mastoid. The occipital attachment is thin and intimately adherent to the integument; the cer- vical, tendinous, forming the aponeurosis of that region This latter structure is oval, attached in the middle line to the ligamentum nuclree, and to the spinous processes from the fifth cervical to the third dorsal vertebra; the edges are blended with the fleshy fibres of the muscle; the dorsal origin is also tendinous, and is pierced by the small twigs of the intercostal cutaneous arteries and scapular cutaneous, also by cutaneous filaments of the posterior dorsal nerves, but these are at some distance in front of the tendinous origin. Relations,—It is covered by skin and fascia; it lies pTHE MUSCULAR SYSTEM. 314 on the complexus, splenii, levator anguli scapulae, rhom- boids, latissimus dorsi, and supraspinatus muscles; on the occipital artery and great occipital nerve, which pierce it in this region; on the spinal accessory nerve, which strikes its anterior edge above the clavicle; and here also on the transversalis humeri and colli arteries. Action. To raise the shoulder, to draw it backwards, to draw downwards and backwards the occipital bone; both acting, may forcibly throw back the head. Latissimus Dorsi.—Triangular in shape, base at the spine, apex at its insertion. It arises by short tendinous fibres from the spines of the six inferior dorsal and all the lumbar vertebrse, also from the spines of the sa- crum, from the posterior third of the crest of the ilium, and by triangular slips, which indigitate with similar origins of the external oblique from the three last ribs, near to their anterior extremities; the superior fibres pass horizontally; the middle and inferior, with difi"erent deforces of obliquity, outwards ; the muscle then be- comes contracted, but still preserves its flattened form, and glides over the inferior angle of the scapula, from which it sometimes derives an origin, and again may be separated by a bursa; it then lies on the posterior sur- face of the teres major, then twists round its inferior margin to reach its anterior surface, forming a flat ten- don which is inserted into the posterior edge of the bi- cipital groove, and by a continuation, into the bone, as far upwards as the lesser tuberosity, above and before the teres major, from which it is separated by a bursa. Eelations.—lt will be observed that this muscle is attached to the lumbar and sacral vertebm by an apo- neurotic expansion, narrow above, broad below, firmly adherent to the spines of the vertebrae and sacrum, and laterally to the posterior fifth of the crest of the ilium and above this continuous with the fleshy sheet of muscle. It is covered by skin and fascia, by the cuta- neous filaments of the posterior lumbar nerves, and by the trapezius; in the axilla, by the axillary artery, vem and brachial plexus; coraco-brachialis and biceps he on its tendon, and these separate it from the tendon of the gre t pectoral, but still they are connected by a dense aponeurosis, one layer of which smks into the bicipital315 MUSCLES OF THE BACK. P 2 groove to line it; the other passes over the long tendon of the biceps, binding that cord in its situation. As the trapezius and latissimus dorsi diverge as they ap- proach the base of the scapula, there results a trian- gular space in this situation of variable size in different subjects, bounded above by the trapezius, below by the latissimus dorsi, and in front the base is formed by the scapula In this are seen, when a thin fascia is re- moved, the inferior fibres of the rhomboideus major, tendinous slips of the sacro-lumbalis, and the seventh, eighth, and ninth ribs, with their attached intercostals; also the terminating branches of the posterior scapular artery. The anterior or abdominal edge corresponds, between the last rib and the crest of the ilium, to the posterior margin of the external oblique, bounding a triangular space in this situation, where a portion of the internal oblique, and the iliac branches of the internal circumflex artery and ilio-scrotal nerve are seen. We have sometimes observed that this space is absent by the fusion of the margins of the two muscles. It covers the sacrum, the longissimus, sacro-lumbalis, and spinalis dorsi muscles; also the serratus inferior, with the pos- terior dorsal and lumbar nerves, the ribs, the intercos- tals, and teres major. Action—To draw downwards and backwards the shoulders, to rotate the arm inwards and draw it back- wards behind the body, to raise the body as in climbing, and assist in the support of the trunk; probably it may also assist in inspiration. Now cut across the two last-described muscles, and reflect them outwards and inwards, this brings into view the second layer of muscles, consisting of seven, these being similar on both sides of the body, and mutu- ally overlapping each other:—rhomboideus major and minor, levator anguli scapulae, splenius capitis and colli, serratus posticus superior and inferior, rhomboidei—^ divided into a greater and lesser, but sometimes the se- paration does not exist. Rhomboideus MraoR.—Is above; it arises tendinous from the last cervical spinousprocess and ligamentum nu- chas, passes outwards and downwards, and is inserted into the base of the scapula, above the spine. The major arises316 THE MUSCULAR SYSTEM. from the three superior dorsal spines, and passes also out- wards and downwards, and is inserted into the base of the scapula, below the spine, extending to the inferior angle. Eelations.—They are covered by the trapezius, a por- tion of the major being superficial in the triangular space before described, below this by latissimus dorsi. They lie on the splenius capitis, on the serratus posticus superior, and the posterior scapular artery, with the insertion of the serratus magnus. Action.—To rotate the scapula, so as to depress the acro- mion process; also to draw backwards the shoulder; thus assisting the trapezius, and opposing the serratus magnus. Levator Anguli Scapula. —Somewhat round, arises by tendinous slips from the posterior tubercles of the transverse processes of four superior cervical vertebrae; these join the fleshy portion of the muscle obliquely: it then passes downwards and outwards, and is inserted into the superior angle of the scapula, grasp- ing it as far downwards as the spine of that bone. Belations.—ltlies on the cervical nerves, splenius coUi, scalenus posticus, separated from the latter by the pos- terior scapular artery. It is covered by the trapezius, a triangular space being also now visible, where the posterior scapular artery passes, bounded above and m- ternally by the splenius capitis, inferiorly a^d mter- nallv by the rhomboideus minor, and externally by the levator anguli scapula. In this space the artery lies, only covered by the trapezius. _ Action.—To raise the scapula, and rotate it so that the acromion maybe depressed. Cut across the rhomboids and levator anguli scapulae; this will expose the serratus superior and splenius. Serratus Posticus Superior.—Arises by a thm apo- neurotic expansion from the three superior dorsal spines, and also from the ligamentum nuchas; it then becomes fleshy, and is inserted into the second, third and lourth ribs, about an inch external to their angles. These insertions are divided into slips. j r . «r Relations—Covered by the rhomboids, and lies on the splenii, sacro-lumbalis; also on the posterior mter- costals and ribs. It will be observed that the lower317 MUSCLES OF THE BACK. edge of the tendinous origin of this muscle is continu- ous, with a fascial expansion that passes downwards, and unites it to the serratus inferior, through which it becomes connected with the lumbar aponeurosis. Serratus Posticus Inferior.—Arises thin and apo- neurotic from the spines of the three last dorsal and two first lumbar vertebrae, passes outwards and upwards, and is inserted into the ninth, tenth, and eleventh ribs, external to their angles, by fleshy slips. Relations.—Covered by the latissimus dorsi, lies on the lumbar mass of muscles, ribs, and intercostals. Actions.—The serratus superior is a muscle of inspi- ration, acting by raising the ribs; the serratus inferior a muscle of expiration, acting by depressing the ribs. Kaise the serratus superior and examine the splenius. This is usually looked on as two, namely, the splenius capitis and colli, but the separation is often either ab- sent or indistinct; it is therefore preferable to consider it only as one. It arises from the spines of the two or three last cervical and the five first dorsal vertebra?, also from the ligamentum nuchas; the fibres pass ixp- wards, forwards, and outwards, and are inserted into the posterior tubercles of the transverse processes of the four superior cervical vertebrae by tendinous slips, and also into the outer and back part of the mastoid process, and into the occipital bone between the two transverse ridges. Relations—Covered by the trapezius, sterno-mastoid, and serratus superior; lies on complexus, a small por- tion of which is seen above, between the divergent splenii; on the semispinalis colli, the occipital and cer- vicalis profunda arteries, and great occipital nerve. Action.—To bend the head backwards and to one side, and support it in equilibro. The third layer consists of the sacro-lumbalis, lon- gissimus dorsi, spinalis dorsi, cervicalis descendens, tra- chelo-mastoid, and complexus. Clothing the posterior and lateral part of the spine, extending from the sacrum to the last cervical verte- brae, there lies a mass of muscle composed of tendinous and fleshy fasciculi, to which the terms erector spinae or sacro-spinalis have been applied. This is divisible into portions lying in contact from without inwards; some-THE MUSCULAR SYSTEM. 318 times separated with facility, and again they may be so fused as to require an artificial division to correspond with any applicable description: these consist of,—sacro- lumbalis, the mostexternal ;longissimusdorsiin the mid- dle ; and the spinalis dorsi internally. Sacro-lumbalis Narrow above and below, wide in the centre, arises by a broad, strong aponeurosis from the tubercles on the back of the sacrum and its transverse processes, from the posterior spine of the ilium, and the posterior fourth of the crest of that bone, from the spines and oblique processes of all the lumbar and three infe- rior dorsal vertebree; the fibres pass upwards and out- wards, and are inserted by flat tendinous slips into^ a ridge on the posterior surface of the angle of each rib. Now divide the sacro-lumbalis from the longissimus dorsi and turn it outwards, when a series of short apo- neurotic and fleshy fasciculi are seen, about seven in number; we have observed nine. These arise from the upper edge of the angle of each rib, and are inserted into the corresponding tendons of the sacro-lumbalis (musculi accessorii). Longissimus Dorsi Internal to the last, also arises from a strong aponeurosis, which connects it to the ridge and transverse process of the sacrum, and spines and articular eminences of the lumbar vertebrs; it ascends in the vertebral gutter, and is inserted into the articular eminences of all the dorsal vertebra, and ex- ternally by tendinous fasciculi into all the ribs internal to their angles. Spinalis Dorsl—Narrower than the last, and more internal; frequently united to it; arises tendinous from the spines of the three upper lumbar and two last dorsal vertebra, and is inserted into the spines of the remaining dorsal. It has been seen that these muscles have a common origin from a strong layer of tendon, wide below nar- row above, the internal margin straight, and firmly attached to the sacral ridge and lumbar, with three dorsal spines; the external edge curved, weak, attached externally to the transverse processes of the sacrum and posterior superior spine of the ilium; from the upper and outer edge of this the muscles arise; the fibres are319 MUSCLES OF THE BACK. vertical, but interlaced with oblique bands, tending to increase their strength. Relations.—The lumbar mass is covered by the latis- simus dorsi, serratus inferior, the posterior leaf of the lumbar fascia, and the posterior lumbar and intercostal cutaneous nerves. It lies on the middle leaf of the lumbar fascia, which separates it from the quadratus lumborum, also on the bones and intercostals. Action—To support and flex the spine to one side, to bend the body backwards, and depress the ribs. Cervicalis Descendens, or Cervical Portion of the Sacro-lumbalis.—Arises from the five superior ribs, be- tweeen their tubercles and angles; passes upwards and outwards, and ends in four tendons, which are inserted into the transverse processes of the four or five inferior cervical vertebrae; the levator anguli scapulte over- lapping them, and blending with their fibres. Relations.—It lies internal to the sacro-lumbalis, and is covered by the splenii and levator anguli, with the serratus superior. Action.—To bend the neck to one side, and support it erect. Transversalis Colli or Cervicis is seen by turning outwards the longissimus dorsi; it arises from the pos- terior projecting points of the spinous processes of the third, fourth, fifth, and sixth dorsal, and is inserted into the transverse processes of the five inferior cervical vertebrte. Relations.—It is covered by the splenius, levator of the scapula, and longissimus dorsi; it lies on the tra- chelo-mastoideus and complexus. Action—Similar to the last muscle. Trachelo-mastoid is seen by reflecting outwards the transversalis colli; it arises by four flat tendons from the groove between the articular and transverse pro- cesses of the four inferior cervical vertebrae, passes up- wards and outwards, and is inserted into the inner sur- face of the posterior edge of the mastoid process. This muscle is intersected by an oblique tendinous line about its centre; we have seen it inseparably united to the edge of the complexus, when it appeared wanting. Relations.—It lies on the complexus, obliqui, digastric320 THE MUSCULAR SYSTEM. muscles, on the mastoid process and occipital artery, covered by splenius and transversalis colli. Action To rotate the head, and draw it backwards and to one side. CoMPLEXUS Tendinous and bifid below, thick and fleshy above; arises tendinous from the spines of the six superior dorsal, and from the transverse and oblique processes of the four inferior cervical vertebra, passes obliquely upwards and outwards, and is inserted into the rough surface of the occipital bone, between the two transverse ridges, internal to the splenius capi- tis ; the internal portion is first fleshy, and then forms a tendon about two inches in length, to which again succeeds a fleshy belly, the name biventer is some- times applied to it; a second flat longitudinal tendon lies in the middle of the outer portion, from which an irregular tendinous line passes upwards and outwards; sometimes a second digastric fasciculus is observed on the deep surface. Relations.—It is covered by the longissimus dorsi, trapezius, transversalis colli and splenius, occipital artery, and great occipital nerve, which pierces_ the muscle just below its insertion; it lies on the obliqui, the posterior recti, the vertebral artery, cervicalis pro- funda, and posterior jugular vein, which hes deep on the spinalis colli. Action.—To revert the head, and support it erect; also to rotate the atlas on the axis. Eemove the coraplexus, this exposes the fourth layer, which consists of nine muscles, namely, semispmahs colli and dorsi, which together are termed the dorsi-cer- vico-spinalis,—interspinalis, intertransversalis, muitib- dus spinas, the obliqui and recti. DoRSi-CERVico-sPiNALis consists of a series ot ten- dinous and fleshy fasciculi; the dorsal portions arise from the transverse processes of the six inferior dorsal and are inserted into the spines of the five superior and two inferior cervical vertebras. . . v u Cervical PoRTioN.-This consists of six shps, much thicker and stronger than the dorsal; they arise from the oblique processes of the five lower cervical, and are inserted into the spines of all except the atlas. ThisMDSCLES OF THE BACK. 321 p 3 muscle is exceedingly large in quadrupeds, for obvious reasons. Interspinales are bands passing between the spines of the vertebrae; they are double in the neck, absent in the back, but thick in the lumbar region. Intertransverse Muscles.—A double plane, con- sisting of an anterior and a posterior fleshy belly, attached, as their names imply. Between the occipital bone and atlas they are represented by the rectus late- ralis, but this is single; the vertebral artery separates them, also the cervical nerves. We never could detect these fibres in either the dorsal or lumbar regions, where their substitutes are the intertransverse liga- ments. MuLTiFiDUS Spin^ consists of a series of tendinous and fleshy strips, running between the spines and transverse processes of the vertebrse; the highest arises from the spine of the axis, and is inserted into the transverse process of the succeeding vertebrae; a repe- tition of a similar arrangement ensues as far down as the last lumbar spinous process, this last slip being attached to the transverse process of the sacrum. Use.—To extend the spine and produce lateral incli- nation with rotation. The Eecti consist of two muscles on either side, beneath the occipital bone,—namely, the greater and lesser. Rectus Capitis Posticus Major.—Triangular in figure, base above, apex inferiorly; it arises tendinous from the spinous process of the axis; then becoming fleshy, passes upwards, backwards, and outwards, and is inserted into the inferior transverse ridge of the occi- pital bone, close to the mesian line, which is often in- dented, corresponding to its attachment. Relations.—It lies on the axis, atlo-axoid ligament, atlas, and posterior occipito-atlantoid ligament, with the occipital bone, and is covered by the complexus. It is separated from its fellow by the median spine of the occipital bone, recti minores, and a deep slip of the liga- mentum nuchae; externally it corresponds to a triangu- lar space, and the superior oblique, which usually over- laps its insertion.THE MUSCULAR SYSTEM. 322 Action.—To bend the head backwards and to one side; it also may produce slight rotation. Rectus Capitis Posticus Minor—Also triangular, but much smaller than the last; it arises tendinous from the tubercle on the posterior part of the atlas, passes upwards, backwards, and outwards, and is inserted broad, behind the posterior edge of the foramen mag- num. Relations.—It is covered by the complexus, and over- lapped by the greater recti, to which it corresponds ex- ternally, and internally it is separated from that of the opposite side by the deep process of the ligamentum nuchas. Action.—To bend the head backwards. Let the student now examine the ligamentum nuchas; this is a thick, strong band of fibrous tissue, broad su- perficially, narrow at its deep margin, attached supe- riorly to the occipital protuberance, and below to the last cervical spine, where it becomes continuous with the supraspinous ligaments; in the interval between these points it sends slips deeply, which are bifid, to be attached to the spines of the cervical vertebra; the margins give attachment superficially to the cervical aponeurosis, and more deeply to the cervical muscles. Obliquus Capitis Inferior.—Thick, round, and fleshy; arises tendinous from the spine of the axis, im- mediately becomes fleshy, passing upwards and out- wards, to be inserted into the posterior surface of the transverse process of the atlas. Belations.—It lies on the posterior intertransverse muscle between atlas and axis, and conceals the verte- bral artery. It is covered by the complexus and tra- chelo-mastoid, also by the great occipital nerve, which winds round its lower edge to reach the complexus. Action.—To rotate the head to its own side. Obliquus Capitis Superior—Smaller than the last, and somewhat triangular; it arises tendinous from the posterior surface of the transverse process of the atlas; passes upwards, backwards, and outwards, and is in- serted broad into the inferior transverse ridge of the •occipital bone, overlapping the great rectus. Relation It lies on the vertebral artery, occipito-MUSCLES OF THE BACK. 323 atloid ligament, and occipital bone, and is covered by the splenius and complexus, with the occipital artery. Action To draw the head backwards and to one side, but it cannot produce rotation. Between these muscles a triangular space is observed, bounded above by the superior oblique; below, by the in- ferior oblique, the base formed internally by the rectus major, the apex being situated at the transverse process of the atlas; crossing from below upward and inwards is the great occipital nerve, or posterior branch of the se- cond cervical; beneath this a quantity of fat occupies the depression, and when this is removed the vertebral ar- tery becomes visible with the sub-occipital nerve, which is anterior and inferior to the artery, or nearer to the bone; also a branch of communication between the ver- tebral and occipital arteries, and a venous communica- tion between the vessels of the same name. Eectus Capitis Lateralis.—Arises by short ten- dinous fibres from the upper edge of the transverse pro- cess of the atlas for about half-an-inch; its fibres pass upwards and outwards, being inserted tendinous and fleshy into the transverse process of the occipital bone or jugular ridge. Relations.—Anteriorly, jugular vein and spinal acces- sory nerve, which is sometimes behind that vessel; pos- teriorly, vertebral artery and superior oblique; exter- nally, occipital artery; and internally the suboccipital and ninth nerves, which separate it from the rectus capi- tis anticus minor. Action To bend the head on one side. Having thus terminated the description of the dorsal and cervical muscles, we would now strongly recom- mend, that the particular attention of the student should be directed to that space bounded behind by the spinous processes of the lumbar vertebras; above, by the last rib, and inferiorly by the crest of the ilium. It is pro- bable that the subject has only been dissected on one side, and if such has been the case, a vertical incision carried along the spines of the lumbar vertebrae, with a second forwards, corresponding to the lower margin of the last rib as far forward as its cartilaginous extre- mity, and a third in a similar direction, on the crest of324 THE MUSCULAE SYSTEM. the ilium, to the same extent, will form the steps requi- site to examine the superposition of structures in the lumbar region, the study of which has become of some importance as a practical consideration in connexion with the operations of Callisen and Amussat, for creat- ing an artificial anus in cases of rectal obstruction, and certain classes of congenital malformation. When the in- tegument is raised, the superficial fascia is seen thick and strong behind, being attached in this situation to the lumbar spines; passing forwards, it diminishes in density and thickness, generally assuming the laminated condition peculiar to the abdomen in its structure; the last dorsal nerve and posterior branches of the four first lumbar are here observed to pass downwards and for- wards, to reach the skin of the buttock. When this layer is raised, the tendinous origin of the latissimus dorsi is exposed; this, for all practical purposes, constitutes the posterior layer of the lumbar aponeurosis; it is attached to all the lumbar spines, tubercles on the back of the sacrum, three inferior dorsal spines; and externally to the posterior spinous process of the ilium. If now the latissimus dorsi is divided perpendicularly, and the pos- terior portion reflected backwards, it will appear that the aponeurosis of the latissimus dorsi can be raised from the proper lumbar fascia to within an inch and a half of the vertebral spines, but behind that point, both the aponeurosis of the inferior serratus and the latissi- mus are inseparably united with the lumbar fascia, the three having a common attachment to the vertebrae; in fact, it seems as if the latissimus arose between the two fibrous layers to which we have alluded. It follows from this description that the posterior leaf of the aponeurosis is strongest where it binds down the erector spinae mus- cles, which in a perfectly developed subject stand out, forming a rounded longitudinal mass on each side of the vertebrse; it must, therefore, serve to retain them in their proper positions during violent contraction or those sudden movements to which the spine subserves; but at the outer margin of this mass the proper lumbar layer alone exists, covered by the fleshy part of the la- tissimus, and fixed by its attachment above to the pos- terior surface of the last rib external to its angle, and325 LUMBAR REGION. below to the posterior third of the crest of the ilium, and in some cases nearly one-half of that bone. If this is now raised from the vertebrae and thrown forwards, it will be found to be easily detached from the erector, and for one inch anterior to the outer edge of those muscles, some areolar tissue being found in the latter situation ; the structure can still be raised, but not without difficulty to the posterior margin of the internal oblique, to which, and the external, it appears to afford an origin. Structure.—It is the strongest of the three leaves of the lumbar aponeurosis, and consists of fibres that appear to arise as bands from the spines of the vertebrae; these expand in passing forwards, are bound together by others, oblique, vertical, and interlacing ; the strong fibrous sheet resulting from their union is thick behind and below, thin above and before, and is pierced by the pos- terior lumbar cutaneous nerves and arteries. Now raise the outer margin of the erector spinae, and the middle layer of the lumbar fascia is exposed, much weaker than the posterior, from which it is separated by the lumbar mass of muscles posteriorly; then a cellular space, and in front of this, they are in close apposition. On dissec- tion it will be seen attached to the ilium below, last rib above, and transverse processes of the lumbar vertebrae posteriorly. Now endeavour to raise it by dividing its attachment to the transverse processes perpendicularly, and throw it forwards; this separation can only be car- ried to the outer edge of the quadratus lumborum, or three-quarters of an inch external to the erector spinae. Structure.—It arises by flat bands from the lumbar transverse processes; these expand and are again united by interlacing fibres; these latter bound semilunar spaces between the transverse processes, through which the posterior branches of the lumbar arteries and nerves escape; and it is separated from the internal, or deepest layer, by the quadratus lumborum muscle. Now raise the quadratus, and the internal layer becomes visible. It is attached to the lower margin and inner surface of the . last rib above, to the crest of the ilium below, and be- hind to the sides of the bodies of the vertebrae by a seriesTHE MUSCULAE SYSTEM. 326 of loops or arched fasciculi, behind the psoas magnus, and in front of the quadratus lumborura; this consists principally of arched and transverse fibres, and is strong superiorly, where it forms the ligamentum arcuatum ejsternum. It gives attachment vrith the preceding, or middle layer, to the transversalis only, and is covered behind by the quadratus, and in front by the psoas, lumbar arteries, some branches of the lumbar plexus and last dorsal nerves, some fatty cellular tissue, and the ascending colon on the right side, in its lower two- thirds, with the kidney in its upper part; on the left, by the descending colon and kidney, as on the right side. The operation of Callisen, in order to reach the descend- ing colon in the lumbar region, consisted in making a vertical incision along the anterior edge of the quadra- tus lumborum; while that of Amussat differs in some respect, the incision being transverse, commencing about two inches above the crest of the ilium, and carried outwards from the anterior edge of the quadratus lum- borum to the centre of that bone. In either operation, it will be necessary to be acquainted with the probable situation of the outer edge of the quadratus; we have found this to lie at a distance of two inches and a half to two and three-quarters from the spines of the lum- bar vertebrse. It should be borne in mind, that the de- scending colon is often loose and floating below, although perfectly fixed in its two superior thirds; it follows, therefore, the higher that the incision is made, so much greater will be the facility with which the intestine is reached; but again, the kidney may lie so low down that a danger of wounding this organ may result from the attempt to open the colon above the inferior third; the parts cut through in the operation are,—integument, su- perficial fascia, latissimus dorsi, three layers of the lum- bar fascia, some fatty areolar tissue, and then the colon is exposed,—generally uncovered by the peritoneum. This period may be taken advantage of for the pur- pose of examining the proper costal muscles. In order to accomplish it perfectly, a vertical section should be made through the dorsal vertebra3 and sternum; but we would not, however, advise that course at present, as a sufficient idea of these muscles may be obtained byCOSTAL SYSTEM. 327 fracturing the ribs, and turning them outwards, and then tearing off the pleura. The Costal System consists of levatores costarum, intercostals, infracostals, and triangulares sterni mus- cles. Levatokes Costarum consist of twelve pairs of small triangular muscles; each arises from the posterior part of the extreme point of the transverse process of each vertebrse, commencing at the seventh cervical, and ter- minating at the eleventh dorsal; passes downwards and outwards, becoming broader, and is inserted into each rib between the tubercle and angle at its upper edge. Relations.—They are covered by sacro-lumbalis, lon- gissimus dorsi, and serrati, and lie on the external layer of intercostals. Action To elevate the ribs. Intercostales consist of twenty-two pairs, eleven on each side, forming an internal and external layer; they arise from the margin of the rib above, tendinous, and are inserted into the margins of the rib below, also ten- dinous; the fibres of the external run downwards and forwards; those of the internal downwards and back- wards ; in the antero-posterior direction the two layers are of equal extent, the external commencing at the transverse process, or costo-vertebral articulation, and terminating at the cartilage, a strong aponeurotic ex- pansion being substituted as far as the sternum: the in- ternal layer commences at the angle of the rib, and is continued as far as the sternum. The First Intercostal is the widest, and more tendi- nous than any of the succeeding; there occurs a slight di- minution in width as far as the ninth, most evident pos- teriorly, where sometimes they are scarcely visible, es- pecially in old age, on account of the descent of the ribs; the tenth and eleventh are thick and fleshy, wide both behind and before; and in the latter situation we have seen them continuous with the posterior vertical fibres of the internal oblique. Relations Covered anteriorly by the great and lesser pectoral muscles, serratus magnus, and the external ob- lique ; behind by the trapezius, latissimus dorsi and ser- rati ; in contact externally with the pleura, the trian-328 THE MUSCULAR SYSTEM. gularis sterni, and origins of tlae diaphragm, with the insertions of the transversalis; the intercostal vessels and nerves, with a thin tendinous layer, separate them. Infracostales vary in number, and are sometimes absent. These are small fleshy slips that pass from one rib to the other. We have only seen them in connexion with the fourth, fifth, and sixth; they are merely super- ficial portions of the internal intercostals. Action.—To raise the ribs in inspiration. By cutting through the cartilages where they join the ribs, and gently raising them, by tearing down the pleura, a thin muscle is seen, the Triangularis Sterni Symmetrical, arising from the base of the ensiform cartilage and extremity of the ster- num ; passes upwards and outwards, and is inserted by four fleshy slips into the cartilages of the second, third, fourth, and fifth ribs. Relations.—He on the pleura, and are covered by the internal layer of intercostals and internal mam- mary artery. Action—To depress the ribs. Now raise the integument, which has been freed be- fore and behind, from the point of the acromion to the centre of the humerus; remove the layer of fascia in this situation, and the deltoid is exposed. _ _ Deltoid receives its name from its similarity m figure to the Greek letter A inverted; large, thick, and trian- gular ; base above, apex below; arises tendinous from the lower edge of the spine of the scapula, from the poste- rior edtre of the acromion process, and the anterior mar- gin of the external third of the clavicle; the clavicular fibres pass downwards and backwards; the scapular downwards and forwards, and the acromial at first out- wards, then vertically downwards, converging to termi- nate in a tendon by which the muscle is inserted into a V-shaped ridge on the outer side of the humerus at its centre. Sometimes this muscle is divided into three dis- tinct portions, according to its attachments,—acromial scapular, and clavicular; by unravelling its structure it may be resolved into from ten to fifteen triangular fas- ciculi, with their bases above, and their apices below, }MUSCLES OF THE SHOULDER. 329 united by tendinous septa, that form the terminal tendon by their confluence. Relations.—It is covered by the origin of the platysma, a thin layer of fascia derived from the infraspinous apo- neurosis ; also by the supra-acromial branches of the cer- vical plexus, and the circumflex cutaneous, which pierces the posterior fibres; the posterior edge is longer than the anterior, overlapping the infraspinatous muscle; the anterior, shorter and thicker, corresponds to the great pectoral, which it sometimes overlaps; between them the cephalic vein and the humeral thoracic artery, &c.,_ are seen. It conceals and covers the acromion, clavicle, coracoid process, deltoid ligament, origins of biceps, co- raco-brachialis, insertion of lesser pectoral, capsular liga- ment, and insertion of external capsular muscles, the two anterior thirds of the infraspinatous, teres minor and major, or triangular and quadrilateral space, and the parts passing through them; the circumflex arteries, veins, and nerve, long and outer head of the triceps, a large biirsa, and a layer of fascia, separate its deep sur- face from the shoulder-joint; the insertion is embraced by the origins of the brachialis anticus; the anterior edge of the tendon is separated from the pectoral by a bursa. Action.—When the arm lies at the side, the action of the muscle would press it more firmly to the glenoid ca- vity ; the anterior fibres draw it forwards, the posterior backwards, and if the arm be slightly raised it will con- tinue the elevation until the humerus is on a line with the acromion. The integrity of this muscle is essential to the security of the joint, a fact proved by the effect of paralysis consequent on stretching or laceration of the circumflex nerve, when the head of the humerus de- scends to sometimes within an inch from the glenoid ca- vity. It also makes tense the brachial aponeurosis. The ScAPtTLAR Muscles are five in number:—supra and infraspinatous, subscapularis, teres major andminor. SuPRASPiNATua is covered by a layer of fascia, which, with a quantity of fat that varies in amount, separates it from the trapezius. This fascia is attached behind to the base, below to the spine, above to the superior costa of the scapula, and in front it follows the tendonTHE MUSCULAR SYSTEM. 330 of the muscle, and becomes continuous with the capsu- lar ligament. The muscle is triangular, and arises from the supraspinous fossa, and from the fascia that covers it; passing forwards, it ends in a strong tendon that runs beneath the deltoid ligament, then pierces the capsular ligament, and is inserted into the superior of the three facettes on the great tuberosity of the humerus. Relations.—It is covered by the trapezius, fat and fascia, triangular ligament, and it lies on the bone, the supraspinous artery and nerve, and the synovial mem- brane of the joint. Action.—It strengthens the superior and external part of the capsule, raises the humerus, and assists in rota- tion. Sir A. Cooper believes this the principal obsta- cle to the reduction of a dislocation into the axilla. Infraspinatus—Covered in its posterior two-thirds by a strong fascia, attached to the base behind, to the spine of the scapula above, and below to the intermus- cular septum that separates this muscle from the teres minor; at the posterior edge of the deltoid it splits, a layer going on the superficial and deep surfaces of that muscle; raise this, which adheres very loosely; the in- fraspinatus is triangular, arising from the infraspi- nous fossa, and from the fascia which covers it; the inferior fibres pass obliquely outwards, the superior transversely; these terminate in a tendon, which passes beneath the acromion process over the capsular liga- ment, to which it intimately adheres, and occasionally perforates, and is inserted into the middle facette on the great tuberosity. Relations—It is covered by the deltoid, by the fascia, and a few fibres of the latissimus dorsi, near the inferior angle. It lies on the bone, capsular ligament, and the inosculation between the circumflexus scapula and in- fraspinous branch of the suprascapular artery, also on the infraspinous nerve. Action It strengthens the capsule externally, and rotates outwards; it scarcely possesses any power either to elevate or depress the humerus; it is ruptured in dislocation backwards on the infraspinous fossa. Teres Minor.—Also covered by a thin layer of fas- cia; somewhat rounded; arises from a ridge on theMUSCLES OF THE SHOULDER. 331 outer side of the infraspinous groove, and from the ten- dinous septum, which separates it from, and almost in- separably unites it to, the last-described muscle. The fibres pass forwards and outwards, and terminate in a flat tendon, which is inserted into the inferior facette, on the great tuberosity of the humerus. Relations.—It is covered posteriorly by the deltoid, latissimus dorsi, and a thin fascia; anteriorly by the long head of the triceps and the subscapular artery; the outer head of the triceps arises below its insertion. Action—To rotate the arm outwards and depress the humerus when raised, and to fix the head of the bone. Teres Major—Wider behind than before; arises from the ovoid space on the inferior angle of the sca- pula, passes forwards and outwards, and is inserted into the posterior lip of the bicipital groove by a flat tendon, posterior and inferior to the latissimus dorsi. Relations.—It is in contact posteriorly with the latis- simus dorsi, deltoid, and long head of the triceps; anteri- orly with the tendon of the latissimus, the axillary vessels and nerves, and the superior profunda artery: its upper edge is separated from the teres minor by the circum- flexus scapulce and the posterior circumflex artery and nerve, together with the middle head of the triceps. Action.—To draw the arm backwards and inwards, and probably rotate inwards. Subscapularis.—Triangular, thick, and fleshy; arises by fasciculi, three or five in number, from the subsca- pular fossa; the fibres pass forwards and outwards, form a tendon about an inch in width, and is inserted into the lesser tuberosity of the humerus, and the ridge below that point. Relations—It is divided into fasciculi by aponeurotic septa, which adhere to the ridges on the scapular venter: the external surface is in contact with the bone, the inner lip of the glenoid cavity, which it grooves below the coracoid process, and also with the synovial membrane of the joint as it pierces the capsular liga- ment; the internal surface lies in contact with the ser- ratus magnus, which separates it from the ribs, and on the tendon lie the axillary vessels and nerves; the sub- scapular artery and nerve course along the lower margin.THE MUSCULAR SYSTEM. 332 Use.—To rotate inwards; to secure the capsule in- ternally ; it is generally ruptured in dislocation into the axilla, and on its subsequent state of repair depends the future recurrence of the dislocation (Sir A. Cooper). DISSECTION OF THE ARM. Throw down the integument from the back and front of the arm, but at the bend of the elbow be careful to avoid injuring the superficial veins, Avhich are imbedded in the structure of the superficial fascia. These should now.be examined; but it must not be supposed that any individual description will be in all cases applicable to them, as they are subject to frequent variety. The Cephalic Vein is the most external; it com- mences on the back of the hand by a branch from the thumb, one from the index finger and the external ex- tremity of the dorsal venous plexus; it then winds for- wards over the supinator longus tendon, and about the junction of the inferior and middle thirds of thefore-arm, sometimes lower, it receives a branch formed by radi- cles from the ball of the thumb, and also a branch from the median venous plexus, that lies over the annular ligament. During its ascent, it receives cutaneous branches from the outer and back part of the fore-arm; lies at the bend of the elbow, between the tendon of the biceps and supinator longus, then between biceps and triceps, its further ascent being between the deltoid and great pectoral; then turns downwards and pierces the costo-coraco-clavicular ligament, and terminates in the axillary vein. The Basilic arises by a large branch from the in- ternal extremity of the dorsal arch, of which it appears to be the more direct efferent vessel; it then ascends along the posterior surface of the ulnar extensor, then turns forward at the inferior third of the fore-arm, and joins the vein of the fifth finger (vena Salvatella), that commences in the lower and posterior part of that finger; it passes upwards in front of the styloid process of the ulna, and joins the posterior branch. The trunk thus formed passes upwards over the pronator teres, and at the junction of the middle and superior thirds of the arm is333 MUSCLES OF THE ARM, joined by the venae comites of the brachial artery, to constitute the common brachial vein; sometimes it ter- minates in the axillary. The Median Vein commences from the median ve- nous plexus over the annular ligament; it ascends in the middle of the fore-arm, and about an inch below the flexure of the joint it divides into three branches,—me- dian cephalic, median basilic, and mediana profunda. Median Cephalic passes upwards in the depression, between the supinator longus and biceps tendon, and joins the cephalic. Median Basilic.—Crosses the semilunar fascia of the biceps, the origins of the pronators and flexors, and joins the basilic vein. Mediana Profunda sinks deep, piercing the fascia, and then communicates with one of the venae comites of the brachial artery. The internal cutaneous nerve lies superficial to the median basilic; the external cu- taneous is deeper than the median cephalic. When the superficial fascia has been removed, the proper brachial aponeurosis is seen. This fascia is thick internally, thin externally; anteriorly and inter- nally it is formed by an expansion from the great pec- toral tendon and a condensation of the areolar tissue of the axilla, posteriorly and externally by a continuation of the infraspinous fascia and an expansion from the tendons of the teres major and latissimus dorsi ten- dons. Surrounding the arm, it adheres to the inter- condyloid ridges and condyles of the humerus, inti- mately connected to the semilunar fascia of the biceps in front, and to the tendon of the triceps posteriorly. A strong layer separates the muscles on the front from the triceps behind, both on the external and internal sides; these are the intermuscular septa. External Intermuscular Septum commences above, at the outer lip of the bicipital groove, arising from the anterior edge of the tendon of the deltoid, and continues attached to the condyloid ridge as far as the external condyle. This separates the brachialis anticus, the su- pinator longus, extensor carpi radialis longior and bre- vier, from the triceps behind; it is pierced by the spiral nerve and artery.THE MUSCULAR SYSTEM. 334 Internal Intermuscular Septum arises from the in- ner lip of the bicipital groove, passes downwards, cross- ing obliquely the tendon of the coraco-brachialis, which gives fibres to strengthen it, and then descends along the intercondyloid ridge to be attached to the internal condyle. It separates the brachialis anticus from the triceps, and is pierced by the ulnar nerve, inferior pro- funda, and anastomotica magna arteries. The brachial aponeurosis also gives a sheath to the biceps and coraco- brachialis ; it is stronger internally, where it covers the brachial vessels and nerves, than externally. The fibres are circular in direction, some having a spiral tendency; vertical fibres also strengthen the preceding, these being more perceptible anteriorly and posteriorly. The several perforations for the cutaneous nerves are semilunar or arched, but they are never well marked or abrupt, a thin layer being continued from the margin on the nerve as it escapes through the fascia. The Muscles of the Arm consist of the triceps pos- teriorly ; the biceps, coraco-brachialis, and brachialis an- ticus, in front. Biceps Flexor Cubitl—Tendinous above and be- low, fleshy in the middle. It consists of two heads, long and short; the long head arises from the apex of the glenoid cavity, and is seen by dividing the capsule; it then leaves the joint between the tuberosities, and enters the bicipital groove, in which it is bound down by an aponeurosis derived from the teres major and latissimus dorsi behind, and the tendon of the great pectoral in front; this groove is lined by a continuation of the synovial membrane of the joint, which is again reflected on the fibrous walls, as the tendon leaves the groove; a little above the middle of the arm it becomes fleshy, and meets the short head, which arises from the coracoid process, between the coraco-brachialis and triangular ligament; it passes downwards and outwards, and meets with its fellow. The fleshy belly resulting from the union of the two runs in the direction of the humerus, and about one inch and a half above the flexure of the joint it becomes tendinous, forming a superficial aponeurosis and deep tendon. The latter has at first one surface directed forwards, the other back-ilUSCLES OF THE ARM. - 335 wards, but as it sinks deep they become directed inwards and outwards, the edges forwards and backwards, and, on reaching the radius, it is inserted into the posterior part of the tubercle of that bone, separated from its antsrior part by a bursa; the superficial portion is semi- lunar ; it arises broad from the outer edge of the tendon; the fibres first pass downwards, then curve upwards and inwards, and are incorporated with the tendinous origms of the pronators an* flexors, and through them It receives a fixed attachment to the internal condyle. We have sometimes seen this muscle inseparably united to the brachialis anticus, and occasionally only bv a thm slip of fleshy fibres. Relations.—It is covered by the deltoid, great pecto- ral, capsular Lgament, supraspinatus tendon, and bra- chial aponeurosis. The long head lies on the synovial membrane of the joint and bone, the short head on a tew fibres of the coraco-brachialis, on the external cutaneous nerve and subscapular tendon, also on the anterior circumflex artery; the fleshy belly on the brachiahs anticus, the external cutaneous nerve the mner edge overlapping the brachial vessels; the'deep tendon IS between the supinator brevis, which it notches at the inner edge, and the brachialis anticus; the semi- lunar fascia covers the brachial artery, median nerve and the origins of the pronators and flexors; and it separates the median basilic vein from the brachial trunk,_a circumstance which should be recollected in the operation of venesection. anif St'^';Humerus, to supinate the hand, and then flex the fore-arm on the arm.

Action.—To raise the arm, adduct, and rotate out- wards. Brachialis Anticus.—^tuated beneath the biceps, fleshy above, triangular in shape, tendinous below; arises by two fleshy slips, which embrace the insertion of the deltoid, also from the condyloid ridges and the anterior surface of the bone, and the intermuscular septa; the middle fibres pass vertically, the external downwards and inwards, the internal downwards and outwards; they terminate in a tendon which commences on the outer side, broad and thin above, becoming thicker as it descends, and is inserted into an oblique ridge, passing inwards and downwards, commencing at the coronoid process of the ulna. Relations.—The external slip lies between the triceps and deltoid, covered by the external intermuscular septum, and is the longest; the internal between the coraco-brachialis and deltoid. It is covered by the biceps, a small portion being superficial externally, by the brachial and anastomotic artery and veins, ex- ternal cutaneous and median nerves, brachial fascia; it lies on the bone, the anterior ligament of the elbow- joint, to which it is attached by fleshy fibres, and on the coronoid process; the external edge corresponds to the supinator longus, and the extensor carpi radialis longior, separated from them by the musculo-spiral nerve and radial recurrent artery, with anterior branches of the musculo-spiral; the inner edge corresponds to the ulnar nerve, internal intermuscular septum, triceps, and pro- nator radii teres. Action.—1o flex the fore-arm directly; draw it for- wards; also to strengthen the anterior ligament of the elbow-joint; some of its fleshy fibres are attached to this ligament, which draw the synovial membrane out of the joint during flexion. Triceps Extensor Cubiti The only muscle on the337 MUSCLES OF THE ARM. posterior part of the arm, consists of three heads, exter- nal, middle, and internal; the middle or long head arises tendinous from the inferior costa and neck of the scapula; it is also prolonged on the inferior surface of the capsular ligament; it then becomes fleshy, first on its posterior surface, descending between the teres major and minor muscles, on the back of the humerus, but not attached to it; the external head arises narrow and tendi- nous from a ridge terminating the great tuberosity, below the insertion of the teres minor; it continues to arise from the outer side of the bone and external condyloid rido-e, from the external intermuscular septum and external condyle, the fibres ascending from this last point; the internal head arises somewhat tendinous, but narrow, from the inner side of the humerus, commencing below the insertion of the teres major; it continues to adhere to; the bone, and internal condyloid ridge, and to the inner condyle; at the junction of the upper and middle thirds of the arm, the three portions unite, and about three inches above the olecranon they end in a triangular flat tendon, which first gives off a superficial expansion continuous with the fascia of the fore-arm, and then is inserted into the summit of the olecranon process. Relations—The long head has in front the teres ma- jor, and behind the teres minor, further concealed by the deltoid; it is separated from the humerus, first by the posterior circumflex artery and nerve; then by the musculo-spiral nerve and superior profunda artery and the posterior ligament of the elbow-joint; at the posterior edge of the scapular portion, the circumflexus scapulae artery escapes from the axilla; in the rest of Its extent the posterior surface is superficial Exter- nal head is covered in its upper third by the deltoid posteriorly, and externally it is superficial; anteriorly : and internally it is related to the long head and the bone, external intermuscular septum, the musculo-spiral I nerve and artery, which pierce it, the extensor carpi iradiahs longior, and supinator longus. Internal head ns related externally to the bone and long head, the t brachial and inferior profunda arteries, the ulnar nerve ! the coraco-brachialis, intermuscular septum, and bra- ^chiahs anticus; a bursa separates the fascia from the Q338 THE MUSCULAR SYSTEM. superficial expansion of the triceps; a second is inter- posed between the tendon and the olecranon. Action.—To extend the fore-arm, to strengthen the capsular ligament inferiorly, and to draw the arm back- wards ; the sudden action of this muscle may fracture the olecranon, but the ascending fibres, together with the superficial expansion, prevent the amount of sepa- ration of the fragments that might be anticipated; be- tween the long head and the subscapularis the capsular ligament is uncovered in a large extent; and it is here the humerus escapes in axillary dislocation; but we have seen this space commonly strengthened by a band unit- ing the teres major, subscapular, and long head of the triceps. DISSECTION OF THE FORE-ARM. The integument on the front of the fore-arm is fine and thin, loosely adherent to the subjacent fascia, gradually diminishing in thickness towards the annular ligament, as is evidenced by the facility of observing the plexiform arrangement of the veins; passing to the palm of the hand, the integument is thin but dense, and firmly adherent to the fascia beneath, but laterally on the thenar emin- ence (ball of the thumb) and hypo-thenar emmence (ball of little finger) it is much finer and more moveable. Transverse depressions are seen in the palmar integu- ment; one generally commences at the interthenar space, passing downwards, forwards, and outwards; a second passes inwards and upwards from the termination of the last; and a third passes from the anterior third of the hypo-thenar eminence outwards, and generally ends at the base of the middle finger; the first corresponds to the axis of flexion of the metacarpo-carpal articulation of the thumb; the second and third to the axis of flexion of the four fingers as opponents of the thumb; following the skin on the palmar aspect of the fingers, it is dense on the phalanges, but sulcated and fine opposite the angle of flexion of each joint; at the extremities of the finger it is fine and highly organized, but the density is here subject to great variety, influenced m all cases by its being liable to friction or otherwise. On the back ot the fore-arm the skin is somewhat stronger than before.339 MUSCLES OF THE FORE-ARM. extremely fine and moveable on the back of the hand and fingers, terminating in a lunated fold at the root of the nail; ordinary sensibility prevails in this situation, tac- tile on the palmar aspect. Now make an incision along either border, and prolong it on the thenar and hypo-the- nar eminences, also slit the skin along each finger to the extremity; throw this down both on the back and front of the fore-arm and hand; this exposes the superficial fascia, which does not offer any peculiarities, but con- tains in its tissue several plexiform meshes of veins, and also several cutaneous nerves; these are,—on the front, in- ternal cutaneous; external cutaneous; cutaneous branch of the ulnar, to communicate with the internal cuta- neous ; short radial cutaneous from the radial nerve, an inch above the wrist; palmar and thenar cutaneous from the median, two inches above annular ligament;—on the posterior part, spiral cutaneous; posterior branch of ex- ternal cutaneous; radial nerve; and dorsal branch of the ulnar. The fascia, or investing tunic, is continuous before and above with the semilunar fascia of the biceps; behind with the superficial expansion of the triceps; attached to each condyle, to the posterior edge of the ulna its whole length, and below to the annular ligaments, an- terior and posterior. This fascia consists of two sets of fibres, the superficial, longitudinal, the deep, transverse or oblique, stronger behind than before, and increasing gradually in density as it descends towards the wrist; superiorly it gives attachment by its deep surface to the fleshy fibres of the several muscles, sending aponeurotic septa, which insulate and separate them from each other; these form superiorly trumpet-shaped sheaths, which are wide below, and narrow above; a thin layer also passes between the superficial muscles on the front of the fore-arm and the flexor sublimis; a second layer likewise separates the latter from the third or deepest set of flexors; in a similar manner the super- ficial and deep layers of extensors are isolated by a thin process, and the several muscles both anteriorly and posteriorly are surrounded each by a distinct sheath or tubule, that follows its course and figure; the radial and ulnar arteries, with their accompanying nerves also Q 2340 THE MUSCULAR SYSTEM, possess distinct sheaths; but this is only well marked on the ulnar side in the inferior third of the fore-arm. Anterior Annular Ligament—A strong aponeu- rotic band or arch, stretched across the carpus, attached internally to the pisiform and hamulus of the unciform bone, and externally to the trapezium and scaphoid. It is deeper and more defined on the external side, but stronger internally in consequence of a slip sent off from the tendon of the flexor carpi ulnaris to bind down the ulnar nerve and artery; the tendon of this muscle ap- pears to split the ligament in this situation as well as the tendon of the radial flexor externally, but with the latter this arrangement is only exceptional; to its upper edo-e the fascia of the fore-arm is intimately attached; to°its lower margin the palmar aponeurosis adheres, but only to those superficial fibres which have a verti- cal direction; the anterior surface corresponds to the flexor ulnaris and palmaris longus tendons, the ulnar and median cutaneous nerves, superficalis vols, and ulnar arteries; the deep surface completes an osteo-fi- brous canal of communication between the fore-arm and palmar region, bounded behind by the concave anterior aspect of the carpus; it therefore necessarily occurs that the space is semilunar in figure, straight before, hollowed out behind, and gives transmission to the ten- dons of the flexor sublimis, profundus, pollicis, and ra- dialis muscles; the branches of the median and anterior interosseal arteries; the median nerve lying between the superficial and deep flexors. The use of this fibrous arch is to retain the tendons in their position during the contraction of the muscles, and to facilitate their movements a large bursa surrounds them, which will be alluded to hereafter. In the fatty areolar tissue which covers the palmar fascia posteriorly, a small cutaneous muscle is situated, but is not invariably present. _ Palmaris BREVis.—Thin and indistinct; arises from the annular ligament internal to the abductor pollicis, and passes forwards and inwards, being inserted into the superficial surface of the fascia, covering the muscles of the little finger, sometimes continued for some distance posteriorly. It is subcutaneous, and rests on the palmarMUSCLES OF THE FORE-ARM. 341 fascia. We have traced a branch of the median cutaneous nerve into its structure. Palmar Fascia.—Triangular, apex behind, attached to the annular ligament and tendon of palmaris longus muscle; the base, broad and expanded anteriorly,divides into four slips; these at the base of the first phalanx of each finger subdivide, forming an arch over the flexor tendons, the edge being attached to the digital sheaths; each subdivision again splits, one sinking deep to be in- serted into the side of the base of the first phalanx and lateral ligaments, the other becoming continuous with a similar from the next finger, thus producing a trian- gular space between the fingers for the passage of the digital vessels and nerves, with the tendons of the lum- bricales; either margin of the fascia sinks deep, receiv- ing a fixed attachment from the metacarpal bones of the index and fifth fingers, thus separating the muscles of the thumb and little finger from those in the centre of the palmar region. This structure is principally com- posed of longitudinal fibres, except anteriorly, where they are transverse superficially to preserve the inte- grity of the subdivisions. A thin layer of fascia also covers the thenar and hypo-thenar muscles, continuous with the central portion. These fascias adhere closely to the skin which covers them, but are separated from the subjacent parts in the middle region by a variable quantity of fat; by its resis- tance it protects the subjacent nerves and vessels, parti- cularly when made tense by the palmaris longus; by its density it also prevents deep-seated matter from reaching the surface in this direction, as in paronychia palmaris. The Digital .Sheaths are dense planes of fibrous tissue extending from the base of the first phalanx to the last or ungual, attached laterally to the marguis of the bones, thus constituting a canal two-thirds fibrous, one-third osseous, formed by the anterior or concave surface of the phalanges; opposite the flexures this is weak, occasion- ally deficient, so that the synovial membrane protrudes during flexion; posteriorly it is attached to the pal- mar fascia, and anteriorly lost on the insertion of the flexor profundus; the fibres are transverse and remark- ably strong; it contains the superficial and deep flexor tendons, and is lined by a bursal membrane; subfascial342 THE MUSCULAR SYSTEM. inflammation in this situation constitutes one of the most dangerous forms of paronychia, as the matter cannot reach the surface in consequence of the dense covering; it consequently becomes diflPused into the palmar region, and may travel up the fore-arm. Posterior Annular Ligament.—Much weaker than the anterior; depth about half to three-quarters of an inch; arises from the styloid process of the radius, passes downwards and inwards, and is inserted into the pisi- form bone and the fascia covering the styloid process; in its passage across, it adheres to the bony ridges which separate the grooves on the back of the radius; above it is continuous with the fascia of the fore-arm, of which it is a part, merely strengthened by transverse fibres; below with the fascia of the dorsum of the hand; this latter is prolonged over the back of the hand and fingers, is weak, and connected to the subjacent tendons by a fine but lax areolar tissue, that permits with facility the gliding of those tendons on the adjacent smfaces. The muscles to be examined in this region consist of those of the fore-arm and hand; the former are divided into pronators and flexors, occupying the front, and su- pinators and extensors, found on the posterior part. As the origins of these are complex and diflScult, it may here be remarked that the majority of the pronators and flexors are attached to the internal condyle, and the su- pinators and extensors to the external condyle of the humerus. Dissect up the fascia from below, which facilitates its removal for some distance, but superiorly it adheres so intimately to the fleshy fibres beneath, that some diffi- culty will be experienced, and much care required in the dissection, particularly in separating the muscles from each other; this should also be done from below upwards, as it is much easier to separate the tendons than the fleshy bellies. The muscles on the front of the fore-arm are placed in three layers from superficial to deep; those m the first layer are four in number,—pronator radu teres, flexor carpi radialis, palmaris longus, and flexor carpi uloaris; one in the second,—flexor digitorum sublimis; three in the third,—flexor pollicis longus, flexor digito- rum profundus, and pronator quadratus. 11343 MUSCLES OF THE FORE-ARM. Pronator Radii Teres vel Eotundus Round above, flat below, placed obliquely in the upper third of the fore- arm; it arises tendinous and fleshy from the lip of the humerus above the inner condyle, also from that point of bone, from the fascia, and a strong aponeurotic sep- tum, which separates it from the radial flexor; also by a fleshy and tendinous slip from the coronoid process of the ulna, internal to the brachialis anticus; the median nerve passes between those osseous attachments; the fibres pass downwards and outwards, form a flat tendon by which it is inserted into the outer and back part of the radius a little above the centre of that bone; the tendon is first formed on the anterior surface, and is about an inch in length; sometimes the superior half of the insertion is tendinous, the remainder fleshy. Relations.—It lies on the brachialis anticus, the an- terior ulnar recurrent, and ulnar arteries, on the flexor digitorum sublimis, median nerve, and ulnar slip of flexor pollicis longus; it is covered by the semilunar and general investing fascia, by the radial artery and nerve, and the supinator longus, with the extensor carpi radialis longior and brevier muscles; the inner margin corresponds to the flexor carpi radialis, the outer to a triangular space, here overlapping the biceps tendon, brachial artery, and median nerve; the ulnar slip se- parates the median nerve from the ulnar artery. Actions.—First to pronate and then flex the fore-arm; from the favourable angle of its insertion its power is equal to the combined action of the supinators. Flexor Carpi Radialis lies internal to the last; it arises tendinous from the internal condyle and the fascia, with its intermuscular septa; becomes fleshy and passes downwards and outwards; at the junction of the upper and middle thirds of the fore-arm it becomes ten- dinous, and descends beneath the annular ligament, cross- ing obliquely the tendon of the flexor pollicis longus, en- ters a groove in the os trapezium, sometimes common to it and the scaphoid, in which it is bound down by a fibrous layer, the groove being lined by a distinct bursal membrane, then expanding, is inserted into the head of the metacarpal bone of the index finger, sometimes into third metacarpal, and more rarely into a projecting . point on the trapezium.344 THE MUSCULAR SYSTEM. Relations—It is covered by the skin, fascia, and an- nular ligament of the carpus; it lies on the flexor sub- limis, the flexor pollicis tendon and carpus; above, it rests between the pronator radii teres and the palma- ris longus; below, between the radial artery and pal- maris. Action—To flex the carpus and the fore-arm; also, probably, to pronate the hand, Palmaris Longus.—A long, slender muscle; arises tendinous from the inner condyle and intermuscular septa; it forms a round, fleshy belly, becoming tendi- nous at the middle of the fore-arm, at first round, but afterwards flat; it passes downwards and outwards over the annular ligament, into which and the middle divi- sion of the palmar fascia it is inserted. Relations.—It is covered by integuments and fascia; it lies on the flexor sublimis and annular ligament; it is on the ulnar side of the radial flexor in its whole course; it is sometimes wanting. Actions.—To make tense the palmar fascia, flex the fore-arm, and assist in pronation. It is large, strong, and powerful in the monkey tribe for obvious reasons. •Flexor Carpi Ulnaris The most internal of the superficial layer of muscles; arises from the posterior part of the internal condyle, from the inner side of the olecranon; a fascia with transverse fibres unites the two origins, and conceals the ulnar nerve and posterior ulnar recurrent artery, passing between them; it also arises through the intervention of the fascia of the fore-arm, from the superior two-thirds of the posterior edge of the ulna; the fibres pass downwards and forwards, form a tendon on their anterior surface that only ceases to re- ceive fleshy fibres at the annular ligament; it crosses over the annular ligament, and is inserted into the pisi- form bone, and by a vertical slip into the head of the fifth metacarpal bone. Relations.—It is only covered by the fascia, and lies on the ulnar nerve, artery, flexor sublimis, ulna, pro- nator quadratus, and annular ligament, from which a bursa separates it; from the outer edge of this tendon a process passes to the annular ligament, to bind doAvn the ulnar nerve and artery; sometimes this process is considered as a superficial stratum of theligament, which345 MUSCLES OF THE FORE-ARM. •would then be split by the tendon; the bursa of the lat- ter passes beneath the nerve and artery, and sometimes wholly surrounds the former; in the two inferior thirds of the fore-arm this tendon serves as a guide to the ar- tery, but the nerve is always closest to that structure. Actions.—To flex the wrist, the fore-arm on the arm; also to adduct; the power of this muscle is greatly in- creased by the intervention of the pisiform bone, which augments the angle of its insertion; the power is also increased in proportion as the fore-arm is flexed. Flexor Digitorum Stjblimis vel Perforatus is seen bydividingthe superficial muscles that havebeen already described, and constitutes by itself the second layer. It arises tendinous from the inner condyle, inner and ante- rior part of the coronoid process, tendinous and fleshy from the radius between the insertion of the supinator brevis and flexor pollicis, also from the fascia and intermuscular septa; it forms a fleshy belly that shows a tendency to a subdivision into four slips; to these succeed four tendons arranged in pairs,—two anterior for the middle and ring fingers; tv<ro posterior, smaller and often with a fleshy interruption for the index and little finger; these pass beneath the annular ligament in company with the deep flexor, median nerve, and the flexor of the thumb in- volved in a common bursa; diverging from each other in the palm of the hand, at the base of the first pha- lanx, they enter the digital sheath with the deep flexor, and at the middle point of that bone each tendon divides to allow the deep to pass through the slips; then unite posterior to the latter, forming a concavity for their re- ception, and again separating, are inserted into the mar- gins of the second phalanx. Belations.—lt lies on the flexor profundus, ulnar ar- tery, median nerve, which is to its outer edge; on the flexor polhcis, bursa, and phalanges. It is covered by a superficial layer, a strong fascia, annular ligament the digital sheath, and tendons of the deep flexor at the point of insertion. The bursal apparatus in connexion with these tendons requires a distinct description; it com- mences half-an-inch above the annular ligament and extends for fully one inch into the palm of the hand- the anterior surface is connected to the annular liaa- q3 °346 THE MUSCULAR SYSTEM. inent, the posterior to the carpal bones; it envelops the superficial and deep flexors, the median nerve and flexor poUicis; in raising the superficial flexor we have seen frequently trabeculse, passing apparently through the sac of the bursa uniting these muscles; it is shallow where it encloses the flexor of the thumb, but larger where it surrounds the common flexors; in bursal in- flammation in this situation the anatomical arrangement explains the peculiarity of configuration; the swelling being well marked above the wrist, less so in the hand, whilst a depression corresponding to the unyielding an- nular ligament divides the tumour into two unequal portions. The division of the annular ligament to reach the bursa when diseased has been advised (Syme). The muscles in the third layer are seen by dividing the flexor sublimis, and in doing so, avoid the median nerve, which is closely united to its posterior surface; the following are then exposed, three in number,— flexor digitorum profundus, flexor pollicis longus, and pronator quadratus. Flexor Djgitorum Profundus vel Perforans arises fleshy from the inner side of the coronoid process, and the three superior fourths of the anterior surface, and inner edge of the ulna, and by a few fibres from the radius below its tubercle, also from the inner two-thirds of the interosseous membrane; passing downwards, it forms four fleshy slips; to these succeed a corresponding number of tendons, which lie in contact, the three inner being united by areolar tissue, and sometimes tendinous bands, but that for the index finger is always distinct and free; they pass beneath the annular ligament, enve- loped in the carpal bursa, expand in the palm of the hand, giving attachment to the lumbricales, and enter the di- gital sheaths, passing through the superficial flexors, and terminate by being inserted into the ungual phalanges. Relations.—It is covered by the flexor sublimis, the median nerve and median branch of the ulnar artery, by the ulnar artery, which lies above, between it and the flexor sublimis, and below separates it from the flexor ulnaris; also by the annular ligament, the superficial arcli of arteries and nerves, and the digital sheaths; it lies on radius, ulna, pronator quadratus, interosseous347 MUSCLES OF THE FORE-ARM. ligament and vessels, carpus, interossei, phalanges, and insertion of flexor sublimis tendons; the outer edge cor- responds to the flexor pollicis; the inner to the flexor ulnaris. Action.—To flex the last phalanx, also the wrist; the tendons are firmly bound down by the splitting and in- sertion of the superficial flexor; the slip that passes to the index finger can act separately, as it is not closely connected with the others. Flexor Pollicis Longus. —Narrow and fleshy above, tendinous below; arises from the anterior and inner edge of the radius, from the tubercle above to the pronator quad- ratus below, also from the outer third of the interosseous ligament, and from the coronoid process of the ulna by a fleshy slip, which always is adherent to the flexor sub- limis on its deep surface; sometimes it is digastric; the fibres all pass to a tendon formed on the anterior sur- face, thus constituting a semipenniform arrangement; this tendon passes beneath the annular ligament, lying most external in this situation, crosses obliquely the os trapezium, passes next between the two heads of the short flexor, where it is surrounded by a bursa, then between the sesamoid bones at the base of the first pha- lanx, is received into the digital sheath, and is ultimately inserted into the ungual phalanx. Relations.—This muscle is covered by the radial ori- gin of the flexor sublimis, radial artery and nerve, supinator longus, radial flexor tendon, annular liga- ment, outer head of flexor pollicis brevis, and digital sheaths. It lies on the flexor profundus by its coronoid origin, on the radius, interosseous ligament and vessels, carpus, pronator quadratus, inner head of flexor pollicis brevis, and phalanges; the outer edge lies in contact with the supinator longus; internally the tendon is in close proximity with the flexor profundus; and it here presents a peculiar plicated appearance. Action.—To flex the wrist-joint, also the thumb; an action which is increased by the curving around the tra- pezium bone. Next divide the last muscles, which brings into view the— Pronator Quadratus.—Square, as its name implies;348 THE MUSCULAR SYSTEM. arises from the inner edge, anterior surface, and exter- nal margin of the inferior fourth of the ulna; the fibres pass outwards and downwards, to be inserted into the anterior surface and outer edge of the inferior fifth of the radius. Relations.—It is covered by the superficial and deep flexor, ulnar and radial flexors, and radial artery; it lies on the interosseous ligament and bones; the muscular fibres are of different lengths; the superficial being at- tached to the distal edges of the bones, the deep, which are much shorter, to the proximal; a branch of the in- terosseal artery and nerve enters the muscle at the upper edge. Actions.—To pronate the hand, and to preserve the bones in contact; and in that fracture of the radius de- scribed by Mr. Colles it draws the fragments towards the ulna, and thus obliterates the interosseous space. The muscles on the outer side and back of the fore- arm are twelve in number, and are divided into a super- ficial and deep layer; seven in the former, five in the latter; the muscles in the former situation are,—supina- tor radii longus, extensor carpi radialis longior and bre- vior, extensor digitorum communis, extensor minimi digiti, extensor ulnaris, and anconeus; in the latter, the supinator radii brevis, extensor ossis metacarpi pollicis, extensor primi internodii pollicis, extensor secundi in- ternodii pollicis, and the extensor indicis. Supinator Eadii Longus is the most external of the svxperficial layer, and forms the fleshy mass on the outer side of the fore-arm; it arises, commencing narrow and fleshy, below the insertion of the deltoid from the exter- nal condyloid ridge, continuing adherent to the bone to within one inch and a half of the external condyle, also from the intermuscular septum, which separates it from the triceps; it forms a fleshy belly, which descends on the outer side of the elbow-joint, and about the middle of the fore-arin it becomes tendinous, and is inserted into the rough crest, sometimes a depression above the sty- loid process of the radius. Relations.—It is covered by the aponeurosis of the arm and fore-arm; it corresponds internally in the arm to the brachialis anticus and biceps tendon, from which349 MUSCLES OF THE FORE-ARM. it is separated from superficial to deep, by the cephalic vein, external cutaneous and musculo-spiral nerves, ra- dial recurrent, with anterior branches of the musculo- spiral artery; below this it lies on the brachialis, exten- sor carpi radialis longior and brevior, fiexor pollicis, pro- nator teres, and radial artery; the dorsal branch of the radial nerve lies beneath the tendon; the insertion is between the flexor pollicis and the extensor ossis me- tacarpi. In the arm, it has behind it, the external in- termuscular septum and posterior branches of the mus- culo-spiral artery, and triceps: its origin above is sepa- rated from the deltoid by the musculo-spiral nerve, and one head of the brachialis anticus; in the arm sometimes the belly is extremely thin, being flattened by its pres- sure against the brachialis, but in the fore-arm, when this pressure is removed, then it is flattened from before backwards; the inner edge of the belly serves as a guide to cutting down on the brachial artery, at the bend of the elbow, whilst the tendon acts as a similar guide to the radial artery in the fore-arm. Action.—To supinate the hand, when it has been pro- nated, afterwards to flex the fore-arm; its power is greatly augmented by the length of the acting arm of the lever to which it is attached. Reflect this° muscle and expose the— ' Extensor Carpi Radialis Longior.—Arises from a rough triangular space, about one inch and a half in length, into which the external condyloid ridge expands below, also from a tendon common to it and the short extensor, as well as from the external intermuscular septum; it then forms a fleshy belly, which terminates in a tendon above the middle of the fore-arm; after de- scending to the inferior third of the radius, it turns slightly backwards, passes beneath the posterior annu- lar ligament in a groove behind the styloid process, and is inserted flat into the head of the metacarpal bone of the index finger. Relations.—It lies on the humerus, on the extensor carpi radialis brevior, and wrist-joint. It is covered by the supinator longus, crossed obliquely by the extensor ossis metacarpi, and primi internodii pollicis, the radial artery, and the extensor secundi internodii pollicis.350 THE MUSCULAR SYSTEM. Action.—It will extend the fore-arm on the arm, and the wrist on the fore-arm; it also abducts the wrist. Extensor Carpi Radialts Brevior lies beneath the last. It arises tendinous from the external condyle, from a tendon common to it and the last-described mus- cle; it forms a fleshy mass, projecting on each side of the long extensor; at the junction of the upper and mid- dle thirds of the fore-arm, it forms a long flat tendon, which descends, first along the outer side, and then on the posterior part of the radius; passes through a groove common to it and the long extensor, where it is bound down by the posterior annular ligament, and is provided with a bursal membrane; becoming more expanded, the tendon is inserted into the head of the metacarpal bone of the middle finger. Relations.—It is covered by the extensor carpi radialis longior, and the tendons of the extensors of the thumb; it lies on the supinator brevis, on the pronator teres, ra- dius, carpus, and metacarpal bone. Action.—To extend the carpus, also to abduct the hand. Extensor Digitorum Communis lies internal to the last. It arises by a triangular tendon, common to it and the former muscle, from the external condyle, from the fascia which covers it, and the intermuscular septa; forms a thick fleshy belly, somewhat flattened, ending a little below the middle of the fore-arm in four slips; these terminate in a corresponding number of tendons, those for the middle and ring fingers being the larger; the compound tendon then passes through a groove on the back of the radius, provided with a bursa projecting above and below the annular ligament; they now sepa- rate for the four inner fingers; at the head of the meta- carpal bone they are round, and communicate—that for the little finger with that for the ring, and the latter ■ with the middle, the index tendon remaining distinct; on the first phalanx they are wide, and receive the inser- tion of the lumbricales; at the second they divide into three slips, the central one of which is inserted into the anterior extremity of the second phalanx; the lateral run along its sides, and unite on the last, into which they are inserted.MUSCLES OP THE FORE-ARM. 351 Relations—It is covered by the fascia and posterior annular ligament; lies between the extensor minimi di- giti and the short radial extensor, and rests on the su- pinator brevis, the posterior interosseous artery and nerve, the extensors of the thumb and index finger, also on the raditis, wrist, metacarpus, and phalanges. Action.—To extend the phalanges, the wrist-joint, and fore-arm; in consequence of the slip to the index finger being free, it can act separately; but many per- sons can also extend either of the other fingers inde- pendently; this may be acquired by habit. Extensor Minimi Digiti.—Internal to the last; arises narrow and tendinous from the external condyle, from the fibrous septa, which separate it from the com- mon and ulnar extensors; forms a narrow fleshy belly, compressed laterally, succeeded by a small flat tendon below the middle of the fore-arm, which passes on the back of the articulation between the radius and ulna, retained by the posterior annular ligament, and provided with a bursa; it continues its course over the fifth me- tacarpal bone, on which it is retained by a fibrous sheath and synovial membrane; at the head of the me- tacarpal bone it receives a slip from the common ex- tensor, and is inserted into the posterior aspect of the phalanges of the little finger, exactly in a similar man- ner to that muscle. Relations.—It lies on the extensors of the thumb and index finger; the ulna, carpus, metacarpal bone, and phalanges, between the common and ulnar extensors, covered by the fascia and annular ligament. Use—To extend the fifth finger and carpus; it may also slightly adduct the hand. Extensor Carpi Ulnaris arises by a triangular ten- don from the posterior part of the external condyle, from the posterior surface and middle third of the posterior ridge of the ulna; also from the fascia which covers it. The tendon commences in the fleshy structure of the muscle, and at the inferior third it appears on the pos- terior surface, constituting a semipenniform muscle; it runs beneath the posterior annular ligament in an oblique groove, internal and posterior to the styloid process of the ulna, provided with a bursa; passes then behind the wrist-ioint, and increasing somewhat in352 THE MUSCULAR SYSTEM. ■width, is inserted into tlie head of the metacarpal bone of the fifth finger. Relations It is covered by the fascia, annular liga- ment, and lies on the extensors of the thumb and index finger, on the ulna, carpus, and metacarpal bone; above, it is between the anconeus and extensor minimi digiti; below, between the latter and the ulna, with the flexor ulnaris. Action.—To extend the ulnar side of the carpus and the fore-arm; also to assist the flexor ulnaris in ad- ducting the hand. Anconeus Triangular; arises by a distinct flat ten- don from the back part of the external condyle; the fibres pass inwards, the superior transversely, the inferior ob- liquely inwards; in serted by short tendinous fibres into the outer side of the olecranon process, which is here rough and triangular, and into the ulna for about two inches. Relations It is covered by the superficial expansion of the triceps and a bursa; it lies on the ulna, coro- nary ligament of the radius supinator brevis, and poste- rior interosseal recurrent artery, which separates it from that muscle; the upper margin corresponds to the tri- ceps, a cellular interval intervening; the outer edge to the flexor ulnaris. Action.—To extend the elbow-joint, also to draw the synovial membrane out of the angle during extension. It is also stated that it can rotate the arm inwards; but this is obviously a misconception. This niuscle is analogous to the poplitseus in the lower extermity. DEEP LAYER. Supinator Radii Brevis.—A flat muscle, embracing the upper part of the radius; and to examine the at- tachments let the hand be forcibly pronated. It arises from the external condyle, external lateral ligament, with which its tendon is inseparably united; also from the coronary ligament of the radius, from a ridge below the lesser sigmoid cavity of the ulna, and a triangular concave surface behind that ridge; the fibres pass ob- liquely downwards, outwards, and forwards, and are inserted into the external and anterior part of the ra- dius, above and below the tubercle. Relations It lies on tlie bone, coronary, external,353 MUSCLES OF THE FORE-ARM. lateral, and interosseous ligaments, and it is covered ex- ternally by the supinator longus, extensor carpi radia- lis longior and brevior, and the posterior interosseous nerve, which pierces its external fibres; it is covered posteriorly by the anconeus, extensor ulnaris, minimi digiti, and communis, also by the posterior interosseus recurrent artery; anteriorly by the inner edge of the supinator longus, radial artery, nerve, and pronator radii teres. The biceps tendon notches the inner edge of the muscle; sometimes the superior portion is altogether tendinous, and the fleshy fibres are only seen on the anterior part. Action.—To extend the fore-arm, to roll the radius outwards, and when it is fleshy above to make tense the coronary ligament of the radius. Extensor Ossis Metacarpi Pollicis Arises from the posterior and inner part of the ulna below the an- coneus, from the posterior surface of the radius below the supinator brevis, and from the interosseus ligament; the tendinous origin ends immediately in a fleshy belly, which is flat on the deep surface; it passes obliquely downwards and outwards, and terminates in a tendon, which runs at first outwards and then vertically on the outer edge of the radius; it then is received into a groove in front of the styloid process, where it is bound down by a strong fibrous sheath, lined by a bursa; pass- ing next over the anterior edge of the external lateral ligament, it divides into two slips, the stronger of which is inserted into the head of the metacarpal bone of the thumb, the narrower into the trapezium bone. Relations.—It is covered by the superficial layer of muscles, but below it lies merely under the fascia. It rests on the ulna, interosseous membrane, radiiis, radial extensors, radial artery, and external lateral ligament of the wrist-joint. Extensor Primi Internodit Pollicis, or, the Exten- sor of the First Joint of the Thumb, lies internal to the last muscle, to which it is intimately connected. It arises tendinous from the ulna, interosseous ligament, and receives a few fibres from the radius below the ex- tensor ossis metacarpi; it then becomes fleshy, and passes obliquely downwards and forwards; ends in a ten-354 THE MUSCULAE SYSTEM. don that pursues a similar course; is received into the same groove with the extensor ossis, but separated from it by a septum; then it passes over the back of the metacarpal bone, and is inserted into the base of the first phalanx of the thumb. Relations.—These are the same as the last muscle. Action To abduct the thumb and wrist-joint, which it also extends, while the extensor primi internodii, in addition, extends the first phalanx of the thumb. Extensor Secundi Internodii Pollicis,—Narrow and shorter than the last; arises from the outer surface of the ulna, internal and inferior to the extensor primi, and from the interosseous membrane, and the strong septum which separates it from the extensor indicis; ends in a fleshy belly, to which succeeds a tendon, very low down, that enters a distinct groove in the radius, bound down by the posterior annular ligament, and lu- bricated by a bursa; next crosses the radial extensors, the first interosseous space, then the metacarpal bone of the thumb, the first phalanx, and terminates by being inserted into the last or ungual phalanx. Relations These are similar to the former, but it is much longer than it, as the insertion is advanced to the last joint. Action.—Similar to the extensor primi, but, in addi- tion, extends the last phalanx of the thumb. Extensor Indicis.—Internal to the last; arises from the outer and back part of the ulna, the interosseous ligament, and intermuscular septum; forms a fleshy belly, terminating in a tendon at the annular ligament, enters the groove for the extensor communis, lying between that tendon and the extensor secundi inter- nodii pollicis, passes over the carpus and second in- terosseous space, and at the anterior extremity of the metacarpal bone it joins the outer tendon of the exten- sor communis, with which it is inserted into the second and third phalanges. Relations.—It is covered by the superficial layer and interosseous vessels and nerves; it lies on the ulna, m- terosseous membrane, radius, carpus, first dorsal inter- osseous muscle, near its back part, and lastly, on the phalanges.355 MUSCLES OF THE HAND. Action.—To extend the wrist, and independently the index finger. The muscles of the palm of the hand are divided into those of the thumb (thenar), of the little finger (hypo- thenar), of the centre (palmar proper). The muscles of the thumb are five in number,—abductor pollicis, op- I ponens pollicis (flexor ossis metacarpi), flexor pollicis i brevis, adductor pollicis, and the abductor indicis. Abductor Pollicis arises, tendinous and aponeu- I rotic, from the annular ligament, the scaphoid bone, and t from that portion of the trapezium which receives the i insertion of the extensor ossis metacarpi; it passes for- ' ward, outwards, and downwards, forms a flat tendon, ' which is inserted into the outer and back part of the i first phalanx of the thumb. Relations.—It is covered by the outer portion of pal- : mar fascia, and lies on the opponens, separated from it ; by a thin fascia; the arteria superficialis volse perfo- : rates its origin, but this does not always occur. Action—To draw the thumb forwards and inwards; lit would be therefore more correct to call it an adduc- ttor. Opponens Pollicis, or Flexor Ossis Metacarpi.— 'Triangular, thick, and fleshy; arises from the trape- 2zium bone and annular ligament, close to its attachment tto that bone; the superior fibres pass horizontally, the cothers downwards and outwards, and are inserted into I the inner edge of the whole length of the metacarpal tbone of the thumb, extending as far as the base of the ffirst phalanx. Relations—It lies beneath the abductor and fascia, :iand rests on the first carpo-metacarpal articulation and tthe metacarpal bone; the inner edge corresponds to the iflexor brevis. Action.—To flex the metacarpal bone, and thus anta- jgonize the extensor. Flexor Pollicis Brevis.—To see the inner head of tthis muscle, the outer tendon of the long flexors must tbe removed, and drawn inwards with the lumbricales; :it consists of two heads,—an external and internal. The I'former arises from the scaphoid, trapezium, and annular I ligament; the latter, which is deeper, from the sheathTHE MUSCULAR SYSTEM. 356 of the radial flexor, os magnum, and head of the me- tacarpal bone of the middle finger. The two heads proceed towards the base of the first phalanx, become tendinous, and are inserted into the sesamoid bones, and, crossing these obliquely, into the base of the first phalanx. Relations.—The outer head is covered above by the abductor, but below is superficial; the inner head is covered by the flexor tendon and bursa. The long flexor tendon lies between the two portions; the outer head rests on the abductor indicis and radial artery, the inner on the first palmar interosseous, metacarpal bone, on the radialis indicis, princeps pollicis, and palmaris pro- funda arteries. Action.—1o flex the first phalanx and metacarpal bones. Adductoe Pollicis lies below the inner head of the short flexor, but on the same plane; it is triangular. The base at its origin arises from the inferior three- fourths, sometimes less, of the anterior surface of the middle metacarpal bone; the fibres pass outwards, con- verging, and are inserted tendinous into the inner sesa- moid bone and the base of the first phalanx. Relations It is covered by the two outer tendons of the flexor sublimis and profundus, lurabricales,_ branches of the median nerve, and a thin fascia. It lies on the metacarpal bones of the middle and index fingers, and corresponding interosseous muscle, on the abductor in- dicis and terminal branches of the radial artery; the upper edge corresponds to the inner head of the short flexor, with which it is sometimes united; the lower is round and fleshy, and projects beyond the abductor in- dicis, on the external side of the cleft between the thumb and index finger. The palmaris profunda artery passes between its upper edge and the flexor polhcis. This muscle is considered by some anatomists as the first palmar interosseus. Action.—1o adduct the thumb. Abductor Indicis is seen on the back of the clett; triangular, like the last-described muscle; arises tendi- nous and fleshy from the posterior third of the meta- carpal bone of the thumb, and from the entire of the357 MUSCLES OF THE HAND. outer edge of the metacarpal bone of the index finger; the fibres pass upwards from the latter, and upwards and outwards from the former, to be inserted tendinous into the outer side of the base of the first phalanx of the second finger. Relations—It has anterior to it the adductor and flexor pollicis brevis muscles, and the termination of the radial artery. The posterior surface is covered by integuments and extensor secundi internodii pollicis; its two origins are separated by the radial artery and veins. Action.—To abduct the index finger and to adduct the thumb; this muscle is also considered to be the first dorsal interosseous. The muscles of the hypo-thenar region are three in number, namely, the abductor minimi digiti, flexor brevis, and adductor minimi digiti. Abductor Minimi Digiti arises tendinous from the pisiform bone, annular ligament, and the insertion of the ulnar flexor tendon; it passes downwards, and is inserted by a short tendon into the base of the first phalanx. Relations.—It is superficial, and lies on the flexor brevis, a portion of which is seen at its outer edge. Action.—As its name implies; but as it moves the little finger towards the middle line; it would be more properly named an adductor. Flexor Minimi Digiti Brevis Sometimes want- ing; lies to the outer edge of the last; arises tendinous from the unciform bone and annular ligament; it passes downwards, and is inserted by a flat tendon into the base of the first phalanx. Relations—It is overlapped by the preceding muscle, and lies on the adductor; the ulnar artery and nerve separate its origin from the abductor. Action.—To flex, with but slight power. Adductor or Opponens arises from the hamulus of the unciform bone and annular ligament; the fibres pass inwards and forwards, and are inserted into the whole length of the metacarpal bone of the fifth finger. Relations.—It is covered by the two former muscles.1 358 THE MUSCULAR SYSTEM. the ulnar nerve and artery, and it lies on the internal interosseous and metacarpal bone. Action To adduct with reference to the axis of the hand, but the opposite with regard to the middle line. LuMBKicALES are four in number, situated on the middle palmar space; each arises fleshy from the radial side of the corresponding tendon of the flexor profun- dus ; the two external also from the anterior surface; they pass downwards, terminate in round tendons, which run through the osteo-fibrous canal, between the heads of the metacarpal bones, in company with, but pos- terior to, the digital vessels and nerves, and surrounded by a bursa; the tendon then becomes flattened, passmg obliquely backwards, to be inserted, broad and expanded, into the extensor tendons on the back of the first pha- lanx of each finger. Eelations.—Thej lie on and between the flexor ten- dons, behind the digital nerves and vessels, and m front of the interossei. , Action —To flex the first phalanx, also to keep the extensor tendons closely applied to the posterior aspect of the phalanges, acting in lieu of a sheath. _ Now throw forwards the flexor tendons with the superficial arteries and nerves, provided the latter have been fully examined; also the extensor tendons from the posterior aspect, preparatory to the dissection of the interossei, which are as yet covered by a strong aponeu- rosis, common to them and the deep palmar vessels. Deep Palmar ApoNEUROsis.-This is irregular in shape, sometimes triangular, or it may be oblong; it is attached behind to the anterior carpal ligaments, which it covers, their oblique fibres being visible through its semitransparent tissue, and the posterior layer of the carpal bursa, which is inseparable from it; passing for- wards, it adheres to the ridges of the metacarpal bones; Txternally separating the adductor polhcis from th external interosseous muscle; internally the adductor mhiTmi digiti, from the internal interosseous; anteriorly ™es to the heads of the -^taca^l-/^^^exor the'c"• tinuous with the deep half segment of ^^^^ A^^^^^^^^^^^ here it is exceedingly dense and thick; in the intervalMUSCLES OF THE HAND. 359 between the metacarpal bones it sends a process on the lumbricales tendons, which separates them from the interossei, and immediately posterior to this is pierced by the reinforcing branches of the deep palmar arch of arteries, then becoming continuous at the sides of the phalanges with the superficial palmar fascia. It follows that these represent a glove containing in the cavity the flexor tendons and the lumbricales, each with a sheath derived from the superficial surface of the deep layer, also the superficial palmar arteries and nerves, and carpal bursa; the digital sheaths represent the fingers, and the intervals between them transmit the lumbricales and digital vessels and nerves. Its use is to preserve the position of the interossei; and further, to avert dis- placement of the metacarpal bones; its density explains the fact that matter cannot escape between the inter- ossei when situated in the palm of the hand, which it might otherwise do in the interval between the two sets of these muscles; this we describe as a distinct structure, conceiving its surgical importance to be as great as the superficial layer. Separate now the anterior extremities of the meta- carpal bones by a slight cut, and tear them asunder; the interossei are four behind, and a similar number in front, the former being the dorsal, the latter the palmar; but in both situations, to include four, the adductor poUicis in front, with the abductor indicis behind, must be considered as interossei; these have been described with the muscles of the thumb in a former section. Posterior Interossei.—These are bicipital muscles, and arise between the metacarpal bones of the four outer fingers; they spring by one side from the poste- rior and outer edge of the external and all the internal surface of the inner metacarpal bone, pass forwards, terminate in a tendon at the metacarpo-pharyngeal articulation, and are inserted, the two outer into the radial side of the first phalanx of the index and middle fingers, and also into the extensor tendons on the dor- sal aspect; the two internal into the ulnar side of the middle and ring fingers and extensor tendons. Use.—Ho adduct the fingers to a supposed mesian line, corresponding to the middle finger.360 THE MUSCULAR SYSTEM. Anterior Interossei arise from the metacarpal bones on the same side to which they are attached; form a fleshy mass, with a penniform arrangement of the fibres and terminate in tendons which are inserted, the two outer into the ulnar side of the first phalanx, and the two inner into the radial side of a similar point, and also into the extensor tendons; these he on the dorsal interossei which appear at their margins; per- forating branches of the deep palmar arch pass between them It will now be seen that the posterior interossei are adductors with reference to the mesian line of the hand. DISSECTION OF THE LOWER EXTREMITY. Let the subject, placed on the back, be raised by a block beneath the loins, in order to render the muscles of the anterior abdominal region tense; the latter term is applied to that portion of the trunk extending between the ensiform cartilage and pubis, varying m comparative lenc^th at different periods of life,-in the infant forming one°third of the entire extent of the subject, but in adult life a comparative diminution occurs, at this period constituting one-fifth, the difference being attributable not to any absolute shortening of the cavity but to thp increase in the extent of the lower extremities and hox^x exce ding that of the abdomen. The anterior abdominar egio? is bounded above by the ensiform cartiSge, cos?o-xiphoid ligament cartilage of the las ^rue and all the false ribs, with the last rib in its entire length; inferiorly by the crest of the ihum, Pou- part's ligament, crest, and symphisis pubis; and poste- riorly by the anterior edge of the latissunus dorsi. If the abdominal wall was carefully dissected from its attach- ment and extended, it would resemble m its outline a It ulL period of Ufe. The relative prominence of theABDOMINAL REGION. 361 space also differs with age; in the infant it is exceed- ingly convex, because the cavity contains the bladder and Its appendages, suprarenal capsules, together with the liver, an organ of great size at this period; but •with the descent of the bladder, the gradual diminu- tion of the hver, the absorption of the suprarenal bodies,—the hypochondrias lose their convexity and assume a slight concavity, visible below the cartila-es of the ribs ; the remainder of the cavity being also less distended. But when middle and old age appear It becomes again tense and prominent, in consequence ot tatty depositions within the omentum and mesen- ' tery,_facts that account for the greater frequency of hernial protrusions in infancy and old a^^e The ABDOMEN is divided into regions or zones, each having Its peculiar organs; an acquaintance with these subdivisions and the corresponding contents is of g-reat importance in guiding the prognosis of the surgeon in wounds penetrating its cavity. Region of the Abdomen—TMs region is divided into three zones :-the epigastric, mesogastric, and hy- pogastric. In order to map out these surfaces, certain lines are drawn encircling the trunk; the first would strike the base of the ensiform cartilage in front, and the spine of the tenth dorsal vertebra posteriorly sig- nifying the junction of the chest and abdomen the second surrounds the abdomen on a level with the car- tilage of the ninth rib, constituting the epigastric zone- of theiha, circumscribes the mesogastric region, whilst below It exists the hypogastric; if a line be^now Zvn from the cartilage of the ninth rib of each side above o the corresponding ilio-pubal eminences below, th^ three regions named will be again subdivided into nine the superior presenting the right and left hypochondria on each side, and the epigastric or scrobiculus cordis m the centre The epigastric region is triangular, with the base below, the sides formed by the arch ^f the seventh, eighth, and ninth ribs, the ensiform canilagc' projecting in its centre which is called scrobiculus cor- dis; it contams the left lobe of the liver and the sto xnach; more posteriorly the aorta, c<.liac axis, and solar362 THE MUSCULAR SYSTEM. plextis, pancreas, cava, and portse. The hypochondriac regions lie beneath the last true and five false ribs, bounded below by the lumbar regions; the right con- tains the liver and suprarenal capsule, hepatic flexure of colon, pylorus, and duodenum •, also the upper part of the kidney, suprarenal capsule, vena porta, cava, and hepatic vessels; the left contains the spleen, the great extremity of the stomach, splenic vessels, and splenic flexure of the colon, upper part of the left kidney, and su- prarenal capsule, together with the tail of the pancreas. The mesogastric region is divided into the right and left lumbar on each side, and the umbilical in the centre; the right lumbar contains the ascending colon, the kidney, and renal vessels, and in fffital life the testicles; in the left lie the descending colon, kidney, and renal vessels, also the testicle in early life; the umbilical contains the transverse colon and mesocolon, inferior transverse portion of the duodenum, and root of the mesentery. The inferior region is likewise subdivided into the right and left iliacs on each side, the hypogastric occupying the centre; the right iliac contains the ctecum, vermi- form process, the termination of the ilium, and fre- quently the convolutions of the small intestines; in the left lie the sigmoid flexure of the colon, commencement of the rectum, the lower and left extremities of the epi- ploon, with some convolutions of the small intestines; the middle or hypogastric region contains the small in- testines, great omentum or epiploon, and in fcetal life and infancy the bladder. There havebeen also described three in addition, as right and left inguinal and pubic; these more properly belong to the pelvic region, but here it may be stated that the inguinal contain the spermatic cords, inguinal peritoneal pouches, and hypogastric and epigas- tric arteries; in the pubic lie the bladder with its appen- dages, and the urachus. Although we have described the several divisions of the abdomen in this position, pre- (leding the anatomy of the contained organs, we would in nowise desire the junior student to dwell on this de- scription until he previously becomes in some degree con- versant with the size, position, and attachments ot the viscera, as then only will he be able to ;ippreciate the practical utility of the regional study of the abdomen.363 MUSCLES OF THE ABDOMEN. R 2 The Superficial Muscles of the Abdomen consist of five pair,—namely, external oblique, internal oblique, transversalis abdominis, rectus, and pyramidalis. Make an incision from the ensiform cartilage to the pubis, and from the middle line to the anterior superior spinous process ; then reflect the flaps. Superficial Fascia—This subcutaneous layer is continuous with the similar structure of the regions in the vicinity; thin above; strong and laminated in- feriorly, containing a variable quantity of fat; white pale bands are seen traversing its structure; these are believed to have many characters in common with the unstriped muscle, but it is probable that they are simply fibrous tissue condensed into fesciculi; on its surface and within it may be seen cutaneous nerves, arteries, and veins, with a few lymphatic glands; inferiorly it passes over Poupart's ligament, to which it is connected through the medium of Scarpa's fascia; at the pubis the laminar arrangement is well marked, where it passes on the penis to form the false suspensory liga- ment; m the female it is loaded with firm adeps, and forms the mons veneris; externally it passes downwards on the cord m the male to the scrotum, where it deo-e- nerates into areolar tissue; the superficial vessels and glands are placed between the lamina, but by minute and careful dissection so many as five layers may be formed of the superficial fascia; the greater the deposit ot iat, the less visible become the fibrous bands ap- pearing under such circumstances weak and indistinct Let the nerves and vessels be next examined. Two sets ol cutaneous nerves are seen, the lateral being branches trom the six inferior intercostal, which pierce the ex- ternal oblique or escape between its indigitations, then divide into a posterior and anterior branch, the for- mer _ being reflected backwards over the latissimus dorsi, the latter passing forwards as far as the middle line, and terminating in the skin. The anterior cuta neous pierce the anterior part of the sheath of the rec- tus, and form a plexiform interlacement on the linea alba; they are the terminating branches of the intercos tal trunks. The posterior cutaneous, derived from the iiio-scrotal and last dorsal, have been already noticed364 THE MUSCULAR SYSTEM. with the lumbar region; in addition to the cutaneous branches already described, the scrotal branch of the ilio-scrotal and hypogastric branch of ilio-hypogastric escape through the external ring, or through the tendon external to that point; the genital branch of the geni- to-cranial also passes through the ring, but is not dis- tributed to the integument of the abdomen as the two former always are. The cutaneous arteries are branches of the intercos- tals, with perforating twigs of the deep epigastric and mammary, and in addition to these, three branches are found on the surface more or less regular, namely, su- perficial epigastric, external circumflex ilii, and superior external pudic. Superficial Epigastric arises from the femoral, from three-quarters to an inch below Poupart's liga- ment; it first passes forwards piercing the sheath of the vessels and cribriform fascia, then turns upwards, for- wards and inwards, passing over Poupart's ligament, and can be traced to a point corresponding to the um- bilicus, sending branches through the tendon of the external oblique to communicate with the deep epigas- tric and also with the inferior intercostals; this vessel is accompanied by two veins which lie on either side ot it, and ultimately terminate in the curve of the internal saphena as it is about piercing the fascia. . . ^ External Circumflex Ilii—Smaller than the last, from which it sometimes arises, but is usually a branch of the femoral, springing from its outer side; it pierces the sheath of the vessels, courses for some distance be- neath the iliac portion of fascia lata, which it also per- forates, then runs parallel but below Poupart s_ liga- ment, gives off branches to the glands, and terminates at the crest of the ilium by anastomosing with super- ficial branches of the internal circumflex ilu; the accom- panvins veins have a similar termination to the last. Superficial PuDic.-The superior arises from the fe- moral, pierces the cribriform or pubic portion of fascia lata, and, having emerged from the sheath ol the vessels superficial to tlie femoral vein, it theii crosses the cord and runs upwards over the spine of the pubis, supplies the mons veneris in the female, and the tegumentaryMUSCLES OF THE ABDOMEN. 365 layer of this region in the male; it also gives off branches to the glands; the superficial pudic veins likewise ter- minate in the saphena. Lymphatic Glands—These are from four to seven in number, and lie parallel to Poupart's ligament, the superficial lymphatic vessels from the genitals passing through them, then coursing downwards to communicate with the deep absorbent before entering the abdomen. On raising the superficial fascia, a second layer be- comes visible, originally described by Scarpa; it is dense, semitransparent, and devoid of fat, and can be raised as a distinct layer about four inches above Pou- part's ligament. Following it downwards, in the middle line it passes over the pubis, investing the penis in a tubule; as it lies on the pubis it is beneath the false suspensory ligament, more externally it invests the cord, which conducts it into the scrotum, from which it is continued backwards to form the proper perineal fas- cia; still more externally it adheres to Poupart's liga- ment most intimately, and is finally attached in the groin to the cribriform fascia, which it separates from the sheath of the vessels ; vfhen this is removed the external oblique is visible in its entire extent. Obliquus Externus vel Descendens.—Flat and some- what quadrilateral, but broader before than behind, ten- dinous anteriorly and inferiorly, fleshy superiorly and posteriorly; it arises by triangular fleshy slips from the eight inferior ribs, external to their cartilages; the five superior indigitate with corresponding origins of the serratus magnus, and the three inferior have a similar connexion with the latissimus dorsi; sometimes they are concealed by the latter; the inferior fibres pass ver- tically downwards, and are inserted fleshy into the two anterior thirds of the crest of the ilium; the superior and middle pass obliquely downwards and inwards to be attached to the aponeurosis, by which the muscle is inserted into the ensiform cartilage, linea alba, its whole length, the anterior superior spine of the ilium, Pou- part's ligament, the crest, and symphisis pubis. The aponeurosis is somewhat triangular, the widest portion being stretched between the iliac spines; from that to the pubis it becomes gradually contracted, and above366 THE MUSCULAR SYSTEM. the spines it is first diminished in width, but again somewhat expands; a line drawn downwards from the cartilage of the eighth rib to the iliac spine would in- dicate the external edge. The fibres which form the tendon take an obliqiie course downwards, forwards, and inwards, arranged in fasciculated bands, but inferiorly as the pubis is approached these are more or less se- parated, leaving an important opening in this situation at the pubis, the fibres being inserted in three ways on the anterior surface of the symphisis; the decussating being continued down to the fascia, covering the adduc- tor longus tendon; a second flat band glides downwards over the symphisis and spine, does not decussate, but is attached to the pubic portion of fascia lata; the third are deep, decussate with each other, and are inserted into the crest and linea ileo-pectinea, forming the liga- ment of Mr. Colles. Relations. This muscle is subcutaneous, and lies on the internal oblique, rectus, pyramidalis, and intercos- tals, the posterior edge forms the anterior boundary of a triangular space, in which the internal oblique is seen, also the last dorsal nerve and internal circumflex ilii branches, but it frequently occurs that the latissi- mus dorsi wholly covers this space, and even in some cases overlaps the external oblique. Action. To compress the abdominal viscera, stimulat- ing the perisaltic action, and assisting in the expyilsion of urine and faaces; also to depress the ribs as in ex- piration ; to raise the pelvis in leaping, and likewise to rotate the body to the opposite side during the sittmg posture. On the dissected tendons of the last-described muscle there are many parts visible to which the student should next direct his attention; namely, linea alba and semilu- naris; also transversse, umbilicus, square openings for the passage of vessels, external abdominal ring, and Poupart's ligament. Linea Alba is formed by the union of the tendons ot opposite sides, and acts as a ligament connecting the ensi- form cartilage to the sternum; it is narrow below, wider above, but here weak and depressed, presenting several small apertures, through which portions ol fat may pro-367 MUSCLES OF THE ABDOMEN. trude, forming tumours resembling herniae; these are named adipoceles. It often occurs that these become inflamed, and may even be subjected to operation as strangulated hernife, but from the repeated observa- tions of those engaged in anatomical examinations, it would appear that their pathological characters are not always very remote, as by drawing forwards the fatty tumour a small portion of the parietal perito- neum is found engaged in the dilated aperture. We scarcely remember to have seen a single case of adipo- cele without a variable quantity of peritoneum forming part of the tumour, nor have we observed them except in the epigastric region. In consequence of the con- centric development of the abdominal parietes, a de- ficiency is sometimes present above the pubis, and in such cases the anterior wall of the bladder is also absent, the margins of that viscus adhering to the abnormal aperture, and the pressure of the contents protruding the posterior wall, forming a reddish spongy tumour, the ureter opening on its surface, and in such cases the penis is either absent or atrophied. The operations of tapping the bladder above the pubis, also a similar one for ascites, are performed In the course of the linea alba. The high operation for lithotomy had likewise a similar site, but this has now become obsolete. Linea Semilunaris.—This is a whitish faint line, extending from the cartilage of the ninth rib to the spme of the pubis; it corresponds to the point at which the tendon of the internal oblique splits, where it is about to form the sheath of the rectus. If a line be drawn from the umbilicus to the anterior superior spine of the ilium, and this be bisected, but a little nearer to the latter, is the point which has been selected for the evacuation of ovarian accumulations, but the pressure of the contained fluid exercises so much influence on the rectus that it may exceed three inches in width, pro- ducing a corresponding displacement of the epigastric artery, which may, therefore, be wounded. Surgeons are, therefore, slow to adopt the operation in this situation! LiNE^. TRANSVERSiE—These are three or four white Imes seen through the tendon of the external oblique;THE MUSCULAR STSTEM. 368 tliey are the tendinous intersections of the rectus abdo- minis ; one is situated on a line with the ensiform carti- lage; the second about one inch below it; the third opposite to the umbilicus; sometimes a fourth and fifth exist, but always below the latter point. Umbilicus.—This depression is situated in the linea alba, a little below its centre, but when the integument has been removed it becomes prominent as at birth. In foetal life it transmitted the umbilical vein from the mo- ther to the child, and the hypogastric arteries from the latter to the placenta, also the urachus, and the ompha- lo-meseraic artery and vein; the depression which ulti- mately remains aft^-r the sloughing or ulceration of the cord is attributed to the umbilical vein drawing the integument upwards and backwards, and the hypogas- tric arteries downwards and backwards. In conse- quence of a portion of the intestinal tube being deve- loped external to the abdomen, this opening is frequently the seat of congenital hernias. When it passes directly through the umbilicus, the tumour presents depressions on the surface corresponding to the vessels of the cord; but in the adult form of umbilical hernia, it protrudes on either side of the opening; sometimes on both, when the tumour is divided by a septum. The situation would naturally point to the colon as the probable con- tents, but it may, however, contain merely omentum. Openings of communication of a square shape are ob- ■ served in various parts of the tendon, for the passage of vessels; these may become the seat of ventral hernise, when subject to" continued distention and debilitating influences. Poupart's Ligament This fibrous cord is formed by the folded inferior edge o^ the external oblique, and has three attachments, the first being to the anterior superior spinous process of the ilium, which it appears to embrace; the second to the spine of the pubis, and the third, broad and expanded, into the linea ilio-pec- tinea. In the iliac half it is ciirved, the convexity look- ing downwards and outwards; this arch is preserved by the attachment of the iliac portion of fascia lata, and can be obliterated by flexing and rotating the thigh in- wards ; it is also concave forwards, the convexity pos-MUSCLES OF THE ABDOMEN. 369 R 3 teriorly being produced by the attachment of the iliac fascia to the posterior edge. The superior posterior edge is grooved, and gives attachment to the internal oblique, transversalis, and cremaster muscles; the posterior in- ferior surface is smooth, and forms the anterior boun- dary of the crural arch; the inner half is more horizon- tal, and about one inch from the pubis becomes twisted to form Gimbernaut's ligament. Taken with the tendon of the external oblique, which is attached to its upper edge, a sulcus is thus formed, on which the spermatic cord rests; at the pubis its fibres may be divided into decussating and direct; the former cross the anterior surface of the symphisis pubis beneath the insertion of the external oblique; the latter cross the crest of the pubis, forming a suprapubic ligament, with which the structure described by Mr. Colles is continuous. The attachment primarily is to the spine of the pubis, or more properly it rests on that salient point of bone, but is not inserted into it by any fibres. Gimbernaut's Ligament is triangular, with an ex- cavated base, looking outwards towards the crural ring, of which it forms the internal boundary; the anterior edge is continuous with Poupart's ligament; the pos- terior thin and sharp, attached to the linea ileo-pectinea, and a narrow slip may be traced outwards on that line, between the junction of the iliac and pubic portions of the fascia lata, as far as the ileo-pubal eminence. The anterior surface looks downwards, forwards, and out- wards, and corresponds to the attachment of Hey's liga- ment ; the posterior looks upwards and backwards, and is in contact with the conjoined tendons of the internal oblique and transversalis. It would appear that in the formation of Poupart's ligament the tendon of the ex- ternal oblique became inflected, and then, turning up- wards on the deep surface of the abdominal wall, it forms the fascia transversalis, so that the internal oblique and transversalis muscles are placed between two aponeuro- tic layers. From the anatomical arrangements of this, it will be seen, that position adopted so as to relax its attachments must tend to facilitate the return of hernial protrusions that escape at any point of the crural arch; also that pressure, in order to be elFectual on the arterial370 THE MUSCULAR SYSTEM. trunk of tlie lower extremity, must be applied either above or below the line of this ligament. External Abdominal Ring.—In the present stage of the dissection the ring is still obscured by Camper's fascia or bands. This structure differs in density in accordance with age, and also with the general struc- tural development of the fibrous tissues. If the tendon of the external oblique is examined on a level with the anterior superior spine of the ilium, white silvery fibres can be recognised, passing at first downwards and in- wards, then curving upwards, crossing in direction the fibres of the subjacent tendon; if an attempt is made to raise these bands as a distinct layer, it will fail, as they appear incorporated with the tendon; but as the ring is approached the distinct fibrous arrangement disap- pears, and at the margins of that opening it is suflfi- ciently loose in its attachment to admit of being raised by cautious dissection; it now passes downwards on the cord, or its analogue, the round ligament of the uterus 5 in the former, continued into the scrotum, and in the latter, to the labia, as the external spout-like fascia; in the male it forms the external investment for the tunica communis of the testicle, serving to retain the expanded cremasteric fibres in their natural connexion to each other. Raise this fascia and examine the ring. In the majority of subjects the first separation of the fibres of the tendon of the external oblique occurs above the centre of Poupart's ligament; from this it gradually in- creases until the pubis is reached; this space is covered by the intercolumnar bands, or Camper's fascia, which strengthens the wall of the abdomen in this situation; but where it leaves the tendon, a funnel-shaped space results, and on laying this open the ring is fully exposed. From this description it is evident that the extent of the opening is merely arbitrary in the vertical direc- tion. Although it is customary to consider the ring as triangular, with its base inferiorly and internally at the crest of the pubis, the apex above and without, if the proper attachments of its constituents ought to form the basis of its anatomical description, it will be necessary to examine its condition both on and above the pubis, when this opening will represent an ellipsoid or ovalMUSCLES OF THE ABDOMEN. 371 figure, placed obliquely, one cornu directed upwards and outwards, the second downwards and inwards; tlie formation of the superior cornu is sufficiently intelli- gible from the previous remarks on the separation of the fibres; the inferior cornu is formed by the non-de- cussating insertion of the pubic fibres of the tendon overlapping and crossing at an acute angle the decus- sating insertion of Poupart's ligament into the symphi- sis. This oval ring is divided into a pubic portion, on which the spermatic cord lies, and a suprapubic, through which it passes in its transit from the inguinal canal to the scrotum; it presents an internal and external pillar, but it is preferable to call them bands or segments; the internal is also superior and anterior; it consists of the flat, thin, non-decussating band of the tendon; the exter- nal is also posterior and inferior; but we cannot agree with Dr. Harrison in stating that this is thick and round (see " Dublin Dissector"), as it really consists of two very dissimilar parts, being, in the external two-thirds, thin and sharp, formed in this situation by the oblique apo- neurosis passing downwards beneath the cord, to be- come attached to the termination of the iliac portion of the fascia lata, where that is reflected downwards on the surface of the pubic portion, constituting Colles's fascia; the internal third is thick, round, and concave, and is formed by Poupart's ligament passing to its pu- bic attachment; the base is formed by the crest of the pubis, covered by the non-decussating fibres of Poupart's ligament, but it is on the angle of the external pillar that the cord lies, where the thick and thin divisions unite. The ring measures in the male, from base to apex, one inch, sometimes an inch and a quarter; in the female its dimensions are much less; in the former, the cord and cremasteric covering pass through it, and in the latter, the round ligament of the uterus; in both the branch of the spermaticus superficialis escapes through the superior angle, and the genital branch of the genito- crural through the lower, beneath the cord; the ileo-hy- pogastric branch pierces the tendon higher up, or, in some rare instances, also passes through the ring. Now let an incision be carried from the cartilage of the ninth rib to the spine of the pubis, and another beTHE MUSCULAR SYSTEM. 372 prolonged backwards through the muscle to its posterior edge; reflect the flaps from before in order to expose the internal oblique. OBLiQuuslNTERNUSvelAscENDENS.—Somewhat quad- rilateral; wider before than behind; tendinous ante- riorly and posteriorly; fleshy superiorly and inferiorly; it arises from the anterior edge of the lumbar fascia, from all the crest of the ileum, from the two iliac thirds of the inner surface of Poupart's ligament, which is grooved for the receptioxa of its fibres; the iliac and lumbar por- tions pass obliquely upwards, forwards, and inwards, and those from Poupart's ligament curve downwards and inwards to reach the conjoined tendons, arching over the spermatic cord; it is inserted into the points of the cartilages of the six inferior ribs, and at the linea semi- lunaris forms an aponeurosis, which is wider above and below than in the centre, and at the last-named line splits into two laminses to enclose the rectus; that layer which passes behind becoming continuous with the apo- neurosis of the transversalis muscle, and that in front Avith the tendon of the external oblique; in the mid- space, between the umbilicus and pubis, the four leaves of aponeurosis pass in front of the rectus, and become intimately incorporated inferiorly. This aponeurosis is attached superiorly to the cartilage of the last true and first false rib, to the ensiform cartilage, crest, and linea innominata of the pubis. Relations.—It is covered by the external oblique and latissimus dorsi, a small triangular portion being seen above the crest of the ileum, between the last-named muscles; on the surface the scrotal branch of the ileo- scrotal nerve, also the ilio-hypogastric, are observed; near to the spine of the ileum the inferior fibres of this muscle are arched over the cord, this margin in the male being closely incorporated with the cremaster, but in the female its limit is obscurely defined. The conjoined tendon consists of the aponeurosis of the internal oblique and transversalis; from this the external oblique can be separated with the handle of the scalpel, but they are themselves so closely incorporated that even by dis- section it is impossible to produce a separation; in exa- mining their pubic attachment, that into the symphisis373 MUSCLES OF THE ABDOMEN. lies in front of the pyramidalis and rectus; and at the linea innominata, Poupart's a!nd Gimbernaut's ligament are in front of them. It is usually considered that the tendon extends only so far out as the base of Gimber- naut's ligament, but such is not the case, the external margin being prolonged outwards over the deficient abdominal wall, strengthening the fascia transversalis in this situation. If the rectus muscle is raised, the point where the aponeurosis ceases to form a posterior sheath for it is marked by a semilunar tendinous edge, but this is not well defined, as Mr. Harrison remarks, as it invariably sends down a prolongation on the peritoneum and fascia transversalis, and occasionally a second lu- nated margin occurs two inches below the first, but more faintly marked, indicating that the aponeurosis merely becomes weaker on the posterior surface of the muscle, but is not absolutely deficient at any point. Now raise ^he muscle in a manner similar to the former, and the transversalis abdominis, rectus and pyramidalis, are seen, which, with the cord and tranversalis fascia, form the deep relations of this muscle; but if it is a male let the cremaster be first dissected, and in order to see this the integument must be removed from the scrotum, also the superficial coverings of the cord in that region. Cremaster—It arises from the lower margin of the mternal oblique muscle, also from the outer half and upper edge of Poupart's ligament; the fibres descend in loops, with the concavities directed upwards, on the anterior and external part of the cord; at the tunica vaginalis it expands between the internal and external spoutlike fascias to form the tunica communis; it then ascends on the posterior surface of the cord and epidi- dymis, adhering to the latter, and is ultimately inserted into Poupart's ligament where it covers the spine of the pubis. Relative Desceiption.—This muscle surrounds the testicle, but its anatomy is extremely variable. The looped arrangement, attributed by Cloquet to the im- pulsion of the fibres of the internal oblique into the scrotum by the descending testicle, is rarely visible • and even when such is the case it merely forms a por- tion of the cremasteric apparatus. More frequently itTHE MUSCULAR SYSTEM. 374 consists of fasciculated plates of muscular fibre, varying in number from one to five; these bands arise from the internal oblique and Poupart's ligament, and when nu- merous often unite at the inferior third of the cord, to form a perfect cylinder for its inclosure; but when a single band exists, it lies on the anterior part of the cord, beyond which the fibres cannot be traced. If, however, two bands occur, one is found anterior and external, the stronger; the other internal and posterior, weak and pale. The latter has been observed to termi- nate in the globus major of the epididymis; and another variety is where the loops of Cloquet are stretched be- tween these bands. We met with a case where this muscle was present in the canal, and terminated at the external ring, the testicle being normal in situation. The tendinous insertion is sometimes well marked, broad, and of a silvery lustre; the cord must be raised to see it perfectly; this may terminate on the pubic fascia, and never reach the bone. It is not always a constant structure, nor can a continuity of tissue be invariably traced between the fleshy fibres with which it is connected and those at the bottom of the scrotum. It may also exist without any muscular tissue on the back of the cord, and even be wholly independent of any that may be present. On this account, we con- ceive it to be a ligament to preserve the position of the cord on the pubis, admitting the views of Cloquet as being correct respecting the formation of the cremas- ter, which are supported by many facts that may be shortly stated as follows:—That the testicles extend the fibres of the internal oblique into the scrotum, to form the cremaster in their descent, is proved by the continuous attachment of the internal oblique to Pou- part's ligament in the foetus prior to the descent of the testicle; also, where the organ has never descended m the adult, the same attachments of the oblique are ob- served. In the female, likewise, the connexion to the ligament is almost complete, with the exception ot a small space for the round ligament, on which a Tudx- mentary cremaster is formed. There are, however ob- jections to these views equally forcible, namely, that the cremaster has been found in the scrotum, where theMUSCLES OF THE ABDOMEN. 375 testicle had not descended (Cooper). Curling has seen the cremaster ascending to be attached to the testicle in the abdomen; but this subject will be recurred to hereafter. Action.—The internal oblique compresses the abdo- minal viscera, assists in the expulsion of urine and fffices; also rotates the body to its own side and bends it forwards. The cremaster raises the testicle, and urges the semen in its course through the vas deferens; its action in producing the vermicular motions of the gland during the venereal orgasm is very doubtful. Transversalis Abdominis Similar in figure to the last-described muscle. It arises tendinous from the lumbar fascia, from all the crest of the ilium in front of the attachment of the ilio-lumbar ligament, by trian- gular aponeurotic slips from the inner surface of the cartilages of the last two ribs, and by fleshy bands from the five next in succession,—the latter indigita- ting with the origins of the diaphragm; the fibres pass forwards, the inferior curving downwards, and termi- nate in an aponeurosis sooner than the internal oblique. It is united at the linea semilunaris with the tendon of the oblique, and is inserted into the ensiform carti- lage, linea alba, pubis, and linea ileo-pectinea. Mr, Guthrie describes the cord as passing through a ring in this muscle, which may be thus expressed: That the fibres arising from Poupart's ligament take their origin beneath the cord, passing at first upwards and outwards, then curving downwards and inwards to reach the conjoined tendons; in fact, describing an ellip- tical aperture with an inferior concave pillar and a su- perior, straight: this arrangement, however, is not al- ways present; but certainly it does exist in the majo- rity of subjects, although not equally well marked in all _ EelaUve Anatomij—With respect to the lumbar fas- cia,—the three leaves of this structure have been fully described in the Anatomy of the Lumbar Eegion. The inferior margin is arched like the internal oblique, but lies somewhat higher up, being at first anterior to the cord, then arching over it, the conjoined tendons form- ing a posterior relation for it at their insertions; supe- riorly it is stretched between the cartilage of the sixth376 ■ THE MUSCULAR SYSTEM. and fifth ribs and the ensiform cartilage, and appears behind the outer edge of the rectus, which lies on it. At this point it is also covered by the internal oblique and intercostal nerves, which run forwards to reach the sheath of the rectus; the ileo-scrotal and ileo-hypogas- tric nerves pierce its iliac origin; also the internal cir- cumflex ilii artery, which courses along the crest of the ilium, between this muscle and the internal oblique. It lies on the fascia transversalis and peritoneum, also on the cord. Action.—Similar to the last muscle. Rectus Abdominis.—The fibrous layer should be dissected from its surface; but this is difficult to accom- plish at the tendinous intersections, but can be removed with facility below; long, flat, and wide above, thick and round below; it arises from the upper part of the crest of the pubis by an oval tendon, sometimes bifid, the fleshy fibres commencing on its posterior aspect: it soon becomes fleshy, passes upwards and slightly out- wards, and is inserted by three bands, the internal, short and wide, into the side of the ensiform cartilage, the middle into the cartilage of the sixth, and the external, longer and narrower, into the cartilage of the fifth rib; this last is occasionally continued upwards to the great pectoral, uniting with its external fibres, and even may pass upwards to the anterior lip of the bicipital groove of the humerus. Relations.—It is covered by the anterior layer of the sheath and pyramidalis; it lies on the posterior layer of the sheath, fascia transversalis, epigastric artery, and abdominal branch of the internal mammary; also on the sixth and seventh internal intercostals. Action.—In consequence of the tendinous intersec- tions which have been before alluded to, the several divisions of the muscle act in separate sections, from above downwards, so as to force the contents of in- testines towards the outlet of the body. These mter- sections sometimes are not complete, the fibres on the posterior surface of the muscle being continuous from the ensiform cartilage to the pubis. This is certainly the exception, although undoubtedly they are not as evident on the deep as the superficial surface ot theMUSCLES OF THE ABDOMEN. 377 muscle, and are probably the rudiment of the abdomino- costal bones of reptiles; these long fibres may also be analogous to the long intercostal muscles; it will also depress the ribs, and prevent the trunk bending back- wards on the pelvis, as well as assisting in leaping. Arteries in the Abdominal Wall—Internal mam- mary, deep epigastric, and circumflex ilii; also the trunks of the inferior intercostals. The abdominal branch of the internal mammary artery enters the abdominal wall through a triangiilar space between the costal and xi- phoid origins of the diaphragm, passes into the sheath of the rectus, and a little above the umbilicus anasto- moses with the deep epigastric. Internal Epigastric.—A branch of the external iliac, passes upwards in the sheath of the rectus, and anasto- moses with the abdominal branch of the mammary. Internal Circumflex Ilii.—Also a branch of the external iliac; passes between the internal oblique and the transversalis at their iliac attachments; anasto- mosing with the lumbar, ilio-lumbar, and ghiteal arteries. Intercostals.—The six inferior pass between the internal oblique and transversalis forwards, and termi- nate in the rectus; and such is also the termination of the corresponding nerves: but for a more detailed de- scription see Vascular System. Pyramidalis Abdominis.—A small triangular mus- cle, lying in front of the origin of the rectus; arises from the crest of the pubis: the fibres pass upwards and inwards, and are inserted into the linea alba, with which it is intimately connected about one inch and a half above the pubis; so that the absolute insertion is into the ensiform cartilage. In front of it are the ex- ternal oblique, Colles's ligament, and conjoined tendons, and behind it the rectus abdominis. It is very often wanting. Action.—To make tense the linea alba. Let the student now direct his attention to the ana- tomical region concerned in the production of hernia: this can be accomplished on the opposite side of the ab- domen, which should be left entire in the inferior third A hernia is defined to be a protrusion of a portion ofTHE MUSCULAR SYSTEM. 378 the contents from either of the three great cavities of the body, namely, the head, chest, or abdomen. In the latter instance, the escapement may occur of either in- testine (enterocele), or omentum (epiplocele), or it may consist of both (entero-epiplocele). In the normal con- dition of the parietes a reciprocal interchange of pres- sure subsists between the containing parts and those contained; but when the pressure from without, as in violent muscular efforts, or the pressure from within, depending on augmented volume of the viscera, becomes inordinate, the weakest portions of the walls yield to the impulse, either suddenly or gradually permitting portions of the contents to escape from within the na- tural limits of the cavity. These weaker points are usually found in the situation where openings occur for the transmission of parts either into or out of the ca- vity,—usually, we say, because wounds, congenital de- ficiencies, or relaxations, frequently render the waUs less capable of resisting protrusions than the sites of foetal openings. In the inguinal region a superficial and deep opening are present for the passage of the elements of the spermatic cord; but nature in the fashioning has exhibited an exquisite perfection, by placing an oblique canal between the two rings, so that the greater the amount of pressure, provided it does not exceed certain limits, the more security is afforded against pro- trusion by the approximation of the opposite walls of the intervening canal. If a line is drawn from a point three inches below the umbilicus to the anterior superior spinous process of the ilium, and Poupart's ligament be adopted as the inferior boundary, such will be the space or inguinal region connected with the surgical ana- tomy of this important accident. The integument of the inguinal region is fine and moveable on the subjacent fascia, but somewhat more ad- herent to the line of Poupart's ligament. On raising this structure the superficial fascia is seen, more or less apo- neurotic, and containing a variable quantity of adipose tissue, glands, and superficial vessels; beneath it Scarpa's fascia constitutes the third layer, subjacent to the last; the external oblique tendon, with Camper's fascia, re- presents the fourth, and the internal oblique, with theINGUINAL HERNIA. 379 cremaster, the fifth; the transversalis abdominis the sixth; and the fascia transversalis and subperitoneal tis- sue, with the peritoneum, the seventh stratum of tissues superimposed on this region. When the integument and fascise have been removed, the external ring becomes apparent; this is easily appreciable even in the living sub- ject, immediately above the crest of theptibis, and a little external to it. In consequence of the peculiar arrange- ment of the external spoutlike fascia, this affords a tem- porary obstacle to the escape of a hernial protrusion, but the continued pressure gradually expands its pillars, the thin portion of the external being forced outwards, and the internal gradually yielding in the upward di- rection, and becoming thin and expanded, the edges are prolonged on the tumour for some distance, the ring then representing a funnel, with the base towards the cavity of the abdomen. When the external oblique ten- don is thrown down cautiously, a space is observed in which the spermatic cord or round ligament is lodged, extending outwards to the point where these emerge from the cavity; this is the inguinal canal, of a prisma- tic form, the base corresponding to the abdominal edge of Poupart's ligament, its direction being obliquely downwards and inwards, extending between the rings. It is bounded anteriorly by the tendon of the external oblique in its whole length; in the outer half, the in- ternal oblique, and in the external third, the transversa- lis abdominis, so that in the internal third the tumour is most superficial, being covered only by the superficial layers and oblique aponeurosis; but in the direction of the internal ring, the inferior fleshy margins of the in- ternal oblique and transversalis, overlapping the canal, augment the coverings of a hernia in this division of It. It is bounded posteriorly by the conjoined tendons and Colles's ligament, fascia transversalis, and internal epigastric artery; below by Poupart's ligament; and above by the apposition of its opposite walls. This canal measures between the distal margins of the rings an ave- rage of three inches, and between the proximal two; these measurements having been deduced as the mean from seventy-two cases examined. In the foetus the rmgs are nearly antero-posterior, in consequence of the380 THE MUSCULAR SYSTEM. non-development of the horizontal rami of the pubis; but as life advances, the internal ring moves outwards, coincident with the development of that bone. In the female, the canal is proportionately increased, owing to the width of the pelvis, so remarkable a characteristic of that sex. Now turn to the opposite side, which has been dissected, and observe that on the removal of the mus- cles, the peritoneum is covered by a strong fibrous mem- brane, first described by Sir A. Cooper as the transversalis fascia; the latter is attached to the inner lip of the crest of the ilium, to Poupart's ligament for its whole length, and then, meeting with the outer edge of the rectus ab- dominis, it becomes ultimately adherent to it, and is further continued on its posterior surface to become con- tinuous with the similar sheet of the opposite side. At the crest of the ilium it is connected with the iliac fas- cia, and this junction continues as far inwards as the external iliac artery, a whitish line parallel to Poupart's licrament marking their union with the formation of a canal for the transmission of the internal circumflex ilii artery and two accompanying veins; inferiorly this fas- cia is strong, but as it ascends it becomes much weaker, and at the diaphragm is confounded with the subperi- toneal areolar tissue. At Poupart's ligament, a process is sent downwards into the femoral region to form the anterior half of the sheath for the femoral vessels; a point midway between the anterior superior spinous • process of the ilium and the symphisis pubis, and three- quarters of an inch above Poupart's ligament, will indi- cate the situation of the internal ring; not a defined aperture, even when examined on its deep or peritoneal surface. When the fascia transversahs is torn Irom the latter, the elements of the cord are seen diverging at an acute angle, the course of the vas deferens being in- wards and backwards, whilst the spermatic artery and vein ascend with a very slight degree of obliquity up- wards and inwards. At the site of the ring a mass of areolar tissue, occasionally fatty, and extending down- wards and backwards on the external ihac artery, indi- Tates the remains of that process of peritoneum which formed the tunica vaginalis, and when this is cautiously removed, the cord implies the situation of the internal381 INGUINAL HERNIA. ring. We cannot exactly agree with the anatomical de- scription given of this part in the usual works on that subject: any definite figure which it may present being purely artificial, unnatural, and delusive, fashioned with the scalpel, rather with a view to accommodate nature to descriptive prolixity, than with the intention of de- scribing structures as they really exist in their totality. This opening appears as a vertical slit on the abdominal surface of the fascia transversalis, the external margin being strong and lunated, the internal not so well de- fined, but appearing much thicker than the former. The deeper part of the internal ring is fully half-an-inch dis- tant from the internal epigastric artery, and should be styled its abdominal aspect; the vas deferens and sper- matic vessels passing for about a quarter of an inch be- tween the layers of the fascia transversalis before they pierce the external sheet, which is prolonged on the cord to the scrotum, constituting the internal spoutlike fascia of the spermatic vessels. The peritoneum should now be examined, and its peculiarities noticed in the ab- domino-inguinal region; in this situation the surface is irregularly concave, constituting the inguinal pouches; these consist of internal and external on each side, be- ing always perfectly symmetrical on the right and left sides. The external pouch, triangular in figure, occupies the space between the anterior superior spine of the ilium and the epigastric artery; and this, it is conceived, will predispose to the formation of the oblique form of inguinal hernia; the internal pouch, quadrilateral in its outline, is bounded internally by the urachus, and ex- ternally by the epigastric artery, but this is again sub- divided into an external smaller space, and an internal larger, by the obliterated hypogastric artery; the ex- ternal division is subject to extreme variety in size, and even as to existence, these alterations being dependent on the course of the hypogastric with relation to the epigastric artery; sometimes they are so close as to be m contact, and this is particularly the case in the fe- male, owing to the width of the bladder, which guides that vessel upwards, or again from a quarter to three- quarters of an inch may intervene between them; a pro- trusion through the external division constitutes theTHE MUSCULAR SYSTEM. 382 external direct inguinal hernia of Mr. Guthrie, whilst a similar escape through the internal division produces the ordinary form of direct inguinal hernia and the internal direct of Mr. Guthrie; these differential characters are of but very trivial importance, although it is true that the external direct possesses a cremasteric covering, which is absent in the ordinary form, but still the po- sition of both remains the same in relation to the epi- gastric artery, which seems to us the most useful point in a practical sense, which the student should seek to impress on his mind. We have now noticed somewhat in detail the anatomy of those parts concerned in the production of inguinal hernia; but as there occur two forms of this accident, each with different anatomical relations, we will now proceed with their individual peculiarities. An oblique inguinal hernia, in protruding at the internal ring, car- ries before it a portion of the peritoneum, which lines the abdominal walls; this constitutes the sac; then emerging from the ring, it receives an investment from the internal spoutlike fascia, which is a prolongation from the fascia transversalis, forming the tunica pro- pria of the hernia; it next lies beneath the fleshy mar- o-in of the transversalis, when that muscle arises as far fnwards as the centre of Poupart's ligament, or it sphts it, Avhen that arrangement of the lower fibres exists as described by Mr. Guthrie; it then lies beneath, or un- der cover of the fleshy margin of the internal oblique, and, further pursuing its course towards the external ring, it insinuates itself beneath the cremaster in the male subject; then lies covered only by the tendon of the external oblique, and, escaping through the exter- nal ring, it receives a tubular sheath from the mterco- lumnar bands, or external spoutlike fascia, then Scarpa's layer, superficial fascia, and the integument; thus pur- .viino- its course into the scrotum, with the spermatic cord°behind it, the testicle and tunica vaginalis at its inferior part, the tumour being closely related to the epididymis. It will be observed, that the direction of the hernia is downwards, forwards, and inwards, follow- ing the course of the inguinal canal and spermatic cord; but where the protrusion is large, and has existed for aINGUINAL HERNIA. 383 long period, the deep ring is carried inwards, and the external pillar of the sup'erficial ring, yielding in the out- ward direction, the two openings are approximated, the inguinal canal shortened, with a consequent diminution of that obliquity, characteristic of that form of hernia of which we speak, so that it becomes often impossible to determine the nature of the case from the mere fact of direction. Connecting this circumstance with the close relation of the internal epigastric artery, which in recent and small protrusions lies only a quarter of an inch internal to the neck of the sac, and in old forms being m much closer proximity, in many cases presentino- a concavity, mto the outer side of which the hernia is°re- ceived, we will appreciate the advice of Sir A. Cooper, who proposes that in all cases where it is dithcult to discnmmate whether the protrusion is by the oblique or direct descent, to cut upwards directly when divid- ing the structure. Now replace the coverings which have been raised and examine the parts which must be divided in an ope- ration lor the relief of a strangulated inguinal hernia by the oblique descent; these are,—integument, super- hcial, and Scarpa's fascia. Camper's bands or external spouthke fascia, cremaster, fascia propria, and peritoneal sac, with a small portion of the tendon of the external obhque above the external ring; the incision should commence a little above the external ring, and be carried downwards and inwards in the axis of the tumour for about two and a half inches; each covering must be divided cautiously, by raising a portion with the for- ceps and then making a small aperture, cutting with the kniie held horizontally, and subsequently introduc- ing the director, so as to divide each successive layer to an extent similar to the original incision. According to the number of layers divided, so should the caution of the surgeon increase, for although, as a general rule, the coverings are thickened, there are exceptions, one ot which we observed in a case operated on by Dr Jameson m Mercer's Plospital, where they were so at- tenuated that the sac was exposed by the removal of two layers only. Having arrived at the sac, which is recog- nised in the majority of cases by its smooth and free384 1 THE MUSCULAR SYSTEM. surface, the question of opening it or otherwise may now be determined-, if the former mode is adopted a small opening may be made in the manner before de- scribed at the lower part or fundus, the fluid that is within the sac gravitating to its most dependmg point, preventing the danger of wounding the intestine Hav- ino- now opened the sac, the finger should be introduced, or if that cannot be accomplished, a probe will generally enter the cavity of the abdomen, if the sac h^s been fairly opened, and having determined this point, the forefinger of the left hand, with Sir A.

Let it be remembered that the epigastric artery lies to the outer side of the neck of a direct in- guinal hernia, and that in some old cases the hernia enlarges its opening of escape upwards and outwards, so that this vessel may cross it superiorly in its course to the rectus sheath. We therefore doubt if it would be wise m such a case, or even safe, to cut the stricture directly upwards. Let the student now reflect as to where stricture is likely to ensue in those hernia we have described. In an oblique inguinal hernia it may be caused within the sac by the intestine passing through openings m the contained omentum, or by bands of lymph crossing the sac; next in order it may occur at the external abdominal ring,_this usually being the seat of strangulation in old and large hernia,-or it may occur at the fleshy margin of the internal oblique and trans- versahs muscles, or lastly, at the neck of the sac. In the direct form, the stricture is usually situated at the latter situation. Congenital Hernia is that form of protrusion which takes advantage of the patulous state of the inner rine requisite for the descent of the testicle to escape into the scrotum ; the usual period for its production beina between the sixth and ninth months, and most frequently at the latter period, owing to the pressure to which the abdomen is subjected during parturition. It descends directly into the cavity of the tunica vaginalis, lying when fully formed in front of the cord and testUe! having followed the exact course of an oblique inguina hernia, but being devoid of a peritoneal sac"excep^t that which It receives from the vaginal tunic.

The late Mr. Todd, of the Rich- mond Hospital, has offered a different explanation of this hernia, not indeed very easily understood, but perfectly consistent with anatomical considerations. He believed that the intestine inflects that portion of peritoneum that covers the anterior surface of the cord, projecting a sac between the spermatic vessels and that portion of peritoneum which is to form the tunica vaginalis testis. Thus when it has descended so far as to reach the tes- ticle, three layers of serous membrane would lie an- terior to the intestine, namely, tunica vaginalis scroti, testis, and the inflected layer; and'only one posteriorly, namely, the back part of the inflected sac. In this way it would possess a peritoneal sac, which Mr. Hey denies. This question is of some practical importance, as it in- volves the propriety of making the incision in the an- terior part of the scrotum. Mr. Todd recommends, when such a protrusion becomes strangulated, to cut down on the back part, as only one layer of serous mem- brane intervenes, while Mr. Hey advocates the anterior incision. We have not, however, seen this particular form of rupture dissected, and cannot, therefore, offer an opinion on the subject. ORGANS OF GENERATION IN THE MALE. Testicles, perineum, penis, bladder and its appendages; such is the order of dissection to be pursued in the ex- amination of the generative organs; but with the testi- cles should be grouped the vesiculje seminales and vasa deferentia, Cowper's glands, and probably the prostate; but as these appear in different stages, it will be pre- ferable to examine each as it is exposed, rather than connected as a system; and with the anatomy the m- dividual organs their functional relations to each other will be explained. . The Testicles are symmetrical organs, situated an a loose, pendulous bag of the integument, called scrotum. To within a short period prior to birth they occupied the abdominal cavity, where their development was com- pleted from the Wolffian bodies. At the fifth month each387 SCROTUM. s 2 testicular gland lies beneath the kidnej'on the quadratus lumborum muscle, above the gubernaculum testis, and behind the peritoneum. But.in order to understand the descent of those glands, the gubernaculum testis should be examined in the foetus. At present it will be suffi- cient to remark, that the gubernaculum is a triangular fibrous canal, containing in its centre a gelatinous fluid the base receiving the inferior extremity of the testicle like a cup, the apex inferiorly attached to the spine of the pubis, or more correctly to Poupart's ligament, trom thence sending a thin process downwards into the scrotum. Both the superior and inferior portion is in- closed by the cremaster, and to the gradual contraction of the latter, and the shortening of the gubernaculum, the slow descent of the gland is attributed. The fifth month they have reached the iliac fossa; the sixth they are at the internal ring; the seventh in the canal; the eighth at the external ring, or upper part of the scrotum; and the nmth m the position they are ultimately to occupv Sometimes one of these organs fails to attain its proper situation; it may be arrested in the abdomen, in the canal, in the external ring, or the superior part of the scrotum. In a case we recently examined, the organ was beneath the integument of the perineum; still the movement may be delayed even to the adult period See case of Undescended Testicle, by Mr. HamiUon, of May 1852°'' Quarterly Journal for _ In the examination of the scrotal region, the follow- 2^bZZT% T Integument or scrotum; 2.

This covering is loose, fine, and ru- gated, of a dark-brown colour, and studded with a few scattered hairs. The tenuity of the skin permits the sub- cutaneous veins to be seen, as well as the contents of the sebaceous glands, which are numerous in this situation- the mesial line is indicated by an elevation, with « depression on either side; this raphe corresponds to the junction of the two tumid folds of skin, that mark in the foetus the rudimental scrotum; occasionally the388 THE MUSCULAR SYSTEM. junction is not completed, a median fissure separating the bag permanently into two portions, simulating the labia of the female, each fold containing its respective testicle; such has been the condition of many reputed hermaphrodites. The general relations of the scrotum are,—on each side, the thighs; below and behind, the perineum; and above and before, the penis, from which it is suspended. Dartos,—A thin layer of a yellowish white colour, with numerous reddish fibres interlacing through its structure; its figure represents a trapezium or diamond, attached laterally to the fascia covering the rami of the ischium and pubis, anteriorly to the corpus spongiosum urethrse, and posteriorly to the central tendinous point of the perineum; posteriorly and laterally it sometimes extends backwards, covering the ischio-rectal space, and passing upwards in the middle line to assist in the formation of the septum scroti, where it is attached to the urethra, and then surrounds the penis; this tissue is lax, and in some cases strongly marked; the fibrous element most apparent in other instances presenting all the characters of ordinary areolar tissue with a la- minar arrangement. yS^rMCiMm—Non-striated muscular fibre (Sharpey), nucleated elastic tisse (Hassal) ; the older anatomists conceived it to be an expansion from the superficial sphincter ani; by its contraction, corrugation of the scro- tum and a rolling motion of the testicles are produced. The contraction of the dartos is seen when cold is ap- plied to the scrotum, and those circumstances which produce muscular asthenia have a similar influence on this tissue. As an instance, in advanced typhus the scrotum is lax and pendulous, but as the muscular tone returns it contracts to its ordinary shape and size. The areolar layer consists of the superficial abdominal fascia, carried down on the cord; in the scrotum it becomes lax and reticular, totally devoid of the fatty cha- racter so evident on the abdomen; beneath the raphe it is somewhat dense, and adherent to the dartos and skin. This tissue is exceedingly disposed to become infiltrated with serum, as evidenced in the cases of erysipelas and testitis. In general anasarca it is also enormously dis-389 SCROTUM. tended, but in consequence of the density of the areolar tissue beneath the raphe, the swelling may only affect one side, at least for some time; a similar condition is observed in diffused areolar emphysema. Scrotal FAsciA.—This is a prolongation of Scarpa's trom the abdomen; passing downwards on the cord, it covers the scrotum, adhering to the rami of the ischium and pubis on each side, ascending in the mesian line to lorm the septum, being attached to the urethra above; then, passing backwards, and increasing in strength, it forms the perineal fascia; thus it is that urine extravasated in the perineum reaches the scrotum and abdomen. On this fascia three superficial nerves are seen on each side — the external long pudendal, a branch of the inferior glu- teal which ascends from the perineum, and is continued as lar forwards as the penis; also the long perineal anterior and posterior branches of the pudic lie a little internal to the former, but have a similar destination. Many subcutaneous veins are likewise visible; these run to- wards the root of the scrotum, and pour their contents into the vens tegumentorum of the penis. The super- ficial arteries are the terminal branches of the long pe- rineal, and the inferior superficial pudic of the femoral ar- tery; but the principal branches of the latter are distri- buted to the integument of the penis. Tunica .Communis vel Erythroidea is formed of the expanded cremasteric fibres, placed between the in- ternal and external spoutlike fascise. In fcEtal life the cremaster consisted of two distinct portions, namely abdominal and scrotal; these, in accordance with the views of Mr. Curling, have special functions in relation to the descent of the testicle; each abdominal portion ?' Kr ' ^°"P^"'^ lig^^^^^t; fasci- culus ascends obliquely upwards and inwards; the second origin is from the spine of the pubis, and tendon of the rectus abdominis, and also ascends to the testicle, in- cluding between the internal and external portions the gubernaculum testis; the scrotal portion passes downward frona the spine of the pubis to be attached to the bottom of that cavity. By the gradual contraction of the ab- dominal portion the gland is carried to the pubis, and during its descent the cremaster is involuted, so thatTHE MUSCULAR SYSTEM. 390 the surface, which was internal in the abdomen, is ex- ternal in the scrotum; having arrived at the pubis, the scrotal portion now takes up the contraction, carrying the gland to its ultimate destination; this last subse- quently becomes atrophied almost to perfect oblitera- tion. The cremasteric fibres are pale and weak in the infant and advanced life, but in the young and robust a beautiful reticulated arrangement is visible. In a case of sarcocele which we lately examined, the fibres were collected into fasciculi, somewhat resembling vessels emptied of their contents ; the inclusion of the expanded muscle between the two spoutlike fasciae prevents the separation of the fibres when subject to distention. In addition to investing the cord, it also surrounds the tes- ticle, hence is derived the name tunica communis. The external spermatic branch of the ilio-scrotal nerve lies on its anterior and external side, and divides into fila- ments for the supply of the scrotum and cremaster; small branches of the epigastric artery (cremasteric) form the vascular supply. Tunica Vaginalis.—In the adult a distinct serous sac, but in infancy communicating with the general peritoneal cavity. As the testicle lay in the iliac fossa, the peritoneum formed the immediate investment for its anterior surface, but as the organ descends it glides on the surface of the iliac fascia, still carrying with it that portion of the serous layer, which adheres to the tunica albuginea. At Poupart's ligament it rest against the posterior surface of the fascia transversalis, m the site of the future internal abdominal ring; by this movement the arrangement of the peritoneum is much altered; the growth of the abdominal wall m an upward direction draws the peritoneum upwards, and that portion of the membrane carried downwards by the gland, in- stead of corresponding to the iliac fossa, is now the most inferior part of the peritoneal sac, so that it the com- munication be examined between the two serous mem- branes in an infant recently born, there exists a pertect continuity, through a funnel-shaped aperture, ihere is no folding or corrugation of the membrane to pro- duce this change, but simply the development of the abdominal wall, with a coincident growth of the serous391 SCROTUM. membrane, induces this alteration in the situation of its iliac division. Prior to the descent of the testicle, the internal ring is not formed, but is produced by the continued pressure of the testicle on the posterior aspect of the fascia transversalis, which ultimately car- ries a pl-olongation of that structure on its surface; thus the tunica vaginalis consists of two layers, tunica vaginalis scroti lining that bag, and tunica vaginalis testis covering the gland, a cavity intervening, smooth, polished, and glistening. The external layer adheres but slightly to the scrotum, and should now be laid open, and when slit anteriorly and reflected, the testicle, epididymis, and vas deferens are seen. The tunica va- ginalis adheres to the surface of the testicle most inti- mately, is thence reflected on the sides as far back as the epididymis; it then covers the outer side of the globus major and minor, sinking in between the body and the gland, forming a pouch in this situation in which the extremity of the handle of a scalpel can be buried. From the inside of the testicle it is reflected on the vas deferens, which here intervenes between it and the epididymis, the former being very loosely attached to the tube; tracing it upwards, it passes as'a distinct membrane about half-an-inch on the cord, somewhat higher internally than externally. This tunic is trans- parent, through its structure the subjacent tunica albu- gmea, with the vessels of the gland, are always visible; It is stronger on the epididymis in consequence of the deficiency of the tunicaal buginea, but even on this part we have always been able to detect a well-marked fibrous layer, that not only surrounds it, but also sends processes to invest the convolutions of which the epi- didymis IS composed; this is very remarkable on the globus major and body, and we have been accustomed to describe it as the " fibrous capsule of the epididymis " This capsule is rendered more distinct in the enlarge- ment of the epididymis remaining after specific testitis- also in cases of scrofulous disease, where it forms a cap- sule for tubercular deposits. The object of the serous tunic appears to be to facilitate the gliding motion of the testicle, assisting it to elude concussions. The Tunica Vaginalis is the seat of congenital her-392 THE MUSCULAR SYSTEM. nia when the canal connecting it with the abdomen is still pervious. A portion of intestine may then esca,pe and lie within its cavity, constituting congenital hernia; but if subsequent to birth, when the canal is being obliterated at the internal ring, by plastic lymph, a portion of intestine escapes, carrying the yielding exu- dation before it, as an expanded covering into the ca- vity of the tunic; this constitutes " infantile hernia" of Hey. Within the tunica vaginalis small cartilaginous bodies are frequently found, perfectly detached and free, but always in the vicinity of the epididymis, these being observed in cases without a trace of any struc- tural change. The Testicles are two in number, but as before mentioned, one may be retained in the abdomen, canal, or ring. Instances are mentioned where these organs exceeded the natural number, but any cases merely examined through the coverings of the scrotum are scarcely worthy of credit, as many circumstances con- duce to mistakes, as a portion of omentum in the vagi- nal tunic, or scrofulous and hydatid tumours m the gland. In a subject dissected last session, prior to opening the sac there was every reason to suspect a su- pernumerary organ, but it proved to be a very interest- ing anomaly,—the epididymis being placed on the ante- rior part of the testicle, the usual anterior edge being di- rected backwards. Each testicle is ovoid m figure, a little larger below, placed obliquely m the scrotum, diverging above, the posterior edge looking upwards and backwards, the anterior downwards and forwards; its vertical measurement from one and a half to two inches, from one inch to one and a half antero-poste- riorly, and from three-quarters to an inch transversely; these probably are a little in excess. The left testicle is always much inferior to the right, and Sir A. Cooper believes that this position facilitates their gliding move- ments in eluding pressure, and allowing the penis to proiect towards the left side, instead of directly ior- wards; it is also accounted for by the left spermatic vein opening into the renal, which again crosses the aorta, so that a resistance is afforded to the ascent of the venous blood from the left testicle, but the real cause393 TESTICLES. s 3 must be sought in the foetal position, for whilst in the abdomen the right testicle lies much lower than the left, as the liver depresses the right kidney, and thus the cremaster and gubernaculum testis are shorter on the right side, as also the vas deferens, which at that period runs to the base of the bladder directly; it follows, there- fore, as a result that might be anticipated, that when the testicles descend, the shorter cremaster and vas deferens prevent the organ on the right side extending so low as that on the left, which has a much longer cremaster and duct, as it previously lay higher in the abdomen. Tunica Albuginea vel Propria. —Individually a fibrous, but in connexion with the tunica vaginalis, a fibro-serous membrane; it covers and adheres to the surface of the testicle, and at the posterior edge dips into the gland between it and the epididymis, to form a triangular cavity,—the mediastinum testis, or cor- pus Highmorianum. To fully appreciate this arrange- ment, a transverse section should be made of the gland, and it will then be seen that the mediastinum is trian- gular, the apex directed towards the anterior edge, the sides formed by the inverted portion of the fibrous tunic. From the apex a number of sepimenta or tra- beculas radiate forwards to the internal surface of the tunic, thus separating the lobuli testis, and inclosincr each in its distinct compartment. The tunica albu- ginea is of a bluish white colour, resembling the dura mater, equally dense, but thinner and more transparent; the unyielding nature of this membrane explains the absence of any great amount of swelling of the gland Itself m testitis, but it does yield to long-continued distention as in sarcocele. The perfect sepimenta also account for the fact that the contents of one loculus only may escape in lipoma or scrofulous sarcocele, and that the disease may then terminate. Structure of the Testicle.—Raise off the tunica albu- ginea on one side of the gland, and to its deep surface will be seen adhering a vascular membrane, tunica vasculosa; it surrounds the glandular structure, and sends a process on each lobule, enclosing it like a sheath of pia mater, to which it is analogous in structure, bein^ areolo-vascular. Having cleaned the serous membrane394 THK MUSCULAR SYSTEM. from the epididymis, scrape off a few of the superficial lobules, and let the further examination be pursued under water. The testicle consists of a system of tubules commencing rarely by free extremities, but more frequently by loops, or anastomosing branches; they are from to -j-'^j- of an inch in diameter, and 840 in number, two or more being enclosed in each lobule; the tubes are two feet three inches in length, and the lobules from three to four hun- dred in number. The base of each lobule is directed towards the anterior edge of the testicle, the apex ending in the tubuli recti, about twenty in number, and ^'^ of an inch in diameter; these pierce the mediastinum tes- tis, and between the layers of that process they form the rete testis, a number of wavy tubes, from seven to thirteen, frequently dividing, and anastomosing in their course to the upper part of the mediastinum, where they terminate as the vasa efferentia, or coni vasculosi; these constitute the emissory tubes, are collected into a nar- row fasciculus, consisting of about thirteen canals, some- what smaller than the tubuli recti, and join the globus major of the epididymis. Epididymis.—Hourglass in shape, placed at the su- perior and posterior part of the gland; it consists of a head or globus major, body, and tail, or globus minor, and is formed of a single tube convoluted, about twenty- one feet in length (Lauth), with the greatest intricacy, arranged in spheroids or lobules, having a free commu- nication with each other, in this respect differing from the lobules of the testicle, which do not communicate; they are united by a fibrous layer or envelope, already described, which preserves their natural relation to each other, while from the globus minor the vas deferens arises. The attachment of the epididymis to the testicle is tubular, vascular, and membranous, the globus major being attached by the vasa efferentia, the globus minor by the branches of the spermatic artery and the body, the globus major and minor by the tunica vaginalis. Vas Defeuens.—This is a continuation of the epi- didymis, from which it arises at an acute angle, being at first a little contorted; it ascends on the internal side of the epididymis, to which it is closely connected; thenI VAS DEFERENS. 3(|5 enters the cord, lying behind the spermatic artery and vein; then passes through the external ring, courses outwards and upwards through the inguinal canal; en- ters the internal ring, crosses the external iliac artery, vein, and genito-crural nerve, iliac and psoas muscles,' winds round the outer side of the epigastric artery,' separated from it by one of the vena; comites, but as it crosses the descending portion of the epigastric, it is separated from it by the spermatic artery; the order of superposition in this situation would be,—vas deferens, spermatic artery, epigastric artery, and lastly, exter- nal iliac vein; it then passes downwards, backwards, and inwards, to reach the side of the bladder, involved in the lateral false ligament of that organ, and on the side of the bladder, it crosses external to the obliterated hypogastric artery; continuing backwards it passes next internal to the ureter, then alters its direction, turnino- downwards, forwards, and inwards, to reach the pros° tate; and just at the turn it lies in front of the ter- minal point of the internal iliac artery; arriving at the internal side of the vesiculs seminales, its figure^under- goes a change; in the cord it was round,°but at the base of the bladder it becomes flattened and involved in the same fibrous capsule with the seminal vesicle; reach- ing the base of the prostate it receives the duct of the seminal reservoir, and then assumes the name of ductus communis ejaculatorius, which, losing its proper tunic pierces the base of the prostate gland, where there ap- pears a notch for its reception, being here smaller than the combined diameters of the ducts that formed if and passing obliquely upwards and forwards, below the'mid- dle or Home's lobe, it pierces the mucous membrane of the floor of the prostatic portion of the urethra, openino- at one side of the verumontanum in the prostatic sinus" Structure of the Seminiferous Tubules.—Each tubule of the gland is highly elastic, and consists of a cylin- der of nucleated elastic tissue (Hassal), these nuclei being most visible in the immature testis; the secretin? surface, which is general throughout the entire length of the tubes, being lined by a layer of cells, constitutin-r the epithelium. Some contain but a single nucleus'' others three or four, but all have this common characterTHE MUSCULAR SYSTEM. 396 that they possess a remarkable tendency to be thrown off from the surface on which they are developed. It is in these cells that the formation of the spermatozoa occurs. The anatomy of the epididymis is similar, but that the tunics are thicker. The vas deferens consists of a dense external fibrous coat, which Lewenhoeck be- lieved was muscular, which it certainly is in the horse; the canal is exceedingly small, not more than capable of admitting a bristle, but this cavity is somewhat larger at the base of the bladder. When laid open, the surface is seen covered by a fine mucous membrane, but still irre- gular, in consequence of a layer of whitish fibres that lie external to the mucous membrane, crossing each other at acute angles. The spermatic cord consists of the sper- matic vessels, lymphatics, spermatic plexus of nerves, genito-crural nerve, and deferential artery, a branch of the superior vesical, surrounded by the degenerated tubule of serous membranes, internal spoutlike fascia, cremaster, and external spoutlike fascia. These vessels, &c., will be found described in their proper place or system. Development of the Testicle These organs make their appearance in the lower and inner part of the Wolf- fian bodies at the close of the seventh week; they at first consist of a granular albuminous fluid, which serves as the nidus in which the tubuli seminiferi become de- veloped ; the epididymis appears about the tenth week, and the gubernaculum at the thirteenth. The organ commences its descent about the fifth month of intra- uterine life. The function of the testicle is to secrete the semi- nal fluid; this is compound, consisting of a fluid por- tion, or liquor seminis, and certain solid constituents, namely, essential, the spermatozoa,—and non-essential, the mucous corpuscles, seminal granules, and epithe- lium. A spermatozoon consists of a disc or head, and tail, and possesses automatic movements for some time after the ejaculation of the fluid; these are developed within cells from nuclei, and are then set free, like the young of the volvox, but they do not appear until pu- berty, and are present until an advanced period of life.397 PERINEUM. PERINEUM. The Student should now prepare the subject for the purpose of examining the perineal region. Let the nates rest on the edge of the table, or be supported on a block m that position if the table is low; flex the thighs on the pelvis, and the legs on the thighs; place the wrists in opposition with the external malleoli, and secure the body m this position; introduce hair or tow into the rectum, and pass a staff into the bladder, which may now be secured by a ligature placed round the corona glandis. The Ano-perineal Eegion is oval or diamond-shaped, bounded anteriorly by the pubis and subpubic liga- ment; laterally by descending ramus of the pubis, and ascendmg ramus and tuberosity of the ischium, and great sacro-sciatic ligament; and posteriorly by the coccyx; it therefore corresponds to the outlet of the pelvis. The skin is fine anteriorly, but posteriorly where It merges with the integument of the buttocks and thighs, It becomes much stronger; at the ver^e of the anus it is thin and rugated; the folds converging towards the orifice ; in these intervals excoriations fre- quently occur, attended with most distressing symptoms consequent on the action of the sphincter; the surface markings in this region are few, but important,_in the centre extending from the anus to the scrotum; a conical elevation corresponds to the subjacent urethra, the base being at the anus, the truncated apex disappearing in the root of the scrotum, a raphe runs on its centre, and on either side of the latter a concavity occurs, deeper in fat subjects corresponding to the rami of the ischium and pubis. If a line be drawn between the prominent points of the tuberosities of the ischia, it will divide this space into an anterior true, or urethral perineum and a posterior or false, these representing two trian<^les united at their bases; the anterior containing the ure- thra and the crura penis, with their subsidiary muscles — the posterior, the anus, and sphincters. The anterior region measures from base to apex in the raphe three inches; at the sides three and a half; and across the base three. Now make a cautious incision from the scrotum'398 THE MUSCULAR SYSTEM. to the anus, and a second backwards to the coccyx; also a transverse one from that orifice to the tubera ischii, and unite them by a circular cut around the anal orifice. Now let the four flaps be reflected outwards, and exa- mine the subcutaneous layer, superficial sphincters, and subcutaneous nerves and vessels. The subcutaneous layer is continuous above with the superficial fascia of the scrotum; laterally with that of the thighs, and pos- teriorly it merges in the fatty areolar tissue of the ischio-rectal fossa; it is extremely fatty in the child, and also at the middle periods of life, but in the adult it is dense, and frequently exhibits aponeurotic fasciculi; but as the fat predominates the aponeurotic structure disappears. When this is cautiously raised, a second fascia is seen; this should be named projjer perineal fas- cia; it is dense, of a bluish white colour, stronger than the superficial, but yet semitransparent, attached late- rally to the rami of the ischium and pubis, continuous above and before with Scarpa's fascia on the scrotum, and posteriorly it bends upwards behind the transverse perinei muscles, and is united with the anterior edge of the base of the triangular ligament; from its deep surface two septa pass upwards to be attached to the perineal face of the triangular ligament, thus dividing the anterior pe- rineum into three compartments, the central, contaming the urethra and acceleratores urinse, the lateral inclosing the crura and erectores penis. In consequence of these relations, urine extravasated in the perineum cannot be- come difi'used either laterally or posteriorly, but follows the course of Scarpa's fascia upwards on the scrotum, and so by the cord is conducted to the abdomen,—the vertical septa preventing its contact with the crura, and producing the central funnel-shaped tumour so indica- tive of this accident. On raising the fascia the superfi- cial vessels and nerves are exposed : the former con- sist of the transverse perineal artery, a branch of the internal pudic, sometimes it comes ofi" from the long perineal artery; it winds round the transversus pen- nei muscle to its cutaneous surface, runs inwards, and divides into anterior, posterior, and communicatmg branches: the former pass forwards to the accelerator uringe and bulb; the latter backwards to the verge ot399 PERINEUM. the anus, communicating with the anterior external hemorrhoidal, while the communicating anastomoses with the opposite artery. The long perineal is also a branch of the internal pudic; it pierces the base of the triangular ligament, winds round the transversus pe- nnei, external to the former artery, runs upwards, for- wards, and inwards on the outer side of the accelerator urinaj, and arriving at the scrotum it divides into an external and internal branch; the former ramifies on the inferior and external surface of the scrotum com- municating with the inferior external pudic; the latter runs in the septum, and is called the arteria septi scroti, which should be avoided in castration. The superficial nerves consist of the long perineal in- ternal and external, which pursue a course similar to the artery of that name, arising from the pudic, some- times separately, and occasionally together; also, the long pudendal, a branch of the lesser sciatic, which winds round the ascending ramus of the ischium, about half- an-inch above the tuber, runs upwards, forwards, and inwards, on the fascia of the perineum and scrotum and terminating on the penis. ' Muscles of the True PERiNEUM—These are three pair,_namely, transversus perinei, erector penis, and accelerator urina. Transversus PERiNEi.—TrianguIar and fleshy lies at the posterior edge of the space; it arises by a flat tendon from the internal side of the tuber ischii above the erector penis; it soon becomes fleshy, and passes obliquely forwards and inwards, and is inserted into the central tendinous point of the perineum, in front of the verge of the anus, and behind the urethra i?eta..-This muscle receives frequently a slip from the superficial sphincter, and not uncommonly it passes over the central point to meet its fellow, forming a distinct muscu ar plam, arching in front of the anus^ From the point oi insertion, a fleshy slip passes forwards and upwards on the side of the accelerator urin^, and 18 so often present that it would almost seem the normal arrangement; this latter may have a distinct origin irom the ascending ramus of the ischium, when it is named transversalis alter, the long perineal artery sepa-THE MUSCULAR SYSTEM. 400 rating the two portions; if is covered superficially by the transversalis artery, integuments, and fascia; it lies on the base of the triangular ligament, which separates it from the levator ani; posteriorly it corresponds to the dipping in of the fascia, the long and transverse perineal arteries, and superficial sphincter; anteriorly to the accelerator urinee and a triangular space which contains the long perineal artery and nerve. Action.—To fix the central point, and draw down- wards and backwards the bulb. Erector Penis, or Ischio-cavernosus.—An elon- gated muscular and aponeurotic fasciculus, lying on the crus penis; it arises by short aponeurotic fibres, that immediately become fleshy from the inner edge of the tuber ischii. It passes upwards, forwards, and inwards, and is inserted by an aponeurotic band, that commences on the surface of the muscle, into the corpus caverno- sum penis. This band is placed between a separation of the muscular fasciculi, the external portion of which is often prolonged for some distance on the crus; the direction of the aponeurosis is obliquely outwards and forwards. Relations Below with the fascia, skin, and dartos; above, the crus penis and transversus perinei; inter- nally with the ischio-urethral space, which, with the long perineal artery, separates it from the accelerator urin£E muscle. Action. To draw downwards and back wards the penis during erection; the action is apparently rhythmical, and dilates the crus rather than compresses it. It is a fallacy to suppose that these muscles produce distention of the penis by compressing the veins of the crura, there being several objections to such a view,—namely, that the mechanical arrangement is the opposite to that which would cause compression; that the contractions are not permanent during erection, but rhythmical; and lastly, that the venous blood has many subsidiary modes of escape from the crura, which will be described with the anatomy of the Penis. Accelerator Urin;e, or Bulbo-cavernosus.—Bi- penniform; lying on the spongy portion and bulb ot the urethra; it arises from the central tendinous pomt401 PERINEUM. of the perineum and tlie median tendinous raphe which separates the two muscles; the fibres pass upwards, for- wards, and outwards; the most posterior, short, are inserted into the perineal face of the triangular ligament, often extending to the bone; the middle bend upwards above the urethra and below the crura, to be attached to a shining aponeurotic band in that situation ; while the anterior and internal fibres are the longest, and are directed upwards, forwards, and outwards, and are in- serted into the surface of the fibrous tube of the corpus cavernosum penis. Relations.—It lies on the corpus spongiosum and bulb of the urethra, from which it is separated by a tubule of the triangular ligament; also on the triangular ligament and crus penis, and it is covered posteriorly by a slip of the transversus perinei, and more externally by the erector penis; externally it corresponds to the erector, long perineal artery and nerve, and the entire of the cutaneous surface is invested by a strong funnel of the perineal fascia. Where this muscle is attached to the crus it bends over its surface to the dorsum of the penis, which is considered by many anatomists to represent the muscles of Houston, described in the Dublin Hospital Reports: these will be referred to in the anatomy of the Penis. Action.—To compress the urethra, and sustain a gra- dual pressure on that canal during its distention by the column of urine; also to expel the last drops of urine that remain in the bulb, together with the seminal fluid, which IS accomplished by momentary, but energetic contractions, producing their expulsion by jerks rather than by sustained efforts. This muscle, from the pecu- liar manner in which it is inserted above the urethra, may be engaged in spasmodic stricture; and perhaps is more frequently the seat of this disease than Wilson's muscles. They can often be felt like a cylinder of wood beneath the skin when an instrument is being in- troduced into an irritable urethra. Between the muscles just described a triangular space exists, with its base behind, at the transversalis perinei • the apex in front, bounded externally by the erector and crus penis, and internally by the accelerator urinsTHE MUSCULAR SYSTEM. 402 If an effort be now made to press the fingers upwards through this space into the pelvis, it will be seen that the triangular ligament forms the roof or superior boun- dary ; through this triangle the knife must pass in the lateral operation of lithotomy, in order to reach the mem- branous portion of the urethra. We have observed con- siderable variations in its form: the accelerator and erector penis may be united on its surface; the bulb may be of such a size, particularly in the old, as to overlap the space, concealing it altogether, or the trans- versalis perinei may be so oblique, or continued so far upwards in connexion with the accelerator, that the space is absent. The long perineal artery and nerve run through it in their course to the scrotum. Now exa- mine the posterior region, which presents for dissec- tion in the present stage two muscles,—namely, super- ficial and deep sphincters, and the ischio-rectal fossae, with their contents. Sphincter Ani Externus.—A flat, oval plane of muscular fibre, interrupted in the centre by an ellip- tical aperture; it is subcutaneous, one surface directed upwards, the other downwards, and arises by a thick, strong tendon (ano-coccygeal ligament) from the last bone of the coccyx; the fibres separate into two fasci- culi at the posterior edge of the anus, surround it, and again unite anteriorly, becoming tendinous; and it is inserted into the raphe, superficial fascia, and central tendinous point of the perineum. Relations.—Superiorly with the levator ani; exter- nally, the fat of the ischio-rectal fossse; internally, the annular fibres of the rectum, which are easily recognised by their paleness. The inferior hemorrhoidal arteries and veins terminate in the outer border. Action.—The external fibres can contract the rectum, while the internal act only on the anus. This muscle is peculiar in being contracted in its quiescent state, the stimulus to that condition being the pressure from above. Internal Sphincter consists of a pale fasciculus of muscular fibres, surrounding the extremity of the rec- tum, about an inch in depth; anteriorly it is attached to the central tendinous point of the perineum, lyingPERINEUM. 403 internal and above the superficial sphincter. It appears to be merely a thickened portion of the annular fibres of the rectum, and its use is similar to the last; both, however, appertain to the mixed class of muscles. Let the fat and areolar tissue be carefully removed on each side of the rectum, and a deep cavity,—the ischio- rectal fossa, -vvill be exposed; triangular in shape, the apex above, the base inferiorly; bounded externally by the obturator fascia, obturator internus muscle, and tuber ischii; internally by the rectum and levator ani; anteriorly by the transversus perinei and posterior layer of the triangular ligament; and posteriorly by the great sacro-sciatic ligament, overlapped by the gluteus maximus; the base is formed by the integument and fascia, and the apex at the origin of the levator ani; from side to side it measures one inch in the antero- posterior direction, and in depth about two inches; it contains a quantity of fat, the external hemorrhoidal vessels and nerves, and in the oviter wall lies the pudic artery, only separated from the space by the obturator fascia. The object of the space is to allow of distention of the rectum, and also permit of facility in its several movements. The large quantity of fat, together with its low organization, predisposes to the extensive diflfu- sion of matter, and the mobility of one wall of the ab- scess, together with the unyielding nature of the opposite, favours the formation of fistula. External Hemorrhoidal Arteries are two in num- ber on each side, arising from the internal pudic, as it lies in the triangular space internal to the tuber ischii; they pierce the obturator fascia, the anterior sending branches forwards to the transversus perinei, and then reaching the rectum, they form a circle of anastomosing branches on its surface; the veins which accompany those arteries terminate in the pudic, and the nerves are also branches of the pudic trunk. Now remove the erector penis, accelerator urinse, and the transversus perinei; also the long perineal artery, with the crus penis of one side, and the triangular liga- ment will be exposed. Triangular Ligament, shaped as its name implies, occupies the space between the diverging rami of the404 THE MUSCULAR SYSTEM. ischium and pubis, about one inch and three-quarters in length; it presents for examination two surfaces, apex and base, with two margins; the latter are attached to the rami of the ischium and pubis, where they are continuous with the obturator fascia, and as- cending or falciform process of the great sciatic ligament; the apex superiorly divides into two layers: one passes upwards on the posterior surface of the subpubic liga- ment and symphisis to become continuous with the lower edge of the anterior true ligaments of the blad- der; the other is prolonged on the dorsal veins of the penis; the base is badly defined, but when dissected, exhibits a double arch on each side of the mesian line, the central slip being attached to the middle tendinous point of the perineum; to the anterior margin of the base the proper perineal fascia is united; the posterior margin passes backwards on the perineal aspect of the levator ani, and is there continuous with a thin expan- sion from the obturator fascia; some bands are also prolonged into the ischio-rectal fossge, to separate the fatty tissue in that region. One inch below the symphi- sis pubis the triangular ligament is pierced for the exit of the membranous portion of the urethra, and as it passes through it, a process from the posterior sur- face is prolonged backwards on the intrapelvic portion of the membranous division, continuing backwards on the under surface of the prostate gland to form a part of its capsule, and at its posterior edge becoming incor- porated with the recto-vesical fascia of Tyrrell; from the anterior surface a process passes forwards on the spongy portion and bulb of the urethra, which gives the canal a smooth and glistening aspect, when the ac- celerator urinas is removed. In addition to the urethral opening there are three arterial perforations on each side, one neural, and a single tubular opening at the apex for the dorsal vein of the penis. The arterial perfo- rations are from without inwards,—for the internal pudic, long perineal, and transverse perineal arteries,—while the pudic nerve divides into an inferior or bulbar, and a superior or dorsal nerve of the penis; the latter ascending between the levator ani and pelvic surface of the trian- gular ligament, and, about half-an-inch below the apex,405 PERINEUM. piercing that structure to reach the dorsum of the penis. The anterior surface of the triangular ligament is covered by crura penis, erector, transversalis perinei, accelerator urinee muscles, and the long perineal artery and nerve; the bulb and spongy structure of the ure- thra also lies on it for about an inch and a quarter; the posterior surface corresponds to the anterior face of the bladder, prostate gland, membranous portion of the urethra, levatores ani, and the curve of the rectum, but the latter is at some distance posteriorly; also the dorsal nerve of the penis. This ligament consists of two layers, superficial and deep; the former should now be removed, and the following parts will be observed between its layers:—!. Cowper's anti-prostatic glands; 2. Wilson's and Guthrie's muscles; 3. Pudic artery; 4. Artery of the bulb; 5. Membranous portion of the urethra. Cowper's Glands—Two small ovoid tubular bodies, lymg on each side and below the membranous portion of the urethra; they are surrounded by a dense re- flected saccule from the triangular ligament, and their size varies, sometimes not exceeding a small pea, or agam, as large as a kidney-bean. From the superior part a duct emerges, that passes upwards and forwards, grooving the bulb, and then opens obliquely into the spongy portion of the urethra, in front of the bulb or dilatation, after a course of three-quarters of an inch. These glands consist of a single duct, to which the secondary tubes are attached, and these latter are of the same diameter throughout, being long, slender, looped, or convoluted, but never arborescent or mi- nutely divided. Relations.—AnterioTly a,nd posteriorly, the triangular ligament; below, transverse perineal muscle; and above the artery of the bulb, from which the vascular supply IS derived; they secrete a fluid which is probably mixed with the seminal secretion during its discharge, but the variation in their magnitude would seem to imply that their function is unimportant. Wilson's Muscles—These are two bands that arise from the lower edge of the symphisis pubis, and, ter- minating in tendons which surround the urethra, areTHE MUSCULAR SYSTEM. inserted into the central tendinous point of the peri- neum. Mr. Guthrie believes that the existence of such muscular bands is unusual, and considers the arrange- ment as different; he describes a half-circle of tendon above, and a similar one below the membranous portion of that canal, and from the circle arises a muscular band on each side, sometimes bifid, which passes out- wards, and is inserted into the ramus of the ischium where it joins the pubis. We have seen Wilson's muscles in all cases that we have examined, but vary- ing considerably in size, but we have not been equally fortunate at all times in detecting the arrangement described by Guthrie; but in some instances these transverse muscles appeared well marked, and in such the internal pudic artery split the band into two fasci- culi. Mr. Harrison looks upon these structures as being a part of the anterior fibres of the levator ani, but they are separated from that muscle by the posterior layer of the triangular ligament, and in all the cases that we have examined, the separation between them was suffi- ciently obvious for demonstration. That it is possible by special intention to produce appearances similar to those figured in recent works, as being the natural arrangement of the urethral compressors is evident, but if merely the anterior layer of the ligament and no more is removed, and all derangement by the use of hooks dispensed with, it will be seen that the anatomy of Mr. Wilson is correct in almost every particular as to those structures, first described by Santorini. Use. To compress the urethra; they may also by tonic contraction induce spasmodic stricture, and con- sequent retention of urine. Internal Pudic Artery.—This vessel is seen pierc- ing the posterior layer of the ligament, a quarter of an inch above the base, then ascending between the two layers, and one inch above the base, it perforates the an- terior layer, passing then between the crus penis and the bone, where it terminates. In this course it gives off the artery of the bulb; this runs upwards and in- wards, from half-an-inch to three-quarters above the base of the ligament, and divides into two branches,— a posterior, smaller, to the glands of Cowper; thePERINEUM. 407 anterior, larger, supplies the bulb, which it pierces ob- liquely. Long and Transverse Perineal Arteries pierce . the ligament on the same line, but internal to the pudic; they pass through both layers directly. Dorsal Nerve of the Penis perforates the ligament half-an-inchbelow its apex, alsopassing directly through its layers. Dorsal Vein—This large trunk passes through a tubular aperture at the apex, immediately beneath the subpubic ligament; in addition, there are many smaller venous branches that, emerging from the crura of the penis, pass through well-marked openings in the ligament, and communicate with the prostato-vesical plexus. The uses of the triangular ligament are suiBciently obvious, bemg, to support the urethra in its passage, to alFord a plane on which the muscles acting on the urethra may be attached and fixed; it also sustains the prostate gland and anterior surface of the bladder, and consti- tutes a diaphragm between the perineum and pelvis anteriorly. Now remove the posterior layer of the triangular ligament, draw the rectum downwards and backwards, remove the thin layer of fascia which covers and adheres to the perineal surface of the levator ani, and when a lateral section of the pelvis is made hereafter, the pelvic surface can be more fully examined. Levatores Ani form a fleshy layer, which occupies the outlet of the pelvic cavity; each muscle is flat and thm, deeper behmd than before, and arises from the posterior surface of the symphisis pubis, inferior and external to the anterior true ligaments of the bladder ■■ It next arises from an arched tendinous band that lies between the splitting of the pelvic fascia, passing from the pubis to the spine of the ischium, and also from that bony point; the fibres are divided into four portions — namely, prostatic, anal, prfecoccygeal, and coccyaeal • the first form a flat band, the anterior fibres of which are inserted into the dorsum of the prostatic capsule, while the posterior, longer, pass round the gland, and arc at- tached into the central tendinous point of the perineum- the anal fibres are divisible into an anterior and poste- nor set; the former pass downwards and inwards, sepa-408 THE MUSCULAK SYSTEM. rated from the side and inferior fundus of the bladder by the recto-vesical fascia; the posterior run downwards and backwards, inferior and posterior to the rectum; both sets then encircle the intestine, becoming united with the internal sphincter, from which the fibres can- not be distinguished; the prajcoccygeal portion passes downwards and inwards, and is inserted into the ano- coccygeal ligament; and, finally, the coccygeal fibres run backwards and inwards to be attached to the side and forepart of the coccyx. Relations and Structural Anatomy.— There is ex- treme variability in the thickness and density of this muscle in difi'erent subjects,—in some being weak and thin, with wide intervals separating its fasciculi; in other instances strong and red; but the division into bands of unequal widths is a character always present^ which renders its structure not unlike that of the diaphragm; the prostatic fibres are weak, as also the coccygeal, but the anal and prsecoccygeal are much stronger; it is not unfrequent to find the prostatic exhibiting a number of separate bands, wholly unconnected with the anal fibres. In the male there are two openings m this muscular plane, but in all other situations they are united. One opening permits the passage of the apex of the prostate, and is somewhat elliptical, wider below than above, the edges well defined, and abrupt; the second, posteriorly, is on a plane inferior to the last, and is funnel-shaped, prolonged on the rectum, and impossible to define; its circular orifice allows the rectum to pass to the anus; the superior edge is lunated, the concavity looking up- wards and backwards; in this situation the pelvic tascia splits into an internal vesical and external obturator layer, and through this medium the levator am maybe attached to the brim of the pelvis, but it is quite incor- rect to say that the muscle itself has such an_ origin. By its pelvic surface it corresponds to the anterior true ligaments of the bladder and prostate gland, to the vesical fascia and recto-vesical layer, which separates it Lm the inferior fundus of the bladder, vesicul^ semi- nales, and vasa deferentia, also to the rectum and a quantity of lax areolar tissue. The perineal surface cor- respond^ to the triangular ligament superficial sphinc- ter the reflected base of the triangular ligament, to thePENIS. 409 fat wliich occupies the ischio-rectal fossa, and the ex- ternal hemorrhoidal arteries and veins; the coccyo-eal fibres have, to their posterior and external surface, 'the coccygeus muscle, and a special branch of the sacral plexus supplies each muscle, the arteries being derived from the hemorrhoidal and sacral. Action—To close the outlet of the pelvis, to support Its contents, to assist in closing the rectum, and eleva- ting it_ after it has been depressed by the action of the abdominal muscles in defecation; also to constrict and raise the vaginal orifice, which it surrounds in the female, to raise the prostate, and compress it during micturi- tion, and to force the seminal secretion into the bulb of the urethra. Coccygeus, or Ischio-coccygeus, lies external and posterior to the last muscle; arises tendinous from the internal surface of the spine of the ischium ; passes backwards and inwards, and is inserted broad and ten- dinous into the side of the coccyx and extremity of the sacrum. Relations—It corresponds, by its internal and ante- rior surface, to the levator ani, externally and posteriorly to the lesser sacro-sciatic ligament. Action.—To support and raise the coccyx, and thus preserve the position of the rectum and uterus, with the vagina. P£Nis._This organ, in its collapsed condition, is cy- lindrical, and when distended, prismatic, the margins bemg formed below by the urethra, and on each side by the crura. The principal bulk of the organ is formed by the crura and corpus spongiosum urethra; and in addition, there are several superficial investments which require individual examination. The skin is fine and delicate, of a brownish colour, especially on the inferior surface, very moveable, and, tracing this investment for- wards to the corona glandis, it becomes free, and forms the prepuce by a replication or folding on itself; at the corona and glans it adheres very intimately to the sub jacent structures—in the former, on account of its pro longations into a series of follicles (glandule Tysoni or odoriferffi), which surrounds the corona, and secretes a viscid semifluid matter, the precise use of which is not410 THE MUSCULAR SYSTEM. well understood. On the inferior aspect of the glans the skin forms a fold continuous posteriorly with the prepuce, and in front with the inferior angle of the ure- thral orifice; this receives the name of " frsenum-prsepu- tiale," its use appearing to be to connect the prepuce with the glans penis during erection of the organ, and also to curve the orifice downwards in order to direct the seminal fluid backwards towards the os uteri; beneath the skin is observed the dartoid tissue, similar to that of the scrotum, with which it is continuous below; it is lax and fine, like the subcutaneous areolar tissue; this latter is abundant in all parts of the organ, and par- ticularly so between the layers of the prepuce, its ex- treme laxity accounting for the facility with which serous infiltration occurs; but at the corona glandis, on the glans and frsenum, it is much more dense; and in the latter situation its character is distinctly fibrous, the fibrillse being of unequal diameters, and often twisted into coils, the yellow fibrous element predominating. This subcutaneous areolar tissue is thick, and often lamellated at the root of the penis, where it is continued from the pubis as the false suspensory ligament; but anterior to this, it ceases to form laminae, becoming weak and reticular, but never adipose, as on the abdomen. The fascias of the penis consist of a superficial and deep layer, the former being derived from Scarpa's fascia, the latter being the expansion of the true suspensory liga- ment. The superficial fascia passes from the abdomen beneath the false suspensory ligament, and invests the whole organ, but cannot be traced beyond the corona, nor does any of its margin appear to pass into the pre- puce; on its surface the following parts may be seen:— above, the dorsal cutaneous veins and arteries; late- rally,'cutaneous branches of the dorsal nerve; and in- teriorly, the long perineal and pudendal nerves. DoKSAL Cutaneous Artery.—This is commonly . known as the inferior external pudic, a branch of the femoral; it pierces the proper sheath of that vessel, crosses the pectineus muscle, then perforates the pubic portion of the fascia lata, and divides into a superior branch, which crosses the crus penis near the pubis, then turns forwards, and can often be traced to the prepuce 1T 2 PENIS. 41 1 and corona, wliere it anastomoses with the deep dorsal artery. Dorsal Cutaneous Veins—These are tegumentary, and commence by numerous radicles from the prepuce' run backwards, receiving all the cutaneous branches from the inferior part of the organ, which are most nu- merous in that situation, then communicate with the superficial pudic, and at the pubis dip deep to join the proper dorsal vein. The lateral cutaneous nerves are derived from the dorsal, and run downwards, formino- arches, the convexity directed forwards, and commu- nicating with the long perineal and pudendal, which have been already described in the anatomy of the Pe- rineum. True Suspensory Ligament.—This fibrous layer is strong, dense, and triangular, attached posteriorly to the symphisis pubis, where it is continuous with the de- cussating fibres of the external oblique tendon, and is iully one inch and a half in depth; the anterior supe- rior edge is free and round; the inferior and posterior IS split, and expands to invest the organ with a dense unyielding covering which binds down the dorsal vein and artery, also the nerve between the layers of this ligament. There sometimes exists a thin flat band of muscular fibre, described by the late Dr. Houston in this situation; it arises from the rami of the pubis and ischium; passes upwards and inwards, and unites in a common tendon with its fellow over the dorsal vein of the penis; but, although constant in the lower animals such IS not the case in the human subject, as in forty- five subjects their existence could only once be fairly demonstrated. The deep fibres of the suspensory U<rl ment, with attachments similar to those muscles, are often confounded with them, but the former are of a similar structure m their entire course, whilst the lat ter are three-fourths fleshy, and the remainder tendi nous; they are separated from the accelerator urinse where it turns over the dorsum of the penis by the ex- pansion of the suspensory ligament, and from the erector penis by the crus. Use.—To compress the dorsal vein of the penis and prevent the return of venous blood. On the dorsum ofTHE MUSCULAR SYSTEM. 412 the penis the vein lies in the centre, the arteries exter- nal to the vein and the nerve again external to the artery from without inwards, the order being—nerve, artery, vein. The dorsal vein commences by a circular plexus, which is situated at the corona, communicating with the superficial veins, and also by numerous branches which pass through the fibrous covering of the crus with the deep veins; it then passes beneath the sub- pubic and above the triangular ligament, which mvests it in a fibrous tubule, afterwards between the anterior true ligaments of the bladder, divides into two branches, which run backwards and downwards, to terminate in the prostato-vesical plexus. Sometimes, but rarely, there are two veins on the dorsum. Dorsal Arteet.—This vessel is seen ascending be- tween the crus penis and pubis to reach its upper sur- face- its origin cannot be seen until the crus is raised from' the bone, when it is observed to arise, in common with the artery of the crus, from the pudic whilst it lies on the bone; it passes forwards beneath the suspen- sory ligament, and, reaching the corona, forms a plexi- form circle surrounding it, also sending branches to the prepuce. (For peculiarities see Vascular System.) Dorsal Nerve.—A branch of the pudic; pierces the triangular ligament, winds round the crus, and passing forward, external to the artery, it sends cutaneous branches downwards on the side of the penis, a large number to the prepuce, while those to the glans are lar!?e, flat, and terminating in loops like the nerves con- nected with the sense of touch at the extremities ot the fingers. ^ „ , Crura, or Corpora Cavernosa Penis.—Each crus consists of a fibrous cylinder, containing a mass of vas- cular texture, narrow and pointed behmd, truncated anteriorly; it arises from the anterior edge of the tuber and ascending ramus of the ischium, also from the de- scending ramus of the pubis; it passes upwards and in- wards, immediately beneath the symphisis, where they approximate and unite; and at the corona they are cut off from above and behind, downwards, and forwards, to support the glans, the fibrous tunic being continued between them.PENIS. 413 Relations.—In the perineum each crus is covered by the skin, two layers of fascia, erector penis, and ante- rior fibres of the accelerator urinee; it lies on the bone and termination of the pudic artery, and in the penis they have the common coverings of that organ, and are compressed towards each other, so that each wants one- fourth of being a perfect cylinder. In the groove be- neath is placed the corpus spongiosum urethrae; and in that on the dorsum, the dorsal vein, but not the artery, and hence the appearance of a section is not inaptly compared to a double-barrelled gun. Structure oftlu Corpus Cavernosum.—If a transverse section is made of the penis, it will be seen that a dense tunic of fibrous tissue surrounds the internal vascular structure, stronger inferiorly than superiorly, the fibres being principally longitudinal, and sometimes presenting a reddish tinge in the neighbourhood of the pubis. Now let a stream of water play on the section, and then draAv Its margins apart; the fibrous tunic is thick where the urethra is lodged, and from this point numerous glis- tening fibres (trabecule) radiate, to be attached to all points of the internal surface of the cylinder in order to limit distention. Make a second cut with a pair of scissors on one side of the middle line longitudinally; wash the part so as to remove the blood. This exhibits the— Septum Pectiniforme—A structure forming a verti - cahmperfectpartitionbetween thecrura, extending from the pubis to the extremity of those bodies, and consisting ot bands, with intervals between them more or less large but not of equal size. The bands are always more complete behind than before, and thicker above than be- low; and by careful manipulation we have been able to demonstrate that the septum is double, each crus contributing the bands for its own side: its use is to prevent over-distention of the urethral portion of the crura; also to allow a free communication between the cavernous structure of opposite sides. Questionable Muscular Fibres—Professor Muller has seen bundles of pale red fibres between the anastomo- sing vems, frequently connected by cross filaments itiese, he observes, when examined microscopically, do414 THE MUSCULAR SYSTEM. not present any resemblance to muscular fibres, nor did galvanism excite their contraction in a living horse. They diiFer from white fibrous tissue in not yield- ing gelatine on long boiling, and from elastic tissue, in being soluble in acetic acid, and precipitated from the solution by ferro-cyanuret of potassium (Muller's Phy- siology, by Bailey, p. 250). Valentine believes that muscular fibres are attached to the trabeculse, and pass from thence to the walls of the veins; and he com- pares them to the muscular fibres of the intestines or non-striped class. He states that they are of use in dilating the veins, and thus causing erection (Mul- ler's Archiv. 1838, p. 182). The crura are supplied by nerves from two sources,—from the hypogastric plexus of the sympathetic, and also from the internal pudic; these ramify in the vascular network (MuUer, ut su- pra). Guenther observed, when these nerves were di- vided, that erection was prevented in the horse; but his experiment only applied to the internal pudic branches. (Meckel's Archiv. 1828, p. 364). Vessels of the Cruka.—The artery arises from the internal pudic, as that vessel lies on the bone. It en- ters the crus obliquely, runs on the side of the septum pectiniforme, frequently communicating with its fellow. At the extremity of the crus it pierces the fibrous tunic, and enters the glans—a fact denied by many anato- mists, but quite evident in a well-injected subject. MuUer thus describes the branches of this artery:— " The arteries of the corpora cavernosa have two sets of branches: one set are the ultimate ramuscules, which terminate in the minute radicles of the veins, and are destined for the nutrition of the part; the other set come off from the side of the arteries, and consist of short tendril-like branches, terminating abruptly by rounded, apparently closed, extremities, turned back somewhat on themselves. These are sometimes single; sometimes several arise by one stem, forming a tuft; i have named them 'arterial helicina^.' They project into the venous cells, and are found principally m the pos- terior part of the corpora cavernosa and spongiosa urethra."-(Muller, by Bailey, p. 252.) He believes that they pour their blood into the venous cells by theirPENIS. 415 closed extremities; but Valentin objects to the exis- tence of those helicine arteries, as he believes that the arteries are dilated before their junction with the veins, and that these are surrounded by elastic bands, which curl at the extremities when divided, producing the ap- rently curved termination. The veins of the crura commence by cells, the efferent branches being the dor- sal veins and deep branches that pierce the triangular ligament at the pubis, and open into the prostato-vesical plexus. The use of the crura is to cause the erection of the organ by distention of the venous cells, and many causes have been assigned for this state. It is attri- buted to the helicine arterial terminations (Muller); to the active dilatation of the venous cells themselves (Chaussier); to muscular dilatation of the veins (Va- lentine) ; to the action of the erector penis (Krause); to that of the compressores venje dorsalis penis (Hous- ton) ; to contraction of the dartoid tissue (Todd and Bowman). The Corpus Spongiosum Urethra commences at the bulb, and terminates at the glans penis. The former is covered by the accelerator urinas and the anterior ex- pansion of the triangular ligament, Avhich connects it to the surface of that plane of fibrous membrane as high as the symphisis pubis. It has been stated that the corpus spongiosum lies in a groove between the crura; but when the integuments and fascia have been removed. It still is covered by a proper investing fascia, which seems to be a continuation of the true suspensory liga- ment. This on each side splits to inclose the urethra, the deep layer connecting it to the fibrous crus, to which It adheres intimately. If this fascia is now traced forwards, it will be observed to expand on the corona and glans penis, which it covers, serving to maintain the connexion between the crura and glans, and also preventing over-distention of the latter. When the glans penis is dissected from the crura, its figure is ca- pitate, like a mushroom, and consists of the corpus spongiosum, expanded superiorly and laterally, the in- vesting skin and urethral fasciaj connecting it to the crura, together with the terminal branch of the arteria corporis cavernosi penis.416 THK MUSCULAR SYSTEM. Structure This is similar to the cavernous bodies; but here it is expanded into a thin layer, hollowed in the centre, forming the urethra. On the superficial surface some reddish longitudinal fibres are seen, con- ceived by Home, Wilson, and Hunter, to be muscular; but this opinion is, however, erroneous. Development of the Penis.—This appears about the sixth week as a small papilla in front of the anus, and, advancing forwards, exhibits inferiorly a canalicular depression; at the second month two prominent folds appear on either side,—the rudiments ol' the future scro- tum or labia; in the fourth month the canalicular cleft is closed, and becomes the urethra; and lastly, the la- teral folds coalesce in the middle of the fifth month, constituting the raphe of the scrotum; but the corpora cavernosa do not attain their full degree of develop- ment until the period of puberty arrives. THE BLADDER AND ITS APPENDAGES. To examine the urinary bladder, the student should make a lateral section of the pelvis by sawing through the pubis, half-an-inch to the right side of the symphisis, then separating the ligaments on the right side and pressing the organ towards the left, sawing through the sacrum on a line with the pubic section; he should fill the rectum with hair or tow, and inflate the blad- der from the ureter, and afterwards secure it with a ligature. The bladder in foetal life is situated in the abdomen; but as the pelvis expands in the infant, it sinks to the lower part of the hypogastric region, and on its still further expansion falls into the cavity of the true pelvis, where it is found in the adult. In the foetus its outline is cylindrical, in the infant pyra- midal, the base above, the apex inferiorly at the neck, which at that period is the most dependent portion of the viscus; but in the adult, in consequence of the de- velopment of the inferior fundus, the figure is reversed, the "bas fond" being the most dependent part; but the cervix can be made so by a slight inclination of the body forwards. In the empty state the organ is trian- gular, the base inferiorly; and when in a condition of or-BLADDER. 417 dinary plenitude its figure is ovoid, the base resting on and closely applied to the anterior face of the rectum: but when the organ is over-distended by accumulated contents, its abdominal portion expands much more than the the pelvic, and it is then larger above and bent forwards. In the foetus and infant the axis is ver- tical, but in the adult it is oblique, represented by a line passing from midway between the umbilicus and pubis to the base of the coccyx, depending in a great measure on the altered axis of the true pelvis. °This membranous reservoir is retained in situ by the pressure of the surrounding parts, and also by its ligaments, which are divided into true and false. The latter are five,—two lateral, two posterior, and one superior. The lateral are folds of peritoneum, which pass from the iliac fosste and levatores ani to the side of the blad- der, and contain in their anterior edge the vas deferens -, the posterior ligaments are also folds of the same mem- brane, triangular in figure, the apex below between the bladder and rectum; the base, which is lunated, looks upwards and forwards; the peritoneal recto-vesical cul de sac lies between the ligaments of opposite sides, and each contains between its layers the ureter anteriorly, and the obliterated hypogastric artery posteriorly' The superior is a single fold of peritoneum, with which three ligamentous cords are connected, namely, the urachus in the centre, and the obliterated hypogastric arteries on either side; it unites the bladder to the rectus abdominis. When these have been torn from their attachments, a fascial structure is still observed to afford fixity to the organ, forming the true liga- ments four in number,_two lateral and two anterior. In order to understand fully the formation of these li- gaments, it will be necessary to examine the fascia in detail. When the iliac fascia reaches the brim of the pelvis It adheres intimately to the bone, receiving the name of pelvic, which descends into the cavity of the true pelvis until it attains the margin of the levator am; here it splits into two layers—the external or ob- turator, which passes external to the levator ani, covers and adheres to the obturator internus, and is attached to the descending ramus of the pubis and ascending of T 3 ^418 THE MUSCULAR SYSTEM, the ischium, to the falciform process of the great sacro- sciatic ligament, forming the canal for the pudic artery, and at the great sacro-sciatic notch it appears to form a lunated margin ; but such is not really the case, tu- bular prolongations being sent on the parts which escape by that opening. From this point a thin layer is conti- nued inwards, to cover the pyriformis and sacral plexus, behind the internal iliac artery and its branches. As it passes from the origin of the levator ani, a thin pro- cess is prolonged on the perineal surface of that muscle, that becomes continuous with the posterior layer of the base of the triangular ligament. Relations.—Externally, bone, obturator internus, in- ternal pudic nerve, artery, and vein: internally, the ischio-rectal fossa and its contents. The Internal or Vesical Layer of the Pelvic Fascia passes inwards and downwards on the pelvic surface of the levator ani, to which it adheres, reaches the side of the inferior fundus of the bladder, and half-an-inch above the vesiculse seminales divides into two portions, a superior and inferior. The superior passes upwards, expanding upon the upper four-fifths of the organ; the inferior, much stronger, divides into a superior and inferior layer, that run above and below the vesiculse seminales, forming a loose cap- sule for these bodies; at the inner edge again uniting, that with its fellow it may constitute the recto-vesical fascia, or Tyrrell's layer, which is exceedingly dense. The anterior edge of these ligaments is united with the anterior true, and the posterior margin incloses the rec- tum in a tubule, completed by the fascia of the opposite side. These ligaments are higher before than behind, being also stronger in the former situation, where they adhere to the prostate, forming the lateral part of its capsule. The anterior true ligaments are strong and dense, and ^re exposed by drawing the bladder back- wards from the pubis; anteriorly they arise froin the symphisis, pass backwards above the prostate, and ex- panding, are inserted into the longitudinal fibres on the anterior surface of the bladder; superiorly they are con- cave and smooth, the dorsal vein of the penis running backwards between them, but merely m a groove,419 BLADDER. there being no absolute separation, a thin covering of fascia preserving their relations to the ligaments. The external edge of each is united with the lateral liga- ment at the pubic attachment, the lower margin re- ceiving the posterior layer of the apex of the triangular ligament, and the superior, the fascia transversalis; the upper surface corresponds to a cellular interval behind the pubis, and the lower to the prostate, forming the superior part of its capsule; posteriorly they are so in- timately connected with the longitudinal muscular fibres of the bladder, that some authors consider them to be the tendons of those musclesv The Bladder is divided into a summit, body, in- ferior fundus, and cervix, these occurring from above downwards in the order in which they are enume- rated ; it is also divided anatomically into six re- gions,—anterior, posterior, lateral, superior, and in- ferior. The anterior corresponds to the recti, parti- cularly when the organ is distended either wholly or partially, to the posterior surface of the symphisis pubis, anterior true ligaments, triangular ligament, and prostate gland; the posterior is in relation with the pos- terior false ligaments and their contents, recto-vesical cul de sac, and the convolutions of the ilium and rectum; la- terally the lateral true and false ligaments, levatores ani, and vasa deferentia, with the obliterated hypogastric arteries; the superior region corresponds to the superior false ligament, hypogastric arteries, and urachus, also to the convolutions of the small intestines in the erect posi- tion ; the inferior region is in relation with the recto-ve- sical fascia, rectum, vesicute seminales, and vasa defe- rentia. The coats or coverings are five in number, se- rous, cellular, muscular, deep cellular or submucous, and mucous. The serous tunic is a partial investment only, the anterior region being wholly uncovered, the pos- terior altogether covered; the lateral as far forwards as the vasa deferentia, or about one-half; the superior as far as the urachus and obliterated hypogastric arteries ■ the inferior to the base of the vesiculas seminales. Thus about the posterior half of the whole organ is invested by peritoneum; but there is a larger amount covered when it is distended, as it enlarges between the layersTHE MUSCULAR SYSTEM. 420 of the false ligaments, stretching them on its surface. This serous coat is but loosely attached, and in the col- lapsed condition of the bladder, it presents many trans- verse rugae, particularly posteriorly. The cellular tunic is derived from the vesical fascia, splitting to invest the organ; it adheres most intimately to the subjacent mus- cular fibres, sending processes to invest the several fas- ciculi, and sinking deep to be attached to the deep cel- lular coat; it is strong where the organ is deficient of serous covering, and particularly so where it forms the recto-vesical layer at the base of the bladder, and sup- ports the veins in that situation. The muscular coat is well marked, and much redder in colour than the fibres of the small or large intestines; but it somewhat resembles those of the rectum and oesophagus, at least in colour and thickness; this, although forming one uninterrupted plane, still, in consequence of difference in direction and arrangement, is described as consisting of longitudinal, oblique, circular, and reticular planes or sets. The longitudinal are strong and distinct on the anterior and posterior surfaces; they arise from the urachus, and descend on the fore and back part of the orcran; those on the side are oblique in direction, and evidently merely the longitudinal fibres deviating from their usual direction; but although the urachus is stated as the superior attachment, still on either side of it, numbers may be seen, looped, passing over the suni- mit, both anterior and posterior fibres being conti- nuous; and again, others are observed to dip deep, like the cardiac fibres at the apex of that organ, to reach the deep reticular layer. In one case, where there was a very slight thickening of the muscular tunic, the ar- rangement at the summit forcibly reminded us of the crucial weaving of the " apicial" bands of the heart m their anatomy. The inferior termination of these fibres may be divided into anterior, posterior, and lateral, and each acrain subdivided into a superficial and deep layer :— anterior superficial, strong and interlaced, sometimes, but by no means constantly, decussating, are inserted into the symphisis pubis by the anterior ligaments, which are sometimes described as the tendons of these muscles; anterior deep are few, and weaker than theBLADDER. 421 last; some are attached to the superior edge of the prostate, and when that gland is deficient above the urethra, passing along its surface as far as the trian- gular ligament; others sink deep, a few being inserted directly into the cervix, but the greater number re- turning on themselves, uniting with the deeper layer, or bending round the cervix laterally, to be inserted into the lateral edges of the cervical fibrous floor; su- perficial lateral are attached to the capsule of the prostate, and between it and the structure of the gland, the deep passing, some into the fibro-glandular tissue, while others are inserted into the cervix. The posterior su- perficial consist of two bands, that enter the notch in the posterior edge of the prostate, become flattened above the seminal vesicles, and can be traced to the verumontanum, or even to the membranous portion of the urethra; the deep form a distinct plane between thevesiculte seminales, bordered by Bell's muscles, which are the thickest longitudinal fibres of the organ; these terminate in the fibrous floor of the neck. Circular Fibres.—These are principally found in the lower third of the organ, forming a series of rings around it, some of which are parallel, while others in- terlace very obliquely. At the base of the trigone they form a dense band between the orifices of the ureters, to the inner lips of which they are attached, for the purpose of dilating those tubes, according to Bell, and thus aflfording a more ready passage for the urine; above, towards the upper fundus, they can be demonstrated with great difiiculty, while below they become conti- nuous with the annular fibres of the neck. Eeticular Fibres.—These are best observed by dis- secting off the mucous membrane from within; in per- fectly healthy organs they are not very evident, but in the condition known as sacculated bladder, they are most distinct, their separation allowing the mucous membrane to become protruded in the intervals. Submucous Tunic, or Internal Cellular.—This is weak above, but exceedingly strong below; it forms the bed in which the arteries and nerves are distributed hence designated by Bichat as the nervous coat; the in- ternal and external cellular tunics tend to preserve theTHE MUSCULAR SYSTEM. 422 connexion of the muscular fibres, and also assist in pre- venting over-distention. Use of the Muscular Coat—It diminishes the capacity of the whole organ, the deep fibres assisting at the same time in expanding the neck; they are much more energetic than the similar coats of other hollow viscera, and receive the principal amount of the blood supplied to the organ. The external layer, or detru- sor urinse, is partly under the control of the wiU, and in some degree involuntary; when the bladder is in the ordinary state of distention, the stimulus of pressure exercised by the urine is the excitor of reflex action, not only on the detrusor urinse, but likewise on the muscles associated in the acts of expulsion, these being, the levator es ani, abdominal muscles, and dia- phragm, with the acceleratores urinse. Now lay open the cavity from above to within an inch of the prostate, and examine the several parts brought into view. The mu- cous membrane is thin, and of a light reddish tinge, pale in the summit and body, more vascular inferiorly, smooth in all situations, nor does it possess the same amount of sensibility as the mucous lining of the ure- thra. A very small amount of mucous secretion is found upon its surface, insomuch that some authors have de- nied the existence of mucous follicles altogether; but they are present in large numbers, but still are exceed- ingly small and obscure. The cervix diminishes as it approaches the urethral orifice, the latter representing a semi-ellipse, the long axis placed transversely. Project- ing into its lower part is a small papillar elevation of mucous membrane, named uvula, or luette vesicae; this is not by any means constant. On either side of this, folds sometimes exist, with their concavities directed forwards; these are formed by the posterior expansion and bil'urcation of the verumontanum. Amussat con- ceived that he had detected transverse muscular fibres m connexion with them, and named the elevated crest the pyloric valve; but this is also a variable arrangement. Posterior to the uvula the structure of the bladder is pale, but thick, and highly sensitive; this is called tri- gone vesicae,—triangular in shape, the base posteriorly, the apex at the uvula, bounded laterally by two elevated423 BLADDER, bands, extending from the vesical orifice of the ureter to the uvula, and posteriorly by a curved line, the con- vexity directed forwards, drawn between the ureteric orifices. At the sides, this space measures about one inch and a quarter, and in the centre three-quarters of an inch. These lateral bands have been described by Bell as muscles arising from the vesical orifice of the ureter, and inserted into the uvula; their use being to preserve the obliquity of that tube, and prevent regur- gitation when the bladder is distended. Mr. Guthrie believes that they are of utility in preserving the pa- tency of these openings; and Amussat, that they draw downwards and backwards the uvula, and thus dilate the urethral orifice; they are not present in the female, which would go far to prove that their importance in preventing regurgitation is somewhat exaggerated. "In a subject, the bladder was carefully opened, and a sharp- pointed bistoury inserted beneath them, so as to divide all their fibres; a quantity of fluid was then introduced into the organ, the opening and urethra being secured. Forcible pressure was now made, but no fluid escaped mto the ureters."—(Dr. Harrison, in Todd's Encyclope- dia, Art. Bladder.) We have examined this portion of the bladder with much care, and have found these muscles in many instances absent, their place being Supplied by an elastic band of a similar structure to the trigone Itself; the latter always exhibited a well-marked elastic structure. On tracing it forwards, it expanded around the urethral orifice, becoming much thickened, receiv- mg externally the deep insertion of the longitudinal fibres of the bladder; in some cases only could any cir- cular muscular fibres be detected, so that their presence cannot be essential to the functions of the part. Dr. Harrison describes the opening as consisting, superiorly and laterally, of muscular fibres, the floor of the neck being fibrous merely. The retention of the urine in the bladder would in part depend on muscular contractility, and be assisted by elastic pressure in some degree (Todd's Encyclopedia, Art. Bladder). The Openings of the Ureters are two oblique slits at the posterior and lateral angle of the trigone; the long measurement of each aperture being directed ob-424 THE MUSCULAR SYSTEM. liquely forwards and inwards; if a fine probe is intro- duced into the opening, and passed upwards, it will be seen that the tube first enters the muscular coat di- rectly, then passes obliquely for about six lines, and pierces the fibro-elastic tissue of the trigone, at its pos- terior external angle. At the point of termination there is a direct fusion of the fibrous coat of the ureter and the trigone, the reticular muscular fibres and ex- ternal cellular coat of the bladder being continued on its external surface for some distance upwards. • Arteries of the Bladder—These are divisible into anterior and posterior; the anterior are several twigs, arising from the obturator and its transverse pubic branch -, the posterior consist of superior, middle, and infe- rior : the first arises from the contracted hypogastric ar- tery, near the summit of the organ; the second is derived directly from the internal iliac; and the third are most numerous, being branches of the pudic sciatic, middle hemorrhoidal, and are distributed to the inferior fundus. Veins These are situated at the inferior fundus, where they form a plexus, receiving in front the pro- static plexus, laterally the dorsal veins of the penis, and also the branches of the vesical veins. In old age these veins are often large and varicose, sometimes con- taining veinstones or phlebolites, and are supported by the recto-vesical fascia, surrounded by lax areolar tissue; they frequently adhere to this fascia, particu- larly in advanced life, and if divided in the operation of lithotomy, give rise to troublesome hemorrhage, because the mouths are kept open by the adhesion to the fascia. These veins pour their contents into the in- ternal iliac by two efferent venous trunks provided with valves. t • , • ^ The Absorbents of the Bladder are divisible into two sets,—a superficial and deep plexus. The efferent vessels are found at the base, in the vicinity of the veins which they accompany, pass through the lumbar glands, in their course to the common lymphatic receptacle. Cruveilhier once saw them filled with pus m a case of catarrh, but still, their existence has been disputed, and the fact of the watery parts of the urine being absorbed during retention proves nothing, as this iunc-PROSTATE GLAND. 425 tion may be, and is, probably, performed by the veins. The nerves of the bladder are derived from the sacral plexus of the spinal and the hypogastric plexus of the sympathetic system. The Urethra is divided into three portions,—prosta- tic, membranous, and spongy; the first being one inch and a quarter, the second from a quarter to three-quar- ters of an inch, and the remainder of the canal, which is from nine to ten and a half inches in length, is formed by the corpus spongiosum urethrse. The body named Prostate Gland is situated at the commencement of the canal, which it surrounds; the shape is that of a horse-chestnut, or triangular, the base behind, the apex in front, convex inferiorly, flattened above, surrounded on its surface by a dense capsule, formed above by the anterior vesical ligaments, on either side by the lateral, and inferiorly by the reflected layer of the triangular ligament, and between the capsule and the proper structure of the gland, the prostatic plexus of veins is found. Its boundaries are,—above, the an- terior vesical ligaments and dorsal vein of the penis; below, the rectum; laterally, the external true vesical ligaments and levatores ani (compressores prostati); posteriorly, the neck of the bladder, vesicula; seminales, and vasa deferentia; anteriorly, the triangular ligament, membranous portion of urethra, Wilson's and Guth- rie's muscles, and the anti-prostatic glands. This gland measures from apex to base fifteen lines; trans- versely at base, eighteen lines; vertically at base, twelve lines (Cruveilhier). In thirty-two cases that we mea- sured, the mean length was one inch and a third; the width at the base one inch and a quarter; the vertical a little more than three-quarters of an inch, which are some- what less than those of Cruveilhier. The neck of the bladder in some cases is surrounded by the base, but the gland is generally lunated, so as to exclude that part. The urethra runs through its substance, tWo- thirds being inferior, and one superior; sometimes it is altogether deficient above the canal, when the longitu- dinal fibres of the bladder compensate for its absence. It is divided into two lateral and a middle lobe (Home); the lateral are united anteriorly, but posteriorly they426 THE MUSCULAR SYSTEM. project backwards on each side of the vesical cervix, covering this part of the bladder more on each side than above or below; on the under surface there is not any separation, but merely a furrow between them. The middle lobe is exposed by turning the bladder on its forepart, and throwing forwards the vesiculse semi- nales and vasa deferentia; it lies between the ducts of the latter and the floor of the iirethra; its usual appearance is that of a flat band, uniting the lateral lobes posteriorly, the nipple-shaped projection of Home being a fallacy. Therelations of the middle lobe are,—below, the ductus communis ejaculatorius, prolonged muscular fibres from the bladder, and the junction of the lateral lobes; above, the mucous membrane and uvula, and on each side, the lateral lobes. Now let the gland be laid open above, to examine its surface: the mucous membrane is pale and loose in the middle line, but closely attached to the other parts of the surface. The Canal is small behind, somewhat expanded in the centre, and contracted again in front, also slightly concave upwards, the inferior part being called the sinus; on either sides of the middle line from ten to sixteen openings are observed, of suflicient size to admit the introduction of a bristle, and with a low mag- nifying power, innumerable smaller orifices are visible; through the former the mucous membrane is continued down into an equal number of pouches or crypts, the latter being simple involutions of that membrane, not passing, like the first, into the proper structure of the gland, but terminating in the submucous tissue. The Verumontanum commences by a slight elevation of the lining membrane at the membranous portion, passes backwards, the fold then separating incloses the seminal papilla; again uniting posteriorly, then di- viding into two frseaula, bounding the floor of the cervix at its vesicular extremity on each side of the luette; the fossete formed by the separation of the veru- montanum is called sinus pocularis, and the projecting papilla, the seminal caruncle, which resembles in its appearance one of the papilla? circumvallat^ m the tongue; on this point occurs the opening of the ductus communis ejaculatorius.PROSTATE GLAND. 427 The structure of the prostate cannot be well deter- mined when examined with the naked eye; it appears of a homogeneous nature, but with a low magnifier, after maceration in spirit, a section exhibits all the characters of a soft subfibrous texture, more dense as it surrounds the urethra than on the surface. The idea of a glandular structure is perfectly gratuitous; it is true that there are some involutions of the mucous membrane into its tissue, but they are so few in com- parison to the size of the body that they rather refute than confirm the opinion of its glandular nature. When the capsule is removed, the body is easily torn, particularly in the longitudinal direction, the lacerated surface appearing to be fibrous, these being apparently prolonged from the muscular tunic of the bladder. The use of the prostate is to fix the neck of the bladder, and is further of utility in preserving the position of the seminal ducts, its follicular secretion not possess- ing any manifest importance in the function of gene- ration. In the dissection made for the examination of the middle lobe of the prostate, an opportunity will be afforded for studying that body, first discovered by Morgagni, and subsequently minutely described by Weber, as the vesicula prostatica, now connected with the name of the latter physiologist as the Weberian or- gan. It is a small, flask-shaped vesicle, from a quar- ter to half-an-inch in length, and about two lines in width at its dilated portion, lying obliquely, the con- stricted neck turned downwards and forwards, the fundus upwards and backwards, bounded above by the uvula vesicae and the elastic tissue at the floor of the vesical cervix; also by the middle lobe of the prostate; below by Tyrrell's fascia; and laterally by the common ejaculatory ducts, with which it is imbedded in con- densed areolar tissue; its duct terminates on the ante- rior part or declivity of the verumoutanum, between the seminal openings. This organ is conceived to be a trace of the female uterus, and by others as the remains of the duct of the Wolfiian bodies. In order to obtain a good view of this structure the parts must be recent, and all pressure on the prostate carefully avoided JTHE MUSCULAR SYSTEM. 428 otherwise its rupture may lead to the erroneous con- clusion of its absence in some cases; it is always present in man, and indeed in the whole class of mammalia. VESicuLiE Skminales.—These are symmetrical organs, of an ovoid figure, situated diverging at the base of the bladder; each vesicle is bounded internally by the vas deferens; externally by the lateral true ligaments; pos- teriorly and externally the ureter and cul de sac of the peritoneum; anteriorly by the prostate; inferiorly by the rectum; and above by the inferior fundus of the bladder and trigone; their colour is grey, and they are also lobulated, in length being about two and a half inches; in width half-an-inch, and in depth, a quarter of an inch. They vary in size, being small in the child and in old age, large in the adult. The left is some- what smaller than the right, and the surface is invested by a dense fibrous layer, formed by the splitting of the recto-vesical fascia, which also includes the vas deferens in the same capsule; they are likewise moveable on the rectum and bladder, being connected to the latter by a yellowish, fine, areolar tissue. A section of the vesicle exhibits a cellular structure, with a dense connecting fibrous bed, but if the body is subjected to maceration, so as to destroy this tissue, it can be unravelled into a tube about nine inches in length, with dense tunics, re- sembling the vas deferens. The anterior extremity is narrow and prolonged into a duct, which joins the vas deferens to form the ductus communis ejaculatorius, and in this situation the vas deferens is flattened and sometimes lobulated; the common ejaculatory duct is from half to three-quarters of an inch in length; it enters a notch in the base of the prostate, losing the dense deferential tunic at this point; passes upwards and forwards above the junction of the lateral lobes, and below the middle, opens on the seminal papilla of the verumontanum in the prostatic portion of the urethra; the oblique passage of the duct through the prostate, and for so great a distance, obviates the tendency ot the expulsion of the semen during micturition, a co- lumn of urine always pressing on the thin and unre- sisting duct during that act, which precludes any trans- mission by those canals.429 URETHRA, The vesiculffi seminales are reservoirs for the seminal fluid, which is proved by several circumstances: firstly, that in animals where coitus is rapid they are inva- riably present, and when, on the contrary, that act is prolonged, as in the canine species, these sacs are absent; secondly, the semen is perfect in all its essential constituents before it arrives at this ,point, and conse- quently they cannot add any important element to that secretion; thirdly, fluids injected into the vas deferens passes first into the vesicula, before it reaches the ure- thra. During the act of coitus, the irritation of the glans excites a reflex action of the levatores ani, by which the secretion is urged from the vesicles into the urethra, from which it is then ejected in jerks. But in opposition to this view it may be remarked, that Hun- ter found the vesicles full even to distention, imme- 1 diately after coitus, and in a case where the testicle had 1 been removed, the vesicle on the corresponding side was ( discovered to be quite full. Again, spermatozoa are not <. observed in the fluid taken from the vesicula in any i great amount, and in the elephant there exist special : seminal reservoirs, although the vesiculse are present. Membranous Portion of the Urethra extends from I the prostate to the bulb; it is arched upwards and for- 1 wards, lying partly within and partly without the pelvis; uts length varies above and below—superiorly being from t three-quarters to an inch, and inferiorly scarcely half- san-mch; the disparity results from the direction of the I bulb being downwards and backwards, overlapping the 1 lower surface of the canal, and thus diminishing the s space for the opening of the urethra in lithotomy. It fperforates the triangular ligament one inch below the ssymphisis pubis, but as the two layers are somewhat sseparated at this point, the greater portion of this di- msion of the canal is found between them, and as it Fpasses through, a layer or process is reflected forwards con the bulb, and a similar process backwards on the nntrapelvic portion of tiie canal and under surface of tthe prostate, for which it assists in forming the capsule, rbecoming continuous with the recto-vesical layer, or iTyrrell's fascia. This should not be confounded with430 THE MUSCULAR SYSTEM. the posterior reflection of the base of the ligament which lies below the levator ani, as that muscle separates the two portions of fascia from each other. Ihis por- tion of the canal is fixed and unalterable in its position, and with the exception of the inlet and outlet is the most contracted division of the urethra. It is peculiar in structure; from within outwards there is, first the mucous membrane, pale and fine, almost devoid of la- cuna and intimately adherent to the subjacent struc- ture, which is dense and fibrous, but dimimshmg m density and thickness towards the apex of the prostate; again, external to this, a spongy venous structure is rnoulded on its surface; and lastly, between the layers of the triangular ligament, a fibro-muscular ring, va- riously developed in difi-erent cases, whilst the intrapel- vic portion obtains as a substitute the posterior reflec- tion of the triangular ligament. Between the lower aspect and the rectum a triangular space ^^I'^^^l ^^' fore described, about an inch from the verge of the anus where Mr. Guthrie advises the urethra to be opened in impermeable stricture, an operation which in its facility displays the advantage of connecting anatomy with operative surgery.

The operation for removing a calculus from the male bladder consists essentially in arriving at the most pos- terior portion of the urethral canal, laying it open, and thus extricating the foreign body through the artifi- cially dilated space. To accomplish this object two dif- ferent modes of proceeding have been adopted,—the first, in which the operation is completed on one side (Che- selden); the second, where both sides of the perineum are made to participate equally in the operation (bila- teral—Dupuytren). The former is that principally per- formed by British surgeons. The patient being drawn to the edge of a table of a convenient height, the buttocks supported on a pillow, the wrists secured to the outer side of the ankle-joint, while an assistant stands at each side to divaricate the thighs, and also to support the staff firmly against the symphisis pubis. The staff is grooved on the convexity, sometimes a little to the right side, but does not reach the point, and should be intro- duced before the patient is secured in the requisite po- sition. Let the scrotum be now elevated, and any scat- tered hairs shaved from the surface of the perineum; the first incision commences at one side of the raphe, on the left of the mesian line, and one inch and a quarter in front of the anus, being continued downwards and backwards to midway between the anus and tuber is- chii, its extent being about three inches. The knife should pass through the skin, fasciae, and fat, with the fibres of the superficial sphincter; the long perineal ar- tery may escape, because it is parallel to the line of in- cision, but the transverse artery (superficial) is always divided. The second incision is commenced half-an-inch below the last, in order to avoid the artery of the bulb, and is then continued in a line with the former, the knife passing through the triangular space between the erector penis and accelerator urinse, and dividing the base of the triangular ligament, transversalis perinei, mus- cle, anterior fibres of the levator ani, and Wilson's mus- cles. The fore-finger of the left hand is now to be in- troduced into the wound, and the nail should press theTHE MUSCULAR SYSTEM. membranous wall of the urethra into the grooves; the point of the scalpel, thus guided, is passed into the ure- thra for about a quarter of an inch in length; and dur- ing this proceeding the fore-finger bears up the bulb, and the middle and ring fingers depress the rectum X probe-pointed bistoury, or the knife recommended bvMr Peile, now completes the oP^^f ^oint being passed into the groove, of which fact the SatorThould make himself perfectly certain; the edge being directed obliquely downwards ^^^^^1^%'^^^ left hand grasping the staff, and whilst the kmfe is pressed into the bkdder, the staff is gradually depressed ?n consonance with the axis of the prostate so that the ncisTn may be direct, and the prostate at tbe^ame tim raised as far from the rectum as possible.

The staff is now withdrawn, and the blades of the lithotome protruded, the instrument being previously reversed, so as to present its concavity downwards, and withdrawn in a direction downwards and forwards in the axis of the original wound, making a flap of the lower part of the prostate; the finger is then to be introduced into the bladder to direct the for- ceps to the stone. Dupuytren ascribes the following ad- vantages to this operation:—That the wound is in the widest part of the outlet of the pelvis; that it is easy of execution; that it is a direct opening; that the ejacu- latory ducts are more likely to escape injury; that there is more space for the extraction of a large stone, and that it is applicable to both sexes. However, Mr, Listen is of opinion that such an operation is rarely required. FEMORAL HERNIA. Let the extremity be raised on a block to a convenient height, and make an incision from the anterior superior spine of the ilium, along the outer side of the thigh, for about six inches; then curve it inwards towards the adductors, and raise the flap from without inwards. The superficial fascia in this region is strong externally, loaded with fat in the infant and female, but firm and frequently strengthened by aponeurotic bands in the male adult; it likewise consists of two lamina of un- equal density, separated by lymphatic glands, the three superficial branches of the femoral artery, with their corresponding veins,—namely, external pudic, external circumflex ilii, and superficial epigastric; these have been described with the superficial investments of the abdomen; the short saphenous nerve or branch of the u434 THE MUSCULAR SYSTEM. anterior crural is seen perforating the fascia about an inch and a half below Poupart's ligament; also the crural branch of the genito-crural nerve is observed, piercing the fascia a little to the outer side of the femoral artery, and its branches are-seen descending to the midd e third of the thigh. At the outer side, half-an-mch below the spineof the ilium, the musculo-cutaneous nerve, abranch of the lumbar plexus, pierces the fascia lata, one branch passing backwards to the gluteal region the other be- coming cutaneous, and descending on the anterior and external side of the thigh. The inguinal glands consis of two sets, lying between the layers of the superficial tX the'superior, which are parallel to Poupart's li- gament, are large and few in number and have been described with the anatomy of mgumal hernia; the in- ferior are more numerous and smaller, and are parallel to the saphenous vein, one being always situated at the entrance of the vein into the saphenic opemng, and maW.en enlarged simulate femoral hernia; through Tese the superficial lymphatics pass m their course to Jeach the de^ep vessels.

The crural arch is that space included be- tween Poupart's ligament in front and the bone poste- riorly; it is son\ewhat triangular, the base externally, and the apex at Gimbernaut's ligament; most externally the external or musculo-cutaneous nerve passes beneath the ligament, which, with the origin of the sartorius, assists in closing the crural arch at this point; next in order the iliacus internus, anterior crural nerve, then the psoas magnus, the outer wall of the sheath of the ves- sels, next the femoral artery, the middle septum, the femoral vein, internal septum crurale, the femoral ring filled by a gland, through which pass the deep lympha- tics, also the crural branch of the genito-crural nerve, and lastly, Gimbernaut's ligament. Now continue the dissection of the fascia of the thigh. The fascia lata is divided into three portions,—iliac, pubic, and cribriform; the iliac is the most external and the strongest; it is likewise on a plain anterior to the pubic, and is attached above to the crest of the ilium and the lower edge of Poupart's ligament, as far inwards as the base of Gim- bernaut's ligament; the internal edge is lunated, form- ing the falciform process of the fascia lata, the concavity looking downwards and inwards, and is divided into a superior cornu (Hey's ligament), and an inferior cornu (Burns's ligament), with an intervening edge; the su- perior cornu is of different strengths, being thick in the male adult, thin and often separated into bands in the female and child, attached superiorly to Poupart's liga- ment, at the internal fifth of which it divides into two processes : one superficial, thin, is prolonged downwards and inwards on the pubic portion of the fascia lata (Colles's ligament, see Flood on Hernia); the second, stronger, dips backwards, and is attached to the linea ileo-pectinea and base of Gimbernaut's ligament (Hey), which lies in front and internal to the femoral ring; the inferior cornu is sharp and well defined; it unites with the pubic portion to form the saphenic opening, the whole arch being described by some authors as consti- tuting the saphenic aperture; but it is much better to restrict that term to the inferior portion only, formed u 2 4436 THE MUSCULAR SYSTEM. by the junction of Burns's ligament with the pubic di- vision—the concavity being directed upwards, and the edge prolonged backwards on the saphena vein to be- conie continuous with the sheath of the femoral vessels; but when the vein is raised from its position, the han- dle of the scalpel can be passed between the saphenic opening and the sheathof the vessels for about two lines, showing that the reflection is exceedingly weak. Ihe pubic portion is thinner than the last, and lies on a plane posterior to it, attached to the rami ot the ischium and pubis, to the symphisis and linea ileo-pectmea, where it becomes continuous with the iliac fascia, correspond- in- to the falciform process; the external edge passes outwards beneath the femoral vessels, which should be removed to see it, and at the margin of the psoas splits into two layers, one of which passes m front of that muscle, and is continuous with the fascia iliaca, forming the posterior part of the sheath of the vessels; the pos- terior passes behind the psoas tendon, and is attached to the capsule of the hip-joint, covermg the bursa m that situation; at the saphenic opening it does not split but at that point, or fourteen lines below Poupart s liga- ment itToins the iliac division. The cribriform portion occupies the central position between the two former, covering the saphenic opening, in structure being weak cellular and f^tty, and continued upwards as Scarpa s Wr on the abdomen, the superficial surface being blended with the subcutaneous layer; the superficial branches of the femoral artery and short saphenous nerve ogether with the internal saphena vein, pierce ?n their course, and from this the name cribri orm is de- r ved It can easily be raised from the pubic portion but wben an attempt is made to detach it from the iliac division, a direct continuity is observed between hem a circumstance which did not escape the o^se ; ^^j^ the late Mr. Colles; any separation or definition ol the falciform process is therefore on y arbitrary In fat sub jects it is thick and loaded with adeps, but nj^l e t^ •and emaciated it partakes of the f ^° the iliac portion, being loosely attached to he skm but intimately to the sheath of the femoral vessels which lie beneath it.437 FEMORAL HERNIA. Next proceed to the examination of the iliac fascia in the false pelvis and in the right iliac fossa; tear the cascum from its attachments, also the peritoneum, ob- serving the lax areolar tissue connecting the intestine to the subjacent fascia, sometimes the seat of ileo-csecal abscess; in the left, raise the sigmoid flexure of the colon, which occupies only the superior part of the fossa, and the peritoneum, wrhich invests it. The areolar tissue here is more dense and smaller in quantity, and less subject to abscess; the external iliac vessels are seen covered by a thin fascia, and on their external and an- terior part, the genito-crural nerve, and, running obli- quely towards the anterior spine of the ilium, is the musculo-cutaneous, sometimes double, all these being superficial to the iliac fascia. Sheath of the External Iliac Vessels.—This is a condensation of the subperitoneal areolar tissue, some- times described as a process of the iliac fascia, which is evidently incorrect; it covers and adheres to the artery and vein, and sends also a thin septum between them, separating and connecting them to each other. On tracing the fascia downwards on the forepart of the ves- sels to Poupart's ligament, it turns upwards, becoming lax and often divisible into two or more layers, and is lost on the deep surface of the fascia transversalis, between it and the peritoneum, thus closing the posterior aspect of the femoral ring; when this is removed the iliac fascia can be examined; it is attached to the internal lip of the crest of the ilium, to the posterior margin of Poiipart's ligament, from the anterior superior spinous process of the ilium to the outer edge of the external iliac artery, and in this situation it is continuous with the fascia transversalis, a dense white line parallel to Poupart's ligament signifying their junction; this forms one wall of a fibrous canal, in which is found the internal circum- flex ilii artery, accompanied by one or two veins; the fascia then passes beneath the artery and over the psoas, behind which it sends a thin layer, then becomes at- tached to the linea ileo-pectinea, as far inwards as the base of Gimbernaut's ligament; and as it passes on the bone, it sends a layer downwards into the thigh to form the posterior part of the sheath of the vessels; a similar i438 THE MUSCULAR SYSTEM. process sent down from the fascia transversalis, as it ad- heres to Poupart's ligament, forming the anterior part. Now remove Abernethy's fascia from the posterior sur- face of the femoral ring; this opening has been compared to the internal abdominal ring, its figure being some- what triangular, the base externally at the femoral vein, the apex internally at Gimbernaut's ligament, bounded anteriorly by Poupart's ligament, the attach- ment of the fascia transversalis, and superior cornu ot the falciform process of the fascia lata; posteriorly by the liaea ileo-pectinea, origin of the pectineus muscle and the attachment of the iliac and pubic fascise to the bone; internally by the base of Gimbernau's ligament and ihe junctio'n of the four fasci^,-namely, the ihac and pubic portions of the fascia lata, fascia l^'^'^^/Z tranfversalis, and externally by the femoral vein and the internal septum crurale.

If the finger is still pressed forwards, it will emerge at the saphenic opening, where the her- nia ultimately becomes superficial, an analogy existing between this space and the canal engaged in inguinal hernia, the femoral ring, the crural canal, and the sa- phenic opening representing the internal ring, inguinal canal, and the external abdominal ring. Now divide the superior cornu of the iliac portion of the fascia from Poupart's ligament, and reflect it outwards in order to examine the femoral sheath, which is a funnel-shaped tube, larger above than below, prolonged superiorly from the iliac and transverse fascise; it remains strong to the saphenic opening, but we have traced it as a dis- tinct structure to the middle of Hunter's canal, where it is lost in a strong adherent sheath which surrounds the vessels. Above, it contains three canals separated by two septa, sent backwards from the transverse fascia to join the iliac; the external containing the artery, the middle, which is much larger, the vein, and the internal, the smallest, giving passage to the deep lymphatics. The septum separating the venous and lymphatic canals is exceedingly strong, and that which divides the artery and vein is also well marked, particularly in old subjects where the former vessel is diseased. A transverse section of both artery and vein exhibits very well the arrange- ment of this structure, and it exists in the whole course of the vessels to the inferior part of Hunter's canal. The occurrence of a femoral hernia is prevented between the anterior spine of the ilium and the external iliac artery, by the junction of the iliac and transverse fasciee; it rarely occurs in front of the femoral vessels, owing to the upward reflection of Abernethy's fascia, and the mode in which these vessels are wedged beneath Pou - part's ligament; Gimbernaut's ligament obviates any protrusion internal to the ring, as a general rule, but it is necessary to be aware that hernial protrusions have occurred in the three situations alluded to; but these are440 THE MUSCULAR SYSTEM. merely exceptional cases. . At the femoral ring there is less resistance than in any other part of the crural arch; the intestine or omentum having passed through the Ting, protrudes the peritoneum as its sac, and also car- ries before it Abernethy's fascia, as the fascia propria of the hernia, then passes downwards in the sheath of the vessels, separated from the vein by the hiternal septum crurale, which prevents injurious pressure on that ves- sel Whilst in this position, the coverings are:—1. Inte- gument; 2. Superficial fascia; 3. Cribriform fascia, an- terior layer of the sheath, fascia propria, and the perito- neal sac; but, the pressure still continuing to operate m a direction from above, the intestine descends until it reaches the saphenic opening, beyond which it cannot pass within the sheath, owing to the close adhesion ot that structure to the femoral vessels, and likewise to the entrance of the saphena into the femoral vein; nor can it pass dowAwards beneath the fascia lata m con- sequence of a process which is sent backwards from the margin of the saphenic opening on the femoral sheath; it therefore escapes through that sheath and cribriform fascia, and its further descent m this direc- tion is obviated by the superficial epigastric artery ascending, which curves the hernia upwards over Pou- part's ligament, and it lies here between Scarpa s and the superficial fascia; the covering being from superfi- cial to deep, integuments, superficial fascia, fascia pro- pria, and the peritoneal sac. The intestine may be strangulated by the following points:-by the orifice m the cribriform fascia, by Burns' Hej^s, GimWu s ligaments, contraction of the neck of the sac, or by bri dies of lymph crossing the cavity. In the reduction of a fully formed femoral hernia, it will first be necessary to relL the abdominal walls, also by flexion and inver- sion of the thicrh to relax Poupart's ligament by acting the itc portion of the fascia lata; the tumo-^^^^^^^^ then be drawn downwards, then pressed backwards, fnd finally forced upwards backwards, and outw^^^^^ the direction of the crural canal. In the operation tor SLgulated femoral hernia, after the sac - opened and the finger introduced to the stricture, it sl^ould be di vided upwards and inwards, many authorities conceiv-441 glutj;al region. ing it sufficient to divide Hey's ligament where it dips backwards to join the base of Gimbernaut's. In this stage of the operation the obturator artery may be wounded, when arising from the internal epigastric, instead of its usual origin from the internal iliac, in which case it usually passes internal and anterior to the neck of the sac, but even with this anomalous origin it may pass be- hind the neck, and thus be removed from all danger (see Anatomy of the Arteries). This form of hernia is more frequent in the female: first, because the crural arch is wider, because the fasciee are weaker, and the muscles which naturally occupy the space are smaller than in the male. The abdominal rings are also smaller in the female, obviating the tendency to inguinal protrusion. GLUTJEAL REGION. In order to examine this region, place a block beneath the pelvis, to make the parts tense; carry an incision round the crest of the ilium from the posterior spinous process "downwards on the side of the sacrum to the coccyx, and then let it be continued obliquely down- wards and outwards to the junction of the upper and middle thirds of the femur. The skin is thick and dense in this region, particularly over the tuber ischii, and is supported by a fatty subcutaneous areolar tissue, usu- ally described as the superficial fascia; anteriorly and superiorly it partakes somewhat of the characters of that structure; but inferiorly, where it forms the fold of the buttock, the fatty granules constitute a thick elastic mass, being supported by dense bands of areolo-fibrotis struc- ture, which preclude displacement of the adipose tissue during the sitting posture. In this layer on the buttock several cutaneous nerves are exposed; most anteriorly a branch being sent back from the musculo-cutaneous, a branch of the lumbar plexus, arising from that nerve, half- an-inch below the anteriorspine of the ilium, and running backwards over the sheath of the tensor vaginse to be lost in the skin; more posteriorly, the external branch of the last dorsal nerve, having pierced the transversalis, internal and external oblique muscles, turns over the crest of the ilium, and also terminates in the integu- u 3442 THE MUSCULAR SYSTEM. ment; still further backwards the iliac branch of the ilio-scrotal pierces the external oblique, crosses the crest of the ilium, and bending downwards, supplies the skin ; still nearer the sacrum some cutaneous filaments are vi- sible, derived from the lumbar nerves, and inferiorly a cutaneous flat filament from the lesser sciatic winds round the lower edge of the glutaeus maximus, and is lost about the centre of the region; this is the last cu- taneous nerve found in this situation. A peculiar ab- sorption of the fat of the buttock occurs in morbus coxa, producing flattening; while the numerous cutaneous nerves account for the exquisite sensibility manifested in those hysterical aff'ections simulating hip-jomt disease. GLUTiEAL Fascia On removing the fat, the proper fascia is exposed, strong before, weak posteriorly; it passes from the tensor vagina? over the glutasus medius, where it is tense, and, arriving at the anterior margin of the glutgeus maximus, it splits, one layer passing superficial, the other deeper than that muscle; the su- perficial is attached to the crest of the lUum and to the spines of the sacrum; the deep, weaker, passes be- neath the muscle, adhering to the glutseus medius and capsular muscles, attached behind to the greatsciatic liga- ment, covering and adhering to the gluteal vessels, on which it sends tubules, so confounding them with the surrounding parts that they are with difiiculty isolated Raise the fascia in a line from the sacrum to the great trochanter, and thus expose the— GLUTiEUS Maximus.—Somewhat square, placed on the buttock and superior fifth of the thigh; it arises from a triangular surface on the posterior fifth ot the crest of the ilium, from a depression below it, from the side and back of the fifth piece of the sacrum, also from the coccyx, from the sheath of the erector spins, pos- terior sacro-iliac ligament, and great sacro-sciatic liga- ment; the fibres pass obliquely downwards, outwards, and forwards, become attached to a broad aponeurotic expansion, by which it is inserted into the ias^ia la a and into the line leading from the great trochanter to the linea aspera, between the vastus externus and the ad- ductor magnus, and likewise into the upper third of that Une, above the origin of the short head ot the biceps.GLUTEAL REGION. 443 Relations.—It is covered superficially by the skin, fat, and fascia, and lies on the parts which are seen when it is raised; in structure it resembles the deltoid, being coarse and fasciculated on the surface; the supe- rior two-thirds of the fibres are connected to the bone, but the inferior are attached to the fascia, over the vastus externus. Of the four margins one is connected to the sa- crum ; a second anteriorly overlaps the gluteus medius; and a third, thick and round, forms inferiorly the fold of the nates; the fourth being aponeurotic and attached to the femur. This muscle is atrophied in morbus coxEe. Action.—To extend the thigh, and preserve the erect position of the body; it is, therefore, much better de- veloped in man than in the lower animals; it also sup- ports the posterior surface of the articulation. Now cut across this muscle and reflect it; remove the thin layer of fascia from the parts beneath, and the following will be brought into view, viz.:—glutseus me- dius, its anterior fourth, still covered by a strong fascia; at its lower margin the glutseal artery, superior glu- taeal nerve, with the vein of the same name, separate it from the pyriformis, as it runs outwards, emerg- ing from the great sciatic notch; below the pyriformis, the sciatic and pudic arteries and veins, the pudic, great and lesser sciatic nerves, and the inferior gluteal when arising from the sacral plexus, and not from the lesser sciatic; then superior gemellus, beneath it the tendon of the obturator internus, inferior gemellus, tendon of obturator externus, covered by the quadra- tus femoris; then the latter muscle, and beneath it the transverse fibres of the adductor magnus, these being separated by the terminal branch of the circumflex artery of the profunda; and when the thigh is inverted by the lesser trochanter, and the insertion of the psoas and iliacus muscles; the great sciatic ligament is also exposed, the tuber ischii and the origins of the ham- string muscles, the great trochanter, and the bursa which covers that point of bone. This bursa is large and multilocular, one surface adhering to the bone, the second to the deep aspect of the muscle; a second bursa, smaller than the last, is often found between the tuber ischii and the muscle; and a third between its tendonTHE MUSCULAR SYSTEM. 444 and the vastus externus. In one instance the three bursal sacs farmed a continuous chain, a free commu- nication existing between them, but the rule is that each should be distinct. We have also seen a bursa in three cases between the tendon of the muscle where it commences, and the superficial fascia. GLUTiEUS Medius. —Triangular, thick, and fleshy above, tendinous and narrow below; it arises from the superior curved line on the dorsum of the ilium, from the surface above, and below that line, from the three anterior fourths of the crest of the ilium, anterior superior spine, notch below, and from the strong fascia which covers its anterior fourth, and frequently ten- dinous from the anterior point of the inferior curved line; the anterior fibres pass downwards and backwards, the posterior downwards and forwards, the middle ver- tically, and are inserted by a fan-shaped tendon, which is formed in the muscle, into an oblique facette on the external side of the great trochanter, and into a tuber- cle at the anterior part of that facette. Relations.—It is covered by the gluteus maximus, tensor vaginge femoris, and in front only by the fascia; also by the superficial branches of the glutseal artery, and a thin fibrous layer; it lies on the glutaeus mini- mus and the deep branches of the gluteal artery and nerve on the ilium and trochanter, from the latter ot which it is separated by a bursa. _ Adioii —The anterior fibres flex and rotate inwards; the posterior extend and rotate outwards, the anterior being much the more powerful; the whole muscle will abduct the limb, and strengthen the capsular ligament ^^GlumJ's Minimus is seen by reflecting the last mus- cle to which its shape is similar, but it is much smaller; it arises from the inferior curved line on the dorsum of the ilium, and from the capsular ligament of the hip- ioint; the anterior fibres pass downwards and back- ward , the posterior obliquely forwards the middle vertically, and are attached to a fan-shaped tendon, by which it^is inserted into the upper and anterior part Tf the great trochanter, the bone being usually marked by a facette, which is transverse.445 EXTERNAL ROTATORS. Relations.—li lies on the bone, external tendon of the rectus femoris, and capsular ligament of the joint, some adipose areolar tissue intervening, and it is co- vered by the gluteeus medius, with which it is united anteriorly; also by the deep branch of the glutgeal artery and superior glutaeal nerve; the tendon is united with that of the pyriformis. J.rttbra.—Similar to the last, but that it abducts more forcibly, and draws the synovial membrane out of the angle in this motion (see Glutjeal Artery, in the Ana- tomy of the Vessels, also the Glutgeal Nerve, a branch derived from the lumbar plexus). Pyriformis.—Triangular or conoid, partly within and without the pelvis, wide and fleshy at its origin, nar- row and tendinous at its insertion; it arises by fleshy slips from the second, third, and fourth bones of the sacrum, between the gutters of the anterior sacral fora- mina; at first flat and fleshy, it passes outwards, and during its passage through the sciatic notch, arises from Its upper margin, and also from the sciatic liga- ment; the fibres external to the pelvis converge and terminate in a tendon, which passes downwards, out- wards, and forwards, and is inserted into the inner side of the great trochanter, above the digital fossa, and below the gluteus minimus, blended with the tendon of the last muscle. i^etoorw. —Anteriorly it is covered by the sacral plexus, hypogastric vessels, pudic and sciatic arteries and the rectum on the left side; outside the pelvis the anterior surface corresponds to the bone and a part of the capsular ligament; the posterior surface within the pelvis lies on the bone, and, external to that cavity is covered by the gluteus maximus and descending branches of the glut£eal artery; above, it corresponds to the glutseus minimus and glutseal nerves and vessels and below with the superior gemellus, from which it IS separated by the great and lesser sciatic and pudic nerves, also the pudic and sciatic arteries. It is occa- sionally split by the sciatic nerve, which emerges be- tween its fibres; sometimes also there is a mutual in- terweaving of their structures. Action.~'Yo rotate the thigh outwards, abduct and446 THE MUSCULAR SYSTEM. Strengthen the posterior part of the capsular ligament. When this muscle does not accurately fill the superior part of the notch, it predisposes to sciatic hernia, oc- curring between its upper edge and the glutaeus mini- mus; Ind when a dislocation of the thigh-bone occurs, into the sciatic notch, the head of the femur lies on this muscle, below the gluteus medius and covered by the glutseus maximus. The student should now recur to the description of the pudic and sciatic arteries, and also to the external branches of the sacral plexus. Superior Gemellus.-A round muscular band; it arises from the external surface of the spine of the ischium, passes transversely outwards, and is m^^erted into the digital fossa of the great trochanter, below the pyriformisfand above the tendon of the obturator in- ternus, with which it is intimately connected.

Relations.—Within the pelvis it lies on the bone and obturator ligament, the obturator fascia separating its deep surface from the levator ani and bladder, and also from the obturator nerve and vessels which course along its surface; in the notch it is almost surrounded by a bursa, which is large and loose; the pudic artery nerve and vein lie above it, the nerve being nearest to the bone; the internal obturator nerve also enters at this point in its course outwards; it is almost enveloped by the gemelli, having similar relations; and it is particularly adherent to the posterior surface of the capsule. Inferior Gemellus.—Larger than the superior, some- times double, arises from a projecting rough prominence on the tuber ischii, below the lesser sciatic notch; passes horizontally outwards, and is inserted into the digital fossa below the obturator internus. Eelatiom.—By its deep surface to the bone, capsular ligament, and obturator bursa; superficially to the glutseus maximus and greater and lesser sciatic nerves; the former nerve should be drawn over the tuber ischii during the examination of these muscles; above to the obturator internus; and below at its origin to the qua- dratus femoris, and near its insertion to the obturator externus. Action—With the gemelli it strengthens the capsule posteriorly, rotates outwards, and abducts. QuADRATus Femoris—Situated below the last, and is oblong in shape; it arises from the external edge of the tuber ischii, external and anterior to the semimem- branosus ; passes horizontally outwards, and is inserted into the posterior intertrochanteric line. Relations.—Posteriorly it is covered by the glutseus maximus, great sciatic nerve, and branches of the sciatic and glutaeal arteries; anteriorly it lies on the bone, ob- turator externus, lesser trochanter, and insertion of the psoas and iliac muscles; the upper margin is parallel to the inferior gemellus, the lower to the adductor mag- nus, from which it is separated by the terminal branch448 THE MUSCULAR SYSTEM. of the internal circumflex artery. We have sometimes found it absent, and in a few cases taking a much more extensive origin, so-as even to extend to the ascending ramus of the ischium, and in such cases it is twisted above the margin of the adductor magnus. Obturator Externus is seen by cutting across the last muscle, but it is only partially exposed, and should be examined again with the anterior region ot tde thigh: it arises fleshy from the inferior surface ot the circumference of the obturator foramen, from the obtu- rator ligament, and also from a strong fascia which completes the canal for the obturator vessels above; this origin is broad and expanded, whilst the insertion is narrow! the superior fibres pass obliquely downwards, forwards, and outwards, the middle horizontally; the in- ferior ascend a little outwards; they terminate on the surface of a strong tendon, which ascends backwards in a groove between the lower lip of the acetabulum and the tuber ischii, this groove being lined by a process of the capsular ligament and a synovial bursa; wmding now round the neck of the femur, and passmg upwards forwards, and outwards, it is inserted into the lowest part of the digital fossa of the great trochanter. ^ Relations JAnteMy it is covered by the pectmeus a strong fibrous arch, and the obturator nerve and artery; its lower edge is separated from the upper mar- gin of the adductor brevis by the internal circumflex artery; the deep surface rests on the bone and obtura- tor ligament; whilst in the groove it lies inferior and internal to the capsular ligament, then interior and pos- terior, and lastly, posterior to the neck oi the bone Son.-To rotate outwards, and to strengthen the capsular ligament interiorly and internally; likewise to aSTn adduction; during states of extreme abduction the tendon of this muscle is put on the stretch, afFord- ng powerful obstacle to dislocation into the obtura foremen, which usually takes place when ^he hnib^ arc widelv apart In a case of advanced rheumatic arthritis Tf the^Tioint we observed the tendon converted into bone and tie whole muscle degenerated in o a liga- mentous structure.

ANTERIOR REGION OF THE THIGH. Let the thigh be supported on a block, the anterior surface directed forwards, and prolong the incision pre- viously made in the examination of femoral hernia, downwards and inwards, to two inches below the in- ternal condyle of the tibia; reflect the flaps of skin, and the superficial fascia is exposed; internally this is thick, but not so dense as on the external side; the in- ternal saphenous vein is seen internally, and also the in- ternal posterior cutaneous branch joining it; several cuta- neous nerves are also observed; the external cutaneous, a branch of the musculo-cutaneous, and the middle cu- taneous, a branch of the anterior crural, pierce the sar- torius and fascia lata three inches below Poupart's liga- ment; the internal cutaneous, also derived from the anterior crural, perforates the fascia and sartorius about two inches inferior to the last, and is sometimes double; lastly, a branch of the internal saphenous pierces the sartorius and fascia, and, curving forwards, one filament forms a plexus on the patella, the other ramifies on the inner side of the knee-joint and the internal and ante- rior surface of the leg. The crural branch of the geni- to-crural and short saphenous nerves have been already described; but in addition to these, two or three small, slender, and flat branches of the anterior crural pierce the fascia, and accompany the vein in the thigh. Thus on the anterior, external, and internal aspects of the thigh, there are seven cutaneous nerves, five being de- rived from the anterior crural or its branches, and two from branches of the lumbar pi exus. Now remove the superficial fascia, and clean the surface of the fascia lata. Fascia Lata.—Although descriptions of individual parts of the great fibrous investment of the thigh have been already given, still, in conformity with the conve- nience of examination, it will be preferable at present to speak of the whole structure extending from the limit of the thigh above, to the knee-joint inferiorly, as it ex-THE MUSCULAR SYSTEM, 450 ists in its integrity as a sheath to preserve the position of the muscles, and to control their movements, but without subjecting them to any injurious pressure. Superiorly it is attached to Poupart's ligament, crest of the ilium, tubercles on the back of the sacrum, ascend- ing ramus of the ischium, and descending ramus and symphisis of the pubis; inferiorly and anteriorly to the patella, the involucrum of the knee-joint, which it assists in forming; and posteriorly it passes over the popliteal space, adhering to those tendons which form its lateral boundaries, to become continuous with the fascia of the leg- externally it sends a process between the vastus externus in front, and the glutseus maximus, and short head of the biceps behind, constituting the external in- termuscular septum, which is attached to the outer side of the linea aspera from the great trochanter to the external condyle; immediately above the latter it is thick and round, and can be traced downwards, cover- ing and adhering to the external lateral hgament of the knee-ioint; this septum is strong, but weaker above than below in the former situation; it is pierced by the posterior branches of the external circumflex, and m the latter by the superior external articular artery; a similar process is sent in on the internal side between the vastus internus anteriorly, and the adductors pos- teriorly, attached from the root of the lesser trochanter to the internal condyle; like the former, it is strong be- low where it becomes thick, round, and incorporated with the tendon of the adductor magnus, becoming con- tinuous with the internal lateral ligament of the knee- ioint; this is pierced above by the internal circumflex, next in order by the first and second perforating, then by the profunda femoris, the third and fourth perfora- ting the femoral artery and vein, and lastly, by the Snal superior articular. A thin sheet also sinks deep to separate the adductors from the Pos^ior layer ot muscles; thus there are three S^-'eaJ sheaths one ante- rior, the second posterior, and the third ^'^^^'if j^^ dividing the muscles into anterior, "^^-f' ^^^f^f;, rior sets- with very few exceptions each muscle has iTeJfse its special sLath derived ^^^^^^^^^^ we prefer to describe these with each distinct muscleMUSCLES OF THE THIGH. 451 rather than enumerate them individually, which could only be done' in the present stage of the dissection. The fascia lata consists of fibres passing in three different directions, the superficial transversely, the deeper lon- gitudinally, and an intermediate set of decussating, lying between the two former; the difference in direction of the fibres observed in certain situations arising not from any particular change, but from the greater deve- lopment of one set obscuring others. Now remove the fascia and examine the muscles, which on this region are,—tensor vagina femoris, sartorius, vastus externus, vastus internus, rectus femoris, crureus, and sub-cru- reus. Tensor Vaginae occupies the upper and outer side of the thigh; is somewhat quadrilateral in shape, and arise tendinous from the outer side of the anterior su- perior spinous process of the ilium, and from the crest above that point, between the glutaeus medius and the iliacus internus; it passes downwards and backwards, terminating in a broad expansion anteriorly, and a num- ber of tendinous slips posteriorly, by which it is in- serted into a sheath of the fascia lata, about the superior fourth of the thigh, below and behind the great tro- chanter. Relations.—Externally it is covered by the stronger layer of fascia, which here appears tendinous; internally it corresponds to the deep layer of fascia, beneath which lie the rectus, vastus externus, and ascending branches of the external circumflex artery; also to the glutseus medius; the posterior edge lies on the glutseus medius, a deep branch of the glutagal artery, passing downwards to anastomose with the circumflex, separating them; the anterior edge corresponds above to the sartorius, but somewhat lower a triangular space intervenes, contain- ing the rectus, branches of the anterior musculo-cuta- neous nerve, with inferior ramusculi of the external circumflex artery; while the terminal branch of the superior gluta?al nerve is in its sheath. Action—To make tense the fascia, and prevent dis- placement of the vastus externus during its contraction; to flex the thigh and extend the leg by acting on the fascia lata; also to rotate the thigh inwards, in which452 THE MUSCULAR SYSTEM, action it is associated with the glutaeus medius and mi- nimus by the superior glutaeal nerve, Sartorius.—Long and prismatic; it occupies the ex- ternal, anterior, and inner sides of the thigh, and the superior part of the leg; it arises from the anterior su- perior spine of the ilium, and from the upper part of a notch below that process by a flat tendon, more marked posteriorly than anteriorly; it becomes fleshy almost immediately, and passes at first downwards and inwards, then vertically downwards on the internal side of the thigh, courses behind the internal condyle of the femur, then, becoming tendinous, it curves forwards oyer the internal condyle of the tibia, the tendon expanding be- low the inner side of the knee-joint, and is inserted into the internal and anterior side of the tibia, below the condyle, and above the gracilis and semitendinosus. Belations.—This is the most superficial muscle of the thigh, and the longest in the body, consequently its deep relations are numerous; it is immediately beneath the fascia, and crosses the psoas, iliacus, and rectus muscles, the femoral artery, vein, and internal saphenous nerve, the vastus internus, adductors longus, magnus, and gra- cilis, the internal lateral ligament of the knee-jomt, and the tibia in its upper third; the inner edge forms the outer boundary of Scarpa's angle, and it, therefore, serves as a guide to the femoral artery in this region; in the middle third it lies on a strong fascia which con- stitutes the anterior wall of Hunter's canal, but always inclining to the internal portion; and in the operation of securing the artery in this region it is a disputed point as to whether it should be drawn outwards, in- wards, or divided; from the figure of the surface and the connexions of the muscle there is not a doubt,—and of this we have satisfied ourselves frequently,—but that it can be drawn inwards with far greater facility than in the opposite direction; inferior to this the muscle lies between the gracilis and vastus internus, the saphena vein and nerve lying at its posterior margin; as the tendon curves forwards it is concave upwards and tor- wards, and convex downwards and backwards; from the former a thin layer is continued over the synovial membrane of the knee-joint as far as the patella; from453 MUSCLES OF THE THIGH. the latter a strong process passes downwards over the inner edge of the gastrocnemius, to become continuous with the fascia of the leg; its tendon is separated from the gracilis, above by the internal saphena vein and nerve, and below by a bursa; with the tendons of the gracilis and semitendinosus it forms that peculiar arrangement known as the goose's foot. Three nerves pierce the sar- torius,—the middle and internal cutaneous, and the re- flected cutaneous branch of the internal saphenous, that passes to the skin over the knee-joint; in its entire extent it is enclosed in a separate sheath of the fascia lata, which is remarkable for its prismatic form; and in structure it is peculiar in possessing but a small amount of tendinous tissue, and its fibres run the whole length of the muscle without any interruption. Action—To flex the leg on the thigh, and to cross the limbs; also to flex the thigh on the pelvis, and if the leg is fixed, to rotate the pelvis to the opposite side. Bectus Femoris lies on the anterior and external part of the thigh, extending from the ilium to the pa- tella; it arises by a thick round tendon, which grasps the anterior inferior spine of the ilium, this origin being anterior and internal; the external and posterior, flat, thin, and curved, arises from the upper and outer lip of the acetabulum, which sometimes presents a groove for its reception; it passes downwards, forwards, and in- wards, adhering to the capsular ligament of the hip- joint; the tendons then unite, and form at first a thick, round cord, that then expands, continuing on the upper third of the anterior surface of the muscle, also sendino- a slip downwards through its entire extent, as the cen- tral tendon of origin; the fleshy fibres arising from the posterior surface and sides pass downwards and out- wards, as applied to the mesian line of the muscle; and at the inferior third they become attached to the ante- rior surface of a tendinous expansion that contracts as it descends, and is inserted into the base of the patella, sending fibres on the surface of that bone to become con- tinuous with the ligamentum patellae, through which the muscle is inserted into the tubercle of the tibia. The direction of the entire muscle is downwards and in- wards in the axis of the femur; but the patellar liga-454 THE MUSCULAE SYSTEM. ment is not in the same direction, passing downwards and outwards. Relations and Structure.—is a bipenniforni mus- cle the fibres diverging from a central tendon; the ten- don of origin is prolonged on the anterior surface to ia- cilitate the movements of the sartorius, whilst that ot insertion commences on the posterior surface to allow a similar gliding on the subjacent crureus. The external tendon lies on the bone and capsular ligament of the hip- ioint, and is covered by the glutaius minimus, medius, and tensor vaginae muscles. We have seen this tendon absent in advanced cases of rheumatic arthritis; the in- ternal tendon lies between the external and the iliacus, which overlaps it, and the remainder of the united ten- don lies on the great trochanter and vasti, covered by the sartorius; the external branches of the external cir- cumflex artery separate the deep surface from the crureus above, and below descending branches of the same artery are found between these muscles; in its in- ferior three-fourths it is only covered by the fascia lata. The fibres of this muscle are not above two inches in lencrth, so that contracting one-third of the length ot each they will only draw up the patella to such an ex- tent'as to cause extension of the leg, but in consequence of the bipenniform arrangement, the fibres are multi- plied as to number, greatly augmenting the power of ?he muscle. In some rare instances the tendon may be ruptured above the patella, but in the majority that bone or its ligament yields before the tendon. A trans- verse section of the rectus exhibits the^orifaces of nu- merous branches of the external circumflex, and proves the large vascular supply of the muscle Vastus ExTEENUS—Flat and expanded; lies on the outer side of the thigh; it is tendinous superiorly and ex nally, also mfenorly and internally, and larger above than below; it arises fleshy from the anterior part of the base of the great trochanter, which frequently exhibits a cres at this point, from the outer lip of the hne lead- tnrr from the great trochanter to the linea aspera, also rom t7e ute'r side of that line, from the lemur, rom the external intermuscular septum and fascia lata; finally from the external condyloid line, external to the455 MUSCLES OF THE THIGH, short head of the biceps; the su perior fibres pass obliquely downwards, forwards, and inwards; the inferior, with less obliquity, forwards, and are attached to a flat apo- neurotic tendon, which, descending, is inserted into the outer edge of the tendon of the rectus, upper and outer margin of the patella, and then sends an expansion over the synovial membrane of the knee-joint, to be attached to the head of the tibia. Eelations.—The anterior edge corresponds to the cru- reus, rectus, and patella, with its ligament; the poste- rior margin to the bone in front of the glutteus maxi- mus, and short head of the biceps; the internal surface to the femur, circular branches of the external circum- flex, which also separate it from the crureus; also to the synovial membrane gf the joint; it is covered externally by the fascia lata and the aponeurotic insertion of the glutasus maximus. Vastus Internus.—Similar to the last, lying on the internal side of the thigh; it arises from a ridge at the termination of the intertrochanteric line (anterior), above the lesser trochanter, from the line leading to the linea aspera, from its inner lip, and internal condyloid line; the fibres pass obliquely downwards, forwards, and outwards, form a tendon on the deep surface, not so well marked as in the external vastus, and is inserted into the internal side of the rectus tendon, upper and inner part of the base of the patella, and by an expansion into the head of the tibia. ^etowns.—Internally and anteriorly with the psoas and iliacus, sartorius, adductors, and femoral artery and vein; also with the profunda; the anterior edge overlaps the crureus, from which it can hardly be separated; the posterior margin is tendinous, and united with the ad- ductors, being covered by the internal hamstring mus- cles; by its deep surface it corresponds to the bone, crureus, and synovial membrane of the knee-joint. Crureus lies on the anterior and external surface of the femur; it arises fleshy from the root of the anterior intertrochanteric line, and Irom the anterior and exter- nal side of the bone, as far back as the linea aspera; the fibres pass downwards and forwards, and are inserted into the posterior part of the rectus tendon, upper edge456 THE MUSCULAR SYSTEM. of the patella, and into the synovial membrane of the knee-joint. n n i, v SuBCRUREUS—Beneath the last; a smaU, fleshy slip; arises from the anterior surface of the inferior faith ot the femur, also from the vastus internus; passes down- wards and forwards, and is attached to the synovial membrane of the joint, which it draws out from beneath the patella during extension. j ^- j Relations.—It is covered by the rectus and vasti, and lies on the bone and synovial membrane. Action —These muscles, when taken conjointly, are named quadriceps extensor cruris; the rectus flexes the thigh on the pelvis, and extends the leg on the thigh; the vasti and crureus only extend the leg, having no attach- ment to the pelvis; it will be observed how the uniform expansion of these muscles tends to increase the secu- rity of the knee-joint, and avert the many injuries to which the articulation is liable, both on account of its exposed situation, as well as the extensive surface it presents. Over the patella a large bursa exists, and between the fascia and quadriceps a second, correspond- ing to the ligament that connects that bone to the tibia, these two synovial sacs communicate; a third is some- times found over the base of the tubercle of the tibia, also communicating with those above, nor it extra ordinary that such communications should occur when it is recollected that these sacs are only n^od^fied foim of areolar tissue. The rectus has a proper sheath but the vasti and crureus are contained in a common invest- ment. INTERNAL REGION OF THE THIGH. There are five muscles in this region,—gracilis, pecti- npus and the three adductors. ^ G^ACTUS-Long and flat, like a band, situated o^^^^^^ inner side of the thigh; it arises by an oblong tendon Zm the symphisis pubis, between the spme and the ascSiding ramus of the ischium; the muscle then be- c mes flfshy, with P-allel fibres, aiid cours^^^^ wards on the inner side of the ^l"Sj' "^J,^''^"^^^^ ferior fourth terminates in a round tendon that passesMUSCLES OF THE THIGH. 457 behind the internal condyle of the femur, and then ex- panding, curves forwards to be inserted into the inter- nal and anterior part of the tibia, inferior and posterior to the sartorius. Relations.—It lies on the adductors, longus, brevis, and magnus, on the internal lateral ligament of the knee-joint, from which it is separated by a bursa, and lastly, on the tibia, a prolongation being sent off from each margin, above to cover the synovial membrane, and below to the fascia of the leg; it is covered by the fascia lata, the crus penis above, and below by the sartorius; the internal saphenous vein crosses its anterior edge. The deep surface receives a branch from the obturator nerve. Pectineus.—Triangular in shape; base above—apex below; it arises from the linea ileo-pectinea, between the ilio-pubal eminence and the spine of that bone, also from the surface below that line and from the pubic fascia, which covers it; the fibres pass downwards, back- wards, and outwards, converging, and are inserted by a tendon into the line leading from the lesser trochanter to the linea aspera, below the iliacus internus and above the adductor brevis. Relations.—It is covered by the pubic portion of the fascia lata and femoral vein at the pubic attachment, and near the insertion by the femoral and profunda vessels; the inner edge corresponds to the adductor longus, from which it is separated by some distance, inferiorly the adductor brevis intervening, and occasionally the first perforating artery; externally to the psoas, iliacus, cap- sular ligament, and vastus internus, and it lies on the bone, obturator externus, obturator nerve and artery, and a variable portion of the adductor brevis. When the limb is rotated inwards, the tendon of this muscle appears twisted, but this disappears during the opposite motion. The fibres are weak and fine, with but a small amount of areolar tissue in their intervals; the sheath is also thin and weak, and it is not unusual to observe It torn completely across in many subjects. Action—To flex, adduct, and rotate the thigh out- wards. Adductor LoNGus.^This muscle is the most super- ficial of the three of that name, and is triangular in XTHE MUSCULAR SYSTEM. 458 shape, the base at the femur; it arises by a narrow ten- don from the anterior surface of the symphysis pubis, inferior and internal to the spine, and forms a thick, fleshy belly, increasing in width as it passes downwards, backwards, and outwards; it then ends in a broad ten- don, which sheaths the termination of the fleshy fibres, and is inserted into the middle third of thelinea aspera, between the vastus internus in front, and the adductor magnus behind, with which it is intimately united to constitute the conjoined tendons. ^ Relations.—In the upper three-fourths it is merely subfascial; inferiorly the sartorius crosses it, separated from it by the femoral vein and artery; it lies on the adductor brevis, anterior division of the obturator nerve, and at its insertion on the adductor magnus, the profunda artery and vein intervening.

Relations.-li is covered by the branches of the ob- turator nerve, adductor longus, and pectmeus, a small triangular portion appearing between them, over which lie the femoral and profunda arteries and their corres- ponding veins; the tendon presents three opemngs for ?he perforating arteries of the profunda; ^^^f^nrl adductor magnus and posterior branches of the obtura tor nerve; the superior edge is separated from the ob turator externus by the internal circumflex artery.

Relations—Posteriorly it is covered by the hamstring muscles and the great sciatic nerve, also by the gluteus maximus above; anteriorly by the obturator externus, posterior division of the obturator nerve, adductor brevis, longus, pectineus, femoral artery, vein, and saphenous nerve; internally it corresponds to the fascia, sartorius, and gracilis; externally, to the bone; while the superior edge corresponds to the quadratus femoris, obturator ex- ternus tendon, and termination of the internal circumflex of the profunda; the superior fibres are often separated by large intervals, and are thick and strong, and the internal and external portions are separated by the femoral artery, vein, and saphenous nerve. Near the femoral linear attachments four apertures exist, for the passage of the perforating arteries, andinferiorly alarge tendinous opening for the femoral vessels. Action.—To adduct the thigh, and flex it. The Hamstring Muscles are three in number, biceps flexor cruris, semitendinosus, and semimembra- nosus, and are seen by turning the thigh on its anterior surface. Biceps Flexor Cruris consists of two heads, a long and short; the former arises by a strong tendon from the superior and external part of the tuber ischii, from Avhich it is separated by a bursa; this tendon passes downwards, becoming thicker, connected internally to the tendon of the semitendinosus, and giving origin to the fleshy fibres of the muscle by its posterior surface; it then forms a fusiform belly, that descends outwards and a little forwards; two inches above the flexure of the knee-joint it ends in a broad tendon, which receives the X 2460 THE MUSCULAE SYSTEM. short head, that arises from the linea aspera, below the glutEeus maximus tendon, also from the external mter- musciilar septum; it passes downwards, backwards, and outwards, and joins the common tendon on the ante- rior surface; this tendon then passes downwards, pos- terior and external to the external lateral ligament oi the knee-joint, expands so as to inclose it m its bifur- cation; the anterior portion being inserted into the head of the fibula, the posterior also mto the head of the fibula, external side of the tibia, and fascia oi the le^'' Relations.—It is covered by the glutaeus maximus m its upper third, and fascia lata in the rest of its course; it lies on the semitendinosus and membranosus above, and vastus externus in its entire length, the sciatic nerve being first external, then crossing beneath it, and finally being to its inner side; the peroneal nerve is parallel to its tendon, which also covers the external lateral ligament, and external superior articular artery. Action-To flex the leg, and rotate it outwards when the knee-joint is flexed; also to extend the thigh on the pelvis, and support the erect position. _ ^ SEMiTENDiNOSUS—Long, flat, and slender; arises from the tuber ischii and inner edge of the biceps tendon for two or three inches; it forms a small fleshy belly, which, about four inches above the flexure ot the joint, ends in a long, round, slender tendon, that passes downwards and inwards, runs behind the internal condyle of the fZur, is th;n reflected forwards, and is inserted into th^ internal condyle of the tibia, below and behind the gracilis, with which it is united. ^ -u „ ^ Belatio.is.-lt is intersected about its centre by a tendinous line, like the complexus cervicis, and it iies onte adductor magnus, quadratus f-oris and b^^^^^^^^ nn the tendon of the semimembranosus, which it sepa rates from the inner head of the gastrocnemius, then on the bone, internal lateral ligament of the kne^jomt^ and internal inferior articular artery, and is covered by the gluteeus maximus, biceps, fascia, tendon of sar- '°"-To ^^^^^^^^^ leg and rotate the knee-joint in- wafds; aiso to" support thf pelvis in the erect position.461 MUSCLES OF THE THIGH. Semimembranosus.—Tendinous and aponeurotic above and below, fleshy in the centre, lying beneath the last; it arises by a strong flat tendon, from the upper and outer part of the tuber ischii, deeper than the biceps and semitendinosus; the tendon then expands, becomino- aponeurotic, and on the inner oblique margin the fleshy fibres commence; a thick fleshy belly succeeds, which after a course of about five inches is attached to the outer margin of an aponeurotic tendon, that, contracting and becoming round, passes behind the inner condyle of the femur, and divides into three processes,—the an- terior, a continuation of the original tendon, curves for- wards, passing deeper than the sartorius and gracilis, and is inserted into a horizontal groove on the inner condyle of the femur; the second, a thick, flat lamina, arises from the posterior and external edge of the ten- don, passes upwards and outwards, beneath the semi- tendinosus, gastrocnemius, plantaris, popliteal artery, vein, and nerve, and is inserted into the internal side of the external condyle of the femur, sending a process over the posterior surface of that point to the sheath of the _ popliteus tendon; the third, a thin, but strong fascial layer, comes off from the lower curved edo-e of the tendon, and, descending on the surface of the popliteus muscle, is inserted into the oblique line of that name, becoming continuous with the deep fascia of the leg. Relations—It is covered'above by the glutseus maxi- mus, semitendinosus, and biceps; also by the fascia; it lies on the quadratus femoris, adductor magnus, and overlaps the inner head of the gastrocnemius; lastly on the tibia, a bursa intervening; the great sciatic nerve lies on its outer side, in its whole course. It has been remarked that the fascia is exceedingly strong, as it invests the posterior surface of the tendons of the semi- tendinosus and membranosus, or the two inner ham- strings; it also sends processes deep into the bone, to invest each in its distinct fibrous tubule; on the external side the outer hamstring or biceps tendon is similarly retamed by a fascial sheath; between the outer and inner hamstrings inferiorly, the upper half of the popli- teal space is situated, but superiorly they are merely462 THE MUSCULAR SYSTEM. separated by a cellular interval, througli which a direct continuity of areolar tissue is established from tbe pelvis to the popliteal region. The student should refer to the popliteal artery and sacral plexus for the further anatomy of this region. DEEP ABDOMINAL MUSCLES. These consist of five pair, considering the diaphragm to be composed of symmetrical halves, viz.: diaphragm psoas magnus &nd parvus, quadratus lumborum, and iliacus internus. . , DiAPHRAGM._In order to expose this muscular sep- tum, the liver, kidneys, spleen, stomach, and duodenum should be removed; the peritoneum should then be cautiously detached from the fleshy portion, but great difficulty will occur in the attempt to remove it tiom the central tendon; a different subject, in which ^le abdomen has not been opened, will give the most faith- ful view of the natural condition of the thoracic surface, and in order to expose it, the lungs and pericardium toc^ether with the pleural membrane, should be removed In^the adult the Pinion of the fibrous Pej^^^j^'^^-^^ ^ intimate that it is impossible to separate them, but n the f^tus such a separation can be accomplished^^^^^^^^ facility.

The tendon is narrow and thin, and the margins in the whole cir- cumference are identified with the lateral, anterior, and posterior fleshy fibres; the superior or thoracic surface is smooth, the inferior fasciculated, the principal fibres radiating from behind; and in addition to these there are other bands interwoven, crossing the former at acute angles; on the inferior surface, particularly on the right side, a number of superadded fasciculi occur, adhering but slightly to the tendon, which are raised with facility from their position by the handle of a scalpel; from this mutual interlacement it is obvious great strength must accrue; four of these bands circumscribe the caval opening. LlGAMENTUM ArCUATUM FaLSUM Vel ExTERNUJI This is merely the anterior layer of the transversalis abdominis tendon, folded on itself, being attached su- periorly to the lower edge of the last rib, and inter- nally to the transverse process of the first lumbar ver- tebra ; the concave edge looks downwards and inwards, and beneath it passes the last dorsal nerve and quadra- tus lumborum muscle, the anterior surface being covered by the kidney and fatty areolar tissue; and in order to make this fascia or ligament tense, the rib should be everted and drawn backwards. From the attachment of the last to the transverse process of the first lumbar vertebra arises the ligamentum arcuatum internum, which arches downwards, forwards, and inwards, to be inserted into the root of the pedicle of the second lum- bar, between the psoas magnus, and the posterior edge of the crus, the lower edge being prolonged for some distance on the psoas magnus, parvus, and sympathetic nerve, which emerge from beneath it. Inferior False Diaphragm.—This consists of two fleshy pillars or crura; each being triangular, with the base above and apex inferiorly; the right, which is most anterior, arises by a tendinous band from the fore-464 THE MUSCULAK SYSTEM. part of tlie bodies of the four superior lumbar vertebra, also from the intervertebral substance and the anterior vaginal ligament; the left, which is more posterior, arises from the sides of the bodies of the three superior lumbar vertebree and vertebral ligaments; these tendons are united superiorly to form an arch, bounding the aortic opening, and to their posterior, superior, and external edge the fleshy crura are attached; the fibres radiate, and, passing upwards and forwards, are inserted into the notched or posterior edge of the cordiform tendon; from the summit of the arch, and deep surface of the tendon, two fleshy muscular bands arise, the right being most anterior and crossing the left; these are the de- cussating fibres of the crura, which are continued up- wards and forwards, to be inserted into the inferior surface of the central tendon, near the posterior edge; the angle of decussation being immediately behind the oesophageal, and in front of the aortic opening, and therefore separating those orifices. It has been stated that the right fasciculus was anterior at the pomt of decussation, but at the insertion the position is altered, the left being at the right and anterior segment of the oesophageal opening, and the right band at the left and posterior edge. t i. Relative Anatomy.—Th^ openings m the diaphragm are, first, single,—aortic, oesophageal and caval; the sym- metrical are two triangular spaces, behind the ensiiorm cartilage; and two for the splanchnic nerves, —greater and lesser. Let these now be examined in detail. The aortic opening, or, more critically speaking, canal, corresponds to the eleventh and twelfth dorsal and upper margin of the first lumbrar vertebra, is about one inch and a half in length, infundibuliform in shape, large, wide, and fleshy on the thoracic aspect, constricted and tendi- nous on the abdominal, the latter not being defined, the fibrous arch sending a prolongation downwards on the aorta and ca^liac axis; the canal is bounded anteri- orly by the aortic arch and decussating fasciculi, posteri- orly by the bodies of the vertebrae, anterior common liga- ment of the spine, and also by the origins of the left crus; and laterally by the crura. The aorta passes through its centre, having, on the right side, vena azygos and tho-MUSCLES OF THE ABDOMEN. 465 racic duct, and on the left, vena azygos minor; the ten- dinous arrangement of the outlet of the canal averts injurious compression of the vessel, and the size of the canal superiorly obviates a similar consequence. Caval Opening.—To examine it effectually, the liver should be removed; its shape is quadrilateral, bounded on the abdominal aspect by four tendinous fascictili, and on the thoracic surface the figure is somewhat oval; as the vessel passes through this fibrous ring, the anterior edge is prolonged on the abdominal surface as far as the liver, where it becomes continuous with the capsule of Glisson; the posterior margin passes upwards on the thoracic portion as far as the right auricle, whilst the lateral margins ascend for some distance on the vein, and then terminate abruptly. This opening is on a level with the tenth dorsal vertebra, formed in the structure where the middle and the right leaves of the central ten- don unite, and through it pass the vena cava inferior, and a few filaments of the phrenic nerve. In many diving animals the caval opening is perfectly muscular, such being the structure in the otter, but although it presents all the characters of a sphincter, there is this peculiarity,—that an aponeurotic expansion is prolonged from the muscular opening, which invests the intraperi- cardial portion of the inferior cava; and in such in- stances the latter vessel, together with the hepatic veins, exhibit a normal dilatation within the abdomen. This dilatation does not appear to be, however, dependent on the muscularity of the orifice; as it equally exists ill the bird tribe with aquatic habits, as the northern diver, although the diaphragm is merely rudimentary. (Esophageal Opening.—Situated on a level with the ninth dorsal vertebra, elliptical in shape, and placed behind the left leaf of the central tendon, ante- rior and to the left side of the aortic opening. Its structure is muscular, formed by the decussating fasci- culi of the crura; but sometimes the anterior edge is tendinous, and occasionally a thin slip passes on the surface of the oesophagus downwards to the stomach: through it pass the oesophagus, pneumogastric nerves, and the ascending branch of the coronaria ventriculi artery. Occasionally we have seen this opening fully466 THE MUSCULAR SYSTEM. laalf-an-incli larger than the tube; this is a condition calculated to promote the occurrence of diaphragmatic hernia, and *of course a portion of the stomach would form the contents of the sac. We have also seen the oesophagus presenting a circular indentation from the margins of the opening impressing it. This was pre- sent in a case of constant vomiting, caused by a carci- nomatous affection of the stomach, the coats of the tube being thickened, but without dilatation. CosTO-xiPHOiD Space.—The diaphragm is attached to the posterior surface of the ensiform cartilage, at its base by a flat band, separated by an indistmct cellular line into two, sometimes this line being absent. Be- tween this band, on each side, and the first costal origin, there exists a triangular opening; but when the central slip is absent, which is sometimes the case, but one aperture only occurs. Through either passes the ab- dominal branch of the internal mammary artery, the areolar tissue of the two cavities communicatmg, and in the case of central deficiency, the serous membranes of the thorax and abdomen coming m contact; and through the right also passes the anterior superficial absorbents of the liver, in their course to reach the elands in the anterior mediastinum. _ Neural Openings.—These are four m number two on each side; they are more properly slits m the fibres of the crura, the great splanchnic nerve passing through the most anterior, which is occasionally so evident as to present the appearance of dividing the erus into an an- Lior and posterior portion, the lesser sp anchmcs piercing the crura more posteriorly. We have fre- quently seen each costal origin formmg a distinct slip, indieitating with the corresponding origins of the trans- versllis abdominis, or, more correctly speaking, apposed withthatmuscle, amutualinterpositionoffascicuh being 7arelv if ever, observed.

Theoii- 5ns from the eleventh and twelfth ribs are endmous, Sa e not in apposition with the trausversalis, nearly467 MUSCLES OF THE ABDOMEN. three-quarters of an inch intervening between them, the intercostal nerves and arteries escaping between the attachments of the diaphragm and transversalis. The superior surface of the diaphragm is arched, but more so on the right than the left side; anteriorly it is almost horizontal. The highest point of the right half is on a level with the cartilage of the fourth rib, and on the left with the fifth; it is covered by the pleurae, bases of the lungs, pericardium, and heart, while inferiorly it is related to the liver, stomach, kidneys, and supra- renal capsules, spleen, and peritoneum; on the right crus rest the liver, pancreas, suprarenal capsules, kid- ney, semilunar ganglion, right phrenic artery, vena cava, and porta; it is also crossed by the hepatic ar- tery and superior transverse portion of the duodenum, likewise the renal artery: on the left crus lie the spleen, left lateral ligament of the liver, kidney, supra- renal capsule, tail of the pancreas, oesophagus, pneumo- gastric nerves, left phrenic, renal, splenic, superior and mesenteric arteries, semilunar ganglion, and the aorta. Action Haller conceived the diaphragm to rank only second in importance to the heart, as being the principal and indispensable agent in the function of respiration. Although placed within the cavity of the body, and internal to the levers on which it is destined to act, like the motive structures of invertebrate ani- mals, it is by no means an organ extensively present in the animal series, being peculiar to mammalia in its perfect state, a substitute existing in birds, consisting of two fleshy fasciculi, arising from the ensiform carti- lage, and attached to the base of the lungs, the inter- vals on either side being occupied by the upper extre- mities of the air sacs. In mammalia it pertains to the class of mixed muscles, possessing characters equally common to both: thus it is red, attached to bone, equally composed of tendon and muscular structure, supplied by the cerebro-spinal system, is partially under the control of volition, and contains striped fibres,— these being the distinctive characters of voluntary mtiscles. Again, it is contained within a cavity, is thin and expanded, placed between two serous membranes, the fibres, like those of the heart, are feebly striped,468 THE MUSCULAR SYSTEM. and its contractions are rhythmical, continuing during sleep and cerebral lesions that annihilate volition,— these constituting the more important features of the organic system of muscles. As the great inspiratory muscle, it acts both in ordinary and extraordinary in- spirations. In the former, the ribs being fixed by the intercostals, the diaphragm descends, by its contrac- tions becoming a plane instead of a concavo-convex surface, in this movement the crura fixing the cordi- form tendon. In extraordinary inspirations the action is the same, but that it is assisted by the subsidiary muscles. The diaphragm is antagonized directly by the abdominal and levatores ani muscles, which, by pressing the abdominal viscera upwards against its lower surface, cause its relaxation. In its contraction, it assists in expelling the contents of the hollow vis- cera; produces sneezing, the mechanism being a slow inspiration followed by a sudden expiration; it also assists in coughing. The diaphragm is supplied by the phrenic nerves, branches of the cervical plexus and the sympathetic. The vessels distributed to it are_ the phrenic branches of the abdominal aorta, the six infe- rior intercostal, comes nervi phrenici, and musculo- phrenic arteries. Psoas Parvus.—Sometimes wanting; thick, round, and fleshy above; tendinous and expanded inferiorly; it arises by two semicircular tendinous bands from the sides of the bodies of the last dorsal and first lumbar vertebra; to these succeed a short fleshy belly, ending in a tendon which superiorly becomes broad and ex- panded, and is inserted into the linea ileo-pectinea and junction of the pubic and iliac fascia?, on that point be- hind the terminal portion of the external iliac artery. Occasionally the outer edge of the tendon is continued as a falciform edge or process upwards and outwards over the iliacus internus to the anterior superior spine of the ilium. , .1 Relations.—li lies anterior and internal to the psoas magnus, and the anterior surface has similar relations to that muscle. ■, , ^ 1 Action.—lo bend the body forwards; also to make tense the fascia and sheath of the femoral vessels.MUSCLES OF THE ABDOMEN. 469 Psoas Magnus—Narrow above and below, wide in the centre, placed on the sides of the spine, on the brim of the pelvis and on the anterior and inner part of the thigh; it arises by short tendinous fibres from the an- terior surface of the transverse processes of all the lum- bar vertebrse; also from the sides of the bodies of the two last dorsal and four first lumbar by tendinous arches, five in number, the extremities of each being attached to the projecting margin of the vertebras and intervertebral substances; beneath these arches pass the lumbar arteries and veins, with branches of the sym- pathetic nerve; the fibres, forming a thick mass, pass downAvards and outwards over the brim, drooping a little into the cavity of the true pelvis, then pass un- der Poupart's ligament, and form a tendon on its outer side, but continuing fleshy internally; in the thigh it turns at first downwards, backwards, and inwards, af- terwards is reflected a little outwards, and is inserted into the posterior and inferior part of the lesser trochan- ter and the ridge below that point. Relations—Superiorly, or in the abdominal portion, it is covered by the crus of the diaphragm and ligamen- tum arcuatum internum, psoas parvus, kidney, and renal vessels, the ureter, spermatic vessels, iliac fascia, external iliac artery, and genito-crural nerve; poste- riorly it rests on the transverse processes of the verte- brae, quadratus lumborum, from which it is separated by the external branches of the lumbar arteries and the anterior lamina of the transversalis abdominis ten- don; also by a few branches of the lumbar plexus; be- low this on the brim of the pelvis and iliac sulcus. ' The internal edge corresponds to the crus of the diaphragm and sympathetic trunk, and the external to the quadra- tus lumborum, and lower down to the iliacus internus and anterior crural nerve. In the femoral portion it is covered by the sartorius, femoral artery and vein, pro- funda artery and vein, external circumflex, and the an- terior layer of the pubic fascia; and it lies on the cap- sular ligament of the hip-joint, a bursa and the posterior layer of the pubic fascia intervening. Sometimes this bursa communicates with the joint, a deficiency existing- in the capsule, in which case the tendon of the muscle470 THE MUSCULAR SYSTEM. lies in contact with the neck of the femur; at its in- sertion it also has posterior to it the transverse fibres of the adductor magnus. The iliac sulcus exists be- tween the ilio-pubal eminence and the anterior inferior spine of the ilium, and the psoas escapes on its internal third, between the insertion of the psoas parvus and the iliacus, then between the latter and the pectineus, still having the iliacus to its outer side. Within the centre of the^muscle the lumbar plexus is formed. The psoas muscle is often the seat of abscess,—in the majority of cases consequent on caries of the vertebra. The matter in such instances follows the course of the muscle, be- coming evident in the groin, two circumstances pro- moting the descent of the purulent depot,—firstly, the lax areolar tissue, which connects its fibres to each other-, and secondly, the fibrous layers which inclose it, con- stituting the psoas sheath. Above the iliac fossa the anterior surface of the muscle is covered by the conti- nuation of the ligamentum arcuatum verum, and a process derived from the tendons of the crura, which also binds down the sympathetic nerve, whilst posteri- orly the strong anterior lamina of the transversalis ab- dominis tendon presents an obstacle to the escape of the contents in that direction rarely overcome. At the outer edge of the psoas the iliac fascia sends a process posteriorly, where it is also supported by the bone; but the principal portion of the fascia passes on the anterior surface, both becoming again continuous at the inner edge of the muscle. In the thigh the pubic portion Oi fascia lata divides into two laminas of unequal thick- ness, the posterior being weak, as the muscle is sup- ported in this situation by the fibrous capsule ol the ioint; but much stronger anteriorly, where it receives additional strength from the posterior layer of the le- moral sheath. In examining this sheath m the normal state many points exist where its manifest weakness ought to permit these accumulations to escape readily; but when it is recollected that the inflammation pre- cedincr their formation is slow and chronic, it will otter a sufficient explanation of the enormous thickening of the sheath observed in those cases, although every trace of muscular structure may have been removed, either471 MUSCLES OF THE ABDOMEN. by the pressure of the matter, or from inutility of the muscle, or both in combination. Action.—To draw forwards and flex the thigh, also to rotate it outwards; to keep the spine erect, and bend it to one side. QuADRATUS LuMBORUM lies external and posterior to the last, oblong in shape, and stretched between the last rib and the crest of the ilium; it arises by short tendinous fibres from the posterior fourth of the crest of the ilium, and from the ilio-k;mbar ligament; the fibres pass upwards and inwards, the external being in- serted into the lower edge of the last rib for about two inches and a half, the internal passing upwards and in- wards, and are inserted by four tendinous and fleshy slips into the summit of the transverse processes of the four first lumbar vertebrae. Where these terminate three fleshy slips frequently pass upwards and out- wards, superficial to the remainder of the miascle, cross- ing its fibres at acute angles, and are inserted into the last rib. Relations—It is between the anterior and middle layers of the transversalis abdominis tendon, the last dorsal nerve, lumbar arteries, psoas, kidney, crus of the diaphragm, being also anterior to it. The resemblance to the rectus abdominis, in being inclosed in a fibrous sheath, is sometimes still further increased by the pre- sence of a transverse tendinous intersection in its struc- ture. Action—To depress the last rib, also to bend the spine to its own side, and if the spine be fixed, to ele- vate the pelvis. Iltacus Internus is seen by removing the iliac fascia; it is broad and triangular above, narrow inleri- orly, arising from all the iliac fossa, from the three an- terior fourths of the crest of the ilium, from the ante- rior superior and inferior spines, and the notch between them, from the iliac fascia and brim of the acetabulum, and from the last lumbar transverse process; the fibres converge, passing over the iliac sulcus on the brim of the acetabulum, and are inserted into the outer side of the tendon of the psoas, and then continued down to the lesser trochanter, which is embraced by its anterior472 THE MUSCULAR SYSTEM. surface; finally, the muscle is inserted into the line be- low the lesser trochanter, also into the posterior and in- ferior part of that process. Relations.—It is covered by the iliac fascia, cellular tissue and ctecum on the right side, sigmoid flexure of the colon on the left; and is also crossed by the muscu- lo-cutaneous nerve, while it is separated internally from the psoas by the anterior crural. It lies on the bone, ilio-lumbar artery and ligament,—such being the re- lations above Poupart's ligament. The femoral portion is covered by the sartorius, femoral, profunda, and ex- ternal circumflex arteries; and it lies on the capsular ligament and adductor magnus. The lax areolar tissue lying between the caecum and iliac fascia sometinies suppurates, constituting " ilio-csecal abscess;" or, again, an abscess may form within the muscle, and this is considered an " iliac abscess." Action.—To flex the thigh and rotate it outwards, and also advance it forwards, as in progression. ANATOMY OF THE LEG. The integument of the leg is strong and dense ante- riorly and externally, but much finer and more sensi- tive on the inner surface and crest of the tibia. In all the situations enumerated it is fixed to the subjacent structures almost immoveably; posteriorly it is thick, but fine and soft, and very moveable on the dorsum ot the foot and toes, where it is so thin, that the cutane- ous veins are visible, even to the smallest branches, which contrasts remarkably with the similar structure of the sole or plantar region, it being here dense and horny, except internally, where it is fine, polished, and transparent. The surface is generally covered with hair in the adult, predominating on the anterior region be- ing somewhat less posteriorly; few m number, but fine and prolonged, on the dorsum of the foot; and again to- tall/absent on the plantar region. Now et an incision be carried from the knee to the great toe, along the crest of he tibia, and reflecting the skin outwards, the superficial fascia is exposed; this is merely a continua- S of the same tissue from the thigh, sometimes con-473 MUSCLES OF THE LEG. taining fat, but usually laminated and mucli weaker on the dorsum of the foot than on the leg. The following parts also are seen:—Internal saphenous vein and nerve; also the musculo-cutaneous. The internal saphenous vein commences from an arch on the dorsum of the foot, situated over the proximal extremities of the metatar- sal bones, receiving in front cutaneous branches from the toes, and by the internal and external extremity giving origin to the saphenous trunks; the vein then ascends in front of the internal malleolus, and on the in- ner side of the leg over the internal edge of the gastroc- nemius ; then passes between the tendons of the gracilis and sartorius muscles, and commences its femoral stage, lying in its whole extent in the structure of the super- ficial fascia. Internal saphenous nerve, a branch of the anterior crural, accompanies the femoral artery in the thigh, pierces the tendon of the adductor magnus, and, passing beneath the saphena vein, between the tendons before mentioned, it reaches the leg; then winding to the anterior part of the vein, follows its course, and ter- minates on the inner side of the dorsum of the foot. Musculo-cutaneous nerve, a branch of the peroneal, de- scends between the peroneus longus and extensor digi- ' torum communis; below the middle of the leg it be- comes superficial, and divides into internal and external tarsal branches, that are distributed—the external to the three outer toes, and the internal to the two inner (see Anatomy of Nerves). When the superficial fas^ cia is removed, the proper investment of the anterior surface of the leg is exposed, and with this may be de- scribed the whole fascial envelope, as it surrounds the limb, and includes three sheaths,_an anterior, external, and posterior, producing a corresponding arrangement of the muscles; the superior circumference is attached anteriorly to the head of the tibia, fibula, and tendon of biceps; posteriorly being continuous with the fascia lata, and strengthened by expansions from the gracilis, sartorius, semitendinosus, and biceps; the inferior cir- cumference is attached to the annular ligaments; ante- riorly the fascia is strong, the fibres interlacing at acute angles, and attached to the spine of the tibia its whole length; but posteriorly it is much weaker, the direc- '474 THE MUSCULAR SYSTEM. tion of the fibres being circular. Now remove the fas- cia from the anterior region, commencing below, where it can be raised with facility, but above so intimately is it attached to the muscles beneath, that a few fibres are removed with it. The muscles in this region are four in number:—Tibialis anticus, extensor poUicis pro- prius, extensor digitorum communis, and peroneus ter- tius. Tibialis Anticus.—Triangular or prismatic, fleshy above, tendinous below; it arises from the outer side of the head of the tibia, also from the concave sixrface of the bone for the upper two-thirds, from the fascia and intermuscular septum, Avhich separates it from the ex- tensor communis, and the inner half of the interosseous membrane; it passes obliquely downwards, forwards, and inwards, the fleshy fibres at the inferior third surround- ing a tendon which passes beneath the annular liga- ment, then over the astragalus and navicular bones, and, becoming flattened, courses downwards on the inner side of the internal cuneiform, and, reaching its lower sur- face, it is inserted into that bone, and by a flat slip into the base of the metatarsal bone of the great toe. Relations.—GoYeved. by the fascia, and lies on the in- terosseous membrane, tibia, astragalus, and navicu- lar bones, and at its insertion between the abductor pollicis and the bone, a bursa separating it from the in- ternal cuneiform; the external edge corresponds to the extensor digitorum, anterior tibial artery and nerve, and the extensor pollicis proprius. Action.—To flex the ankle-joint, and raise the inner side of the foot from the ground; to press the astragalus firmly against the external malleolus, and limit eversion. In the congenital deformity named "pes varus,this tendon is shortened, and frequently requires division. Anterior Annular LiGAMENT.—See Anatomyof Li- gaments. Extensor Pollicis Proprius.—A semipenmtorm mus- cle; arises fleshy and narrow from the anterior grooved surface of the middle third of the fibula, from the in- terosseous ligament, and outer edge of the tibia above its articulation with the fibula; the fibres pass down- wards and forwards to reach a tendon, formed on theMUSCLES OF THE LEG. 475 anterior surface of the muscle, which then runs down- wards, forwards, and inwards, passing xmder the annu- lar ligament in a separate but incomplete groove, runs over the astragalus, navicular, internal cuneiform, me- tatarsal, and phalangeal bones, and expanding, is inserted into the last or ungual phalanx of the great toe. Relations.—Internally, tibialis anticus and tibial ar- tery ; externally, extensor communis, and at the annu- lar ligament the tibial artery, which crosses beneath the tendon to its outer side; the groove in the annular liga- ment is only complete anteriorly, not posteriorly; this muscle is usually concealed by those which lie on each side, and its sheath is very imperfect. Action.—To extend the great toe, and flex the ankle- joint. Extensor Digitorum Communis.—Also a semipenni- form muscle, arises fleshy from the outer side of the head of the tibia, from the two superior thirds of the inner edge of the fibula; also from the interosseous ligament; the superior fibres pass vertically, the middle and infe- rior downwards and forwards, to be attached to a ten- don which commences on the anterior surface of the inferior third of the muscle; this tendon is divided into two portions,—an internal and external, which, remain- ing in contact, pass through a groove in the annular li- gament, then wind forwards and outwards on the dor- sum of the foot, the internal dividing into two slips, the external also into two; these, diverging, continue their course over the tarsus and metatarsus, then along the phalanges on the outer edge of the short extensor; at the first phalanx they receive the insertions of the lumbricales and interossei, and at the first interpha- langeal articulation each divides into three slips, one of which is inserted into the edge of the second phalanx, the lateral, passing forwards and again uniting, are in- serted into the posterior margin of the last phalanx. Peronjeus Tertius, or Anticus, arises from the an- terior surface of the inferior third of the fibvila, is in- separably blended with the long extensor, forms a ten- don which passes through the annular ligament, in the same groove with that muscle, and on the dorsum of the foot this tendon runs outwards and forwards, and is in-476 THE MUSCULAR SYSTEM. serted into the metatarsal bone of the fifth toe. In con- sequence of the intimate connexion of the two muscles, the relations may be examined in conjunction. Relations.—It is covered by the fascia of the leg, and lies on the interosseous ligament and fibula; the exter- nal edge corresponds to the peronseus longus and mus- culo-cutaneous nerve; inferiorly to the external malleo- lus, which separates it from the peronseus breyis; inter- nally to the tibialis anticus and anterior tibial artery and nerve, and below to the extensor pollicis proprius; on the dorsum of the foot it lies on the short extensor, and is contained in a proper fibrous sheath; in the su- perior part of the leg a thin septum separates it from the tibialis anticus, and a much stronger lamina from the peronaeus longus, the sheath being completed posteriorly by the interosseous membrane; the superior part of the muscle is pierced by the anterior tibial nerve. Action.—To extend the toes, and flex the ankle-joint. The muscles on the external side of the leg are two in number,—peronasus longus and brevis. Peron^us Longus lies on the outer side of the leg, fleshy above, tendinous below; it arises fleshy from the head of the fibula, outer side of the tibia, from the up- per third of the outer angle of the fibula, by tendmous lamina which separate the anterior and posterior mus- cles of the leg; it then passes downwards, and m the lower half of its course the fleshy fibres surrotmd the tendon, which runs downwards, outwards, and back- wards, so as to reach the posterior surface of the exter- nal malleolus, where it is received into a shallow groove with the peroneus brevis, but separated from the bone by a bursa and a layer of stratiform cartilage, and pre- served in position by a fibrous sheath; it then passes downwards and forwards, crossing the middle slip of the external lateral ligament; grooves the side of the os cal- cis, and bends at first downwards, then mwards and forwards, grooving the cuboid bone inferiorly, and is inserted directly into the base of the metatarsal bone of the great toe, also into the second, and by a ten- dinous slip into the external sesamoid at tiie base oj the first phalanx, and occasionally into the external cuneiform.MUSCLES OF THE LEG. 477 Eelations.—It lies on the fibula and peroneus brevis, and is separated anteriorly from the common extensor by the musculo-cutaneous nerve and an intermuscular septum, and posteriorly from the soleus above, and the flexor pollicis below, by a similar fibrous layer. The tendon grooves three bones,—fibula, os calcis, and cuboid; has three bursal sacs corresponding to those grooves, with separate fibrous sheaths, the last being an expansion of the calcaneo-scaphoid ligament. In the sole of the foot the tendon is close to the tarsal bones, and above all the soft parts in this region. Action.—This is a powerful muscle, in consequence of the peculiar reflection of its tendon at right angles nearly to the lever on which it acts. By its action the ankle-joint is extended and the toes everted, whilst the weight of the body is thrown on the internal arch of the foot, which, by the elasticity of the calceo-scaphoid ligament, averts the injurious efiects of shocks in leap- ing, &c. In partial and complete dislocation of the tibia inwards this muscle produces in a great degree the de- formity consequent on that accident; it is also a source of the congenital deformity termed " pes valgus." A dislocation of this tendon has been noticed by the late Mr. Wilson where it slips to the forepart of the exter- nal malleolus. Peroneus Brevis—Shorter than the last, beneath which it lies. It arises from the outer and back part of the inferior half of the fibula, continues fleshy to within an inch of the external malleolus; but the ten- don is formed in the muscle near its commencement, the fibres being at first attached to it so as to produce a bipenniform muscle: afterwards it is semipenniform, then, coursing at first downwards, and again turning backwards, it grooves the external malleolus, winds for- wards on the OS calcis, which it also grooves in common with the peroneus longus, but above that muscle, then expands, and is inserted into the projecting extremity and base of the metatarsal bone of the fifth toe. _ Relations—It is covered by the peronteus longus, and lies on the fibula and external malleolus. It grooves two bones,—external malleolus and os calcis.478 THE MUSCULAR SYSTEM. Action.-lt assists the last muscle. In Key's ampu- tation of the foot the insertions of the long and short peronei are both removed; the tibialis anticus and pos- ticus then exerting an uncontrolled action on the stump, turning it permanently inwards.

The internal head, much longer, lies on the femur, on a large bursa which sometimes communicates with the joint, ligament of Winslow, internal inferior artery, and poplitseus; the outer edge corresponds to the popliteal space and its contents, the inner to the semitendinosus and semimembranosus tendons. More internally the posterior surface is subfascial; the fleshy belly is convex behind, and is covered by the skin, with two layers of fascia and the posterior saphenous vein and nerve. It lies on the solasus and plantaris; the outer edge corresponds to the peroneus longus and bre- vis, the inner to the internal saphenous vein and nerve. The tendo Achillis stands out prominently, and lies on the deep fascia; externally it is bordered by the poste- rior saphenous vein and nerve, and the inner edge serves as a guide to cutting down on the posterior tibial ar- tery in the inferior third of the leg. It is separated trom the os calcis above by a bursa, and is also covered posteriorly by fat, beneath which a bursa often exists. Ihe popliteal space separates the two heads superiorly _ Action.—Thisis the most powerful muscle in the body in consequence of its being inserted at right angles to the lever on which it acts; it flexes the knee-joint, and serves the purpose of an active ligament, by preventing the tibia slipping backwards; it also extends the ankle- joint, as m progression, when it represents a lever of the second order in action, the fulcrum being at the toes, the power at the insertion of the tendon, and the weight transmitted through the tibia to the astragalus48^) THE MUSCULAR SYSTEM. If the foot is raised from the ground during extension of the ankle, it represents a lever of the first order, the power being behind, the weight anteriorly, and the lul- crum intermediate; and here it may be mentioned that flexion of the ankle represents the third order of lever, the weight being in front at the toes, the fulcrum pos- teriorly at the joint, and the power intermediate be- tween them. In progression, the second order of lever occurs, because, being the most powerful, it contributes a greater facility to that motion; and sometimes the sudden contraction of the muscular fibres ruptures the tendo Achillis,—an accident most liable to take place '"pL'rr; lies beneath the last, which should be di- vided to expose it.

On cutting across the last muscle the deep fascia is seen, attached to the tibia and fibula above, and to the sheaths of those tendons which pass behind the malleoli inferiorly; internally it is firmly connected to the inner edge of the tibia, and externally to the fibula; supe- riorly it is strengthened by the expansion of the semi- membranosus muscle, and the fibres run transversely, becoming much stronger below than above. On re- moving this fascia the deep layer of muscles is exposed; these are four in number,—poplitseus, flexor digito- rum communis, tibialis posticus, and flexor pollicis proprius. PoPLmEus lies external and posterior to the knee- joint, arising by a strong round tendon from a hori- zontal groove on the external condyle of the femur under cover of the external lateral ligament; also from the synovial membrane of the articulation which con- nects it to the external semilunar cartilage. The ten- don now divides into fasciculi, and gives "origin to the flat, fleshy, triangular muscle, the direction being downwards, backwards, and outwards, to reach an oblique Ime on the tibia, into which it is inserted, as well as into the bone above that line and the fascia which covers its surface. Relations—It lies on the external condyle of the fe- mur, external semilunar cartilage, to which it is con- nected by synovial membrane and tendinous fibres ti- bio-fibular articulation, and tibia; and it is covered by the external lateral ligament, tendon of the biceps, and peronajal nerve, external head of gastrocnemius and plantaris, popliteeal nerve, vein, and artery, expansion of the semimembranosus muscle, internal inferior arti- cular artery, and inner head of the gastrocnemius Occasionally the poplitfeal'artery divides on its surface when it will also support the anterior and posterior ti- bial arteries. _ Action.—To flex the knee-joint and rotate the leo- inwards during flexion, but the thigh outwards in the extended state. Flexor Digitorum Communis lies on the posterior482 THE MUSCULAR SYSTEM. surface of the tibia; arises from that bone inferior and internal to the poplitaeal line, and continues to adhere to its posterior and internal surface for about six inches; also from the interosseous ligament and the intermuscu- lar septum, which separates it from the tibialis posti- cus- the fibres pass downwards and backwards, becom- ino-'attached to a tendon that lies in the centre of the muscle, producing a penniform arrangement of the fibres; the tendon now assumes a rounded form, stiil covered by a few fleshy fibres, then passes beneath the in- ternal annular ligament, buried in a groove on the back of the internal malleolus, in company with the tibialis posticus, but each possessing its separate fibrous sheath and bursal membrane; this sheath is continued into the plantar region, where the tendon runs forwards and outwards, lying beneath the flexor pollicis, to which it is connected by a fascia, sometimes by an obliquely de- fined tendinous slip; anterior to this the outer edge re- ceives the insertion of the musculus accessorius, and then divides into four tendons, which at the metacarpo- phalangeal articulations enter an osteo-fibrous canal, similai in structure and formation to that m the hand, and likewise containing the slips of the short flexor, both being surrounded by a distinct synovial saccule; and at the second phalanx the short flexor tendons are split, the long passing through them to be inserted into the posterior edge of the ungual or last phalanx; the short slips expanding on the bone, and again uniting, are inserted in the middle phalanx. _ Relations—It is covered by the deep fascia, posterior tibial vessels and nerves, annular ligament, and in the sole of the foot by the superficial layer of muscles and phalangeal sheaths; it lies on the tibia, interosseous iga- Sent tendon of tibialis posticus, interna lateral liga- ment; OS calcis, flexor pollicis tendon, third layer of plantar muscles, and phalanges.

Tibialis Posticus lies in the interosseous space, and arises from the inner and posterior edge of the fibula, from the outer margin of the tibia below and ex- ternal to the solseus and flexor communis, interosseous ligament, and also from the fascia which covers it; pass- ing downwards and inwards, it forms a tendon that runs inwards under the flexor communis, appearing on its inner margin at the internal malleolus, where they are contained in the same groove and fibrous sheath; it then passes into the sole of the foot beneath the calca- neo-scaphoid ligament, usually having a sesamoid bone at this point; the tendon is then inserted into the tu- bercle on the under surface of the navicular bone; secondly, into the internal cuneiform; thirdly, by an external slip which passes over the two external cunei- form into the base of the second and third metatarsal and cuboid bone, but sometimes it does not reach the latter. Relations—It lies on the tibia, fibula, and interos- seous ligament in the leg, and is overlapped by the flexors communis and poUicis, and posterior tibial ves- sels and nerve. In the foot it lies on the internal lateral ligament, in a strong fibrous sheath, and beneath the calcaneo-scaphoid above the adductor pollicis; at its ori- gin the anterior tibial vessels run between its heads often carrying fibres of the muscle through the interos- seous ligament to its anterior surface. Action.—To extend the ankle-joint, also to turn the toot inwards, co-operating with the tibialis anticus. iLEXOR Pollicis Longus is the most external of the deep muscles, and also the largest and most fleshy It arises from the two inferior thirds of the posterior and external surface of the fibula, from the septum of the tibialis posticus, and also from a fibrous layer which separates it from the peronsei; the muscle continuing fleshy to the ankle receives a slight attachment from the interosseous ligament; the tendon is first clearly vi- sible at the posterior edge of the tibia, which it some- times slightly grooves; an oblique notch in the posterior edge of the astragalus then receives the tendon, where it Y 2484 THE MUSCULAR SYSTEM. is retained by a process from the posterior di-f ision of the external lateral ligament; and" lastly, it grooves the inferior surface of the internal process of the os calcis (sustentaculum tali); then runs forwards and inwards above the flexor communis, to which it is united by a slip, passes between the heads of the short flexor of the "•reat toe and the two sesamoid bones, and is ultimately fiiserted into the posterior edge of the ungual phalanx of the great toe. Relations.—li corresponds mternally to the tibialis posticus and peroneal vessels, externally to the peronsei; behind to the solseus, tendo Achillis, and fascia; and it lies on the fibula, tibia, and interosseous ligament; also on the peroneal vessels. Action. To flex the phalanges of the toe, to extend the aukle-joint, and turn the foot outwards. These three tendons pass beneath a fibrous or fascial band (internal annular ligament), stretched between the internal mal- leolus and the os calcis ; this has been fully described with the ligaments of the ankle-joint. ANATOMY OF THE FOOT. The fascia on the dorsum of the foot is thin, and in- closes the superficial veins and nerves in thin sheaths, while similar funnel-shaped tubules surround the ten- dons to which the fascial investment is connected by re- ticul'ar areolar tissue. The superficial veins consist ot a tarsal arch and the origins of the external and internal saphena from either of its angles; the superficial nerves are the internal and external tarsal branches of the musculo-cutaneous for the supply of the dorsal aspect ot the toes; and on removing these superficial parts a sin- gle muscle is exposed,—the extensor digitorum brevis. Extensor Digitorum Brevis.—Somewhat square; lies on the dorsum of the foot, arising from the trian- gular fossa formed by the neck of the astragalus and upper surface of the os calcis, also from the os calcis at the^outer and anterior part of its neck, and from the dorsal aspect of the cuboid bone; it passes forwards and inwards, dividing into four fleshy bellies, to each of which a narrow tendon is attached; these pass forwards485 MUSCLES OF THE FOOT. and inwards, crossing beneath the tendons of the exten- sor digitorum and pollicis at an acute angle, at the first phalanx each lying to the outer side of the correspond- ing long tendon, that which is destined for the great toe being the larger; they then become united with the long tendons, expand, and are inserted into the dorsal surface of the phalanges. Relations—It lies on the tarsal bones and phalanges, the internal tendon crossing the dorsalis pedis artery, and it is covered by the long extensor tendons, while a large branch of the anterior tibial nerve passes throuffh the muscle. ° Action.—To extend the toes, and keep the tarsal bones in close apposition. The integument on the sole of the foot has been al- ready examined, and on removing this covering and the cushion of fat lying beneath it, the os calcis and promi- nent points of the first and fifth metatarsal bones and plantar fascia aie exposed, the last consisting of three portions,—the middle, triangular in figure, being the strongest; the external, of mediate strength; and the in- ternal, which lies on a plain superior, is the weakest. Middle Portion of Plantar Fascia Triangular, apex behind, base anteriorly; it arises thick and round from the inferior part of the os calcis, passes forwards, ex- panding, and at the metatarso-phalangeal articulations it divides into four, sometimes five slips; these again subdi- vide, arching over the flexor tendons, to be attached to the lateral ligaments of the joints before mentioned; trans- verse bands passing across the sulci between the toes, and forming an osteo-fibrous arch for the transmission of the tendons of the lumbricales, with the digital nerves and vessels; the anterior, or curved margin of each sub- division being continuous with the sheaths of the flexor tendons on the four outer toes. The fibres of this layer run forwards, but anteriorly the slips are connected by cross bands, which can frequently be raised as a distinct structure. External Division arises posteriorly from the os calcis and sheath of the peronaji; it passes forwards, one portion being connected to the projecting point of the fifth metatarsal bone, the second much weaker, be-486 THE JTOSCULAR SYSTEM- ing prolonged over the surface of the flexor brevis mi- nimi digiti to the base of the first phalanx, to which it is attached; the external margin is continuous with the dorsal fascia, while the internal ascends in conjunction with the middle portion to form a septum separating the external from the middle set of muscles. Internal Division of the Plantar Fascia arises from the internal annular ligament, passes forwards, and, reaching the first phalanx of the great toe, receives a shp from the middle division, and is inserted into sides ot that articulation by a slip on each margin, the internal edge being attached to the inner side of the tarsus, whi e the outer sends upwards a process which with the middle portion forms the internal intermuscular septum, i his fascia not only binds down the plantar muscles, but it also preserves the arch of the foot, which it strengthens durin<- progression. The muscles of the plantar region are numerous, and may be divided into four layers : in the first there are three muscles:—abductor poilicis, flexor digitorum brevis, and the abductor minimi digiti. Abductor PoLLicis.-Fleshy and broad behmd ten- dinous in front. It arises from the interna tubercle on the OS calcis, and from the internal annular ligament fascia, and intermuscular septum, passes forwards and inwards, and is inserted into the inner side of the base ot the first phalanx of the great toe. Relations—It is covered by the fascia and lies on the long flexor tendons, posterior tibial ^^^^f nerves, which separate its two heads; also on the flexor poilicis brevis and tibialis anticus tendon. Action.—To flex the great toe.

Action—To flex the toes. Abductor Minimi Digiti Lies on the external side of the foot, and arises from the external tubercle on the OS calcis, fascia, and intermuscular septum; also from the external thickened margin of the plantar fascia, as far forward as the metatarsal bone; it passes forwards, and is inserted into the base of the first pha- lanx of the little toe. Relations.—Inferiorly it lies on the plantar fascia, superiorly it corresponds to the musculus accessorius, flexor brevis minimi digiti, and bones of the little toe. Action—As its name implies. In the second layer are found the tendons of the flexor digitorum and poUicis, musculus accessorius, and lumbricales. The Flexor Pollicis Tendon is seen coursing for- wards and inwards, and the common flexor crossing be- neath it at an acute angle, both so connected that the obliquity of action produced by their direction may be modified. Musculus Accessorius.—A fleshy sheet; arises from the inferior and internal part of the os calcis, passes obliquely downwards, forwards, and inwards, to be in- serted, thin, aponeurotic, and fleshy, into the outer side of the long flexor tendons. Relations.—It is covered by the flexor digitorum brevis, abductor minimi digiti, and the external plantar artery and nerve, and it lies on the os calcis and caL- caneo-cuboid ligament. Action.—To counteract the obliquity of the long flexor muscle. Lumbricales.—Four small muscles, which arise from the internal sides of the long flexor tendons, pass for- Avards, and are inserted by small but flat bands into the extensor tendons on the back of the first phalanx; also into the side of the latter. Relations.—They lie beneath the third layer, and are concealed superficially by the short flexor tendons; the tendons, at first round, pass in the intervals between the heads of the metatarsal bones, above the brido-edTHE MUSCULAR SYSTEM. 488 slip of the plantar fascia, and also above the digital nerves and vessels; they are only attached to the four outer toes, the great not receiving any. Action To flex the first phalanx, and likewise bind down the extensor tendons on the dorsum of the pha- langes. The muscles in the third layer are four in number:—- flexor pollicis brevis, adductor pollicis, flexor brevis mi- nimi digiti, and transversalis pedis. Flexor Pollicis Brevis arises tendinous from the cuboid, external cuneiform, and occasionally from the under surface of the os calcis; it passes forwards, becoming fleshy, and is inserted by two tendons into the internal and external sesamoid bones and base of the first phalanx of the great toe. Eelatmis.—Belovf with the abductor and tendon ot the long fiexor, and above with the bones and the tibialis posticus. Action To flex the first phalanx. Adductor Pollicis.—Triangular in shape, lies ex- ternal to the last; it arises from the sheath of the ten- don of the peronseuslongus and the base of the second, third, and fourth metatarsal bones, passes forwards and inwards, and is inserted tendinous into the external sesa- moid bone and base of the first phalanx of the great toe. Relations.—It has below it the long and short flexors, lumbricales, and musculus accessorius, and superiorly it lies on the tarsal bones. Action—T^o adduct the great toe. ^ , j ^ Transversalis Pedis.—Placed across the heads ot the metatarsal bones; it arises from the anterior extre- mities of the outer four of those bones; passes inwards and forwards, and is inserted into the external sesamoid bone and base of the first phalanx of the great toe Relations.—It is covered by the long and short flexor tendons, lumbricales, and the digital vessels and nerves, and it lies on the metatarsal bones, ligaments, and mter- ossei ldwn.-To adduct the great toe in reference to the mesial line of the foot. .

Relations. — Superficially with the long and short flexor tendons, external lumbricalis, abductor, and fascia, deeply with the bone and external interosseous muscle. Action—To flex the little toe. The fourth layer consists of the tendon of the pero- n£Eus longus and the interossei. The PERONiEus Longus Tendon is concealed from view by its proper sheath; this should be laid open, and the groove examined in which it lies. Interossei.—These consist of two layers, dorsal and plantar; four in the former, three in the latter. Dorsal Interossei—These arise by a double origin from the sides of the metatarsal bones, the twoheads°of the first being separated by the communicating branch of the anterior tibial artery; they pass forwards, termi- nating in tendons which are inserted into the side of the base of the first phalanx, and into the extensor ten- don, assisting to form the dorsal phalangeal aponeurosis; the first is inserted into the inner side of the second toe; the second, third, and fourth, into the outer side of their corresponding toes; the first being an abductor, the remaining three, adductors. Plantar Interossei—These are three in number, and arise from the inner or tibial side and base of the three external metatarsal bones; they pass forwards, and are inserted into the internal side of the three ex- ternal phalanges, at their bases, and into the extensor tendons—these are adductors. Relations.—Ihe dorsal interossei are covered by a strong fascia, and lie on the plantar set, at their poste- rior extremity being perforated by small communicat- ing arteries; the plantar are covered by the dorsal, and he on the long and short flexor tendons, lumbricales, and digital vessels. Their action has already been ex- plained.490 SECTION IV. CAVITY OF THE CHEST. The thorax is situated at the superior part of the trunk, and contains the organs of circulation and respiration, together with the several nerves and vessels appertain- ing to and connected with their functions. The walls of the cavity are yielding, to accommodate the varying increase and diminution of the lungs, but at the same time sufficiently resisting to protect them from the in- fluence of atmospheric pressure during their_ active function in respiration. Let the cavity be laid open by dividing the cartilages of the ribs, and cautiously raising the sternum; immediately posterior to the latter a longitudinal gutter may be observed, wide superiorly and inferiorly, and constricted a little above its centre; this is the anterior mediastinum, receiving that name from its almost median position, being bounded ante- riorly by the posterior surface of the sternum and pos- terior sternal aponeurosis, laterally by the pleur^ passing from the sternum to the anterior and lateral part of the pericardium, and posteriorly by the peri- cardium, where it is deficient of serous covering. The constriction of the centre has given rise to its division into a superior and inferior triangle, whilst from before backwards the figure is also triangular, with the base in front and the apex behind; in the upper part are situated the remains of the thymus gland, origins of the sterno-hyoid and thyroid muscles, with branches oi the omohyoid plexus passing downwards to supply them and the internal mammary artery, which borders its margins; in the lower division are the triangulares sterni muscles, rami abdominales of the internal mammary arteries, and lymphatic glands, through which pass the superficial ab- sorbents from the liver. During life the pleura3 are accu- rately moulded on the contained parts, so that no actual space exists until the sternum is raised.491 PLEURA. Now' let the ribs be sawed nearly through about their centres, and then bend them backwards; this will facilitate the further examination of the contents. The pleuree are double sacs of serous membrane, each being distinct and confined to a single side, and as shut sacs consist of a parietal and visceral layer ; the former lining and adhering to the inclosing walls, the latter reflected around the contained parts, one surface being attached, rough and fibrous; the second internal, free and smooth, lubricated by a vapour or halitus, exhaled by its surface. The perfect continuity of the membrane may be understood by following its several reflections. Thus from the posterior surface of the sternum the pleura passes backwards and inwards to the fore-part and sides of the pericardium, thus forming the lateral boundaries of the anterior mediastinum; from the latter point it is reflected over the anterior face of the root of the lung, which conducts it to its internal or concave surface, until it reaches the thin or free edge; then over the convex surface lining the pulmonary fissures, until the poste- rior or thick margin is reached, and thence to the back of the root; from this it passes to the posterior and lateral part of the pericardium, where it is nearest to the opposite sac, is then reflected on the sides of the bodies of the vertebrte,—thus constituting the lateral wall of the posterior mediastinum; it next lines the concavities of the ribs, here becoming continuous with the membrane whei'e the sac was first opened; supe- riorly it forms a cul de sac, passing higher on the right side than the left, and below it covers and adheres to the superior surface of the diaphragm, a fold or process here connecting the diaphragmatic layer with the pulmo- nary, termed ligamentum latum pulmonis; this is of an oblong figure, narrow in the centre, wide above and below; attached superiorly to the lower edge of the root of the lung; inferiorly to the diaphragm; externally it is free; and internally, connected to the pericardium. The Pleura consists of a surface layer of squamous epithelium, supported on a fine semitransparent basement membrane, the areolar tissue subjacent to the last forming in some situations a dense fibrous layer, con- ferring on the pleura the compound character of a sero-492 CAVITY OF THE CHEST. fibrous tissue. As the membrane differs in its characters, it will be better examined in distinct portions; thus, the costal is strong, but the absolute serous membrane thin and transparent, the strength resulting from the marked density of the fibrous layer, which adheres firmly to the costal periosteum; it is stronger ^nd thicker over the intercostal muscles, to which the ad- hesion is slight; while on the pericardium the serous layer is strong, but the fibrous is lax, and contains adeps in old subjects; it here unites the pleura to the pericardium, and retains the phrenic nerve in its situa- tion. As the pleura forms the walls of the anterior mediastinum, it is lined on its external surface by a fascial layer, differing from the fibrous membrane here- tofore mentioned in being weaker, and the fibrous cha- racter less appreciable; it is also distinctly laminated, and with such facility can it be separated from the serous layer, that it appears to be more connected to the mediastinum and pericardium than to the pleura, and we have distinctly traced its continuity with the fibrous tissue of the cervico-thoracic septum. The diaphragmatic portion is thin, and the fibrous layer is here represented by fine connecting areolar tissue. The cone of the pleura ascends into the neck, bounded above and before by the subclavian artery, anteriorly by the internal mammary, and posteriorly by the superior intercostal, here occupying a recess between the sca- leni muscles; it is surrounded and indented by the inner margin of the first rib, to which it intimately ad- heres, and frequently exhibits in this situation a hori- zontal white line dividing the supra-costal from the intra-thoracic portion; a strong and dense layer of fascia, derived from the prsevertebral aponeurosis, covers and adheres to its surface, protecting the lung from atmos- pheric pressure; this can be raised, layer after layer, by a needle, and its manifest resistance is shown by the difticulty experienced in the attempt to force a blunt instrument through its structure. The existence of this fibrous layer coating the pleura externally ex- plains the fact that abscesses rarely open into the cavity of the chest, although the collection of matter may he in immediate contact with the superficial surface ot the493 LUNGS. membrane. The pulmonary portion is fine, smooth, and perfectly transparent in the child, but often much thickened in old subjects, exhibiting laminated scales of bone in some situations. It is believed that the sub- pleural fibrous layer is absent, but of this we will speak presently. The Lungs are symmetrical organs, communicating only through the medium of the bronchial tubes, each being somewhat conical in figure, presenting an apex and base, two margins, and two surfaces. The apex, di- rected upwards, lies superiorly between the scaleni mus- cles, extending higher on the right side than on the left; an horizontal constriction, corresponding to the inner margin of the first rib, limits below the extrathoracic portion; the base is concave and triangular, and rests on the diaphragm; the anterior margin, thick above, thin and interrupted below, overlaps the pericardium, corres- ponding to the anterior mediastinum; that on the right side presenting two grooves and a similar number of notches; commencing at the apex, there is first an oblique groove for the descending cava; this is directed inwards and downwards; secondly, an excavation for the pro- minence of the right auricle; and lastly, the anterior extremities of the greater and lesser pulmonary fissures; the left anterior edge is interrupted from above down- wards, first near the apex by a groove for the left sub- clavian artery, sometimes enlarged to accommodate the descending curve of the aorta; secondly, a wide notch for the apex of the heart; and lastly, immediately above the base, the anterior termination of the great pulmo- nary fissures. The posterior thick margin lies on the sulcus, between the sides of the bodies of the vertebra and angles of the ribs, the left being sometimes grooved longitudmally for the descending aorta; the internal or concave surface corresponds to the pericardium and pos- terior mediastinum, also to the root of the orcran by which the vessels enter and leave, this being situated one-third from the apex, and two-thirds from the an- terior thin edge; the external surface, convex, corre- sponds to the concavities of the ribs and pleura; it is deeply marked by fissures dividing the lung into lobes- the great pulmonary fissure runs downwards, forwards'CAVITY OF THE CHEST. 494 and inwards, commencing two inches below and behind the apex, and passing through the entire thickness, ter- minates about one inch above and in front of the base, thus dividing the lung into two lobes; from the upper third of the great fissure on the right side a second passes forwards, so as to cut off a smaller middle lobe. The superior of these lobes is triangular, small, and pointed above, wide and oblique inferiorly, the base concealing the inferior; the latter is also triangular, the base posteriorly thick and round, the apex anteriorly and inferiorly; the middle lobe of the right lung is small, the base anteriorly thin and sharp, the apex pos- teriorly. In old age, when the ribs collapse, the upper lobes descend so as in a great measure to conceal the in- ferior anteriorly. In the female a very small portion of the inferior lobe is visible anteriorly; and in cases where the chest has been disfigured by tight lacing, the in- ferior lobe is pressed upwards, the superior ghdmg downwards on its anterior surface, until it rests on the diaphragm. We have seen four lobes on each side m one instance, and three on the left in two cases; mboth examples the fissures, as in the normal arrangement, ex- tended through the complete thickness of the organ as far as the root. These interruptions allow the lungs to descend with greater facility, as they follow the diaphragm in inspiration, also tending to isolate disease, and by the larger extent of surface exposed to the serous mem- brane the effects of friction are diminished. In the bird tribe, where the diaphragm is deficient, the fissures are absent. The lungs present the following points oi dif- ference when they are contrasted with each other:— the right is shorter in consequence of the liver imping- ing on the right thoracic space; the left is longer but narrower, the deficiency in width depending on the po- sition of the heart; the right is likewise somewhat higher in the neck, and a little heavier than the left, present- ing also under usual circumstances three lobes, whilst the left has only two. The lungs are of a pa e red or rose colour in the child, grey in the adult, dark purple, mottled with black spots, in old age; they ahv-aysre ain a certain amount of air, which causes crepitation when their structure is compressed. The weight m the adult495 LUNGS. is generally from eighteen to twenty-four oimces for each organ, the right being somewhat the heavier, but it is difhcult to determine even the approximate weight, as it is influenced by the amount of blood it contains after death. In the foetus the weight of the lungs is to that of the body as one to sixty, and after the first re- spiration as one to thirty, the increase depending on the admission of the blood into the pulmonary vessels. Be- fore birth the lung is absolutely lighter, but speci- fically heavier; but after birth the reverse obtains, and it is from this circumstance the hydrostatic test, in cases of suspected infanticide, is of some utility to determine whether the infant was still-born or other- Avise. The structures entering into the composition of these organs must now be examined in detail. They consist of, firstly, membranes, sero-fibrous and mucous; secondly, of the bronchial ramifications and their terminal air-cells; thirdly, of the pulmonary arteries and veins; fourthly, of bronchial arteries and veins; fifthly, of areolar tissue, Avhich forms the parenchyma; sixthly, of the pulmo- nary branches of the pneumogastric and sympathetic nerves; and lastly, of the lymphatic system, consisting of vessels and glands. Serous Membrane—Cruveilhier denies the existence of any fibrous tissue beneath it; but the presence of such a structure can easily be demonstrated by making a cautious triangular incision through the pleura, then let the apex be grasped by a good forceps, and torn up, •when the friable structure of the lung is still smooth, and covered by a glistening fibrous layer, strongest in those depressions which exist in the surface of a col- lapsed lung. In a case of aneurism which exercised pressure on the root of the right lung, that organ being much contracted, the fibrous membrane was exceedingly well marked, and it is also distinct in the seal and otter. The use of such a structure is evidently to prevent over- distention of the lung, and promote its contraction; it will also prevent the contents ofvomicse beino- dis- charged into the cavity of the pleura. It has been stated before, that in advanced life this membrane becomes thickened independent of disease. The mucous mem-496 CAVITY OF THE CHEST. brane will be examined with the bronchi after the con- stituents and relations of the root of the organ have been described. KooTS of the Lungs.—These are fixed points by which a communication is established between the heart and atmosphere on the one hand, and the lungs on the other; they consist of the bronchial tube, pulmonary artery and vein, bronchial arteries and veins, nerves, absor- bents, and areolar tissue, each being about an inch in length, bounded externally by the concave surface of the lung, which here presents a hilus, oval from above downwards, for the reception of its constituents; and internally and anteriorly by the pericardium; their length is variable, being from three-quarters to an inch and a half, and two inches from above downwards, cor- responding^ to the fourth dorsal vertebra on the left side, to the third on the right. The root of the right lung corresponds above to the curve of the vena azygos and division of the pneumogastric nerve; below to the hga- inentum latum pulmonis; anteriorly to the phrenic nerve and descending cava, and posteriorly to the vena azygos ascending in the posterior mediastmum. The root ot the left lung is bounded above by the arch of the aorta, ductus arteriosus, left laryngeal recurrent nerve, and di- vision of the pneumogastric nerve into anterior and pos- terior branches; inferiorly by the ligamentum latum pulmonis; anteriorly by the phrenic nerve; and poste- riorlv by the descending aorta. Now remove the pleura from the surface, and it will be seen that the pu mo- narv veins are the most anterior and inferior on both sides, but on the right the pulmonary artery lies above it, and most superiorly the bronchial tube, while on the left side the tube is above the vein and below the ar- tery the order being from below on the right side,—vein, artery, tube; on the left in a similar direction,-vem, tSrtery but on both, from before backwards, the orde isthesame,-namely, vein, artery,tube. Now raise the lung, and draw it to the opposite side by hooks, when, by removing the pleura, with some areolar tissue Tnd bronchial glands, the parts constituting the roots '''Bronchial TuBES.-These are continuations of the497 LUNGS. trachea, which they resemble in structure. On the body of the third dorsal vertebra the latter divides into two branches of unequal diameters, the right being the lar- ger, shorter and more transverse; the left longer, smaller, and more in the direction of the original tube; the for- mer, in its course to reach the hilus of the lung, lies on the right side of the oesophagus, and crosses the vena azygos; in front, corresponding to the pericardium and right pulmonary artery, which separates the vena cava from the tube, while the left bronchus crosses the (Esopha- gus and aorta, lying posterior to the pericardium, pulmo- nary veins, and artery. On entering the h\ng the tubes divide into two branches, the inferior on the right side again subdividing for the middle and inferior lobes; a dichotomous division occurs in the substance of the organ for about fifteen repetitions, the terminal tiibes then entering their proper lobules where their ultimate ramifications are situated. Structure of the Bronchial Tubes.—The extra-pulmo- monary portion, and also as far as the tertiary divisions in the lung, present the same anatomical elements as the trachea, consisting of a series of rings, forming each about three-fourths of a circle, and incomplete pos- teriorly. These rings terminate in blunted points, the space between them being occupied by mucous mem- brane, glands, elastic tissue with well-marked longitu- dinal fibres; and lastly, with a transverse muscular layer, from within outwards; the margins of the ring being also united to each other by mucous membrane and elastic tissue. Subsequent to the tertiary subdivi- sion, the structural anatomy undergoes a peculiar mo- dification, the cartilaginous rings completely surround- ing the tube, but yet the circle being composed of se- parate segments, three or four in number, with angular extremities, or notched, united by mutual reception, but always admitting of a certain amount of overlapping, which is more evident when the tube has been artifi- cially contracted by exhaustion of the air it may con- tain. The muscular layer assumes a circular arrange- ment, and the elastic tissue is still visible as elevated longitudinal fibres, while the mucous membrane is less vascular, fine, and thinner than that of the primary sub-498 CAVITY OF THE CHEST. divisions of the tubes, but its surface still retains tlie ciliated epithelium peculiar to the respiratory mucous tissue. When the tubes reach about the fifteenth divi- sion, the cartilaginous element of their walls ceases to exist, the elastic membranous tissue being all that re- mains of the former structures; the tube still divides, and the resulting canals undergo further subdivision, until each terminates in a separate air-cell, these being distinct, and merely communicating with each other through the medium of the central tube, the whole con- stituting a ptilmonary lobule (Reisseissen). This view has the advantage of much simplicity, and resembles the structure of the ramified secreting glands, but still it scarcely seems consistent to believe, that where nature required to create an extensive free surface, by which the blood may come in contact with the atmosphere, but that a more certain means of accomplishing that object would have occurred; and such is the fact, if the inves- tigation of Mr. Eainey is entitled to respect; and from certain circumstances connected with the comparative anatomy of the lungs, and numerous examinations of pulmonary tissue prepared in a variety of ways, it ap- pears to us that Mr. Rainey has approached nearer to the truth in many respects, than any other investiga- tor of this complex portion of structural anatomy, lhat the epithelium is present even in the air-cells is beyond question, but it becomes flatter, the ciliffi being scarcely if at all perceptible, a dense membranous layer existing external to this in the ultimate tubes, but without any muscular covering. Numbers of small branches proceed from the surface of the central canal, each small ramifa- cation terminating in a minute cell, whilst from its sides columns of cells arranged eccentric to the tube appear to form its walls; these cells communicate, the most in- ternal with the tube, and each succeeding co umn witli that which lies external to it; each tube, with its satel- lite columns of air-cells, constituting a pulmonary lobule These cells are variously figured, some being hexagonal or angular, others oval or elongated in the axis of the tube. The subfibrous layer on the pleural surface of the lung principally consists of an f liver), wh ch sinks between the lobules, and then breaksLUNGS. 499 up into bands or fasciculi that wave or interlace in irregular circles around the cells, tending to preserve their expanded condition, the latter consisting struc- turally of the thin and transparent condition of the mucous membrane on which the capillaries are ex- panded ; here thinning the wall to such an extent, that merely the flattened epithelium separates the capillary coat from the air, and in consequence of the tenuity and some peculiar pathological characters, the ultimate mu- cous lining is conceived to be similar to a serous mem- brane (Stokes). The approximative diameter of each air- cell ranges from l-70th to l-200th of an inch, the total number amounting to about six millions in both lungs. The capillary vessels are internal to the elastic bands be- fore mentioned, and are placed between the cells so that both surfaces of the vessel are subjected to the influ- ence of the atmosphere, the moist cell membrane being in a favourable condition to promote the mutual inter- change of elements between the inspired air and the venous blood, the oxygen of the former being consumed, and its union with the carbon, the effete product of the disintegrated tissues producing carbonic acid, which permeates the moist walls of the air-cell, while a further union of oxygen with hydrogen composes the pulmo- nary exhalation. The pulmonary artery at the root of each hmg conveys the venous fluid to the capillaries, and the blood, being arterialized by the influence of respiration, is returned by the pulmonary veins, two on each side; on the right the vein of the inferior and mid- dle lobes uniting, making the number of these vessels similar on both sides. The right pulmonary veins pass in their course to reach the left auricle behind the right auricle and ascending aorta, and in front of the spine, thoracic duct, vena azygos, and oesophagus, lying on the latter at the point where they pierce the pericardium, while the left pass anterior to the bronchial tube, de- scending aorta, and esophagus, behind the left auricle and phrenic nerve, ultimately terminating, like the right, in the posterior wall of that cavity. The nerves of the lungs are derived from the pneumogastric and sympa- thetic; the former at the superior margin of the root, giving off several filaments, that pass to the anterior surface beneath the curve of the vena azygos, forming500 CAVITY OP THE CHEST. the anterior pulmonary plexus. On the posterior sur- face of the root the nerve becomes flattened, lying be- tween the serous membrane and the bronchial tubes, and in this situation a number of branches are detached, more numerous than the anterior, to constitute the pos- terior pulmonary plexus, which also receives filaments from the third, fourth, and fifth thoracic ganglia of the sympathetic; and having communicated with that of the opposite side, its branches enter the substance of the lung, several pursuing the pulmonary vessels, but the principal set of both anterior and posterior divisions follows the successive divisions of the bronchial tubes, communicating frequently through filaments which run between the angles of bifurcation, some disappearing on the muscular layer of the bronchi, whilst the majority can be traced even to the lobular terminations of the tubes. These nerves exercise an important influence over the function of respiration, both in man and the lower animals, and have been frequently made the subject of experimental research. When divided, it appears from the observations of Dr. Eeid that the respirations di- minish in frequency; secondly, that congestion ensues; and thirdly, an effusion of frothy serum takes place into the air-cells, with exudation of blood plasma into the parenchymatous tissue, producing the second stage of pneumonia; and if the animals survive for a period suflaciently long, purulent infiltration supervenes, and even gangrene may result, where a prolonged tolerance of the section exists, as in dogs. Lymphatics.—These are divisible into a superficial and deep set of branches, on the surface forming a re- ticulated network with frequent varicose enlargements; they run towards the bronchial glands at the root of the lung, the deep set being seen in the interlobular areolar tissue, and also reaching the glands at the root, where they communicate with the superficial division; those on the left open into the great thoracic duct, im- mediately before it leaves the chest, whilst those on the right open into the lesser or right thoracic duct. Development—lungs are developed as diverti- cula from the oesophageal membraneabout the sixth week of intra-uterine life, the tubes consisting of right and left. From their surface cajcal wartlike buds are de-501 POSTERIOR MEDIASTINUM. veloped, which augment and multiply the tubules. These again are surrounded by a parenchymatous areolar tis- sue, that forms the nidus for the further development of successive repetitions of the cell and tubular elements of the lung. The pulmonary vessels ramify in the pa- renchyma of the cells, but as these vessels in foetal life contain but a small amount of blood, it would seem that they merely provide for structural increase during that period, a process which continues until the forty- fifth year. The student should now proceed with the examina- tion of the posterior mediastinum, and for this purpose the right lung may be removed at its root, and the pleura cautiously torn from the ribs and vertebree; then, by drawing the pericardium towards the left side, and retaining it in that position with hooks, and removing some areolar tissue, the parts in this region will be ex- posed. The posterior mediastinum is of an irregular triangular figure, bounded posteriorly by the bodies of the vertebra;, extending from the third to the tenth dor- sal, also by the anterior vaginal ligament, which clothes the anterior surface of those bones; anteriorly, by the pericardium, which forms the apex of the space; and laterally by the pleura as it passes from the posterior and lateral part of the pericardium to the bodies of the vertebra. Within this space a number of parts are in- closed, supported in their position by the spinal column, and having different relations to each other in the up- per and lower division of the mediastinum. On the right side are seen the greater and lesser splanchnic nerves; mternal to these, the vena azygos; still nearer to the mesian line, the thoracic duct; next in order the aorta; after this, and to its left side, the cEsophagus, with the pneumogastric nerves; the vena azygos minor follows; and lastly, the left greater and lesser splanch- nic nerves; the right intercostal arteries, with the left intercostal veins, are contained within its limits, but tthe trachea divides at its superior boundary, and' can- not therefore be said to lie within the mediastinum if accurately localized. ' Splanchnic Nerves.—In connexion with these the : thoracic division of the sympathetic will be briefly no-1 502 CAVITY OF THE CHEST. tioed. It consists of a series of ganglia, twelve in num- ber, on either side united with each other by vertical filaments, and lying on the neck of the several ribs, from which they are separated by the stellate ligaments, and are covered by the pleura. Delicate filaments from the sixth, seventh, eighth, ninth, and tenth thoracic ganglia pass downwards and inwards, forming a single nerve opposite the tenth dorsal vertebrae; these pierce the crura, the left occasionally passing through the aortic opening, and ultimately in the abdomen, there formino- the semilunar ganglia from which is derived the sofar plexus. The lesser splanchnic are likewise left and right; they are formed by fine filaments from the tenth and eleventh thoracic ganglia; they then pierce the crura, and form in the abdomen the renal plexus. Vena Azygos arises in the abdomen from the as- cendino- lumbar loops which surround the transverse pro- cesses of the vertebra in that region; it passes through the aortic opening on the right side of that vessel, and the thoracic duct; ascends on the rignt side of the pos- terior mediastinum, and at the fourth dorsal vertebra curves forwards over the root of the lung, and enters the descending cava, as that vessel is about to perforate the pericardium, and one inch above its termination. In this course it receives the bronchial, esophageal, and intercostal veins, and is destitute of valves. _ _ Thoracic Duct commences at a dilated reservoir m the cavity of the abdomen, named receptaculum chyii, and its diameter is about equal to a goose-quiU when distended; ascending through the aortic opening, be- tween that vessel and the vena azygos, it enters the pos- terior mediastinum, and passes upwards internal to the vena azygos, and opposite the fourth dorsal vertebra becomes posterior to the oesophagus, pa^««!^^f left extremity of the transverse portion of the arch of tliP aorti above this lying posterior to the ongm of the ft rublvkn artery;'^ the duct occupies a space bounded internally by the left carotid and trachea, externally by the subclavian, posteriorly by the oesopha-- eus andi front by the left vena innommata; passing Upwards as far as the sixth cervical vertebra, it curve. Eward behind the carotid artery, jugular vem, andPOSTERIOR MEDIASTINUM. 503 pneumogastric nerve, crossing over the longus colli, sympathetic nerve, inferior thyroid and vertebral arte- ries, then turning inwards in front of the subclavian ar- tery, it opens into the vein of that name just where it unites with the jugular to form the vena innominata (see Lymphatic System). (Esophagus.—This musculo-membranous tube com- mences at the termination of the pharynx, opposite the body of the fifth cervical vertebra, and extends to the cardiac orifice of the stomach, or a point corresponding to the eleventh dorsal vertebra. It may be examined successively in the neck, thorax, and abdomen. At its commencement the longitudinal muscular fibres are con- nected to a vertical ridge on the back part of the cri- coid cartilage; the mucous membrane also passes from the pharynx to line its internal surface, and the inferior constrictor, which surrounds its external aspect, tends to produce a continuity between the canals. From this the oesophagus passes downwards and to the left, ap- pearing on that side of the trachea at the upper maro-in of the sternum. ^ Relations in the Neck—In front, the trachea and re- current nerves; laterally, the thyroid body, inferior ar- teries of that name, the carotids, particularly that of the left side, and the thoracic duct; Avhile posteriorly it lies on the preevertebral fascia which separates it from the longi colli muscles. On entering the thorax the tube approaches the middle line lying behind the arch of the aorta, the trachea, however, intervening in thig position. On the left side it supports the left subcla- vian artery, and opposite the third dorsal vertebra it lies on the right side of the descending aorta, crossed in this situation by the left bronchus, left pulmonary ar- tery and veins, and is supported by the spine; it now gradually alters its position, crossing the thoracic aorta from right to left, and lying behind the pericardium; then passes through the (Esophageal opening in the dia- [phragm, anterior and to the left side of the aorta. In the posterior mediastinum the pneumogastric nerves are attached to its surface, forming the plexus gula3; the I left vagus lying anterior and to the left side, the right504 CAVITY OF THE CHEST. to the posterior and right side; these unite by cross or oblique branches, constituting the plexus before alluded to The oesophagus, having entered tlie cavity of the abdomen, should now be examined in that situation which may be accomplished by raising the left lobe and lateral ligament of the liver, as these form its anterior relations! posteriorly it corresponds to the left crus of the diaphragm, left phrenic artery, and occasionally to the semilunar ganglion of the sympathetic. The abdo- minal portion of the tube is from l^alf-an-inch to one inch and a half in length, and becomes dilated as it en- ters the stomach, midway between the sr^enic end and lesser curvature, but a little nearer to the former. When the stomach is distended it forms a very obtuse angle with the lesser ciirvature, and one equally acute with the great end, these angles being less evident when the organ is collapsed. The pneumogastnc nerves still pre- se?ve a similar relation to the tube, and m addition, the ascending branch of the coronaria ventriculi lies on its internal and anterior part. . rr Structure of the (Esophagus.-lt consists of four coats -fibrous, muscular, subfibrous, and mucous.

It will bePOSTERIOR MEDIASTINUM. 505 served that the oesophageal muscular tunic constitutes an example of the insensible transition from the volun- tary to the involuntary class of muscular fibre. Mucous Membrane—This is thick and pale, con- trastmg m colour with the gastric and pharyngeal por- tions; its external surface is rough, and covered by lax areolar tissue, the fibrous framework of which is thin and weak, adhering more intimately to the muscular coat than to the mucous membrane. The internal sur- face is wrinkled, and presents from ten to fifteen lono-i- tudinal phcffi or folds, which terminate at the cardfac orifice of the stomach in projecting fringes; a dense epi- thelium, by some described as a cuticular layer, covers the free aspect, and this can be raised by subjecting the membrane to the action of an acid; it appears to termi- nate m the festoons at the cardiac orifice; but this is only apparent, as it is continued through the whole ali- ■ mentary canal, although with altered anatomical cha- racters. Organization or Vascular Supply This is derived from the inferior thyroid arteries in the neck, aorta in the thorax, and coronaria ventriculi in the abdomen- the veins openmg into the inferior thyroid, mammarv' cava, and azygos, and in the abdomen into the Gastric and phrenic. The lymphatics open into the glands which surround the tube, and the nerves are derived from the pneumogastric. ?75e.—The oesophagus urges and transmits the food to the stomach. The Thoracic Aorta commences opposite to the lower edge of the body of the third dorsal vertebra at most m the mesian line, and descends on the anterior surface of the spine to the tenth dorsal, where, incSg towards the left side and projecting towards the cavity of the lef pleura, it enters the aortic canal to become abdominal. It is covered anteriorly by the lower edee oftheroot ofthe left lung, pericardium, heart' tfo- phagus, and pneumogastric nerves, and lies on the sninp anterior vaginal ligament, left intercostal veins and vena azygos minor; to its left side are the left lung and pleura, and to the right vena azygos major, with the thoracic duct. In the mediastinum the aJrt , gives off506 CAVITY OF THE CHEST. ten intercostals on the left, and nine on the right, which pass backwards and outwards to reach the intercostal spaces; it also gives off bronchial and cesophageal branches. The superior intercostal of the subclavian enters the cavity of the chest in front of the neck of the first rib and communicans dorsalis nerve, to supply the superior spaces. Vena Azygos Minor.—Not always present; com- mences in the abdomen from the ascending lumbar vein of theleft side, pierces the left crus, enters the posterior me- diastinum, receives the five inferior intercostal veins, crosses the spine opposite the sixth dorsal vertebra be- hind the aorta, and opens into the great azygos. The left greater and lesser splanchnics are similar to those on the right side. , j r The present opportunity may be selected for exa- mining the trachea, or air-tube, which will be facili- tated by drawing the heart and pericardium towards the left side, then removing any areolar tissue and glands between it and the aorta, its course will be sufficiently exposed It commences at the lower margin ot the cricoid cartilage, and descends almost vertically as low as the third dorsal vertebra, where it bifurcates into ritrht and left bronchi. -, • i ^ i Eelations.-lt lies on the oesophagus and right longus colli, and is covered anteriorly by the middle lobe of the thyroid body, descending thyroid yems, middle ar- tery of that name, when such a branch exists, sterno- thvroid and hyoid muscles, left vena mnommata, ar- teriainnominata, left carotid, remains of thymus gland, transverse portion of the arch of the aorta, descending cava, and superior part of the pericardium. It is related on each side to the inferior laryngeal nerves which lie in a groove between it and the oesophagus, inferior thyroid arteries, and the lateral lobes of the thyroid body, with the carotids and arteria innominata. Structurc-lt consists of seventeen to twenty-one rines each forming about three-fourths of a circle; but S prolonged they would rather describe an oval figure.

The first and last rings present some peculiarities, the former sometimes being complete, and united to the cricoid cartilage, into which it ascends during expiration in the generality of instances, and as life advances partak- ing in those structural ossific changes to which the la- ryngeal cartilages are so prone. This perfect annular condition is natural in the bird tribe, being likewise os- seous, even to the fourth ring. The latter or last ring is triangular, the base above, the apex inferiorly, corre- sponding to the angle of bifurcation, the base supe- riorly connected to the penultimate cartilage, the lateral margins being cut off obliquely downwards and inwards, and presenting an aspect directed downwards and out- wards, to which the primary rings of the bronchi are attached. We have sometimes seen this divided into two lateral and a central prismatic portion, as if it was the type of a compound structure, composed of three minor rings; but it has never appeared to us as a per- fect circle, or even the seat of osseous deposits, the existence of such a form and structure being rather drawn from analogy than founded on observation; and when we reflect on the peculiar function performed by the inferior larynx in birds as a producer and modula- tor of sounds, and then contrast it with the bifurcation of the human trachea, and the offices it sustains, we at once become cognizant of the necessity for a dense and sonorous material in the former, and the inutility of a similar structure in the latter. The posterior surface ot the trachea for about one-fourth is composed of several structures; from within outwards we observe hrstly, mucous membrane; secondly, tracheal glands' thirdly, elastic tissue; and fourthly, transverse mus- cular fibres (Reiseissen). Mucous Membrane—This is pale on the surface of the cartilaginous rings, but of a rose colour in their in- tervals, and is with difficulty removed from the subjacent parts, the epithelial covering belonging to the ciliated va- riety. Through the mucous layer the elastic tissue appears, consisting of vertical fibres, in front and late- rally being interrupted by their attachment to the508 CAVITY OF THE CHEST. rings, but posteriorly forming a continuous, well-marked layer, separated from the mucous lining by a stratum of mucois glands about the size of millet seeds, which open on the free surface of the trachea. The muscular Hbres which form the fourth layer are confined m the trachea to theintervalsbetweentherings;theycommence posteriorly beneath the cricoid cartilage and are con- tinued down to the bronchial tubes, their direction being transverse, and the extremities attaclied to the terminal pomts of the tracheal rings; but we have seen them con- tinued for a short distance on their surfaces as if exhi- biting a tendency to that arrangement, which is normal n thf smaller br'ouchial tubes. Thesefabres belongto the involuntary or non-striped system, their use appearing to be that of diminishing the diameter of the trachea he elastic fibres having a similar effect on the length of the tube They no doubt exercise no inconsiderable °ni enceTn the production of spasmodic diseases of the a 1 pa saVes, and indeed in several cases where the sub- i ct had died labouring under chronic bronchitis, we have seen them nearly equalling in thickness similar muscles of an ox.

The pericardium is a sero-fibro-serous sac, which contains the heart and great vessels, conical in shape; the base below, attached to the diaphragm'at its central tendinous portion, and also to the fleshy fibres of the left leaf for a short extent; from the former it may be detached as a distinct layer in the foetus, while in the adult the adhesion is rather intimate posteriorly, but quite inseparable anteriorly, or towards the ster- num ; the apex superiorly is prolonged on the great vessels, becoming continuous with the fascia of the neck: laterally it corresponds to the concave surfaces of the lungs and their roots, in front to the sternum in the centre, from which, however, it is separated by cellular tissue, also on the left side to the cartilages of the fifth, sixth, and sometimes seventh rib, with the intervention of the left lung, which, being notched at the thin anterior border, permits a portion of the peri- cardium to become superficial in the space between the fifth and sixth ribs. The phrenic nerves, with the ar- terias comites nervi phrenici, lie between the pleural investment and the fibrous layer, while posteriorly it is related to the posterior mediastinum and its contents. The Pericardium consists of three distinct struc- tures: first, a serous layer, derived from the pleura, which is only a partial investment, deficient in a nar- row space anteriorly and posteriorly; also at the base, where the fibrous layer is attached to the diaphragm, as well as in those positions where vessels enter and leave. The fibrous layer by its superficial surface is attached to the pleura, but rather loosely, some fat often intervening in old subjects, and by its deep sur- face It IS intimately connected with the serous pericar- dium. In the adult nine perforations occur in its struc- ture,—one for the aorta, two for the cav^, a similar number for the right and left pulmonary arteries, and four for the pulmonary veins, an additional perforation existing m the foetus, constituting a tenth for the duc- tus arteriosus. These openings are undefined, in con- sequence of a process from the sac being prolonged on their coats as they enter and leave towards their differ- ent destinations. Now lay open the sac by a crucial incision on the anterior surface; internally it presents510 CAVITY OF THE CHEST. a smooth and glistening surface, being lined by a proper serous layer, which, like other membranes of the same class, forms a shut sac, and consists of a parietal and visceral portion, with a perfect continuity of structure subsisting between them. This membrane may be traced upwards on the posterior surface of the anterior wall of the fibrous pericardium, from which it is re- flected on the three great vessels at the base of the heart, inclosing the aorta and pulmonary artery m a common sheath—complete anteriorly and posteriorly, but deb- cient where these vessels are in contact, a circunistance accounted for by the fact, that they originally formed but a single trunk, the subsequent development of sep- tal wall producing the division into the distinct aorta and pulmonary artery, from an inch and a half to two inches of both vessels being inclosed within the serous sheath. The superior cava is covered only on the an- terior and right side, but not posteriorly; and this in- vestment only extends for one inch of the vessel, or to that point where the vena azygos opens into its cavity. It may then be carried over the anterior surface of the heart down to its apex, round that point to its poste- rior surface, covering the inferior cava and the pulmo- nary veins on the anterior and lateral surfaces, but not posteriorly, then up to the posterior surface of the Lrta and pulmonary artery, from this to the pericar- dium, and round its posterior part to the base, then to the anterior surface to the point where the description commenced. Three saccules are seen AVithm the pen- cardium,_one corresponding to the space behind the aorta and pulmonary artery, transversely oval ; t^^^^^^^^^ being placed behind the left auricle; and the third m the situation occupied by the apex of the heart.

Let the student now pro- ceed with the dissection of the heart. The Heart is a muscular organ contained within the pericardium, consisting of four cavities, namely,—two auricles, and a similar number of ventricles, the former occupying the superior portions, the latter the inferior, constituting the greater part of the organ. It is of a triangular figure, the base above, the apex below, but situated obliquely, so that its axis would be represented by a line passing from the cartilage of the second rib obliquely downwards, forwards, and towards the left costal cartilage, or the interval between fifth and sixth, occupying a space corresponding to the right margin of the sternum, the whole width of that bone, and the car- tilages of the third, fourth, and fifth ribs of the left side in front, and the bodies of the fifth, sixth, and seventh dorsal vertebrfE posteriorly. It has been likewise sub- divided into sides, a single auricle and ventricle apper- taining to each. In the lower animals these may be cor- rectly described as right and left, but in man, although a similar nomenclature has been adopted, it is certainly inaccurate, and should be consequently exploded, as the cavities lie rather anterior and posterior, the former being synonymous with the right, the latter with the left side of the older authors. However, we prefer to adopt the names derived from the function which each performs: thus, the right or anterior side, inasmuch as It propels the venous blood through the vascular sys- tem of the lungs, should be called pulmonary or venous chamber, and the left or posterior side, that urges the blood through the whole arterial system, may be de- scribed as the systemic or arterial. As the organ lies obliquely within the pericardium, it presents three sur- faces and two edges: the anterior surface, convex and triangular, looks forwards, and is marked by a median vertical furrow, which divides it into two unequal por- tions; of these the right ventricle forms three-fourths, the remainder being constituted by the left. The pos-512 CAVITY OF THE CHEST. terior and inferior surface, resting on the cordiform ten- don of the diaphragm, is flat, and also divided by a con- tinuation of the median furrow, but here the formative relations are reversed, the left ventricle constituting three-fourths of its extent, and the right the remainder. The right edge is thin and sharp, convex superiorly, straight inferiorly, resting on the diaphragm; the left is exceedingly thick, round, and convex, being almost perpendicular, and resting in a concavity of the_ left lung, of course with the intervention of the pericardium. The third surface corresponds to the base of the ventri- cular portion of the heart, looks upwards, backwards, and towards the right side, surrounded by a furrow which marks the limit between the auricles and ventri- cles ; this furrow contains some fat with the coronary vessels, producing a deceptive appearance as to depth; but by removing the fat the muscular fibres of the ven- tricles are seen to turn inwards as far as the auricular tendinous rings, an arrangement more obvious poste- riorly than anteriorly. Attached to the base of the ven- tricles are two vessels and two cavities; of the former the pulmonary arterial zone is most anterior, the aortic posterior and a little to the left side, whilst the auricu- lar rings occupy a still more posterior plane, and are moulded on the back part and sides of the aortic. Ihe base of the ventricles present an oblique plane, being cut off from above, downwards, and backwards, so that the anterior surface of the heart exceeds the posterior in length by nearly an inch and a quarter; but although this disparity exists in the surfaces, we will find here- after that both ventricles are nearly of equal extent in the vertical direction. The student should now exa- mine the configuration of the auricular portion oi the orcran. These two cavities are situated on the back part of the ventricular base, and are of an hour-g ass figure, the anterior surface being prominent on each side, but excavated in the centre, where it corresponds to the Dosterior part of the aorta and pulmonary artery, while on each side it presents the right and left auricular ap- pendices-long, narrow, muscular cylinders serrated L thSr margins, curved forwards on the right side, but situated mo?e posteriorly on the left, the former rest-HEART. 513 z 3 ing against the side of the aorta and cava, and the latter against that of the pulmonary artery; while the posterior surface is convex, and marked by a vertical furrow continuous with that between the ventricles, and indicates the situation of the septum auricularum; to its left are seen the terminations of the four pulmo- nary veins, and to the right the two cavse, and the great coronary vein. This surface corresponds to the oesopha- gus, aorta, and spine. The weight of the heart averages from seven to eight ounces. In the adult the blood takes the following course in its pulmonary and systemic circulation:—Collected by the superior, inferior cavse, and great coronary veins, it passes into the right auricle, from which it is urged into the right ventricle, through the right auriculo-ven- tricular opening; from thence propelled through the pulmonary artery,- traversing the pulmonary capillaries, and there undergoing the requisite change from venous to arterial, it is returned by the pulmonary veins to the left auricle, then through the left auriculo-ventricular opening into the left ventricle, and from this cavity it issues by the aorta to ramify through the entire arterial system. Eight Auricle—This is of a conical figure, the apex above a,t the auricular appendix, the base inferiorly at the auriculo-ventricular opening. In order to examine Its cavity make an incision on the posterior wall, from the superior cava to a quarter of an inch above the infe- rior; then carry a second forwards from the last; re- flect the flaps and sponge the cavity, so as to remove any coagulated blood which obscures the several parts on Its walls. The openings into the right auricle are se- ven,—namely, superior and inferior cavse, auriculo-ven- tricular, cofonary veins, one, two, or three in number a small aperture at the superior part of the fossa ovalis,' the opening of communication between the appendix and sinus of the auricle; and lastly, a number of small openings (foramina Thebesii), which are seen principally on the posterior wall. At the highest point of the pos- terior wall the opening of the superior cava is observed • this vessel commences at the upper margin of the car- tilage of the second rib on the right side, formed by the514 CAVITY OP THE CHEST. confluence of the right and left venae innominate; it passes downwards, inwards, and a little forwards, pierces the pericardium obliquely, and reaches the posterior and superior part of the auricle, into which it opens. In its course it lies on the trachea and root of the right lung, the phrenic nerve being anterior, and to its right side with the pneumogastric posteriorly-, internally it lies to the right side of the aorta, towards which it pre- sents a concavity; the auricular orifice looks a little backwards and inwards, being circular and smooth, a perfect continuity subsisting between the fibrous wall of the vein and the areolo-fibrous subserous layer of the auricle, and in addition to this the serous membrane on the external surface of the heart, bemg reflected over the anterior and right side of the vein, whilst the Immg membrane of the auricle (endocardium), which likewise belongs to the class of serous membranes, is prolonged into the venous cylinder. Beneath the opening of the superior cava a projecting lip of thickened muscular tis- sue is observed, but this is by no means invariably pre- sent- it is called tuberculum Loweri, and separates the two caval openings. The projection ot the auricular wall in this situation has been attributed to the meetmg of the currents of blood entering from the superior and inferior cav^, also to the passage of the right pulmonary v7ns behind'the auricular wall impinging on the ca- vity; and lastly, to the existence of a portion of fat very frequently observed in this situation, particularly in old subiects! Beneath this the mterior cava orifice is s en c reular in figure, and much larger than the superior; this vein commences on the right side ot the body of he fifth lumbar vertebra by the confluence o the common iliac; in its course, on the right side of the spineTt'eceives the lumbar, right spermatic renal, and hemtic veins, then passes through the tendmous and TnS ualeral opening in the diaphragm, and, entering ttrtiLa diuX it bends almost horizontally towards u S .Tde openino- into the posterior and inferior part '^ttr^^t^u^^o near Z corresponding aperture :;t:^.eriorc^,tl.t^eir^^^ :^;e:^^r m be —n^^o examine the EustachianHEART. 515 valve, a structure which in the adult subject is merely rudimentary, appearing in the majority of cases reticu- lated and imperfect. It is semilunar in figure, and com- posed of a duplicature of the serous endocardium placed before, above, and to the right side of the caval orifice; it presents for description a concave and convex margin, and a superior and inferior cornu. The concave edge is free, looking upwards, backwards, and to the right side; the convex margin lies below, and is attached to a horizontal groove between the caval orifice and the anterior wall of the auricle; the superior cornu, narrow and prolonged, is connected to the anterior or left lip of the fossa ovalis, being sometimes continued round that depression to the posterior lip; the inferior cornu, wider than the last described, is united to the anterior edge of the inferior cava, with the lining membrane of which vessel it is perfectly continuous. This valve is of use in fcetal life in directing the current from the cava into the left auricle through the foramen ovale; but we will again recur to this subject when speaking . of the foramen Botalli. Inferior and to the left side of the caval opening, the auricle presents a triangular fa- cette, marked strongly with reticulated muscular fibres, and at the deepest part of the depression a small valve (valvula Thebesii) indicates the position of the orifice of the coronary vein, lying at the posterior and inferior part of the auricle. The coronary veins consist of greater and lesser, the former commencing in the anterior inter- ventricular furrow, above the apex of the heart; it first ascends, then turns backwards and towards the left side, between the left auricle and ventricle, to the pos- terior part; here it receives a branch from the posterior interventricular furrow, and becomes expanded into the great coronary venous sinus, and ultimately the con- tinued trunk pierces the posterior wall of the auricle, where it terminates. The valve situated at the orifice is often absent and always imperfect; nor can it be of much utility in preventing regurgitation, because the opening, being situated in a muscular part of the auricle, the contraction of the surrounding fibres must neces- sarily obviate regurgitation during the systole of that cavity. The existence of the sinus is conceived by someCAVITY OF THE CHEST. 516 physiologists to favour the opinion of systolic regurgi- tation, but this dilatation serves merely as a reservoir for the venous blood during the contraction of the au- ricle. The smaller coronary veins are three or four in number, and open into the anterior and inferior part of the auricle. AuRicuLO-VENTRicuLAR OPENING.—This communica- tion between the auricle and ventricle is oval in figure, being one inch and a quarter in its antero-posterior measurement, and one inch in the transverse; its mar- gin, round and smooth, exhibits a dull white colour in consequence of the tendinous auricular zone being merely covered in this situation by serous membrane; and on passing up the septum we observe the vestige of a foetal opening represented by the fossa ovalis; this is most frequently seen as a depression, surrounded by an incomplete annulus, and this depression or fossa may be membranous and smooth, or covered by a stratum of muscular tissue, closing the original aperture like a plug, or the surface may be invested by reticulated muscular columns, or lastly, there may be a single fleshy column at its inferior segment, which is then like- wise attached to the Eustachian valve. The annulus ovalis consists of a fleshy lip, which surrounds three- fourths of the fossa, being deficient posteriorly and in- feriorly; of its two pillars or limbi one is placed anterior and to the left side, the other posterior and to the right, and if a probe is passed beneath the upper edge, a small oblique aperture will be discovered in the generality of instances, forming a communication between the auri- cles, the peculiar valvular arrangement, however, obviat- ino-'any attempt at admixture of the blood of the right and left cavities. In foetal life the blood passed directly through this space, which was then patent, into the left auricle, the Eustachian valve prolonging the cylinder of the cava towards that point. It is incorrect to say, that the Eustachian valve diminishes during any period of foetal life, its growth being continuous up to the ninth month, a condition perfectly consistent with and requisite to the function of this structure. The me- chanism by which the closure of the foramen of Bqtal is accomplished may be thus explained :_from the poste-HEART. 517 rior and inferior part of its circumference a semilunar fold of membrane projects at the fourth month of foetal life; in many cases we have observed a distinct mus- cular stratum contained within this duplicature of the endocardium, and as gestation advances, this valve (oper- culum foraminis ovalis) increases until it attains suffi- cient magnitude to occlude the opening perfectly, but still, being placed on the left side of the foramen, it allows the current to pass from right to left, whilst it presents an effectual barrier to its passage in a contrary direction. The patency of the interauricular septum after birth constitutes merely a link in the chain of patho- logical conditions producing cyanosis. (See Dr. Mayne's paper in the Dublin Quarterly Journal, Feb., 1848.) The auricular appendix is a fleshy saccule of variable lengths, curved forwards and inwards, so as partially to conceal the superior cava and aorta; its margins are notched and serrated, and internally the surface is reti- culated, fine muscular fibres crossing it in every direc- tion, often so loosely attached that a probe can be passed beneath them; and it communicates with the auricle by a circular constricted orifice. In addition to the muscu- lar fibres already described, others, round and semi-at- tached, run from the orifice of the appendix downwards on the right side of the superior cava, as low as the auriculo-ventricular opening; and these from their form and direction may be named musculi pectinati. We have already alluded to the third position within the auricle that possesses well-marked muscular character m the description of the coronary vein and its facette. Foramina Thebesii are a number of small openings, prin- cipally seen on the superior and posterior wall of the auricle; these were conceived to be the orifices of the small veins of Vieussens, but without any foundation, being merely involutions of the lining membrane. In order to dissect the right ventricle, let the anterior wall of that cavity be raised from belowto within half-an- mch of the auriculo-ventricular groove, and on examin- ing its shape it is found to be triangular, the base'above, the apex below, and terminating above the point of the heart. Within the cavity are seen the following parts- Carney colunina;, chordaj tendinete, tricuspid valves'518 CAVITY OF THE CHEST. auriculo-ventricular opening, and the origin of the pul- monary artery. Carney Columns These are smooth, fleshy bands, on the internal surface of the ventricle, consisting of three sets: the first, which are the more numerous, be- ing attached by their extremities and free in the centre; they cross the surface in every conceivable direction, producing that reticulated appearance known as the cavernous structure of the right ventricle—a character more evident on the anterior wall and apex than on the septum; the second set, larger, ilatter, and less nu- merous, are attached to the wall of the ventricle by one surface in its whole extent; these we have seen most frequently on the septum, whilst a flat, strong band, described by Mr. T. W. King, also passes backwards and towards the right side, attached in front to the an- terior and behind to the septal wall of the cavity; it will at once be observed that this muscular fasciculus not only draws the anterior wall towards the septum but likewise urges the blood with much energy into the arterial outlet; the third set of fleshy columns are called musculipappillares, wide, thick, and exceedingly strong; they are attached by one extremity to the wall of the ventricle, and by the second to the chordae tendmes, which again connect them to the valves. CHORDiE Tendine^.—These are fine, threadlike fibres, surrounded by a serous layer, white, glistenmg and sil- very they are attached by one extremity to the fleshy columns, and by the second to the margins ot the valves, being prolonged on their surface (external) as far as the auricular opening, but occasionally we have seen mus- cular fibres continued on the surface ol the cords even to their valvular attfichment. . j Tricuspid VALVES.-Three in number, are situated within the ventricle formed by a double layer of the serous lining of the heart with an intervening fibrous stratum • of these, one is anterior and right, the second poster^;, and the third to the left side; each valve pre- sents eTther a quadrilateral or irregularly triangular rare with twolmrgins, and a similar number ot sur- Stthe superior inargin is attached to ^^^^ --^^^^^^ tendinous zone, from which a process is continued be519 HEART. tween the folds of serous tissue that compose it; the second or inferior edge being comparatively free, and receiving the attachment of the chordae tendinese, which are connected not only to the free edge but are also con- tinued on the external surface of the valve to its attach- ment. The anterior or right, as well as the left valves, are attached to a thick fleshy band connected to the anterior wall of the ventricle, whilst the posterior, smaller than the last, and more fixed, is attached to the septal wall by chordae tendineaj only. The left valve is generally described as separating the auricular and ar- terial openings (septum of Lieutaud), and so preventing the escape of the blood into the pulmonary artery until the ventricle is fully distended, but this assertion is perfectly gratuitous; firstly, because the distance of fully three-quarters of an inch intervenes between the openings; secondly, because the pulmonary artery is in its systolic movement with the semilunar valves thrown down at the moment the ventricle is being filled; and the third objection, the most important, being that the wide portion of the valve does not separate the openings, but is much more anterior, the narrow posterior edge only intervening between them. Mr. King has attri- buted a very important function to the anterior valves both left and right; these being attached by their free margins to the anterior or moveable wall of the ventri- cle, it follows, that during excessive distention they are prevented from accurately closing the auricular openino-, thus permitting regurgitation to ensue, and obviating that paralysis which would necessarily result from over- distention. The origin of the pulmonary artery occurs from the anterior superior and left side of the base of the right ventricle, that cavity being prolonged upwards at this point as the infundibuliform process (the arterial por- tion of the ventricle). It is usual to describe the inner surface of this tubule as smooth, but that character is only present on the septal portion, while anteriorly it is marked by reticulated fibres. The infundibulum is separated from the auricular opening by a thick, tumid lip of muscular tissue with its concavity directed down-520 CAVITY OP THE CHEST. wards, and from the aortic opening by the superior part of the septum, which is thin but strong; occa- sionally a congenital deficiency existing in this situa- tion allowing the pulmonary artery and aorta to com- municate, and becoming a cause of cyanosis; superiorly the infundibulum is terminated by a tendinous annulus, to the upper edge of which the pulmonary artery is attached by three convex roots, composed of the fibrous coat of the vessel, these being implanted into the ten- dinous ring, whilst on the other hand triangular pro- cesses of the latter are prolonged into the spaces between the roots. In addition to this, the lining membrane of the heart is continued into the vessel, forming at its orifice three semilunar or sigmoid valves, which are attached by their convexities to the margins of the roots, the concavities free, looking from the heart, and containing in the centres each a small nodule of fibrous tissue (corpus Arantii vel sesamoideum). To these latter several uses have been assigned, namely, to keep the valve apart from the wall of the vessel, so that during its contraction the blood may insinuate itself with greater ease between it and the valve; also to close a small triangular space that exists when the valves are opposed, as well as to confer on them increased strength and resistance. These valves are composed of a repli- cation or fold of the serous endocardium, with an inter- vening fibrous layer derived from the tendinous ring, their "use being to prevent reflux of blood from the artery into the ventricle, an action which is purely me- chanical. The pulmonary artery from its origin passes at first upwards and forwards, then backwards and towards the left side, curving round the anterior and left side ot the aorta, and after a course of about two inches it di- vides into right and left branches, which pass, one to each lung As it ascends it is covered in front by the serous layer of the pericardium, which serves to connect it to the heart, and here sometimes a deficiency exists be- tween the aorta and this vessel near their roots, some- what resembling in arrangement similar parts in the Crocodilus Lucius. The blood, having undergone the requisite change from venous to arterial in the lungs, isHEART. 521 returned by the pulmonary veins into the left auricle of the heart, to which the attention of the student may be now directed. Left Auricle is placed on a plane posterior, in- ferior, and to the leftside of the right; it is some- what of a cuboid figure, corresponding behind to the pulmonary veins; superiorly and posteriorly to the au- ricular appendix; anteriorly and on the right side to the septum and groove for the aorta and pulmonary artery; inferiorly to the auriculo-ventricular opening, with the circular furrow containing the left coronary artery, and the great vein of the same name. It appears smaller than the right, than which its coats are thicker and deeper in colour, being, however, one-fifth less in capa- city. In order to dissect the cavity an incision should be made vertically on the anterior wall, between the appendix (at its root) and the aorta; a second cut, of smaller extent, backwards and towards the left side, will further facilitate the examination of the cavity; on its walls are observed seven openings, namely: four pul- monary veins, orifice of the appendix, oblique aperture at the summit of the fossa ovalis, and lastly, the auri- culo-ventricular opening. Pulmonary Veins.—These are four in number, two for the right, and a similar set for the left lung; the former at first consist of three trunks, corresponding to the superior middle and inferior lobes, but the superior and middle unite after a short course, so that at the root of the lung there are only two: those on the left side, consisting only of two branches, pass towards the right, piercing the pericardium, and receiving a cover- ing of serous membrane on the anterior surface from Its lining, then pierce the posterior and left angle of the auricle. Without the pericardium they lie on the left bronchus, and within that bag on the descending aorta. The right pass towards the left side, also pierc- ing the pericardium, and receiving a serous layer on the anterior surface; they then perforate the posterior and right angle of the auricle; and lie on the right pulmonary artery and oesophagus, and behind the de- scending cava, right auricle, and descending aorta. These veins do not possess valves, and at their auricu-CAVITY OF THE CHEST. 522 lar extremities a mutual interchange of anatomical ele- ments occurs, the muscular tissue of the auricle being prolonged on that portion of the vessels within the pericardium, vfhilst the venous structure enters into the formation of the auricular walls. On the septum auricularum, which is convex in this cavity, the small oblique communication between the auricles is_ gene- rally observed, but without any annulus, as in the right. The opening of the appendix is small and cir- cular, leading into a conical cavity, in which the mus- cular fibres are well marked; the margins of the ap- pendix, which is longer and narrower than that on the right side, are very closely serrated, and, curving for- wards, it overlaps the pulmonary artery and aorta, although its root is at the upper and back part of the auricle. The left auriculo-ventricular opening is circu- lar, smaller than that on the right side, but, like that orifice, surrounded by a tendinous zone, and it leads into the left ventricle. The Left Ventricle will be exposed by raising the septum ventriculorum from apex to base. In general terms it may be said that this cavity is conical, pro- jecting below the right, so as to form the apex of the heart, but superiorly the latter cavity ascends above it. The walls of the left ventricle are much thicker than those of the right, and within it we observe carnea3 columns, chordae tendinese, mitral valves, and auricular orifice, with the origin of the aorta. The CARNEiE Columns are of three orders, as in the right: those attached to the tendinous threads of the mitral valves being usually two in number, round and thick, where they arise from the ventricular wall, digi- tate or divided at the point of connexion with the tendons; the reticulated fibres are few in comparison with those on the right side, and do not produce that peculiar cavernous structure so remarkable m the latter situation. , ^ • i „ The Septum is concave towards the ventricular ca- vity, somewhat smooth, the fleshy bands which lie on its surface being flat and attached by their whole extent. The Mitral Valves are two in number one being placed anteriorly, the other posteriorly; the former, the523 HEART. larger, attached to the anterior half segment of the auricular zone, separating the aortic from the aurictilo- ventricular opening, about two lines intervening be- tween them; the posterior, smaller and more fixed, connected above to the posterior half segment of the auricular zone; the inferior margins of both right and left receiving the attachment of numerous chordse ten- dinea?. These valves, particularly the anterior, are much stronger than the tricuspid, and are also more calcu- lated accurately to close the mitral opening, and thus prevent regurgitation. The aorta arises from the su- perior, anterior, and left side of the base of the left ven- tricle, which appears to be divided into two portions by the anterior mitral valve, an anterior or arterial, and a posterior or auricular portion, as it receives the blood from that cavity. The arterial division is bounded anteriorly and to the right side by the septum, which m this situation presents a smooth surface; posteriorly and to the left side by the anterior mitral valve; and superiorly by the aortic tendinous annulus. This ring receives externally and inferiorly the ventricular mus"^ cular fibres; and superiorly it presents three concavities, with intervening triangular elevations; the former, the convex roots of the aorta, are connected to the latter, occupying the spaces between them. This opening, like that of the pulmonary artery, presents three semi- lunar valves, for the purpose of obviating regurgitation, but these will be fully described with the arch of the aorta (see Arterial System). The Muscular Tissue of the Heart appertains to the involuntary system, and although wholly removed from the control of volition, it still presents, however some peculiarities which seem to ally its structure to the voluntary system; thus, it is thick, firm, and re- sisting, of a deep red colour, the fibres presenting a feeble striation, and attached to tendinous tissue. These peculiarities, though they cannot influence the volitional effect, may provide in a great measure for that ener- getic action which the heart exhibits in a much greater degree than any other muscle of the involuntary class. These muscular fibres may be divided into an-auricular and ventricular system, and in order to examine themCAVITY OF THE CHEST. 524 it will be necessary to fill the heart's cavities with plaster of Paris, and then, carefully removing the serous membrane, the proper tissue is exposed, which may now be unravelled. We have been enabled to demonstrate the cardiac fibres exceedingly well by selecting the heart of an infant, and subjecting it to maceration in a solu- tion of corrosive sublimate and alum, which hardens the muscular fibre, and at the same time renders the separation of the layers extremely easy. This we pre- fer to boiling, a proceeding which produces so great a friability of the fibre, that it becomes almost impossible to preserve the specimen entire even for a short period. The Auriculae Fibres consist of a superficial and deep set, the former being common to both cavities, the lat- ter being distinct appendages to a single auricle, and hence called " proper." The common fibres cover the anterior face of both cavities and the auricular appen- dices, and then sink posteriorly into the median furrow, but not passing into the septum, being strong ante- riorly, and presenting an excavation for the aorta, to which they are attached by areolar tissue. Many de- ficiencies occur in this stratum where vessels enter and leave, particularly posteriorly. It is commonly stated that these fibres arise from the auricular and aortic zones, but by dissecting into the auriculo-ventricular furrow, the intervention of the ventricular fibres will exhibit the fallacy of this view. The Proper Auricular Fibres are attached to the deep and upper edge of the auricular rings, being thicker in the left than the right auricle, in the former situation assuming a circular arrangement, but m the latter crossing in all directions, presenting at many points a well-marked reticulated appearance. The Septal Wall, convex towards the left, and con- cave towards the right side, consists of two muscular planes, that of the left auricle being smooth, whilst that on the right forms by a sudden increase in thickness the incomplete annulus which surrounds the fossa ovalis. By a careful dissection carried through the septum the right may be separated from the left auricle, that por- tion which is proper to the former cavity being much the thicker of the two.HEART. Ventricular Fibres—These consist of a double set like those of the auricles. When the serous layer of the pericardium is removed from the ventricles the most superficial common fibres are observed descending from the auricular zones downwards, forwards, and to°wards the apex, or from right to left on the anterior surface, and on the posterior part running obliquely from left to right, in order to reach the apex. In this situation we observe an anterior and posterior band which wind around each other, producing a stellate disposition at the apex, where they dip into the interior of the ven- tricles to form the inner wall of these cavities, and ascending to be attached to the deep surface and inner edge of the tendinous zones. Thus the superficial sur- face of each ventricular wall, and also the deep, are con- stituted of common fibres, in the interval between them the proper being situated; these latter consist of a mus- cular sac for each ventricle of a conical shape, the base attached superiorly to the auricular zones, the apex in- teriorly presenting a small aperture, through which the common fibres gain access to the internal cavities _ Three layers of muscular fibres have been described m the right ventricle, six in the left; but instead of tracing these individually it will simplify the subiect in some degree to state, that on the external surface of the ventricles common fibres, or, more correctly speak- ing, bands, assume three forms,—the first passing ob- liquely from apex to base, the second surroundin^oth ventricles, and the third describing a double circle in- vesting each cavity, and preserving their continuity !dmi"t^f tV'P'r n ^^""^ fibres afs^ admit of a three-fold arrangement.

In the foregoing account we have merely given a general description of the muscular structure of the heart, as being the only mode applicable to the intricacy of the subject; indeed a sharp knife, scissors, and a pair of needles, will yield to any patient investigator conditions adapted to any description, however complex; a circum- stance perfectly natural, when we recollect that the fibres are united, not by areolar tissue, as in other situa- tions but by a mutual interweaving, which renders the structure almost inextricable. (See Searle, m Todd's Encyclopedia, page 168.) _ Development of the Heart—This organ at its earliest period is visible as a pulsatile speck, the "punctum saliens of Harvey." It first consists of a smgle tube formed in the vascular layer of the germinal membrane, receiving the veins at its posterior extremity, and the arteries emanating from its anterior; subsequently it becomes curved into a loop, presenting three saccules, arterial or ventricular, venous or auricular and the bulbus aorts, a dilatation at the extremity of that vessel. About the fourth week the septum ventriculorum com- mences to be developed from below upwards, or from apex to base, and is completed about the eighth. Ibe septum auricularum is developed from the superior and anterior part, but remains deficient at the foramen ovale until birth. The Eustachian valve is an early structural formation, being sufiicient at the third month to conceal the inferior caval orifice, and at this period the proper valve or membrane of the foramen becomes visible, and it is stated that now the valves grow in an inverse ratio, or that the Eustachian diminishes as the septal increases. We have before stated that such a change is functionally impossible, nor has such a law ever been satisfactonly proved by the only unerring test-demonstration.

The action of the heart is to propel the blood through the vascular system, exercising a pressure on that fluid equivalent to a weight of four pounds three ounces. The external manifestations of its contractions consist of an impulse, a first sound followed by a second, and lastly, an interval. The impulse is caused by the apex of the heart striking against the space between the cartilages of the fifth and sixth -ribs. This occurs during the systole or contraction of the ventricles, and has been attributed to several causes, namely, 1o the propulsion of the blood into the curved arch of the aorta, and the consequent tendency of that tube being to assume the straight position, tilts forwards the apex of the heart (Hunter, Senac); also to the fact, that the posterior fibres of the right ventricle are shorter than the anterior, and the latter, contracting one-third of their length^ curve the apex forwards; it has likewise been accounted for by the spiral direction of the fibres, as well as by the dilatation of the ventricles. The first sound is some- what dull and prolonged, and is conceived to arise from the sudden tension of the mitral and tricuspid valves (Dr. Billing). Again, others believe that it is produced by the contraction of the ventricles (Williams), regard- ing it as a muscular sound, but these views are, how- ever, open to objections. The second sound is more sharp and abrupt in its character, being caused by the flapping of the aortic valves (Dublin Committee, Hope) If the penod occupied by the first and second sounds with the interval, is divided into four parts, the first would occupy two, the second and the interval one each. The heart at each contraction propels from one ounce and a half to two ounces into the systemic cir- culation, so that taking the whole mass of the blood as being on an average about twenty-eight pounds, it would pass through the heart in a period of from three to four minutes, but the rapidity of the contraction of the orean will materially aflFect this estimate, and it is on this ac-528 CAVITY OF THE CHEST. count necessary to become acquainted with the varia- tions, which are mainly influenced by the period oi lite.

On these muscles branches of the omohyoid plexus descend to supply their origins, each being in- vested by a thin layer of fascia; beneath these the left and right vena innominatee are disclosed, the left vena innominata being from two and a half to three inches in length, commencing opposite to the sterno-clavicular articulation by the union of the left jugular and sub- clavian veins, passes obliquely towards the right side, and at the upper edge of the cartilage of the second rib lorms the descending cava by its confluence with the right. In this course it presents a curve, the concavity looking upwards and backwards, and crosses the fol- Wng parts from left to right:—Left internal mam- mary artery and phrenic nerve, left pneumogastric nerve subclavian artery, thoracic duct, left carotid, arch of the aorta, with cardiac nerves, trachea, arteria innominata and right pneumogastric nerve. The parts superficial to It are, the left sterno-clavicular articulation, sternum sterno-hyoid, and thyroid muscles, and the remains of the thymus gland, a layer of fascia also covering and connecting it to the aorta, which ultimately becomes continuous with the fibrous layer of the pericardium- It receives a number of branches in its course, —namely' the descending thyroid, sometimes the left vertebral and superior intercostal, with the internal mammary vein of the left side. The right vena innominata is one inch and a halt m length, commencing opposite the rio-ht sterno-clavicular articulation, a little higher than the lelt; It passes downwards and inwards, to reach the left at the origin of the cava, corresponding on the ri<.ht side to the lung, pleura, and phrenic nerve; on the ?eft to the origm of the subclavian, from which it is sepa- rated by the pneumogastric nerve; also to the arteria innominata; anteriorly it is covered by the sterno-cla- vicular articulation and cartilage of the first rib also by the remains of the thymus gland, whilst posteriorly It rests on the right wall of the anterior mediastinum and pneumogastric nerve, which is at first internal and subsequently behind it.

A little to the left side of the latter the left carotid ascends, also supported by the trachea, and still more to the left side the subclavian is observed ascending on a plane posterior and external to that vessel; between the carotid and arteria innomi- nata the trachea passes downwards and towards the rieht side lying behind the left vena mnommata and arch of the aorta. The right phrenic nerve enters the chest, passing between the subclavian vein and artery, but the pneumogastric lies between the right vena in- nominata and subclavian artery, crossing tliis^f ^el at right angles, but on the left side lying parallel, but an- terior to it Both phrenics lie at first external, then anterior, and finally internal to the internal mammary arterv, this latter vessel on both sides being covered by the cok-esponding ven^ innomiaat^ as they enter the chest.

These parts will be found fully described with their proper systems. In concluding the anatomy of the chest, we wish to allude briefly to a temporary organ,—the thymus gland, and as it is peculiar to foetal life and infancy, it will be necessary for the student to obtain a very young sub- ject for its examination. The gland consists of two symmetrical triangular lobes, united in the mesian line by areolar tissue, but otherwise perfectly distinct, form- ing a mass of a pyramidal figure, which has the base below, corresponding to the fourth rib, and the apex above, attached to the thyroid body. The posterior surface rests on the pericardium, phrenic nerves, left vena innominata, arch of the aorta, arteria innomi'nata, left carotid and pneumogastric nerve; also on the tra- chea, descending thyroid veins, and middle thyroid ar- teries, while it is covered anteriorly by the sternum, cartUages of the first, second, third, and fourth ribs^ with the deep cervical fascia and sterno-hyoid and thy- roid muscles. At the third month of fa3tal life this organ is small but gradually increases until the eighth; it then becomes suddenly augmented, so that at birth it weighs about 240 grains, or half-an-ounce; and the growth further continues to progress until the termination of the first year. Each lobe contains a cavity, partially separated into a cervical and thoracic saccule by a constriction the former being superior and the smaller of the two' the latter inferior and the larger. These cavities are l^t Vn ""f ,^y'^^^ mucous membrane, and contain a whitish fluid like chyle, with a few red corpuscles Structure.—This consists of a number of follicles ranging m size from a pin's head to a small pea each possessing distinct fibrous walls. They usuall'y are globular or polygonal in figure, being in all cases sur- rounded by a delicate plexus of blood-vessels, which with fibrous tissue, form the medium of connexion with other lobules; their cavities are lined by a prolonga- tion of the general cavitary membrane, some communi- cating with the central reservoirs, others coalescing and afterwards terminating in the former situation,'532 CAVITY OF THE ABDOMEN. their orifices being strewed over the internal sur- face, where a layer of ligamentous bands surrounds them, throwing the lining membrane into ridges or folds When the gland is unravelled by dissection, after being macerated for a short time, each lobe can be drawn out into a straight tube, with the follicles attached to it in a spiral manner. This gland is with- out any special duct, and may therefore be classed with vascular glands connected with the lymphatic system The arteries which supply its structure are derived from the internal mammary and thyroid, while the ef- ferent veins open into the left vena innommata and tny- roid veins. The lymphatics communicate with the junction of the jugular and subclavian veins; and Sir A. Cooper believes them to be the ducts of the gland. The nervous supply is principally derived from the sympathetic system, but we have observed a branch f^om the left phrenic entering its structure. The uses of this organ are involved in some degree of obscurity. Sir A. Cooper thinks that it is connected with the ela- boration of a fcBtal blood from the more vitalized fluid of the mother, while Hewson believed it was the organ flora which the nuclei of the blood corpuscles were eliminated.

Before entering into a description of the individual parts that are found in the abdominal cavity, it will be necessary to take a slight view of the peritoneum, and explain the relation which it holds to the several viscera, both hollow and solid, and how by its peculiar inflec- tions it envelops some only partially, while again, it affords to others a covering which might be sai'd to be all but complete. The Peritoneum is the most extensive serous mem- brane in the whole body. It forms a closed sac, the an- terior part of which is intimately attached to the abdo- minal walls in front and laterally, whilst its posterior, much larger and looser, is folded around the several viscera, which by this arrangement are seen to be com- pletely external to its cavity. In following out its several reflections it is a matter perfectly unimportant where it is commenced; but as the umbilicus has been hitherto assumed as the starting-point, we will adopt the same system, and trace it through its tortuous course, until it is again brought to the same place from which we set out. The incisions already made clearly expose the peri- toneum passing upwards, lining the whole of the ante- rior and lateral walls of the abdomen, and continuing Its course backwards to cover in the concave surface of the diaphragm, as far back as the thick margin of the hver. As it proceeds in this direction it meets with the umbilical vein, around which it forms a falciform fold which on reaching the liver spreads out and becomes continuous with the serous covering of that viscus From the under surface and posterior part of the dia- phragm It 13 now inflected downwards to the upper surface of the liver near its thick border, and, passing forwards over its convexity, it reaches its anterior mar- gin, around which it sweeps to cover in its inferior sur- face as far as the transverse fissure, where its further progress is impeded by the vessels which enter at that part. In order to cover in that portion of the liver that lies behind the fissure, we must now assume a pro- cess, that we will presently account for, sweeping iromCAVITY OF THE ABDOMEN. 534 its thick margin forwards as far as this point, thus pro- ducing two layers of the membrane, one in front and one behind the fissure; these pass downwards, separated from each other, however, by the vessels of the liver, till they reach the concave margin of the stomach, consti- tuting the gastro-hepatic or lesser omentum. At the upper edge of the stomach they diverge,—one passing in front of it, the other behind it, but after inclosing this viscus they again unite at its convex margin and proceed downwards as a double layer, free and floating in front of the viscera, and, arriving at the lower part ot abdomen, they are suddenly inflected upwards and back- wards on themselves, thus forming four layers,—the great omentum. As they now continue their course upwards and backwards, they meet with the transverse colon, which they split to inclose, and again uniting continue their course to the spine,-the transverse meso- colon. Here they are again divided by the inferior transverse portion of the duodenum, which crosses the vertebral column at this point; one layer proceeds di- rectly upwards, the ascending layer of the transverse mesocolon, investing partially the first and second por- tion of the duodenum, the aorta, pancreas, and cava; reaches the back part of the diaphragm, from which it is inflected on the under surface of the l^^^^' ^^/f .^1 the transverse fissure, becoming continuous ^ttl^is point with the process which we assumed ^^^f instituting he posterior layer of the lesser omentum. If we now leturn to the second portion of the transverse mesocolon called its descending layer, we will find that it is attached to the left side of ie body of the second lumbar vei-tebra and to the right ilio-sacral symphysis,--the ™ot ot the mesentery; and from this it sends out a la^^ge pioces which nearly encircles the small intestines, ^^^^n it again returns to it's original attachment the mesen ei y foWs being likewise prolonged into the lumbar ^^S^^^'^^f incr down and partially covering the ascending and de sLVdrng colonsUthe ^ght and left ^^^^^^^^^^ into the Uiac regions, to the Ccnecum ^^^^/^S'^^^^g^^^^^^^^ whicli they likewise incompletely mvest-the hist bcm^ c med thlmesoccum, but tbo latter has received no d^^^^ finite name. If wc now turn the small intestines to theI PERITONEUM. 535 right side, we may observe the descending layer of the transverse mesocolon sweeping over the bifurcation of the aorta, meeting with the rectum, which it completely envelops for its upper third,—the meso-rectum; but as it sinks into the pelvis it gradually abandons this viscus, covering in the sides and front only of its middle third, and ultimately the latter part alone, from which it is reflected on the under and back part of the bladder; leaving a deep depression between it and the rectum,— the recto-vesical poiich. Ascending now over the pos- terior surface of the bladder, it invests it for about one- third of its entire extent, till it arrives at its superior fundus. Here it meets with the urachus and obliterated hypogastric arteries, and, guided upwards by these along the anterior Avail of the abdomen, it gains the umbilicus, the point from which it was originally commenced. The peritoneum, which we have just described, forms ligaments for the liver, bladder, and uterus, which will be more properly described in the separate review of each of those viscera, and we will, therefore, for the present confine ourselves to the consideration of the several pro- cesses which it constitutes as it pursues its intricate course through the abdominal cavity. Gastro-hepatic or Lesser Omentum This essen- tially consists of a double fold, but separated from each other by the ductus communis choledochiis, vena portee, hepatic artery, with branches of the pneumogastric and sympathetic nerves. The formation of this" process is accounted for in the following manner. The layer of serous membrane reflected from the diaphragm, on the upper surface of the liver, around its anterior edge to Its under surface, is arrested in its further progress, on reachmg its transverse fissure, by the parts entering and leaving it. Inflected round them externally a large fold IS thrust in behind the stomach, covering in its posterior surface, and, descending, forms the posterior layer of the great omentum. Turning upwards now, it constitutes the anterior part of the transverse colon, which, on reaching the spine, ascends over the posterior wall of the abdomen as far as the liver, which it covers behind the transverse fissure, thus forming a continuous pouch or sac within the great sac of the peritoneum itsCAVITY OF THE ABDOMEN. 536 boundaries being the following:—anteriorly, the lesser omentum, stomacb, and great omentum; inferiorly, by this last process turning upwards on itself; posteriorly, the transverse colon, and the ascending layers of the transverse mesocolon ; and superiorly, the transverse fissure of the liver. The interval through which this secondary sac is thrust in was first described by Wins- low, and hence it has always been called after him, and described as the foramen Winslowi. It is bounded in front by the lesser omentum, and the parts contained in it; behind, by the ascending layer of the transverse mesocolon; below, by the superior horizontal portion of the duodenum and hepatic artery; and above, by the lobulus Spigelii of the liver. If the finger is kept close to the back part of the lesser omentum it wiU pass into the sac, and can be freely moved in the large space behind the stomach. Splenic Omentum.—This is a double fold of the pe- ritoneum, prolonged, from the inferior surface of the diaphragm, covering in this viscus completely, except at the hylus, where its vessels enter for its supply. From this point it is reflected to the right side, where it be- comes continuous with that covering the stomach, to which it is thus closely united, and necessarily also with the arch of the colon, through the ascending layer of the transverse mesocolon. Great Omentum.—In early life this process is ex- ceedingly circumscribed, and sometimes does not exist at all, but it becomes gradually developed with advanc- ing years, so as to reach from the lower margin of the stomach as far as the brim of the pelvis, being generally found to be a little lower on the left than the right side, thus accounting for the more frequent existence of epi- plocele in the latter situation. It usuaUy covers the mass of the small intestines like an apron, but is coiled up sometimes amongst them, sometimes is adherent to them, and requires the connexions to be broken up be- fore it can be properly seen. It presents various appear- ances in difi-erent individuals, being in some thin and diaphanous, whilst in others it is much thicker to the touch from the fat deposited between its layers. Glands likewise exist in this position, and it is traversed byPERITONEUM. 537 2 A 3 several branches of arteries derived from the epiploic and superior mesenteric. It forms the bond of union between the stomach and colon, suspending the arch of the latter, and maintaining it in its normal position. Teansverse Mesocolon This is merely the con- tinuation backwards and upwards of the two re- llected layers of the great omentum, which, after em- bracing the arch of the colon, pass backwards from it to the spinal column, suspending that portion of the great intestine. We have already remarked how the two layers are again separated at the spine by the in- ferior transverse portion of the duodenum, the one as- cending and binding down the several parts in connexion with the posterior wall of the abdominal cavity, and con- stituting the posterior boundary of the great cul de sac of the peritoneum which is thrust in through the fora- men of Winslow,—the ascending layer of the transverse mesocolon; the other proceeding downwards to form the sevei-al processes which we will presently describe, the descending layer of the transverse mesocolon. Mesentery—This is one of the most important in- flections of the whole serous sac, as it contributes in a great degree to maintaining the small intestines in their normal position. It is attached to the left side of the second lumbar vertebra, from which it passes downwards and to the right iliac fossa, where it becomes continuous with the serous membrane of that region. From the oblique line which it thus forms, it is reflected downwards at first, so as to cover the anterior surface of the whole of the small intestine, passes beneath its inferior border, and again passing behind it unites with the layer iii front, thus enveloping their whole circumference except superiorly and posteriorly, where a narrow portion is left uncovered, corresponding to the entrance of the ves- sels for their supply. The mesentery extends from the commencement of the jejunum to the termination of the ilium; the two layers of which it is composed beinrr separated by numerous branches derived from the su- perior mesenteric artery, glands, and lacteals, in their course to the receptaculum chyli. Lumbar Mesocolons.—These are lateral processes de- rived from the last mentioned, which are thrown over538 CAVITY OF THE ABDOMEW- and partially invest the ascending and descending colons, keeping them fixed in the right andleft lumbar regions. In their course outwards they likewise cover the an- terior surface of the kidney. MESociECUM and Ilio-Mesocolon.—Both these pro- cesses, the one partially investing the caecum, and the other the sigmoid flexure, are continuations downwards of the mesocolons of either side; the latter being always the most perfect, constituting a species of mesentery for this portion of the gut. The vermiform appendix, which is attached to the inner and posterior part of the c^cum, is very variable with respect to its peritoneal connexions, beino- sometimes tensely bound down by it to the wall of the pelvis, while at others it is sufficiently loose to allow it to float freely in that cavity. Mesorectum. — This, as we have already stated, forms a perfect covering for the upper third of the rec- tum, but is deficient posteriorly on its middle thirds, where it invests it only laterally and anteriorly, from which it is reflected forwards on the back part of the bladder, leaving its inferior third completely tmcovered. The partial envelope which it affords to the bladder has been already fully described in the anatomy of that viscus, and we will therefore only observe here, that m the male subject a large cid de sac is left between it and the rectum, its sides prominent, owing to the pas- sao-e of the ureters, which are contained withm its folds; and in this space is contained a great part of the small intestines. From the existence of the uterus in the female, it necessarily results that two such de sacs must ot;cur, one being situated between the front of the rectum and the back part of the vagina and uterus,--tlie larger; and the second between the front of the latter orcran and the back of the bladder,_the smaller. In the case of the female, likewise, two broad folos stretch from the sides of the uterus to the correspondmg iliac lossfe; they are termed the broad ligaments, contammg withm their folds the round ligament of the uterus, ovaries, and Fallopian tubes. . , ^ StLiure.-'nns, like the pleura, consists of a supcn - ficial layer of pavement epithelium, supported hy a ba e- ment membrane, with a subjacent stratum ot areolarSTOMACH. 539 tissue, containing numerotis elastic fibres. Its vascular supply is limited, while its nervous organization has not hitherto been clearly demonstrated, although, when the seat of inflammation, the manifestations of pain are of a most poignant character. Uses.—To connect as well as to facilitate the move- ments of the several viscera contained within the cavity. The cavity of the abdomen contains essentially the or- gans devoted to digestion, secretion, and excretion. In order to simplify them, they may be divided into the hollow or membranous, and the solid or glandular. The first consists of the stomach, duodenum, jejunum, caecum, ascending, transverse, and descending colons, sigmoid flexure and rectum; and the second comprises the liver, spleen, pancreas, and kidney. We will commence our description with the— Stomach.—This hollow viscus, truly a dilatation of the CBSophagus, is in the human subject a flattened cone, with the larger extremity directed towards the left side, the smaller towards the right, where it becomes continiious with the duodenum at the pylorus. It occupies nearly the entire of the epigastric and left hypochondriac regions, and presents, for the purposes of description, an anterior and posterior surface, a superior and inferior margin, a right and left extremity, and a cardiac and pyloric ori- fice. The anterior surface looks forwards and upwards, and is in relation with the diaphragm, abdominal walls, and left lobe of the liver, which overlaps it to a very variable extent; the posterior, directed downwards and backwards, corresponds to the sac of the omentum and ascending layer of the transverse mesocolon, which sepa- rates it from the inferior transverse portion of the duo- denum, pancreas, crura of the diaphragm, psose muscles, aorta, and several of its branches; the superior edrre, turned upwards and backwards, is short and concave,' except towards its pyloric extremity, where it is slightly convex; it corresponds to the lesser omentum, and the co- ronary and pyloric arteries, which are contained within its folds; the inferior margin, directed downwards and forwards, is much longer than the preceding, convex except at its smaller extremity, where a slight conca- vity exists, corresponding to the convexity on its upperCAVITV OF THE ABDOMEN. 540 edge; it is in contact with the greater omentum and the arch of the epiploic arteries; the left extremity is rounded and capacious, forming a large part of the en- tire organ; it corresponds to the spleen, diaphragm, and cartilages of the four or five inferior ribs; the pyloric extremity is small and constricted, and becomes conti- nuous directly with the duodenum, the point where this union takes place being variable, generally occupying a position between the horizontal fissure of the liver and o-all bladder; the line of demarcation between the two being, however, better marked and defined by a dense x'mo; the pylorus, which sinks in and contracts the ori- fice of communication between them. A little to the left side of the pylorus there is a dilatation perceptible on the stomach, particularly on its inferior margin, which has received the name of the antrum. If we now look to the relations of the pylorus, we will find them to be the following:—Anteriorly the abdominal wall, poste- riorly the pancreas; above, the liver; and below, the in-^ flection inwards of the peritoneum to form the sac ot the omentum. The oesophageal orifice of the stomach is situated at the left extremity of the lesser curvature, on a plain superior and posterior to its pyloric ; the left lobe of the liver is in front of it, partially embrac- ing it, while the lobulus Spigelii is thrust in behind it. Exclusive of the pressure of the surrounding parts and its vessels, which in some degree serve as ligaments, the stomach is maintained in position by its direct con- nexion with the oesophagus and duodenum, by the lesser omentum, which binds it to the liver; the splenic, which unites it to the spleen; and the greater omentum, which connects it to the transverse colon; a distinct process ol peritoneum is also reflected on it from the diaphragm around the oesophagus, which serves to attach it directly to this muscle. Structure.—The stomach may be said to have lour coats,—a serous, muscular, fibrous, and mucous. The serous may be considered to be almost perfect; it is derived from the gastro-hepatic omentum, which splits to receive it, and unites again at its inferior border to ihrm the srreat omentum, being closely adherent along its centre'^on both surfaces, but loosely towards its mar-541 STOMACH. gins, where a triangular interval is left between them, about an inch in extent, to allow the stomach to ex- pand when distended, as well as to accommodate the vessels which are destined for its supply. Muscular Coat. — Between this and the serous a thin layer of areolar tissue is observed, but it scarcely deserves the uame of a separate tunic. The muscular fibres are arranged in three sets,—longitudinal, circu- lar, and oblique. The first are directly continuous with those of the oesophagus, as, passing downwards from that tube, they expand over the anterior and posterior sur- faces of the stomach, but are loosely scattered, except at its upper margin, where they form a well-marked band, extending as far as the pylorus, into which the deeper fibres sink and there terminate, while the more super- ficial can be traced for some distance on the duodenum. The Circular Fibres form a series of distinct rings extending from the oesophagus to the pylorus. Near the former, and over the great extremity of the stomach, they are few, with broad intervals existing between them, but as we approach its duodenal end, they become better marked and more closely packed together, parti- cularly at the junction of its right with its middle third, where they form a remarkable constriction de- scribed by Sir Everard Home, and said to be the ana- logue of the bilocular stomach in the horse. They occa- sionally cross each other very obliquely, and do not always constitute complete circles, while at the pylorus they are very dense and strong, and form the constric- tion visible at that point. Oblique Fibres are found only on the great extre- mity; they cross each other very obliquely, and may be traced from the oesophageal orifice to the lower part oi the great cul de sac. The Muscular Fibres of the stomach are pale, and sometimes remarkably indistinct. They belong to the involuntary class, but a few striated are always visible scattered through them. ' Fibrous Coat—The existence of this tunic was first pointed out by Bichat. It may be exposed by dissect- ing off the muscular fibres, when it will be observed, presenting a white glistening appearance, possessed ofCAVITY OF THE ABDOMEN. 542 sufficient strength to preserve the shape and general ap- pearance of the organ. This may be proved by a sim- ple experiment. In removing the outer coats as far as the fibrous layer, and making a small perforation in the latter, on forcibly inflating the stomach, the mucous membrane will be found to protrude; and if the organ is again inverted, and the mucous membrane dissected off, a similar result will follow with respect to the muscular layers, when inflation has been carried to a sufficient ex- tent. The fibrous coat is reticular in its arrangement, and is closely adherent to the muscular. Mucous Coat.—This can only be examined properly in a recent stomach, which should be everted, and the mucus washed off by a gentle stream of water. It is smooth and soft to the touch, of a pale pmk colour, not of an uniform hue, but alternately presentmg lighter and darker shades, marked by a series of sinuous folds, o-enerally longitudinal, but sometimes intersected by others, taking an oblique direction (rugs), with inter- vening furrows,—those folds being more numerous and better developed near the pyloric orifice and its inferior border, a mechanism employed by nature to allow rapid distention, in which state they become nearly oblite- rated At the oesophageal orifice it forms small, loose, pendulous processes, divergent like the rays of a star which may likewise be effaced by the dilatation of that tube, and these are said to be typical of the valve found in this position in the horse. At the pyloric openmg it is suspended from the muscular ring, presenting a rounded constricted orifice, partially impeding the tran- sit of the chyme from the stomach into the duodenum, and equally preventing its regurgitation from the latter into the former. It is very loosely connected to the sub- iacent fibrous tissue by fine areolar tissue, and is much denser and stronger towards its oesophageal than pylo- ric extremity, while it is covered for its entire extent by a thin layer of columnar epithelium. But although the surface, on a cursory examination, ^^PP^^^^^ ° smooth and uniform, it is not really so, as it is .tudded with numerous elevations, each presenting a small pit ov depression, in the bottom of which are apparent the o ifices of several small tubes, which, if traced by aver-STOMACH. 543 tical section, are found to terminate by a c£Bcal extre- mity in the submncons tissue. These are the gastric follicles for the secretion of that fluid so essential to the process of chymification,—the gastric juice, consisting of muriatic, acetic, and lactic acid, the first jareponderating in quantity,—and of muriates of lime, potash, and soda, and a peculiar product termed pepsin. The walls of the alveoli, or depressions, in which those tubes are placed, are thickly studded with follicles similar to those of Lie- berliuhn in the small intestine; they dip into the mu- cous membrane nearly as far as the submucous tissue, and their cavity is lined internally by an aggregation of conoidal epithelial cells, so closely packed together, as only to leave at their free extremity a very minute orifice for the escape of the mucous secretion, while the intervals between the several follicles are filled up by a vascular network, which extends to the surface of the stomach, covered also by a layer of epithelium. With respect to the action of the several planes of muscular fibres of the stomach, the particular function of each has not as yet been accurately determined. The researches of Dr. Beaumont have, however, established the fact, that the food during chymification performs a rotatory movement from left to right along the great curvature of the stomach, and again from right to left along its lesser. It might be therefore assumed, that the longitudinal fibres of its upper and lower borders, by being alternately in a state of relaxation and contrac- tion, would have a tendency to impart this motion; while the oblique, situated at its great extremity, woiild na- turally, by their tension, expel it from the large cul de sac of the organ; the function of the circular is evi- dently to propel such portions as are properly chymified through the pyloric orifice into the duodenum. The arteries which supply the stomach are, the coro- nary from the caaliac axis, and the superior pyloric from the hepatic, inosculating between the layers of the lesser omentum on its concave border; and the two epiploic, the one a branch of the gastro-duodenalis, the other of the splenic, anastomosing on its inferior between the folds of the great omentum, with some large twigs from the latter,—the vasa brevia, confined especially to itsCAVITY OF THE ABDOMEN. 544 great extremity. It receives its nervous supply both from the cerebro-spinal and ganglionic system, the vagi and numerous branches from the solar plexus being dis- tributed to it. . Before concluding our remarks on the stomach, it may be necessary to observe, that we are by no means to judge of the distance between the oesophageal and pyloric orifice by its transverse breadth; they are, in fact, comparatively close, and merely separated by the short concave border, which very nearly approximates in length in all individuals. The (Esophageal opening is directed nearly vertically upwards, and lies on a plane superior and posterior to the pyloric, which is directed upwards, backwards, and towards the right side. The stomach is merely a dilated appendage of the ali- mentary canal, and as such is comparatively small m the foetus. At this period of life it is also remarkable for its vertical direction—a position in a great measure depending on the very large size of the left lobe of the liver It is also peculiar for the contracted appearance of its oesophageal extremity,_thefood which it requires for nutrition not demanding the same amount of chymi- fication as the more solid constituents which form the basis of support in the adult. The stomach m the fe- male is smaller than that of the male, and is more lia- ble to abnormal displacement, owing to causes connected with dress, habits, &c. _ . r^t, x Duodenum.—This is a direct continuation ot the sto- mach, commencing at the pylorus, opposite the horizon- tal fissure of the liver, from which it takes a curved direction to terminate at the second lumbar vertebra by uniting with the jejunum, the point of junction be- ing marked out by the attachment of the mesentery to the latter, and by the passage of the superior mesen- teric artery, which crosses the gut nearly at a right angle. It is the first portion of the sma 1 intestine, and has derived its name from its supposed length, which Ts said to be twelve fingers in breadth or nme inches. Curved in its general outline, with the convexity di- rect towards'the right side, it forms about three- Zrthsofan irregular circle, -"-^^^"S, tVvTtkal and inferior transverse portion, connected by a vertical545 DUODENUM. or perpendicular. Of these the superior transverse is the shortest, being not more than two inches, passing obhquely from the pylorus upwards, backwards, and towards the right side, to terminate at the liver, which it slightly grooves a little external to the gall bladder. At this point the vertical commences; its course is nearly perpendicularly downwards as far as opposite the third lumbar vertebra, in length scarcely reaching three inches. The inferior transverse extends from the termination of the preceding, upwards, forwards, and towards the left side, crossing the spinal column opposite the second lum- bar where the jejunum commences, and is about four inches in extent. If we now proceed to examine the relations of each separately, we will find them to be very complicated. The superior transverse portion rests upon the right crus of the diaphragm and psoas muscle, the portal and caval veins, gastro-duodenalis artery, ductus communis choledochus, and sympathetic nerve; above, it has the right lobe of the liver, foramen of Winslow, and gall bladder, with the exudation from which it is always partially stained; in front, the hepatic flexure of colon and gastro-colic omentum; and below it, the upper edge of the pancreas and gastro-duodenalis, dividing into gastro-epiploica dextra and pancreatico-duodenalis ar- teries. The vertical portion rests in its descent on the kidney and cava, but the latter is rather internal to it; in front of it is the ascending portion of the colon, lying anterior and external to it; the pancreas is to its inner side, but is separated from it by its own as well as the common bile duct and pancreatico-duodenalis artery, and externally is the abdominal wall. Inferior trans- verse has behind it the quadratus lumborum, psoas, and right crus of the diaphragm, ureter, vena cava, sympa- thetic nerve, and aorta, from which it is separated by the left renal vein; anterior to it is the splitting of the transverse mesocolon, stomach, and superior mesenteric artery; above it, the pancreas; and below it, the attach- ment of the root of the mesentery. From the tortuosity of this portion of the gut it ne- cessarily follows that it must partially occupy several regions of the abdominal cavity, and we accordingly find It in the epigastric, right hypochondriac, lumbar, and I546 CAVITY OP THE ABDOMEN. ■umbilical. The degree of motion which it enjoys in each of these is very unequal, but this we shall again ad- vert to. The remainder of the small intestine has been known by the name of jejunum and ilium,—an arbitrary dis- tinction, as no real line of demarcation exists between them, it being impossible to determine the termination of the one or the commencement of the other. To fol- low, however, the received rule, we may state that the upper two-fifths has been called the jejunum from the empty condition in Avhich it is usually found, while the remaining portion has been termed the ilium, from the numerous well-marked convolutions which it forms. As . it, however, gradually diminishes in size from its com- mencement to near its termination, its extremes, of course, naturally present very obvious differences; but about three inches before it reaches the right iliac fossa, where it joins the csecum, it again expands, and has a flattened appearance. The arrangement which nature has employed in order to accommodate their great ex- tent to the circumscribed cavity in which they are con- tained is strikingly beautiful. Disposed in coils, each constituting nearly a complete circle, the convexity of which is directed downwards and forwards, and em- braced by the serous membrane, which, springing from the root of the mesentery, passes downwards in front of each to return again behind it to be attached to the same spot,—they form a series of folds, lying upon and beside each other, but still floating so loosely, and_ so freely lubricated by the exudation of their investing membrane, as not to interfere in the slightest degree with the motions so requisite for the functions Avhich they are destined to perform. Their convolutions may be said to occupy more or less partially all the regions of the abdomen, with the exception of the three supe- rior, but they are found in greater abundance on the left than on the right side, owing to the position ot the liver, and extending likewise into the pelvic cavity. The small intestine, consisting of the three parts just alluded to, possesses, like the stomach, four distinct coats,—a serous, muscular, fibrous, and mucous. Serous.—This is disposed in a very peculiar mannerSMALL INTESTINE. 547 on the duodenum, not investing it all in the same de- gree. Like the stomach, with which it is continuous, the superior transverse portion receives its envelope from the lesser omentum, which covers it completely, except at its superior and inferior margins, where the fissures exist precisely as it does in that organ. This arrangement naturally bestows on this particular part a great amount of mobility, a characteristic which is deficient in the other two portions, which are fixed more or less firmly in their position, the inferior by the split- ting of the transverse mesocolon, and the vertical by its ascending layer. The two latter are, therefore, only covered on their anterior surface, and partially on their sides. The remainder of the small intestine, the jeju- num and iliiim, receive, however, a more complete in- vestment, and its arrangement is more regular through- out their entire extent, for, with the exception of the slight interval on its superior posterior border op- posite the attachment of the mesentery occupied by the arteries and emergence of the lacteals, the investment is perfect and very adherent. Muscular Fibre—This consists of two distinct lay- ers,—the longitudinal and circular, the former being the most superficial, and prolonged immediately from the stomach to the duodenum, and so in succession to the jejunum and ilium. In the first they are pale, indis- tinct, and scattered, but in the remaining portions of the small intestine they become much better marked, and more closely approximated to each other. They do not, however, consist of lengthened fibres, running con- tinuously from one of its extremities to the other, but of several fragments of varying length, which appear to overlap and indigitate with each other. The circular fibres, which lie immediately beneath the preceding, are of a denser and stronger character; they appear to form perfect rings around the gut, not always parallel, but occasionally crossing each other at a very oblique angle. Their appearance is very uniform in the whole course of the small intestine. Fibrous Coat.—This is precisely similar to the same structure in the stomach, being pale and thin, but re- markably strong.548 CAVITY OF THE ABDOMEN. Mucous Membrane.—The pendulous ring which this forms at the pylorus has been already alluded to. From this point it forms a complete lining for the small in- testine, as far as its junction with the caecum. _ In or- der to observe the various modifications which it exhi- bits in its lengthened course, it will be necessary to di- vide longitudinally portions of the duodenum, jejunum, and ilium, and examine them under water, when seve- ral of their peculiarities, which would not otherwise be visible, will at once become manifest. The mucous membrane of the superior transverse portion of the duodenum is generally uniform in its character, presenting a smooth velvet-like appearance, of a pale pinkish hue, but as we pass on to its vertical and inferior transverse divisions, a gradual change en- sues both in its colour and general surface, the biliary secretion imparting to it a yellowish-brown shade, while it is elevated into numerous ridges, taking a transverse direction, called valvulse conniventes, separated from each other by a series of corresponding furrows or depressions. These mucous folds are most evident in the lower parts, more especially in the neighbour- hood of the opening of the ductus communis choledo- chus, the aperture for which is visible a little above the inferior angle on the posterior internal surface of the gut, marked out by a papilla which becomes very apparent under water. The valvulae conniventes rarely form perfect circles, but more generally large segments, embracing about three-fourths of the cylmder, their extremities bifurcating and becoming insensibly lost on the adjacent surfaces, being always most promi- nent on the anterior wall of the intestine. These folds are not peculiar to the duodenum only, but are found also in the jejunum and ilium, but they gradually diminish both in size and number as we descend, form- ing little more than linear elevations in the last-named portion. On dissection they are found to be folds ot fine areolar tissue, supported on the fibrous framework of the gut, and covered by the mucous membrane. According to the opinion of some anatomists, they are said to be of use in favouring the rapid distention ot the gut, but this theory cannot be correct, as the ut-SMALL INTESTINE. 549 most dilatation which can be employed without rup- turing the intestine will never perfectly obliterate them; besides, their direction, which is transverse, is a strong argument against such a supposition. It would, therefore, appear more probable that their object is to retard the food in its passage, and by delaying its too rapid transit, to subject it to the action of the absor- bents, a more extended surface for which is admirably obtained by this beautiful arrangement. The mucous membrane in the upper part of the small intestine is much thicker and more vascular than in its lower, but in its whole course it is only loosely connected to the subjacent fibrous tunic by fine areolar tissue. Glands—In the superior transverse, as well as in the upper part of the vertical portion of the duodenum, a series of granular bodies may be observed, about the size of a small grain of shot, flattened out, of a pinkish grey colour, and situated in the submucous tissue, being very numerous at first, and closely impacted to- gether, but becoming more scattered as they descend They were first described by Brunner, and have since been called after the name of that anatomist. They appear to be identical in structure with the salivary glands, and they pour their secretion on the mucous membrane, each by a single duct, but with respect to the nature of the fluid which they elaborate, or its uses in the animal economy, nothing is distinctly known. Solitary Glands—These are found not only in'the small, but likewise in the large intestine, and they ap- pear to increase in number, according as they descend through the alimentary tube. They may be regarded as closed saccules, being about the size of a millet seed flattened out, oval in shape, in colour white, and con- taming when laid open a kind of fibrinous fluid inter- mixed with granular cells. It is a disputed point whe- ther they have any distinct orifice opening on the gut but the highest authorities argue that they have not' and entertain the opinion that the foramina or depres- sions visible occasionally on these surfaces and around their margins (crypts of Lieberkuhn), are caical, and do not communicate with the cavity of the vesicle It IS therefore supposed that the fluid, having accumulatedCAVITY OF THE ABDOMEN. 550 to a certain amount, presses on its anterior wall until a fissure results, through which it escapes, when the breach is again repaired for the production of a fresh secretion, the nature of which is not clearly under- stood, but is conceived to be an elimination from the blood of something noxious and deleterious, which na- ture is anxious to remove from the system by this pro- cess (Carpenter). Aggregate Glands—These are known as the glands of Peyer, who was the first anatomist who described them accurately. They are found in masses of variable size and of an oval shape, on the anterior or convex wall of the intestine, being scarcely if ever to he ob- served in the duodenum, thinly scattered in the jejumim, but comparatively numerous in the ilium, the last of these being found on the ilio-ca3cal valve. They are evidently nothing more than an aggregation of the soli- tary glands, but much smaller, each being surrounded by its zone of csecal depressions, and occasionally pre- senting one also in their centre. It may, therefore, be safely argued that their function, whatever that may be, is similar to the solitary, and this appears to derive confirmation from the analogous nature of the contained fluid. In typhoid fevers and phthisis these glands be- come the receptacles of a specific deposit, which pro- duces their subsequent ulceration; whUst in remittent fevers the glands of Brunner become much more appa- rent, in consequence of their increase in size. Follicles of Liebbrkuhn are found throughout the Avhole extent of the intestinal canal, and consist of a series of small tubules, extending by their ca^cal extre- mity as far as the submucous tissue, while their free is marked by a small aperture opening on the mucous surface They are very closely packed together, and covered by conoidal epithelium, which extends also into the cavity of the tubule. From them is poured out the succus intestinalis, for the purpose of preservmg the proper moisture of the gut, while the crypts of Lie- berkuhn, depressions formed by the involution of the mucous membrane, accomplish apparent y a similar obiect. In periods of inflammation the follicles become very manifest, as they are then filled by a quantity of551 SMALL INTESTINE. white tenacious secretion, whicli renders them much more easy to be distinguished. Villi—These are distributed throughout the entire of the alimentary tract, but are much more numerous in the small than the large intestines, where they are very few in number; it has, however, been stated that they are altogether absent in the superior transverse and upper part of the vertical portion of the duode- num (Carpenter). They are foliaceous in shape, con- sisting of an involution of mucous membrane, freely supplied by a capillary plexus of both arteries and veins, but they appear to be totally deficient in nerves; generally speaking, they are about one-fourth of a line m length. A vertical section exposes a single duct, sometimes two or three, which anastomose together, and which becomes dilated as it approaches the base of the villus, but on the free surface of the gut no orifice is visible. It was formerly supposed to be covered in by a closed network (Meckel), but according to more recent researches they are found to be clothed with a series of cells of the conoidal class, which are endowed with a selective property of absorbing solely the chyli- ferous products, and when fully distended with this fluid, they burst, discharging their contents into the ducts within the villus, leaving behind their nuclei for the_ regeneration of another series of cells, which are again destined to perform the same office (Goodsir) The nutritive portions of the food having by this means entered within the cavity of the villus, is transferred v.°™ l^- *° lacteals, a class of vessels remarkable for the thinness and transparency of their coats. These run between the layers of the mesentery, traversing in their course the numerous glands which are found in this position, frequently anastomosing, and gradually dmimishing m number, until at length reduced to five or SIX, they pour their contents into the receptaculum chyh or dilated extremity of the thoracic duct, which IS situated opposite the third lumbar vertebra on the front of the spine, immediately behind the abdominal aorta, from which the chyle is ultimately carried into the general venous system. The absorbent surface occupied by the villi is neces-552 CAVITY OF THE ABDOMEN. sarily much increased by the mucous folds or valvula; conniventes, which have been already described as oc- cupying the superior part of the small intestine princi- pally, and we accordingly find that they are more nume- rous where these processes are best developed, as in the lower portion of the duodenum and entire of the jeju- num: but where these begin to diminish mniimber and become less marked, so also do the villi decrease in number, as towards the termination of the ilmm where they are thinly scattered over the surface of the gut. We have already alluded to the manner m which the sihall intestine tapers gradually from the pylorus to within about two inches of its termination, Avhere it again slightly expands till it reaches the cscum uni^ng with this portion of the gut at an acute angle, ihe manner in which this union takes place is peculiar, and can only properly be understood on the dry inflated preparation. On the posterior and internal part of the c^cum, just at its junction with the colon, an elliptical aperture appears, more concave on its inferior than superior border, long from behmd, downwards, and forwards, the two lips which compose it meeting ante- riorly and posteriorly at a very acute angle. Ihe iliuni on reaching this aperture, is united to it by the p rhoneuni, which is tensely reflected from one to the other as well as by its longitudinal muscular fibres, wS a?e arranged in a similar manner, but its circular fibres, basement membrane, and mucous lining, appeal to be thrust into the aperture, to form two remarkabk valves, the ilio-colic and ilio-ca.cal, which J^t pro-^ nently out within the cavity of the c^cum. That this is really the mode of their formation may be proved by the simple experiment of dissecting away the connect- Int redia -tL serous membrane, and longitudina fibres-when, by pulling on the ilium, the valves will become effaced. In their'natural condition these valves are oTa ctcentic shape, being attached bj the. c-^^^^^ borders to the edge of the ^^^^^^P'^f'^^L'^iferpe ' free borders are closely approximated to ° ^^^^^^ mittinsc however, of easy divarication, so as to allow ot an mitung, iiuwv.v^ , J intestinal contents to553 LARGE INTESTINE. exactly similar, as the ilio-colic stands out at nearly a right angle from the wall of the gut (the horizontal), while the ilio-cascal is more oblique, bending upwards and towards the right side (the vertical); the free mar- gin of the former being slightly concave, while that of the latter is alittle convex. From the angles of theorifice, where they unite, strong bands of fibrous tissue pass off, covered, of course, by the mucous membrane (reti- nacula), and are gradually lost on the circumference of the caacum, but they do not appear to unite, the pos- terior being evidently the longest and densest. The use of these valves is to prevent regurgitation from the large into the small intestine, but they do not seem ac- curately competent to perform this office, as the gaseous and liquid constituents will undoubtedly return. It may be scarcely necessary to add, that the closure of the valves depends upon the distention of the colon and cascum, which by separating the angles has a tendency to approximate their edges. Large Intestine—This consists of the cajcum, colon, sigmoid flexure, and the rectum, and from the peculiar direction which it pursues, is found in the following regions:—It commences in the right iliac by a dilated pouch, the caecum, from which it passes upwards through the right lumbar, till it reaches the liver (the ascending colon); from this point it stretches across the umbilical, forming a variable curve, the concavity of which is directed downwards and forwards, as far as the spleen (transverse colon); from this it again descends through the left lumbar, as far as the left iliac fossa (descending colon), where it becomes very tortuous, as far as the sacro-iliac synchondrosis (sigmoid flexure), and in the remamder of its course it is found in the pelvis, and known by the name of rectum. It may be here gene- rally stated, that the largeintestine gradually diminishes in size from the cascum to the sigmoid flexure, but again gradually increases in circumference from the latter to the lower part of the rectum, the whole con- stituting, in fact, two pyramids, with the apices united in the left iliac regions. Cecum or Caput Colli.—This is of a triangular shape, with the base above continuous with the ascend- 2 a554 CAVITY OF THE ABDOMEN. ino- colon, which it joins at an obtuse angle, salient towards the right side, the apex below, but presenting not a pointed, but a rou.nded extremity. It is of varia- ble length, but always limited by an horizontal section carried°horizontally across, immediately above where it is perforated by the termination of the ilium. As it lies in position it occupies the right iliac fossa, resting upon the iliac fascia, and connected to it by a quantity of loose areolar tissue; in front it corresponds to the abdominal w^all, from which it is usually separated by some coils of the small intestines; externally it is in relation with the wall of the iliac fossa, internally with the ilium, and inferiorly Avith the vermiform appendix. Processus Vermiformis.—This is a narrow, worm- like appendage, springing from the posterior and inter- nal part of the csecum. It is of very variable length, ranging from one to six inches, and is equally irregular in its position, being sometimes found m the iliac fossa, sometimes in the pelvic cavity, and sometimes coiled up behind the ceecum itself. In caliber it is about as large as a goose-quill, and at its point of junction with the gut a loose valve is thrown across, but it does not ap- pear to be sufficient to prevent the entrance of f^cal matter, which is often found within it. The perito- neum which is inflected around it, sometimes is ex- tremely long and falciform, conferring on it a degree of mobility which is occasionally very extensive. With respect to its use in the human subject nothmg what- ever is known with regard to it- Ascending CoLoN.-This reaches from the c^cum as far as the inferior surface of the liver and is compara- tively straight.

It differs from the ascending in being more deeply situated, and presents a slight concavity which is directed forwards In its course downwards it is supported by the kidney and quadratus lumborum, and has in front of it the small intestines, which are also folded in external to it,_on Its inside it is in relation with the psoas.

It is very irregular in Its length, as it may vary from six inches to three feet m extent; but it is always convoluted, and imparts to the touch a denser and thicker feel than the rest of the large intestine, while the serous membrane is loosely re- flected around it, which confers on it a mobility nearly equal to that of the ilium and jejunum. It corresponds by its deep surface to the iliac fossa, and in front to the abdominal parietes,_in every other direction it is en- veloped by the convolutions of the small intestines KECTUM.—This portion of the gut has been very in- correctly named, as from its designation it mio-ht be presumed to be perfectly straight, which is far from be- ing the case. It commences at the left sacro-iliac syn- chondrosis a point which is rather arbitrary, and takes a curved and tortuous direction downwards, to terminate at the anus. It has generally been divided into three parts: the first extending from its origin to the third piece of the sacrum, passing obliquely downwards back- wards, and towards the right side; the second reaches as lar as the tip of the coccyx, its course being down- wards, forwards, and slightly to the left side; the third556 CAVITY OF THE ABDOMEN. piece which is the shortest, is directed downwards and backwards to the verge of the anus. There is a marked dissimilarity in the caliber of these three portions; the first being constricted, particularly at its commence- ment- the second gradually increases in size, forming at its iunction with the third a large dilatation, but it again becomes insensibly constricted as it approaches the anus, where it is embraced by the sphincters. J2e/a<wns.—Posteriorly it corresponds to the iho-sacral symphisis, pyriformis muscle, sacral plexus, middle sa- cral artery, sympathetic ganglia, coccyx, ano-coccygeal ligament, and posterior fibres of levator am; anteriorly to the cul de sac of peritoneum, which is usually filled with the convolutions of the small intestines, base ot the bladder, vesicul^ seminales, and vasa deferentia, the latter being separated from each other by a trian- gular interval, already described with the bladder, pos- terior extremity of prostate gland, which is intimately connected to it, and recto-bulbar space; laterally the ureters, a mass of loose areolar tissue, and insertion of the levatores ani, which separate it from the ischio-rectal fossse at each side. „ , ^ The large intestine, like the small, has four coats,— a serous, muscular, fibrous, and mucous. We wiU now proceed to examine each separately. ^ Serous CoAT.-This is very variously arranged m the several portions of the large mtestme, and a so differs materially in different individuals. Generally sneaking, it is so disposed over the caecum, ascendmg and descending colons, as to cover them anteriorly and laterally, while it is deficient posteriorly where its TDlace is taken by fine, loose, areolar tissue. Exceptions, however, occur in this rule, particularly in the c^cum, which may occasionally be connected to the iliac fossa by a specious of mesentery, of variable extent, bes o^^ang on it a degree of mobility which is not generaUy the hafacLSc of this portion of the gut. ^^^^^^^^^^^^ colon on the contrary, may be said to be almost com Setely surrounded by the peritoneal investment which rSved from the reflected layers of the great omen- tum which splits to receive it, and hence the facility iTh which it is enabled to change its position. TheLARGE INTESTINE. 557 fold wtiich connects the sigmoid flexure to the left iliac fossa is generally very loose and long, and consequently it embraces it nearly completely, but the rectum re- ceives a perfect tube from it in its superior third, but in its middle only a partial covering, while in its infe- rior it is altogether deficient. The serous membrane likewise embraces and binds to the large intestines a series of fatty processes (appendices epiploicas), which are generally found on its anterior and internal walls. They are of variable size, being sometimes exceedingly small, and again so large as nearly to embrace the en- tire caliber of the gut. Their precise use is not known, but they have been usually described as reservoirs of nutrition, a theory which is not certainly borne out by fact, as we have observed them of a more than ordinary size in cases where emaciation had proceeded to very great extent. In the infant they are always absent. Muscular Coat.—This consists of two planes, a longitudinal, which are superficial, and a circular, which are deeper; the former can be traced from the apex of the vermiform appendix to its base, where they are very numerous, but as they pass up on the csecum, they converge towards three distinct points, so as to form three bands, which extend along the gut, sometimes as far as the iipper third of the descending colon, but oc- casionally to the commencement of the sigmoid flexure, where they are reduced to two in number, those on the posterior surface gradually converging and ultimately uniting. On the inferior part of this portion of the tube they are scattered, and for the whole extent of the rectum surround it completely, and appear to be at last blended with the fibres of the levator ani. Of the three bands which are found on the ascending colon, one is anterior; this is strong, dense, and of a glistening whiteness; one posterior and external; and one poste- rior and internal, the two latter being weaker and badly marked. In the transverse colon the position of these bands becomes changed, that which was anterior becomes inferior, that which was internal, superior, and that which was external, anterior; in the descending colon, however, they again resume the arrangement which they bore on the ascending, this transposition, in fact, depend-CAVITY OF THE ABDOMEN. 558 ing on the torsion of the tube, and not on any positive alteration in the direction of the bands. The remark- able sacculated appearance which this portion of the intestinal canal presents is attributable to those longi- tudinal fibres, which are at least one-third shorter than it; and hence the puckered condition of the tube to create a correspondence in length between the two, an arrangement admirably calculated to bestow increase of surface without additional elongation. We have already stated that at variable points on the descending colon the two posterior bands tmite and form one, a con- dition which continues as far as the termination of the sigmoid flexure, where they become scattered, of a redder colour, and as distinct fibres surround the rec- tum, being very simikr in their character, but not quite so strong as those of the oesophagus, a few of the striated or voluntary class being found among them. The Circular Fibres may be exposed by cautiously dissecting off the longitudinal; they form, as on the small intestine, a series of rings embracing the gut as far as the sigmoid flexure, where they become much thicker and more closely impacted together. Their density continues to increase on the rectum, till we ap- proach the verge of the anus, around which they form a dense fascic^ilus of about an inch in depth, which completely encircles it. The colour is likewise more vivid, and the voluntary and involuntary class of fibres are completely intermingled in this last situation. Fibrous Coat is of the same character as that already described in the small intestine. Mucous Coat.—This is much paler than m the small intestine, and more loosely attached to the fibrous tissue beneath. Properly speaking, it has no valves if we ex- cept the ilio-colic and csecal already described, and but few folds, and these always indistinct and imperfect, for the large saccules which are visible on laying open the gut are equally formed by the fibrous and muscu- lar coats. The existence of the villi has also been de- nied, but it is thickly studded with follicles nearly analogous to those of the stomach; solitary glands or structures very similar to them may be also observed, a vertical section showing that they are of a fiask-likeLARGE INTESTINE. 559 shape, the broad extremity resting on the basement membrane, the narrower portion corresponding to the free surface, but they appear to be open-mouthed, and without the covering which they possess in the small intestines; they are thickly covered with epithelium (columnar), which sinks into the cavity of the small depressions and lines them throughout. Their use is evidently for the purpose of the mucous secretion with which this portion of the gut is so abundantly supplied. In the rectum the mucous membrane is particularly thick and smooth, but loosely attached to the subjacent tissues; it is also very vascular, deriving its supply of blood from several and different sources. Some re- markable folds are also visible on it, first accurately de- scribed by Dr. Houston; these are generally three, but may amount to four in number; the first is on the right side, just at its commencement, opposite the right sacro- iliac synchondrosis; the second on the left, opposite the third bone of the sacrum; the third anteriorly, corres- ponding to the base of the bladder; while the fourth, when it does exist, is situated posteriorly between the last and the verge of the anus. In order to obtain a good view of those folds, the rectum should be cleared out, and while still in situ, should be filled with spirits of wine, which will have the efiect of hardening its tissues, and thus will afford an opportunity of makino- a longitudinal section of the gut, by which those mucous elevations will be rendered apparent. According to the views of Dr. Houston, these folds may be considered as a species of shelves, which, by supporting the ftecal matter in the intestine, may relieve the sphincter of a part of the superincumbent weight, but we conceive that they may perhaps be of use in allowing the ascent and descent of the gut, in accordance with the contrac- tion and relaxation of the levator ani. The dilatation of the rectum has likewise been provided for by a series of vertical folds, not always very distinct, extending from its commencement to its termination. The mucous membrane terminates two or three lines within the anal orifice, by becoming continuous with the skin, their point of union being indicated by a faint wavy line, which may be easily distinguished by560 CAVITY OP THE ABDOMEN. dilating the part, so as to efface the radiating integu- mentary folds which encircle the outlet. In this position it is highly vascular, sometimes thrown into plicas, studded with crypts or glands, and supported by a dense layer of erectile tissue. The adjoining integu- ment in the male subject is implanted with some scat- tered hairs, but this peculiarity is rarely observed in the female. The arterial and nervous organization of the stomach having already been briefly alluded to, we will now proceed to state the sources from which a similar sup- ply is imparted to the small and large intestines, re- serving, however, a more detailed explanation of their course and individual relations till a future period. The duodenum receives its greatest amount of blood from the pancreatico-duodenalis; the jejunum and ilium from the numerous branches of the superior mesenteric, which with the inferior mesenteric also supplies the large intestine down to the termination of the sigmoid flexure, while the rectum is supplied by the superior hsemorrhoidal, a branch of the inferior mesenteric, the middle hsemorrhoidal from the internal iliac, and an inferior heemorrhoidal from the internal pudic. The effete blood is carried back by corresponding venous trunks, which ultimately unite to form the porta, the destination of which is the liver. The nervous supply is derived from the great solar plexus, an offset ot the sympathetic, which sends its numerous filaments to the entire of the hollow tube, the rectum likewise receivmg additional twigs from the sacral plexus. Development—I^^Q alimentary canal is developed from the umbilical vesicle or yelk sac, and is at first a conti- nuous tube, narrow and nearly straight, closed at both extremities till about the end of the second month, when the mouth and anus are found to make their appear- ance. Shortly afterwards, a small dilatation marks out the position of the future stomach, and the tube gra- dually assumes those curvatures which are to continue as the permanent distinctive characters of the large and small intestine. Properly speaking, a ca3cum can be scarcely said to exist in the foetus or in very early in- fancy ; but it appears to be formed by the weight of the ILIVER. 561 2 B 3 fecal matter lodging in this dependent portion of the gut. The appendix vermiformis, of variable length, but always persistent, remains to mark out the original point of communication between the alimentary canal and the umbilical vesicle, a fact that was formerly doubted, but is now placed beyond dispute by the in- vestigation of recent observers. LIVER. Having now concluded our remarks on the hollow viscera, we will next proceed to examine the solid, com- mencing with the liver, as being the most important in the animal economy. It is the largest of all the glan- dular bodies, remarkable not only for its size, but like- wise for its firmness, peculiar construction, and secre- tion,—the latter performing a decided part in the func- tion of digestion. When normally situated, it occupies the right hypochondriac and epigastric regions, but sometimes may extend into the left hypochondriac, or into the right lumbar or umbilical; in forced inspira- tion there can be no doubt but it descends more or less into the two latter. In its general outline it resembles an oblique section, of an ovoid figure, cut longitudi- nally, being longer in its transverse than antero-poste- rior diameter,—the former measuring from ten to twelve inches, the latter from six to eight. It presents for description a superior and inferior surface, an anterior and posterior margin, and a right and left extremity. The superior surface is smooth and very convex; but more particularly so on its right side, presenting, how- ever, a slight sulcus superiorly, corresponding to the falciform ligament; it lies in contact with the dia- phragm, to the concavity of which it is accurately adapted,—this muscle forming the partition between it and the base of the right lung; its inferior surface is concave, but irregular, a deep sulcus running from be- fore backwards, containing the obliterated umbilical vein and ductus venosus, separating it into its right and left lobes. This is sometimes bridged over by a thin layer of hepatic structure (pons hepatis), which oblite- rates the sulcus, leaving, however, the notch still appa- rent at its anterior margin, marking out its position.CAVITY OF THE ABDOMEN. 562 This surface corresponds anteriorly and to the right side to the gall bladder, angle of duodenum and colon, suprarenal capsule and right kidney, gastro-hepatic omentum, with the parts separating its layers, hepatic artery, which embraces its Spigelian lobe, which, with the foramen of Winslow, divide it from the pancreas and anterior surface of stomach. The posterior margin is exceedingly thick, and intercepted by two depres- sions, the larger lying between the left and right lobes, deep and broad, corresponding to the vertebral column, aorta, and crura of the diaphragm; the smaller is occupied by the ascending cava, while in the remainder of its ex- tent it corresponds to the diaphragm. Its anterior mar- gin is thin, presenting the notch already alluded to for the insertion of the ligamentum teres; it is in relation with the cartilages of the ribs, but in motions of respi- ration usually descends below them for about half-an- inch; its right extremity is very thick, and corresponds to the five or six lower ribs and the indigitations of the transversalis with the diaphragm; its left is thin and sharp, being in contact with the great extremity of the stomach, and sometimes extending so far as to touch the spleen. The liver is retained in position by five ligaments, four of which are merely folds of the peritoneum, and the fifth is the obliterated remains of the umbilical vein. The last takes its origin from the fibrous tissue of the umbilical orifice, to which it is firmly adherent, and passing upwards, and to the right side, is inserted into the notch at the thin margin of the liver. Its use appears to be not so much to suspend the organ as to keep it closely fixed to the abdominal wall; and thus to relieve the stomach of the pressure to which it would be otherwise subjected. Falciform Ligament This is a double fold of peri- toneum, carried down from the abdominal wall to the upper surface of the liver, over which it is afterwards reflected. It is triangular in shape, presenting two margins,—an anterior, superior, and posterior inferior, a base and an apex. The anterior superior margin is convex, and attached to the right side of the linea alba; the posterior inferior is concave, and corresponds to theLIVER. 563 upper and convex surface of the liver; the base is free, looks downwards and backwards, and contains the um- bilical vein, while its apex, pointing upwards and back- wards, bifurcates into two processes, in figure similar to the flukes of an anchor, attached above to the diaphragm and below to the liver,—this is the coronary ligament, which can be traced out on either side to become conti- nuous with the lateral, which are situated at the extre- mities and posterior edge of the liver, the left lying im- mediately in front of the oesophagus, pneumogastric nerves, and superior coronary artery, while the right occvipies a position external to the groove for the vena cava. The vessels and duct, with the pressure of the adjacent viscera, assist materially in keeping the oro-an in situ. It is to be presumed that the student has already examined the arteries, great veins, and duct, in this re- gion, and having done so, he may now proceed to re- move the liver by dividing its connexions to the Avails of the abdomen, as well as the vessels in relation with it, taking care, however, to leave a sufficient length of the latter to enable him to observe their ultimate course and destination. He may now clean away the loose areolar tissue and peritoneum from the fissures, and more accurately examine the peculiarities of the organ. We have already stated that the liver on its upper surface is convex, and marked by a slight antero-pos- terior groove, corresponding to the falciform process, which divides it into its two lobes, the right being atleast three or four times larger than the left. Its inferior is much more irregular, presenting a deep antero-pos- terior sulcus, which, as has been previously stated, is sometimes converted into a complete canal by a process of the liver which is thrown across it; this contains anteriorly the obliterated umbilical vein and posteriorly the ductus venosus. Passing off at a right angle from this, and extending for about an inch and a half on the right lobe, is another fissure, broad and deep, limited externally by the sulcus for the gall bladder, and situ- ated a little behind the centre; this is the transverse, which must be regarded as of great importance, as through it the vessels, duct, and nerves enter andCAVITY OF THE ABDOMEN. 564 emerge. From its right extremity arises the sulcus for the gall bladder; it passes downwards and forwards, generally as far as the free margin of the liver, and cor- responds in shape to the figure of the contained viscus. On the posterior thick margin is observed the fissure for the vena cava ascendens; it is placed on the inner side of the right lobe, infringing partially on its inferior surface,—it, as well as that for the gall bladder, being oc- casionally converted into a complete canal by a portion of the liver being continued over them. Thus we may observe that the liver presents on its lower aspect five fissures, which may be recapitulated as that for the gall bladder, that for the umbilical vein, that for the ductus venosus, that for the vena cava, and the trans- verse for the hepatic artery, duct, nervous plexus, portal vein, absorbents and capsule of Glisson. With respect to the depressions, they are found to be exactly similar in number, and may be enumerated as the superficial excavation on the under surface of the left lobe, corre- sponding to the stomach, on which it rests, the deep notch p°osteriorly embracing the vertebral column and crura of the diaphragm; the depression on the posterior and external part of the right lobe for the kidney and suprarenal capsules; and the two in front of the trans- verse fissure, always superficial, the most anterior and external for the angle of the colon; and the posterior and internal, for the sharp curve of the duodenum. The liver has been primarily divided into two great lobes, the right and left; but the former has been again subdivided into three others,—the lobulus quadratus, lobulus Spigelii, and lobulus caudatus. Some anatomists admit even a fourth,—the lobulus dexter. The positive distinctions, however, between these several lobules are not always uniformly marked, and in many instances they must be considered as purely arbitrary. The right lobe may be said to form the greatest bulk of the entire orcran, and in its superficial outline is quadrilateral its left margin being rather shorter than the right which is also much thicker in vertical depth. The left lobe, on the contrary, is comparatively thin in its whole ex- tent, and very irregular in shape and size, being some- times oval, sometimes triangular, and sometimes markedLIVER. 565 with a narrow tongue, thin and overlapping the spleen; generally speaking, it is one-third or one-fourth the size of the right lobe; but we have had opportunities of wit- nessing instances where it had no existence at all, and where the iimbilical vein ran along the left edge of the one solitary lobe. LoBULUS QuADRATUS is of a quadrilateral shape, its greatest length being antero-posteriorly. It is bounded in front by the free anterior edge of the liver, posteri- orly by the transverse fissure and the parts entering into it; to the left side by the horizontal and the um- bilical vein, and to the right by the gall bladder and the sulcus, in which it is contained. It is sometimes little more than a mere oblong slip. LoBULUS Spigelii, so called from the anatomist who is said to have first described it, is a tongue-shaped ele- vation, dependent from the under surface and posterior part of the liver: it is bounded in front by the trans- verse fissure; behind by the thick edge; to the right side by the fissure for the vena cava, and to the left by the ductus venosus. When in position, it lies to the right side of the oesophagus, and reaches down so far as to touch the pancreas, where it appears to be embraced by the great branches of the celiac axis, particularly the hepatic. It was known to the older anatomists as the posterior portal eminence, the lobulus quadratus being termed the anterior. This lobule is attached to the liver by two distinct roots,—a posterior, which winds round the vena cava, generally converting it into a com- plete canal; and an anterior, which is now generally known by the following name:— Lobulus Caudatus, always very indistinctly marked, is merely that portion of the liver circumscribed be- tween the depression for the kidney behind, and those for the colon and duodenum in front. The lobulus dexter is the thick posterior angle lying behind the renal fossa. The liver is invested by two tunics, an external se- rous and an internal, which may be considered as its proper capsule, fibro-areolar. The first of these is de- rived from the peritoneum, which, with slight excep- tions, forms nearly an entire investment for it, covering566 CAVITY OF THE ABDOMEN. it completely except its posterior border, the groove for the gall bladder, over which it is reflected, the great fissures, and the small spaces between the ligaments. The extensive surface of serous membrane which is thus afforded has naturally a tendency to facilitate those mo- tions to which the organ is subjected in the alternating movements of inspiration and expiration, which it must necessarily follow from its attachment to the diaphragm. The proper fibrous capsule was first described by Glis- son, who conceived it to be muscular, and it is best ob- served on those parts of the liver where the serous coat is deficient. It is thin, but strong, and cannot be de- tached for any extent from the hepatic structure, ow- ing to processes which are very freely sent into it at all points. On arriving at the transverse fissure, it forms complete tubules or sheaths around the several vessels and ducts as they enter at the same point, and is ulti- mately expended in constituting investing capsules for the small lobules of which the organ is composed, be- ing in this position very thin, but vascular, from the numerous filaments of the hepatic artery which ramify on its surface. Even in the human liver the lobules are large enough to be detected with the naked eye, but present a diff"erent aspect according as they are cut in the vertical or transverse direction, being in the former in- stance leaf-shaped, the margin not presenting, however, an uniform appearance, while in the latter they are poly- hedral, having sometimes four, five, or six angles. Each lobule is enclosed in a process of the capsule, which em- braces it completely, except at its base, where it is de- ficient, and where it rests on a small vein,—the sublobu- lar; they do not lie exactly in contact Avith each other, but narrow intervals are left between their contiguous margins (interlobular fissures), but when more than two are in juxtaposition, this interval is increased in size (in- terlobular space). A lobule consists of a series of gra- nular cells, interspersed with branches from the portal and hepatic veins, hepatic artery, and according to some the hepatic ducts; these must be now severally ex- amined. Hepatic Artery A large branch of the cscliac axis; passes upwards to the liver, between the layers of theLIVER. 567 lesser omentum lying to the left side of the duct and portal vein, and at the distance of about an inch, or perhaps a little more, from the transverse fissure, di- vides into two branches, a right and left, the former be- ing the larger, as it usually gives off the small branch, the cystic, to the gall bladder, while it also has to sup- ply the larger portion of the organ. Both branches penetrate the fissure at its extremities between the duct and vein, breaks up into a number of minute branches, ■which pass into the interlobular spaces; they then ra- mify on the capsule until they ultimately reach the lo- bule which they are destined to supply; these are se- verally known by the name of the vaginal, interlobular, and lobular branches; of the last a few twigs only pe- netrate the lobule, apparently for its supply, their effete blood mingling with that of the porta, to be after- wards removed by the hepatic veins. The function is principally that of nutrition to the various tissues of which the organ is composed. •Vena Portje—This is a very large trunk, deriving its blood principally from the mesenteric and splenic. From the point where it is formed, between the head of the pancreas and aorta, it passes upwards and to the right side, and when between the layers of the lesser omentum, lies on a plane posterior as well as between the artery and duct. Like the former, its primary di- vision is into two branches, which again subdivide into vagmal, interlobular, and lobular, the latter not only ramifying on the lobule, but likewise perforating its cap- sule, and forming within it a close and complicated ve- nous plexus, from which is derived, by exosmotic transu- dation, the bile, a subject to which we will again have occasion to revert, while the principal portion of its blood which remains after the elimination of this secre- tion IS conducted by a series of small branches into the centre, where they form by their union a trunk, to which the name intralobular has been applied; this ultimately emerges at the base of the lobule, where the sublobular vein is situated, and these latter, continuously uniting and increasing in size as they proceed, at length pour their blood by three or four large orifices into the vena cava inferior, as it fissures the posterior thick mar<^inCAVITY OP THE ABDOMEN. 568 of the liver. Transverse sections of the organ made from above downwards will clearly demonstrate the gradual increase in capacity in those vessels, as their cut sur- faces continue patulous, and have no tendency to col- lapse. Hepatic Ducts.—According to Mr. Kiernan, these commence from a complicated biliary plexus in the cen- tre of the lobule, and that they pass out to the surface, on which they again ramify before they enter the in- terlobular fissures, to anastomose with each other at the interlobular spaces, until, by repeated junctions, they at length terminate in forming the right and left hepa- tic ducts, which emerge from the portal canals at either extremity of the transverse fissure. The researches of succeeding observers have, however, rendered the exist- ence of this biliary plexus questionable, and it is now more generally supposed that they do not perforate the lobule at all, but terminate in blunted and csecal expansions in the interlobular spaces, presenting at this point an irre- gular tuberculated appearance from the pressure of the cells, of which the lobule is principallycomposed, on their walls. Those cells, the active agents in the elimination of the biliary secretion, are sometimes nucleated and some- times the reverse, and are arranged with a certain degree of regularity in a species of linear direction around the intralobiilar vein and its formative branches, which occu- py the centre of the lobule. It is at this point the elimi- nation of the fluid is conceived to commence, and to be thence propagated from cell to cell, which sometimes are found to communicate for its more ready transit, until it reaches the surface, where it is poured into the inter- lobular spaces by the bursting of the cell, to be absorbed by the ctecal extremities of the biliary tubes, which pur- sue the course already indicated, to terminate at the right and left hepatic ducts at the extremities of the transverse fissure. After proceeding downwards for about an inch and a half, these ducts unite to form the common hepatic, which, after a course of nearly the same distance, is joined by the cystic, constitutmg the ductus communis choledochus, which passes doAvnwards, backwards, and slightly to the right side, until it reaches the posterior and internal border of the duodenum, which569 LIVER. it perforates about its centre, to open on its internal sur- face, near its lower angle. The relations of the right and left hepatic ducts, from their emergence to their point of union, present nothing remarkable; they are con- cealed by a quantity of loose areolar tissue, and the branches of the artery and vena porta, and but little diflference appearing in their size. The common hepatic duct formed by their union rests on the vena porta, and lies between the layers of the lesser omentum, having the hepatic artery above and to its left side. The duc- tus communis choledochus has the same relations above, but it soon emerges from between the layers of the gas- tro-hepatic omentum to rest upon the right crus of the diaphragm, where it is covered by the superior trans- verse portion of the duodenum; it is next found be- tween its vertical division and head of the pancreas, the latter of which it deeply grooves, and ultimately runs obliquely between the coats of the gut for about an inch before it opens on its mucous surface, immediately be- fore which it is joined by the pancreatic duct, its pa- pilla and orifice being always very perceptible Avhen examined under water. Experiment, however, will prove the impossibility of forcing fluid from the gut into the duct, but the duodenum may be very easily distended from it. Gall Bladder.—This can only be regarded as a di- verticulum from the hepatic duct, and is the reservoir into which the bile is poured when not required. In size it is very variable, being usually as large as a small pear, and very analogous to it in shape, its base pro- truding beyond the free margin of the liver, so as to lie in contact with the abdominal wall below the cartilage of the ninth or tenth rib, and to the right side of the rectus; superiorly it corresponds to the liver, which is grooved for its reception, while inferiorly it rests on the superior transverse portion of the duodenum and right angle of the colon, which are generally stained of a greenish hue from its exudation. It terminates, supe- riorly and posteriorly, in a constricted neck, which pre- sents a remarkable curvature similar to the letter S, the mucous membrane being thrown into a large valve at each curvature, their free margins being turned towardsCAVITY OP THE ABDOMEN, 570 each other, but a small interval exists between them, which is always more or less dilated. At the termina- tion of the neck the cystic duct commences; it is usually very small in caliber, and contrasts strikingly in size with that of the common bile duct, which is generally as large as a goose-quill; passing downwards, and to the left side, it unites after a course of about an inch and a half with the last-named tube at a very acute angle, the mucous membrane again forming a well-marked valve at their point of junction. It lies between the layers of the lesser omentum on the vena porta and to the right side of the cystic artery, which always gives olF a small branch for its supply. The structure of the biliary ducts and gall bladder is precisely similar: they have three coats,—an external or serous, a middle or areolo-fibrous, and an internal or mucous. The peritoneal tunic is not complete, but is deficient altogether on the lower portion of the common biliary duct, the upper, with the cystic, only borrowing a partial investment from the lesser omentum; the gall bladder is covered generally only inferiorly, the serous membrane simply binding it to the fossa in the liver, but sometimes it has been found forming a species of mesentery for it, and embracing it nearly completely. The areolo-fibrous tissue which constitutes the middle coat is strong, but very lax in its character; in the gall bladder it isintersected by several strong, cord-like fibres, which form elevated ridges on the mucous membrane internally, their apparent usebeing to preserve the shape of the viscus, and counteract over-extension. The mu- cous lining is derived from that of the duodenum; it is thin, and presents numerous follicles irregularly ar- ranged in the ductus communis choledochus and hepatic ducts, but constituting two distinct vertical rows in the smaller tubes. In the gall bladder it is also follicular, and the depressions are so very numerous as to give it the appearance of an affection sometimes seen in the skin,—cutis anserina. We have already alluded to the two large valves which are found in its neck, but exclu- sive of these, a great number, but much smaller in size exist, in the cystic duct; these never observe the same direction, but may be transverse, vertical, or ob-571 LIVER. lique, sometimes amounting to nearly twenty in num- ber, and occasionally conferring on the interior of the tube a kind of spiral appearance; they seem to offer an equal opposition to the ingress or egress of the bile into and from the gall-bladder. In the common biliary and hepatic ducts, there are, properly speaking, no valves, and any excrescence that may appear on the mu- cous membrane is purely accidental. A large fold, how- ever, is always found at the confluence of the cystic and hepatic ducts, and this is prolonged for some distance into the ductus communis choledochus; another like- wise exists at the junction of the right and left hepatic, but this is always much more limited in extent. The bile elaborated from the liver has been very fully analyzed by Gmelin, and the result of his investigations may be thus briefly stated:—1. A substance with a pecu- liar musky smell; 2. Fatty material, cholestrine, oleic, and margaric acid; 3. Cholic acid; 4. Biliary resin; 5. Taurin or biliary asparagin; 6. Picromel; 7. Yellow co- louring matter; 8. Extractive matters, osmazome, pty- aline, &c.; 9. Casein, an albuminous matter, and mucus; 10. Bicarbonate of soda, carbonate of ammonia, acetate of soda, oleate, margarate, chelate, sulphate, and phos- phate of potash and soda, chloride of sodium, and phos- phate of lime. This fluid performs several important functions in the animal economy; thus, it decarbonizes the blood, saponifies the fatty matter of the chyle, also animalizes it, and separates this last product from the chyme; it stimulates the intestines to throw out their peculiar secretion; it also excites their peristaltic action, and in some measure deodorizes the excrementitious re- sidual portion. The liver is developed by a conical protrusion from the hollow intestine, and during the first month of in- tra-uterine life is one-half of the weight of the entire body; but from this period it ceases to enlarge with the same rapidity, while the other organs rapidly increasing, the disparity is reduced from one-half to one-eighteenth at the time of birth, when an actual diminution appears to take place in its size, particularly in its left lobe, sup- posed to depend in a great measure on the obliteration of the umbilical vein, which deprives it of the great572 CAVITY OF THE ABDOMEN. mass of nutrition whicli it received in its foetal condi- tion. To understand this clearly it will, therefore, be necessary to give a brief sketch of the fcetal circulation, and the changes which it undergoes to assimilate it to the adult. FffiTAL Circulation During the period of intra- uterine life, when the respiratory function is in abey- ance, the oxydation of the blood must depend upon the agency of some other organ besides the lung, and this is known to be the placenta, an extensive structure which occupies generally the upper part of the uterus, not exactly coeval with the existence of the embryo, but appearing to be formed completely about three months after conception by the gradual concentration of the villosities of the chorion at one particular point. In it ramify the umbilical arteries of the foetus, carry- ing at that period venous blood, the capillaries in which they terminate being remarkable for their minute size and the tenuity of their coats. These are frequently brought into contact with the uterine vessels, which at this period approximate closely to the inner wall of the cavity, and are equally conspicuous for their tortuosity, extreme caliber, and delicacy of their tunics; and the mutual approximation of the maternal and foetal vessels, thus favoured by their particular construction, permits an exosmotic and endosmotic action to proceed, removing the effete production from the one, and imparting the vivifying principle to the other. Divested in this man- ner of its impurities, the blood is taken up by the ra- dicles of the umbilical vein, which converge, and ulti- mately coalesce for its formation, and is carried by this vessel through the umbilicus of the infant, which is at this period patulous, to the horizontal fissure of the liver, in which the vein passes backwards as far as the transverse. At this point it throws off three branches to its left lobe and a single one to the right; the latter being remarkable, from the fact of its becoming directly continuous with the porta, the circulation of which at this time is only imperfectly established, its right branches constituting the right umbilical, to supply the corresponding lobe. Reduced considerably in size by throwing off these offsets, the umbilical vein continues its573 F(ETAL CIRCULATION, course backwards, and unites witli one of the vense cavse hepaticae, by which its contents is ultimately poured into the ascending cava, and by it is conveyed into the right auricle of the heart. In the description of this organ it has been already explained that an aperture exists at this period in the septum auricularum (fora- men ovale), and that this is provided with a peculiar structure (Eustachian valve) which has a tendency to direct the blood from the cava immediately from the right into the left auricle, from which it passes into the adjacent ventricle, to be propelled from it into the arch of the aorta; by the three great branches which spring from the upper portion of this tube it is next conveyed to the head, neck, and upper extremity, and, having supplied these several parts, the effete blood is carried back by the superior cava to the right auricle, but does not mingle with that of the inferior, but passes directly through the auriculo-ventricular opening into the right ventricle; from this it is propelled into the pulmonary artery, a small portion proceeding by its right and left branches to the lungs, but its greater volume is carried by the ductus arteriosus to the arch of the aorta, which it joins a little below the junction of its transverse with its descending portion, and there, mingling with the re- sidue of the purer stream which was more than suffi- cient for the head and neck, it proceeds downwards through the great arterial trunk to its bifurcation into, the common iliacs; passing through these to their divi- sion into external and internal, a part proceeds through the former for the supply of the lower extremity, while the remainder, the larger portion, is carried by the lat- ter, the hypogastric of this period, along the side of the bladder up to the umbilicus, which it pierces, and then, coiling around the umbilical vein, it reaches the pla- centa, to submit its contents to the vivifying process of that structure. It will be observed from this brief sketch that there is only one organ in the foetus that receives pure blood, and this indeed only partially—the left lobe of the liver^ —that of the right being more or less imbued with that of the porta. It will be borne in mind that at the point where the umbilical vein discharges its contents into574 CAVITY OF THE ABDOMEN. the cava, this latter vessel is more or less filled with the effete blood of the lower extremity, and hence naturally ensues a mixed fluid, which, pursuing the course already indicated, is destined for the supply of the upper por- tion of the trunk, while the lower receives a stream still more degenerated, owing to its admixture with the re- turning venous blood of the former. The appearance presented by the infant at birth serves to confirm in a great measure the correctness of this scheme of the cir- culation, as there exists a marked disparity in the de- velopment of its upper and lower parts, showing the excess of nutrition Avhich the former receives when com- pared with the latter; the enormous size of the liver, too, would aid in strengthening the theory. The par- tially oxydized condition of the blood at this period of existence can be only compared to the state of the cir- culation as exemplified in the reptile. But with the first inhalation of the atmospheric air a change rapidly ensues: the lungs expand and protrude the elastic walls of the thorax, at the same time forcing downwards the diaphragm, thus causing a species of vacuum to which the blood, gorging the right side of the heart and pul- monary trunk, finds a readier access than pursuing its original course through the ductus arteriosus, which now becomes useless, and, pressed on by the left bron- chus, is gradually converted into a ligamentous cord. Ramifying over the air-cells, and receiving its vital pro- perties from their contents, it is again brought back to the heart by the pulmonary veins, which thus distend the left auricle with their blood, at the same moment that the right is filled with that from the two cava;. The equable pressure thus produced on the valvular opening of the fossa ovalis either causes its complete occlusion, or at least prevents any admixture from taking place between the two currents. Independent existence now established, the ligature encircles the placental ves- sels thus severing the bond of union that connected it to the parent; while the portal circulation, assuming its proper activity, renders useless the ductus venosus, which is ultimately obliterated completely by the pres- sure of the diaphragm as it gradually descends. _ Spleen occupies the left hypochondriac region m itsSPLEEN. 575 ordinary condition, except in cases of enlargement, to which it is very liable, when it may either press over to the right side or downwards. In its natural state it weighs from three to seven or eight ounces, and is simi- lar in figure to an ellipse divided longitudinally; it accordingly presents for examination an internal and external surface, and a circumference. The external surface is convex, and lies in contact with the cartilages of the four inferior ribs, from which, however, it is sepa- rated by the fleshy fibres of the diaphragm; the internal is concave, presenting nearly in the centre a deep de- pression, known as the hylus, through which the arte- ries enter for its supply; it is in relation with the great ' extremity of the stomach, splenic vessels, and vasa bre- via, gastro-splenic omentum, tail of pancreas, supra- ; renal capsule, and occasionally with the left lobe of the 1 liver; Its superior edge corresponds to the diaphracrm 1 Its posterior to the left kidney, its inferior to the ancrle ^ of the colon, and its anterior to the stomach. It is 1 kept in position by a layer of peritoneum from the dia- ;phragm, by another from the large end of the stomach (gastro-splenic omentum), as well as by its own arteries ;and the pressure of the adjacent parts. The spleen, like the liver, has only two coats, an ex- (ternal serous and an internal fibrous. The former in- vests It completely, except at the hylus, where it is ' deficient for the passage of the vessels for its supply conferring on it a smooth surface externally, which per- rmits It to glide with facility, and accommodate itself to • those changes of position to which it is so constantly liable from the condition of the stomach, whether dis- ttended or otherwise, to which it is connected. This •tunic IS closely adherent to the fibrous, from which, it can with difficulty be detached Fibrous Coat. This is thin, transparent, but strong, .and IS not only closely united to the peritoneal, but ■ likewise to the spleen itself, into which it sends innu- rmerable prolongations, which interlace with each other 1 in every possible manner, converting the entire organ iinto a series of cells, which appear to communicate with •each other only in certain proportions, and not com- ipletely. On arriving at the hylus it does not terminate576 CAVITY OF THE ABDOMEN. abruptly, but it forms sheaths for the vessels, which continue to inclose them in all their minute ramifica- tions to their ultimate termination. The spleen must be considered as composed of several lobules, and this may be distinctly shown by injection. The artery which supplies it is very large, and before it penetrates into its substance usually subdivides into five or six branches; these may be injected with fluids of difi'erent colours, which will only tinge their own immediate compartments, unless too great a force be employed, when they may become blended together by the consequent rupture. The manner m which the arterial capillaries terminate is not clearly understood; it is, however, generally believed that they are tufted or pencillate, discharging their blood into the cellwork of the spleen by a kind of exudation; these cells being filled with small pulpy masses, the ulterior ramification of the vein, constituting a species of venous erectile tissue which pervades the entire organ. There can be no question but the veins communicate with the ceils much more freely than the arteries, a fact which may be proved by endeavouring to distend the spleen by a co- lumn of water of similar weight being introduced by either vessels, when it will be found that its maximum pitch of distention will be accomplished much more rapidly from the one than from the other. MaLighian CoEPUSCLES._The existence of these small bodies have at one period been demed, at another affirmed, in the human subject. They are, however, verv evident in the ox, sheep, and pig, ymg m con- tact with the venous cells, and occasionally appearing to be connected to the arteries by short sjalk-like pro- cesses. They were looked on by Malpighi as of ome importance, i effecting certain changes - the splenic blood, a fact which, however, requires confirmation Th; spleen is a lymphatico-vascular gland, aiid accord- ingly! has no special ducts.

Its enlargement in certain diseases of the liver would seem to prove that it is in- fluenced m some measure by the condition of that <rland while again its enormous increase of size in intermit- tent fever would tend to establish the fact that it is more or less concerned in equalizing the circulation ge- nerally. Under all these circumstances, it may be faiPly admitted, that its peculiar properties require further elucidation, and that any opinions which have hitherto been broached concerning it will scarcely bear the test ot a rigid scrutiny. PANCREAS. This viscus is placed transversely in the abdominal fZ7k ^' at the same time obliquely, so as to occupy the left hypochondriac region, the epigastric, and um- bilical. In figure it is triangular and flattened, and it . has been divided into a head, body, and tail; the colour i IS pmkish grey, and it appears to be divided on its sur- face into a series of irregular lobules faintly mapped out 1 by a number of wavy lines; its head, which is thick and ■ rounded, lies in contact with the concavity of the duo ' denum, but is separated in some measure from it by its .own duct, the ductus communis choledochus and pan- > creatico-duodenalis artery; its tail is much smaller, and - corresponds to the hollow of the spleen; its posterior 9, r578 CAVITY OF THE ABDOMEN. surface, concave, lies on the right cms of the diaphragm, the portal and caval veins, semilunar ganglion, aorta, left crus, with the splenic and mesenteric veins, left su- prarenal capsule and kidney; it also rests partially on the superior mesenteric artery, which tilts forwards its inferior margin; its anterior surface, convex, is in rela- tion with the stomach, but is separated from it by the ascending layer of the transverse mesocolon and sac of the omentum; its superior margin, nearly straight, cor- responds to the superior transverse portion of the duo- denum, lobulus Spigelii of liver, hepatic and splenic ar- teries,—the latter grooving it deeply,—and caahac axis; its inferior, to the second transverse portion of the duodenum, superior mesenteric artery, which emerges from beneath it, and attachment of root of mesentery; this margin is sometimes rendered very irregular by a process which springs from it near its head, passes downwards and to the left side, beneath the superior mesenteric artery, and, after embracing it again be- comes continuous with the body; this has been called the lesser pancreas. . , , The pancreas crosses the spinal column opposite tlie first lumbar vertebra, and is very firmly fixed in its po- sition bv the cEeliac axis and superior mesenteric arte- ries, as well as by the ascending layer of the transverse mesocolon, which confines it closely to the back part of the abdominal cavity. In order to examine its duct (canal of Wirsung), the anterior surface of the gland should be very cautiously removed from one extremity to the other to a depth a little beyond its centre; it will be known at once by its milk-white colour, which contrasts strikingly with the general hue of the gland, in the tail of which it will be observed to commence, generally double, being very small at first but gradu- ally increasing in size as it approaches its head ; at thi point it bends downwards and to the right side ,and onens either into the duodenum directly or umtes very Sue y w'th the ductus communis choledochus imme- dia elv before thelatter perforates the gut; occasionally a second duct is present from the lesser pancreas, and tlS mav either terminate in the ordinary manner or by a era-te%erture in the gut.

Its gradually increasing caliber from its commencement to its termi- nation IS accounted for from the fact of its receiving successively the smaller ducts, from the glandules of which the pancreas is composed, that open into it sepa- rately and give it the appearance of a centipede, to which It iias been very aptly compared. In structure the pancreas closely resembles the sali- vary glands, which have already been fully described hav- ing like them. Its lobules separated by fine fibrous tissue each containmg its follicles of secretion, with its ac' companying cell apparatus for the elimination of its peculiar fluid, which is derived from its proper vessels the splenic, superior mesenteric, and hepatic. An evi' dent analogy likewise exists in the secretions of the pancreatic and salivary glands; but the former contain more solid ingredients, as albumen and caseine has acid re-action, and no sulpho-cyanate of potassa, while the contrary, the saliva possesses the latter, as well as an abundance of salivin and mucus, which is sparingly tound in the pancreas.

In addition to a thin fibrous membrane analogous to that of the kidney, which forms its outer envelope, these bodies are composed of two distinct structures,_an ex- ternal or cortical, and an internal or medullary. Ihe first is of a yellowish colour, consisting of a series ol fibres arranged parallel to each other, formed both by the arteries, by which it is very copiously supphed, as well as by c^cal tubules of basement membrane, which are found on examination to contain cell germs and fat cells in various stages of development. 1 he medullary tissue is principally constituted by a dilated venous plexus, which receives the blood from the arterial branches already alluded to, and a quantity of minute cavTties, containing a reddish, gray fluid; while these are bound together by a proper parenchyma, m which are interspersed an abundance of cells displaying dif- ferent degrees of maturity.

That they may be of some use as a diverticulum during renal congestion (Carpenter) seems to be very probable, and appears to be the most rational of any of the conjectural theories that have as yet been advanced on the subject. It is a curious fact that malposition of the kidney, or atrophy of that organ, never has any influence in altering the situation of the suprarenal capsule, or diminishing or increasing its or- dinary size. KIDNEYS. These two organs are situated in the lumbar regions on either side, corresponding to the two last dorsaf and two first lumbar vertebra?, but not exactly on the same plane, as the left is always placed a little higher than the right, which is more or less depressed by the liver. They are not exactly parallel to each other, but con- verge superiorly and diverge inferiorly; neither do they he perfectly flat, but are so disposed that one sur- face looks forwards and outwards, the other backwards and inwards; in size, too, they are very variable, but their usual weight is from three to four ounces each, while in shape they resemble very closely a French bean. In order to understand more properly their re- lations, we will give them an anterior and posterior sur- face, an external or convex, and an internal or concave margin, and a superior and inferior extremity. The posterior surface is recognised immediately by its Hatness as contrasted with the anterior. On both sides it rests on the quadratus lumborum, from which It IS separated by the anterior layer of the transversalis aponeurosis, ilio-scrotal, and last dorsal nerves; on the psoas magnus and posterior edge of the diaphra-m, which intervenes between it and the last ribs. Its an- terior is very convex, and corresponds on the right side to the ascending colon, vertical portion of duode- num, and under surface of the liver, which overlaps it superiorly; on the left to the descending colon and mass of the small intestines. Its superior extremity is in relation with the liver, but separated from it by itsCAVITY OF THE ABDOMEN. 582 corresponding suprarenal capsule on the right side, with the spleen on the left, but divided from it by the same organ; on the right the caecum lies immediately below it; on the left the sigmoid flexure. Their external margin, which is very convex, corresponds to the abdo- minal wall; their internal, which is concave, and termed the hylus, for the passage of—from before, backwards, and above downwards—the renal vein, artery, and ureter, posteriorly being more deeply notched, has in- ternal to it, on the right—the vena cava, and on the left—the aorta. These organs are retained in position by the peritoneum, which is reflected over them, by the fatty tissue in which they are buried, by the large blood- vessels which pierce them, and by the pressure of sur- rounding parts. Coats.—'The kidneys have three tunics,—an external or serous, a middle or cellulo-adipose, and an internal or proper fibrous. The first, which is derived from the peritoneum, is very incomplete, merely covering it an- teriorly and partially on its margins, and can be re- moved from it without much difiiculty, its principal use apparently being to bind it to the posterior Avail of the abdomen. The adipose coat is developed very spa- ringly in the human subject, but is generated in great abundance in quadrupeds; it is always very irregular in its distribution, but is usually found in greater quan- tity on the posterior than the anterior aspect of the or- gan. The proper capsule is composed of thin but strong fibrous tissue; it completely invests the whole organ, and on reaching the hylus forms sheaths for the several vessels that pass in through it, becoming contmuous with the fibrous envelopes and septa wilhin the organ. It likewise throws off" numerous thin processes exter- nally, that become blended with the fat, and assist in maintaining this structure in its proper position. Either kidney may be now removed irom its po- sition, and a longitudinal incision made completely through it from its convex to its concave border taking care, however, that the knive is carried directly through the centre, so as to expose fully all its constituent parts The cut surfaces maybe now washed beneath a stream cf water, and examined. In the section of the healthy583 KIDNEYS. kidney made in the manner just described, two struc- tures, very different in their outline and general ap- pearance, are brought into view,—the one lying external, of a reddish colour, the cortical; the other disposed in triangular masses of a pale, livid hue,—the medullary. Those latter vary from six to twelve in number, and were first described by Malpighi, and have since been known as the pyramids of that anatomist. The bases of the entire of them are turned outwards towards the cortical substance, while thin processes of the latter structure are sent down between them, isolating them from each other, while they terminate inferiorly in a blunted extremity, termed a mammilla or papilla, each lobule thus constituting a separate kidney in fcetal ex- istence, an arrangement which is persistent in a great majority of the lower classes of animals during their entire period of existence. Bellini and Belingheri were the anatomists who first distinctly pointed out that those pyramidal masses were composed of a series of urini- ferous tubules, and hence they are generally known by the name of the latter (tubes of Bellini); but it was reserved for Ferrein to give a true theory with respect to their ultimate disposition. According to him, each single tubule of Bellini consists of an aggregate of smaller ducts, amounting in the majority ot^instances to one hundred, in consequence of their dividing in di- chotoraous order as they advance from the apex to the base of the Malpighian pyramid, while they are bound together by a thin fibrous sheath. On reachino- the cortical structure, he described them as passino- into it and becoming twisted and convoluted like the tendrils ot a vine, and at last terminating in flask-like extremi- ties, or by forming a loop with an adjacent one. If we now direct our attention to the cortical substance, we will observe that it invests the whole kidney to a depth varying from a quarter to half an inch, sending, as has been already observed, processes inwards between the several tubular cones. In structure it is composed of the ramifications of the renal artery, vein, and convo- luted tubes already alluded to; and in order properly to understand its arrangement, a few brief remarks must be made on the distribution of those vessels.CAVITY OF THE ABDOMEN. 584 The Renal Artery, an extremely large branch of the abdominal aorta, before entering the hylus of the kidney generally breaks up into five or six divisions, vfhich, on penetrating the organ, pass outwards between the conical masses, sending oflF a few long, straight branches, which ramify between and run parallel to the ducts of which they are composed, while the principal trunk continues its course towards the external or cor- tical structure, on reaching which it divides into two distinct sets of branches, one being destined for the sup- ply of the gland, its effete blood being taken up by the corresponding capillary veins, while the other (the af- ferent vessel) pursues its course to the flask-like dilata- tion of the convoluted tube, the wall of which it perfo- rates, and, becoming dilated, forms a complicated plexus ■within its cavity (the Malpighian tuft). Its dilatation and plexiform arrangement within the expanded extre- mity of the duct naturally produces a stasis of its con- tained blood, a condition most favourable for the exu- dation of its more fluid contents; and this is further increased by the small size of the efferent vein, which emerges from the dilated tvibe by an orifice much more contracted than that by which the artery had entered, an arrangement calculated to maintain a state of con- gestion admirably adapted for the exosmosis of the se- rous portion of the blood,—or in other words, the wa- tery constituent of the urine, which is urged into the tube by the continued action of a series of cilise, which are constantly in motion and propelling it onwards. The efferent vein, which emerges from the pouch, removing the efete blood of the Malpighian tuft, has been compared by Mr. Bowman to the portal vein of the liver; it unites almost immediately with the capillary vein of the nutritive artery of the gland, and the common trunk constituted by their union forms frequent plexuses with the convoluted uriniferous tube of Ferrein; and these vessels (we allude to the duct and vein) holding fluids of such different degrees of density, transudation is the natural result from their mutual contact one with the other (Dutrochet), and by this means the more solid contents of the urine are eliminated from the blood 1 he fluid thus formed is conveyed downwards through theKIDNEYS. 585 several tubes to the apex of the Malpighian pyramid, and is distilled in minute quantities from the small ori- fices of the papillae into the calyces, which we will now proceed to describe. Calyces are small, cup-like cavities, with their open mouths turned externally, and embracing one, two, or three papillae, of which they receive tlie contents. They are composed of a thin but strong fibrous sheath exter- nally, and are lined by mucous membrane internally; in number they are variable, but generally average from six to seven, and they terminate towards the hylus of the kidney in a small, funnel-shaped process, which, unitmg with an adjacent one, constitutes an infundibu- lum. These latter are short, thick tubes, and are almost invariably three in number,_a superior, middle, and an inferior. Of these the first is the longest, and the se- cond the shortest. They are composed precisely of the same structures as the calyces, and their convergence at the hylus, and ultimate union, constitute the com- mencement of the ureter, or, as it has been termed the pelvis. ' The urine, secreted from the kidney, is carried to the bladder, the rgservoir for its temporary reception by the ureters. These tubes are from fifteen to eighteen inches in length, and are nearly as large in caliber as a , goose-quill. As they pass downwards and inwards towards the true pelvis, they rest upon the psoas mus- . cle, bifurcation of the common iliac arteries, into ex- I ternal and internal, with their accompanying veins, and I the obturator vessels and nerves. They lie behind the i peritoneal sac, and are crossed at a very acute angle > while in the abdomen by the spermatic vessels; as they descend into the pelvis they pass behind the last coil ot the ilium on the right side, and the sigmoid flexure sand superior hemorrhoidal artery on the right- are inext enveloped in the posterior false liijaments of the tbladder, which conduct them to that organ, Avhere they mre crossed in front by the vasa deferentia, then pierc- ung the coats of the bladder, and, running forabout three- 'jquarters of an inch between them, they open at the ex- •tremity of the base of the trigone by a valvular orifice II he ureters have three tunics,_an external or peritoneal 2 c 3586 CAVITY OF THE ABDOMEN. a middle or fibrous, and an internal or mucous. The first of these, or the serous, is very imperfect, covering it only anteriorly, but still adhering to it with some degree of tenacity; the second, or fibrous, is derived from the proper capsule of the kidney, it invests it completely, is extremely dense, and also possesses much strength; it does not terminate abruptly at the hylus, but is prolonged into the substance of the kidney, forming the external envelopes of the infundibula, ca- lyces, &c. The third, or mucous layer, is remarkable for its pale character and peculiar tenuity; it is merely a prolongation upwards of the internal coat of the blad- der, which, after lining the ureters, is inflected in suc- cession into the infundibula, calyces, uriniferous ducts, and ultimately into the convoluted tubes of Ferrein, where it terminates in those pouch-like csecal processes already alluded to. In this latter situation they are lined by small epithelial cells with oval nuclei, but at the patulous extremity of the flask-like dilatation these o-ive place to the ciliated variety, which is again suc- ceeded in those of the cortical structure by the pave- ment form, angular and coarsely granular; in the tubes of the medullary structure they diminish in size, and display evident nuclei, surrounded by a very narrow The Kidneys, exactly as in the lower classes of animals, are developed from peculiar embryonic structures, termed the Wolflaan bodies after the name of their discoverer. These make their appearance towards the end of the first month, but it is near the end of the second before the rudiment of the kidney is visible, and during the third, the latter organ continues to increase rapidly in size while the former diminishes in a similar ratio, so that at birth scarcely a vestige of them remains. At the twelfth week the kidney consists of from eight to twelve lobules, which are destined to form the future pyramids, and these are loosely connected together by lax areolar tissue, but which afterwards become more firmly united by a condensation of this substance, so that at length the lobulated appearance is completely obli- terated. The Wolffian bodies are highly vascular-, they receive four or five large branches from the abdominalFEMALE ORGANS OF GENERATION. 587 aorta, and their effete blood is returned to the cava by two large veins, the superior of which, with its corres- ponding artery, afterwards forms the renal vessels; the inferior, with its accompanying artery,—the spermatic. The Wolffian bodies are placed on either side of the spinal column, and are composed of a series of ctecal ap- pendages or pouches, which present a convoluted ap- pearance, interspersed with numerous darker points, which are small plexuses of blood-vessels, closely coiled on themselves, the analogues of the future Malpighian tufts. The excretory ducts, with those from the kid- ney and sexual organs, form a common canal, and this again, with that from the rectum, opens into the cloaca or sinus urino-genitalis, the sides of which latter, by their gradual approximation and subsequent union, ultimately forni a septum of division between the rectum and genito-urinary organs; the urethra of the female is af- terwards isolated from the vagina by a similar process. The Urine, the fluid eliminated from the blood by the kidneys, is of an amber colour, emitting a peculiar odour, and in health having a specific gravity of about 1011. According to Berzelius it is composed of:—1. Wa- ter; 2. Solid residue; 3. Urea; 4, Uric acid; 5. Lactic acid, lactate of ammonia, alcohol, and water extract; 6. Mucus; 7. Sulphate of potash; 8. Sulphate of soda; 9. Phosphate of soda; 10. Biphosphate of ammonia; 11. Chloride of sodium; 12. Chloride of ammonium; 13, Phosphate of lime and magnesia; 14, Silicic acid. Be- sides removing these products from the blood, which, by their deleterious agency might exercise an injurious influence on the body generally, the kidneys act an im- portant part in equalizing the circulation by abstract- ing the excess of serum from the vessels, which would otherwise increase to an immoderate extent. FEMALE ORGANS OF GENERATION. The Female Organs of Generation are divided into copulative and formative, or external and internal, the former consisting of the mons veneris, labia majora and mmora, clitoris, and the vagina; but the last cannot pro- perly be stated to belong to either division exclu- /588 CAVITY OF THE ABDOMEN. sively; the latter include the uterus and its appendages, or peritoneal ligaments, and Fallopian tubes, with the ovaries. MoNS Veneris is formed by the prominent pubic symphisis, covered by a strong layer of integument, a cushion of dense fatty matter being interposed between them; the surface is studded by strong hairs at the age of puberty. Labia 'Majora are two tumid folds of integument continuous before with the mous, and behind uniting to constitute the fourchette, inclosing a space between them of an elliptical figure, named the vulva: externally they are flattened, being much thicker before than be- hind, and are covered by scattered hairs, internally being smooth and lined by a mucous membrane, while anteriorly and internally they lie in contact with each other. The areolar tissue interposed between the folds of integument is lax and much disposed to oedema in difficult parturition; and the vessels also, being slightly supported, sometimes rupture, producing the disease termed "thrombus," as described by Dr. Montgomery. Posterior to the fourchette, and anterior to the anus, there exists a space from three-quarters to an inch in width, where the skin, fine, thin, and highly elastic, pre- sents a brownish colour, and forms the perineum. Labia Minora will be exposed by separating the ma- jora, internal to which they lie, being formed of a dou- ble fold of mucous membrane, commencing at the inner surface of the great labia; small at first, they gradually increase as they ascend, then divide into two folds, one of which is attached to the clitoris, while the other unites with its fellow, above that point forming the prteputium clitoridis. The mucous membrane forming these folds is highly vascular, and furnished with a num- ber of simple follicles that lubricate the surface with a continual secretion. The labia minora are large m the infant, and particularly so in the Hottentot, where they project beyond the majora; we have seen them altoge- ther absent. , i • ^ Clitoris appears as a projecting tubercle hal -an-incli below and behind the anterior commissure of the vulva, bounded above by the union of the nymphaj, and theFEMALE ORGANS OF GENERATION. 589 surface is covered by a vascular mucous membrane, which is exceedingly sensitive; its structure will be better understood by raising the integument of the labia majora and the mucous membrane of the nymphae, and then cleaning away some areolar tissue. It will now become apparent that the clitoris is formed by the union of the crura clitoridis, resembling in many respects the crura penis; they arise narrow from the rami of the is- chium and pubis, run upwards, forwards, and inwards, converging, and about a line in front of the symphisis pubis they join, then curve a little downwards, and terminate in a pointed extremity, convex superiorly and posteriorly, concave inferiorly, and presenting a groove below, in which the urethra is lodged. On the surface of these tubes of erectile tissue a small erector is visible, and the sphincter vaginte splits superiorly to inclose the clitoris, resembling the accelerator muscle in the male. Meatus Urinarius.—Tiis opening is situated about an inch below the clitoris, and immediately above the anterior edge of the vagina, being full, prominent, and projecting m the adult, but depressed in the old sub- ject. It is always closed, except during micturition. Vagina—This is a membranous canal, extending from the uterus above to the vulva inferiorly, con- stituting the organ of copulation in the female. The whole canal is conical in shape, large above, narrow and constricted inferiorly, curved, with its concavity • directed upwards and forwards, and placed in the axis of the pelvis, the anterior wall being about four inches, and the posterior five; it presents for descrip- tion an anterior and posterior, with two lateral sur- faces, and a uterine and vulvar extremity; anteriorly It corresponds to the base of the bladder, to which it . is united by areolar tissue, and a process of the vesical I fascia, while more inferiorly it receives the urethra in la grooved canal in its structure; posteriorly it corre- ssponds to the recto-vaginal pouch of the peritoneum in I Its upper fourth, and in the remainder to the rectum ;to which it is united by lax areolar tissue; laterally it tcorresponds to the broad ligament of the uterus and !more mleriorly to the fibres of the levator ani; the su- iperior or uterine extremity embraces the cervix uteri590 CAVITY OF THE ABDOMEN. towhicliitseems to be attached by the peritoneum exter- nally and posteriorly, and internally by the continuity of the mucous membrane, and intermediately by the fusion of the fibrous layers of the canal with the elastic tissue of the cervix uteri; the inferior or vulvar extre- mity is usually closed and compressed laterally, being surrounded by the sphincter vaginse, which, arising from the sphincter ani, and a dense tendinous point poste- riorly, divides into two portions that surround the ex- tremity of the vagina, and uniting again in front, but again separating, ascend to be inserted into the dor- sum of the clitoris. Structure The vagina is composed of five distinct layers, which are,—most internally, mucous; then inter- nal, fibrous; external to this, erectile layer; still more externally, the external fibrous coat; and lastly, an areolo-contractile tissue resembling the dartos. The mucous layer is continued from the vulvar, covermg the sphincter vaginae, and forming in the virgin asemi- elliptical fold at the orifice, named the hymen, which occupies generally the posterior or inferior fourth of the opening when expanded, but in some cases forming a complete occluding membrane, with a small aperture m the centre, or this last may even be absent m some cases, constituting imperforate hymen. This struc- ture is peculiar to the human species only, and never to- tally'absent in the virgin state; but where the hymen ceases to exist a few small projecting tubercles (carun- culffi myrtiformes) mark its ruptured remains, btiii tracino- the membrane within the canal, its vascularity diminrshes, while its surface is marked by transverse folds which are more numerous inferiorly, and on these are observed the openings of themucous glands of the va- ffin^; two longitudinal folds (columns vagina) are like- wise present on its anterior and posterior walls. The mu- cous lining having now reached the upper part ol the canal, is reflected downwards on the surface ot the cer- vix uteri, and into the os, becoming here much finer and paler, and at the same time more adherent to the sub- jacent structures, while by its reflection [7;^ ^he va- gina on the uterus, a circular sulcus is left between fhose parts, much deeper before than behind. Ihis membi-ane appears to be merely an extension of theFEMALE ORGANS OF GENERATION. 591 skin, the epithelium on its surface being squamous or cuneiform; the secretion has an acid re-action, beino- destitute of mucous corpuscles, and in many diseased conditions containing a peculiar animalcule, described by Donne as the trichomonos vaginse; vibirones are also seen in this secretion, associated, like the former, with puriform exudation. Internal Fibrous Layer.—This is stronger above than below, and loosely attached to the mucous layer. Erectile Layer resembles somewhat in structure the corpus spongiosum urethree, inferiorly being thick and well marked, the veins forming an intricate network on its surface, but superiorly scarcely visible in the majority of instances, while it becomes atrophied in old age. External Fibrous Layer—This tubule is derived from the vesical fascia; strong and dense below, it serves to support the vaginal venous plexuses, whilst above it is mcorporated with the cervix uteri. In addition to the foregoing the peritoneum constitutes a partial se- rous mvestment on the superior fourth of the posterior surface of the canal. Dartoid Layer surrounds the canal, and also con- nects it to the contiguous organs; it possesses a con- tractile power analogous to the similar tissue in the scrotum of the male, assisting in the resiliency of the vagina, when that tube has been distended. Vessels—The vaginal arteries are two in number, arising from the internal iliac, which course alono- the sides of the canal, while branches of the vesicaf and middle hemorrhoidal are also distributed to it The veins communicate with the vesical and ha^morrhoidal plexuses, before entering the internal iliac. Nerves.—These are derived from two sources, namely --the sacra plexus of the spinal, and the hypogastric of the sympathetic. The Uterus is of a pyriform figure, situated ob- liquely m the axis of the true pelvis, the base being directed upwards and forwards, the os downwards and backwards, the anterior surface flattened, looking down- wards and forwards, the posterior more convex up- wards and backwards; its measurement being in length592 CAVITY OF THE ABDOMEN. about two and a half or three inches; the width at the base from one inch and a half to two inches, and the thickness from three-quarters to an inch. It is divided into a fundus, body, neck, and os, the two latter being contained within the vagina. The os is bounded before and behind by two prominent lips, the former being the thickest, the latter the longer of the two; the included opening is circular in the virgin, but trans- versely oval in those who have borne many children. After this general description of the organ the student may now proceed to the examination of its connexions. Many causes tend to preserve it in situ, and prevent any displacement, namely,—the pressure of surrounding parts, also the structures closing the outlet of the pel- vis, as the rectum, vagina, levatores ani, and coccygeal muscles, triangular and sciatic ligament; and in addition to these the elasticity of the organ tends to restore it to its original position, when displaced by temporary pressure. But its ligaments exercise the most important influence in preserving its relative connexions to those parts which surround it. These are eight in number, namely, round, broad or lateral, recto-uterine, and vesico- uterine, each of the two latter being double. The round ligament arises from the lateral and superior angle of the uterus, in front of the Fallppian tube, passes upwards, outwards, and forwards, runs through the internal ring, inguinal canal, external ring, and is attached to the spine of the pubis, whilst some small nerves and vessels which it contains are lost in the la- bia majora. Within the abdomen a process of perito- neum is continued on the ligament, and often remains pervious as far as the external ring, constituting the canal of Nuck; and recently muscular fibres have been described on the surface of the ligament, which by their contraction may gradually draw the gravid uterus downwards into the pelvic cavity. We could only de- tect these fibres lor one inch from the uterine extre- mity The use of these ligaments evidently seems to be for the purpose of preserving the uterus in the direct axis of the pelvic cavity. Broad LiGAMENT.-This is a double fold of perito- neum, extending from the lateral and superior angle otFEMALE ORGANS OF GENERATION. 593 the uterus, the side of that organ, and superior part of the vagina on the one hand, to the side of the pelvis on the other. It resembles in some degree a bat's wing when unfolded, and it contains between its layers the round ligament most anteriorly, the Fallopian tube in the centre, with the ovary and its ligament behind. Recto-uterine Ligaments are constituted by the folds of serous membrane connecting these organs, and forming the lateral boundaries of the recto-uterine cul de sac. Vesico-uterine Ligaments possess a structure simi- lar to the last described, and form the sides of that smaller cul de sac which lies between the bladder and uterus. These serous duplicatures are extremely lax, permitting the uterus when enlarged to expand between their layers without distending the serous membrane. _ Now make a section of the uterus vertically, separa- t ting it into an anterior and posterior half, and we will 1 thus be enabled to observe the form of the cavity which It contains. Taking the body and fundus together, : they exhibit a cavity of a triangular form, the narrow ;part being inferiorly, the wide portion diverging su- iperiorly and laterally towards the openings of the Fal- ilopian tubes, a slight constriction indicated by a circular ^elevated line separating the body from the cervix; this lis named os uteri internum, the cavity of the cervix ^afterwards expanding gradually and again contracting iat the OS uteri externum. The uterus has three coats,— rfirst, mucous; second, muscular; third, serous. The nmucous lining is thin and fine on the os, but as it as- cends into the cervix, it forms a posterior and anterior :(told, and from these numerous oblique crests pass off, on which the glandular Nabothi are very copiously dis- :tributed,—this arrangement is named the arbor vitte, but when the mucous layer ascends to the fundus, it as- -sumes a very different aspect, becoming fine and pale iLike a serous structure, still, however, possessing a well- raarked system of follicles, but notwithstanding these circumstances the continuity which can be traced be- iween this membrane and the Fallopian tube, together ■with the plastic exudation from its surface which super- ivenes on conception, would seem to ally it, at least func-594 CAVITY OF THE ABDOMEN. tionally, with the serous tissues; at the menstrual pe- riod this membrane becomes highly vascular, a condi- tion which again subsides with the termination of that secretion. MuscuLA R TiiNTCS.—In theunimpregnated organ these are difficult to detect, but at the third month of utero- gestation their arrangement can be very well observed, consisting of a superficial and deep set of fibres, which cover the anterior and posterior surfaces of the organ, whilst on the sides they follow a curved direction; they appear to be inserted below into the elastic tissue of the cervix, not abruptly terminating at that point, but con- tinuing into its structure, intermixing with the elastic fiibres observed in this situation. The deep set of fibres are made up in two cones, deficient internally and meeting in a raphe on the anterior and posterior sur- face, the base of each being turned upwards, the apex downwards or towards the os, the fibres all assuming a circular course. In the cervix the structure is ob- viously of an elastic nature, although in some cases we have traced weak and indistinct prolongations of the longitudinal muscular fibres into its tissue, but never in sufficient numbers to affect the general statement as to the fibro-elastic elements of its composition. Peritoneal Layer.—This membrane covers the body and fundus of the organ, but is deficient on the cervix and OS, also where the round and ovarian ligaments, with the Fallopian tubes, are attached. _ Fallopian Tubes.—These are symmetrical, and arise from the lateral and superior angle of the uterus, be- tween the round and ovarian ligaments. They are from three to four inches in length, taking a direction at first downwards and outwards, and then turning back- wards; they present for description two extremities,--a uterine and an ovarian, the former commencing from the fundus uteri by an opening capable of admitting a small probe or bristle, the latter dilated and fringed like the. tentacula of a polype; of these fimbria one is long, rarely on the same line with the others, and is attached to the capsule of the ovary, whilst the remainder are free and floating. The tunics of the tube consist of a serous, muscular, and mucous investment. The muscular layer595 FEiMALE ORGANS OF GENERATION. exhibits a superficial stratum of longitudinal and a deeper set of circular fibres, both being continued from the uterus. The mucous lining, pale and fine, presents numerous longitudinal rugse, the epithelium being cili- ated to the point where it becomes continuous with the peritoneum at the fimbriated extremity of the tube. _ Ovaries—These are two small oval bodies or glands, situated in the lateral broad ligament of the uterus, behind and below the Fallopian tubes, their long measurement, which is placed transversely, being in the virgin about one inch and a half, in breadth three- quarters, and in thickness half-an-inch; but in advanced life, and even at the age of forty, if the female has borne many children, the difference in size and weight is very remarkable: in the virgin being from ninety to one hundred grains, and in the multiparient from forty to fatty. These glands are convex behind and before, also : above, and covered by serous membrane, but otherwise unattached; the inferior edge is notched for the en- 1 trance and exit of vessels, externally receiving the at- itachment of the Fallopian fimbriae, and internally fixed I by the ligament of the ovary, this latter appearing as i a strong round cord, attached externally to the ovary •where it becomes expanded and mixed with the fibrous jstroma of the gland, and internally inserted into the 1 lateral and superior angle of the uterus. In the fcEtus tthey occupied the lumbar region, and after birth as- <sumed their future position in the true pelvis; durin? Fpregnancy they follow the uterus into the abdominal ccavity, and after parturition remain for some time in tthe ihac fossffi; occasionally they become displaced into > the recto-uterine cw/ de sac, where their existence can :be detected by the introduction of the finger through "the rectum. ° ° Structure.-The first,or indusium,is derived from the pperitoneum; the second, or tunica albuginea, is merely condensed stroma, and is deficient at the hylus, where tthe nerves and vessels enter the organ; the parenchv- imatous tissue consisting of a fibrous stroma, which se- poarates and connects the ovisacs, and permeated in all -lirections by a vascular network. Each ovary conCAVITY OF THE ABDOMEN. 596 tains from fifteen to twenty Graafian vesicles or ovisacs, the larger being found nearest to the surface; these cells of the ovary have two coats: first a dense but vas- cular capsule, lined internally by a granular membrane, the cavity being occupied by a granulary fluid, con- taining a few oily particles, together with the ovum. The latter appears as a small transparent vesicle, about 1-120th of an inch in diameter, attached to the inner surface of the Graafian ovisac by retinaculse, or the proli- gerous disc, and covered by a granular layer (tunica granulosa). The ovum possesses a dense but transpa- rent envelope that surrounds the yelk, being named zona pellucida (Valentin), or chorion (Wagner); in its centre is found the germinal vesicle, with the macula germinativa; these several parts being subject to changes or modifications in the progress of generation, which will be briefly alluded to hereafter. Vascular Supply of the Internal Organs.—The uterus receives its vessels from several sources, namely,— uterine branches of the internal iliac, vesical in front, and the middle hemorrhoidal posteriorly, and lastly, a few twigs from the spermatic arteries. The Veins are numerous and large, opening into the internal iliac, and communicating with the hemor- rhoidal and vesical plexuses. The Lymphatics consist of a superficial and deep set, the former being the more numerous; they join the pelvic and lumbar lymphatic glands. The Nerves of the Uterus are branches of the sacral and hypogastric plexuses of the sympathetic, the former appearing to preside over the reflex motor mfluences of the organ, and the latter subserving to the special generative functions of the uterus, as also associatmg it not only with the other parts of the urino-genital ap- paratus, but likewise with more distant organs. Vascular Supply of the OvARiES.-The spermatic arteries not only supply these glands, but also send branches to the uterus. , . , „ -l^^^ Nervous Supply.—This is derived from the hypo- ^""The veinrascend on the psoas muscle, and form a597 FBMAIiE ORGANS OF GENERATION. tortuous interlacement (corpus pampiniforme), the right terminating in the vena cava inferior, the left in the corresponding renal vein. The Uterus presents some peculiarities as an organ, exclusive of its special function: amongst these are its quiescence until the period of parturition arrives, also its rapid enlargement from two or three ounces to the enormous weight of four pounds and a half, so that during the distention of the organ it undergoes an absolute in- crease in thickness of its walls, this being in some mea- sure attributable to the enlargement of the vessels, the arteries becoming large and tortuous, and the veins dilated, resembling siniises, which adhere to the proper tissue of the organ; but there likewise occurs an hyper- trophy oftheuterinemusculariibres, which is proved by the circumstance that the organ does not contract to its exact original magnitude until some time after partu- rition is accomplished. The functional action of the several organs described may thus be briefly stated:— The Spermatozoa, introduced into the vagina, enter the uterus in virtue of their automatic movements, pass- ing through that cavity and the Fallopian tubes, iirged in that direction by the ciliary appendages of the epithe- lial investments, and they reach the ovary, where their existence was demonstrated by the Abb§ Spallanzani. The vascularity of the ovary increases, an elevation ap- pearing on its surface, and the Fallopian tube firmly grasping its capsule, the ovum escapes by a slit or rent in the peritoneal investment into the tube; this escape is caused by the thickening of the granulary mem- brane, with the coincident increase in the granulary fluid, accompanied with absorption of the capsule, and as- sisted by the compression of the fimbriated extremity of the Fallopian tube. In the latter the ovum receives an albuminous covering (chorion), and then slowly pur- sues its course towards the uterus, urged in that direc- tion by the ciliary wave and the vermicular action of the tube, but whilst these changes are taking place in tlie female ovarian appendages, the uterus also partici- pates in the functional activity, the gjands at the cervix throwing out an albuminous matter which seals the outlet of the uterus (operculum), the lining membrane598 CAVITY OF THE ABDOMEN. of the body and fundus becoming vascular, and the fol- licles prominent; a plastic membrane is now effused, which lines the entire surface (decidua vera); the ovum then, entering the cavity, pushes the decidua vera before it, receiving a surface covering from that membrane (decidua reflexa, Hunter), whilst a fluid (hydroperion) exists between the two layers, which constitutes the nutritive material for the foetus in its early stages of uterine life. Mr. Goodsir has, however, offered a different explanation of the formation of the decidua; the vera being derived from the interfoUicular spaces, whilst the reflexa, being a cell-structure, is secreted by the uterine follicles themselves; the placenta being formed in a subsequent stage, a new series of changes are the result (for which see Fcetal Cikculation). When the ovum leaves the ovary the ovisac remains filled by the thickened granulary membrane and blood, containing a cavity in the recent state, but subse- quently becoming of a yellow colour, striated but friable, like a lobule of a salivary gland (corpus lu- teum). The cicatrices of small abscesses or scrofulous tubercles may sometimes be confounded with true cor- pora lutea (Montgomery); the former, however, cannot be injected. . Mammary Glands.—These organs are situated on the anterior and upper part of the thorax, correspond- ing to the space included between the second and seventh ribs. Each gland is oval in its outhne and irregular at the margin; the long measurement oeing directed downwards and inwards; the anterior surface being convex and surmounted by the nipple; the pos- terior concave, and resting on the great pectoral muscle. The structures composing the organ are:—1. Skm; 2. Sepimenta and capsule; 3. Fat; 4. Lactiferous tubes, erectile tissue, nerves, vessels, and absorbents. I he skin on the surface of the breast is fine, soft, and smooth, but immediately surrounding the nipple it is of a dark colour, particularly in the pregnant female, constituting the areola, and containing in this situation numerous sebaceous glands, with a few promment papi-llo3 and fine hairs in the old subject; as it ap- proaches the nipple its tenuity is marked, and at the599 FEMALE OE6ANS OF GENERATION. free extremity of that point it becomes continuous with the mucous lining of the lactiferous tubes. The capsule is formed by the superficial thoracic fascia, which splits at the upper margin of the organ to inclose it, likewise sending processes into its structure (ligamenta suspensoria), to separate and connect the lobules of which the organ is composed. The fatty tissue is the predominating structure, and forms the principal volume of the breast in the infant, when it is comparatively large, as well as in the adult,' but in old age both the fat and the glandular tissue undergo the process of absorption, producing senile atrophy, but occasionally, however, the reverse is the case with regard to the fatty tissue, its volume becoming greatly augmented, so that the gland may attain the weight of many pounds. The lactiferous tubules commence by ca?cal extre- mities ; a number of these coalescing to form a lobule, which is perfectly isolated by the sepimenta of the cap- sule; a single duct, the eflferent tube of each lobule, approaches the base of the nipple, where it is dilated into an ampulla, from twelve to sixteen of these passing through the nipple, and terminating at its free extremity. The nipple is situated at the most convex part of the_ breast, being variable as to size and figure, small, conical, and smooth in the virgin, long and enlarged at the extremity during the period of lactation. It may however, be extremely elongated, or, on the contrary,' so small and deeply sunk that the infant may be un- able to grasp it. In colour it varies from a light pink to a dark red; and at the extremity presents two or three depressions, on which the lactiferous tubes open Its structure consists of a fine but closely adherent tegu- mentary investment, inclosing a cylinder of dense erec- tile tissue, with the efferent tubes of the gland. Vascular Supply.—This is derived from the long thoracic, intercostal, and internal mammary arteries and the veins of the organ open into the internal mam- mary and axillary. Nerves—These are branches from the third, fourth titth, and sixth intercostal, together with filaments from the thoracic branch of the brachial plexus.600 CAVITY OF THE ABDOMEN. The breast is the organ for the secretion of milk, not being fully developed until puberty; but still it is very constant in its presence, cases of total absence being unrecorded; but, on the other hand, their number may be augmented to four, as in a case recorded by Mr. Shannon, surgeon to the South Union Hospital, in the Quarterly Journal of Medical Science. _ In this ex- ample the supernumerary organ secreted with the same freedom as those occupying the normal position. As conglomerate glands their structure is exceedingly com- plex, a circumstance that would scarcely be expected when it is remembered that milk may be vicariously secreted by the mucous membrane and skin, and also, that the fluid is found in the blood as pregnancy ap- proaches its termination, from which it might be inferred that the glands are merely outlets for the secretion.

Before proceeding with the descriptive anatomy of the nervous centres, and those parts with which they are in immediate connexion, we think it judicious to prefix a few preliminary remarks on their structural peculiari- ties and recognised divisions. The nervous system has been divided into two orders, of lesser magnitude,—one the cerebro-spinal, which includes the brain and spinal cord, with the nerves emanating from or connected with them; the second being named the sympathetic system: the former having presidence over animal life connected by its nerves with the function of sensation, motion, and those of the more special senses; the latter maintaining, originating, and governing the functions of organic life, its filaments being principally distri- buted to the internal viscera and glands. But although possessing structural differences and functional distinc- tions sufficient to form the basis of a perfect division still, throughout the human body constant and intimate communications exist between the two systems, evi- dencing the mutual interdependence subsisting in their relations, as the exciters of that combination of actions wfiich, taken m their widest sense, si"-nify life Cerebro-spinal SysTEM.-Its structure consists of two very distmct elements,—the first being ^rev or cmeritious cellular or secreting; the second, white, tbro-tubular, and conducting. Grey or Cineritious NEURiNE.—This is found in numerous situations,—as on the surface of the brain in the optic thalami, corpora striata, crura cerebri' pons varohi, medulla oblongata, and spinal cord- also m and on the cerebellum. Its common constituents are,—agranular base, granular cells, ganglionic corpus- cles, and nucleated nerve fibres. The granular base602 KERVOUS SYSTEM. exceeds the granular cells in the grey matter of the brain, but the latter predominate in the cerebellum, spinal cord, and tuber cinereum. The ganglionic cells are large granular bodies, containing pigmentary mat- ter, with a nucleus and nucleolus, and an oily fluid, possessing the common character of being provided with caudate prolongations in whatever situation they are exa- mined ; their shape is not, however, uniform in all parts of the nervous centres, being stellar in the locus niger of the crus cerebri, and pyriform in the cerebellum; or they may be triangular, as in the medulla oblongata; or large and irregular, with numerous prolongations, as in the spinal cord. It is believed by some physiologists that these caudate prolongations are connected with the conducting tubular structure. Nerve Filaments.—These are small and nucleated, resembling the sympathetic fibres. FiBRO-TUBULAR STRUCTURE.—In the bram, spinal cord, and nerves of motion and special sensation, the tubules are unbranched and extremely slender; butm the cerebellum, whilst they still are undivided, they become much larger, a character also observed m the posterior roots of the spinal and sympathetic nerves. But it is in the motor nerves that these tubules exhibit the largest size, accompanied with the greatest amount of resistance. The nerve tubes of the brain, cerebel- lum, together with the nerves of special sense, have a remarkable tendency to become varicose when sub- iected to pressure, which seems to depend on the tenuity of their investing membrane, and their containmg a fluid matter, which collects at certain points, sometimes even producing rupture of the envelope. It is almost im- possible to isolate the fibres of the brain for examina- tion from the surrounding tissues, and on this account the fibres of the motor nerves are selected as the type of the tubular tissue. A nerve tube consists of an invest- ing membrane, transparent, homogeneous, and smooth, without a trace of fibrous structure (neurilemma); within the last occurs a thin, elastic, white, albuminous layer (whitesubstance of Schwann), which incloses a thm, soft, semifluid matter, probably phosphorized fat having little tendency to solidification: this is called the axis cylinder (Purkinje). In the white matter of the brain2 D 2 1/ NERVOUS SYSTEM. 603 numerous globules occur, forming the greater amount of the cerebral mass, these being of all sizes, and resem- bling cells, Avith an oily consistence and colour. Sympathetic System.—The nerves connected with this division present some peculiarities, being of a grey colour, soft, and exhibiting the formation of gan- glia at intervals. They likewise possess two distinct elements,—the first being the ordinary nerve tubule; the second, nucleated filaments, resembling the non- striped muscular fibre which Henle has named gelati- nous nerve fibres. Some difference of opinion has oc- curred with reference to the latter constituents, as to whether they were really portions of the nervous sys- tem at all; but their origin and termination being si- milar to the true nerve tubes, as observed by Bidder, is quite sufficient to justify an affirmative. The Ganglia, which are observed not only on the sym- pathetic, but in connexion with the cerebro-spinal system contain three elements—namely, corpuscles (ganglionic)' gelatinous filaments, and nerve tubules. Each ganglion has on its external surface a capsule, derived from the external investing membrane of the nerve trunk, this capsule_sending sepimenta into its structure, so as to di- vme It into small compartments, each containing a sepa- rate and independent portion of nervous tissue. Internal to the capsule the gelatinous filaments form an inner cap- sule, by being arranged in a continuous layer, whilst the centre is occupied by the ganglionic corpuscles and nerve tubules; these latter, on entering, separate from each other, and become twisted and interlaced in a serpen- tine manner amongst the ganglion cells. These gancrlia present externally a great similarity to glands, and This resemblance is further increased by the presence of a capsule which sends its partitions deeply, separating the lobules trom each other. That they are connected with the secretion of some peculiar element would ap- pear at least probable, the tubular structure standina in the relation of efferent ducts for the transmission of the eliminated product. Origins of the iVerm.—These are conceived to com mence by loops, and to have a similar mode of termina tion at their peripheral extremities, as in cases where604 NERVOUS SYSTEM. the brain and spinal cord were absent tlie nerves were ob- served to arise from a granular and cellular matter by looped extremities. Some authorities, however, conceive that their extremities are connected with the caudate prolongations of the ganglionic cells, but this opinion is far from being proved. Development of Nervous Tissue.—Ta.Q nerves appear to be formed by the fusion of primary cells, arranged in rows, thus constituting a secondary cell; and when a nerve can first be distinguished it appears as a pale cord, with longitudinal fibrillation profusely nucleated, from which filaments can be detached, these also contammg nuclei. These fibrillse are pale, granulated, and hol- low at this period; but a secondary deposit takes place on the inner surface of the cell membrane of the se- condary nervous cell, and this deposit is fatty, and white in colour, giving the future opacity to the nerve. As the deposit increases, the volume of the nerve is aug- mented, and displays a double contour under the mi- croscope, indicating a tubular character. The nuclei now disappear, but slowly, so that some few remain visible for a longer period, the cavity appearing to be filled up by a firm, consistent substance,—the band of Eemak; so that the adult nerve seems to consist of, first, the cell membrane; secondly, a white, fatty sub- stance; and thirdly, the band of Remak. Coverings of the Brain.—The membranes ol the brain are three in number,—namely, the dura mater, which is fibrous; the arachnoid, serous; and the pia mater, an areolo-vascular tissue; these lying from su- perficial to deep in the order of enumeration. Dura Mater.—In order to examine this membrane, with the inclosed organ, the brain, a variety of modes have been adopted. If the scalp has been dissected, it will only be requisite to remove the calvanum at once; but if, on the other hand, the tegumentary tissue re- mains entire, and the object is merely to examine the pathological appearances of the contained organ, a dil- Lent mode of proceeding must be pursued. An inci- sion may be carried round the scalp above the ears, or the crucial division may be adopted, turning down four flaps; but if cleanliness and avoidance of disfigurementDURA MATER. are considered of importance, a transverse cut from ear to ear, the flaps being turned forwards and backwards, appear to be most suitable. Having removed the scalp] the bone may now be fractured in a circular direction with the claws of a hammer; but this course is attended with very great disadvantage in consequence of the ir- regular spicule resulting from the fracture being con- stantly liable to puncture the hands of the operator in the future examination of the membrane. We would therefore advise the use of the saw on all occasions: al- though a little more tedious, the subsequent safety amply compensating for the additional trouble. The bones should be sawed in a circular direction, half-an- inch above the superciliary arches in front, the same distance above the occipital protuberances behind, and laterally on a level with the superior edge of the carti- lage of the ear. Having sawn to a sufficient depth, a chisel may now be introduced into the groove ante- riorly, lorcmg off the calvarium from before backwards the attempt being attended with much facility in the adult, but with no small amount of difficulty in the in- fant and old age; in the former the intimate adhesion depending on the free vascular communication between the pericranium and dura mater, and in the latter on the ossification of the external layers of that membrane. Ihe student should observe the different thickness of the calvarium at its margins; laterally being thin and brittle where the parietal and squamous plates of the temporal bones enter into its formation; thick and dense m its occipital portion, with a similar depth ante- riorly, resulting from the separation of the tables to lorni the frontal sinuses. The dura mater, now exposed, belongs to the class of fibrous tissues, and is strong, dense, and of a bluish white colour, the structure being distinctly fibrous in all situations. It covers and adheres to the whole in- ternal surface of the bones, presenting two surfaces — one external, rough and fibrous; the other internal smooth, polished, and glistening; a character which re- sults from the parietal layer of arachnoid which adheres to It. In many situations this membrane can be divided into two layers, the external being adherent to the bone in all parts, and therefore acting as a periosteum- the606 NERVOUS SYSTEM. internal dipping in to form the processes, as well as the ■walls of the sinuses. The dura mater adheres most in- timately to the lines of the sutures, but is still more closely connected to the bones constituting the vault of the skull, particularly the petrous portion of the tem- poral bone, from which it is most difficult to remove it, even after maceration. It is also much stronger in the base of the skull than in the calvarium, but cannot be divided into layers in this situation, with a few ex- ceptions, which will be alluded to hereafter. The dura mater has many uses, firstly, to act as an internal periosteum; secondly, to separate and preserve the several divisions of the brain from mutual pressure; thirdly, to form sinuses; fourthly, to send processes out on the nerves to form their external fibrous sheaths; fifthly, to constitute by its prolongation forwards the periosteum of the orbit, and downwards the theca ver- tebralis; sixthly, in foetal life to assist in the develop- ment of the bones. The processes are six in number, namely,—1. Falx ce- rebri; 2. Tentorium cerebelli; 3. Falxcerebelli; 4. Sphe- noidal; 5. Orbital; and 6. Vertebral. The sinuses are venous canals lying in the vicinity of the bone, and con- sisting of a surrounding investment of dura mater, lined internally by a continuation of the serous venous tunic from those veins, with which they communicate. It is obvious that the strong fibrous layer of dura mater which surrounds them prevents during momentary congestion that injurious pressure which might result to the brain, if yielding and expansile veins were substituted for these fibro-venous canals. The sinuses are nineteen in number, namely,—superior longitudinal, inferior longitudinal, straight, cavernous, circular, transverse sphenoidal, su- perior and inferior petrosal, transverse occipital, lateral, posterior occipital and the torcular Herophih; these, with the dura mater, should now be examined in detail. DuEA Mater.—The surface now exposed presents a rough fibrous aspect, numerous processes being pro- longed into the bone, particularly at the sutures, these fibrous prolongations being the obliterated remains ot those vessels which connected the dura mater with the pericranium in foetal life. The surface is likewise seen dotted with blood, owing to the rupture of thoseII DURA MATER. 607 vessels (principally veins) which are still permeable on the sides and the anterior posterior part; the an- terior, middle, and posterior meningeal ramifications spread over the surface, to which they intimately adhere, and near to the mesian line the glandulte Pacchioni occur, these small bodies being granulated on the sur- face, and divisible into three sets, namely,—external, middle, and internal; they differ much in shape, size, and number, being conical, flattened, or hemispherical; larger in old age than in the adult, and totally absent in the infant; their surface rough and granular, gene- rally of a light pink tinge, but in very old subjects per- fectly pale; they arise from the pia mater on the sur- face of the brain, carry the arachnoid, which is pale and opaque, for some distance on their surface, absorb the dura mater, and continue to increase until they come in contact with the bone, which they likewise absorb, pro- ducing deep pits or hollows, in many cases even ex- tending to the diploe. Bichat believed their origin to be connected with chronic inflammation of the membranes, an opinion receiving some confirmation from the exis- tence of opacity of the arachnoid in their vicinity. The external or osteal set are the largest and most nume- rous, some being seen on the surface, whilst others are in the process of absorption, merely making their appear- ance through the membrane; the middle occupy two situations, namely, between the layers of the dura ma- ter and within the cavity of the superior longitudinal sinus; the third, or most internal, are found on the sur- face of the brain, some free and others connecting the visceral and parietal layers of arachnoid together. The use of these bodies is unknown. In the middle line of the dura mater a longitudinal depression is observed, which corresponds to that sinus, which should now be ex- amined, and this may be done by opening it with a pair of scissors from before backwards. Superior Longitudinal Sinus.—This is a venous canal extending from the ethmoid to the occipital bone, situated in the convex margin of the falx cerebri, and corresponding to the mesian line of the frontal, parietal, and occipital bones; it is much larger behind than be- fore, and a section shows its cavity to be triangular inNERVOUS SYSTEM. 608 figure, the base formed by the periosteal layer of the dura mater, and the sides by the internal laminaj dip- ping inwards to form the falx cerebri; it commences by a small vein which passes upw^ards from the nose through the foramen ctecum, sometimes by a cul desac, and termi- nates in the torcular Herophili, or in the right lateral sinus. Within the cavity the following parts are ob- served :—ChordsaWillisii, openings of the veins, and glan- dnXse Pacchioni. The chordae Willisii are white silvery bands which cross the sinus, being more numerous posteriorly; the venous membrane is reflected around them, sometimes giving them a flattened appearance, their use appearing to be for the purpose of prevent- ing over-distention of the walls of the sinus. The veins opening into the sinus are derived from the internal and superior surface of the cerebral hemisphere. The inter- nal hemispheric veins, from eight to ten in number, run upwards to the falx, and there unite with the superior branches, while the superior, about ten in number, course upwards, the most anterior passing also back- wards,—the largest being the middle cerebral, which commences in the fissure of Sylvius, runs at first upwards and backwards, then curves forwards, and this, with the other superior branches, proceed from ten to twelve lines between the layers of the falx in a forward direc- tion prior to opening into the sinus, which they enter in a direction from behind forwards, or contrary to the current of the blood, a course which is conceived to ob- viate the tendency to regurgitation; the anterior branches, however, constituting an exception to this rule, many entering the sinus directly. Immediately at the open- ings in the sinus an areolar structure may be seen, and where this is absent the venous set of glandule Pac- chioni, being situated exactly at the orifices, are said to act as ball-valves, thus precluding regurgitation from the sinus into the veins. In addition to the cerebral, many branches from the dura mater and osseous diploe pour their contents into the sinus, and in the majority of instances a small vein passes through tlie posterior superior angle of the parietal bone, producingan indirect communication between the cerebral and general venous system. Now cut the dura mater on one side oi theDURA MATER. 609 2 D 3 sinus from before backwards, then reflect it downwards, drawing the cerebral hemisphere a little to one side' and expose the— ' Falx Cerebri—A sickle-shaped fold of dura mater, occupying the great longitudinal fissure between the hemispheres, which it supports in the varied movements of the head, being of a curved triangular outline, present- ing for examination an apex, base, convex and concave margins, and two surfaces. The apex is attached anteriorly to the crista galli of the ethmoid bone, which it seems to embrace, the base posteriorly being connected with the upper surface of the tentorium, in this situation bemg broad and bifid, slinging the tentorium in the centre, where it incloses the straight sinus. The con- vex margin is connected to the mesian line on the frontal, parietal, and occipital bones, containing the su- perior longitudinal sinus; the concave edge is free, cor- responding to the upper surface of the corpus callo'sum, from which it is separated by the arachnoid membrane uniting the two hemispheres; it contains the follow- ing Inferior Longitudinal Sinus or Vein lies in the concave edge of the falx, occupying only, however, its two posterior thirds; it commences by a descending branch, which connects it with the superior longitudinal, then passes backwards in the concavity, dividing into two posteriorly,—one which opens into the commence- ment of the straight sinus; the other curves backwards and terminates in the same sinus about the centre of its course. This is a proper vein, possessing the two coats peculiar to that system of vessels, being enveloped, how- ever, by dura mater, and it receives venous branches irom the falx, but none from the brain. The student may defer the further examination of the sinuses until the brain is removed, which should now be proceeded with in the following manner-—Cut around the opposite side of the dura mater, which has been as yet untouched, then gently separate the hemi- spheres anteriorly, dividing the attachment of the falx cerebri to the ethmoid bone; throw this backwards and allow the head to droop, placing the left hand beneath the hemispheres; the anterior lobes, now receding from610 NERVOUS SYSTEM. \ the orbitar plates of tlie frontal bone, usually carry with them the dura mater, as it adheres very loosely in this region; let this now be replaced, and proceed cau- tiously with the division of the nerves and vessels, cut- ting them close to their foramina of exit on one side, and near their origin on the opposite. The order of parts, as seen from before backwards, is:—Olfactory nerves, of which one should be allowed to remain on the cribriform plate of the ethmoid; the optic nerves, accompanied by the ophthalmic artery, next appear, and should be di- vided ; posterior to these the pituitary body, lying in the sella turcica, which may be allowed to remain, merely dividing the infundibulum; next in order is the internal carotid artery, with the third nerve lying posterior and external to it, this latter leading the knife to the con- cave edge of the tentorium, which should be divided from before backwards on each side; now allowing the brain to droop backwards, the fifth pair of nerves be- comes visible, running towards the superior margin of the petrous portion of the temporal bone, whilst infe- rior and posterior to them the seventh pair are seen coursing towards the meatus auditorius internus; still more inferior and posterior, the eighth pair, consisting of three portions, namely,—pneumogastric, glosso-pharyn- o-eal, and spinal accessory, make for the foramen lacerum post'erius in basis cranii; and, lastly, the ninth or lin- o-ual, passing almost horizontally outwards and for- wards to the anterior condyloid foramen. These must be cut across in succession, then the knife may be in- troduced into the canal through the foramen magnum, dividing as low as possible the spinal marrow, when the brain may be removed and placed in a solution of alum, or naphtha, which answers equally well, but the former is usually preferred as being quite sufficient for ordi- nary purposes. Resume now the examination of the sinuses. , , Straight Sinus lies between the base oi the lalx and the tentorium. It is of a triangular shape ante- riorly, but rhomboid posteriorly, its direction bemg ob- liquely downwards and backAvards; anteriorly it receives the inferior longitudinal sinus with the venjE magna? Galcni, whilst posteriorly it communicates with the tor-DURA MATER. 6li cular Heropliili, in the former situation being sometimes double, and not unfrequently a few glandule Pacchioni are seen in this situation. "We have never observed any cerebellar veins communicating directly with it in any point, which leads us to consider it merely as the con- tinuation of the inferior longitudinal and veins of Galen. Tentorium Cerebelli.—Stretched as a platform be- tween the cerebrum and cerebellum, and is somewhat se- milunar in shape; it presents for description two mar- gins, two surfaces, and an aperture. The convex margin, thick and bifid, is attached to the crucial ridge of the occipital bone and the lips of the transverse sulcus of the same, to the posterior inferior angle of the parietal, mastoid, and petrous portions of the temporal; and lastly, to the posterior clinoid processes of the sphenoid. The concave edge is free except at its terminal points, which, gliding over the convex margin, are attached to the anterior clinoid processes, thus circumscribing a semilunar aperture, bounded posteriorly and laterally by the tentorium, and anteriorly by the clivus basis cranii, into which project the pons varolii and superior vermiform process of the cerebellum, whilst it gives passage to the crura cerebri and basilar artery, in this manner allowing connexion between the elements of the mesocephalon, which unite the cerebrum, cerebel- lum, and the medulla oblongata, and by the transmission of the basilar artery it likewise permits of a free com- munication between the two sources of vascular supply to the central organ of the nervous system. The supe- rior surface is convex, and directed downwards and outwards, and is suspended in the centre by the falx cerebri supporting the posterior lobes of the brain; the inferior surface, concave, receives the attachment of the falx cerebelli near its posterior margin, and corresponds to the superior surface of the lobes of the cerebellum, osseous plates being frequently found in the lamina of this process, rudimentary of the normal structure in the feline species, and these, when examined microsco- pically, always exhibit the presence of Haversian canals, a structure which we have demonstrated in a plate taken from the tentorium over the fifth pair of nerves. The612 NERVOUS SYSTEM. sinuses connected with the tentorium are,—the torcular Herophili, lateral, superior petrosal, and straight. Sphenoidal Fold of Dura Mater—Thick, round, and strong, but not very extensive, being a continua- tion outwards of the concave edge of the tentorium, is attached to the posterior edge of the lesser wing of the sphenoid, to which it is almost inseparably connected. Use and Relations.—To increase the anterior fossa of the base of the skull, and prevent the pressure of the anterior lobe on the sphenoidal lobule of the middle. It corresponds to the fissure of Sylvius at the base of the brain, but its ascent for any distance into that sul- cus is prevented by the arachnoid membrane passing from the anterior to the middle lobe, separating the fold from the middle cerebral artery. Falx Cerebelli To see this the tentorium should be raised. It is triangular, the base above, and attached to the tentorium, and the apex inferiorly at the foramen magnum, where it often bifurcates, so as to surround the posterior half of that opening; the posterior edge, thick and bifid, is connected to the vertical spine on the occipital bone, inclosing the occipital sinuses, while the anterior lies in the incisura posterior of the -cerebellum. Let the student now commence the examination of the sinuses in the base of the skull, the first being the ca- vernous or spheno-orbital. This is placed on the side of the body of the sphenoid bone, and is prismatic in form, consisting of an external covering of dura mater, with an internal venous lining. It is bounded exter- nally by the concave edge of the tentorium, expanding to line the middle cranial fossa; internally by the side of the body of the sphenoid bone, covered by a perios- teal layer of the same membrane; posteriorly by the convex margin of the tentorium, attached to the poste- rior clinoid processes; and anteriorly, by the foramen lacerum orbitale. This fibrous space contains internally the deep carotid artery, on the external side of which runs the sixth nerve, and in its external wall are found the third, fourth, and ophthalmic division of the fifth; in the centre lies the venous sinus, which receives ante- riorly the ophthalmic vein; whilst posteriorly it ter-CUBA MATER. 613 I minates in the superior and inferior petrosal sinuses. But it will be necessary to examine the fibrous walls of this space, as well as the parts connected with it, a little more in detail, in order to understand its formation, and we must, therefore, return to the anatomy of the tentorium. On tracing the concave edge of this pro- cess forwards it glides over the posterior to be inserted into the anterior clinoid process, presenting superiorly a strong elevated margin, which splits into two layers, one weak and thin, passing inwards beneath the pitui- tary body, assisting in the formation of the circular and sphenoidal sinuses; the second, stronger, continued out- wards to form the outer wall of the cavernous sinus. The convex margin of the same process dips inwards to be connected with the posterior clinoid process, pro- ducing a decussation of the edges, and leaving between them a triangular space on which rests the third nerve; but this process has not yet assumed its final arrange- ment, for at the side of the sphenoid bone it splits into two layers, one of which sinks between the internal carotid and the bone, and can be traced outwards beneath the Casserian ganglion; the second also passes outwards, forming the internal layer of the outer wall of the sinus, and separating the nerves occupying this situation from the venous membrane, as well as forming a partition between the fossette for the Casserian ganglion and the cavernous sinus. The venous membrane within this space is loosely attached, constituting anteriorly a cir- cular canal, and posteriorly becoming oval where it joms the petrosal, in the former situation receivino- the ophthalmic vein, the proper fibrous coat of that v°essel being prolonged for some distance on the venous sinus- but m the latter position it is destitute of any covering except the dura mater. On laying the cavity open a number of fibrous bands are seen crossing in every di- rection, but most numerous posteriorly, with several small arterial branches running through them, pro- ducing an appearance something similar to the corpus cavernosum penis, the apparent use of this structure being to prevent regurgitation of the venous blood towards the eye. We will now direct our attention to the parts related to this sinus, these being,_the ophthal-NERVOUS SYSTEM. 614 I mic vein, carotid artery, and the orbital nervei?. The ophthalmic vein commences by a branch from the fron- tal, receiving in its course through the orbit the palpe- bral, ciliary, and lachrymal veins, enters the cranium through the base of the sphenoidal fissure lying here be- tween the two heads of the external rectus, beneath the sixth nerve and above the periosteum, and opens into the forepart of the sinus. Carotid Artery This vessel enters by the foramen lacerum anterius in basi cranii, the dura mater forming a dense fibrous ring around it. On entering the cra- nium it first ascends, and then turns forwards and in- wards on the inside of the sinus and sixth nerve, and external to the pituitary body; it next passes through the dura mater, between the posterior and anterior cli- noid processes, to commence its cerebral stage, and dur- ing its course branches are given off internally to the pi- tuitary body, and externally to the dura mater and sinus. Nerves.—The third, fourth, and fifth lie in the sub- stance of the outer wall, in their numerical order from above downwards; but the sixth in the two posterior thirds of the sinus lies between the carotid and the ve- nous membrane, the latter only separating it from the blood; but anteriorly the sixth is related to the other nerves, lying below them all, with the commencement of the sinus beneath it. (See Anatomy of the Cerebral Nerves, both for those mentioned above, as well as for the Casserian ganglion, which may now be examined with advantage.) Petrosal Sinuses.—These are two in number,—one superior, and the other inferior, with a similar pair on the opposite side of the skull. The superior commences anteriorly at the cavernous, and, running backwards in a groove on the superior angle of the petrous portion of the temporal bone, between the layers of the tentorium, terminates in the lateral sinus. Its figure is triangular, and it receives veins from the superior and inferior sur- face of the cerebellum, and frequently a transverse branch from the velum. Immediately behind the point of the petrous portion it is separated from the bone by the fifth pair of nerves, and in one instance only we liave observed the complete absence of the entire sinus.615 DURA MATER. The inferior petrosal is larger, but only about half the length of the last; commencing at the cavernous, often in common with the superior petrosal, it passes down- wards and backwards, corresponding to the junction of the petrous with the cuneiform process of the occipital bone, and then piercing the dura mater, which closes the foramen lacerum posterius, terminates in the internal jugular vein on the outer side of the eighth pair of nerves, receiving the transverse occipital sinus with a small diploic vein that passes through the anterior lace- rated openmg. It is remarkable that the dura mater does not intervene between this sinus and the cartilage uniting the occipital and temporal bones. Circular Sinus lies in the sella turcica, and consists ot an anterior and posterior portion, the former lyina before and above, the latter below and behind the pitui- tary body, and communicating on either side with the cavernous sinus. A third sinus (transverse sphenoidal) IS sometimes present, crossing the body of the sphenoid bone, and also communicating with the cavernous on each side; we have, however, frequently observed its ab- sence. Ihese sinuses receive veins from the bone and the pituitary body, but not from the brain. Transverse Occipital Smus.—Small,and sometimes absent; lies on a level with the anterior lacerated open- ing, and, crossing the basilar process of the occipital bone, It communicates between the two inferior petro- sal Just at this point a number of sinuses unite in confluence, namely, cavernous, petrosal, and transverse occipital,-th.s dilatation being called the anterior tor- cular Herophili. Lateral SiNusEs—These are symmetrical, consisting of righ and left, the former being the larger, and th! atter the longer ot the two. Each sinus commences from the lateral angle of the torcular Herophili, and passes at first horizontally outwards, grooving the occipital bone and the posterior inferior angle of the parietal, then curves downwards in the deep sulcus of the mastoid portion of the temporal; lastly, turns forwards and in- wards, again indenting the occipital behind and external to the basilar process, and, piercing the dura mater stretched across the foramen lacerum posterius in basi616 KERVOUS SYSTEM. cranii, terminates in the jugular vein. In the posterior portion it is triangular, lying in the bifurcated edge of the tentorium, but anteriorly circular, in consequence of the depth of the bony groove, and being only covered by one layer of dura mater. The terminal point of this sinus has the following relations:—Anteriorly, inferior petrosal sinus; posteriorly, the transverse process of the occipital bone, which presents an excavation for its re- ception; externally, the jugular fossa in the petrous portion of the temporal bone; and internally, the eighth pair of nerves. The veins communicating with the la- teral sinus are the following:—Lateral and inferior cere- bral, commencing by branches on the sides and under surface of the posterior part of the cerebral hemispheres, uniting into four or five trunks, and opening from be- fore backwards into the horizontal portion of the sinus: also the inferior and lateral cerebellar veins, which, commencing on the under surface of its lobes, run to- wards its circumference, and, uniting into three trunks, likewise open into the lower wall of the horizontal por- tion of the sinus; and lastly, it receives the mastoid vein, by which a communication is established between it and the occipital. Posterior Occipital Sinuses.—These are exceedingly small, and lie between the layers of the falx cerebelli; commencing at the lower angle of the torcular Hero- phili, they pass at first vertically downwards; then, di- verging behind the foramen magnum, they run forwards to communicate with the lateral sinuses just at their terminations; but occasionally we have seen them join- ing the posterior condyloid vein, and still more rarely beuig cffical, inferiorly receiving veins from the dura mater and bone, but we have not observed any other communication. Torcular Herophili implies the occipital conhuence of the sinuses. It is well seen by removing a portion oi bone about one inch square, including theoccipital protu- berance. Its figure is diamond-shaped, being formed by the common attachment of the falx cerebri, cerebelh, and tentorium, and exhibits six openings,-one superiorly, superior longitudinal sinus; two inferiorly, occipital; one at each lateral angle, lateral; and one anteriorly, the617 DURA MATER. Straight. This reservoir is occasionally absent, when the majority of the sinuses enumerated open into the right lateral. _ The sinuses placed within the skull do not form a dis- tinct system, as they communicate freely with the ex- ternal veins in several situations, which may be enume- rated as follows:—The cavernous, with the ophthalmic vem; the superior longitudinal, with the vein which passes through the posterior superior angle of the pa- rietal bone, as well as with those of the diploe and naso- cjecal vein; the lateral with the gulf of the internal jugular, and with the mastoid. The Arteries supplying thedura mater consistof three sets,_anterior, middle, andposterior meningeal. Thefirst are principally derived from the ethmoidal branches of the ophthalmic; the second consist of the middle menin- geal arteries (greater and lesser), both being usually de- rived from the internal maxillary; also of branches which arise from the internal carotid, whilst that vessel IS m Its cavernous stage; and lastly, of a small branch which enters tlie foramen lacerum anteriusin basicranii, derived from the ascending pharyngeal. The posterior consist ot two branches on each side, namely, the occi- pito-meningeal, which enters the cranium through the jugular foramen, and the vertebro-meningeal, that pass into the cranium by the foramen magnum,_these ves- sels being derived from the trunks which their names indicate. _ The Nervous Supply of the Dura Mater is exceed- ingly obscure, but its source may be stated as bein? trom the iourth, frontal and Casserian ganglion of the nith pair. AuACHNoiD Membrane belongs to the class of serous tissues, being a shut sac, consisting of two portions, namely, a parietal and visceral layer; the former ad- hering most intimately to the internal surface of the dura mater, except in the situation of the sella turcica where the pituitary body is interposed between them' tne latter covering the suri'ace of the brain, passing over Its involutions and binding the convolutions to each other. It IS connected by its deep surface to the pia ma- ter, which lies beneatli it, by a tine areolar tissue, but618 KERVOUS SYSTEM. certainly not by any distinct membrane, as supposed by Dr. Sharpey,—the subarachnoid fluid occupying this po- sition being in all probability derived from the pia mater, as the deep surface of the arachnoid is devoid of epithe- lial investment. On the summit of the brain the mem- brane is fine and weak, but increases in density and thickness at its base, in the situation of the sub-arach- noid spaces. These latter are four in number, namely, middle, two lateral, and the posterior: the middle cor- responding to that medullary space which is of an hexa- gonal shape, and bounded laterally by the middle lobes, in front by the anterior, and behind by the crura cere- bri and pons varolii. From this there are six openings or outlets, viz.:—Anteriorly, thetermination of the great longitudinal fissure by which the anterior cerebral ar- teries escape; laterally, the fissures of Sylvius for the exit of the middle cerebral; posteriorly and laterally, it opens into the inferior cornu of the lateral ventricle by the anterior extremity of the great semilunar notch of Bichat, which lies between the inner edge of the middle lobe (lobule of the transverse fissure) on the outside, and the tractus opticus and crus cerebri on the inside, the choroid plexus and artery also passing through it on each side; and posteriorly, the median groove of the pons gives passage to the basilar artery, constituting the sixth opening of communication; over this space the arach- noid membrane is stretched, covering loosely the circle of Willis and the parts contained in it. The subarach- noid tissue appears to be the seat of meningeal tubercu- losis. Lateral Subarachnoid Space corresponds to the fissure of Sylvius, where the arachnoid is stretched from the anterior to the middle lobes, and it communicates internally with the middle or great space. Posterior Subarachnoid Space corresponds to the floor of the fourth ventricle, and connects the posterior surface of the medulla oblongata to the inferior surface of the cerebellum. j • 4. 1 These spaces, and indeed all that prolonged interval between the pia mater and the arachnoid, is occupied by the subarachnoid fluid, which serves to adapt the varying size of the brain to the cavity m which it is1/ PIA MATER, 619 contained; but the predominance of the fluid inferiorly in the vicinity of the large vessels which supply the or- gan would seem to imply an equalizing function in re- ference to the cerebral circulation. In the description of the visceral portion of the arachnoid membrane we have not as yet alluded to that involuted part particu- larly noticed by Bichat, and after him by Monro. If the posterior part of the hemispheres is raised, immedi- ately above the superior vermiform process of the cere- bellum the venffi Galens are seen emerging, and around them a process of arachnoid entering the centre of the brain, while in connexion with them we may often ob- serve a circular aperture (foramen of Bichat); but this, however, is not always present. Still we hardly think that the latter occurrence, even if constant, should ne- gative the fact of the continuity of the whole arachnoid; and we would believe, from the frequent examinations of fojtal brains, that the perfect continuity of ventri- cular and external arachnoid should be received as an established fact; nor is the similarity which has been traced between the foramen of Bichat and that of Wins- low in the abdomen the effort of imagination that some writers seem to think. Dr. Sharpey conceives that a distinct but fine serous layer lines the subarachnoid spaces, and may also reach the ventricles, passing down in a similar situation to line the subarachnoid space of the cord; but the absence of an epithelial layer on the deep surface of the arachnoid is sufficient to render this view at least questionable. The arachnoid consists of a surface layer of pavement epithelium, with a thin basement membrane, supported by a fine but lax areo- lar tissue. Its vascular supply is limited, perhaps only amounting to nutritive imbibition, and even when in- flamed It fails to exhibit any trace of vascularity, beintr only rendered opaque in that morbid condition. The use of this membrane appears to be for the purpose of facilitating the almost imperceptible movements of the brain, synchronous with the circulatory and respiratory rhythms. J PiA Mater—An areolo-vascular membrane covers the surface of the brain, sinking into the involutions which it lines, and likewise sending into the interiorNERVOUS SYSTEM, 620 of the organ processes, which are seven in number,— namely, the choroid plexuses of the lateral, third and fourth ventricles, and the velum iuterpositum. By its superficial surface it is connected loosely to the arach- noid, many intervals existing between them; for in- stance,—at the subarachnoid spaces corresponding to the involutions at the inferior cornu of the lateral ven- tricles ; and lastly, at the sulcus for the olfactory nerves, while the deep surface is connected to the cortical struc- ture of the brain by vessels which tear the cineritious substance when the membrane is forcibly removed. The pia mater represents the nutritious membrane of the brain, being similar to the neurilemma of the nerves, and is likewise of utility in allowing the vessels to break up to an extreme degree of tenuity prior to their entrance into the yielding medullary matter,—in this way tending to diminish the impulse of the circulating system, which might either injure or exercise too sti- mulating an effect otherwise on the organ, its function being similar to the retes of Galen and Hovius in that respect. THE BRAIN. Many different modes are adopted for the examina- tion of this central organ of the nervous system, each having its peculiar utility, either in reference to the display of the formation of the organ or to the relative position of the several bodies which compose it. In pro- secuting the former inquiry, the organ may be dissected from below upwards, and in the latter from above down- wards; but as the student cannot pursue with advan- tage the whole investigation on a single brain, we prefer the mode by which he" becomes at first conversant with the number, size, position, and relations of the indivi- dual parts of which it is composed, prior to his pro- ceeding with the more complicated examination ot its anatomy, as implied by its development and those phy- siological relations which the several parts bear to each other. Tiie brain is divided into cerebrum, cerebellum, ana medulla oblongata,—the first being the great brain, the second the lesser, and the third the primordial portionCEREBRUM. 621 of the whole mass. The cerebrum is of an ovoid shape, larger behind than before, consisting on its upper sur- face of two hemispheres, separated by the great longi- tudinal fissure, each representing the figure of a quarter sphere. Externally and superiorly the surface is con- vex and irregular, marked by alternate elevations and depressions, the former being called convolutions or gyri, the latter, involutions or sulci. These convolu- tions are much diversified in shape and size, as well as in direction, but still some few generally present a uni- form character in all cases, and to these we will allude in the examination of the different surfaces of the brain. Those on the upper aspect may be divided into frontal, occipital, and parietal,—the first varying from three to seven in number, and taking a direction from before backwards; the second consisting of three, and runnino- from without inwards; whilst the third, varying from five to eight, pursue an exceedingly tortuous course trom before backwards: all these are separated by in- volutions, which pass to variable depths, separating the convolutions like depressions of elevation. The parts entering into the formation of the convolu- tions may now be examined by slicing off a portion of the surface. The arachnoid and pia mater form the most superficial covering, and next in order is seen the grey or cineritious matter, about a quarter of an inch in depth ; while internal to the last, the white or fibrous structure occurs. These elevations are merely the re- sult of a folding of the cerebral surface, there beino- no absolute mterruption of continuity, which may be proved by removmg the arachnoid, when the irregularities may be effaced with facility, the surface becoming perfectly- smooth, a similar condition being consequent on the in- ternal chronic form of hydrocephalus, as remarked by Sir E. Home. Their existence has been accounted for in different ways:—In the first place, the brain growing from below upwards meets with the opposing cranial bones, and the surface becomes folded, to accommodate irself to the small space within the calvarium ; secondly by the diverging fibres being of different lengths, some reaching the convolutions, while others pass only so far622 NERVOUS SYSTEM. as the involutions; and lastly, by the peripheral fibres being plaited on themselves. It is probable that they increase the surface on which the vessels are primarily ramified, but that their size and number exercises any peculiar influence on the psychical manifestations is at present without sufficient proof The internal surface of each hemisphere is flat, and separated from its fellow by the great longitudinal fissure, containing the falx cerebri, which in the majority of cases constitutes a septum be- tween them; but in some rare examples the greater part of the falx has been noticed deficient when the two hemispheres were fused with each other. The longi- tudinal fissure passes completely through the cerebrum before and behind, but in the centre the corpus callo- sum renders it imperlect. If now the hemispheres are gently drawn asunder the arachnoid will be seen uniting them on the upper surface of the corpus callosum, this latter coming into view when that membrane is torn. On the internal surface of the hemisphere a well-marked and persistent lobule is observed, called callosal lobule, outlet, or gyrus fornicatus, which, passing in an arched direction above the corpus callosum, bends forwards and downwards on the inner surface of the anterior lobe, anterior to which, and eccentric to its curve, lies the proper lobule of the anterior lobe; behind, bending downwards and backwards, it is continued along the inferior surface of the brain to the inner edge of the middle lobe, where it bounds the transverse fissure ex- ternally; so that the fissure of Sylvius is the only point of interruption in the continuity of this lobule; supe- riorly its margin is serrated, constituting the crest of Vic d'Azir, whilst its inferior surface is separated from the corpus callosum by the ventricle of the hemisphere, into which the handle of a scalpel can be passed. Now cut ofi" one hemisphere to the level of the corpus callosum, and the centrum ovale minus of Vic d'Azir will be exposed. This consists of a central surface ol white or fibrous structure, surrounded byawavylme of cineritious or grey matter,-some red points being also visible, indicating the extremities of vessels divided by the incision. On removing the opposite hemisphere,CEREBRUM. 623 the whole surface represents the centrum ovale majus of Vieussens, containing in the median line the corpus callosum. Corpus Callosum, or Commissura Magna Cerebri, consists of a white strong layer of transverse fibres uniting the hemispheres of opposite sides. It is from four to five inches in length, situated nearer the anterior than the posterior part of the brain, and presents for description two surfaces, two margins, with an anterior and posterior extremity. The superior surface, convex from before backwards, corresponds to the hemispheres, from which it is separated by the hemispheric ventricle' also to the callosal arteries and the arachnoid membrane,' which separates it from the concave margin of the falx cerebri; on this surface are seen the following parts: Directly in the median line, running from before back- wards, a depression (raphe) indicating the union of the opposite sides of the brain, and on either side of it two white longitudinal filaments, not unfrequently absent (longitudinal nerves of Lancisi), and about a quarter ot an inch external to these are the grooves for the cal- losal arteries, and still more externally the covered bands of Reil, which are likewise longitudinal, lying on Its surface beneath the gyrus fornicatus. The inferior surface, concave, corresponds in the mesian line ante- riorly to the septum lucidum, but more posteriorly seems blended with the fornix, while on either side it corresponds to the anterior cornu and body of the late- ral ventricle; the margins inclose between them the width of the corpus callosum, which is about one inch and a half, but much wider behind than before and they receive the converging fibres of the hemispheres which, forming the principal structure of this body' unite in its central raphe. The anterior extremity is curved downwards and backwards, constitutino- the genu, then, dividing into a central and two lateral bands, the former passes almost horizontally backwards above the anterior communicating artery and optic com- missure, being intimately connected with the latter and continuous with the grey floor (lamina cinerea) of the third ventricle and tuber cinereum, the latter curv624 NERVOUS SYSTEM. ing also downwards, backwards, and outwards on the external side of the tractus opticus, terminating where the transverse and Sylvian fissures unite. These are named callosal pedicles, and they form the lateral boun- daries of the lamina cinerea. The posterior extremity (splenium) of the corpus callosum is thick, round, and cushion-like (Bourelet), corresponding to the superior vermiform process of the cerebellum, from which it is separated by the transverse fissure, containing t^eyelum interpositum and the venas Galeni. In the middle line of the posterior edge, the raphe appears exceedmgly deep and this has been erroneously attributed to the pulsations of the brain tilting it against the falx cere- bri On each side its fibres can be traced into the pos- terior and inferior cornua of the lateral ventricles, ex- panding in that situation to give a white investment to the hippocampus major and minor. ■ ^- e Let the student now proceed to the examination ot the cerebral ventricles, which are five m ^^J^b^^;- namely, two lateral, the third, fourth, and fifth; the first being symmetrical, the three latter asymmetrical, and situated in the median line of the organ. Lateral VENTRiCLES.-These may be opened by making a superficial incision through the corpus callo- Tum ol one side of the raphe, then, by turning the me- dullary structure outwards, and following the cavity m a direction outwards and forwards anteriorly, and back- wards and inwards posteriorly, while a --lar'iiss^^^^^ tion may also be made on the opposite side; lastly, pic ce the knife at the posterior extremity of the optic thala- mus and carry an incision downwards and forwards TwUs the fisLre of Sylvius. Each lateral ventr^de is curved like an Italic S, converging anteriorly, and di- ve gng posteriorly, and is divided into an anterior and posirior cornu, with an intervening body, and also an -"Z^Z^T^^:^^ is hounded superiorly, ex^CEREBRUM. 525 ■whilst the floor is formed from without inwards and backwards—by the tail or narrow extremity of the cor- pus striatum, tania semicircularis, optic thalamus cho- roid plexus, and fornix. ' The Posterior Cornu is bounded superiorly, ex- ternally, and internally, by the medullary subst'anc'e, and mferiorly by the hippocampus minor and the di- gital fossa. The Inferior Cornu is incurvated in its direction passing at first outwards and backwards, then down- wards, forwards, and inwards, towards the internal ex- tremity of the fissure of Sylvius, and is bounded exter- nally by the medullary structure; internally by arach- noid membrane; above by the tail of the corpus stria- tum, tEBUia semicircularis, and posterior part of the optic thalamus; and inferiorly by the hippocampus major and pes hippocampi, teenia hippocampi, fascia dentata and choroid plexus. ' Now divide the corpus callosum about its centre re- flecting one portion backwards and the other forwards which will display the septum lucidum and cavity of the fifth ventricle. •' Septum Lucidum.—A triangular lamina of grey and white medullary structure, forming a vertical partition between the bodies of the lateral ventricles, the base before and below, the apex above and behind, attached superiorly and anteriorly to the corpus callosum, and posteriorly and inferiorly to tlie fornix and anterior commissure, the cavity of the fifth ventricle being situ- ated m its centre, and each lateral wall consisting of four layers,-namely, most externally arachnoid, then a grey, internal to which is a white layer; and lastly, arachnoid again lining the cavity of the fifth ventricle- the latter being bounded above and before by the corpus callosum, below and behind by the fornix and anterior commissure, and laterally by the layers of the septum lucidum. The arachnoid lining this cavity constitutes a closed sac in the adult, but in the fcetus it is con- nected by the canal ofWenzel with the foramen com- mune antenus, and thus with the general arachnoid cavity but this communication disappears early la cases, however, of chronic internal hydrocephalus it fre- 2 E626 NERVOUS SYSTEM. quently is seen present, with well-defined margins. The walls of the cavity are usually thin and diapha- nous, but we have seen them fully one-eighth of an inch in thickness. FoENix.—A triangular lamina of white medullary structure, with the base behind and the apex in front. It arises posteriorly by three bands on each side,—one from the ttenia, the second from the hippocampus major, and the third from the hippocampus minor; these unite, forming a flat band, which coalesces with that of the opposite side to form the body of the fornix, and then, curving forwards, it dips downwards and backwards, dividing into the two descending pillars, which, piercing the grey floor of the third ventricle, terminate withm the circle of Willis in the corpora albicantia. The fornix consists of longitudinal fibres, occasionally exhibitmg a median splitting into two symmetrical halves ; on which account the name of twain band has sometime^ been applied to it. The upper surface corresponds to the corpus callosum and septum lucidum; the mferior hes on the velum interpositum and the foramen commun^ anterius, while its margins are bounded by the choroid plexuses. n • + • Now divide it transversely, and reflect its anterioi and posterior portions. In the former segment its pillar^ can be seen descending as thick round cords behind the anterior commissure, and in front of the foramen com- mune anterius, receiving in their course the followmc reinforcing structures:—The horizontal peduncles_ o the pineal gland, with the ttenia semicircularis, whicl ioin them in the foramen commune anterius, whilst oi the inner side of the optic thalami they receive som. fibres from those bodies; and lastly, they acquire som. additional tissue from the grey floor of the third ventrij cle. On the posterior part of the fornix, at its under sur, face, a peculiar arrangement, called lyra or corpus psal loides, may be observed, consisting of the transversa fibres of the posterior extremity of the corpus callo sum, which appear between the converging roots ot tn- ^° Velum lNTERPOsiTUM.-This consists of a double foL of the pia mater, which enters at the transverse fissurCEREBRUM. g27 of Bicliat, -which is situated at the posterior part of the brain, below the corpus callosum and fornix, and above the superior vermiform process of the cerebellum, and the tubercula quadrigemina. This is merely the trans- verse portion of the great semilunar notch, which may still be traced downwards and forwards on each side of the base of the brain, between the crura cerebri and middle lobes, thus constituting the longitudinal portion of the fissure; through the former the velum interpo- situm enters the brain, and by the latter the choroid plexuses pass into the inferior cornua of the lateral ven- tricles. The velum interpositum consists of a double fold of pia mater, and is triangular in shape, the apex in front, and the base behind, terminating at the foramen commune anterius by uniting with the choroid plexuses, which coiirse along its margins; between the folds of the ve- lum, the vena; Galeni, arachnoid canal, and the pineal gland are situated, and it lies beneath the fornix con- cealing certain parts which will be again noticed when the relative anatomy of the several bodies in the lateral ventricles will be examined. Corpus SxRiATUM—Pyriform in shape, the lamer extremity being directed forwards and inwards the smaller upwards, backwards, and outwards; it is grey on Its external surface, but both white and grey within which has given origin to its name. It corresponds above to the floor of the anterior cornu and body of the lateral ventricle below to the fissure of Sylvius, the island of Reil, and inferior cornu of lateral ventricle- ex- ternally to a white medullary capsule and the substance of the hemisphere; and internally to the anterior com- missure, septum lucidum, sides of the foramen com- mune anterius, tfBnia semicircularis, and optic thala- mus If a section is now made longitudinally into its substance, an horizontal layer of white fibres will be ob served passing outwards to reach the hemisphere an peanng to divide this body into an upper, or vent'ricii- lar, and an inferior, or extraventricular portion, and m addition to these, white fibres from the anterior com' missure radiate through its anterior part. This is thp most vascular body in the brain, and is frequently She628 NERVOUS SYSTEM. seat of apoplectic clots, as well as of acute and chronic ramollissement. T^NiA Semicircularis—A flattened band of me- dullary substance, lying between the corpus striatum and the optic thalamus; arises from the corpus genicu- latum externum on the posterior part of the optic tha- lamus, runs downwards, forwards, and inwards, and joins the descending pillars of the fornix in the fora- men commune anterius. It is of a yellowish white co- lour, and adheres intimately to the two bodies between which it runs, near its anterior part being much thick- ened, a condition depending on the density of the arach- noid'covering in this situation (lamina cornea); the vein of the corpus striatum lies beneath this point, which frequently gives it a bluish tint. The t^nia constitutes a part of the fibres of conjunction, unitmg parts on one side of the middle line, as the. fornix and optic thalamus. Optic Thalami are ovoid bodies placed between tJie divergent or pointed extremities of the corpora striata; they are somewhat brownish grey in colour, and each corresponds above to the body of the lateral ventricle, choroid plexus, fornix, and velum interpositum; infe- riorly, in its two posterior thirds, to the inferior cornu of the lateral ventricle, and in its anterior to the crus cerebri; externally to the corpus striatum and taenia semicircularis, and more deeply to a mass of white sub- stance (double semicircular centre), which forms a sep- tum between it and the corpus striatum; internally it corresponds from before backwards to the descending pillars of the fornix, choroid plexus, peduncles of the pineal gland, commissura mollis, third ventricle, crura cerebri, posterior commissure, and the vertical pedun- cles of the pineal gland; the posterior extremities are notched, being divided into two tubercles,—corpora ceniculata externa and interna,—the former givmg ori- gin to one root of the optic nerve, with thet^nia semi- circularis; the latter also gives origin to the second root of the nerve, and lies in contact with the nates; whilst the anterior extremities, smaller than the poste- rior, correspond to the foramen commune anterms. ihe opti^c thalami are composed of grey matter, through1 CEREBRUM. g29 which the white fibres of the crura pass to the cerebral hemispheres, as well as the posterior commissure, which enters them posteriorly and internally. Choroid Plexuses are also symmetrical, being com- posed of a fold of pia mater, and occupying the inferior cornua and bodies of the lateral ventricles. It enters the horizontal portion of the great semilunar notch at the base of the brain, which is situated between the inner edge of the middle lobe (lobule of the transverse fissure) externally, and the crus cerebri and tractus opticus in- ternally; and it passes through the inferior cornu of the lateral ventricle, having above it the optic thalamus, and below it the tsnia and pes hippocampi; it now ascends obliquely upwards and backwards, followino- the concavity of the hippocampus major in the inferior cornu, then, winding round the posterior extremity of the optic thalamus, it passes downwards, forwards, and inwards, on its superior aspect, lying in the body of the lateral ventricle, and on the outer margin of the fornix, beneath which it dips to terminate at the fora- men commune anterius, by joining the velum, with which, however, its margin is continuous for some dis- tance previously. The choroid plexus contains at its outer margin the choroid branch of the internal carotid artery, and the vein of the corpus striatum runs beneath It in Its course to the ven« Galeni. In structure it con- sists of the lining membrane of the ventricles, includins? a fold of pia mater, in which small cells are very often seen We have repeatedly observed them so numerous as almost wholly to obscure the vascular structure of the part. Hippocampus MmoR._Unguis or ergot lobule; lies on the inner and inferior part of the posterior cornu of the lateral ventricle, and is merely an involuted convo- lution of the brain; it is white on its surface, containing withm a large mass of grey matter, while in shape it resembles a half crescent, convex outwards and for- wards, large and round posteriorly, small and pointed m tront, where it is continuous with the fornix- im- mediately on its outer side a deep triangular fossette is tound, called digital fossa, bounded internally by the hin- pocampus minor, anteriorly by the hippocampus major630 NERVOUS SYSTEM. m and externally by the medullary substance; this space is subject to much variation as to size, and is sometimes absent. Hippocampus Major is situated in the inferior cornu of the lateral ventricle, being variously known as the cornu ammonis, or foot of the seahorse. It is a conoidal eminence, curved on itself, having its larger extremity turned downwards and forwards, either bulbous or di- vided by a notch into two tubercles (pes hippocampi), a third or smaller tubercle often being visible above the last (pes accessorius); the smaller end is directed up- wards and backwards, then curves forwards to be con- tinuous with the fornix; its concave surface looks for- wards and inwards, bordered by the taenia or corpus fimbriatum; it consists of an external white capsule, derived from the corpus callosum, and an internal mass of grey matter, and it resembles the hippocampus mi- nor in being an involuted convolution of the brain. TiENiA Hippocampi, or Corpus FiMBRiATUii, is seen by raising the choroid plexus, which usually conceals it ; this small, flat, white band lies in the concavity of the hippocampus major, arising below from the pes, and then, passing upwards and backwards, terminates in the posterior root of the fornix. Fascia Dentata is seen by raising the inner margin of thetsenia; it is immediately connected with the inner edge of the hippocampus major, and consists of a linear band of grey substance, indented or crenated at the in- ternal margin, and hence the name fascia dentata. Let the student now recur to the examination ot tne velum interpositum, the relative anatomy of which Has already been disposed of, except that of its inferior sur- face, and also the contents of the fold, viz., vena^ Galeni, arachnoid canal, and pineal gland. VENiE Galeni are formed by the choroid and striate vein, the former commencing posteriorly and then mn- Bing forwards, having received the veins from tl e two hip?ocampi, the latter also commencing poster orly and coursing forwards in the groove between the corpus stril urn and optic thalamus, under the t^"^.«^- cularis, and at the foramen commune anterius both un te to form the ven^ galeni; these latter, sometimes single,631 CEEEBRUM. but generally double, emerge from within the brain by the transverse fissure, and open into the straight sinus. Now divide the velum cautiously, avoiding the re- moval of the pineal gland, and beneath the former will be seen the— Choroid Plexuses of the Third Ventricle.—Two small granulated folds of pia mater that pass forwards on the upper surface of the optic thalami, united by their margins with the similar structures of the lateral ventricles, and not unfrequently being absent altogether. The following parts are now brought into view from before backwards, and may be examined individually: Anterior commissure, descending pillars of the fornix, foramen commune anterius, commissura mollis covering the third ventricle, foramen commune posterius, pos- terior commissure, transverse band of the pineal gland with its peduncles, pineal gland resting on the tuber- cula quadrigemina, valve of Vieussens, origin of the fourth nerve, processus a cerebello ad testes, and lastly, the superior vermiform process of the cerebellum. Anterior Commissure.—A thick, white, round cord of white medullary tissue, stretched between the an- terior and internal parts of the corpora striata, in which their fibres radiate in their course to the cerebral he- mispheres, where some believe them to be continuous with the external roots of the olfactory nerves. In its course it is a little curved, being convex forwards, and it is related behind to the descending pillars of the for- nix ; before and above to the septum lucidum, and be- low to the lamina cinerea. Foramen Commune Anterius (Monroe).—This aper- ture, first described by the anatomist whose name it bears, is bounded above and before by the fornix and the anterior commissure; posteriorly by the optic tha- lami, choroid plexuses, and velum; laterally communicat- ing with the lateral, and below with the third ventricle, and in the fcctus also with the fifth by the canal of Wenzel; it transmits the arachnoid lining into those cavities, being thus traced by its discoverer. This mem- brane enters by the foramen of Bichat, forming a canal lymg below the velum (we believe between its layers), and at the foramen commune anterius it passes into the632 NERVOUS SYSTEM. lateral, third, and fifth ventricles; as a membrane it is thin and fine, consisting of a surface layer of pavement epithelium, ciliated according to Henle, simple, accord- ing to Hassal, beneath which is a basement membrane, but the areolar tissue which is subjacent in other situa- tions is here imperceptible. CoMMissuRA Mollis vel Media.—A transverse la- mina of grey neurine, uniting the inner and upper mar- gins of the optic thalami, corresponding above to the velum and peduncles of the pineal gland; below, to the thirdventricle; anteriorly and posteriorly, to the anterior and posterior common holes; and on tearing through its soft structure the third ventricle is exposed. Third Ventricle consists of a chink or fissure be- tween the optic thalami, deeper and wider before than behind; bounded laterally by the optic thalami, and also in the inferior half by the crura cerebri, lined by a layer of grey matter; anteriorly by the foramen commune an- terius, descending pillars of the fornix, and the anterior commissure; posteriorly by the foramen commune pos- terius, posterior commissure, pineal gland, and tubercula quadrigemina; superiorly by the commissura mollis, velum, and fornix; and inferiorly by the lamina ciuerea, optic commissura, tuber cinereum, corpora albicantia, middle perforated plate, and origin of the third nerve, or the parts from before backwards in the circle of Willis. There are three, sometimes four openings com- municating with this ventricle,—namely, foramen com- mune anterius, infundibulum, and the aqueduct of Sylvius, with occasionally the foramen commune pos- terius when it is pervious; by the first the arachnoid enters the cavity at its upper and anterior part; by the second, which commences at the central part of the floor, a connexion is established between the ventricle and the pituitary body; by the third, which commences supe- riorly and posteriorly, the arachnoid passes to the fourth ventricle. • j i f Foramen Commune Posterius.—Lies behind the sott commissure, and in front of the posterior, and bounded on each side by the horizontal peduncles of the puieal gland; it is usually cajcal, but occasionally we have seen it giving passage to a few arterial twigs, as well as a slipCEREBRUM. 633 from the choroid plexus, communicating in the latter case with the third ventricle. Posterior Commissure—A thin, round, white band, smaller than the anterior, uniting the inner and pos- terior parts of the optic thalami, bounded above by the pineal peduncles; behind, by the anterior edge of the tubercula quadrigemina; before, by the foramen com- mune posterius; and below, by the aqueduct of Sylvius. Pineal Gland.—Triangular or heart-shaped, with its base before, and apex behind; the former being named acervulus, the latter, the conarium; and wh^ in situ lying between the layers of the velum interpositum, and connected to the brain by its peduncles; it is supported by the tubercula quadrigemina, whilst the vena; Galeni correspond to its upper surface. Sometimes we have seen it perfectly flat and round, at the same time vary- ing much in size and density. It is of a light grey colour, and consists of vesicular matter, the cells being granular and candate, and in the centre containing cal- careous bodies of a stony hardness and rounded form the larger being visible to the naked eye; but when viewed with a half or quarter-inch object-glass they bear much resemblance to masses of fat, each being composed of numerous, distinct, or aggregate lesser pieces or strongly; and it is in this circumstance, as well as in their large size, that the resemblance borne by these bodies to masses of fat con- sists. In the natural condition these bodies are hard and brittle, after, however, the application of dilute ni- tric acid, they become soft, the earthy matter being dis- solved away. If, however, the acid employed be some- what stronger, these bodies undergo a singular chan/re m form and appearance: the cellated spaces become almost lost to view, and then these compound struc- tures assume the characters of large spherical cells ex- hibitmg numerous concentric lamellaa. The earthy mat- ter then IS contained in these cells, or cellated spaces, the acid dissolves this away, and the entire body becomes so soft, as to admit readily of being torn to pieces with needles; m this state its structure can be easily deter- mined, and is seen to consist of membranous elastic tissue. 2e 3634 NEEVOUS SYSTEM. These bodies originate in exceedingly small and bright circular discs, which, when seen with the quarter-inch object-glass, are less in size than the head of a pin ; in this appears, first one, and afterwards other divisions, indicating the compound or cellular character, which they ultimately more completely exhibit. The earthy matter entering into their composition consists of phosphate of lime, a small portion of phos- phate of magnesia, and a trace of carbonate of lime. These bodies, which are almost peculiar to the human subject, are stated not to occur in the pineal gland until after the age of seven years (Hassal's Microscopic Ana- tomy, page 535). 1 • .1 I -J We have seen similar bodies, not only m the choroid plexus, but likewise in the velum interpositum, but in- variably in old subjects. Peduncles of the Gland (Haben^).—These are four in number, two being horizontal, and a similar number vertical; the former are connected posteriorly with the transverse band of the gland, which lies above the pos- terior commissure, then, diverging and passing forwards above the inner margins of the optic thalami, they join the descending pillars of the fornix; the latter or vertical peduncles can only be seen by making a longitudinal vertical section of the brain; they arise from the base ot the gland, and, passing downwards on the inner and pos- terior part of the optic thalami, are lost on the back part of the floor of the third ventricle. Descartes believed the pineal gland to be the seat ot the soul, and Magendie conceived the equally absurd opinion, that it acted as a plug to the iter a tertio ad quartum ventriculum. i i + TuBERCULA QuADRtGEMiNA.—A quadrilateral plate of medullary structure, lying on the superior suriace ot the pons varolii; covered by the velum interpositum, pineal gland, and posterior commissure, and correspona- ing behind to the valve of Vieussens and the processus a cerebello ad testes, whilst it is related anteriorly to the third ventricle and posterior commissure. -^A^e su- perior surface is divided by an antero-postenor hssure Is well as a transverse, which latter is semilunar t e concavity being directed forwards, thus producmg fourCEREBRUM. 635 bodies, two anterior and superior,—the nates; and two lying posterior and inferior to the last,—the testes: the former being oval and grey, their long measurement di- rected obliquely outwards and forwards; the latter much smaller and usually white; the optic nerves are con- nected to the nates and not unfrequently also to the testes. Aqueduct of Sylvius, or, Iter a Tertio ad Quartum Ventriculum If a probe is introduced beneath the posterior commissure and tubercula quadrigemina, and above the pons varolii, it will enter the fourth ventricle at its upper and anterior part through a canal directed obliquely downwards and backwards, through which the arachnoid membrane passes to line the cavity of the fourth ventricle. Now slit the medullary layer forming the roof of the fourth ventricle, having previously drawn backwards the superior vermiform process of the cerebellum, which overhangs it. Fourth Ventricle, or, Ventricle of the Cerebel- lum—This cavity is bounded above by the valve of Vieussens and the superior vermiform process of the cerebellum; inferiorly by the posterior surfacfe of the medulla oblongata, calamus scriptorius, and the arach- noid membrane stretched from the medulla to the cere- bellum ; anteriorly by the pons varolii; posteriorly by the cerebellum; and laterally by the processus a cerebello ad testes. "We will now proceed to examine each wall in detail. Valve of Vieussens.—A triangular lamina of grey neurine, thin and semitransparent, called by Haller the velum interjectum; it is triangular in figure, the base situated below and behind, the apex above and before, the margins attached to the superior cerebellar peduncles (processus a cerebello ad testes), the apex to the testes, and the inferior part or base lost in the middle lobe of the cerebellum; the superior surface, concave, is covered by the superior vermiform process, where it is attached to the linguetta, and more anteriorly a few grey trans- verse fibres are seen, from v/hich arise the fourth pair of nerves; whilst, running from before backwards, a grey elevated line may sometimes be observed, which is calledNERVOUS SYSTEM. 636 the columella; the inferior anterior surface, somewhat convex, bounds the fourth ventricle and the aqueduct of Sylvius above. Vieussens believed that this lamina acted as a valve to the aqueduct of Sylvius, but this is ob- viously an error, and it is only when a transverse sec- tion is made near the anterior part of the superior cerebellar peduncles that any such appearance exists. We will now more particularly describe the walls of the fourth ventricle. This cavity is of a rhomboidal figure, contracted above and below, and expanded in the centre, the anterior inferior wall being ibrmed by that portion of the isthmus encephali consisting of the pons varolii and the posterior surface of the medulla oblongata, on which the restiform bodies, posterior pyra- mids, and calamus scriptorius, are seen; the superior posterior wall is formed by the valve of Vieussens and superior vermiform process; its posterior, by the cere- bellum ; and still more inferiorly by the arachnoid mem- brane and valvules Tarini, which are merely thickened portions of the pia mater passing from the cerebellum to the cord; the anterior superior angle corresponds to the aqueduct of Sylvius, and the inferior communicates with the spinal subarachnoid space, whilst the lateral are formed by the processus a cerebello ad testes. The choroid plexus of the fourth ventricle are two folds of pia mater, narrow below, but expanding somewhat in their ascent; they pass upwards and outwards from the inferior vermiform process, as far as the centre of the fourth ventricle, then turn horizontally outwards on the back-part of the restiform bodies, here separating the portio mollis and dura of the seventh pair of nerves, and, having reached the under surface of the subpedun- cular lobules, they expand on their surface, becoming continuous with the general pia mater. Let the student now reverse that portion of the brain which remains, or, what is preferable, procure a fresh organ for the examination of the base. The brain, on its inferior surface, is somewhat irre- o-ular, and divided into three lobes, which are symme- trical on each side of the mesian line, named anterior, middle, and posterior. The anterior is triangular, the base anteriorly and externally, the apex posteriorly andCEREBRUM, g37 internally, at the optic commissure separated from that of the opposite side by the anterior extremity of the great longitudinal fissure, and from the middle lobe by the fissure of Sylvius; the inferior surface, concave and irregular, rests on the orbital plates of the frontal and lesser wings of the sphenoid bones, presenting a groove or sulcus in which is imbedded the olfactory nerve, a single longitudinal convolution always existing on the internal side of that sulcus. The fissure of Sylvius takes a direction upwards, backwards, and outwards, passing to an indefinite extent between the anterior and middle lobes; and on carefully unravelling the surface of the former, where it rests on the latter, a second smaller fissure is seen passing vertically upwards cir- cumscribing the island of Eeil; within the fissure of Sylvius the external root of the olfactory nerve, middle cerebral artery, and island of Keil, are found, the arach- noid membrane passing over it and separating the sphe- noidal fold of dura mater from the middle cerebral ar- tery. The middle lobe is convex inferiorly, and bounded behind by a superficial depression which corresponds to the superior angle of the petrous portion of the tempo- ral bone; in front by the fissure of Sylvius, and inter- nally by the circle of Willis and the parts it contains; on Its internal margin a convolution is always present' bounding externally the transverse fissure, formed by the interior termination of the callosal lobule (Ourlet) _ The posterior lobe is triangular, but pointed poste- riorly, concave on its inferior surface, and supported by the tentorium cerebelli, being separated from that of the opposite side by the posterior extremity of the o-reat longitudinal fissure. It is marked inferiorly by nume- rous large and winding convolutions, which are all con- tinuations of the lobule of the transverse fissure In the middle line of the base of the brain the fol- lowmg parts present themselves for examination •_!

In this situation a vascular circle, or more properly an heptagonal vascular space, exists, known as the circle of Willis, bounded in front by the anterior communicating and anterior cerebral arteries, laterally by the internal carotid with the posterior communicating branch, and behind, by the basilar artery with the posterior cere- bral; several of the parts before enumerated he within this space, namely, from before backwards,—lamma cinerea, optic commissure, tuber cinereum, with the m- fundibulum, corpora albicantia, middle perforated plate, inner margins of the crura cerebri, and the origin of the third nerve (see Vascular System). Let each of the parts enumerated be now examined carefully. Lamina Cinerea—This consists of a grey layer, con- tinuous in front with the rostrum of the corpus callo- sum, and, passing backwards, is attached to the optic commissure and tuber cinereum, whilst superiorly it la continuous with the grey lining of the third ventricle, and pierced by the descending pillars of the lornix. Optic Commissure.—(See Anatomy of Nerves). Tuber Cinereum.—A grey body of a small size, and reniform in figure, convex anteriorly, and notched pos- teriorly, attached above to the grey floor of the third ventricle, before to the optic commissure, and below and behind to the infundibulum which lies in its notch or hvlus. It consists principally of granular cells, many ot which are yellowish, and so soft that they break down into a pultaceous mass on the slightest pressure; we have also observed a cavity in its centre. Infundibulum.—A grey tube surrounded by arach- noid large above where it communicates with the iloor of the third ventricle, smaller inferiorly, and attached to the pituitary gland; within the tube the arachnoid is continued downwards, as far as the superior third, where it terminates in a ad de sac. Pituitary Body or Gland—Au oval body about the size of a horse-bean, situated in the se la turcica above the dura mater, and beneath the arachnoid and surrounded by the circular sinuses It is divided into an anterior and posterior lobe: the former being dense,CEREBRUM. 639 and consisting of granular cells imbedded in fibrous lo- culi; the latter soft, -with larger cells, and a smaller amount of fibrous tissue, and it receives the pointed ex- tremity of the infundibulum. This body sometimes contains a cavity, but usually the centre is occupied by a yellowish-white substance, and is much larger in all the lower order of vertebrata than in man, and in the for- mer always containing a cavity. It is also much larger at the middle of intra-uterine life than at birth, and at the former period a central ampulla exists, which com- municates with the third ventricle. The use of this body is still obscure, some believing it to be a ganglion of the sympathetic (Budge); others, glandular, as Monroe; but neither of these opinions are supported by the exa- mination of its structure. Corpora ALBicANxrA vel Candicantia, are two small hemispherical bodies, lying in front of the middle perforated plate, and behind the tuber cinereum, receiv- ing superiorly the descending pillars of the fornix, and being separated from each other by a deep fissure, pro- ducing that symmetrical arrangement peculiar to man and the carnivora; as in other vertebrata they form a single and undivided body. Middle Perforated Plate.—A triangular lamina of medullary substance, bounded laterally by the crura cerebri, to which it is attached; before, by the corpora albicantia; and posteriorly, by the pons varolii. Its su- perior surface corresponds to the third ventricle; whilst the inferior gives origin to the third pair of nerves, and is marked by several openings through which small ar- terial twigs enter the cavity of the third ventricle. Pons Varolii—So called from the fact of its being stretched like a bridge of communication between the •cerebrum, cerebellum, and the medulla oblongata. Cu- boid in figure, it presents six sides: a superior and infe- rior, two lateral, with an anterior and a posterior sur- face, superiorly corresponding to the tubercula quadri- gemina, with the iter a tertio ad quartum ventriculum ■ mferiorly, to the basilar process of the occipital bone' dura mater, sixth pair of nerves, with the basilar ar- tery, running in a mesian groove, and superior cerebel- lar arteries; laterally, to the crura cerebelli, with theNKRVOUS SYSTEM. 640 fifth and seventli pair of nerves; before, to the crura cerebri, middle perforated plate, and the origin of the third pair of nerves. The superficial surface consists of the transverse fibres derived from the crura cerebelli; whilst a deeper section displays the diverging fibres of the olivary and pyramidal bodies, passing through the central light grey substance of the pons (corpus rhom- boideum) in their course to the cerebral hemispheres; in the middle line a few of the transverse fibres dip in- wards so as to form a septum, dividing the pons into two symmetrical portions,—an appearance well exhi- bited in a transverse section of this part. Crura Cerebri lie immediately in front of the pons varolii, thick, round, and directed outwards and for- wards ; they connect the pons with the cerebral hemi- spheres, being small posteriorly, and much larger and flatter anteriorly ; internally they correspond to the middle perforated plate, with the origin of the third nerve; externally, to the inner edge of the middle lobe, choroid plexus, choroid artery, and the tractus opticus; inferiorly, to the posterior cerebral artery, posterior communicating, and the optic nerve; and superiorly to the optic thalami and third ventricle. On cutting into its centre a mass of grey matter appears (locus niger), which separates the fibres of the pyramidal from those of the olivary bodies, and where the crura emerge from the pons some annular fibres surround them, while at their cerebral extremity they run directly into the optic thalami and corpora striata. The Cerebellum stands in a ratio to the brain as one to seven, lying in the inferior occipital fossae, and be- neath the tentorium. It is somewhat heart-shaped, and divided into three lobes, two lateral, and the third in the centre, the superior surface being obliquely sloped from the middle line downwards and outwards, while the inferior, convex, corresponds to the occipital fossse. An horizontal sulcus surrounds the margin, separating tlie superior from the inferior surface, terminating m front in a wide excavation (incisura anterior), which re- ceives the medulla oblongata, and behind, in the fissure, which is occupied by a falx cerebelli (incisura posterior). On the upper surface the cerebellum presents a median641 CEREBRUM. elevation, more prominent before than behind: this is the superior vermiform process, being the iipper part of the middle lobe, overlapping in front the valve of Vieussens and divided by transverse sulci into three lobules, the anterior of which projects into the incisura anterior, and is named the central lobule; behind this the second,' or monticulus, is situated, and again, more posteriorly, a smaller lobule exists, called the commissura simplex. Inferiorly in the mesian line we observe a sulcus, across which the arachnoid membrane is stretched, and on re- moving this, the inferior vermiform process is exposed, transversely rugated like a silkworm, and is divided into four portions:—most anteriorly, the nodulus, a pointed lobule, projecting into the fourth ventricle; im- mediately behind this, a grey elongated mass, named the uvula; still more posteriorly, a small blunted elevation representing the pyramid; and lastly, at the most pos- terior part of the inferior sulcus, or valley of Haller, the commissura brevis exists. On each side of the uvula two semilunar, flat, greyish white plates pass from the side of that part to the lateral lobes of the cerebellum where they are overlapped by the tonsillitic lobules, each anterior margin being lunated and free, the semilunar tossette between it and the nodule being called the ni- dus hirundinis, or swallow's nest: this structure consti- tutes the inferior medullary velum, whilst the superior IS formed by the valve of Vieussens. The surface of the cerebellum is divided into lamina;, which are separated by sulci, having their concavities all directed forwards and inwards, and by their aggregation constituting lobules, those on the upper surface being two, namely, the ante- : nor superior, and the posterior inferior, the latter beins the larger of the two. On the lower aspect five lobules are present, namely,_the semilunar, which is near the 1 posterior and lateral margin, being therefore circumfer- ential; secondly, the slender or gracilis; thirdly the di- .gastric, which is bifid externally; fourthly, the amyg- daloid or tonsilhtic, projecting internally into the valley ot Haller, and producing that peculiar arrangement of parts similar to those at the posterior portion of the mouth, there being in the vallecula—tonsils situated la- terally, uvula in the centre, and the inferior medullary642 NERVOUS SYSTEM. velum uniting them. The fifth lobule is the pneumo- gastric or subpeduncular flocculus, connected to the crura cerebelli by two stalk-like processes, and lying behind the eighth, and below the seventh nerve. In con- nexion with the cerebellum, the isthmus encephali, or nodus cerebri, ought to be examined: it is a narrow medullary mass which, occupying the space between the cerebrum, cerebellum, and the medulla oblongata, should be regarded as a compound body, being made up of the following parts:— Pons Varolii.—inferiorly, tubercula quadrigemina above, crura cerebri in front, with the medulla oblon- gata and the superior crura cerebelli above. Cerebellar Peduncles.—These are three on each side, superior, middle, and inferior; the superior thick, round, white cords (processus a cerebello ad testes), which pass downwards and backwards, diverging from the testes to the central white portion of the cerebellum; internally they correspond to the fourth ventricle and the valve of Vieussens; externally and inferiorly, to the middle crura; and superiorly they are overlapped by the cerebellum, and afford origin to the fourth nerve. Mid- dle crura cerebelli pass from the cerebellum to the side of the pons, which they enter, forming its transverse fibres, and are related behind to the seventh, and in front to the fifth pair of nerves, and inferiorly to the subpe- duncular flocculus or pneumogastric lobule. Inferior crura are constituted by the restiform bodies, which diverge to reach the inferior part of the incisura an- Internal Structure of the Cerebellum.—A longitu- dinal section on either side of the middle line displays the arbor vitse of the lateral lobes, and a similar section in the mesian line, that of the middle lobe, the former consisting of a central white nucleus, which gives off from its circumference from fifteen to twenty branches, and these, again subdividing, are covered at their extre- mities by a yellow layer, on which, lastly, is moulded the grey substance, which is about a line m thickness. In the centre of each white nucleus a mass of grey mat- ter (corpus rhomboideum) occurs, of an ovoid figure, possessing also a yellowish investing surface layer; this643 MEDULLA OBLONGATA. Gall and Spurzheim conceived to be the ganglion of the cerebellum. The arbor vitss of the middle lobe consists of a triangular white nucleus, which is continued up- wards into the superior, and downwards into the in- ferior vermiform process, dividing and subdividing into branches and smaller branches as they pass to the sur- face, where they are surrounded by a yellow layer and grey substance, similar to the arrangement of the same parts in the lateral lobes. Medulla Oblongata, or Rachidian Bulb, consists of a conoid enlargement, extending from the pons va- rolii above to the upper margin of the anterior half arch of the atlas below, where it is a little constricted, measuring in length from fifteen to sixteen lines, nine in breadth, and six in thickness, being much greater in diameter than the spinal cord; its direction is oblique, and therefore forms an obtuse angle with the spinal cord, salient posteriorly; inferiorly it rests on the ba- silar process of the occipital bone, and also corresponds to the vertebral arteries; superiorly and posteriorly it is related to the fourth ventricle and valley of Haller. It consists of four bodies, which are symmetrical,—namely, the anterior pyramids in front, the olivary bodies late- rally, the restiform posteriorly and laterally, and the posterior pyramids behind. Anterior Pyramids occupy the anterior part of the medulla, triangular in shape, and about an inch in length, each commencing, narrow and pointed, below by threesetsof fibres,—namely, decussating, non-decussat- mg, and arciform: the first consists of from three to five fasciculi, which sink into the anterior sulcus to become continuous with the antero-lateral columns of the cord on the opposite side; external to these the second set are prolonged to the anterior column of its own side whilst the arciform fibres, being still more external, pass backwards below the olivary body, which they sometimes cover, and are continuous with the posterior columns Above the point of decussation the median fissure se- parates these bodies, and when they are gently drawn asunder the inner edge appears dentated in consequence of the impressions of the vessels lying in the pia mater ■which sinks into the fissure. Just as they are about toKERVOUS SYSTEM. 644 enter the pons they become round, on which account a small depression results between them, bounded in front by the pons (foramen cascum), and then, entering the latter body above the transverse fibres on its superficial surface, but crossing others which are deeper, they reach the crura cerebri, passing through their anterior and external part to arrive at the thalami and striated bodies in their course to the hemispheres. They are bounded above and behind by a groove separating them from the olivary bodies, from which arises the ninth nerve, whilst from the superior part immediately behind the pons the sixth pair of nerves take their origin. Olivary Bodies—Small, oval projections on the side of the medulla, bounded behind by a depression (respiratory tract of Bell) separating them from the res- tiform bodies, from which arise the eighth pair of nerves; in front, by the groove for the origin of the ninth pair; above, by a depression in which the portio dura arises; and below, by the arciform fibres. On tracing them downwards, their fibres are seen to become continuous with the antero-lateral column of the cord; and supe- riorly, although apparently separated from the pons by a depression, still they enter that body, and, on passing through it, form the greater portion of the upper surface of the crura cerebri, entering subsequently the optic thalami and tubercula quadrigemina. If the anterior pyramids are removed, and the olivary body is subjected to the action of a stream of water, a yellowish, folded mass will be seen, which, from its resemblance to a folded leaf, is called corpus dendroideum, which can be traced inwards into the substance of the medulla as the fillet of Reil. The olivary body is, therefore, hollow internally, being compared by Rolando to an open purse, and hence he named it " borsa appiattita." Gall and Spurzheim conceived that these bodies, Avhich are peculiar to the human subject, were the ganglia of increase connected with the medulla oblongata. Eestiform Bodies.—Round and cylindrical, like a rope, from which circumstance their name is derived, and placed on the posterior and lateral part of the me- dulla; they are continued inferiorly from the posterior, and the postero-lateral columns of the cord; and then,MEDULLA OBLONGATA. 645 curving backwards and outwards, as the inferior crura cerebelh, they enter the cerebellum, forming its diverg- ing fibres. The restiform bodies are bounded anteriorly by the respiratory tract, and as they diverge in their as- cent towards the nodus cerebri, the posterior pyramids with the calamus scriptorius, and the median fissure (posterior), become evident between them Posterior Pyramids.—Two small bands' of Avhite me- duUary substance on the posterior surface of the medulla separated from the restiform bodies by a superficial, and from each other by the posterior median sulcus: they are about one-eighth of an inch in width, and are formed by the posterior and a part of the lateral columns of the cord; the latter decussating like the fibres of the ante- rior pyramids. These bodies are then continued upwards passing through the pons, crura cerebri, and optic tha- lami, and from thence to the convolutions of the brain Calamus ScRiPTORius._The posterior surface of the medulla, which is concealed by the cerebellum, appears to open out or become everted, so that the central o-rey matter IS exposed; and as the posterior columns sepa- rate in their ascent, a triangular interval occurs between them, with Its apex inferiorly, which, from its resem- blance to a writing-pen, has been named the calamus : scnptorius. The shaft of the pen is formed by the me- nnw ''i 'r' '''^ f^'*" ^^''^ medullary lines passing upwards, forwards, and outwards, varying in numbef ^ and size, some terminating, after a short cLrse on the . mferior wall of the fourth ventricle, whilst the greater ! number are continuous with the origin of the^portio .mollis nerve.

Formation of the Brain—It is tisual to describe the brain as consisting of four sets of fibres, namely, diverg- ing, converging, commissural, and fibres of conjunction. Assuming the medulla oblongata as their primordial centre, we will now proceed to trace generally those fibres: first, in the cerebrum proper, and subsequently in the cerebellum; but should the student be desirous of following them in their course, it will be requisite to obtain a brain hardened in alcohol, or boiled in oil, and having removed the aiachnoid and pia mater, he may then proceed to unravel the cerebral fibres with a wooden scalpel, and one or two portions of hard wood, of which one should be made extremely fine, and the other forked at the extremity ; he should also have the requisite means for allowing a stream of water to play on the pre- paration. It is a very troublesome operation, and re- quires great patience and address for its accomplishment. The DiVERGTNa Fibees of the Cerebrum are continua- tions from the anterior and posterior pyramids, also the olivary bodies; they may be traced, generally, as enter- ing the pons varolii, and passing through the corpus rhomboideum (or the ganglion of the pons), they seem augmented in size and number; then, entering the crura cerebri, and coming in contact with the locus niger, which separates the olivary from the pyramidal fibres, they again appear increased, and enter the optic thala- mus and striated bodies, interweaving with their grey neurine; they then continue outwards to reach the grey substance which covers the hemispheres, or that yellow- ish line internal to the grey border, named the linea flava of Soemerring; here they are looped, turning on themselves to reach the middle line, and terminating m the commissures, which are,—the corpus callosum, fornix, anterior, middle, and posterior commissures, middle per- forated plate, &c. Thus the diverging fibres have their origins in the medulla oblongata, whilst their subse- quent reflections on themselves constitute the con- ""^dIverging Fibres of the Cerebellum.—The resti- form bodies, passing backwards and outwards, enter the647 DEVELOPMENT OF BRAIN. inferior part of the incisura anterior, diverge in their progress through the corpora rhomboidea, and terminate at the surface grey layer, and from this point the con- verging fibres turn inwards to form the middle crura cerebelli, the transverse fibres of the pons being their commissure. The superior peduncles connect the mid- dle lobe of the cerebellum to the tubercula quadrige- mina, the valve ofVieussens constituting the commissure between them (Gall), but with equal reason the vermi- form processes may be assumed to be the commissures of the inferior peduncles or restiform bodies, as they are not only continuous with their fibres, but likewise unit- ing the lateral and middle lobes by their transverse bands. The following tabular view from Dr. Carpen- ter's work will facilitate the student in understanding the preceding description:— SPINAL CORD.

The cerebellum appears immediately after the ; medulla, being at first a single vesicular mass, formed 1 by the coalition of the restiform bodies, and at the 1 twelfth week forming a circular band, about one-third of an inch in width, surrounding the upper part of the 1 medulla and the tubercula quadrigemina; but as yet 1 being deficient of laminae or fissures. At the sixth648 NERVOUS SYSTEM. month the posterior notch, with the surface fissures, be- come evident, and during the further period of foetal life the lateral lobes increase, so as ultimately to con- ceal the middle. The cerebrum at the end of the eighth week presents the corpora striata, covered by a thin fold of membrane, representing the cerebral hemispheres, but this vesicular enlargement still leaves the optic tha- lami, tubercula quadrigemina, and cerebellum exposed, the corpus callosum not as yet being formed, the whole mass resembling the brain of fishes. At the end of the twelfth week the nascent hemisphere covers also the op- tic thalami, and now the corpus callosum also begins to appear as a narrow band. In the fifth month the hemi- sphere covers the tubercula quadrigemina, and traces of anfractuosities, with the fissures of Sylvius, are observed. In the sixth month they conceal the anterior part of the cerebellum; in the sixth and seventh months the cere- bellum becomes entirely concealed, the posterior cere- bral lobes projecting behind them; during the remain- der of festal life the convolutions become more perfect, and the corpus callosum reaches the tubercula quadri- gemina. The weight of the brain varies with age and sex: in the male its average weight may be stated as about three pounds, whilst in the female it is about two pounds ten ounces, this average being only approximate. DISSECTION OF THE SPINAL CORD. In order to examine this important part the subject must be placed on a table, with blocks beneath the chest and abdomen, so as to render the muscles of the back tense; an incision should then be carried perpendicu- larly downwards on either side, three inches external to the spines, from the occiput to the base of the coccyx: the great erectors of the spine must now be removed, and the posterior half-arches of the vertibrce exposed; these should next be divided either with the saw or, what is still better, with a mallet and chisel, close to the pedicles, and each of them cautiously lifted up; by this means the interior of the canal will be exposed, but the dura mater or first covering of the spmal cord is not asMEMBRANES OF CORD. 649 yet fully displayed, as it is invested by a layer of wa- tery adipose tissue wliich surrounds it, forming the bed or stroma for numerous plexuses of veins (Rachidian) which ramify on it in every direction. When these have been carefully examined, the cord may be next re- moved from the canal, and this can always be affected with greater facility by commencing below, and cuttino- the nerves of the cauda equina as they issue from the sacral foramina; these can now be lifted upwards, and as the dissection is continued towards the cranium, the nerves may be divided in succession, and the fibrous bands which connect the membrane to the posterior va- ginal ligament likewise cut across; ultimately the knife may be swept through the entire structure immediately below the foramen magnum, when it becomes thus de- tached for examination. The membranes of the cord are three in number,—an external or fibrous, derived from the dura mater, a middle or serous, and an inter- nal or areolo-vascular, the two last being continuous with the arachnoid and pia mater of the cranial cavity Ihe dura mater may be considered as a tubular pro- longation from that of the cranium, expanded at both extremities and contracted in the centre, attachedfirmlv above around the margin of the foramen magnum and terminating below at the inferior part of the lumbar re- gion, where it forms a well-marked dilatation, from which separate processes are given off to constitute sheaths for the nerves of the cauda equina; its exter- nal surface is smoother than that which lines the cavity of the skull, neither does it form a perfect periosteurn for Its bony case, as it only adheres to it at a few and detached points, but its internal is remarkable for its glistening, polished appearance, a character which it derives from the visceral layer of the arachnoid; it is perforated along its sides by a double row of foramina for the passage of the anterior and posterior spinal nerves, and a tubular prolongation from its structure as reflected upon them for some distance after they emerge. The differences between it and the dura mater of the bram are therefore the following :-First]y, it does not form a perfect periosteum, being separated from the walls of the canal by loose areolar tissue of a watery650 NERVOUS SYSTEM. character, with the Rachidian veins and posterior vagi- nal ligament; secondly, it does not form sinuses, nei- ther does it send prolongations or processes into the structure which it invests; thirdly, it is much thinner, and presents the fibrous character in a less marked de- gree; and fourthly, it is less vascular and adheres less intimately to the subjacent arachnoid. It must not, however, be supposed that it closely invests the cord, as it is in reality much too large for it, and the inter- val which exists between them is left for the purpose of affording room for the subarachnoid fluid, which is found in the canal in some quantity. In structure the dura mater is essentially fibrous, and its vascular supply is derived from several sources: viz, deep cervical, intercostal, lumbar and sacral, Avhile its veins terminate in those of the Rachidian system. With respect to its nerves, it has not as yet been clearly demonstrated whether they exist at all. Arachnoid is the serous envelope of the cord, conti- nuous with that of the cranium, and is remarkable for its delicacy and tenuity: it consists of two layers,—an external or parietal, and an internal or visceral; the for- mer lines the entire of the outer fibrous membrane just described, sending off around each of the nerves, as they escape through its foramina, processes which are again reflected back on the sheaths in cul de sacs; the visce- ral layer does not embrace the cord tensely, but an in- terval exists between them of variable capacity in dif- ferent individuals and at diflPerent periods of life, and this can be clearly demonstrated either by inflation or injection of any liquid material; this has been called the subarachnoid space, first pointed out by Haller, after- wards by Cotugno, and lastly by Magendie, whose di- rect experiments conclusively establish the fact oi its existence. It consists of a thin transparent fluid, wliicn, surrounding the cord in all directions, defends it Irom those shocks and concussions to which it would have been otherwise so liable, while it likewise communicates with similar spaces in the cranium, and, according to some authors, with the ventricles of the brain. Long fibrous filaments, described by Rainey as nervous, con- nect this loose sac of the arachnoid with the subjacent651 MEMBRANES OF CORD. pia mater, and in the mesian line on the posterior aspect of the cord a species of septum, sometimes imperfect or cribriform, appears to unite one to the other (Sharpey). The continuity of the visceral with the parietal layer is* preserved by the reflection of the membrane in a series of tiibules on the nerves. Pia Mater.—This, which forms the immediate in- vestment of the cord, is continuous with the same struc- ture of the brain, but it differs from it in several im- portant particulars, being fibrous in its character, and having little vascularity; it likewise invests the cord most tensely, as may be shoAvn by puncturing it, when there will be a hernia of the neuriue through the aper- ture; it sends a dense process into the anterior median furrow (membrana resplendens of Haller), and a smaller and less obvious one into the posterior. As it descends, it throws off a neurilemma around each of the nerves as they pass through it, and inferiorly it terminates in a thm filament (filum terminale), which is prolonged downwards in the centre of the cauda equina, surrounded by a tubule of dura mater, becoming attached to the lower part of the canal of the coccyx; this was for- merly considered by the older anatomists as a prolonga- tion of the cord itself, to which they applied the name nervus impar. On tracing this fibrous envelope up- wards from the medulla oblongata, a gradual change in Its character will be observed to take place, as it imper- ceptibly becomes more areolar, and its vessels more numerous, as it spreads out to invest the tissue of the brain. LiGAMENTUM Denticulatum.—This is a flattened band ol fibrous tissue, extending from the foramen mag- num to the first lumbar vertebra; it presents an internal plane margin, which is thin, and attached to the pia mater of the lateral part of the cord, between the ante- rior and posterior roots of the nerves, and an external thicker and deeply serrated, having twenty-one or twenty-two teeth,_the first, the longest, being at- tached to the dura mater, on a level with the foramen magnum, separating the vertebral artery from the lin- gual and spinal accessory nerves; the others are in a similar manner connected by their points to the same 2 F 2652 NERVOUS STSTEM. Structure, between the foramina of emergence of any two nerves, which they thus serve to separate, while at the same time they tend to keep the cord itself accu- t rately fixed in its position. Various opinions have been advanced as to the nature of this ligament, some assert- ing that it is a separate structure; others, that it is a process of the dura mater; others, of the arachnoid; and others again, of the piamater: the last, however, appears to be the correct view of it. Having completed the examination of the investing tissues, the cord itself must next be exposed; and this may be done by cautiously removing the pia mater, a difficult operation, as it adheres to it very closely, par- ticularly in the regions of the origins of the nerves. The spinal marrow in the human subject averages a length of from fifteen to eighteen inches, commencing opposite the ring of the first cervical vertebra, and ter- minating at the inferior margin of the second lumbar: neither of these points are, however, invariably the same, as, besides individual discrepancies, flexion and extension of the head may influence the position of the one and similar movements of the vertebral column may alter that of the other. In intra-uterine life it reaches downwards as far as the coccyx, but m the mfant at birth only as far as the fourth lumbar vertebra. In shape it is cylindrical, but flattened both on its anterior and posterior aspects, presenting two well-marked dic- tations (we exclude at present that of the medulla oblon-^ata),—the superior or cervico-brachial bulb, oval in fit^ure, extending from the third cervical to the third dorsal vertebra; and an inferior or dorso-lumbar pyn- form, with the base superiorly at the eleventh dorsal, and the apex inferiorly at the second lumbar where it terminates in the filum terminale. These enlargements are obviously attributable to those large nervous masser which are thrown off at those points, viz.: the bracliia above, and the lumbar and sacral below; but m thedorsa ret^ion a similar increase in size and structure is not re- quired, as, although respiration is a most "«Portan. function, still the muscles which are subservient o il do not d;pend for their supply on the nerves only whid. arise in the immediate vicinity of the thoracic cavitySPINAL CORD. g53 but they borrow others from sources more remote, in order to obviate any dangerous results that might ensue from the accidental lesion of any particular part of the nervous centre in a function so essential to exist- ence. In the examination of the anterior and posterior sur- faces of the cord, grooves or furrows are observed on both aspects, but they differ from each other in the fol- lowing particulars:—The anterior being broad but shallow, dippmg into its structure for about one-third of Its entire depth, and limited in its deeper part by a thm band of white neurine, stretching completely across It; the posterior, on the contrary, is much narrower scarcely visible at first, and requires the opposite sides ot the cord to be gently drawn apart before it become'^ apparent; it extends into the substance of the cord for nearly two-thirds, and its floor is formed by a delicate grey lamina extending across it. From this view it will be perceived that the spinal marrow consists truly of two cylinders, united by a thin commissure, white anteriorly and grey posteriorly, each cylinder bein^ composed essentially of an external envelope of white neurine, within whichis deposited agrey mass, semilunar in fagure, with their convex margins directed towards eacli other, the commissure of the same colour and con- sistence connecting them. This may be distinctly ob- served on making a transverse section of the cord lu ■■ addition to the median furrows just described, two ; ^'''^^^ ^^tero and postero lateral, but not equally well marked,_the latter I being the more deeply indented, while the former is the ■more curved, as it commences on the side above and terminates on the front below; these grooves are sepa- . rated from each other by the attachment of the ligamen- .tum denticulatum; and in a transverse section of the • cord It will be seen that the sharp posterior horn of the ■ grey semilunar mass reaches out as far as its correspond- ing furrow, while the anterior, which is rounded and t)lunt, terminates about two lines before it arrives at the anterior. These fissures give origin to the roots of the anterior and posterior spinal nerves, which we will unow proceed to examine.654 NERVOUS SYSTEM. The Spinal Nerves consist of thirty-one pair ou each side, viz.: eight cervical, twelve dorsal, five lum- bar, and six sacrkl. These arise from the secondary grooves or furrows already described on either side ot the ligamentum denticulatum, with which the posterior roots are almost parallel; but the anterior diverge from it in a very marked manner towards the inferior extre- mity of the cord. ■ The characters of the two roots are very different,—the anterior being white, bard and small, and the posterior grey, soft, and large. Much diversity of opinion prevails as to the manner m which the nerves originate from the spinal marrow, but the more general idea appears to be, that they arise by two sets of filaments, one of which becomes fused or blended with the grey or vesicular mass in the centre ot the cord, while the other passes upwards and inwards through its structure,—and are supposed totermmate in the brain itself. It may, however, be necessary to ob- serve, that although a doubt may exist as to the con- nexion of the anterior root with the grey matter, there can be none whatever as to the posterior, which can be clearly traced into it; and indeed the very fact of the posterior horn of the vesicular matter extending out as far as its fissure of origin is an additional confirmation of this view: but the same remark will not apply to it. anterior cornu, which, as has been already observed terminates a line or two from the anterior furrow. On leaving the spinal cord, each nerve receives an ^vesting tubul? from'the pia mater and an inflection from the arachnoid, they then perforate the dura mater by dis- tinct foramina, obtaining likewise an investiture fiom this structure, and, emerging into the vertebial fora- mina, the posterior root dilates into a soft grey, oval ganglion, t'o the anterior face of which the W ro°t s Applied, or, more strictly speaking, is imbedded m it ^ef there appears to be no direct communication ot Seir fibres;''but after the formaticn. o the ga^hon the posterior nerve is again collected into a P^^^^^ cord which unites inextricably with the anterior, ana mmediately after this common Vision, l two trunks again ensues, and ot these the anterior is now decMl/the larger. Their ultimate destinationCEREBRAL NERVES. 655 will subsequently be traced in the description of the plexuses, but it may perhaps be necessary to observe here that the origin of the posterior nerves is much nearer the corresponding median furrow than the ante- rior, the former being also more intimately connected with the structure in front of its own proper fissure. In the earlier periods of intra-uterine life the spinal marrow consists of merely a thin, transparent, pulpy mass, extending the entire length of the spinal canal, and being relatively much larger than the brain; it af- terwards assumes a laminated appearance, which, bend- ing backwards on itself, forms a complete canal, which is continuous with the cavity of the fourth ventricle; but the dense pia mater pressing upon it about its cen- tre, from before backwards, causes the approximation of Its anterior and posterior walls, by which it is con- verted into two distinct tubules. This condition con- tmues to about the sixth month, when the canals be- come obliterated by new deposits, which are gradually added to their inclosing tissues; but still the parts have not as yet assumed a perfectly consolidated character, as the slightest inflation will again produce the re-appear- ance of those cavities. At this period of life the white raatter which invests the cord is extremely thin, and the posterior columns are remarkable for their greater degree of development, and firmer as contrasted with the anterior. It should be also recollected that in foetal life the cord extended the entire length of the canal- but in consequence of the rapid elongation of the cer- vical region it is carried upwards, the filum terminale remaining as the vestige of its sacral portion. The Cerebral Nerves consist of nine pairs, and are divided into motor, sensitive, compound, and nerves of special sense. Taking them in order from before back- wards, it will be found that the first pair are the olfac- tory; the second, optic; the third, motores oculorum; the fourth or trochleatores; the fifth or trifacial, or trige- mmi; the sixth or abducentes; the seventh, consisting o auditory and facial; the eighth, of the pneumo-astric glosso-pharyngeal, and the spinal accessory; and the ninth lingual or the hypo-glossal. Of these, the third tourth, one portion of the fifth, sixth, portio dura ofNERVOUS SYSTEM. 656 the seventh, spinal accessory, and lingual, are motor; whilst the soft root of the fifth pair, pneumogastric and glosso-pharyngeal, are sensitive; and the fifth, taking the anterior and posterior roots conjointly, affords a good example of a compound nerve; further, the nerves of special sense include the olfactory, optic, auditory, and the gustatory branch of the fifth. We will not make any further allusion to this subject at present, as the function of each nerve will be connected with its indi- vidual description. Olfactory or First Pair.—Each olfactory nerve arises by three roots,—an external, middle, and inter- nal; the external, long, slender, and white, takes its origin from that convolution most posteriorly situated in the Sylvian fissure, where it is continued into the corpus striatum, communicating with the fibres of the anterior commissure; the middle, which is grey, arises from the most posterior convolution of the anterior lobe of the brain (caruncula mammillaris); while the inter- nal, white and small, takes its origin from the innermost lobule of the anterior lobe, continued inwards to the rostrum of the corpus callosum, sometimes this latter being double, and of a silvery colour. The three roots converging, unite to form a prismatic trunk, whicb, passing forwards and inwards, is imbedded in a sulcus on the anterior lobe, lying above the arachnoid and be- loAV the pia mater, the grey filament forming the apex of the prism; and on the cribriform plate of the eth- moid bone it expands, forming an oval bulb ot a light arey colour (olivary ganglion), soft, and devoid ot neu- rilemma, and separated from its fellow by the crista galli, whilst inferiorly it is supported by the dura ma- ter body of the sphenoid, and cribriform plate of the ethmoid bone, occasionally extending so lar forwards that it conceals the nasal branch of the ophthalmic nerve. From its inferior surface three sets of branches pass ott, namely, external, middle, and internal; these descend through similarly arranged foramina in the cribriform plate of the ethmoid bone, each branch bemg surrounded by a process of the dura mater, which descends into the nLal^avity to become continuous with the fibrous layer of the Schneiderian membrane. Ihe arachnoidCEREBRAL NERVES. 657 also follows each branch for some distance into these canals, but again abandoning it, forms a cul de sac as- cendmg to re-enter the cranium, while the pia mater also accompanies the nervous filaments; but after a short course in these canals the dura mater becomes in- timately adherent to them, conferring on them great resistance, and rendering it difficult to break down the bone without likewise destroying the nerves. Of the branches, the external are distributed to the pituitarv membrane, on the middle and superior spongy bones the internal to the septum, and the middle to the roof (see page 130). The olfactory nerves are peculiar in the lower ver- tebrata from the olfactory bulb, being the seat of a cavity which communicates with the lateral ventricle an organization absent in man. These nerves are like- wise peculiar, m arising by three roots of different slides 01 colour, m converging within the cranium, in their prismatic form, in lying in a deep sulcus or furrow, in being above the arachnoid, and devoid of neurilemma in leaving the cranium by a number of foramina, and in not possessing the power to excite reflex action The olfactory nerves are sometimes, but rarely, absent, and wanting ^ ^^^^^^"^=7 exists the olfactive sense is also Optic Nerves, or Second Pair.-Iu order to see the origins of these nerves the cerebellum should be raised from the semilunar notch of Bichat, then follow them orwards, as they wind around the crus cerebri, remo^ Flh Z ''"'^^^^^"'^/^d pia mater from this situation. Each nerve arises by two roots, one from the nates, the other from the testes; these pass forwards, being next attached to the corpora geniculata externa'and interna then forming a flattened band, it winds downwards for- wards, and inwards, winding round the crus cerebri from which it likewise takes an origin, constituting the tractus opticus; next, converging towards its fellow they both unite m the optic chiasma, or commissure' wnich may be said to derive a sixth attachment from i the tuber cinereum. The chiasma, in figure resembling ^ iVlaltese cross, being related posteriorly to the tuber 2v 3/ 658 NERVOUS SYSTEM. cinereum, above and before to the grey floor of the third ventricle, which attaches it to the brain, below to the olivary process of the sphenoid bone, and, externally, to the carotid artery and external perforated plate. It con- sists of three sets of fibres, non-decussating, decussating, and commissural:—the first, being the external, pass ou to the eye on their own side; the second, or middle set, crossing the centre of the chiasma, supply the inner part of the retina of the opposite side; whilst the third, or most internal, behind the chiasma, run forwards, and are then reflected backwards, being the commissural fibres of origin; and in front of the chiasma, running from the retina of one side backwards, again turn forwards to the opposite eye, constituting the commissural fibres of ter- mination. With reference to a decussation from above downwards, though it may exist, we confess, even after the most careful preparation, that such an arrangement has eluded our observation. In front of the commissure the optic nerves pass outwards and forwards, lying be- low the anterior cerebral arteries, and above the lesser winces of the sphenoid bone, which they groove, and, entering the optic foramen, become surrounded by a dense sheath of dura mater, and continuing their course downwards, forwards, and outwards, present a slight constriction, and then, perforating the sclerotic coat by a cribriform, and the choroid coat by a well-defined aperture, they expand to form the retina. On passing from the chiasma to the optic foramen the nerve lies superior and internal to the deep carotid artery, and here the ophthalmic lies to its outer side, but afterwards winds round it to its internal. In the orbit surrounded by the recti muscles and ciliary nerves, it has those ad- ^'^Relati^ns.^Ahove, the superior division of the third and nasal nerves; externally, the lenticular ganglion, its roots, and the ophthalmic artery and vem; internally, Sie naso-ciliary benches; and inferiorly the inferior ob- lique division of the third. The optic nerves consist of vei y delicate filaments, similar to those of the bram and cord possessing the same disposition to become varicose 'vi e; ^subjected to pressure, as exhibited by the olfac-CEREBRAL NERVES. 659 tory and seventh pair. We may here remark that a perfect decussation of the nervous filaments occurs in the chiasma of fishes. Third Pair, or Motores Oculorum White and round, arise from the inner edge of the crus cerebri where it emerges from the pons, but this origin is merely apparent, as the filaments may be traced into the locus niger. It then passes a little backwards and downwards, lying between the anterior cerebellar and posterior ce- rebral arteries, winding round three-fourths of the lat- ter, then passing upwards, forwards, and outwards, in- ternal to the posterior communicating artery, through the fine areolar tissue of the middle subarachnoid space, it lies between the attachment of the convex and con- cave margins of the tentorium, and enters the outer wall of the cavernous sinus, lying above the fourth in the two posterior thirds of that space, but anteriorly that nerve winds round its outer margin to become superior to It. The third nerve now becomes flattened and di- vides into a superior and inferior division, both of which enter the orbit by the sphenoidal fissure, between the two heads of the external rectus; the superior division, the smaller, as it enters the fissure has above it the frontal nerve, and one head of the external rectus, and immediately beneath it the nasal, from which it receives a communicating branch; passing forwards and inwards^ over the nasal and optic nerves, it divides into two branches,—the superior, or the larger, winds round the inner margin of the superior rectus, near its back part and lying on the superior surface of that muscle for a short distance, where it is flattened, sinks into the deep aspect of the levator palpebraj superioris, in which the filaments of the nerve may be traced to the palpebral attachment; while the second, or inferior of the two enters and supplies the ocular surface of the superior rectus muscle. The inferior division of the third nerve entering the foramen lacerum orbitale, between the two heads of the external rectus, lies below the superior aivision and the nasal, and above the sixth nerve, then passing forwards, and lying inferior and external to the optic nerve, it divides into three branches,_external middle, and internal: the first, which is the largest' >NERVOUS SYSTEM. 660 gives off immediately after its origin the sliort root to the lenticular ganglion, and then running beneath the optic nerve, and on the ocular surface of the inferior rectus, winds round the outer margin of that muscle, and, sinking beneath it, supplies the ocular aspect of the inferior oblique; the second, or middle branch, lies at first on the inferior rectus, near its back part, into which it sinks also on the ocular aspect; whilst the third or internal, larger than the last, and flattened transversely, passes inwards beneath the optic nerve, and above the inferior rectus, and supplies the deep surface of the internal rectus. It will be seen that the third nerve supplies five out of the seven muscles in the orbit, all on that aspect which is turned towards the eye, and from the peculiar relation which the nerve bears immediately after its origin to the cerebral and cerebellar arteries, affections of its motor function are frequently associated with cerebral vascular derange- ment, producing a drooping of the upper eyelid, or pto- sis ; but in addition to the levator palpebrae, all the other muscles supplied by the nerve participate in the loss of power, the eye being, therefore, drawn downwards and outwards by the external rectus and superior oblique, which possess an independent nervous supply. Fourth or Trochleator Nerves, sometimes called pathetici, are extremely small and fine, like a thread; they arise usually by two filaments, from the valve of Vieussens and the processus a cerebello ad testes, but nearer to th6 latter bodies, a transverse white band oc- casionally acting as a commissure between them, and here they are covered by the velum iuterpositum, and lie on the valve of Vieussens; then, passing forwards and outwards, winding round the meso-cephale, they appear between the cerebrum and cerebellum, enter a canal be- tween the lamintB of the tentorium, and, being received between the layers of the outer wall of the cavernous sinus, they lie at first above the ophthalmic and below the third, but after some distance they mount above the latter; then entering the sphenoidal fissure at its base, between the periosteum above, and the frontal nerve inferiorly and externally, and crossing the superior rec- tus and levator palpebra% they become flattened, and areCEREBRAL NERVES. 661 distributed to the orbital surface of the superior oblique muscles, near their posterior extremities, and hence the name trochleatores. Recurrent Branch.—Whilst within the cavernous sinus, each gives off a recurrent branch, which runs back- wards and outwards between the layers of the tentorium in which It terminates; sometimes this branch also receives a hlament from the ophthalmic. The fourth was considered by Sir C. Bell as the respiratory nerve of the orbit, beino' the highest nerve of that superadded system, arisino- in the respiratory tract. In the cavernous sinus it is inti- mately connected with the ophthalmic, inducing some anatomists to consider it as an additional root of that nerve, whilst others, drawing their arguments from its distribution, believe a similar relation to subsist between It and the common motor nerve of the orbit. It is how- ever a curious fact, that the lachrymal branch of the ophthalmic almost constantly receives from it a branch ot communication, and in a case where the former was evmently absent it was replaced by a filament from the latter ; would it not, therefore, be fair to infer that the trochleator should be considered as a compound nerve? Fifth Nerve, Trifacial or Trigemini, consists of two roots, one being white, round, small, and hard, the second, soft, grey, large, and ganglionic; these two roots are seen in front of the crus cerebelli, this point constituting their apparent origin, but yet they can be traced through the pons as separate portions down- wards to the olivary tracts of the medulla, or as Dr Alcock remarks, to the floor of the fourth ventricle' where they arise from a yellowish grey layer above the . auditory nerve, which connects them with the ante- I nor and posterior columns of the cord. The soft root ^ emerges through an elliptical aperture between the 1 transverse fibres of the pons, whilst the hard or smaller escapes through a distinct rounded opening, separated . from the former by a small papillar enlargement, and ■ lying on Its superior and posterior border. The soft .-root consists of from seventy to one hundred filaments mnd if the nerve is forcibly torn from its attachment a .:mammillary tubercle remains, which Bichat conceived constituted its origin; it always seems constricted when662 NERVOUS SYSTEM, passing from the pons, but beyond this point it be- comes enlarged and rounded, whilst the hard root which •was situated on its superior and posterior margin now appears on its internal aspect, where it is retained in a groove by a fold of arachnoid, which is common to both nerves. They now pass forwards and outwards beneath the tentorium, supported by a fold of arachnoid membrane, and, passing through an oval aperture above the superior angle of the petrous portion of the tempo- ral bone, are received into a depression on its superior surface, the soft portion here forming the Casserian ganglion. The oval opening, or neural aperture, is bounded above by the attached margin of the tentorium with the superior petrosal sinus, and below by the angle of the petrous portion of the temporal bone, which is a Httle excavated at this point; the margins are smooth in consequence of the arachnoid membrane which lines them, and it is further continued on the under surface of the nerve and the external two-thirds of the ganglion, but not on their upper aspects; on this account, there- fore, the dura mater adheres superiorly to the nerve and ganglion, being removed Avith difficulty, but when it has been dissected off, both the nerve and ganglion can be raised from the bone with facility. It will now be observed that the soft root expands to form the ganglion, whilst the hard lies beneath it, connected, cer- tainly, to its inferior surface by the arachnoid, but not forming any part of the structure. Casserian or Semilunar Ganglion.—Of a light grey colour, concave posteriorly and internally, and convex anteriorly and externally; receives posteriorly the soft root of the fifth, whilst from its convexity three branches emanate; namely,—ophthalmic, superior and inferior maxillary; the inferior surface, convex, corre- sponds to the depression in the bone, the following superposition of parts being situated l^eueath it :— 1 The hard root; 2. A double layer of arachnoid, that membrane consisting of a parietal and visceral portion; 3 Dura mater; 4. Vidian nerve, with the Vidian branch of the middle meningeal artery, and occasionally the small petrosal nerve; and 5. The bone, the depression in this situation being triangular. The superior sur-CEREBRAL NERVES. 663 face is concave, rough, and plexiform, and intimately united to the dura mater, which covers it, looking up- wards, forwards, and outwards. The recess in which the ganglion is situated represents a conoid triangle, the base anteriorly and externally, the apex posteriorly and internally, and is separated from the cavernous sinus by a layer from the convex edge of the tentorium and the internal carotid artery, whilst externally it is bounded by the spinous process of the sphenoid bone and middle meningeal artery; anteriorly or at the base, it exhibits three funnel-shaped apertures, the highest and smallest for the ophthalmic; the middle both in size and position for the superior maxillary; and the most inferior, the largest, for the inferior maxillary, which last is sometimes divided by a narrow septum; the smaller opening containing the hard root of the fifth,' while from the margins of these apertures processes are sent on each nerve as it escapes. _ Ophthalmic Nerve arises from the superior ante- rior angle of the ganglion, and, passing upwards and forwards, enters the outer wall of the cavernous sinus, being here somewhat flattened, with the superior mar- gm internal, and the inferior external; corresponding superiorly to the fourth, with which it is closely united, but near the sphenoidal fissure, losing that nerve, it becomes related to the third, the sixth lying below'it; but m the two posterior thirds being separated from It by the sinus and one layer of dura mater; anteriorly, however, it lies immediately below it, in consequence of crossmg from within outwards, and immediately be- hind the sphenoidal fissure it divides in three branches —lachrymal, frontal, and nasal. ' Lachrymal NERVE—Extremely small, and surround- ed by a tubule ol dura mater, enters the orbit through the apex of the sphenoidal fissure, lying above the nasal and below the superior division of the third; passing forwards and outwards, along the upper edge of the ex- ternal rectus muscle, accompanied by the lachrymal artery, it divides into three sets of filaments, namely, glandular, palpebral, and communicating: the first be- ing very numerous and flat, entering the osteal surface ot the gland, in which they terminate; the second con- sisting usually of two filaments, which pass eitherNERVOUS SYSTEM. 664 througli or between the gland and the bone, then pierce the palpebral ligament, and, descending a little, one (temporal) passes upwards and outwards, being lost in the skin on the anterior part of the temporal region, while the second, passing inwards above the ciliary margin of the lid, communicates internally with the supratrochleator to form the superior tarsal arch of nerves. The third, or communicating branch, arises at the posterior edge of the gland, and communicating with a twig of the orbital division of the superior max- illary, passes through the malar bone as the subcuta- neous malse, where it is covered by the orbicularis palpebrarum, which it perforates to reach the skin of the cheek and lower lid, communicating with branches of the portio dura. The lachrymal nerve often receives a branch of communication from the fourth, and a branch is also described as arising from it to com- municate with the superior maxillary in the spheno- maxillary fissure, but the latter we have not seen in any subject. Frontal Nerve The largest division of the oph- thalmic •, enters the orbit through the sphenoidal fissure, lying inferior and external to the fourth, and above the suptTrior division of the third, from which it is separated by the levator palpebrse, superior rectus, and one head of the external rectus; passing forwards and outwards, lying on the levator palpebr£e, which it grooves, and be- neath the periosteum, and about one inch behind the margin of the orbit, it becomes flattened, and divides into two branches,—an internal or supratrochleator, and an external or proper frontal; the former runs forwards and inwards, passes above the trochlea of the superior oblique muscle, sends down a branch to communicate with the infratrochleator, and piercing the superior palpebral ligament, escapes beneath the lower margm of the corrugator supercilii, perforates the internal fibres of the orbicularis palpebrarum, and divides into two sets of branches:—superior, which, passing upwards, supply the integuments of the centre of the forehead, orbicularis,and occipito-frontalismuscles; andmferior, which are divided into palpebral and nasal filaments; the former supplying the upper lid, and communicating with the lachrymal, while the latter, passing downwardsCEREBRAL NERVES. 665 and inwards, are distributed to the integument on the side of the nose. This branch is sometimes very large, and supplies a portion of the filaments of the proper frontal. The proper frontal passes through the supra- orbital notch, sending a small branch into the osseous diploe, which may be traced to the frontal sinus, then runs between the corrugator supercilii and the orbi- cularis palpebrarum, and, ascending, divides into two branches,—an external and internal: the former, large, passes upwards and outwards between the occipito- frontahs and the periosteum, and, dividing into long and flat branches, is principally distributed to the intpgu- ments, very few being given either to the periosteum or muscle; whde the latter or internal frontal pierces the upper fibres of the orbicularis muscle, being distributed to the integument, both sending branches as far back ; as the lambdoid suture. Nasal Nerve arises from the ophthalmic, and is in- I termediate in size between the lachrymal and frontal : enters the orbit through the base of the sphenoidal I fissure between the two heads of the external rectus I then passes between the two divisions of the third- .coursing forwards and inwards between the superior '.division of that nerve, with the superior rectus above sand the optic below, it reaches the inner wall of the .orbit, where it lies above the internal rectus and below ttbe superior oblique, here dividing into an external or imtratrochleator, and an internal or proper nasal; the 1 latter, appearing as the continued trunk of the nerve •enters a groove leading to the anterior ethmoidal fora- :imen, and, passing through it, arrives within the cavity of tthe cranium, then crosses the cribriform plate in a sul- cus or groove, and descends through the nasal slit at ^the side of the crista galli, and, entering the cavity of tthe nose, divides into an internal and external branch- ! the former passes downwards and forwards, entering the ; Jeep surface of the mucous membrane of the septum and -can be traced even as low as the floor of the nose, while tthe latter, after giving one filament to ramify on the ^anterior part of the external wall and the spongy bones rruns on the posterior surface of the nasal bones in an osseous groove, sending filaments through it to the skinV 666 NERVOUS SYSTEM. and continuing its course, pierces the fibrous tissue, ■which unites the lateral cartilage to the bone, and, be- coming cutaneous, expands into fan-like branches on the side of the nasal ala. Branches Whilst in the anterior part of the caver- nous sinus, the nasal nerve receives filaments from the sympathetic or carotid plexus, and on entering the orbit a twig of communication is given off to the superior di- vision of the third; after this, and whilst on the outer side of the optic nerve, the long root of the lenticular ganglion is given off, which will be examined hereafter with the two long ciliary branches, arising on the inner side of the optic nerve, as they appertain to the same system; lastly, at the inner wall of the orbit, the infra- trochleator branch comes off, which, passing forwards beneath the pulley of the superior oblique, pierces the inferior palpebral ligament, sending branches through the fibrous covering of the lachrymal sac to supply it as well as the nasal duct, and ultimately terminating in the lower lid, assisting in forming the inferior tarsal arch with the subcutaneous malse, and a branch from the infra-orbital. Lenticular or Ophthalmic Ganglion is somewhat lenticular or ovoid in shape, the larger extremity situated behind; the smaller in front, placed on the external side of the optic nerve, and internal to the external rectus, lying about three lines from the optic foramen; and be- hind, but at some distance from the globe of the eye, and generally surrounded by a quantity of loose fatty tissue; the surface turned towards the optic nerve is concave, whilst that on the outer side is convex, and it presents four angles,—the posterior superior receiving the long root from the nasal, and the posterior inferior that from the inferior oblique division of the third, whilst from the anterior angles arise the ciliary nerves. The ganglion consists of two very obvious constituents: at its posterior margin the two white filaments which form it unite in a loop, the concavity of which is di- rected backwards, and from these, short plexiform fila- ments pass forwards, whilst in their areolsE the granular ganglion cells are involved, so that the posterior margin is white, the anterior or greater portion being grey; butCEREBRAL NERVES. 667 it does not seem that the existence of ganglionic cells is essential to the function of the ciliary branches emanat- ing from the ganglion, as we have often observed the formative branches coalescing to form a loop vfithout the presence of a ganglion or its elements, whilst from a careful examination of the iris we could not detect any anatomical character indicating inefficiency of function during life. The ciliary branches which arise from the anterior angles of the ganglion are divisible into a su- perior and inferior fasciculus, the former consisting of from four to six, the latter of from six to ten fila- ments; these pass forwards tortuously around the optic nerve, which they leave at the sclerotic, and, turning for- wards, pierce the sclerotic at its posterior third, then run between it and the choroid, perforate the ciliary ligament, in which some of them remain, whilst others emerge from its inner circle to terminate in the iris. Tiedemann believes that the ciliary arteries are accom- panied by branches of the lenticular ganglion, the for- mer conducting them to the retina; and also states, that he has also seen a filament perforate the optic nerve with the arteria centralis retina; but that filament, described as arising from the Casserian ganglion, and joining the inferior root of the lenticular, does not exist. Naso-ciliart Nerves—These are two slender fila- : ments which arise from the nasal nerve on the internal side of the optic, and, communicating with the other ci- : liary branches, run one on each side of the optic nerve, 1 having a similar termination to those before mentioned! These nerves have been sometimes termed "long ciliary," 1 without any obvious reason or advantage. Superior Maxillary, or Second Division of the 1 Fifth, arises in common with the ophthalmic from the ^anterior and external part of the ganglion, runs almost ^horizontally forwards to reach the foramen rotundum, tthrough which it passes into the pterygo-maxillary tfossa; curving forwards along the superior wall of that tfossa, with its concavity directed upwards and forwards, lit enters the infra-orbital canal, through which it runs 'forwards and downwards, and, emerging by the infra- Ibital foramen, terminates on the face. The superior iimaxillary nerve is commonly overlapped at its origin byNERVOUS SYSTEM. 668 the ophthalmic, and in the remainder of its course within the skull, which does not exceed half-an-inch, lies close to the bone, being only separated from it by a thin layer of dura mater, being at first a little flattened, but as it passes through the foramen rotundum becoming cylin- drical and constricted by the margins of that apertur^; and whilst in the pterygo-maxillary fossa it loses the filamentous character which it possessed within the cra- nium, and becomes white and fasciculated, being easily torn into bands, often of a pearly whiteness; here the internal maxillary artery lies on its outer side, and the vertical plate of the palate to its internal. Subsequently entering the infra-orbital foramen, which lies at the junc- tion of the external and middle thirds of the spheno- maxillary fissure,—but sometimes farther outwards in- fluenced by the extent of the orbital plate of the palate bone and the depth of the os planum of the ethmoid,—it passes along this canal, lying on the infra-orbital artery, and escaping through the foramen of that name, between the outer head of the levator labii superioris alseque nasi, and the levator anguli oris, it divides into palpe- bral, nasal, and labial branches: the palpebral pass up- wards, supplying the integument and conjunction of the lower lid, communicating externally with the malar branch of the lachrymal, and internally with the infra- trochleator of the nasal; the nasal filaments run on the side and dorsum of the nose, supplying the integument, and communicating with the nasal of the ophthalmic; while the labial, which are numerous, run downwards and inwards to theupperlip, supplying the integument of that region, and there communicating with the facial nerve. Branches.—1. Ganglionic; 2. Superior dental; 3. Orbital; 4. Infra-orbital; 5. Anterior dental. Ganglionic Two branches descend from the in- ferior surface of the nerve, and being joined by filaments from the sympathetic, form Meckel's ganglion, which is an oval swelling of a grey colour, lying on the outer side of the ascending plate of the palate bone, at the su- perior part of the pterygo-maxillary fossa, and on the internal side of the internal maxillary artery in its third stage; occasionally this ganglion is absent, when the branches derived from the superior maxillary divide intoCEREBRAL NERVES. QQg those which ought to have arisen from the ganglion _ the branches being an inferior or palatine, an internal or nasal, and a posterior or Vidian. The Palatine Nerves are three in number, namely anterior, middle, and posterior. The first, or great pa- latine, descends in the posterior or pterygo-palatine canal, and, emerging on the soft palate inferiorly, passes forwards, dividing into an external and internal branch the former running internal to the alveolar process in a groove as far as the incisive foramen, where it joins Cloquet's ganglion; the latter proceeding on the centre ' of the palate, both being distributed to the mucous ; membrane and palatine glands. During the course of J the trunk through the posterior palatine canal, it sends I branches forwards through the bone (long nasal) to ra- i mify on the pituitary membrane covering the middle and ithe inferior spongy bones; also several small twigs that i pierce the inner wall of the maxillary sinus, and supnlv ; the molar teeth. -^^ ^ Middle Palatine BRANCH.—Smaller than the last- descends through a special canal in the pterygoid pro- cess of the palate bone, and, emerging inferiorly is dis- ttnbuted on the nasal surface of the soft palate. ' PosteriorPalatine Branch.—An exceedingly slen- ■:der twig, often absent; pierces the pterygoid process of tthe palate bone by a small foramen, and is lost in the -solt palate and uvula. Nasal, or Spheno-palatine, arises from the inter- nnal surface of Meckel's ganglion, and consists of two branches an external and internal, both passing into the aose by the spheno-palatine foramen; the former, on en- :tering the cavity, runs along the superior meatus and -spongy bone, supplymg the pituitary membrane of these : oarts and sometimes giving off a pharyngeal branch >which descends to the superior part of the pharynx - the aatter, or internal, sometimes called the naso-palatine or laerve of Cotunnius, passes inwards, crossing the inferior imd anterior part of the side of the body of the sphenoid 'Wne, reaches the septum, and runs downwards, forwards >:^nd inwards, enters the anterior palatine canal, and joins !he superior part of Cloquet's ganglion, the anterior ^'aiatine being connected with its inferior extremity670 NERVOUS SYSTEM. Cloquet's ganglion is exposed by sawing a wedge-shaped piece from the symphisis of the superior maxillary bones, and when this is done, a fusiform mass is seen, occupy- ing the foramen incisivum, its principal bulk being com- posed of dense periosteum, on the removal of which some fatty areolar tissue appears, and on unravelling this web, a communication is observed between the naso- palatine and the palatine nerves. We also have some- times observed a slight enlargement with a grey tinge at the point of union, but by no means constantly.^ This ganglion is described as being large in the graminivbra, and especially in the horse, in which it receives a branch from the olfactory. Cruveilhier describes the naso- palatine nerve as passing through the bone to that por- tion of the palate behind the incisor teeth; and believes, with Arnold, that Cloquet's ganglion has no existence, but we think the opinion only errs in being too general. Vidian Nerve pursues an exceedingly long course, being first without the cranium, then within that cavity, also in the tympanum or middle ear; and lastly, with- out the cranial cavity again. It arises from the poste- rior part of Meckel's ganglion, and passes outwards and backwards through the pterygoid canal, then pierces the cartilage which closes the foramen lacerum anterius in basi cranii, between the Eustachian tube and the carotid artery,—here dividing into an inferior or carotid branch, and a superior or cranial, the former being the larger of the two, and passing upwards in the carotid canal, anastomosing with the sixth, small petrosal, and sympathetic branches, to form the carotid plexus; while the latter, or the great petrosal branch, passes backwards in a groove, on the upper surface of the petrous por- tion of the temporal bone, invested by dura mater, and accompanied in its course by a branch of the middle meningeal artery, ancl enters the hiatus Fallopu, which leads into the aqueduct of the same name, in which it passes downwards, backwards, and outwards, commu- nicating with the intumescentia gangliforrais of the por- tio dura, which it again leaves, and enters the posterior wall of the tympanum, running downwards between the long crus of the incus and the manubrium of the mal- leus, and escapes through an aperture internal to theCEREBRAL NERVES, Qjl I Glasserian fissure, and then, running downwards, for- ' wards, and inwards, it unites with the gustatory nerve 1 from which it cannot be separated, and, following the . course of that nerve, terminates by forming the sub- I maxillary ganglion, some anatomists also tracing a branch tto the lingualis muscle. _ SuBMAXiLLART Ganslion—A small oval body, of a : pinkish grey colour, situated on the posterior edge of ithe hyo-glossus muscle; two filaments descend from the .gustatory to join its posterior angle; whilst again, two others, arising from the anterior angle, ascend to join rthe gustatory. Farther on, a number of sympathetic ttwigs conveyed to the gland by the facial artery like- uvise enter into its formation, and from it branches pass tto ramify on the coats of the ducts. We have seen a iifalament from the mylo-hyoid branch of the inferior den- ttal also joining it in one instance. There is some doubt aas to whether the chorda tympani really enters the -ganglion as a branch of the superior maxillary, many :authorities being disposed to leave the Vidian with the : portio dura, and tracing a distinct branch of the latter in company with the gustatory, into the submaxillary :?Iand, to preside over the rhythmic motions of its ducts iind from that continuing to the lingualis muscle, con- ■3tituting Its motor nerve. The Orbital Branch enters the orbit throuo-h the fpheno-maxillary fissure, and passing upwards and for- wards, between the outer wall of that cavity and the pe- riosteum, divides into a temporal and malar branch: the ormer, escaping through the orbital plate of the malar oone passes through the temporal muscle and fascia ii^nd, becoming superficial, terminates in integument of ihe temporal region, communicating with the portio l^'J^'^'^T'T''''^'' serves; while the latter unites with the malar branch of the lachrymal, follow- ing Its course to the cheek. Superior Dental BRANCHEs.—These are two in iuumber, superior and inferior, arising from the nerve uust before it enters the infra-orbital canal, first sending ■ tew branches to the buccinator and fat in the vicinity- ■■'hey enter proper canals in the bone, and, passing for-672 NERVOUS SYSTEM. wards, the superior communicates with the anterior dental, and the inferior with that above it, close to the canine fossa. From their inferior surface a number of branches arise, which form an intricate interlacement in the diploe, from this branches being sent into the neural apertures in the fangs of the molar and bicuspid teeth; but it does not appear that all the plexus is consumed by the dental branches, many being lost on the diploic cancellous walls of the bone. Anterior Dental.—An exceedingly large branch, arising from the infra-orbital, near the facial extremity of the canal, enters a special channel, passing at first inwards, then downwards, separated from the antrum and its lining membrane by a thin osseous plate, and having arrived at the root of the nasal process, it divides into a number of branches, some of which remain in the bone, whilst the greater number supply the incisor, canine, and first bicuspid teeth; from the outer side of the trunk a small filament passes to communicate with the posterior superior dental branch. Inferior Maxillary Nerve, or. Third Division of the Fifth, of which it is the largest branch, arises from the posterior inferior angle of the ganglion, then passes downwards, forwards, and outwards, and, escaping from the cranium by the foramen ovale, reaches the zygoma- tic fossa. In this course the hard root of the fifth lies beneath it, at the foramen ovale posterior to it, and m the fossa first lying external, then wmdmg to its fore- part, where they become intimately united; but prior to this union they can easily be distinguished, one being rrrey and plexiform, the other white and distinctly fibrous; the former giving off the sensitive branches, the latter those which are traced to the muscles of mas- tication. Whilst in the zygomatic fossa the inferior max- illary nerve has thefollowing relations:—Anteriorly the posterior edge of the internal pterygoid and the tensor Llati muscles; posteriorly the middle meningeal artery and origin of the internal lateral ligament ot the lower iaw; externally the external pterygoid; and mternally, otic ganglion ami Eustachian tube.

' Deep Temporal consists of two branches,_an an- terior and posterior, which, arising from the outer side ot the inferior maxillary, pass between the external pterygoid and the crest on the great wing of the sphe noid bone, and, communicating with branches from the buccal and masseteric nerves, ascend, one on the anterior and the other on the posterior part of the temporal fossa beneath the muscle of that name, in which they termi- nate, a branch being sent through the muscle and fascia to communicate with the temporo-auricular in the in tegument, whilst filaments are also detached deeply to ind^a^yZ^^ ~y Buccal BRANCH.—This sometimes arises sin-le or by two or three roots, from the outer side of the inferior maxillary, and these, piercing the external pterygoid unite into a single trunk, that passes forwards be-tween the temporal tendon and the external pterygoid, giving ofF twigs to those muscles, and, having a^Sved It thf posterior margin of the buccinator, divides into three sets of branches, which, diverging, supply the skin com municating with the portio dura, the greater number however, piercmgthe muscle, and being ultimately lost m the mucous membrane.

Otic or Arnold's Ganglion.—This small nervous centre may either be dissected from v?ithin by removing the petro-pharyngeal aponeurosis and Eustachian tube, or, having turned inwards the internal pterygoid, the inferior maxillary nerve should be cut across, when it will be found on its inner side. The ganglion is smaU and grey, like the ophthalmic, and possesses three roots, —one, short, from the internal pterygoid branch of the inferior maxillary; the second long, being the nervous petrosus superficialis minor, derived from the tympanic plexus; while the third is grey and soft, and comes off from the sympathetic as it surrounds the middle menin- geal artery. Its relations are the following :_Externally the inferior maxillary nerve, above the origin of its exter- nal branches; internally the Eustachian tube; anteriorly the tensor palati and the posterior edge of the internal pterygoid muscle; and posteriorly, the middle menin- geal artery, and a nervous plexus which surrounds that vessel Its branches are four,—one to the tensor tyra- pani, "a second to the tensor palati, a third to the Eus- tachian tube, and a fourth to communicate with the temporo-auricular branch. . j , The absence of this ganglion has been noticed by many anatomists, but we have invariably found it pre- sent, but with some variety as to the origin of its short root which has sometimes arisen from the trunk ot the inferior maxillary, instead of from its internal pterygoid ^^Temporo-auricular Branch.—The smallest of the three internal divisions of the nerve; arises from its outer and back part, near the base of the skull, and passes backwards and outwards between the Eustachian tube and the external pterygoid ^^'^^^'^ ^^'^'^''''^'''^^^^^^ two branches, which, having surrounded the middle me- ninc^eal artery, again unite into a single nerve which Tuus between the internal lateral ligament and the neck of the lower jaw, here dividing into a superior and in- ferior branch; the former winding round the posterior part of the superficial temporal artery and then ascend- ?ng oa the temporal region, superficial to the artery ofCEREBRAL NERVES.

Gustatory Nerve.—Smaller than the last, and on arising from the inferior maxillary, lies between the ex- ternal pterygoid and the pterygo-pharyngeal aponeu- rosis, then passes downwards between the two ptery- goids, and here receives the chorda tympani, then runs between the internal pterygoid and the ramus of the jaw, and, escaping from beneath the anterior edge of that muscle, lies on the mylo-hyoid attachment of thesuperior constrictor, above the submaxillary gland; still pursu- ing its course forwards and upwards, accompanied by the Whartonian duct, which it crosses at an acute angle, lying on the hyo-glossus and mucous membrane of the mouth, above the sublingual gland and mylo-hyoid mus- cles, it reaches the inferior surface of the tongue; and, dividing into long and slender filaments which pierce the inferior lingualis and stylo-glossus, its ultimate twigs may be traced to the simple papillae on the dorsum and tip of the tongue, where they terminate in loops. The gustatory nerve receives in the pterygoid space a con- stant branch of communication from the inferior dental, and a little lower down the chorda tympani, which is in- separably united with it; then sends the formative branches to the submaxillary ganglion, also twigs to the tonsil, half-arches of the palate and mucous membrane of the'fauces, while on the hyo-glossus a number of fila- ments join the lingual or hypo-glossal nerve to form the hyo-glossal plexus, which rests on the hyo-glossus muscle. The sense of taste resides in those parts sup- plied by the gustatory nerve. Sixth Nerve, or Abducens, is intermediate m size between the third and fourth, arising from the pyrami- dal body, just as it joins the pons varolii, then passes upwards, forwards, and outwards between the pons and the basilar process of the occipital bone, separated from its fellow by the basilar artery; it then perforates the dura mater about a quarter of an inch below the pos- terior clinoid process, and passing over the suture be- tween the petrous portion of the temporal with the sphenoid bone, courses along the inner wall of the ca- vernous sinus, lying on the outer side of the carotid ar- tery and merely separated from the blood ot the sinusCEREBRAL NERVES. 677 by the venous membrane, but at the anterior part of the cavity it passes outwards, lying immediately be- neath the ophthalmic division of the fifth, and above the ophthalmic vein, then running through the base of the sphenoidal fissure, between the two heads of the external rectus, it attaches itself to the deep surface of that mus- cle, which It supplies exclusively. Whilst in the caver- nous sinus It communicates with the sympathetic and Vidian nerves by very fine filaments which lie on the outer side of the carotid artery. Seventh Nerve consists of two portions,_portio mollis and dura or facial nerve. The portio mollis ; arises by four or five banded filaments from the side of the calamus scriptorius, which, uniting, pass upwards, forwards, and outwards before the pneumogastric and : subpeduncular lobule, becoming visible behind the crus ;cerebelli; the portio dura, white, round, and fascicu- Mated, appears to arise in the upper part of the groove .■between the restiform and olivary bodies, above the ^glosso-pharyngeal and below the pons, and windino- for- . wards beneath the crus cerebelli, it becomes applied to tthe portio mollis; but the real origin of this last nerve :niay be traced to the posterior pyramids in the imme- ' diate vicinity of the soft branch. In their course they aare separated by the restiform body, choroid plexus of the fourth ventricle, and the acoustic artery, which is a .branch of the superior cerebellar. They now pass out- wards and forwards to reach the internal auditory mea- ttus, the dura lying anterior to the mollis, but on enter- ing that canal the former becomes superior to the latter itnn/f^" . ^^^^ting between them • portio intermedia, Wrisberg), and at the extremity of ^ he meatus they separate, and each should now be fol- 1 lowed to Its termination. Auditory, Terminal DisTRiBUTroN.—When thenerve rreaches the extremity of the internal auditory meatus I t divides into the vestibular and cochlear branches! Ihe former which is most posterior, consists of three ■;ets of branches,—superior, middle, and inferior: the first ■Pierces the inner wall of the vestibule immediately be- hind the internal orifice of the aqueduct of Fallopius •and IS distributed to the utriculus and the ampulla ofNERVOUS SYSTEM. 678 the vertical and horizontal semicircular canals; the se- cond supplies the saccule; and the third, which is the smallest, is distributed to the ampulla of the oblique semicircular canal. The latter, or cochlear nerve pierces the intundibuliform canal at the inner extremity of the modiolus, and gives off lateral branches which perforate the walls of the canal, and pursuing a spiral course are distributed to the lamina spiralis. The portio mollis is extremely soft, and its neurilemma is so fine that the trunk is easily divided into fascicles, with a remarkable tendency to become varicose, in fact, seeming to be a continuation of the substance of the brain. As to its ultimate distribution much diiFerence of opinion pre- vails, analogy appearing to imply a looped arrangement, but observation has determined a primary plexiform interlacement with ultimate free points. (Todd and Bowman, pp. 83, 84.) Course and Termination of the Portio Dura.—At the inner extremity of the auditory meatus the nerve enters the aqueductusFallopii, passing at first outwards, and then bending backwards, running through the sub- stance of the inner wall of the tympanum, superior to the fenestra ovalis, and then turning downwards escapes by the stylo-mastoid foramen, whilst at the posterior wall of the tympanum it presents an enlargement (in- tumescentia gangliformis), with which the Vidian uerve is connected, and immediately previous to its escape from the bone it receives a communicating branch from the pneuraogastric (auricular nerve of Arnold). After its emergence from the stylo-mastoid foramen, it passes for- wards in the substance of the parotid gland for about half-an-inch, and then divides into temporo-facial and cervico-facial branches, and these, uniting frequently by cross branches, constitute the parotidean plexus or pes Anseriuus. Cervico-facial.—Exceedingly large, passes upwards and forwards, forming a concavity which is directed up- wards, and crossing the neck of the lower jaw, and re- ceiving a branch of communication from the temporo- auricular nerve, divides into temporal, orbital, and in- fra-orbital buccal branches, which frequently anastomose with each other, forming arches, with their convexities679 CEREBRAL NERVES. directed forwards. The temporal cross the zygomatic arch at right angles, expanding on the temporal region, and communicating with the frontal and temporo-auri- cular nerves; its branches are flat like ribbons, some terminating in the skin, and others in the frontal por- tion of the occipito-frontalis. The orbital set pass for- wards beneath the npper and lower segments of the or- bicularis palpebrarum, which they supply, together with the corrugator supercilii. The Infra-orbital or Buccal Branches consist ge- nerally of two sets, accompanying the Stenonian duct, across the masseter muscle,—one set, superficial, supply the_ zygomatics, levator labii superioris, and pyramidalis nasi; the second, deeper, are distributed to the levator anguliorisand compressor nasi, whilst long slender twigs of both divisions are given off to the integument, com- municating with the infra-orbital. Cervico-FACIAL DIVISION. — Smaller than the last, runs downwards and forwards in the substance of the parotid, and divides into buccal, mental, and cervical branches: the buccal cross the masseter, frequently com- municating and sending one or two filaments to that muscle, and, running between the fibres of the buccina- tor, supply it, communicating with the buccal branch of the inferior maxillary. The mental pass forwards for the supply of the muscles of the lower lip, anastomosing- with the mental branch of the inferior dental. The cer- vical branches run downwards and forwards, then curve upwards between the platysma and fascia, and terminate ' beneath the chin in the submaxillary region on descend- 1 mg to communicate with a superficial branch of the cer- 'vical plexus. Immediately as the trunk leaves the stylo-mastoid I foramen it gives off three small branches,—namely, pos- iterior auricular, stylo-hyoid, and digastric. The pos- Iterior auricular, arising from the external and posterior I part of the trunk, winds round the anterior and exter- inal face of the mastoid process, then ascending, sends 'One branch backwards on the occipital region, while ithe other ascends, entering the retrahens aurem, and 1 having left a twig in that muscle, it escapes and passes lupwards to reach the attollens aurem, in which it ter-G80 NERVOUS SYSTEM, minates. The stylo-hyoid enters the upper border of that muscle, and the digastric twig pierces the posterior belly of that muscle, first supplying it, and then com- municating with the glosso-pharyngeal nerve. The PoRTio Dura is destined for the supply of the superficial muscles of the face presiding over expression, and we conceive that the cutaneous branches, which in some cases are numerous, exercise a special influence in producing a corresponding movement of the skin when particular muscles are in action; this of course pre- supposing the existence of motive tissue in the tegu- mentary structure. Sir Charles Bell named it the re- spiratory nerve of the face, in consequence of the pecu- liar condition of the features in lesions of the respiratory organs. The Eighth Pair of Nerves—These consist of three portions, — namely, glosso-pharyngeal, pneumogastric, and spinal accessory. The first, which is the highest, arises by several filaments, varying in number from seven to twelve, i'rom the respiratory tract of Bell, between the olivary and restiform body, or, more properly, from the latter body, below the portio dura, and above the pneu- mogastric, which arises by eight or ten filaments in the same groove with the glosso-pharyngeal, but below it, whilst the spinal accessory takes its origin from the side of the spinal cord, opposite the fourth cervical vertebra, sometimes as low as the sixth, between the posterior roots of the spinal nerves, and the ligamentum denticu- latam, being at first small, but afterwards increased in size by filaments received from the posterior roots of the cervical nerves, particularly from the suboccipital, which occasionally terminates in it altogether. The spi- nal accessory having thus arisen, ascends between the posterior roots of the cervical nerves and the ligamen- tum denticulatum, enters the cranium through the fo- ramen magnum, lying behind the first tooth of that ligament, which separates it from the vertebral artery, then runs outwards and forwards to reach the foramen lacerum posterius, the inferior cerebellar artery bendmg backwards between it and the pneumogastric. The latter, with the glosso-pharyngeal, also pass outAvards and for- wards to reach the jugular foramen, not only the trunks,CEREBRAL NERVES. 681 but each filament of origin being invested by a neuri- lemma, and, having reached the opening, they jDerforate the dura mater in front of the jugular vein, from which they are separated by a fibrous septum, and occasionally by a complete plate of bone, the glosso-pharyngeal escaping the most anterior and external, immediately on the inner side of the inferior petrosal sinus, whilst the pneumogastric and spinal accessory emerge through a common aperture behind it. As these nerves leave the cranium a tubule of arachnoid is prolonged on them for some distance, which again enters the cranium to be continuous with the parietal layer of that membrane. In order to follow their further course with advantage the jugular foramen should be opened posteriorly, and each nerve individually examined. Glosso-pharyngeal—The smallest of the three divi- sions of the eighth pair; passes through its distinct canal, m front of the jugular vein and the pneumogastric and spinal accessory nerves, then running outwards be- tween the former and internal carotid, and descending anterior to the latter, and behind the styloid process and stylo-pharyngeus, it turns forwards and inwards coursing along the lower edge of that muscle, around which It curves to reach a triangular space, bounded above by the stylo-glossus, below by the stylo-pharyn- : geus, and in front by the hyo-glossus, which constitutes ; Its base, whilst the floor is formed by the superior cou- • stnctor. In this situation it lies behind the tonsil and im front of the palato-pharyngeus, and here divides'into iits ultimate branches. In the upper part of the iuau- lar fossa it presents a small mass of grey matter, only .involving a few of its fibres; this is named the petrosal .ganglion of Muller, but was really discovered by Eh- :renritter. The jugular ganglion (Andersch) is situated :much lower down, in a depression of the petrous portion of the temporal bone, at the inner and anterior part of 'the jugular foramen, but still in the bone which forms ;the external boundary of that opening; it includes the whole trunk of the glosso-pharyngeal, and is not always ot the same size or colour as we have seen the nerve at • this pomt only exhibiting a slight grey tinge, without the appearance of any ganglion, but in a few cases only. 2 G 3682 NERVOUS SYSTEM. The Tympanic Nerve of Jacobson arises from the juguhir ganglion, and enters a small canal, or some- times a lissure on the crest, which separates the carotid and jugular openings, and ascending, reaches the pro- montory on the inner wall of the tympanum, dividing in this situation into three short and three long branches, the former being thus distributed:—one to the fenestra ovalis; the second to the fenestra rotunda; and the third to the Eustachian tube: of the latter, one passes for- wards through the bone to join the carotid plexus in the canal of that name; the second runs upwards and forwards to communicate with the Vidian; while the third, which is named nervus petrosus superficialis mi- nor, passes upwards through a canal in the bone, and^ appears on the upper surface of the petrous portion of the temporal, external to the Vidian nerve, and then leaves the cranium in either of three ways,—namely, by the foramen spinosum, ovale, or by a fissure between the posterior extremity of the spine of the sphenoid and the petrous portion of the temporal bone, and then join- ing the otic ganglion as its long root. The three long branches of the tympanic nerve lie in canals on the promontory, but sometimes merely in grooves, several important communications being established by these branches, the glosso-pharyngeal being brought into relation with the sympathetic, fifth pair, and Vidian nerves. The branch of communication to the facial nerve also arises from the jugular ganglion; it passes downwards and outwards behind the styloid process, then curves up- wards and forwards, presenting a concavity looking up- wards, and joins the facial nerve just as it emerges from the stylo-mastoid foramen; communicating branches also unite the glosso-pharyngeal with the pneumogas- tric and the spinal accessory, sometimes appearing al- most incorporated with each other. Muscular Branches.—These are two in number, one being sent to the posterior belly of the digastric, the second subdividing for the stylo-hyoid and stylo- pharyugeus. Vascular Branches.—These are exceedingly small but numerous, running downwards on the carotid andCEREBRAL NERVES. 683 jugular vein, and communicating with branches of the superior cervical ganglion of the sympathetic. Branches to the Tonsil—These pierce the superior constrictor, forming a plexus in the gland with filaments from the gustatory and palatine nerves. Branches to the Pharynx—These consist of three or four flat filaments, passing in front of the internal carotid artery, and, curving a little upwards and for- wards, join the superior angle of the pharyngeal plexus. Terminal Branches to the Tongue The trunk of the nerve, having passed beneath the hy o-glossus, appears much diminished in size, and dividing into a number of slender branches, which, ramifying in the submucous tissue at the base of the tongue, terminate by sup- plying the mucous membrane at the base and margins of that organ. According to the experiments of Dr. Reid, the function of this nerve is purely afferent or sensative, and although essential to the gustative sense It should not be regarded as the proper nerve of taste', as Magendie endeavours to prove. Pneumogastric—The largest of the three branches and whilst within the jugular foramen it exhibits a ^n-ey or ganglionic structure, but usually without any well- marked enlargement; from this two branches come off, one, very fine and slender, joins the ganglion of An- dersch, and a second, which is named the auricular nerve of Arnold, passes backwards and outwards between the jugular vein and the bone, enters a canal at the posterior and external part of the jugular fossa, and reaches the portio dura, with which it emerges from the stylo-mastoid foramen, and having, whilst in the jugu- lar lossa, given an anastomotic twig to the nerve of Ja- cobson. It divides into three small branches, of which one joms the facial, the second communicates with the posterior auricular of the same nerve, and a third pass- ing over that crest of bone, uniting the vaginal and 1 auditory processes, which often presents a groove in this situation, terminates on the cartilage of the ear Ine trunk, having now emerged from the jugular fora' I men, lies in front of the internal jugular vein, being (here crossed by the hypo-glossal nerve; then, passing ■ backwards and inwards, it insinuates itself between theNERVOUS SYSTEM. 684 internal carotid and jugular vein, lying behind and be- tween them, and having descended in the sheath, as far f as the root of the neck, it enters the thorax, crossing b the right subclavian artery in front, and lying behind the right vena innominata, at a right angle to the for- mer; but on the left side it passes parallel, but anterior and internal to the corresponding subclavian, and behind the left vena innominata. The right nerve then runs backwards and inwards, lying in a space bounded exter- nally by the right vena innominata, internally by the arteria innominata, and above by the subclavian artery, then passing on the posterior and right side of the de- scending cava, it reaches the root of the lung, whilst the left nerve crosses the junction of the transverse and de- scending portions of the arch of the aorta, lying poste- rior and external to the corresponding phrenic, which crosses it, and, having attained the root of the left lung, it passes to its posterior surface between the ductus arteriosus and left pulmonary artery; both trunks now enter the posterior mediastinum, the left lying on the anterior and left side of the oesophagus, whilst the right is situated on the posterior and right side of that tube, and, following its course, they pass through the (Eso- phageal orifice in the diaphragm, and terminate on the stomach. From the foregoing account it will be seen that these nerves may be divided into four stages,—firstly, cranial, which, with the branches arising in this stage, have been described in detail; secondly, cervical; thirdly, thoracic; and fourthly, abdominal. The student may now examine the branches arising in the three latter stages according to the following order: — Cervical branches:—Communicating, pharyngeal, superior la- ryngeal, cardiac, right inferior laryngeaL Thoracic:— Left inferior laryngeal, pulmonary, oesophageal. Abdo- minal:—Gastric,—terminal branches to stomach, &c. Immediately below the base of the cranium the vagus presents a fusiform swelling, of a grey colour, and about one inch and a quarter iu length,—here communicating with the glosso-pharyngeal, ninth or lingual, superior cervical ganglion of the sympathetic, nervous loop of the atlas, and receiving the branch of bifurcation from the spinal accessory. ICEREBRAL NERVES. 685 Pharyngeal Nerve—A small branch, which is sometimes double, arising from the ganglion of the pneu- mogastnc, about a quarter of an inch below the base of the skull, and passing downwards and inwards, rein- forced by filaments from the glosso-pharyngeal and sym- pathetic, It joins the pharyngeal plexus. Pharyngeal PLExus.-Triangular in figure, the base corresponding to the superior and middle constrictors and the apex posteriorly between the two carotids: it IS formed by the pharyngeal branch of the pneumogas- tric, by a branch from the superior laryngeal and glosso- pharyngeal, with many grey filaments from the superior cervical ganglion of the sympathetic; and its branches, atter frequent intercommunications, are distributed to the superior and middle constrictors, as well as to the mucous membrane of the pharynx. Of this plexus the superior laryngeal and glosso-pharyngeal are alFerent, and the pharyngeal branch of the pneumogastric efi-e- rent or motor, this latter probably deriving its function from the communicating branch of the spinal accessory. Superior Laryngeal equals in size the third cere- bral nerve, and arises from the pneumogastric ganglion below the pharyngeal, then passes downwards, forwards and inwards and piercing the thyro-hyoid membrane' IS distributed principally to the mucoils membrane of the larynx In its course it lies on the superior cervical ; ganglion of the sympathetic, ascending pharynaeal ar- tery, rectus capitis anticus major, descending fi'bres of ^the s ylo-pharyngeus muscle, between the inferior and : middle constrictors; and lastly, on the thyro-hvoid : membrane; it passes behind the internal andTxterna ^ carotids, lingual and superior thyroid arteries and thyro-hyoid muscle, and whilst parsing behind the Tn :ternal carotid it gives off the external laryngeal nerte mhich running downwards and inwards, sends a fila^ ■ment to the pharyngeal plexus; a second to the thyroid ^body and a third to the inferior constrictor; the^con- tinuation of the trunk, passing beneath the tlmoidbodv ^and lying between the inferior constrictor and the ak o^- he thyroid cartilage, terminates in the crico-thyroid muscle In one case only we observed that this branch ran between the inferior and middle constrictors, Jl"cnNERVOUS SYSTEM. 686 beneath the ala of the thyroid cartilage, and turned for- wards between the latter cartilage and the cricoid, sink- ing into the deep surface of the crico-thyroid muscle; but this arrangement is far from being the rule, rather, in fact, constituting the exception. The termination of the superior laryngeal nerve enters the larynx some- times by an aperture in the thyro-hyoid membrane, or again it may run through the thyroid cartilage, and, having passed into the cavity, it divides into ascending filaments, which ramify on the epiglottis and base of the tongue, and descending, some of which terminate in the aryteno-epiglottidean folds of mucous membrane; others enter the proper arytenoid muscles, whilst a third set passes downwards internal to the thyro- and crico- arytenoid muscles, to communicate with the inferior laryngeal behind the crico-thyroid articulation. Cardiac Branches arise from the nerve at the in- ferior third of the neck,—two usually existing on the left side, and one on the right; the former cross the left carotid, communicating with the cardiac branches of the sympathetic, whilst the latter cross the subclavian artery and the arteria innominata, and assist in forming the great cardiac plexus. Eecurrent Laryngeal Nerves.—The right and left arise at different points, the former curving round the right subclavian artery, and the latter round the ductus arteriosus and arch of the aorta. The right usually winds upwards, surrounding about one-third of the subcla- vian artery in its first stage: but should it take its^ origin a little higher, it may inclose three-fourths of that vessel, then passing upwards and inwards, behind the subclavian and carotid arteries, as well as themferior thyroid and lateral lobe of the thyroid body, supported by the longus colli, it ascends in a groove between the trachea and oesophagus, then passing between the m- ferior constrictor and the oesophagus, behind the crico- thyroid articulation, it sends one branch to the posterior crico-arytenoid, two slender filaments to the lateral crico-arytenoid and thyro-arytenoid, and divides into two branches,—one ascending to anastomose with a de- scending twig of the superior laryngeal, whilst the se- cond, running upwards and backwards, tormmates luCEREBBAL NERVES. 687 the proper arytenoid, communicating with the superior laryngeal branch. The left laryngeal, having curved round the ductus arteriosus, ascends behind the aorta and is likewise received into the groove between the trachea and oesophagus, and lias a termination similar to the right. The right laryngeal recurrent sometimes arises opposite the cricoid cartilage, and running for- wards, hooks round the inferior thyroid artery in its di- j rect course to the larynx. The cause of this peculiarity lhas been pointed out by Dr. Harte, Professor of Ana- itomym the College of Surgeons. He having observed ithat It was connected with the anomalous origin of the :right subclavian artery from the descending portion of tthe arch of the aorta, proposed the following solution :ot the question:—" In the earlier periods of foetal exist- oence the brain is situated in front of the thymus gland aand aorta. The larnyx is placed at this time behind tthe ascending aorta. Hence it is that the inferior la- rryngeal nerves pass back to the larynx, separated by ithe aorta, the left going through its arch, while the rnght goes below the arteria innominata." Now if the mght subclavian arises on the left side it is obvious that Ithe recurrent must be absent as such. During the course of the inferior laryngeal nerves tihey distribute branches to the cardiac plexus, rings of tthe trachea, and inferior constrictor. With respect to tbhe function of the superior and inferior laryngeal rt would appear from the observations of Mr. Hil ton of ^«uy's Hospital, that the former is sensitive, whilst the aatter IS motor. Experiment likewise indicates a si- nnilar 1 unction; for when the pneumogastries are divided ^.bove the origin of the inferior laryngeal, paralysis of he dilators „t the glottis ensues, and the arytenoid arti ages tall into the glottis, producing asphyxia, /hich IS rendered more rapid by the immature age of nhe animal and the struggles attendant on the experi- ■aent. Pathology has also thrown light on the func- 1. on of these nerves, as it appears when the recurrent aas oeen subjected to the long-continued pressure of an • neurismal tumour, that atrophy of the laryngeal mul- • es corresponding to the affected side ensues (See Dr oanks's Clinical Reports in the Quarterly Journal forNERVOUS SYSTEM. 688 August, 1851, page 75; also, an account of Dr. Hugh Ferguson's Preparation, by Dr. E. W. Smith, Quar- terly Journal, N. S., vol. ix., page 236.) Pulmonary Branches.—These have been already examined with the lungs (see Anatomy of the Chest). (Esophageal Plexus is formed by the union of a number of filaments, which, arising from the pneumo- gastric trunks, surround that tube. G astric Branches.—When the pneumogastric nerves enter the abdomen through the oesophageal opening, the left, which is anterior, expands on the anterior sur- face and lesser curvature of the stomach, sending branches through the gastro-hepatic omentum to the liver, whilst the right expands on the posterior surface and great curvature, sending a number of branches to the solar plexus. The function of the gastric branches has given rise to much difference of opinion amongst physiologists. Wilson Philip believed them to preside over the secretion of gastric juice, as that function_ was suspended on their division in a living animal; Sir B. Brodie, on the other hand, conceives that their section checks the secretion of gastric mucus; Avhilst Dr. Reid considers that their division only impedes digestion, and that in a more marked degree in the herbivora, owing to the complexity of the function of digestion in that class of animals; and he leans to the opinion that they preside over the sensations of hunger and satiety, as emanating from the stomach. Spinal Accessory Nerve—Intermediate in size be- tween the pneumogastric and glosso-pharyngeal; escapes from the jugular foramen, and, dividing into an internal or anastomotic branch, which joins the pneumogastric, and an external, which, communicating with the glosso- pharyngeal, ninth and sympathetic nerves, passes down- wardi and outwards, lying in front of (sometimes be- hind) the jugular vein, where it is crossed by the occi- pital artery, then lies on the rectus capitis lateralis, beneath the posterior belly of the digastric, and continu- ing its course, it pierces the upper third of the sterno- mfstoid, communicating with the third and fourth cer- vical nerves in the posterior superior triangle of the neck; and, arriving at the anterior margin of the trape-CEREBRAL NERVES. 689 ! eius, it divides into two branches, one of which ascends to the cervical portion of that muscle, whilst the second ' descends in its dorsal division. Occasionally the nerve i passes beneath the sterno-mastoid without piercing its 1 fibres, but always sending one or two small filaments to lit. The function of this nerve was believed by Sir C 1 Bell to be respiratory, whilst BischofF regards it merely : as the anterior root of the pneumogastric, both resem- :bling a spinal nerve. Lingual, or Ninth Nerve, arises by six or eight small filaments from the groove between the pyramidal land olivary bodies, these being sometimes collected into ttwo roots, with the vertebral artery coursing upwards cbetween them, and, having united to form a single trunk which passes outwards and forwards, it escapes from the .cranium by the anterior condyloid foramen, lying in- tternal to the carotid artery and jugular vein; then run- ming outwards behind the former and in front of the h atter and pneumogastric nerve, it communicates with tthe eighth, sympathetic, and first and second cervical raerves; then, descending in front of the internal juo-ular v/em, It alters its course, hooking round the occ°pital nnd occasionally the sterno-mastoid branch ofthe ex- tuernal carotid, and, running downwards, forwards, and inwards, parallel but inferior to the posterior belly of :.iie digastric, it crosses the internal and external caro- ■ids and the facial arteries; then winds above the ten- Mon of the digastric and mylo-hyoid, and lies on the !iyo-glossus muscle, which separates it from the lingual jrrtery; and at the anterior edge of the latter muscle it mdes into long flat branches, which are distributed to hhe linguahs, genio-hyo-glossus, hyo- and stylo-glossus buscles. As It hooks round the occipital artery, the de- oendens nom arises, which lies on the external andan- •3rior part of the sheath of the carotid above, but below msses to the internal side, uniting with the communi- ains nom to form the omo-hyoid plexus; this branch I., however, occasionally in the sheath, and may even lie • ehind the carotid. As the trunk is passing above the i hyoides it gives off the thyro-hyoid branch, which nns downwards and forwards over the lingual artery the thyro-hyoid muscle, and lastly on thi hyo-glos-NERVOUS SYSTEM. 690 STis it communicates witli the gustatory, forming the hyo-glossal plexus. This constitutes the motor nerve of the tongue. CERVICAL PLEXUS. This plexus is formed by the anterior branches of the four first cervical nerves, which emerge from the foramina of conjugation between the rectus capitis an- ticus major, which is in front of them, and the levator anguli scapulae, which is behind them, but covered ex- ternally by the sterno-mastoid, the plexus when fully formed occupying the posterior superior triangle of the neck, requiring a tedious and laborious dissection to ex- pose it, owing to the manner in which it is invested by dense areolar tissue and the several lymphatic glands which are imbedded in it. We will now proceed to describe the mode of its formation, taking each nerve separately. The First Nerve is remarkable for its small size; it emerges from the spinal canal, beneath the vertebral ar- tery, between the occipital bone and the posterior half- arch of the atlas, behind its oblique process, and, wind- ing forwards to the anterior part of its transverse, it bends downwards, and anastomoses with an ascending branch from the second. Second Nerve is somewhat larger than the preced- ing; it passes out between the atlas and axis, also behind the articular processes, runs forwards to the intertrans- verse space, and divides into two branches,—an ascend- ing and descending, the former to communicate with the first, and the latter with the third cervical nerve. Third Nerve is double the size of the preceding, and emerges'between the axis and third cervical vertebra; it sends upwards one branch to anastomose with the se- cond, and another downwards to unite with the fourth. From this nerve are principally derived, as we shall pre- sently observe, the principal cutaneous filaments of the neck. . 1, 1 4. Fourth Nerve.—Nearly similar in size to the last, and on reaching the intertransverse space, or rather a little external to it, it receives the connecting twig from691 CERVICAL PLEXUS. the third, and likewise sends off a small branch of com- munication to the fifth cervical. It is not, however, to be supposed that the formation of the plexus consists simply of a single communication between the several nerves that compose it, the filaments of connexion being generally double, but always extremely minute, and of course difEcult to be demonstrated; it likewise commu- cates with the eighth, ninth, and superior cervical gan- glion of the sympathetic. The distribution of its seve- ral branches may be greatly simplified by dividing them into a superficial and deep set, and in this manner we propose to consider them. Superficial Bhanches—These, as their name im- plies, are all cutaneous, and from their course and di- rection have been divided into ascending and descend- ing; the former consisting of the occipitalis minor, auricularis magnus, and superficialis colli; and the lat- ter of the supra-clavicular and supra-acromiaL Occipitalis Minor arises principally from the second nerve, and arches upwards, parallel and close to the posterior edge of the sterno-mastoid, resting upon the splenius at first, then on the occipito-frontalis, and co- vered by the skin and fascia; it gives off branches backwards to anastomose with the great occipital, and a few filaments forwards to unite with the posterior auri- cular, both sets freely supplying the integuments, but giving no twigs to any of the muscles. Auricularis Magnus arises from the loop of connex- ion between the second and third cervical, passes at first backwards, till it reaches the posterior edge of the sterno-mastoid, around which it winds, and then turns forwards to rest on its external surface; it now ascends parallel but posterior to the external jugular vein, lying between the layers of the superficial fascia, and having a flattened appearance. Having arrived at the lower edge of the parotid, it throws off several fine filaments to that gland, some of which can be traced to the skin of the face, and then divides into two principal branches,—a superficial and deep; the former ascends through the notch between the lobule and tragus, and breaks up into numerous filaments for the supply of the skin of the inner part of the concha, while the lat-692 NERVOUS SYSTEM. ter, piercing a small portion of the parotid gland, and communicating with the portio dura, emerges on the mastoid process, beneath theretrahens aurem, and is dis- tributed to the integument of the corresponding surface of the concha, having given off a small twig to the oc- cipitalis minor. It supplies, however, no muscle. SuPERFiciALis CoLLT.—This arises, in common with the preceding, from the loop of the second and third nerve; passes at first backwards, and then winds for- wards around the posterior edge of the sterno-mastoid; crosses this muscle at a right-angle, beneath the exter- nal jugular vein, and, piercing first the cervical fascia, and then the platysma, divides into two branches,—a superior and inferior: the former dips at first down- wards, and then, arching upwards, divides into a number of fine filaments, which are distributed to the skin, as high as the os hyoides, while the latter take an upward direction, and dividing in the same manner, supply the integuments of the suprahyoid region, anastomosing with twigs of the portio dura. We may here observe that the two branches just described may arise dis- tinctly from the plexus and run an independent course; we have likewise seen an instance in which the superior was extremely large, and where it united directly with the cervical division of the facial, which was remarkably small, both distributing filaments from the common trunk thus formed. SurRA-ACROMiALand Supra-clavicular Branches.— These arise from the third and fourth nerves; proceed downwards over the posterior inferior triangle of the neck, imbedded in the superficial fascia, some passing outwards over the external extremity of the clavicle, where they are distributed to the skin over the anterior aspect of the deltoid (acromial), and others winding for- wards and inwards, over the centre of that bone, to supply the integuments over the greater pectoral, a tew of them extending as far as the sternum. Deep Branches.—These maybe divided into commu- nicating and muscular. The former, or communicans nom, is a small twig, sometimes double; it arises Iroin the loop of the second and third, and, passing downwards and in- wards, over the internal j ugular vein, unites on that vessel,CERVICAL PLEXUS. 693 and under the tendon of the omo-hyoid, with the descen- dens noni of the hypo-glossal, to form the omo-hyoidean plexus, which is flattened and triangular in shape; from it proceed numerous filaments for the supply of the omo-hyoid, sterno-thyroid, and sterno-hyoid, some of which proceed upwards in their structure, as far as the OS hyoides, Avhile others can be traced downwards nearly as far as their origin from the ribs; they are like- wise remarkable in being distributed to the deep and not the superficial surface of these muscles. Muscular Branches consist of branches to the an- terior recti, levator anguli, scapulae, trapezius, and rhomboidei, which need no special description, but the phrenic, destined for one of the most important muscles in the function of respiration, will require its course and distribution to be examined with greater accui-acy. The Phrenic Nerve, properly speaking, takes its direct origin from the fourth, but it also receives a large reinforcing branch from the third, and occasionally another from the fifth, which unites with it almost im- mediately after it is formed, but where this is absent it will be found that the twig to the subclavius from the brachial plexus is always extremely large, and that It throws off" to the phrenic the anastomotic branch, which passes downwards and inwards, to join it at a very acute angle, between the subclavian vein and cartilage of the first rib, and in front of the internal mammary artery. The nerve thus formed descends at first on the posterior edge of the scalenus anticus, but near the aperture of the thorax it has passed to its anterior bor- der; It is closely bound to the muscle by the deep cer- vical fascia, presenting a decidedly flattened appearance, and is crossed at a right angle by the transversalis colli and humeri arteries, while the cervicalis ascendens runs upwards, parallel but internal to it; passing now over the subclavian artery, at the junction of its first and second stages, beneath the subclavian vein, and between the thyroid axis, which is internal to it, and the edge of the scalenus, which is external to it, it enters the cavity of the thorax, lying at first to the outer side of the internal mammary artery, and then694 NERVOUS SYSTEM. bending inwards in front of this vessel, whicb throws off the comes nervi phrenici, to accompany it in the rest of its course, it becomes internal to it; reaching now the pericardium, to which it is bound down by the pleura, it runs down in front of the roots of the lung, along the sides of this fibrous bag, till it arrives at the upper surface of the diaphragm, where its pecu- liar mode of distribution to this muscle will be pre- sently described. The Left Phrenic, on entering the thorax, lies at first external to the pneumogastric nerve, but as it passes over the transverse portion of the arch of the aorta, and beneath the left vena innominata, it crosses and becomes internal to that nerve. In the remainder of its course it has similar relations to the right; but it is of greater length, as the diaphragm does not descend as high on this side as it does on the other; its direc- tion is also more oblique, from the tendency of the apex of the heart to the left side. On reaching the diaphragm the nerves from opposite sides anastomose by trans- verse filaments behind the cava, and then, dividing into numerous branches, supply both surfaces of the muscle, some ramifying between it and the pleura, others be- tween it and the peritoneum, and several extending out as far as its costal attachments; twigs are likewise sent down to supply the crura, but it is doubtful whether any filaments are given to the solar plexus. It may be necessary to observe, that a great difference in size oc- casionally may exist in the nerves of opposite sides. It may here be remarked, that the right phrenic is con- ducted to the pericardium by the arteria innominata, and the left by the left vena innominata. The posterior branches of this plexus will be de- scribed with the similar ones of the brachial. Brachial Plexus.—This is exposed by removing the superficial structures from the lower and posterior part of the neck, and separating the sterno-mastoid and the an- terior scalenus from their attachments to the clavicle and rib, and throwing them upwards and forwards; it is to be presumed that the axilla has been laid open, and properly cleared of its glands and loose areolar tissue, so that by now dividing the clavicle at the junction ofBRACHIAL PLEXUS. 695 its middle with external third, and removing the por- tion of bone between this point of section and the acro- mion process, the entire plexus will be exposed as far down as its ultimate division into its branches for the supply of the arm, fore-arm, and hands. The brachial plexus is formed by the anterior branches of the four last cervical nerves and first dorsal, which increase very slightly in size as they descend. They emerge be- tween the anterior and middle scaleni, and present the following arrangement:—The fifth and sixth run down- wards and outwards, at first separately, but, gradually converging, unite at the outer edge of the anterior sca- lenus into a single cord, which, after proceeding for a slight distance, again bifurcates, the inferior division descending to join an ascending branch of the seventh which likewise issues out between the same muscles' : and passes with less obliquity outwards, nearly as far ' ■ as the clavicle, where it also bifurcates, one division : Stretching upwards to unite with the inferior branch of ithe fifth and sixth, and the other downwards to anasto- •mose with the superior of the eighth and first dorsal. Ihese two last-nained nerves have the followint^ di^po- -sition:--The eighth cervical runs outwards, as far as the edge of the scalenus, and here unites with the tfirst dorsal, which sweeps upwards and outwards in (front of the neck of the first rib, and behind the supe- rrior intercostal artery; the compound trunk thus formed by their union soon likewise bifurcates, and Its superior branch, ascending, anastomoses with the .inferior of the seventh, thus constituting the bra- nchial plexus, which lies partly in the posterior in- •fenor and partly m the posterior superior triangle .of the neck, superior and external to the subclavian aartery, bound down and isolated by a process of the ddeep cervical fascia, which is prolonged on it from tthe margin of the anterior scalenus. Continuing now itts course downwards, it passes under the clavicle and SBubclavius muscle, lying upon the first rib and first r-ndigitation of the serratus magnus, crosses the axilla x,ehmd the artery, and ultin.ately rests on the tendon of the subscapular, the two roots of the median nerve em tracing the vessel at this point. The figure of the696 NEEVOUS SYSTEM. plexus, taken as a whole, resembles an hour-glass being expanded at its extremities, and contracted m its cen- tre, and its branches may be divided into those given off above the clavicle, or supra-clavicular, and those given off belovr it, or infra-clavicular. ^ SUPRACLAVICULAK. - These consist of muscular branches to the subclavius, scaleni, levator anguli sca- pulae, rhomboids, supra and infraspinatus, teres minor subscapular, greater and lesser pectoral, and serratus rTnus! the three last being more commonly known as t\e anterior, middle, and posterior thoracic Beanch to the Subclavius arises from the plexus a iTttle above the clavicle, and soon divides into two branches one for the muscle and the other to pass ?own in front of the subclavian vein to communicate S the phrenic, but the last is not always constant.

Posterior Thoracic, or Long Respiratory Nerve of Bell; Branch to the Serratus Magnus Lartrer than either of the two preceding; it arises from the b^ck part of the plexus, from the fifth and sixth nerves • it passes almost vertically downwards, resting on the pos- terior scalenus and covered by the phexus, emerc^es from beneath the clavicle and lies on the inner waif of the axilla, between the serratus magnus and subscapu- iaris; It is distributed to the former muscle, a laro-e branch perforating and supplying its upper part, whifst fane and long filaments can be traced downwards to its lowest indigitations, in which they are ultimately lost Infraclavicular DivisiON.—Before proceeding to the ■ description of the terminal branches of the plexus it wil be necessary to allude to a nerve which arises i'm- ; mediately below the clavicle, and must be designated .;as the inferior subscapular to distinguish it from that I branch to this muscle which has been already described This nerve is remarkable for its size as it springs from' ithe lower and outer part of the plexus, and, descending 1 through the loose areolar tissue of the axilla, it divides unto three branches, one being destined for the inner >surlace of the subscapularis, a second for the teres ma Jjor, and a third for the latissimus dorsi, along the an- 2 h698 NERVOUS SYSTEM. terior margin of which it can be traced as far nearly as its origin. The ultimate division of the plexus takes place as it lies on the tendon of the subscapularis, and they have generally been classed into branches that are external, internal, and posterior to the axillary artery; the first consisting of the external cutaneous and outer head ot the median; the second, of the internal cutaneous, in- ner head of the median, ulno-cutaneous, and ulnar; and the third, of the circumflex and musculo-spiral. We will now proceed to examine them individually. External Cutaneous.—This is likeAvise known as the musculo-cutaneous or perforans Casserii, and, after the internal, is the smallest branch of the plexus; it arises in common with the outer head of the median, descends obliquely downwards and outwards over the neck of the humerus and anterior circumflex artery, perforates or sometimes passes under the coraco-bra- chialis, then lies between the biceps in front and the brachialis anticus behind, where it occasionally com- municates by a delicate filament with the median; about two inches above the elbow-joint it escapes from be- neath the outer edge of the former muscle, and, becommg subcutaneous, divides into two branches,-an anterior and posterior: the former running downwards along the front and radial side of the fore-arm beneath the median cephalic vein and in the layers of the superficial fascia, and can be traced as low down as the thenar emmence; in its course along the fore-arm it thro^vs off numerous filaments to the integuments, and at the carpus com- municates with the radial, afterwards distributing slen- der branches to the skin of the thuinb, with others which accompany the radial artery, and are bst on the synovial membrane of the radio-carpal articulation; the latter or posterior division winds to the back-part ot he Tore a?m, descends nearly vertically, likewise in- vested in the superficial fascia, supplying the integu- ments n its course, and can be traced only as far as the l ack part of the carpus. The humeral distribution of he external cutaneous nerve is muscular, which seem to prove that it should be considered merely as an offset of Ihe median; it supplies very freely the coraco-bra- chialis, biceps, and brachialis anticus.699 BRACHIAL PLEXUS. 2 H 2 Internal Cutaneous.—Smaller than the precedino-; it arises in common with the inner head of the median- descends nearly vertically, and at variable distances be- low the axilla, perforates the fascia, and becomes subcu- taneous ; here it throws off a small twig for the supply of the integuments ofthe inner side of the arm; continuing Its course now downwards, anterior and internal to the basihc vein, about four inches above the internal con- dyle, it divides into an anterior and posterior branch; the former then subdivides into two, both occasionally' and sometnues only one, passing in front of the median basilic vem, the most external crossing to the middle of the fore-arm, the internal on its inner side, both sup- plying the integuments with numerous filaments, and can be traced down as far as the carpus. The poste- rior division descends obliquely downwards and in- wards, and on reaching the dorsal aspect of the fore-arm throws off a recurrent branch to anastomose with the nerve of Wrisberg above the olecranon process; it then proceeds downwards as for as the posterior annular liga- ment, freely supplying in its descent the skin of the back and inner part of the fore-arm. _ Nerve of Wrisberg, or Lesser Cutaneous This IS a very small twig which springs from the plexus ra- ther high up; it passes downwards and outwards, and anastomoses with the intercosto-humeral from the second dorsal, and with it is distributed to the integument of I the posterior and inner part of the arm as far down as •the elbow-jomt. Median NERVE.-This is a very large trunk, arising by two heads, which embrace the axillary artery, the external long, and intimately connected with the exter- nal cutaneous, the internal shorter and thicker, conti- nuous with the internal cutaneous and ulnar; the union ot these two heads takes place in front and a little ex- rternal to the vessel, but as it descends it crosses the lartery generally in front, but sometimes behind, and lies to Its inner side; at the bend of the elbow it is •covered by the semilunar fascia of the biceps, and then disappearing between the two heads of the pronator rraclii teres, its external or coronoid attachment separa- tting It from the ulnar artery, which it crosses, it descendsNERVOUS SYSTEM. 700 between the superficial and deep flexors of the fingers, passes beneath the annular ligament to the radial side of the flexor commiTnis, between it and the flexor pol- licis, reaches the palm of the hand, where it is flattened and expanded, lying beneath the palmar fascia above and posterior to the superficial arch of arteries; here it divides into six terminal branches, of which the most external is muscular, and destined for the muscles of the ballof the thumb, while the remaining five are distri- buted in the following manner : —One runs to the outer side of the thumb; a second to its inner side; a third to the outer side of the index finger; a fourth to the cleft between the index and middle, there subdividing to supply their opposed surfaces; and a fifth to the cleft between the middle and ring fingers, which likewise subdivides for their opposed surfaces. Those digital nerves pass beneath the arterial arch, but on arriving at the base of the first phalanges, the digital arteries split the former, so that the nerves become the most superficial, but opposite the middle of the second phalanx they again re-perforate, assuming again their primary position with respect to each other, which they retain to their termination, and besides the continued trunk which is destined for the anterior aspect of the fingers, each throws off a dorsal lateral branch, which sup- plies the root of the nail. The termination ot the ante- rior filaments is peculiar, ending in loops, which are distributed to the tactile papillae of the extremities of the fingers. In connexion with this nerve, we con- ceive it a proper place to allude to a series of re- markable structures which are found principally m the extremities, but not solely confined to them, called after the name of their discoverer, Paccinian corpuscles. Thev are situated in the areolar tissue on the extremi- ties ^ot the small offsets thrown off from the trunk of Te nerve, and are connectod to it by the neurdemma which is prolonged over them. In figure they are ge- ZevaUy oval, averaging in length in the human subject a line or perhaps a little more, and they consist of a series'of In^iina. from thirty to sixty in number, over- lamoTng each other like the layers of an onion, but with hi difference, that all the layers, with the exception701 BRACHIAL PLEXUS. of the ten or twelve most internal, are separated from each other by a thin fluid; but still, however, are con- nected by fine processes passing between the fibrous lamina, closely uniting them with each other. The fluid which fills the several intercapsular spaces does not communicate, and it may be discharged by puncture from one while the remainder still continue in a state of tension; but if once completely exhausted and al- lowed to dry, they will not become distended when immersed. The Avail of each capsule consists of two layers, the most internal of which contains minute oval nuclei, while the external is apparently fibrous. In the centre of the corpuscle is a hollow stalk, stretching through its long axis, and into this the nerve enters° having previously lost the white substance of Schwann^ which it had retained up to its perforation of the last capsule, and, running to the distal extremity of the stalk-like process, suddenly expands into a small knob, which affixes itself to the inner side of the cap- sule. It was once supposed that the Paccinian cor- puscles were in some way connected with the sense of touch, but their existence in several situations where this function could not possibly be exercised must com- pletely negative this idea. The Median Nerve gives off no branch in the arm, except occasionally a small anastomotic twig to the ex- ternal cutaneous, but in the fore-arm its filaments of supply are very numerous. In addition to several which perforate the elbow-joint, it distributes branches to all the muscles on the front of the fore-arm, with the excep- tion of the flexor carpi ulnaris, and half of the flexor profundus, which are supplied by the ulnar. It also throws off two, which have received distinct names,— the anterior interosseous and palmar cutaneous. The first of these is a long slender branch arising from the median at the bend of the elbow; it passes downwards on the interosseous ligament between the flexor pollicis on the outside, and the flexor profundus on the inside, giving numerous filaments to each as it descends; and iri front, and external to the artery of the same name, it runs beneath the pronator quadratus, and, dividing into two branches, one is distributed to the deep surface of702 NERVOUS SYSTEM. that muscle, while the other passes through the interos- seous space to communicate with the posterior interos- seous from the musculo-spiral. The palmar cutaneous is given off a little above the annular ligament, and, se- parating into two branches, the external winds out- wards to the ball of the thumb, the integument of which it supplies, while the internal passes downwards to the palm of the hand, where it is also distributed to the sldn of this region, sending a twig to the palmaris brevis. Ulnar Nerve.—This is rather smaller than the last described, with the inner head of which it arises in common; it passes obliquely downwards and inwards, at first to the ulnar side of the brachial artery, but gra- dually diverges from it, and ultimately joins the inferior profunda, lying internal to it; both now perforate the internal intermuscular septum, then the sheath of the triceps, passes into the groove between the internal con- dyle and olecranon process, between the two origins oi the flexor carpi ulnaris, arches forwards to the front of the fore-arm, in its upper third lying internal, but at some distance from the ulnar artery; as it, however descends, it gradually approximates this vessel, so that in its inferior third it is in contact with it, but still on a plane internal and slightly posterior to it; crossing now the anterior annular ligament, to which it is bound down by an expansion from the ulnar flexor, it reaches the palm of the hand, where it divides into two branches, -asuperficialanddeep; theformer again subdivides mto two, the internal of which is distributed to the inner aspect of the little finger, while the external, having thrown off- a twig of communication to the median, con- tinues its course to the fourth intercarpal space, where, bifurcating, each is distributed to the opposed surfaces of the fourtH and fifth fingers, their terminal extremities being marked with the same Paccinian corpuscles as are found on the median, dorsal lateral filaments being a so given ofl^ for the supply of the root of the nail. The poste- rior or deep branch sinks between the origins of the ab- ductor and flexor minimi digiti, m compan.y with e deep division of the artery, supplying in co^rs^^^^^^^^ muscles of the little finger; arriving now 1^ th« dons of the deep flexor, it winds outwards, thi owing ottBRACHIAL PLEXUS. 703 branches to the lumbricales and interossei, and ulti- mately terminates in supplying the adductor and deep head of the flexor pollicis brevis. The humeral division of this nerve gives off no branches whatever, but in the fore-arm, after sending a few filaments to the elbow-joint, it supplies freely the flexor carpi ulnaris and flexor profundus; about the centre of the fore-arm a twig is likewise thrown off which perforates the fascia to anastomose with the in- ternal cutaneous, and another (dorsalis carpi ulnaris), which is very large at the upper part of its inferior third, and which winds around the ulna beneath the tendon of the flexor ulnaris, becomes cutaneous a little above the posterior annular ligament, where it communicates with the dorsalis manu of the radial, divides on the back of the hand into two branches,—an internal, which is distributed to the integument of the inner side of the little finger, and an external, which, subdividing into two, one of which proceeds to the cleft between the little and ring fingers, subdivides, and supplies the skin of their opposed surfaces; while the other, on reaching the cleft between the ring and middle, likewise bifur- cates to supply their adjacent aspects. MuscuLo-spiRAL—This is the largest branch of the entire plexus, and as such appears to receive twigs from the whole of its formative nerves; it passes at first ver- tically downwards behind the ulnar, then winds back- wards and outwards in company with the superior profunda, between the internal and long head of the triceps, and, continuing its course between that mus- ' cle and the bone, the latter of which it grooves in a ! spiral manner, and emerging now on the front and . outer part of the arm, about three inches above the ex- : ternal condyle, it lies at first between the brachialis an- • ticus and the supinator longus, and then between the : latter muscle and the extensor carpi radialis longior; it mow divides into two branches, —an anterior or radial, !and a posterior or interosseous: the former descends in ■ company with the radial artery, being at first at a : slight distance, and external to it, in the middle third quite close to it, but still to its outer side; while in uts inferior it leaves it altogether, winding backwards704 NERVOUS STSTEM. around the radius and under the tendon of the supina- tor longus; and, reaching the back of the fore-arm, it becomes subcutaneous a little above the annular liga- ment, and now receives the name of dorsalis manu; it here divides into two branches,—an external and inter- nal; the former, whicb is very small, running down- wards and outwards along the external side of the thumb to supply the integuments of this part; while the latter, subdividing into two,—one of which proceeds to the cleft between the thumb and index finger, and the other between the index and middle,—again divides each into two for the supply of the opposed sides of the digits of those spaces, the most internal generally communi- cating with the dorsal of the xxlnar. The other terminal branch of the musculo-spiral, or posterior interosseous, is larger than that already described. It passes back- wards and downwards, perforating the supinator brevis, and lying close to the neck of the radius, but to its outer side; and on reaching the back of the fore-arm divides into two sets of branches,—a superficial and deep: the former by numerous filaments supplying the muscles of the same name, while the latter, having dis- tributed its twigs to the deeper set, continues its course downwards, but very much reduced in size, passes through the fourth groove of the radius, and under the tendon of the extensor communis, to be distributed oy gangliform filaments to the structures composing the carpus. „i Humeral Branches of the Musculo-spiral—Ihese consist of, firstly, an internal cutaneous, usually double, arising very high up, which, after proceeding vertically downwards for a short distance, perforates the fascia, and becoming subcutaneous, continues its course, sup- plying the integuments of the inner and back-part of the arm as far as the olecranon process; secondly, se- veral muscular branches fur the triceps, with one ex- tremely long for the anconeus; and thirdly, the spiral cutaneous, rather a large branch, which comes off frorn the nerve as it lies to the outside of the humerus; it perforates the external head of the triceps, then the fascia, and, continuing its course downwards and back- wards is distributed to the integument of the outer705 DORSAL NERVES. and posterior part of the fore-arm, as low down as the carpus. Circumflex Nerve.—This is a very large nerve, arising by a common trunk with the last described; it passes immediately backwards in company with the posterior circumflex artery through a quadrilateral space, boimded externally by the neck of the humerus; internally by the long head of the triceps; above by the capsule of the joint; and below by the conjoined tendons of the latis- simus dorsi and teres major, here occasionally throwing off twigs to the teres minor and subscapularis. Arriving now at the posterior part of the shoulder, it divides into two sets of branches,—cutaneous and muscular, the former piercing the fascia, and ramifying in all directions through the integument covering the deltoid, while the latter are distributed to the deep surface of that muscle, and can be traced as far as its insertion. DORSAL OR INTERCOSTAL NERVES. The dorsal nerves are twelve in number, and are found to decrease gradually in size from the first to the tenth, a slight increase being visible in the two last. In the description of their origin from the spinal mar- row we have already explained their double roots, the ganglion formed on their posterior, their subsequent union and division into proper anterior and posterior, with the first of which we have only now to deal, pro- posing to examine them in succession from above down- wards. First Dorsal or Cervico-brachial This is a very large nerve, emerging from between the first and second dorsal vertebras; we have already explained how it crosses upwards and outwards, in front of the neck of the first rib, and behind the superior intercostal artery to join the last cervical for the formation of the brachial plexus, but just as it escapes from the intervertebral foramen it throws oflf a small branch, a representative of the superior intercostal, which, however, does not truly enter the space between the two layers of muscles till it reaches the anterior extremity of the rib, when it then 2 H 3706 NERVOUS SYSTEM. pursues its course, supplying them, and is ultimately distributed to the integuments of the sternum. Second Intercostal—Much smaller than the last; takes a very peculiar course, first passing obliquely over the neck of the first rib to reach the first intercostal space, but on arriving at the centre of this space, it again recrosses the second rib to reach the second, where it divides into two branches,—a proper intercostal and perforating: the former continues its course like the others, supplying the muscles, and ultimately ramifying in the integuments over the sternum, while the latter, after perforating the second layer of intercostal muscles, passes downwards and outwards, and, anastomosing with the ulno-cutaneous divides into two branches, which are distributed to the inner and back part of the arm as far down as the olecranon process. Third Dorsal.—Smaller than the preceding; having passed into its corresponding intercostal space, and pro- ceeded a little beyond its centre, divides also into a proper intercostal and perforating; the former pursu- ing a similar course to the last described, to be lost on the skin of the sternum, while the latter, perforatmg the external intercostals between the origins of the ser- ratus magnus, first supplies the mammary gland, and then crosses the floor of the axilla to be distributed to the back part of the arm. Fourth, Fifth, Sixth, and Seventh Dorsal are, generally speaking, similar in their characters, running outwards and forwards over the anterior costo-trans- verse ligament to enter the intercostal spaces. A little beyond the angle of the rib, each throws off a small branch, which winds forwards on the upper margm of the rib below, but this is not always constant. Divid- ing now into two branches, the smaller or proper inter- costal continues its course to the sternum to be distri- buted to the integuments over it, supplying as it pro- ceeds numerous looped filaments to the adjacent mus- cles, whilst the larger or external perforates the outer layer of intercostals beneath the serratus magnus, which it also pierces, supplying it, the recti, triangularis sterui, and external oblique, with the integuments of707 DORSAL NERVES. the thorax and mammary gland; to which it distributes several cutaneous twigs. Eighth, Ninth, Tenth, and Eleventh Dorsal be- long to the intercostal spaces of the false ribs; they like- wise, after proceeding for some distance, divide into a continuous trunk and'a perforating branch, the first continuing its course as far as the curved cartilages of those ribs, and then, perforating the indigitations of the diaphragm, pass between the external and internal oblique muscles as far as the outer edge of the rectus, where they throw olF cutaneous branches for the sup- ply of the anterior part of the abdominal wall,—the nerve, now greatly diminished in size, pierces the sheath of the rectus, and, reaching its posterior surface, freely supplies it, some of its filaments passing through it to ramify in the integuments over the linea alba. Return- ing now to their perforating branches, we will find that they pierce the external layer of intercostals on the same line as those already described, and then, escaping through the external oblique, are distributed to the in- teguments on the lateral parts of the abdomen. Twelfth, or Last Dorsal—This, as contrasted with those already described, is a large branch emerging be- tween the last rib and the first lumbar vertebra, and running obliquely downwards along the inferior mar- gin of the former, and then piercing the transversalis aponeurosis, divides into two branches, one internal, which can be traced between the internal oblique and transversalis as far as the sheath of the rectus, where it throws ofi" a few cutaneous filaments, and then perfo- rates it to supply the inclosed muscle; the other, external and much larger, which descends obliquely outwards, enveloped in a process of the transversalis aponeu- rosis, under the ligamentum arcuatum falsum, and on the quadratus lumborum,—reaches the crest of the ilium a little anterior to its centre, pierces the internal and external oblique, and divides into a number of cu- taneous twigs, which ramify in the integuments and fat of the glutaeal region. The last intercostal always gives off a branch of communication to the lumbar plexus; but the situation in which it may be found is exceed- ingly variable, and it is always remarkably small. We708 NERVOUS SYSTEM. have seen it thrown off immediately after the emer- gence of the nerve between the rib and the first lumbar vertebra, or about the centre, or towards the outer ex- tremity of the former, and it is always easily recognised by its peculiar wavy course and flattened appearance. It joins directly with the first lumbar, and hence its name dorsi-lumbar. Before concluding our account of these nerves, it may be necessary to state that each receives a communi- cating filament from the corresponding dorsal ganglion of the sympathetic; that they pass in front of the ante- rior costo-transverse ligament, and under the pleura, to reach their proper intercostal space, where they lie be- neath the artery and vein, the latter vessel, and not the former, occupying the groove in the rib above. LUMBAR PLEXUS. This is a very important plexus, and it must be exa- mined after the abdomen has been laid open and its con- tents removed; then, by raising cautiously the anterior three-fourth of the psoas, or that portion which is at- tached to the sides of the bodies of the lumbar verte- brse, it will be observed lying on the deeper origins of that muscle, where it springs from the transverse pro- cesses ; its branches must then be each cautiously fol- lowed to their destination. The plexus is formed by the first, second, third, and fourth lumbar nerves, com- municating with each other by branches nearly vertical, also by the last dorsal and twigs from the lumbar gan- glions of the sympathetic, which descend between the vertebral origins of the psoas to unite with it. These nerves will be observed to increase rapidly in size from the first to the last, which is extremely large and flattened, while the plexus formed by their junction is of a triangular shape, the base corresponding to the side of the vertebral column and the apex externally and in- feriorly constituted by the anterior crural nerve. It consists primarily of four great divisions, viz.: inguino- cutaneous, anterior crural, obturator, and lumbo-sacral. Inguino-cutaneous—This, in order to be properly understood, must be again subdivided into four, whichLUMBAR PLEXUS. 709 areknowiibythefollowingnames:—Superiororilio-scro- tal, middle or small musculo-cutaneous, inferior or exter- nal musculo-cutaneous, and internal or genito-crural Superior or Ilio-scrotal arises from the first lum- bar, and IS large as contrasted with the others. It passes downwards and outwards, perforating the psoas to lie beneath the kidney, and on the transversalis aponeu- rosis, which separates it from the quadratus lumborum anterior to the outer edge of which it reaches the crest ot the Ilium, and, here perforating the transversalis, it divides between it and the internal oblique into two branches,--an external or gluteeo-cutaneous, which per- forates tlie last-named muscle, and then escapes between the margins of the external oblique and the latissimus dorsi to divide into filaments, which ramify in the in- teguments over the glute.alregion,-and an internal or continued trunk which pursues its course between the transversalis and internal oblique, close to the crest of the ilium and beneath the internal circumflex ilii ar- lZVJ\i T'^'' ^^^P^"°^ 'P^^ons pro- cess of the Ilium where it divides into two branches-1 an abdominal and scrotal; the former, after communi- ca ing with the small musculo-cutaneous, runs inward still between the same muscles, till it reaches the rectus where some of Its filaments are distributed to tha musl cle and others to the skin over it.

External or Inferior Musculo-cutaneous arises from the second lumbar nerve, sometimes receiving a branch from the third; it perforates the psoas and runs downwards and outwards over the iliacus internus, m- " vested in a tubule of the fascia iliaca. It now crosses under Poupart's ligament below the anterior superior spine of the ilium and beneath the fascia lata of the thigh and divides into two branches,—a posterior or gluteal and an anterior or femoral. The former winds downwards and backwards, passing m its course either over or through or under the tensor vaginae femoris, and separates into filaments for the supply of the inte- guments over the glutseal region; the lateral or femoral branch, after passing downwards for a short distance, divides into two,—an external, running downwards and backwards, is distributed to the skin of this part as far down as the lower third of the thigh in inverted loops, and an internal, which can be traced downwards nearly as low as the patella, and then, bending backwards, be- comes arched and flattened, supplying the integuments on the outer side of the thigh a little above the knee. Genito-crural—Very thin and slender; arises from the second lumbar nerve ; passing obliquely downwards and forwards, it pierces the psoas muscle, and then rests on its anterior and inner part, enveloped m a thm tubule of fascia, and covered by the ureter and spermatic ves- sels About two inches above Poupart's ligament it is generally found lying on the outer side of the external iliac artery, and here divides into two branches,—a geni- tal and crural: the former passes upwards and outwards to gain the internal abdominal ring, through wliich it emer-es, and as it traverses the oblique inguinal canal behind the cord, it distributes several twigs to the trans- versals and internal oblique: escaping at length through the external ring, it continues its course downwards and awSto^uppl^theintegumentsofth^ male and the labia ma ora in the female.

While within the pelvis it throws off several slender branches to the iliacus but generally only one, but sometimes two, to the psoas. On reaching the upper part of the thigh the nerve be- comes flattened and expanded, and after running about two inches below Poupart's ligament it is pie?ced by the external circumflex of theprofunda; here it divides into twosets of branches,_muscular and musculo-cuta- neous: the former supplying by large and distinct branches the rectus, vastus externus and internus cru- reus and subcrureus, and to these may be added the adductor longus, brevis, and pectineus, which receive a lew filaments from the twig destined for the supply of the femoral vessels. The latter or musculo-cutaneous is divided into two sets of branches,-muscular, that run along the deep surface of the sartorius, which they ulti- mately enter and supply; and cutaneous, three in num- ber,_a superior, middle, and inferior. The first passes ■ downwards beneath the sartorius, and then, perf .ratln.

The third or accessory cutaneous passes downwards along the inner side of the sartorius, and about its middle divides into two branches,—a superficial, which, becoming cuta- neous, and crossing to the inner side of the thigh, ac- companies the internal saphenous vein as far as the in- ternal condyle, where it joins the nerve of the same name; and a deep, which runs on the anterior surface of the femoral artery in the inferior fourth of its course, and terminates in forming a plexus around it as it passes through the aperture in the adductor magnus to reach the popliteal space, anastomosing here freely with the articular branch of the obturator. _ Internal SAPHENOUS.-This nerve is remarkable from its very long course, and from its distribution must be also Considered as cutaneous. It arises from the inner side of the plexus, receiYiDg immediately after its origin a twig of communication from the obturator which runs between the femoral and profunda arteries in order to reach it; passing then downwards at farst lying to the outside of the former vessel, but fterward diectly in front of it; at the lower part of Hunter s canal where the artery winds backwards and outwards to enter the popliteal space through the openiBg m the triceps it leaves it altogether, crossing to its mner side, where It gets into company with the anastomotica mag- na runs downwards along the tendon of the adductor mm then between the tendons o the gracilis and Trforius, and at the inner side of the knee becomes cu- taneous, and joins the internal saphenous vem, lying at fir anterior'to it, then behind it, and then m fron o it again; with it, along the posterior and ^"^^^P^^/^^^ the le-, it continues Its course, passing m front of the nte nal malleolus, and then winding forwards on the inner side of the foot, the ^^^^^S^^-^^^^f :^^:\t.^h the nliP^ as far as the great toe.

This branch is some-LUMBAR PLEXUS. 713 times an offset from the obturator. Behind the internal condyle a second branch is always given off which per- forates the sartorius, and then, descending for a short distance, again winds upwards and outwards over the ligamentum patella, and is lost in fine cutaneous fila- ments in the skin on the inner side of the joint; while from the upper part or concavity of the arch thus formed twigs are sent up to supply the integuments over the patella, while others pass off from its convexity to be distributed to the superficial structures on the front of the upper third of the tibia. As the internal saphenous continues its course on the inner and bacli-part of the leg, much diminished in size from giving off this patellar branch, it throws off several filaments both to its inner and back part, and also a branch about two inches above the ankle-joint, which passes downwards and back- wards, supplying the integuments on the internal mal- leolus and heel. On the inner side of the foot it sends filaments to the several articulations, and others to anas- tomose with the musculo-cutaneous of the peroneal. Obturator Nerve.—Much smaller than the anterior crural ; it arises from the third and fourth lumbar nerves, crossing the ilio lumbar artery, which separates It from the lumbo-sacral nerve; it then passes outwards and forwards, first between the angle of bifurcation of the external and internal iliac arteries, and then along the wall of the true pelvis beneath the peritoneum, and buried m the subserous tissue, having below it its own artery, and above it the external iliac vein; arriv- ing now at the anterior wall of the cavity, it escapes through the oblique groove in the upper part of the thyroid foramen, perforating in succession the follow- ing partsVesical fascia; 2. A few fibres of the levator am; 3. The obturator fascia; 4. Obturator in- ternus; 5. The obturator membrane; and fi. The obtu- rator externus, which it supplies as it passes through, but gives off no branch to any of the structures within the pelvis. Emerging now in the femoral region be- neath the pectineus, where it divides into two branches, —an anterior, which descends between the adductor lon- gus and brevis, and terminating in three branches for the supply of both these muscles, as well as the gracilisNERVOUS SYSTEM. 714 wliile a few twigs become cutaneous, and can be traced down to the integument on the back part of the leg, to which it is distributed; the posterior division is large, and lies at first between the adductor brevis and mag- nus, and then breaks up into a number of filaments for the supply of the latter muscle, while one longer than the others runs down between the adductor magnus and the linea aspera, and, perforating the attachment of the muscle in its lower third, enters the popliteal space, pierces theligamentum posticum of Winslow, and is distributed to the knee-joint; here it will be neces- sary to allude to a branch, not, however, invariably pre- sent; it is termed the accessory of the obturator; when it does exist, it usually arises from the obturator itself immediately after its origin, or it may spring from the third or fourth lumbar nerves as a separate branch; it passes downwards and forwards on the inner side of the psoas and beneath the fascia, crosses over the hori- zontal ramus of the pubis, dips beneath the pectmeus, to the under surface of which it gives filaments, as well as to the femoral articulation, and ultimately terminates by uniting with the anterior division of the obturator itself. The communicating branch between the last- named nerve and the internal saphenous may be almost constantly found in the angle of bifurcation between the femoral and profunda arteries, but from its very small size, and the manner in which it is involved in the loose areolar tissue so abundant m this part, it sometimes escapes observation. _ LUMBO-SACRAL.—This is the largest division ot the entire plexus, and arises from the fourth and filth branches, sometimes receiving a twig from the third; it passes downwards into the pelvis, resting on the sacro-iliac synchondrosis and covered by the internal iliac, slutfeal, and ilio-lumbar arteries, with their cor- responding veins, and a little above the upper margin of the great sciatic notch divides into two branches,—a communicating, which passes downwards and outwards to unite with the first sacral nerve; and the superior gluta^al, which emerges from the upper and anterior part of the notch, above the pyriformis; passing now forwards between the glut£BUS medius and minimus, itSACRAL PLEXUS. 715 divides into two branches,—a sujoerior, which courses along'the upper margin of the latter muscle, supplying both It and the medius; and an inferior, which, crossing It about its centre, gives filaments to both, and, emerg- ing from between them, pierces the sheath of the tensor vagina3 femoris, in which muscle it is ultimately ex- pended. SACRAL NERVES. These are six in number, and, unlike the lumbar, de- crease m size as they descend. The first and second, which are very large, pass obliquely downwards and outwards, and on the pyriformis unite; the third and fourth, which are only half as large as either of the two pre- cedmg, run more horizontally outwards, and join the compound trunk of the first and second; the fifth, on .emerging from the sacral foramen, divides into two branches, one of which ascends to unite with the fourth, \while the other descends to communicate with the sixth; ■this last nerve is so very small, that its very existence has been sometimes denied, but it always may be found -by cautious dissection. While still within its proper : toramen it divides into its anterior and posterior branch Uhe former, on reaching the front of the sacrum, again >3Ubdividing, one ascending to join the fifth, and the other passing downwards to supply the integument about the coccyx, and also sending a few filaments to 'the giutffius maximus. ^ The Sacral Plexus is, however, constituted by the -our first nerves only, with the communicating branch 3t the himbo-sacral and twigs of the sympathetic. It -s of a triangular shape, the base at the sacrum, and the upex at the great sciatic notch, resting on the pyrifor- nis and covered by the bladder, rectum, vesicular semi- lales, and posterior layer of the pelvic fascia, which eparates it from the descending branches of the inter- lal iliac artery. While within the pelvis it gives off tranches to the bladder and rectum, with the uterus and •agma m the female—some directly to these organs, and 'thers lo join the hypogastric plexus; these being princi- )ally derived from the Iburth and fifth nerves- it likc- nse supplies the following muscles :-Pyriformis, levatorNERVOUS SYSTEM. 716 ani, and obturator internus; that for the first, arising generally from the third, divides into two, and sinks into its anterior surface; that for the second, likewise consisting of two, derived from the fourth, one of which is distributed to the centre, and the other to the ante- rior part of the muscle; and that for the third, which usually springs from the first, and, passing out through the great sciatic notch, and crossing the spine, enters by the lesser sciatic notch, and dividing into three or four filaments, is distributed to the pelvic surface of the obturator internus. In addition to these, it likewise supplies special branches to the superior gemellus and quadratus femoris. The external branches of the plexus are the pudic, inferior glutseal, posterior cutaneous, and lesser and greater sciatic. Pudic Nerve.—Eatber a large branch, springing from the posterior part of the plexus, generally from the third or fourth; it leaves the pelvis through the great sciatic notch, and, crossing the spine of the ischium where it lies inferior to its artery, it again re-enters it through the lesser, and reaches a triangular groove, bounded externally by the tuber ischii and obturator internus; internally by the obturator fascia; and mfe- riorly by the falciform process of the great sciatic hga- ment; here it divides into two branches,—the dorsahs penis and perineal: the former ascends through the anterior part^of the ischio-rectal fossa, between the obtu- rator internus, which is external to it, and the levator ani, which is internal to it, and on reaching the symphisis pubis it passes directly forwards below the subpubic ligament and above the triangular; runs now along the dorsum of the penis in company with its artery, but external to it; reaches the corona glandis, and, .sinking deeply between it and the corpora cavernosa, divides into numerous filaments, which, perforating the spongy structure of the glans, can be traced to the papilla; on its surface. About the centre of the penis it throws ofi" a large cutaneous branch, which, after distributing several twigs to the integuments of its sides and dor- sum, continues its course forwards, and is finally lost in supplying the folds of the prepuce. The latter or perineal division is much larger than that just described.717 SACRAL PLEXUS. it lies at first inferior to the pudic artery, but after- wards ascends above it, and, running forwards towards the superior and anterior part of the tuber iscbii, di- vides into three branches,—a superficial external, a su- perficial internal, and bulbo-urethral. Superficial External (Long Perineal) passes at first downwards, perforating the falciform process of the great sciatic ligament, then winds forwards and upwards on the crus penis, and, becoming cutaneous, terminates in supplying the dartoid structure and integuments of the scrotum in the male, and the labia majora in the female. In its course it always gives ofi" a branch to the verge of the anus. Superficial Internal (Long Perineal).—Larger than the last; it pierces the obturator fascia, and in com- pany with the long perineal artery crosses the triangular space between the urethral muscles, reaches the "scro- tum, to the integuments of the central region of which It is distributed, several long filaments being prolonged to the under surface and sides of the penis, extending even as far as the prepuce. Bulbo-urethral._A thick, short branch; it also perforates the obturator fascia and base of the triangular ligament, and, crossing inwards beneath the accelerator lunnffi, IS distributed to the bulb and corpus spongio- sum. In the female, the pudic nerve likewise gives°oflF numerous branches to the vagina, which generally pro- ceed as far as its external orifice. Inferior Glut.eal arises from the back part of the tplexus and leaves the pelvis through the great sciatic -notch below the pyriformis, and behind the great ischia- rtic nerve. While beneath the glutajus maximus it '.divides into two branches,—muscular and cutaneous • the tformer of which, breaking up into numerous twigs, is ' distributed to that muscle only, while the latter passes mt first downwards, and then, emerging beneath its infe- mor margin, winds upwards, and dividing into two iportions, supplies by long and slender filaments the in- tteguments over it. Lesser Sciatic arises in common with the last, and ;passes out of the pelvis in company with it, and with •the same relations. Beneath the gluta^us maximus itNERVOUS SYSTEM. 718 divides also into two branches,—muscular and cutaneous: the former being distributed to the origin of the ham- string muscles and rotators outwards, while the latter, emerging from beneath the edge of the glutseus maxi- mus, again subdivides into two,—an internal and exter- nal: the former, winding downwards on the inner side of the thigh, and becoming subcutaneous, supplies the integuments of that region, while the latter (long pudendal nerve of Soemerring) runs forwards and in- wards, and, crossing the tuber ischii, reaches the peri- neum, where it lies between the layers of the superficial fascia; here it anastomoses freely with the long peri- neal of the pudic, and continuing its course to the back part of the scrotum, it divides into two branches,—one of which runs forwards external, and the other internal, to the testicle, and, uniting in front of it, they form an arch from which nvxmerous filaments are distributed to the dartoid structure, septum, and skin of the front of the scrotum. PosTEEioR Cutaneous.—This may arise either sepa- rately from the plexus or from the greater or lesser sciatic, or from the inferior gluteal; it is always of small size, and it leaves the pelvis by the great sciatic notch, below the pyriformis, and running nearly vertically downwards, beneath the gluta^us maximus, it becomes cutaneous in the upper third of the thigh, and after distributing numerous filaments to the inte- ffuments of this region, its terminal twig may be traced over the popliteal space to the back of the leg, where it unites with the external saphenous, but m many in- stances it may be followed still lower, even as far as the back part of the malleolus. In order to avoid any confusion that might arise on this subject, we consider it proper to state that the three nerves last alluded to are sometimes described under one name,—the inferior glutseal, and in this case the posterior cutaneous and lesser sciatic must, of course, be considered as its dependent offsets. GuEAT Sciatic—This is one of the largest nerves in the whole body, and must be considered as formed not onlv by the four sacral nerves, but also by the communi- cating, from the lumbo-sacral. It leaves the pelvis bySACRAL PLEXUS. 'JIQ the great sciatic notch, below the pyriformis, or it may occasionally emerge in two divisions, one of which will pierce that muscle, while the other will pass out beneath it, and descending nearly vertically downwards, until it reaches the upper part of the popliteal space, it di- vides into two branches: an external, the smaller, the peroneal; and internal, much larger,—the popliteal. In this course along the back part of the thigh, it rests on the small rotators outwards, between the tuberosity of the ischium and great trochanter, and covered by the glutEeus maximus, but farther down it lies on the adductor magnus, and beneath the hamstring muscles, supplying the adductor, the semitendinosus, semimem- Ibranosus, and biceps, as it descends, and being always 1 invested by a quantity of fine adipose areolar tfssue. Popliteal, or Posterior Tibial This, from its size : and direction, must be considered as the continuation of ;the great sciatic; it runs downwards nearly vertically 1 immediately beneath the fascia of the popliteal space .enveloped m fat, and then under the heads of the o-as- ttrocnemius, through the intercondyloid space, lying at rfirst external to its artery, and then crossing it obliquely ssp as to reach its inner side; passing now over the pop- ilitffius muscle, it descends between the heads of the ssolseus, and recrossing the posterior tibial artery in the -upper third of the leg, so as to lie external to it, it con- tinues Its course along the internal side of the teudo- .Achilhs to the space between the os calcis and internal ^malleolus, where it divides into external and internal :plantar, having, however, recrossed to the inner side of •the artery previous to its division, and being separated ;from It by one of the venai comites. Of its two terminal branches the internal is the largest; it runs at first downwards and forwards, till it reaches the groove be- neath the OS calcis, where it throws off a branch for the •supply of the integuments of the heel, and then, continu- ing Its course forwards and inwards, enveloped in a sheath of dense fibrous tissue, between the flexor di^i- torum brevis and flexor pollicis brevis, as far as the pos- terior extremities of the metacarpal bones, it divides mto four branches, which are distributed in the follow- ing manner:—The first, or most internal, to the innerNERVOUS SYSTEM. 720 side of the great toe; the second to the cleft between the first and second toes, where it divides into two to sup- ply their opposed surfaces; the third to the cleft be- tween the second and third toes, where a similar divi- sion also takes place for their opposed sides, while the fourth runs to the cleft between the third and fourth, supplying their adjacent surfaces in the same manner, and generally throwing off an anastomotic twig to the external plantar. In addition to those digital branches it also gives filaments to the contiguous muscles, several to the skin on the inner side of the sole of the foot, and others to the articulations in its vicinity. The External Plantar Nerve is much smaller than the internal-, it crosses the foot obliquely forwards and outwards, also in a dense fibrous canal between the flexor digitorum brevis and musculus accessorius, then turns forwards between the flexor digitorum brevis and flexor minimi digiti, and at the base of the meta- tarsal bone of the little toe divides into two branches,— a superficial and deep: the former continues its course forwards, and subdividing into two, the most external is distributed to the outer side of the lesser toe, while the internal, on reaching the cleft between the fourth and fifth, also divides into two for the supply ot their opposed surfaces; the latter or deep branch accompa- nies the external plantar artery, sinking deep y beneath the three first layers of the plantar muscles, and throwing off branches to the adductor poUicis, transversus pedis lumbricales, interossei, and musculus accessorius, with a few articular filaments. _ While in the popliteal space the posterior tibial nerve gives off three twigs to the joint, viz., superior and in- ferior articular, and azygos; these accompany the arte- ries of the same name, supplying the inner and posterior part of the articulation. It also here throws off a remark- able branch,_the communicans tibialis, which, pass- in- downwards and outwards beneath the fascia at first, and then between the heads of the gastrocnemi s, um^^^^^ at variable distances on the back of the leg, with a .ma twi-from the peroneal,—communicans peronei; tlitir twi"'troni \nti ut^iuuciii,— —- . , junction constituting the posterior or -^^ernal saj^^^^^ nous nerve, which descends in company with its correSACRAL PLEXUS. Y21 spending vein in a fibrous canal behind the external malleolus, supplying at this point the integuments on the outer side of the heel, and then arching forwards along the external aspect of the foot, to which it distri- butes numerous filaments, ultimately terminating on the outside of the lesser toe. The muscular branches which the posterior tibial gives off in this region are those to the gastrocnemius, sol^eus, and plan tans; but while on the back of the leg it supplies all the deep muscles, be- sides distributing several cutaneous filaments to its in- vesting integument. Peroneal DivisiON.-This is much smaller than the lastdescnbed;immediatelyafteritsoriginfromthe sciatic It runs downwards and outwards, parallel but internal to the tendon of the biceps, and over the outer head of the . gastrocnemius next winds round the neck of the fibula . and beneath the perona3us longus, where it divides into Its two terminal branches of nearly the same size,_the ; anterior tibial and musculo-cutaneous,_having, how- . ever, previously given off some filaments to the tibialis ; anticus, like^vise a cutaneous, for the supply of the skin .on the outer part of the leg, and also the communicans iperon^i, to unite with the communicans tibialis foX !£™ ibed. " '"'""^ ^^^^^^^^ Akterior TIBL.L This nerve, immediately after its origm, receives.a branch of communication from the [posterior tibial, and then passes forwards and inwards ssometimes through, and sometimes beneath, the exlnso; ■communis, and thus reaches its correspond n^ arterv to vwhich It at first lies external, then anterior^ andTilt!- ^ately internal, supplying freely inits course the several -muscles between which it runs; passing now beneath the ..annular ligament in the sheath of the extensor pdlS .^vides into two branches,_an internal and externa tthe former the larger, gliding beneath the dorsahs po : liicis artery, and over the first interosseous space a|ain ...me freeJycommunicating witluhemuiulo-cuLeous 2i722 NERVOUS SYSTEM. nerve; the external branch passes almost directly out- wards between the tarsus and extensor brevis, and is expanded in supplying that muscle as well as the in- terossei. Musculo-CUTANEOUS.—The second division of the pe- rouasal nerve; descends nearly vertically between the extensor communis and perona3us longus, and, piercing the fascia about two inches above the ankle-joint, and becoming subcutaneous, divides into two branches,— an external and internal; these pass over the annular ligament, and reaching the dorsum of the foot, the ex- ternal divides into three branches, each of which bifur- cates at the cleft between the toes; the outer at that between the fourth and fifth; the middle at that between the third and fourth; and the internal at that between the second and third: and these secondary branches sup- ply the skin on the dorsum and sides of the opposed surfaces of each of the corresponding toes; the internal division of the musculo-cutaneous, on the contrary, usu- ally continues as a single trunk to the cleft between the first and second toes, and here bifurcating, is distributed to their adjacent surfaces. This is the most usual course observed in the distribution of this nerve, but at the same time it must be remarked, that it is subject to several varieties in its ultimate ramifications. The MuscuLO-cuTANEOus Nerve while in the leg gives off two or three filaments to the peronajus longus, and one or two to the integuments over the external malleolus; it likewise freely communicates in the foot with both saphente. Posterior Spinal Nerves.—These may now be ex- amined in succession, commencing with the— First Cervical.—This is larger than the anterior division, and after its exit from the foramen of conju- gation passes backwards and inwards between the pos- terior half-arch of the atlas and vertebral artery, pre- senting here a kind of gaugliform enlargement; entering now into the triangular space, between the oblique and rectus, it divides into several filaments for the supply of those muscles and the complexus; it also communi- cates with the second. Second Cervical.—This is remarkable for its greatPOSTERIOR SPINAL NERVE. 723 2 I 2 size, being nearly four times larger than its anterior branch. It escapes between the atlas and axis, and throws off communicating twigs to the first and third nerves; passes upwards over the inferior oblique and the triangular space, covered by the complexus, which it afterwards perforates very obliquely, between the last- named muscle and the trapezius, being in company with, but internal to, the occipital artery; piercing now the trapezius, it becomes subcutaneous, and divides into a series of branches of a flattened form, which are dis- tributed exclusively to the scalp and hair follicles of the occipital region. While in the neck it distributes large branches to the inferior oblique, splenius, com- plexus, and trapezius. ' Third Cervical is much smaller than the last; it emerges between the axis and third cervical vertebra, and immediately sends off an anastomotic twig to the second; it now continues its course inwards between the semispmalis colli and complexus; and at the internal border of the last muscle divides into two branches,— a cranial and cervical, both cutaneous; the former per- forates the attachments of tlie complexus and trapezius to the spinous processes, becomes cutaneous, and is dis- tributed to the integuments of the mesial line of the occipital region, while the latter, also piercing the same muscles, is immediately reflected outwards for the sup- ply of the skin of this region. The anastomosis which we have alluded to between the three nerves just de- scribed constitute what has been called the posterior cervical plexus, which lies between the complexus and semispmalis, in company with the posterior jugular vein and cervicalis profunda artery. Its branches°of supply are distributed to the two muscles just mentioned and the splenius. It would be tedious as well as unnecessary to de scribe individually the posterior branches of the five re- maining cervical nerves, as their course and ultimate distribution are almost precisely similar, running at first inwards between the complexus and semispinalis colli to each of which they give muscular branches, as well as to the multifidus spinse, and then perforating the su-724 NERVOUS SYSTEM. perimposed muscles, are distributed to the integument on the posterior part of the neck. The posterior branches of the eight first dorsal nerves may be likewise described in conjunction, as they are all very similar in their course and distribution, but much smaller than the inferior branches of the posterior cer- vical. After their separation from the anterior corre- sponding division, each posterior dorsal nerve passes almost directly backwards in company with the vein and artery, through a quadrilateral space, bounded above and below by the transverse processes of the contiguous vertebrEc; internally by the intervertebral substance; and externally by the anterior costo-transverse liga- ment- reaching now the outer border of the semispi- nalis dorsi, they divide into two sets of branches,—mus- cular and cutaneous; the former supplying the levatores costarum and erectors of the spine, while the latter, after distributing some twigs to the semispmalis dorsi, wind backwards and inwards over its superficial surface, until they arrive at the spinous processes, where, piercing the aponeurosis of the latissimus dorsi, they are agam re- flected forwards between it and the trapezius, and agam perforating the latter muscle, they become subcutaneous, and are distributed to the skin of the thorax in broad, ribbon-like branches. The posterior divisions of the four last dorsal are very similar to theprecedmg, but their muscular branch is very small, and is distributed almost exclusively to the multifidus spinc% while the cutaneous, passing backwards through the muscular fibres of the erectors of the spine, which they very freely supply, next perforate the aponeurosis of the transversalis, internal oblique, and latissimus dorsi, and becoming subcutane- ous they divide into external and internal branches, the'former passing nearly vertically downwards, and supplying the integuments as low as the glutasal region, while the latter winds inwards towards the spine, to be distributed to the skin in that position. Pos^EuiOE LnMBAK BRANCHES.-Thesc gradually decrease in size from above downwards, and, like tne dorsal a" expanded in supplying the lumbar mass of TTinsrlps and the integuments over them. roSTERioH SACKAiT-These, like the last, decrease m725 SYMPATHETIC NERVES. size from above downwards. On emerging from the sacral foramina, they freely communicate with each other, and then divide into branches to supply the ad- jacent muscles, as well as the integument over the sacral and glutasal regions. SYMPATHETIC SYSTEM. This presides over the functions of organic life, and consists of two long knotted cords, stretching from the base of the cranium above to the coccyx below, on either side of the spinal column, where they communi- cate by a common mass, termed the ganglion impar. In order to understand its arrangement properly, it will be necessaiy to divide it into a cervical, thoracic, abdominah and sacral portion; to examine its ganglia in each of those regions, and briefly describe the branches which it supplies, Avith the various plexuses which it forms in the course of its long descent. _ Cekvical Portion consists of three ganglia,—supe- rior, middle, and inferior, connected to each other by an intervening nervous communication, rendering them continuous with each other. _ Superior Ganglion, fusiform in shape, of a greyish- pink colour, and in length varying from one to four inches, its upper extremity being situated about three- quarters of an inch from the carotid foramen, while its inferior, which is sometimes bifid, gives oif the branch to the middle. It usually corresponds posteriorly to the second and third cervical vertebra, and is covered by the internal carotid artery, pneumogastric, glosso- pharyngeal, and lingual nerves, while the internal jugular vein lies posterior and external to it. The branches which it throws off have been divided into superior, inferior, external, internal, and anterior, and these we now propose to examine in order. Superior Branch.—This proceeds upwards from the summit of the ganglion, and, entering the carotid canal, it divides into two, which run on the inside and outside of the artery, presenting at its first turn an en- largement described as the carotid ganglion (Lob- stein); a little farther on it communicates with the Vidian, as the latter perforates the cartilage which fills726 NEEVOUS SYSTEM. the anterior lacerated hole, as well as with the nerve of Jacobson, or tympanic plexus, and on entering the cavernous sinus, it anastomoses by several filaments with the sixth nerve. From the plexus formed in this last situation two twigs are given oS which accompany the anterior cerebral artery as far as the arteria com- municans, on which they unite to .form the ganglion of Eibes, the existence of which may be considered fairly questionable; while in the cavernous sinus it likewise communicates with the third, Casserian, and lenticular ganglions, whilst it also sends oflf branches to the pituitary body, with others to accompany the ultimate divisions of the internal carotid, around which they form complicated plexuses. Inferior Branch.—This consists of a fine tapering cord, which descends behind the sheath of the vessels, to which it is connected by fine areolar tissue, as far as the inferior thyroid artery, where it joins the middle, or, where that has no existence, continuing downwards as far as the inferior ganglion. In its course it com- municates by one or two twigs with the cervical plexus, also with the superior cardiac and superior laryngeal. External Branches.—These pass backwards to unite with the first and second cervical, but particu- larly with the latter, a distinct twig being sometimes given to the phrenic. . Internal Branches—These may be divided into vascular and visceral; the former accompany the exter- nal carotid, around the branches of which it forms nu- merous plexuses and minute ganglia, accompanying them to their ultimate termination; while the latter or visceral may be again subdivided into pharyngeal, laryn- geal, and cardiac; the first uniting with the branches of the glosso-pharyngeal and pneumogastric to torm the pharyngeal plexus for the supply of tlie muscles oi the pharynx; the second communicating with the su- perior laryngeal for the supply of that tube, while the third is destined for the heart, and will presently be more particularly alluded to. i * ,i • i. Anterior BuANCHES.-These consist of short thick branches of communication to the eighth nerve; la- ments are also occasionally given to the ninth, but are not always capable of demonstration.727 SYMPATHETIC NERVES. Middle Cervical Ganglion may be sometimes ab- sent, but where it does exist, it is found opposite the fourth or fiflh cervical vertebrse, resting on the inferior thyroid artery, but sometimes behind it. According to our observation, in figure it is diamond-shaped, its long measurement being from above downwards, throw- ing off branches from each of its angles, viz.: superior, inferior, internal, and external. ^ Superior Branch—Merely the cord of communica- tion already described between the two ganglions ; it generally becomes expanded as it joins the middle. Inferior Branch.—This may be either single, or it may consist of several, which descend to connect it to the inferior ganglion. External.—Twigs of communication to the cervical plexus, one of which usually joins the phrenic directly. Internal Branch.—Cardiac, to be hereafter de- scribed. Inferior ^ Cervical Ganglion is small, semilunar in figure, its concavity directed upwards and for- wards, its convexity downwards and backwards, and it rests upon the transverse process of the seventh cer- vical vertebra, covered by the vertebral artery, whicli it sometimes entirely surrounds. Its internal cornu receives the communicating twig from the middle, while its external throws off filaments to the brachial plexus, and also a branch to accompany the vertebral artery as it ascends through the foramina of the trans- verse processes, communicating in its course with the su- perior cervical nerves, and ultimately entering the cranium, to form plexuses to accompany the ramifi- cations of the basilar artery, as it supplies the cerebrum and cerebellum; branches are also thrown off from the lower, or convex margin of the ganglion to unite with the first thoracic and recurrent nerve, and some of these passing in front, and others behind the subclavian artery, they invest it with a species of nervous rin"- (annulus of Vieussens). ° Cardiac Nerves are threeinnumber on each side: supe- rior, middle, and inferior; and are destined for the heart. Superior Cardiac Nerve arises by five or six fila- ments from the front of the superior cervical ganglion,NERVOUS SYSTEM. 728 and these uniting into one cord, after receiving a twig from the second cervical nerve, it descends on the right side, close to the trachea, external and posterior to the common carotid, sending filaments to the thyroid gland, pharyngeal plexus, and pnenmogastric nerve; at the lower part of the neck it winds outwards, and crosses between the subclavian vein and artery, and behind the middle cardiac, and here divides into filaments, which •unite with others from the recurrents and inferior cardiac. The nerve of the left side pursues nearly a similar course, but at the lower part of the neck it passes between the subclavian and carotid arteries, and at their origin divides into numerous branches, some of which run along the aorta, to unite with the inferior cardiac, while others pass behind it, to join the cardiac ganglion. Middle Cardiac Nerves.—Usually very large; they arise from the inner side of the middle cervical ganglion by five or six roots, which soon unite to form a single trunk; after comm^micating by two or three filaments with the pnenmogastric, it descends between the sub- clavian vein and artery, anastomoses with the recurrent, then passes downwards on the outside of the arteria innominata, and then between the arch of the aorta and bifurcation of the trachea, where it expands to form the cardiac ganglion. The nerve of the left side is not as large as the preceding at its origin, but it receives a reinforcing branch from the inferior cervical ganglion, as well as two or three twigs from the pneumogastric, and then passes behind the arch of the aorta, and termi- nates in the cardiac ganglion. _ Inferior Cardiac Nerves—These arise from the inferior cervical ganglions by numerous filaments, which afterwards unite, and then pass downwards behind the subclavian artery on the right side, and along the side of the pulmonary artery on the left, ternunatmg in the cardiac plexus on the front of the trachea, and behind the aorta. „ ^- j Cardiac GANGLiON.-This was first mentioned by Wrisberg, who described it as lying between the con- cavity of the arch of the aorta and right pu monary artery; it is formed, according to the same author, bySYMPATHETIC NERVES. 729 communicating filaments of tlie right and left cardiac nerves, with twigs from the pneumogastric. It must, however, be confessed that the most careful dissection will sometimes fail in discovering it. Cardiac Plexus Formed in a great measure by the middle and inferior cardiac, but likewise receiving some filaments from the superior, and usually display- ing a ganglionic enlargement at its formation; it rests upon the front of the trachea, immediately behind the transverse portion of the arch of the aorta, and above the right pulmonary artery. The distribution of those nerves to the heart and great vessels may be more clearly understood by divid- ing them into three sets, namely,—an anterior, middle, and posterior. The Anterior Division is very small, although it receives the filaments from the ganglion of Wrisberg, when present; it passes downwards, and to the right side of the arch of the aorta, reaches the right coronary artery, and there forms a plexus, which is situated on the upper part of the right ventricle, the branches of which are distributed to the walls of that cavity. The Middle Division is that portion usually known as the great cardiac plexus of Haller; it is very large, and some of its branches present ganglionic enlarge- ments. Its position has been already alluded to as lying between the transverse portion of the arch of the aorta and trachea, above the right pulmonary artery. It unites with the— Posterior Division, which rests in the bifurca- tion of the trachea, beneath the right pulmonary ar- tery, below which and on the front of the auricles it joins the middle division, throwing off branches to sup- ply the walls of those cavities, whire others, larger in size, course through the auriculo-ventricular grooves, forming the anterior and posterior coronary plexuses, for the supply of the ventricular portions of the heart. Thoracic Ganglia.—The sympathetic in this cavity consists of a long knotted cord at each side of the bo- dies of the vertebras, the ganglions which it presents twelve in number, being nothing more than fusiforni dilatations on it as it descends, being always connected 2 1 3730 NERVOUS SYSTEM. together by neurine of analogous character to the cord itself. These ganglia are situated on the head of each corresponding rib, and intercostal artery and vein, and are covered by the pleura and subjacent fibrous tissue. The branches which they throw off may be divided into external and internal. External Branches.—These are filaments of com- munication from each ganglion to each corresponding dorsal nerve; they are always two in number, one springing from its external angle, and the second from its deep surface, _ Internal Branches.—These may be divided into thoracic and abdominal; the former being distributed by several fine filaments to the aorta, to the pulmonary and cardiac plexuses, and, according to one very high au- thority, to the bodies of the vertebras, while the latter consist of the greater and lesser splanchnic nerves. Greater Splanchnic Nerve arises generally from the sixth ganglion, but it may come ofi" higher up; the cord which it forms receives in succession filaments from the seventh, eighth, ninth, and tenth, which join it_ at a very acute angle, increasing its size. On reachmg the lower part of the thorax, it becomes flattened, and, piercing the crura of the diaphragm, it enters the abdo- men, where it expands into two ganglionic bodies,— the semilunar, the convexities of which are turned downwards and outwards, are serrated, giving off nu- merous branches from each tooth-like process; the con- cavity upwards and inwards, from which likewise numerous branches are thrown off, presenting several minute ganglia, surrounding completely the ca3liac axis, and constituting the solar plexus. Each semilunar ganglion rests on its corresponding crus, and is partially overlapped by the suprarenal capsules, which, however, are a little external to them, the vena cava covering the rio-ht, while the solar plexus is supported by the abdo- mTnal aorta, and has in front of it the ascendmg layer of the transverse mesocolon ; it receives filaments Iroin the ri<Tht pneumogastric, occasionally also some Irom the plu-enic, and it has a quantity of loose areolar tissue, minc^led up in its formation with numerous small lym- phatic glands. The plexuses which are derived from731 SYMPATHETIC NERVES. it are:—1. Diaphragmatic, which accompany the phre- nic arteries for the supply of that muscle, the right plexus being always larger than the lefc. 2. Capsular, comparatively large, for the supply of the suprarenal capsules. 3. Hepatic, consisting of two distinct plex- uses, one anterior, accompanying the artery, the other posterior, following the vena porta, for the supply of the liver; they also send a number of twigs to the gall- bladder. 4. Splenic, comparatively small for that organ. 5. Coronary, for the stomach, principally to its upper curvature. 6. Eenal, which unite with the lesser splanc- nic, presently to be described, for the kidney and sper- matic cord, and ovaries in the female. 7. Superior me- senteric, which accompanies the artery of the same name, for the supply of the small intestine, and right portion of the large. 8. Inferior mesenteric: it likewise follows its corresponding artery, and is distributed with it to the remaining part of the large intestines commu- nicating in the pelvis with the hypogastric. Lesser Spl.^nchnic Nerve arises from the tenth and eleventh dorsal ganglia, and forms a small cord, which perforates the outer edge of the crus of the diaphragm, and, passing downwards to the hylus of the kidney, unites with branches of the greater,' constituting the re- nal plexus, for the supply of the kidney and testicles in the male, and the ovaries in the female. Lumbar Ganglions.—These are five in number, and generally of a fusiform shape, but the superior espe- cially are occasionally so blended together that it is im- possible to assign any particular figure to them. They are connected to each other by slendercord-likebranches, sometimes double, forming a chain on either side of the vertebral column internal to the origin of the psoas. The branches which they give oiT may be divided into external and internal. External branches pass down- wards and outwards in company with the lumbar arte- ries, between the loops of origin of the psoas, to join the lumbar plexus in the body of that muscle; there is, how- ever, great want of uniformity in their arrangement, as several twigs may pass oft" from the ganglion above, and none from that below. Internal Branches.—Exceedingly numerous, whicliNERVOUS SYSTEM. 732 spread out on tlie aorta, forming around it a complicated plexus interspersed with numerous ganglia; it gives off several filaments to the plexuses derived from the solar as well as to the hypogastric, to which allusion will presently be made. Sacral Ganglia.—Always irregular as to number, varying from three to five; they lie along each side of the sacrum, over the anterior sacral foramina, and covered by peritoneum and loose areolar tissue; com- municating above with the last lumbar by a cord which is generally multiple, and below, those of opposite sides uniting in an arch, convex downward, on which a fu- siform dilatation is often present (ganglion impar). Its branches consist of external, internal, and anterior. _ External Branches.—Filaments of communication to the nerves of the sacral plexus. Internal Branches unite with each other on the front of the sacrum, forming a plexus around the middle sacral artery. Anterior Branches unite with those of the lumbar ganglia, with the mesenteric plexus, and with those of the vesical and hsemorrhoidal in the male, and with the uterine and vaginal in the female, the four last being from the sacral plexus,—the complicated network formed by all these constituting the hypogastric plexus, which lies on the sides of the bladder and rectum, trom which smaller plexuses are derived,—viz. the vesical, hajinor- rhoidal, uterine, and vaginal, for the supply of those organs. ORGANS OF special SENSE. The special senses are five in number, namely,— Touch, Sight, Hearing, Smelling, and Taste. The three former will be described in the present section with the skin, eye, and ear; but the two latter have been already examined with the Anatomy of the Nose, page 130, and with the Tongue, page 287. THE SKIN. The skin, or tegumentary covering of the body, is a compound of an epithelial surface layer, supported on aTHE SKIN, 733 basement membrane, and united to the subjacent parts by areolar tissue. We will first examine the anatomi- cal elements of the integument, and then describe its function and peculiarities, taking them in the following order:—Ciiticle, rete mucosum, corpus papillare, and the cutis vera or dermis,—these constituents being ana- logous to those of the mucous membrane, the two tissues being continuous at the great outlets of the body. Cuticle—This horny layer of the integument forms a continuous covering for the sensitive surface of the subjacent cutis, and consists of scales which, overlap- ping each other, produce intervening ridges, following a waving or concentric disposition, particularly well marked at the extremities of the fingers. When mi- nutely examined with a lens, funnel-shaped apertures are observed on these ridges, indicating the orifices of the sudoriferous glands and sebaceous follicles, together with the apertures through which the hairs are evolved. The surface may also be observed divided into small square or lozenge-shaped elevated spaces, in consequence of the projection of the papillaj of the cutis. When a portion of the cuticle is raised by maceration, the deep surface appears soft, and impressed by the papilla;, with elongated processes which sink into the hair follicles, sudoriferous and sebaceous glands, and if a portion is scraped off it will be found to consist of cells containing pigment granules, as if they were the scales of the cuti- cle in an immature condition. The cuticle is composed of albumen, and differs re- markably in density in different parts of the body; thus, on the palms of the hands and soles of the feet, glutseal region, scalp, and back, it is thick; whilst on the face, eyelids, penis, points of the fingers, and front of the body generally, it is fine and comparatively smooth. Neither nerves nor vessels have been traced into its structure, which is therefore; like the nails and hair, without orga- nization. Breschet conceived that special glands, of a reddish colour, and exceedingly small, situated in the subcutaneous fatty tissue, secreted the cuticle; but such glands are not present, and it is more just to look on it as a, cell growth evolved by the superficial surface of the cutis; and, in conformity with this view, we find that the734 NERVOUS SYSTEM. deep surface of the cuticle consists of granular cells, and the nearer the superficial aspect is approached the more the cell character disappears, being replaced by scales which still present a trace of their former nuclei. Rete Mucosum consists of immature epidermic cor- puscles, containing iron or carbon, phosphate of lime, and animal matter, as pigment granules. This layer is black in the negro, and of a fawn colour in the European, being well marked in the latter in the perineum, scro- tum, neighbourhood of the anus, and around the nipple of the pregnant female. Breschet also conceived that there were special glands for the secretion of this struc- ture situated in the cutis vera. Cutis Vera consists of an elastic membranous layer, having two surfaces,—the superficial being irregular, but smooth, constituting the papillary layer; Avhilst the deeper portion is dense, where it approaches the surface, but becoming lax inferiorly, and blended by irregular prolongations with the subcutaneous areolar tissue. The'^'ACTiLE Papillary Layer exists on the whole external surface of the cutis; but the number and size of the papillae predominate in those situations where tac- tile sensibility is at its maximum,—for example, at the extremities of the fingers, on the tongue, palm of the hand, and soles of the feet, being usually developed in an inverse ratio to the thickness of the subjacent cutis. The surface presents furrows which pursue various di- rections, separated by intervening ridges, which may be curved tortuous, or concentric, indicatmg the disposi- tion of the tactile organ. The ridges result from a sin- gle or double row of conical processes or papilhe, which proiect from the surface of the cutis, the papillffi bemg arranged in pairs; shallow surface grooves indicating the spaces between them, and passing transversely to tho long axis of the ridges; whilst in the centre of the linear elevation a dark point indicates the opening of the sudo- riferous duct. The papillfe are often of unequal size m the same ridge, but their average length is about Tooth of an inch, and the diameter at the base about ^^^th. Their outline is well defined when viewed with a power of 500, and they appear semitransparent, flexible, and, if not very forcibly bent, returning to their former po-735 THE SEIN. sition, signifying a certain amount of elastic property, although apparently homogeneous. A vertical set of lines seem to imply a fibrous organization, Avhich, with two or three capillary loops, and a single nervous loop (Gerber), completes the structure of the papilla. Messrs. Todd and Bowman, in their " Physiology of Man," state, that they have not been able to detect the nervous loops, but have seen a single tubule entering the papilla, and then becoming lost to view. (See p. 412 of the above work, which is equally explicit and simple on the skin as on all other parts of structural anatomy.) Choeion.—This term has been applied to that portion of the cutis lying beneath the papillary layer. It is soft, flexible, and elastic, consisting of white andyelloAV fibrous tissue; the latter predominating where elasticity prevails, and the former where resistance and fixedness are requisite, as in the palms of the hands and soles of the feet. This layer is thickest on the back and sides of the body and the scalp, but fine over the flexures of joints, and thin, but dense, on the palms of the hands and soles of the feet; its deep surface being rongh and fila- mentous in all situations, and attached to the subjacent areolar tissue. It is composed of gelatine, Avhich may be extracted by boiling, whilst maceration in solutions containing tannic acid converts it into leather. Appendages of the Skin.—These consist of the su- doriferous and sebaceous glands, the hairs, and nails. Sudoriferous Glands are of a follicular type, one ex- tremity lying in the subcutaneous areolar tissue, and the second free. Each gland consists of a single tube which is closed at the deep extremity, and in1;ricately coiled on Itself, so as to form a small round mass from which the efferent tube passes in a tortuous course through the cutis until it arrives at the papilla?, where It becomes straight, and then closely spiral as it pierces the cuticle, terminating by an expanded orifice Each tube, the cavity of which is about t-^V* of an inch in diameter, possesses an external basement layer, which becomes continuous with the papilla; and a lining of epithelium derived from the cuticle. _ These glands are situated in the subcutaneous areolar tissue, and their number is in proportion to the amount736 NERVOUS SYSTEM. of sweat secreted by the part, being most numerous in the axilla, perineum, and folds of the nates, but they are still present on every part of the surface. Sebaceous Glands.—Also follicular, consisting of a mere tube, occasionally branched, which becomes pouched or convoluted in the substance of the cutis, sometimes projecting into the areolar tissue, whilst the efferent tube either opens into the hair follicle or on the free surface. They are most numerous on the face, scro- tum, and perineum, whilst they are absent on the palms of the hands and soles of the feet. The coats of the ducts are similar to, but finer than, those of the sudorife- rous glands, and within them may be usually found the peculiar parasite known as the entozoon folliculorum; their use is to secrete an oleaginous fluid which lubri- cates the surface of the skin. _ _ Hairs. This superficial appendage to the skm is strewed over the whole surface, with a few exceptions; -whilst in some localities it is concentrated so as to form a covering more or less thick in situations so obvious that we do not conceive it necessary to mention them. A hair consists of a root and stem; the latter are elon- gated and more or less cylindrical evolutions of the cu- ticle; but they differ from a cylinder in being laterally compressed or reniform;and they arc also thicker at the iunction of the middle and inferior third, and sometimes split at the extremity. They differ in size m many parts of the body,—the hairs of the head being the longest those on the general surface the finest (lanugo), and those of the pubis, whiskers, chin, and axilla, the strongest. . , . , • . The Hair-Bulb is that expanded portion which is set in the follicle, about twice the diameter of the hair it- self and sometimes excavated at its base; this portion is contained in the hair follicle, which is a depression m the dermis, extending deeper into the areolar tissue than either the sudoriferous glands or sebaceous loUicles, and isformed by an invagination of the cuticle; but between this and the root a cavity exists, into which the seba- ceous follicles open, and in which entozoa are frequently generated. The shaft of the hair consists,-first, o a scabrous coat, continuous with the cuticle, the scales737 THE SKIN. overlapping from the fixed to the free extremity; and internal to this a fibrous stratum, and in the centre a medullary or cell structure; the latter containing the colouring matter, which is deficient in the albino, in black, red, and yellow hair, being composed respectively of peroxide of manganese, oxide of iron, and sulphur. The Use of the Hair On the head it is esteemed as an ornament, on the cheeks and face it gives character and expression, whilst on the pubis and genitals it serves the purpose of concealment (Hassal). The Nails are twenty in number, and rest on the posterior surface of the distal extremity of each finger and toe. Each nail is convex from side to side, and also in the antero-posterior direction, the posterior and the lateral margins being imbedded in a groove in the der- mis, whilst the nail itself is merely a continuation of the scaly cuticle. The superficial surface is smooth, but li- near, in consequence of the formative cells being ar- ranged in rows from before backwards; and if the nail is torn from the matrix, nucleated cells containing pig- ment gran\iles Avill be seen on its deep surface; at the posterior extremity a white semilunar space exists; this is named the lanula, beneath which the matrix is not as vascular as in other situations. The matrix is highly organized, and studded with papillas, which are linear from before backwards. The nail grows in two direc- tions,—first, from behind, by the constant evolution of new cells; and secondly, by the deep surface; the pa- pillte producing new laminaj beneath, as frequently observed in diseased toe nails. When the nail is de- stroyed, it is always regenerated, and the whole extent would probably be developed in three months, it being computed tliat it would grow ^^th of an inch each week. 'Jlie skin is of use in conferring symmetry on the body, preventing too rapid evaporation, and defending the subjacent parts from injury by acting as a sentinel. The functions of exhalation, absorption, with the sense of touch, have likewise their seat in this tissue.NERVOUS SYSTEM. 738 THE ORBIT. In order to dissect this region turn the subject on the face, raised to a convenient height by a block placed beneath the chest; let a second block, with an excava- tion superiorly, be fixed beneath the chin, so as to re- tain the skull in an almost erect position, and make a saw-cut through the roof of the orbit, about a line and a half external to the internal angular process of the OS frontis, and let a second be carried through the ex- ternal angular process of the same bone, both converg- ing behind to meet at the sphenoidal fissure; but the ring of bone bounding the optic foramen above may be left entire by running the saw lightly across, about two lines anterior to the anterior clinoid process, when a few light blows of a hammer will now throw the bone forward. The orbit contains the globe of the eye, rauscles, nerves, arteries, lachrymal gland, absorbents, veins, and a quantity of soft adeps, which, occupying the interstices between the muscles, forms a soft and yielding cushion for the support of the globe, diminishing, however, in old age and all emaciating diseases, a circumstance indi- cated by the recession of the eye within the orbit. When the bone has been removed, the periosteal membrane may be observed. Periosteum. This dense white fibrous membrane is a continuation of the dura mater, entering the orbit by the foramen opticum and the sphenoidal fissure, but differs from that structure in being weaker and less - intimately adherent to the bone. It lines the whole internal surface of the orbit, and, passing forwards to the rim of the cavity, becomes continuous with the broad palpebral ligament, being nnich stronger posteriorly and internally than antoriorly and externally; and as the optic nerve enters it sends forwards a process around it to become attached to the sclerotic coat, whilst sujie- riorly and externally it splits to inclose the lachrymal gland, the outline of which is now visible, as well as a horizontal groove running from before backwards, cor- responding to the frontal nerve. Now raise the penes-739 THE ORBIT. teum, and the following parts are brought into view from without inwards:—Lachrymal gland, nerve, and artery, lying on the upper edge of the external rectus muscle; and internal to this, a latty interval, wider be- fore than behind; still more internally, the frontal nerve and its supratrochleator branch, lying on the levator palpebra?, and on the outer side of the latter a small portion of the superior rectus muscle is seen ; internal to the parts enumerated, a second fatty interval occurs, crossed in front by the supra and infratrochleator nerves; and lastly, at the innermost part of the cavity, the supe- rior oblique muscle, with the fourth nerve lying on its orbital aspect near its back part, is observed. The stu- dent should turn to the description of the cerebral nerves, and may now examine the frontal, lachrymal, and fourth,' and subsequently the muscles as they appear. _ Lachrymal Gland—This conglomerate gland con- sists of two portions, one large, occupyino; a fossa in the external angular process of the frontarbone (orbital portion); the second smaller, which is situated between the conjunctiva and the upper lid (palpebral portion). The orbital portion is transversely oval and extremely variable in size, but usually equalling one-half of a hazel nut, correspoDdiug above to the bone, a layer of perios- teum, and filaments of the lachrymal nerve; inferiorly and internally to the external rectus and the globe of the eye, and anteriorly to the superior palpebral lijrament, so that It projects through the upper eyelid when enlarged, whilst posteriorly it corresponds to the lachrymal vessels and nerve. The palpebral portion is usually caudate and flat, being granular or finely lobulated in its struc- ture, with a dense process of the periosteum investing us surlace and sending processes into its tissue, in fact entirely enclosing it, this prolonged portion of the gland resting on the superior rectus, levator palpebral, and upper eyelid. The ducts of the gland, about from twelve to sixteen in number, open on the superior palpebral sinus, pouring tlieir contents over the free surlace of the globe of the eye (see page 232). Levator PALPEBRyE Superioris Triangular in fi- gure, apex behind, and the base anteriorly; arises from the upper margin of the optic foramen, and the frontalNERVOUS SYSTEM. 740 bone in front of tliat opening; becoming wide andflesby, it passes forwards and outwards, and behind the edge of the orbit forms an aponeurotic layer, which, curv- ■ ing downwards, is inserted into the superior margin of the tarsal cartilage, being continued downwards on the posterior surface to its ciliary edge (Sir P. Crampton), and also into the superior palpebral sinus on the deep surface of the palpebral ligament. Relations It is covered by the periosteum, the fourth and frontal nerves, with its supratrochleator branch, also by the upper lid, and it lies on the superior rectus, superior division of the third and ocular fascia. Action.—To elevate the superior eyelid, and by ad- mitting the advance of the globe to depress the lower lid. Sir P. Crampton considered tonic contraction of this muscle to be the usual cauoe of entropium, and on this opinion his peculiar operation for that disease is founded. Now cut the muscle, and reflect its portions forwards and backwards, and examine the— Superior Oblique.—Situated at the internal part of the orbit, being tendinous behind and before, and fleshy in the centre; it arises from the superior and internal part of the optic foramen, and, forming a fusiform fleshy belly, it runs forwards parallel to the os planum of the ethmoid bone, and, having reached the internal canthus, forms a round tendon which plays through a fibro-car- tilaginous, sometimes osseous, pulley, at the inner angle of the frontal bone, from which it is separated by a bursa; then expanding, it turns downwards, backwards, and outwards, between the superior rectus and the globe, and, having pierced the ocular fascia, is inserted by a silvery tendon into the sclerotic coat, between the ex- ternal and superior recti. _ Rdatiom.^lt is covered by the periosteum, lourtli and supratrochleator nerves, with the superior rectus, and it lies on the internal rectus, nasal nerve, ocular fascia, and the sclerotic coat; as the tendon pierces the ocular fascia a process of that membrane is prolonged on it towards the trochlea, whilst a much finer tubule is sent on the ocular part of the tendon. The Recti Muscles are four in number, situated in the long axis of the orbit:—one being above, attollens;741 THE ORBIT. the second below, depressor; the third internal, adduc- tor; and the fourth external, abductor oculi. Eectus Stj-pEEioR, vel Attollens Oculi Tendinous anteriorly and posteriorly, fleshy in the centre; it arises from the upper part of the optic foramen, also from the crest separating that opening from the sphenoidal fissure, as well as from the sheath of the optic nerve, then, becoming fleshy, it passes upwards, forwards, and a little outwards, above the optic nerve and globe of the eye, and about half-an-inch behind the cornea forms a silvery tendon, three lines in width, which pierces the ocular fascia by a prolonged aperture, separated from the mar- gin of the opening by a fine membranous tissue like a bursal structure, and then is inserted into the sclerotic coat about four lines behind the cornea. Relations.—It is covered by the levator palpebrs, one branch of the superior division of the third, and at its insertion by the ocular fascia; and it lies on the optic nerve, superior division of the third and nasal, ciliary nerves, ophthalmic artery, ocular fascia, and the scle- rotic coat. Now divide the superior rectus and reflect its two portions, one backwards, and the other forwards, and act similarly with respect to the superior oblique^ when the following parts are seen as the second layer: —Internal rectus, the proper nasal, and infratrochlea- tor, lying on it; external to this a fatty interval, crossed by the nasal nerve; then the optic, crossed above by the superior division of the third and nasal; and on the outer side of the last the lenticular ganglion with its roots; and lastly, the external rectus, whilst the globe of the eye is still obscured by the ocular fascia, which structure may now be examined. Ocular Fascia, or Tunica Vaginalis Oculi, which has been successively described by Tenon, Dalrymple, Malgaigne, and O'Ferrall, is a very distinct structure' forming a sheath or capsule for the globe, posteriorly being a continuation of the dura mater surrounding the optic nerve, and passing forwards to be attached to the orbital margins of the tarsal cartilages, being con- sequently conical in shape, the base in front, the apex behind; tough, fibrous, and laminated, it presents for description an external and internal surface, the formerNERVOUS SYSTEM, 742 supporting the muscles which surround the globe, and presenting six perforations, by which they enter to reach the sclerotic, namely,—four for the recti, and two for the oblique muscles; but from the margins of the apertures a tubule is sent back on each, forming a complete sheath for the recti and inferior oblique, whilst on the supe- rior oblique it passes only as far as the trochlea; it is likewise perforated by the optic and ciliary nerves, as well as the ciliary vessels. If a tenaculum is introduced into its surface, layer after layer may be raised, which are united to each other by fine areolar tissue, and when divided longitudinally its thickness will be observed to vary, being much stronger before, but more loosely con- nected to the contained eyeball in this situation. On drawing the divided margins asunder the internal per- forations for the muscles are seen, each tendon being surrounded by a fine glistening membrane, difFermg altogether from the structure of the vaginal tunic, whilst small thread-like filaments pass from the internal aspect of the capsule to the sclerotic, the surface ot the latter being smooth, polished, and shining like to a se- rous tunic. Although probably premature, we may here state our opinion, that we believe the tunica vaginalis to consist of two layers, namely,—tunica fibrosa and serosa, the latter being a distinct serous sac resembling the arachnoid membrane, of which there are anatomical and physiological proofs, but which we reserve for the present. , This membrane prevents the pressure ot the sur- rounding muscles on the eye, likewise keeping the globe in contact with the lids; it also, according to Dr. U l-er- rall, alters the action of the recti by preventing their retracting the eye within the orbit, and making them act as if they arose from points of the orbit opposite their insertions; but the capsule, with its smooth and polished surface, in fact allows the globe to perform its short rotatory movement with greater ease and rapidity than if the organ moved on the fat at the back of the ''''External Rectus or Abductor lies on the outer wall of the orbit, and arises tendinous from the ligament of Zinn and the ridge separating the optic foramen fromTHE ORBIT.

The globe of the eye is situated in the anterior part of the orbit, hxed m its situation by the optic nerve and the muscles which surround it, and retained in con- tact with the hds by the ocular fascia and the conjunc- tiva which last covers and adheres to about the anterior hird of the _ eyeball.

In the anterior part of the same structure fourteen or sixteen triangular plates sur- rounding the corneal aperture, occur, well marked m birds, but although present in reptiles they are more irrefTular; not so, however, in the ophidia as they are almost as well marked in that class as in the bird tribe. Structure of the Sclerotic.-lt is composed of white fibrous tissue, with a small amount of the yellow elastic form, the bands crossing each other at right angles, inclosing oval interfibrous spaces, most nume- rous posteriorly. The vessels which supply this part are derived from the palpebral branches ot the ophthal- mic, together with the ciliary vessels; but nerves have not been seen to terminate in it, while the absorbents are very numerous. , , i i Bdations.-^xtern^Wy it is covered by the ocular fascia receiving also the insertions of the recti and ob- ique whilst internally it corresponds to the ciliary vessels and nerves, which, entering it by a series of per- forations at its posterior part, separate it ^h^ choroid coat.

The conjunctival layer adheres very mtimately to the elastic tissue lyin. beneath It, which here constitutes the basement mem^ brane, the only element of the conjunctiva which is truly prolonged over the cornea being the epithelium, lhat there is a continuity of the sclerotic and corneal conjunctiva is proved by the fact, that in reptiles which cas off the skin annually the whole conjunctiva desqua- mates at the same period, the animal bein<? blind for a certain time, and likewise, when the eye is subiected to maceration, the entire layer can be torn off. The disease named pterygium raises the sclerotic conjunctiva, and when tu ly formed impinges on the cornea elevatmo- its mucous layer also from the elastic. This latter, named the anterior elastic cornea, consists of a transparent lamina of elastic tissue, perfectly homogeneous in its nature, covering the superficial surface of the cornea propria, and sending filaments deeply into its structure as well as from the margins into the sclerotic, as deep as the_ ciliary ligament, its use being to preserve thl requisite sphericity of the anterior f^ce of the cornea Ihe cornea propria consists of a peculiar modification of the white fibrous tissue expanded into a membranous form and constituting laminae from sixty to seventvTn number, united to each by filaments of LimilaTstTuc ture, forming areolae, differing from those of the sc^e rotic in being tubular, and crossing each other at acute V communication between the n These tubules have membranous walls, perfectlv trans" parent, their cavities being merely damped ly ZiZe but never m the normal condition containin;^ fluid and by the action of acetic acid nuclei become eviden 'as in the fibrous tissues of other situations.

When de- tached it curls up and does not fall flaccid or float loosely in water, as other delicate membranes; it also presents a peculiar sparkling appearance in water, depending on its greater refractive power; in fact, it presents all the characters of cartilage, and is evidently of the same na- ture as the capsule of the crystalline lens. —(Article, Eye, in Todd's Encyclopedia, p. 179-) When sloughmg or ulceration extends so deep as to reach this membrane, a pellucid prominence presses forwards into the opening; and when an opacity results after puncture it resembles in appearance capsular cataract; but its structure is very different from cartilage, being composed of elastic tissue with scarcely a visible character, not affected by acids as the ordinary fibrous tissues; the use of this layer being to preserve the requisite concavity of the po'sterior Lface of the cornea. The cornea becomes opaque if the globe is subjected to compression, and this has been attributed to the expression of the fluid ou of its areolar structure, and again to an oPP^f Jj^"; namely, the expression of a larger — ^/f.-^/^^^ the anterior chamber into its areola; but if a small lamina raised by a needle is subjected to pressure it rewise becomes opaque, proving that the opacity de- pends on a derangement of its intimate structure The Membrane of the Veous humour, which lines its pos- Srior aspect is merely epithelial in its character.

The venous layer, when well injected, presents a very beautitul appear- ance, these vessels running in whorls from before back- wards, and terminating in from five to seven emissory trunks, which, piercing the sclerotic coat, terramatem the ophthalmic vein. The middle layer, or tumca Ruy- schiana, is formed by the ramifications of the short ciliary arteries, whilst the membrana pigmenti consists o_t a layer of hexagonal plates of epithelium, containing pig- ment granules, composed of carbon or the oxide ot iron. On tracing the choroid coat forwards, it becomes conti- nuous with the corpus ciliare, which may be considered as being made up of the ciliary processes and ligament, with the superadded ciliary muscle. Ciliary PRocESSES.-These may be thus exposed .- After having removed the sclerotic, cut off the posterior half of the choroid and vitreous body with a scissors, and place the eye resting on the cornea on a white p ate with a little water; they will then be seen about sixty Tn number, alternately long ^^-^S^^^^^'/.'^at of plications or foldings inwards of the choroid coat each ciliary process being triangular, the base m front turned inwards and forwards, attached to the posterior surface of the iris (iridian border), the apex directed backwards and outwards, which, with the external sur- face, is continuous with the choroid, ^vhile internally they impress the surface of the vitreous body around the knsf constituting the corona ciliaris, or zonule of Z nn-, they likewise'surround the margin of the lens Tepar'atedLn it by the canal of f tit alsofoi^g th rlrcumference of the posterior chamber.

But it haviu^ been observed that all the nerves which perforate did not emerge again, it was supposed from this lact, as well as from its colour, to resemble a ganglion. _ Now proceed to examine the ciliary muscle by rais- ing a portion of the sclerotic coat as far as the margin of the cornea. It appears as a greyish semi-transparent . structure, situated behind the ciliary ligament, and ex- ternal to the ciliary processes, consisting of a series of unstriped radiating fibres, arising from the ciliary liga- ment, and passing backwards to be inserted into the cihary processes under cover of the sclerotic. This muscle, which was described by Porterfield, will ad- vance the ciliary processes and the lens,—a structure somewhat similar existing in birds, which was described by bir Philip Crampton, but the fibres are striped. General Eeviarks on the Choroid Coat This mem- brane is exceedingly vascular, but does not exhibit the same tinge in all animals, being silvery in the perch, jet-black in the shark, and in the eyes of herbivora, as well as m the felmae, presenting at its posterior part a ustrous greenish layer of a fibrous texture, the epithe- lium on Its surface being destitute of pigment gra- nules as in albinos. This tapetum lucidum reflects the rays ot ight a second time on the retina, particularly where they are weak. In osseous fishes a small, reddish, glandular mass is found at the posterior part of the choroid, covered by silvery grey membrane,—the cho- roid gland, the use of which is unknown; and in birds a plicated vascular process passes forwards in the vi- treous humour so far as nearly to touch the lens, which as called the pecten. The use of the choroid coat is to preserve the cavity of the globe as a dark chamber and absorb the superfluous rays of \wht. The Ikis is a circular fold ofmemijrane, with an aper- ture (the pupil) a little nearer the nasal than the tem- poral margin; floating in the aqueous humour, andNERVOUS SYSTEM. 752 forming an imperfect septum between the anterior and posterior chambers, it presents two margins,—the ex- ternal or ciliary, which is thick, receiving fibres from the cornea elastica anterior, and is attached to the cili- ary ligament; the second or papillary edge surrounds the pupil, and is thin and well defined. The anterior surface presents a striated aspect, numerous fibres con- verging from the external to within ^\th. of an inch of the pupil, where they terminate in a circular set of ■ knotted and much thicker elevations, from which again branching filaments pass inwards to the verge of the pupil; the posterior surface is dark, being tinged by the pigmentum nigrum, constituting the uvea, whilst , the external third of the posterior surface lies in con- tact with the ciliary processes. The structure of the iris consists of the arched branches of the long ciliary arteries with the ciliary nerves; and so great is its vas- cularity that some authorities consider its structure to be erectile. The principal fibres composing it run from the ciliary towards the pupillary edge, whilst near the latter a fasciculus of circular fibres may also "be de- tected, these last being very apparent in birds, and of the striped variety of muscular structure, but m man undoubtedly unstriped. Now it has been supposed that the radiating fibres are merely elastic, whilst the circular are muscular,—belladonna acting by paralyzing the circular set, whilst the elastic, still preserving intact their physical property, dilate the pupil. But although these fibres are evidently unstriped, still, pathologically they are allied to the voluntary muscles; lor in coma, which paralyzes only the latter, the pupil is unitormly di- lated. Although motor filaments derived from the motor oculi can be traced to the iris, still the mechanical stimuli which excite muscular contraction fail to produce that effect in the pupil which is sometimes evidenced during the operation for cataract; for when the needle acci- dentally pierces the iris it remains perfectly quies- cent, and it is only by acting on the retina that con- tractions can be induced. The iris is immovable in fishes, and of a green colour, the pupil being angular, while in the horse a thin membrane exists, which passes across the pupil like a curtain, giving it an opalineTHE EYE. blueness, although, when raised, the aperture is dark. I he use of the ins is to regulate the amount of li^ht which impniges on the retina, also averting the aberra- tion of sphericity by intercepting the marginal rays Membrana Pupillaris consists of a thin semi- transparent membrane thrown across the pupil in foetal ife, into which the vessels of the iris enter, formin<. loops which do not touch in the centre (Cloquet), and IS usually ruptured about the seventh month of intra- uterine life; but, according to Dr. Jacob, a portion al- ways remains up to the ninth month, and traces of its existence can be discovered a fortnight after birth. Wr sberg, B umenbach, and Cloquet, account for its rupture by the retraction of the loops of the blood-ves- sels which enter it; but, according to Dr. Jacob the first step IS diminished vascularity; and secondly', ab- sorption, the use of this membrane being to preserve oflheTii!'

On removing the, sclerotic and choroid coats under water from a perfectly fresh human eye the external layer is exposed, or the serous tunic, of which Dr. Jacob gives the following de- scription, he being the first anatomist who directed at- tention to this structure:-" If the exposed surface be now carefully examined, an experienced eye may per- ceive that this is not the appearance usually presented by the retina; instead of the blue, white, reticulated surface of that membrane, a uniform villous structure, more or less tinged by black pigment, presents itself. If the extremity of the ivory handle of a dissecting-kmte be pushed against this surface, a breach is made in it and a membrane of great delicacy may be separated and turned down in folds over the choroid coat, presentmg the most beautiful specimen of a delicate tissue which Te human body affords. If a small opening be made m t e membrane, and the blunt end of a probe introduced beneX it may be separated throughout without being turned down, Remaining loose over the retina. If a few drop of acid be added to the water after the membrane has been separated it becomes opaque and much firmer, and may thus be preserved for several days even with- out beTng immersed in spirit. The extent and con- nexions of this are sufficiently explained by saymg that U Svers the retina from the entrance of the optic nerve to the ciliary processes"-(Todd's Encyclopedia, Article Eve P iser He also remarks, that it is exceeding y deb^ate in the infant, firmer in the adult, and stained bv S pigBient of the choroid; and it presents the same characters in all classes of mammalia, whilst m birds t is ^^rrictyellow colour -d jii ^^^s ^^^^^^^^^^^ Sse brdtsshow a^endency^o separation when im- ^'ertdTn water, and then seem ^-t at their ™ Tliis membrane forms the connecting link '^ct^^een in 'e a and epithelial layer of tlie choroid, and it corre- sponds to the bacillous layer of Wagnei.THE EYE. 755 The Nervous Tunic consists of three strata, the most internal being a fibrous grey layer, formed by the tubu- lar fibres of the optic nerve, deprived of the white sub- stance of Schwann; it is fused into a continuous mem- brane, and passes over the entrance of the optic nerve; a point insensible to the influence of light, peculiar in being the only element of the retina prolonged over that pomt, which is situated one-eighth of an inch internal to the axis of vision; the second layer, lying external to the last, consists of ganglionic cells (tunica cellulosa of Wagner), which form a much thicker stratum behind than before; and immediately external to the last, a thin granular stratum exists in immediate contact with the membrana Jacobi. Vascular Later of the Retina is formed by the arteria centralis retinse, which, entering through the centre of the optic nerve, presenting a dark spot on the retma,—porus opticus, and then dividing into capilla- ries, forms the vascular layer. By making a transverse section of the globe, in its posterior part, exactly in the axis ol vision, the punctum aureum of Soemerring is observed. This point is about ^\th of an inch in dia- meter, and appears as a depression in the retina, sur- rounded by a yellow margin; it is the most sensitive part of the whole surface, and exhibits the most dis- tinct image, but although uniformly present in man, still Its existence in other animals is extremely limited' being confined to the quadrumana and a few reptiles as described by Dr. Knox. The retina is the seat of visual impressions, and being pale, bluish and semitranspa- rent, images painted on it can be seen when the sclerotic and choroid coats have been removed. Vitreous Body.—This semifluid mass occupies the posterior four-fifths of the globe, bounded posteriorly and laterally by the retina, and anteriorly by the ciliary processes and the lens, which latter is buried in a con- cavity on Its anterior surface. Its capsule is named the hyaloid membrane, which is a structure of extreme delicacy, surrounding the vitreous fluid at all points and likewise sending sepimenta or partitions into its cavity, dividing it into cells, believed by some to com municate, but the escape of the whole vitreous humour756 NERVOUS SYSTEM. from a single puncture may be accounted for by the fine homogeneous nature of the investing membrane permitting a slow transudation; anteriorly, and sur- rounding the margin of the lens, the surface is marked by a series of plaiting, the impressions of the ciliary processes, these constituting the zonula ciliaris of Zinn, which is dovetailed or intimately united to the similar circle of the choroid coat. At the margin of the lens the hyaloid membrane appears to split, the anterior layer forming the zonule of Zinn, and the pos- terior attached to the capsule of the lens, producing a canal of a triangular shape, bounded before and behind by the hyaloid membrane; internally by the margin of the lens, which forms its base; and externally by the ciliary processes, where the apex is situated; it is named the canal of Petit from the author who first directed attention to its anatomy, and it appears to al- low the ciliary muscle to advance the lens during visual adaptation. The presence of this canal may be shown by injection, when it exhibits a beaded appearance, owing to the ciliary processes impinging on it. In the centre of the vitreous body a canal exists, very apparent in foetal life (canal of Cloquet), through which a branch, the arteria centralis retinse (artery of Zinn), passes to reach the posterior part of the capsule of the lens— however, it ceases to be evident, in the adult, at least, although always easy of detection in the eye of the horse.

The Lens is composed of soluble albumen, and is ex- travascular, neither its growth nor pathological condi- tions appearing to depend on the presence of vessels, at least, carrying red blood. The lens refracts the rays of light towards the per- pendicular to so great an extent that they decussate at its posterior surface, which accounts for the inverted image, but during refraction the danger of chromatic aberration is incurred, this form of aberration occurring where the elements of the light ray are unequally re- fracted, as takes place with an ordinary lens; but this is obviated in the crystalline by its different density at the surface and in the centre; on which account it is called achromatic. It is also observed that light rays passing through the margin of a biconvex ens are re- fracted before those which are transmitted through the centre, which would produce a confused image on the retina, this being termed spherical aberration; but it is however, connected by the iris, preventmg the en- trance of the marginal light rays into the eyes, it a sharp instrument is introduced into the centre of the cornea, and passed from before backwards through the globe, the following parts will be pierced m succession. 1.

This tube is a little more than one inch in length extending from the base of the tragus externally to'^the membranatympani internally, and its direction is not per- fectly horizontal, but directed at first slightly upwards and then forwards and inwards; it is also partially con- stricted inits centre. Its external half is composed of car- tilage, which IS constituted by the bending inwards of the tragus and concha, which are united inferiorly but su- periorly an interval exists between them, which is filled lip by dense fibrous tissue, other fissures hem<y also apparent, but they are variable in number as well as in extent (incisure Santorini); the internal half IS osseous and had no existence in fcetal life, itbeino- at that period a mere bony ring, over which the membrana tympani was tensely stretched, a groove being always apparent in the adult bone, indicating the extent of de- velopment of the osseous portion, which, from the obli- quity of the tympanic membrane, is always longer on its inferior than superior wall. The canal thus formed is Imed mternally by an involution of the integument which IS remarkable for its tenuity and vascularity; its orifice IS protected by numerous strong hairs, springing principally from the roots of the tragus and anti-tragus! while in the subcutaneous tissue, but confined to the carti aginous portion only, are several cerumenous glands for the production of the peculiar secretion con- nltl ^ , ' f loiiring matter, and a substance nearly analogous to bile, which is always poured out rr/h ^rf,^'""'^]' tegumentary surface; its use, as wel a^ that of the hairs, being to entangle any foreign body that might enter the canal, and thus act injuriously oJ the delicate organ of hearing.

The middle ear has been compared, not inaptly, to a common drum, or perhaps more properly, to a tambo- rine, but covered in, not at one, but both extremities It presents for examination an external and internal wall, and a circumference. The external wall is consti- tuted by the membrana tympani, which separates it from the auditory canal; it is nearly circular in shape,— its external surface looking downwards, forwards, and outwards, and is firmly implanted into a fissure or groove, which marks out the position of the tympanic ring in the foetus, but is directed so very obliquely downwards and inwards, that it forms an angle of about 45° with the lower wall of the external auditory meatus. It consists of three layers,—an external or cuticular, which is extremely fine, continuous with the lining ot the tube; an internal mucous, prolonged over it from the cavity of the tympanum; and a middle fibrous, thm, but exceedingly strong; the filaments which compose it appearing to radiate from the centre to the circumte- rence, this latter constituent being described by bir Everard Home as muscular. Taken as a whole, the membrane possesses great strength and vascularity, but is more or less translucent, and is constantly retained in a state of tensity by the tensor tympani muscle, which, acting upon the malleus, the handle of which is attached to its centre, renders it convex on its inner surface, and concave on its outer. _ Internal Wall.—This must be examined by re- moving the membrana tympani, when the following parts will be brought into view :_Most superiorly the le- !iestraovalis;inthe middle, the promontory,with the pro- cess of bone stretching backwards from it to the pyra- inid,-thelingua, or tongue; and still lower and slightly posterior, the fenestra rotunda. The fenestra ovahs is semi-elliptical in shape, concave above, nearly straight bebw, directed forwards and slightly downward situ- ated in a recess of variable depth,-the fossette; it would form a direct communication between the tym- panum and vestibule but for a membrane which is stretched across it in its natural condition, against whichTHE EAE. yg2 the band or foot of the stapes rests. The promontory which hes immediately below the hole last described is an elevated process of bone, corresponding, and indeed formed, by the first turn of the cochlea; it is marked by several small furrows or grooves for the tympanic plexus of Jacobsou the destination of which will be fully con- sidered in the section on that subject. The fenestra ro- tunda, which lies posterior and inferior to the promon- tory, is also situated in a depression or fossette; like the fenestra ovalis, it is likewise closed by a thin membrane (lesser membrana tympani), which separates the tym- panum from the tympanic scala of the cochlea, ov, to al^o into the vestibular cavity, as the foramen is divided mtotwoby thespiral lamina of the cochlea, which exSnds downwards as far as this point but for this membrane The circumference of the tympanum may be examined superiorly, mfenorly, anteriorly, and posteriorly.

These ossi- cula, consisting of the malleus, incus, os orbiculare, and stapedius, we will now proceed to describe m succession. Malleus is the most anterior and external of the ossicula, and, as its name implies, is mallet-shaped. For description it may be divided into ahead, neck, handle, short and long process. The head is of an ovoid shape, lyintr on a plane above the membrana tympani, and is almost completely buried in the sulcus or recess de- scribed as existing in the upper part of the circumte- rence of the tympanic cavity, but below and behind it is slightly concave to articulate with the body of the in- cus; below the head is the neck, which is constricted and slightly flattened; the handle, which passes from this at an obtuse angle, nearly vertically downwards at first, but afterwards curves slightly outwards termi- nates in a rounded point, which is firmly attached to the centre of the fibrous layer of the membrana tympam; its short process springs from the neck,_ and bending outwards, rests against the upper margin ot the tym- panic membrane, causing it to project slightly exter- nally; the long process (processus gracilis of liaw) arises from the same part as the last, and, proceedmg downwards, terminates in a sharp point in the Glasserian fissure, where it afi-ords attachment to the laxator tym- pani, the muscular structure of which has been latterly, and perhaps with much justice, disputed._ Incus —This bone has been compared m shape to an anvil or bicuspid tooth, and presents for examination a body and two processes,_a short and a long. iHe body is irregularly quadrilateral, ^^^.F^ff^^^^^.^^^.^f, behind a facette for articulating with the head of the malleus, and like it is situated above "\tl- -^-^^ the tympanum ; its short process occupies the same situation! and stretches horizontally backwards as lar as the m;stoid cells; it is thick, strong -d -mf ficrure- its long process is much more slender than t e kst i^ dTps nfaSy vertically downwards, parallel, butTHE EAR. Y63 internal, to the handle of the malleus, and at its termina- tion bends almost directly inwards, forming a small cup- like cavity for articulating with the orbicular bone. Orbicular Bone—As its name implies, almost com- pletely spherical, and not larger than a small grain of shot._ It appears to be simply interposed as a connect- ing link between the incus and the following. Stapes—Stirrup-shaped, lying nearly horizontally across the tympanic cavity, and inferior to those already described; it presents for examination a head, neck, two crura, and a base. The head, which is directed outwards, IS cup-shaped to receive the orbicular bone, and is sup- ported by a contracted neck from which the crura spring; these diverge as they pass inwards, and terminate m the base or foot-piece, which is elliptical in fio-ure, and rests in the fenestra ovalis, which it accurately fills up, and against the membrane of which it presses. The anterior crus is the shorter, thicker and stronger; the posterior more slender, more curved, and longer,' the ^opposed margins of each presenting a slight groove for the reception of a thin membrane which is stretched between them. The chain of connexion thus established by the ossi- cula between the membrane of the tympanum and that which closes the fenestra ovalis is acted upon by three muscles, which are called the tensor and laxator tym- pani, and the stapedius. Tensor Ttmpani._A narrow, elongated, fasciculus of muscular fibres, attached to the walls of the osseous canal above the Eustachian tube as far back as the spine ot the sphenoid; it terminates in a small flattened ten- don, which is inflected outwards, nearly at a right anrfe and IS inserted into the upper part of the handle of the malleus below the processus gracilis. pe._To draw the handle of the malleus inwards and thus make tense the merabrana tympani Laxator TYMPANi.—Always indistinct, so much so ' that Its muscularity has been doubted; it arises from the •spinous process of the sphenoid, and winding upwards and outwards to the Glasserian fissure, is attached to the [point ot the processus gracilis.

Stapedius.—Small, and of an oval shape; it arises from within the pyramid, and emerging from its apex, it passes forwards and slightly outwards, and is in- serted into the neck of the stapes. Use.—To draw inwards this bone, and press its base against the membrane of the ovalis fenestra. From the firm connexion of these several small bones to each other, it necessarily follows, that motion pro- duced in any one of them will be propagated in succes- sion to the entire, and hence the effect produced by the contraction of the tensor tympani may be more clearly understood. In rendering the tympanic membrane tense, the muscle draws the malleus inwards, which causes its head to press firmly against the body of the incus, which in its turn is prevented from passing backwards by its short process, which is fixed in the recess of the tympanum. The motion is accordingly propagated to its long process, which again presses against the orbicu- lar bone, and this naturally impels the stapes, with which it is united, against the membrane of the fenestra ovalis. During these movements it will be observed that the processus gracilis of the malleus is the point or fulcrum on which the motion takes place, and the better to adapt it to this ofiice, it is firmly attached to_ the Glasserian fissure by a strong ligamentous connexion, the laxator tympani of some authors. This is the explanation ad- vanced by Huguier, and it appears to be the true one, as the one action renders both membranes, that of the tympanum and fenestra ovalis, tense at the same mo- ment, and the vibrations which take place in the for- mer from external causes are rapidly conveyed to the latter by the osseous chain, and by it accurately repeated for the labyrinth to take cognizance of it. The Vidian nerve, which enters the tympanum through a small hole at the base of the pyramid, crosses the cavity from within downwards and outwards, between the long process of the incus and handle of the malleus. It may be presumed that it conducts the small twig ot theportio dura which Soemerring describes as passing to the stapedius muscle for its supply.THE EAR.

In order that a more intel- ligible view may be obtained of this complicated struc- ture, we will describe each of its component parts indi- vidually. Modiolus or Axis—This is of an irregular conical hgure. Its base turned internally, and appearing in the bottom of the internal auditory meatus, its apex di- rected outwards, and slightly downwards and forwards terminating m a dilated process (scyphus), resembling m shape a cup, but only inferiorly, as it is deficient superiorly, where it presents a smooth margin for its entire extent. The base exhibits numerous foramina tor the entrance of the auditory nerve, which, piercing the bone, runs m numerous canals through its struc- ture, and throws off several fine filaments to the external surface, for the supply of the scalar, while its continued trunk, reduced to a mere thread, emerges from the bony tubules in which it was contained, in the centre of the lunnel-shaped depression at its apex. The surface ot the modiolus is also deeply grooved in a spiral manner llmTna *° attachment of the spiral Tube of the Cochlea or Lamina Gyrorum.—This is a tube about one inch and a quarter in length, if mea- sured on Its external or convex wall, but much shorter on Its internal or concave; neither is it of the same ca- liber throughout, for while at its internal part it is about one-tenth of an inch in diameter, at its external it is scarcely one-sixteenth. Its first coil encircles the expanded base_ of the modiolus, overlapping and be- coming fused with that immediately above it, and thus it continues to ascend, forming two turns and a half, gra- dually decreasing in size till it reaches its apex. Tra versing this tube from one extremity to the other and dividing It into two secondary ones, is a thin plate partly osseous and partly cartilaginous,—the lamina smi rahs, commencing at the fenestra rotunda, and winding around the modiolus, following exactly the coils of\ 1 758 NERVOUS SYSTEM. spiral tube itself; having arrived at the funnel-shaped apex of the modiolus, it ceases to be attached to it lor a short distance, but ultimately becomes connected to it again near its termination. Hence the lamina spiralis divides the cochlea tube into two distinct canals,—a superior and external, the scala vestibuli, which com- municates directly with that cavity, and an inferior and an internal, the scala tympani, which would open into that chamber through the fenestra rotunda, but for the , membrane, which in the natural condition of the parts 1 completely closes it in. Near the apex of the cochlea the two seals communicate through an opening which we have already described as existing where the spiral lamina ceases to be attached to the modiolus; this aper- ture was described by Breschet under the name of the helicotrema. It will be now necessary to take a briei view of the structure of the lamina spiralis, and in order to understand it properly we must suppose it to be completely folded out, in which state it would be of an obZg fi/ure, divided by a line drawn diagonally from thelpolite angles into two triangles,_the internal, its base mrned inwards, consisting of a thick plate of bone perforated by several canals for the cochlear nerve and terminating by its apex in a curved process (hamulus) , and the external, which is membranous, its base being tSrned outwards and its apex inwards, corresponding to the base of the last. It will, therefore, naturally follow, that when th s plate, composed of those different tissues, is coil J edgeways around'the modiolus, that the osseou structure must prevail in the first turn, must diminish n the second, and cease altogether m the commence- Sent of the third, but the rule must be reversed in th membranous portion, as it forms but a very smau Son indeed of the first coil, an ff^^f^^/'X.'t ?°on 0? ihe second, and the entire of the third or last "ddition to the openings of the two be necessary to mention another, which also commuTHE EAR. fjgg the jugular fossa, can only be considered, like that of the vestibule, to be a channel for the removal of the venous blood from the interior of the cavity. Having now concluded the descripiion of the osseous It will be necessary to direct our attention to what has been termed the membranous labyrinth, and before do- ing so. It may be necessary to observe, that it is by no means as extensive as the preceding, beinn- deficient altogether in the cochlea. It consistsTm fact, of three semicircular canals, moulded, as it were, within, and exactly resemb ing the osseous; but as the former are much smaller than the latter, an interval exists between them which is_ filled up by a transparent fluid,_the iquor Co unnii, or perilymph ofBreschet; they have likewise the dilatation or ampulla at one of their ex tremities, and the two vertical open by a common onfice, thus forming for the three,'five aJertureraUo- The Membranous Vestibule differs from the osseous n not consisting of a single, but a double cavity ThZ have been termed the saccule, situated superiorly and apparently constituted by the five orifices of the mem branous semicircular canals, which expand as they opm nto It; and the utricle which lies in the lower part of the fovea semi-elliptica, and which is much la ger I an the preceding; It has not exactly been determin^l whe- ther these cavities communicate, but the general idea I , that they do not. Like the membranous semicir- cular canals, they are likewise surrounded by the peri- lymph of Breschet, and they are all preserved in /hL tended state by a similar fluid, called^ eJdoirpl o" Scarpa. _ I should be recollected that, althoCh the cochlea IS devoid of an apparatus similar to tl Se iust de cnbed, sti 1 it, as well as the vestibule and sc^',idr cular canals, is lined by a fine fibrous membrane aX gous nearly to serous, which adheres closely to heir bony walls constituting, in fact, a periosteun^i or t e entire cavity. ^'^ exiV^i";'" membranous utricle and ventricle there exists a cretaceous powder, deposited in two whhe hming masses, analogous to the calcareous deZshl found m the ears of fishes, and known by the zX offjYO NERVOUS SYSTEM. otolithes, but which in the human subject, from their liability to fall into powder, have been called otoconia. It is supposed to be of use in increasing and condensing the perception of sound with the labyrinth. In the description of the tympanum we have already remarked, that the vibrations produced by sound on its memtat is propagated by the chain of bones direct^ to the membrane of the fenestra ovalis, and so to the fluid which fills the vestibular cavity; but in addition to this it also reaches the latter through the fenestra ro- tunda, and so through the scal^B, but in a less intensified form The bones of the head form likewise a conduct- ng medium, but it would appear that the sonorous undulations thus conveyed act only through the cochlea and of course their perception is not so well marked as in the preceding instances.

The vessels of the body are divided into the arteries, veins and lymphatics, but the two former wHl only be described in the present section. The arteries are elas- tic, yielding, membranous tubes, commencing by the great systemic vessel,—aorta, which, breaking up into branches, ultimately terminates in the capillaries or the connecting link between the arteries and veins. These vessels are usually found empty after death, but pre- sent sufficient resistance, even in that condition, to maintain their cylindrical form. Commencing by trunks, they divide dichotomously as a general rule, and the combined area of the branches (with the one exception of the basilar) exceeds that of the trunks from which they emanate; the arterial system would, therefore, represent a cone with its apex situated at the root ot the aorta, and its base at the capillaries. The arteries are usually described as having three coats,—an external or areolo-fibrous, a middle or elastic, and an internal or serous; but these are further subdivided into addi- tional layers, of which six have been enumerated, and will be presently described. Areolo-fibrous coat con- sists of an investing tubule of condensed or membram- form areolar tissue, moulded by its deep surface, which is dense on the middle coat, whilst externally, more lax, it connects the vessel to the surrounding parts, the fibres which constitute it being either spiral longi- tudinal or interlacing in their direction, and althougti merely consisting of the elements of ordinary areolar tissue, still the elastic fibres almost invariably predo- minate, in fact, becoming continuous with the middle coat. This tunic is the most resisting constituent ot an artery, and it is observed that, after the internal and middle give way in aneurism, that it supports the im-GENERAL REMARKS. 7-73 pulse Of the circulation for a long period; and likewise that after the application of a ligature, the internal and middle coats are divided, whilst the external relTns entire; this tunic is thin in the aorta, as well as S the arteries of the brain.

Ihe elements of the venous tunics are similar to the arterial, but not developed to a like degree; thus, externally a thin areolo-fibrous tunic corresponds to the same coat of the arteries, internal to which is a fibrous layer, con- sisting of an external circular set of fibres, extremely weak, supported on a longitudinal fibrous tumc, and be- tween these, unstriped muscular filaments are situated; while again, more internally there is a fenestrated layer supporting the epithelium on its deep surface.

But before entering into a detailed examination ot these several divisions, it will be necessary to state briefly Its mode of attachment to the heart, and its- peculiar relations at its point of connexion to this or- gan with the peculiar mechanism which nature has employed (valves) to obviate that regurgitation which must have resulted from the elasticity of this capacious tube, had no means been providentially employed to antagonize it. i j In .the description of the left ventricle of the heart It lias been shown that at the right extremity of its base a fabrous annulus is situated, connected to its mus- cular structure, to which the term " aortic zone" has been attached, presenting to the touch a sensation of a dense, resisting ring, and to this the vessel under con- sideration IS attached in the following manner :_From the distal edge of the zone three triangular processes are given off, their bases broad and continuous with each other at the zone, but as they ascend towards the artery with the walls of which they are ultimately blended by their apices, they leave spaces between theni, completed by the serous membrane of the pericardium externally, and the endocardium or ventricular lining prolonged into the aorta internally, whilst the middle tunic of that vessel exhibiting three convex roots com- pletes the attachment,_thus constituting three dis- tinc pouches formerly described by Morgagni, after- wards by Valsalva, and now generally kfown'as the Z the ed'"- ^««^"ption, it is manifest that the edges of the roots present crescentic margins the concavities of which look towards the vessel, and to these sharp edges are attached the convex margins of the semilunar valves, which are of course similar in number to the interspaces between the roots, viz three 1 hcse valves are precisely the same in structure ot a thin process of fibrous tissue prolonged from the776 ARTERIES AND VEINS. roots to which they are connected, and covered on both surfaces by a layer of serous membrane, the hmng ot the artery; their figure is such as their name would im- ply, but remarkable from the fact of presentmg m their free margin, about the centre, a small but firm tubeix e, of variable size, and always constantly present ihe fibrous structure constituting these curtains, although exceedingly thin, still presents an arrangement ot its fibres easily demonstrable, the most external formmg continuous curves parallel to their attached margms while the internal, on the contrary, which are much thicker and stronger, form a double crescent, of which the cornu of the valve constitutes one extremity, and the tubercle or corpus Arantii the other. _ Now, m the passage of the blood from the ventricle into the aor a, ^he valves are necessarily thrown up against its walls, and here the corpora Arantii accomplish a very impor- tant office, in producing such an amount of separation as to permit the fluid to insinuate itself between them, and thus, by distending the aortic sinuses, to act me- chanically on the valves in forcing them downwards, and thus' opposing the retrograde course of the com- pressed stream; these Arantian bodies have been like- wise said to strengthen the valves, and, more accurate y, to occlude any minute aperture that might possibly exist between their approximated margins. If we now direct our attention to the boundaries of the commencement of this vessel, or the aortic zone, we will find them to be the following :--Anteriorly he prolongation upwards of the base ot the right ventiicle ^ infundibulum, coronary arteries, and -Uf^fi--;^^;^ diac plexus: posteriorly it rests upon, and is accuiately adapS to, ^h^ anterior'median furrow l-Jween the t.^^^ auricles- on the right side it corresponds to a groove Sween'the infundibulum and auriculo-ventricular ori- fice and on the left to the wall of the corresponding auricir It is here the arch of the aorta may be said o commence, a point corresponding to tbe junction of die can luge of the fourth nb with tl- sternum oi the lef side, and passing upwards, f^^^^^s, a. d o th^^^^^^^^^ as far as the second costal cartilage on ^^^^^^^^^^ ing portion), turns backwards and shghtly upwards,ARCH OF THE AORTA. 777 2 L 3 crossing the upper part of the thorax in an oblique di- rection to the left aspect of the second dorsal vertebra (transverse portion), and then descending vertically terminates at the inferior margin of the third (descend- ing portion) by becoming continuous with the thoracic aorta.

These examples are, however, very rare, and are usually accompanied by a transposition likewise of the veins. After its origin, the aorta may proceed for a short distance, and then divide into an ascending and de- scending trunk,—the former for the supply of the head and upper extremity, and the latter for that of the lower, as in the horse. The aorta may also bifurcate at the junction of its ascending and trans- verse portions, and unite again at the spine, the oeso- phagus and trachea passing through the interval be- tween those abnormal branches, which thus form an arterial ring around them, as in reptiles. The aorta may also arise in common with the pulmonary artery, and thus prove a cause of cyanosis. With respect to the branches which arise from the arch, they may be either anomalies from deficiency, anomalies from redundancy, or anomalies from transpo- sition. In the first instance there may be only two branches; and in this case the left carotid almost inva- riably arises from the innominata, or the left subclavian and carotid may form a common trunk; in the second there may be four branches, the left vertebral being usually the supernumerary. But a very curious ex- ample of this anomaly has occurred where there was no common carotid, the internal and external carotid arte- ries springing separately from the arch (see Dr. Power's work on Arteries, pp. 34, 35). In some cases these may be five, the additional branches being the left ver- tebral, with the internal mammary or superior inter- costal, or inferior thyroid or deep cervical; but we have never observed an instance where more than five sprano- independently from the arch, although we are aware such has been recorded. In the anomaly by transpo- sition we usually find both carotids arising by a com- mon trunk, on either side of which is a subclavian, or both the latter may spring from the left extremity of the arch, the carotids still arising from a common trunk. Collateral Branches of the Arch These are:tJ80 AKTERIKS AND VEINS. 1 The two coronary; 2. Arteria innominata; 3. Left clrotid; and 4. Subclavian: but as the last three will be described with the head and neck, we will conhne our attention at present to the first only, which consist of a right and left. . j • Eight Coronary arises from the anterior and right side of the arch of the aorta, between the infundibulum and right auricle. It passes backwards and downwards throu<?h the right auriculo-ventricular furrow till it reaches the upper part of the posterior yentricular groove, along which it runs to the apex of the heart, where it anastomoses with the left coronary, having, however, previously communicated with it by a cross brrnch at the point where it enters the ventricular ^""leTt Coronary arises from the anterior and left side of the aorta, above the margin of the sigmoid valve, and passing downwards and towards the left side, between Ihl infundibulum and left auricle, enters the anterior ventricular furrow, through which it runs to the apex of the heart to anastomose with the right ; as it enter, the ventricular groove it throws off a large branc^i, which winds around the base of the left ventricle, through the left auriculo-ventricular groove, to anasto- mose with the right. Remarks.-Yrom this ™^g«^,^°*V^\'',t, served that the heart is surrounded by two arterial zones -one of which encircles it from above downwards, and ihe other from side to side. From these zones branches are given off for the supply of the walls of he auricl and ventricles, the septum and ongms of the 'reat arterial trunks.

Remarks.—It will be recollected that although the oesophagus lies anterior to this vessel below, it is to its right side above, while the thoracic duct, although to its right below, is partially posterior to it above. The point where the lesser azygos crosses beneath it to join the greater is usually opposite the fifth or sixth dorsal vertebra. Anomalies—None except from transposition. Collateral Branches—1. Bronchial; 2. (Esopha- geal; and 3. Intercostal, Bronchial—Generally two in number. They arise from the upper part of the thoracic aorta, and, passing upwards and forwards to the back part of the root of the lung, attach themselves to the posterior wall of the bronchial tubes, accompanying them into the substance of the lung, supplying them, as well as the parenchyma of those organs; they also send branches to the oesopha- gus and left ventricle of the heart. It is supposed that their effete blood is taken up by the pulmonary arteries, or that they communicate with the pulmonary veins. CEsopHAGEAL.—Usually very small, and about six in number; they arise from the front of the aorta, and, passing outwards, reach the anterior surface of the 03so- phagus, perforate its cellular and muscular coats, and are lost in the submucous tissue, anastomosing above with the bronchial and twigs from the inferior thyroid, and below with the coronary and left phrenic, Intercostals.—Nine on the right side, and ten on the left; they arise from the back part of the thoracic aorta, and pass, the superior upwards and outwards, the middle horizontally outwards, and the inferior downwards and outwards, to terminate at the inter- transverse space by dividing into an anterior and poste- rior branch. Relations.—On right side:—Anteriorly, ojsophagus, pneumogastric nerves, thoracic duct, and vena azygos;ARTERIES AND VEINS. 782 posteriorly, bodies of the vertebra and anterior common Lament; on the left side the five or six mfenor run behind the azygos minor, and the two last under the attachments of the crura of the diaphragm. Anteeior Branch, from its direction, must be con- sidered the common trunk; it passes directly outwards on the anterior costo-transverse ligament, then on the external layer of intercostals, and covered by the pleura as far as the angle, where it enters between the two lavers of the intercostal muscles, winds upwards to the inferior margin of the rib above, where it has its corre- sponding vein above it and its nerve below it, and with these relations it proceeds to. the anterior third ot the rib, and, dipping downwards, terminates by anastomos- in<^ with the internal mammary, phrenic, and lumbar; a little beyond the angle it always throws off a small branch, which runs on the upper margin of the nb be- low, and is lost in supplying the intercostal muscles. Posterior Branch—Smaller than the preceding; it passes directly backwards through a quadrilateral space, bounded above and below by the transverse processes, externallv by the anterior costo-transverse ligament, and internally by the bodies of the vertebra. It is dis- tributed to the erectors of the spine and integument, anastomosing with the branches from the opposite ar- terv As it passes through the intertransverse space^ it throws off a small branch, which enters the spinal canal through the intervertebralhole, communicates with Te spinal arteries, while a slender filament runs on he back part of the body of the bone, and, arriving at the venous foramen, which occupies its centre, bfrca es the branch above and below, anastomosing with similar ones from the opposite sides,-thus constituting a circle around it, from which numerous ramusculi enter the cancellous structure of the bone itself. ARTERIES OF THE HEAD AND NECK. The arteries destined for this region consist of the carotfds and subclavians, with their several branche ; hut as those trunks on the right side spring from the arte'a tnoniinata, it will be first necessary to examme this vessel.AETEEIA INNOMINATA—CAROTIDS. 783 Arteria Innominata arises from the junction of the ascending, with the transverse portions of the arch of the' aorta, opposite the cartilage of the second rib, passes upwards, forwards, and outwards, and terminates a little above the sterno-clavicular articulation. Relations—Anteriorly, first bone of sternum, origin of sterno-hyoid and thyroid muscles, deep cervical fascia, remains of thymus gland, and left vena innomi- nata; posteriorly, the trachea; to the right side, right vena innominata, pneumogastric and phrenic nerves, cone of the pleura, and apex of the lung; and to the left, the left carotid, but separated from it by a triangular interval, in which is apparent the trachea, some loose areolar tissue, with the descending thyroid veins. Remarks.—This artery varies in length from one to two inches, and usually rises higher in the neck in the female than the male, owing to the shortness of the tho- rax in a vertical direction. At its point of bifurcation into carotid and subclavian, it is usually slightly dilated, the former vessel always being on the most anterior plane, and slightly overlapping the latter. Common Carotid arises from the arteria innominata on the right side, a little above the sterno-clavicular arti- culation, passes upwards, backwards, and outwards, and terminates at the upper edge of the thyroid cartilage, opposite the lower edge of the third cervical vertebra. Relations.—Anteriorly, integuments, platysma, su- perficial fascia, communicating branch of anterior, with external jugular vein, sterno-mastoid, hyoid, thyroid, and omo-hyoid muscles, deep cervical fascia, superficial branch of superior thyroid artery, transverse thyroid veins, and descenders noni; posteriorly, longus colli, and rectus capitis anticus major, inferior thyroid ar- tery, recurrent and sympathetic nerves; externally, in- ternal jugular vein and pneumogastric nerve; and internally, trachea, oesophagus, inferior constrictor of pharynx, termination of recurrent, and inferior thyroid artery, with lobe of thyroid body, which occasionally overlaps it, especially on the left side. Left Carotid arises from the transverse portion of the arch of the aorta, opposite the second dorsal verte- bra, but terminates at the same point as the right; it consequently, in the first part of its course, for about784 ARTERIES AND VEINS. one inch and a half, has the following thoracic rela- tions:—Anteriorly, first bone of sternum, origins ot sterno-hyoid and thyroid muscles, deep cervical tascia, remains of thymus gland and left vena innommata; pos- teriorly, trachea, esophagus, and thoracic duct; exter- nally, pneumogastric and phrenic nerves, and tormation of left vena innominata; externally and posteriorly, lelt subclavian; and internally, arteriainnominata with the triangular interval, containing trachea and inferior thy- roid veins. -, , i • Remarks.—^o\\i the carotids and subclavians on the left side, although longer in their course, are smaller in caliber than those on the right, a fact, according to Bi- chat, resulting from the more frequent use ot the latter side of the body. It should be borne m mmd that the carotids, although comparatively near to each other at their origin, gradually diverge as they ascend, so that a considerable interval exists between them at their ter- mination; the left is also nearer the mesian line, and is more closely related both to the oesophagus and its corresponding pneumogastric nerve. A f invests the artery, vein, and nerve, on both sides, but the two last are always in closer connexion with each other than the nerve to'the artery. We have in the general description stated the point where these arteries usually terminate, but it should be recollected that cases fre- quently occur where it may bifurcate either above or below the upper edge of the thyroid cartilage, but it is a general rule that its division into external and mter- naf carotids is always nearer the angle of tl^e jaw inthe adult than in the very young or very old, the ob vious reason of the non-development of the angle at tho e periods of life.

The poiiit of their bifur- cation may be likewise very high, as already stated; we have seen it more than once extending higher than the angle of the jaw before its division took place; but in those examples the superior thyroid always sprung from the common carotid. External Carotid arises from the common, oppo- site the upper edge of the thyroid cartilage, ascends at first upwards and slightly inwards as far as the pos- terior belly of the digastric, then passes upwards, back- wards, and outwards, and terminates in the parotid gland, half-an-inch below the zygoma, a little posterior to the condyle of the lower jaw. Relations.—Antevioi'ly, integument, platysma, form- ing the musculus risorius of Santorini in the parotid region, superficial fascia, lingual nerve, stylo-hyoid and digastric muscles, portio dura, and formative branches ot the external jugular vein; posteriorly, glosso-pharyn- geal nerve, stylo-pharyngeus, and glossus muscles, point of styloid process and stylo-hyoid ligament, and ascend- ing palatine artery, all of which separate it from the in- ternal carotid; the superior laryngeal nerve also lies behmd it; externally, internal carotid, sterno-mastoid, and external auditory meatus; and internally, thyroid, lingual, and facial arteries, the stylo-maxillary artery separating it from the latter, while above the angle of the jaw it is invested on all sides by the parotid gland. Remarks.—From what we have stated with respect to the direction of this artery it will be at once seen that It forms in its course a curve, representing a limited segment of a circle, the concavity of which looks down- wards, backwards, and outwards, and although very superficial at its origin, it becomes more deeply situated as it ascends, being protected by the angle of the jaw, which is in a great measure calculated to defend it from mjury; its average length is three inches. Anomalies.—'YhasQ are rare in the external carotid, but still cases occur wliere it might almost be said to be absent, as in the following instance, which we have i had an opportunity of observing. The common carotid786 ARTERIES AND VEINS. bifurcated regularly at the thyroid cartilage, but while the internal carotid ran its usual course, that which re- presented the external only ascended a line or two, and then broke up into its numerous branches, each pursu- ing its ordinary direction; the appearance of this ano- maly when dissected was extremely beautiful. Branches of the External Carotid.—Besides those which it gives off to the tympanum and parotid, which are very variable in number and size, it likewise throws off ten others which are always capable of demonstra- tion • thesemay be termed, anterior, posterior, transverse, and ascending,—the first consisting of three, viz., su- perior thyroid, lingual, and facial-, the second also ot three, viz., muscular, occipital, and posterior auricular; the third of two, viz., the transverse facial and internal maxillary; and the fourth also of two, viz., ascendmg pharyngeal and temporal rri Superior Thyroid is the first branch given off by the external carotid from its internal side alter its origin, and may be divided into two stages,—a transverse, reaching, in a curved direction, the convexity directed upwards, from its parent trunk to the side of the larynx, and vertical, extending from the latter point to the thy- roid gland. , . x i„ Rdations-FirstStage.-Kui^riox\y, integument, pla- tysma, superficial fascia, formative branches of the an- terior jugular vein, and twigs of the descendens noni to the sterno-hyoid and omo-hyoid muscles -, posteriorly, loose areolar tissue, and superior laryngeal nerve, sepa- parating it from tli.e longus colli muscle. ^ Second ^fai7e.-Anteriorly, omo-hyoid, and, near its termination, sterno-thyroid; posteriorly, ^VV^l^^^^^_ of sterno-thyroid, and then winding beneath its exter nalmargin,'thy-id origin of tl--feinor constri tor On reaching the latter point, it divides into three bianches,_an external, which runs on the outside of tl e thy;oid gland, and anastomoses with the interior ti yroS; a middle, which perforates the substance of M and breaks up into numerous ramusculi for s supply ; and an internal, which ^uns on its inner side towards &e middle line, supplies the middle obe, and ends a branch across the crico-thyroid space to anasto-BRANCHES OF EXTERNAL CAROTID. 787 mose with a similar one from the opposite side; this also sometimes gives off a small laryngeal branch. Collateral Branches—Hyoid, muscular, and la- ryngeal. Hyoid Branch.—This is always very small, spring- ing from the artery immediately after its origin; it passes forwards and inwards between the thyroid muscle and ligament, below the cornu of the os hyoides, anas- tomosing in the middle line with that from the opposite side,.and with a similar branch from the lingual. Muscular Branch.—Small and slender, arises close to the last; it passes downwards and outwards over the sheath of the great vessels, and beneath the sterno-mas- toid, to which, and the adjoining glands, it is distributed. Laryngeal Branch—Usually large, arises from the thyroid at the angle of flexion, between its first and second stages, passes inwards, at first between the middle and inferior constrictors, with the superior laryn- geal nerve, then between the thyro-hyoid muscle and membrane, perforates the latter, or sometimes the thy- roid cartilage, and beneath the mucous membrane di- vides into two branches,—an ascending, to supply the epiglottis and aryteno-epiglottidean folds; and a de- scending, which runs downwards to be distributed to the lining membrane of the larynx and trachea. Remarks.—The size of the superior thyroid is very •variable, and seems to depend, in a great measure, on the capacity of the inferior thyroid, it being generally ' observed, that where the one is extremely large, the other is relatively small, a fact which would appear to argue strongly against the use of the ligature in aflfec- itions of the thyroid gland. Anomalies—Thh vessel, as the rule, may be said to ; arise immediately below the cornu of the os hyoides, but - exceptions will occur, when it may come off either some distance above or below that point, in the latter in- ?stance its origin being usually from the common ca- irotid. It may also arise by a single trunk, in common iwith the lingual, or its laryngeal branch may proceed -•separately from the external carotid.

Remarks—The lingual artery is sometimes exceed- ; ingly large, and at the same time remarkable for its 1 tortuosity; it is also variable in its relations to the I middle constrictor, occasionally passing between its j slips of origin from the cornu and appendix of the os thyoides, and occasionally being superficial to both. In lits termination as ranine, its filaments are very nume- irous, slender, and long, supplying both the muscles and 1 mucous membrane. Anomalies—The lingual artery repeatedly arises by a common trunk with the facial, but very rarely with the thyroid. Facial Artery.—Arises a little above the linaual I from the inner side of the external carotid, and, pass- ung at first upwards and inwards, till it reaches the unner side of the angle of the jaw, then turning ho- mzontally forwards beneath its ramus for about an inch aabruptly turns upwards and outwards over its inferior imargm, and continues its very tortuous course as far rns the internal canthus of the eye. Hence it has been Idivided into two stages,_a cervical and facial, in which .\t may be separately examined. Relations of Cervical ^ta^/e.—Anteriorly, integument f{)latysma, fascia, lingual nerve, digastric and stylo-hyoid muscles, facial vein, and a small process of the submax- lillary gland; posteriorly, stylo-pharyngeus, stylo-glos- S3US, glosso-pharyngeal nerve, submaxillary gland and pposterior edge of mylo-hyoid muscle; externally Jtylo- nmaxillary ligament, and insertion of internal pterygoid • Hnd internally it embraces the submaxillary trknd' within its concavity. ° ' Facial Stage—Anteriorly, integument, platysma tfascia, some fibres of the triangularis oris, zygomatics^ f790 ARTERIES AND VEINS. and above, a variable mass of fat, with branches of portio dura; posteriorly, ramus of jaw, buccinator, levator anguli, and labii superioris alajque nasi, and ultimately nasal process of superior maxillary bone. Its accompanying vein, which is very large, lies in its entire course to its outside, and is void of the tortuosity which distinguishes the artery. Collateral Branches.—Those in the cervical stage are, palatine, tonsillitic, glandular, and submental; those in the facial, masseteric, labial, inferior and superior coronary, nasal and angular, or terminating. Palatine,—This is generally very small, arising usually in common with the tonsillitic, immediately after the origin of the facial; it passes upwards, back- wards, and inwards, between the stylo-glossus and stylo- pharyngeus, and between the external and internal carotid arteries, and reaching the superior constrictor of the pharynx, which it perforates to supply the ve- lum, anastomoses with the proper palatine arteries from the internal maxillary. Tonsillitic.—Variable in size; it arises generally in common with the preceding, and passes upwards and inwards between the stylo-glossus and internal ptery- goid, into the pterygo-pharyngeal space, perforates the superior constrictor, and is distributed to the tonsil, anastomosing with branches from the palatine. Glandular.—Three or four branches, distributed to the submaxillary gland. Submental Always large; it arises from the facial, immediately before the termination of its cervical stage, and passes forwards and inwards, beneath the ramus of the jaw, on the upper margin of the mylo-hyoid muscle, dividing on it into three branches,—a superior, middle, and inferior: the first winding upwards over the ramus of the jaw, to anastomose with the labial; the second dividing on the front of the chin into numerous ramus- culi, which supply that region; and the third piercing the mylo-hyoid muscle, to anastomose with the sublin- gual of the lingual. Masseteric.—These are very irregular as to number and size; they arise from the facial, immediately after it crosses the ramus of the jaw, and, passing outwards,BRANCHES OF CAROTID. 791 supply the masseter muscle, anastomosing with simi- lar twigs from the external carotid. Coronary.—These are two in number,—superior and inferior, the former being always the larger; they arise opposite the angle of the mouth, and run forwards and inwards on the posterior margin of the lips, being merely covered by the fine integument; they are re- markable for their tortuosity, as well as for their free inosculation, while from the arch formed by the two superior rather a large branch (arteria septi nasi) is given off for the supply of the mucous membrane of the septum of the nose. Lateralis Nasi arises generally opposite the lower border of the nose, and, passing inwards, ramifies on the compressor nasi, anastomosing Avith its fellow of the op- posite side, and with the nasal of the ophthalmic. Angular.—This is the terminal branch, and is no- thing more than a slender twig; it runs upwards and inwards, between the two heads of the levator labii su- perioris alseque nasi, then between the inner head of that muscle and edge of the orbicularis palpebrarum, to the internal canthus of the eye, where it anastomoses with the frontal and nasal of the ophthalmic. Remarks.—The facial artery is remarkable both for the length of its course and its tortuosity, forming a re- markable contrast to its vein, which is nearly perfectly straight, and which lies to its outer side. We have oc- casionally observed it completely obliterated as it passed over the ramus of the jaw, but its facial portion was still pervious to blood, which it received from its nume- rous anastomoses with the various branches in that region. We have been accustomed to describe a trian- gular space, bounded in front by the facial, behind by the external carotid, and above by the ramus of the jaw, constituting its base, which is a little better than an inch in width, and here an incision for subfascial cervi- cal abscess may be made with comparative safety,—a fact in surgical anatomy which was recently tested by Dr. Butcher with complete success. Anomalies It repeatedly arises in common with the lingual, and may terminate at the angle of the mouth, by dividing into the two coronary. Under theseARTERIES AND VEINS. 792 circumstances, the transversalis faciei is always unusu- ally large, and supplies its remaining branches. Muscular Branch arises about half-an-inch above the bifurcation of thecommon carotid, and passes horizontally backwards, to terminate in the sterno-mastoid muscle. Belations—Auteviorly, integument, platysma, and fas- cia; posteriorly, internal carotid, pneumogastric nerve, and internal jugular vein. i + Remarks.—This is usually very small, so much so that it is sometimes difficult to be demonstrated; it appears to be exclusively devoted to the sterno-mastoid muscle. Anomalies.—It occasionally arises in common with the occipital, and in many instances the Ungual nerve winds around it, and not the occipital. Occipital arises from the external carotid, about an inch above its bifurcation from the common carotid; it passes upwards, backwards, and outwards, to the pos- terior part of the scalp, where it terminates by divid- ing into two branches,_-an internal and external, which anastomose with each other, and with the temP°^^ fj^^ posterior auricular.

Relations—First Stage—Externally, ramus of jaw and edge of masseter muscle; internally, styloid pro- cess of temporal bone, internal lateral ligament, and in- ternal pterygoid muscle; superiorly, temporo-maxil- ary articulation; and inferiorly, convergence of internal lateral ligament, with vertical ramus of jaw. Second Stage.—Externally, ramus of jaw and temporal muscle; internally, dental and gustatory nerves- supe- riorly, external pterygoid; inferiorly, internal-ptery- goid; and anteriorly, buccinator muscle. Third Stage.—It lies in the pterygo-maxillary fossa, the boundaries of which have been already described with the base of the cranium, and while in this space it is in company with Meckel's ganglion close to the nasal plate of the palate bone, enveloped in a quantity of fat Collateral Branches.—These in the first sta-e are, tympamc, middle meningeal, and inferior dental - in the second, temporal, masseteric, pterygoid, buccal, and superior dental; and in the third, spheno-palatine, pos- terior palatine, Vidian, and infra-orbital. Tympanic—These are a series of minute twigs which enter the tympanum by the Glasserian fissure for the supply of Its mucous membrane. Middle Meningeal arises from the upper part of the artery as it lies internal to the neck of the jaw; -it passes upwards and inwards between the insertion of the exter- nal pterygoid and temporo-maxillary articulation on the outside; the Eustachian tube and levator palati on the inside; the inferior maxillary nerve in front, and theori- 1 gin ofthe internal lateral ligament behind, to all of which at distributes branches; it then runs between the two .roots of origin ofthe temporo-auricular nerve, and enters the cavity of the cranium through the spinous hole, a llittle above which it divides into two sets of branches L :an anterior and posterior: the former passes upwards ..and forwards, groovmg in succession the sphenoid and [parietal, a complete canal sometimes existing iu the 2 M 2 fa u tne796 ARTERIES AND VEINS. latter bone, and it ultimately anastomoses with its fellow of the opposite side, and with the anterior meningeal from the ascending pharygeal; in its course it throws off a large branch, sometimes more, which enters the orbit through the outer angle of the foramen lacerum orbitale, runs along the outer wall of that cavity, some of its twigs perforating the great wing of the sphenoid to anastomose with the temporal, while it terminates itself in the lachrymal gland by communicating with its proper artery. The posterior branch of the middle meningeal winds backwards, indenting the squamous plate of the temporal bone, and anastomosing with the posterior meningeal from the vertebral or occipital. Be- sides those branches which are given off for the supply of the dura mater and bone, it likewise distributes several small ones to the Casserian ganglion, as well as a very constant offset which passes directly backwards beneath that ganglion, and accompanies the Vidian nerve into the aqueduct of Fallopius, where it anatomoses with the stvlo-mastoid branch of the posterior auricular Inferior Dental arises from the internal maxillary a little anterior to the last; it passes downwards and outwards between the ramus of the jaw, and internal lateral ligament, and behind the inferior dental nerve; as it enters the dental hole, it throws off a minute fila- ment to accompany the mylo-hyoid nerve to the poste- rior border of that muscle, and then contmumg its course through the dental canal, and f^tributing nu- merous branches to the fangs and P}^lP till it reaches the mental hole, where it divides into two branches, incisive and mental, the former continuing alone th^ roots of the anterior teeth, and ultima ely anastomosing with its fellow of the opposite side, while the latTer emerges through the mental hole, and spread- W out into a star of branches which supplies the mu- cous membrane and muscles, ultimately anastomoses with the coronary, labial, and submental.

Masseteric—Generally small; it passes directly outwards through the sigmoid notch, occasionally pierc- ing the lower fibres of the external pterygoid, bends downwards betVeen the ramus of the jaw and masseter, and then enters the latter muscle, to which it is distri- buted, anastomosing with branches of the facial Pterygoid.—Several small, short twigs, variable in number, which are distributed to those muscles. Buccal —A small but long branch; it runs forwards through the upper part of the pterygoid space along the interior margin of the external pterygoid to the bucci- nator muscle, and on it anastomoses with the facial Posterior Dental.—This is usually a very large branch which is given off at the tuber maxillare, down which It descends for some distance very tortuously and then divides into three branches,-an external, micll die, and internal: the first runs along the alveoli, sup- plying the periosteum and mucous membrane of the teeth; the second pierces the tuber and distributes its branches to their roots, while the third enters the an- trum of Highmore, and its filaments ramify between its mucous membrane and the walls of the cavity Posterior Palatine arises from the internal maxil- lary m the pterygo-maxillary fossa; it immediately bends downwards through the posterior palatine canal and emerging on the hard palate, divides into two prin- cipal branches,-a posterior, which descends to supply the soft palate and tonsils, anastomosing with its fellow . of the opposite side, and with the sublingual; and an an- ■ tenor which curves along the hard palate, internal to ^the alveolar arch, and covered by the mucous mem- ibrane, reaches the foramen incisivum, where it anasto- ■ moses with its fellow and septal branches of the spheno- ; palatine. ^ ,w Jr'^''."^^'''''^' ^ ^^i^'^ passes back- ^wards and outwards in company with the nerve of the ^same name, and is expended on the base of the cranium im supplying the Eustachian tube, anastomosing with ttwigs from the ascending pharyngeal.798 ARTERIES AND VEINS. Spheno-palatine.—This, both from its size and di- rection, ought to be considered as the continuation ol the internal maxillary; it proceeds directly inwards through the spheno-palatine hole into the posterior part of the superior meatus, and divides into a network of branches which supplies the spongy bones, one or two long filaments always accompanying the nerve ot <.o- tunnius to the incisive fossa to anastomose with the posterior palatine. _ . , Infra-orbital.—Variableinsize;itpasses forwards crossing the spheno-maxillary fossa, through which i sends up numerous twigs, for the supply of the fa and muscles of the orbit, and before it emerges through the infra-orbital hole, it gives off filaments to the anterior part of the antrum.

Phartngea Ascendens arises from the external ca- rotid as it bifurcates from the common; passes nearly vertically upwards to the base of the cranium, and, di- viding into two branches,—a posterior (meningeal), which enters the cerebral cavity through the foramen lacerum posterius, where it anastomoses with the poste- rior meningeal; and an anterior (pharyngeal), which supplies the muscles of the pharynx and Eustachian tube, communicating with the tonsillitic, inferior pala- tine, and Vidian. Relations Anteriorly, external carotid and superior constrictor, the latter muscle being also internal to it; posteriorly, rectus capitis anticus major; externally and anteriorly, internal carotid. Remarks.—The ascending pharyngeal is always very variable as to size, appearing to be regulated in a great measure by the palatine of the facial, the increased ca- pacity of the one being generally accompanied by a cor- responding diminution of that of the other. Several of its smaller twigs are distributed to the nerves of this region, particularly to the superior cervical ganglion and pneumogastric. Anomalies.—We have observed the pharyngeal to arise from the common carotid immediately before its bifurcation, also from the occipital and facial. Temporal.—The continuation of the external caro- tid in direction, but not in size. It commences half-an- inch below the zygoma, and, passing nearly vertically upwards, crosses that process near its tubercle, and then, ascending for about one inch and a quarter, divides into three branches,—an anterior, to anastomose with the supra-orbital; a middle, to commiinicate beneath the muscle with the deep temporal; and a posterior, wind- ing backwards above the concha to anastomose with the posterior auricular and occipital. Relations—Anteriorly, integument, fascia, and attra- hensauremmuscle; posteriorly, temporo-auricularnerve, bone, and temporal aponeurosis. Remarks.—This artery is sometimes very large and800 ARTERIES AND VEINS. tortuous, and it always throws off one very peculiar branch,—the orbital, which -runs between the layers of the temporal aponeurosis, in company with the tempo- ro-malar nerve, and terminates in the orbicularis palpe- brarum. Anomalies We have never observed any. Internal Carotid arises from the common trunk, opposite the upper edge of the thyroid cartilage, and terminates within the cranial cavity at the side of the body of the sphenoid bone. It has been divided into three stages,_the first extending from its origin to the base of the cranium (cervical); the second from the last point to the anterior extremity of the petrous portion of the temporal bone (petrosal); and the third to its termination (cranial). The direction of its first or cer- vical stage is at first upwards and outwards, and then upwards, forwards, and inwards, its concavity being di- rected forwards and inwards. . Edations.—ABteriovlj, integument, platysma, lascia, lingual nerve, mastoid, occipital, and external carotid ar- teries, with the superficial relations of the latter, pha- ryngeal and glosso-pharyngeal nerves, stylo-glossus and stvlo-pharyngeus muscles, and styloid process, ascend- ino- palatine artery, the last five lying between it and the external carotid; posteriorly, rectus capitis anticus maior, eighth, ninth, and sympathetic nerves, with su- perior laryngeal branch from the pneumogastric and internal jugular vein; internally, external carotid su- perior constrictor, and ascending pharyngeal artery; and externally, internal jugular vein but separated from it above by the eighth and ninth nerves, one of the divisions of the latter, however, occasionally passing behind the vein. . . Before the artery enters the bone it makes a sharp turn forwards and inwards, and then ascends vertically, its relations at this point being :-Anteriorly, tensor pa- lati; anteriorly and externally. Eustachian tube; ex- ternally, middle meningeal artery, internal lateral liga- ment of lower jaw, and temporo-max.Uary articulation; internally, junction of occipito- and petro-phaiyngeal aponeurosis,-^ but separated from it by the superior cer- vical ganglion of the sympathetic; and posteriorly, fo-801 INTERNAL CAROTID. ramen lacerum posterius and the parts passing throiigh it, with lingual nerve. On entering the carotid canal, the artery pursues a very tortuous course, first ascend- ing for about a quarter of an inch, then turning hori- zontally forwards and inwards, then upwards and back- wards, and ultimately upwards and forwards, grooving the cartilage which fills up the anterior lacerated hole, where its third stage commences. Relations—Second Stage—On either side a large branch from the sympathetic, which, uniting by cross branches, form a plexus around it; externally and in- feriorly, bony portion of Eustachian tube; internally and superiorly, the cochlea; and superiorly, Casserian ganglion, separated from it by a thin plate of bone, which is frequently deficient in advanced life, the gang- lion lying on the vessel directly, with the intervention of a fine layer of dura mater. At the point of the pe- trous portion of the temporal bone the cranial stage commences, proceeding at first upwards and inwards, to reach the cavernous sinus, then arching forwards to the anterior clinoid process, from which it again bends upwards and backwards, to terminate in its cerebral branches. Relations—Third Stage.—Internally, side of the body of sphenoid, which it grooves, and pituitary gland; ex- ternally, sixth nerve and venous membrane; anteriorly, optic nerve and anterior clinoid process; and posteri- orly, posterior clinoid process. Remarks.—"YhQ internal carotid, from its complicated and apparently contradictory relations, is ahvays an ar- tery of great difficulty to the student; but he should, in the first place, recollect that at its origin it is quite superficial, being, in fact, equally so with the external carotid, and to the outer side of that vessel. It should also be borne in mind tliat some of its posterior rela- tions, as, for instance, the internal jugular vein, lino-ual and glosso-pharyngeal nerves, though they do lie behind it at the base of the cranium, afterwards change their position as they proceed to their several destinations. Nothing, in fact, but an intimate acquaintance with the several foramina in this region will remove the intri- cacies of this subject, as well as a familiarity with the 2 M 3802 ARTERIES AND VEINS. relative situation of the parts in the pterygo-pharyngeal space. This remarkable region is formed by the diva- rication of the internal pterygoid and superior constric- tor,—the former bounding it externally and the latter internally; its posterior wall constituted by the muscles of the spine, its base by a line drawn horizontally back- wards from the angle of the jaw to the vertebral co- lumn, while its apex is at the base of the skull, corre- sponding generally to the foramen commune posterius. Its contents may be thus generally stated:—Eighth, ninth, sympathetic, pharyngeal, and superior laryngeal nerves, internal carotid, pharyngeal and posterior pala- tine arteries, internal jugular vein, styloid process and muscles attached to it. The relation of the carotid ar- tery to the tonsil should here be specially noted, as it lies posterior to that gland. The examination of the pterygo-pharyngeal space is always better accomplished in the examination of the pharynx according to Bichat's section. Anomalies.—These are such as have been already in- dicated in the several origins of the external carotid, but we had an opportunity of observing, last winter, a very peculiar course of the internal carotid. It pursued at first its usual direction till it reached the base of the cranium, and then bent suddenly downwards and for- wards for about an inch and an half, when it as abruptly, and at an equally acute angle, again ascended vertically to the carotid foramen. It was at first supposed that the vessel was double until dissection revealed its abnor- mal disposition. Collateral Branches.—In its first stage it rarely gives off any, but in the second always a tympanic branch to anastomose with those of the external carotid and internal maxillary on the walls of that cavity; also a few small filaments (arteria receptaculi), for the supply of the cavernous sinus and Casserian ganglion; these require no separate description. In the third stage it throws off the ophthalmic, choroid, anterior and middle cerebral, and posterior communicating. OpHTHALinc.—This is always a large branch; it arises from a curve of the carotid, opposite the base of the anterior clinoid process, and enters the orbitBRANCHES OF INTERNAL CAROTID. 803 through the optic foramen in the same sheath, but lying at first inferior, and then external, to the optic nerve, in the latter position being between the sixth nerve and external rectus, and behind the lenticular ganglion; it next crosses forwards and inwards, above the optic, and below the nasal and superior rectus, then between the superior oblique and internal rectus, where it ter- minates in its ultimate branches. Collateral Branches.—While external to the optic nerve,—lachrymal and arteria centralis retinse; while above it,—ciliary, muscular, and supra-orbital; and while internal to it,—anterior and posterior ethmoidal, nasal, frontal, and palpebral. Lachrymal.—This is usually the largest branch of the ophthalmic; it passes forwards and outwards, invested in a fibrous tubule of the dura mater, in company with its corresponding nerve, till it reaches the lachrymal gland, where it breaks up into a number of filaments for its supply, sending a long branch forwards, which, piercing the broad tarsal ligament, anastomoses on the eyelid with the superior palpebral, forming the superior palpebral arch. In cases where the lachrymal branch is small, it is always reinforced by the twig from the in- ternal maxillary, already alluded to in the description of that artery. Arteria Centralis Retina—Remarkable for its tenuity; it pierces the optic nerve at first obliquely, and then, running directly through its centre, expands into a number of filaments, which radiate on the surface of the retina as far as its circumference; a distinct branch perforates the vitreous humour, and can be traced to the capsule of the lens. Ciliary Branches.—These may be divided into pos- terior, middle, and anterior; the first are extremely numerous, but very small; they form a complicated plexus around the optic nerve, and then, perforating the sclerotic, are distributed to the choroid and ciliary- processes; the second are only two in number, which also perforate the sclerotic, but at some distance from the optic nerve; they then pass forwards, between the sclerotic and choroid, along the horizontal axis of the eye, and before reaching the iris bifurcate, and incloseARTERIES AND VEINS. 804 it in an arterial zone; the third are very short, and arise from the muscular and supra-orbital; they pierce the sclerotic a little posterior to the cornea, and are also distributed to the iris. Muscular.—A series of twigs which supply the mus- cles in the upper part of the orbit. Supra-orbital.—A large branch, which passes for- wards and iuAvards on the levator palpebrse, and beneath the periosteum; it emerges through the supra-orbital notch, first giving twigs to the diploe and frontal sinuses, and then divides into two sets of branches,—internal and external, the former winding inwards to anastomose with its fellow above the root of the nose, and the latter running outwards to communicate with the temporal. Ethmoidal are two in number,—anterior and pos- terior, the former, usually small, accompanied the nasal twig of the ophthalmic through the anterior orbital hole, and on reaching the cavity of the cranium divides into two branches,—one for the supply of the anterior part of the falx cerebri, and the other breaking up into numerous filaments which accompany the ramuscuh of the olfactory nerve into the nose, to the mucous mem- brane of which they are distributed. The posterior ethmoidal is a much larger branch, but its destination is precisely similar to the preceding. _ Palpebral.—Two in number, a superior and inte- rior; the first emerges below the pulley of the superior oblique, and is reflected outwards between the orbicu- laris palpebrarum and the tarsal cartilage, as far as the external canthus, where it communicates with a branch from the lachrymal, forming a vascular arch irom which twigs are given ofi" to supply the upper eyelid; the in- ferior, generally larger, passes downwards at first behind the tendo oculi, then turns outwards along the lower lid, forming its arch by anastomosing with the trans- versalis fascia; its distribution is similar to the last Nasal.—Always very small; it leaves the orbit be- tween the pulley of the oblique and tendo oculi, and, having given ofi^a small twig to the lachrymal duct, di- vides Into two branches, one of ^^^ich communicates directly with the facial, while the other descends on the dorsum of the uose to anastomose with the lateralis nasi.BRANCHES OF INTERNAL CAROTID. 805 Frontal—Generally large; it emerges in company with the preceding, and, having thrown off a filament to the lachrymal sac, turns upwards through the fibres of the corrugator supercilii, and, dividing into two branches, the internal of which passes inwards to supply the integuments of the forehead, communicating with Its fellow of the opposite side, while the external winds outwards to anastomose with the supra-orbital. _ Remarks—The ophthalmic, according to our expe- rience, is always constant in its course and ultimate distribution, and we cannot at present recall an instance oi any peculiarity that would deserve especial notice. Anomalies—The same observation may be equally applied to the origin of this vessel. Anterior Cerebral arises from the carotid, about a quarter of an inch before its termination; it pursues a very tortuous course, first passing forwards and inwards on the under surface of the anterior lobe of the brain, between the olfactory and optic nerves, to both of which It distributes some minute twigs, and, on reaching the anterior extremity of the corpus callosum, it turns up- wards round Its genu, between the two anterior lobes then bends backwards on its superficial surface (cal- losal), concealed by the hemisphere which overlaps it, and, reaching its posterior extremity, turns downwards to anastomose with the posterior cerebral from the basilar.

Anomalies We have witnessed an instance where the anterior cerebral was deficient on the left side, but that on the right was of undue magnitude, and bifur- cated to form the terminal branches or callosal. Middle Cerebral.—This is a very large branch, and must be considered as the true termination ol the m- ternal carotid; it winds upwards, backwards, and out- wards, and, entering the fissure of Sylvius, divides into three branches,—an anterior, which ramifies on the under surface of the corresponding lobe; a posterior, which turns backwards to supply the middle and pos- terior lobes; and a middle, which bifurcates to inclose the lobule of the fissure (island of Reil), and then, con- tinuing its course outwards, winds round the external border of the hemisphere to anastomose on its upper surface with the hemispheric arteries from the anterior cerebral. ,. ^ ^ 4.

Remarks—It is sometimes so small that it can with difficulty be demonstrated, and hence the fact of its re- puted absence. Anomalies.—It may arise either as stated, or from the middle cerebral or posterior communicating arteries. SUBCLAVIAN ARTERIES. These two trunks resemble the carotid arteries in differing in size as well as origin, the right being the larger, and arising from the arteria inuominata, oppo- site the sterno-clavicular articulation; the left smaller, and springing from the descending portion of the arch of the aorta opposite the second dorsal vertebra, but both terminate at the same point, viz., the lower edge of the first rib. Both are likewise divided into three stages by the anterior scalenus, which crosses them at a right angle, and their direction is at first upwards and outwards, till they ascend about half-an-inch above the clavicle, and then downwards, outwards, and a little backwards, till they ultimately end in the axillary. We will confine our remarks at present to the right trunk. Relations—First Stage.—Anteriorly, integument, pla- tysma, fascia, sternal attachment of sterno-mastoid, deep cervical fascia, communicating branch from anterior to external jugular vein, sterno-hyoid and thyroid. Burn's fascia, internal jugular and vertebral veins, pneumo- gastric, superior and middle cardiac nerves; posteriorly, longus colli, but at some distance from it, and separated from it by loose areolar tissue, recurrent laryngeal and sympathetic nerves; internally, right carotid and pneu- mogastric; and externally andinferiorly, lung and pleura. _ Second Stage—Anteriorly, integument, platysma, fas- cia, clavicular portion of sterno-mastoid, deep cervical fascia, phrenic nerve, and anterior scalenus; posteriorly, cone of pleura and middle scalenus. Third Stage—To arrive at this space it passes through a tringular space, bounded in front by the anterior808 ARTERIES AND VEINS. scalenus; behind, by the posterior; and below, by the first rib, when it enters the posterior inferior triangle of the neck, where its relations are the following:—An- teriorly, integuments, platysma, external jugular vein, transversalis humeri artery, supraclavicular branches of cervical plexus, two layers of fascia, and a quantity of loose areolar tissue, with subclavian branch of brachial plexus; posteriorly, posterior scalenus and first nb; externally and superiorly, brachial plexus; and infe- riorly and anteriorly, its own vein. The left subclavian in its first stage is nearly vertical, and it has anterior to it the same parts as the right, with the addition of the formation of the left vena innomi- nata, lung, pleura, cartilage of first rib, and clavicle; pos- terior to it the longus colli, with which it is in immediate contact, and at its commencement, the thoracic duct, which is a little internal to it, and sympathetic nerve; externally, the left lung and pleura; internally, oesopha- gus, and internally and anteriorly, left carotid, pueumo- gastric, and phrenic nerves. In its second stage it is si- milar to the right, only that it is crossed by the thoracic duct, which winds over it on the edge of the scalenus to join the subclavian vein. Eemarks.—The difference in length between the two subclavian arteries is greater than what is generally supposed, and it has been found on accurate measure- ment that the left is somewhat longer than the com- pound trunk of the right and arteria innommata; the former likewise being much more deeply situated than the latter, the one being a little more than an inch from the surface at its origin, and the other half-an-mch. From the curved direction of those vessels, and the com- paratively straight course of their correspondmg veins, which always lie on a plain anterior and interior to them, they may be very aptly compared to arcs of a circle, constituted by the artery, to which the veins form the subtending chords. In their first stages both vessels are surrounded by a nervous loop from the sympathetic (annulus of Vieusseus). Anomalies.—It may arise separately from the arch, either from the right or left extremity of the transverse portion, or even from the descending. Ihere may be809 BRANCHES OF SUBCLAVIAN. : also a common trunk on the left side, from whicli the two subclavians may spring, or where it arises from the 1 left angle the right usually passes to its own side, be- 1 hind the oesophagus and trachea, but sometimes between ; these two tubes, as we had an opportunity of observing ^ about six years ago in an aged female subject, and in 1 this case the vessel was of a more than ordinary size. • Generally speaking, the left subclavian is very regular iin its origin, but exceptions occasionally occur, where it i forms a common trunk with the right or left carotid, ithe latter being the more frequent arrangement. Collateral Branches.—These are, in its first stage, tthe vertebral, internal mammary, and thyroid axis; and lin its second, the superior intercostal and cervicalis pro- ifunda; in its third it normally gives off no branch. Vertebral arises from the upper and back part of ithe subclavian, and, ascending backwards and upwards, centers the foramen in the transverse process of the sixth ''cervical vertebra, and through the others in succession, rtill it reaches the axis, where it suddenly curves upr i-wards, backwards, and outwards, to pass through the ^elongated transverse process of the atlas, on reaching ithe upper surface of which, it bends backwards and in- wards to the triangular space on the back of the neck, ;iand here again changing its direction, it runs upwards, ['forwards, and inwards, perforating the posterior occipi- tto-atlantoid ligament and dura mater, and thus getting \withm the cranial cavity, approximates to its fellow, with which it unites at the lower part of the pons va- i :oIii to form the basilar trunk. Relations—Immediately after its origin it lies in a !r,riangular space, having internal to it the longus colli • ind pneumogastric nerve; externally, anterior scalenus imd phrenic; inferiorly, its own parent trunk; ante- ■luorly, mternal jugular vein and inferior thyroid artery; )OSteriorly,transverse process of seventh cervical verte- ■ttra, and a lymphatic gland; and internally and ante- uorly, mferior cervical ganglion of sympathetic. As it ontmues its course upwards through the foramina iu he transverse processes, it has anterior and posterior to U the intertransversalis muscles, the cervical nerves "merge behind it, and it is invested by a plexus from these ind the inferior ganglion of the sympathetic, whilst oneARTERIES AND VEINS. 810 sometimes two, veins accompany it. In its course back- wards and inwards, it runs between tlie superior oblique and posterior occipito-atloid ligament, below the occi- pital bone, and above the posterior half-arch of the atlas, which it deeply grooves, and from which it is se- parated by the ganglion of the suboccipital nerve, which lies inferior and internal to it. On the upper and back part of the neck it occupies a triangular space, bounded above by the superior oblique; below, by the inferior; behind, by the rectus capitis posticus major; and it is covered by the great occipital nerve, a quantity of areo- lar tissue, dense fascia, with complexus and trapezius. After perforating the ligament and dura mater, it runs between the first and second teeth of the liga- mentum denticulatum, the former of which separates it from the lingual and spinal accessory nerves, occasion- ally passing between the origins of the former being at this point closely applied to the side of the medulla oblongata. Remarks.—This artery may occasionally first enter the foramina of any of the transverse processes of the cer- vical vertebrae from the second to the sixth, but, we be- lieve, never the seventh; in its course through them being always slightly tortuous. On the left side the vessel is also crossed by the thoracic duct. Anovialies.—lhQ right is almost always normal, but the left often arises from the arch of the aorta, or occa- sionally may spring from the carotid. Great disparity has been observed in the size of the vessels of opposite Sides* Collateral Branches.—Some few small twigs which are thrown off in the neck, and which enter the spinal canal to communicate with the arteries of that region also occasionally the posterior meningeal, with anasto- motic twigs to the Qccipital and cervicalis profunda Those which are particularly named are, the anterior and posterior spinal and the inferior cerebellar. Anterior Spinal arises from the vertebral imme diately beneath its termination in the basilar; and, pass ing downwards and inwards, unites with its fellow of the opposite side, thus circumscribing a lozenge-shaped space on the front of the medulla oblongata. The com pound trunk thus formed continues its course downBRANCHES OF SUBCLAVIAN. 811 wards in the anterior median furrow of the cord, be- neath the thickened process of pia mater (membrana resplendens), and terminates inferiorly at the coccyx by anastomosing with branches of the middle and lateral sacral. In its descent it communicates with the deep cervical, vertebral, intercostal, and lumbar. Remarks.—It is very tortuous, presenting several di- latations and constrictions. Anomalies—It may arise as a single trunk from the basilar. Posterior Spinal arises from the back part of the vertebral, a little below the last, and having sent up a small filament to supply the fourth ventricle, it divides into two branches,—an internal, which descends along the margin of the posterior median furrow; and an exter- nal, which runs on the outer side of the posterior spinal nerves, anastomosing with each other frequently, and with the former as well as its fellow of the opposite side, ihey also communicate with the same arteries as the anterior spinal. Remarks—These branches are also tortuous, and rarely ot the same size on both sides. Anomalies.—Th^j frequently arise, at least one of them, from the inferior cerebellar. Inferior Cerebellar.—Generally large, arising from the vertebral just before its termination; it passes back- wards and inwards round the medulla oblongata, first between the filaments of origin of the ninth nerve, and then between the pneumogastric' and spinal accessory. It now enters the posterior median fissure of the cere- bellum, where it lies very close to that of the opposite side, and divides into two branches,—an internal, which continues its course to the upper surface of the cerebel- lum as far as the superior vermiform appendix, where it anastomoses with the superior cerebellar, from which branches pass inwards, with the velum interpositum, as far as the foramen commune anterius, to communicate rJ^]^^"'"^ perforating filaments from the circle of Willis ; and an external, which, winding round the outside of the cerebellum to its upper margin, unites with corresponding branches of the superior. Remarks.—ll might be almost stated as a rule thatARTERIES AND VEINS. 812 those arteries of opposite sides are always different in size, and sometimes one is found to be so small that it is ex- pended in supplying the medulla, when the other, which is commensurately larger, will be found to divide in the posterior cerebellar furrow for the usual distribution. Anomalies.—One or both often arise from the basilar. Basilar Artery Formed by the junction of the vertebral at the lower margin of the pons, and extend- ing upwards and forwards, to terminate at its anterior border. Relations Inferiorly, basilar process of occipital bone and dura mater; superiorly, pons varolii; and on either side, arachnoid canals, with sixth pair of nerves. Remarks.—These will be reserved for observations on the cerebral circulation. Anomalies.—We are aware of none, except that it may occasionally be deflected to one side. Collateral Branches.—Besides a number of capil- lary twigs to the pons, it also gives off the superior ce- rebellar and posterior cerebral. Superior Cerebellar.—Large branches which arise from the basilar, a quarter of an inch previous to its ter- mination, and, passing upwards and outwards between the crus cerebri and pons, then over the latter, behind the third nerve, and beneath the tentorium cerebelli and fourth nerve, each divides into two branches,—an ex- ternal, which turns outwards on the upper surface of the cerebellum to its free margin, where it anastomoses with the external division of the inferior cerebellar; and an internal, which passes inwards to the superior vermiform process to communicate with the internal branch of the same artery. A small twig is usually given off from the superior cerebellar,—the auricular, which, passing in a groove in the portio mollis, and be- neath the dura, enters the auditory meatus for the sup- ply of the cochlea and vestibule. Posterior Cerebral.—Likewise large; they arise from the termination of the basilar and in front of the third nerve, then, winding upwards and outwards around the crus cerebri and above the tentorium, they divide into two branches,—an internal, to anastomose Avith the callosal at the posterior extremity of that body;BRAKCHES OF SUBCLAVIAN. 813 and an external, to communicate with the middle cere- bral, and hemispheric branches of the anterior. Feniarks.—The divergence of these last-described branches forms a part of a remarkable arterial anasto- mosis at the base of the brain, known as the circle of V\ illis, or, as it should be more properly called, a hepta- gon, as It possesses seven distinct walls. Thus it is bounded posteriorly by the basilar trunk and posterior cerebral; laterally by the posterior communicatin<r and internal carotids; and anteriorly, by the anterio? communicating and anterior cerebral. Anomalies.—None, except a discrepancy in size, some- times very remarkable. General Remarks on the Cerelral Circulation.~The dif- ference in the mode of supply to this organ, as contrasted r u .° '''' ^o™Poi^ent tissues of the body, may be thus briefly stated:_l. Thegreat size ofthe vessels/hen considered relatively with the positively small amount ot matter to which they are distributed; 2. Their Ion? and tortuous course and transit through unyielding bony canals; 3. Ihe marked weakness of their walls •when within the cranial cavity; 4. The convergence of •two primary branches, constituting a trunk of dimi- .mshed caliber; 5 Their frequent and free inosculations; iand 6. Their peculiar mode of distribution to theneura 1 masses. ^^iai The strongest proof of the vital importance of this (organ may be deduced from the vast amount of nutri- tion which It receives, and pathology clearly shows that tthis volume is absolutely necessary both t^ the proper cdevelopment of its functions and its integrity as a com- iponent part of the entire animal system. But whUe mature has been thus solicitous in bestowing on it this apparent excess of nutrition, she has been equally anx- .lous to modify any injurious effects that mi^ght accrue ^from It, by deriving the stream from a remote source Iby causing the current to ascend against gravity and .Burrounding the containing tubes by osseous g^kles ^whlch constrains them in a great measure to transmit ae^-^y the same amount of blood at all times; to this may be added, likewise, their numerous curves, a means a7 ^irably calculated to diminish the impetuosity of the814 AETERIES AND VEINS. vital fluid by increasing friction. The convergence of the two vertebral arteries for the formation of the basilar would, on a cursory view, appear to imply a de- sire to increase, not to diminish, the force and rapidity of the circulation, but the obvious explanation of this arrangement may be thus simply stated,—that inasmuch as the entire weight of the brain is thrown upon this particular vessel, it is clear that unless some peculiar mechanism was employed, the blood would be incapable of overcoming the resistance thus entailed on it by com- pression, and more especially as the arterial tubes of this region are deficient in that elasticity which is their pre- dominant characteristics in other situations, both the external and middle coats being absolutely thinner and weaker The most remarkable inosculation that exists is that'of the circle of Willis, all danger from undue pressure being here guarded against by the subarachnoid fluid an unresisting medium in which the vessels are continually bathed. The pia mater forms the great ve- hicle for conducting the arterial ramifications for the nutrition of the organ; but it must be observed, that several large branches permeate the white substance tor the more complete supply of the grey. Thyroid Axis arises from the anterior and supe- perior part of the subclavian a little external to the ver- tebral and passes upwards and outwards lor about half-an-inch, and then terminates by dividing into its four branches. . delations.—Anteviorlj, integument, platysma fascia, sterno-mastoid, deep cervical fascia, and internal jugu- lar vein; and posteriorly, edge of scalenus and phrenic nerve. i • Remarks.—We have observed nothing very peculiar concerning this artery except its variable length. Anoinalies.-lt may arise from the second stage of the subclavian, or in common with the interna mammary, or it may have no existence at all, each of its branches, arisine independently from the subclavian. Collateral Branches.—Inferior thyroid, ascending cervical, transversalis colli, and transversalis humeri. Inferior Thyroid arises from the inner side oi th axis, passes upwards and inwards to the thyroid body.BRAKCHES OF SUBCLAVIAN. 815 and dividing into three branches, the most external anastomoses with the superior thyroid, the middle enters the gland for its supply, while the internal fol- lows the isthmus or connecting lobe, and commtmicates with its fellow. Relations.—Anteriorly, sheath of the vessels, inferior laryngeal and sympathetic nerve; and posteriorly, lon- gus colli and vertebral artery. ^ Remarhs.—This artery is always very variable in its size, which appears to be regulated by that of the su- perior thyroid. It also constantly gives off a small branch (inferior laryngeal), which accompanies the nerve of the same name for the supply of the muscles of the larynx. Anomalies.—It may arise either from the vertebral, common carotid, or subclavian, and may be sometimes double. In an instance Avhere the right subclavian arose from the descending portion of the arch of the aorta, and ran to its destination in front of the trachea, the inferior thyroid ascended directly in front of this tube, although its origin was regular from the thyroid axis. Ascending Cervical arises from the extremity of the axis, and, passing directly upwards, anastomoses with the vertebral and occipital. Relations—Anteriorly, deep cervical fascia and ster- no-mastoid; posteriorly, anterior scalenus; externally, phrenic nerve; and internally, internal jugular vein. Remarks.—We have never observed it absent, though occasionally it may be very small. Anomalies—It very constantly springs from the in- ferior thyroid, but it may arise from the transversalis colli or humeri, or from the subclavian itself Transversalis Colli or Posterior Scapular Generally a large branch, arising from the posterior wall of the axis; it passes at first backwards and upwards, till it arrives on a level with the superior angle of the scapula, when it bends downwards, parallel t°o its pos- terior border, and at its inferior angle anastomoses with the subscapular and circumflexus scapulaj. Relations.-Ki\tenor\y, sterno-mastoid, omo-hyoid trapezius, levator anguli scapulas, rhomboideus minor and major; posteriorly, anterior scalenus, phrenic nerveI 816 ARTERIES AND VEINS. brachial plexus, middle and posterior scaleni, splenius colli, and serratus posticus superior, Eemarks.—It will be recollected that this artery is found in the two posterior triangles of the neck, viz., in the apex of the lower, and base of the upper, in both situations being comparatively superficial, as it is covered by the skin and fascia only; and in its descent along the base of the scapula it is often found buried in the insertion of the serratus magnus. At its termina- tion it occupies the triangular interval, circumscribed by the trapezius above; the latissimus dorsi below, and posterior border of scapula externally. Anomalies.—It may arise by a common trunk with the transversalis humeri, or from the subclavian m its first, second, or third stages. Collateral Branches.—Two in number,—super- ficial cervical and spinal. , r .-u Superficial Cervical arises from the angle of the transversalis colli, as it bends downwards beneath the levator anguli scapulae, and ascends beneath the trape- zius, supplying it with the glands and areolar tissue, and anastomosing with the vertebral and occipital. Spinal—Generally a large branch, arising Irom the artery while it lies at the base of the scapula; it passes inwards, supplying the erectors of the spine, and com- municating Avith the posterior intercostals. Transversalis Humeri, or Suprascapular, arises, likewise, from the back part of the thyroid axis, passes downwards and backwards to the superior costa of the scapula, and entering the supraspinous iossa above the transverse ligament, and through the fibres of the omo- hyoid muscle, divides into two branches,-the superior supplying the supraspinatus, while the inferior winds downwards between the spine of the scapu a and edge of the glenoid cavity, and under the spino-glenoid liga- ment, supplying the infraspinatus muscle, and anasto- mosing with the circumflexus scapula. Eelations.-Anteriorly, sterno-mastoid f^^^^'f^J^' ternal jugular vein, clavicle, trapezius, and omo-hyo d posteriorly, scaleni, phrenic, and brachial plexus, with subclavian artery in its third stage. Remarks.-This vessel crosses the subclavian arteryBRANCHES OF SUBCLAVIAN. 817 in its second stage, but is separated from it by the an- terior scalenus and phrenic nerve; and nearly at the same point is crossed superficially by the external jugular vein, but divided from it by the cervical fascia. While lying in the posterior inferior triangle of the neck, it is generally concealed from view by the clavicle, to which, as well as to the subclavian vein, it is attached by a process of the deep fascia, and hence the idea enter- tained of its frequent absence. Anomalies.—It may arise in common with the trans- verse humeri from the subclavian, in either of its three stages; we have also observed it to arise from the axillary. Collateral Branches.—Only one, the SuPRA-ACROMiAL, which Springs from the artery while under the trapezius, passes outwards beneath that muscle to the acromion process, there anastomosing with the acromial thoracic and circumflex from the axillary. Internal Mammary arises from the inferior part of the subclavian, and, running downwards and inwards, along the outer margin of the sternum, enters the wall of the abdomen, between the xiphoid and costal at- tachments of the diaphragm, which are on either side of it, and the costo-xiphoid ligament, which is in front of it, insinuates itself into the back part of the sheath of the rectus, and, descending as low as the umbilicus, anas- tomoses with both epigastrics and the lumbar arteries. Relations—Anteriorly, phrenic nerve, clavicle, vena innominata, costal cartilages, intercostal muscles, costo- xiphoid_ligament, and rectus muscle; posteriorly, tri- angularis sterni, pleura, peritoneum, and posterior layer of internal oblique. Remarks—The position of the phrenic nerve to this vessel is not always constant, as we have observed it not only splitting, but likewise running behind it. In its course downwards it lies not quite a quarter of an inch from the edge of the sternum. Anomalies.—It may arise in common with the thyroid axis, or from the second or third stages of the subcla- vian, from the innominata, or even from the arch of the aorta. Collateral Branches—Thymic, mediastinal, comes 2nARTERIES AND VEINS. 818 nervi phrenici, intercostals, diaphragmatic, and ramus abdominalis. ■ Thymic arise from the artery as it enters the tho- rax ; they pass inwards, and supply the thymus gland, and loose areolar tissue, communicating with those of the opposite side. Mediastinal.—Small twigs that ramify on the pos- terior surface of the sternum, into which they like- wise send several filaments. Comes Nervi Phrenici arises opposite the farst rib; passes down in company with the phrenic nerve, on the side of the pericardium, to which it sends several twio-s, and, reaching the diaphragm, divides into two branches, which, encircling its cordiform tendon, form a zone around it, from which filaments are distributed to the muscular structure. Intercostals.—Generally five in number, ihey arise from the outer wall of the artery, opposite the five superior intercostal spaces, and passing outwards, at first between the pleura and internal layer of inter- costals, then perforating the latter, and lying between the external and internal, they run outwards along the inferior margin of the corresponding superior rib usually sending downwards a smaller branch, which winds along the upper edge of the inferior rib; they ter- minate by anastomosing with similar branches Ironi the superior intercostal and thoracic aorta. From these, and sometimes from the internal mammary itsell, branches are thrown off" to supply the integuments of the thorax and the two pectorals. , , , . .

Relations.—Anteriorly, pleura; posteriorly, neck of ribs, and first dorsal nerve; internally, dorsal ganglia; and externally, emergence of proper spinal nerves. Remarks.—We have occasionally observed this vessel to pass behind the neck of the first rib, and then coming forwards between it and the second to assume its proper position. Anomalies.—It may arise from the first stage of the sub- clavian ; from thevertebral, thyroidaxis, or deep cervical. Collateral Branches.—Anterior and posterior. Anterior or Intercostal consist of two on the left and three on the right side; they pass directly out- wards on the anterior costo-transverse ligament, then on the external layer of intercostals, and enter between the latter and internal, at the angle of the rib; a little beyond this point they each throw oif a small branch, which runs along the margin of the rib below, supply- ing the muscles iu front and behind it, while the supe- rior wind beneath the inferior edge of the rib above, but separated from it by the vein, and terminate by anastomosing with the mammary and branches from the axillary. Posterior Branches.—These pass backwards be- tween the transverse processes above and below; the bodies of the vertebra internally, and the costo-trans- verse ligament externally, and, piercing the erectors of the spine, which they supply, terminate in cutaneous fila- ments, which ramify in the integument over those muscles, anastomosing with each other. Deep Cervical arises close to the superior intercos- tal, and passes at first backwards, between the first rib and transverse process of the seventh cervical vertebra, then upwards and backwards, to terminate by anasto- mosing with the vertebral and occipital. Relations—Anteriorly, anterior scalenus, brachial plexus, and coinplexus ; posteriorly, middle and poste- rior scaleni and scmispinalis colli. Remarks.—We have observed it to pass between the sixth and seventh transverse processes. While lying between the scmispinalis colli and complexus, it is in 2 N 2820 ARTERIES AND VEINS. company with the posterior cervical plexus and poste- rior ju"-ular vein, and is always bound to the subjacent muscle°by a dense fascia, and in passing backwards it runs between the last cervical and first dorsal nerves. Anomalies.—It may arise from the subclavian, trans- versalis colli, or superior intercostal. ARTERIES OF UPPER EXTREMITY. Axillary Artery is the continued trunk of the sub- clavian, commencing opposite the inferior margm of the first rib, and, passing downwards, backwards, and out- wards, terminates in the brachial, at the lower margin of the latissimus dorsi and teres major. It is crossed above its centre by the pectoralis minor, and hence its division into three stages,-the first extending from the first rib to the upper margin of the pectoral; the second comprehending that portion which lies beneath the muscle; and the third reaching from its lower border to that of the latissimus dorsi and teres major.

The interior of the cavity, when cleaned of its contents, represents a cone with three sides, the apex corresponding to the coracoid process superiorly, and its base to the latissimus dorsi, teres major, and great pectoral, the interspace between the two iirst and last of these muscles being completed by the integument, fascia, and a few muscular bands stretched between their opposite margins, through which the branches of the intercosto-humeral nerves ramify in their course to reach the back and inner side of the arm. The boundaries of this space may be thus briefly stated:—Anteriorly, both pec- torals and ligamentum bicorne, the lesser pectoral, how- ever, only forming a partial covering, being deficient both- above and below; internally, ribs, intercostal muscles, and serratus magnus; and posteriorly and externally, subscapular, teres major, and latissimus dorsi. In its na- tural condition it is filled up by a quantity of lax watery areolar tissue, numerous glands, axillary artery and vein, with their branches, brachial plexus, and intercosto- humeral nerves. The axillary glands observe the fol- lowing arrangement, being divisible into four sets, the first is irregularly scattered through the cavity; the second being found on its posterior wall in company with the subscapular artery; the third on its anterior with the thoracica longa; and the fourth passes upwards with the axillary trunk itself and becomes continuous with those of the neck. This, accordingly, implies the existence of a communication between the cervical re- gion and the axilla, which may be thus shortly defined. The clavicle anteriorly diverges from the first rib pos- teriorly and internally as they pass outwards, leaving between them a triangular interval Avhich is bounded externally by the superior costa of the scapula and root of the coracoid process, and through this pass in order from within outwards,—subclavian vein, artery, Avith accompanying lymphatics, and brachial pie xus, oi'course including its supraclavicular branches. 'J'he inferior outlet ol' the axilla communicates with the brachial re- gion, and is close to the humerus, bounded in front by the insertion of the great pectoral; behind by the con- joined tendons of the latissimus dorsi and teres major-ARTERIES AND VEINS. 822 externally by the bone; and internally by the fascia, constituting the floor of the cavity prolonged on the inner aspect of the arm; through this pass the coraco- brachialis, both tendons of the biceps and axillary ar- tery, with its vein directly in front of it, and ultimate branches of the plexus investing it on all sides. Anomalies.—The axillary may divide into radial and ulnar in this space as high up as the inferior margin of the first rib, of which we last session saw an example, or in its centre or lower part. It may also bifurcate into two one of which will throw off all the axillary, and sometimes the brachial branches. We have also seen an instance of where it divided at the upper part of the space into two branches of nearly equal size, and united again at the lower part, the median nerve passing from behind forwards between them. Collateral Branches of the Axillary.—These are seven in number, and may be divided into lour internal, viz., thoracica acromialis, thoracica suprema, thoracica alaris, and thoracica longa; and three external, viz., anterior and posterior circumflex and subscapular. Thoracica Acromialis.—A thick, short trunk, ya- rvino- from a quarter to half-an-inch in length, ansmg from the front of the axillary, opposite the acromion process, and is bounded in the following manner:—Ex- ternally and superiorly, cephalic vein, as it curves around it to join the axillary; internally by the lat er vessel and below by the lesser pectoral. Between the deltoid and greater pectoral it divides into four branches—one of which passes upwards and outwards, beneath the former muscle, and along the margin of the triangular li^rament to the acromion process, where it anastomoses with the circumflex and transversalis humeri ; a second (thoracica humeraria), winds downwards and outwards between the deltoid and great pectoral in company with, but beneath, the cephalic vein, bends into the substance of the deltoid, and communicates with the circumflex, the third runs downwards and inwards along the upper border of the lesser pectoral to the serratus magniis, which it supplies, anastomosing with the "^"^"^^^^^ intercostals while the fourth, ^l^^/^^^'-y ^"^^^ 'vf reflected upwards and inwards over the ligamentum bi823 BRANCHES OF AXILLART. come, which it afterwards perforates for the supply of the subclavius muscle. Thoracica Suprema.—Smaller than the last; it runs downwards and inwards between the two pectorals, to both of which it gives numerous branches, and ulti- mately anastomoses on the Avail of the thorax with the mammary and intercostals. Thoracic^ Alares.—Usually numerous, but small; they spring from the inner side of the axillary beneath the lesser pectoral, and are distributed to the glands and areolar tissue, communicating with each other. Thoracica Longa, or External Mammary, arises below the tendon of the lesser pectoral, and passes down- wards and inwards, and terminates on the side of the thorax by anastomosing with the mammary and inter- costal. Relations.—Anteriorly, greater pectoral; posteriorly, serratus magnus; and superiorly, lesser pectoral. Remarks.—Those four thoracic branches are very va- riable in size, particularly the alar and long thoracic, the latter being larger in the female, from supplying the mammary gland. Anomalies are more frequent in those branches than in any others in the body; in fact they are very rarely regular. The two first almost always arise in common, or the entire of them may spring from a common trunk, ' while the alar thoracic may be either single, or consist of two, three, or four. Anterior Circumflex.—Always small, as contrasted with the posterior; it arises from the axillary, opposite the lower edge of the subscapular tendon, and passes directly outwards, as far as the bicipital groove, Avhere it divides into three branches,—an ascending, which enters the joint with the long tendon of the biceps for its supply; a descending, which passes downwards, to anastomose with the profunda; and a middle, which continues its course, to communicate with the posterior circumflex. > Relations.— Anteriorly, external cutaneous nerve, outer head of median, coraco-brachialis, and short and long heads of biceps; posteriorly, neck of humerus.ARTEEIES AND VEINS. 824 Anomalies.—It may arise in common with the poste- rior, or from the long thoracic or subscapular. Posterior Circumflex.—Large; arises close to the preceding, and, passing backwards and outwards through a quadrilateral space, behind the joint, divides into three sets of branches,—scapular, to anastomose with the suprascapular; articular, to supply the joint; and muscular, to the deltoid, anastomosing with the ante- rior circumflex. Helations.—As it winds backwards: above, the capsu- lar ligament and circumflex nerve ; below, the teres major and latissimus dorsi; externally, neck of hume- rus; and internally, long head of triceps. ^ftoni«/2e5.—Frequently from the subscapular, ante- rior circumflex, or long thoracic; occasionally from the superior profunda, where its course to reach its destma- tion is peculiar, no longer passing through the quadri- lateral space just described, but through another below the axillary cavity, triangular in shape, and bounded as follows: Above, teres major and latissimus dorsi;ex- ternally, shaft of humerus; and internally, long head of triceps. . Subscapular.—The largest branch of the axillary, arising opposite the lower margin of the tendon of the same name, and passing downwards, backwards, and m- Avards, for about an inch, divides into two branches,—an anterior or proper subscapular, and a posterior or cir- cumflexus, or dorsalis scapulas. Eelations.—Antev'wrly, internal cutaneous, ulnar and musculo-spiral nerves, with the subscapular and axillary vein; posteriorly, tendon of subscapular. Anterior or Continued Trunk.—Passes doAvnwards and backwards, along the inferior margin of the sub- scapular muscle, and reaches the inferior angle ot the scapula, where it anastomoses with the posterior scapu- lar and dorsalis scapulas. . CiRcuMFLExas or Dorsalis Scapul.e.—From its size the proper continuation of the subscapular trunk; it l,assc.s backwards through a triangular space, bounded externally by the long bend of the triceps; above by the teres minor; and below by the teres major and Jatissi-825 BRACHIAL ARTERY. mus dorsi; winding now upwards, into the infraspinous fossa, and lying close to the bone, it divides into two branches,—an anterior, to anastomose beneath the spine Avith the infraspinous of the suprascapular, and a pos- terior, which descends to communicate with the pos- terior scapular and continued trunk of the subscapular. Remarks.—The point of division of the subscapixlar into the two terminal branches just described is very variable, ranging from a quarter of an inch to an inch and a half, and although we have followed the general rule in making the posterior or circumflexus scapulae pass through the triangular interval, of which -we have given the boundaries in the preceding paragraph, still our experience would lead us to state that such is rarely if ever its true course, as the vessel pursues its course backwards close to the inferior costa of the sca- pula, to which it is united by a dense fibrous arch, which protects it from the pressure of the teres minor, above and not below which it is situated. Anomalies.—The subscapular may arise from the pos- terior circumflex, and occasionally from the long thoracic. Brachial Artery.—The direct continuat'ion of the axillary, commencing at the inferior margin of thelatis- simus dorsi and teres major, and passing downwards, forwards, and outAvards, terminates a little above the coronoid process of the ulna, by dividing into radial and ulnar. Relations—Anteriorly, inner margin of biceps, me- dian nerve, and semilunar fascia, which separates it from the median basilic vein and internal cutaneous nerve in the triangular hollow at the bend of the elboAv; pos- teriorly, long head of triceps, but separated from it by the musculo-spiral nerve and superior profunda, short head of the same muscle, coraco-brachialis, and bra- chialis anticus; internally, brachial aponeurosis, inter- nal cutaneous, and, lower down, median nerve, with ba- silic vein; and externally, coraco-brachialis above, and median nerve in the middle cellular interval between biceps and brachialis anticus; and iuferiorly, tendon of biceps. Remarks.—it will be observed that the median nerve holds three relations to the artery, being at first slin-htly 2 N 3 °1 826 ARTERIES AND VEINS. to its outer side, but, crossing it anteriorly, aboiit the middle of the arm, it ultimately becomes internal to it. Two veins likewise accompany this vessel, the one, the larger, lying internal and posterior to it, the other, the smaller, external and anterior, while numerous cross branches unite them to each other. Dr. Corbett, in his work on the Arteries, has draAvn a very fair analogy between this artery, with its muscular and fascial rela- tions, and the femoral, as it occupies the middle third of the thigh, or Hunter's canal. Opposite the flexure of the joint the brachial artery lies in a triangular space, which may be exposed by removing the integu- ment, siiperficial fascia, with the external and internal cutaneous nerves, basilic, cephalic, and median basilic and median cephalic veins, and ultimately the semilunar fascia of the biceps, which constitutes its operculum or covering. This space is bounded externally by the su- pinator longus; internally by the pronator teres; supe- riorly by the belly of the brachialis anticus; posteriorly by the tendon of the latter muscle, with that of the biceps; and anteriorly by the semilunar aponeurosis. It contains three very important parts, which are from without inwards:—The tendon of biceps, brachial artery, and median nerve; but it should be remembered that still more externally, between the supinator longus and brachialis anticus, the musculo-spiral nerve and artery are situated; and more internally, beneath the pronator teres, is the anastomotica magna, communicating witli the anterior ulnar recurrent, while m the apex ot tbe space are found the mediana profunda vein, radial and ulnar arteries, with interosseous trunk. Anomalies—The brachial artery may be double, de- pending on a high bifurcation of the axillary, and in these cases its representative branch is generally the radial, which takes its usual course, while the ulnar runs more directly towards the internal condyle. b.x- ceptions to this rule will, however, occur, and then the snialler trunk or radial, which lay internal to the infe- rior third of the arm, will cross under and become ex- ternal to the larger or ulnar, and where this high bifur- cation does exist, the two branches usually communicate by a cross branch at the bend of the elbow. The bra-827 BRANCHES OF BRACHIAL. chial may also separate into its two divisions, at some distance either above or below the coronoid process, and it should likewise be borne in mind that the median nerve often crosses behind and not in front of the artery. Collateral Branches of the Brachial.—Several to the muscles clothing the humerus, and one usually large as the nutritious artery of the bone; those which have received names are,—the superior profunda, infe- rior profunda, and anastomotica magna. Superior Profunda—The largest branch; arises from the brachial immediately below the tendons of the latissimus dorsi and teres major; passes backwards and outwards in company with the musculo-spiral nerve between the short and long head of the triceps; then between that muscle and the bone, where it divides into two branches,—an olecranoid or posterior, and a muscu- lo-spiral or anterior; the latter winds round the humerus, which it grooves, and, dividing into two branches, of which one perforates the external intermuscular sep- tum, reaches the cleft between the supinator longus and brachialis anticus, where it anastomoses with the an- terior radial recurrent, while the second descends be- hind the external condyle to communicate with the posterior interosseous recurrent; the olecranoid branch passing nearly vertically downwards, lying in the sub- stance of the triceps, to the same point, where its anasto- mosis is similar. Anomalies—It may arise in common with the pos- terior circumflex, the trunk of origin being in this in- stance from the brachial, or it may spring from a branch common to it and the inferior profunda. Inferior Profunoa Smaller than the last; arises from the brachial opposite the insertion of the coraco- brachialis, and passing at first downwards and back- wards on the brachialis anticus, and between the ulnar nerve and brachial artery, perforates with the former the internal intermuscular septum, then a few fibres of the triceps, and arrives at the groove between the in- ternal condyle and olecranon process, between the two heads of the flexor carpi ulnaris, and anastomoses with the posterior ulnar recurrent. Anomalies.—It arises generally in common with the828 ARTERIES AND VEINS. nutritious artery of the bone, and sometimes -with the superior profunda, Anastomotica Magna.—Variable in size; arises about an inch and a half above the internal condyle, and passes directly inwards under the median nerve, and on the brachialis anticus; and on reaching the inner edge of the latter divides into two branches,—a descending and transverse: the former passing downwards under the pronator teres, and on the brachialis anticus anas- tomoses with the anterior ulnar recurrent; while the latter, piercing the internal intermuscular septum, com- municates with the inferior profunda. Anomalies.—It may arise from the brachial by two distinct trunks, each of which will then pursue the course indicated above. Radial Artery must in direction be considered as the direct continuation of the brachial, though it is always inferior in size to the ulnar, with which it arises in common a little above the coronoid process, and pass- ing at first vertically downwards as far as the upper edge of the annular ligament (first stage or vertical), then winds backwards to the dorsum of the hand, and ultimately through the first interosseous space to its palmar aspect (oblique stage), where it divides into its ultimate branches. Relations—First ^'to^/e—Anteriorly, integument, las- cia twio-s of external cutaneous nerve and intermus- cular septum; posteriorly, tendon of biceps, supinator brevis and branches of musculo-spiral nerve, tendon ot pronator teres, radial attachment of flexor sublimis, tendon of the flexor pollicis longus and pronator qua- dratus; externally, supinator longus and radial nerve for its upper two-thirds; and internally, pronator teres tor its upper third, and flexor carpi radialis lor its two inferior. ^ . ^ ^ Second ^tor/e.—Posteriorly, tendons of extensor ossis metacarpi, primi intcrnodii, and, after crossing the in- ixn-ular space intercepted between those tendons, secun- di ^intcrnodii pollicis, ultimately the abductor mdicis, anteriorly, external lateral ligament, back of caq^us, occasionally tendon of extensor carpi radialis longior, and adductor pollicis.BRANCHES OF RADIAL. 829 Remarhs—The radial nerve is in communication with its artery only in the upper and middle thirds of its vertical stage, in both being external to it, but more remote in the former, but we will see that it again gets into relation w^ith it in its oblique stage on the back of the carpus, where the vessel lies in a perfect triangular space, bounded externally by the extensor ossis meta- carpi and primi internodii; internally by" the extensor secundi internodii pollicis; superiorly by the lower edcre of the posterior annular ligament, while the apex "is formed by the convergence of the several tendons to their insertion into the thimib. Here the vessel is most superficial, being covered only by the integument, fascia, and the filaments of the radial nerve, until it dips be- tween the first and second metacarpal bones, and be- tween the heads of the origin of the abductor indicis, and divides under that muscle, and on the adductor pollicis. Anomalies.—It may arise from the axillary or from the brachial, either higher or lower than its ordinary position. Collateral Branches.—In addition to the several muscular branches in its course down the fore-nrm, it gives off the anterior radial recurrent, superficialis voLt3, anterior and posterior carpal, dorsalis manu, princeps pollicis, radialis indicis, and ramus profunda or communicans. Anterior Radial Recurrent arises from the radial immediately after it comes off from the brachial; it passes at first directly outwards between the supinator l(5ngus and brevis, divides into two branches,~an as- cendmg, which passes upwards to the clei't between the supmator longus and brachialis anticus to anastomose with the musculo-spiral branch of the superior pro- funda, and an inferior, to supply the radial extensors of the fore-arm. Superficialis VoLyK.—Variable in size; arises about an inch above the annular ligament, over which, and through the tendinous origins of the muscles of the thumb. It passes to anastomose with ihe superficial branch of the ulnar, to form the superficial arch of arteries. Anterior CARPAL—Extremely small; it arises oppo-ARTERIES AND VEINS. 830 site the styloid process of the radius, and passes directly inwards under the flexor tendons, which it supplies, and anastomoses with a similar branch from the ulnar, interosseous, median, and twigs from the deep palmar arch. .11., Posterior Carpal.—About the same size as the last; arising from the radial as it lies in the triangular space already described, passes inwards beneath the extensor tendons, to which it distributes twigs, and anastomoses with the carpal from the ulnar, interosseous, and perfo- rating arteries from the deep palmar arch. Dorsalxs Manu.—Variable in size, but always pre- sent- it also arises in the triangular space, and, passing inwards along the bases of the metacarpal bones as far as the fifth, forms a species of arch, from the convexity of which it throws off three or four branches, which are distributed to the interossei, anastomosing with others from the deep palmar arch. Prinoeps Pollicis. —Always comparatively large; arising from the extremity of the radial, as it les be- tween the abductor indicis and outer head ot the pol- licis brevis, and passing out between those two muscles as far as the base of the first phalanx, it divides into two branches, one of which runs on the outer, and the other on the inner, side of the thumb, as far as the middle of the first phalanx, where, uniting, they form an arch, from the convexity of which numerous filaments are given off for the supply of the tactile papillae of the fan- ner while from either of its sides a small branch is de- tached, which, winding backwards and anastomosing at the root of the nail, forms a secondary arch for the supply of its matrix. .,11^ a Radialis Indicis arises in common with the last, and runs forwards also between the abductor indicis and adductor pollicis, and reachmg the base of he fiist phalanx of the index finger, anastomoses with the prin- cep pollicis by a cross branch; also with the superfici branch of the ulnar, completing in the absence ot the superficialis vola3 the formation of the superficial palnia arch continuing its course afterwards along the radial sSe of the indef finger, it terminates at the middle 0 s last phalanx in uniting with the digital branch ofULNAR ABTEET. 831 the superficial arch, sending its twig backwards to form the ungual arch. Eamus Profunda, or Communicans.—Very large; also arising in common with the two latter; it turns directly mwards across the palm of the hand, over the heads of the metacarpal bones and interossei muscles, and under the adductor pollicis, piercing its attachment to the third metacarpal bone, and terminates by anastomosing with the profunda division of the ulnar, thus constitut- ing the deep palmar arch. Anomalies—It may arise from the axillary in any part of its course, or it may spring from the brachial, m any part ot the arm, and in either of these instances It may run over the semilunar fascia of the biceps, or It may be occasionally so small as to reach only as far as the annular ligament; the ulnar in this case supply- ing by Itself the palmar region. _ Ulnar Artery.—Larger than the radial, but arisincr m common with it, first passing downwards and in- wards, and then vertically downwards, to terminate on ■ the inner side of the palm of the hand, by dividing into I two branches,—a superficial and deep. Relations—Anteriorly, pronator teres, median nerve, 1 flexor carpi radialis, palmaris longus, flexor digitorum .subhmis, and, at the wrist joint, expansion from flexor carpi ulnaris; posteriorly, brachialis anticus, flexor pro- ttundus, ulnar nerve, but slightly internal to it, and an- nular ligament; internally, ulnar nerve, but at some distance from it m its upper third, and flexor carpi ul- naris; and externally, junction of flexor sublimis and rproiundus. /^mar/L-5.-This artery is very deeply situated above, ■ where it is covered by nearly all the flexors of the fore- arm but in the inferior third it is quite superficial. Anomahes.~Uke the radial, it may arise in the seve- rral positions described under the head of that vessel and nmay also descend superficial to the fascia of the biceps FPress^'''" ^^'^ ^^^blm Medical Collateral Branches.—Several muscular, while those which have received distinct names are, the ante- nor aod posterior ulnar recurrent, interosseous, median832 ARTERIES AND VEINS. anterior and posterior carpal, with the superficial and deep, its terminal branches. Anterior Ulnar Recurrent.—Very small, arising from the front of the ulnar immediately below the bifur- cation of the brachial; it passes upwards and inwards on the brachialis anticus, and under the pronator teres, and anastomoses with the anastomotica magna. Posterior Ulnar Recurrent.—Larger than the preceding, with which it often arises in common; it runs upwards and backwards, between the flexor sub- limis and flexor carpi ulnaris, anastomosing between the two heads of the latter, and under the ulnar nerve with the inferior profunda and anastomotica magna. Interosseous.—A large trunk, about three-quarters of an inch in length, arising from the back part of the ulnar, about an inch below its origin; it passes down- wards, backwards, and outwards, as far as the tubercle of the radius, where it divides into two branches,—an anterior and posterior. Anterior Interosseous extends from the upper ed"-e of the ligament of the same name to the pronator quadratus, where it terminates in supplying that mus- cle, and in sending a branch backwards to communicate with the posterior interosseous, posterior carpal, and perforating. Relations.—Anteriorly, flexor sublimis; posteriorly, interosseous ligament; externally, flexor poUicis; and internally, flexor profundus. , , , i Posterior Interosseous passes backwards through a quadrilateral foramen; bounded superiorly by the oblique ligament; inferiorly by the interosseous; and on either side by the radius and ulna. Arriving now between the superficial and deep extensors, it breaks up into a lash of branches for the supply of those muscles, sending one large branch upwards, between the anconeus and supinator brevis, to anastomose with the musculo-spiral and vertical branches of the superior profunda and ano- ther downwards to communicate on the back ot the carpus with the anterior interosseous, posterior carpal, and perforating from the deep palmar arch. _ Median BRANCiL-Alwaysconstant, but very variable in size; arising sometimes from the ulnar, and sometimes833 PALMAR ARCHES. from the interosseous trunk; it descends in company with the median nerve, and terminates by anastomosing with the same as the preceding. Anterior CARPAL.—Very small, arising, as its name implies, opposite the carpus, and, passing outwards, com- municates with a similar branch from the radial beneath the flexor tendons. Posterior Carpal comes off nearly opposite to the last, winds outwards on the back of the carpus, and un- der the extensor tendons, and anastomoses with the posterior carpal of the radial. Eamus Superficialis is one of the terminal divisions of the ulnar, arising immediately below the annular liga- ment; it passes at flrst downwards, and then winds out- wards, and terminates by anastomosing with the super- ficialis volfe, in order to form the superficial palmar arch. _ Eamus Profunda is the second terminal branch; it sinks between the abductor and flexor minimi dir^iti, crosses over the bases of the metacarpal bones and'^in- terossei muscles, to communicate with the profunda of the radial, and thus form the deep palmar arch. PALMAR Arches are two in number,—superficial and deep; the former, as we have already observed, is formed by the ramus superficialis of the ulnar, which gives it its greatest supply of blood, and the superfi- cialis volffi of the radial, or where this is absent, by the radialis indicis. The convexity of the arch thus consti- tuted is directed downwards and slightly inwards, point- ing to the interval between the little and ring fingers and it corresponds very nearly to the transverse cleft which IS visible in the palm of every individual. -SetewTzs.—Anteriorly, integument, palmar fascia and a variable quantity of granular fat; posteriorly' flexor tendons, with the digital branches of the median nerve, the flattened expansion of which lies superior to it, or within its curve. CoLLATEUAL BRANCHES—From its convexity, only four in number, rarely five, where the radialis indicis is absent; they are called digital; of these the most inter- nal is the smallest, and, passing downwards and inwards runs along the ulnar side of the little finger, as far as Its last phalanx; the second is larger, and descends to834 ARTERIES AND VEINS. the cleft between the little and ring fingers, and bifur- cating, supplies their opposed surfaces; the third pur- sues the same course to the cleft between the ring and middle fingers, and divides for their adjacent aspects; while the fourth, running downwards to the cleft be- tween the middle and index fingers, likewise subdivides, to be distributed in a similar manner; the arterial supply of the thumb and half the index finger being completed by the radial is indicis and princeps pollicis. Deep Palmar Arch. — Formed by the profunda branches of both radial and ulnar arteries, and it difi'ers from the superficial in being smaller, more transverse, and situated much nearer the carpus. Relations.—Anteriorly, superficial and deep flexors, origin of adductor pollicis, and deep process of palmar fascia, which separates it from the superficial arch; pos- teriorly, heads of metacarpal bones and interossei muscles. Collateral Branches.—Anterior or digital, pos- terior or perforating, and superior or carpal. Anterior or Digital.—Generally three or four in number; they arise from the convexity of the arch, and run forwards along the interosseal spaces, and at the clefts between the fingers turn upwards, and anastomose with the digital branches of the superficial palmar arch, before their division. Posterior or Perforating.—Similar in number to the preceding, arising from the deep surface of the arch; they pass backwards, piercing the interossei muscles, which they supply, then ascend to the back of the carpus, where they anastomose with the interos- seous and carpal. Superior or Carpal.—Two or three small twigs, which ascend from the concavity of the arch, beneath the anterior annular ligament, to anastomose with thp anterior interosseous and anterior carpal. Anomalies of the Arches.—The superficial is sometiniea constituted by the ulnar alone, dividmg into the ordi- nary number of digital branches, or, as we have betore observed, by its union with the radialis indicis. ihe deep arch is sometimes formed by the radial only, the proiunda of the ulnar being so small as scarcely to be said to give it any blood. With respect to the use ot835 ABDOMINAL AORTA. the two arches in the hand, it appears to be to obviate the effects of pressure, which in its grasping motions would have a tendency to cut olf its arterial supply, if it was dependent solely on the blood from its superficial source. Abdominal Aorta is a direct continuation of the thoracic, which, descending between the crura of the diaphragm, through the tendinous aortic opening to the left side of the azygos and thoracic duct, may be said to become abdominal at the inferior margin of the twelfth dorsal vertebra, the latter stretching from this point to the left side of the body of the fourth lumbar, where it bifurcates into the common iliac. Relations—Anteriorly, tendinous arch of diaphragm, posterior thick margin of liver, ascending layer of trans- verse mesocolon, solar plexus, celiac axis, pancreas, formation of vena porta?, superior mesenteric artery, inferior transverse portion of duodenum, left renal vein, root of mesentery, inferior mesenteric artery, and descend- ing layer of transverse mesocolon; posteriorly, left crus of diaphragm, left side of vertebral column, with its con- necting media, receptaculum chyli, left lumbar veins, and middle sacral artery; to the right side above, right crus of diaphragm, thoracic duct, vena azygos and lobu- lus Spigelii of liver, and below the vena cava ascendens; to the left, the left crus of the diaphragm, semilunar ganglion and sympathetic nerve. Remarks—It will be observed that although the aorta may be said generally to lie on the left side of the vertebral column, it approximates to the mesial line, above and below, so as to present a slight concavity towards the right side. Anomalies.—Variable only as far as its point of bifur- cation exists, as it may be either higher up or lower down than the point indicated. Collateral Branchus—These have been divided into those which arise singly, as the cajliac axis, su- perior and inferior mesenteries, and middle sacral, and into those which arise in pairs, as the phrenic, cap- sular, renal, spermatic, and lumbar; their order of origin from above downwards being:—i. Phrenic, ii. Cajliac axis; IK. Superior mesenteric; iv. Capsular; v. Renal;836 ARTERIES AND VEINS. VI. Spermatic; vii. Inferior mesenteric; viii. Lumbar; and IX. Middle sacral. I. Phrenic.—Very variable in size; arise from the aorta; immediately below its tendinous arch, and pass upwards and outwards, each in front of their correspond- ing crus, the right behind the cava, and the left behind the oesophagus, and on reaching the sides of the cordi- form tendon they divide into two branches,—an exter- nal, which passes outwards, to anastomose with the lower intercostals; and an internal, which runs iuAvards towards the xiphoid cartilage, to communicate with the internal mammary. Immediately after its origin the phrenic almost constantly sends down a branch to the suprarenal capsule, to anastomose with its arteries and with the renal. Anomalies. They may arise by a common branch from the parent trunk, or from the celiac axis, or oc- sionally from the renal. II. Celiac Axis A thick, short trunk, about half- an-inch in length; arises from the left side of the aorta, from which it stands out at nearly a right angle, oppo- site the first lumbar vertebra. Relations.—Above, tendinous arch of diaphragm; be- low, pancreas, which separates it from the superior me- senteric artery; in front, concave margin of stomach and lesser omentum; to either sides corresponding crura, semilunar ganglia, and suprarenal capsules, with, in addition on the right and superiorly, the lobulus Spigelii of the liver, whilst it is encircled on all sides by branches of the solar plexus. Collateral Branches.—Coronary or gastric, he- patic, and splenic. Coronary or Gastric—The smallest of the three; it passes upwards and towards the left side, as far as tb cardiac orifice of the stomach, where it throws off large branch, oesophageal, which ascends on that tub to anastomose with similar twigs from the thoraci aorta; also some branches to the great extremity of t stomach. Having given off these, it next takes a r current direction downwards and to the right sid between the layers of the lesser omentum, anastomosing near the pylorus with the superior pyloric, from theBRANCHES OF AORTA. 837 hepatic, thus constituting an arch, from the convexity of which branches are detached for the supply of both the anterior and posterior surface of the stomach, communicating with similar offsets from the epiploic arteries. Hepatic—This is much larger than the preceding, and extends from the celiac axis as far as the transverse fissure of the liver, but because in its course it presents a well-marked angle, it has been divided into two stages,—a transverse, running directly to the right side, nearly as far as the ductus communis choledochus; and a vertical, from the latter point to within an inch of the transverse fissure, where it divides into two branches,— a right and left, which enter the extremities of the lat- ter, to be distributed to the hepatic structure as vagi- nal, interlobular, and lobular branches. Relations—First Stage.—Ant&ciovlj, pyloric extremity of stomach and lesser omentum; posteriorly, rio-ht crus of the diaphragm, semilunar ganglion, vena ports; and cava, crossing likewise the azygos and thoracic duct, between the crus and aorta; inferiorly, upper margin of pancreas; and superiorly, lobulus Spigelii and foraraen of Win slow. Second Stage.—Between the layers of the lesser omen- tum to the left side of the duct, and in front of the porta. Anomalies.—It may arise separately from the aorta, or from the superior mesenteric, and the left frequently from the coronary. Collateral Branches—Superior pyloric, gastro- duodenalis, and cystic. Superior Pyloric—Generally small; mayarise before or after, and sometimes from the gastro-duodenalis; it curves downwards and backwards, between the layers of the lesser omentum, and anastomoses with the coronary Gastro-duodenalis.—Very large, arising from the angle of division between the transverse and vertical stages of the hepatic, and divides at the upper edge of the pancreas into gastro-epiploica dextra and pancrea- tico-duodenalis. Relations.—ATvtQTior^j, superior transverse portion of duodenum; posteriorly, right crus and vena portee; and to the right side, ductus communis choledochus.838 ARTERIES AND VEINS. Gastro-epiploica Dextra.—Apparently the conti- nued trunk; it runs downwards and to the leftside, be- tween the layers of the great omentum, and along the con- vex margin of the stomach, inosculating with the gastro- epiploica sinistra from the splenic, while from the arch thus formed branches are given off to the anterior and posterior surfaces of that organ, as well as to the glands of the omentum. Pancreatico-duodenalis—Smaller than the preced- ing; it passes at first downwards, between the head of thepai^creas and vertical portion of duodenum, in front of the ductus communis choledochus, then winds be- tween the inferior transverse portion and lower edge of the pancreas, and ultimately, after supplying both these latter structures, anastomoses with the siiperior HlGSGIltGnC.

An exceedingly small branch, which may arise either from the hepatic trunk or its right division; it runs downwards, forwards, and to the right side, be- tween the cystic and right hepatic ducts, and, dividing into two branches, one is distributed to the coats of the gall-bladder, and the other to the tissue of the liver beneath it. , , -, i i Splenic —The largest of the three branches, remark- able for its tortuosity; it passes to the left side, and slightly upwards to within an inch and a halt ol tlie hvlus of the spleen, where it divides into five or six branches, which are distributed to that organ (see its Anatomy). • -4. Eelations.-Anteviovly, and slightly grooving it, up- per margin of pancreas; posteriorly, left crus, semi- lunar ganglion, and psoas muscle, with its own vein, but the latter is slightly inferior to it. Anomalies.—It may arise separately from the aorta. Collateral Branches.—Lesser and greater pancrea- tic, gastro-epiploica sinistra, and vasa brevia. Lesser piNCREATic.-Small, usually four or five in number, for the supply of tins organ.

Vasa Brevia.—Short, thick branches, which run between the splenic omentum, and supply the large ex- tremity of stomach. Eemarks.—All the branches of the celiac axis, with their subdivisions, are remarkable for their free inoscu- lations, so much so that it is often difficult to determine where the one commences and the other terminates, and hence is apparently the cause why such an extreme va- riation exists in the size of the anastomosing branches, the rule of compensating power, in cases of deficiency in capacity m either, being here remarkably applied in the augmented volume of either one or the other. m._ Superior Mesenteric Artery arises from the left side of the aorta, opposite the second lumbar verte- bra, below the pancreas, which separates it from the celiac axis, and above the inferior transverse portion of the duodenum and left renal vein; it descends at first downwards, forwards, and towaifls the left side slightly, and then, arching across the lower part of the abdomen' terminates in the right iliac fossa in its ilio-colic branch. Collateral Branches—1. A series of branches to small mtestines; 2. Colica media; 3. Colica dextra: and 4. Ilio-colic. _ 1- Small Intestinal BRANCHEs.—Fifteen or sixteen in number, springing from the convexity of the arch, and passing outwards and downwards between the layers of the mesentery, for about two or three inches, when each bifurcates, the secondary branches anastomosing with : similar ones from the arteries above and below, this i process being repeated two, three, or four times till they ! reach the small intestine, where, terminating in slender ; filaments which form loops around it, they are distri- i buted to the muscular tunic of the gut. 2. Colica Media—Large; arises from the superior I mesenteric immediately after its commencement, and 1 passing downwards and forwards, between the layers of !the transverse mesocolon to within an inch of the transARTERIES AND VEINS. 840 verse colon, it divides into two branches, right and left,^ the former anastomosing with the ascending branch of j the colica dextra, and the latter with that of the colica , sinistra, the first arch supplying the hepatic, and the ' second the splenic, flexure of the colon. _ j 3. Colica Dextra arises from the concavity of the ' artery a little below its centre; it passes downAvards and towards the right side, beneath the right lumbar mesocolon, and dividing into two branches, the superior ascends to anastomose with the right of the colica media, while the inferior descends to communicate with the ilio-colic, their arch supplying branches to the lower part of the ascending colon. 4. Ilio-colic—Eeally the termination of the mesen- teric itself, which, bifurcating, anastomoses below with one of the small branches from its convexity, and above with the colica dextra, and it is distributed principally to the termination of the ilium, cagcum, aud veripitorm process. . • • ^ ^i.

IV Capsular or Suprarenal.—Extremely small, arisino- from the sides of the aorta opposite the celiac axis - "they pass outwards over the corresponding crura, and 'are distributed to the suprarenal bodies, anasto- mosing with the renal and phrenic. V Renal.—Very large; they pass out nearly at a richt angle from the sides of the aorta, and about an inch from the hilus of the kidney brenk up into four or live branches, which enter the substance of that organ (see , Anatomy of Kidney). • w „^ ipft Relations—Eisht side-.-Anteriorly, right and left renal veins and cava; posteriorly crus o d^jplj^a^ psoas, and ureter.

SPERMATic-Long slender branches, -ising from the front of the aorta, below the renal, and extendingBRANCHES OF ABDOMINAL AORTA. 841 downwards as far as the scrotum, where they terminate by dividing into two, one for the epididymis, and another tor the testicle, anastomosing with the cremasteric from the deep epigastric, and the deferential from the umbi- lical. Ihey are divided into two stages,—an abdominal and scrotal. Relations First Anteriorly, peritoneum, ure- ter, last coil of the ilium on the right, and sigmoid flexure on the left; posteriorly, psoas muscle and outer edge of the external iliac artery. In this stage the rio-ht may lie either before or behind the cava, and in leaving the abdominal cavity, which they do through the in- ternal ring, they both pass between the vas deferens and epigastric artery, but separated from the latter by one 01 its own venaj comites. In its second stage it descends through the oblique inguinal canal, behind the spermatic veins and in front of the cord, escapes through the ex- ternal ring and runs downwards over the front of the pubis to the upper part of the epididymis, where it divides as already explained,_the testicular branch en- tering the testicle at i ts upper part, and passing between the layers of the mediastinum testis, is distributed by fine_ filaments to the septa of the organ, forming the txinica vasculosa of Sir A. Cooper, while the second is devoted to the supply of the epididymis.

Arteria Sigmoidea arises below the last, and passes downwards and outwards towards the left iliac fossa be- neath the peritoneum, and divides into two branches,— a superior to anastomose with the colica sinistra, and an inferior with the superior hsemorrhoidal, their loops of communication supplying the lower part of the descend- ing colon and sigmoid flexure. Superior HiEMORRHOiDAL,—The terminal branch of the inferior mesenteric; it passes downwards, backwards, and inwards, beneath the peritoneum, and over the psoas, ureter, common iliac artery and vein, and, enter- ing the meso-rectum, descends on the back part of that viscus to where the serous membrane is reflected along its sides, and here divides into two branches which em- brace it laterally, and from these numerous ramusculi are detached for the supply of its walls, which anasto- mose with the middle and inferior hemorrhoidal from the internal iliac and pudic. Remarks The inferior mesenteric is always very re- gular in its origin and termination, and both it and the superior are remarkable for the arched arrangement of their branches with the view of equalizing the circula- tion. „ ■ n ■ VIII. Lumbar.—Generally four, sometimes Ave, m num- ber • they arise from the back part of the aorta, and pass outwards over the bodies of the vertebrte, and beneath the looped origins of the psoas; the superior also under the crura of the diaphragm. Arriving at the intertrans- verse spaces, they divide into two branches,—an ante- rior, which runs outwards over the quadratus lumborum and' under the transversalis aponeurosis, to anasto- mose with the intercostal and ilio-lumbar; and a pos- terior which winds backwards through the intertrans- verse space, and reaches the erectors of the spme, which it supplies. This latter always gives ofi" a small twig, which enters the spinal canal through the foramen of conjugation, to supply the body of the bone, and to communicate with the proper spinal. . toarfo.—If there are five lumbar, the last is usually given olF by the common iliac.

Mdations.—AnUriorlj, aorta, left common iliac vein meso-rectum, and rectum itself; posteriorly, sacrum and coccyx; laterally, sympathetic chain of nerves which separates it from the lateral sacral Remarks.—This artery in its descent throws off branches, which enter through the anterior sacral fora- mina, to emerge by the posterior to anastomose with tJie superficial gluteeal. Common lLiAcs._The origin of these arteries maybe stated, as the rule, as being situated at the left side of the body of the fourth lumbar vertebra, and extending trom this point downwards and outwards, they termi- nate a little internal, but opposite, to the corresponding sacro-iliac synchondrosis, the left being generally a little shorter than the right. ^ Relations.—On the left side:—Anteriorly perito neum, sigmoid flexure, superior hemorrhoidal artery and ureter; posteriorly, side of body of last lumbar Verte- bra, connecting ligaments, sympathetic nerve and shoul- der of sacrum, obturator nerve and transverse branch of middle sacral artery; externally, psoas and spermatic arteries and veins; and internally, its own vein. Eight side:—Anteriorly, peritoneum, last coil of Ileum, and ureter; posteriorly, similar to those on left side, with, in addition, its own vein, that of the opno- site side, and commencement of inferior cava- exter- Bally, psoas and spermatic vessels; and internally mid- dle sacral artery. i?mrt.-It will be observed that the vein of the left side does not be behind, but internal to, its corre- sponding artery, while that of the right is slightly in- terna to i below, directly posterior to it in the middle and slightly external to it above; the lumbo-sacral nerve IS also posterior and internal to both vessels but If some distance from them. vtbseis, out at Anomalies.-They are sometimes altogether deficient the internal and external iliacs arising independentlv from the aorta; and their length is very variSp / ^ one to three inches: occasionaHy thl^ ^i^'^rii ^^o tT last lumbar artery. ^ ^ ^ to the 2 0 2ARTERIES AND VEINS. 844 Internal Iliac.—Opposite and internal to the sacro- iliac symphisis the common iliac bifurcates into the external and internal, the former vessel being the longer and larger, though in foetal life the exact reverse ob- tained, the latter preponderating in both measurements. In the adult, therefore, the internal iliac commences at the point indicated, and, passing downwards, backwards, and outwards, terminates at the upper part of the sciatic notch, in a trunk common to the pudic and sciatic. Relations.—Anteriorly, recto-vesical fold of peritoneum and ureter; posteriorly, lumbo-sacral nerve, ilio-lumbar and glutseal arteries, which separate it from the bone; in- ternally, origin of pyriformis, exit of sacral nerves from their foramina, lateral and middle sacral arteries, with sympathetic nerves; and externally, obturator nerve, artery, and vein, which are also somewhat superior to it. On the left side the corresponding vein lies almost directly posterior, but slightly internal to it; while on the right, though still in the same position, it is also a little external to it. _ Remarlcs.—l^ fostal life this artery is continued as the umbilical to the navel, and traversed, not the pel- vic, but abdominal region, and in its course described a well-marked curve, the concavity of which looked up- wards and forwards; but the ligature applied to the cord at the period of birth produced its obhteration as far as the bladder, and the descent of that viscus into the true pelvis likewise caused a change in its direc- tion the concavity of the curve which it forms in the adult being the opposite of that in the foetus, viz., up- wards and backwards. We have observed this to be the case in the numerous instances which we have exa- mined, and the very shape of the bone which it passes over and the traction exercised by the gluta;al, are sut- ficient to confirm this view. We have omitted men- tioning as posterior relations either the sacral plexus or pyriformis muscle, because if the artery, as generally admitted, terminates at the upper margin of the great sciatic notch, it is impossible that it could rest on either one or the other. ~ . ^nomafe._These are only such as refer to its vane- ties of length, its average being from one inch to an inchBRANCHES OP INTERNAL ILIAC. 845 and a half or to its point of origin or termination, which may be either above or below the situation indi- Collateral Branches.—These are classed into those within and those without the pelvis, the former bein<^ hve in number, viz.: ilio-lumbar, middle hcemorrhoidaL lateral sacral, vesical, and umbilical, with the uterine and vaginal in the female, while the latter are four viz glutasal, obturator, sciatic, and pudic. ' Ilio-lumbar. Usually a large branch, arising from the outer and back part of the internal iliac; it passes upwards, outwards, and backwards, and terminates in three branches, one of which ascends under the psoas to anastomose with the lumbar; the second runs outwards to the posterior part of the crest of the ilium, and across tlie liiac fossa, either under or over or throucrh the iliacus internus, to communicate with the gluteal and internal circumflex ilii; whilst the third passes down- wards and outwards, close to the bone, to which it sends a large branch, and at the anterior superior spinous process anastomoses with the circumflex branches of the temoral, external iliac, and profunda Relations of Ilio-lumbar Trunk.~Anteriorly, external Iliac artery and vein, obturator and anterior crural nerve, and psoas muscle; posteriorly, ilio-sacral sym- tlt:^obtur'ator'""^"^ "'"^^ -P-tesfiom Middle ILemorrhoidal arises from the front of the internal ihac, and, passing downwards and forwards be- low the recto-vesical fold of peritoneum, reaches the sides of the rectum and divides into numerous long branches for the supply of that gut, anastomosing with the superior hemorrhoidal from the inferior mesenteric, and the inferior from the pudic. VESiCAL._Generally three in number, and are termed the posterior, anterior, and superior. The first is usually a branch from the middle ha^morrhoidal, which run^ at first dowr. wards and forwards to the entrance of the ureter, arid then ascends on the lateral regions of the viscus; the second is given off by the internal iliac Itself, and It passes forwards along the inferior Ibndus of the bladder, supplying it and the commencem nt o 'ARTERIES AND VEINS. 846 the urethra; while the third is derived from the oblite- rated itmbilical, its twigs being distributed to its supe- rior fundus; other branches are occasionally given off to this organ from the obturator, pudic, and sciatic. Lateral Sacral.—Variable in size; it arises from the back part of the internal iliac, and passes downwards and inwards over the origins of the pyriformis and points of emergence of the sacral nerves, and, reachmg the coccyx, anastomoses by reversed arches with the middle sacral, from which it is separated in its course down- wards by the sympathetic nerve. This vessel as it de- scends throws off branches, which, entering by the anterior sacral foramina, again emerge after supplymg the Cauda equina through the posterior, and on the back of the sacrum anastomoses with the superficial branches of the glutseal. Umbilical.—This is usually known as the oblite- rated hypogastric, but, as already observed it always continues patulous to the upper fundus of the bladder, constituting the superior vesical artery; at this pomt a small twig is always detached from it (deferential branch of Sir A. Cooper), which accompanies the vas deferens as far as the epididymis, there anastomosmg with the spermatic and cremasteric arteries. _ Uterine arises in common with the inferior vesical from the termination of the internal iliac, passes for- wards to the neck of the uterus, and, ascendmg a ong its sides, divides into anterior and posterior branches for the front and back of this organ, which can be traced as high as its fundus, and which become remarkably large and tortuous during pregnancy. .

Hence it must be divided into an intra and extrapelvic stage. Relations of Intrapelvic Stage—Anteriorljs perito- neum, internal iliac artery and vein; posteriorly, com- municating branch of lumbo-sacral nerve, which sepa- rates it from the bone, and then becomes external to it. In this stage it is ahvays surrounded by a quantity of hard condensed areolar tissue of a yellow colour. On reaching the upper margin of the great sciatic notch the gluta^al throws off a large branch for the supply of the bone, which anastomoses in its cancellous structure with the ilio-lumbar, and then emerges between the communicating branch of the lumbo-sacral and first sa- cral nerves; then between the margin of the notch, which it grooves, and the pyriformis muscle, and ulti- mately stands boldly out between the latter and the posterior margin of the gluta3us minimus; in this course it is accompanied by the superior glutteal nerve, which lies anterior and external to it, and the gluteal vein, which is posterior to it. Dividing now into two branches,—a superficial and deep, the former enters the substance of the gluteus maximus, and separates into a number of long, slender ramusculi, some of which pass upwards to the posterior part of the crest of the ilium to anastomose with the ilio-lumbar and internal circum- flex ilii; some run upwards and backwards to the pos- terior surface of the sacrum, to communicate with the perforating branches of the middle and lateral sacral; while others again pass downwards and backwards to the coccyx, perforating the sciatic ligaments to anasto- mose with the coccygeal branch of the sciatic. The latter or profunda division of the glutseal divides into three branches,—a superior, middle, and inferior: the first winds upwards and forwards between the glutseus medius and minimus, following the curved orio-in of the latter muscle, and at the anterior superior spine of the ilium anastomoses with the ilio-lumbar and the cir- cumflex of the femoral and external iliac; the second or middle runs forwards, still between the same muscle^^ but across the centre of the minimus, to the anterior inferior spine, where it communicates with the ascend-848 ARTERIES AND VEINS. ing division of the external circumflex of the profunda; while the third, or inferior, descends along the posterior margin of the glutteus minimus, which it afterwards perforates, and, entering the digital fossa, anastomoses with the obturator, sciatic, and internal circumflex of the profunda. Obturator arises from the outer and anterior side of the internal iliac, and, passing downwards, forwards, and outwards, leaves the pelvis through the upper part of the thyroid foramen, and terminates on the inner region of the thigh by dividing into two branches; it also has been divided into two stages,—one within and one without the pelvis. Relations Witliin the pelvis:—Superiorly and ante- riorly, obturator nerve; inferiorly and posteriorly, ob- turator vein; externally, wall of the pelvis and origin . of levator ani; and internally, peritoneum. In this stage it is always invested in loose areolar tissue. On reach- ing the thyroid foramen it detaches a small branch which runs inwards above the neck of the bladder, and behind the symphisis, to anastomose with its fellow of the opposite side; the artery then perforates the vesi- cal fascia, fibres of the levator ani, obturator fascia, ob- turator internus, obturator membrane, and obturator externus; arriving now on the inside of the thigh, or its second stage, it lies in a kind of triangular recess, formed in .front by the pectineals, behind by the quadratus femoris, and upper margin of the adductor magnus; externally by the neck of the bone and capsular liga- ment, psoas and iliac muscles; internally by the adduc- tors brevis and longus; and superiorly by the obturator externus; here it throws off some twigs to the hip- joint, and then divides into two branches,—an internal which passes downwards and inwards along the inside of the obturator muscle, supplying the origins of the adductors, sides of the scrotum, and labia in the female, anastomosing Avith muscular branches of the femoral; and an external, which runs on the outside of the ob- turator muscle, accompanying its tendon to the digital fossa, where it communicates with the sciatic, gluteal, and internal circumflex of the profunda. Anomalies.—Th\s, according to our observations, isBRANCHES OF INTERNAL ILIAC. 849 more liable to variation than is generally supposed, and in the session before last especially, nearly every subject that was brought into the dissecting-room was marked by a variety of origin from the epigastric, and not from Its ordinary source. When this abnormal condi- tion of the vessel exists, its importance as far as femoral hernia is concerned is obvious, as its course is at first directly inwards, parallel but above Poupart's ligament then backwards along the base of Gimbernaut's, and ultimately downwards, backwards, and outwards to the subpubic canal. In an instance of this kind, it is quite clear that it must embrace nearly two-thirds of the neck of the sac, and this m a most dangerous position, as it lies in the direction of the edge of the knife, as it divides the stricture at the point of strangulation. But again this anomaly may prevail, and yet be attended with no'dan - ger as the vessel may pass to its destination between the neck of the sac and the external iliac vein. The obtu- rator artery may also arise from the internal circumilex of the profunda, the external iliac, or, accordintr to Burns, from the femoral. ° Sciatic—This almost always arises by a common trunk with the pudic, than which it is always laro-er- It passes downwards, forwards, and outwards, and leaves' the pelvis through the lower part of the great sciatic notch where it divides into its ultimate branches. This vessel has also been divided into two stages, or one withm and one without the pelvis. Relations-First .S'ta^re.-Anteriorly, rectum, bladder and vesicu a? seminales; posteriorly, pyriformis, sacral plexus, and pelvic fascia; externally, pudic artery; and internally, middle sacral. ^ Leaving the pelvis now below the pyriformis, above the lesser sciatic ligament, and posterior to the spine of the ischium, it stands boldly out in its second stage be- neath the glutffius maximus, and posterior to, or nearer the sacrum than the great sciatic nerve, and liereit di- vides mto its terminal branches,_viz., coccygeal, comes ■ neryi ischiadici, and muscular. Coccygeal.—Generally large; it arises from the back ,part of the sciatic, and passes backwards and inwards over the pudic artery, and between the greater and 2 o .3ARTERIES AND VEINS. 850 lesser sciatic ligaments, and, reaching the coccyx, it anastomoses with the gluteal, lateral, and middle sa- cral. Comes Nervi Ischiadici.—A slender, but long branch; it runs at first downwards on the back part of the great sciatic nerve, then, perforating it, descends in its sub- stance as far as the knee-joint, where it anastomoses with branches of the poplit^ah Muscular.—Several twigs to the adjacent muscles, one of which always runs to the digital fossa to anasto- mose with the glutEeal, obturator, and internal circum- flex of the profunda. PuDic.—This is the longest and most important of the branches of the internal iliac; it arises usually from a common trunk with the sciatic, and, pursuing a very tortuous course, terminates at the corona glandis in the male, and the labia in the female. In order to un- derstand its relations with greater facility, it has been divided into three stages,-rthe first extending from its origin to its exit, from the pelvis through the great sciatic notch; the second very short, where it crosses the spine of the ischium; and the third from its re-en- trance into the pelvis till it reaches the glans penis. Relations—First Anteriorly, rectum, bladder, and vesicular seminales; posteriorly, pyriformis, sacral plexus, and pelvic fascia; internally, sciatic artery; and externally, the parts as they emerge from the greater sciatic notch. As it passes through the aperture it winds beneath, and becomes anterior to, the sciatic ar- tery; has above it the the pyriformis, and below it the lesser sciatic ligament. . Relations—Second Stage.—Anteriorly, spine oi the ischium; posteriorly, external falciform process of great sciatic ligament and glutajus maximus; superiorly, pu- dic vein; and inferiorly, pudic and obturator nerves. It now re-enters the pelvis through the lesser sciatic notch, but is separated from the bone by the tendon ot the ob- turator internus, which is escaping at the same moment, and here its third stage commences. 2eeto<t0JW.—Externally, tuber ischii and obturator in- ternus; internally, obturator fascia, in a tubule ol which it is invested; and inferiorly, internal falciform processBRANCHES OF INTERNAL ILIAC. 851 of the great sciatic ligament. Having occupied this tri- angular groove as far as the anterior part of the tube- rosity, it perforates the base of the posterior layer of the triangular ligament, runs between it and the anterior for about half-an-inch, and then, piercing the latter, ascends upwards, forwards, and inwards, between the crus penis, which is anterior and inferior to it, the an- terior layer of the triangular ligament, which is superior and posterior to it, and the ramus of the pubis, which is external to it, dividing at the subpubic ligament into its two terminal branches. Anomalies.—Cases sometimes occur where the com- mon trunk of the sciatic and pudic will pass out of the pelvis before it bifurcates into those two branches, but they are very rare. The most important anomaly in this vessel is, however, where it terminates in the long perineal or artery of the bulb, as in this instance an ac- cessory branch is detached either from the epigastric or external iliac, which passes downwards and backwards behind the back part of the pubis on either side of the membranous portion of the urethra, and then, piercing the triangular ligament, pursues the normal course and division of the true pudic; this branch is occasionally found occupying a more dangerous position, running along the sides of the prostate,—a perilous situation to the lithotomist. During the course of last session we had an opportunity of observing a very curious variety: —the obturator artery sprang abnormally from the epi- gastric, and immediately after its origin threw off a very large branch, which perforated the transversalis fascia, and emerged through the external abdominal ring, de- scended on the front of the pubis, and became the dor- sal artery of the penis. CollateralBranciies of thePuDic.—In its first stage generally a few small twigs to the neck of the bladder; in its second, none; and in its third, from behind for- wards, inferior hajmorrhoidal, transverse perineal, long perineal, artery of the bulb, artery of the cavernous structure, and dorsal artery of the penis. Inferior llyEMORRHoiDAL Generally two or three small twigs, which arise from the pudic at the commence- ment of its third stage; they pierce the obturator fascia852 ARTERIES AND VEINS. and cross tlie iscliio-rectal fossa, tlirougli the fat of this region, and are distributed to the verge of the anus, anas- tomosing with the superior and middle hsemorrhoidal. Transverse Perineal—A short, thick trunk, which arises a little external to the last; it perforates the obtu- rator fascia and base of triangular ligament; runs in- wards and forwards, at first behind, then below, and ultimately in front, of the transverse perineal muscle, reaches the accelerator urinse, which it supplies, and anastomoses with its fellow of the opposite side. Long Perineal Longer, but smaller in caliber than the last, in common with which it usually arises; it also pierces the obturator fascia and base of triangular liga- ment, and, running upwards, forwards, and inwards through the ischio-bulbar space, between the erector penis and accelerator urings, reaches the root of the scrotum, where it divides into two branches,—an in- ternal, which supplies the scrotum, and communicates with its fellow of the opposite side; and an external, which ramifies on the outside of the scrotum, anasto- mosing with the superficial pudic of the femoral. Artery of the Bulb.—This arises from the pudic, as the latter vessel lies between the layers of the triangular ligament; it passes upwards and inwards, anterior and inferior to Guthrie's muscle, and before reaching the urethra divides into two branches,—bulbar and glan- dular ; the former, large, pierces the anterior layer of the triangular ligament, enters the bulb, to the substance of which and the spongy structure of the urethra it is distributed, while the latter, which is very small, sup- plies Cowper's glands. The artery of the bulb, while be- tween the layers of the triangular ligament, lies about half-an-inch above its base. Anomalies.—This artery may be sometimes double, and occasionally takes a very peculiar course to reach its destination, running at first from its origin directly inwards towards the mesial line along the lower edge of the triangular ligament, and then descending nearly ver- tically to the urethra: under these circumstances it always arises about half-an-inch posterior to its ordinary position. Artery of the Cavernous Structure arises oppo-EXTERNAL ILIAC. 853 site the subpubic ligament in company with the dor- sal artery of the penis; it perforates the crus penis on its internal and inferior wall, runs through the cellular structure of the corpus cavernosum penis, separated from its fellow of the opposite side by the septum pec- tiniforme, frequently communicating with it through its teeth; it gives off numerous capillary branches for the nutrition of the organ, and others which terminate in the venous cells, of which it is principally composed. (See Anatomy of the Penis, p. 414). Dorsal Branch.—This arises in company with the last, and winds upwards and forwards between the crus externally and the bulb internally, then between the true suspensory ligaments of the penis, along the dorsum of which it runs forwards between its correspondinrr nerve, which is on the outside, and vein, which is to its inside, till it arrives at the corona glandis; here it sinks deeply, and forms, between the truncated extremity of the corpora cavernosa and glans penis, a plexus from which numerous filaments are detached to supply the latter structure. The dorsal artery always throws oifa large cutaneous branch about the centre of the penis, which is distributed to the integument of that organ and the side of the scrotum. External Iliac arises from the common, internal but opposite to the sacro-iliac synchondrosis, and, pass- ing downwards, forwards, and outwards, terminates in the femoral at the pectineal line, a little internal to the eminence of that name. Relationi^—Anteriorly, peritoneum, Abernethy's or expansion of fascia iliaca, ureter above, and vas deferens below, internal circumflex ilii vein and genito-crural nerve; posteriorly, fascia iliaca, psoas muscle, and ac- cessory obturator nerve; externally, anterior crural nerve, but separated from it by some fibres of the psoas and fascia iliaca; and internally, its own vein below, but above it becomes posterior to it. Ramarks—We have omitted the spermatic vessels as an anterior relation for this artery, although they do occasionally lie over it near its termination; but we believe that, as the rule, they are generally external to It. The anterior crural nerve also, although external854 ARTERIES AND VEINS. to the iliac artery in its whole course, is nevertheless much farther from it above than below, being, m the former instance, fully an inch distant from it, but m the latter only about a quarter. . Anomalies.—The only one which we are acquainted with is where the external iliac bifurcates into the ie- moral and profunda, at the lower part of the iliac fossa Collateral Branches.—Deep epigastric and internal circumflex ilii. , , , Deep Epigastric—A rather large branch, arising from the external iliac, a line or two above Poupart s ligament, passes at first downwards and inwards, then upwards, forwards, and inwards, entering the posterior plrt of the sheath of the rectus, beneath the semilunar margin of the internal oblique and transversalis, and, ascending as high as the umbilicus, breaks up into a series of branches, which anastomose with the internal mammary, superficial epigastric, and lumbar. i?.toi.-Anteriorly, external iliac vein, tran.ver- salis fascia, spermatic cord, and ^^donimal muscles; pos- teriorly, peritoneum and posterior wal of sheath ot the rectus; externally, internal abdominal rmg and sper- matic ;rtery, which separates it from the vas deferens; and internally, obliterated hypogastric artery. Eemarks—This vessel, in its course upwards, lies very closed the internal'abdominal ring, and, accordins lo our observations, invariably runs between the laye of the transversalis fascia, the division separating it from the peritoneum being always thm, but strong Anomalies.-The epigastric may ^^'f« ^^^^^ ^^j^';*;^^ rator or internal circumflex; it may also be double, and [n this ca^e one branch has been seen to pass external and ti e otherTnternal to the cord as it emerges through tTc iniernal ring.

It also, at the in- ternal ring, gives off the cremasteric branch, which ra- mifies in the substance of the cord, and ultimately anas- ' tomoses in the scrotum with the spermatic and defe- rential. Internal Circumflex Ilii arises from the external iliac, close to the origin of the epigastric; it passes up- wards and outwards, parallel but internal to Poupart's ligament, over the anterior crural nerve, and between the fascia transversalis and iliaca, a well-marked white line indicating its course. On reaching the anterior su- perior spine of the ilium, it anastomoses with the ilio- lumbar, superficial circumflex of the femoral, and pro- funda division of the glutteal; it next continues its course backwards on the crest of the ilium, between the internal oblique and transversalis, and over the ilio- scrotal nerve, to the back part of the crest, where it again communicates with the superficial glutasal and iho-lumbar; it next turns upwards between the same muscles towards the last rib, to anastomose with the lumbar and intercostals. Anomalies—This artery may arise either from the obturator or deep epigastric, and both it and the latter vessel have been known to spring from the external iliac two inches or more above Poupart's ligament; this however, is very rare. We have observed, in one case only, a most important anomaly with respect to the origm of this artery, where it sprang from the epigastric above the internal abdominal ring; thus, crossing above the cord as it emerged from the abdominal cavity, it passed outwards to reach its proper destination. In an operation for oblique inguinal hernia, strangulated at this orifice, it was impossible that the vessel could have escaped. _ Femoral Artery—The continuation of the external ihac; commences opposite the pectineal line, and, passing- downwards, backwards, and iliwards, terminates at the junction of the lower with the middle third of the thicrh here perforating the adductor magnus, and becomfna poplita;al. We will accordingly examine it as it lies in Its first stage, or Scarpa's space, and in its second or Hunter's canal. 'ARTERIES AND VEINS. 856 Relations—First Stage, or Scarpa's Space.—Anteri- orly, integument, superficial fascia, with lymphatic glands, fascia lata, crural branch of genito-crural nerve, and sartorius; posteriorly, psoas muscle, which separates it from the capsular ligament of the hip-joint, pecti- neus, adductor brevis, but with the interposition of the profunda artery, femoral, profunda, and external cir- cumflex veins, communicating branch between internal saphenous and obturator nerves, and loose areolar tissue, and ultimately adductor longus; externally, anterior crural nerve above, and edge of sartorius below; and in- ternally, its own vein superiorly, and adductor inferiorly. Relations—Second Stage, or Hunter's Canal.—Anteri- orly, sartorius and strong aponeurosis, the latter stretched in inverted arches between the vastus internus and ad- ductorslongus andmagnus, and internal saphenous nerve; posteriorly, the conjoined tendons of the adductors, vas- tus internus, and femoral vein; internally, the former; and externally, the latter muscle. Remarks.—Ks it is a matter of some importance to define the point where the femoral artery emerges from beneath Poupart's ligament, it may be stated, as a ge- neral rule, that it descends about two inches and a half from the spine of the pubis, and three from the ante- rior superior spine of the ilium. In a well-formed man, when in the upright position, if a plumb-line is allowed to fall from this point perpendicularly downwards,_ it will very nearly map out the course of the vessel, which will be, however, slightly external to it, the twist m the femur giving an apparent, but not a real, curve to the artery. On examining its relative position with re-rard to its vein, we will find, that immediately below Poupart's ligament the latter lies directly internal to it, but as they continue to descend the vein gradually in- clines behind it, so as to lie completely posterior to it, in the middle of Hunter's canal, and slightly external as it passes from that canal into the poplita^al region. The student should also remember that, in the iisual condition of the limb, although the insertions of the pectineus and adductor brevis are given as posterior relations for the artery, still they are really at some distance from it, and the thigh must be forcibly rotatedBRANCHES OF FEMORAL. 857 outwards before they are brought in close proximity to it. As Scarpa's space or angle, and Hunter's canal, are invested with great importance,—the former from its practical utility in a surgical point of view, and the lat- ter from the historical associations connected with it, we consider it necessary to give in detail the several boundaries of each. When the integuments and in- vesting fascia have been removed from the upper part of the thigh, the region described by Scarpa will be ex- posed : it represents in figure a scalene triangle, its exter- nal and longest leg formed by the sartorius; its internal by the adductor longus; its base by Poupart'sligament; and Its fioor by the edge of the rectus, psoas and iliacus, ipectmeus and adductor brevis ; the three important 'parts which it contains are,—the anterior crural nerve most externally, the femoral artery in the middle, and ;its vem most internally; and, in addition, but of minor :note, the superficial epigastric, circuniliex ilii, pudic, ;profunda, and internal and external circumflex, two superior perforating arteries, with the accompanyin^r vems of those vessels. Hunter's canal forms a prism"^ but broader above than below; it occupies the middle tthird of the thigh, and is bounded externally by the vvastus internus; internally, by the adductors longus aandmagnus; posteriorly, by the conjoined tendons of ithese muscles at their insertion into the linea aspera; and anteriorly, by a strong aponeurosis, on which the ssartorius rests; here the artery occupies a middle posi- ;.-.ion between the internal saphenous nerve, which lies at first external to it, then anterior, and ultimately in- ■■zerna.]; while the femoral vein is at first posterior and internal, then directly behind it, and ultimately pos- terior and slightly external; it also contains the anas- ;omotica magna artery. Anomalies—The femoral artery is generally very re- ■{ular in its course; but some few cases are on record vhere it has been double, and also where the two tranches, after continuing separate for some distance .gam united, forming a single trunk. Collateral Branches.—In Scarpa's space, superfi- lal pudic, circumflex ilii, epigastric, and profunda; in858 ARTERIES AND VEINS. Hunter's canal, several muscular, from its inner side, and anastomotica magna. Superficial Pudic—Usually small; arising from the femoral about three-quarters of an inch below Pou- part's ligament; it passes at first directly inwards for a short distance, and divides into two branches,—-a superficial, which pierces the pubic portion of the fascia lata, and then runs upwards and inwards between the layers of the superficial fascia to the front of the sym- physis pubis, supplying that region, and anastomosing with its fellow of the opposite side and a deep branch, which continues beneath the fascia lata, as far as the side of the scrotum, where it becomes cutaneous, sup- plying it, and anastomosing with the perineal division of the deep pudic. Superficial Circumflex Ilii.—Also small; it arises from the external side of the femoral, nearly at the same point with the preceding; it perforates the iliac portion of the fascia lata, sometimes the cribriform, and runs upwards and outwards, parallel but inferior to Poupart s ligament, to the anterior superior spine of the liium, where it communicates with the internal circumflex, ilio-lumbar, and glutseal. Superficial Epigastric—Larger than either ot tiie two preceding; it perforates the cribriform process ot the fascia lata, and, running upwards and inwards over Poupart's ligament, invested in the layers of the super- ficial fascia, anastomoses at the umbilicus with the deep epigastric and internal mammary. Eemarks.-These three vessels may arise by a com- mon trunk, and they all pierce the sheath ot the te- moral vessels. . n:„„ Profunda.-Always very large; sometimes equali ng in size the femoral, from the outer and back part ot which it arises, and passing at first downwards and outwards, then winding downwards and inwards be neath its parent trunk, ultimately perlorates the ad- ductor minus, opposite the middle third of the thigh, ^Trunnkig outwards and downwards, terminates in Sle biceps, by anastomosing with muscular branches of the poplitajal.BRANCHES OF FEMORAL. 859 Relations.—Anteriorly, at first slightly overlapped by the femoral artery, then by merely integumeijit, super- ficial and deep fascia, then by the edge of the rectus and sartorius, then by femoral artery again, but sepa- rated from it by its own,—the femoral, and external circumflex ilii veins, with the obdurator saphenous nerve and insertion of the adductor longus; poste- riorly in succession from above downwards, tendons of psoas and iliacus, crureus, edge of vastus inter- nus, insertions of pectineus, and adductors brevis and magnus. Anomalies are only those of origin, as it may arise in common with the femoral, from the external iliac; or, if from the femoral, it may spring from this ves- sel, either one, two, three, or four inches below Pou- part's ligament; but cases are very rare, indeed, in which it even approximates to the last-mentioned point. Collateral Branches of PEOFimDA.—External and internal circumflex ilii, and three perforating arteries. External Circumflex Always a large branch, arising from the profunda immediately after its origin from the femoral; it passes outwards between the branches of the anterior crural nerve, over the tendons of the psoas, iliacus, and crureus, and under the sartorius, rec- tus, and divides into three branches,—ascending, mid- dle, and descending. Ascending Branch passes upwards and outwards in a fusiform space, filled with loose areolar tissue, bounded in front by the sartorius; externally by the tensor va- gina femoris; behind by the edge of the gluteus me- diiis and great trochanter, and internally, by the iliacus internus; at the anterior inferior spine it anastomoses with the profunda of the glutseal. Middle Branch In direction the continuation of the external circumflex; it insinuates itself first between the crureus and vastus externus, then between the lat- ter muscle and the bone, the back part of which latter it ultimately reaches, piercing the attachments of the glutaaus maximus and adductor magnus, anastomosing with a similar branch of the internal circumflex ilii. Descending Branch runs at first downwards and in-860 ARTERIES AND VEINS. wards, between the rectus and crureus, sending several I long branches to both, then descends along the outside ^ of the thigh between the rectus, which is in front of it, ' the crureus, which is behind it, and the vastus extemus, which is to its outside, and, becoming subfascial about two inches above the knee, runs downwards to the upper and outer part of the patella, and anastomoses with the superior external articular artery. Internal Circumflex.—Larger than the external, but close to which it usually arises; it passes at first directly backwards, between the tendons of the psoas and inner edge of the pectineus, and then, dividing into two branches,—an ascending, which passesupwards and back- wards on the obturator externus, enters the digital fossa and anastomoses with the obturator, sciatic, and gluteal; and a descending, which runs directly backwards to the posterior surface of the bone, between the obturator ex- ternus and adductor brevis, then between the adductor magnus and quadratus femoris, to communicate mth a siniilar branch from the external, and with the glutasal, sciatic, and first perforating artery. The internal cir- cumflex always gives ofi" a branch to supply the joint, and while in the triangular space, behind the pectineus, anastomoses very freely with the obturators. Anomalies Both circumflex, may arise by a common trunk, or, where the profunda arises some distance below Poupart's ligament, both may spring from the femoral, or one from it, and the other from the profunda. Perforating Arteries.—These are three in number, and they all arise from the posterior wall of the pro- funda,—the first passes backwards, usually between the pectineus.and adductor brevis, and then through the adductor magnus; the second always perforates the ad- ductor brevis, and then the adductor magnus, while the third pierces the latter muscle only; lying now under the hamstring muscles, they freely supply the great sciatic nerve and the areolar tissue m which it is em- bedded, and dividing, each into two branches, whicn anastomose with each other, they likewise communicate above with the sciatic and glutasal, and below with branches of the poplita^al, thus cstablishmg an impor- tant chain of inosculation, which is beautifully displayedPOPLITEAL ARTERY. 861 in ligature of the femoral artery, where their caliber is increased to that of the radial. Anastomotica Magna The only branch in Hun- ter's canal which has received a name; it arises from the inner and anterior side of the femoral at the lower part of the space, and runs downwards and inwards on the upper edge of the adductor magnus tendon, in com- pany with the internal saphenous nerve, at first beneath the aponeurosis which connects it to the vastus internus, but it soon perforates it and divides into two sets of branches,—an anterior, which passes forwards and out- wards to anastomose with the superior internal articular artery; and a posterior, which winds backwards and outwards into the poplitseal space to communicate with the collateral branches of that vessel. Remarks—The femoral artery enters the poplitseal space through an oval opening, tendinous in structure, its long measurement being from above downwards, situated really in the tendon of the adductor magnus; but because two other muscles are in some degree con- nected with its margins it is usually described as having the following boundaries:—Superiorly, tendons of ad- ductor magnus and longus; inferiorly, those of the ad- ductor magnus and vastus internus; internally, adduc- tor magnus; and externally, vastus internus. This aperture is much too large for the artery and its vein, and here the sheath which invested them, being con- tinued downwards from Poupart's ligament, formed in front by a process from the transversalis fascia, and be- hind by that of the fascia iliaca, ceases to exist, or at least is incapable of demonstration beyond this point. P0PLIT.EAL Artery is the direct continuation of the femoral, commencing at the opening in the adductor, and passing downwards and slightly inwards, termi- nates at the lower margin of the poplita^us muscle. Relations—It is covered at first for about an inch by the semimembranosus, then by a quantity of fat and ■ areolar tissue, the poplitaeal nerve and vein, and the ap- proximation of the two heads of the gastrocnemius; and it is supported by the flat surface of the back of the femur, from which it is separated by a cushion of fat, ' on the ligamentum posticum of the knee-joint, a lym-862 ARTERIES AND VEINS. phatic gland generally intervening, and ultimately on the poplitseus. Eemarks.—The popliteal space which this vessel oc- cupies is one of great surgical importance, and it may ^ be exposed by stripping the integuments from the lower third of the back part of the thigh, and to the same ex- tent on the posterior surface of the leg. The superficial fascia which lies beneath it is thin in its character, espe- cially on the sides of the space, but becomes more dense towards its centre, and in it are found branches of the posterior cutaneous nerve from the sacral plexus, with the posterior or external saphenous vein. On removing these parts the true popliteal fascia is exposed, stretched tensely across the space, its fibres forming well-marked curves, the concavities of which are directed upwards and outwards; opposite the flexure of the joint it is remarkably strong, and is here perforated by the saphe- nous vein in its course to join the poplita^al When this fascia is removed the outline of the space is exposed; it is of a diamond shape, or perhaps it might more pro- perly be said to consist of two triangles, with their bases united opposite the condyles, the superior being the best defined, and larger, so as to be capable of embracing by its expanded legs those of the inferior at their point of junction. The outer wall of the poplita^al region is formed above by the tendon of the biceps, and below by the external head of the gastrocnemius, solasus, and plantaris; while the inner is constituted by the semi- tendinosus, semimembranosus, gracilis, and sartorius above, and the inner head of the gastrocnemius below With respect to the parts which it contains, we aviII find the poplitfeal nerve the most superficial, being at first external to the vessels, but crossing them opposite the flexure of the joint, and lying internal to them be- low the vein holds nearly the same relation to the ar- tery, being at first a little external, then superficial, and ultimately slightly internal, to it; but it must be recollected that they (the vein and artery) are intimately connected to each other. Three or four lymphatic glands are always found opposite the joint, generally surround- ine; the vessels. . . ^- . Anomalies.-ExtTemelj rare, but it is sometimes863 BRANCHES OF POPLITEAL, found double, and it may divide into its terminal branches, either on or above the poplitseus. Collateral Branches—Superior external, superior internal, inferior external, inferior internal, azygos, articular, and sural. Superior External Articular.—Rather large, aris- ing from the outer side of the poplitseal, opposite the ' external condyle; passes outwards, and slightly up- wards, resting on the bone beneath the poplitteal vein and nerve, tendon of the biceps, and peroneal nerve; be- neath the vastus externus it divides into two branches, a superficial, which, piercing that muscle, runs to the , superior external angle of the patella to anastomose with the descending branches of the external circum- flex of the profunda, and the adjacent articular; and a ' deep, which, forming an arch above the condyles with : a similar branch from the internal, supplies the syno- vial membrane. Superior Internal Articular arises opposite the last from the inner side of the popliteal; it runs up- wards and inwards, likewise, on the bone, beneath the tendons of the semitendinosus, semimembranosus, graci- lis, sartorius, and adductor magnus, and on arriving beneath the vastus internus divides into two branches, a superficial, which runs to the upper and inner side of the patella, to anastomose with the anastomotica magna and adjoining articular; and a deep, which proceeds to supply the joint. Inferior External Articular arises exactly op- posite the articulation; it winds outwards over the ■ tendon of the poplitasus and external semilunar carti- lage, and beneath the external head of the gastrocne- mius, plantaris, biceps, external lateral ligament, and peroneal nerve, and, reaching the front of the joint, di- vides into two branches,—a superficial, which runs to the front of the patella to anastomose with the anterior tibial recurrent, and its fellow of the opposite side; and : a deep, to supply the interior of the joint. Inferior Internal Articular.—This arises a little I lower than the last, and passes downwards and inwards : along the upper margin of the poplitoeus, resting on the back part of the tibia, and under the internal head of I864 ARTERIES AND VEINS. the gastrocnemius, tendons of semitendinosus,^ gracilis, sartorius, and expansion from internal lateral ligament; and on the front of the joint also divides into two branches,—a deep, to supply its interior; and a superfi- cial, to anastomose with its fellow and anterior tibial recurrent. AzYGOs Articular.—Always small; it pierces the ligament of Winslow, and, entering the joint, is distri- j buted to the crucial ligaments. Sural Long slender branches, irregular as to num- ber; they spring from the superficial surface of the popiitasal, and, passing downwards, are principally dis- tributed to the muscles on the back of the leg. Remarks.—The branches of the popliteal are very variable both in origin and size, but where those of one side are found to be small, those on the other are pro- portionably large. . . Posterior Tibial.—This is the direct continuation ot the poplitajal, both in size and direction. It arises op- posite to the lower edge of the poplit^us, and, passing downwards and inwards, terminates by dividing into the external and internal plantar arteries, between the internal malleolus and os calcis, and likewise between the two heads of origin of the abductor poUicis. _ Relations.—It is covered in its two superior thirds by the gastrocnemius, solteus, plantaris, deep fascia, and posterior tibial nerve; and it rests on the tibialis posti- cus, flexor digitorum communis, and lower and back part of tibia, separated by a cushion of fat. Remarks.—Much importance has been latter y attri- buted to the tendinous arch between the two heads ot the solaius, beneath which the artery glides to reach the posterior part of the leg. Its obvious use appears to be. to prevent compression of the vessel from the contrac- tion of the muscle, stretching, as it does, from bone to bone, its concavity being directed forwards or towards theartery, and it can always be easily shown by cutting across the tendo Achillis, and then dissecting up the superficial from the deep muscles. The posterior tibial nerve lies to the inside of this vessel at its oi-'gi^^' it crosses it at the junction of its superior_ and middle thirds, so as to become external to it. In its mfcrior partBRANCHES OF POSTERIOR TIBIAL. 865 the artery is comparatively superficial, but in order to reach it, it will be necessary to cut through 1. Inte- gument; 2. Superficial fascia; 3. A thin aponeurosis from the inner edge of the tendo Achillis; 4. Deep fascia, which is here dense and strong, its fibres run- ning transversely across from tibia to fibula; 5, Sheath of tendon of flexor pollicis. The order of parts from within and before, backwards and outwards, is: 1. Tibialis posticus; 2. Flexor communis; 3. Artery, with a vein on either side; 4. Posterior tibial nerve; and 5. Flexor pollicis longus. Anomalies.—We have already observed, that the pos- terior tibial may arise at any point above the poplitseus, or even a short distance below it; while in some in- stances it is said to be altogether absent, but we have never observed an instance where it did not exist, cer- tainly in many cases as a mere filament, the peroneal under these circumstances being abnormally large, and giving off the ordinary branches of the tibial. Collateral Branches.—Peroneal; several branches to the adjacent muscles; external and internal plantar. Peroneal.—Always a large branch arising from the outer side of the posterior tibial an inch and a half be- low the inferior margin of the poplitoeus; it passes at first downwards and outwards on the tibialis posticus and under the deep fascia; then beneath the flexor pol- licis longus, on the interosseous ligament, having the fibula external to it, till it arrives about two inches above the ankle-joint, where it divides into anterior and pos- terior fibular,—the former piercing the interosseous ligament, and running downwards to the external mal- leolus, in front of the fibula, and under the peroneus anticus, while the latter passes on the back of the same bone, still beneath the flexor pollicis longus, forming an anastomotic loop beneath the external malleolus with the anterior, where they also communicate with the tar- sal and metatarsal branches from the anterior tibial. Anomalies.—This artery may arise either indepen- dently from the popliteal or from a line to two inches below the margin of the poplitaeus. In some cases it is so very small that it can scarcely be said to exist at all while in others, it may be vastly increased in caliber' 2 p866 ARTERIES AND VEINS. and under those latter circumstances it may terminate either by reinforcing the posterior tibial by a cross branch, which will run transversely inwards to join it an inch or two above the ankle-joint, its course being either superficial to, or deeper than, the tendons on the back of the leg; or it may send through the interos- seous space a very large branch, which will take the place of the anterior tibial, the latter vessel being ab- normally small, and terminating before reaching the an- terior annular ligament. Internal Plantar.—One of the terminal branches ot the posterior tibial, small as contrasted with the external; it arises between the os calcis and internal malleolus, and passes forwards and inwards between the two heads of the abductor pollicis, then between it and the exter- nal heads of the flexor pollicis brevis, and, reaching the space between the first and second metatarsal bones, di- vides into two branches,—an internal, which crosses obliquely forwards and inwards to the inner side ot the creat toe, to the integuments of which it is distributed, while the external, on arriving at the cleft between the first and second toes, subdivides, and supplies their ad- iacent surfaces. External Plantar.-Always very large arising in common with the preceding; it passes at first forwards and outwards between the musculus accessorius, flexor communis, and flexor pollicis, which are above it, and the flexor digitorum brevis, which is below it; then runs directly forwards for about an inch, between the abductor minimi digiti on the outside, and the flexor digitorum brevis on the inside, being here very super- ficial, and, arriving at the base of the metatarsal bone of the little toe, it is suddenly inflected mwards and for- wards as far as the first interosseous space, where it terminates by anastomosing with the perforating branch of the dorsalis pedis, thus forming the deep pla^tar ar^. In this latter part of its course its relations are the fol- lowing :-Below it, three layers of the plantar muscle ab^ve it, the interossei and bases of the metatarsal bones erior'to it, transversalis pedis; ^^^f.^; nal to it, the adductor polhcis; and externa to it, the Sexor brevis minimi digiti. The plantar arch gives offANTERIOR TIBIAL. 867 four digital branches from its convexity, which is turned forwards, and three from its superior wall, which are termed interosseous; the first digital branch passes for- wards and outwards, and is distributed to the outside of the little toe; the second runs to the cleft betweeu the fifth and fourth toes, and bifurcates for the supply of their adjacent surfaces; the third proceeds to the space between the third and fourth, where it also divides for their opposed sides; while the fourth runs in a simi- lar manner to the interval between the second and third and there divides for the supply of their approximated sides; all these digital branches, with their correspond- ing nerves, run close to the sheaths of the flexor ten- dons, to which they are bound by looped processes of the plantar fascia, and they observe an arrangement simi- lar to those of the fingers, forming arches on the last or ungual phalanges for the supply of the integument and matrix of the nails. The interosseal branches, which are three in number, are only found in the three exter- nal interosseal spaces; they perforate and supply those muscles, and anastomose with the dorsal interosseal branches from the metatarsal of the anterior tibial. Remarks.—Those arteries, but especially the external plantar, supply numerous branches to the fat and mus- cles of this region, with several filaments to the articu- lations, and, as the general rule, they lie deeper than their corresponding nerves. Anterior Tibial arises in common with the poste- rior, than which it is much smaller, from the poplitteal and passes directly forwards through a quadrilateral : space, bounded above by the edge of the poplitaius and itibio-fibular articulation; below, by the upper margin (Of the interosseous ligament; and on either side by the ttibia and fibula, being accompanied through this aper- tture by its two vena comites, communicating branch tbetween the anterior and posterior tibial nerves, and a ;few fibres of the tibialis posticus. On reaching the an- itterior aspect of the leg, it passes nearly vertically down- 'VTvards, at first between the tibialis anticus and extensor ^ccommunis, then between thetibialis anticusand extensor Fpolhcis longus, and lastly, between the extensor pollicis aand extensor communis, passing with the tendon of the 2 p 2368 ARTERIES AND VEINS. latter beneath the annular ligament, at the lower mar- gin of which it terminates in the dorsahs pedis. iHe anterior tibial nerve, a branch of the peroneal, is m com- pany with it, being at first external and anterior to it; a little below the centre of the leg, immediately over it; and below, internal to it. . , -x ;+o Remarks.—This artery is very deeply situated at its commencement, but becomes comparatively superficial near its termination. . . Anomalies.-ln case of this vessel arising high up m the popliteal space, it may run to its ^^'^^^^ ^'^^^r under or through the poplit^us muscle; where, however, it is less than the normal size it will be found to ter- minate usually at the ankle-joint, the anterior peronea Uking its place, or where it is larger than ordinary it may -surp the position of the latter, and likewise as he dorsalis pedis, compensate by its anastomosis with the external plankr for a deficiency of caliber in this latter COLLATERAL BRANCHES.-Anterior tibial recurrent, muscular, and internal and external malleolar.

Collateral Branches.—Tarsal, metatarsal, commu- nicating, and princeps pollicis. Tarsal.—Generally a small branch, arising imme- diately below the annular ligament; it passes outwards and forwards beneath the extensor brevis, supplying it and the structures of the dorsum of the foot, and ulti- mately bending backwards and outwards, terminates at the external malleohis by anastomosing with the malleo- lar, peroneal, and metatarsal. Metatarsal Larger than the last, below which it arises; it also bends downwards and outwards beneath the common extensor tendons, and then, arching back- wards and outwards, terminates at the external malleo- lus by communicating with the peroneal and tarsal; from the convexity of the arch, which is directed towards the toes, four digital branches are given off, which, bi- furcating at the clefts between each of the four outer toes, supply their adjacent sides, while three interos- seous branches are detached from it inferiorly to supply those muscles, and to anastomose with similar ones from the deep plantar arch. CoMMDNiCATiNG BRANCH may be considered as the true termination of the dorsalis pedis; it comes off in common Avith the princeps pollicis, and, piercing the first interosseous spaces, inosculates with the external plantar. Princeps Pollicis arises in common with the last, and runs downwards and forwards along the first inter- osseous space, crossed by the inner tendon of the ex- tensor brevis, and, dividing into two branches, the internal is distributed to the inner side of the great toe, while the external, subdividing, supplies the opposed surface, of the great and second toes. Remarks.—The supply of the toes may be thus briefly recapitulated. The muscular structure of the three outer toes and a half is supplied by the deep plantar arch, while that of the great toe, and half the second,870 ARTERIES AND VEINS. receives its nutrition from the dorsalis pedis; but the integument of the three outer toes and a half is supplied by the metatarsal branch of the dorsalis pedis, while to the skin of the inner toe, and half the second, the internal plantar artery is distributed. Hence it may be observed, that a very close analogy exists in the distri bution of the vessels of the lower and upper extremi- ties, the anterior tibial representing the radial, and the posterior the ulnar. VENOUS SYSTEM. For the purpose of examining the veins, they should be injected from the branches towards the heart; but as these vessels are usually found distended with blood after death, the larger branches are sufficiently evident for the purpose of the anatomist; but if it is an object to follow the osseal venous networks, or the minute ra- dicles and plexuses of organs, their artificial distension becomes absolutely indispensable. The veins are divi- sible into the general and portal systems, whilst the ior- mer may again be subdivided into thoracic, cervico-ce- phalic, brachial, abdominal, femoral, and Rachidian._ Vena Cava Descendens.—This large trunk, which receives all the veins from the upper half of the body, is about three inches in length, two inches being situated without the pericardium, and one withm that sac. it commences at the upper margin of the cartilage of the second rib at its junction with the sternum on the right side, and, running downwards, inwards, and forwards, terminates at the posterior superior angle of the riglit auricle, where the posterior part of its cylinder is con- tinuous with the inferior cava. In this course it is curved, the concavity being towards the left side, and as it pierces the fibrous pericardium a thin process ot that membrane is prolonged upwards on its coats; some- times, however, this vessel is replaced by the two vena3 innominataj, opening separately mto the Collateral BRANCHES.-The vena azygos opens mto its posterior and right side, just as the serous layer ot theCricardium is tbout being reflected from the vesse , also pericardial branches, right phrenic, internal mam-VENOUS SYSTEM. 871 mary, mediastinal, thymic, and occasionally the right inferior thyroid and vertebral veins. Relations.—Extra-pericardial:—Behind, the trachea and the pneumogastric nerve of the right side; in front, thymus gland, and, in its lower part, phrenic nerve; ex- ternally, phrenic nerve, pleura, and right lung; inter- nally, aorta, on which it is moulded. Intra-pericardial: —Behind, right bronchus, pulmonary artery and vein; in front, the pericardium and right auricle with its ap- pendix; and internally, aorta. In this latter stage it does not receive any branches. Brachio-cephalic, or Innominate Veins, are two, right and left, being formed by the confluence of the in- ternal jugular and subclavian veins, opposite to the sterno-clavicular articulations of their respective sides, and, uniting opposite the upper margin of the second rib, they form the superior cava. Eight vena innominata, about one inch and a half in length, passes from the ster- no-clavicular articulation downwards and towards the mesian line, lying on the right wall of the anterior medi- astinum, pneumogastric nerve, and internal mammary artery; whilst externally it corresponds to the lung and pleura; and internally to the arteria innominata and commencement of the right subclavian, with the pneu- mogastric nerve, being covered by the clavicle, first rib, and right margin of the sternum. Left vena innominata passes obliquely from left to right, being curved, the concavity directed upwards and backwards; it crosses the left pneumogastric nerve, internal mammary artery, left subclavian, thoracic duct, carotid, trachea, arch of the aorta, arteria innominata, and occasionally the right pneumogastric, being covered by the sternum, thymus gland, and deep cervical fascia, which binds it to the anterior and superior part of the aorta. The following collateral branches open into these veins:—Inferior thy- roid, which, commencing as two trunks, descend from the thyroid body in front of the trachea, both usually opening into the vein of the left side; these branches may be united in front of the trachea by a cross vessel, or they may form an intricate network on its anterior part, calculated to impede greatly the operation of tra- cheotomy ; the left internal mammary also opens into theARTERIES AND VEINS. 872 left vein, whilst the right terminates in the confluence of the two branches, where they form the cava; the left phrenic, pericardiac, and mediastinal veins have a simi- lar termination, whilst the right open into the cava. The vertebral vein commences at the transverse process of the atlas by a branch of communication with the oc- cipital, frequently receiving a small vein, which emerges from the posterior condyloid foramen, producing a communication with the lateral sinus, then descending in the succession of foramina in the transverse processes of the cervical vertebras, until it reaches the sixth, where it may divide into two,—one passing m front ot the subclavian artery, and the second behind that vessel, to terminate in the brachio-cephalic veins of their cor- responding sides; but although we have given these vessels as opening in the ven^ innommatiE, still we do not believe that such a termination is the rule, but ra- ther the exception, as we have almost invariably seen them open into the subclavian. There are many pomts ot difference between the right and left venae innominate: thus the latter is the longer, more oblique, and larger, and it should be borne in mind that in infancy it is close to the superior edge of the sternum, which should in- duce a great amount of caution when prolongmg the incision for tracheotomy downwards. The Jugular Veins are four in number on each side,— namely, the external, internal, anterior, and posterior. EXTERNAL Jugular is formed in the lower lobe ot the parotid gland by the superficial temporal veins, which, uniting with the transverse facial, constitute the temporo-facial, and this again being joined by the in- ternal maxillary, the vessel receives the name of tem- poro-maxillary; and lastly, by the posterior auricular But sometimes the external jugular commences by an arched branch, which connects it with the internal iugular, and, receiving the veins before mentioned, and Vin<r at first beneath the fascia, then becoming super- /cial to it, and crossing the surface of the sterno-ma^^^ toid, covered only by the platysma, it passes down^ids, backwards, andout'vards, as far as the PO^^erior infenor triangle of the neck, and terminates by piercing t e fascia and opening into the subclavian vein. In the873 VENOUS SYSTEM. neck it receives the following:—One branch of the fa- cial, lateral cutaneous veins of the neck, transversalis colli and humeri, and a small branch of communication from the cephalic, passing over and sometimes under the clavicle. This vein possesses two valves,—one as it crosses the sterno-mastoid, and the second where it ter- minates, and in this latter situation a dilatation occurs, always augmented in cases where obstructive disease of the heart or lungs is present; these valves are, however, merely rudimentary. We have seen this vein totally absent, dnd in one case double. The external jugular is occasionally selected for phlebotomy, an operation which should be performed in the following manner:— Rotate the head to the opposite side, and place the thumb of the left hand on the vein near the posterior edge of the sterno-mastoid, and then introduce the lancet in a direction upwards and backwards, or contrary to the fibres of the platysma myhoides, the pressure being continued until the wound is closed: first, to prevent the descent of the venous blood, and secondly, to avert the entrance of air and its passage towards the heart, a danger which is much exaggerated. Temporal Vein, or Temporo-facial, commences by superficial, deep, and middle branches. The superficial is formed by the temporo-frontal and temporo-occipital plexuses, which, uniting, produce a trunk, that, passing downwards over the horizontal root of the zygoma, is joined by the transverse facial vein. Middle Temporal commences by the confluence of the palpebral and orbital veins, and passing backwards, at first between the two layers of the temporal aponeu- rosis, becomes then deeper, being situated between the fascia and muscle where it runs downwards and back- wards, and, piercing the fascia from within outwards, opens into the temporal trunk anterior to the meatus auditorius externus; the deep branch, which may be called the internal maxillary, commences by the fol- lowing:—Venas comites of the middle meningeal artery, inferior dental, deep masseteric, pterygoid, and temporal, and, running backwards, joins the temporal, but pre- vious to this receiving the transverse facial,—a small vein commencing by tlie masseteric plexus and passing874 ARTERIES AND VEINS. backwards, sometimes double, above Steno's duct, ter- minates in the temporal vein above the internal maxil- lary. Thus, as far as the junction of the internal max- illary, the vein receives the name of temporo-facial, and as far as the entrance of the posterior auris,—the tem- poro-maxillary, this trunk being superficial in the pa- rotid above, but becoming deep inferiorly, where it joins the external jugular, in its course separating the portio dura from the external carotid artery. The posterior auris commences by auricular and stylo-mastoid branches, and, passing backwards in the parotid, opens into the external jugular. Internal Jugular Vein commences in the foramen lacerum posterius, at the termination of the lateral si- nus, and, descending on the outer side of the internal and common carotid arteries, unites at the sterno-cla- vicular articulation with the subclavian, to form the vena innominata. Whilst in the foramen lacerum, it presents an enlargement (gulf of the jugular), here re- ceiving the inferior petrosal sinus; opposite the cornu of the°os hyoides a second dilatation occurs where the following veins join the trunk:—Facial, lingual, occi- pital, ascending pharyngeal, and the superior thyroid; whilst below this transverse branches from the thyroid body, as well as communicating twigs from the anterior jugular, join it in its descent, and at the point of termi- nation a large oblong dilatation occurs, Avhich is occa- sionally twice the size of the original trunk. It lies in its course downwards on the rectus capitis anticus ma- jor and longus colli, and is closely attached to the ca- rotid above, the pneumogastric nerve intervening, but inferiorly diverging from the artery, more so ou the ri-ht than on the left side, forming the outer boundary ofa triangular space, through which the vagus passes in its course to the thorax. . Facial Vein commences on the frontal region, and descending by the side of the root of the nose is umted to its fellow by a transverse branch, then, passing down- wards and backwards, is joined by the nasal and sub- frontal branches, being here called the angular vein; next receiving branches from the eyelids, it runs obliquely downwards and backwards beneath the zygomatic mus-875 VENOUS SYSTEM. cles, behind the facial artery, and in front of the an- terior edge of the inasseter crosses obliquely the ramvis of the jaw, and is then received into a groove in the posterior edge of the submaxillary gland, then, curving downwards and backwards, divides into two branches, one of which joins the external, and the other the in- ternal, jugular vein. In its course it receives the great alveolar vein, which commences immediately behind the jugal ridge of the superior maxillary bone by the union of the Vidian, superior palatine, and spheno-palatine veins in a plexiform arrangement, and passing forwards beneath the zygomatic muscles, and being joined by the superior dental and infra-orbital, it opens into the facial, which is increased to nearly double its diameter after its reception; the facial vein also receives masseteric, nasal, coronary, and labial branches, and whilst in the neck it is joined by the glandular palatine, submental, and tonsillitic. Lingual Veins.—These consist of a dorsal plexus, situated between the mucous membrane and the mus- cular tissue of the organ, which unite to form a dorsal trunk on the base of the tongue, accompanying the lingual nerve to terminate on each side in the facial or pharyngeal veins, and likewise, of the inferior or ranine trunks, which are seen lying longitudinally on the under surface of the tongue, forming an eminence be- neath the mucous membrane, and joining the lingual venous trunks, which are two in number, and accom- pany the artery of that name, terminating either in the internal jugular or facial vein; but they often form a common trunk with the thyroid and facial as they ap- proach the jugular. Thyroid Veins.—Superior transverse commence by branches corresponding to the divisions of the supe- rior thyroid arteries, particularly receiving the efferent branches from the larynx; it passes backwards over the external and internal carotids and pneumogastric nerves, and terminates in the internal jugular vein, but often as we have seen it uniting with the lingual and facial, we have never observed its termination in either the external or anterior jugular. Inferior transverse commences in the lateral lobe of the thyroid body at876 ARTERIES AND VEINS, the junction of its middle and inferior thirds, also re- ceiving branches from the larynx, trachea, and (Eso- phagus, and, passing downwards, backwards, and out- wards over the common carotid, it terminates in the internal jugular; we have frequently observed the absence of this branch. Occipital Vein commences by long and tortuous branches in the dense skin of the scalp; these coalescing form a trunk which is sometimes double, and which follows the course of the occipital artery, terminating in the internal, and rarely in the external jugular; as this trunk lies on the superior oblique it receives the mastoid vein, which maintains a communication with the lateral sinus. Phauyngeal Vein is formed by a superficial and deep plexus, the former lying between the muscles and their fascial envelope, whilst the latter are situated be- neath the mucous layer; they unite to form a trunk, which is exceedingly variable as to its mode of termi- nation, that point being sometimes the internal jugular, the facial, lingual, or thyroid trunks. The Diploic Veins are observed by rasping oli the external table of one of the flat cranial bones, and they consist merely of the lining membrane, surrounded by an osseous sheath of condensed diploe; they communi- cate with each other in the distinct bones at all periods of life but in the separate bones only when the sutures have become obliterated by age; they also communicate with the sinuses and external veins of the scalp, but their peculiarity seems to be in presenting elevated lips of the lining membrane similar to valves, these being absent in the diploic veins of the general osseous system. It is almost superfluous to state, that each cranial bone has its separate venous plexus, as frontal, parietal, (tc. Anterior Jugular Vein commences m the supra- hyoid region in a variety of modes,—as from the inferior labial, or submental, and even from the facial vein itsell; and lastly, by branches of communication with the deep or the external jugular; it descends in the substance of the deep cervical fascia, internal to the anterior margin of the sterno-mastoid, and over the sterno-hyoid muscle, and then, reaching the upper margin of the sternum, it877 VENOUS SYSTEM. bends outwards behind the inferior attachments of the sterno-mastoid, and opens into tlie subclavian, internal to the entrance of the external jugular, sometimes in common with it. During its course it receives several communicating branches from the internal and external jugular, and immediately above the sternum a trans- verse branch unites them, which receives small twigs from the descending thyroid veins, and below this a branch ascends from the thorax to enter it, which is always large in the lactating female. This vein is fre- quently absent, and is always inversely proportioned to the external jugular. Posterior Jugular Vein commences in the occi- pito-atloid space by a branch from the occipital, verte- bral, and often likewise receiving the small vein which escapes through the posterior condyloid foramen; it passes backwards to clear that space, then runs down- wards and inwards, communicating with that of the opposite side at the transverse process of the axis, then, curving downwards and outwards between the com- plexus and semispinalis colli, covered by the splenius, it winds forwards at the root of the neck, between the transverse process of the seventh cervical vertebra and the upper margin of the first rib, and opens into the posterior part of the corresponding vena innominata, or into the subclavian; we have also seen it joining the external jugular. It receives in its course cross branches from the vertebral and the supraspinous venous plexus, as well as from the muscles of the neck, and its deve- lopement is always inversely proportioned to that of the vertebral veins; it likewise forms a part of the posterior external Eachidian system. VEINS OF THE UPPER EXTREMITY. We will commence the description with those of the hand, first examining the superficial set up to the axilla, and subsequently those deeper branches accompanying the arteries of the fore-arm and arm. Veins of the Hano—These are principally found on the dorsal region, being situated in that position in order to obviate the pressure to which they would bo con-ARTERIES AND VEINS. 878 stantly subjected were they placed on the palmar aspect. The digital veins consist of long branches running on the sides and posterior aspect of the fingers, and fre- quently communicating with each other by plexiform branches at the metacarpo-phalangeal sulci; those of the opposed surfaces unite, constituting trunks which, opening into an irregular arch, form the collateral branches of the dorsal venous arch, this giving off from its external and internal angles the cephalic and basilic veins respectively. p t, i i Cephalic Vein commences on the back of the band by a branch from the thumb, one from the index finger, and from the external extremity of the dorsal venous plexus-, it then winds forwards over the supinator longus tendon, and about the junction of the inferior and middle thirds of the fore-arm it receives a branch formed by radicles from the ball of the thumb; and also another from the median venous plexus which lies over the annular ligament; then ascending, it receives branches from the outer and back part of the fore-arm, and, reaching the bend of the elbow, it lies between the tendon of the biceps and the inner edge of the supinator longus, then passes upwards along the outer side ot the arm, at first between the biceps and triceps, then in a sulcus between the deltoid and pectoral, and arching downwards inferior to the clavicle, and over the lesser pectoral, it pierces the costo-coraco-clavicular ligament, opening into the axillary vein, immediately prior to its termination receiving a branch from the external jugu- lar which passes over, sometimes under, the clavicle; this vein resembles the saphena in the lower extremity. Basilic Vein arises by a large branch from the in- ternal extremity of the dorsal venous arch, of which it appears the more direct efferent vessel (vena Salvatella), then winds forwards over the ulnar extensor, about the middle of the fore-arm being joined by the cutaneous ulnar vein, then ascending over the cutaneous aspect of the pronator radii teres, and running on the inner side of the arm, it pierces the brachial lascia, and ter- minates by being joined by the vena^ comites to consti- tute the common brachial vein. • j . Median Vein commences from a plexus situated overVENOUS SYSTEM. 879 the annular ligament, and, ascending a little to the outer side of the middle of the fore-arm, perforates the fascia about an inch below the flexure of the joint to termi- nate in one of the vense comites of the brachial, thus constituting the mediana profunda; but it also gives off two additional branches,—median basilic, which, run- ning upwards and inwards over the origins of the flexors and pronators, with the semilunar fascia of the biceps, this latter structure separating it from the brachial ar- tery, it joins the basilic vein; while the median cepha- lic, passing upwards and outwards over the external cutaneous nerve in the fissure between the tendon of the biceps and the supinator longus, enters the cephalic vein. It must be observed, that these veins are by no means regular in size, number, or arrangement, fre- quently differing on the opposite sides of the same sub- ject, so that in the foregoing description we have merely selected the more usual course. In their whole extent they are situated in the superficial fascia. The Deep Veins of the Fore-arm are, the radial, ulnar and interosseal, which, being usually two for each arterial vessel, exactly follow their course. The Brachial Veins are double, but at the junction of the upper and middle third of the artery they unite with the basilic to form a single trunk. We say that the former unite with the latter, because the resulting vein is in the direct course of the basilic, and lies in- ternal to the brachial artery, but sometimes the three branches remain separate, even to the point where the vessels are supported by the subscapular tendon. Axillary Vein.—This is a large trunk, forming a continuation of the brachial, commencing at the lower edge of the latissimus dorsi and teres major tendons; and, passing upwards, forwards, and inwards in an arched direction, it terminates at the lower border of the first rib, at tiie commencement of the subclavian. Below, or in its first stage, it lies in front of the axillary artery; in the second stage, still anterior, but a little internal; and above, or in the third, anterior and internal, and usually a little inferior; as it lies beneath the clavicle a process of the ligamentum bicorne is prolonged on it, this tubule having a tendency to retain the vessel in a pa-880 ARTERIES AND VEINS. tulous condition wlien divided, insomuch that the tying of the vessel in amputation at the shoulder-joint has been recommended; however, it was not at all neces- sary to apply a ligature in a case of amputation of the shoulder performed by Mr. Rumley in the year 1820; nor was it tied by Mr. Rynd, of the Meath Hospital, in his recent operation, according to the account that we have received. It appears that if the vessel is divided high up, that a greater probability of its remaining patulous occurs, than when cut low down in the axilla, and with this opinion our friend Mr. Butcher coincides. The inner head of the median, and the communicat- ing branch between the anterior and middle thoracic nerves, separate the vein from the artery, and it re- ceives the circumflex, subscapular, and long thoracic veins, just at the lower edge of the lesser pectoral, pro- ducing an enlargement at this point (sinus of axillary vein).°The subscapular is a large trunk about one inch in length, commencing by an anterior and posterior branch" corresponding to the divisions of the artery of the same name; these, uniting, form the trunk, which opens into the inner side of the axillary vein, anterior to the artery, and internal division of the brachial plexus; above the lesser pectoral the axillary vein re- ceives the anterior circumflex, acromial thoracic, with muscular branches from the deltoid, and superiorly the cephalic trunk. . . The Subclavian Vein commences as a continuation oi the axillary at the lower margin of the first rib, and terminates at the sterno-clavicular articulation, by uniting with the internal jugular to constitute the vena innominata. It lies anterior and inferior to the artery, and bein"- transverse in direction is compared to a chord subtending the arc of a circle. Anteriorly, the rela- tions are similar to the artery; inferiorly, cone ot the pleura and first rib; and behind, the subclavian artery; anterior scalenus and phrenic nerve. Both right and left veins are about the same length, and they receive the anterior, external, and sometimes posterior jugulars, and sometimes the vertebral.881 VENOUS SYSTEM. PELVIC AND ABDOMINAL VEINS. The External Iliac Vein commences atthetermina- nation of the femoral on the linea ilio-pectiuea, passes upwards and inwards, and at the shoulder of the sacrum unites with the internal to form the common iliac vein. Inferiorly these veins lie internal to their corresponding arteries; the left then passing behind the internal iliac artery to reach the left iliac vein, so that it remains internal, and a little posterior to its corresponding trunk, whilst the right, during its ascent, gets behind its artery; but in a preparation in our own possession it continues to lie internal, passing first behind the right internal iliac, and afterwards behind the bifurcation of the common iliac. The external iliac veins are sup- ported by the iliac fascia and psoa3 muscles, being co- vered by the peritoneiim, Abernethy's fascia, and are crossed by the vasa deferentia and the epigastric arteries. The branches opening into the trunk are, the deep epigastric, which terminate in the inner and anterior part of the vessel, and the internal circumflex ilii, which, crossing the external iliac artery, opens into the outer and anterior part of the vein; both these veins are double, but they usually unite prior to their termina- tion, and the latter sometimes continues double, when one branch passes before, and the other behind, the ex- ternal iliac artery. Internal Iliac Vein commences by the confluence of the glutasal, sciatic, pudic, obturator, and lateral sacral veins which correspond to the arterial branches, as well as by the eflPerent branches of the pelvic visceral plexuses, which consist of haemorrhoidal, vesical, and in the female, uterine and vaginal. H^kmorrhoidal Plexus surrounds the inferior third of the rectum, lying external to the muscular tunic, and supported by the fibrous tubule derived from the lateral vesical ligaments; they communicate in front with the vesical plexus, and behind with the middle sa- cral vein, which connects it with the Eachidian system, and lastly it communicates with the deep haemorrhoidal plexus, which lies beneath tho mucous layer, being best marked near the anus. From this plexus the blood882 ARTERIES AND VEINS. is carried off by the superior, middle, and inferior lias- morrhoidal veins; the former forming the commence- ment of the inferior mesenteric, and the two latter opening into the internal iliac. Vesical Plexus.—This extensive and intricate ve- nous plexus surrounds the prostate, neck, and inferior fundus of the bladder, receiving in front the dorsal veins of the penis, and communicating with the hemorrhoidal plexus; they are supported by the recto-vesical fascia, so that when divided their orifices remain patent, producing troublesome haemorrhage; they are also fre- quently dilated in old persons, particularly those suf- fering from obstructive diseases of the urinary passages, and in some cases projecting into the vesical cavity as hsemorrhoids, or they may contain small calcareous bo- dies (phleboliths). The blood is conveyed from this plexus to the internal iliac by two branches,—the proper vesical veins. Vaginal Plexus consists of a series of loops sur- rounding this canal, receiving numerous branches from the spongy structure of the part, as well as from the submucous plexus, which is largely developed mfe- riorly, and it communicates in front with the vesical, and behind with the hgemorrhoidal plexuses; two branches convey its blood into the internal iliac. Uterine Plexus An intricate interlacement of ve- nous branches, situated on the sides of the uterus, receiv- ing the blood from the transverse uterine sinuses which is conveyed into the internal iliac by two branches. The venous organization of the uterus undergoes a remark- able augmentation during pregnancy, and hence a gravid uterus should be selected for their examination, when they will be observed to communicate freely with the ovarian and hasmorrhoidal veins. Many of the pelvic veins possess valves, but we have satisfied ourselves of their absence in the hfemorrhoidal plexus. „ I 4. The Internal Iliac Veins are from three-quarters to one inch and a half in length, the right lying usually external to the artery, the left on the internal side; but we have seen both placed internal to their correspond- ing vessels. In a number of cases a thin layer oi lasciaVENOUS SYSTEM. 883 binds them down and preserves their relations, and the peritoneum covers their entire length. Common Iliac Veins are two in number,—right and left, commencing opposite the sacro-iliac symphisis, the right on the posterior and external side of its corre- sponding artery. At the upper third of the body of the fifth lumbar vertebra it unites with the left iliac to form the inferior cava, whilst the left, formed on the internal side of its corresponding artery, crosses the body of the fifth lumbar vertebra, anterior vaginal liga- ment, and middle sacral artery, covered by the perito- neum, commencement of the rectum, ureter, and near its termination by the right common iliac artery, behind which it runs to join the cava. The common iliacs do not, as a general rule, receive collateral branches, with the exception of the middle sacral vein, which opens into the left, but we have seen the ilio-lumbar veins terminating in them on both sides. Inferior Cava is formed by the confluence of the common iliac veins on the right side and upper third of the body of the fifth lumbar vertebra, and ascends at first vertically, but having reached a point correspond- ing to the third lumbar vertebra, it curves a little to- wards the right side, entering a groove in the posterior edge of the liver, then, passing through the caval open- ing in the diaphragm, it enters the pericardium, and, turning towards the mesian line, terminates in the pos- terior and inferior angle of the right auricle. Relative Anatomy.—It lies on vertebrte, intervertebral substance, anterior vaginal ligament, and when dis- tended on the anterior margin of the psoas and sympa- thetic nerve, right renal artery, crus of diaphragm, and right phrenic artery. It is covered by the right com- mon iliac artery, right spermatic, mesentery, and small intestines, inferior transverse portion of the duodenum, head of pancreas, vena porta?, superior transverse por- tion of duodenum, and the lobulus dexter of the liver; it is a little constricted as it passes through the quadri- lateral tendinous diaphragmatic opening, but on enter- ing the pericardium it again enlarges and diminishes as it enters the auricle (see Anatomy of Diaphragm). In its course it receives the lumbar, right spermatic, renal,ARTERIES AND VEINS. 884 venae cavas hepaticsp, and phrenic veins, and it presents two dilatations,—one where the renal, and the other where the hepatic, veins open into it, a normal, well- marked dilatation existing at the latter point in diving animals. We have seen this vein diminished to the size of a crowquill in a case of cirrhosis of the liver, whilst the first, second, and third lumbar, with the three in- ferior intercostal and the internal Rachidian veins, were enormously enlarged, and communicated with the vena azygos, which, equalling the normal cava in diameter, presented near its termination a dilatation as large as an egg, which was buried in the right lung, evidently taking up the function of the inferior cava. Spermatic Veins.—Each vessel commences by a num- ber of small branches, which pierce the tunica albugi- nea on the inner side of the epididymis, and, uniting with the veins of that body, they form five or six trunks, lying in front of the vas deferens, and being particularly prone to enlargement near the external ring. They communicate with the dorsal veins of the penis, internal and external pudic veins, and then cours- ing through the inguinal canal, they unite to form either a single or double trunk, that leaves the vas de- ferens at the internal ring, and running upwards and inwards over the psoas muscle, the right opens into the ascending cava, whilst the left, curving inwards, termi- nates in the left renal vein. The spermatic veins form a very intricate plexus, particularly on the left side, as they lie on the psoaj muscles (plexus pampiniforme), and the left vein passes behind the sigmoid flexure ot the colon in its ascent, which may account for the greater frequency of varicocele on this side. The coats ot these veins are exceedingly thin, resembling those of the lym- phatics, but they are destitute of valves. Lumbar Veins—These will be described with the Rachidian System. i-j^^^ Renal Veins emerge from the hilus of the kidney, the left crossing the abdominal aorta behind the inlenor transverse portion of the duodenum, and the right lying in front of the right renal artery, and behind the duo- denum, both terminating in the cava. The suprarena , consisting of three branches, open into the same vessel.885 VENOUS SYSTEM. Hepatic Veins.—The radicles whicli form these com- mence in the centre of the lobule (intralobular vein), and this terminates in the sublobular, and by the union of the latter the hepatic veins are formed, consisting of from three to five trunks, situated at the posterior thick edge of the liver, between the layers of the coronary li- gament, and having received the obliterated ductus ve- nosus, they open separately into the cava. The Phrenic Veins do not present any peculiarity, being merely the accompanying branches of the phrenic arteries. Vena Portjs.—This large vein, although considered with propriety to represent a separate system, may still with convenience be examined in connexion with the abdominal vessels. This large trunk, about four and a half inches in length, formed on the forepart of the aorta behind the head of the pancreas, and opposite the upper margin of the second lumbar vertebra, passes upwards, forwards, and towards the right side, and reaching the liver, divides into a right and left branch, which, com- ing off at right angles with the original trunk, enters the transverse fissure, and follows the ramifications of the hepatic artery in the substance of the liver. Relations.—In front, pancreas, superior transverse por- tion of the duodenum, hepatic artery, and ductus com- munis choledochus; behind, the right crus of the dia- phragm, spine, and inferior cava, which it crosses obliquely, separated from it, however, by the foramen of Winslow. Collateral Branches.—Superior mesenteric and splenic veins, but the inferior mesenteric opens into the splenic nearly an inch to the left side of the point where the confluence of the two first form the porta. Superior Mesenteric Vein follows the course of the artery of the same name, receiving at its point of com- mencement in foetal life the omphalo-meseraic vein, which ramified on the umbilical vesicle, it receives the ileo-colic, right, and middle colic veins, and from twelve to twenty small branches arising from the small intes- tines, and which, passing between the layers of the me- sentery, open into the left side of the vein. Inferior Mesenteric Vein commences by the su-886 ARTERIES AND VEINS. perior hsemorrlaoidal vein from the plexus of that name, then receiving the sigmoid and left colic branches, it ascends to open at right angles into the splenic, an inch to the left side of the portal confluence. Splenic Vein commences by numerous branches which coalesce at the hilus of the spleen, and then passes almost transversely towards the right, lying posterior and inferior to the pancreas and its correspondmg ar- tery, which is tortuous, but the vein is perfectly straight; and having received the inferior mesenteric, pancreatic, and gastric veins, terminates in the porta. The Vena Port^, with its branches, are peculiar m being devoid of valves, although a contrary opinion was maintained by Bauer; still, modern authorities agree that they are absent; it is also peculiar in possessing remark- ably thick coats, so that when the trunk is divided it remains patulous; again it commences by branches and terminates also in branches, and the blood which it con- tains ministers to secretion. A case is mentioned by Abernethy where the porta terminated m the inferior cava, failing to reach the liver; but in this instance the umbilical vein was patulous. In obstruction to the por- tal circulation in the liver, ascites is sometimes absent, which Dr. Lyons has accounted for by the Eachidian sys- tem becoming the efferent vessels of the portal, the vena azygos being found dilated in connexion with these peculiarities. Dilatation of the abdominal veins m the vicinity of the umbilicus, compared to the head ol the Medusa, is recorded by Kokitansky, uniformly associated with adult patency of the umbilical vein and cirrhosis ot the liver The veins of the lower extremity are divisible into superficial and deep,—the former are the internal and external saphense, whilst the latter pursue the course of the deep arteries of the limb. . . , j Internal SAPHENA._The longest vem in the body , it commences at the internal extremity ot the tarsal arch of veins, and, passing upwards and backwards, it ascends in front of the internal malleolus, and immedi- ately above this, it receives the internal calcaneal vein which ascends behind the interna malleolus to join it, then continuing its course upwards, lying ner edge of the gastrocnemius, it curves backwards be887 VENOCS SYSTEM. hind the inner condyle of the femur, receiving, just below this point, a communicating branch from the anterior tibial vein, which is remarkable from the num- ber of its valves; also the internal inferior articular vein; it then passes forwards over the sartorius, vastus internus, adductors magnus and longus; and whilst lying over the latter it is joined by the internal and posterior cutaneous veins of the thigh, by which it is increased to double its original size, and arriving at a point about fourteen lines (we have seen it only six) below Pou- part's ligament, it curves a little outwards and back- wards, and, piercing the cribiform fascia and the saphenic opening, which sends a tubule on the vessel, it terminates in the internal and anterior part of the femoral vein; whilst into its curve, the convexity of which looks up- wards, the superficial epigastric, circumflex ilii, and pudic veins open. During its whole course the internal saphena lies in the substance of the superficial fascia, and the valves are from five to seven in number, but in one case we counted nine,—six in the femoral portion and three in the crural; several communications occur be- tween this vessel and the deep veins,—namely, below with the internal plantar and calcaneal; at the inner con- dyle ofthe tibia, with the anteriortibial; abovethis, with the internal articular; and lastly, with the femoral. As the vein lies over the space between the tendons of the gracilis and sartorius, it is separated from the internal saphenous nerve, which lies beneath it, by the aponeu- rosis of the latter muscle; but at the inner condyle ofthe tibia the nerve is at first anterior, then crosses the vein, lying posterior, and lastly, it becomes anterior again. External or Posterior Saphena commences at the external extremity of the tarsal arch, and passing upwards and backwards behind the external malleolus, It receives the external calcaneal vein, and, ascending on the posterior surface of the gastrocnemius, the crural : aponeurosis intervening, and arriving at the centre ' ol the poplitseal space, it pierces the fascia, and opens linto the posterior and external side ofthe popliteal ; vein, opposite the flexure of the knee-joint. This vein 1 is accompanied in its upper fourth by the tibialis com- 1 municans, and in the remainder of its course by the888 ARTERIES AND VEINS. posterior saphenous nerve, on which it lies, but separated from it by a layer of fascia; it possesses two valves, one of which is found at its entrance into the poplitaeal, and the second corresponding to the upper third of the gas- trocnemius; however, we have counted five valves m this vein. Sometimes this vessel, when it arrives at the poplitEEal space, divides into two branches, one of which terminates as usual, passing between the pero- neal and posterior tibial nerves, but always nearer to the latter, in order to reach its destination, whilst the second curves upwards and inwards around the inner side of the thigh, to communicate with the internal saphenous. . , The Deep Veins commence m the sole and dor- sum of the foot, and terminate at Poupart's ligament as the femoral. We will trace them from below up- ^^Plantar Veins are external and internal, the for- mer being the larger of the two, and they follow the course of the corresponding arteries, opening poste- riorly into the venee comites of the posterior tibial ar- tery. The external plantar is nearly four times larger than the internal, and it receives all the muscular branches from the sole of the foot, whilst both are the eflPerent vessels of the deep plantar venous plexuses, as the superficial open into the dorsal venous arch, wind- ing upwards on the outer and inner margins of the *^ Posterior Tibial Veins are two in number, lying one on either side of the corresponding artery, and frequently communicating with each other by cross branches. We have seen but one vein accompanying this vessel, in which case it received the peroneal three inches above the ankle-joint; we have also seen he posterior tibial veins leaving the artery about t e Lddleofthe leg, and passing beneath the margin o th^^^ flexor poUicis to join the peroneal, the PO«f *^bial artery not having any accompanying vem from the point mentioned until it arrived at the lower margin of '^SneTvein accompanies the artery of that name, being double like the last, than which it is much larger,889 VENOUS SYSTEM. m consequence of receiving all the muscular branches from the posterior and external part of the leg, and it opens into the popliteeal. When laid open it presents a cribriform appearance, in consequence of the muscular branches opening separately in the peroneal, and not by a single trunk. Anterior Tibial Vein—Also double; accompanying the corresponding artery, and passing through the in° terosseous space, they terminate in the poplitteal. Popliteal Vein. — About half-an-inch above the lower edge of the poplit^us, sometimes at the' inferior margin, the popliteal or main artery of the limb is for the first time accompanied by a single vein,—the poplitseal, which is formed by the confluence of the anterior and posterior tibial, and peroneal veins, which, however, all unite into single trunks prior to their confluence, and which, situated at first posterior and internal to the artery, in the middle of the space lying directly poste- rior, and superiorly being posterior and external, whilst at the oval opening in the adductor magnus, in addition to being posterior, it is also slightly external, a relation which is well seen when both veins and arteries have been injected. Collateral Branches.—Posterior saphenous, arti- cular, and the sural veins which ascend from the gas- trocnemius between its two heads, being remarkable for the number of their valves; superior muscular branches from the hamstrings likewise join it above. The popli- tasal vein is very intimately connected to the artery a little below the centre of the space, and inferiorly it always seems flattened on account of the peculiar manner in which the sural veins join it, and its coats are thick and extremely resisting. The Femoral Vein commences at the oval opening in the triceps, forming the continuation of the poplita;al, and lying in Hunter's canal directly posterior to the artery; about one inch above its commencement it re- ceives the ven£B comites of the anastomotica magna ar- tery, and at the apex of Scarpa's space it continues to hold the same relation, but from this point it gradually wmds upwards and inwards, appearing on the inner side of the femoral artery at a mean distance of two 2 Q890 ARTERIES AND VEINS. inches and a half below Poupart's ligament and it is only at the ilio-pectineal line that it lies directly internal to it, being supported in this situation by the pectmeus muscle, and frequently by the bone only, where it joins the external iliac vein. At about one inch and three- quarters below Poupart's ligament it receives the pro- tinda vein, which increases it to nearly double its ori- ginal size, and superior to this the internal ^aphena tbe former opening by an oblique oval aperture, whilst that of the lafter is ne'arly circular. Near the pubis the vein can be separated from the artery with great ease, but inferiorly the union of the two is much more intimate, but not lo great as. that of the popliteal vein to its cor- responding vessel. Professor Porter has remarked, with much trufh, that the adhesion of the femoral vem and Stery is always increased when popliteal aneurism ex- ists this we have observed in three cases, even m one where the aneurism scarcely exceeded the size of a spht walntit. It should be observed that the vem and artery ri contained in the same sheath, only separated by a Smo-EACHiDUN YEiNS-These may be divided into intra and extraspinal divisions; and further may be described as anterior and posterior. • + „ ^Tnxekiok ExTRASPiNO-RACHmiAN Veins consist of a rprvical dorsal, lumbar, and sacral division.

The lumbar veins are five in number, bein" each formed by a branch from the spinal canal; a second trom the lumbar mass of muscles, and a third from the psoas and quadratus lumborum; these open into a series oi loops which surround the transverse processes of the lumbar vertebrae, constituting the ascending lumbar vein that communicates above with the vena azyo-os major whilst from each loop a transverse branch is de- tached to terminate in the cava, those of the left side ruumng behind the abdominal aorta. In addition to tiiese the ilio-lumbar vein may also be classed with the lumbar set; commencing by branches correspondin<r to the division of the artery of that name, it opens into°the common ihac; but we have often seen it terminating in the internal iliac vein. The sacral set consist of the lateral and middle sacral veins, the former receiving branches from the sacral canal, levator ani, coccygeus and pyriformis, whilst a series of transverse branches unite them with the middle sacral, and they terminate m the internal iliac; whilst the middle, commenciuff by communicating branches from the lateral and heemor- rhoidal plexus, ascends to join the left common iliac vein. We have seen this vessel absent. Vena Azygos Major and MiNOR.—These trunks are common both to the lumbar and dorsal divisions. The tornier commences in the abdomen from the ascending lumbar vein, a branch also uniting it with the cava, and sometimes,a similar communication with the renal or su- prarenal exists; it then ascends through the aortic opening m the diaphragm on the right side of the thoracic duct and, passing upwards through the posterior mediasti- num. It receives on its right side the nine inferior in- tercostals, and on the left, in succession from below up- wards vena azygos minor, fourth and fifth intercostal and the left superior intercostal; and anteriorly, the bronchial and oesophageal; opposite the third dorsal ver- tebra It arches forwards, curving over the root of the 2 Q 2892 ARTERIES AKD VEINS. right lung, separated from the bronchus by the division of the vagus nerve, and opens into the posterior and ex- ternal side of the superior cava, about one inch above the auricle. This vein has but one valve, which is at its termination in the cava. We have seen it greatly di- lated in cirrhosis combined with contraction of the cava. Vena Azygos Minor.—Irregular as to size and exis- tence; it usually commences in the left lumbar region from the lumbar loop, sometimes communicating with the renal and suprarenal veins, and in one example we saw it receiving a small branch from the inferior mesen- teric, and in two, from the spermatic; then, ascending through a separate opening in the left crus of the dia- phragm, it passes upwards as high as the sixth dorsal vertebra, and, here crossing the spine, opens into the great azygos. • ^ n The PosTEBioR ExTRASPiNAL Veins consist oi a su- perficial set, which are subcutaneous, and a second, inter- muscular, which all communicate with the deep set; these latter appear as two longitudinal frequently in- flected trunks, lying on either side of the spmous pro- cesses of the vertebra, internally communicating by cross branches corresponding to the interspmous spaces, and these again sending ramusculi deeply between the ligamenta subflava to join the intraspinal vessels, and from the outer side of each trunk branches correspond- in^ in number to the vertebrae pass outwards and tor- wards, supported by the lamina of the spme towards transverse processes, dividing into ascendmg and descending branches to communicate with those above and below; they join the efferent veins of the spmal canal in th^ interval between the transverse processes Tntraspino-Rachidian Veins.-These are divisible into an anterior and posterior set, the former con si. ng of two longitudinal trunks lying on the posterior sur- te of the\odies of the vertebra, between the margm of the posterior vaginal ligament and the roots of the ^.rbrlPs extending from the foramen magnum to the Tasf of the coc^^^ -nd covered by the dura mater. These truls areLger in the dorsal and lumbar than in the cervical or sacral regions,-they are also alternately dilated and constricted from above downwards; inter-VENOUS SYSTEM. 893 nally they are united by a transverse branch, which, passing between the posterior vaginal ligament and the body of the bone, receives one large osseal and several smaller veins, having their origin in the cancellous tis- sue of the body, while from the external side of each longitudinal trunk an efferent venous branch corre- sponding to each vertebra passes outwards and back- wards to communicate with a similar one from the pos- terior trunks, which we will now describe. Posterior Intraspino-Eachidian Veins.—These also consist of two lateral posterior longitudinal trunks, similar in length to the anterior, and lying between the dura mater and the laminas of the spines, imbedded in a yellowish, soft, fatty tissue; they communicate with each other by transverse plexuses muchmore irregularly than the anterior; these plexuses receive branches from the posterior external Eachidian veins, and where they communicate with the longitudinal trunks producing vi- sible dilatations; externally, efferent branches come off, which, uniting with similar from the anterior, consti- tute single trunks opening in the cervical region into the vertebral, in the dorsal into the intercostal, in the lumbar into the lumbar, and in the sacral into the lateral sacral veins. Proper Veins of the Cord form a plexus on the pia mater, Avhich, opposite each nervous root, sends off an efferent branch, that runs outwards between the ante- rior and posterior roots, inclosed in the same sheath of dura mater, and opens into the common efferent vein in the intervertebral foramen. In addition to these, we have often seen on either side of the cord a large venous branch pursuing a spiral course, and opening opposite the tenth or eleventh dorsal vertebra into the efferent vein of the right side. The Spino-Eachidian Venous System presents many peculiarities which exercise a considerable influence on the general venous circulation by their frequent inoscu- lations, by the absence of valves, and the tenuity of their coats, being admirably adapted to fulfil the objects of compensating channels where vessels are obstructed. It communicates with the portal system through the me- dium of the middle sacral vein and the hemorrhoidal894 ABSORBENTS. plexus, and it is likewise brought into communication with the pulmonary through the vena azygos and bron- chial veins on the right side, and the superior intercostal and bronchial on the left. With the general venous system it forms endless communications, and it is not astonishing that, in occlusion of the superior or inferior cavae, it should undergo a remarkable dilatation. The representatives of this system in the skull are, the si- nuses, the superior and inferior longitudinal, straight, and occipital, corresponding to the posterior intraspinal veins, the cavernous, petrosal, and lateral to the ante- rior, whilst the circular, transverse sphenoidal, and ba- silar, correspond to the communicating branches. ABSORBENT VESSELS. Absorption is that function by which structural changes are accomplished of parts of the body itself ; the product being carried into the venous system; likewise, by which matters placed in contact either with natural or artificial surfaces are introduced into the system, and also by Avhich certain parts of organs or structures are removed, modelling the body into symmetry. Absorp- tion is a very general function in all classes of animals; and though Hunter and Monro maintamed the opinion that the lymphatics constituted the only absorbing channels, still it is now generally admitted that tlie veins participate in the action to no small degree, as Maeendie and Segalas satisfactorily proved by a series of well-contrived experiments. It will be sufficient here to state, that the absorbents have been divided into alands, lymphatic vessels, and lacteals. The glands are conglobate, oval in shape, of a yellowish-grey colour indefinite in number, size, and situation, depending tor their capsule on the condensation of the areolar tissue in the Vicinity, and they do not possess any proper ducts. Usually placed in the flexure of jomts they vary in size from that of a small pea to a ^^^ge hem whUe a number of colourless small tubes entc the glands (vasa alFerentia), these being """^/'•^^ff^^^ small, and emanating from them are a tubes, larger and less numerous than the tormei (vasa895 ABSORBENTS. efferentia), these small vessels being often confounded witli collapsed venous branches, from which they differ, however, in the following respects:—The lymphatic coats are thinner than those of veins, their valves more regular and numerous, and they do not unite to form larger trunks, as veins do, but run separately, though often in juxtaposition, towards the glands, while they do not communicate so freely. The struc- ture of the lymphatic glands is simple, consisting, first, of a capsule of a fibrous structure, which, sending sepi- menta into its interior, gives it a cellular appearance on being divided, and the lymphatics enter its substance and form convoluted tubes, which possibly may also send off lateral cellular diverticula, then emerging as the vasa efferentia, whilst within the gland the tubes lose the areolar tunic, nothing but a basement layer, supporting a stratum of very opaque epithelium, con- stituting their walls; it has likewise been maintained, that the glandular lymphatics communicated with the veins and small arteries (Fohman, Abernethy). The lymphatics commence on the surface and in the sub- stance of parts, but their exact origins have never been discovered; but the lacteals restricted to the intestines can be examined with greater success. They have been seen arising from the villi, but their arrangement in those parts is still undecided, it being described as plexiform (Rudolphi), looped (Goodsir), a closed, di- lated ampulla (Henle), and lastly, by open mouths, which is obviously incorrect. The structure of the lymphatics and lacteals may be inferred from that of the thoracic duct, which has an areolar tunic with irregular fibres, also a second, consisting of circular, elastic, and non-striped muscular fibre and a lining serous mem- brane, which is thrown into valves resembling those of the veins, but more numerous and regular, giving to the lymphatic vessels, when inflated, a knotted appear- ance, the epithelial lining consisting of spindle-shaped particles. The Absorbents are divided into superficial and deep sets, and the glands are subject to a similar division, but not in all organs, as their existence, although it may be inferred, has never been proved in the bones,ABSORBENTS. 896 cuticle, liair, nails, or brain, nor in the placenta and umbilical vein. Lymphatics of the Lower Extremities should be examined as glands and vessels; the former being the anterior tibial, poplitaeal, and inguinal. The first is a small gland lying on the upper third of the interosseous membrane, sometimes a little lower down (Hewson); Meckel states that he has seen two in this situation, but Cruikshank positively declares that he has never observed any glands in the lower extremity below the ham; however, we have more than once shown three or four glands in the course of the anterior tibial veins when dissecting anasarcous subjects of immature years. The popliteal glands are three or four in number, situ- ated thus:—One superficial, a second deeper, a third and fourth on each side of the artery, but in surrounding the vessel we have never seen them exactly opposite, but always on different levels as regarded each other. The inguinal set are from eight to twelve in number, and consist of superficial and deep; the former consti- tuting a superior and inferior set: the first, fewbutlarge, are parallel to Poupart's ligament, whilst the second correspond to the course of the internal and external saphenous veins. The deep lie in the angle between the pectineus and adductor longus on the inside, and the psoas and iliacus on the outside, whilst one occupies the femoral ring to preserve the continuity between the inguinal and external iliac glands. Pelvic Glands.—External iliac, internal iliac, sacral, and pelvic. , The External Iliac are five or six in number, ail ot them being very small, except two, which lie near Pou- part's ligament, one before and one external to the artery; and if the gland which occupies the femoral ring be considered as appertaining to this set, the third would lie internal to the vessel; these might possibly become the seat of enlargement, simulating ihac aneu- rism, but we have not seen them hypertrophied even in cases where such might have been expected. The Internal Iliac—These lie in the interval be- tween the external and internal aliac arteries, and are often very large in f trofulous children.ABSORBENTS. 897 The Sacral Glands lie on the posterior and lateral part of the rectum, supported by the sacrum between the layers of the meso-rectum; we have seen them form- ing a continuous layer around the gut in cancer recti. The pelvic are the vesical, which lie at the posterior part of the bladder, and in the female are likewise the vaginal and uterine. The Lumbar Lymphatic Glands are very numerous, the central set lying on the common iliac arteries, as ' well as between them; they also surround the aorta and vena cava, whilst the lateral are found in the inter- transverse spaces of the vertebrse. Lymphatic Vessels of the Lower Extremity. These are divided into deep and superficial, the former being, anterior tibial, posterior tibial, and peroneal. The anterior tibial lymphatics are two in number, one commencing on the outer side of the foot, the other on the dorsum; both unite and pass upwards beneath the anterior annular ligament in the same groove with the anterior tibial vessels, and, passing through the anterior tibial gland, it pierces the interosseous membrane to arrive at the poplitasal glands, while the posterior tibial set, receiving the peroneal, ascend in the course of the vessels to reach the same structures. The superficial lymphatics commence on the dorsum and sole of the foot by an intricate plexus; then ascend- ing, those in front over the superficial surface of the muscles of the leg, they cross obliquely the upper part of the tibia, to reach a point behind the internal con- dyle of the femur; then continuing in the direction of the sartorius, they open into the inferior superficial in- guinal glands; a few lymphatics also accompany the posterior saphenous vein, and terminate in the most superficial poplita2al gland. In the thigh the deep lym- phatics follow the course of the femoral vessels, passing through the deep glands in company with the super- ficial lymphatics, that become deep by entering the saphenic opening, where they reach the iliac glands. The superficial lymphatics of the penis and scrotum pass outwards, and open into the superior set of super- ficial inguinal glands; and those of the gluta3al region also curve forwards over the glutasus maximus, medius, 2 3898 ABSORBENTS. and tensor vaginae femoris, to open into the inguinal glands, whilst the abdominal descends to terminate at a similar point. The several lymphatics from the in- guinal region enter the pelvis through the crural ring, internal to. the femoral vein, and divide into a descend- ing fasciculus, which enters the internal iliac, and an ascending, which passes through the external iliac, the former receiving the deep glutseal, vesical, hemor- rhoidal, and deep lymphatics of the penis, also those of the uterus and vagina in the female, and plexuses are formed on the external and internal iliac vessels, which, passing through the lumbar glands, terminate in the recepfcaculum chyli. The lumbar lymphatics also re- ceive those from the testicle, which are divided into superficial and deep, the former lying beneath the tu- nica vaginalis testis, and the latter commencing m the gland, both, however, communicating; they then ascend in the cord, interlacing with the spermatic veins, and following the course of these latter vessels, they termi- nate in the lumbar glands, in common with those of the kidneys and suprarenal capsules, in both of wHch or- gans the lymphatics are superficial and deep. ^ Lymphatics of the Liver—The glands are situated in the lesser omentum, behind the pylorus, and are usually of a yellowish-black or brown colour. The lymphatic vessels of the organ are first superficial, form- ing arborescent plexuses 'beneath the peritoneal tunic of the liver on its convex and concave surfaces; the for- mer run forwards between the layers of the falciform ligament, passing through a space behind the ensiform cartilage, but the most numerous run backwards, pass- ing between the layers of the respective lateral and the coronary ligaments, some perforating the flat diaphragm posteriorly, to reach the thoracic duct in the thorax, whilst others pierce the crus, and join the same duct m the abdomen. The latter, or the lymphatics on the under surface of the liver, having formed a plexus round the rrall-bladder, some communicate with the glands ot the lesser curvature of the stomach, whilst others enter those of the lesser omentum. The deep-seated set emerge from the transverse fissure, passing through the glands of the lesser omentum, then through those surroundingABSORBENTS. 899 the aorta and vena cava, and ultimately reaching the thoracic duct. The lymphatic vessels of the spleen, pancreas, and stomach being similar to those of other organs, it will be only necessary to state that, passing through the neighbouring gland, they terminate in the thoracic duct. Intestinal Lacteals commence on the villi of the intestines (see Anatomy of Abdomen), and, passing through the mesenteric glands, they terminate in the receptaculum chyli; but, in addition to these, there are proper lymphatics for the hollow intestines, some of which pass through the lumbar, others through the mesenteric glands, to reach the commencement of the thoracic duct. Lymphatic Glands of the Thorax consist of those which lie in the walls and the intrathoracic set. The first or posterior intercostal are variable in number, lying at the posterior part of the intercostal space, while the second or anterior lie along the internal mammary vessels, one for each intercostal space; the intrathoracic are, the anterior mediastinal, lying in the inferior part of that space, and the posterior mediastinal, occupying that region in front of the oesophagus and aorta, also pulmonary, which are principally found in the vicinity of the roots of the lung, being of a dark colour, parti- cularly in the old, from the absorption of carbon. The Lymphatic Vessels are similarly arranged. The intercostal lymphatics accompany the vessels of that name, passing through their proper glands, and open into the thoracic duct. The internal mammary lym- phatics commence in the parietes of the abdomen, pass upwards behind the ensiform cartilage, and then behind the margin of the sternum and through the glands, in this situation opening on the right side into the lesser, and on the left into the greater thoracic duct. Lymphatics of the Lungs (see Anatomy of Lungs). Lymphatics of the Heart consist of a superficial and deep set, some of which open into the thoracic duct, whilst others join the pulmonary lymphatics. Lymphatic Glands of the Head and Face are found behind the ears and beneath the insertion of the sterno- mastoid, and, in addition to these, the pituitary bodyABSORBENTS. 900 and the glandulse Pacchioni have been looked on by some anatomists as deep lymphatics, without foundation, however. Those of the face lie on the ramus of the jaw and on the line of the facial vessels, and three or four are also present in the parotid, whilst a few lie be- neath the zygoma, and often a large one on the bucci- nator. Lymphatic Vessels of the Head—The temporal set pursue the course of the vessels, pass through the parotid chain of glands, and reach the neck, whilst the occipital set run downwards and backwards, entering the mastoid and occipital glands. The deep lymphatics of the skull are those of the dura mater, and they follow the middle meningeal artery, escaping by the spinous foramen of the sphenoid bone to terminate in the jugular lymphatics. Lymphatics of the Brain.—Such contradictory de- scriptions and delineations have been given by Ruysch, Mascagni, and Fohman, that we are safe in stating that the arrangement of the cerebral lymphatics (if any exist) is still unsettled. . Lymphatics of the Face are divided into superfacial and deep; the former commencing on all parts of the face, some running with thefrontal, others with the facial, arteries, and, passing through the zygomatic and buccal, and submaxillary glands, reach the neck; the latter or deep accompany the blood-vessels as temporal, maxil- lary, nasal, palatine, pharyngeal, &c., communicating with the deep parotid and cervical glands. Lymphatic Glands of the Neck.—The superficial run beneath the platysma, and on the external jugular vein in the posterior inferior triangle of the neck ; and two or three smaller lie between the os hyoides and thy- roid cartilage. The deep form a continuous ch am from the mastoid process to the upper aperture ot the thorax, Ivina- on the sheath of the cervical vessels; there are also fflands for the trachea, pharynx, and the oesophagus. Cervical Lymphatic Vessels are constituted by those which descend from the face, also by the tracheal, oesophaceal, and pharyngeal, and, having traversed the glands, ^they terminate on the right side in the right, and on the left in the great, thoracic duct.901 ABSORBKNTS. Lymphatic Glanbs of the Upper Extremity A few fusiform glands lie in the course of the radial and ulnar arteries, one or two beneath the basilic vein at the bend of the elbow, and a large one, sometimes double, above the internal condyle; several follow the brachial ves- sels, and in the axilla they are both numerous and large (see Anatomy of Axilla). One is always si- tuated beneath the costo-coraco-clavicular ligament, and we have seen a continuous chain of small glands on the anterior and external edge of the great pectoral muscle. Lymphatic Vessels of the Upper Extremity.—The superficial commence on the backs of the fingers, and ascend, becoming anterior and posterior on the fore-arm, and divided into groups internal and external, the for- mer ascending behind and before the internal condyle, and, uniting, pass through the succession of glands in the course of the brachial vessels to reach the axillary glands; the latter or external passing before and be- hind the external condyle, and, uniting, cross the arm obliquely to reach the axillary glands similar to the in- ternal; one of the external is large, and follows the course of the cephalic vein, and enters the subclavicular gland, while the deep follow the course of the vessels to the axilla, and having passed through these glands, they terminate in their respective thoracic ducts. Great Thoracic Duct commences in the abdomen in the receptaculum chyli (Pecquet), wdiich latter receives below the lymphatics of the lower half of the body, in front the lacteals, while from its superior part the duct emanates; it is about tw^o lines wide, and one inch and a quarter long, lying behind the aorta, and on the ver- tebrte and anterior vaginal ligament; from this the tho- racic duct ascends between the vena azygos and the aorta, enters the thorax through the aortic opening, running in the posterior mediastinum, still related to the above-named vessels, but opposite the third or fourth dorsal vc'rtebra, it passes behind the oesophagus and aorta, and, bending upwards and to the left side, it lies behind the origin of the left subclavian artery, and still ascending between the carotid and subclavian, it lies behind the left vena innominata and on the left edge of the oesophagus and vertebral artery, and then curvingABSORBENTS. 902 downwards and outwards, opposite the transverse pro- cess of the sixth cervical vertebra, behind the carotid, jugular vein, pneumogastric nerve, and in front of the inferior thyroid and subclavian arteries, it terminates in the left subclavian vein just at its junction with the ju- gular. The thoracic duct is about the size of a goose- quill when distended, and is often double for some dis- tance, and then again single; nor is it of a uniform size, being large in the lumbar region, small in the dorsal, and large again in the cervical, while its valves are not as numerous as in other parts of the lymphatic system. It receives all the absorbents of the body ex- cept those of the right side of the head, neck, thorax, and upper extremity which unite to form a trunk of about one inch in length, which terminates in the right sub- clavian vein at its junction with the jugular.INDEX.

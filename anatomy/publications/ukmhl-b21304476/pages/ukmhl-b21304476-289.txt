( 263 ) its 10. The Tuiceps Extensor Cubiti is the great muscle which cover* all the back-part of the armâ€”It arises by three heads. The first, or long head, arises, by a broad tendon, from the inferior costa of the scapula near its cervix, and forms a large belly, which covers the back-part of the os humeri. The second, or short head, arises, on the outer and back-part of the os humeri, by an acute tendinous and fleshy beginning, from a ridge which runs from the back-part of the great tuberosity towards the outer condyle. The fibres begin to arise a little be- low the tuberosity, and are continued down to the condyle. They also arise from the surface of bone behind the ridge, and from the intermuscular liga- ment which separates them from the muscles on the fore-part of the arm. The third head, called Bra- chialis Externus, arises, by an acute beginning, from the inside of the os humeri above its middle, and from a ridge extending to the inner condyle. It also arises from the surface behind this ridge, and from the internal intermuscular ligament. The three heads unite above the middle of the os humeri, and invest the whole back-part of the bone. They form a thick strong tendon, which is Inserted into the rough back-part of the process of the ulna, called Olecranon, and partly into the con- dyles of the os humeri, adhering firmly to the cap- sular ligament. Situation: The long head, where it arises from the scapula, is concealed by the deltoid; it arises betwixt the teres minor and teres major, and passes betwixt those muscles to the arm; and, in the remainder of

( 211 ) V EJ VS* The veins of the face are numerous, and pass into the external and internal jugular veins. NERVES. 1. The Portio Dura of the seventh pair,Ner- vus Communieans Fdciei, or Facial nerve, after its course through the temporal bone in the aqueduct of Fallopius, comes out by the foramen stylo-mastoi- deum. It immediately gives oft- brahches to the neighbouring parts, as behind the ear. It then passes through the substance of the parotid gland, and emerges on the face in three great branches, which have frequent mutual communications : this division op the nerve is called Pes Anserin us. f (1. The ascending branch ramifies on the temple and forehead. (â€˜2.) The middle branch sends its ramifications over the sid of the face, the proper Facial Nerves. (3.) The descending branch sends its twigs along the chin, down upon the neck, and backwards upon the occiput. 2. Hie Superior Cervical Nerves send off several branches, which ramify on the side of the face and head, and communicate freely with the branches of the portio dura. As, in the course of this dissection, we meet with many twigs of the second and third branches of the fifth pair of nerves, it will be advisable here to de- scribe these nerves. 3. Nervus. %

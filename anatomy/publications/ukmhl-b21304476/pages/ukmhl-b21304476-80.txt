You must not expect to meet with uniformity in the distribution of these vessels in all subjects, some- times the gluteal and pudic arteries come off by one trunk, sometimes the pudic and sciatic, &c. &c. 2. VEINS. The veins attend the arteries and their ramifica- tions; they unite to form the internal iliac vein, ex- cept the veins from the rectum, named Hceniorrhoi- dales, which ascend along its back part to join the inferior mesenteric vein. S. NERVES. The nerves met with in this dissection consist of numerous twigs sent off from the lumbar and sacral nerves to supply the parts about the pelvis. But, in this dissection, we meet with three pair of large nerves, which have their course through the pelvis, and pass to the thigh. 1. Course of the Anterior Crural Nerve while in the pelvis. The anterior crural nerve is formed by branches of the first, second, third, and fourth lumbar nerves ; at its origin, it lies under the psoas magnus, and, as it descends, passes betwixt, the psoas magnus and iliacus interims, till, having passed under l’oupart’s ligament, it emerges from betwixt those muscles, and appears on the outer side of the inguinal artery. ■ 2.

( 294. ) is distributed over the anterior part of the outer con* dyle, where it anastomoses with branches of the bra- chial artery. (2.) Small arteries to the muscles of the fore-arm, and to the radius. (3.) A branch leaves the artery immediately after it has turned over the edge of the radius, and, rami- fying on the back of the hand, is named Dorsalis Carpi. (4.) Small vessels are sent off to the back-part of the thumb, named A. Dorsales Pollicis. Having reached the palm of the hand, the radial artery divides into two branches. (1.) A. Pollicis, which sends two or three arteries along the anterior part of the thumb, and also often gives off a twig, the A. Radialis Indicis, which passes along the outer edge of the fore-finger, and inoscu- lates with a branch of the ulnar artery. (2.) The trunk of the radial artery forms the Deep-seated Palmar Arch. From the root of the thumb, it passes across the metacarpal bones near their bases, and terminates at the metacarpal bone of the little finger, inosculating with a branch of the ul- nar artery. This arch lies deep, close to the bones. It supplies the interosseous muscles and deep-seated parts of the palm, and some of its branches pass betwixt the metacarpal bones to the back of the hand. 2. Arteria Ulnaris, or Cubitalis. The ulnar artery is the largest branch of the brachial, and gene- rally gives off the interosseous artery. It takes its course deep among the muscles on the inside of the fore-arm. It is seen passing under the pronator teres, flexor

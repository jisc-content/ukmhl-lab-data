( 1» ) the outside of the corpora striata, between the ante- rior and middle lobe of the brain; run under the anterior lobes, being lodged in two superficial grooves, and lying between the pia and dura mater; expand into a small oval ganglion, from which several small filaments descend through the cribriform plate of the ethmoid bone, to ramify on the membrane lining the nose. 2. The Second Pair, the Optic, arise from the posterior part of the optic thalami, and also from the tubercula quadrigemina; they make a circle round the crura cerebri called the Tractus Opticus. The two nerves approach gradually, and unite, just before the pituitary gland, on the fore-part of the sella]Tur- cica. They then diverge, and each nerve passes out at the foramen opticum of the sphenoid bone, to form the retina of the eye. On each side of these nerves are seen the Carotid Arteries. Each artery emerges from the cavernous sinus by the side of the anterior clinoid process: •sends a branch forwards, which, uniting with a simi- lar branch of the other carotid, forms the anterior part of the Cjrculus Arteriosus Willisii; while other branches, passing backwards, and uni- ting with branches of the basilar artery, complete the posterior part of the arterial circle. A fold of dura mater passes from the anterior to the posterior clinoid process of each side. This fold is double, and forms by its duplicature the Caver- nous sinus,. On dividing the optic nerves, and inverting them, we see the infundibulum, a funnel of cineritious sub- stance,.

( 139 ) w ill be found situated between the two lobes on the undersurface of the cerebellum, and immediately be- hind the medulla oblongata. On {separating the two lobes behind, and making a deep incision, we discover, The Fourth Ventricle.—The sides of this ventricle are formed by the cerebellum, the anterior part by the medulla oblongata, the upper and back part by the valvula cerebri; it is lined by a thin vascular membrane, and has on its fore-part a groove or fis- sure, which, terminating in a sharp point, is named Calamus Scriptorius. On each side of this groove are seen several medullary lines, which are the origin of the portio mollis of the seventh pair of nerves. The iter a tertio ad quartiun ventriculum enters the upper part of the fourth venti icie. The valvula cerebri hangs over it. On cutting the cerebellum perpendicularly, there is formed, from the intermixture of cineritious and medullary matter, a tree-like appearance, named Arbor Vitjs, of which the trunk is termed the peduncle of the cerebellum, and is continued to the back-part of the medulla oblongata. This concludes the demonstration of the cerebellum. To demonstrate the medulla oblongata and nerves, either the brain must be removed from the cranium, or it may be gradully inverted in the progress of the demonstration ;—and this is the better method. The inversion must be begun at the fore-part by raising the anterior lobes ot the cerebrum. Tiius you will see, 1. The First Pair of Nerves, TheOLFACTORY, called also Processus Mammillares. They arise from the

( >31 ) the middle of the os parietale; it is termed Fissuha Cerebri, or fissura Magna Silvii. By gently separating with the fingers the two he- mispheres of the brain *, we see passing betwixt them a longitudinal white convex body, the Corpus Cal- losum : it lies under the falx, incurvates downwards at both its extremities, and is continued anteriorly into the medullary substance betwixt the corpora striata, posteriorly into the fornix and inferior cornu of the lateral ventricle on each side. On the surface of the corpus callosum is seen the Raphe, formed by two longitudinal medullary lines united by trans- verse fibres. When the brain is cut horizontally on the level of the corpus callosum, an appearance is produced, termed The Medullary arch, or Centrum Ovale. Under this arch are the two lateral ventricles f. If one of these be cautiously perforated on the side of ihe corpus callosum, and gently inflated by a blow- pipe, its extent may be seen ; but, if much force be used, the air will pass into the other ventricle. The two ventricles are separated by a medullary partition, which' descends from the inferior surface of the corpus callosum to the fornix, the Septum, Ludicum ; it consists of two lamina-, with a narrow * Between the hemispheres and on the surface of the corpus callosum, we observe the arteriie collosa;, which are the conti- nuation of the trunks of the anterior cerebri. + To show the lateral ventricles, the corpus callosum should â–  be cut away close to the septum lucidum, and then the ventricle of that body, and the thickness and breadth of the septum itseif, will be more clearly seen. f e cavity

The cutaneous nerves of the arm are seen ramify- ing above the muscles; they consist of, 1. The Internal Cutaneous Nerve, a branch of the axillary plexus. It is seen accompanying the basilic vein, and twisting its fibres over it. It de- scends along the inside of the arm, crosses over the fore-part of the elbow-joint, and, in the dissection of the fore-arm, will be seen dividing itself into twigs, which ramify between the fascia and integu- ments, and are distributed to the inside of the fore- arm and wrist. 2. The upper part of the arm receives cutaneous, nerves from the branches of the dorsal nerves, which come out of the thorax between the ribs. 3. The shoulder and backrpart of the scapula re- ceive twigs from the cervical nerves. 4*. The external cutaneous, ulnar, and spiral nerves, also send twigs to the integuments of the arm and lore-arm. f-MUSCLES SITUATED ON THE SHOULDER. AND ARM. These are ten in number. 1.

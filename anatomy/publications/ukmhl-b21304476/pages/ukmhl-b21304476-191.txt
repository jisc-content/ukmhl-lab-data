Its branches accompany the ramifications of the external carotid. At first the vein which accompa- nies each artery is a single branch, but it soon sub- divides, so that two veins accompany one artery. NEllVES. 1. The Eighth Pair, or Par Vagum —On se- parating the internal jugular vein, and trunk ol the carotid artery, the par vagum is seen lying in the same sheath of cellular substance with those vessels. It lies in the triangular space formed betwixt the back-part of the artery and vein, and the subjacent muscles. This nerve comes out of the foramen lace- rum with the jugular vein; hence it adheres to that vein more closely than to the artery or muscles; it runs down the neck behind these vessels. In this course it gives off several nerves. (1.) At the base of the cranium, it sends off seve- ral filaments, which are connected with die other nerves coming out of the base of the skull, such as the ninth pair, the superior cervical ganglion ol the intercostal, Sec.

( 7 ) Annulus A 4 vjuus descendens ;—obliquus major:—ilio pubi-cos- to-abdominal. In the coarse of the dissection of this single mus- cle, the following points must be attended to. The Linea Alba, a white line running along the middle of the abdomen, from the cartilago ensiformis to the os pubis; formed by the tendinous fibres of the two„obliqui and the transversals muscles, interlaced with those of the same muscles on the opposite side; it is half an inch broad at the navel; and decreases gradually both above and below that part; but par- ticularly in the latter situation, where it is reduced at last to a mere line. Linea Semilunaris, a semicircular white line, Running from the os pubis obliquely upwards over the side of the abdomen, at the distance of about four inches from the linea alba; formed by the tendons of the two oblique and transverse muscles uniting at the edge of the rectus, before the}r separate to form the sheatli for that muscle. Lineas TkansveksjE, three or four white lines, crossing from the linea semilunaris to the linea alba; formed by the tendinous intersections of the recti shining through the strong sheath which covers them:—These are not evident in all subjects in this stage of the dissection. Umbilicus, or Navel. This which, before the integuments were removed, was a depression, ap- pears now a prominence; it consists of condensed cellular membrane:—In the foetus, it was a foramen which gave passage to the two umbilical arteries, the umbilical vein, and the urachus.

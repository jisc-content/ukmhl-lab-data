( 253 ) vein on the outside of the little finger, named Salva- tella. Jt then runs along the inside of the fore-aim near the ulna, receiving the internal and external ulnar veins from the anterior and posterior surface of the fascia. It passes over the fold of the arm near the inner condyle of the humerus ; here it is superficial. It ascends along the arm, becoming more deeplyseated, and included in the sheath which, invests the brachial artery. As it approaches the neck of the humerus, it sinks deep betwixt the folds of the arm-pit, and terminates in the axillary vein, which majr be considered as a continuation of the basilic vein. It communicates with the deeper- seated veins, and receives numerous branches from the muscles. ‘2. The Cephalic Vein begins on the back of the hand, between the thumb and metacarpal bone • of the fore-finger, by a small vein, named Cephalica Pollicis. It runs along the radius between the mus- cles and integuments, receiving the internal and ex- ternal radial veins. It passes over the bend of the arm near the external condyle, and ascends along the outside of the arm near the outer edge of the biceps flexor cubiti. It then runs betwixt the edge of the deltoid and pectoral muscles, dips down under the clavicle, and enters the subclavian vein. In all this course the cephalic vein receives branches. 3. The Median Vein. Several veins are seen running along the middle of the anterior part of the fore-arm. The trunk formed by these veins is called the Mediana Major. It ascends on the flat part of the fore-arm, betwixt the basilic and cephalic veins, and a

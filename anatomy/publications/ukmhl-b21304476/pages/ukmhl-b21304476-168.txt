( 142 ) 7. The 5. The Fifth Pair, Tuigf.mini, are much larger than the fourth, and are situated more out- wards and backwards. Each of these nerves arises by a number of filaments, from the anterior and lowest part of the crus cerebelli, where the crus unites with the pons Varoliiit passes forwards, enters the cavernous sinus, where it untwists itself; and forms a fiat irregular ganglion, the Ganglion (tASSERIAnum, and then divides into three great branches. (1.) Ramus Ocularis—The ophthalmic nerve of Willis passes through the foramen lacerum orbi- tale superius to the appendages of the eye. (2.) Ramus Mantle a r is Superior passes through the foramen rotundum to the upper jaw and face. (3.) Ramus Maxii.laris Inferior passes through the foramen ovale to the lower jaw and tongue. 6. The Sixth Pair, Motores Oculorum Ex- turn i, or adductores.—This nerve is small, but not so small as the fourth pair; it is seen arising^ betwixt the pons Varolii and corpora pyratnidalia: it enters the cavernous sinus,—it there runs by the side of the carotid antery, and passes through the foramen lacerum orbitale superius to the rectus ex- ternus oculi. While in the cavernous sinus, it gives off the small twig, which, uniting with filaments from the second branch of the fifth pair, forms the beginning of the intercostal nerve, and passes out of the cra- nium through the foramen caroticum with the caro- tid artery.

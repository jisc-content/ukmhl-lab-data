Situation i sends off aponeurosis, which is continued down to i the leg, and covers the inner part of the capsule of i the knee. Situation : This muscle embraces the inside of the femur in the same manner as the last described muscle does the outside, but it is much smaller;—it is also in part covered by the rectus. At its upper part the sartorius passes over it obliquely ; it laps over the cruraeus, and is separated from it with greater diffi- culty than the vastus externus is. Where it arises from the root of the trochanter, it lies anterior to the common tendon of ihe iliacus interims and psoas mag- nus ; and where it arises from the linea aspera and \ oblique line, it is situated .anterior to, and in contact with the insertions of the pectineus and triceps ad- ductor femoris. Like the vastus externus, its outer surface is tendinous above, while below its inner sur- face is tendinous, and the fleshy fibres pass obliquely from the one tendinous expansion to the other. Use: Same as the last. 6. The Ckur/Uus, or Cruralis—Arises, fleshy, from between the two trochanters of the os femoris, from all the fort-part of the bone, and from the out- side as far back .as the linea aspera; but from the inside of the bone it does not arise, for between the fore-part of the femur and the inner edge of the linea aspera, there is a smooth plain surface, of the breadth of an inch, extending nearly the whole length of the bone, from which no muscular fibres arise. Inserted into the posterior surface of the tendon of the rectus, and upper edge of the patella.

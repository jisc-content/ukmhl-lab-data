( 65 ) contained in the upper part of the doubling of the broad ligament; it goes out from the fundus of the womb, and is a slender hollow tube: its outer end is curved downwards and backwards, and terminates by a broad fringed extremity, termed Morsus Di- aboli, or the Fimbriae.—This broad extremity is connected to the next pair of organs. The Ova hi a are two small oval bodies, white and flat, situated by the sides of the uterus,yind inelosed in the posterior fold of the broad ligament behind the Fallopian tube; each ovarium is connected to the fundus uteri by a short round ligament. The Bladder is situated before the uterus, and is described in the preceding chapter. The Urethra is short in females, ani near the bladder is surrounded by a spongy fleshy sub- stance,—is connected to the cartilaginous arch of the pubis by theligamcntum inferius vesicas. The Ureter descends from the kidneys over the psoas muscle; it runs for some space betwixt the bladder and vagina, and at last perforates the bladder near the neck. The Rectum lies behind the uterus.—See the preceding chapter. To obtain a more satisfactory knowledge of the relative situation of the parts, the left side of the pelvis should be removed as in the male, and the parts examined in that situation. CHAP.

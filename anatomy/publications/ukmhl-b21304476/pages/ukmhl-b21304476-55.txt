( 29 ) muscles. From these origins the fibres run, in dif- ferent directions, like radii from the circumference to the centre of a circle, and are Inserted into a broad tendon, (tendinous centre, or cordiform tendon,) which is situated in the middle of the diaphragm, and in which, therefore, the fibres from the opposite sides are interlaced. 2. The inferior or lesser muscle, or appendix of the diaphragm, lies on the bodies of the vertebra;,, and Arises, by four small tendinous feet, on each side, from the second, third, and fourth lumbar vertebrae; these tendons soon join, to form a strong pillar on each side, named the Crus of the Diaphragm. The crura run obliquely upwards and forwards, form two fleshy bellies, a fasciculus of each of which crossing over to the other, decussates with the opposite one, and thus forms the interval of the two crura into a superior and inferior opening. Inserted into the posterior part of the middle cor* diform tendon. Situation : The diaphragm is covered on its supe- rior surface by the pleura, and on its inferior by the peritoneum ; it separates the thoracic from the abdo- minal viscera: It is perforated in its fleshy and ten- dinous parts by several blood-vessels, and other im- portant organs. (1.) The aorta passes between the tendinous part of the crura, lying close upon the spine ; and the thoracic duct passes betwixt the aorta and the right crus. (2.)

( 129 ) the foramen magnum, dividing the cerebellum into two-parts. 4. The sphenoidal folds, two small folds of the dura mater, one on each side of the sella turcica, stretching from the posterior to the anterior clinoid processes. The dura mater also, in many parts of the brain, separates its laminae to form sinuses ; the principal of these will be noticed in the course of the dissection.. This membrane should now be divided in the line of the division of the cranium; its internal surface is smooth, glistening, and free from adhesion, except in the course of the longitudinal sinus; into which veins pass from the pia mater. Detach the falx from the crista galli, and turn it backwards, observe in its lower edge the Inte- rior Longitudinal Sinus, which enters a sinus in the tentorium, termed Torcular Herophili, or. straight sinuSk This will fully expose the convolu- tions of the brain, which are closely invested by the pia mater. The Pia-.Ma-ter consists of two membranesâ€” 1. The Tunica Arachnoides is a fine mem- brane,. covering uniformly the surface of the pia mater,, without passing into the interstices of- its duplicatures. It is attached to -it, is extremely thin, transparent, without vessels, demonstrated with diffi-. eulty on the upper surface of the brain .by the blow- pipe, (which raises it into cells,) but on the base of the brain it can be distinctly seen. 2. The proper Pia Mater, or. tunica vasculosa, is a very vascular membrane, transparent in the inter- s' 5 slices-

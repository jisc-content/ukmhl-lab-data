( 7* ) oT ihc vastus internus, and anterior to the insertion \ of the adductor magnus. Synonyma: Adductor primus;—Tricepsprimus;.— long licad of the triceps ;—Spino-pubio-femoral. (2.) The Adductor Brevis—Arises, fleshy and tendinous, from the os pubis, between the lower part of the symphysis pubis, and the foramen thyroidcum : -—it forms a fleshy belly. Inserted, tendinous, into the upper third of the lincaaspera. Situation.: Its origin lies under the origins of the pectinalis and adductor longus, and on the outside of the tendon of the gracilis:—Its belly descendsbehind the belly of the .pectinalis, and behind the superior fibres of the adductor longus ; and its largest part is therefore concealed, but a small part appears between the lower edge of the pectinalis, and upper edge of the adductor longus :—It is inserted behind those muscles, but before the adductor magnus. Synonyma: Triceps secundus;—Adductor secun- dus;—Sho; t head of the triceps ;—Sous-pubio- femoral. (3.) The Adductor Magnus—Arises, princi- pally fleshy, from the.lower part of the body, and from the descending ramus of the os pubis, and from the ascending ramus of tire ischium, as far as the tuberosity of that bone. The fibres run outwards and downwards, having various degrees of obliquity. Inserted, fleshy, into.the whole length of the linea aspera, into the oblique ridge above the internal condyle of the os femoris, and, by a roundish long tendon, into the upper part of that condyle.

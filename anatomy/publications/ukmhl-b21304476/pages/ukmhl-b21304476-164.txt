( 138 ) The Tentorium, and the Falx Cf.uebelli. At this point you should trace the bifurcation of the longitudinal sinus into two lateral sinuses. The * lateral sinuses are formed by the splitting of the laminje of the tentorium; hence they follow the course ol that membrane, run along their grooves in the occipital bone, and dip downwards and forwards through the foramen lacerum in basi cranii, to ter- minate in the internal jugular veins. The Torcular JIkhoriiili, or fourth sinus, runs along the middle of the tentorium, and joins the extremity of the longitudinal sinus at the point where it bifurcates. The great notch of the tentorium is a circular opening left on the anterior part of the tentorium, allowing a junction between the cerebrum and cere- bellum. Now proceed to the examination of the cerebellum; and, in order to accomplish this demonstration, it will be convenient to remove the posterior part of the os occipitis. Cerebellum.â€”This part of the brain, divided into two lobes by the falx cerebelli, or septein occi- pitale, is covered by a vascular membrane; consists of medullary and cineritious substance ; but, instead of convolutions, has numerous deep sulci, into which the pia mater dips, and forms thin flat strata. , Remark the following processes. 1. Appendix, vel processus vermiformis superior, situated under the pia mater, on the anterior and su- perior part of the cerebellum. 2. Appendix, or processus vermiforruis posterior, will

( 26 ) stances distinguish the large from the small intestine; which the difference of 6ize does not always. When the large intestine is empty, it contracts, and may be even smaller than the small; but if it were inflated, it could be distended to a much greater degree. The colon then goes backwards under the stomach and spleen into the left hypochondrium; and then, de- scending over the left kidney, it is again tied down ; it afterwards turns over the brim of the pelvis, being at this part unconfined, and forming a loose and re- markable curvature, which is named the Sigmoid or Iliac Flexure. After this convolution, the intestine assumes the name of The Rectum.—Drawing aside the intestines, you find the gut continued over the anterior surface of the sacrum and os coccygis to the anus. On pulling the stomach towards the right side, you will perceive, 6. The Lien, or Spleen.—Situation: In the left hypochondriac region, between the great extremity of the stomach, and the neighbouring false ribs, un- der the edge of the diaphragm, and above the left kidney ; to all of which it is connected by the perito- neum. It is of an oval figure ; its external surface is gently convex; its internal surface irregularly concave, and divided by a longitudinal fissure, into which its vessels enter. 7. The Pancreas.—Situation: This gland was in part seen on removing the little epiploon ; it is more fully exposed, by tearing through the great epiploon between the great curvature of the stomach, and the transverse arch of the colon. It lies in the cavity into

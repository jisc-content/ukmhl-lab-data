( 91 ) SECT. III. DISSECTION OF TIIF. HAM AND FASCIA ON THE BACK PART OF THE THIGH. ON removing the integuments from the back-part of the knee-joint and leg, we observe a Fascia, which covers the great vessels and the muscles. It is evidently continued from the great fascia of the thigh, is strengthened by adhesions to the condyles of the femur, and to the head of the fibula, and is prolonged upon the muscles on the back of the leg. Upon dissecting back that part of the fascia which covers the ham, the Great SciaticNerve appears, lying between the outer and inner hamstring-muscle6. This nerve, having given off branches about the ham, and to the integuments on the back of the leg, di- vides at some distance above the condyles of the femur into two large branches. 1. The Greater Nerve continues its course betwixt the heads of the gastrochemii muscles. In the ham it is named the Popliteal Nerve, and where it descends in the leg, the Posterior Tibiae. ^ 2. The lesser Nerve, which is the external b'ranch, J f is named the Peroneal or Fibular Nerve; it passes outwards and obliquely downwards, runs be- tween the external head of the gostrocnemius, and the tendon of the biceps flexor cruris; and sinks among the muscles which surround the head of the fibula.

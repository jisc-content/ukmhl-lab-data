( >67 ) ^becomes smaller, and descends ; and opposite the fifth or sixth cervical vertebra, it forms another swel- ling, the Inferior Cervical Ganglion. .‘Sometimes it has another ganglion aboat the fourth y\3r fifth vertebra of the neck, the Middle Cervical (Ganglion : but this is not a constant appearance. The nerve then passes behind the subclavian artery 'into the thorax. The branches of the intercostal nerve are nume* irous, and they generally pass off from the ganglions, llmmediately below the base of the cranium, twigs sgo to the eighth and ninth pairs, and to the upper (cervical nerves. In the middle of the neck, some (twigs pass over the carotid ; others go to the parts (covering the trachea, and uniting with filaments of (the par vagum, form the external laryngeal nerves; (others unite with the descendens noni, or descend- iing branch of the ninth pair, and some filaments as- ssist the twigs of the par vagum to form the superior (cardiac nerve. In the lower part of the neck, twigs are sent to communicate with the cervical nerves, &c. 3. The Ninth Pair, Nervus Hypo-glossus, or ILingual nerve, having left the skull by the anterior (condyloid foramen, is connected with the eighth pair and intercostal nerve. Like them, it lies deep, and (comes out from under the angle of the jaw. It is seen passing from behind the internal jugular vein, «nd then over the carotid artery, running betwixt (these two vessels. It next passes under the mylo- (hyoideus, running over the stylo-glossus, hyo-glos- ssus, and genio-hyo-glossus, which last muscle its (numerous branches perforate. Branches.

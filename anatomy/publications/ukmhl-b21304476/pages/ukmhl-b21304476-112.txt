( SS ) discover, running in the same direction, the strong tendon of, 8. The Obturator Externus.—This muscle arises, fleshy, from almost the whole circumference of the foramen thyroideum; and from the external surface of the obturator ligament; its fibres pass out- wards through the notch placed between the in- ferior margin of the acetabulum and the tuberosity of the ischium, wind around the cervix of the os fe- moris, adhering to the capsular ligament, and ter- minate in a strong tendon, which is Inserted into the lowermost part of the cavity, air the root of the trochanter major, immediately below thednsertion of the inferior head of the gemini. Situation : This muscle cannot be distinctly seen, until aW the muscles which run from the pelvis to the upper part of the thigh are removed, both on the fore and back part; its origin lies on the fore-part, and is concealed by the muscles situated there, as the pectinaeus, triceps, &c. and on the back-part the tendon is concealed by the quadratus femoris, and, when that muscle is removed, it is found to run along the lower edge of the inferior head of the gemini. Use: To roll the thigh-bone obliquely outwards. Sjnonyma: Extra-pelvio-pubi-trochanterien. 9. The Biceps Flexor Cruris—Arises,.by two distinct heads; the first, called the Long IIeau, arises in common with the semitendinosus, by a short tendon, from the outer part of the tuberosity of the ischium, and, descending, forms a thick fleshy belly. —The second, termed the Short Head, arises, ten- dinous and fleshy, from the linea aspera, immediately >. below \

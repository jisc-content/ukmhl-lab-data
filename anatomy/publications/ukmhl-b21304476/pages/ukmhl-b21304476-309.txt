Where it arises from the wrist, it is narrow, and does not cover the bases of the metacarpal bones of the little and fore finger.—• As it runs over the hand, it becomes broader, and is fixed by a bifurcated extremity in the lower end of each of the metacarpal bones of the four fingers.— The palmar fascia is strong and thick, conceals and supports the muscles of the hand, and may be dis- tinguished into four portions, which are connected by transverse fibres, while othe* fibres pass from them downwards, adheres strongly to the edges of the,metacarpal bones, and separate the tendons of each finger. There is a small thin cutaneous muscle situated between the wrist and the little finger. The Palmaris Brevis—Arises from the annu- lar ligament of the wrist, and from the inner edge of the fascia palmaris.

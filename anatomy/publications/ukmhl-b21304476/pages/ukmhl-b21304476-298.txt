( 272 ) bone as lowas two inches above its inferioir extremity, and from the outer part of the interrosseous ligament. It has also generally a tendinous origin from the in- ternal condyle of the os humeri. This origin forms a distinct fleshy slip, which is joined to the inner and uppei part of the portion of the muscle arising from the radius. The fibres pass obliquely into a tendon on the anterior surface of the muscle. The tendon passes under the annular ligament of the wrist, runs between the two heads of the short flexor of the thumb, and between the two sesamoid bones, and is Inserted into the base of the extreme phalanx of the thumb. Situation : This muscle lies by the side of the flexor profundus; the portion which arises from the inner condyle passes over the belly of the flexor profundus, and under the flexor sublimis. The whole muscle is concealed by the flexor sublimis ; its tendon will be seen in dissecting the short mus- cles of the thumb. Use: To bend the last joint of the thumb. Sijnonijmu : Flexor tertii internodii;—Radio-pha- langettien du ponce. On separating the lower part of the two last de- scribed muscles, we expose a small square muscle, passing transversely just above the wrist. 8.

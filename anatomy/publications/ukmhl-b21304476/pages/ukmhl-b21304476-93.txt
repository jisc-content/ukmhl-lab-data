( 67 ) §2. MUSCLES SITUATED ON THE FORE TATIF AND INSIDE OF THE THIGH. These are nine in number. 1. The Tensor Vaginae Femoris—Arises, by a narrow, tendinous, and fleshy origin, from the exter- nal part of the anterior superior spinous process of the os ileum : it forms a considerable fleshy belly. Inserted into the inner side of the great fascia, where it covers the outside of the thigh, and a little below the trochanter major. Situation : Its origin lies between the origin of the sartorius, and the anterior fibres of the gluteus me- dius, betwixt which muscle it descends ; it does not lie external to the fascia of the thigh, but is inclosed in a duplicature of it; its insertion lies anterior to that part of this membrane ■which arises from the tendon of the gluteus maximus. Use : To stretch the great fascia of the thigh, to assist in the abduction of the thigh, and in its rota- tion inwards. Synonymu : Musculus fasciae latac ;—Fascialis;— Membranous;—Ilio-aponeuri-femoral. 2. The Sartorius—Arises, by short tendinous fibres, from the anterior superior spinous process of the os ileum, soon becomes fleshy, extends obliquely across the thigh, and passes behind the inner condyle. Inserted, by a broad and thin tendon, into the inner side of the tibia, immediately below its ante- rior tubercle. Situation. Its origin lies between that ofthc tensor vagiiue

( Â« ) I BRANCHES OF THE PERONEAL NERVE. (].) Cutaneous branches are sent off from the pe- roneal nerve at its uppermost part over the gastrocne- mius to the integuments in the back-part of the leg, and outer side of the foot. Branches also are dis- tributed about the joint. (2.) A large branch, the Anterior Tibiae Nerve, passes under the flesh of the peroneus lon- gus and extensor longus digitorum, where those muscles arise from the heads of the fibula and tibia; and comes in contact with the anterior tibial arterv, which it accompanies down the leg. (3.) Another branch passes into the upper extre- mity of the peroneus longus, and is continued in the substance of that muscle for some space. It,then emerges from beneath it, and continues its course under the muscles on the fore-part and outside of the leg ; it pierces this fascia, and, becoming cutaneous, is lost on the ankle and upper surface of the foot. Belo w the great sciatic nerve, there is much cellu- lar membrane and fat, which being removed, the Great Popliteal Vein is exposed. It adheres to the Popliteal Artery, which lies under it close upon the bone. Arteria Poflitea is the trunkof the Femoral, which assumes that name, after it has perforated the tendon of the triceps. It lies between the condyles of the femur, dose upon the bone, and descends between the heads of the gastrocnemius. It runs over the po- pliteus, and under the gastrocnemius, that is, in the erect

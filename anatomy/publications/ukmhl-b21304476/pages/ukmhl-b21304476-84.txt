( S8 ) the soft parts which extends from the inferior commis- sure of the labia to the anus. The Perineum Posterius is the space betwixt the anus and point of the os coccygis. The Nymph.® are two prominent doublings of the integuments, extending from the glans of the clitoris to the sides of the vagina. Their external side is continued from the inner surface of the labia, and from the prepuce of the clitoris, while their internal surface seems immediately continued from the fine, thin, vascular, integuments covering the clitoris it- self; they are spongy, and consist internally of cel- lular and adipose substance. A little lower, we see the orifice of the urethra; it is situated below the clitoris and arch of the pubis, betwixt the nymphae, and above the orifice of the vagina; it consists of a small rising prominence like a pea, in the centre of which is a small opening or hole. On each side of the orifice of the urethra, we meet generally with the orifices of two mucous glands, which by some are named Cowpeii’s Glands of the female. On separating the lower part of the labia pudendi, we see the Vestibulum, a space which leads to the vagina; it is bounded behind, by the carunculae myr- tiformes, or by the hymen in virgins ; on the sides, by the labia; before, by the perineum anterius, which projects forwards, forming a kind of valve, so that a little pit is formed behind it, which is termed Fossa Navicularis, or Scaphoides. The Hymen, or Circulus Membranosus, is a thin and extensile membrane, formed by a doubling of

It is joined by filaments of the cervical nerves. * 4. The Lingual Branch sent offby the third branch of the fifth pair of nerves, is also seen in the dissection of the neck. It is iound under the mylo- hyoideus ; it lies close upon the lower edge of the jaw-bone, betwixt the inferior edge of the pterygoi- deus internus and the upper part of the mylo-hyoi- deus. It gives numerous twigs to the sublingual, gland and submaxillary duct, which are situated near it, and is lost in the substance of the tongue. 5. Nervus Accessorius ad Pur Vagum.—The accessory nerve, having passed out of the cranium with the par vagnum, separates from it, passes behind the internal jugular vein obliquely downwards and. backwards; it perforhtes the mastoid muscle, and is distributed to the trapezius and muscles about the shoulder ; it is much connected with the third and fourth cervical nerves.

They send numerous branches to the muscles, &c. on the side of the neck, and communicate by filaments with all the other nerves in the neck. In this stage of the dissection, we may also see, 7.

( 52 ) pelvis should now be removed, by dividing the sym- physis pubis, and by sawing through the os ileum, or separating it at its junction with the sacrum. By carefully removing all the cellular membrane, the student will be enabled more accurately to examine the situation of the parts above described. OF THE VESSELS AND NERVES CON- TAINED WITHIN THE PELVIS. 1. ARTERIES. Tiie A. Iliaca Interna, having left the trunk of the iliaca communis, passes immediately into the pelvis, where it gives off several large arteries. 1. A. Ileo-Lumbalis supplies the psoas and iliacus internu3 muscles. 2. A. Sacuve L ITE.RALES, two or three small vessels which supply the sacrum, cauda equina, and neighbouring parts. 3. A. Glutea, (or iliaca posterior) a very large branch, passes out of the pelvis through the upper part of the sciatic notch to supply the haunch, but, in itspassagc, it gives some branches to the os sacrum, os coccygis, the rectum, and the muscles situated within the pelvis. 4. A. Sciatica passes out of the pelvis by the .sciatic notch, and below the pyriformis muscle to supply the hip: in its passage it gives branches to the neighbouring parts. 5. A. Punic a (pudenda communis or interna) is the

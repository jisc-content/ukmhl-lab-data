The fibres pass outwards, run by the side of the* tubercle of the radius, and pass over the outer edge of that bone, to be Inserted, tendinous and fleshy, into a rough surface on the back-part of the radius about its middle. Situation: Of the muscles which pass from theinter- nal condyle, the pronator teres is situated nearest the outer edge of the arm. It lies immediately on the inside of the tendon of the brachialis interims. Its tendon, to ah-ive at its place ofinsertion, passes under the belly of the supinator longus, and, when that muscle is removed, will be found inserted into the ra- dius immediately below the supinator brevis. Use: To roll the radius, together with the hand, inwards. * Synonyma : Pronator teres, sive Obllquus;—Epi- trochlo-radial. 2. The Flexor Carpi Radialis—Arises, by a narrow tendinous beginning from the lower and fore- part of the internal condyle of the os humeri: fleshy from the fascia andintcrmuscular ligaments, and from the upper end of the ulna. It forms a thick belly, which runs down the fore-arm, and terminates in a fiat tendon. This tendon passes under the annular li- gament * ot the wrist, runs through a groove in the os trapezium, ahd is v Inserted v 1 he annular ligament of the wrist consists of two parts. 1. lbe ligamentuiu carpi Iransversale externum passes from the sty In’.d process ot the ulna and os pisiforme, transversely, over the buck ot the wrist, and spreads out broad, to be affixed to the styloid process of the radius. Under it pass ihe tendons •• the extensor muscles. S^The ligameutum carpi transversals Mr internun

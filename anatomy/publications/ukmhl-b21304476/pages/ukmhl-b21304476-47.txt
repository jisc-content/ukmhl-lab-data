( 21 ) #f the hypogastric region, sometimes not beyond the navel; it contains in its duplicature more or less of adipose substance. (4.) The Mesentery.—Observe, that the peri- toneum, reflected from each side of the vertebra?, proceeds forward, to connect the intestines loosely to the spine; that it begins opposite to the first lum- bar vertebra, crosses obliquely from left to right, and ends half-way between the last lumbar vertebra and the groin. At its commencement, it binds down the extremity of the duodenum, and it terminates where the head of the colon begins. The great circumference -which is in contact with the intes- tines, is very much plaited or folded, and is Several yards in length. Between the lamime of mesentery, observe the Conglobate Glands, less numerous in old age: the branches of the superior mesenteric artery ramifying and forming arches; the mesen- teric veins accompanying the arteries; the trunk of the lacteals, situated contiguous to the mesenteric artery on its left side. It may sometimes be in- flated by the blow-pipe. Nerves also run in the mesentery, but are not easily demonstrated. (5.) The Mesocolon is similar to the mesentery, and connects, in like manner, the colon to the spine. c2. Hepar, the Liver.—Situation : Partly in the right hypochondrium, which it fills up, reaching as low as the kidney of that side, partly in the epigas- trium, and running also some way into the left hypochondrium. Connected by its four ligaments to the inferior sur- face of the diaphragm, and by the lesser epiploon to the small curvature of the stomach:—The little epiploon

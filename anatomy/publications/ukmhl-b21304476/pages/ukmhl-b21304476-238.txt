( 212 ) 3. Nervus Ma \i m. a uis Superior, or Second Branch of the Fifth Fair. The superior maxillary nerve, having left the cranium by the foramen rotun- dum of the sphenoid bone, emerges behind the an- trum maxillare, at the lower back part of the orbit, and at the root of the pterygoid process of the sphe- noid bone. It immediately sends out branches; 1. A small branch which passes through the spheno- maxillary slit to the periosteum and fat of the orbit. 2. The largest branch is the Infua-Orbitauy Nerve. It enters the channel in the top of the an- trum maxillare, accompanying the infra-orbitary artery, comes out at the foramen infra-orbitarium, and is widely distributed to the cheek, under 4ip, and outside of the nose, communicating with ramifi- cations of the portio dura. 3. Brunches to the tem- poral muscle, os malac, &c. 4. Other branches form a small ganglion at the root of the orbit, which sends twigs, named the superior Nasal Nerves, through the foramen spheno-palatinum to the nose. 5. The Vidian Nerve, which enters the foramen pterygoi- deutn, and passes again into the cranium, to connect itself with the portio dura. 0. The Palatine Nerve, which runs through the palato-maxillary canal to the palate. 7. Twigs which supply the gums and alveoli of the upper jaw. 4. Nervus Maxillaris Inferior, or Third Branch of the Fifth Pair. The inferior maxillary nerve leaves the cranium by the foramen ovale ot the sphenoid bone. It has its course downwards and outwards; and, having given twigs to the parts near which it passes, as the masseter, pterygoid, and tem- poral

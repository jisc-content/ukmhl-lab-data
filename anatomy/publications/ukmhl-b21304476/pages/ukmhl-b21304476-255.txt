( 229 ) (3.) The third branch supplies the obliquus infe- rior, and also gives off a twig, which assists in form- ing the lenticular ganglion. (4.) The fourth branch supplies the adductor oculi. 3. The Nerve of the Fourth Pair, N. Batiieti- cus, or Trochlearis, enters the orbit by the superior orbitary fissure, and runs to the obliquus superior.â€™ 4. The first branch of the Nerve of the Fifth Pair, named Ophthalmic, or Orbitary, enters the orbit by the superior orbitary fissure, and divides into three branches. (1.) The Frontal, Supra-orbitary, or Superci- / Iiary Nerves accompanies the frontal artery along the upper part of the orbit, close to the bone ; and having passed through the supra-orbitary notch, is distributed to the forehead. (2.) The Nasal Nerve, or inner branch, runs towards the nose, and is distributed to the inner side of the orbit, and to the nose. (3.) The Temporal or Lacrypial Branch, supplies the lacrymal gland, and the parts at the outer side of the orbit. TheLENTicuLARGAXGLioN is a asmallganglion, situated within the orbit, formed by short branches of the ophthalmic nerve, and by a twig of the third pair. It sends off delicate nerves, which run along the sides of the optic nerve, and pierce the coats of the eye. 5. The second branch of the Fifth Pair, called the Superior Maxillary nerve, sends off a branch through the bony canal in the bottom of the orbit. This

( St ) 5. The Gemini consist of two heads, which are distinct muscles. (1.) The superior arises from the back-part of the spinous process of the ischium. (2.) The inferior from the upper part of thetube- rosity of the os ischium, and the anterior surface of the posterior sacro-sciatic ligament. Inserted, tendinous and fleshy, into the cavity at the root of the trochanter major, immediately below the insertion of the pyrifbrmis, and above the inser- tion of the obturator externus. Situation: Like the other muscles, they arccover- ed by the gluteus maxim us; they lie below thepyri- formis, and above the quadratus femoris ; they are united by a tendinous and fleshy expansion, which forms a purse or sheath for the tendon of the obtu- rator interims. Use: To roll the thigh outwards, and to bind down the tendor. of the obturator interims. Synonyma : Gemelli;—Part of the raarsupialis ;— Ischio-spini-trochanterien.

The Orturatoh Internus.—It (irises, ten- dinous and fleshy, from more th!tn one half of the internal circumference of the foramen thyroidcum> and from the inner surface of the ligament which fills up that hole; its inside ii covered by a portion of the levator ani; it forms a flattened tendon, which passes out of the pelvis in a sinuosity betwixt the spinous process and tuberosity of the ischium: and becoming rounder, is Inserted

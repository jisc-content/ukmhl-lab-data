( 231 ) In this dissection we meet with twenty-two dis- tinct pair of muscles, besides a number of small muscles situated between the processes ofcontiguous vertebra. On removing the integuments of the posterior part of the neck and back, we expose, 1. The Trapezius—It arises, by a thick round tendon, from the lower part of the protuberance in the middle of the os occipitis behind; and, by a thin tendinous expansion, from the superior transverse ridge of that bone ; from the five superior cervical spinous processes by the ligamentum nuchae ; ten- dinous, from the two inferior cervical spinous pro- cesses, and from the spinous processes of all the ver- tebra of the back. The fleshy fibres coming from the neck descend obliquely, while those from the back ascend. Inserted, fleshy, into the posterior third part of tl»c clavicle; tendinous and fleshy, into the acromion, and into the upper edge of all the spine of the sca- pula. The fibres slide over a triangular surface at the extremity of the spine of that bone. Situation: This muscle is quite superficial, and ■conceals all the muscles situated in the posterior part of the neck, and upper part of the back. It adheres to its fellow the whole length of its origin. Its an- terior fibres lie posterior to those of the sterno-tnas- toideus, but are not in contact with them, a consi- derable quantity of adipose substance; being inter- posed. The posterior cervical ligament, (ligamentum nuchas vel colli,) is a ligament which arises ft'om the middle of the occipital bone, runs down on the back*

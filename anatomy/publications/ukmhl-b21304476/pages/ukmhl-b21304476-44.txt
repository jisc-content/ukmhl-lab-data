( 1 f>) «io Pums, and two lateral, named Inguinal regions. Make a longitudinal incision from the scrobi- culus cordis to the umbilicus, and from that point an oblique incision on each side towards the ante- rior spinous process of the os ilium, forming thus three triangular flaps. In doing this, avoid cutting the intestines, by raising the muscles from them after the first puncture. Before you disturb the viscera, observe the gene- ral situation of those parts which appear on first opening the abdomen. 1. The internal surface of the Peritoneum, smooth, shining, and colourless, covering the pa- rities of the abdomen, and the surface of all the viscera. 2. In the triangular portion of integument folded down over the pubes, three ligamentous cords pro- ject through the peritoneum, two running laterally, end the other in the middle, towards the navel. These are the remains of the two umbilical arteries and the urachus. The epigastric artery, accompanied by two veins, may be seen through the peritoneum, ascend- ing obliquely upwards and inwards from under Pou- part’s ligament. 4. The upper edge of the liver is seen extending from the right hypochondriac region, across the epigastric, into the left hypochondriac region; in it a fissure is seen, into which enters, inclosed in a duplicature of peritoneum, the ligamentum teres, which was, in the fu;tus, the umbilical vein.

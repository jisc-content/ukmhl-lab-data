( 222 ) Use : When both act, they pull the arytenoid car- tilages towards each other. Si/nonyma: Arytrenoideus minor. The single muscle is the Aryt/enoidjEUS Tna\'sversus, which arises from the whole length of one arytenoid cartilage, and passes across, to be Inserted into the whole length of the other ary- tenoid cartilage. Situation: It is situated anterior to the arytocnoidei obliqui. Use: Tosliut the rima glottidis, by bringing the arytenoid cartilages together. On each side of the larynx, there are also a few , muscular fibres, which are named as follows. 1. Thyreo-Epiglotideus—Arising, by a few pale separated fibres, from the thyroid cartilage, and Inserted into the epiglottis literally. Use: To draw the epiglottis obliquely downwards, or, when both muscles act, directly downwards; and at the same time to expand it. 2. The Aryt^sno-Epiglottideus—Arises, by a few slender fibres, from the lateral and upper part, of the arytenoid cartilage, and is ' p Inserted into the epiglottis, along with the former muscle. Use: When both muscles act, to pull the epiglot- tis close upon the glottis. *

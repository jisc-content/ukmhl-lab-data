Bolow the deltoid, it is superficial, and arises more outwardly than the brachialis in tern us, supinator radii longus, and extensors of the carpus. The brachialis extrrnus is situated immediately un- der the integuments; it begins to arise below the in- sertion of the teres major. It passes down the arm between the triceps longus, and coraco-brachialis at first, afterwards between the triceps longus and bra- chialis interims. The tendon of the triceps sends off a thin fascia, which covers the triangular surface of the ulna, on which we commonly lean. Numerous fibres are also sent off, to assist in forming the fascia of the fore-arm. Use: To extend the fore-arm. The long hea; will also assist in drawing the arms backwards.

( 10* ) SECT. II- DISSECTION' OF THE POSTERIOR PART OF THE EEG. The fascia which invests the posterior part of the leg, is much thinner and less strong than in the fore- part ; it must be removed, to expose the parts now to be described. MUSCLES ON THE POSTERIOR PART OF THE LEG. These are seven in number. 1. The Gastrocnemius Externus, or Gemel- lus— Arises^ by two distinct heads;—The first, or Internal Head, arises, tendinous, from the upper and back-part of the internal condyle of the os femora, and fleshy from the oblique ridge over that condyle. —The second, or External Head, arises in the same manner, fvon^the external condyle. Each of the heads forms a fleshy bell)-, the fibres of which are oblique, passing from a tendinous expansion which covers the posterior surface of the muscle to another tendinous expansion which covers the anterior sur- face, or that surface which lies nearest the bones. Tiie two bellies, of which the internal is by much the largest, are separated by a considerable triangular interval, in which the popliteal blood-vessels and nerves pass to the leg, but descending, unite a little below the knee-joint in a middle tendinous line, and below the middle of the tibia send off a broad fiat tendon, which unites a little above the ankle with the tendon of the soleus. *.

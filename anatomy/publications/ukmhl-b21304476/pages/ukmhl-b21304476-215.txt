( 189 ) costal betwixt the fourth and eighth dorsal ver- tebra ; these twigs, passing forwards on the bodies of the vertebrae unite to form the splanchnic nerve, which may be traced entering the abdo- men, betwixt the crura of the small muscle of the diaphragm. From the intercostal, also, twigs are given off, which assist the branches of the parVagunwmd of the dorsal nerves, in forming several plexuses to sup- ply the viscera of the thorax The right intercostal ne ve lies under the pleura by the right side of the spine. Still nearer the mid- dle of the spine, you see the Vena Azygos. In dissecting, it is found situated betwixt the right intercostal nerve and the aorta ; it begins below from rarpilications of the lumber arteries, which pierce the small muscle of the diaphragm. This vein ascends along the spine, receiving veins from each of the intercostal spaces of the right side, and, about the middle of the back, it receives a considerable trunk, which comes from under the aorta, and returns the blood from the left side of the thorax. At the fourth dorsal vertebra, the vena azygos leaves the spine ; it makes a curve forward, and empties its blood into the back-part of the vena cava superior, immediate- ly before that vein enters the pericardium. Descending through the posterior mediastinum, will be also found the Aokta. This great artery, having formed its arch, comes in contact with the third dorsal vertebra, and is now called the Descend- ing Aorta, or Thoracic Aorta. It descends along the bodies ol the dorsal vertebae, rather on their left side; n

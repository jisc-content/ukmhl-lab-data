( 213 ) poral muscles, it divides at the angle of the lower jaw into two branches. 1. The Nervus Dentalis Inferior enters the foramen at the angle of the lower jaw; accompanies the inferior dental artery along the canal in that bone, giving nerves to the teeth ; emerges by the foramen mentale, and is distributed to the chin. 2. The Nervus Gustatorius, vel Lingualis, passes to the tongue. It was seen in the dissection of the neck lying close upon the lower jaw-bone, below the in- ferior edge of the pterygoideus interims, and above the superior fibres of the mylo-hyoideus. It supplies the substance of the tongue, and the salivary glands situated at the root of the tongue. This nerve receives the chorda tympani, a small twig which comes from the seventh pair through the slit in-the articulating cavity of the temporal bone. 5 In the dissection of the face, we also meet with the Frontal Nerve, which comes from the first branch of the fifth pair, and which is seen accompa- nying the frontal artery through the foramen supra- crbitariura. It is distributed to the forehead. CHAP;

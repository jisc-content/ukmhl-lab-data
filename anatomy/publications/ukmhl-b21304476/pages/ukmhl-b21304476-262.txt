( 23G ) nous procfissesof the three inferior cervical vertebrae, and of the two superior dorsal. „ Inserted, by distinct fleshy slips, into the second, third, fourth, and sometimes the fifth ribs, a little beyond their angle. Situation: This muscle is concealed by the rhom- boideus and scapula, except a few of its superior fibres, which appear above the upper edge of the rhom’ooideus minor. It covers part of the origin of the splenius. Use: To elevate the ribs, and dilate the thorax. ' Synonyma : Cervici dorso-costal. Reflect it from the spine. 7. The Splenius is divided into two portions: ( 1.) The Splenius Capitis—Arises, tendinous, from the spinous processes of the two superior dorsal, and five inferior cervical vertebrae. It forms a flat broad muscle, which ascends obliquely, and is inserted, ten- dinous, into the posterior part of the mastoid process, and into a small part of the os occipitis, immediately below its superior transverse ridge. Situation: This muscle is covered by the trapezius, and by the insertion of the sterno-cleido-mastoideus, and a small part of it is seen on the side of the neck betwixt those two muscles. The lower part of its origin is covered by the serratus superior posticus. ' Reflect it from the occiput. (2.) The Splenius Colli—Arises, tendinous, from the spinous processes of the third, fourth, fifth, and sometimes the sixth dorsal vertebrae. It forms a small fleshy belly, which ascends by the side of the verte- bras, and is inserted into the transverse processes of the

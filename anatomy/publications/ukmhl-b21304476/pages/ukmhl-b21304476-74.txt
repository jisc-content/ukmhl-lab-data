( « ) left suspended by their attachments to tlie bone. The rectum must be separated from the bladder, and pulled downwards. This dissection will expose a great part of the levator ani;—the neck and body of^ the bladder;—the prostate gland;—the vesiculae se- niinales;—the glandules anteprostatae ;—part of the rasa deferentia:—part of the ureters ;—the urethra, its membranous part, its bulb, and corpus spongi- osum ;—the crura penis, and their origins from the ischium ;—Observe, 1. The connection of the bladder and rectum, and the cellular substance interposed between them. 2. The prostate gland; Situated between the blad- der and rectum, surrounding the beginning of the urethra in such a manner, that one third of its thick- ness is situated above the urethra, and two thirds below it; its shape is somewhat pyriform, and its consistence between cartilage and ligament. 3. The Urethra.—The curve should be care- fully observed. The urethra begins at the neck of the bladder; it is a continuation of that part of the bladder which in the erect posture is lowest. (1.) Its beginning is embedded in the prostate gland. (2.) Its membranous pq^t is very short,—situatedbe- tween the prostate gland and bulb of the urethra:— in dissecting, remark, that there is a firm fasciculus of fibres surrounding it, and connecting it and the pro- state gland to the arch of the pubis;—this fasciculus gives support to the urethra, and is termed the liga- mentum triangulare urethrae. It is sometimes de- scribed as a compressor muscle of the prostategland. (3.) The urethra then enters the corpus spongiosum. 4. The

( 258 ) angle*. It passes forwards along the inferior edge of the infra-spinatus, adheres to the capsular ligament of the shoulder-joint., and is Inserted, tendinous and fleshy, into the lower and back-part of the great tuberosity of the os humeri. Situation ; It is inserted below the tendon of the infra-spinatus. Its origin lies between the infra- spinatus and teres major, and is partly concealed by them. The middle of its belly is superficial, and not covered by any muscle ; but its insertion is concealed by the deltoid. The fascia which covers the infra- spinatus, envelopes also the teres minor; and the two muscles are, in some subjects, so closely united, as to be with difficulty separated. Use: To draw the humerus downwards and back- wards, and to roll it outwards. Synon jma: Margini-sus-scapulo-trochitcrien. 5. The Teres Majorâ€”Arises, from an oblong, rough, flatted surface, at the inferior angle of the scapula. It forms a thick bell)', which passes for- wards and upwards towards the inside of the arm. Inserted, by a broad thin tendon, into the ridge of the os humeri, at the inner side of the groove for lodging the tendon of the long head of the biceps flexor cubiti. Situation : The origin of this muscle is superficial, and adheres to the lower fibres of the infra-spinatus. Its belly passes before the long head of the triceps extensor cubiti. Its tendon is inserted along with the tendon of the latissimus dorsi. Observe the relative situation of these tendons j they both puss under the coraco-brachialis and short head of the biceps flexor, te

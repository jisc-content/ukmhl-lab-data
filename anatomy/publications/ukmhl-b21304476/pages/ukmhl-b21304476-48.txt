( 22 ) epiploon should now he removed, to discover th« different parts of the liver. Observe the superior or convex surface adapted to the arcli of the diaphragm ; the inferior or concave surface resting on the stomach;—the posterior or thick edge lying against the vertebra;, and the ante- rior thin margin corresponding to the lower edge of the chest;—Observe the three lobes of the liver;— the great or right lobe ;—the small or left lobe;— the lobulus spigelii;—the great fissure, separating the right and left lobe, and receiving the suspensory ligament, and the ligamentum teres;—the cavity of the porta* between the great lobe and lobulus spige- lii ;—the fissure on the right side of the lobulus for the vena cava inferior, which fissure is almost a complete foramen ;—the notch in the back-part for the vertebrae ;—the depression in the right lobe for the gall-bladder. Observe the vessels in the cavity of the portae, the hepatic artery on the left side, the ductus communis choledochus on the right side, and betwixt, but at the same time behind them, the vena portae ; they are all surrounded by a plexus of nerves. These vessels and nerves pass along the edge of the mesogaster, or little omentum, sur- rounded and connected by adipose and cellular substance; the part is called Capsula Gligsoni. Observe that the ligamentum teres was the umbi- lical vein oi the foetus, entering the vena portas, and that the ductus venosus in the foetus, (oblite- rated in the adult), leaving the vena portae, passed into one of the venae cavac hepaticae. 13.

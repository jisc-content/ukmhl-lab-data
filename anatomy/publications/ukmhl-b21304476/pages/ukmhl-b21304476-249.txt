( 223 ) CHAP. XI. DISSECTION OF THE ORBIT OF THE EYE. HHIIE globe or ball of the eye is situated about the JL middle of the orbit. It is connected to the bone of its muscles, and by the optic nerve ; and all these parts are imbedded, posteriorly in a soft, fatty substance, which fills up the bottom of the orbit— The tunica, or membrana conjunctiva, is seen lining the inner surface of the eye-lids, and reflected from them over the anterior part of the globe of the eye, so that the back-part of the eye-ball, and all the muscles and nerves, are situated behind it. This. membrane must therefore be dissected away, the up- per part of the orbit, which is formed by the os fron- tis, removed with a saw, and the fat surrounding the muscles, vessels, and nerves, cautiously dissected away with the scissars. SECT. I. MUSCLES SITUATED WITHIN THE ORBIT. Seven muscles are contained within the orbit, of .which one belongs to the upper eye-lid, and six to the globe of the eye. • K 4 1, The

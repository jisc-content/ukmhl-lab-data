Inserted into the base of the os hyoides, between its cornu and the insertion of the sterpo-hyoideus. Situation: 1 lie lower part of this muscle is cover- ed by the trapezius ; its middle by the sterno-cleido- mastoideus; its anterior part is seen on removing the platysma myoidcs; it crosses over the carotid artery, and internal jugular vein.

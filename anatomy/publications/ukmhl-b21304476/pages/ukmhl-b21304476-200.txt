( 17+ ) sternum to the dorsal vertebrae, they form the me- diastinum.—The pleura lines the ribband the upper surface of the diaphragm, and is reflected over the lung, which is in fact behind it; it forms the ligu- mentum latum pulmonis, a reflection of this mem- brane, which connects the inferior edge of the lungs to the spine and diaphragm. 2. The Lungs.—Colour, reddish in children, greyish in adults, arid bluish in old age.—S/iupc, corresponding to that of the thorax, somewhat py- ramidal, convex towards the ribs, concave towards the diaphragm, and irregularly flatted next the me- diastinum. Division (1.) The Right Lung is the largest, and is divided into three lobes, two greater one6, and an intermediate lesser lobe. (2.) The Left Lung has two lobes, and alst square notch opposite the apex of the heart. Into the sulci or grooves which form the divisions of the lungs into lobes, the pleura enters ; that part of the lung which is affixed to the spine, is called its root; it is the part by which the great vessels enter. 3. The Pericardium is a strong, white, and compact membrane, smooth, and lubricated upon the inside, forming a bag for containing the heart, and having its inner lamina reflected over the sub- stance of the heart itself. 4. When you slit open the fore-part of the peri- cardium, youexpose the Mea rt. The right ven- tricle protrudes; the right auricle also is towards you ; while the left auricle is retired, and its lip is seen lapping round upon the left ventricle. ITom under

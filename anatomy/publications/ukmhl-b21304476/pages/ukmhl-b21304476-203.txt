( 177 ) by the right subclavian vein, and the right internal jugular. 2. A larger branch coming from the left side ; it is formed by the left subclavian and left internal jugular, which unite to form a trunk. This trunk crosses before the arteries arising from the arch of the aorta, and then enters the superior vena cava. Into the posterior part of the angle formed by the union of the left subclavian and the left jugular, the thoracic duct empties itself. On each side, the internal jugular vein descends along the neck by the side of the carotid, while the subclavian vein comes from the arm. The Vena Cava Inferior, immediately after passing through the diaphragm from the abdomen enters the pericardium. The Aorta leaves the heart opposite the fourth dorsal vertebra; it crosses over the pulmonarjr artery ascends obliquely upwards, backwards, and to the right side, as high as the second dorsal vertebra. Here it forms an Arch or incurvation, which passes from the right to the left aide, and at the same time obliquely from before backwards; it then c-omes in contact with the upper part of the third dorsal ver- tebra, and descends along the spine in the posterior mediastinum. This arch of the aorta is situated behind the first bone of the sternum, behind and somewhat below the left branch of the vena cava superior. c From the upper part of the arch come off three large arteries. 1. The Arteria Innominata, or common H 5 trunk

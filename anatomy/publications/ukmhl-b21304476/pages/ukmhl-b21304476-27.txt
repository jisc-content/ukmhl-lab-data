3. In A COMPENDIUM PRACTICAL ANATOMY. GENERAL RULES FOR DISSECTION. EXTERITY in the manual operation of dis- section can only be acquired by practice; the observance, however, of certain general rules, will facilitate the labour of the student. 1. The position of the hand in dissecting should be the same, as in writing or drawing; and the knife, held, like the pen or pencil, by the thumb and the two first fingers, should be moved by means of them only; while the hand rests firmly on the two other fingers bent inwards as in writing, and on the wrist. The instrument can be guided with much more stea- diness and precision in this way, than when it is moved by means of the wrist, elbow, or shoulder, in the manner which young dissectors often fall into. 2. No more of the integuments should at any time be removed, than is necessary for the present dissec- tion, as exposure to the air renders the parts dry and indistinct.

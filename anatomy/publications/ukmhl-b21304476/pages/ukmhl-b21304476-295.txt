( 269 ) two muscles, and above the fibres of the flexor digi- torum sublimis. This muscle is sometimes wanting. Use: To bend the hand, and to stretch the palmar aponeurosis. Synonyma : Ulnaris gracilis ;—Epitrochlo-carpu palmaire. 4. The Flexor Carpi Ulnaris—Arises, tendi- nous, from the inferior part of the internal condyle of the os humeri; tendinous and fleshy, from the inner 6ide of the olecranon, and by a tendinous expansion from the posterior ridge * of the ulna, to near the lower end of the bone. It also arises from the inter- muscular ligaments and fascia of the fore-arm. The fibres pass obliquely forwards into a tendon which' runs over the fore-part of the ulna, and is Inserted into the os pisiforme,and sometimes sends its fibres over a small ligament which goes to the base of the metacarpal bone of the little finger. Situation: Thismuscle arises behind the other mus* cle which pass from the internal condyle. It runs along the inner edge of the fore-arm, between the flexor sublimis on the fore-part, and the extensor, carpi-ulnaris on the back-part of the ulna. The ten- don is hound dow n by a thin aponeurotie slip, wdficli passes from the inner part of the annular ligament of the wrist. Use: To bend the hand. Synonyma: Ulnaris interims;—Epitrochli-cubito- carpien. 5. 1 he Flexor Sublimis Perforatum—Arises, tendinous and fleshy, from the under part of the inter- * the ridge which leads to the styloid process.

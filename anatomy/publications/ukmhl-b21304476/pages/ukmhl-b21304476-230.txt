The Massetek is divided into two portions, which decussate one another. The Anterior Portion arises, tendinous and fleshy, from the superior maxillary bone, where it joins the os mala:; from the lower edge of the os make, and from its zygomatic process. The strong fibres run obliquely downwards and backwards, and are in- serted into the outer surface of the side of the lower jaw, extending as for back as its angle. The Posterior Portion arises, principally fleshy, from the inferior surface of the os make, and of the whole of the zygomatic process, as far back as the tubercle before the socket for .the condyle of the lower jaw. The fibres slant forwards, and are in- serted, tendinous, into the outer surface of tne coro- noid process of the lower jaw.

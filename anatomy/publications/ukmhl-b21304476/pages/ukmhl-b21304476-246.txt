The Larynx is composed of five Cartilages: 1. The Thyroid Cartilage, situated immediately below the os hyoides in the middle of the throat. 2. The Cricoid Cartilage, situated immediately below the thyroid cartilage, betwixt it and the superior rings of the trachea. 3. The Epiglottis, a broad triangular cartilage, very elastic, situated behind the root of the tongue, and covering the entrance into the upper part of the larynx. 4. and 5. The arytenoid cartilages, two small bodies, like peas, situated be- hind the thyroid cartilage, on the upper edge of the back-part of the cricoid cartilage, and between the two alaj or wings of the thyroid cartilage. These two small cartilages form betwixt themselves and the thy- roid a longitudinal fissure, extending from before backwards, which is called the Glottis, or Rima Glottidis, and loads to the trachea. The muscles situated about the glottis consist of four pair of small muscles, and a single one. 1.

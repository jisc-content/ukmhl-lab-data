are thicker than those of the right auricle. The septum auricularum, with the fossa ovalis, is here seen less distinctly than on the right side. Observe also the ostium venosum, opening into the left ven- tricle, and giving attachment to the Valvula Mi- TRALIS. The Left Ventricle may be opened in the same manner as the right, by an incision carefully made in the left side of the septum or partition of the ventricles, and continued round the upper part of the ventricle, under the auricle. Observe the great thickness of the muscular coat; the Valvula Mitralis, forming two projections, which are at- tached by the chordae tendineae to the fleshy columns of this ventricle. Slit up the aorta ; it has three semilunar valves, which resemble those of the pulmonary artery;â€” behind these valves the artery bulges out, forming the Sinuses of the aorta. Above two of the valves lie the orifices of the two coronary arteries, of which the left is the largest. CHAP.

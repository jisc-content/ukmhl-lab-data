( 153 ) Immediately under the integuments, and adhering to them, 1. The Muse ulus Cutaneus, vulgo, Platysma mvoidcs.—It arises, by slender separate fleshy fibres, from the cellular substance, covering the upper part of the deltoid and pectoral muscles. These fibres form a thin broad muscle, which runs obliquely up- wards, and is Inserted, into the skin and muscles covering the lower jaw and cheek. This muscle should be dis- sected in the course of its fibres; the skin, there- fore, must be dissected off in an oblique direction from the clavicle to the chin. ■ Use: To draw the skin of the cheek downwards, and, when the mouth is shut, to draw the skin under the lower jaw upwards. Synonyma : Quadratus genae:—Lattissimus colli; —Thoraco-maxilli-facial. Remove the platysma myoides from its origin, and invert it over the face. Immediately beneath it is seen the external jugular vein, which is formed of branches from the temple, side of the face, and throat. It crosses obliquely over the tserno-mastoi- deus, passes behind the outer edge of that muscle, and dives beneath the clavicle, to enter the subcla- vian vein. 2. The Stervo-Cleido-Mastoideus—Arises, by two distinct origins; the anterior, tendinous and fleshy, and somewhat round, from the to^> of the sternum, near its junction with the clavicle; the posterior or outer, fleshy and flat, from the upper G 5 and

Under the flexor sublimis are the four tendons of the flexor profundus perforans, which pass through the slits in the tendons of the former, and are in- 'J 9 serted into the bases of the third phalanges of the fingers. The Lunbricales are four small mucles, which arise, tendinous and fleshy, from the outer side of the tendons ot the flexor profundus perforans, soon after those tendon» have passed the ligamentum carpi annulare. Each of these muscles has a small belly, which terminates in a tendon. The tendon runs along the outer edge of the finger, and is Inserted into thetendinoiia expansion which covers the back-part of the phalanges of the fingers, about the middle of the first joint. Use: To bend the first phalanges of the fingers, the flexor profundus being previously in action, to afford them n fixed point. tiyninyma: Annuli-tendino-phalangiens. The short muscles of the thumb and fore-finger are five in number. I.

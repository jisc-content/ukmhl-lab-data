( 2G6 ) tiar, and interosseal arteries. The artery is accompa- nied by two veins; and on its inner side runs the ra- dial nerve. Idle dissection of the fascia of thefore-arm is simi- lar to that of the fascia of the leg. It is found firmly attached to the fibres of the muscles, so that the ex- posed surface appears ragged. It sends down betwixt them partitions, named Intermuscular Ligaments or Tendons, which connect the muscles, and give origin to many of their fibres. MUSCLES SITUATED ON THE FORE T ART OF TIIF. CUBIT AND ARISING FROM THE INNER CON- DYLE OF THE OS HUMERI. These are eight in number, and may be divided into two classes; the superficial, and the deep-seated. First, The superficial. All the muscles passing from the inner condyle, may be said to arise by one common tendinous head from the condyle; and this head may be said to divide - into the different muscles; but they will be here de- scribed as arising distinct from the condyle. It must, however, be recollected, that their origins are inti- mately connected by intermuscular ligaments, and that they cannot be separated without dividing some of their fibres. L The Pronator Radii Teresâ€”Arises, ten- dinous and fleshy, from the anterior surface of the in- ner condyle of the os humeri, and from the coronoid process of the ulna. It also arises from the fascia of the

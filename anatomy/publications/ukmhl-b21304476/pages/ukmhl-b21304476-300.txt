The tendon becomes gradually rounder, and is Inserted into a rough surface on the outer side of the inferior extremity of the radius. Situation: This muscle is situuted immediately under the integuments along the outer edge of the arm and fore-arm. It begins to arise from the os humeri immediately below the insertion of the del- toid. Its origin lies betwixt the brachialis internes and short head of the triceps oxtensor cubiti, from which it is separated by the external intermuscular ligament. It descends along the radius, placed at first between the extensor carpi radialis longiorand pronator teres, lower down between the tendons of the flexor carpi radialis and extensor radialis lon- gior. Its insertion is crossed by the extensors of the thumb. Use: To roll the radius outwards, and turn the palm of the hand upwards; also to bend the fore-arm on the humerus.

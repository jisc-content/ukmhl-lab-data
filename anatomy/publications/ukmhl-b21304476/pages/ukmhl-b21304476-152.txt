A transverse incision, extending from ear to ear over the crown of the head, being made through the tendon of the occipito-frontalis, the two flaps may, with facility, be inverted on the face and neck. Remove the superior part of the cranium by a saw- directed anteriorly through the frontal bone above the orbitar process, and posteriorly as low as the transverse ridge of the occipital bone. Thus the subsequent demonstration of the brain will be con-, ducted with greater facility. When the superior part of the cranium, commonly called the Calvarium, or skull-cap, is torn off, which requires considerable force, you expose the Dura Mater, a firm, compact, and whitish membrane, somewhat shining, rough on its outer surface, from the rupture of vessels which connected it to the cra- nium, and covered with bloody spots in consequence of the blood effused from these ruptured edifices. It is described as being separable into many laminae, into

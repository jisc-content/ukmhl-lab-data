( 232 ) i back-part of the npck, adhering to the spinous pro- cesses of the cervical vertebrae, and giving origin to the fibres of the trapezius, and of other muscles. Use: T o move the scapula in different directions. The superior fibres draw it obliquely upwards, the middle transverse ones draw it directly backwards, un^l the inferior fibres move it obliquely downwards and backwards. Also, to draw back the head, and contribute to its rotatory motions. Synonyma: Cucullaris;—Occipiti-dorso-clavi-sus- acromien. it should be reflected from the spine and head. 2. The Latissi.mus Doksi—Arises', by a broad thin tendon, from all the spinous processes of the os sacrum, and of the lumbar vertebrae ; from the spi- nous processes of the seven inferior dorsal vertebrae; from the posterior part of the spine of the os ilium; also from the extremities of the four inferior false ribs, by four distinct fleshy digitations, which inter- mix with those of the obliquus externus abdominis. The inferior fleshy fibres ascend obliquely ; the su- perior run' transversely: they pass over the inferior angle of the scapula, (from which the'muscle often receives a thin fasciculus of fibres,) to reach the axilla, where they are all collected and twisted. Inserted, by a strong flat tendon, into the inner edge of the groove in the os humeri, which receives the long tendon of the biceps flexor cubiti. Situation: Where this muscle arises from the dor- sal vertebrae, it is concealed by the origin of the tra- t pezius. The remainder of it is placed immediately under the skin, and covers the deeper seated mus- cles.

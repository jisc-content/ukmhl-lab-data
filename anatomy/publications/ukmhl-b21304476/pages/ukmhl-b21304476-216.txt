Intekcostales Inferiors^—The ar- teries which supply the three or four superior inter- costal spaces, generally come off in one common trunk, which afterwards subdivides. The Intercostalis Superior, on the right side, is mostly sent off by the subclavian; on the left side, by the aorta. The Inferior Intercostals are eight or wine in number on each side of the thorax ; they come off separately from the side or back-part of the aorta, and seem to tie that great artery to the spine. Each intercostal artery passes immediately into the interval betwixt two ribs, and there subdivides into, (1.) A branch which perforates between the heads of the ribs to the muscles of the hack ; this branch also gives twigs which enter the spinal canal. (2.) The continued trunk of’the artery runs for- wards, in the interval of the two ribs, giving many branches to the intercostal muscles. When it reaches- the anterior part of the thorax, it .is lost in the muscles. Each intercostal artery is accompanied by one or two veins, branches of the vena azygos, and by an intercostal or dorsal nerve. 2. A. Bronchiai.es, are two, sometimes three, small twigs of the aorta, one of which passes to the * lungs on each side; they sometimes arise lrom the subclavian and superior intercostal. 3. Small arteries p;iss forwards from the aorta on the

( 185 ) muscle, and then passes under the acromion, to ra- mify on the muscles below the spine of the scapula. It is generally a branch of the A. Thyroidea Inferior, and is then named A. Transversalis Humeri. 3. A. Scapux.aris Externa, Infrascapula- ris, or Thoracica Posteripr, arises from the under and back part of the axillary artery, attaches itself to the inferior costa of the scapula, where it splits into two great branches: 1. A large branch, which passes to the outer.surface of the scapula below the spine, and has its principal ramifications close upon the bone. 2. The other branch (which is larger) passes to the inner surface of the scapula, supplies the subsc-apularis, and sends branches downward# to the muscles of the back and loins. 4. Arteria Circumflexa Humeri Poste- rior, Humeralis, or Ileflexa-articularis, arises from the lower and fore part of the axillary artery, and runs backwards close to the bone, surrounds its neck, and is lost on the inner surface of the deltoid ; it gives also twigs to the joint and neighbouring muscles. 5. A. Circumflexa Anterior is a much smaller artery,\>ften a branch of the circumflexa posterior ; it encircles the neck of the bone on its fort-part, and is lost on the inner surface of the dcltoides, where it inosculates with the posterior circumflex artery. 1 he Great Brachial Nerves accompany the subclavian artery over the first rib. In the axilla they are united by numerous cross branches, forming the Axillary or Brachial Plexus, which is continued from

The mus- cles are divided into two masses; of which one lies over the radius and back of the fore-arm, and con- tains the supinators and extensors: the other, situ- ated over the ulna, and inner side of the fore-arm, consists of the pronators and flexors. Alt'tough some muscles in each of these masses arise quite separate- ly, others are joined into a common tendinous and fleshy origin, in the way above described. First clean all the muscles as they lie; and after observing them in their relative position, reflect each muscle, beginning with the superficial ones, and reading its description at the same time. SECT. III. DISSECTION OF THE TALM OF THE HAND. The tenefons which pass over the bones of the carpus into the palm of the hand are firmly bound clown by the annular ligament of the wrist. They are invested and connected by cellular membrane, which forms sheaths, and secretes synovia to facili- tate their motions. In the sole of the foot w'e saw a strong fascia, sup- porting and covering the muscles, and passing from the heel to the toes. On removing the integuments from the palm of the hand, we meet with a similar fascia. It arises from the tendon of the palmaris longu -, and from the annular ligament of the wrist, , expands

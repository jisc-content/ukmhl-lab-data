The Scalenus Posticus—Arises, tendinous, from the transverse processes of the fifth and sixth vertebrae of the neck. Inserted into the upper edge of the first rib, near the spine. Synonyma: Third scalenus;—Scalenus secundus, —Trachelo-costal. Situation: These muscles are covered before by the sterno-mastoideus and trapezius, behind by the trapezius and lavator scapulae; but the scaleni are so connected with the muscles of the spine, that the whole of them cannot be demonstrated till the mus- cles of the back and neck are dissected.

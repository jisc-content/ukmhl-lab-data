( 265 ) find, as in the leg, a strong fascia investing all the muscles. This fascia is continued from the inter- muscular ligaments which pass down to the condyles of the os humeri. It is attached to the condyles, and it adheres firmly to the olecranon of the ulna. It re- ceives,on the posterior part, a great addition of fibres from the tendon of the triceps extensor; and on the fore-part of the arm, it appears to be a continuation of the aponeurosis which is sent off from the biceps flexor cubiti. Above the fascia, we meet with several cutaneous veins and nerves. The veins have been already de- scribed ; the nerves are twigs of the branches of the brachial plexus. The relative situation of the vessels at the bend of the 5trm should be well attended to. The cutaneous veins situated here vary much in size. The vena ba- silica is seen running over the fore-part of the bend of the arm near the inner condyle, the vena cephalica situated near the outer condyle; and each of these veins receives a branch passing obliquely from the vena tnediana major. These vessels lie above the fas- cia, while the brachial artery lies deep beneath the fascia, in a hollow resembling that of the axilla. It descends over the joint near the inner condyle,on the inside of the tendon of the biceps flexor cubiti, and under the aponeurosis sent off from that mhscle to the common fascia of the fore-arm. It lies embedded in cellular substance, betwixt the pronator teres and flexor muscles of the wrist and fingers <on one side, and the supinator longus and extensor muscles on the ether. In this hollow, it divides into the radial, ul- M mw,

( 210 ) hyoides, extending as far forwards as the graniform process, or appendix; and from the ligament which connects it to the thyroid cartilage. The superior fibres ascend obliquely, the others run more trans- versely. Inserted into the cuneiform process of the os oc- cipitis, before the foramen magnum, and into a white line in the middle of the posterior surface of .the pharynx, where it is joined to its fellow. Situation: The lower part of this muscle is covered by the muscle last described, while the upper part, covers the inferior fibres of the constrictor superior. Use: To compress that part of the pharynx which it invests, and to dra\V it and the os hyoides up- wards. Synonyma: Hyo-pharyngeus,* and Chondro pha* ryngeus;—Hyo-glosso-basi-pharyngien. 3. Constrictor Pit a ryngis Supei'.ior,—Arises, above, from the cuneiform process of the os oc- cipitis, before the foramen magnum ; lower down from the pterygoid process of the sphenoid booc; from the upper and under jaw, near the alveolar r processes of the last dentes molareS ; and from the back-part of the buccinator muscle. Some fibres also come from the root of the tongue, and from the palate. Inserted into a white line in the middle of the pos- terior surface of the pharynx. Situation : The larger part of this muscle is co- vered by the constrictor medius. Use : To compress the upper part of the pharynx, and draw it forwards and upwards. K 2 Synonyma,;

( 248 ) Situation: These muscles are seen, on removing the muscles which cover the thorax. •Synonyma: Inter-lateri-costaux. The Levatores Costarum are twelve small muscles, situated on each side of the dorsal verte- hr;r. They are portions of the external intercostals. Each of these small muscles arises from the trans- verse process of one of the dorsal vertebra?, and passes downwards, to be inserted into the upper side of the rib next below the vertebra?, near its tuberosity. The first of these muscles passes from the last cer- vical vertebra, the eleven others from the eleven superior dorsal vertebrae. The three or four inferior Levatores are longer, and run down to the second rib below the transverse process from which they arise. Hence Albinus names them the Levatores Costarum Longiores et Breviores. Synonyma: Supra-costales. 2. The Intercostales Interni—Arise from the inferior acute edge of each superior rib, be- ginning at the sternum, and extending as far as the angle of the rib. The fibres run obliquely down- wards and backwards, and are Inserted i nto the superior obtuse edge of each in- ferior rib from the sternum to the angle. Portions of the internal intercostals pass over one rib, and are inserted into the next below it. Synonyma: Inter-pleuri-costaux. Thus the intercostal muscles decussate, and arc double on the sides of the thorax ; but, from the spine to the angles of the ribs, there are only the external intercostals, and, from the cartilages to the sternum.

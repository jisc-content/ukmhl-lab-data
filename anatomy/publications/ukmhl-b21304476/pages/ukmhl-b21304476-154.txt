{ 128 ) 3. A. Meningea Posterior is given off by the â€¢vertebral artery; the dura mater also receives small twigs from the occipital, pharyngeal arteries, <Src. The nerves of the dura mater are said to come from the fifth pair; if they exist at all, they are small, and seldom demonstrated. OF THE SEPTA OF THE BRAIN, OR PROCESSES OF THE DURA MATER. 1. The Falx (septum sagittale, verticale. medias- tinum cerebri, or falciform process) is a long and broad fold, or duplicature of the inner lamina of the dura mater, dividing the cerebrum into two hemi- spheres, extending from the crista galli of the eth- moid bone, along the middle of the os frontis and point of junction of the two parietal bones, to the crucial ridge of the occipital bone, where it termi- nates in the middle of the next septum. 2. The Tentorium Cerebellt, or transverse septum. This separates the cerebrum (Vom the cere- bellum, and is formed by the inner lamina of the dura mater, reflected off from the os occipitis along the groove of the lateral sinuses, and the edge or angle of the temporal bones. It Js frequently called Tentorium Cerebello'Super Extensurn. Its position is horizontal. There are some other folds of the dura mater, not visible in this stage of the dissection. 3. The falx of the cerebellum, or small occipital septum, will be seen when the cerebrum is re- moved. It extends from the middle of the tento- rium along the middle spine of the os occipitis to the-

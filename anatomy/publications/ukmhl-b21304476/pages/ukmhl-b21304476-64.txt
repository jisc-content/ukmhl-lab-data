( 38 ) aorta, below the spermatic arteries ; it passes in the mesentery to the left side of the abdomen, where it divides as follows. (1.) The ColicA Sinistra, an artery which ascends along the left side of the colon, to inos- culate with the A. Colica Media. (2.) Branches which pass to the sigmoid flexure. (3 ) The great trunk of the artery runs down behind the rectum, on which it ramifies largely, and is termed Art. ITemorrhoidai.is Interna. 7. The Lumbar Arteihes are five or six small arteries on each side, which arise from the back- part of the aorta, and are distributed to the spinal canal, peritoneum, muscles of the spine, and of the sides of the abdomen and pelvis. They inosculate with the A. Epigastrica, Circumfiexa ilii, <Src.. 8. A. Sacra Media Ls a single artery, arises from the back-part of the aorta at its bifurcation, and descends along the anterior surface of the sa- crum, giving twigs to all the neighbouring parts. At the fourth lumbar vertebra, the aorta bifur- cates into the two primitive or common iliacs. '1 he Iliaca Communis runs along the edge of the psoas muscle, and at an inch or two from its origin divides into, (1.) The Internal Iliac, which passes down into the pelvis. (2.) The External Iliac, which, following the direction of the psoas muscle, passes under Poll- partâ€™s ligament, and becomes the inguinal artery. 2. VEINS.

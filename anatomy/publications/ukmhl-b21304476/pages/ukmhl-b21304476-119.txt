( 9^ ) erect position it is anterior to the gastrocnemius, and posterior to the popliteus : at the lower edge of the popliteus, the popliteal artery divides into the Ante- rior and Posterior Tihial Arteries. BRANCH ES. 1. Two Perforating Arteries come off from the artery immediately after it has entered the ham;â€”they are small, and perforate from the ham to the fore-part of the thigh. 2. Articular Arteries are four or five small twigs, ramifying over the knee-joint and neighbour- ing muscles, inosculating with one another, and with the arteries below the knee. 3. Two branches are sent to the two heads of the gastrocnemii muscles; twigs are also given to the soleus, plantaris, &c. The Popliteal Vein receives branches corre- sponding to those of the arttry; it lies behind the artery in the erect posture. About two inches above the condyle, it receives the Vena Saphena Minor, which returns the blood from the outer side of the foot; the trunk ot this vein lies under the fascia. I CHAP. '

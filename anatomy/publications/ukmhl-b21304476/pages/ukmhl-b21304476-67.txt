( 4.1 ) From this ganglion, on each side, branches are sent across, which communicate intimately toge- ther, and form round the root of the cceliac artery, a very intimate plexus, containing several ganglia of various sizes, formerly called the Solar, but now more correctly the Cceliac Plexus. Nerves pass from this plexus, with the branches of the aorta, to the various viscera of the abdomen: in a common dissection these nerves cannot be clearly demonstrated, as they lie very close on the re- spective arteries, and are surrounded b}' much con- densed cellular substance; they form the hepatic, splenic, superior, and inferior mesenteric, renal, and spermatic plexuses. 3. The trunk of the intercostal nerve, the poste- rior intercostal, perforates the small muscle of the diaphragm close to the spine, runs down on the sides of the lumbar vertebrae, and along the upper edge of the psoas magnus. It terminates on the extremity of the os coccygis, by union with the nerve of the opposite side, in a ganglion named Ganglion Imp a n. In this course, it communi- cates with the lumbar nerves, and the various ab- dominal plexuses. The 1 horacic Duct may be seen passing from the abdomen into the thorax, between the aorta and the right crus oi the diaphragm. It is larger here than in its subsequent course, and the dilated portion is called rcceptaculum chyli, as the lacteals four in the chyle in this situation. * CHAP.

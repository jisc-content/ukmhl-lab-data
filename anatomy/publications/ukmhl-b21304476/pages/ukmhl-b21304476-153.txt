( 12t ) 3. A. F 4 into two with facility; and it is said that these two lamina1, by separating and re-uniting, form the trian- gular cavities, named Sinuses, which are in fact large veins. This division of layers can hardly be admitted as correct in the recent state of the membrane. The Superior Longitudinal Sinus lies in a groove formed by the two parietal bones; it extends along the sagittal suture from the crista galli of the ethmoid bone to the middle of the os occipit is, where it bifurcates into the two lateral sinuses ; in its pas- sage backwards, its size is increased. When slit open, its triangular form is evident; it is lined by a smooth membrane, and in it may lie remarked the numerous openings of the veins of the pia mater, the frena, or slips of fibres crossing from side to side, glandulae Pacchioni internae, et externae, little bodies like millet-seed seen on the outer and inner surface of the sinus. The arteries of the dura mater are divided into the anterior, middle, and posterior. 1. Arteria Meningea Media, (called also the Spinalis or Spheno-spinalis), the great middle ar- tery, is a branch of the internal maxillary ; it passes through the spinous hole of the sphenoid bone, and is seen arising from the anterior inferior angle of the parietal bone, (in a groove of which it lies,) and spreading its numerous branches over the dura mater. The anterior and posterior arteries are small. 2. A. Meningea Anterior is sent off from the external carotid, and enters the cranium by the fora- men facerum orbitale superius.

( 261 ) the muscle is immediately under the integuments, and so is the tendon where it passes over the elbow- joint. It is seen sinking between the supinator radii longus and pronator teres, to arrive at its point of insertion; and at the bend of the elbow, it sends olf from its inside an aponeurosis, which assists in form- ing the fascia of the fore arm. Use: To turn the hand supine, to bend the fore- arm on the arm, and the arm on the shoulder. Synonyma: Biceps brachii;—Biceps, sive Coraco- radialis;—Biceps internus :—Scapulo-coraco-radial. 8. The-CoRACO-BitACHiALis—Arises, tendinous and fleshy, from the middle part of the apex of the coracoid process of the scapula. Its fibres, as it de- scends, also arise from the edge of the short tendon of the biceps flexor cubiti. It forms a flat fleshy belly which is always perforated by the nerve, named Musculo-Cutaneus; Inserted, tendinous and fleshy, about the middle of the internal part of the os humeri, into a rough ridge. Situation: This muscle is much connected with the short head of the biceps flexor cubiti. It arises be- twixt that muscle and the origin of the pectoralis mi- nor. In the arm, it lies behind, and on the inside of the biceps, and is concealed by the pectoralis major and deltoides, excepting a small part of it which is seen projecting betwixt the biceps flexor and triceps extensor cubiti. It is inserted immediately below the tendons of the latissimus dorsi and teres major, and before the brachialis externus. The lower part of its

( 277 ) a tendinous expansion which is formed by the ten- dons of the common extensor, of the lumbricales, and interossei. This tendinous expansion terminates in the third or extreme phalanx. 5. The Extensor Carpi Ulnaris—Arises, tendinous, from the upper part of the external con- dyle; fleshy, from the intermuscular ligaments and inside of the fascia. It crosses towards the ulna, and- arises, fleshy, from the back-part of that bone. It terminates in a strong tendon, which passes through a groove in the back-part of the lower end of the- ulna, under the annular ligament, and is Inserted into the posterior and upper part of the metacarpal bone of the lit tle finger. Situation: This muscle is entirely superficial. It arises from the condyle betwixt the extensor digito- rum communis and anconeus. It descends along the fore-arm betwixt the extensor digitorum communis and flexor caqii ulnaris. Use: To extend the wrist, and bring the hand backwards ; but chiefly to bend the hand laterally towards the ulna, as it will appear by pulling its ten- don in the dissected subject. SynonymaUlnaris externus;—Epicondylo-cubi- to-sus-metacarpien. 6. The Anconeus is a small triangular muscle, situated at the outer side of the olecranon, imme- diately under the integuments. It arises, tendinous, from the posterior and lower part of the external condyle of the os humeri; forma a thick .triangular fleshy mass, adhering to the cap- sular ligament of the elbow joint, and is Inserted i

( * ) Annulus Abdomixalis, or Ring, an oblique slit er opening just above the angle of the pubis; formed by the tendon of the external oblique, divided into two portions called the pillars or columns of the ring, of which (the superior or internal) is attached to the symphysis, and the other (the inferior or external) to the angle of the pubis; and allowing a passage to the spermatic cord in the male, and the ligamentum teres of the uterus in the female. This slit is very impro- perly named a ring, since its figure is triangular; the pubis is the base, the two columns are the two sides'1 of the triangle. The apex has indeed a rounded figure in consequence of some transverse fibres, which connect the two columns where they first sepa- rate; and it points obliquely upwards and outwards. It belongs to the external oblique alone, there being no such opening, either in the internal oblique, or <â€¢ the transversalis; it is much smaller in the female than in the male. Ligamentum Inguinale, seu Poupartii, seu Pallopii, a strong ligament, stretching from the ante- rior superior spinous process of the os ilium, to be fixed to the spine of the os pubis. This in truth is merely the lower edge of the tendon of the obliquus externus abdominis, extended from the anterior su- perior spinous process of the ilium to the angle of the pubis, although in compliance with received notions, I have described it as a separate ligament. It cover* the femoral vessels and nerves, and certain muscles, and has lately been often described under the name of the Crural Arcii. It is also the same part as the posterior column of the abdominal ring. The student

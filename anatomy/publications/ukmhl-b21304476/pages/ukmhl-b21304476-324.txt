( 298 /) as a superficial nerve on the edge of the supinator Iengus. It runs over the outer condyle, and in dis- tributed to the integuments on the outside of the fore-arm, and back of the hand. (4.) The Radial (or Median) Nkrve accompa- nies the brachial artery to the bend of the elbow, and is contained in the same sheath as the artery. In its passage down the arm, it lies before that vessel, but at the elbow is situated on its inside. It gives off no branches until it has sunk under the aponeurotic ex- pansion of ihebicepsfiexor. Here it distributes many nerves to the muscles of the fore-arm, to the prona- tor teres, flexor carpi radialis, the flexors of the thumb and fingers, and the pronator quadratus. The trunk of the nerve perforates the pronator teres, passes betwixt the flexor digitorum sublimis and flexor profundus, and continues its course betwixt these muscles down to the wrist. Near the wrist it becomes more superficial, lying amongst the ten- dons of the flexors, and before it descends under the annular ligament, sends a superficial branch to the integuments and short muscles of the thumb. The nerve itself passes with the flexor tendons of the fin- gers under the annularligaraent of the wrist, emerges â€¢from these tendons, and appears on their outside, near the root of the thumb. It ramifies superficially in the hand, setting off four branches. The first branch passes to the thumb; tha second to the side of the fore-finger next the thumb; the third divides into two nerves, of which one passes to the inner side ofthe fore-finger; the fourth alsosubdiviclesinto two, to tlje inside of the middle finger, and outer side of the ring-finger. These nerves pass before the flexor tendons.

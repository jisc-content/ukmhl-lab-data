Situation: This pah- of muscles is seen on remov- ing the platysma myoides, between the sterno-cleido mastoidei. Use: To pull the os hyoides downwards. Synonyma : Sterno-hyoidien. 4. The Omo-Hyoiueus—Arises, broad, thin, and fleshy, from the root of the coracoid process, and semilunar notch of the scapula, ascends across the neck, and forms a middle tendon, where it passes be- low the sterno-cleido-mastoideus. Becoming fleshy again, it runs up, and is

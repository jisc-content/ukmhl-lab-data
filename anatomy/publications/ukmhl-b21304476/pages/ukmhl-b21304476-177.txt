The Veins pour their blood into the sinuses, which are numerous. None of these veins require particular attention, except the ophthalmic vein* which passes through the foramen lacerum orbitale Buperius. The principal sinuses, viz. the longitudi- nal, the two lateral, the inferior longitudinal, &c. have been described in the dissection of the brain. The remainder of these sinuses are situated in folds of the dura mater, but are not regular in their situa- tion. They transmit their blood to the longitudinal. and lateral sinuses, which terminate in forming the internal jugular veins.

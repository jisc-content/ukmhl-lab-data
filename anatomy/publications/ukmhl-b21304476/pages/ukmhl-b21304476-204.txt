( 178 ) The trunk of the right carotid and subclavian, ascends about an Inch, and bifurcates into, a, The right carotid, which ascends in the neck by the side of the trachea. b, The right subclavian, which passes outwards to the arm. 2. The left carotid. 3. The left subclavian comes off from the extre- mity of the arch. The arch of the aorta also gives off some small twigs which pass to the pleura, the mediastinum, and thymus. The Thymus is a soft glandular body, lying, be- fore the lower part of the trachea and great vessels of the heart, a little higher than the tops of the two pleurae. It is very large in the foetus, smaller in adults, and nearly disappears in the aged. Where the aorta begins to descend, it is connect- ed to the pulmonary artery by a ligament, which, in the foetus, was a large, canal, the Ductus Arte- riosus COURSE OF THE SUBCLAVIAN ARTERY ON EACH SIDE. The subclavian artery passes upwards and out- wards, runs under the clavicle, and over the middle of tliÂ£ first rib; it passes between the bellies of the anterior and middle rcaleni muscles, then runs under the arch of the pectoralis minor, and enters the axilla, where it assumes the name of Axillary Artery.

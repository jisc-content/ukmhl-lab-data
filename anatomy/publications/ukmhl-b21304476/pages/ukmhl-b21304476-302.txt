The Extensor Digitok'um Communis— Arises, tendinous, from the under part of the exter- nal condyle of the os humeri; fleshy, from the inter- muscular ligaments which connect it to the extensor carpi radialis brevior before, and the extensor carpi ulnuris behind, and from the inner surface of the fascia. It descends along the back-part of the fore- arm, ajul adheres to the ulna where it passes over it. The fleshy belly terminates in- four flat tendons, which pass under the annular ligament in a degres- sion on the back-part of the radius, and are Insn'ted into the posterior part of all the bones of the fingers by a tendinous expansion. Situation : It arises betwixt the extensor radialis brevior and the extensor carpi ulnaris. It descends betwixt these muscles, and is situated immediately under the integuments. The tendons are connected on the back of the metacarpal bone, by cross slips.— The inner part of this muscle is sometimes described as a separate muscle, and is called Extensor Pro- prius Minimi Digit!, vel Auricularis. It passes through a separate depression of the radius, and a particular ring of the annular ligament Use: To extencf all the joints of the fingers. Synonyma: Epicondylo-sus-phalangcttien com- mon.

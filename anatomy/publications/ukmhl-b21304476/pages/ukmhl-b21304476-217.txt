( 101 ) the oesophagus, named A. (Esophagear; others run to the pericardium and pleura. The dissector also finds in the posterior mediasti- num the Tiiohacic Duct. He must look for it behind the oesophagus, betwixt the vena azygos and aorta ; it is collapsed, and appears like cellular mem- brane condensed, and can only be distinguished when inflated or injected ; it was seen in the abdomen close to the aorta, and passing into the thorax between the crura of the diaphragm. It . ascends along the posterior mediastinum, and, about the fourth dorsal vertebra, passes obliquely to the left side, behind the aorta descendens, and behind the great arch of the aorta, until it reaches the left carotid artery. It runs behind this artery, and behind the left internal jugu- lar vein ; and, after forming a circular turn or arch, (the convexity of which is turned upwards,) it de- scends and enters the left subclavian vein at the point where that vein is joined by the left internal jugular. In its course along the spine, the thoracic duct frequently splits into two branches, which re- unite. The absorbents of the right superior extre- mity, and of the right side of the head and thorax, usually form a trunk, which enters the right sub- clavian vein. The (Esophagus is also situated betwixt the lay- ers of the posterior mediastinum. It lies immediately before the aorta, but rather towards its left side ; it is seen descending from the neck behind the trachea ; it passes through an opening in the Ifcsser muscle of the diaphragm, and immediately expands into the stomach. 8 Behind

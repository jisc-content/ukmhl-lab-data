( 14-1 ) stance, leading from the inferior and anterior ex- tremity of the third ventricle to the pituitary gland; it is generally imperforate before it reaches the gland. The Pituitary Gland, a reddish body some- what globular, consisting of two lobes, is situated in the sella Turcica of the sphenoid bone, partly co- vered by a fold of dura mater, and attached to the in- fundibulum. The circular sinus is situated at this point. O n detaching the cerebrum from the back-par t of the sella Turcica, the tunica arachnoides is very evident. 3. The Third Pair of Nerves, Motor.es Oculorum, arise from the crura cerebri *, pass out- wards and forwards on the outer side of the posterior clinoid process into the cavernous sinus, and run through the foramen lacerum orbitale superius to the muscles of the eye. Between these two nerves are seen the two verte- bral arteries, ascending and uniting, to form the ba- silary artery. 4. The Fourth Pair, Trochlea res or Pa- thetic!, are very slender, and situated immediately under the edge of the tentorium. This nerve arises from the valvula cerebri, comes out from betwixt the cerebrum and cerebellum, passes by the side of the pons Varolii, and, passing through the cavernous sinus, continues its course through the foramen lace- rum orbitale superius, to supply the obliquus supe- rior muscle of the eye. * The two crura pass obliquely backwards and inwards, so as to converge and meet' in front of the tuber annulare ; it i* from the hollow formed by their convergence, and named by Vicq d’Azyr, fosse dcs nerfroculo-mwculaiTCS that the third pair arise, 5.

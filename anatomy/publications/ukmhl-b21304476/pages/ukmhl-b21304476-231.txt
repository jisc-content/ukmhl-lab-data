( 205 ) of this muscle is superficial. Below, it is covered by the platysma myoides; and above, a small portion of it is concealed by the origin of the zygomaticus major. Use: To pull the lower to the upper jaw, and to move it forwards and backwards. Synonyma: Zygomato-maxillaire. 2. Temporalisâ€”Arises, fleshy, from a semicir- ' cular ridge in the lower and lateral part of the pa- rietal bone, from all the squamous portion of the temporal bone, from the external angular process of the os frontis, from the temporal process of the sphenoid bone, and from an aponeurosis which co- vers the muscle. From these 'different origins'the fibres converge, descend under the bony jugum formed by the zygomatic processes of the temporal and cheek bones. Inserted, by a strong tendon, into the upper part of the coronoid process of the lower jaw, to which it adheres on every side, but more particularly its fore- part, where the insertion is continued down to near the last dens molaris. Situation: This muscle is of a semicircular shape. It is covered by a fascia or aponeurosis. This fascia adheres to the bones which give oiigin to the upper part of the muscle, and, descending over it, is in- serted into thejugum, and adjoining part of the os mala; and os frontis. The temporalis, at its origin, lies under the expanded tendon of the occipito-frontalis, and under the small tendons which move the exter- nal ear. its insertion is concealed by the jugum and 8 by

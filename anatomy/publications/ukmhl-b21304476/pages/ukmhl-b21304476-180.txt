and anterior part of the clavicle. These two origins soon unite, and form a strong muscle, which ascends obliquely upwards and outwards, to be Inserted, tendinous, into the outside of the mas- toid process, and into the transverse ridge behind that process. Use: When one acts singly, it turns the head to one side. When both act together, they bend the head forwards. Synonyma : Sterno-mastoideus et cleido-mastoi- deus ;—Mastoideus;—Sterno-clavio mastoidien. The muscle should be detached from the sternum and clavicle, and left suspended by its insertion. It is pierced by several branches of the cervical nerves, and, about its middle, it is perforated by the Nervus Accessorius. These nerves ramify on the neighbour- ing muscles of the neck and shoulder. Between the posterior edge of the sterno-cleido-mastoideus and the fore-part of the trapezius muscles, is Seen a quan- tity of loose fatty substance, intermixed with branches of nerves. This fatty substance is watery and granu- lated ; it must not be removed roughly, lest import- ant nerves and vessels be injured; it is continued around the vessels under the clavicle. In the middle of the throat you see, (1.) The Os Hyoides, or bone of the tongue, forming the uppermost of the projections beneath the chin. (2.) The Larynx, or upper part of the trachea, consisting of five cartilages, of which two are evident externally, viz, 1. The uppermost and largest is the thyroid

( 237 ) The * the four or five superior cervical vertebrae, by dis- tinct tendons, which lie behind similar tendons of the levator scapula'1. Situation : This muscle is concealed by the ser- ratus superior posticus, and splenius capitis. Use: To bring the head and upper vertebrae of the neck obliquely backwards. When both muscles act, they pull the head directly backwards. Synonyma : Cervici-dorsi-mastoidien, et dorso- trachelien. Reflect it from the dorsal vertebrae. 8. The Serratus Posticus Inferiorâ€”Arises, by a broad thin tendon, from the spinous processes of the two or three inferior dorsal vertebrae, and from the three superior lumbar spines by the fascia lumborum. Inserted, by distinct fleshy slips, into the lower edaes of the four inferior ribs, at a little distance from their cartilages. Situation: This is a thin muscle, of considerable breadth, situated at the lower part of the back, un- der the middle of the Jatissimus dorsi. Its tendon lies under that of the latissiraus dorsi, but, although firmly adhering to it, is distinct, and may be separa- ted by cautious dissection. Its insertion into the ribs is situated immediately behind the attachments con- necting the latissimus dorsi to the ribs, which attach- ments must therefore lie behind the obliquus exter- nus abdominis, and serratus posticus inferior. Use : To pull the ribs downwards and backwards. Synonyma : Dorso-lumbo-costal. Reflect it from the spine.

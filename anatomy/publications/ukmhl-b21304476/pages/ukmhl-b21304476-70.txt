( ** ) and lower part of the CoRrus Spongiosum of the Urethra. The Sphincter Ani, encircling the anus. The Transversus Peuinei, crossing the peri- neum transversety. 1. The Erector Penis—Arises, tendinous and fleshy, from the tuberosity of the os ischium; its fleshy fibres proceed upwards over the crus of the penis, adhering to the outer and inner edges of the ascending ramus of the os ischium, and of the de- scending ramus of the os pubis;—but before the two crura meet to form the body of the penis, it ends in a flat tendon, which is lost in the strong tendinous membrane that covers the corpus cavernosum. Sit nation : This muscle covers all the surface of the crus penis that is not in contact with bone; it arises on each side of the attachment of the crus to the bone. Use : It was formerly supposed to compress the crus penis, and thereby to propel the blood into the fore-part of the corpus cavernosum; and to press the penis upwards against the pubis. But its obvious effect must be that of drawing the crus downwards to the tuber ischii; which cannot have any influ- ence in contributing to the erect state of the organ. Synoni/bia: Ischio-cavernosus;—Ischio-caverneux. 2. The Accelerator Uhin.e—Arises, by a thin tendinous expansion, from the descending ramus of the pubis, and from the ascending ramus of the is- chium, nearly as far down as the tuber;—this origin lies under the crus of the penis, and the fleshy fibres are seen coming out from the angle between the crus and

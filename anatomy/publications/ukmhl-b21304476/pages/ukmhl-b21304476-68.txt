( 42 ) The chap. ii. DISSECTION. OF TIIE PERINEUM, AND OF THE MALE ORGANS OF GENERATION *. 'JjHIE muscles and vessels to be demonstrated, He deep amongst much loose cellular substance; and unless great caution is used, important parts will be removed, while the student supposes he is only clearing away cellular substance :—The rectum having been cleansed, a little baked hair may be in- troduced into its extremity, which will keep the anus gently protruding during the dissection ; or a cork, with a loop attached to it, may be intro- duced, arid the mouth of the gut tied upon it;— this last method is preferable, as the intestine can then be turned in every direction :—The dissection will also be facilitated by introducing a staff into the bladder, in order to mark out the situation of the urethra; the subject should be placed in the same position as for the lateral operation of litho- tomy. * This dissection will be more complete, if die pelvis and lower extremities arc injected ; for thus the important branches of the pudic artery will be more easily traced. *

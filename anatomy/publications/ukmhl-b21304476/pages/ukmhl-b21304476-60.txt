C 34 ) tebra, it bifurcates into the two primitive or common iliac arteries. Branches of the Abdominal Aorta. 1. The two Phrenic Arteries arise from the Aorta, before it has fairly entered into the abdomen, and ramify over the diaphragm; sometimes they come off in one trunk, which bifurcates; sometimes one of them arises from the cceliac. c2. The Cceliac Artery comes off at thepoint where tjie aorta has fairly extricated itself from the dia- phragm; it is a single, large, but short trunk situated between the inferior surface of the liver, and the small curvature of the stomach, and surrounded b)r the ifceshes of the semilunar ganglion. It divides at once into three branches; and as they depart in dif- ferent directions from one point, as from a centre, the trunk is called the Axis A uterine Cceliac.e. (1.) A. Coronakia Ventriculi, the middle branch, is thesmallest of the three; it passes.from the axis towards the left side, and arriving at the cardiac orifice of the stomach, where it attaches itself to that organ, sends abranch round the cardia, named Ramus CnronariceDexlcr. The trunk itself is then continued along the lessor curvature from left to right, to inos- culate with the pylorica or coronaria dextra: it sends off branches to the little epiploon, &c. It sometimes terminates in the liver, entering at the portae, and then it is the largest of the branches of the cceliac. In this case, the trunk, after ascending towards the left to reach the cardia, is reflected to the right, in

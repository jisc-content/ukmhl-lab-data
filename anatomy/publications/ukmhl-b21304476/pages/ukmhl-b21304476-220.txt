( 194 ) left, auricle;—observe that it is thin, that in it there is an oval depression, named Fossa Ovalis, Round this fossa the fibres are thicker, forming the annulus ovalis; this is the remains of the Foramen Ovale of the foetus ; and in many adult subjects a probe may be passed through the superior part of the fossa obliquely into the left auricle. The Valvula Nonilis, or Eustachian Valve, is a membranelike duplicature of the inner coat of the auricle, observed where the vena cava inferior is continued into the auricle, and stretching from that vein towards the opening into the right -ventricle. This valve is sometimes found reticulated. Behind this valve is f the orifice of the Coronary Vein, with its small, valve. The Foramina Thebcsii are minute orifices of veins, which open into all the cavities of the heart; they are most numerous, however, in the right au- ricle. The Ostium Venosum, or opening* of the right auricle into the right ventricle, is somewhat oval; it has a valve which projects into the right ventricle. The Rioiit Ventricle may now be opened by • an incision, carried from the root of the pulmonary artpry down to the apex of the heart. This incision should be made with care, lest the parts on the in- side of the ventricle be destroyed by it; it should pass along the right side of the septum yentricu- lorum, the situation of which is marked out by large branches of the coronary artery and vein. A small opening should first be made, into which one blade of the scissars can be introduced ,; the incision may be 5

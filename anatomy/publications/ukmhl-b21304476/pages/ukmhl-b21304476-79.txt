( S3 ) the branch of the internal iliac, which is more im* mediately destined to supply the parts of generation* perineum, and lower part of the rectum: it goes out of the pelvis above the superior sacro-sciatic ligament, twists round it, and re-enters the pelvis above and ' before the inferior sacro-sciatic ligament: it then descends on the inskleof the tuber ischii, ascends on the inner surface of the rami of the ischium and pubis; and, reaching the root of the penis, divides into two branches. (1.) A. Perinei, a branch which, after giving twigs to the bulb of the urethra and neighbouring muscles, enters the crus of the penis, and subdivides into branches which pass to both extremities of the crus. (2.) A. Dorsalis Penis, passes under the arch of the pubis, runs along the dorsum penis, and is distributed to the integuments. In its course the pudic artery gives off many branches. (1.) While in the pelvis, it gives twigs to the bladder, prostate and rectum. (2.) A. FLemoiirhoidales Extern.Â® come from the pudic while passing by the anus. (3.) A Transveiisa Perinei, following the course of the transversus perinei muscle. G. A. Obturatrix descends on the inside of the psoas muscle, passes through the foramen in the ob- turator ligament to the muscles on the inside of the thigh. 7- A. Hypogastrica, which in the fcetus sends off the umbilical artery, is in the adult continued only C 3 to \

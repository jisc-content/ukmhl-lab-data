( 179 ) The order in which the following arteries are sent off from the subclavian varies much ; sometimes they come off singly, at other times in large trunks, which subdivide. Backwards the subclavian sends off, 1. The Vertebral Akjeryâ€”This artery arises from the back-part of the subclavian, passes out- wards and enters the foramen in the transverse pro- cess of the last cervical vertebra, and ascends through the transverse processes of the vertebrae, to enter the foramen magnum of the occipital bone. 2. The Inferior Thyroid Artery ascends obliquely inwards, passes behind the internal jugular vein, to ramify on the thyroid gland, where it inos- culates largely with the superior thyroid arteries. Branches from this artery pass to the trachea and oesophagus, to the muscles of the neck, and of the scapula : one of these is the supra scapulary artery, (see the account of the branches of the axillary artery.) 2. A. Cervicalis Anterior, vel Profunda, passes deep to the muscles situated on the fore-part of the cervical vertebra;, and ascends as high as the base of the skull. 4. A. Cervicalis Posterior, vel Superficialis, is larger than the last; it ascends obliquely out- wards, generally passes betwixt the transverse pro- cesses of the last cervical and first dorsal vertebrae* and ascends on the back-part of the neck, deeply seated; some of its branches pass down the back superficially. Anteriorly, the subclavian artery gives off, II G 5. A. JNIam- v

( 209 ) the external nasal arteries to the outside of the nose, and the A. Buccales to the cheek. The External Carotid is found ascending behind the parotid gland. It perforates the gland at its up- per part, ascends over the zygomatic process imme- diately before the ear, and divides into the anterior, middle, and posterior temporal arteries,which ramify over the side of the head, giving also branches to the forehead and occiput. But the carotid, while its lies imbedded under the parotid, sends several twigs to the substance of that gland, and a considerable artery which passes for- wards, and, ramifying on the sidg of the face, is named A. Transvf.rsalis Faciei. At this point also, the carotid sends off a large artery, the A. Maxillauis Interna. As many branches of this artery are met with in the dissection of the face, it is proper to give a view of its distribution. The internal Maxillary passes behind the condy- loid process of the lower jaw ; it directs its course towards the bottom of the orbit of the eye; and it is at this point that it sends off its numerous branches. (1.) Ahtei(ia Media Durje Mathis (or Menin- gea spheno-spinalis or spinosa), passes through the spinal hole of the sphenoid bone into the cranium, and is distributed to the dura mater. (2.) A. Max- iLLARts Inferior, vel Dentalis Inferior,runs down- wards, enters the foramen at the root of the ascend- ing processes of the lower jaw ; then passes through the canal of the lower jaw, supplying the teeth and sockets, and emerges by the foramen mentale, to be distributed to the chin. It is accompanied by a nerve

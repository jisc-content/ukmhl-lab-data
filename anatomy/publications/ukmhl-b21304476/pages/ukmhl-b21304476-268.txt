( 242 ) even superior dorsal, and of the four »r live inferior cervical vertebrae. It forms a thick, tendinous, and fleshy belly. Inserted, tendinous and fleshy, into the hollow be- twixt the two transverse ridges of the os occipitis, extending from the middleprotuberanceof that bone, nearly as far as the mastoid process. Sihtntion; This is a large muscle. Its origin from the cervical vertebrae is nearer to the spine than the trachelo mastoideus, and it arises in the back nearer to the spine than the transversalis colli; it is covered by the splenius ; but a large portion of it is seen between the splenius and spine, immediately on re- moving the trapezius. Use: To draw the head backwards, and to oneside. Synonyma: Complexus, seu Biventer cervicis;— Complexus majorDorso-trachelo-occipital. On removing the complexus from the occiput, we find, close to the spine, Hi. The Semi-Spin a ns Colli.—It arises, by distinct tendons, from the transverse processes of the six superior dorsal ■vertebra', ascends obliquely close to the spine, and is Inserted into the spinous processes of all the ver- tebra: of the neck, except the first and the last. Situation: This muscle is situated close to the ver- tebrae at the posterior part of the neck and back. It arises on the outside of the semi-spinalis dorsi; its greater part is concealed by the complexus and lon- gissimus dorsi; and the part which projects between these muscles, is concealed by the serratus superior posticus.

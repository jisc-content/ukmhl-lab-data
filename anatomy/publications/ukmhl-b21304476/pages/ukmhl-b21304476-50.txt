(1.) Small Intestine;â€”about four times, the length of the body. a. The Duodenum is broader than any other part of the small intestine, but is short: it takes a turn from the pylorus upwards, and to the right side, passing under the liver and gall-bladder; then, turning upon itself, it descends, passing as low as the right kidney; it is in this space that it receives the pancreatic and gall ducts; thence it crosses before the renal vessels, before the aorta, and upon tin? last vertebra of the back, firmly bound down by the peritoneum, which covers only its anterior surface; it then ascends from right to left, till it is lost under the root of the mesocolon. Turning back the colon and omentum, fixing them over the brim of the thorax, and pushing down the small intestines towards the pelvis, you find the duodenum coming out from under the me- socolon, but still tied close to the spine; it termi- nates in the jejunum, exactly where the mesentery begins. The intestine in this course forms nearly a circle, the root of the mesocolon being the only part lying between its two extremities. You have now to trace the rest of the small in- testine, which lies convoluted in the umbilical and hypogastric regions. b, Jejunum constitutes the first or upper half of the remaining small intestine, and is situated more in the upper part of the abdomen ; it is redder, and its coats feel thicker to the touch, from the greater number of the valvulae conniventes on its inner surface ; its diameter exceeds that of the ilium.

( 37 ) side, makes a large inosculation with the colica dextra, while the left branch makes an opposite sweep, and joins the colica sinistra, which is a branch of the inferior mesenteric. Often there are only two branches instead of these three ; viz. ileo-colica and colica dextra ; then the c. media is a branch of the latter. Frequently too there is only one branch, called colica dextra, and dividing after its origin into the three above named. The left side or convexity of the arch of the superior mesenteric sends oft' from sixteen or twenty branches, which, after forming frequent anastomoses and arches, proceed to the small intestines. 4. The Renal or Emulgent Arteries are two in number. Each artery arising, below the supe- rior mesenteric, from the side of the aorta, passes to the kidney, and after having given twigs to the renal capsule and adipose membrane, enters the v lesser arch of the kidney. The right artery is longer than the left, and passes behind the vena sava ascendens. 5. The Spermatic Arteries are also two; they come off about an inch below the emulgent from the fore-part of the aorta. Each artery descends behind the peritoneum, giving twigs to the parts in its course, and accompanied by the spermatic vein and nerves. It then passes through the abdominal ring, and enters the upper part of the testicle in five or six branches. In the female it supplies the ovaria and fundus uteri. 6. The Inferior Mesenteric is a single trunk, which comes off rather from the left side of the aorta,

( ICO ) middle tendinous line which extends From the os hy- oides to the chin ; its posterior part is lined by the internal membrane of the mouth ; it lies under the digastricus, but is seen betwixt its bellies. Use: To pull the os hyoides forwards, upwards, and to either side. Synonyma: Mylo-hyoidien. The submaxillary gland sends off a duct, which passes behind the posterior edge of the mylo-hyoi- deus, and runs along the inner surface of this mus- cle forwards and upwards, on the inside of the sub- lingual gland, to open into the mouth on the side of the frenum of the tongue. The Sublingual Gland lies immediately above the mylo-hyoideus, betwixt it and the internal mem- brane of the mouth, where it lines the side and in- ferior surface of the tongue. It sends off several ducts, which open into the mouth between the root of the tongue and side of the lower jaw. The removal of the mylo-hyoideus exposes a pair of muscles, which are closely attached to one ano- ther. 13. The Genio-IIyoideus—Arises, tendinous, from a projection on the inside of that part of the lower jaw which is called the Chin;—it descends, becoming broader, and is Inserted into the basis of the os hyoides. Use: To draw the os hyoides forwards and up- wards to the chin. Synonyma : Genio-hyoidien. By removing this muscle, or turning it back from its origin from the jaw, we discover the next muscle. 14.

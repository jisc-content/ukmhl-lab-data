• Mi dyle. ( ^3- > Inserted into the lower and anterior part of the radius. ■> Situation : This muscle lies close to the bonesr covered by the flexor tongus pollicisrand flexor digi- torum sublimis. Use: To turn the radius, together with, the hand* inwards. Synonyma: Cubito-radial. MUSCLES SITUATED ON THE OUTER AND BACK PART OF THE FORE-ARM, AND ARISING FROM THE OUTER CONDYLE OF THE OS HUMERI. These muscles are eleven in number, and may be divided into two classes: 1. The Superficial; and, 2. The Deep-seated. THE SUPERFICIAL. The muscles which arise from the outer condyle are much more distinct in their origins than those which arise from the inner condyle. Several of them arise a considerable way up the os humeri; but there is- here also a common tendinous origin, from which, the extensor carpi radialis brevior, extensor digito- rum communis,and extensor carpi radialis, proceed.; so that these muscles are intimately connected. 1. Supinator Radii Longus—Arises, tendi- nous and fleshy, from the external ridge of the os humeri which leads to the outer condyle. It'begins to arise nearly as far up as the middle of the bone, and ceases to adhere about two inches above the edn-

C 107 } the inside of the insertion of the tcndo Aehillis, and somewhat before it. Situation : The origin and belly of this muscle are concealed by the external head of the gastrocnemius* the lower part of the tendon is the only part that is superficial. Use: To extend the foot, and roll it inwards, and to assist in bending the leg. Synonyma: Tibialis gracilis; Extensor tarsi mi- nor :—Petit fcrqoro-calcanien. 4. The Popliteus — Arises, within the capsular ligament of the knee, by a round tendon, from a deep pit or hollow on the outer side oT the external con- dyle ; adheres to the posterior and outer surface of the external semilunar cartilage; passes, within the cavity of the joint, over the side of the condyle to its back-part; perforates the capsular ligament, and forms a fleshy belly, which runs obliquely inwards, being covered by a thin tendinous fascia, to be Inserted, broad, thin, and fleshy, into an oblique ridge on the posterior surface of the tibia, a little below its head, and into the triangular space above that ridge. Situation: This muscle is concealed entirely by the gastrocnemius; it lies above the inner head of the soleus; it is more deeply situated than the plantaris, which crosses over it. Use: To bend the leg, and, when bent, to roll it,, so as to turn the toes inwards. Synonyma: Femoro-popliti-tibial. The belly of the soleus should now be lifted, in order to expose the deeply-seated muscles. A strong E 6 membranous

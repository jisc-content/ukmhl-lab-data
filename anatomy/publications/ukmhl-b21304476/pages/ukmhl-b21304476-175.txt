( 149 ) « *f * greatest nerve of the body, passes out irom the .back- part of the pelvis, through the saero-sciatic notch, and takes its course along the back of the thigh, to ' supply the thigh, leg, and foot; it is formed from the two last nerves of the loins and three first of the sacrum. All these nerves of the spine communicate freely by numerous twigs, and by the intervention oi The Great Sympathetic Nerve,or Inter- costal This nerve, originally derived from the sixth pair, and from some filaments of the fifth, passes out of the cranium with the carotid artery. It then descends through the neck, and forms three ganglions in its course, which give twigs to the neigh- bouring parts, and are joined by filaments from the cervical nerves, and the eighth and ninth pairs. The intercostal then enters the thorax, and descends by the side of the vertebrae, behind the pleura, giv- ing filaments, which, joining with twigs of the eighth pair, form several plexuses to supply the heart, lungs, &c. In the abdomen it descends on the lumbar vertebrae, and at last terminates in the pelvis on the extremity of the coccyx. While in the thorax, it gives off a branch, which uniting with brandies of the dorsal nerves, forms The A N T ERIOR IN T E RCOST A L, or Sp L A N CHN XC Nerve.—This nerve, passing betwixt the crura of the diaphragm, enters the abdomen, from the semi- lunar ganglion, and is distributed by numerous plex- uses to all the abdominal viscera. The eighth pair, or par vagum, has also a very long course; it arises in the head, passes through G 3 the

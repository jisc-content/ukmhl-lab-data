(' 137 ) a thin medullary lamina, which is the valvula Vieus- senii, processus a cerebello ad testes, velum inter- jectum, valvula major. The inferior cornu of the lateral ventricle, whicfy descends into the middle lobe of the brain, may now be traced, by following the tract of the choroid pluxus * ; in it is seen, The Hippocampus Major, or Cornu Ammonis. At its commencement it is narrow, but it becomes a broad medullary projection of the floor of the ven- tricle, and its extremity, which is called Pes Hippo- campi, is curved inwards. The thin edge on its in- side, which follows the whole of its circuit, is named the Corpus Fimbriatum, or Taenia Hippocampi. The posterior crus of the fornix runs along its inner and anterior part, in the form of a thin floating edge. In the posterior cornu of the lateral ventricle, which passes into the posterior lobe of the brain, there is a similar medullary projection, but smaller, the Hippocampus NOR. In the anterior part of the third ventricle, below the iter ad infundibulum, are seen the Corpora Ai.hicantia Willisii, (corpora mamillaria or sub- rotunda) two medullary eminences of the size of peas; the remainder of these bodies is seen on the outer surface of the base of the brain. This completes die demonstration of the cerebrum. The whole of the posterior lobes, and the lateral part cf the middle lobes, maybe removed.

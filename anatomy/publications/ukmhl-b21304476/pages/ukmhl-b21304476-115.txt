VESSELS ANT) NERVKS ON THE POSTE- RIOR PART OF THE THIGH. ARTERIES. 1. A uteri a Glutea, or Iliaca Posterior—• This is the largest branch of the internal iliac artery; it passes out of the pelvis at the upper part of the sciatic notch. On raising the gluteus rraximus, and medius, this artery is seen coming over the py- riformis ; betwixt the superior edge of that muscle and the inferior edge of the os ileum, (where that hone forms the upper part of the sciatic notch), and immediately behind the posterior fibres of the gluteus minimus. The principal trunk passes under the gluteus medius, and ramifies on the dorsum of the os ileum; other large branches are also continued to the gluteus maxiraus, and the muscles situated on the back part of the pelvis. 2. Arteria Sciatica, vel Isciiiatica, is another large branch of the internal iliac, which comes out from

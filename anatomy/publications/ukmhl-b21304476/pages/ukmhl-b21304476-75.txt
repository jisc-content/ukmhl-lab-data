4. The Corpus Spongiosum Urethr.c consists of a plexus of minute veins covered externally bv a thin but uniform tendinous sheet; it surrounds the urethra from a short distance from the bladder to its extremity: at it beginning, it forms a consi- derable body of a pyriform shape, termed the Bulb of the Urethra; that part of the bulb which is below the urethra, is named the pendulous part of the bulb. The corpus spongiosum is expanded at its anterior extremity, to form the glans penis. 5. The Glandule ANTEPRosTAT.®,or Cowper’s Glands, are two sjnall glands of the size of peas, situated immediately before the prostate, and between the membranous part and bulb of the urethra. 6. The Vesicul.t. Seminales are two soft, whitish, knotted bodies, about three or four fingers- breadth in length, and one in breadth, and about three times as broad as thick ; Situated between the rectum and lower part of the bladder obliquely, so that their inferior extremities are contiguous, and are affixed to the base of the prostate gland, while their superior extremities are at a distance from each other, extending outwards and upwards, and termi- nating just on the inside of the insertion of the ure- ters in the bladder. 7. The two Vasa Dkfkrentia are seen running betwixt the vesiculse seminales, and united to them and to the base of the prostate. Observe that part of the bladder, left between these tubes, and con- nected by cellular substance to the rectum, which is pierced when the bladder is punctured from the latter part.

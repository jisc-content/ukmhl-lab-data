( 78 ) named Pudicae Externa-. 2. Muscularis interna. 3. Muscularis externa. 4. Profunda. The Obturator Artery, arteria obturatrix, which is a branch of the internal iliac artery, passos through the notch at the upper part of the foramen 1 thyroideum, and ramifies on the deep-seated muscles at the upper and inner part of the thigh. 2. VEINS. The Femoral Vein adheres closely to the femo- ral artery in its passage out of (die abdomen, and ac- companies it in its course down the thigh, where it passes under Poupart’s ligament; it lies on the inside of the artery, but, as it descends, it turns more and more posteriorly, so that where they perforate the tendon of the adductor magnus, Ihe vein is situated fairly behind the artery. Its branches correspond to those of the femoral artery ; but about an inch below Poupart’s ligament* it receives the vena saphena major, to which there is no corresponding artery. The Obturator Vein accompanies the obtura- tor artery, and has the same distribution. 3. NERVES. Nertus Cruralis Anterior, or the Anterior Crural nerve, where it passes from under Poupart’s ligament, lies about half an inch on the outside ol the femoral artery; it immediately divides into a number of branches, which supply the muscles and integuments

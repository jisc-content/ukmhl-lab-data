( 163 ) 5. The TARSALand Metatarsal Arteries arc- two small branches which cross the tarsal and meta- tarsal bones, and pass obliquely to the outer edge of the foot. From the tarsal or metatarsal artery come off the Interosseal Arteries, which supply the interos- seal spaces, and the back-part of the toes. G. A large brancli comes off from the anterior tibial, -where it is about to plunge into the sole of the foot; it runs along the space betwixt the two first metatarsal bones, and that the anterior extremity of those bones, bifurcates into, (1.) A. Dorsalis Hallucis, a considerable branch which runs on the back-part of the great toe. (2.) A branch which runs on the inner edge of the toe next to the great one. 2. VEINS. The Anterior Tibial Vein consists of two branches, which accompany the artery and its nulli- fications. 3. NERVES. The Anterior Tibial Nerve is a branch of the peroneal nerve; it is seen in the ham arising from the peroneal, and crossing under the muscles on the outside of the fibula:â€”It emerges from under the extensor longus digitorufn, comes in contact with the anterior tibial artery, and accompanies it down tile leg; it is distributed cn the back of the foot and toes.

( 292 ) the muscular or spiral nerve. It passes betwixt the brachialis externus and short head of the triceps ex- tensor cubiti. Here it lies deep among the muscles, and divides into two branches. One accompanying the nerve spreads its ramifications over the outer con- dyle, and anastomoses with the arteries below the elbow. The other branch is distributed along the inside of the arm, and about the inner condyle. 2. A. Profunda Humeri Inferior, vel Mi- nor, or Muscular is Inferior, is smaller than the last, and is sent off from the brachial artery about two inches lower down. It descends among the muscles on the inside of the arm, and is lost about the inner condyle. 3. The anastomosing or collateral arteries are as follow: (1.) The Ramus Anastomoticus Major passes from the inside of the brachial artery, about two or three inches above the inner condyle. It is distributed about the condyle ; and its principal branch accom- panies the ulnar nerve in the groove betwixt the ole- cranon and inner condyle, to anastomose with the recurrent branches of the arteries of the fore-arm. (2.) There are two or three more anastomosing branches, which are sent off from the brachial artery, and ramify over the artcrior and posterior surface* of the two condyles. 4. Small branches to the muscles of the arm. The Brachial Artery, where it lies deep under the aponeurosis of the biceps, divides into three branches. 1. The radial; 2. The ulnar; aud, 3. The interosseous artery. The two last generally come off by one trunk, which subdivides. 1. Artf.ria

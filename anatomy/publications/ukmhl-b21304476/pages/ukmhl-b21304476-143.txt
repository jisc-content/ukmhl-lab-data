( 117 ) proceeding between the two sesamoid bones to the base of the last phalanx of the great toe. 3. Flexor Dioitokum Accessorius, or Maxsa Carnea Jacobi Sylvii—Arises, fleshy, from the si- nuosity at the inside of the os calcis, and, tendinous, from that bone more outwardly:—-'it forms a belly of a square form. Inserted into the outside of the tendon of the flexor digitorutn longus, just at its division. Use: To assist the flexor longus. 4. Lumrricales Pedis—Arise, by four tendinous and fleshy beginnings, from the tendons of the flexor longus digitorum, immediately after their division. Inserted, by four slender tendons, into the inside of the first phalanx of the four lesser toes, and into the tendinous expansion that is sent from the ex- tensors to cover the upper part of the toes. Use : To promote the flexion of the toes, and to draw them inwards. Situation: Tl>e muscles of the second order are covered and concealed by those of the first order; but the insertion of their tendinous extremities may be seen on removing the integuments. The second order of muscles being removed, we expose the third order. 1. Flexor Brevis Pollicis Pedis.—It arises, tendinous, from the under and fore part of the os calcis, where it joins with the os euboides; also from the os cuneiforme externum ; it forms a fleshy belly, which is connected inseparably to the ab- ductor and adductor pollicis. Inserted, by two tendons, into the external and 2 internal

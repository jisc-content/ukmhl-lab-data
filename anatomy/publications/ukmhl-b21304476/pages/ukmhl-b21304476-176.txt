( 150 ) the neck, to which it gives several branches, ft enters the thorax anterior to the subclavian artery s here it gives oh' a remarkable branch, called the Recurrent, becaitse it is reflected round the arch of the aorta on the left side, and round the subclavian artery on the right, and ascends to be distributed on the trachea, oesophagus, and larynx. The nerve then passes through the thorax, and, entering the abdomen, terminates in the stomach ; in this course it has frequent communications with the great sym- pathetic, which it assists in forming the different plexuses that supply the thoracic and abdominal viscera. It is distributed to the heart, lungs, liver., spleen, stomach, and duodenum. OF THE VESSELS OF THE BRAIN. The arteries ramify largely on the pJa mater, be- skull fore they enter the substance of the brain ; they come from two large branches. * 1. The Internal Carotid Artery enters the skull by a winding course through the foramen caroticum of the temporal bone. After passing through the cavernous sinus, it divides into three branches: 1. Anterior cerebri, passing between the two anterior lobes; 2. Media cerebri, entering the fissura sylvii; 3. llamus communicans, uniting with the basilar. The carotid, while in the cavernous sinus gives of the arteria ophthalrrica, which passes through the foramen opticum to the eye and its appendages. 2. The Vertebral Artery arises from the subclavian, ascends through the foramina in the transverse

( 257 ) pczius passing into the spine o^he scapula; and its tendon passes under the deltouk Use : To raise the arm. Synonyma: Super-scapularis:—Sus-spini-scapulo- trocliiterien. 3: The Infra-Spinatus—Arises, principally fleshy, from the lower part of the spine of the sca- pula as far back as the triangular flat surface; from the base of the bone below the spine to near the in- ferior angle ; from the posterior ridge of the inferior costa; and from all the dorsum of the bone below the spine. The fibres ascend and descend towards a middle tendon, which runs forwards over the neck of the bone, and adheres to the capsular ligament. Inserted, by a strong short tendon, into the middle part of the great tuberosity of the os humeri. Situation : This muscle is in part concealed. The anterior part of its belly'-, and its tendinous insertion, are covered by the deltoid, and the trapezius passes over its upper and back-part, but a considerable por- tion of the belly of this muscle is seen betwixt these , two muscles, and above the superior fibres of the latissimus dorsi. It is inserted below the tendon of the supra-spinatus. Use: To roll the humerus outwards, to assist in raising the arm, and in moving it outwards when raised. Synonyma: Sus-spini-scapulo-trochitericn. 4. rhe Teres Minor—Arises, fleshy, from the narrow depression between the two ridges in the in- ferior costa ot the scapula, extending from the neck ol the bone to within an inch or two of the inferior angle.

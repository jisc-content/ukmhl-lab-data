The Trunk of the Sixth Pair of Nerves passes through the superior orbitary fissure to the abductor oculi. These delicate nerves are surrounded by the adi- pose substance found in the orbit, and require to be dissected with the utmost care. CHAP. xir. DISSECTION OF THE MUSCLES SITUATED ON THE POSTERIOR Iâ€™ART OF THE TRUNK AND NECK. jT'ROM the number and intimate connection of these muscles, their description necessarily is complicated, and their dissection difficult. The smaller muscle, indeed, cannot be separated, with- out dividing some of their fibres. We do not here, as in the limbs, find the muscles distinctly marked, loosely connected by cellular membrane, and sepa- rated with facility ; but closely united, and in ruany places having their fibres so intermixed, as to render their divisions indistinct and uncertain. f In

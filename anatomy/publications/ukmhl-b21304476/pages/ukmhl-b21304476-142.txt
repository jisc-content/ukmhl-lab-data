The tendon of the little toe is often wanting. Use : rio bend the second joint of the toes. Synomjma : Calcaneo phalanginien commun. Situation ; The muscles of this order are quite su- perficial, being only covered by the fascia plantaris. The first order of muscles being removed, or be- ing lifted from their origins, and left hanging by their tendon, the second order is exposed. 1. The tendon of the Flexor longus digitorum pedis is seen coming from the inside of the os calcis ; and, having reached the middle of the foot, dividing into its four tendons, which pass through the slits of the tendons of the flexor digitorum brevis, and are inserted into the base of the last phalanx of the four lesser toes. 2. The tendon of the Flexor longus pollicis is seen crossing under * the tendon of the flexor longus digi- torum, and, having given to it a short slip of tendon, * In the erect posture, it crosses above, Jving nearer to the ni' t.itursal bonus than that tendon; but in the description, the so e o! the loot is supposed to be placed uppermost. proceeding

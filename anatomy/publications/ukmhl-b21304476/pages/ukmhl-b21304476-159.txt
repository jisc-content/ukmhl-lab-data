In the lateral ventricles we meet with, The Fornix, a medullary body, flat, and of * triangular shape, which divides the two lateral and the third ventricles. It is exposed on tearing away I the septum lucidum ; its lower surface is towards the l third ventricle; its lateral margins are in the lateral ventricles; on its upper surface it supports the sep- tum lucidum, and under its most anterior part is the foramen Monroianum:â€”One of the angles of this body is forward, and the other two towards the back- part : it rests chiefly on the thalami nervorum opti- corum, but is separated from them by a vascular membrane called the vclum- The extremities of the body of the fornix are I named its Crura. 1* The crus anterius is double, bends downwards before the anterior commissure of the brain, with which it is connected, and may be traced into thw corpora caudicautia. 2. The two crura posteriora, coalescing with the back-part of the corpus callosum, pass, on each side, into the inferior cornu of the lateral ventricle, and terminate in a pointed form on the hippocampus major. Divide the body of the fornix, invert it, by turn- ing the anterior crus forwards, and the posterior crura backwards; on the under surface of the latter is an This foramen may always be casity found by following the course of the plexus cboroides, as it passes forwards in the ventricle. It is a slit, rather than a round hole, in the natural ftate. appear^

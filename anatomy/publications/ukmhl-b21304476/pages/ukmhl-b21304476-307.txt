( 281 ) the wrist, to arrive at the place of their insertion.— The tendon of the extensor secundi internodii is at. a considerable distance from the tendons of the two other extensors ; so that, in the intermediate space, we see the terminations of the tendons of the exten- sores carpi radiales. They invest the back-part of the thumb with a fascia. 11. The Indicator—Arises, by an acute fleshy beginning, from the middle of the back-part of the ulna, and from the interosseous ligament. Its ten- don passes through the same stieath of the annular ligament with the extensor digitorum communis, and is Inserted into the posterior part of the fore-finger with the tendon of the common extensor. Situation: It arises nearer to the inner edge of the arm than the extensor secundi internodii pollicis. It is concealed by the extensor digitorum communis and extensor carpi ulnaris. The tendon passes under that of the common extensor. Use: To assist in extending the fore-finger.

The partitions of fascia unite them most firmly to a considerable distance from their commencement; and these connections should not be disturbed, since they areas justly to be regarded: in the light of origins of the muscles, as the attache. ments

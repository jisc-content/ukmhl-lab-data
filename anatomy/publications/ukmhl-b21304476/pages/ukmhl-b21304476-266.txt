( 240 ) Arises, tendinous, from the spinous processes of the two superior lumbar vertebrae, and of the three inferior dorsal. Jtiserted into the spinous processes of the nine up- per vertebras of the back, except the first, by as many distinct tendons. Use: To extend the vertebrae, and to assist in raising the spine. Sunonyma: Lumbo-dor.'o-spinal. The three last-described muscles are covered be- low by the serratus posticus inferior and latissimus dorsi; above, by the rhomboideus, serratus superior posticus, and trapezius. 12. The Cervicalls Descendens—Arises from the upper edge of the four or five superior ribs, by as many distinct tendons, which lie on the inside of the tendinous insertions of the sacro-lumbalis. It forms a small belly, which ascends upwards, and is Inserled,by three distinct tendons, into the fourth, fifth, and sixth cervical vertebrae. Situation : This muscle is small, it is frequently described as an appendage to the sacro-lumbalis.. It arises between the sacro-lumbalis and iongissimus dorsi, and is inserted into the transverse processes between the splenius colii and levator scapulae; of course it is concealed by the rhomboideus, d'C. It often receives a fleshy slip from the upper part of the Iongissimus dorsi. Use: To turn the neck obliquely backwards. Synom/ma : TrausversaJis collateral^ colli. 13. The Tr.insvers.ilis Colli—Arises from the transvere processes of the five superior dorsal vertebra?,

( 113 ) the lower heads of the tibula and fibula, to the fore- part cf the ankle, where it is lost. B, A. Peronka Posterior is properly the ter- mination of the artery; it descends along the sinuo- sity of the os calcis, inosculating with the branches of the tibialis postica, and terminates in the posterior part of the sole of the foot. 2. Muscular branches arise from the artery as it descends; twigs also are sent over the heel and ankle. • 2. VEINS. Ven/K Tib i ales Postic.e.—The posterior tibial veins are generally two in number; they accompany the artery, and terminate in the popliteal vein; they are formed of branches, which correspond to those of the artery. S. NERVES. The Posterior Tibial Nerve, which is the continuation of the great sciatic nerve, sinks below the soleus, and accompanies the posterior tibial ar- tery; it gives off numerous filaments to the muscles in its neighbourhood. At first it continues, as in the ham, immediately behind the artery, but it gra- dually gets on the outside of it as it descends; so that •where they pass along the sinuosity of the os calcis, the nerve k situated close in contact with the side of the artery,but nearer to the projectioaof the heel than that vessel is. With the artery, it divides into, 1. The internal plantar nerve, and, 2. 'I he external plantar nerve.—These nerves sup- ply the muscles' and integuments in the sole of the foot. SECT.

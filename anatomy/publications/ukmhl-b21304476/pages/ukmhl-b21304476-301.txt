( 275 ) middle of the radius in a flat tendon. The tendon runs along the radius, and, becoming rounder', passes through a groove in the back-part of the in- ferior extremity of that bone, to be Inserted into the posterior and upper part of the metacarpal bone of the fore-finger. Situation: The belly lies under the supinator lon- gus, but part of it projects behind that muscle. The tendon descends behind that of the supinator, and passes under the extensors of the thumb, and annu- lar ligament of the wrist, to arrive at the place of its insertion. Use: To extend the wrist, and move the hand backwards, and to assist in bending the fore- arm. Synonyma: Radialis externus longior ;—Radialis externus primus•,—Humero-sus-metacarpien. 3. The Extensor Carpi Radialis Bhevior —Arises, tendinous, from the under and back-part of the external condyle of the os humeri, and from the external lateral ligament of the elbow-joint. Its thick belly runs along the outside of the radius, and terminates in a tendon, which passes through the same groove in the radius as the extensor radialis longior, and under the annular ligament. Inserted, by a round tendon, into the upper and back part of the metacarpal bone that supports the middle finder. Situation: This muscle lies partly under the ex- tensor radialis longior; but it also projects behind it. The tendon is seen behind, or more inwardlv than M 6 the

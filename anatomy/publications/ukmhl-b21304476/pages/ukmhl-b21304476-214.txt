( 188 ) under surface of the root of the lungs to the spine ancl ribs. A triangular space is formed betwixt the two pleurae and the bodies of the dorsal vertebrae; this space or cavity is named the cavity of the pos- terior mediastinum. It contains many important parts, and must therefore be carefully dissected. But first let us attend to the course of the inter- costal/; or great sympathetic nerve, which is seen running by the side of the spine. The Intercostal Nerve, where it enters the thorax, is situated behind the great vessels; close â– upon the articulation of the first rib with the body of the first dorsal vertebra, it forms a ganglion, a twig of which fairly encircles the subclavian artery, while other filaments are entwisted round the root of the vertebral artery. The intercostal nerve then descends along the thorax ; it lies upon the heads of the ribs, where they are articulated with the vertebrae; it receives additional branches from all the dorsal nerves, and in each intercostal space it forms a gang- lion. This nerve may be dissected with greater fa- cility when the lungs are removed,and the ribs sawed off near the spine, which will enable the dissector to trace its branches more fully. It lies behind the pleura, but is seen through it; it passes into the ab- ' dornen by the side of the spine, running through the fibres of the small muscle of the diapflragrn. Bit AU CH ES OK THE INTERCOSTAL IN THE THORAX. The Anterior Intercostal, or Sflanciinic Nerve, should be attended to. It is formed by three or four twigs, which come off from the inter- costal

( 171 ) thoracic portion of the muscle, seem to pass behind those proceeding from the clavicle, and to be Inserted into the os humeri somewhat higher up. Use: To move the arm forwards, and obliquely upwards, towards the sternum. Synunyma : Pectoralis ;—Sterno-costo-clavio-hu- raeral. The pectoralis major should be lifted up from its origin, and suspended by its tendon.—This will ex- pose the next two muscles. 2. The Pf.ctoralis Minor—Arises, by three tendinous and fleshy digitations, from the upper edges of the third, fourth, and fifth ribs, near their cartilages; it forms a fleshy triangular belly, which becomes thicker and narrower as it ascends, and is Inserted, by a short flat tendon, into the anterior part of the coracoid process of the scapula. Situation: The belly of this muscle is covered by the pectoralis major; the tendon passes under the anterior edge of the deltoid, and is connected at its insertion with the origins of the eoraco-brachialis, and of the short head of the biceps flexor cubiti, and also with the ligamentum propritun scapula; anticum, a strong ligament, which passes from the external edge of the coracoid process, to be affixed to the posterior margin of the acromion of the scapula. Use : To draw the scapula forwards and down- wards, aud, when that bone is fixed, to elevate th« ribs. Synonyma: Serratus anticus;—Serratus minor an- ticus;—Costo-coracoidien. 2. The Sueclavius—Arrises, by a flat tendon, 11 2 from

, ( « ) the pectoralis major, serratus anticus, and latissinau* dorsi should be dissected with it. The muscular fibres proceed obliquely downwards and forwards, and about the middle of the side of the belly terminate abruptly in a thin broad tendon, which is continued in the same direction over all the forepart t>f the belly. Here it covers the anterior surface of the rectus abdominis; it is very thin a* the upper part, where the rectus lies on the cartilages of the ribs, and is often removed by the beginner, unless he is very cautious. Insertion : Tendinous and fleshy, into two ante- rior thirds of the outer edge of the crista of the os ilium, from the anterior superior spine of which, for it extends to the os pubis, forming Poupart’s liga- ment into the ensiform cartilage, and into the whole length of the linea alba. Situation: It is quite superficial, and covers the whole of the anterior part of the abdomen. The muscular part is closely covered by a thin expansion of cellular substance, which might be mistaken for tendinous fibres, hut it is only the cellular mem- brane condensed, and ought to be removed along with the integuments. Use: To draw down the ribs in expiration, to bend the trunk forwards when both muscles act, or to bend it obliquely to one side when one of them acts singly; to raise the pelvis obliquely when the ribs are fixed; to compress the abdominal viscera, to thrust the diaphragm upwards, to assist in the expulsion of the urine and faeces, and of the foetus.

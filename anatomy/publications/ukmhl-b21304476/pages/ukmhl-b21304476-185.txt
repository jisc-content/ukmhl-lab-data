Inserted into the root of the tongue, runs along iits side, and is insensibly lost near its tip. Situation: This muscle lies within and rather above t i the stylo-hyoideus; underneath it is a ligament, i extending from the styloid process to the angle of : the os hyoides—Ligamentous fibres are also seen I passing from that process to the inside of the angle i of the lower jaw. Use: To move the tongue laterally and back- wards. 11. The Stylo-Pharyngeus—Arises, fleshy I from the root and inner part of the styloid process. Inserted into the side of the pharynx and back- part of the thyroid cartilage. Situation : It is situated deeper, and behind the stylo-glossus. Use: To dilate and raise the pharynx and thyroid cartilage upwards. Synonyma: Stylo-thyro-pharyngien. On removing the submaxillary glands, and detach- ing the digastric muscle from the os hyoides and chin, we expose the next muscle. 12. The Mylo-Hyoideus—Arises, fleshy from all the inside of the lower jaw, between the last dens molaris and the middle of the chin; the fibres form < a flat muscle, converge, and are Inserted into the lower edge of the base of the os hyoides. Situation; This muscle unites with its fellow in a middle

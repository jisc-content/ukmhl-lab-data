( 52 ) from the edge of that bone between its anterior su- perior spinous process and the acetabulum, and from all its hollow part between the spine and the Jinea innominatn. Its fibres descend under the outer half of Poupart’s ligament, and join the tendon of the psoas magnus. Inserted with the psoas magnus. Situation : It fills up the internal concave surface of the os ileum, and is situated on the outside of the psoas magnus. It is covered \yj a pretty strong fascia, which is inserted into the crista of the ileum, and into the crural arch: Fascia Iuaca. The latter inser- tion prevents the bowels from descending under Poupart’s ligament, except at the inner edge of tlvo iliac vein, which is accordingly the situation of the crural hernia, and which the student should examine most carefully. A part of this fascia is also continued behind the femoral vessels over the pubis, to form a part of the sheath which incloses those vessels *. Use: To assist in bending the thigh, and in bring- ing it directly forwards. , Synonyma : Iliacho-trochantin. N. D. The insertion of the two last-described mus- cles cannot be seen till the thigh is dissected, when it will be found to lie between the vastus interims and the pectinaeus. 4-. The Quadratics Lu.mborum.—This muscle arises, tendinous and fleshy, from rather more than tbe posterior third part of the spine of the os ileum. * See the second part of Mr. Coeper’s work oil Hernia, and Mr. Lawrence’s treatise quoted before.

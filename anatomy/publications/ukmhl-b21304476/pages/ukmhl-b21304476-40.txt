Transversalis Abdominis.— Arises, tendi- nous, from the fascia lumborum, and back part of the spine of the os ilium ; fleshy from all the remaining part of the spine of the ilium, and from the inner sur- face of-Poupart’s ligament; and fleshy from the inner or back part of the cartilages of the seven lower ribs, where its fibres meet those of the diaphragm. The fleshy fibres proceed transversely, and end in n flat sheet of tendon, which, after being connected to the other tendons at the linrea semilunaris, passes with the posterior layer of the internal oblique be- hind the rectus, and is inserted into the ensiform car- tilage, and into the whole length of the linen alba, excepting its lowermost part; for, at the middle dis- tance between the umbilicus and os pubis, a slit or fissure is formed in this tendon, through which the rectus abdominis passes; and the remainder of the tendon passes before the rectus, to be inserted into the lower part of the linea alba. Its inferior edge is connected with that of the preceding muscle in its insertion into the pubis. Situation : It is covered by the obliquus descen- ded interims, and is lined by the peritoneum. Use: To support and compress the viscera of the abdomen. Synonyma ; Transversus abdominis ;—lumbo-ili- abdnminal. Where the transversalis is detached from its origins, and turned back towards the linea semilunaris, the peritoneum is laid bare, except in the neighbourhood of

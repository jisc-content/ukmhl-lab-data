( 10 ) and the posterior part of the sheath is consequently deficient, the rectus lying naked on the peritoneum. The two oblique muscles are now to be replaced; then, making an incision by the side of the lineu alba, and thus opening the sheath of the rectus through its whole length, you dissect it hack towards the linea semilunaris, and thus lay bare the fibres of the muscle next to be described. *t. Rectus Abdominisâ€”Arises,by a flat tendon, from the fore-part of the os pubis ; as it ascends, its fleshy belly becomes broader and thinner. Inserted, by a thin fleshy expansion, into the ansi- form cartilage, and into the cartilages of the three inferior true ribs. Situation : This pair of muscles is situated on each side of the linea alba, under the tendons of the ob- lique muscles. The muscle is generally divided by three tendinous intersections; the first is at the um- bilicus, the second where it runs over the cartilage of tfie seventh rib, and the third in the middle between these; and there is commonly a half intersection, below the umbilicus. Hy these intersections, the muscle is connected firmly to the interim part of its sheath, forming the line#: thansveks.e ; while it adheres very slightly by loose cellular substance to the posterior layer. Use : To compress the fore-part of the abdomen, to bend the trunk forwards, or to raise the pelvis. Synonyma: Pubio-sternal. On each side of the linea alba, and inclosed in the lower part of the sheath of the rectus, is some- times found a small muscle, named 5. Pvra-

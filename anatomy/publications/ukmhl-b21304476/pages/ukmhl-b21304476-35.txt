( 9 ) student will be much confused by this multitude of names, unless he remembers that they denote only one object; that the crural arch, the inferior or outer column ofthe abdominal ring, Po apart’,'; or the inguinal ligament, are so many names applied to the inferior border of the tendon of the external oblique muscle of the abdomen. I would advise the student, before he proceeds to the dissection of the other abdominal muscles, to dis- sect the pgrts in the groin, and to examine the situa- tion of the great inguinal vessels. In taking off the skin from the groin, you will not find a strong regular fascia, as on the outer part of the thigh, but a confused and irregular aponeurosis coming oft from the abdomen, and going down upon the thigh, strengthened by the intermixture of con- densed cellular substance, and very loose above the great vessels- Immediately under the skin, and above this apo- neurosis, you perceive a congeries of lymphatic glands, and sometimes the lymphatic vessels them- selves can be distinguished by their semi-transparent coats, and knotted appearance. Also, immediately under the skin you will find the Vena Saphena run- ning from below upwards, at first lying on the fascia, and then gradually sinking through it to join the fe- moral vein, about an inch below Poupart’s ligament. On removing this irregular fascia, we come down upon the great vessels, which lie deeply imbedded in cellular substance, and are closely invested and sup- ported by a firm sheath, or fascia, consisting chiefly ei cellular substance, very much condensed.

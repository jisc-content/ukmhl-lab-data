( 96 ) the annular ligament near the inner ankle, runs over the astragalus and os navieulare, and is Inserted into the upper and inner part of the os cuneiforme internum, and the base of the metatarsal bone supporting the great toe. Situation : The belly is quite superficial, lying un- der the fascia of the leg on the outside of the spine of thqftibia; the insertion of the tendon is concealed in part by the abductor and flexor brevis of the great toe. Between the tendon of this muscle and the os cuneiforme, we find a small bursa mucosa. Use: To draw the foot upwards and inwards; or, in other words, to bend the ankle joint. Si/noni/ma : Tibio-sus-metatarsien. 2. Extensor Lonous Digitorum Pedisâ€” Arises, tendinous and fleshy, from the outer part of the head of the tibia; from the head of the fibula; from the anterior angle of the fibula almost its whole length ; and from part of the smooth surface between the anterior and internal angles; from a small part of the interosseous ligament; from the fascia and inter- muscular ligaments. Below the middle of the leg, it splits into four round tendons, which pass under the annular liga- ment, become flattened, and are Inserted into the root of the first phalanx of each of the four small toes, and expanded over the upper side of the toes as far as the root of the last phalanx. Situation: This muscle also runs entirely superfi- cial ; it lies between the tibialis anticus and peroneus longus, being firmly connected to them by intermus- cular

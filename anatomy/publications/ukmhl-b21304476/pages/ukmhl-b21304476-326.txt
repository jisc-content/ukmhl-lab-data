( 300 ) (fi.) The Muscular or Spiral Nerve (Ka- li al of some anatomists) passes from the axilla behind the os humeri, making a spiral turn round the bone to reach the outside of the arm. It first descends between the brachialis externu6 and short head of the biceps extensor cubiti, accompanying the arteria profunda humeri superior, and passing deep into the flesh of the arm. Before it makes this turn, it gives branches to the muscles, also a cuta- neous branch, which descends on the inside of the arm. From the back-part of the arm the great trunk of the nerve is-reflected spirally forwards. It is seen emerging betwixt the supinator longus and brachialis interims, seated deep and close to the bone. It descends betwixt these muscles, keeping close to the edge of the supinator longus. Immediately after passing the fold of the arm, it sends off a nerve, which descends, superficial, upon the radial edge of the fore- arm, as far as the wrist; and, at this point, the trunk of the muscular nerve divides itself into twobranches. The first, a large branch, perforates the supinator brevis, and supplies the extensor muscles of the hand and fingers. The second branch accompanies the su- pinator longus down the fore-arm, and near the wrist turns under the tendon of that muscle, over the edge of the radius. It then divides into several branches which ramify on the back of the wrist, thumb, and fore-finger. (7.) The Internal Cutaneous Nerve de- scends, superficial, along the inside of the arm and fore-arm. It was described among the cutaneous nerves of the arm. THE END.

( 81 ) the trochanter major; sends off a great quantity of tendinous fibres, to be inseparably joined to the fascia lata of the thigh ; and is Inserted, into a rough surface at the upper and outer part of the linea aspera, immediately below the trochanter major; also very extensively into the fascia lata, which covers the former insertion. Situation : It is quite superficial, covering all the other muscles which are situated on the back-part of the hip, covering also the tuber ischii, and the ten- dons of the muscles which arise from that projection. Its insertion lies between the vastus externus and the adductor magnus femoris, and immediately above the origin of the short head of the biceps flexor cruris :•—so much adipose membrane is en- tangled with this muscle, that it is very difficult to dissect it clean, and quite impossible, if you do not dissect in the course of the fibres, which are di- vided into vei y large and strong fasciculi. Use: To restore the thigh, after it has been bent 5 —to rotate it outwards; to extend the pelvis on the thigh, and maintain it in that position in the erect posture of the body. Synonyma: Gluteus magnus;—Gluteus major;— Ilio-sacro-femoral. The muscle is now to be lifted from its origin, and left hanging by its tendon: remark the large bursa mucosa formed between the tendon and the trochan- ter major; and another between its insertion into the fascia and the tendon of the vastus externus. 2.

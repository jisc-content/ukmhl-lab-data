'( 134. ) i appearance of transverse lines, named Corpus Psal- loides, psalterium, or lyra. The inversion of the fornix exposes The Plexus Choroides.â€”This is a continuation of the pin matter, a spongy mass, consisting of folds of tortuous vessels, partly covering the thalami ner- vorum opticorum, and continued into the inferior cornu of the lateral ventricles. The plexus of each side is connected to its fallow by the velum interpo- sition, a membrane which passes under the fornix, and lies on the third ventricle and corpora quadrige- mina. From this plexus the blood is received b}' the Vena Galeni situated in the middle of the velum which consists of two parallel branches ; these run backwards, unite, and enter the fourth sinus of the dura matter, called Torcular Herop#ili. This plexus should now be detached at its fore- part, and turned back ; it will remain as a guide to the knife in tracing the inferior cornu of the lateral ventricle. We now see, The Corpora Striata* two smooth cineritious convexities, in the lore-part of the lateral ventricle,, broad, and rounded anteriorly, becoming narrow, and diverging as they pass backwards, consisting of medullary and cortical substance disposed in striae. The Tiialami Nervorum Opticorum, two large oval whitish eminences, placed by the side of each other between the diverging extremities or crura of the corpora striata; towards their fore-part is a peculiar

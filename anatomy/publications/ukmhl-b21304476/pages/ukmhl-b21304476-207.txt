THE COURSE OF THE BRACHIAL PLEXUS OF NERVES May also be examined. This plexus is formed by branches of the four lower cervical and first dorsal nerves, which pass between the anterior and middle scaleni muscles into the axilla. In this passage they are situated higher up than the artery. A considerable part of the scaleni muscles may now be seen ; the upper insertion of these muscles must be dissected with the muscles of the back-part of the neck. 1. The Scalenus Anticus—Arises, by three tendons, from the transverse processes of the fourth, fifth, and sixth vertebrae of the neck. Inserted, tendinous and fleshy, into the upper edge of the first rib, near its cartilage. Synonyma : Scalenus prior;—First scalenus;— Anterior portion of the first scalenus;—Trachelo- costal. 2. The Scalenus Medius—Arises, tendinous, from the transverse processes of all the vertebrae of the neck. Inserted into the upper and outer part of the first rib, from its root to within the distance of half an iuch from the scalenus anticus. Synonyma t

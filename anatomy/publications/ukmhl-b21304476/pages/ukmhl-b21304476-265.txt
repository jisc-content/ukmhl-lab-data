( 239 ) which pass to the superior ribs are longer, ascend nearly straight, and are situated nearer to the spine than those tendons which pass to the lower ribs. On separating the inner edge of this muscle, (z. e. the edge next to the spine), from the latissimus dorsi, and turning the belly towards the ribs, we see six or eight small tendinous and fleshy bundles, which pass from the inner side of this muscle, to be inserted into the upper edge of the six or eight inferior ribs. These are called the Musculi Accessorii ad Sacro- Lumbalem. Use: To pull the ribs downwards, to assist in erecting the trunk of the body, and in .turning it to one side. Synonyma: Lumbo-costo-trachelien. The longissimus dorsi is inserted into all the ribs except the two inferior, betwixt their tubercles and angle's, by slips which are tendinous and fleshy, and into the transverse processes, of all the dorsal vertebne by small double tendons. The insertions in the ribs proceed from the outer side of the muscle, while the attachments to the transverse •processes are seen on separating the longissimus dorsi from the spinalis dorsi. Use; To extend the vertebrie, and keep the body erect. Synonyma: Lumbo-dorso-trachelien. 11. The StiNALis Dorsi is much smaller than the two last-described muscles; below, it cannot be : separated from the longissimus dorsi, without divid- ing some fibres; it lies betwixt that muscle and the • spine.

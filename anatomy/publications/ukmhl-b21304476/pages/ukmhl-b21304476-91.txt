( 65 ) (he lore-part of the thigh, it will be proper to attend to some parts which arc situated above the fascia. 1. The Vena Saphena Major is seen running up in the inside of the knee and thigh. At first it lies very superficial, betwixt the skin and fascia, and in- volved in the intermediate celiullar membrane. As it ascends, it is gradually enveloped by the fibres of the fascia, and then sinks beneath it to join the femoral vein about an inch below Poupart’s ligament:—In its course it is joined by several cutaneous veins. 2. Immediately under the true skin, and more su- perficial than the veins or nerves, you may occasion- ally perceive the Lymphatic Vessels running, like lines of a whitish colour, to enter the inguinal glands: they are more numerous on the fore-part, than on the outside of the thigh. S. Several Cutaneous Nerves are seen ramify- ing above the fascia. They all come from the lumbar or anterior crural nerve, pierce the fascia about the lower part of the abdomen and groin, and are distri- buted to the groin, and integuments on the fore- part of the thigh. The fascia may now be exposed distinctly. Ob- serve how extensively it arises from the bones, ten- dons, and ligaments. On the anterior and superior part of the thigh, it arises from Poupart’s ligament*, from * At this part the fascia of the thigh is covered by a more superficial expansion, which lies over the lower part of the aponeurosis of the external oblique muscle, completely covers the crural arch, and descends some little way beyond the bend of the thigh. It has been called the superficial fascia. It co- vers

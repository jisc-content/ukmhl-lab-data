( 184- ) the first rib, and before the anterior scalenus muscle into the thorax. Deeper seated, and immediately behind the axil- lary vein, lies the Axillary Artery. It is seen coming from under the clavicle; from under the arch formed by the pectoralis minor, it comes over the middle of the first rib, and between the anterior and middle scaleni muscles In the axilla it is surrounded by the meshes of the nerves, and runs along the inferior edge of the coraco-brachialis muscle; when it has passed the anterior edge of the pectoralis major, it assumes the name of the Brachial Artery. The branches of the axillary artery are, 1. A. Mammakia Externa, called also, A. Thoracicie Extern*.—The external mammary artery consists of three or four branches which run down- wards and forwards obliquely over the chest. These branches sometimes come off separately from the axillary artery, at other times by one or two com- mon trnnks, which subdivide. They supply the pectoral muscles and mamma. Some of their branches pass to the muscles of the shoulder, to the side of the chest, *and to the muscles on the inside of the scapula. •> 2. A. Scapular is Interna, Supra-scapularis or Dorsalis Scapulas, is sent off from the back-part of the axillary artery. It runs across the bottom of the neck towards the root of the coracoid process, and passes through the semilunar notch in the superior costa of the scapula; it supplies the supra-spinatus muscle,

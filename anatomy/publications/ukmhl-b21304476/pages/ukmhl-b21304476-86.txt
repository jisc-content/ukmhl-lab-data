The muscles which are met with in this dissection consist of four pair, and two single muscles. The Erector Clitoridis, Tiunsvehsus Perinei, Levator Ani* COCCYGEUS, The Sphincter Anj, Sphincter Vaginae, 1. The Erector Ceitorides, arises, fleshy and tendinous,'from the tuber ischii, from the inside of the ramus of the os ischium, and from the ramus of the os pubis: It passes over the crus of the clitoris, and, becoming tendinous, is lost upon it. Use: To draw the clitoris downwards and for- wards, and, by compressing it, to propel tho blood. Synonyma : First muscle of the clitoris ;—Ischio^ cavernosus;—Ischio-clitoridien. Arising from the same point, and surrounded by much cellular membrane, we find, 2. The Tiiansversus Perinei.—Its on'gin ?s same as in the male. is inserted into a ligamentous substance in the perineum anterius, at the point where the sphincter ani and sphincter vaginae meet. This ligamentous or tendinous substance deserves attention. Here, as in the male, it is the point of union into which different muscles are inserted. Use: To sustain the perineum. 2 small s two single muscles. • on each side.

( 2« ) the oblique and transverse processes of all the lum- bar vertebrae; from the transverse processes of all the dorsal vertebrae; and from those of the cervi- cal vertebra*, excepting the three first. The fibres arising from this extensive origin pass obliquely, to be , Insertedby distinct tendons, into the spinous pro- cesses of all the vertebrae of the loins and back, and into those of the six inferior vertebra of the neck. The fibres arising from each vertebrae are inserted into the second one above it, and sometimes njore. Use: To extend the back obliquely, or move it to one side. W hen both muscles act, they extend tke vertebrae backwards. Synonymn : Transversal is lumborum dorsi et colli; —Transverso-spinalis lumborum, dorsi et colli; vel Semi-spinalis. The small muscles situated between the processes of the vertebrae are, ,1. Interspinales colli, dorsi, et lumborum— These are small bundles of fibres, which fill up the spaces between the spinous processes of the vertebrae. Each of these little muscles arises from the surfac# of one spinous process, and is inserted into the next spinous process. In the neck they are large, and appear double, ps the spinous processes of the cervical vertebrae are bi- furcated. In the hack and loins they are indistinct, find are rather small tendons than muscles. Use; To draw the spinous processes near to each other. 2. The In ter thans vers ales colli, dorsi, et lum-

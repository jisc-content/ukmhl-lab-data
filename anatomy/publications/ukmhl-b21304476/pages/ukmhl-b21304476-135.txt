( 109 ) pollicis. The situation of the tendon is described with the muscle situated in the sole of the foot. Use: To bend the last joint of the toes, and to assist in extending the foot. Synonyma: Flexor tertii internodii digitorum pedis;—Tibio-phalangcttien-commun. 6. Flexor Longus Pollicis Pedis—Arises, fleshy, from the posterior flat surface of the fibula, continuing its origin from some distance below the head of the bone to within an inch of the ankle* The fleshy fibres terminate in a tendon, which passes behind the inner ankle through a groove in the tibia; next through a groove in the astragalus, crosses in the sole of the foot the tendon of the flexor longus digitorum, to which it gives a slip of t endon ; passes between the two sesamoid bones, and is Inserted into the last joint of the great toe. Situation: The belly of this muscle is covered by thesoleus; it lies on the outside of the flexor longus digitorum, between that muscle and the peroneus longus; the tendon, where it passes behind the inner ankle, is situated more backward than the ten- don of the flexor digitorum longus, that is, nearer the os calcis, and will be seen in the foot. Use: To bend the last joint of the great toe, and, being connected by a cross slip to the flexor digi- torum communis, to assist in bending the other toes. Synonyma: Peroneo-phalanginien du gros orteil. 7. The Tibialis Posticus—Arises, fleshy, from the posterior surface of both the tibia and fibula, im- mediately below the upper articulation of these bones with each other; from the whole of the interosseous . ligament;

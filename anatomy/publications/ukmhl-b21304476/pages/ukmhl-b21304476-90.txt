TJENEATH the integuments common to every part of the body, you will find a strong fasciar or aponeurotic expansion, investing the whole thigh.. This expansion is named the Fascia Lata Fe- moius; it consists partly of tendinous, partly of li- gamentous fibres; it surrounds and covers all the muscles, and sends septa or partitions between them:—It is very strong, smooth, and tendinous on the outer part of the thigh; but, on the anterior and inner part, it is very thin, and of iX cellular texture. Therefore, if you wish to demonstrate the whole ex- tent of this fascia, it should be first exposed on the outside of the thigh, and the dissection should be continued very carefully inwards on the fore-part, where it is with difficulty distinguished from the common cellular membrane. But, in removing the common integuments from the

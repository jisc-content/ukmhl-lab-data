( 19S ) are I 2 be continued through the apex of the heart, or a. flap may be made by another cut, passing from the beginning of the first along the margin of the right auricle.â€”In this ventricle, observe the projecting bundles of muscular fibres, the Tricuspid Valves arising from the margin of the ostium venosum, and projecting into the right ventricle. This valve forms a complete circle at its base, but has its edge di- vided into three parts, which are attached by tendi- nous filaments, named Chords Tendinee, to the Carmeaj Columns, or muscular bundles of the ventricle. The Septum Ventriculorum, or partition of the two ventricles, is marked out externally by two veins running from the apex to the basis of the heart. Slit up the pulmonary artery; observe how it arises from the back-part of the right veptricle, how smooth the inside of the ventricle becomes as it ap- proaches the entrance of the artery, or ostium arte- riosum. Observe the three Semilunar or Sigmoid Valves. Their bases arise from the artery, their loose edges project into its cavity, and in the middle of the loose edge of each valve is seen a small white body, termed Corpus Sesamoideum Arantii. The artery is seen bifurcating into the right and left pul- monary arteries, and, just before its bifurcation, sending of!' to the aorta the ductus arteriosus, which in the adult is a ligament. The Left Auricle has four pulmonary veins opening into its cavity, which may be exposed by slitting up two of these veins. Observe that its coats

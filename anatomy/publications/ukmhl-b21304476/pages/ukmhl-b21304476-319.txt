( 293 } 1. Arterla Radialisâ€”The radial artery, is smaller than the ulnar, and in its course more super- ficial. It leaves the ulnar artery, and inclines to- wards the radial and outer edge of the fore-arm. At first it lies betwixt the pronator teres and supinator longus. It then descends close along the inner edge of the supinator longus, and about the middle of the fore-arm passes over the insertion of the pronator teres. It then hold it course betwixt the supinator longus and flexor carpi radialis, and is accompanied by a branch of the muscular or spiral nerre. In this situation the artery continues its course along the ra- dius, till, reaching the lower extremity of that bone, it divides into two branches. (l.) Ramus Volaris, A. Superficialis Vol.t:, is by much the smallest of the two branches. It passes into the muscylar mass which forms the ball of the thumb, and spreads its ramifications on*the palmar fascia, annular ligament of the wrist, and muscles of the thumb, anastomosing with the rami- fications of the superficial palmar arch. (2.) The trunk of the radial artery crosses over the lower extremity of the radius to the back of the r hand. It passes under the extensors of the thumb, ever the os scaphoides and the junction of the os tra- pezium and trapezoidcs, and, arriving at the space betwixt the bases of the metacarpal bones of the thumb and fore-finger, plunges into the palm of the hand. The branches of the radial artery, in its course ajong the fore-arm, are the following. (1.) The recurrent artery is sent olf from the ra- dial immediately after it leaves the ulnar-artery, and N 3 is

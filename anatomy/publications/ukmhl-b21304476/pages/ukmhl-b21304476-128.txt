5. The <r ( 102 ) close upon the middle of the interosseous ligament, between the tibialis anticus and extensor proprius pollicis ; "below the middle of the leg, it leaves the interosseous ligament, and passes gradually more for- wards ; it crosses under the tendon of the extensor proprius pollicis*, and is then situated between that tendon, and the first tendon of the extensor longus digitorum: at the ankle it runs over the fore-part of the tibia, being now suituatedmoresuperfrcially; then over the astragalus and os naviculare, and over the junction of the os cunieforme internum and medium; crossing under that tendon of the extensor brevis di- gitorum which goes to the great toe.â€”Arriving at the space between the bases of the two first metatarsal bones, it plunges into the sole of the foot, and imme- diately joins the plantar arch* BRANCHES. 1. A. RecuRRENS, which ramifies over the fore- part of the knee, inosculating with the articular arteries. 2. Numerous twigs to the tibialis anticus, extensor pollicis, and other muscles on the fore-part of the leg. 3. A. Malleoi-aris Interna ramifies over the inner ankle, and inosculates with the perineal and posterior tibial arteries. 4. The External Malleolar ramifies over the outer ankle. * It is crowed by that tendon jnut above the lower head of the tibia, while under annular ligament.

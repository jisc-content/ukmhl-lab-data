( Â»1 ) axilla, it runs along the inferior edge of the coracs- brachialis. Rather higher up than the middle of the. os humeri, it crosses over the tendinous insertion ot that muscle, being here situated between the belly of the biceps flexor cubiti, and the superior fibres ofthe brachialis externus. The artery then passes.behind the inner'fcdgq of the biceps flexorcubiti, descending betwixt that muscle and the fibres of the brachialis interims. In dissecting this vessel, we find it,invested by a fascia or sheath, formed by cellular membrane and some tendinous fibres. This fascia may be traced extending from the internal intermuscular ligament. It covers the brachial artery and radial nerve; and the great basilic vein, as it enters into the axilla, is found lying in the fore and inner part of this sheath. It supports and connects these ves- sels. On dissecting this fascia, we find, dose to the margin of the coraco-brachialis and biceps flexor cubiti, the great radial nerve-; under it the brachial artery ; and, more superficially seated, the venae co- mites and the venabasilica. As theartery approaches the lower extremity of the os humeri, it inclines for- wards toward the fold of the arm, and dives beneath the aponeurosis which arises from the inside of the tendon of the biceps flexor cubiti. Its situation at the fold of the arrn has been described. BRANCHES OF tAe BRACHIAL ARTERY. 1. A. Profunda Humeri Superior, or Mus- cularis Superior, is sent off from the inner side of the brachial artery, immediately where it has left tne fold of the urrn-pit. It passes downwards and back- wards round the os humeri, and is accompanied-by N 2 the

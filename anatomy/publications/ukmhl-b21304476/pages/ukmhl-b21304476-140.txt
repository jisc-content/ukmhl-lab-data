( 11* ) SECT. III. DISSECTION OF THE SOLE OF THE FOOT. THE cuticle is very much thickened on the sole of the foot from constant pressure; betwixt the inte- guments and plantar aponeurosis, we find a tough granulated fat, which adheres firmly to the aponeu- rosis, and is dissected off with difficulty. Aponeurosis, sen Fascia Plantahis, is a very strong, tendinous expansion, which arises from the projecting extremity of the os calcis, and passes to the root of the toes, covering and supporting the muscles of the sole of the foot. Where it arises from the heel, it is thick, but narrow; as it runs over the foot, it becomes broader and thinner; and it is fixed to the head of each of the metatarsal bones by a bi- furcated extremity, which, by its splitting, leaves room for the tendons, &c. to pass. It seems divided into three portions, which are connected by strong fasciculi of tendinous fibres; and fibres are sent down, forming perpendicular partitions among the muscles, and separating them inlo three classes. ]. The middle portion, which is the largest, and under which are contained the flexor brevis digito- rum, and the tendons of the flexor longus and lum- bricales. 2. The external lateral portion, which covers the muscles of the little toe. 3. The internal lateral portion, concealing the muscles of the great toe. On removing the plantar aponeurosis, the first order

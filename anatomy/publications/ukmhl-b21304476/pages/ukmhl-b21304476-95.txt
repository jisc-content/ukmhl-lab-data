( <59 ) femoris must be raised; and then that tendon, which proceeds from the inferior spinous process, may be seen partly covered with the outer edge of the iliacus interims, while the other tendon is exposed by raising the anterior and inferior fibres of the gluteus mini- mus. The fleshy belly, at its uppermost part is co- vered by the sartorius, and, to allow that muscle to slide over it, is tendinous; below this, it issituated su- perficially, immediately under the fasciae, runs down over the vasti and crurteus ; and on its posterior sur- face, where it is in contact with those muscles, it is tendinous. Its insertion lies betwixt the two vasti. Use: To extend the leg on the thigh, and to bend the thigh on the pelvis; to bring the pelvis and thigh forwards to the leg. Synonyma: Rectus cruris;—Rectus anterior;— Gracilis anterior;—Ilio-rotulien. Under the rectus, and partly covered by it, there is a large mass of flesh, which, at first sight, appears to form but one muscle. It may, however, be divided into three; the separation on the external surface is not generally very evident, but, by following the course of the vessels which enter this mass, and by cutting through perhaps a few fibres externally, you will discover the line of separation; and this separa- tion, as you proceed deeper with your dissection, will become very distinct. The three muscles are named vastus externus, vastus internus, and crurams: at the upper and middle parts of the thigh, they may be separated very distinctly ; but for two or three inches above the condyles, they are connected inseparably. 4.

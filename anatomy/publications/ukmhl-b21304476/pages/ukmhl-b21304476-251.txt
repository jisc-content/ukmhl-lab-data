( 225 ) Inserted into the inferior and anterior part of'the tunica sclerotica. Use: To move the globe of the eye downwards. Synonyma : Rectus deprimens oculi;—Sous-opti- epheno-scleroticien. 4.. The Adductor Oculi—Arises from the inner part of the foramen opticum, and is Inserted into the inner and anterior part of the tunica sclerotica. It,is the shortest of the four recti muscles. Use: To draw the eye towards the nose. Synonyma : Rectus adducens oculi;—Orbito-in- tus-scleroticien. 5. The Abductor Oculi—Arises from the outer part of the foramen opticum. Inserted into the outer part of the tunica sclerotica. It is the longest of the recti. Use : To move the globe outwards. Synonyma : Rectus abducens oculi;—Orbito-exr- tus-scleroticien. The two next are oblique muscles. 6. The Obliuuus Superior, or Trochlearis— Arises, by a small tendon, from the margin of the foramen opticum, between the levator and abductor oculi. Its long slender belly run's along the inner side of the orbit to the internal angular process of the os frontis, where a cartilaginous pully is fixed. The muscle then forms a tendon, which passes through the pulley, runs obliquely downwards and outwards, inclosed in a membranous sheath; and becoming broader and thinner, is Inserted into the tunica sclerotica, about half-way K i betweea

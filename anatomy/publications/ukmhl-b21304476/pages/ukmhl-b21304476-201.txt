( 175 ) under the tip of the left auricle, a branch of the eo- ronary vein, and one of the coronary artery, ramify towards the apek of the heart, marking the situation of the septum cordis. The left ventricle will be found firm, fleshy, and resisting, whilst thy right ventricle is more loose, and seems partly wrapt round the other. The heart is situated obliquely in the middle of the breast; its posterior surface is fiat, and lies upon the diaphragm; its apex is turned forwards, and to- wards the left side, so thpt, in the living body, it is felt striking between the fifth and sixth ribs, at the point where the cartilages and bony extremities are united. The Vena Cava Supkkior is seen com- ing down from the upper angle of the pericardium. The I n t E r i o n Cava is seen coming up through the diaphragm ; but only a very small part of this vein is covered by the pericardium; the two veins enter the right auricle. The Right Auricle is turned for- wards, and might be called the anterior; it generally appears black, by the blood shining through its thin coats. The Right Ventricle is situated almost directly opposite. The Pulmonary Artery arises from the right ventricle; its root isconcealedby the right auricle; it ascends on the left side of the aorta; it divides into, 1. the right pulmonary artery, which passes under the arch of the aorta, crosses be- hind it and the vena cava superioiâ€™ to the right lung, and is the longest; anil, 2. the left pulmonary artery, which passes to the left lung, crossing the descend- ing aorta anteriorly. The Pulmonary Veins en- ter the left auricle, two veins come from each lun<r; II the

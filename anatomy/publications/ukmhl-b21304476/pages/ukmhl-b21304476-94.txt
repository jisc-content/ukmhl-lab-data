( 08 ) vaginae femoris, anil the outer attachment of Pou* part’s ligament, and above the anterior fibres of the iliacus intcrnus. It lies before the muscles of the thigh, crossing them like a strap about two inches in breadth; it runs down for some space upon the rectus femoris, passes over the vastus interims, and then over the triceps adductor longus. .At the lower part of the thigh, it runs between the tendon of the triceps adductor magnus, and that of the gracilis In all this course, it is firmly bound down by the common fascia of the thigh. It is inserted above tendons of the gracilis and semitendinosus, over which it sends an aponeurotic expansion. Use: To bend the leg obliquely inwards on the thigh, and to bend the thigh forwards. Synonyma: Longissimusfemoris;—IHo-creti-tibifiL 3. The Rectus Femoris—Arises, by a strong ten- don, from the inferior anterior spinous process of the os ileum ; and, by another strong tendon, from the dorsum of that bone a little above the acetabu- lum, and from the capsular ligament of the hip-joint. The two tendons soon unite, and send off a large belly, which runs down over the anterior part of the thigh, forming a complete penniform muscle, and terminates in a flat but strong tendon, which is Inserted into the upper extremity of the patella ; where a thin aponeurosis is sent from it over the fore-part of that bone, to terminate on the strong li- gament which connects the lower part of the patella to the tibia, and is called Ligamentum Patellae. Situation: To expose the tendinous origins of this muscle, the origins of the sartorius and tensor vaginae femoris

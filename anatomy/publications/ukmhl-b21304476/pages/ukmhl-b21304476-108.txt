( 82 ) all the outer edge of the spine of the os ileum, as far as the posterior tuberosity; from the dorsum of the bone, between the spine, and semicircular ridge, (whichpasses from the anterior superior spinous pro- cess to the ischiatic notch); also from the rough sur- face which extends from the anterior superior to the anterior inferior spinous process, and from the inside of a fascia which covers its anterior part. The fibres converge into a strong and broad tendon, which is Inserted into the upper and outer part of the great trochanter. Situation: The posterior part of the belly and the tendon qre concealed by the gluteus maximus, but the anterior and largest part of this muscle is super- ficial, being only covered by a fascia ; it lies behind the origin of the tensor vaginas femoris, and above the belly of the pyriformis; it covers the gluteus minimus. Use: to draw the thigh-bone outwards, or away from the opposite limb ; to maintain the pelvis in a state of equilibrium on the thigh in progression, while the other foot is raised from the ground; by its posterior fibres to rotate the limb outwards ; and by its anterior inwards. Synonyma: Uio-trochanterien. Having lifted up this muscle from its origin, you will discover S. 'lhe Gluteus Minimusâ€”It arises, fleshy, frem the semicircular ridge of the ileum, and from the dorsum of the bone below the ridge within half an inch of. the acoJabulum. Its fibres run in

( III ) VESSELS AND NERVES OF THE POSTE- RIOR PART OF THE LEG. L. ARTERIES. Arteria Tibialts Postica.â€”The posterior ti- bial artery, which is the continued trunk of the pop*- liteal, sinks under the origins of the soleus, and runs down thelegbctwecnthatmuscle and themore deeply scattered flexors of the toes: It does not lie in imme- diate contact with the fibres ef the flexors, but, like the femoral artery, is invested by a strong sheath of condensed cellular membrane. It is, together with Jts veins and accompanying nerve, also supported by the fascia which binds down the deep-seated muscles. As it descends, it gradually advances more forwards, following the course of the flexor tendons: it passes behind the inner ankle, in the sinuosity of the os ealcis, lying posterior to the tendon of the flexor longus digitorum, and anterior to that of the flexor longus pollicis. Here it is close upon the bone, and its pulsation may be felt. It sinks under the abductor pollicis, arising from the os calcis, and immediately divides into two branches : (1.) The Internal Plantar A rtery is the smallest, and ramifies among the mass of muscles situated on the inner edge of the 6ole of the foot. (2.) The External Plantar Artery directs its course outwards, and having reached the metatarsal bone of the little toe, forms the Plantar Arch, which crosses the three middle metatarsal bones obliquely, about their middle, and terminates at the space be- twixt the two first metatarsal bones,where the trunk oF

( 130 ) stices of its vessels, investing the substanco of the brain, descending betwixt all its convolutions, and lining its different cavities ; but, where it lines the ventricles, it is fine, delicate, and less vascular, than on the surface, and betwixt the convolutions of the brain : It is connected to the dura mater by its veins passing into the longitudinal sinus. The brain is divided into three parts: 1. The cerebrum ; 2. The cerebellum ; 3. The medulla ob- longata, The Cerebrum consists of two distinct sub- stances : 1. The cincritious or cortical substance forming the outer part. 2. The white or medullary substance forming the inner part. The brain is divided by the falx into two hemi- spheres, and by the pia mater into numerous convo- lutions. Each hemisphere is divided into three lobes, 1. The Anterior Lobes rest on that part of the cranium which forms the two orbits, and is called the anterior fossae of the basis of the cranium. 2. The Middle Lobes are situated before and above the medulla oblongata, and rest on the middle fossae of the basis cranii, which are formed by the sphenoid and temporal bones. 3. The Posterior Lobes are supported by the tentorium. The anterior and middle lobes are partedby a deep narrow sulcus, which ascends obliquely backwards from the temporal ala of the os sphenoides to near the

( 36 ) part of the duodenum, and sends off a considerabre branch to the right extremity of the pancreas. The hepatic artery then divides into the right and left hepatic. The Right is distributed to the right lobe of the liver, and to the gall-bladder. The Lett supplies the whole of the left lobe, the lobulus Spigelii, and part of the right lobe of the liver. 3. The SuPF.mon Mesenteric Artery is a single trunk; it leaves the aorta about half an inch lower than the cccliac artery,—it comes out from un- der the mesocolon, and stretches over the duode- num ; it enters the fold of peritoneum forming the mesentery, and runs down in this, gradually incur- vating from the left to the right side. From the right side or concavity of this arch, three branches are given to the colon. (1.) A. Ileo-Coljca runs down to the caput coli and last turns of the ileum ; its branches upon the small intestines inosculate with those branches of the superior mesenteric distributed to the small in- testines in general; and on the great intestine, it inosculates with the next branch. (2.) A. Colica Dextra.—This artery runs from the root of the superior mesenteric artery, across to- wards the right side of the colon, where that intes- tine begins to rise over the kidney. (3.) A. Colica Media.—This branch goes di- rectly upwards from the trunk of the superior me- senteric, as it comes out from under the mesocolon. After running a little way upon the mesocolon, it divides; and the division going towards the right side.

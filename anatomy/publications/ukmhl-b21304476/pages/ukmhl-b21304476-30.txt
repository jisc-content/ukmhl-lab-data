( 4 ) The Bursae Mucosae met with in the dissection of the muscles are not regularly enumerated ; but it is to be understood, that wherever tendons are describ- ed as rubbing on bones, muscles, or other tendons, a sac is formed by the surrounding cellular membrane, secreting synovia, to lubricate the parts in motion. Trochanter to the great trochanter cf the os femoris. Trochin to the lesser protuberance near the head of the os humeri. Trochantin to the lesser trochanter of the os femoris. F.pitrochlSs to the internal condyle of the os humeri. T.picondyle to the external condyle of the os humeri. Phalange to the first phalanx of the fingers oes. Vhalangine to the second phalanx. Phalangette to the third phalanx. Sue, above—sous, below—prf, before. The synonyms, however, are rather to be considered as a matter of curiosity, than as names that have any chance of coming into general use. Being intended to convey a sort of anatomical description of the muscles, a great proportion of them are by far too long for names. The disadvantages of that no- menclature are pointed out by Dr. Barclay of Edinburgh, in a late work on the subjeef, a work which discovers abilities of the first order. From the specimens which this anatomist has already given, it is to be expected, that he will soon present the world with a complete list of name®, much better adapted to general use, -than any that have hitherto been employed. New terms, however, ought first to be given in the l.atin lan- guage. They would thus be more easily adopted by anatomists of all countries, and might afterwards, if necessary, be trans- lated into the various modern languages, in such a manner as would best suit the genius of each.

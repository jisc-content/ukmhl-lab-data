( 270 ) nal condyle of the os humeri; tendinous, from the lower part of the coronoid processof the ulna; fleshy, from the tubercle of the radius, from the middle of the fore-part, of that bone, and from the middle third of its outer edge. These origins form a strong fleshy mass, which sends off four tendons. The ten- dons are connected by cellular membrane, and pass together under the annular ligament of the wrist; after which they separate, become thinner and flatter, pass along the metacarpal bone and first phalanx of each of the fingers, and are Inserted into the anterior and upper part of the se- cond phalanx, each tendon being, near the extremity Â©f the first phalanx, divided for the passage of a ten- don of the flexor profundus. Situation: To expose the origin of this muscle, the bellies of the pronator teres, flexor carpi radialis, and palmaris longus, must be detached from the condyle. It arises behind these muscles, and is connected to them by intermuscular ligaments. It descends along the fore-arm under these muscles, but a part of it is seen projecting towards the inner edge of the arm, betwixt the tendons of the palmaris longus and flexor carpi ulnaris. It arises from the radius immediately below the insertion of the biceps flexor cubiti, and on the inside of the insertion of the pronator teres. Its tendons will be seen in the dissection of the palm of > the hand. Use: To bend the second joint or phalanx of the fingers. Synonyma: SublimisPerforatusEpitrochlo- coroni-phalanginien. By i

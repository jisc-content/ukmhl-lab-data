( 106 ) the belly of that muscle; and, at the lower part of the leg, the belly, is seen projecting through the ten - don of the gastrocnemius, and forming the lower calf. Its fleshy beLly is tendinous on its posterior surface, where the tendon of the gastrocnemius slides over it; and there is a bursa mneosa betwixt the upper part of the os calcis and the tendo Achiliis. Use : To elevate the cs calcis, and thereby, to lift up the whole body, as a preparatory measure to its being carried forward in progression;—to carry the leg backwards on the foot when that is fixed ;—the gastrocnemius, from its origin in the thigh, also bend3 the leg on the thigh. Synonyma; Gastrocnemius:—Bi-femoro-calca- nien. So leus :—Tibio-peronei-calcanicn. Both muscles are sometimes called Extensor Tarsi Suralis, vel Extensor Magnus. The heads of the gastrocnemius should now bo lifted up, which will expose 3. The Plantaris.—This muscle arises, fleshy, from the upper part of the external condyle, and from the oblique ridge above that condyle; forms a pyramidal belly about three inches in length, which adheres to thecapsule of the knee-joint, ruus over, ths popliteus, and terminates in a long, slender, thin, ten- don. This tendon passes obliquely inwards over the inner head of thesoleus,and under the gastrocnemius; emerges from between those two muscles, where their tendons unite, and then runs down by the insids of the tendo Achiliis, to be Inserted into the posterior part of the os calcis, on the

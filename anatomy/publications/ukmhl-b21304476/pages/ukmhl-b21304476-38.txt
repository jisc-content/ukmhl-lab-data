( 12 ) upper part of Poupart’s ligament at the part next to the os ilium. The fibres run in a radiated direction; those which originate from the back-part of the os ilium, run obliquely upwards ; those from the fore-part of the ilium pass more transversely across the belly; and from Poupart’s ligament the fibres descend. The fleshy belly is continued rather more forward than that of the external oblique, before it terminates in a flat tendon. Inserted into the cartilages of the six or seven lower ribs,—fleshy into the three inferior, and, by a tendinous expansion, which is extremely thin, re- sembling cellular membrane, into the four superior, and also into the ensiform cartilage. The sheet of tendon in which the fleshy belly ends, is continued, single and undivided, into the linea semilunaris, where, adhering pretty firmly to the tendons of the obliquus externus and transversalis, it divides into two layers. The anterior and more consider- able layer joins the tendon of the external oblique, and runs over the rectus to be inserted into the whole length of the linea alba: the posterior and thinner layer, adhering to the anterior surface of the transversalis, passes into the linea alba be- hind the rectus, as low as half-way between the umbilicus and os pubis; but below this place the whole tendon of the internal oblique passes along with that of the external oblique before the rec- tus, and is inserted into the lower part of the linea alba. The inferior edge of the muscle extends in a nearly straight direction over the spermatic chord to be

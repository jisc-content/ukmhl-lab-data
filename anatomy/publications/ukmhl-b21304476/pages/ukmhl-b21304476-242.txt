( 216 ) fibres pass along the posterior arch behind the amyg- dala;, and run backwards to the superior and lateral part of the pharynx, where they are scattered, and mixed with those of the stylo-pharyngeus. Inserted into the edge of the upper and back-part of the thyroid cartilage, and into the back-part of the phdrynx. Situation : It forms the posterior half-arch or co- lumn. Use: To draw the uvula and velum downwards and backwards, and pull the thyroid cartilage and pharynx upwards; to shut the passage into the nos- trils, and, in swallowing, to thrust the food from the fauces into the pharynx. Synonyma: Thyro-staphylinus;—Thyreo-pharyn- go-staphylinus;—Palato-pharyngien. The Salpingo-Pharyxgeus of Albinus is com- posed of a few fibres of this muscle, which arise from the anterior and lower part of the cartilaginous ex- tremity of the Eustachian tube, and are inserted into the inner part of the last-mentioned muscle. ■j. The Cikcumfeexus, or Tensor Palati—.Irises, from the spinous process of the sphenoid bone, be- hind the foramen ovale, and from the Eustachian tube near its osseous part; runs down along the pterygoideus internus, and forms a round tendon, which passes over the hook of the internal plate of / the pterygoid process of the sphenoid bone, and soon spreads into a broad tendinous expansion. Inserted into the velum pendulum palati, and semilunar edge of the os palati. Situation :

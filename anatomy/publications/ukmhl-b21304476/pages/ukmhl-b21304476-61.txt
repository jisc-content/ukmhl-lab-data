Artekia Splenica leaving the trunk of the cceliac, goes directly to the side, passes under the stomach, and along the upper border of the pancreas, running in a tortuous and serpentine course: it enters the left concave surface of the spleen in several branches, but, before doing so, it gives pff the follow- ing branches: a, Pancreaticb Parv;e to the pancreas, where it funs along the border of that viscus. b, Vasa Brevia to the bulging extremity of the stomach. c, A. Gastro-epiploica Sinistra, which runs along the greater curvature of the stomach, inoscu- lating with the gastro-epiploica dextra. (3.) Ar'teuia Hepatica runs in a direction op- posite to the splenic,.towards the right sidej but not more than half of its blood goes to the liver: It sends off the following branches : a, Pylorica, or Coronaria Dextra, some- times comes olf from the trunk of the hepatic, some- times from one of its branches;â€”reaching the py- loric end of the stomach, it sends its ramifications along the lesser curvature, to inosculate with the proper coronary artery. b, GA'TRO-kpiploica Dextra, or G astro-- duodenal is, passes under the pylorus, to reach the great curvature of the stomach, along which it runs, inosculating with the gastro-epiploica sinistra, and sending branches upwards tothestomach, and down- wards to the omentum; it also supplies the upper ^ <5 part

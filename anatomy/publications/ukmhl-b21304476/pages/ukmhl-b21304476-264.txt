( 238 ) « The Fascia Lumborum is now seen. It is a tendi-. nous fascia, arising from the lumbar vertebras and os sacrum, giving origin to the lower part of the serra- tus posticus inferior, and to the posterior fibres of the obliquus internus and transversalis abdominis. It is also connected with the tendon of the latissimus dorsi. On detaching from the spine of this fascia, and the serratus posticus inferior, we expose a thick muscular mass, filling up all the space betwixt the spinous pro- cesses of the vertebrae, and the angles of the ribs. This mass consists of three muscles: (1.) Sacro-Lumbalis on the outside, (2.) Longissimus Dorsi in the middle, (3.) Spinalis Dorsi close to the spinous processes. These three muscles are closely connected toge- ther ; so that, to effect their feeparation, it is neces- sary to divide some of the fibres. 9 and 10, The Sacro-Lumbalis and Loncis-- siml'S Dorsi—Arise, by one common origin, ten- dinous externally, and fleshy, internally, from the spinous processes and posterior surface of the os sacrum ; from the posterior part of the spine of tl o os ilium, extending nearly as far forwards as the highest part of that bone when the body is erect; from the spinous processes, and from the roots of the transverse processes of all the lumbar vertebrae. The thick fleshy belly, formed by this extensive origin, ascends, and, opposite to the last rib, divides into the two muscles. * / The saero-lumbalis is inserted into all the ribs near their angles, by long and thin tendons. The tendons which o

( 2« ) vertebra:, by five tendinous and fleshy slips, and is Inserted, tendinous, into the transverse processes of the five or six inferior cervical vertebrae. Situation : The origin of this muscle lies on the inside of the longissimus dorsi, and is sometimes considered as an appendage to it. The insertion is situated between the cervicalis descendens and tra- chelo-mastoideus. Use; To turn the neck obliquely backwards, and a little to one side. Synonymh: Transversalis cervicis ;—Transversalis colli major. 14. The Trachelo-Mastoideus lies nearer to the bone than the last-described muscle. Arises from the transverse processes of the three uppermost vertebrae of the back, and of the five in- ferior of the neck, by as many thin tendons, which unite and form a fleshy belly. Inserted, tendinous, into the posterior surface of the mastoid process. Situation : This muscle lies on the outside of the complexus,andon the inside ofthe transversaliscolli; its insertion is concealed by the 6plenius capitis; it is covered also by the levator scapulae. Use: To keep the head and neck erect, and tto draw the head backwards, and to one side. Synonyma: Trachelo-mastoideus, seu Capitis par tertium Fallopij;—Complexus minor, seu Mastoides lateralis. 15. The Complexus—Arises, by tendinous and fleshy fibres, from the transverse processes of the L seven

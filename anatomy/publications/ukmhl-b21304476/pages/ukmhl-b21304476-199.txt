( ns ) the clavicle. The latter method is preferable, as it allows us to examine more readily the great vessels passing out of the thorax. On looking under the sternum, while it is lifted up, we see the Mediastinum, separating, as it is gra- dually torn from theposteriorsurtace ol the sternum, into two layers, and thus forming a triangular catitv. This cavity is artificially produced, and is entirely owing to the method ot raising the sternum. When the sternum is laid back or remo\ed, the following parts are to be observed: The Mediastinum, now collapsed, dividing the thorax into two distinct cavities, of which the right is the largest. The lungs of each side lying distinct in these \ cavities. The Pericardium, containing the heart, situated in the middle of the thorax, between the two laminae of the mediastinum, and protruding into the left side. The internal surface of the pleura, smooth, co- lourless, and glistening, lining the ribs, and reflected over the lungs. 1. The b l k u r a .—Each side of the thorax has its particular pleura:—The pleurae are like two blad- ders, situated laterally with respect to each other ; by adhering together in themiddle of the thorax,and passing obliquely* from the posterior surface of the * They run obliquely, not being in general at ached to the middle of the sternum, but towards its leftside, especially at the lower part of the bone, near the diaphragm. Besides the pericardium, the mediastinum contains betwixt its lamina: some adipose membrane and absorbent glands. II 3 sternum

( 90 ) from under the pyriformis, betwixt the lower edge of that muscle and the superior socro sciatic ligament; it lies upon the back-part of the hip, under the glu- teus maximus;—its principal branches descend be- tween the trochanter major and tuberosity of the ischium; it sends other twigs round towards the anus and perineum. Both these arteries inosculate with the other branches of the internal and external iliac. The Vci.vs correspond exactly to the arteries. They terminate in the internal iliac vein. N EHVJis. Nervus Sciaticus, vel Ischiaticus, or the (heat Sciatic Nerve, is seen coming out of the pelvis, along with the sciatic artery, below the pyriformis. It descends over the gemini and quadratus femoris in the hollow betwixt the great trochanter and the tube- rosity of the ischium,—runs down the back-part of the thigh, anterior to, i. c. nearer the bone than the hamstring muscles; being situated between the ante- rior surface of the semimembranosus, and the poste- rior surface of the triceps adductor longus. After sending off the peroneal nerve, it arrives in the ham, aud bCcopies the Popliteal Nerve. In this course t it gives off several branches to the muscles and inte- guments. It sometimes perforates the belly of the pyriformis by distinct trunks, which afterwards unite.. SECTi

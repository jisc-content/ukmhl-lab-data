'{â€¢ 210 ) nerve and one or two veins. (?,.) A. Pterygoidea; and A. Temporales Profunda;, arc small branches of the internal maxillary which pass to the pterygoid muscles, and to the inner part of the temporal mus- cle. (4s) A. Pharyngeac, branches to the pharynx, palate, and base of the skull. (5.) A. Alvcolaris, whicirgives branches to the teeth of the upper jaw, and to the jaw bone itself. (6 ) A Branch through the foramen spheno-palatinum to the."nose; and, (7.) An Artery through the palato-maxillary canal to the palate. The continued trunk of the internal maxillary en- ters the orbit by the spheno-maxillary slit. It sends off a branch which runs along the inner side of the.^ orbit, and passes out at the inner canthus of the eye on the forehead. The artery itself runs along the bottom of the orbit in a canal on the upper part of the great tuberosity of the os maxillare superius, and emerges by the foramen infra-orbitarium on the face; hence it is termed A. Infra-Orbitaria, and is distributed to the check and side of the nose. / The Fro nt a l A rt e r y is also seen in the dissec- tion of the face, passing from the orbit through the foramen supra-orbitarium to be distributed to the forehead. This artery is sent off from the ophthal- mic artery, which is a branch of the internal corotid. If the face be injected, a remarkable anastomosis of arteries will be observed at the inner ankle of the eye. VEINS.

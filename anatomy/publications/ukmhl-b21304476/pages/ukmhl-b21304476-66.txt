/ ( » ) do not join the cava, but are united behind; the pancreas, to form the Vena Port®. This vein minifies anew through the liver, and its blood is returned into the vena cava by the vena; cav® hepa- tic®. Although the trunks just enumerated are the chief veins that contribute to form the vena port®, yet the returning veins of all the viscera enclosed in the peritoneum, except the liver, are included in the same system, and join one or other of the large trunks. This is the case with the stomach, pan- creas, gall-bladder, and omentum. The blood which goes to the spleen, large and small intes- tines, is all returned by the three great trunks. 3. NERVES. 1. The eighth pair, or Par Vagum, descending on each side of the oesophagus through the diaphragm, forms the two Stomachic Plexuses on the ante- rior and posterior surfaces of the stomach. These plexuses send some branches to the cceliac, to the hepatic, and to the splenic plexus. 2. The Splanchnic Nerve, or Anterior Inter- costal, a branch sent off by the intercostal nerve in the thorax, enters the abdomen betwixt the crura of the diaphragm; here each nerve forms a Semi- lunar Ganglion by the side of the cceliac artery. . 5 Iroaa The Superior Mesen- teric Vain, the Inferior Mesf.nteric Vein, and the Splenic Vein,

( 112 ) of the anterior tibial artery joins the arch. The con- vexity of this arch is towards the toes, and sends off the following branches. a, A small branch to the outside of the little toe. b, Ramus digitalis primus, or the first digital arte- ry, which runs along the space between the two last metatarsal bones, and bifurcates into two branches, one to the inner side of the little toe, and the other to the outer side of the next toe. c, The second digital artery, which runs along the next interosseous space, and bifurcates in a similar manner. (I, The third digital artery. e, The fourth, or great digital artery, which supplies the great toe, and the inner side of the toe next to it. The concavity of the arch sends off the interosseal arteries, three or four small twigs,which go to the deep- seated parts in the sole of the foot, and, perforating be- tween the metatarsal bones, inosculate with the supe- rior interosseal arteries on the upper side of the foot. The branches of the Posterior Tibial Artery in the leg are, 1. The Peroneal Artery, which comes off from the tibial a little after it has sent off the anterior ti- bial, of which this artery is sometimes a branch; it is generally of a considerable size, sometimes nearly as large as the tibial itself; it runs upon the inside of the fibula, giving numerous branches to the peroneal muscles and flexor of the great toe; but its course is irregular and inconstant. At the lower part of the leg, it splits into, 0, A. Pekonea Anterior, which passes betwixt ' â€¢ tin.

( 213 ) Use: To extend the neck obliquely backwards. Synonyma: Spinalis cervicis;—Transverso-spi- nali colli. 17- Skmi-spinalis Dorsi—Arises from the transverse processes of the seventh, eighth, and ninth vertebrae of the back, by distinct tendons which soon grow fleshy. Inserted, by distinct tendons, into the spinous pro- cesses of the five superior dorsal vertebra;, and of the two lower cervical. Situation : This muscle lies nearer the spine than the lower part of the semi-spinalis colli ; its inferior origins lie on the outside of the insertion of the spi- nalis dorsi. Use: To extend the spine obliquely backwards. Synonyma; Semi-spinalis externus, seu Trans- verso-spinalis dorsi. The removal of the complexus brings also into view several small muscles situated at the superior part of the neck, immediately below the occiput. 18. The Rectus Capitis Posticus Major— Arises, fleshy, from the side of the spinous process of the dentata, or second cervical vertebrae. It ascends obliquely outwards, becoming broader, and is Inserted, tendinous and fleshy, into the inferior transverse ridge of the os occipitis, and into part of the concavity above that ridge. Situation : This muscle is situated obliquely be- tween the occiput and the second vertebra of the neck. It lies under the complexus ; its outer fibres also pass under the Insertion of the obliquus capitis superior. L 2 Use:

( 228 ) twigs also pass to the eye-lids, and to the inner an- gle of the eye. I he Arteria frontalis is a branch ol this artery ; it is seen running towards the supra- oioitary notch or foramen, and is distributed to the forehead. The Infua-Orhitary Artery is found in the lower part of the orbit; it is the continued t'.unk of the internal maxillary, entering the orbit by the spheno-maxillary slit. It is seen passing along the canal in the upper part of the great tuberosity of the os maxillare superius, and emerges on the face by the infra-orbitary hole. veins. These correspond with the arteries; they discharge their blood partly into the branches of the external , jugular vein near the forehead and temples, and partly into the internal jugular. t N EKV ES. 1. The Optic Nerve is seen coming through t-he foramen opticum, aud entering the. back-najt of the globe of the eye, to form the retina. 2. The Nerve of the Third Pair, Motor Ocuu, having entered the orbit through the superior orbi- tary fissure, or {oilmen lacerum, is divided into four branches. (1.) The first runs upwards, and subdivides-into two nerves, of which one supplies the levator oculi, and the other the levator palpebrae superioris. (2.) The second branch goes to the depressor oculis, and is short. ; (3.) Ihe i

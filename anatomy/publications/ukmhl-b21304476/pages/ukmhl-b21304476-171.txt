( 14.5 ) considerable medullary fasciculi, proceeding frera the centre of the medulla of the brain, more imme- diately from the corpora striata; they unite at an acute angle, and are united to the pons Varolii*. The Crura or Pedunculi Cereeelli are very large, and pass from the medullary part of the cere- bellum which forms the arbor vitue to the pons Va- rolii. The Pons Varolii, Tuber Annulare, or Nodus Cerebri, is a medullary protuberance, formed by thp union of the crura cerebri and cerebelli, over which it is stretched like a bridge; on its surface is a raphe, or transverse fibres passing into a middle longitudinal narrow depression. Below the pons Varolii, and separated from it by a sulcus, are seen four eminences: 1. The two external are named Corpora Oli- VARI A. 2. The two internal arc named Corpora Pyra- miualia, and, by separating these two bodies, me- dullary .cords, passing transversely, appear, the nervi intercerebrales. The point of union betwixt the corpora pyrami- dalia and pons Varolii, is sometimes called foramen caecum. The medulla oblongata now contracts itself, and, passing through the forameH magnum occipitale, assumes the name of * Oil making a section of the crura cerebri, near to their union Â«itli the pons Varolii, a portion of a dark-brown colour, surrounded with while medullary substance, is seen, termed Locus Niger Crurum Cerebri.

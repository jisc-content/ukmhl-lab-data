Situation: T his muscle is situated between the clavicle and sternum, concealed by the pectoralis major, and anterior part of the deltoides. Use: To draw the clavicle downwards and for- wards, and perhaps to elevate the first rib. Synonyma: Costo-claviculaire. Having lifted up the pectoralis minor from its ori- gin, the situation of the subclavian vessels which pass under the clavicle, and over the first rib, njay be seen. (See the dissection of the Axilla.) SECT. II. OF THE PARTS CONTAINED WITHIN THE CAVITY OF THE THORAX. The cavity of the thorax may now be opened, by cutting through the cartilages of the ribs on each side, and separating the lower part of the sternum from the diaphragm. That bone must then be lifted upwards, and the first and second parts of which it is composed divided by an incision along the inner surface of their junction; or the whole sternum may be removed, by separating it at its articulations with the

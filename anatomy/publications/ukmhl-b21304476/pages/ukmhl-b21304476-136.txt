( no ) ligament; from the angles of the bones to which that ligament is attached ; and from the flat surface of the fibula behind its internal angle for more than two-thirds of its length. The fibres run obliquely towards a middle tendon, which, becoming round, passes behind the inner ankle through a groove in the tibia. Inserted into the upper and inner part of the os noviculare, being further continued through a groove in that bone to the internal and external cuneiforme bones; it also sends some tendinous filaments to the os calcis, the os cuboides, and the bases of the meta- tarsal bones supporting the second and middle toe. Situation This muscle may be said to arise from the tibia and fibula before the interosseous ligament, as its fibres fill up a perforation in the upper extre- mity of that ligament. The belly is concealed at its lower part by the flexor longus digitorum and flexor pollicis, and cannot be seen till those muscles are se- parated; but a part of it is discovered above the upper extremity of these muscles, and immediately below the fibres of the popliteus; and this part must lie under the anterior surface of tiiesoleus. The tendon crosses under that of the flexor longus digitorum above the ankle, and, wltere it passes through the groove in the tibia, is situated more forward than the , tendon of that muscle. It it thickened w here it runs through the groove of the os naviculare; and its in- sertion lies close in contact with the bones, and is concealed by the muscles in the sole of the foot. Use: To extend the foot, and turn it inwards.. Synonyma : Tibio-tarsien. \ VESSELS

( 226 ) between the insertion of the levator oculi, and the entrance of the optic nerve. Use: To roll the globe of the eye, and turn the pupil downwards and outwards. Synonyma : Obliquus major;—Optico-trochlci- scleroticien. 7. TheOBLiQUUs Inf prior—Arises, narrow, and principally tendinous, from the outer edge of the orbitar process of the superiocmaxillary bone, near its junction with the os unguis. It runs obliquely outwards and backwards, under the depressor oculi, and is Inserted, by a broad thin tendon, into the sclero- tica,*between the entrance of the optic nerve, and the insertion of the abductor oculi. Use: To draw the globe of the eye forwards, in- wards, and downwards, and to turn the pupil up- wards. Synonyma: Oliquus major ;—Maxillo-scleroti- c:en. In the orbit, we also meet with the Lachrymal Gland.—This gland is of a yellowish colour; it is situated in a depression of the os fronds near the temple. It adheres closely to the fat which sur- rounds the muscles and posterior convexity of the eye. It sends off several small ducts which pierce the tunica conjunctiva lining the upper eye-lid; these ducts cannot be seen, unless the part be macerated in water, when they are filled with the liquid. The Functa Laciirymaha are two small holes near the internal angle of the palpebrae, situated one in each eye-lid. They lead into the Lachrymal Sac.

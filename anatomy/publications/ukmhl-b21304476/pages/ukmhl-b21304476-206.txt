( 180 ) 5. A. Mammaria Interna. The internal mam- mary arises from the fore-part of the subclavian opposite the cartilage of the first rib ; it runs clown on the inside of the cartilages of the ribs, and ter- minates in the abdominal muscles, where it inoscu- lates with the epigastric. It is a large artery, and its branches are very numerous. They pass to the external muscles of the chest, to the intercostal muscles, pleura, &c. It also sends off the Arteria Phrenica Superior, vel conies nervi phrenici, which, with two veins, accompanies the phrenic nerve to the diaphragm. 6. The subclavian artery gives twigs to tbe root of the neck, and to the muscles about the scapula. 7. A. Intercosta lis Superior. Frequently a trunk conies off from the subclavian, especially on the right side, which passes downwards and back- wards, and lodges itself by the spine, to supply the two or three supeiior intercostal spaces. COURSE OF THE SUBCLAVIAN VEIN. The subclavian vein is situated anteriorly to the subclavian artery ; it passes inwards behind and un- der the subclaviufi muscle, and before and over the belly of the anterior scalenus, (so that this last mus- cle lies betwixt the vein and artery.) It runs over the first rib, from under the arch of the pectoralie minor, where it is found in contact with the axillary artery, and is called the Axillary Vein. The branches of this vein accompany and corre- spond to the ramifications of the subclavian artery, returning

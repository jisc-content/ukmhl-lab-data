( 105 } Reflect the two heads of the gastrocnemius from ' the femoral condyles, and you will then expose 2. The Soleus, or Gastjiucnemius Internets— which arises, by two origins or heads. The first, or External Origin, which is by much the largest, arises, principally fleshy, from the posterior surface of the head of the fibula, and from the external angle of that bone, for two thirds of its length, immediately behind the peroneus longus. The second, or internal head, arises, flehy, from an oblique ridge on the pos- terior surface of the tibia, just below the popliteus, and from the inner angle of that bone, during the middle third of its length. The two heads which are separated at first by the posterior tibial artery and nerve, unite immediately, form a large belly, which, covered by the tendon of the gastrocnemius, is con- tinued, fleshy, to within a short distance of the ankle- joint; a little above which the tendons of the gas- trocnemius and soleus unite, and form a strong round tendon, named the Tendo Achillis, which slides over the upper and posterior part of the os calcis, where it is furnished with a small bursa mucosa, to be Inserted into a rough surface on the back-part of that bone. '' Situation: The gastrocnemius arises between the hamstring-tendons: Its belly is superficial, and forms the upper or greater calf of the leg ; on lifting it up, the tendon is seen continued some way on its inner • surface. The soleus has its largest part concealed by the gastrocnemius, but part of it appears on each side of E 5 the

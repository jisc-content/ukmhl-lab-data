( 39 ) The 2. VEINS. The Vjena Cava Abdominalis, vel Inferior, is formed by the junction of the two common iliac veins, it passes up through the abdomen on the lum- bar vertebrae, and on the right side of the aorta. In this course it receives the following veins, whichr resemble their corresponding arteries : 1. The Lumbar Veins. 2. The Emulgent or Renal Veins;—the left is the longest, as it crosses over the fore-part of the aorta. 3. The Right Spermatic Vein ;—the left enters the left renal vein. The vena cava then passes through the fissure of the liver, being nearly surrounded by that viscus, and receiving three branches from it, called tha Ven;e Hepatic.®, It then perforates the dia- phragm, and enters the thorax. The common iliac vein of each side is formed by the union of two branches, the External and In- ternal Iliac Veins, which accompany the arte- ries of the same name:—The common iliac vein of each side lies on the inside of its artery; hence both veins cross behind the right iliac artery, to unite and form the vena cava, on the fore-part of the lumbar vertebrae *. * It may be here proper to observe, that generally a great vein accompanies every great artery ; but when the ramifica- tions become small, each-artery is attended by two veins.

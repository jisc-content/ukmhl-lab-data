( 297 ) is the smallest branch. It passes through the upper part of the interosseous ligament, to supply the mus- cles on the posterior part of the fore-arm. It sends off the A. Recurrens Interossea, which ramifies on the middle of the back-part of the elbow-joint. (2.) The internal or anterior interosseous artery descends close upon the middle of the interosseous li- gament, betwixt the flexor longus pollicis and flexor profundus perforans, giving twigs to the adjacent muscles. Arriving at the upper edge of the pronator quadrates, it perforates betwixt the radius and ulna to the back-part of the arm, and spreads its extreme branches on the wrist and back of the hand. VEINS. The cutaneous veins have been already described. The brachial artery is accompanied by two veins, named Venae Comites, or Satellites. These receive branches corresponding to the ramifications of the artery. NERVES. In the dissection ofthe axilla, we demonstrated the great axillary plexus, and traced its twofirstbranches, the external scapular and circumflex nerves. The distribution of the five remaining branches of the plexus must now be described. (3.) The External Cutaneous Nerve, (Mus- culo-cutaneus, or Perforans Casserii,) is the third branch ofthe axillary plexus. It passes through the belly of the caraco-brachialis muscle. After its pas- sage it continues its course obliquely across the arm, betwixt the Biceps flexor cubiti and the Brachialis iii tern ws. Itgives twigs to these muscles, and appears as f

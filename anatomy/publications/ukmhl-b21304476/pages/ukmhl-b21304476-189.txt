( 163 ) The external carotid immediately begins to send eff branches. Anteriorly it sends off, 1. The A. Thyroidea Superior.—This artery passes downwards and forwards, to ramify on the thyroid glands, where it inosculates with the artery of the other side, and with the inferior thyroid ar- teries. In this course, it sends ramifications to the integuments, the outside of the larynx, the muscles &c. and one remarkable branch, the A. Laryngea, which sometimes arises from the trunk of the exter- nal carotid ; it is a small artery which divides betwixt the os hyoides and thyroides cartilages, to supply the internal parts of the larynx. 2. A. Lingualis, vel Ilanina—The sublingual artery passes over the cornu of the os hyoides, then behind the mylo-hyoideus, over the stylo-glossus, hyo-glossus, and genio-hyo-glossus, to which it gives branches, and terminates in running along the infe- rior part of the tongue from its base to its apex. It gives branches, to the muscles about the chin, and, to the substance and back-part of the tongue. 3. A. Maxillaris Externa The external maxillary artery passes under the stylo-hoideus and posterior belly of the digastricus, then buries itself under thesubraaxillary gland. It runs over the lower jaw before the anterior edge of the masseter muscle, to supply the face. In its passage, it gives off numerous branches.—. One is worthy of notice, which runs,along under the line of the lower jaw, and passing over the jaw near the \

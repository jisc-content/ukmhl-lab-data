If the reader remember the name of the Author of a paper on a given subject, he will probably find it convenient to refer to the Authors' Catalogue rather than to the Subject Catalogue. In the Authors' Catalogue the numbers placed within square brackets at the end of each entry are Registration numbers, and serve to indicate the scope of each paper indexed. The meaning of these numbers will at once be found by reference to the Schedule. In case the abbreviated titles of Journals are not understood, a key to these is provided at the end of the volume.

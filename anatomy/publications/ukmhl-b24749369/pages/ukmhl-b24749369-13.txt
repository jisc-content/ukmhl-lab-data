above mentioned, a translation into one of these five languages is added. In such cases the actual title is printed first, and is followed bj the translation within square brackets. It was provided by the original scherae that the Catalogue should comprise all original contributions to the branches of science which come within its scope, whether these had been published in periodicals, or in the journals of societies, or as independent pamphlets, memoirs, or books. In order that a scientific investigator might be in a position to ascertain by means of the Catalogue what has from time to time been published concerning each particular subject of inquiry, it was held to be of great importance that not only the titles of papers but their subject matter also should be indexed. As stated above, however, financial considerations have led to the number of subject-entries being at present limited in number. But the expense of making subject-entries would be very greatly reduced if all periodicals adopted a practice already carried out by some journals, namely, that of indexing each paper at the time of its publication. Indeed, were this carefully done, the Bureaus preparing- the Catalogue would no longer have to study the contents of papers in order to prepare the subject-entiies, and the saving thereby effected would make it possible to enlarge the scope of the Catalogue, until it include all original scientific communications. Seeing how necessary such a complete subject catalogue is for the progress of science, it is hoped that all editors and authors will co-operate in so preparing subject-indexes for all papers at the time of their publication.

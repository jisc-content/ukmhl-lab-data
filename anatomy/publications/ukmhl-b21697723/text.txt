The Anatomical Museum in the University of Edinburgh con- sisted originally of the private collection formed by Professor Alexander Monro primus. It was largely added to by his son, Professor Alexander Monro secundus, who, in the year 1798, presented his own collection of anatomical preparations, together with that of his father, to the University, in the following terms:—“ I, Alexander Monro, Pro- fessor of Medicine, Anatomy, and Surgery in the University of Edinburgh, hereby give and bequeath to the said University, for ever, my whole collection of anatomical preparations, with all the vessels and cabinets in which they are contained in the several rooms connected with the Anatomical Theatre, to be used by myself and my eldest son, my colleague, during our lives, and after our decease by our future successors in office, for the purpose of demonstrating and explaining to the students of the University the structure, physiology, and diseases of the human body.” Accompanying the collection was a manuscript catalogue consisting of three folio volumes, compiled under the direction of Dr Alexander Monro secundus. After the accession of Dr Alexander Monro tertius to the Chair of Anatomy, additional accommodation was provided for the Museum, then located in the University Buildings in the South Bridge. The collection in the course of years had been materially added to, and the Museum was thrown open to the students of the University and to the medical profession. As a manuscript catalogue was not well adapted for reference, it was decided to print a catalogue of the collection, so as to render the Museum more instructive to its visitants. The work of prepar- ing the catalogue for the press was entrusted to Mr William Mackenzie, Fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons of England, who at that time was both Conservator of the Museum and Demonstrator of Anatomy with Professor Monro. The Catalogue was published in 1829, with the title of “The Descriptive CatalogueVI PREFACE. of the Anatomical Museum of the University of Edinburgh.” It should be noticed that in the catalogue the specimens were arranged in groups, each being distinguished by an initial letter, and the specimens were arranged numerically each in its own group. Prior to the resignation of Professor Monro tertius^ Mr John Goodsir was appointed Conservator of the Museum, and in 1846 he succeeded to the Chair of Anatomy. Great additions were made to the number of specimens in the Museum during his con- servatorship and in the earlier years of his professorship, especially to illustrate the Comparative Anatomy of the Vertebrata and Invertebrata. Dr T. Spencer Cobbold was appointed, under the direction of Professor Goodsir, to catalogue the collection of Comparative Anatomy, and the specimens were arranged in physiological groups, after the plan pursued in the Hunterian Collection in the Museum of the Royal College of Surgeons of England. It was also decided to rewrite the catalogue of the Pathological collection, and to incorporate the additions made in recent years. This duty was entrusted to Dr Spencer Cobbold. Instead of following the method pursued in Mr Mackenzie’s Descriptive Catalogue of indicating each group by an initial letter, and numbering the specimens in that group consecutively, a continu- ous enumeration was adopted, and two thousand seven hundred and sixty-one pathological specimens were catalogued. In 1859, Sir David Monro, M.D., presented a collection of anatomical preparations, which had formed the private collection of his father. Professor Monro iertius. On the death of Professor Goodsir, in 1867, the Senatus purchased his private collection, and added it to the Museum. In 1896, Dr D. Argyll Robertson, University Lecturer on Ophthalmology, presented and catalogued his valuable collection to illustrate Diseases of the Eye, Eyelids, and Orbit. The Medical School having outgrown the accommodation provided for it in the University Buildings, South Bridge, new and commodious buildings were erected in Teviot Place in 1880 and subsequent years. In 1884, a large Museum, designed by Sir R. Rowand Anderson in consultation with the Professor of Anatomy, Sir William Turner, was completed and the entirePREFACE. Vll collection was transferred to it. The Upper Gallery of the Museum was appropriated for the display of the Pathological specimens. As more favourable opportunities were now given for their study, it became evident that a manuscript catalogue, con- structed on a continuous numerical system, was cumbrous and ill adapted for the use of the students. Consultations then took place between the Conservator, Professor Turner, and the Professor of Pathology, Professor Greenfield, regard- ing the preparation of a new catalogue to be subsequently printed. It was decided to revert in some respects to the method employed in the Descriptive Catalogue published in 1829, to indicate each group of diseases by a distinctive letter or letters, and to adopt for each group its own numerical arrangement. Professor Greenfield kindly undertook to select the titles for the groups and sub-groups. It was also decided to include in the printed catalogue a description of the specimens which belonged to the Museum attached to the former class of Military Surgery, now the property of the University. This collection consisted of two parts, first the preparations made by Sir Rutherford Alcock during the service of the “British Legion of Spain; ” and secondly, the collection formed by Sir George Ballingall, the Professor of Military Surgery from 1823 to 1856, when the Chair was abolished. Mr H. Alexis Thomson, M.D., F.R.C.S., was requested to under- take the description of the preparations illustrating the diseases of the Organs of Motion and Locomotion, which occupies one hundred and fourteen pages of the printed Catalogue. The Conservators desire to express their obligations to him for the time and care which he bestowed in cataloguing the specimens to illustrate this important group of diseases. The sections on the diseases of the Nervous, Circulatory, Alimentary and Respiratory Systems were revised by Professor Greenfield with the assistance of Dr E. Christison Carter, and the section on the Genito-Urinary System, pp. 253 to 298, was compiled by Dr W. E. Carnegie Dickson, partly from descriptions revised by Professor Greenfield, and partly after microscopic observations made by himself. The Calculi were analysed in 1856 by Edmund Atkinson, Ph.D., and William Turner, at that time Demonstrator of Anatomy, and were catalogued by the latter.PREFACE. Vlll The section on Tumours was revised by Dr Lindsay Steven Milne, who likewise determined their microscopic structure. He also catalogued from preparations, mounted and provisionally arranged by Mr James Simpson, the Entozoa in the section on Parasites. In 1903 Sir William Turner presented the anatomical collection which he had formed during his tenure of the Chair of Anatomy. In 1908 the University Court purchased one half of the collection formed by Professor Annandale, the other half having been acquired for the Museum of the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh. The specimens from this collection belonging to the University have been described by Dr L. *C. Peel Ritchie. Owing to the sheets preceding the section on Diseases of the Skin having been printed off, only the specimens in and subsequent to that section could be included in this edition of the Catalogue. The specimens are arranged on the shelves of the Museum in strict accordance with the arrangement in the Catalogue. The other figures in brackets, which appear on a large number of the specimens, are the numbers in the manuscript catalogue prepared by Dr Cobbold. Sir William Turner has acted as general Editor of this Volume. The cost of preparing the Catalogue has in part been defrayed by a grant from the Carnegie Trustees. WM. TURNER, ) ^ V Conservators. D.

First, at its middle, with deformed union from overriding of the fragments and an elongated process of bone, continued downwards from the upper fragment, which lies in front and to the inner side of the lower. Secondly, the lower part of the shaft is broken both longitudinally and obliquely.12 FRACTURES OF THE LOWER EXTREMITY. Os. B. e. 29 (Y 7)- A comminuted fracture of the shaft of the femur at its lower third, probably caused by a gunshot injury; partial necrosis of several of the fragments has occurred, and at the same time imperfect union of the other fragments to the shaft above and below by new bone. The injury was evidently followed by suppurative inflammation in the parts involved. Os. B. e. 30 (135)* The lower half of a right femur, shewing a stalactitic mass of callus, associated with the repair of a com- pound fracture, in which suppurative inflammation supervened. Os. B. e. 31 (103). A fracture of the shaft of the right femur in its upper third ; united without any deformity. Os. B. e. 32 (104). A fracture of the shaft of the left femur at the lower third. Angular union has occurred, with backward dis- placement of the lower fragment and partial overriding. The head of the bone shews changes characteristic of arthritis deformans. Os. B. e. 33 (104a). A preparation in spirit of an oblique fracture of the lower part of the shaft of the femur in a young subject, cut in vertical section.

Os. B. e. 37 (108). An oblique fracture of the shaft of the left femur in its middle third ; united with overriding, the upper fragment lying in front and to the outer side of the lower. The compact bone of the upper fragment is much thicker than that of the lower, this being probably the result of tearing across of the nutrient artery. Os. B. e. 38 (109 and no). The opposite half of the preceding specimen. Os. B. e. 39 (III). A fracture of the shaft of a left femur at its lower third; united. This specimen is cut in longitudinal section, and the line of union is demonstrated by the internal or myelogenic callus occupying the medullary canal. The head of the bone shews changes like those seen in arthritis deformans.FRACTURES OF THE LOWER EXTREMITY. 3 Os. B. e. 40 (iim). A comminuted fracture of the shaft of a femur through its lower third. Deformed union has resulted from overriding of the fragments. Os. B. e. 41 (lI2).

Os. B. e. 44(ii6). A transverse fracture of the shaft of a femur in its middle third. Deformed union has occurred from overriding of the fragments for 5 cm. or more. The specimen is cut in longitudinal section to shew the manner in which the open end of the medullary canal has been covered in by new bone in each of the fragments. Os. B. e. 45 (II7). A fracture of the shaft of the femur of a Cat at its lower end ; united, with overriding of the fragments and a large amount of ensheathing callus. Os. B. e. 46 (118).

T he bones of the right knee-joint; there is a transverse comminuted fracture of the femur above the condyles, with partial union and alteration of the articular surfaces from dis- organisation of the joint. The fracture was probably compound, and caused a suppurative arthritis in the knee. Os. B. e. 48 (119a). A transverse Fracture of the left Patella; the fragments are united by a band of fibrous tissue 5 cm. in length, which, in the dried state, is in the form of a thin aponeurosis. Os. B. e. 49 (120). A transverse fracture of the patella; the fragments are united by fibrous tissue of great thickness and density, there being an interval of 2*5 cm. between the frag- ments. Os.

'There is considerable deformity from the angular displacement of the different fragments. Os. B. e. 53 (I22). A tibia and fibula, shewing several fractures, which were probably caused by falling from a height on to the feet. The tarsal extremities of both bones are smashed into pieces. 'I'he shaft of the tibia is also broken through the junc- tion of its middle and lower thirds, the line of fracture running obliquely from behind, downwards and forwards ; it would appear that the sharp lower end of the upper fragment pierced the skin, making the fracture a compound one, for changes resulting from suppurative inflammation are to be seen along the edges of both fragments and on the adjacent periosteal surfaces. There is another fracture at the extreme upper end of the fibula; here the upper end of the lower fragment has been driven by the violent impact for some little distance into the substance of the head of the bone. Os. B. e. 54(123). ^ beautiful specimen of compound com- minuted fracture of the tibia through the middle of its shaft, fol- lowed by suppurative inflammation. A large fragment of the bone has perished, and appears as a loose sequestrum lying in the interval between the broken ends of the shaft. The latter are surrounded by a considerable mass of new bone, which unites them to the fibula. Os. B. e. 55 (124). The tibia and fibula of the right side fractured through the lower third of their shafts, and united with over- lapping of the fragments. The fibula is broken at a higher level than the tibia. Os. B. e. 56 (125)* The bones from a very severe case of com- minuted fracture of the leg, probably produced by falling on the feet from a height; the fracture was probably rendered compound by penetration of the skin by the fragments. Suppurative in- flammation supervened, and a large portion of the tibial shaft has perished, and is seen as a discoloured sequestrum embedded in the new bone uniting the various fragments together. Os. B. e.,57 (126). A compound fracture of the lower end of the fibula, with suppuration and elevation of the periosteum in part, and consequent exfoliation of the compact outer shell of the upper fragment. The arteries have been injected. Os. B. e. 58 (127). A tibia and fibula; the former has been frac- tured immediately above the ankle-joint, the latter about 7^5 cm. higher up; the two bones have become united to each other by bone both at the site of the fibular fracture and imme- diately below the head of the fibula.

A comminuted fracture of the lower ends of the tibia and fibula extending into the ankle-joint. Suppuration and disorganisation of the joint has followed, with anchylosis of the fractured bones. The injury was probably caused by falling on the feet from a height. Os. B. e. 65 (Y 9). A fracture of the shaft of the fibula through its middle third. The site of the fracture is indicated by the ensheathing callus. Os. B. e. 66 (134)- A fracture of the fibula of a child at its upper fourth. A section has been made of the bone to shew the ensheathing callus. Os. B. e. 67 (136). A fracture of the extreme lower end of a fibula, breaking off the external malleolus. The fragment has united in good position. Os. B. e. 68 (137)* A comminuted fracture of the tibia and fibula just above the ankle-joint, with splitting of the tibia into the joint. Union has occurred with deformity and anchylosis of the bones along the interosseous space. Os. B. e. 69 (138). The bones of the right leg with the astragalus and os calcis. The tibia and fibula are broken across at their lower thirds, the fibula at a slightly higher level than the tibia. The fragments of the tibia are rounded off, with the medullary canal closed in, a considerable gap remaining between them. The fibula is united, with overriding and shortening. Os. B. e. 70 (139). A compound fracture of the tibia into the ankle-joint, and of the fibula in its lower fourth. Suppuration and disorganisation of the joint has followed, with anchylosis of the astragalus and os calcis. The fractures are partially united. The injury was probably caused by a fall on the feet, driving the astragalus upwards, and splitting the tibia after the fashion of a wedge.i6 FRACTURES OF THE LOWER EXTRExMITY. Os. B. e. 71 (140).

[The following specimens belong to the collection of the late Sir George Bal- lingall, the last Professor of Military Surgery in the University. The preparations marked with the letter A were made by Mr Rutherford Alcock during the service of “ the British Legion of Spain.” Those marked with the letter B were collected by Sir George Ballingall himself. For further information regarding the specimens, reference may be made to the printed Catalogues of “ the Museum attached to the Class of Military Surgery in the University of Edinburgh.”] Gtmshot Injuries of the Head and Face. Os. B. f. 1 (A 6). A portion of the Frontal bone with an irregular perforation caused by a musket-ball. The aperture is larger on the inner than on the outer side. Os. B. f. 2 (A 7). A portion of the Parietal bone, with a cleanly- cut circular perforation caused by a musket-ball; a fissure ex- tends downwards from the aperture. The patient died on the third day. Os. B. f. 2a (A 2). Part of the parietal bone, dura mater, and brain of a man, aged 32, who was struck by a musket-ball, underwent the operation of trephining, and died on the thirteenth day. The ball was found firmly dovetailed in the bone, partially split, and jagged. Several depressed portions of bone were taken away. Suppurative meningitis and encephalitis supervened, and caused death as stated above. Os. B. f. 3 (A 8). A portion of the skull in which a ball struck the . left parietal bone, causing a compound fracture with depression. The trephine was applied on the seventh day, and the depressed portions removed. The patient, a man aged 20, died on the twenty-third day after the injury of suppurative meningitis. The surface of the inner table around the trephine aperture is irregularly pitted and “worm-eaten.”19 GUNSHOT INJURIES. Os. B. f. 4 (A 9). A portion of the left parietal bone in which a ball, striking the bone, caused a compound fracture across one of the branches of the middle meningeal artery; the trephine was applied on the second day. The patient, a man aged 47, died on the twenty-third day. The surface of the inner table around the gap is pitted and “ worm-eaten.” Os. B. f. 5 (A 10). A portion of the left parietal bone perforated by a ball in the exact position of the main branch of the middle meningeal artery. There was no extravasation of blood. The ball lodged in the cerebrum. The patient, a man of 30, died on the twenty-seventh day. Os. B. f. 6 (A 12). The anterior portion of a Skull, shewing the course of a large fragment of a shell through the bones of the face, in its way obliquely downwards from the left orbit to the opposite side of the neck. Death occurred on the fourth day. Os. B. f. 7 (A 13). The anterior portion of a skull, shewing a com- minuted fracture of the frontal bone by a ball which entered over the left eyebrow, where portions of the bone are to a certain extent carried inwards and on a lower level than the surrounding parts; passing transversely across the forehead, it emerged over the centre of the right eyebrow. Death occurred on the fifth day. Os. B.f. 8(B6). A skull shewing the results of an extensive gun- shot injury received at Waterloo, which the patient survived for many years. There is a large irregular gap in the frontal region, more than six inches in circumference; the bone surrounding the gap is very greatly thickened. The nasal portions of the frontal bone, the nasals, nasal processes of superior maxillae, the ethmoid, and lachrymals have been extensively destroyed. From the absence of teeth in either jaw and the absorption of the alveolar margin, it is evident that the subject of the injury (a field-officer in the army) must have lived to an adt^anced age. Os. B. f. 9 (B II). Portions of bone removed from the skull by operation. Os. B.f. 10 (B13). Portion of the lower jaw of a stag, in which a small shot is seen to be lodged on the inner side near the last molar tooth, and to be partly embedded by new bone. (Pre- sented by Dr J. A. Sidey, Edinburgh.) Os. B. f 11 (B 34 and B 133). Cast of the face of Alphonze Louis, the “ gunner with the silver mask,” who had the whole of his lower jaw carried away, and his right forearm severely injured, by the fragment of a shell at the last siege of Antwerp, and for whom the very ingenious contrivance B 133 was invented.

The right parietal and occipital bones of a child, shewing several minute circular apertures, the edges of which are smoothly rounded Gunshot Injuries of the Spine and Thoracic Wall. Os. B.f. 12 (A 15). The last dorsal Vertebra of a man in whom a musket-ball entered about three inches to the side of the spinous processes, entering the chest at the angle of the eleventh rib, fracturing it between its neck and angle, and lodged in the vertebra. The ball, with part of the man’s dress, is impacted in the body of the vertebra, projecting slightly into the spinal canal. The patient, a man of 36, died on the tenth day. Os. B.f. 13 (A 14). The second and third cervical vertebrae of a man who received a musket-shot in the mouth, returned to his regiment, and did duty from the fifteenth to the thirty-eighth day after he was wounded. Difficulty of swallowing, pain and stiffness of the neck, obliged him to return to hospital, where he died twenty-five days after admission. The bodies of both vertebrae are extensively destroyed by suppurative and ulcerative pro- cesses, induced by the lodgment of the bullet. Os. B. f 14 (A 16). Three vertebrae from a case in which a musket- ball entered the chest at the angle of the eleventh rib, and was cut out over the curvature of the ninth, presumably of the oppo- site side. The specimens shew that the ball passed through the root of the spinous process of the last dorsal vertebra, driving a portion inwards into the spinal canal, and carrying away the transverse and part of the articular processes. The patient died on the sixth day. Os. B. f 15 (A 17). “ Three vertebrae shewing the diseased actions which supervene occasionally in the osseous structures of the vertebrae when a gunshot injury has been sustained in any part of the canal. No history.” (Old Catalogue.) Os. B. f. 16 (A 18). “ Portion of a vertebra shewing how the pro- cesses and other portions are occasionally struck off from the bodies by musket-shot, and the carious action that follows. No history.” (Old Catalogue.) Os. B. f 17 (B 15).

B.f. 19 (A 58), Three Ribs shewing the manner in which they are snapped across when struck by a musket-ball. Os. B. f. 20 (B 14.). A comminuted fracture of the fifth rib near its middle, and of the axillary border and body of the scapula, caused by a musket-ball which entered the thorax between the sixth and seventh costal cartilages on the right side, made a breach in the diaphragm, and lacerated the subjacent portion of the liver; it then passed upwards, wounding slightly the three lobes of the lung on that side, fractured the fifth rib, and made its outward passage through the scapula. The patient, a soldier, who committed suicide by pointing his musket to his breast and pulling the trigger with his toe, survived the injury about twenty- four hours. (Presented by Dr Handyside.) Gunshot Injuries of the Upper Exire?nity. Os. B.f. 21 (A57). A recent comminuted fracture of the right Clavicle. Os. B.f 22 (A42).

Part of the scarlet jacket is seen firmly impacted between the ball and the bone. Death occurred on the eleventh day. Os. B.f. 23 (A 55). The head and neck of the humerus, and a narrow tongue-shaped splinter of the outer shell of the shaft, about 6*5 cm. long, separated from the remainder of the humerus by a ball entering at the bicipital groove. From a man aged 35. Os. B.f 24 (A75). The upper two-thirds of the humerus of a man aged 30, shewing an extensive comminuted fracture caused by a musket-ball. Death occurred on the thirty-fifth day. Os. B. f. 25 (A 73). The middle portion of the shaft of the humerus of a young man, aged 18, fractured and fissured by a ball which entered on the outer side of the right arm. There is a consider- able deposit of recent spongy bone on the periosteal surface. The limb was amputated on account of haemorrhage on the fourteenth day. )(A 53)- A portion of the shaft of a humerus of a man aged 26, shewing an extensively splintered frac- ture caused by a musket-ball. (A 54)- The lower end of the same humerus. Os. B. f. 27 (A 56). The lower end of a humerus of a man aged 20, shewing a comminuted fracture of the lower end of the shaft, with extensive splintering of the bone, caused by a musket-ball.GUNSHOT INJURIES. 22 Os. B. f. 28 (A 92). Portions of bone, separated from a case of gunshot injury of the humerus. Os. B. f. 29 (A 34). The bones of the elbow-joint of a man aged 23, in whom a ball passed obliquely through the external con- dyle, without fissuring the bone. Suppurative arthritis ensued, and was partially recovered from with bony anchylosis of the joint. The limb was amputated on the 136th day. Os. B. f. 30 (A 43). The bones of the elbow-joint of a soldier aged 25. A musket-ball entered from behind over the internal condyle, which is detached and splintered into several small pieces. The ball is seen impacted amongst the fragments with a portion of the sleeve of the scarlet coat lodged between the ball and the bone. Amputation was performed a few hours after the injury, and the patient died twenty days later. Os. B. f. 31 (A 80). The bones of the right hand and forearm of a man aged 45, amputated 223 days after receiving a gunshot comminuted fracture of the Radius. A large amount of new bone has been formed in the region of the fracture, and anchy- losing the radius to the ulna. The ball is seen loosely embedded in the interior of the altered radius. Gunshot Injuries of the Pelvis and Lower Extre7nity. Os. B. f. 32 (A 19). The Os Innominatum and upper part of the femur seventy-two days after the reception of a gunshot injury, The ball appears to have struck the dorsum ilii, smashed it into many pieces, and passed obliquely out near the sacro-sciatic notch, smashing also the superior portion of the acetabulum. Suppurative inflammation has supervened in the dorsum and venter ilii and in the hip-joint, causing death on the seventy- second day. (From a man named Quin in the loth Regiment.) Os. B. f. 33 (A 20). The os innominatum and lateral half of the sacrum from a man aged 42, who died 121 days after a gunshot injury in the region of the left buttock. That portion of the ilium which enters into the formation of the sacro-iliac joint has been extensively smashed and comminuted by the ball, which is to be seen embedded, together with a large sequestrum, in the centre of the injured area. Os. B. f. 34 (A 62). The acetabular portion of the os innominatum and upper half of the femur from a man aged 23, who died forty- seven days after receiving a gunshot injury in the region of the great trochanter. The ball passed through the femur at the junction of the neck with the shaft, smashing the bone into frag- ments and opening the capsular ligament of the hip. Suppura- tive inflammation has supervened, with exfoliation of portions of bone ; the suppuration has also led to destruction of the articular surfaces of the hip-joint.23 GUNSHOT INJURIES. Os. B. f. 35 (A 70). The upper half of the Femur from a man aged 2 1, who died eighty-four days after a gunshot injury of the thigh; the femur was comminuted by the ball at the junction of the middle and upper thirds, suppurative inflam- mation had followed, and a large portion of the compact shell had perished. Os. B. f. 36 (A 65). A beautiful specimen of extensive com- minuted and splintered fracture of the shaft of the femur about its middle, resulting from gunshot injury in a man aged 20; amputation below the lesser trochanter was successfully per- formed on the 136th day. Many of the splintered fragments have perished, and may be seen partly embedded in the very abundant new bone which has been formed ; the latter unites the fragments which have survived, to each other and to the shaft of the bone above and below. The musket-ball is flattened, and may be seen lying amongst the fragments. Os. B. f. 37 (A 71). The lower three-fourths of the femur of a Carlist prisoner, shewing a very oblique fracture of the middle of the shaft which has been followed by suppurative inflam- mation. Os. B. f. 38 (A 59). The lower two-thirds of the femur of a man who died thirty-five days after a gunshot injury of the thigh. T'he ball struck the inner aspect of the bone obliquely, driving in a portion of the compact shell, detaching two other portions and splintering the bone upwards and downwards. The ball is wedged in between the fragments. Os. B. f. 39 (A 69). A portion of the femur which had been obliquely fractured; subsequent osteomyelitis has caused the death of a considerable portion of the outer shell on the inner side. Os. B. f.40 (A 67). An oblique gunshot fracture of the upper third of the femur in which similar changes have supervened. Removed by amputation seventy-seven days after the injury. Man aged 23. Os. B.f.41 (A 72).

A new joint has formed between the displaced head and the neck of the scapula, of which the capsule has been partially reflected to shew the changes which have occurred in the articular surface of the head of the bone, and which are similar to those met with in arthritis deformans. From the posterior aspect of the shaft of the humerus, and 4’5 cm. below the anatomical neck, there projects backwards and upwards a thick truncated bony process, 4 cm. in girth and 6 cm. in length, the free extremity of which occupies the glenoid cavity, and forms with the latter a joint, allowing of a certain amount of movement attended with grating. To the free extremity of this process are attached the tendons of the supraspinatus, infraspinatus, and teres minor. The subscapularis has no attachment to the humerus. The tendon of the biceps is displaced from the bicipital groove, and occupies the deep sulcus between the glenoid and the displaced head of the humerus.29 INJURIES OF JOINTS. Os. 0. C. 6 (Y 152).

The facial bones of a woman aged 80, to illustrate their senile atrophy and the almost complete absorption of the alveolar border of the Superior Maxilla.31 SENILE ATROPHY OF BONE. Os. D. b. 2. The Inferior Maxilla from an aged person; the bone is greatly reduced in size; it is edentulous, and the alveolar border is completely absorbed; the basilar portion of the bone, which alone remains, is cylindrical and markedly attenuated. The rami are oblique in direction and the angle obtuse. The articular portion of either condyle has been ground or worn away in the movements of the joint, and the orifices of the enlarged Haversian canals are exposed on the articular surface (so-called senile arthritis). (Presented, with the preceding speci- men, by Professor Sir W. Turner.) Os. D. b. 3. A right Femur, illustrating the changes which are sometimes met with in old age. Though large and well formed, the entire bone is remarkably light. The angle of junction between the neck and the shaft does not differ from the normal. The internal structure of the bone has been largely cleared away and the medullary canal correspondingly increased in size by a process of rarefaction, which, commencing in the interior, has converted the deeper layers of the compact tissue into spongy bone, so that, of the outer shell, only a thin layer remains. At either extremity of the bone the cancellous frame- work has been reduced to a network of delicate thread-like trabeculae. On the articular aspect of the head of the bone, the compact layer on the surface has been replaced by a similar rarefied tissue over a limited area just outside the site of attach- ment of the ligamentum teres. (From an old woman who died in the workhouse. All the bones were affected with a similar atrophy, especially the ribs and the spongy ends of the long bones, where the bone was easily indented with the finger nail. The marrow in all the bones was transformed into a reddish- brown gelatinous material. Presented by Chas. W. Cathcart, M.B., 1890.)

The bone of the shaft at the sawn extremity has perished as a result of osteomyelitis, and appears as a partially separated cylindrical sequestrum. The periosteal surface of the shaft, as high up as the lesser trochanter, is enveloped by a thick crust of new bone, having a very beautiful coral-like structure.

(Presented by Dr Wilson of Buenos Ayres.) Os. D. d. 32 (Y 37). The Cannon bone of an Ox ; the anterior and lateral aspects of the upper two-thirds of its shaft are encased by a mass of periosteal bone, of which the surface layer is com- pact and relatively smooth; anteriorly it presents three rounded apertures leading into a cavity in the substance of the new bone. The specimen is sawn in vertical section. The following specimens illustrate the results of Diffuse Suppura- tive Periostitis and Osteomyelitis^ commonly called Acute Necrosis:— Os. D. d. 33 (361). A sequestrum which consists of the entire ’ Clavicle ; previous to exfoliation, the sternal end has been irregu- larly destroyed by the suppurative inflammation involving the soft parts covering the bone.

D. d. 37 (305). The shaft of a Femur, from a case of extensive osteomyelitis in a young subject. A considerable portion of the old shaft has perished, appearing as a sequestrum enveloped by a thick case of new bone, which is pierced by several sinuses or cloacae, and presents a foliaceous appearance on its periosteal surface. Os. D. d. 38 (306). A similar specimen. The inferior articular surface of the femur is irregularly ulcerated, the disease having probably spread from the femur to the knee-joint, and produced a suppurative arthritis in the latter. Os. D. d. 39 (307). The shaft of a femur, from a case of acute suppurative osteomyelitis ; the lower end of the shaft is expanded, and contains in its interior several sequestra of spongy bone.

A sequestrum from the femur, consisting of the entire circumference of the shaft. The margins of the sequestrum are pitted by the granulations which led to its separation from the living bone. Os. D. d. 43 (311). T he Tibia of a young subject, in which there has occurred an extensive necrosis of the shaft; the sequestrum is incompletely enveloped by the case of new bone.

A dissected preparation in spirit of the shaft of a tibia, removed by amputation from a boy aged 10, on account of acute suppurative periostitis and osteomyelitis. A large portion of the shaft of the bone has perished; the seques- trum is partly exposed, but it is enveloped by a thick case of new bone pierced by several cloacae. The disease has involved also the head of the tibia, and brought about disorganisation of the knee-joint. Os. D. d. 45 (320).

Involving Several Parts of the Sreleion. Os. D. e. 1 (Y 59). An incomplete Skeleton, from an adult female subject who had suffered from Syphilis. The bones entering into the formation of the nose are extensively destroyed by gummatous ulceration of long standing; the destruction par- ticularly affects the nasal bones and the nasal process of the left superior maxilla. The shafts of the long bones of the limbs shew traces of former periostitis in the shape of a thin porous crust of new bone, tending to be symmetrical on the two sides. This crust of new bone is much more extensive and abundant in the bones of the lower extremity. In addition to these lesions the skeleton is much deformed from rickets, the bones of the limbs are short and bent, while the vertebral column shews a very extreme rotation-lateral curvature, of which the convexity is to the right. Os. D. e. 2 (Y 67)- The complete skeleton of a well-formed adult male subject who had suffered from syphilis. In the skull the outer table is roughened, and presents several rounded depres- sions, \vhich probably mark the sites of previous tertiary ulcers. The bones of the upper limbs shew a somewhat diffuse crust of spongy bone on their periosteal surfaces. This is best seen in the left radius. The femoral shafts shew a thicker and more exten- sive periosteal deposit, which is fairly symmetrical. The left tibia is much thickened, in a characteristic nodular fashion, throughout the whole length of the shaft, while the right tibia shews a flattened node about the centre of its inner or sub- cutaneous surface.

The shaft of a Tibia, rounded and thickened by the formation of new bone, which at several points shews circum- scribed excavations or ulcers of considerable depth. The appear- ances seen in the specimen are partly due to the method of maceration. Os. D. e. 52 (Y 30).

I'he initial lesion was possibly an extensive tubercular osteomyelitis. Os. D. f. 2 (359). T he pelvis and two lower lumbar vertebrae of an adult, m which the Ilium has been extensively diseased. The ventral aspect and the crest of the ilium present a series of circular excavations or ulcers, some of which appear to have healed; the dorsum shews several similar rounded excavations, some of which have smooth margins; others, again, are very irregular, together with a considerable formation of new bone in their vicinity. The two lower lumbar vertebrae are affected with arthritis deformans, and are partially anchylosed to each other. Os. D. f. 3. A longitudinal section of a tubercular finger; the preparation, which is mounted in glycerine jelly and is quite translucent, shews an extensive tubercular infiltration in the interior of the first phalanx (tubercular osteomyelitis) and also scattered miliary tubercles in the marrow-spaces of the second43 RICKETS. phalanx.

This deposit is of considerable thickness, and is symmetrical on the two sides of the body. (This specimen is figured and described in Prof. Hughes Bennett’s Clinical Lectures on the Principles and Practice of Medicine., fifth edition, 1868, p. 978. It is referred to as follows:—“The dog lived in a painter’s shop, and was frequently seen lapping the vermilion oil paint, and there could be no doubt that in this way there was introduced into his system a considerable quantity of mercury.

The head is of average size and well formed, the jaw's are edentulous, and their alveolar margins entirely absorbed. The vertebral column is curved so that the upper dorsal vertebrae present a convexity to the left, while the lower present a still greater convexity to the right, the bodies of the vertebrae being also rotated in association with these curvatures. The thorax is displaced almost entirely to the left of the middle line, and the sternum presents a con- siderable convexity forwards. The pelvis 'is obliquely contracted at the brim in association with the spinal curvature, but is also compressed and heart-shaped, resembling the pelvic deformity44 RICKETS. met with in osteomalacia. The sacrum presents an exaggerated concavity forw^ards. The bones of the limbs are short and stunted; the humerus is abnormally short, with broad articular ends, and great prominence of the deltoid ridge and internal condyle. The hands appear disproportionately large. The articular ends of the femur are unusually broad, while its shaft is curved markedly forwards. The shafts of the tibia and fibula are flattened from side to side, and are curved forwards and inwards. (The skeleton is that of “ Bowed Joseph,” leader of the Meal Riots in Edinburgh,who died in 1780.) Os. D. i. 2 (507). The skeleton of a child, from a case of severe rickets. The skull is enlarged equally in all its dimensions. T"he thorax is laterally compressed, while the sternum is pro- jected forwards. The vertebral column shew^s no abnormal curvature. The front of the pelvis is beaked by the approxima- tion of the acetabula, the lower end of the sacrum is directed straight forwards, and the iliac bones present a transverse hori- zontal fold parallel with the crest and a little below the latter. The femora are curved forwards and outw^ards, the tibia and fibula directly forwards. The scapulae are folded on themselves horizontally, the humeri very markedly curved forwards, the radius and ulna, more especially on the left side, are curved outw^ards and forwards. The epiphysial ends of all the long bones are enlarged. Deformities of the Individual Bones from Rickets.

Of the Bones of the Loiver Limb. Os. D. i. 8 (536). The Femur and Tibia of an adult, deformed as a result of rickets. The femur is curved in the form of a semi- circle with the convexity outwards and forwards; the tibia is similarly curved, with the convexity inwards and backwards, the two bones together forming a curve like the letter S, with corres- ponding alterations in the direction of the articular surfaces. The shafts of the bones are also flattened from before backwards, and the internal condyle of the femur is considerably elongated. Os. D. i. 9 (530). The femur of an adult, in which the upper and middle thirds of the shaft are curved forwards and laterally com- pressed and flattened. The linea aspera projects prominently backwards along the concavity of the curve, its posterior margin forming the chord of the arc which is formed by the anterior wall of the femur. The gluteal ridge is exaggerated, and the neck of the bone unusually short. Os. D. i. 10 (524). A similar specimen; the curvature of the shaft is inwards as well as forwards, and the inferior articular surface is altered from arthritis deformans, involving the knee-joint. Os. D. i. 11 (522).

There is further a deposit of spongy bone in the region of the anterior intertrochanteric line. Os. D. i. 16(528). The femur of an adult, with a very distinct curvature of the shaft forwards and inwards, and prominence of the gluteal ridge. The inferior articular surface looks outwards and backwards, probably in consequence of a corresponding curvature of the shaft of the tibia. Os. D. i. 17 (521). The femur of an adult, elongated and very con- siderably attenuated, and presenting a curvature of the shaft forwards and inwards. The small trochanter is unusually pro- minent.RICKEI'S. 46 Os. D. i. 18 (531)- femur, with a forward and inward curvature of the shaft from rickets. The inferior articular surface, which looks downwards and outwards, is very distinctly altered from arthritis deformans affecting the knee. Os. D. i. 19 (480). The femur of an adult, measuring in its maxi- mum length only 24-5 cm., probably the result of arrested development brought about by rickets in early life. The head of the bone is depressed, so that its upper surface is on a level below that of the trochanter major. In the region of the anterior intertrochanteric line, there is a circumscribed area covered by a crust of porous new bone. The small trochanter projects almost directly backwards, and the gluteal ridge is unusually prominent. The shaft, which is flattened antero-posteriorly, pre- sents a slight degree of curvature outwards. The inferior end of the bone is broad and flat, and the margins of the articular surface are very markedly “lipped,” probably the result of arthritis deformans of the knee-joint. Os. D. i. 20 (532). A similar specimen, from which the head and lower end of the bone have been removed with the saw. Os. D. i. 21 (525)- "l"he femur of a young subject, in which the epiphyses have not yet united.

T he femur of a child, in which the shaft is flattened from before backwards and curved outwards and forwards. Os. D. i. 23 (538). A Tibia and Fibula, the shafts of which, in consequence of rickets, are remarkably curved inwards and flattened. The curvature is considerable, the two bones remain- ing parallel with each other. At the most prominent part of its curve, which is about the centre of the bone, the shaft of the fibula measures about 3*5 cm. in width, but not more than I cm. in thickness. Os. D. i. 24 (539). A tibia and fibula similarly curved and flattened, and unusually short from arrested development, the result of rickets in early life. A little above the most prominent part of the curvature the two bones are anchylosed to each other by a narrow bridge of bone. The curvature is so very extreme that the inferior articular surface of the tibia looks upwards and out- wards. Os. D. i. 25 (543). T he tibia of an adult, curved like a bow with the convexity inwards; the shaft is very considerably flattened from before backwards. There is a small bony projection on the sharp inner border of the shaft in its upper third, while on the posterior aspect of the bone, near its lower end, there is a circumscribed depression with raised irregular edges, probably produced by the pressure of an exostosis springing from the fibula.47 RICKETS.

The right Radius of an adult; the shaft is in- creased in circumference throughout, is slightly curved outwards and backwards, while the surface layer of the bone is roughened and porous. 'Fhese changes are possibly the result of osteitis deformans.48 OSTEITIS DEFORMANS. Os. D. k. 2 (194). T he shaft of an Ulna longitudinally bisected. The bone is clumsy-looking, increased in girth, and is slightly bent backwards. The surface of the bone is smooth, but is perforated by an unusual number of vascular apertures. The sawn section exhibits the encroachment on the medullary canal by condensed spongy tissue, while the compact tissue of the external shell has itself become rarefied. These changes possibly result from osteitis deformans. Os. D. k. 3 (238). A portion of the shaft of a Femur greatly in- creased in circumference; its surface is uneven and minutely nodulated, and exhibits numerous pores or apertures for blood- vessels. The compact tissue of the shaft, as seen in section, is partly spongy and partly dense and chalk-like. Os. D. k. 4 (210). T he upper end of a femur cut in vertical section. The shaft is increased in circumference, and is porous and spongy on its external surface. The cancellous tissue in the substance is coarser, with denser trabeculae than normal, and encroaching on the medullary canal, but a great portion of the cancellous tissue has been converted into dense chalk-like bone, the latter occurring in the form of irregular patches. Os. D. k. 5 (252). A Tibia, curved throughout its whole length with the convexity of the curve directed forwards; the circumference of the shaft is uniformly increased from end to end; the external surface is rough and irregular, with numerous grooves and aper- tures for blood-vessels. In the longitudinal section which has been made, the medullary canal is seen to be enlarged, the can- cellous tissue rather coarse in its arrangement, and the compact tissue increased in thickness.

The Skull and portions of the Skeleton of a man, aged 36, who had suffered from acromegaly, and who died ot diabetes mellitus in the Royal Infirmary in 1878. The skull is unusually large, and presents a disproportionate increase in the dimensions of the face, this being chiefly due to an increase in the vertical diameter of the superior and inferior maxillae. The muscular ridges are unusually developed. The superciliary ridges are large and prominent, and the frontal sinuses dilated. The orbital cavities are increased in their transverse diameter. The49 ACROMKGALY. palatal arch is elongated, relatively narrow, and deeply concave. The enlargement of the condyles of the lower jaw has caused a considerable expansion of the glenoid cavities, while the dis- appearance of the eminentiae articularis bounding the latter anteriorly allows of a partial forward luxation of the jaw as a whole. The cranial bones present a hypertrophy of their normal structure. The pituitary fossa is very greatly enlarged at the expense of the surrounding bony parts; the optic groove is obliterated, and the optic foramina flattened from above down- wards. The vertebrae are of large size, and show changes re- sembling those met with in arthritis deformans. The sternum and ribs are of gigantic size. The ensiform and costal cartilages shew various degrees of ossification. The bones of the extremities are heavy and clumsy; their surface layer is rough and porous, and marked by an infinite number of shallow longitudinal grooves. The sterno-clavicular and right elbow-joints have been the seat of an arthritis resembling arthritis deformans. The bones of the hands and feet shew no characteristic alteration. The pelvis is unusually large and bulky, and the muscular ridges very pro- minent. (The brain and the enormously-distended stomach from this subject are preserved in the Museum. An account of the case was published by Dr D. J. Cunningham in the Jour?ial of Ana t, and Phys. vol. ix., and a description of the skeleton, by Dr H. A. Thomson, in the same Journal^ vol. xxiv.

Os. D. t. 2. The bones of the opposite foreleg of the same dog, in which Professor Syme performed a similar experiment on the radius, the periosteum, however, being left in situ. After six weeks the dog was killed. A compact mass of bone may be seen to occupy the space left by the portion removed, and rather exceeding it in thickness.6l SUPPURATIVE DISEASES OF JOINTS. Os. D. t. 3. The bones of the foreleg of a dog, in which a small portion of bone appears to have been excised from the middle of the shaft of the radius some weeks before the animal was killed. The cut extremities are now united by a tough fibrous tissue, which encloses several small scattered masses of bone. [These specimens were presented to the Museum by Professor Annandale in 1890.

The tibia, patella, and portion of a femur, from a case of multiple injury of the lower extremity. The shaft of the femur has been broken in its lower fourth; the fracture was evidently compound, and was followed by secondary Suppurative Arthritis in the Knee-joint, of which the articular surfaces, much altered in form, are partially united to each other by new bone. There has also been an oblique fracture of the shaft of the tibia at the junction of its middle and lower thirds ; the fragments are smoothly united, but at an angle with each other. Os. E. b. 2 (3106). The upper end of a femur, from a case in which the epiphysis of the head became separated, as a result of acute osteomyelitis (epiphysitis), with abundant formation of pus in the cavity of the Hip-joint. An abscess had also formed beneath the periosteum on the anterior and inner surface of the femur in its upper third (acute suppurative periostitis); in this area the surface layer of compact bone has perished, and is seen in the process of separation. At the upper margin of this area there is a con- siderable mass of new bone.

The bones of a Hip-joint, macerated; the articular surfaces are superficially ulcerated throughout their entire extent; the head of the femur is somewhat flattened and diminished in size, while the acetabulum is very considerably broadened. The surfaces in the vicinity of the joint are richly covered with new bone, especially at the sites of attachment of the capsular ligament. There is also a crust of new bone on the pelvic aspect of the acetabulum. Os. E. d. 20 (213). The upper end of a femur shewing similar changes in its head. Os. E. d. 21 (3686). The bones of a hip-joint, macerated, shewing an advanced degree of destruction of the articular surfaces; the acetabulum is irregularly excavated and its floor nearly pene- trated. The head of the femur is deficient on its upper aspect, a large portion of the cancellated tissue having been removed. The surfaces in the vicinity of the joint are encrusted with new bone. Os. E. d. 22 (368). The bones of a hip-joint, macerated, from a very advanced case of tuberculosis, involving the hip and adjacent parts. The acetabulum has suffered most from the destructive process, its margins having all but disappeared and its floor being extensively perforated. The greater part of the ischium and pubis are expanded and irregularly ulcerated, in consequence of a diffuse tubercular infiltration of their cancellated tissue. The head of the femur has been the seat of a tubercular ostitis in the region of the epiphysial cartilage, which has resulted in the sepa- ration of the epiphysis itself as a sequestrum lying free in the cavity of the joint. The specimen is from a young subject, the epiphysial junction of the trochanter major being still visible. As in the preceding specimens, the surfaces in the vicinity of the joint are abundantly covered with a crust of new bone. Os. E.. d. 23 (461). The bones from a case of advanced hip-joint disease, in which partial anchylosis has resulted, with shortening of the limb in the flexed and adducted position. The floor of the acetabulum has been extensively perforated, and the head of the femur projects through it, so as to be seen from the pelvic side, together with a separated portion of the acetabulum adherent to it. The great trochanter is opposed to and partially fused with the upper rim of the acetabulum. Os. E. d. 24 (3686). A preparation of the hip-joint in spirit, in which extensive destruction has occurred as the result of tubercle. The head of the femur perished cn masse^ and was exfoliated ; the acetabulum has been obliterated, and a smooth convex sur- face of bone is seen in the area which it normally occupies. The remainder of the neck and upper end of the femur is displaced upwards on to the dorsum ilii, it being attached to the bone in the region of the acetabulum by a few bands of fibrous tissue.TUBERCULAR DISEASES OF JOINTS. 65 Os. E. d. 25 (3685^). A vertical transverse section of the hip-joint of a boy of 16, which at one time had been the seat of a tuber- cular arthritis. The femur is fixed in the acetabulum in the adducted position by firm fibrous union of the opposed surfaces, notably at the points of attachment of the ligamentum teres. Microscopic examination of the bones revealed old tubercular foci, both in the head of the femur and in the spongy tissue forming the floor of the acetabulum. (Prepared by Professor Annandale, i860. Figured and described by Dr H. A. Thomson, Labor. Rep. Roy. Col. of Rhys. Edin. vol. ii. p. 172.) Os. E. d. 26 (467).

Os. E. d. 27 (464). Bony anchylosis of the hip-joint, the result of an arthritis, probably tubercular in character. Os. E. d. 28 (368). T he bones of the pelvis and lower extremities of an adult, shewing Bilateral Dislocation of the Head of the Femur, probably resulting from Arthritis of both hip-joints. The upper end of the femur is deficient on either side, the head and neck are entirely wanting in the left femur, a portion of the head only is wanting in the right. In the right innominate bone the acetabulum is represented by an irregular depression presenting no resemblance to the normal socket of the hip, while above and behind it, close to the great sciatic notch, there is a flattened elevated mass of bone, the surface of which has been rubbed by the altered femoral head. On the left side there is a large oval aperture in the position of the acetabulum, leading straight into the pelvic cavity, while immediately behind this the bone is flattened and rubbed smooth by friction. The grooves for the psoas and iliacus muscles are converted into deep depressions. The long bones of the extremities are very distinctly wasted, especially on the left side, where the maximum length of the femur is 50 mm. and the maximum length of the tibia is 35 mm. shorter than the corresponding bones of the right limb. On the left side the knee-joint has been maintained rigidly flexed for many years, and the articular surfaces are correspondingly altered. [In the Old Catalogue the case is described as one of old “ scrofulous caries ” of both hip-joints. | Os. E. d. 29 (Y 37)- The bones of a Knee-joint from an advanced case of tubercular arthritis. Towards the posterior aspect of the internal condyle of the femur there is a wedge-shaped seques- trum, embedded in the cancellated tissue, with its base towards the joint and its apex towards the medulla. The surface exposed to the joint is eburnated and polished like porcelain. The sequestrum as a whole is whiter and denser than the bone in which it is embedded. There are similar sequestra in the external condyle and in the outer tuberosity of the tibia.

The joint is acutely flexed; the skin covering it anteriorly has sloughed, so that the lower end of the femur is exposed, surrounded by the thickened synovial mem- brane, and with the articular cartilages extensively ulcerated and detached. Amputation through the upper third of the leg had been previously performed without healing having taken place. Os. E. d 44 (375). A knee-joint from a case of tubercular arthritis which had gone on to suppuration. The synovial sac is enor- mously distended, especially in its upper and anterior portion; it contained a large quantity of pus; the synovial membrane is greatly thickened, and is covered with large lymphy masses and flakes like those seen in empyema. The articular surfaces are all but hidden by the membrane having spread from the peri- phery inwards.^ 1 here are cicatrices on the skin on the lateral aspects of the joint. The specimen is well injected.68 TUBERCULAR DISEASES OF JOINTS. Os. E. d. 45 (384).

The knee-joint of an adult cut in vertical sec- tion ; the initial tubercular deposit is visible in the head of the tibia as a diffuse caseating infiltration of the cancellated tissue towards the posterior aspect of the bone. From this point the tubercular process has spread to the soft parts in the popliteal space, giving rise to a cold abscess which communicates with the knee-joint. The joint itself is disorganised, the cartilages separated, and the synovial membrane lined by caseous lymph. There is another cold abscess in front of the femur above the joint. Os. E. d. 51 (383).

The upper end of a humerus from a diseased shoulder, in which the head is considerably flattened, and its- articulating area increased in size, by the development of new bone around the margin, causing the “ lipped ” appearance which is characteristic of the articular surfaces in arthritis deformans. Part of the convexity of the head is smoothly polished and dense white like ivory—the “ porcelainous deposit,” or eburnation of “ chronic rheumatic arthritis.” Os. E. g. 4 (Y 159). The bones of the left arm of an adult. The humerus is abnormally short and curved, the result probably of rickets in early life, while its superior articular end shews changes similar to those described in the previous specimen. Os. E. g. 5 (187). The bones of the Elbow-joint from a man aged 50. The lower end of the humerus is very markedly “lipped,’' and its articular surface eburnated, more especially over the trochlea, where the eburnated surface presents a series of parallel grooves produced by the movement of the joint in flexion and extension. Over the capitellum the eburnated surface shews a number of minute circular apertures, corresponding to the enlarged Haversian canals, which have been opened into by the wearing away of the articular surface. The “ lipping ” of the radial and ulnar articular surfaces is very pronounced, while attached to the capsular ligament, and in contact with the head of the radius anteriorly, there is an isolated mass of new bone of considerable size. The joint was said to have been dislocated in youth.73 AR'IHRITIS DEFORMANS. Os. E. g. 6 (3S6«). Plaster cast of the hands of a patient, shewing the deformity and distortion of the Fingers resulting from arthritis deformans or from chronic polyarticular rheumatism. Os. E. g. 7 (206flf). A preparation in spirit of a very characteristic example of arthritis deformans affecting the Hip. The capsule of the joint is greatly thickened, and its inner surface studded with polypoidal processes or hypertrophied synovial fringes. Along the line of junction between the synovial membrane and the articular cartilage of the head of the femur there are a series of rounded nodular masses of bone, giving the articular surface the characteristic “lipped” appearance, and making the head appear much larger and somewhat conical in shape rather than hemispherical. The articular surface itself is rough and uneven from degenerative changes in the cartilage. Os. E. g. 8 (368/). A preparation of the hip-joint in spirit, shewing certain of the early changes in arthritis deformans. Portions of the articular cartilage of the head of the femur and acetabulum are fibrous and velvety, and the capsular ligament is considerably thickened. (From the Dissecting-Room, i860.

E. g*. 16(2II). a similar specimen, in which the new bone formed around the articular surface forms a projecting collar which overhangs the cervix on its posterior aspect. The articular surface itself is very rough and uneven, new bone having been formed on certain portions, while the area exposed to friction and pressure by the weight of the body transmitted through the acetabulum is pitted and “worm-eaten.” Os. E. g. 17 (206). A similar specimen. Os. E. g. 18 (209). A similar specimen. Os. E. g. 19 (Y II). A similar specimen. Os. E. g. 20 (203). The upper end of a femur, in which the head is elongated and conical, as a result of the new bone developed around the articular margin being prolonged on to the cervix as far as the anterior trochanteric line. The superior aspect of the head is eburnated and “worm-eaten.” Os. E. g. 21 (208). The upper end of a femur, in which the head is very greatly enlarged and altered in appearance, so that it has become obtusely conical or limpet-shaped, while the articular surface, which has been bared of cartilage, is rough and uneven. The cervix has been partly absorbed, the remains of it are buried in the enlarged head, so that the margins of the latter are in close contact with the trochanters. Os. E. g. 22 (205). A somewhat similar specimen, in which the head is flattened and depressed, subsequent to absorption of the neck, so that it lies at a level below that of the trochanters. The articular surface is earthy-looking, is rubbed smooth on the superior aspect, while elsewhere it is deeply pitted and excavated. Os. E. g. 23 (207)- A similar specimen, in which the head is of normal size, but it is depressed downwards against the junction of the neck and shaft, and is completely fused with the small trochanter, the cervix having disappeared. Os. E. g. 24 (Y 15). The upper end of a femur, unearthed during the restoration of St Giles’ Cathedral, in which the neck and adjacent part of the bone is bent or curved, so that the angle which the neck forms with the shaft is considerably less than 90°, and the head occupies an abnormally low position relatively to the great trochanter. The superior aspect of the articular sur- face is eburnated and polished like ivory, while the remaining portions are “ worm-eaten ” and worn. Os. E. g. 25 (462). The bones of a hip-joint, in which the head of the femur is imprisoned in the acetabulum by the projecting rim or collar of bone, added to the latter by ossification occurring in the cotyloid and capsular ligaments of the hip. The rim of the acetabulum grasps the neck of the femur. Os. E. g. 26 (463). A similar specimen.75. ARTHRITIS DEFORMANS. Os. E. g. 27 (468). A similar specimen, in which the femoral head is so tightly grasped by the altered acetabulum that very little movement is permitted at the hip. The floor of the acetabulum bulges very prominently on the pelvic aspect of the bone, and presents an irregularly rounded aperture close to the ilio-pecti- neal line, through which the altered articular surface of the head of the femur may be seen. Os. E. g. 28 (Y 125). The bones of a hip-joint shewing very re- markable alterations, which, in the absence of any history, may be ascribed to arthritis deformans. The femoral head is repre- sented by a conical mass of bone, sessile on the upper end of the shaft; this cone terminates in a pointed extremity which is directed downwards and inwards. The base of the cone is “ lipped ”—/.<?., surrounded—by a rim or collar of new bone. The articular surface is devoid of cartilage, but it is smooth, in colour and consistence resembling the bone of a fish. The acetabulum is correspondingly altered; the head of the femur fits accurately into the socket, and in such a way that the limb must have been much flexed and adducted, and its range of movement extremely limited. Os. E. g. 29. The bones of the hip-joint, from a subject in the Dissecting-Room, presenting changes which are the result of advanced arthritis deformans. The head of the femur has the appearance of being sessile on the upper end of the shaft, and depressed below the level of the great trochanter; it has further become altered in shape, and its articular surface is directed for- wards as well as inwards. The cartilage on the articular surfaces has largely disappeared—the latter being rough, uneven, and studded with little prominences, consisting partly of bone and partly of cartilage. (Presented by Professor Sir W. Turner, 1890.) Os. E. g. 30 (230). A femur of unusual girth and size, in which the shaft is curved like a bow outwards, and flattened from before backwards. The head of the bone shews alterations re- sulting from arthritis deformans of the hip, viz., “lipping” of the articular surface, the latter being extremely rough and uneven, with numerous large apertures like ulcers, leading into the can- celli of the head. The inferior articular surface presents the appearance of commencing degenerative changes of a similar character. Os. E. g. 31 (231). A similar specimen, probably the fellow of the preceding. Os. E. g. 32 (591). A K nee-joint, in which the greater part of the synovial membrane is closely covered with hypertrophied fringes, polypoidal processes, and pedunculated small bodies; these extend close up to the articular margins, which are slightly “lipped.” The cartilage over the articular surfaces is for the most part intact, shewing only commencing fibrous transformation;6 ARTHRITIS DEFORMANS. at certain points; round the margin, however, more especially that over the inner condyle, is being invaded and eaten into by the adjacent synovial membrane. Os. E. g. 33 (385). A preparation of the knee-joint, in spirit, shew- ing alterations which are very characteristic of arthritis deformans. The margins of the articular surfaces are “ lipped ” and nodular ; the articular cartilage, as such, has almost entirely disappeared; in certain parts, more especially over the patella, it has been con- verted into a fibrous connective tissue, having a villous appear- ance ; in other parts, nodules of new bone have been formed in the cartilage, making its surface, especially over the trochlea and condyles of the femur, very irregular and uneven. The synovial membrane has undergone a fibrous thickening, and shews a number of processes, which surround the patella like a fringe. Os. E. g. 34 (240a). The femoral and patellar portions of a knee- joint, in which the articular cartilage is deficient over a rounded circumscribed area on the trochlea and corresponding area on the outer facet of the patella, forming a depression on either sur- face with smoothly bevelled margins. Os. E. g. 35 (373)- Another characteristic specimen. The “ lip- ping ” of the articular surfaces is very pronounced; the trochlear area on the femur is enlarged and eburnated; the condylar portions are covered with the fibrous remains of the articular cartilage. The articular surface of the patella is eburnated and greatly increased in area by the addition of new bone along its outer margin. The thickened joint capsule has also been opened from behind, to shew a large cartilaginous “ loose body ” which has become caught between the outer condyle and the capsule. Os. E. g. 36 (372). The macerated bones of a knee-joint, in which the changes are more advanced. The articular surfaces are “ lipped,” so that the margins overhang the adjacent bone. The trochlear surface of the femur and the outer facet of the patella have been bared of cartilage, while the exposed bone has been rubbed smooth (eburnated). Nodules of new bone have been formed in the semilunar cartilages. A large mass of bone has been similarly formed in the tendon of the quadriceps at its attachment to the upper border of the patella, and smaller nodules are also seen along the attachments of the tendon to the borders of the same bone. Os. E. g. 37 (239). The articular ends of a tibia and femur, in which the most prominent feature is the porcelainous or ivory- like eburnation of the corresponding surfaces of the internal tuberosity and internal condyle. The eburnated area on either bone presents a series of parallel antero-posterior grooves, which have resulted from the hinge-like movements of the joint. The articular surfaces are also “ lipped,” and a considerable amount of new bone has been formed in the tendon of the adductor magnus at its insertion into the tubercle of the femur, and in the ligamentum patellee at its attachment to the tibia.ARTHRITIS DEFORMANS. 77 Os. E. g. 38 (240). The lower end of a femur shewing similar changes. Os. E. g. 39 (479).

T he femur of an adult, in which the shaft is flattened and curved outwards and forwards from rickets in early life. The inferior articular surface shews “ lipping ” of its mar- gins, eburnation over the projecting internal condyle, and a “ worm-eaten ” condition of the remainder of the articular surface. Os. E. g. 41 (392). The bones of the leg and tarsus, shewing changes which probably resulted from arthritis deformans. The inferior tibio-fibular, the calcaneo-astragaloid, and the astragalo- scaphoid joints are anchylosed. A considerable amount of new bone has been formed at the sites of attachment of tendons, ligaments, and fasciae, and also deepening the grooves for the tendons behind the malleoli. The Ankle-joint itself has been disorganised ; the articular surface formed by the tibia and fibula is deeply excavated, and presents a large cavity, which has been opened into, in the lower end of the tibia; the remainder of the articular surface is occupied by a very rough and irregular bone having a chalky, “ worm-eaten ” appearance. The articular sur- face of the astragalus is similarly altered. Os. E. g. 42 (498). The lower ends of a tibia and fibula presenting similar changes. Os. E. g. 43 (199).

Os. E. g. 44 (283). The tarsus of a Horse, in which the superior articular surface of the astragalus is characteristically eburnated and marked by a series of parallel antero-posterior grooves. There are further nodular outgrowths of bone around the articular margins. Os. E. g. 45 (284).

[Articular changes in I.ocomotor Ataxy, “ Charcot’s Disease of Joints,” &c.] Os. E.h. 1. The bones of a knee-joint, macerated, shewing a number of destructive changes characteristic of Charcot’s Disease. The Tibial articular surface is represented by a large irregular deep excavation, of which the outer wall is formed by the remains of the outer tuberosity, while the inner wall consists of a con- tinuous semicircular plate of new bone, occupying the position of the capsule of the joint. The inner tuberosity has entirely disappeared; the cancellous tissue exposed at the bottom of the excavation is partly condensed and rubbed smooth, and partly eroded and “ worm-eaten.” The surface is nowhere porcelainous. The remaining portion of the outer tuberosity is covered with normal articular cartilage. The inner condyle of the femur has largely disappeared, the outer is covered with normal cartilage, and there are a number of nodules of new bone in the capsular ligament at its attachment round the articular margin.

The superior extremities of the radius and ulna rested on the front of the lower extremity of the humerus. The elbow could not be flexed past a right angle,, but could be completely extended. In rotation of the forearm both radius and ulna moved on the humerus. Round the extremities of the three bones was an imperfect fibrous capsule, with a small synovial membrane resembling a bursa.

The Vertebrae and adjacent portions of the ribs from a case of arthritis deformans. The spinal column presents a gradual posterior curvature or kyphosis. On the lateral aspects of the bodies, from the second dorsal to the third lumbar inclusive, there are a series of projecting nodular masses of new bone, bridging across the intervertebral discs and the costo-verte- bral joints so as to anchylose the bones immovably to one another, and cover in the heads of the ribs. These bony masses are formed by the projection of bony plates from the adjacent margins of two vertebral bodies, and their subsequent fusion opposite the intervertebral disc. Os. F. b. 3 (Y 35). The cervico-dorsal spine from the axis to the fifth dorsal vertebra. The bodies, articular processes, and laminae are all anchylosed so as to form one continuous bony mass, with which, in the dorsal region, the heads of the ribs are incorporated.

A spinal column from the dissecting-rooms, in which the changes met with in cases of arthritis deformans are present to an unusually advanced degree. The spine presents a gradual posterior curvature and an abrupt lateral curvature ; the latter affects the lower dorsal and lumbar regions, and is asso- ciated with some rotation of the bodies of the vertebrae. More remarkable is the enormous amount of new bone which has been formed both on the anterior and posterior surfaces of the spine, bridging across the gaps between the bodies and in the lower dorsal and lumbar regions, completely burying the bones, and fusing them into an irregularly nodulated solid mass. Posteriorly the articulations between the articular processes of adjacent vertebrae are similarly buried in a mass of new bone. In con- junction with these changes in the spine there was a remarkable fibrous hypertrophy of the sympathetic nervous system upon the side corresponding to the convexity of the curvature.

The two first-mentioned bones are anchylosed after the manner already described as characteristic of arthritis deformans ; while the Sacro-iliac joint shews a pre- cisely similar condition of external anchylosis by a broad bridge of bone passing across the front of the articulation. The central portion of the ilium is unusually thin, consisting only of a com- pact lamina of bone no thicker than parchment, probably the result of what is usually called “ senile atrophy ” of the bone. Os. F. b. 25 (444). The right half of a pelvis, in which the sacro- iliac joint is similarly anchylosed. The outer lip of the iliac crest is unusually prominent and tuberculated ; new bone has been deposited in relation to the acetabulum, probably in part an ossification of the cotyloid ligament of the hip-joint. Os. F. b. 26 (445). A similar specimen. Os. F. b. 27 (443). The posterior segment of a pelvis, in which both sacro-iliac joints have become anchylosed, and the last lumbar vertebrae united to the sacrum after the manner charac- teristic of arthritis deformans. Os. F. b. 28 (440). A pelvis, in which both sacro-iliac joints are anchylosed by a mass of bone on the anterior aspect of the joint.85 TUBERCULOSIS OF THE SPINE. Os. F. b. 29 (442). A pelvis, in which the changes are to be seen which precede anchylosis of the sacro-iliac joints ; the adjacent margins of the articular surfaces are converted into irregularly tuberculated ridges, which tend to bridge across the interval between the two bones. There is further a partial ossification of the sacro-sciatic ligament at its point of attachment to the ischial tuberosity. Os. F. b. 30 (441). A similar specimen. Syphilis of the Vertebral Column. Os. F. c. [No specimens.] Tuberciclosis—Caries of the Bodies of the Vertebi'ce— Potis Disease. Os. F. d. Os. F. d. 1 (165). A preparation in spirit of the upper three cervi- cal vertebrae. The opposing articular surfaces of the atlas and axis are superficially ulcerated, and the odontoid process has been to a large extent removed by a similar process. Os. F. d. 2 (352). A macerated preparation of the cervical ver- tebrae, in which the bodies have been extensively destroyed by a tubercular ostitis affecting the upper five of the series ; spon- taneous fracture occurred through the anterior arch of the axis, close to the base of the odontoid process, with consequent dislocation of the atlas forwards, and to the right. Anchylosis has subsequently taken place, fixing the bones in their abnormal position. (Presented by Professor Syme.) Os. F. d. 3 (353). The upper three cervical vertebrae from a patient who died suddenly. The right superior articular facet of the atlas has been destroyed by a process of ulceration. The liga- ments are stated to have given way. Os. F. d. 4 (408). The upper five cervical vertebrae from a case in which, as a result of destruction of the atlo-axoid ligaments, the atlas has been dislocated almost directly forwards, causing great narrowing of the spinal canal. The atlas and axis are anchy- losed in their abnormal position by abundant bone of new formation, a special process or bridge of bone uniting the odon- toid process with the anterior arch of the atlas. The superior articular surfaces of the latter bone and a portion of its posterior arch have been destroyed by ulceration. Os. F. d. 5 (4050). The base of a skull, and the first and second cervical vertebrae, all anchylosed together by bone, as a result of antecedent disease, which was probably tubercular in character. 4Te axis is dislocated backwards, and the spinal canal much narrowed.TUBERCULOSIS OF THE SPINE. 86 Os. F. d. 6 (406). The upper four cervical vertebrcC, of which the second, third, and fourth, after partial destruction of their bodies by tubercle, have become firmly anchylosed to one another. Os. F. d. 7 (411). A similar condition of the second, third, and fourth cervical vertebrae. Os. F. d. 8 (412). A similar specimen. Os. F. d. 9 (413). A similar specimen. Os. F. d. 10 (348a). A preparation in spirit of the dorsal spine and posterior mediastinum of a child, in which an abscess con- nected with tuberculosis of the bodies of the dorsal vertebrae has perforated into the pleural cavity on either side. Os. F. d. 11 (348). A macerated preparation of the dorsal region of the spine, in which the bodies of all the dorsal vertebrae have been the seat of tubercular deposit and inflammation. Those from the fifth to the twelfth, inclusive, have especially suffered, their bodies having been nearly completely destroyed and removed, with the result that they have fallen together or col- lapsed, and produced a very pronounced angular curvature. The remains of the diseased bodies and their laminae have become anchylosed to each other by bone. Os. F. d. 12(355). A similar specimen, which has not been macer- ated, but preserved in the recent state in spirit. The bodies of the dorsal vertebrae have been so extensively destroyed by the tubercular process that a considerable portion of the spinal cord is exposed from the front. Os. F. d. 13(349). A macerated preparation of the dorsal ver- tebrae, in which may be seen the results of a tubercular ostitis, not so advanced as in the preceding specimens. The greater number ol the bodies present a rarefied, excavated, spongy struc- ture, the surface compact layer having entirely disappeared. The bodies of the fifth and sixth have been more extensively destroyed, and they have fallen together so as to produce a moderate degree of angular curvature. Os. F. d. 14(30). A similar preparation of the dorsal vertebrae, sawn in vertical section. The tubercle has been limited to the fourth, fifth, and sixth ; of these the body of the fifth has entirely disappeared; the adjacent portions of the fourth and sixth have become approximated, producing a moderate angular curvature. The cancellated tissue of these bodies, as seen in the sawn section, is very distinctly sclerosed. The spinal canal is not diminished in size. Os. F. d. 15 (350). A macerated preparation of the dorsal vertebrae, in which three of the bodies have almost entirely disappeared, with consequent angular curvature. The bodies of the vertebrae above and below are all anchylosed to each other by irregularly nodulated masses of new bone on their anterior and lateral aspects, after the manner characteristic of arthritis deformans.TUBERCULOSIS OF THE SPINE. 8/ Os. F. d. 16 (356). A macerated specimen of four dorsal vertebrae, which present a degree of superficial ulceration on the anterior aspect of their bodies, apparently in the process of healing and recovery, without any curvature of the spine. Os. F. d. 17 (428). A similar preparation of the lowest three dorsal and first lumbar vertebrae. The bodies of the tenth and eleventh dorsal have been extensively destroyed by tubercle, and have fallen together ; while those of the twelfth dorsal and first lumbar are anchylosed to each other by a series of bony processes, which bridge across the interval occupied by the intervertebral disc, and resemble those met with in arthritis deformans. Os. F. d. 18 (354). A preparation in spirit of the third and fourth lumbar vertebrae. The anterior portion of the body of the first- named bone, at its junction with the intervertebral disc, shews an irregular excavation of its substance, resulting from tubercle. Os. F. d. 19(351). A macerated preparation of the lumbar ver- tebrae. The bodies of the first, second, and third have been extensively destroyed by tubercle. Os. F. d. 20 (375). A similar preparation of the twelfth dorsal and first lumbar vertebrae. The body of the former has suffered from extensive tubercular destruction of its substance, so that it has nearly separated into an upper and a lower portion. Os. F. d. 21 (Y33). Five dorsal vertebrae, which have been so altered that they form an acute angle or curve of an exaggerated type. The bodies were probably extensively destroyed by tubercle, and then collapsed and became anchylosed. There is no trace of recent disease. Os. F. d. 22 (418). A similar preparation. Os. F. d. 23 (351^). The four lower lumbar vertebrae and the sacrum, from a case of long-standing tuberculosis, with suppura- tion, which opened externally on the right side by a sinus near the great trochanter, and on the left in the lumbar region. The bodies of the fourth and fifth lumbar on their anterior aspect, and the central mass of the sacrum towards its posterior aspect, shew the usual excavation and destruction produced by tubercle ; they have subsequently become anchylosed to each other by new bone, bridging across from one bone to the other. (Pre- sented by Dr John Cleland.) Os. F. d. 24 (Y 53). The macerated pelvis of a child, in which the upper four segments of the sacrum have been extensively destroyed and eaten away by tubercle. The bone forming the acetabulum on the left side appears to have suffered in a similar way. Os. F. d. 25 (360). The pelvis of an adult, in which the lower part of the sacrum has been very extensively diseased and removed, probably as a result of tubercle. That portion of the iliumCURVATURES OF THE SPINE. 88 which enters into the formation of the sacro-iliac joint has entirely disappeared, leaving a peculiar crescentic bay or gap in the posterior margin of the bone, through which the articular surface of the sacrum is visible. There is a crust of recent bone on the gluteal aspect of the ilium in the vicinity of the gap. Curvahtres of the Spine, together with the Deformities of the Thorax a^id Pelvis resulting the7xfrom. Os. F. e. Angular Curvature from Tubermlosis of the Vertebrce. Os. F. e. 1 (347). A very marked and typical example of this con- dition, consisting of the natural skeleton of an adult, in which the bodies of the third dorsal to the third lumbar vertebrae have been almost completely destroyed by Tubercle, and their remains fallen together, so that the second dorsal has become closely approximated to the third lumbar, while the spinous processes of the destroyed vertebne form a prominent projection or hump- back in the dorsal region. The ribs are closely approximated, and appear of unusual length ; they are all directed very obliquely downwards and forwards in lines nearly parallel with the lower part of the spine, and their extremities reach below the crests of the ilia. The posterior ends of the ninth and twelfth ribs, inclu-' sive, have suffered from a similar tubercular destruction to that seen in the bodies of the corresponding vertebrae. The fourth left rib is bifid at the anterior extremity. In the pelvis the con- stituent bones are unusually thin, and shew scarcely any development of the parts for the attachment of muscles ; in all probability there was paralysis of the lower extremities of long standing. The outlet of the pelvis is much contracted, while the conjugate diameter at the brim is elongated (kyphotic pelvis). The cervical spine is curved markedly forwards (lordosis) to com- pensate for the posterior curvature in the dorsal region, so that the head must have been deeply sunk between the shoulders. 'Os. F. e. 2 (512). A similar specimen, in which Tubercle has led to the destruction of the fifth and eleventh dorsal vertebrae, and consequent collapse of the bodies and angular curvature. 'Os. F. e. 3 (Y 41). The spinal column and pelvis of an adult woman, shewing a similar angular curvature, resulting from Tubercular destruction of the bodies of the sixth dorsal to the third lumbar vertebrae. The Pelvis is deformed in consequence of the spinal curvature ; its condition is usually described as kyphotic. The most prominent features of the deformity consist in the dispro- portionate increase in the antero-posterior diameter at the brim, this measuring 16 cm., and the contraction of all the diameters at the outlet in virtue of the approximation of the coccyx and ischial tubera.89 CURVATURES OF THE SPINE. A n tero-Posterior Cnrva tu re—Kyphosis. Os. F. e. 4 (403). The skull and spinal column of an adult. From the second cervical vertebra to the last lumbar the spine forms a single curve, the whole of which is more concave anteriorly than the normal dorsal curve. The different vertebrae are for the most part anchylosed to each other by the same kind of bony outgrowths from the margins of the bodies as have been described in Arthritis Deformans. The occiput is firmly anchy- losed by bone to the atlas, and the latter to the axis. The posterior ends of the ribs are included in the anchylosis in the dorsal spine. [Other specimens in the Museum are Os. F. b. 2 (Y 16), and Os. F. b. 4 (Y 17).] Lateral Curvature—Scoliosis— Rotation-L ateral Curvature. Os. F. e. 5 (510). The natural skeleton of the trunk of an adult, which presents in the dorsal region a combination of rotation- lateral and antero-posterior curvature of the spine, together with associated deformity of the thorax and pelvis, all of which probably resulted from Rickets in early life. The antero-posterior curvature of the dorsal spine is so complete that the initial lateral curvature is masked to a large extent, and the vertebral bodies are rotated to the right to such a degree that their anterior surfaces look backwards as well as outwards ; while the apices of their spinous processes, in spite of the lateral curvature, together constitute a line which deviates but little from the middle line of the back. The thorax on the right side is much contracted ; the angles of the ribs, instead of being obtuse, are very sharply bent, so that they have come to lie in immediate contact with the bodies of the vertebrae, against which they are flattened ; the sixth and seventh ribs have been broken across in this situation, and partially reunited. The angles of the left ribs are very obtuse and almost obliterated, and their shafts are directed nearly horizontally outwards, enlarging this side of the thorax in compensation for the contraction of its right side. The hump-back in this specimen is formed by the displaced bodies of the vertebrae, covered by the ribs, and is situated to the right of the middle line. The Pelvis presents the condition which is termed flat, the conjugate at the brim being less than the normal. Os. F. e, 6 (513). Part of the spinal column and portions of the ribs, shewing similar alterations arising from rickets, as are described in the preceding specimen. Os. F. e. 7 (Y 45). Part of the spinal column and pelvis, presenting a very moderate degree of lateral curvature of the dorsal seg- ment, with the convexity to the right, together with compensatory curves in the cervical and lumbar regions in the opposite direc- tion. There is no appreciable amount of rotation of the ver- tebrae. I'heir bodies, however, and the intervertebral spaces are reduced in depth along the concavity of the different curves.90 CURVATURES OF THE SPINE. Os. F. e. 8 (Y 46). A spinal column, presenting a similar combina- tion of antero-posterior and lateral-rotation curvature (kypho- scoliosis), as has been seen in Specimens Os. f. e. 5 (510), and Os. f. e. 6 (513), probably also resulting from rickets in early life. The lateral curvature affects the dorsal spine, again with the convexity to the right, the vertebrae being also rotated in the same direction ; the bodies of the latter and the intervertebral spaces are greatly reduced in depth along the concavity of the curve. The ribs present the same alterations as have been already described in Specimen Os. f. e. 5 (510). Os. F. e. 9 (Y 44). An articulated spinal column and pelvis, shewing a moderate degree of lateral curvature, of which the convexity is to the left in the dorsal region, while in the lumbar region it is directed to the right. The vertebrae are markedly rotated, the anterior surface of the bodies constituting the convexity of the curves. The pelvis is asymmetrical (scoliotic), the constituent bones being imperfectly developed, the symphysis displaced to the right side, and the sacrum abnormally flat. The right oblique diameter of the brim is 2 cm. less than the left oblique. Os. F. e. 10. One of the dorsal vertebrae and two ribs from a case of rotation-lateral curvature, in which the convexity was to the right. The bones are anchylosed to each other by new bone occupying the position of the ligaments uniting the ribs to the vertebra. The vertebra is characteristically asym- metrical ; its body is wedge-shaped, the apex of the wedge occu- pying the concavity of the curve. Its articular and transverse processes and the lamina on the concave side are compressed and atrophied, while those on the convex side are correspondingly increased in size and are wide apart. The spinous process is markedly twisted to the left or concave side, while the anterior aspect of the body faces to the right. The ribs, which belong to the convex side of the curve, present a sharp curve forwards immediately beyond their tubercles; anteriorly, on the other hand, they are quite straight. Their shafts are broad and flat. Os. F. e. 11 (416). Four dorsal vertebrae, from a case of rotation- lateral curvature, in which the laminae and articular processes are anchylosed along the concavity of the curve. Os. F. e. 12 (426). Six dorsal vertebrae, anchylosed to each other by bone, and presenting a very unusual degree of lateral curva- ture, with the convexity of the curve to the right, and unaccom- panied by any rotation of the vertebrae. Os. F. e. 13(Ys6). Two dorsal vertebrae, from a case of rotation- lateral curvature of the spine ; the bodies are characteristically wedge-shaped, the base of the wedge occupying the convexity of the curve. The posterior arches are distorted, and the spinous processes twisted, so that their apices point to the convexity of the curve. The articular processes and laminae on the convex side are anchylosed together. [Other specimens in the Museum are Os. D. i. i (508), and Os. D. e. i (Y 59).]9 DEFORMITIES OF THE PELVIS.

Distortions of the Pelvis from Osteomalacia. Os. F. g. 1 (Y 49). The dried pelvis and lumbar spine of an adult, shewing the most extreme distortion from antecedent osteomalacia. The cavity of the brim is reduced to a tri-radiate fissure by the downward and forward displacement of the lumbar vertebrae and sacrum, and by the pushing inwards of the lateral walls of the pelvis at the cotyloid cavities, and by the approxi- mation of the sides of the pubis ; the latter bones are almost parallel with each other, while the symphysis forms a projection in front; hence the term ‘‘beak-shaped pelvis.” The sacrum is compressed, so that the tip of the coccyx is closely approximated to the promontory. The ilium on either side is folded on itself at an acute angle. The structure of the lumbar vertebrae, as seen in the sawn section through one of them, is partly rarefied and partly sclerosed. Os. F. g. 2 (Y 51). A similar specimen, in which the pubic bones- are fused with each other in the middle line, so that the con- jugate diameter at the brim is reduced to 4*5 cm. The hori- zontal ramus of the pubis on the right side has been broken across. The Caesarean section was performed on the woman to whom the pelvis belonged by the late Dr Henderson of Perth. The specimen is figured in Professor Hamilton’s Prac- tical Observations.92 DEFORMITIES OF THE PELVIS. Os. F. g. 3 (Y 47). A similar specimen, obtained from a woman on whom Professor Hamilton unsuccessfully performed the Caesarean operation, and described by him in his Pniciical Observations. The various diameters are inscribed on the specimen. Os. F. g. 4 (Y 50). A similar pelvis, from a woman on whom the Caesarean operation was unsuccessfully performed in the Royal Infirmary, under the direction of the late Professor Young. The specimen is figured in Professor Hamilton’s Practical Observa- tions, Plate IX. The various diameters are inscribed on the specimen. Os. F. g. 5 (Y 48). A similar specimen, in which fracture has occurred through the horizontal ramus of the pubis, and through the descending ramus at its junction with the ischium. Os. F. g. 6 (Y 52). A similar specimen, in which the pelvic outlet is especially contracted by the approximation of the ischial tubera and the anterior curvature of the lower part of the sacrum and coccyx. Os. F. g. 7 (517). A similar pelvis, in which the constituent bones are remarkably light, porous, and fragile. [For distortions of the pelvis resulting from rickets, see Bone, Diseases of— Rickets.

Congemtal Malformations of the Skull. Os. G. a. Cojigenital Deficie^icies in the Sktill resulting from hicomplete Ossification (Osteogenesis Cranii Imperfecta). Os. G. a. 1 (Y 169). A skull-cap, presenting two rounded apertures in the parietal bone on either side, close to the sagittal suture, and in the situation of the parietal foramina, large enough to admit the tip of the little finger, and occupied by a fibrous mem- brane belonging to the pericranium. The skull-cap in other respects is well developed.93 MALFORMATIONS OF THE SKULL. Os. G. a. 2 (Y 169a). A skull-cap, presenting two elongated gaps in the parietal bone on either side, close to the posterior superior angle, and, like the apertures in the preceding specimen, per- fectly symmetrical. Looking at the calvarium from within, the lambdoidal suture is seen to be imperfectly closed ; while the fossae along the line of the superior longitudinal sinus, produced by the pressure of Pacchionian bodies, are unusually large and deep. Os. G. a. 3 (Y 117). A skull-cap, presenting three very remarkable gaps in the posterior segment of the vertex ; two of them are situated symmetrically near the upper and hinder angle of the parietal bones, while the third occupies the middle line of the occiput immediately beneath the apex of the lambdoidal suture. Two of the apertures are large enough to admit the middle finger; they are oval in shape, and the margins are smooth and rounded off An unobliterated suture runs between the aperture in the left parietal and that in the occipital, crossing the lambda at a right angle. The coronal suture is unusually distinct on the inner surface of the skull. The surface of the outer table is rough and uneven. (From a woman aged-25. Described and figured by Professor Sir W. Turner, Edhu Med. Jonrn. 1865.) Overlapping of the Bor.es of ll:e Skull at the Suiuies. Os. G. a. 4 (Y 117^)- The skull-cap of an adult, presented to the Museum by Professor Hughes Bennett. The calvarium is small, light, and unusually vaulted both from side to side and from before backwards, and the component bones overlap each other in a very remarkable way. At the lambda the occiput over- rides the parietals, its upper margin forming a very prominent ridge across the posterior segment of the vertex. Along the sagittal suture there is merely an exaggeration of the normal amount of alternate overlapping of the two bones. At the coronal suture the parietals override the frontal bone, so that the margins of the former and of the latter stand out as prominent ridges on the outer and inner surfaces of the skull respectively. The frontal suture is persistent and very prominent, from the tendency of the left half to override the right portion. The, squamous temporal overrides the parietal at the squamous suture on either side. All the sutures are ossified and rigid in the positions that have been described. The bones themselves, as seen in the sawn section, are unusually thin, there being scarcely any diploe between the two tables. Os. G. a. 5 (Y 117^)- A flattened, badly-formed skull-cap, thin and light, and presenting at the coronal suture an unusual degree of overlapping of the bones. In the middle the parietals overlaj) the frontal, but at the sides the frontal overlaps the parietals : this is precisely the reverse of the normal arrangement, and makes the skull-cap appear constricted at the coronal suture. The outer surface of the bones is rough and uneven ; there is scarcely any diploe remaining between the two tables.94 SENILE ATROPHY OF THE SKULL. Senile Changes in the Skull. Os. G. b. Senile Atrophy—Malum Senile (Virchozv). Os. G. b. 1 (Y 119). A skull, which is comparatively small and unusually light. The outer surface of the vertex is rough and uneven, and presents numerous vascular foramina. The sutures are obliterated ; there is a broad shallow groove in the position of the sagittal suture. The parietal eminence on either side has disappeared, and in its place there is a large triangular fossa, which is sharply bounded externally by the temporal ridge. The bone in the depressed area is thin and translucent, and is minutely perforated for vessels. The diploe, as seen in the sawn section, is of unequal thickness, and is unusually porous. The groove for the main branch of the middle meningeal artery is so deep that its floor is formed by the external table. The inner table is irregularly bossed and thickened, especially in the left half of the- frontal bone. (Described and figured in Paget’s Lectures on Surgical Pathology., edited by Turner, third edit., p. lOI.) Os. G. b. 2 (ll8a). The atrophied calvarium of an old man, presenting a comminuted fracture in the right parietal region, together with multiple-fissured fracture, extending probably into the base of the skull of the same side, and across the vertex into the temporal and mastoid regions on the left side. The injuries occurred shortly before death. The skull-cap is very thin and light, and presents symmetrical depressed areas in the parietal bones similar to those described in the preceding specimen. Os. G. b. 3 (Y 180). Another skull-cap from an atrophied skull, in which the parietal depressions are well marked ; they occupy the situation of the parietal eminence, and are shaped like a triangle, with the corners rounded, while the base of the triangle corres- ponds to the temporal ridge. The bone in the depressed area is , thin and translucent, and apparently consists of the internal table only. The margins of the fossa gradually merge into the thicker surrounding bone. The inner surface of the calvarium is very rough and uneven, and presents along the middle line numerous depressions for Pacchionian bodies. The inner surface of the parietals on either side presents a close network of vascu- lar grooves, which is very characteristic. The diploe is small in amount, and is sclerosed in structure. Os. G. b. 4(Y i8oa). A skull-cap from an aged subject, resembling the preceding specimens, but shewing an extreme degree of general atrophy. It is relatively small, but markedly arched, and rounded in form. It is very light and thin ; the sawn sec- tion of the bones shews an average thickness of 1-2 mm., the diploe having practically disappeared.SENILE ATROPHY OF THE SKULL. 95 Os. G. b. 5 (Y1806). A skull-cap resembling the preceding speci- mens, in which, however, the external atrophy is present to a very slight degree, while there is a considerable deposit of new bone on the meningeal aspect. The bone, as seen in the sawn section, is of considerable, although unequal, thickness, ranging from 5-15 mm. Internally the skull presents a very uneven surface, partly due to the depth and unusually close ramification of the grooves for the meningeal vessels, and partly to the deposit of new bone on the inner table in the areas between these grooves. The thickening by new bone is most marked in the frontal bone and along the line of the superior longitudinal sinus. Os. G. b. 6 (Y124). A skull-cap, shewing great unevenness of the surface of the inner table ; along the line of the superior longi- tudinal sinus there are numerous large Pacchionian depressions ; the lateral portions present ridges and depressions on the surface which correspond with the cerebral convolutions. Os. G. b. 7 (Y 123). A skull which presents to a moderate degree the changes resulting from senile atrophy. Os. G. b. 8 (Y 122). A skull-cap which is flattened and consider- ably increased in weight. The surface of the outer table is somewhat rough and uneven, especially in the region of the parietal eminences. The diploe is increased in amount, and is condensed. There has been a considerable deposit of new bone on the surface of the inner table. Unilateral Atrophy of the Skull—He7niatrophia Facialis. Os. G. c. [No specimens.] Unilateral Hypertrophy aiid Hyperostosis of the Skull. Os. G. d. Os. G. d. 1. The skull of a male subject which has been rendered remarkably asymmetrical by a pathological overgrowth, involving the bones of the left half of the skull, and ceasing abruptly at the middle line. The overgrowth does not extend behind the plane of the mastoid, and may be said to correspond closely with the distribution of the different branches of the fifth nerve on the left side. The alterations seen in the specimen consist, firstly, in a hypertrophy of the affected bones, so that these are larger than those of the opposite side; secondly, in a nodular and bossy thickening (hyperostosis) of the different bones, seen especially in the zygoma, alveolar margin of upper jaw and pterygoid plates of sphenoid; and thirdly, in the formation of bony tumours (exostoses), the largest of which projects from theg6 OVERGROWTH OF THE BONES OF THE SKULL. internal table of the frontal bone into the cranial cavity. All the foramina and canals in the base of the skull are enlarged on the left side, more especially those through which the branches of the fifth nerve pass; the apertures also in the bones of the face, which transmit the terminal branches of the same nerve, are very distinctly enlarged.

Increase in Thickness of the Bones of the Skull from Chronic Inflammation (Cranitis Chronica), in- cluding Osteitis Deformans., Hyperostosis of the Skull., Cfc. Os. G. e. Os. G. e. 1 (504a). The right half of the skull of an adult, shewing a great increase in thickness and alteration in the structure of the bones of the cranium. All the sutures are obliterated. The outer surface of the bones is finely porous or spongy, and is per- forated by innumerable apertures for blood-vessels. The inner surface is also minutely perforated for vessels, and the grooves for the branches of the meningeal arteries are enlarged and un- usually complicated. The sawn surface of the bone is for the most part dense and compact like limestone, especially in the region of the internal table ; towards the outer table the bone is irregularly porous or cancellous. The above changes are probably the result of Osteitis Deformans. Os. G. e. 2 (503). A portion of a similar cranium. Os. G. e. 3 (504). A similar specimen. Os. G. e. 4 (180).

As a result of this change, the cerebral aspect of the skull-cap is irregular and very uneven, especially on the two halves of the os frontis, where it is nodulated and hillocky. The Pacchionian depres- sions along either side of the middle line are very distinct. Os. G. e. 5 (502). The greater part of the frontal bone, shewing a similar condition, but in which the entire thickness of the bone is remarkably sclerosed, shewing no trace of its original arrange- ment of two tables and intervening diploe. The thickening is very irregular, and causes nodular bumps on the cerebral aspect of the bone. The surface of the inner table is minutely per- forated for vessels.OVERGROWTH OF THE BONES OF THE SKULL. 97 Os. G. e. 6 (Y 160). The skull-cap of a West Indian negro, in which the outer table is remarkably thickened and altered in structure over the entire area of the vertex, excepting the portion on either side covered by the temporal fascia, which is normal. The thickened outer table presents on the pericranial aspect a close, honeycomb-like arrangement of the cancelli, the spaces here and there, however, being filled up with bone, so that the surface layer is in parts compact. The skull-cap is very greatly increased in weight. The surface of the inner table is normal. (Presented by Professor Sir William Turner.) Changes in the Skull believed to be caused by Rickets. Os. G. f. Os. G. f. 1 (506). A portion of the frontal bone from a rickety subject, shewing considerable inequality in its thickness ; the surface of the outer table has a rarefied, spongy appearance, to be associated with an increased vascularity of the pericranium. The substance of the bone is made up of a cancellous diploe. Os. G. f. 2(Y6i). The skull-cap of a child, in which the anterior fontanelle remains open. On the outer surface of the skull, a little below and behind the parietal eminence on either side, there is a well-defined circular elevation or node, consisting of newly-formed spongy bone. That on the left side is much more spongy, and occupies a larger area than that on the right. The outer table is otherwise normal. The surface of the inner table shews more extensive changes, of the nature of “ osteoporosis,” affecting symmetrical areas in the parietals and two halves of the frontal. The inner surface of the occipital is similarly affected. The change is most advanced at the centre of ossification of the affected bones, where it probably commenced, and then extended towards the margins. The inner table, instead of forming a compact layer, is now intersected by grooves and fissures, cross- ing each other in every possible direction, and forming a close network. In the lambdoid suture there are a number of Wormian bones. Os. G. f. 3 (505)* The parietal bones of a child, which had prob- ably suffered from rickets ; the bones are thickened, and con- sist of a light, dry, porous, and friable tissue, the external surface of which is rough, and the internal surface minutely perforated for blood-vessels. Os. G. f. 4 (505^)- The left parietal of an infant, in which the bone is thickened and friable; the entire outer surface, with the exception of the region of the parietal eminence, is rough, spongy, elevated, in parts like coarse woollen cloth. Towards the posterior-inferior angle there are three circular apertures in the bone. It is difficult to say whether the above changes are the result of rickets or congenital syphilis.

Os. G. g. Os. G. g. 1 (288a). A preparation in spirit of the brain, calvarium, and scalp, in which nearly the entire anterior half of the vertex of the skull has been cast off or exfoliated as a result of necrosis. The exposed membranes are in a condition of advanced suppura- tive meningitis, and the dura shews a large circular aperture, through which pus from beneath the dura escaped externally. The meningitis extended to the base of the brain. Os. G. g. 2 (288). A frontal bone, shewing one very large and several smaller gaps in that portion of it which forms the fore- head, probably the result of necrosis, which has chiefly affected the outer table. Os. G. g. 3 (245). Portions of the occipital and parietal bones, shewing a large gap in the occipital bone a little to the left of the apex of the lambda. The margins of the gap are irregularly eaten out, and the surface of the surrounding bone is the seat of considerable new formation on the pericranial aspect. Os. G. g. 4 (294). Several plate-like sequestra of considerable size, exfoliated from the outer table of the skull. Os. G. g. 5 (B 19). An exfoliation from the outer table of the parietal bone. allingall Collectioni) Syphilitic Diseases of the Bones of the Skull and Face. Os. G. h. Os. G. h. 1 (334). A specimen in which numerous gummata have developed in the substance of the pericranium or external periosteum, and produced changes in the cranial bones which are characteristic of advanced syphilis. At the outer angle of the right orbit the outer table has been destroyed over a limited area, leaving a circular gap in which the diploe is exposed; the surface of the diploe is very irregular, and its tissue is con- densed ; in the upper part of the frontal plate there is a similar sharply-defined gap in the outer table, oval in shape, with smooth bevelled edges; the diploe exposed in this area has been to a large extent destroyed and removed by ulceration, and the inner table is perforated over a corresponding area. In the parietal bones there have been three similar circular ulcers, two of which are re- presented by depressed radiating scars in the outer table. There is no formation of new bone in the vicinity of any of the ulcers.99 SYPHILITIC DISEASES OF THE SKULL. Os. G. h. 2 (335). Another characteristic specimen of advanced syphilis of the skull, in which certain of the gummata probably had developed in the substance of the diploe, as well as in the peri- cranium. With one exception, the gummatous destruction of the bone has resulted in perforation of the skull; most of the perfora- tions are small, sharply cut, as if produced by a worm ; in the right parietal there is a large gap, irregularly circular in shape, in which the outer table is destroyed over a much larger area than the internal, the exposed diploe surrounding the gap being “worm-eaten” and irregularly pitted. Os. G. h. 3 (336). The base of a skull, shewing an advanced condi- tion of gummatous destruction of the mastoid and petrous por- tions of the left temporal bone; the skull is perforated, and the middle and internal ear destroyed. Os. G. h. 4 (337)- A skull-cap, shewing four characteristic scars in the outer table, which have followed upon localised destruction of the bone, produced by gummata in the pericranium. In the left parietal bone there still remains a circular gap in the outer table ; the diploe, however, exposed in the floor of the ulcer presents a smooth condensed layer on the surface. Os. G. h. 5 (341). A skull-cap, shewing numerous excavations and perforations resulting from gummata, which have developed both in the pericranium and in the tissue of the diploe, and caused changes in the bones after the manner already described. Os. G. h. 6 (342). Portions of the skull-cap of a woman who had suffered from syphilis, and who had gone through several full courses of mercury. The whole thickness of the skull has been extensively removed by a process of gummatous destruction (syphilitic cario-necrosis) over a large area, obviously produced by the confluence of isolated circular areas of destruction. New bone has been extensively formed in the situation of the inner table, reproducing the latter. Os. G. h. 7 (332). The skull of an adult, in which the bones of the vertex over a large area are almost completely destroyed, as a result of gummatous deposit and inflammation. The affected area has a serpiginous margin, and represents several isolated foci of disease, which have become confluent, partly by exfolia- tion of the portions of the skull intervening between the different foci. Anteriorly in the region of the left orbit healing appears to have occurred, while posteriorly in the region of the left parietal the destruction is still proceeding, with a sharply-cut edge and exfoliation on the surface. Os. G. h.. 8 (33^)- skull-cap, in which the entire extent of the outer table and isolated portions of the inner table have suffered a partial destruction from gummatous inflammation. There are no large sequestra of the outer table nor large perforations; thelOO SYPHILITIC DISEASES OF THE SKULL. outer surface is honeycombed with small ulcers, which have coalesced with each other to form a continuous irregular carious surface. Os. G. h. 9 (339). The skull-cap of a woman of 22, who died of hepatic and renal disease, and who had suffered at a previous period from syphilitic disease of the skull. The outer table in the frontal and parietal regions is extensively depressed and scar- like on the surface, and minutely perforated for vessels, and had probably exfoliated in considerable pieces at the previous period referred to above. The pericranium is stated to have been much thickened. Os. G. h. 10 (340). A skull-cap in which both the outer and inner tables are superficially ulcerated over an extensive area. That on the outer aspect is of older standing, and is probably the result of gummatous inflammation, starting in the pericranium, and in the frontal plate has terminated in repair, with numerous radiat- ing depressed scars. Os. G. h. 11 (343). A portion of the skull-cap preserved in spirit, with the arteries of the pericranium injected, shewing several small, rounded, sharply-cut perforations, extending through both tables of the skull. Os. G. h. 12 (Y 120). The skull-cap of an adult, shewing a hemi- spherical bulging in the centre of the vertex, which corresponds to an area of irregular excavation on the cerebral aspect, apparently produced by a growth originating in the dura mater, probably gummatous in character. There are several smaller excavations on the inner surface of the skull, two of which have perforated the outer table. Os. G. h. 13 (Y 121). The skull-cap from a subject in the Dissecting- Rooms, shewing a large irregular opening in the region of the right parietal eminence, of which the edges are bevelled and smooth. External to this opening there are two smaller aper- tures of a similar character, separated from the former and from each other by a narrow bridge or septum of bone. The surface of the inner table around these openings is irregularly grooved and worm-eaten. At the junction of the coronal and sagittal sutures in the outer table there is a small oval depression, with smooth edges and floor, which probably represents the results of a pericranial gumma in the healed condition. The surface of the outer table surrounding the depression is minutely perforated for blood-vessels. Os. G. h. 14 (Y 116). The skull-cap from a case of Prof. Laycock’s in the Royal Infirmary, which presents on the inner surface, at the junction of the frontal and parietal bones on the left side, a large hollow area, resulting from the elevation and absorption of the bone in this area by the pressure of a tumour growing from within the skull, probably a gumma of the, dura mater. The expanded bone of the vault of this area is largely replaced by aSYPHILITIC DISEASES OF TPIE SKULL. lOI fibrous membrane. The surface of the outer table is very un- even and rough, especially about the centre of the vertex, where there are several large shallow depressions, which probably repre- sent the results of pericranial gummata in the healed condition. Os. G. h. 15 (Y6o). A skull-cap which is notably increased in weight; the surface of the outer table is irregularly tuberculated and thickened, and is marked with innumerable foramina and narrow-starred fissures, the latter shewing a tendency to be limited to circular patches ; these changes probably result from a diffuse gummatous hyperplasia of the pericranium. The surface of the inner table is minutely perforated and grooved for blood-vessels. Os. G. h. 16(Bio). The greater portion of a frontal bone, shewing great thickening and sclerosis of the diploe from chronic syphi- litic ostitis. On the surface of the outer table there are several large smooth depressions, resulting from gummatous ulcers, which have healed. {Ballingall Collection. Presented by Dr J. A. Sidey, Edinburgh.) Os. G. h. 17 (295a). The bones of the upper part of the Face. The nasal bones, superior maxillae, palate bones, turbinates, and vomer have all suffered from a gummatous ulceration, originating in the nose. The nasal septum is completely removed, and likewise the posterior half of the palate. The anterior orifice of the nose is narrowed by new bone formed in connection with the nasal margins of the superior maxillae, so that it is repre- sented by a vertical fissure. Os. G. h. 18 (295). A portion of the vomer, exfoliated in a case of gummatous ulceration of the nose. Os. G. h. 19 (344). A dissected preparation in spirit of the base of a skull and pharynx from a syphilitic subject in the dissecting- rooms, shewing a small circular perforation a little to one side of the middle line of the hard palate anteriorly, and a large rounded opening in the posterior portion of the palate, with complete destruction of the epiglottis and greater part of the velum pen- dulum palati. The parts have cicatrised. Os. G. h. 20 (123). The skull of a child shewing changes, the result of Congenital Syphilis; the anterior fontanelle remains widely open, and the frontal suture is not yet obliterated. The outer table of the two halves of the frontal, and of the parietals bounding the fontanelle, is the seat of considerable bony en- crustation or deposit, coarsely porous or cloth-like in texture. In the frontals the new bone occupies a roughly circular area, and forms a flattened boss, symmetrical on the two sides. In the parietals the encrustation is much more extensive, especially in that of the left side, in which every part of the outer aspect is crusted over, with the exception of a small area in the position of the eminence. There is a slight amount of similar roughening on the vertical plate of the occipital bone and in the frontal por- tion of the orbital cavities. The left half of the body of the lower jaw presents a nodular thickening of its external surface.102 TUMOURS OF THE BONES OF THE SKUT.L. Tuberculosis of the Tories of the Skull. Os. G.

Capsule not thickened, but slightly adherent. Surface smooth, and shews several small cortical cysts. Both the surface of the organ and the cortex on section shew characteristic mottling, and also very numerous small irregular red points, a few of which are haemorrhagic in origin, but the majority of which are due to congestive dilatation of vessels. The stellate veins and vasa recta are congested. The patient —a man aged 30—was ill for two months with “rheumatic pains,” acute symptoms supervening weeks before his death, which occurred after a sudden attack of uraemic convulsions.

Presented by Professor Laycock. Gen.-U. A. p. 3 (1273). Granular Contracted Kidney. Injected with carmine. The capsule is very much thickened and very adherent, stripping imperfectly in layers, and leaving a rough granular surface. This is to a large extent due to the produc- tion of a supplementary circulation from branches of the lumbar arteries supplying the perinephric fat, which anastomose with the vessels of the capsule and pelvis of the kidney; these in turn anastomose with the more superficial vessels in the kidney substance, and are seen injected in the specimen. On section^ the cortex is atrophied and its vascular markings are very irregular. The larger vessels are greatly thickened, and there is marked increase in the amount of pelvic fat, the small vessels of which have become injected from the renal artery, demonstrating the presence of the collateral anastomosis above mentioned. Presented by Professor Sanders, June 20, 1872. Gen.-U. A. p. 4 (U. 3). Chronic Granular Contraction of Kidney. Partially injected with carmine. Capsule thickened and adherent; surface irregular and shewing small cysts. The whole organ is atrophied, a change due mainly to diminution of the cortex. Vessels greatly thickened. Pelvic fat increased in amount. Gen.-U. A. p. 5 (1274). Chronic Granular Contraction of Kidney, with superadded Acute Catarrhal Nephritis. Injected; artery red, vein blue. The organ is small and firm; its capsule thickened and adherent, and the surface finely granular and shewing several cysts.

Granular Contracted or “ Cirrhotic ” Kidney, with Secondary Catarrh and Fatty Degeneration. From a case of aortic incompetence in a man of 58. The organ is small in size. The capsule was thickened and adherent, separating imperfectly, and leaving thin shreds attached to the irregularly granular surface. O71 section^ there is marked pallor. Hence the term, “ small pale,” or “ small white, granular contracted ” kidney. There is very marked irregular thinning of the super- ficial cortex, the deep cortex being relatively less affected, and shewing more distinct mottling, with opaque whitish points. The pelvic fat is relatively increased in amount in order to fill the space left by the atrophy of the organ. Presented by Professor Greenfield, 1905. Gen.-U. A. p. 10. Granular Contracted or “Cirrhotic” Kidney, with advanced Atrophy. From a female aged 48, with chronic interstitial pneumonia and bronchiectasis, and greatly degener- ated blood-vessels. The kidney is very much diminished in size. The capsule was thickened and adherent, and, on stripping, has left a surface which is very irregular and “granular,” shewing red and white mottling, and numerous cortical cysts. On section^ the cortex—both superficial and deep—is greatly atrophied, and contains several cysts. It is very irregular in arrangement, and presents a mottled appear- ance. The fat at the hilum has extended inwards to fill the space left by the atrophy of the deep cortex. The vessels are much thickened. Presented by Professor Greenfield, 1905. Gen.-U. A. p. 11.

The capsule is much thickened and is adherent both to the surrounding perinephric fat and to the surface of the kidney, which is very granular, and shews atrophic sulci and marked mottling. On section, the cortex shews commencing atrophy, more especially of its superficial portion, it is irregularly mottled with small yellowish patches, and presents extensive catarrhal and fatty changes, especially in the deep or interpyramidal cortex, which is much swollen. Presented by Professor Greenfield, 1905. Gen.-U. A. p. 14. Kidney from a case of Chronic Lead Poisoning in a man aged 45. The changes present in this specimen are not those usually found in lead poisoning, which more commonly produces a form of chronic granular contraction.

Left organ from a patient, aged 64, shewing a large, irregularly rounded tumour situated in the outer part of the organ, where it has infiltrated and replaced the entire thickness of the kidney substance. It has also invaded the pelvis of the organ, and two smaller masses are seen between the infundibula. The surface of the tumour is irregularly nodulated, and several smaller nodules are also seen on the surface of the kidney, as are also some small collapsed cysts. Large irregular areas of softening and haemorrhage are seen on the cut surface of the tumour, which exhibits “ an irregular medullary ” arrangement.265 TUMOURS AND CYSTS. Gen.-U. A. W. iii. 4 (1277).

Retention Cysts in Kidney. Specimen shewing several of these in the cortex, especially near the surface of the organ. They are due to blocking and distension of the secreting tubules, more rarely of the glomeruli.266 KIDNEY. Gren.-U. A. W. vi. 3 (1311-1312). Retention Cysts in Kidney. Organ shewing chronic interstitial changes; capsule thickened and adherent; lines of vessels in the cortex distorted and irregular; larger vessels shew fibrous thickening. A large retention cyst is seen at the lower part of the organ, and a number of similar smaller cysts are present in the cortex under the capsule, one of these being seen in section at the upper part of the cut surface. The adherent capsule has been stripped off the smaller section, and demonstrates that the cysts are in the substance of the organ. Arteries injected with vermilion. Gen.-U. A. W. vi. 4 (1306). Retention Cysts in Kidney. One large and several smaller cysts, due to blocking of the tubules and their subsequent dilatation with retained secretion, are seen bulging under the capsule. The latter is thickened and adherent. Gen.-U. A. W. vi. 5 (1305). Retention Cysts in Kidney. These are most frequently due to blocking and dilatation of tubules in the cortex. Other evidence of chronic interstitial change is seen in the imperfect stripping of the capsule which has been firmly adherent to the organ, irregular tags and layers of fibrous tissue being left still adhering to its surface. Over the largest retention cyst, the whole thickness of the capsule has been left, owing to the difficulty of removing it without tearing the cyst wall. The renal artery is injected, and shews marked thicken- ing of its walls. The pelvis (injected) and ureter are dilated. Gen.-U. A. W. vi. 6 (1314).

Mixed Malignant Tumour of Kidney involving the upper part of the organ. The surface shews irregular nodulation corresponding to the irregularly rounded, alveolar structure seen on section. Infiltration of the kidney substance is occurring at margin of tumour, which appears to originate from suprarenal tissue. There is also cartilage present, the tumour being probably due to embryonic intermingling. Gen.-U. A. W. vii. 2 (1291). Mixed Malignant Tumour of Kidney. Portion of a large carcinomatous tumour affecting the organ. The whole mass was very soft and extremely vascular, and weighed about 40 lbs. The cut surface shews an arrange- ment of the tumour into large irregularly rounded areas mapped out by lines of fibrous tissue. Translucent areas of cartilage are seen at some parts of the tumour, which has probably originated from embryonic intermingling of tissues.267 TUMOURS. Gen.-U. A. W. vii. 3. Tumour of Kidney. A mixed tumour, probably due to intermingling of the tissues during embryonic life. The upper part of the organ is occupied by an irregularly rounded mass divided up by dense fibrous septa, which enclose areas of new growth, which are at some parts soft and haemor- rhagic and at other parts composed of cartilage. In some parts there are cystic adenomatous spaces, while here and there can be seen small yellow masses of aberrant suprarenal gland tissue. Presented by Professor Greenfield, 1905. VIII. Teratomas.

Kidney shewing great dilatation of the pelvis, and infundibula, producing somewhat globular projections on the surface of the organ, somewhat resembling the condition of foetal lobulation; the substance of the kidney is much atrophied owing to the pressure of the retained secretion and the progressive loss of function. Gen.-U. B. C. 2 (1235). Hydronephrosis. The pelvis of the kidney is considerably dilated, the upper part of the ureter being blocked by the impaction of two calculi which are seen in situ; a calculus is also lodged in one of the upper calyces. The surface of the organ is very soft and rough, being covered ap- parently by fibrinous lymph, the result of some inflammatory condition, perhaps perinephritic abscess. The renal artery is very much thickened. Gen.-U. B. C. 3 (1234). Hydronephrosis—slight; the pelvis and infundibula are somewhat dilated and contain several small calculi. Gen.-U. B. C. 4 (1236). Hydronephrosis and Atrophy of the Kidney, due to impaction of renal calculus. The organ is small and irregular, the pelvis and infundibula being dilated into a series of sacculi in some of which calculi are still left in situ. S268 PELVIS OF KIDNEY AND URETER. Gen.-U. B. C. 5 (1237)- Hydronephrosis, due to blocking of the pelvis by a calculus. The infundibula have become distended into intercommunicating cyst-like spaces, with corresponding atrophy of the glandular substance. The specimen is injected to demonstrate the vascularity of the fibrous tissue walls of the spaces. Gen.-U. B. C. 6 (1223). Hydronephrosis, accompanied by almost complete atrophy of the secreting substance of the kidney. The ureter, pelvis and infundibula are dilated, probably owing to the blocking of the ureter by an impacted renal calculus, several small calculi having been passed by the patient. Gen.-U. B. C. 7 (1222). Slight Hydronephrosis of Right Kidney. The pelvis is laid open to demonstrate the degree of dilatation of the kidney and its infundibula. The whole kidney is enlarged, the capsule has been adherent, and there are several retention cysts under the surface, due to blocked and distended tubules in the cortex. Gen.-U. B. C. 8 (1218). Hydronephrosis. Kidney shewing dilatation of the ureter, pelvis, and infundibula, due to obstruc- tion of the urethra by an enlarged prostate, which is shewn still in position at the base of the bladder ; the enlarged middle lobe is seen bulging forwards and upwards into the vesical cavity. Gen.-U. B. C. 9 {I21ja). Hydronephrosis of the Left Kidney, due to the involvement of the ureter in a psoas abscess follow- ing tubercular disease of the spine. The specimen shews great dilatation of the pelvis and infundibula, with corresponding destruction of the secreting tissue of the organ. Presented by Professor Sir William Turner. Gen.-U. B. C. 10 (1216 and 1217). Hydronephrosis, etc. Prepara- tion of the kidneys, ureters and bladder, shewing a condition of hydronephrosis and dilatation of the ureters due to urethral obstruction resulting from malignant disease of the prostate; the muscular coat of the bladder is markedly hypertrophied; the prostate is enlarged and is the seat of a malignant growth which has infiltrated the base of the bladder, especially on the right side. Gen.-U. B. C. 11 (1345). Hydronephrosis and Dilatation of the Right Ureter, the result of obstruction to the outflow of urine, probably by stricture of the urethra, the muscular tissue of the bladder being also hypertrophied. As a consequence of the long continued pressure, which has also caused the dilatation of the ureter, pelvis, and infundibula, the glandular substance of the right kidney has undergone compression and atrophy, in the production of which condition an impairment or loss of function has probably also aided. Gen.-U. B. C. 12 (1215). Hydronephrosis, etc., the result of stricture of the urethra. The bladder is greatly dilated andHYDRONEPHROSIS. 269 hypertrophied. The right ureter is very much dilated, as is also the pelvis of the kidney, the organ being elongated, and its substance compressed and atrophied. The lumen of the left ureter is obliterated, and the left kidney is represented by a small mass of fibrous tissue, to which the normal suprarenal gland is still seen attached. Gen.-U. B. C. 13. Hydronephrosis. Dried specimen. The kidney substance has entirely disappeared, and the organ is represented by a large cyst-like structure, partially subdivided up into loculi, the walls of which are composed of the remains of the more resistent fibrous tissue framework and capsule of the kidney. The cause of the condition has been the blocking of the ureter by the impaction of a renal calculus, which is still seen in position. Gen.-U. B. C. 14 (1316). Hydronephrosis. Dried specimen. From man aged 38. Large cyst-like structure constituting the remains of the right kidney, the secreting tissue of which has been entirely destroyed owing to the distension of the pelvis of the organ following obstruction and obliteration of the ureter. The walls of the cyst have become extensively calcified; and it contained 18 oz. of a clear, straw-coloured fluid, mixed with crystals and masses of cholesterin. The renal vessels were extremely attenuated, and the cyst was firmly adherent to the inferior vena cava (seen in situ) and to the under surface of the liver. Gen.-U. B. C. 15 (1309). Slight Hydronephrosis. Several retention cysts are also present under the capsule. Gen.-U. B. C. 16 (1212). Flydronephrosis. Atrophy of the kidney, with destruction and disappearance of the entire secreting tissue of the organ, occurring in an old woman with aneurism of the coeliac axis. The condition has probably been due to blocking of the ureter, which has caused hydronephrosis, followed by absorption and contraction. Presented by Pro- fessor Hughes Bennett. Gen.-U. B.

D. d. 1 (1377)- Stricture of Urethra. The stricture, which is situated at the bulb, was treated by caustic. Unskilful use of the catheter has resulted in the formation of a false passage. The bladder is somewhat hypertrophied. Gen.-U. D. d. 2 (1401). Stricture of Urethra. The inflam- matory thickening and stricture are nearly two inches in length, and occupy the bulbous and membranous urethra. The mucous membrane of the bladder, which is everted, is covered at the parts with an inflammatory exudate. Gen.-U. D. d. 3 (1405). Stricture of Urethra. The situation of the stricture is at the bulb, behind which the canal is dilated. The bladder is very much contracted and hypertrophied. A bougie is inserted into an opening in the rectum, probably made by operation to reach an abscess in the region of the vesiculae seminales. Gen.-U. D. d. 4 (1408).

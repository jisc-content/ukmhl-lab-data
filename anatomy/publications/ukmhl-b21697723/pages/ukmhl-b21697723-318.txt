URINARY CALCULI. 300 Gen.-U. S. a. 12. Section of kidney-shaped laminated Calculus. Weight, 790 grains. Minute ash of phosphate and urate of lime. Gen.-U. S. a. 13. Oval, flattened laminated Calculus; exterior smooth. Minute ash of phosphate of lime. Gen.-U. S. a. 14. Oval laminated Calculus of a pale yellowish brown colour, with spaces between the laminae; outer surface somewhat tuberculated. Weight, 253 grains. Minute ash of phosphate and urate of lime. Gen.-U. S. a. 15. Section of a large oval Calculus, laminated; surface tubercular. Minute ash of phosphate of lime. Gen.-U. S. a. 16. Section of an oblong laminated Calculus with smooth exterior; slightly grooved on the surface in the trans- verse diameter. Minute ash of phosphate of lime. Gen.-U. S. a. 17. Lenticular laminated Calculus of a yellow ochre colour, with smooth surface; nucleus eccentric. Minute ash of phosphate of lime. Gen.-U. S. a. 18. Section of slightly hour-glass shaped Calculus, with a smooth exterior, but surface laminated. Minute ash of phosphate and urate of lime. Gen.-U. S. a. 19. Section of a large, oval laminated Calculus, centre somewhat cancellous; surface tuberculated. Length, 3|-inches; breadth, 2J inches: circumference, 9 inches. Minute ash of phosphate of lime. Gen.-U. S. a. 20. Section of an elongated Calculus, distinctly laminated; its elongation being due to the deposition of a number of laminae at one extremity, which do not extend around the Calculus. A groove on the surface marks the junction of these secondary laminae with the body of the Calculus; outer surface partly smooth, partly tuberculated. Length, 3 inches. Minute ash of phosphate of lime. Gen.-U. S. a. 21. Section of an oval laminated Calculus, 2 inches in length. Minute ash of phosphate of lime. Gen.-U. S. a. 22. Oval, flattened regularly laminated Calculus. Weight, 760 grains. Minute ash of phosphate of lime. Gen.-U. S. a. 23. One-half of a finely laminated oval Calculus. Length, 2 J inches. Minute ash of phosphate of lime. Gen.-U. S. a. 24. Small, rounded, laterally compressed laminated Calculus of a pale yellow colour. Weight, 78 grains. Gen.-U. S. a. 25. Ovoid, flattened laminated Calculus; nucleus excentric. Weight, 484 grains. Minute ash of phosphate of lime.

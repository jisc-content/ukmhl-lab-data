125 THROMBOSIS. Thrombosis and Embolism of Cerebral Vessels^ and their Results. N. A. k. N. A. k. 1. Thrombosis of Cerebral Sinuses. There is thrombosis of the superior longitudinal sinus in its whole extent. Several of the tributary veins on the surface of the brain are in a similar condition. Professor Hughes Bennettâ€™s case, 1875. N. A. k. 2 (1987Softening of the Brain. A large disintegrating area is seen in the white matter. No history. Probably the result of embolism or thrombosis of one of the cerebral arteries. N. A. k. 3 (1972). Absorption of Cerebral Substance, probably due to Embolism. Disappearance of several convolutions, and a depression an inch deep above the right Sylvian fissure and over the anterior part of the right lateral ventricle. Patient, aged 37, suffered from left-sided hemiplegia for seven years. The thoracic'and abdominal viscera were tuberculous. Cerebral Hcemorrhage. N. A. 1. N. A. 1. 1 (i955<^)- Cerebral Haemorrhage. The haemorrhage started at the base of the brain in the subarachnoid space. As usual in these cases, the blood has extended along the sulci in the region of the Sylvian fissures, and along the median aspect of the hemisphere and the corpus callosum. N. A. 1. 2 (1961). Cerebral Haemorrhage. An extravasation of blood with softening is seen towards the superficial part of the hemisphere, involving several convolutions. N. A. 1. 3 (1952). Cerebral Haemorrhage. An apoplectic cyst is situated in the right middle lobe. The arteries at the base of the brain shew patches of atheroma. Patient, a man aged 75, had two attacks within five weeks before death, and suffered from left-sided hemiplegia. N. A. 1. 4 (1953). Cerebral Haemorrhage. A large clot situated in the left temporo-sphenoidal lobe. In the centre of the hemi- sphere is a large area of softening, due to previous haemorrhage. N. A. 1. 5 (1954). Cerebral Haemorrhage. The base of the right temporo-sphenoidal lobe is broken up by an extensive extravasa- tion, which also fills the lateral ventricles. N. A. 1. 6 (1955). Cerebral Haemorrhage. The blood is effused into the right lateral ventricle, which is much distended with coagulum. N. A 1. 7 (1956). Cerebral Haemorrhage. Effusion of blood into the cerebral substance. N. A. 1. 8 (1958). Cerebral Haemorrhage. A large apoplectic clot, originally of a deep crimson colour, with a dense fibrous in- vestment.

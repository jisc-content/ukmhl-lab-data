2I8 BIl.IARY CALCULI. Al. K. t. 41. Portions of a large Biliary Calculus of a waxy appearance, and most probably composed of pure cholesterine. Al. K. t. 42. Nineteen Biliary Calculi, the largest about the size of a hazel nut. They all possess a mulberry-like appearance externally, and a brownish colour. Al. K. t. 43. A great number of small Biliary Calculi, most of which possess a lustrous appearance and are angular in form; also a number of fragments, some shewing the radiated crystal- line fracture. Al. K. t. 44. A number of small fragments of Biliary Calculi of a whitish appearance, some of which shew in a small degree the radiated crystalline fracture. Al. K. t. 45. A number of Biliary Calculi, white and angular in form ; also half of a rounded one, the cut surface of which shews concentric laminae. Al. K. t. 46. Three Biliary Calculi, one of a green colour, with here and there black spots of pigment; another white, and the other cretaceous-like externally; also several fragments, two of which shew concentric laminae. Al. K. t. 47. Nine Biliary Calculi of a yellowish-white colour and sub-angular in form. Al. K. t. 48. Twenty-one Biliary Calculi of a lustrous appearance and polygonal in shape; also other twenty-one smaller speci- mens somewhat similar in form. From a woman. Al. K. t. 49. Eight small fragments of Biliary Calculi, amorphous in shape. Al. K. t. 50. Four large Biliary Calculi, sub-angular in form and dark in colour; also five fragments of another Calculus. Al. K. t. 51. One roundish Biliary Calculus of a dark colour and about the size of a cherry; also two large angular Calculi of a lighter hue. The external surface of one of the latter is fissured. Al. K. t. 52. A number of nodulated Biliary Calculi, for the most part whitish externally, with circular stains of bile pigment. Al. K. t. 53. number of Biliary Calculi of angular form and of different shades of colour; also several fragments which exhibit internally the radiated appearance of a cholesterine deposit. Al. K. t. 54. Twenty-three whitish angular Biliary Calculi. Al. K. t. 55. Fourteen Biliary Calculi, the largest is about the size of a cherry, and has a short peduncle. The smaller specimens are angular in form.

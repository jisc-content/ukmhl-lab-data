BILIARY CALCULI. 21/ Al. K. t. 26 (1142). Four large Biliary Calculi of a dark colour, uniform in size and angular shaped. Al. K. t. 27 (1143)- An entire Biliary Calculus, irregular in form, rough externally, and of a dark colour; also three portions of another calculus, one of which exhibits in a marked manner the crystalline, laminated, and radiated characters of the cholesterine deposit with inspissated bile. Al. K. t. 28 (1144). Four fragments of a Biliary Calculus, dark in colour, and with the external surface rounded. Two of the pieces display near the periphery circular lamina. Al. K. t. 29 (1145).

K. t. 30 (1146). Three small entire Biliary Calculi and frag- ments of others from the Gall-bladder of a woman cet. 65. Al. K. t. 31 (1147). A small blackish and amorphous Biliary Calculus consisting of inspissated bile. Al. K. t. 32 (1148). Biliary Calculus from which a section has been removed to shew the internal radiated and crystalline structure. Al. K. t. 33 (1149). Two small Biliary Calculi, two of which present a tuberculated aspect externally. Al. K. t. 34 (1150). A Biliary Calculus about the size of a bean, of a dark colour, and angular shaped ; also a portion of another possessing the radiated crystalline character of cholesterine. Al. K. t. 35 (1151).

Numerous small fragmentary Biliary Calculi, from the subject from whom the cirrhosed liver Al. K. g. i (1038) was removed. Al. K. t. 37 (II53). Four angular Biliary Calculi, three of them dark from inspissated bile. Al. K. t. 38 (1154). Several Biliary Calculi which were impacted together in one of the ducts. Al. K. t. 39 (1155)- Two portions of two Biliary Calculi which had been passed by stool by a woman. Al. K. t. 40. The external portions of a large Biliary Calculus with its nuclear portion.

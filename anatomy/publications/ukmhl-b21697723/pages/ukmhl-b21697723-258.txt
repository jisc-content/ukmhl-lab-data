238 PNEUMONOKONIOSES. R. C. c. 8 (2331). Section of Pneumonic Lung shewing Grey Hepatisation and condensation. Pulmonic pleura greatly thick- ened. R. C. c. 9 (2334). Gangrenous Pneumonia. Lung in state of Grey Hepatisation throughout; irregular cavities with shreddy walls, especially towards posterior part of lower lobe, due to gangrenous softening. R. C. C. 10 (2332). Gangrenous Pneumonia. Portion of right Lung shewing black gangrenous patches at pleural surface. R. C. C. 11 (2332G(). Gangrene of right Lung. A large cavity, 5 inches by 4, was filled with a dark offensive fluid, and lined partially by a whitish membrane ; shreds of pulmonary substance hang into the cavity. R. C. C. 12 (23326). Portion of Lung containing a large cavity with gangrenous walls. Presented by Professor Hughes Bennett. R. C. C. 13 (2332c). Lung shewing extensive consolidation and containing a cavity with gangrenous walls. Pulmonic pleura discoloured. Presented by Professor Sanders. R. C. C. 14 (2397)- Broncho-pneumonia in Lung of child. Died of whooping-cough. R. C. C. 15 (23376). Piece of Lung injected shewing very minute grey granulations and masses of Caseous Pneumonia. Pneumonokonioses: A7ithracosis, Silicosis. R. C. d. R. 0. d. 1 (2474). Anthracosis. Left Lung from a coal miner. Deep black in colour. A cavity at the apex with defined walls, a few rounded bands pass across it. R. 0. d. 2 (2475)- Section of the right I-ung, from the same subject as above. R. 0. d. 3 (2476). Another portion of Lung, from the same case. R. 0. d. 4 (2477)- Anthracosis. A characteristic example of coal miner’s Lung. R. 0. d. 5 (L. i.) Coal Miner’s Anthracosis ; thickening of pleura, pigmented consolidation and formation of irregular cavities in the Lung. R. C. d. 6 (2371). Silicosis and Grey Hepatisation, fibroid nodules in Pleura and Lung. From a stone mason. Dr Gregory’s case. R. 0. d. 7 (2382). Silicosis. Lung of stone mason completely consolidated with Miliary Tubercle and Broncho-pneumonia. In some parts, especially in upper lobe and near pleural surface, rounded grey fibroid nodules from to ^ in. in diameter are seen. In upper lobe are irregular sinuous cavities, one of which has perforated the Pleura and led to Pyo-pneumo-thorax.

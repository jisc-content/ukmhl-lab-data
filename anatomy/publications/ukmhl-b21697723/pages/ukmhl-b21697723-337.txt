URINARY CALCULI. 319 Gen.-U. S. n. 5. Portion of an irregularly-shaped white and friable Calculus. It contains traces of urates of lime, ammonia, and magnesia, and carbonates of lime and magnesia. Gen.-U. S. n. 6. Large, irregular, soft, friable Calculus. Length, 3 inches; breadth, 2 inches. It is hollowed out posteriorly, as if a considerable part had been broken off. It is somewhat constricted anteriorly. Passing directly backwards in its antero- posterior axis is a deep groove, probably worn by the passage of a catheter. A minute quantity of urates of ammonia and lime. Gen.-U. S. n. 7. Wedge-shaped Calculus, the edges and angles of which are rounded and smooth; structure imperfectly laminated. Weight, 241 grains. Fusible phosphates, with some uric acid and urate of ammonia in imperfect laminae. Gen.-U. S. n. 8. Small, irregular, white, friable Calculus. Weight, 56 grains. Fusible phosphates, with sufficient carbonate of lime and magnesia to render the blow-pipe bead, which is transparent when hot, opaque on cooling. Traces of urate of lime and magnesia. Gen.-U. S. n. 9. Numerous fragments of a white, friable Calculus. Same composition as No. 6. Gen.-U. S. n. 10. Two portions of a small, white, friable Calculus. Removed from a woman in 1792. Weight, ii grains. Gen.-U. S. n. 11. Portions of a white, friable Calculus. Traces of the urates of lime and ammonia, also of carbonate of lime. Cut from a child. From the Bell Collection. Presented by Dr G. Bell. Gen.-U. S. n. 12. Small Calculus, rough and semi-crystalline on its outer surface; white and friable. Fusible phosphate, with small quantities of the carbonates of lime and magnesia. Gen.-U. S. n. 13. Section of a Calculus, weighing 3 oz. troy; cut from the vagina of a negress, cet. 20. Os vaginae was contracted, so as scarcely to admit a probe. Laminae arranged in a very regular manner. Fusible phosphates, with a small quantity of carbonate of lime, and a trace of carbonate of magnesia and oxalate of lime. Gen.-U. S. n. 14. Eight small Calculi, presenting a button- shaped or nipple-like appearance. Fusible phosphates, with a minute trace of the carbonate of lime.

274 BLADDER. Gen.-U. C. h. 5 (1384). Malignant Disease of the Bladder. Section of a tumour of firm consistence situated at the neck of the bladder. Most of the viscera were affected by secondary growths of malignant disease. From a female. Vesical Calculi. Gen.-U. C. i. Gen.-U. C. i. 1 (1336). Bladder which contained a calculus pro- ducing extensive ulceration of the mucous membrane. Middle lobe of prostate is somewhat enlarged. (See also specimens Cen.-U. C. c. i and 2; Gen.-U. C. d. i, 2, 10.) (For Collection of dry Vesical Calculi, see page 299.) M A L E URETHRA. GEN-.U. D. Malformations. Gen.-U. D. a. Gen.-U. D. a. 1 (1395). Diverticulum of the Urethra. An aperture, the size of a quill, in urethra, anterior to the bulb, communicates with a large sac situated in the perineum, and lined by a membrane similar to that of the urethra. The bladder is somewhat thickened and dilated ; the membranous urethra is irregularly thickened and contracted. Appended is the kidney from the same patient shewing commencing Hydronephrosis. Injuries to Urethra. Gen.-U. D. b. Gen.-U. D. b. 1 (1390). Unskilful employment of the catheter for repeated retention of urine has caused two false passages. One traverses the left lateral lobe of the prostate, the other the middle lobe, which is enlarged. Gen.-U. D. b. 2 (1391). d'he bladder and urethra are dissected to shew a fistulous passage produced by violent use of the catheter. It is about three inches long and does not enter the vesical cavity. The opening into the bladder through the entire thickness of the prostate was probably produced by use of the rectal trocar. The bladder is hypertrophied and sacculated. Gen.-U. D. b. 3 (1393)- Extensive rupture of the urethra with extravasation of urine into the pelvic cavity from a crush by a cart. The symphysis pubis and sacro-iliac articulation were dislocated.

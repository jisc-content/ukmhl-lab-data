Part of the wall from same cyst as the foregoing, shewing on its inner surface a layer of recent inflammatory lymph, which is as yet very imperfectly vascularised. Gen.-U. Q. f. 15 (1841). Compound Cystic Ovarian Adenoma. Injected. Part of the wall from same cyst as the foregoing, shewing on its inner surface a layer of recent inflammatory exudate, as yet very imperfectly vascularised. Gen.-U. Q. f. 16 (1842). Compound Cystic Ovarian Adenoma. Injected. Part of wall of same cyst as the foregoing, shewing on its inner surface inflammatory changes somewhat less marked than in specimens Gen.-U. Q. f. 13, 14, and 15. Gen.-U. Q. f. 17 (1843). Compound Cystic Ovarian Adenoma. Vessels injected. Preparation of the uterus and its appendages, exhibiting the section of a very large multiloculated cystic tumour growing from the left ovary. Gen.-U. Q. f. 18 (1844). Compound Cystic Ovarian Adenoma. Injected. Portion of a large tumour, which had been tapped, and removed by ligature, which produced the large aperture seen in the specimen.

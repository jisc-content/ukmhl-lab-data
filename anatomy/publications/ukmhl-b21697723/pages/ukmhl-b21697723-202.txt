Por- tion of small intestine from a man aged 30, died 1885, who had great enlargement of the lymphatic glands in abdomen and elsewhere. There was extensive infiltration of the walls of the stomach, duodenum, and small intestines, continuous with the masses of enlarged glands, and also numerous ulcers throughout the stomach and intestines. The specimen shews some small glands, infiltration of the submucosa, and ulceration. Presented by Professor Greenfield. Al. E. f. 18. From the same case. The infiltration has been fol- lowed by irregular ulceration in the vicinity of a Peyer’s patch. On the serous coat are seen several small nodules, which closely resemble those seen beneath tubercular ulcers. Al. E. f. 19. From the same case; shewing healthy Peyer’s patches, and a somewhat large transverse ulcer, with thickened edges. There are also minute shallow follicular ulcers.

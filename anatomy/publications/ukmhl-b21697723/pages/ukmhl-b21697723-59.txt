D. e. 9 (256). The shaft of a tibia, shewing syphilitic nodes, along its internal surface. Os. D. e. 10(262). The shaft of a tibia, shewing a node in its middle third. Os. D. e. 11 (263). A similar specimen. Restilts of Syphilitic Periostitis and Ostitis of a more diffuse character^ and resulting in the formation of new bone. Os. D. e. 12 (189). A Radius, shewing a spongy crust of new bone covering the lower fourth of its shaft. Os. D. e. 13 (193). An Ulna, in which the shaft in its upper two- thirds is nodularly thickened by a thick crust of periosteal spongy bone. Os. D. e. 14(195). An ulna, in which the upper part of the shaft is irregularly thickened as a result of chronic periostitis. Os. D. e. 15 (196). An ulna, shewing a diffuse spongy encrustation of its shaft. Os. D. e. 16 (197)- A similar specimen. Os. D. e. 17 (198). A similar specimen. Os. D. e. 18 (Y 31). The Femur of an adult, shewing a consider- able thickening of its shaft over an extensive area. Here and there the new bone on the surface is heaped up in a nodular fashion. Os. D. e. 19 (224). A femur, with scattered patches of spongy periosteal deposit. Os. D. e. 20 (233). A femur, in which the entire shaft is thickened in a nodular fashion. Os. D. e. 21 (212). The upper end of a femur, in which the shaft, as far up as the anterior intertrochanteric line, is thickened by periosteal deposit, together with sclerosis of the deeper layers. The bone has an earthy appearance as if it had been buried. Os. D. e. 22 (214). The upper two-thirds of a femur, from a subject of small stature.

207 CIRRHOSIS. Al. K. f. 6 (1035a). Liver shewing two large abscess cavities, with smooth walls and distinct lining membrane. The wall of the gall bladder shows some thickening. From the same case. Al. K. f. 7 (1036). Liver containing two abscesses. One of large size, in the left lobe, is lined with a distinct membrane; the smaller, in the right lobe, is the size of a walnut, and is supposed to have ruptured during life. Much recent lymph over the sur- face of liver and in peritoneal cavity. Patient, a man 22 years of age ; symptoms of one month’s duration. Al. K. f. 8 (1037). Liver shewing numerous deposits of lymph and pus, probably pyaemic. Microscopically it shews evidence of acute inflammation and softening of the tissue of the liver. From a man aged 50. Al. K. f. 9 (1037a). Part of Liver, shewing numerous abscess cavities, some of which were lined by a distinct membrane, and contained pus. The surface was uneven, owing to the projection of the sacs. The liver was greatly enlarged. Patient, a woman aged 24. Chronic Inflammation—Cirrhosis. Al. K. g. Al. K. g. 1 (1038). Part of Liver which was considerably enlarged, surface finely granular. On section numerous granular masses could be seen with a pocket lens, the centre of each of which was surrounded by a yellow areola. A few dark-coloured calculi were in the gall-bladder. Patient, a woman 43 years of age. Al. K. g. 2 (1039a). A small piece of Liver, shewing characteristic appearances of cirrhosis. Presented by Professor Henderson. Al. K. g. 3 (1040). Section of Liver, shewing characteristic appear- ances of common cirrhosis. The surface is extremely irregular and largely nodulated (“ hobnail ” liver). On section islets of liver tissue, surrounded by well-marked fibrous bands, can be seen. Al. K. g. 4 (1045). Common Cirrhosis of Liver, “ hobnail ” form (from the same specimen as Al. K. g. 3), shewing large areas of liver tissue enclosed by the fibrous bands, and the extremely granular character of the surface. Al. K. g. 5 (1041). Thin section from a Cirrhotic Liver, in which the portal system has been injected with vermilion. The section shews the partial exclusion of the injection from the granular masses. Al. K. g. 6 (1042). Section of Cirrhosed Liver. Portal vein and hepatic artery were injected with vermilion. The injection shews the vascularity of the fibrous bands. The surface is irregular and nodulated.

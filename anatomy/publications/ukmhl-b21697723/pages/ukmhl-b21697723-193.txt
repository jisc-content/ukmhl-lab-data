173 STOMACH. Al. D. g. 17 (947). Malignant Disease. A large nodular, cancerous mass near the pyloric end of the stomach, the centre of which has sloughed and ulcerated through the walls. The mucous membrane round the tumour is minutely mammillated. Ex- ternally, the transverse colon and omentum are adherent. Al. D. g. 18 (954). Malignant Disease of the Pylorus. The walls are thickened and the orifice considerably contracted. Al. D. g. 19 (956). Malignant Disease. The mucous and sub- mucous coats of the pyloric end of the stomach are greatly infiltrated and the muscular coat hypertrophied. A large mass of new growth projects into the lumen of pylorus. Al. D. g. 20 (957)- Malignant Disease. The new growth is con- siderably ulcerated, and has infiltrated the gastric wall towards the pyloric end. The muscular coat is hypertrophied. Al. D. g. 21 (958). Malignant Disease of the Pylorus. A nodular, fungating, cancerous mass surrounds the pylorus. Al. D. g. 22 (945)' Malignant Disease. A fungating, cancerous mass near the pyloric extremity of the stomach. The central portion has sloughed. Al. D. g. 23 (949a). Malignant Disease of the Pylorus. The tumour shews a large ulcerated surface, in the midst of which is a well-marked oval perforation. This part of the stomach was closely adherent to the adjacent under surface of the liver, so that there was no escape of the contents of the stomach. Presented by Professor Laycock, January 18, 1869. Al. D. g. 24 (950). Malignant Disease of the Pylorus. The new growth has extended along the upper part of the duodenum. Al. D. g. 25 (952). Malignant Disease of the Pylorus. Near the pyloric orifice are nodular projections and infiltration of the mucous membrane; above, an oval opening in the wall is seen, and, a little further off, a softer fungating growth. An opening with thickened edges, resembling a perforating gastric ulcer, is seen at the cardiac extremity of the stomach. Al. D. g. 26 (953)- Malignant Disease of the Pylorus. Scirrhous contraction and ulceration are seen at the orifice. Al. D. g. 27 (955). Malignant Disease of the Pylorus. The centre of the cancerous growth has sloughed, leaving an ulcer with thickened edges and exposing the muscular coat. Possibly a simple ulcer primarily, with development of cancer at margin. Al. D. g. 28 (947^)- Malignant Disease of Pylorus. A mass of colloid cancer removed from the pyloric end of stomach.

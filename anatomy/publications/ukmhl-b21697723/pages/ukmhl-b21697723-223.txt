INTESTINAL CONCRETIONS. 203 Al. I. a. 72. Hair Ball mesially divided. There is no appearance of any cementing substance, and on the external surface the hairs project quite freely. Al. I. a, 73. Two Hair Balls : one the form of a cone, height, 3|- inches; greatest circumference, 2| inches: the other is divided mesially, and smaller, but rounded. There is no appear- ance of any cementing substance, and the hairs in both specimens project freely on the external surface. Al. I. a. 74. A small rounded Hair Ball, covered with a smooth coat of lime salts. Al. I. a. 75. A Concretion the size of a large orange, but flattened. Externally composed of hair, with no coating of calcareous matter. Internally it is mostly made up of short pieces of straw. Al. I. a. 76. Round Concretion. Circumference, 17 inches; weight, 4 lbs. J oz. Composed almost entirely of lime salts, with the addition of a little hair and vegetable matterâ€”the latter probably the husks of oats. It has a central nucleus about the size of a pea, but of an irregular shape. From the nucleus it presents a radiating appearance, and there are no concentric rings till within about an inch of the periphery. Externally it is roughish, and when pieces are chipped off the newly-exposed surface exhibits the conchoidal fracture. Al. I. a. 77. A large Concretion 20 inches in greatest circum- ference and 2 lbs. 12 J oz. in weight, and similar in appearance and composition to Al. I. a. 42, from the intestine of a horse. Al. I. a. 78. A similar Concretion bisected. Greatest circum- ference, 18 inches ; weight, 2 lbs. 4J oz. Al. I. a. 79. Half of a Concretion spheroidal in shape, similar in appearance and structure to Al. I. a. 48 from the intestine of a horse. Specimens Illustrating Formation of Balls. Al. I. a. 80. A Ball, composed of vegetable fibre, which has become woven together in a manner illustrative of the way in which hair balls are formed, probably by the action of the wind. From the beach at Cannes, opposite the Island of Marguerite. Al. I. a. 81. Another specimen from the same locality, in which the vegetable fibre is more loosely aggregated. Al. I a. 82. Two smaller but similarly formed specimens, the vegetable fibre in which is much finer. From the shore at Alexandria (Egypt). Al. I. a. 83. Three specimens of a similar kind. Locality unknown. Al. I. a. 84. Two specimens, composed of fine vegetable fibre aggregated into compact masses. From the beach at Marfa Bay, Malta.

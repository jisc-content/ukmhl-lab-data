Section of a painful subcutaneous tumour, the size of a cherry, removed by operation. In structure it is a Fibroma, and it was loosely connected to the cellular sheath of the .posterior tibial nerve, and surrounded by a thin capsule, from which it was easily separated, d'he surface was slightly lobulated, and composed of concentric layers of dense, reddish- white laminae. Numerous fibres of a similar structure intersect its substance, which is of a flesh-red colour and of semi- cartilage-like consistence, with two small areolae of crimson colour near its centre. The patient was a man cet. 60. A tumour of two yearsâ€™ duration was indistinctly perceptible between the heads of the Gastrocnemius muscle, disappearing on flexion of the leg. For six months previous to operation there was intolerable pain on pressure of the tumour, and there were also frequent paroxysms of violent pain proceeding from the tumour and affecting the whole leg, the pain, however, being much diminished by gentle friction with the hand. Soon after the operation he died of erysipelas. T. A. a. 5. Recurrent Fibroma from neck. Presented by Pro- fessor Annandale. Lipomas. T. A. b. T. A. b. 1. Lipoma.

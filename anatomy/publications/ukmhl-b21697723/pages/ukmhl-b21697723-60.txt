40 SYPHILITIC DISEASES OF BONE. Os. D. e. 23 (219). The femur of an adult, much increased in girth throughout the entire length of the shaft. The structure of the bone, as seen in the sawn section, is much altered, the original compact tissue being rarefied, and the medullary canal encroached upon by new spongy bone. Os. D. e. 24 (216). A similar specimen. The inferior articular surface is ulcerated from disease of the knee-joint. Os. D. e. 25. A femur, presumably from a syphilitic subject, shewing several large nodular thickenings of its shaft. The surface of the different elevations is rough and uneven, and is extensively perforated by vascular foramina. (Presented by Professor Sir W. Turner.) Os. D. e. 26 (220). The femur of an adult, shewing a very charac- , teristic nodular thickening of its shaft. Os. D. e. 27 (221). The femur ot an adult, much increased in girth throughout the entire length of its shaft. The sawn surface shews considerable sclerosis, without encroaching, however, on the medullary canal. Os. D. e. 28 (218). A similar specimen. The bone is very bulky and heavy. Os. D. e. 29 (223). A similar specimen. Os. D. e. 30 (226). A femur, increased in girth throughout and of roughened surface. The new bone formed externally by the periosteum is condensed like ordinary compact tissue, while the original compact tissue of the shaft is being slowly rarefied into spongy bone. Os. D. e. 31 (229). A vertical section of a portion of the shaft of a femur, shewing externally a crust of porous bone laid down by the periosteum, and internally an encroachment on the medullary canal by the sclerosed cancellated tissue of the shaft. Os. D. e. 32 (234). A femur, in which the lower end of the shaft is increased in girth, and is covered externally by a crust of new bone. Os. D. e. 33 (217)- A femur, in which the lower two-thirds of the shaft are similarly altered. Os. D. e. 34 (250). A Tibia, shewing characteristic nodular thicken- ing of the shaft. Os. D. e. 35 (Y 29). A tibia, unearthed during the restoration of St Gilesâ€™Cathedral in 1879. It shews a diffuse encrustation of bone over the entire shaft. Os. D. e. 36 (247)- A tibia and Fibula, in which the shafts are partly covered with a thin spongy crust of new bone.

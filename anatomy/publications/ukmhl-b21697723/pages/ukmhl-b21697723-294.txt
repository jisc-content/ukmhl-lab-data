276 urethra. Gen.-U. D. d. 7 (1403). Stricture of Urethra. A stricture situated about three inches from the urethral orifice. The prostate is enlarged, and the bladder contracted and somewhat hypertrophied. Gen.-U. D. d. 8 (1404). Stricture of Urethra. The stricture is situated at the bulb. It is complicated by several false passages produced by catheterisation. The urethra behind the stricture is dilated. The specimen also shews dilatation, hypertrophy, sacculation and fasciculation of the bladder, and dilatation of both ureters. Gen.-U. D. d. 9 (1406). Stricture of Urethra. The stricture is situated in the bulbous portion of the urethra. Gen.-U. D. d. 10 (V. 15). Stricture of Urethra. Several bands of fibrous tissue stretch across the canal at the junction of the membranous and prostatic urethra, forming the so-called “ Bridle Stricture.” The urethra has given way, or has been perforated by instruments in front of the stricture. Gen.-U. D. d. 11 (1332). Bladder and upper part of Urethra laid open. The bladder has been punctured from the rectum, to relieve retention of urine. The urethral stricture has been laid open, and pieces of whalebone introduced into the dilated part of the channel immediately behind it. (See also specimens Gen.-U. B. c. 12.) PENIS AND SCROTUM.

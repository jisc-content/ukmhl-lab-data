The obstruction at the ileo-c^cal orifice has pro- duced dilatation of the ileum and diminution in the calibre of the colon. Al. E. 1. 12 (969). Malignant Disease of the Large Intestine. The caput caecum coli is much contracted, and its walls in- filtrated by new growth. A small cyst adheres to it. Al. E. 1. 13 (970). Malignant Stricture of the Large Intestine. The stricture, half an inch long, is situated in the splenic flexure of the colon. Dilatation and ulceration of the gut is seen above the obstruction ; below, it is contracted. Al. E. 1. 14 (971)- Malignant Stricture of the Large Intestine. The cancerous mass occupies the walls of the colon to the extent of an inch. Above it the gut is dilated. Al. E. 1. 15 (972). Malignant Stricture of the Large Intestine. Ulceration of the new growth and perforation have occurred at the point of stricture. Al. E. 1. 16 (973)- Malignant Stricture of the Large Intestine. Ulceration of the new growth and perforation have occurred at the point of stricture. Al. E. 1. 17 (974). Malignant Stricture of the Large Intestine. The gut is contracted below the point of obstruction. Al. E. 1. 18 (975)- Malignant Stricture of the Large Intestine. Ulceration of the new growth and perforation have occurred at the point of stricture. Al. E. 1. 19 (976). Malignant Stricture of the Large Intestine. The walls of a section of the colon are infiltrated with new growth and contracted. Al. E. I. 20 (977). Malignant Stricture of the Large Intestine.

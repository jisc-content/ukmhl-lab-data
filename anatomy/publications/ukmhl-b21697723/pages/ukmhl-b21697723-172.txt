152 CIRCULATORY SYSTEM. Cir. Gr. d. 19 (2191). Saccular aneurism of first part of arch of aorta penetrating the manubrium sterni, and bulging on its anterior surface. Dried preparation. Presented by Professor Syme. Cir. G. d. 20 (2184). Aneurism of arch of aorta, just before the origin of the innominate artery, perforating the upper part of the right chest, forming a large sac behind the manubrium sterni, causing absorption of first and second ribs to the right of sternum. Cir. G. d. 21 (2186). Large aneurism of arch of aorta, the sac to a large extent filled with a mass of laminated fibrin; dilatation of right innominate artery and small aneurism on right sub- clavian ; obliteration of right innominate vein, and contraction of vena cava superior; posteriorly it presses on the oesophagus and left bronchus; right vagus nerve enlarged. Cir. G. d. 22 (2218). Sacculated aneurism of arch of the aorta, involving the innominate artery, and bursting into the trachea. The first part of the aorta is greatly dilated. Cir. G. d. 23 (2189). Large aneurism of arch of aorta, involving the innominate artery; the manubrium sterni and sternal ex- tremities of both clavicles are enclosed in the sac, and the greater part of their substance has been absorbed. Presented by Professor Syme. Cir. G. d. 24. Dried preparation. Aneurism of arch of aorta, involving the innominate artery, bulging against and eroding the sternum, and pushing the trachea over to the left side. Cir. G. d. 25 (2204). Dilatation and atheroma of first part of arch of aorta, and large aneurism of arch, passing in front of innominate artery and eroding the sternum. Presented by Pro- fessor Syme. Cir. G. d. 26 (2198). Aneurism of arch of aorta, involving origin of innominate artery; the sac is filled with clot. The aorta has been opened from behind. Cir. G. d. 27 (2190). Large aneurism of arch of aorta, near the innominate artery, projecting between the ribs and into the left lung, and compressing the descending aorta. Laminated thrombus well shewn. Cir. G. d. 28 (2206). Small aneurism of arch of aorta, cut to shew laminated clot. Injected specimen. Cir. G. d. 29 (2207). Opposite section of the previous specimen. Cir. G. d. 30 (2192). Aneurism of arch of aorta, which extended above the sternum to the region of the thyroid gland. The aneurism had burst externally through a slough in the skin. Cir. G. d. 31 (2193). Dilatation of ascending aorta, and saccular aneurism of summit of arch. Left innominate vein obliterated.

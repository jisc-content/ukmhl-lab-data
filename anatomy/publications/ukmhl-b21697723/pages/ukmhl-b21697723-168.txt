CIRCULATORY SYSTEM. Cir. F. f. 2 (2092). Acute endocarditis, with vegetations on the tricuspid, mitral, and aortic valves ; extreme stenosis and chronic endocarditis with fibrous thickening of the mitral valve. Hyper- trophy of the ventricles, especially of the right. Cir. P. f. 3 (2114). Chronic endocarditis of tricuspid and mitral valves; slight atheroma of aorta. Cir. F. f. 4. Stenosis of tricuspid, mitral, and aortic valves. Heart laid open to shew the condition. Tricuspid orifice extremely narrowed, orifice of oval shape, with smooth edges. Mitral orifice extremely narrowed, scarcely admitting tip of finger. No sign of recent endocarditis of mitral or tricuspid. Aortic orifice almost completely occluded by a mass of vegetations from recent endocarditis. Dilatation of auricles. No sign of hypertrophy of ventricles. The pulmonary valve has been cut away. Cir. F. f. 5 (2101). Stenosis of tricuspid, mitral, and aortic valves; chronic endocarditis. Cir. P. f. 6 (2098). Chronic endocarditis and calcification with adhesions, causing stenosis of mitral and aortic valves; slight chronic thickening of pulmonary valve; partial adhesion of two of its segments. Presented by Professor Alison. Cir. F. f. 7 (2091). Ulcerative endocarditis of pulmonary valve; segments almost eaten away. DISEASES OP ARTERIES. Cir. G. Acute Endarteritis. Cir. G. a.

G. b. 2 (2146). Dried preparation of the aorta, shewing extreme atheroma, with calcareous plates and dilatation of first and second parts of arch. Cir. G. b. 3 (2138). Extensive atheroma and fusiform dilatation of entire arch of aorta. Cir. G. b. 4 (2140). Very slight atheroma of the aorta. Cir. G. b. 5 (2148). Commencement of aorta, shewing extreme atheroma with calcareous plates. Cir. G. b. 6 (2141). Extreme atheroma with calcareous plates and irregular dilatation of arch of aorta; erosion near aortic valve.

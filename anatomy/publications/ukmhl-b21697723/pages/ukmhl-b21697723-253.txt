PLEURA. 233 It has also grown downwards into the trachea. The lobes of the thyroid gland are affected, and a similar mass lies in front of the larynx. One year before death laryngotomy was performed. Secondary growths were found in the lower lobe of the left lung. R. A. i. 2 (2296). Larynx and Pharynx, shewing an extensive and probably malignant growth from the posterior wall of the larynx into the canal of the pharynx. This growth has thickened the Aryteno-epiglottic folds so that the superior opening of the larynx is almost occluded. A probe is passed through an aper- ture of communication between the pharynx and larynx. R. A. i. 3 (2298). Larynx displaying a widely-spread, fungating Epithelioma, which involved the epiglottis and surrounding parts. The left vocal cord is also affected; the right is intact. R. A. i. 4. Larynx, in which the left vocal cord is thickened and ulcerated, and there are two other patches of new growth, pro- bably malignant, lower down. One of these has, by ulceration, exposed several of the tracheal rings. PLEURA. R. B. Injuries to Pleura, R. B. a. R. B. a. 1 (2315a). Rupture of Pleura pulmonalis and Lung, with circumscribed extravasation of blood. Patient fell from a height of 20 feet; for kidney of same case, see 1201. Pleurisy, Empyema and Sequels of. R. B. b. R. B. b. 1 (2317). Recent Acute Pleurisy in a pig, with exudation followed by adhesion within forty hours after the thorax had been opened into. R. B. b. 2 (2333). Small pieces of Lung shewing acute Pleurisy with lymph exudation; a few scattered patches of softening, possibly secondary abscesses in the lung substance, one of which has apparently perforated the Pleura. R. B. b. 3 (2344). Portion of Lung shewing thickening of Pleura and deposition of lymph on its posterior aspect and on the root of left Lung. The left vagus nerve is much thickened. R. B. b. 4 (2347a). Portion of a Pleural Membrane shewing the effects of recent inflammation. R. B. b. 5 (2348). Portion of Lung shewing great inflammatory thickening of both the costal and pulmonary pleurae, which are partially adherent to each other. The pulmonary substance is leathery and condensed.

232 DISEASES OF LARYNX. R. A. f. 8 (2299). Syphilitic ulceration of Larynx immediately below the vocal cords, extending to Arytenoid and Cricoid car- tilages, which have necrosed from suppurative Perichondritis. The Epiglottis is thickened. Tube^^cLe. R. A. g. R. A. g. 1 (2310«). Larynx, shewing extensive tubercular thick- ening and ulceration of the whole of its mucous membrane, extending into the trachea. The Epiglottis is partially destroyed, and there are several sinuses. R. A. g. 2 (2310). The Epiglottis and Aryteno-epiglottic folds are much thickened and ulcerated. The mucous membrane of the interior of the Larynx is inflamed, and shews patches of false membrane. The right tonsil is extensively ulcerated. R. A. g. 3 (2285). Tubercle of Glands. Preparation exhibiting enlarged Thymus and Bronchial glands, which caused the death of the patient—a child—by pressure on the Trachea and the beginning of the Bronchi. The lungs were tubercular. Tumours. R. A. h. R. A. h. 1 (2313). A Papilloma, half the size of a cherry, attached to the anterior surface of the left Arytenoid cartilage. Death resulted from obstruction, produced by the growth and by the supervention of CEdema Glottidis. R. A. h. 2 (2312). Larynx dissected to shew a flattened fleshy Tumour, the size of a small chestnut, situated in front of the left Arytenoid cartilage; it projects into the Larynx. R. A. h. 3 (2311 a). Larynx, in which small nodular Tumours pro- ject into the lumen just above the vocal cords, which are slightly ulcerated. Presented by Professor Hughes Bennett. R. A. h. 4 (2311). A Tumour the size of a filbert, projecting from the back part of the Cricoid cartilage into the cavity of the Pharynx. Presented by Professor Syme. R. A. h. 5 (2292 a). Larynx laid open to shew a Tumour, the size of a marble, which is growing into the ventricle close to the attachment of the right vocal cord to the Arytenoid cartilage. Tracheotomy had been performed, and the tracheal mucous membrane is ulcerated from pressure of the tube. Presented by Professor Hughes Bennett. Malignant Disease. R. A. i. R. A. i. 1. An extensive, irregularly ulcerated new growth in the cavity of the Larynx, extending upwards through the superior aperture to the base of the tongue and involving the epiglottis.

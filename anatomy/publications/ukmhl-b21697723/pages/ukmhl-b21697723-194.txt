174 ALIMENTARY SYSTEM. DISEASES OF INTESTINAL CANAL. Al. E. Intussusception, Al. E. a. Al. E. a. 1 (794flt). Invaginations in the small intestine of a pig, produced mechanically after death. Prepared by Mr John Arthur. Al. E. a. 2 (667). Coil of small intestine from a dog, in which artificial intussusception was produced, and recovery, with sloughing and separation of a portion of the bowel, ensued. The arteries have been injected, and a window cut in the walls of the bowel, to shew a circular, valve-like, constricting band which has been formed at the site of separation. The gut is dilated above the obstruction. Presented by George Trusted, Esq. Al. E. a. 3 (796). Intussusception of Jejunum. The invaginated portion is about an inch and a half long. Al. E. a. 4 (797)- Intussusception. A similar preparation from a child. Al. E. a. 5 (798). Intussusception. Portion of small intestine, shew- ing an intussusception about two inches in length. Al. E . a. 6 (793)- Intussusception. A portion of ileum two inches long is invaginated into the succeeding portion. Al. E. a. 7 (802). Intussusception. A coil of small intestine, with mesentery attached, passed by a patient per anum. The gut, which is much thinned and dilated, shews signs of gangrene and putrefaction. Al. E. a. 8 (802a). Intussusception. This specimen illustrates a similar condition. Dried preparation. Al. E. a. 9. Intussusception. Piece of small intestine passed per anu7n by a woman 56 years of age, a fortnight after the first symptoms of intestinal obstruction. She lived for six months afterwards, and ultimately died of inanition. The piece of bowel, when evacuated, was gangrenous, and of highly offensive odour. Patient under the care of Dr Yelf, of Moreton-in-the- Marsh. Presented by Professor Greenfield. Al. E. a. 10 (8026). Intussusception. Preparation shewing the condition of bowel after recovery by sloughing of the intussus- ception. The portion of the gut which contained the latter is much dilated, and at its upper end joins the uninvolved bowel, which is of normal calibre, but somewhat twisted on its longi- tudinal axis.

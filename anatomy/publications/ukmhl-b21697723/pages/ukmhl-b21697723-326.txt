URINARY CALCULI. 3o8 phosphate of lime and urate of magnesia. When extracted, there were no depressions on the outer surface of this Calculus, but their places were occupied by spines. The tops of these spines were broken off, and then the cavities with the contained crystals were found beneath. These were examined by Sir David Brewster in his optical researches. From the Bell Collection. Presented by Dr G. Bell. Gen.-U. S. b. 51. A large, flattened, laminated Calculus, slightly roughened on outer surface. Weight, 1331 grains. Uric acid, with a little urate of ammonia. A spare deposit of phosphate of lime on parts of exterior. From the Bell Collection. Presented by Dr G. Bell. Gen.-U. S. b. 52. Laminated Calculus of a triangular shape and rough exterior. Weight, 483 grains. Uric acid, urate of ammonia, and urate of lime, with a trace of phosphate of lime. From the Bell Collection. Presented by Dr G. Bell. Gen.-U. S. b. 53. Flattened four-sided Calculus of a dark brown colour and highly polished inner surface. Weight, 307 grains. Uric acid, with small traces of urates of ammonia, and lime and phosphate of lime. Gen.-U. S. b. 54. Section of a flattened Calculus, laminated; smooth exterior. Nucleus, uric acid; cortex, urate ammonia. Gen.-U. S. b. 55. Section of a triangular laminated Calculus; exterior nearly smooth. Nucleus, uric acid; cortex, urate ammonia. Gen.-U. S. b. 56. Flattened laminated Calculus, with a smooth exterior. Weight, 267 grains. Nucleus, uric acid; cortex, urate ammonia. Nucleus of Uric Acid or Urate of Ammonia external to which earthy phosphates are deposited. Gen.-U. S. c. Gen.-U. S. C. 1. Large irregularly ovoidal Calculus. 2ยง inches in length; i|- inch in breadth; 7J inches in circumference. Nucleus, uric acid, with urates of ammonia and lime. A deep fissure passes across the nucleus towards one of its surfaces. On the sides of the fissure is a beautiful crystalline phosphatic deposit. Fusible phosphate, which contains an excess of the phosphate of lime and traces of the carbonates of lime and magnesia, invests the nucleus. Presented by Professor Miller. Gen.-U. S. C. 2. Nine Calculi; smooth on their outer surfaces, of a white colour, and irregular, angular form. They vary much in size. Nucleus, uric acid and urate of ammonia.

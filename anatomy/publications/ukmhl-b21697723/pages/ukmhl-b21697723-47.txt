27 GUNSHOT INJURIES. shaft, the edges of which are rounded or rolled, while at the bottom there is a sequestrum of the compact shell, which was probably carried inwards by the ball. On the posterior aspect of the shaft there are the orifices of two sinuses which lead into the cavity already referred to. The periosteum throughout the shaft has been very active in forming new bone. Os. B. f. 73 (A 78). The upper two-thirds of the tibia of a man aged 23; a musket-ball struck the inner or subcutaneous sur- face of the shaft about 7*5 cm. below the tuberosity, and buried itself deeply in the substance of the bone, and detaching a large splinter from the posterior aspect. A cavity is now seen where the ball lodged, containing one or more dead portions of bone. Os. B. f. 74 (B 17). “A vertical section of a portion of tibia which was fractured by a musket-ball at the battle of Waterloo. Some traces of lead are to be seen incorporated with the bony matter. These are much more conspicuous in the other half of this preparation, which is in Dr Duncan’s possession. Presented by Dr James Duncan, Edinburgh.” The bone is much increased in girth, and markedly sclerosed in the region of the fracture. Os. B. f. 75 (A 79)- The tibia and fibula of a man aged 29, ampu- tated on the thirty-:fifth day after receipt of a gunshot wound of the leg. T'he tibia presents about its middle a very comminuted and complicated fracture. Suppurative periostitis and osteo- myelitis has supervened, and has caused the death of several of the fragments and of a large portion of the shaft of the bone above and below the fracture. A very imperfect case of new bone has been formed. The shaft of the fibula is thinly crusted with recent bone. Os. B. f. 76 (A 50). Upper and middle parts of the tibia and fibula. The tibia was very much shattered by a ball passing through it from behind. The fibula was fractured transversely at its upper third.

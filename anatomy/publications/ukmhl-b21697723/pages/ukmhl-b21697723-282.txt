Section shewing small, scattered, sooty-black secondary nodules in and under capsule and in the substance of the organ. From a man, aged 51, whose eyeball—the seat of the primary growth —had been extirpated for melanotic sarcoma several months previously. Similar secondary nodules were present in the muscles, bones, pleurae, lungs, liver (see Al. K. o. i (1080), heart and other organs. (See Edin. Med. Chir. Trans., vol. i., p. 204.) Gen.-U. A. W. iii. 2 (1295). Malignant Tumour, which has invaded the lower part of the kidney. The growth shews irregular nodulation, and the cut surface exhibits numerous areas of necrosis and haemorrhage. Malignant infiltration of the kidney substance is occurring at the margin of the growth, and the renal vein has become blocked, and contains a partially organised and adherent thrombus. The thrombosis has also spread into the inferior vena cava and common iliac veins. Gen.-U. A. W. iii. 3 (1290). Sarcoma (?) of Kidney. Left organ from a patient, aged 64, shewing a large, irregularly rounded tumour situated in the outer part of the organ, where it has infiltrated and replaced the entire thickness of the kidney substance. It has also invaded the pelvis of the organ, and two smaller masses are seen between the infundibula. The surface of the tumour is irregularly nodulated, and several smaller nodules are also seen on the surface of the kidney, as are also some small collapsed cysts. Large irregular areas of softening and haemorrhage are seen on the cut surface of the tumour, which exhibits “ an irregular medullary ” arrangement.

3i6 URINARY CALCULI. this, successive layers of oxalate of lime; a thick deposit of uric acid, with a little urate of ammonia, and fusible phosphates, with a mere trace of the carbonate. The phosphate is princi- pally at the end of the Calculus. Specific gravity, i-68. Described and figured by Professor Alexander Monro, iertius^ Outlines of Anatomy^ Vol. III., Appendix, p. 504. Plate xxxviii., A. Q. D. d. 40 Old Catalogue. Gen.-U. S. g. 2. Roundish compressed Calculus. Weight, 890 grains. Nucleus, uric acid, with deposit of oxalate of lime; a second layer of uric acid, thicker at the ends of the Calculus than at the surface; and a layer of the earthy phosphates. Gen.-U. S. g. 3. Large irregular Calculus, much broken on the surface. Nucleus, uric acid, invested by a thin layer of oxalate of lime ; a thick deposit of uric acid, with a little urate of ammonia; and fusible phosphate, mixed with a little carbonate of lime. Gen.-U. S. g. 4. Oblong, imperfectly laminated Calculus, with a white and somewhat rough exterior. Weight, 645 grains. Nucleus, small, uric acid, is a thin layer of oxalate of lime, upon which, invested by a thick deposit of uric acid, mixed with urates of lime and magnesia; and, externally, a thin layer of the fusible phosphates. Urate of Ammonia. Gen.-U. S. h. Gen.-U. S. h. 1. Half of a small oval Calculus; structure laminated and very compact; outer surface smooth. Gen.-U. S. h. 2. Section of a small oval Calculus ; very compact and laminated ; outer surface has been evidently at one time smooth, but fragments have been broken off. Gen.-U. S. h. 3. A small, oval, compact laminated Calculus; outer surface smooth. The nucleus is much darker in its colour than the cortex, but they both consist of urate of ammonia. Nucleus, Oxalate of Lime, Earthy Phosphates externally. Gen.-U. S. i. Gen.-U. S. i. 1. Portions of two Calculi, only one of which was examined. Nucleus, oxalate of lime, phosphate and a little carbonate of lime on the surface.

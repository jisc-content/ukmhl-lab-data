PELVIS OF KIDNEY AND URETER. 2/0 Inflammatory Changes. Gen.-U. B. d. (See also under Gen.-U. A. n., and specimen Gen.-U. 1>. g. 5.) Tuberculosis. Gen.-U. B. e. [No specimens.] Tumours. Gen.-U. B. f. [No specimens.] Calculi. Gen.-U. B. g. Gen.-U. B. g. 1 (1232). Renal Calculi. Dark brown calculus occupying the pelvis and causing dilatation of the calyces, one of which also contains a calculus; the two calculi shew well- marked facets where their surfaces have been in contact with one another. Presented by Dr Graham. Gen.-U. B. g. 2 (1321). Renal Calculus, in situ, occupying and forming a cast of the pelvis and calyces—the so-called “coral- line calculus,” causing marked atrophy of the organ. From the dissecting room. Described by J. A. Russell, M.B., Jour. Anat. and Physiol, vol. viii., p. 382. Presented by Professor Sir William Turner. Gen.-U. B. g. 3 {1320). Renal Calculus. Dried specimen shewing a calculus filling up and forming a cast of the pelvis and infundibula. The so-called “coralline calculus.” Gen.-U. B. g. 4 (1211). Renal Calculus. Extreme atrophy of the kidney following upon complete blocking of the lower end of the ureter by an impacted calculus, which may be seen just above the entrance of the duct into the bladder. The upper part of the ureter is somewhat dilated, and the surface of the atrophied kidney is studded over with minute cysts. Part of the aorta and the atrophied renal arteries are retained in position. Gen.-U. B. g. 5 (1238). Renal Calculi. Large irregular brownish calculus, together with several smaller calculi embedded in the dilated pelvis and calyces, which shew a condition of pyelitis, and are lined by exudation. The organ is much enlarged. The capsule is much thickened and has become firmly adherent to the surrounding structures, e.g.., right lobe of liver, hepatic flexure of colon, etc., apparently from the presence of a per- inephric abscess, which has opened into the transverse colon. Gen.-U. B. g. 6 (A. b. 59). A large Calculus which, from its shape, appears to have been formed in the pelvis of the kidney. No history or description is attached to it. Nucleus, urate ammonia; cortex, uric acid.

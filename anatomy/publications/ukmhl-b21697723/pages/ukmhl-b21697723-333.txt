315 URINARY CALCULI. Gen.-U. S. f. 3. A peculiarly formed Calculus, consisting of two portions joined at right angles. One part has for its nucleus, uric acid, surrounded by a thick layer of oxalate of lime, upon which is a thin covering of fusible phosphate. The other part is composed almost entirely of fusible phosphate, with traces of carbonate of lime and urates of ammonia and lime. Gen.-U. S. f. 4. Section of an elongated oval Calculus. Nucleus, uric acid, with traces of urate of ammonia, lime, and magnesia, invested by a thin layer of oxalate of lime. Fusible phosphates form bulk of Calculus. Q. D. d. 451 Old Catalogue. Gen.-U. S. f. 5. Flattened oval Calculus, imperfectly laminated; roughish and white externally. Weight, 205 grains. Uric acid, with trace of urate of lime, oxalate of lime, phosphate of lime. Gen.-U. S. f. 6. Section of a Calculus, rough and mulberry-like on its outer surface. Nucleus, urate of ammonia, on which layers of oxalate of lime and urate of ammonia are alternately deposited. A thin coat of phosphate of lime, with a little carbonate on surface. Gen.-U. S. f. 7. Small mulberry-shaped Calculus, having numerous small glistening crystals deposited on the exterior. Weight, 164 grains. Nucleus, urate of ammonia; upon this, oxalate of lime. Surface, phosphate of lime. Gen.-U. S. f. 8. Fragments of Calculi. Only one has been examined. Nucleus, urate of ammonia, on which is a thin layer of oxalate of lime. The outer part of the Calculus is composed of phosphate of lime, with the urates of potash and soda. Gen.-U. S. f. 9. Calculus, the outer layers of which are broken into numerous fragments. Nucleus, urate of amm.onia, in- vested by oxalate of lime. Calculus, mainly phosphate of lime, with traces of carbonate of magnesia. Gen.-U. S. f. 10. Small and somewhat irregular Calculus. Nucleus, urate of ammonia, covered by a layer of oxalate of lime. Exterior, phosphate of lime. Nuclei of Uric Acid, or Urate of Ammonia, on which alter7iating layers of Urates, Oxalates, or Phosphates are deposited, Gen.-U. S. g. Gen.-U. S. g. 1. Two sections of a large Calculus, which weighed 32 ounces; surface irregular, shape oval; 5-7 inches in length, 3-6 in breadth, 3-4 in thickness. Nucleus, uric acid ; around X

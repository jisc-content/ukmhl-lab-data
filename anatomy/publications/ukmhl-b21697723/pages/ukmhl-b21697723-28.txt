8 FRACTURES OF THE UPPER EXTREMITY. Os. B. d. 34 (67). The bones of the forearm completely anchylosed or fused together in their upper third, as a result of fracture of the radius. Os. B. d. 35 (68). Anchylosis of the bones of the forearm in their upper third (the radius being supinated), following on multiple fracture of both bones. Os. B. d. 36 (69). A Codes’ fracture of the lower end of the radius. United, in the deformed position. The lower fragment is dis- placed backwards and upwards to an unusual extent. Os. B. d. 37 (70)* ^ Codes’ fracture of the lower end of the radius. In the process of repair new bone has been formed, involving the sheaths of the tendons both on the dorsal and palmar aspects of the bone. Os. B. d. 38 (71). A Codes’ fracture of the lower end of the radius. United,* with the lower fragment displaced backwards and up- wards, and rotated, so that the articular surface for the carpus faces the dorsum. Os. B. d. 39 (73). A fracture of the radius and ulna of a dog through the middle of their shafts. Partially united. Os. B. d. 40 (74)* A longitudinal section of a fractured radius, shewing union, with angular deformity and partial overriding of the fragments. The medullary canal is nearly completely re- produced. Os. B. d. 41 (75). A fracture of the ulna in its lower third. United. Os. B. d. 42 (76). A longitudinal section of a fracture of the left radius, in which a considerable amount of external, periosteal, or ensheathing callus still remains. Os. B. d. 43 (77). A fracture of the shaft of the radius at the junction of its middle and upper thirds. United. Os. B. d. 44 (Y 201). The bones of the forearm and hand, from a case of Colies’ fracture of the radius, in which union has taken place, with the lower fragment impacted and displaced in the usual manner. (Presented by Prof. Sir W. Turner.) Os. B. d. 45 (78). A Codes’ fracture of the lower end of the radius. United, with the usual displacement of the lower fragment. Os. B. d. 46 (79). A longitudinal section of an old fracture of the. shaft of the radius, in which the fragments have become united at an angle. Os. B. d. 47 (80). A longitudinal section of an old fracture of the shaft of the radius. Os. B. d. 48 (81). A longitudinal section of an old fracture of the shaft of the ulna. United, with partial overriding of the fragments.

3 FRACTURES OF THE SKULL. Os. B. a. 13 (12). A portion of the frontal bone shewing a cir- cumscribed depressed fracture from gunshot injury. Repair has taken place with the depressed portion of bone projecting on the cerebral surface. Os. B. a. 14 (13). A portion of the frontal bone which had been driven into the brain by the kick of a horse and was removed by operation. The fragment is about 8 cm. in length and 5 cm. in breadth. Os. B. a. 15(14). Fragments from a depressed fracture of the frontal bone which were removed by trephining. Os. B. a. 16(15). Similar fragments from a fracture over the coronal suture. Os. B. a. 17 (16). A number of fragments of the frontal and facial bones removed by operation for gunshot injury. Os. B. a. 18 (17). A leaden bullet which was found in the interior of the skull, and which is curiously altered in shape. Os. B. a. 19 (18). Two fragments of the parietal bone, removed â€˜ by the trephine in a case of depressed fracture in a boy of 16. The patient died. Os. B. a. 20 (19). Similar fragments of bone. Os. B. a. 21 (20). Similar fragments, along with pieces of wood. Os. B. a. 22 (21). Similar fragments of bone. Os. B. a. 23 (24). A specimen shewing extensive multiple linear fractures of the vertex of the skull, with displacement of bones and haemorrhage, followed by rapid death. Os. B. a. 24 (25). The skull-cap of a boy trephined for a fracture of the frontal bone. The fractured portions of bone have been removed by the operation. Os. B. a. 25 (26). A skull in which there is an old fracture of the nasal and left superior maxillary bones, partly united, with deformity from depression of the fractured portions. Os. B. a. 26 (27). The base of a skull in which a portion of the occiput, which had been detached by a sabre cut, was replaced, and is completely reunited by bone. There is further a bony outgrowth (exostosis ?) from the right malar bone bridging over the infraorbital foramen. Os. B. a. 27(1). A calvarium presenting a very large, irregularly rounded gap in the left half of the os frontis, occupied by a fibrous membrane. The gap probably results from a compound fracture, judging by the evidence of absorptive changes in the surrounding bone, both on the outer and inner surfaces, and by a very distinct fissure which runs from the outer margin of the gap into the temporal bone of the right side.

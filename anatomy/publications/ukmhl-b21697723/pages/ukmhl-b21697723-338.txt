320 URINARY CALCULI. Gen.-U. S. n. 15. Two fragments of a Calculus; hard and crystalline in their structure. Fusible phosphates, with a mere trace of oxalate. Gen.-U. S. n. 16. Three nipple-shaped Calculi passed. Fusible phosphates, with trace of carbonate of lime. Q. D. d. 39 Old Catalogue. Gen.-U. S. n. 17. Calculus of the form of a parallelopiped, marked by canulae. The bladder was punctured above the symphysis pubis for retention of urine, and canulse retained for six years. It consists of the fusible phosphates, with small quantities of uric acid and urate of ammonia, and a minute trace of the carbonate of lime. Q. D. d. 43 Old Catalogue. Gen.-U. S. n. 18. A single Calculus and portions of another. The fragments only examined, consisting chiefly of the phosphate of lime, with a little carbonate of magnesia and urate of ammonia. Gen.-U. S. n. 19. An elongated imperfectly laminated Calculus, of a cream-white colour and crystalline aspect externally. Weight, 424 grains. Fusible phosphates. Gen.-U. S. n. 20. Spheroidal Calculus, with a smooth brown outer surface, having white crystals scattered over it. The cut surface, indefinitely laminated, exhibits a radiating crystal- line structure. Weight, 270 grains. Fusible phosphates, with traces of carbonate and oxalate of lime. Nucleus consisting of some Foreign Body. Gen.-U. S. o. Gen.-U. S. O. 1. Large ovoid Calculus. Weight, 787 grains. Nucleus, a cylindrical piece of boxwood, an inch in length, scooped out at one end, possibly a porte canstique. The ends are grooved externally, as if thread had been wound round them. The nucleus is centric. The Calculus consists essentially of the phosphate of lime and triple phosphate, an appreciable quantity of urate of lime, and traces of oxalate and carbonate of lime, uric acid in small quantity, and a trace of urate of ammonia. These substances are deposited in well-marked concentric layers around the nucleus. Gen.-U. S. o. 2. Numerous soft, white, friable fragments of a Calculus deposited around portions of a bougie, removed from the bladder. Fusible Calculus, with a trace of urate of ammonia, lime, and magnesia.

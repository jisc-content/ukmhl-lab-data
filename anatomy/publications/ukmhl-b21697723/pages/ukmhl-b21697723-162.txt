C. a. 3 (2071)- Rupture of left Ventricle, chronic endocarditis and calcification of aortic and mitral valves; extreme atheroma of aorta. Cir. C. a. 4 (2074)- Rupture of right Ventricle near apex; heart of hare. Presented by Mr A. B. Stirling. Cir. C. a. 5 (2073). Abscess in Ventricular Septum (? traumatic), opening into left ventricle; pericardium adherent. Diseases of the Coronary Arteries of the Heart. Cir. C. b. Cir. C. b. 1 (2084). Heart enlarged; slight hypertrophy of left ventricle; atheroma of aorta and coronary arteries; coronary arteries dissected out. Death sudden. Cir. C. b. 2. Heart with Coronary Arteries dissected out to shew atheroma and (?) thrombosis. Presented by Dr W. H. Barrett. Cir. C. b. 3 (2134). Rupture of Coronary Artery. Part of the wall of left ventricle shewing rupture of one of the coronary arteries. Cir. C. b. 4 (2135). Rupture of Coronary Artery. Similar to Cir. C. b. 3. Chronic Interstitial Myocarditis.^ with Partial Dilata- tion or Aneurism of the Heart. Cir. C. c. Cir. C. C. 1 (2132). Chronic Interstitial Myocarditis. Extensive fibroid degeneration of heart wall, especially towards the apex of the left ventricle, with commencing dilatation and coagulation at apex. Cir. G. C. 2 (2123). Fibroid Degeneration and Calcification of the muscular wall of the left ventricle, with commencing aneurismal dilatation. Cir. C. c. 3. Aneurism of Heart. Aneurism of anterior wall at apex of left ventricle. A large part of heart wall in this position shews extensive fibrous degeneration. Part at the apex is covered by a clot. The aneurism ruptured into the pericardium by a small orifice, into which a quill is inserted. Presented by Pro- fessor Sir William Turner. Cir. C. C. 4 (2124).

186 ALIMENTARY SYSTEM. Al. E. h. 13 (871)- Dysentery. Several blood clots of the shape of the large intestine, evacuated in a case of dysentery. Al. E. h. 14 (872Â«). Intestinal Ulceration (? Dysenteric). The mucous membrane of the large intestine appears to have almost entirely exfoliated. A considerable area is covered with patches of exudation (? necrosed mucous membrane), and the coats of the bowel are thickened. Injected specimen. Tubercular Ulceration. Al. E. j. Al. E. j. 1 (838). Intestinal Ulceration, probably tubercular. Several oval transverse ulcers are seen, in two of which the mus- cular coat is exposed. Al. E. j. 2 (839). Tubercular Ulceration. In the largest of the ulcers, which are all transverse, the subserous tissue is exposed at one point. Injected specimen. Al. E. j. 3 (849). Tubercular Ulceration. Extensive ulceration and cicatrisation of mucous membrane of caput caecum coli. From a woman who died of phthisis, and was free from diarrhoea for a year previous to death. Al. E. j. 4 (853). Tubercular Ulceration. The mucous membrane of the caput caecum coli and ascending colon is generally inflamed and ulcerated. The ileo-caecal valve is also affected. A portion of the jejunum, shewing a large quadrilateral ulcer with ragged edges, is appended. Injected specimen. Al. E. j. 5 (854a). Tubercular Ulceration. Small transverse ulcers are seen in the ileum, three inches above the ileo- caecal valve, and in the caecum. The mucous membrane of the valve itself, and of the ileum two inches above it, shews irregular ulceration and great thickening. Small caseous nodules are seen in the subserous tissue. The proximal end of the appendix vermiformis is considerably dilated. Al. E.j. 6 (861). Tubercular Ulceration of Large Intestine. Irregular transverse ulcers, with thickened edges, appear on the mucous membrane of the colon. Injected specimen. Al. E. j. 7 (865). Tubercular Ulceration. Diffuse, irregular thickening and ulceration of the mucous membrane of the large intestine. The glandular orifices are dilated, and minute caseous tubercles are seen in the subserous tissue. Presented by Professor Henderson. Al. E. j. 8 (869). Tubercular Ulceration. There is a very large ulcer of the mucous membrane of the sigmoid flexure, with thickened edges. Beneath the peritoneum tubercular granula- tions are seen corresponding with the floor of the ulcer.

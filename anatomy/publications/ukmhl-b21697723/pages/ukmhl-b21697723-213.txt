193 PERITONEUM. Tuberculosis of Peritoneum—“ Tttbercular Peritonitis T Al F. b. Al. F. b. 1 (888). Tubercular Peritonitis. The omentum shews a plentiful deposit of caseous tubercle, and is somewhat thickened and retracted. Tubercles are also seen in the subserous coat of the transverse colon. Al. F. b. 2 (2601). Tubercular Peritonitis. Section of the trans- verse colon and omentum. The latter is greatly infiltrated, measuring more than half an inch in thickness, and is much shortened. Very numerous tubercular nodules are seen, both on section and on the surface, and extending over the surface of the colon. (See for another part of same colon, Al. F. b. 12.) Al. F. b. 3 (889). Tubercular Peritonitis. The omentum is greatly and irregularly thickened by tubercular deposit. Al. F. b. 4 (898). Tubercular Peritonitis. The peritoneal cover- ing of the diaphragm is thickly studded with tubercle. Al. F. b. 5 (900). Tubercular Peritonitis. There is an adhesion of a coil of the ileum to the abdominal wall—the site of a previous tapping for ascites, which has become tubercular. Numerous tubercular nodules are seen in the mesentery and under the serous surface of the bowel, which also displays strands of fibrin. The omentum and the broad ligament of the uterus were similarly affected. Al. F. b. 6 (901). Tuberculosis of Intestine. The subserous tissue of the small intestine is studded with minute caseous tubercular nodules. Al. F. b. 7 (902). Tubercular Peritonitis. The coils of small intestine are matted together by organised adhesions, in which large caseous tubercles are seen. The subserous coat of the bowel is similarly affected. Injected specimen. Al. F. b. 8 (903)- Tubercular Peritonitis. The omentum and subserous coat of the colon are thickened, and caseous tuber- cular nodules of various size are seen on the peritoneal surface of the latter. Injected specimen. Al. F. b. 9 (907)- Tuberculosis of Peritoneum and Tubercular Ulceration of Intestine. The mucous membrane of the small intestine is transversely ulcerated. Caseous tubercular masses, the size of a small pea, are seen in the serous coat and peri- toneum. From a woman aged 34 who died of phthisis of six months’ duration.

PNEUMONIA. 237 Pulmonary Apoplexy (HcBinorrhagic Infarction) and Thrombosis, R. C. b. ^ R. C. b. 1 (2330). Pulmonary Apoplexy. Piece of Lung shewing a wedge-shaped infarct at its free margin. The colour of the blood has been largely destroyed by the action of spirit. The branches of the pulmonary artery seen in section are filled with clot. R. C. b. 2 (2316). Old Haemorrhagic Infarction of Lung shewing pigmented band surrounding caseated centre. R. C. b. 3 (2316a). Portion of Lung shewing Thrombi in branches of pulmonary artery. R. C. b. 4 (23166). Large Haemorrhagic infarction of same Lung as last; a branch of the pulmonary artery has been dissected to shew the decolourized clot which it contains. R. 0. b. 5 (2316c). Another portion of same Lung, shewing partially decolourized clots in two of the branches of the pulmonary artery laid open. Presented by Professor Sanders. Pneumonia, R. C. c. R. C. C. 1 (2335). Two portions of Lung injected; larger portion containing much injection nearly healthy; the smaller shews Grey Hepatisation. Prepared by Dr John Reid. R. C. C. 2 (2336a). Lung shewing consolidation from inflamma- tion. Grey Hepatisation. R. C. c. 3 (2337). Portion of Lung shewing Grey Hepatisation. R. C. C. 4 (2336). Injected Lung, upper portion with a scattered Broncho - pneumonic Tubercle; lower, apparently scattered Tubercle and extensive pneumonic consolidation. R. C. c. 5 (2337a). Small section of Lung, shewing Grey Hepatis- ation ; very slight Pleurisy. R. 0. c. 6 (2342). Consolidation of Lung, apparently from acute Pneumonia; Pleurisy with adhesions; large irregular cavity, probably an abscess, immediately beneath the pleura. R. 0. C. 7 (2422). Interstitial Pneumonia (? Anthracosis). Part of Lung shewing a mass of deeply pigmented fibrous tissue, and irregular fibrous bands and nodules. In the midst of the blackish mass caseous nodules encapsuled by fibrous tissue are visible. Pleura adherent and thickened. Microscopically shews dense bands of fibrous tissue containing pigment, but resembles more a chronic interstitial pneumonia than anthracosis. No trace of tubercle.

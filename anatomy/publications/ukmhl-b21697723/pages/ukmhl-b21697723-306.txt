UTERUS. 288 Gen.-U. N. g. 8 (1790). Myomata or Uterine “Fibroids.” The tumours are in various positions and stages of development. The largest, attached to the fundus by a pedicle, shews an extensive area of softening, as does also one of the smaller growths. The uterine cavity is somewhat enlarged and dis- torted. Gen.-U. N. g. 9 (1791)* Myoma Uteri or Uterine “Fibroid.” Three tumours attached by attenuated pedicles. They appear to be calcified. The left ovary is cystic. Gen.-U. N. g. 10 (1792). Multiple Myomata or Uterine “ Fibroids.” Multiple tumours, some of them confluent, are seen. They display the typical structure. The uterine cavity is slightly lengthened. Gen.-U. N. g. 11 (l793)* Myoma Uteri or Uterine “Fibroid.” Section of tumour of large size displaying the typical fasciculated arrangement. Presented by Dr Anderson. Gen.-U. N. g. 12 (1794). Myoma Uteri or Uterine “Fibroid.” The typical arrangement is not so well seen in this section. The fibrous elements preponderate. Gen.-U. N. g. 13 (1794a). Myoma Uteri or Uterine “Fibroid.” A tumour, the size of an orange, growing and encapsuled in the uterine wall. Gen.-U. N. g. 14 (1795). Myomata or “Fibroid” Tumours of the Uterus. Two rounded tumours about an inch in diameter. That situated at the fundus is undergoing calcification. Gen.-U. N. g. 15 (1796). Myomata or “Fibroid” Tumours of the Uterus. The two larger tumours are extensively calcified, and one appears to have become adherent to the surrounding tissues. Gen.-U. N. g. 16 (1797)- Myoma Uteri or Uterine “Fibroid.” A large tumour, intramural in position, half of which is entirely calcified. The other half appears to have undergone softening and ulceration on both sides of the uterine wall. The uterine cavity is much enlarged. Gen.-U. N. g. 17 (1798). Myoma or Uterine “Fibroid.” A large submucous tumour, partly enucleated, shewing calcifica- tion at its periphery. The uterine cavity is enlarged, and both ovaries cystic. A small subperitoneal fibroid is also present. Gen.-U. N. g. 18 (1799). Part of a Calcified Uterine Myoma or “Fibroid.” The so-called “Womb-stone.” Dried preparation. The whole tumour weighed 5 lbs., and was situated at the posterior part of the uterus. It caused the death of the patient by producing compression and rupture of a loop of the ileum consequent upon a fall. Presented by Dr Bazett Tytler.

201 INTESTINAL CONCRETIONS. Al. I. a. 46. A similar Intestinal Concretion, with lime salts filling up some of the pits on the surface. Al. I. a. 47. A tuberous Intestinal Concretion similar to the above, but much smaller. Al. I. a. 48. Half of an Intestinal Concretion, 5^^ inches in length, tuberculated on the exterior, and irregularly laminated on the cut surface. A small concretion seems to have, in the first instance, formed, and to have acted as a nucleus, around which additional deposits had taken place. Al. I. a. 49. Three quarters of an Intestinal Concretion. From Ruminant Animals. Al. I. a. 50. A very large Concretion from the Stomach of a Cow. Weight, 2 lbs. 14J oz.; length, io| inches; breadth, 6| inches; thickness, inches. It is largely composed of hair, which can be seen both on the surface and at a fractured end. Presented by Dr McNab, Jamaica. Al. I. a. 51. Concretion, about the size of an orange, from the Stomach of a Cow. Externally it is quite smooth and glisten- ing, and coated with mineral matter, probably phosphate of lime. No section has been made through it. Presented by R. H. Rozenzweig, Esq., May 1878. Al. I. a. 52. Hair Ball, about the size of a small orange, from the Alimentary Canal of a Cow. The hair is enclosed by a thin coating of phosphate of lime, which gives smoothness and hardness to the surface, but the hairs in the interior are loosely aggregated together, and there are no concentric laminae. Al. I. a. 53. Half of a Concretion from the Intestinal Canal of a Cow. The interior is felt-like, and presents a worm-eaten appearance. No concentric laminae. Al. I. a. 54. Half of an Intestinal Concretion, felt-like internally, and shewing several small round holes. The exterior is black and coated with lime salts. No concentric laminae. From a Cow. Al. I. a. 55. Spherical Hair Ball, about the size of an orange, from the Alimentary Canal of a Cow. A section has been removed to shew the texture of the ball within, which is some- what more compact than in the last specimen. No concentric laminae. A similar smooth envelope of lime salts is on the surface. Al. I. a. 56. Half of an Intestinal Concretion from a Cow. The interior is felt-like and not laminated. It shews more worm-eaten tracts than Al. I. a. 53. The exterior, which has a coating of lime salts, is peeling off in a conchoidal way.

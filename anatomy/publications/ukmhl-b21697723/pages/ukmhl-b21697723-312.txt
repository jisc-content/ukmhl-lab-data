Attached to the anterior aspect of the right ovary is a simple unilocular cyst about an inch and a half in diameter. Gen.-U. Q. f. 2 (1827)- Ovarian Cyst, about three inches in diameter, dissected out. Gen.-U. Q. f. 3 (1828). Ovarian Cysts. Uterus with its appen- dages. Larger cyst, in connection with left ovary, is divided into loculi by several imperfect septa. The smaller cyst is attached to the broad ligament on the right side. Gen.-U. Q. f. 4 (1829). Ovarian Cyst of large size, dissected out and collapsed. The walls are unusually thick. Gen.-U. Q. f. 5 (1831). Ovarian Cyst. Part of the wall of a large ovarian Qyst, shewing a dense laminated structure. Gen.-U. Q. f. 6 (1832). Ovarian Cyst, of large size, firmly adherent to the posterior aspect of the uterus. It is incom- pletely subdivided into several large compartments by dense fibrous septa. Gen.-U. Q. f. 7 (1833). Ovarian Cyst. Uterus and its append- ages, with cyst attached to, and involving, the right ovary. Gen.-U. Q. f. 8 (1834). Ovarian Cyst. Uterus and its append- ages, with part of a large cyst attached to right ovary. The cyst contained 140 ounces of fluid, and was adherent to the surrounding structures. Gen.-U. Q. f. 9 (1835). Part of a large multilocular, or com- pound, cystic ovarian adenoma, containing very numerous loculi of varying size. Gen.-U. Q. f. 10 (1836). Compound Cystic Ovarian Adenoma, of very large size, growing from left ovary. The cavities originally contained transparent semi-gelatinous material. Gen.-U. Q. f. 11 (1837)- Compound Cystic Ovarian Adenoma. Injected. The tumour is of large size, and is subdivided into numerous loculi, some of which still retain their semi-gelatinous contents, hardened and rendered opaque by the action of the spirit. The uterus and greatly elongated Fallopian tube are seen attached to the tumour. Inflammatory changes are also seen at some parts of the specimen. (See also Gen.-U. Q. f. 12 to 16.)

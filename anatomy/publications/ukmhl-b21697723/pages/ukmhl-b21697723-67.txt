47 RICKETS. Os. D. i. 26 (541). Another tibia, in which the flattening and in- ternal curvature of the shaft are less pronounced. Os. D. i. 27 (542). A similar specimen. Os. D. i. 28 (Y 18). A tibia, in which the shaft is curved distinctly forwards as well as inwards. In the same situation as was noted in Specimen 25 (543), there is a larger bony projection on the inner border, resembling an exostosis. Os. D. i. 29 (544). A fibula, in which the shaft is flattened from before backwards, and presents a slight degree of internal curva- ture. Os. D. i. 30 (545). A portion of a similar fibula, in which the flat- tening and curvature of the shaft are more pronounced. Os. D.i. 31. The tibia of an adult, presenting a marked curve forwards at the junction of the middle and lower thirds of the bone. The shaft is also flattened from side to side. Os. D. i. 32. A fibula, in which the shaft is remarkably flattened from side to side, and presents a sinuous curvature, convex anteriorly above, convex posteriorly below. Os. D. i. 33. The fibula of the opposite side, from the same subject. (Presented, with the two preceding specimens, by Professor Sir W. Turner.) Of the Bones of the Lower Vertebrates. Os. D. i. 34 (537)' bones of the inferior extremity of a Dog, in which the shaft of the tibia is extremely flattened from side to side and presents an anterior curvature which closely approaches a right angle. The fibula is similarly affected. Specimens illustrating the results of Periosteal changes in Rickets. [See also Skull, Diseases of—Rickets.] Osteomalacia. Os. D. j. [The only specimens of this in the Museum are included with the Diseases of the Vertebral Column and Pelvis.] Osteitis Deformans of Paget. Os. D, k. [See also Skull, Diseases of—Osteitis Deformans.] Os. D. k. 1 (161). The right Radius of an adult; the shaft is in- creased in circumference throughout, is slightly curved outwards and backwards, while the surface layer of the bone is roughened and porous. 'Fhese changes are possibly the result of osteitis deformans.

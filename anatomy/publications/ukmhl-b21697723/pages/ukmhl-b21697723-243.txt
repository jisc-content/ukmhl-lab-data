[The series of specimens of the tusks of the Elephant, illustrating the effects pro- duced by musket balls, partly belonged to the Ballingall Collection, and were partly presented to the Museum by Sir John Robison. They were described to the Royal Society of Edinburgh, Transactions, January 18, 1841, by Pro- fessor John Goodsir.J Al. M. f. 1 (B 241). A segment of the Tusk of an Elephant shewing a bullet wound on the surface, which has not healed, though an irregular formation of ivory has formed around it. Passing across the pulp cavity is a mass of new formation, in which the bullet is probably enclosed. Al. M. f. 2 (B 25). Section of the Tusk of an Elephant shewing an iron bullet lying in the pulp cavity, and surrounded by an irregular mass of new formation. Al. M. f. 3 (B 26). Section of the Tusk of an Elephant. An elongated mass of new formation has formed in the pulp cavity, which is hollow, and probably had lodged a musket ball. Al. M. f. 4. Transverse section through the entire thickness of an Elephant’s Tusk. An iron bullet is lodged in the substance of the ivory. The wall of the pulp cavity shews irregular masses of new formation. Al. M. f. 5. Section through a part of an Elephant’s Tusk. An iron musket ball is lodged in a large mass of new formation in the pulp cavity in close proximity to the Dentine of the tusk. Al. M. f. 6. Longitudinal section through an Elephant’s Tusk, shewing an elongated new formation in the pulp cavity which surrounds a musket ball. Drawn by Professor Goodsir, Fig. 3. Al. M. f. 7. Portion of the deep end of an Elephant’s Tusk, which on the outer surface has the appearance of a united fracture; whilst the surface bounding the pulp cavity is thickened by an irregular mass of new formation.

NERVOUS SYSTEM. 122 N. A.f. 14. Brain, with great Atrophy of the convolutions of the right cerebral hemisphere and with partial atrophy of the left hemisphere of the cerebellum. Described by Dr J. C. Howden, Montrose Asylum, in Journ. of Anat. a7id Phys.^ Vol. IX., p. 288. [See also Teratological Series.] Absorption of Brain Substance. N. A. g. N. A. g. 1 (1941a). Absorption of a part of the left frontal lobe, by pressure of a cyst, probably the result of haemorrhage. Presented by Dr J. Batty Tuke. See Edin. Med. Journ. September 1868, p. 205. N. A. g. 2 (1970). Absorption of Cerebral Substance. A portion of brain, the size of a walnut, has disappeared from the tem- poro-sphenoidal lobe. From an epileptic aged 50. N. A. g. 3 (1971). Absorption of Cerebral Substance. A convolu- tion has almost entirely disappeared, leaving a depression half an inch deep. (? From haemorrhage.) N. A. g. 4. Absorption of Cerebral Substance. A large portion of the cortex has been absorbed, leaving a hollow on the surface of the brain. Presented by Dr Howden, Montrose Asylum. N. A.g. 5. Partial absorption, due to the pressure of an aneurism of the anterior communicating artery. Presented by Professor Greenfield. N. A.g. 6 (1972a). Absorption of Cerebral Substance, with destruction of the posterior half of the left inferior or third frontal, convolution of the lower margin of the second frontal of the inferior third of the left ascending frontal and the inferior fourth of the left ascending parietal convolution. The resulting cavity was occupied by serum enclosed by the visceral arachnoid. There was at first complete aphasia, with subsequent recovery of the power of speech. Presented by Dr J. Batty Tuke. See Journal of Mc7ital Science.^ Vol. XVIII., p. 46. Atrophy. N. A. h. N. A. h. 1 (1973)- Atrophy of Optic Nerves. The right nerve is much atrophied immediately on quitting the commissure. There was amaurosis of the right eye. N. A. h. 2 (1974). Atrophy of Optic Nerve and Tract. The left optic nerve and the right optic tract are atrophied. N. A. h. 3 (1975)- Atrophy of Optic Tracts.

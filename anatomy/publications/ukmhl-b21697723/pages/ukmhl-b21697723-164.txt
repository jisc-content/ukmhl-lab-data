144 CIRCULATORY SYSTEM. Cir. O.f. 2. Heart greatly Hypertrophied and Dilated, shewing relations of cavities. Cir. C. f. 3. Heart shewing enormous Hypertrophy and Dilatation consequent on pericarditis. Presented by Professor Greenfield. Cir. C. f. 4 (2087)- Enlargement of heart as a whole; aneurism of mitral valve with perforation, probably secondary to aortic vegetations; vegetations on aortic valve; great dilatation and hypertrophy of left ventricle. Figured by Dr Byrom Bramwell, figs. 170, 171. Cir. C. f. 5. Transverse section of heart, shewing great Hypertrophy of the left ventricle in chronic Bright’s disease—without valvular disease. Presented by Professor Greenfield. Cir. C. f. 6. Heart shewing the great Hypertrophy of the left ven- tricle which may occur in chronic Bright’s disease. Presented by Professor Greenfield. Cir. C. f. 7. Heart shewing the Hypertrophy of the left ventricle with elongation produced by stenosis of the aortic valve. Presented by Professor Greenfield. Cir. C. f. 8 (2080). Hypertrophy of left ventricle; chronic endo- carditis of mitral valve; stenosis and calcification of aortic valve; dilatation of aorta. Cir. C. f. 9 (2081). Extreme Dilatation and Hypertrophy of left ventricle; chronic endocarditis of aortic valve and shrinking of segments ; atheroma of aorta. Cir. C. f. 10 (2078). Hypertrophy of The left ventricle; dilatation of the aorta and atheroma; chronic endocarditis of aortic valve; small vegetations on mitral valve. Cir. C. f. 11 (2079). Extreme Mitral Stenosis, with much thicken- ing of the segments of the valve; dilatation and slight hyper- trophy of left ventricle. Cir. C. f. 12. Heart shewing the altered shape and Dilatation of the right ventricle produced by chronic emphysema of the lungs. The right auricle is also much dilated. Presented by Professor Greenfield. Cir. C. f. 13 (2082). Heart greatly enlarged; Hypertrophy and Dilatation of left ventricle; chronic endocarditis of the aortic valve; atheroma and dilatation of aorta; extreme dilatation of the right side of heart; tricuspid orifice extremely dilated. Cir. C. f. 14 (2086). Dilatation of both auricles; Eustachian valve longer than usual, and partly filamentous. Cir. C. f. 15 (2085). Extreme Dilatation of right auricle and tricuspid orifice; hypertrophy of left ventricle; fibrinous clots at bottom of jar from dilated right auricle. Prof. Alison’s case.

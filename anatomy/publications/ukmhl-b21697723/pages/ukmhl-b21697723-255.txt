235 PLEURA. R. B. b. 19 (2346). Collapse of Lung; pleura-pulmonalis greatly thickened ; effusion into pleural cavity. R. B. b. 20 (2340). Right thoracic parietes with lung adherent to costal pleura. Cavity in lung communicating through open- ing in parietes with abscess in axilla. Empyema. Third rib slightly carious; third and fourth ribs shew marks of united fracture. R. B. b. 21 (2340a). Fracture of rib, communicating with cavity in Lung and Bronchus. Empyema. Right thoracic parietes with the lung firmly adherent. R. B. b. 22. Right Lung containing small cavities in upper lobe; large calcareous mass at anterior inferior angle of middle lobe, which had ruptured on mediastinal surface, and gave rise to an extensive Pneumothorax. A silver wire is in the opening. Pleura thickened with lymph. Presented by Professor T. R. Fraser. R. B. b. 23 (2351). Thickening of Pleura due to partial Necrosis of seventh rib, sinuses from which had opened on the surface of the chest wall, and sequestra and pus had escaped through the openings. R. B. b. 24 (2353). Ulceration of Sternum and Cartilages of the Ribs. An abscess had formed on the posterior aspect of the sternum, and the pleura is thickened. The abscess had discharged externally through an opening in the sternum. R. B. b. 25 (2357)- Abscess cavity between parietal Pleura and Ribs, connected with Caries and Necrosis of Ribs; pleura thickened; pus discharged externally. Patient a boy. R. B. b. 26 (2360).

Portion of rib with costal pleura attached, shewing a large patch of calcification. R. B. b. 28. Two specimens of Calcareous Concretions from the pleural membrane. R. B. b. 29. Portions of five ribs, on the inner surface of which is an extensive and thickened mass of calcified costal pleura. Presented by Professor Hughes Bennett.

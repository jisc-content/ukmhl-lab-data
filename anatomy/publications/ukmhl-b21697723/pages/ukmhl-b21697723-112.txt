92 DEFORMITIES OF THE PELVIS. Os. F. g. 3 (Y 47). A similar specimen, obtained from a woman on whom Professor Hamilton unsuccessfully performed the Caesarean operation, and described by him in his Pniciical Observations. The various diameters are inscribed on the specimen. Os. F. g. 4 (Y 50). A similar pelvis, from a woman on whom the Caesarean operation was unsuccessfully performed in the Royal Infirmary, under the direction of the late Professor Young. The specimen is figured in Professor Hamilton’s Practical Observa- tions, Plate IX. The various diameters are inscribed on the specimen. Os. F. g. 5 (Y 48). A similar specimen, in which fracture has occurred through the horizontal ramus of the pubis, and through the descending ramus at its junction with the ischium. Os. F. g. 6 (Y 52). A similar specimen, in which the pelvic outlet is especially contracted by the approximation of the ischial tubera and the anterior curvature of the lower part of the sacrum and coccyx. Os. F. g. 7 (517). A similar pelvis, in which the constituent bones are remarkably light, porous, and fragile. [For distortions of the pelvis resulting from rickets, see Bone, Diseases of— Rickets. Distortions of the pelvis resulting from spinal curvature are included with the Curvatures. See Os. F. e. i (347), Os. F. e. 4 (Y 41), Os. F. e. 5 (510), and Os. F. e. 9 (Y 44).] Tumours of the Vertebral Column. Os. F. h. Sarcoma—Secondary Cancer—Teratoma—Congenital Sacral Tumours. [No specimens.] DISEASES OF THE BONES OF THE SKULL, FACE, AND JAWS. Os. G. Congemtal Malformations of the Skull. Os. G. a. Cojigenital Deficie^icies in the Sktill resulting from hicomplete Ossification (Osteogenesis Cranii Imperfecta). Os. G. a. 1 (Y 169). A skull-cap, presenting two rounded apertures in the parietal bone on either side, close to the sagittal suture, and in the situation of the parietal foramina, large enough to admit the tip of the little finger, and occupied by a fibrous mem- brane belonging to the pericranium. The skull-cap in other respects is well developed.

TUBERCULOSIS. 243 R. C. g. 18 (2412). Chronic Phthisis; several irregular cavities near the surface; extreme thickening of the pleura at apex of the lung. R. 0. g. 19 (2412 ft). Section of Lung covered by long-standing pleuritic adhesions and thickening of the pleura; shewing more particularly several cavities around which the pulmonary substance is pale and contracted. R. 0. g. 20 (2413). Section of Lung covered by long-standing pleuritic adhesions. In its substance are several small cavities and deposits. Some of the latter have undergone calcification. R. O. g. 21 (2414). Injected preparation exhibiting a cicatrix on the surface of the Lung, with a subjacent cavity. R. 0. g. 22 (2415). Similar preparation from same Lung shewing the extent of the cavity more fully, with extensive adhesions above the cicatrix. R. C. g. 23 (2416). Part of apex of Lung, injected; old caseous nodules with fibrous thickening around. R. C. g. 24 (2417)- Opposite section of same injected Lung shewing puckering, contraction, and cicatrisation externally, with calcareous deposition. R. 0. g. 25 (2422). Part of a Lung shewing very chronic fibroid Phthisis; very dense deeply pigmented induration, containing some small caseous nodules. R. 0. g. 26 (2418). Section of Lung injected shewing adhesions and contraction at the apex; also deposit of calcareous and pigmentary matter. R. 0. g. 27 (2419). Similar specimen, with an atrophied and cicatrised projection at the apex of the organ. R. 0. g. 28 (2420). Lung injected, with several calcareous and pigmentary deposits; condensation and contraction of the pulmonary substance. R. C. g. 29 (2421). Portion of Lung shewing an unusual amount of black pigment, and a mass of calcareous deposit; around the latter the pulmonary substance is condensed. R. 0. g. 30 (2423). Scattered calcified nodules, surrounded by deeply pigmented fibrous tissue. Probably healed Tuberculosis. Presented by Professor Hughes Bennett. R. 0. g. 31 (2423 ft). Upper lobe of left Lung minutely injected. Whitish, rounded, tubercular patches are seen next the pleural surface. Close to the apex is situated a thickened cicatrix. â–  Q

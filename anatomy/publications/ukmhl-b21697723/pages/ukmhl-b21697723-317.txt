299 URINARY CALCULI. URINARY CALCULI. GEN.-U. S. [These Calculi were analysed in 1856 by Edmund Atkinson, Ph.D., and William Turner, Demonstrator of Anatomy, by the latter of whorh the following Catalogue was compiled.] Uric Acid. Gen.-U. S. a. In this section the great mass of each Calculus consists of uric acid. On exposure to heat in some instances a minute trace of ash is left, consisting of lime, either in combination with phosphoric acid or with uric acid. Gen.-U. S. a. 1. Oval and elongated laminated Calculus. Weight, 250 grains. Minute ash of phosphate and urate of lime. Gen.-U. S. a. 2. Oval laminated Calculus, tuberculated on sur- face. Weight, 318 grains. Gen.-U. S. a. 3. Elongated ovoid Calculus, laminated. Weight, 731 grains. Removed by operation in 1784. Gen.-U. S. a. 4 Large, irregularly oval laminated Calculus, with a roughened surface. Diameter, 4 inches \ circumference, 9 inches; thickness, ij inch; weight, 2786 grains. Removed by lateral operation. Minute ash of phosphate and urate of lime Presented by Professor Miller. Gen.-U. S. a. 5. Heart-shaped laminated Calculus, with roughened surface. Weight, 830 grains. Minute ash of phosphate of lime. Gen.-U. S. a. 6. Oval, flattened laminated Calculus of a yellowish- brown colour. Weight, 96 grains. Minute ash traces of phos- phate and urate of lime. Gen.-U. S. a. 7. Flattened, quadrilateral laminated Calculus.

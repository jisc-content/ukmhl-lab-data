NERVOUS SYSTEM. 132 DISEASES OF SPINAL CORD AND MEMBRANES. N. B. Malformations affecting the Spinal Cord and Membranes—Hydrorachis and Spina Bifida, N. B. a. N. B. a. 1 (2023). Spina Bifida. Wax cast shewing a hydrorachitic tumour above the sacrum, and an extensive bedsore over the sacrum and buttocks. The tumour was punctured several times with success to relieve paralysis. N. B. a. 2 (2024). Spina Bifida. The preparation shews the open condition of the spinal canal, due to non-development of the neural arches in the lumbar region. The skin, with an oval thinning corresponding to the opening, is preserved. From the same case as the preceding. N. B. a. 3 (2030). Sac of a Spina Bifida separated from the spine. N. B. a. 4 (2025). Spina Bifida. The neural arches of the lowest lumbar and upper three sacral vertebrae have failed to unite. N. B. a. 5 (2026). Spina Bifida. A great part of the lower half of the canal is open posteriorly. The non-development of the laminae is very well shewn. Dried preparation. N. B. a. 6 (2027 «)• Spina Bifida. The spinal cord and mem- branes from an infant three months old. N. B. a. 7 (20276). Spina Bifida. The lumbo-sacral region is dissected to shew the cord and nerves going to the posterior wall of the sac. Prepared in illustration of his thesis on spina bifida, and presented by Dr William Stewart, 1880. N. B. a. 8 (2027c). Spina Bifida. An anencephalous foetus, with dis- placement of the vertebral laminse. There is no spinal cord, and the spinal ganglia and nerves are developed independently. Prepared for his thesis, and presented by Dr William Stewart. Injuries to Spinal Cord and Cauda Equina. N. B. b. N. B. b. 1 (2015). Injury to the Spinal Cord. The whole of the cord is softened, the most marked disintegration being seen on its anterior surface opposite the sixth cervical and sixth and seventh dorsal vertebrae. The arachnoid was thickened and opaque, and blood was effused between the vertebrae and dura mater. Patient, a man aged 29, fell backwards on the wheel of his cart. For symptoms see MSS. Catalogue.

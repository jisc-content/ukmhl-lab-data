208 WAXY DEGENERATION. AI. K. g. 7 (1043). Section of right lobe of same Liver, to illus- trate the thinning down of the margin of the lobe and the fibrous seam which limits the uneven border in the advanced stage of cirrhosis. Al. K. g. 8 (1044). Another piece of the same Liver. A white mass, probably caseous, is surrounded by a dense white non- vascular area. Al. K. g. 9 (1046). Diffuse Cirrhosis of Liver, with much fatty infiltration. Presented by Professor Henderson. Al. K. g. 10 (1047)- Cirrhosis of Liver, partly finely-granular form. Microscopically it shews an advanced degree of common cirrhosis. Al. K. g. 11 (1048). A portion of a granular Cirrhosed Liver in an advanced stage. The organ was of a yellow or fawn colour, and much diminished in size. Al. K. g. 12 (1048a). An almost entire Liver, minutely injected with carmine by Mr A. B. Stirling. It shews typically the characters of the coarsely-granular form of common cirrhosis (“ hobnail ” form) and the vascularity of the bands of connective tissue. Presented by Professor Hughes Bennett. Al. K. g. 13 (1049). Common Cirrhosis of Liver in the last stage of the disease. It is greatly contracted, and extremely irregular on the surface, especially the upper surface. Presented by Professor Henderson. Al. K. g. 14 (H. 24). Part of a Liver shewing great diminution of left lobe, which is extremely nodulated on the surface (“hobnail ” cirrhosis). The right lobe is larger, and shews numerous small puckered cicatrices on the surface. Presented by Professor Sir T. Grainger Stewart. Fatty Degeneration and Infiltration. Al. K. h. Al. K. h. 1 (1051). Fatty Liver. Section of Liver in state of advanced fatty degeneration, shewing the pale colour of the gland in that condition. Waxy Degeneration. Al. K. i. Al. K. i. 1 (H. II.) Waxy Degeneration of Liver. Piece of Waxy Liver, mounted in iodised fluid. Shews the characteristic enlargement and solidity and smoothness of section. On the section the central and peripheral zones of each lobule are seen to be opaque (from alteration by spirit); the intermediate zone is translucent and of brownish colour from iodine staining.

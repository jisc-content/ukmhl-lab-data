ANEURISM. 155 Cir. G. d. 59 (2230). Aneurismal dilatation of the first and second parts of the arch of the aorta; saccular aneurism of the de- scending aorta; obliteration of thoracic duct. Cir. G. d. 60 (2230 a). Aneurism of descending aorta with atheromatous coats. The oesophagus, trachea, left bronchus and vagus are compressed, and the lumen of the thoracic duct is completely obliterated. See paper by Professor Sir William Turner in Edin. Monthly Med. Jour.., May 1859. Cir. G. d. 61 (2234). Small aneurism of descending aorta. Cir. G. d. 62 (2235). Aneurism of descending aorta, which has ruptured by a large opening at the upper part. Inner surface is studded with calcareous plates. Cir. G. d. 63 (2228). Large xAneurism of descending aorta filled with clot, which shews concentric lamination. The bodies of the fourth to eighth dorsal vertebrae are eroded. The aneurism burst into the left bronchus. Cir. G, d. 64(22306). Aneurism of descending part of thoracic aorta, just below root of lung, of the size of a cricket ball. The tumour compressed the left bronchus and oesophagus and completely obliterated the thoracic duct. The aorta is extremely atheromatous. See paper by Professor Sir William Turner in Edin. Monthly Med. Jour., May 1859. Dissecting Aneurisms of Thoracic Aorta. Cir. G. e. Cir. G. e. 1 (2136a). A transverse rupture of the ascending part of the arch of the aorta, about an inch beyond the valve. The coats are diseased, and the external is to a considerable extent separated from the middle coat, the outer coat is perforated, and the blood had entered the pericardium. From a woman aged 42. Presented by Dr Cairns. Cir. G. e. 2 (2155)- Dissecting aneurism of arch of the aorta, extending from origin to descending portion ; also upwards along innominate artery; portions of fibrinous clot between coats of aorta. Cir. G. e. 3 (2156). Dissecting aneurism of third portion of arch and descending aorta; outer coat laid open, shewing fibrinous clot between it and the media; first and second portions of aortic arch uniformly dilated. Cir. G. e. 4 (2157)- Extensive dissecting aneurism of portion of thoracic and abdominal aorta. Probably a continuation of Cir. G. e. 3. Cir. G. e. 5 (2153). Portion of aortic arch; extreme atheroma; dissection of coats.

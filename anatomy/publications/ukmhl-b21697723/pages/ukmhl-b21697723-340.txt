URINARY CALCULI. 322 Carbonate of Lime and Magnesia, Gen.-U. S. p. Gen.-U. S. p. 1. Round Calculus about the size of a large marble; hard consistence, and almost smooth exterior. Faint indications of a laminated structure on inner surface. Numer- ous crystals both on exterior and on surface of section. Carbonate of lime and magnesia—the former being in excess— with a slight trace of phosphate of lime. No history is attached to the Calculus; but it is probable, from its composition, that it has been derived from an herbivorous animal. Weight, 362 grains. Gen.-U. S. p. 2. Fragments of a Calculus; smooth and white externally. It consists of the carbonates of lime and magnesia in great abundance, with a small quantity of phosphate of lime.

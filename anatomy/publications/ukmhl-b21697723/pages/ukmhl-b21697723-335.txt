317 URINARY CALCULI. Gen.-U. S. i. 2. Flattened, ovoid, imperfectly laminated Calculus, with a white and rough surface externally. Weight, 285 grains. Oxalate of lime with phosphate of lime. Nucleus, Oxalate of Lime, Uric Acid externally, Gen.-U. S. k. Gen.-U. S. k. 1. Section of a flattened, oval, laminated Calculus; outer surface much broken. Nucleus, oxalate of lime; exterior uric acid and urate of ammonia. A trace also of phosphate of lime. Cystic Oxide. Gen.-U. S. 1. Gen.-U. S. 1. 1. One half of a Cystic Oxide Calculus, measuring i^^yths inch in long axis, yo^hs of an inch in its transverse axis. Its shape is ovoidal, outer surface tuberculated, section partly smooth, partly semicrystalline, centre hollowed. Phosphate of Lime. Gen.-U. S. m. • Gen.-U. S. m. 1. The cortical portion of a Calculus. “It is remarkably hard and brittle. On its exterior surface there is the appearance of a crystalline arrangement in the form of tubes. The Calculus consists of concentric coats, very slightly adhering to each other. The internal layers only differ from the external surface in being of a lighter colour and of a less crys- talline texture. It is composed of phosphate of lime and water, without any appreciable quantity of animal matter.” Analysed by Dr John Davy, described by Professor Alex. Monro, iertius, in Outlines of Anatomy, chap, xxxvii. p. 500, 1813. Q. D. d. 47 Old Catalogue. Gen.-U. S. m. 2. Fragments of a small and much worn Calculus, removed from a man in October 1777. Almost entirely phos- phate of lime, with a trace of urate of lime. From the Bell Collection. Presented by Dr G. Bell. Gen.-U. S. m. 3. Numerous fragments of a Calculus of a white colour. It is infusible, and consists essentially of phosphate of lime, although it contains a little uric acid and urate of ammonia, with traces of urates of potash and lime. Gen.-U. S. m. 4. Calculus of the size and shape of a large almond, passed by the urethra. Patient, a male. Length, ij inch; circumference at widest part, i| inch. Phosphate of lime with carbonate of lime, and trace of carbonate of magnesia. Q. D. d. 21 Old Catalogue,

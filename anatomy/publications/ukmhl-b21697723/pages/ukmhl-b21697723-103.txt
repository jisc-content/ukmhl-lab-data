83 ARTHRITIS DEFORMANS OF THE SPINE. Os. F. b. 4 (Y 17). A spinal column from the dissecting-rooms, in which the changes met with in cases of arthritis deformans are present to an unusually advanced degree. The spine presents a gradual posterior curvature and an abrupt lateral curvature ; the latter affects the lower dorsal and lumbar regions, and is asso- ciated with some rotation of the bodies of the vertebrae. More remarkable is the enormous amount of new bone which has been formed both on the anterior and posterior surfaces of the spine, bridging across the gaps between the bodies and in the lower dorsal and lumbar regions, completely burying the bones, and fusing them into an irregularly nodulated solid mass. Posteriorly the articulations between the articular processes of adjacent vertebrae are similarly buried in a mass of new bone. In con- junction with these changes in the spine there was a remarkable fibrous hypertrophy of the sympathetic nervous system upon the side corresponding to the convexity of the curvature. (The specimen is described by Dr D. J. Cunningham in the Journ. of Anat. and Phys. vol. ix. p. 306.) Os. F. b. 5 (Y 34). The sixth and seventh cervical and first dorsal vertebrae, in which the bodies are anchylosed to each other, and covered throughout by a thick layer of new bone on their anterior surfaces. Os. F. b. 6 (419). Seven dorsal vertebrae shewing a similar condi- tion, the new bone occupying the position of the anterior com- mon ligament, and shewing a marked tendency to be limited to the right side of the affected region of the spine. Os. F. b. 7 (414). A similar specimen. Os. F. b. 8 (422). A similar specimen, in which the new bone is in the form of thick plates bridging across the interval occupied by the intervertebral disc. Os. F. b. 9 (425). A similar specimen, in which the bony plates occupy the middle line of the spine anteriorly. Os. F.b. 10(Y32). A similar specimen. Os. F. b. 11 (420). A similar specimen. Os. F. b. 12 (421). similar specimen. Os. F. b. 13 (415)- A similar specimen. Os. F. b. 14 (423). A similar specimen. Os. F. b. 15 (424). A similar specimen. Os. F. b. 16 (429), Two lumbar vertebra, of which the bodies are anchylosed to each other by well-defined bridges of new bone arching from one body to the other. On the right side the bridge consists of one continuous plate ; on the left it is made up of two plates, each springing from the adjacent margin of either vertebra, and meeting in the interval between them, after the manner of a suture.

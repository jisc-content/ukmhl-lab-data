i6 FRACTURES OF THE LOWER EXTRExMITY. Os. B. e. 71 (140). A vertical section of an oblique fracture of the shaft of the tibia a little below its centre. The section shews the internal or myelogenic callus. Os. B. e. 72 (141). An oblique fracture of the tibia at the junction of its middle and lower thirds. Union with overriding and rounding off of projecting fragments have occurred. Os. B. e. 73 (142). A vertical section of an oblique fracture of the shaft of the tibia in its middle third, in which union has occurred, with overriding of the fragments. Os. B. e. 74 (143). An oblique fracture of the tibia at the junction of its upper and middle thirds. Os. B. e. 75 (145). A similar fracture of the shaft of the tibia at the junction of its middle and lower thirds. Os. B. e. 76 (146). A vertical section of an oblique fracture of the shaft of the tibia, preserved in turpentine. The section shews the internal or myelogenic callus. Os. B. e. 77 (147)- A similar specimen in the dried state; union with overriding of the fragments has occurred. Os. B. e. 78 (148). An oblique fracture of the tibia a little above the ankle-joint. Os. B. e. 79 (149). A vertical section of a fracture of the tibia through its middle third; union with overriding of the frag- ments has occurred, the lower projecting anteriorly and forming a prominence on the shin. Os. B. e. 80 (150)- A fracture of the tibia in its lower third; united with overriding of the fragments, the upper projecting anteriorly. Os. B. e. 81 (151). A vertical section of a fracture of the tibia at the junction of its middle and lower thirds, which has united, with slight lateral displacement of the fragments. Os. B. e. 82 (152). A vertical section of a fracture of the shaft of the tibia similar to the last. Os. B. e. 83 (153). A vertical section of an oblique fracture of the tibia in its middle third; union, with partial overriding from projection forwards of the lower fragment, has resulted. The section shews the method of reproduction of the medullary canal. Os. B. e. 84 (154). An oblique fracture of the tibia at the junction of its upper and middle thirds; union has occurred with slight overriding, the lower fragment projecting anteriorly. Os. B. e. 85 (154a). oblique fracture of the tibia at the junction of its middle and lower thirds ; united without deformity.

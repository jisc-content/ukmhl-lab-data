TESTIS. 28o Gen.-U. P. j. 6 (1458). Malignant Disease of Testis. The gland is enlarged and altered in shape and displays on section several nodules of soft new growth. Spermatic artery injected. Gen.-U. F. j. 7 (1459). Malignant Disease of Testis. The normal tissue of the organ is almost entirely replaced by new growth containing cyst-like spaces. Gen.-U. P. j. 8 (1460). Malignant Disease of Testis. The gland is much enlarged, and exhibits on section a mass of new growth containing small cyst-like spaces. Gen.-U. F. j. 9 (1461). Malignant Disease of Testis. The trans- verse section of the enlarged gland shews extensive infiltration by new growth. Injected. Gen.-U. F. j. 10 (1462). Malignant Disease of Testis. A fungat- ing new growth which has ulcerated through the skin. A small piece of scrotum is retained. The growth consists of fibrous trabeculae, and is probably a carcinoma with cystic degeneration. Gen.-U. F. j. 11 (1463). Malignant Disease of Testis. Large malignant tumour which has invaded and replaced the entire gland. Gen.-U. F. j. 12 (1464). Malignant Disease of Testis. Injected. The gland is enlarged and invaded by malignant new growth, some parts of which are soft, other parts being firm and con- taining cartilage. A chondro-adeno-sarcoma. The cavity of the tunica vaginalis is slightly dilated. Gen.-U. F. j. 13 (1465). Malignant Disease of Testis. The new growth, which is probably an adeno-sarcoma, contains numerous cysts, the largest about half an inch in diameter. Gen.-U. F. j. 14 (1466). Malignant Disease of Testis. The gland is much enlarged and infiltrated by a sarcoma. At its upper end is a cyst as large as a chestnut, which contained soft material. The cavity of the tunica vaginalis is slightly enlarged. Removed by operation. Gen.-U. F. j. 15 (1471). Malignant Disease of Testis. The whole organ is infiltrated by new growth, probably sarcomatous in nature. Gen.-U. F. j. 16 (1471a). Malignant Disease of the Testis. Injected specimen. Section of the testicle which contains numerous small thick-walled cysts, many of which are filled with colloid material. There are numerous small nodules of cartilage. A chondro-adenoma. Presented by Mr F. M. Caird. III. Teratomas. Gen.-U. F. k. Gen.-U. F. k. 1. Dermoid Cyst of the Testicle, shewing growth of hair from the inner surface of the sac. From a horse. Presented by Principal Owen Williams, 1901.

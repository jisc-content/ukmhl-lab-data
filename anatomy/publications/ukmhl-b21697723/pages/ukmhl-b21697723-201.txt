I8l INTESTINE. Al. E. e. 6 (8446). Intestinal Perforation, probably Traumatic. The lips of the opening are everted, and inflammatory exuda- tion is seen on the serous coat. Al. E. e. 7 (863).

Intestinal Ulceration. Two small transverse ulcers at end of a Peyer’s patch. Injected specimen. Al. E. f. 2 (836). Intestinal Ulceration. A similar condition. The ulceration in the Peyer’s patch is more advanced. Injected specimen. Al. E. f. 3 (837). Intestinal Ulceration. The specimen shews extensive ulceration of the mucous membrane of the small intestine, thickening of the valvulae conniventes, and haemor- rhage into the subserous tissue. Al E. f. 4 (841). Intestinal Ulceration. An irregularly oval, transverse ulcer of the small intestine, with three perforations. Al. E. f. 5 (842). Enteritis, with Acute Ulceration. Portion of small intestine, shewing inflammation of mucous membrane, and two sloughing irregular ulcers. Injected specimen, from the same case as preceding. Al. E. f. 6 (843). Enteritis, with Ulceration. A portion of small intestine, with extensive extravasation of blood. In places it is thinned, even perforated. Presented by Prof. Grainger Stewart. Al E. f. 7 (844). Intestinal Ulceration. Another portion of intestine from the same case, shewing a more extensive series of perforations. Presented by Professor Grainger Stewart. See also Cir. G. f. 5 (2239.) Al. E. f. 8 (844 a). Follicular Enteritis. The orifices of the mucous glands are much enlarged, and there is a patch of commencing ulceration. Inflammatory exudation is seen on the serous coat. Al. E. f. 9 (846). Intestinal Ulceration. The mucous membrane of the caput caecum coli shews irregularly shaped transverse ulcers and cicatrices. Injected specimen. Al. E. f. 10 (847)- Ulceration of Caput C^cum Coli. A similar preparation to preceding. The ulcers are smaller, deeper, and more numerous. Injected specimen. Al. E. f. 11 (850). Intestinal Ulceration. Extensive ulceration of the mucous membrane of caput caecum is seen. Two ulcers have exposed the muscular coat.

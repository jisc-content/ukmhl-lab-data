OIROULATOEY SYSTEM. Cir. HEART AND PERICARDIUM. Malformations. Cir. A. Cir. A. 1 (2116). Extreme Stenosis of Pulmonary Artery; great hypertrophy and dilatation of right ventricle; patency of foramen ovale at lower part; thrombosis of right ventricle. Died cet. 19. Cir. A. 2 (2117)- Stenosis of Pulmonary Valve, with union of the segments, probably due to foetal endocarditis; walls of right ventricle thickened. Cir. A. 3 (2120). Malformation of Heart, consisting of stenosis of pulmonary artery; incomplete closure of interventricular septum; partial origin of aorta from right ventricle. Cir. A. 4 (2121). Malformation of Heart. Extreme pulmonary stenosis; incomplete closure of ventricular septum; displace- ment of septum towards the right. Cir. A. 5 (2075)' Heart shewing abnormal development of moderator bands. Presented in 1871 by Professor Sanders. Cir. A. 6. Dissection of heart to shew the pars membranacea septi or “ undefended space ” in the base of the interventricular septum. Prepared by Professor Sir William Turner. Cir. A. 7. Patency of Foramen Ovale. Heart from a case of myxoedema; male, aged 60; shews partial patency of foramen ovale at the upper part; some hypertrophy and dilatation of cavities. Presented by Professor Greenfield. Cir. A. 8. Septal portion of an adult heart with partial Patency of Foramen Ovale. The opening between the two auricles is very oblique, and a probe is passed through it. Cir. A. 9. Partial Patency of Foramen Ovale in the heart of a youth. The interauricular communication is directed obliquely and a probe has been passed through it. Cir. A. 10 (2102). Malformation of Valve. Saccular dilatation projecting towards ventricle from one of aortic valve segments. Probably a congenital malformation—supplementary segment. Professor Hughes Bennett’s case.

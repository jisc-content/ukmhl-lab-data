6 FRACTURES OF THE SHOULDER GIRDLE. Os. B. d. 7 (46). Sections of several clavicles shewing the union after fracture. Os. B. d. 8 (47)* A linear fracture of the right Scapula, extending from the middle of its superior border to the commencement of the spine. Firmly united. Os. B. d. 9 {48). A right scapula, with three oblique fractures through its acromion j)rocess, only one of which has reunited, viz., that one close to the tip of the process. Os. B. d. 10 (Y 5). An ununited fracture of the shaft of the Humerus ; the ends of the bone are altered in form, rounded off and eroded, and overlap one another, forming a false joint. Os. B. d. 11 (396Z). A fracture of the shaft of humerus in its middle Third. United. Os. B. d. 12 (49). A compound fracture of the shaft of a humerus in its lower third. Union has not taken place. Os. B. d. 13 (50). A scapula and humerus ; the latter is fractured through its neck and its shaft; union has occurred, with absorp- tion and shortening. The articular surfaces of the bones exhibit changes like those seen in arthritis deformans; they are bared of cartilage, condensed, and worn on the surface, broadened out, and surrounded by irregular new bone.' Os. B. d. 14(51). An impacted fracture of the neck of the right humerus, cut in vertical section ; the head of the bone has been broken off at the level of the anatomical neck, and the upper end of the shaft driven into the head. The fragments are partly united by fibrous tissue thrown out by the periosteum of the upper end of the shaft. Os. B. d. 15(52). A longitudinal section of the shaft of the humerus, shewing an old fracture in its middle third. Os. B. d. 16 (53). A longitudinal section of the shaft of the right humerus which has been broken through its middle third. Os. B. d. 17 (54). A fracture of the shaft of the humerus in its middle third. United. Os. B. d. 18 (54a). A fracture of the shaft of the right humerus of a child, in which the periosteum has been reflected to demonstrate the ensheathing callus. Os. B. d. 19 (546). A longitudinal section of a fracture of the sur- gical neck of the left humerus of a child. Imperfectly united. Os. B. d. 20 (54c). Opposite half of last specimen. Os. B. d. 21 (55). A longitudinal section of the right humerus, which has been obliquely fractured through the lower part of its shaft, and united with considerable deformity.

SUPPURATIVE DISEASES OF BONE. 35 Os. D. d. 17(225). A femur, cut in longitudinal section, and shew- ing a cavity in its middle third opening on the surface by an old sinus. The bone of the shaft is much denser than normal (sclerosis), and is covered externally by periosteal deposit. Os. D. d. 18 (232). A portion of the femur, in which the lower end is much expanded by a cavity in the interior of the bone, which opens on the surface by a small cloaca. (There was probably a sequestrum in the interior.) Os. D. d. 19 (243). The tibia and fibula of an adult; the former is expanded in its upper third, and has a cavity in its substance, which communicates with the surface by two small sinuses; the bone forming the wall of the cavity is sclerosed. Os. D. d. 20 (274). T he upper end of a tibia, similarly expanded, with a cavity in its substance, which communicates with the surface by a slit-like cloaca. Os. D. d. 21 (308). A large sequestrum, from a case of necrosis of the femur. Os. D. d. 22 (309a). A sequestrum removed from the femur. (From a student of medicine, and presented by him to the Museum.) Os. D. d. 23 (310). A sequestrum, from a case of necrosis of the femur. Os. D. d. 24 {319). A large sequestrum, from a case of necrosis of the tibia. Os. D. d. 25 (321). Several large sequestra, from different cases of necrosis of the tibia. Os. D. d. 26 (322). A sequestrum, from a case of necrosis of the tibia, partially enveloped by new bone. Os. D. d. 27 (A 93). T hree portions of bone which had apparently been extruded from a case of compound fracture; the larger fragment consists of newl)^-formed bone. {Ballingall Collection.) Os. D. d. 28 (A 94). Three small sequestra, extruded in a case of compound fracture of the leg. (^Ballingall Collection 1) Os. D. d. 29 (324). A large sequestrum, from a case of necrosis of the tibia. Os. D. d. 30 (A 95). “ A series of fragments of fractured bone, of which five are sequestra, while five are separated fragments encrusted with new bone. No history.” (^Ballingall Collection.) Os. D. d. 31 (Y 116). The Cannon bone of a Ruminant, entirely enveloped and buried in a thick mass of new bone of an irre- gular and coarse, spongy character, presenting a broad groove posteriorly for the flexor tendons, while anteriorly there is a large

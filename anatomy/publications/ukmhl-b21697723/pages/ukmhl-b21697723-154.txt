134 NERVOUS SYSTEM. Softening of Spinal Cord. N. B. d. N. B. d. 1 (2039). Dilatation of the Central Canal. A section of spinal cord laid open to shew irregular enlargement of the central canal and surrounding softening. N. B. d. 2 (2032). Inflammatory Softening of the Spinal Cord. The whole substance of the cord in the lower cervical and upper dorsal regions is softened, flattened, and its continuity inter- rupted. Patient, aged 41, suffered for two years from gradually increasing paralysis, sensory and motor, in the left arm and leg, which afterwards extended to other parts of the body. N. B. d. 3 (2033). Inflammatory Softening of the Spinal Cord. An area of destruction is seen in the dorsal region. The arteries are injected. N. B. d. 4 (2034). Inflammatory Softening of the Spinal Cord. The whole cord is softened, and in the lower dorsal region dis- integrated. Tumours of Membranes of Spinal Cord. N. B. e. N. B. e. 1 (2045)- Malignant Disease of the Spinal Membranes. The external surface of the dura mater in the lumbar region displays a fungating mass of various consistency ; cartilaginoid with bone-like spicula in some parts, in others soft and broken down. The cord, as well as the lumbar part of the spine, is con- siderably distorted. Patient, aged 50, suffered from paraplegia. N. B. e. 2 (2046). Malignant Disease of the Spinal Membranes. The membranes lining the canal are infiltrated with new growth, and the cord is compressed in the lower dorsal region. Behind the aorta is a mass of the morbid growth which affected the mesenteric glands and other organs. Professor Hughes Bennettâ€™s case. Vide Monthly Medical Journal^ 1848, p. 701. N.

Both vagi, with their re- current nerves, were divided experimentally eight days before the death of the dog. See MSS. Catalogue. N. 0. a. 2 (2021). Injuries of Nerves. A frog, in which the sciatic nerve was divided experimentally a year before it was killed. The nerve had reunited. From the Monro Collection.

140 CIRCULATORY SYSTEM. Oir. A. 11 (2103). Malformation of the Aortic Valve. Irregularity in size of segments; chronic endocarditis and recent acute ulcerating endocarditis. Oir. A. 12 (2142). Malformation of Great Vessels. Patency of ductus arteriosus. Fusiform aneurism of third part of arch of aorta, commencing just beyond the origin of the left subclavian artery. The ductus arteriosus is patent; the vessel is the size of a quill. There is some atheroma, also vegetations, partially calci- fied, around its orifice in the pulmonary artery. Aneurismal dilatation at its aortic end. Oir. A. 13 (2154). Extreme stenosis of the Aorta, probably congenital, immediately beyond the entrance of the ductus arteriosus, shewing smooth lining on distal side of closure; extreme atheroma of proximal part of aorta; healthy beyond stricture. Oir. A. 14 (2064). Cyst from Pericardium; possibly due to malformation. DISEASES OF THE PERICARDIUM. Cir. B. Acute and Ch7'onic Inflammation a7id their results, Cir. B. a. Cir. B. a. 1 (2052).

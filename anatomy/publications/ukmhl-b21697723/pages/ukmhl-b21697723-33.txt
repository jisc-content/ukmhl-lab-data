FRACTURES OF THE LOWER EXTREMITY. 3 Os. B. e. 40 (iim). A comminuted fracture of the shaft of a femur through its lower third. Deformed union has resulted from overriding of the fragments. Os. B. e. 41 (lI2). An oblique fracture of the shaft of the left femur. Deformed union has resulted with overriding, the upper fragment lying in front and to the inner side of the lower. Os. B. e. 42 (113)- A fracture of the lower end of the right femur from a musket-ball, fragments of which are seen embedded in the new bone on the posterior aspect of the shaft, d'he union is deformed from backward displacement of the lower fragment. (From a soldier who was wounded many years before death.) Os. B. e. 43 (114)- A fracture of the shaft of the left femur at its lower third (probably the opposite half of Specimen in, Os. B. e. 39). Os. B. e. 44(ii6). A transverse fracture of the shaft of a femur in its middle third. Deformed union has occurred from overriding of the fragments for 5 cm. or more. The specimen is cut in longitudinal section to shew the manner in which the open end of the medullary canal has been covered in by new bone in each of the fragments. Os. B. e. 45 (II7). A fracture of the shaft of the femur of a Cat at its lower end ; united, with overriding of the fragments and a large amount of ensheathing callus. Os. B. e. 46 (118). A fracture of the femur of a Goose. The frag- ments are united with overriding. The specimen is cut in section to shew the restoration of the medullary canal. Os. B. e. 47 (119). T he bones of the right knee-joint; there is a transverse comminuted fracture of the femur above the condyles, with partial union and alteration of the articular surfaces from dis- organisation of the joint. The fracture was probably compound, and caused a suppurative arthritis in the knee. Os. B. e. 48 (119a). A transverse Fracture of the left Patella; the fragments are united by a band of fibrous tissue 5 cm. in length, which, in the dried state, is in the form of a thin aponeurosis. Os. B. e. 49 (120). A transverse fracture of the patella; the fragments are united by fibrous tissue of great thickness and density, there being an interval of 2*5 cm. between the frag- ments. Os. B. e. 50 (1206) A transverse fracture of the patella; there is an interval of 2-5 cm. between the fragments, which are united by fibrous tissue in the form of a broad thin band. Os. B. e. 51 (121). One fragment from a transverse fracture of the patella.

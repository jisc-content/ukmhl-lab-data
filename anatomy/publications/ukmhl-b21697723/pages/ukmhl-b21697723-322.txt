304 URINARY CALCULI. Gen.-U. S. a. 67. Part of a small laminated Calculus; the outer coats much broken ; nucleus entire. Uric acid. Gen.-U. S. a. 68. Sections of Calculus. From their waxy lustre and smooth surfaces, uric oxyd was suspected, but on treating with nitric acid and ammonia the characteristic purple reaction of uric acid was given. Uric Acid and Urate of A imnonia. Gen.-U. S. b. Gen.-U. S. b. 1. Section of a Calculus, laminated; outer surface slightly tuberculated. It consists of uric acid and urate of ammonia, with a little urate of lime. Two Calculi, removed from the same bladder by Professor Miller. The larger one was encysted, the end bounded by the ink line being the only part that projected into the cavity of the bladder. Gen.-U. S. b. 2. Oval and flattened Calculus, laminated; sur- face smooth externally. Weight, 740 grains. Chiefly uric acid, with some urate of ammonia. Minute ash of phosphate of lime. From the Bell Collection. Presented by Dr G. Bell. Gen.-U. S. b. 3. Two sections of a large, roundish, flattened Calculus; outer surface tuberculated, cut surface somewhat cancellous. Weight, iiii grains. Chiefly uric acid, a little urate of ammonia, phosphate of lime, and urate of soda. Gen.-U. S. b. 4. Longitudinal section of a large, oval, uric acid Calculus; outer surface somewhat tuberculated, section lamin- ated. Length, 3 inches ; breadth, 2 J inches. Chiefly uric acid, small quantity of urate of ammonia; ash, minute, composed of phosphate of lime. Gen.-U. S. b. 5. Section of a large Calculus, laminated; smooth externally. Chiefly uric acid, a little urate of ammonia. Small ash of phosphate of lime. Gen.-U. S. b. 6. Section of a large, oval Calculus, laminated. Length, 2J inches. Surface rather rough. Chiefly uric acid, a little urate of ammonia on surface. Small ash of phosphate of lime. Gen.-U. S. b. 7. Two sections of a Calculus, laminated and com- pact; outer surface smooth. Weight, 825 grains. Chiefly uric acid, with some urate of ammonia. Minute ash of phosphate of lime. Gen.-U. S. b. 8. Section of an oval Calculus, laminated and compact; outer surface smooth. Chiefly uric acid, with some urate of ammonia. Minute ash of phosphate of lime.

PREFACE. The Anatomical Museum in the University of Edinburgh con- sisted originally of the private collection formed by Professor Alexander Monro primus. It was largely added to by his son, Professor Alexander Monro secundus, who, in the year 1798, presented his own collection of anatomical preparations, together with that of his father, to the University, in the following terms:—“ I, Alexander Monro, Pro- fessor of Medicine, Anatomy, and Surgery in the University of Edinburgh, hereby give and bequeath to the said University, for ever, my whole collection of anatomical preparations, with all the vessels and cabinets in which they are contained in the several rooms connected with the Anatomical Theatre, to be used by myself and my eldest son, my colleague, during our lives, and after our decease by our future successors in office, for the purpose of demonstrating and explaining to the students of the University the structure, physiology, and diseases of the human body.” Accompanying the collection was a manuscript catalogue consisting of three folio volumes, compiled under the direction of Dr Alexander Monro secundus. After the accession of Dr Alexander Monro tertius to the Chair of Anatomy, additional accommodation was provided for the Museum, then located in the University Buildings in the South Bridge. The collection in the course of years had been materially added to, and the Museum was thrown open to the students of the University and to the medical profession. As a manuscript catalogue was not well adapted for reference, it was decided to print a catalogue of the collection, so as to render the Museum more instructive to its visitants. The work of prepar- ing the catalogue for the press was entrusted to Mr William Mackenzie, Fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons of England, who at that time was both Conservator of the Museum and Demonstrator of Anatomy with Professor Monro. The Catalogue was published in 1829, with the title of “The Descriptive Catalogue

214 BILIARY CALCULI. Al. K. S. 2 (1098.) Gall-bladder, shewing some dilatation and ulceration of its mucous surface. A perforation of the walls communicated with the abscess cavity the size of an orange, which was bounded by the adjacent viscera. The bile ducts were pervious. From a woman 62 years of age. Al. K. s. 3. Portion of a Liver with a greatly distended Gall- bladder. A small part of the duodenum is attached, and bristles have been passed into the pancreatic and common bile ducts. Al. K. S. 4. Cast of the under surface of Liver shewing a greatly distended Gall-bladder and common bile duct. The duct had been obstructed by a tumour, apparently cancerous, in the head of the pancreas, which had also obstructed the pancreatic duct and caused a cystic dilatation of the gland vesicles. See descrip- tion by Professor Sir W. Turner in Journal de VAnato7nie et de la Fhysiologie, March 1861. Al. K. s. 5 (H 21). Liver shewing results of impaction of a Calculus in the cystic duct, immediately beyond the outlet of the gall-bladder. The latter is dilated, its walls thin. Pre- sented by Professor Sir T. Grainger Stewart. Al. K. S. 6 (1100). Gall-bladder and Common Bile Duct, much enlarged and thickened. The latter contains several calculi, and is much dilated. Al. K. S. 7 (llOOti!). Greatly elongated Gall-bladder, containing a mass of biliary calculi which almost filled it. From the Dis- secting Room. Presented by Professor Sir W. Turner. Al. K. S. 8 (1107). Enlargement of Hepatic Duct from Calculus. Al. K. S. 9 (1108). Dried preparation of elongated Gall-bladder, containing three gall stones in the fundus and two m.ore at the commencement of the cystic duct. Al. K. S. 10 (1109). Gall-bladder shewing Hepatic Duct dilated; several calculi in common duct. Al. K. S. 11 (1109a). Portion of Duodenum shewing a Calculus lodged in the lower end of the common bile duct, close to its outlet. Presented by Professor Henderson. Al. K. S. 12 (11096). Dried preparation of the Gall-bladder. Small calculus impacted at commencement of cystic duct. Al. K. S. 13 (1103). Part of the Liver with the Gall-bladder attached, and laid open to shew Biliary Calculi, which com- pletely fill its interior. The walls are much thickened. Al. K. S. 14 (1105). Dried preparation of the Gall-bladder, con- taining several Calculi the size and shape of a pea, one of which has lodged in the cystic duct.

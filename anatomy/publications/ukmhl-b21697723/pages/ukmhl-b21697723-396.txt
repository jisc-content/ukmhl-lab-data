Large Myeloid Sarcoma, which seems to have grown from the lower end of the femur. There are several large haemorrhages in the substance of the tumour. T. B. e. 2. Myeloid Sarcoma, lower end of femur, duration five months. X-ray examination shewed a shadow but lighter than bone. The bone has been entirely absorbed at the site of the tumour, and the cartilage forms but a thin covering at the joint surface. The tumour is for the most part of a dark reddish- brown colour, due to haemorrhages, and of soft consistence, but in parts, especially at the periphery, is whitish, and of firmer consistency. Microscopically, the tumour is found to be a Spindle Celled Sarcoma with numerous giant cells. January 29th, 1904.

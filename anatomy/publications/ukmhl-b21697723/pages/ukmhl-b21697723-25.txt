FRACTURES OF THE SHOULDER GIRDLE. 5 Os. B. C. 2 (Y 3). Fracture of several Ribs at their angles; in the process of repair new bone has been thrown out between the ribs ; the outgrowths from adjacent bones meet in a series of false joints, (From the Dissecting-Room.) Os. B. C. 3 (Y 4). Fracture of two ribs at their angles ; union with anchylosis of the bones has taken place as a result of the large amount of ensheathing callus around each fracture. Os. B. C. 4 (31a). Portion of a rib which is said to have been fractured. There is an irregular excavation in its interior, opening both on the external and internal surfaces. Os. B. c. 5 (34). Portions of five ribs which have been fractured. They have been sawn longitudinally to shew the lines of union. In one rib the fracture has not yet united; in another, both the intermediate and the ensheathing callus are well seen. Os. B. C. 6 (35). A similar specimen. Os. B. C. 7 (36). Fracture of a costal cartilage, reunited by bone. Os, B. C. 8 (37). Fracture of two ribs, united and anchylosed with one another by new bone over an area of 6*5 cm. in extent. Fractures of the Shoulder Girdle and Upper Extremity. Os. B. d. Os. B. d. 1 (41). A right Clavicle, fractured about 2*5 cm. from its sternal end; united, with the outer fragment overriding, in front of the small inner fragment. Os. B. d. 2 (42). A right clavicle, obliquely fractured through its middle ; united ; the inner fragment slightly overrides the outer. Os. B. d. 3 (43). A right clavicle, fractured at its acromial end, and united, with forward rotation of the outer fragment, to nearly a right angle. Os. B. d. 4 (44). A right clavicle, fractured in its middle third, and united, with very marked overriding of the inner fragment. Os. B. d. 5 (44a). An Ununited Fracture of the clavicle from a young subject; the fragments are rounded off, and are united by a tough band of fibrous tissue of 1*5 cm. in length. The shaft of the bone is unusually thin. Os. B. d. 6 (45)* A longitudinal section of the right clavicle, which has been fractured through its middle third, and united, with overriding of the inner fragment.

MORBID GROWTHS IN LUNG. 247 R. 0. k. 7 (2459). Another portion of same Lung. R. C. k. 8 (2460). Another portion of same Lung. R. C. k. 9 (2462). Another portion of same Lung. R. 0. k. 10 (2454a). Section of Lung injected, with a large tumour attached. Presented by Professor Hughes Bennett. R. 0. k. 11 (2464). Lung, universally affected with Melanotic growth, occurring as rounded masses of variable size; many of the size of peas project from and are attached to the pleural surface by a short pedicle; others in the substance of the lung are larger and may be due to coalescence. Other organs simi- larly affected. Presented by Professor Hughes Bennett. R. C. k. 12 (2465)- Strip of the Costal Pleura of the same lung detached, and studded with Melanotic growths which projected into the cavity of the pleura. R. C. k. 13 (2466). Lung shewing multitudes of small nodular masses of Melanotic new growth, projecting from the pleural surface. They contrast very strikingly with the ordinary pigmentary deposits of advanced life, which are very numerous in the present instance. R. 0. k. 14 (2467). Lobe of a Lung shewing similar appearances. The vessels have been minutely injected. R. 0. k. 15. Lung which contains masses of yellowish white new growths, which vary in size from a pea to a florin. Many lie near the pleural surface. R. C. k. 16. Lung shewing a large new growth in its substance regarded as cancerous. Presented by Professor Sanders. R. C. k. 17. Right Lung shewing numerous sub-pleural new growths, which vary in size from a millet seed to a walnut. Others are found in the costal pleura. The bronchial glands at the root of the lung are also enlarged. Presented by Professor Greenfield. R. 0. k. 18. Left Lung shewing a large mass of apparently cancerous substance near the anterior border. Both upper and lower lobes are partially disintegrated and hollowed out into cavities. Pleura greatly thickened. Presented by Professor T. R. Fraser.

SPINAL CORD AND MEMBRANES. 133 N. B. b. 2 (2016). Injuries to the Spinal Cord. A section of the vertebral column, exhibiting compression and destruction of the spinal cord from angular curvature, following on fracture of a dorsal vertebra. N. B. b. 3 (2017). Injuries of the Spinal Cord. The correspond- ing section to No. 2016. N. B. b. 4 (3516). Portion of the Spine of a girl aged 15, who died with paraplegia, illustrating angular or Pottâ€™s curvature. The vertebrae involved are tenth, eleventh, and twelfth dorsal, and first and second lumbar. N. B. b. 5 (2019, 2020). Injuries of the Spinal Cord. A series of frogs that lived six weeks after the removal experimentally of a great part of the spinal cord. From the Monro Collection. N. B. b. 6 (2038). Compression of the Spinal Cord from Caries of the Vertebral Column. Disease of the bodies of the second and third dorsal vertebrae has resulted in their partial destruction and pressure on the spinal cord by the sac of caseous debris, which has become adherent to the dura mater. The sac also projects for- wards beneath the anterior common ligament, and communicates with a collection of caseous material behind and to the side of the oesophagus. The anterior aspect of the body of the fourth dorsal vertebra shews commencing disease. Above the point of pressure the cord appears swollen ; below, it is diminished in size and degenerated. N. B. b. 7 (2035). Abscess in spinal canal in the region of the Cauda Equina. The posterior aspect of the body of the fourth lumbar vertebra is eroded. The abscess communicated ex- ternally by a large sinus. N. B. b. 8 (2836). Opposite half of the same. N, B. b. 9. Cauda Equina, in which the roots of the lower lumbar and upper sacral nerves are transfixed by a needle which had entered the spinal canal, between the laminae of the fourth and fifth lumbar vertebrae. Described by David Hepburn, M.D., in Jour, of Anat. and Phys.^ Vol. XXII., p. 8. Presented by Professor Sir William Turner. Calcification of the Spinal Membranes. N. B. c. N. B. C. 1 (2028). Thin, irregular calcified or bone-like plates are seen in the arachnoid over the posterior aspect of the cord at different levels, but more especially over the lumbar enlarge- ment. From an old man. N. B. c. 2 (2029). Numerous small calcified bone-like plates are seen adhering to the inner surface of the arachnoid in the dorsal region.

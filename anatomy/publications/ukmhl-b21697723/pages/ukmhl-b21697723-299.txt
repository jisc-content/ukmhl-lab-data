DISEASES OF TUNICA VAGINALIS. 28 TUNICA VAGINALIS TESTIS AND SPERMATIC CORD. GEN.-U. G. Malformations, Gen.-U. G. a. (See Catalogue of Anatomical Section of Museum, Series CXVIII.) Injuries. Gen.-U. G. b. [No specimens.] Hydrocele. Gen.-U. G. c. Gen.-U. G. C. 1 (1428). Hydrocele of the Spermatic Cord. The coverings of the hydrocele. Gen.-U. G. C. 2 (1430). Hydrocele of the Tunica Vaginalis. At the lower part the tunica vaginalis has separated from its outer covering, which is much thickened and condensed. Near the testis is a large opening leading to a separate cyst. Gen.-U. G. C. 3 (1431). Hydrocele of the Tunica Vaginalis. The tunica vaginalis is thickened and in many places calcified. There is exudation on the internal surface, and at one point two round patches, one of which appears to be formed by deposit of cholesterin under the serous surface. Gen.-U. G. C. 4 (1432). Hydrocele of the Tunica Vaginalis. Crystals of cholesterin, which were found suspended in the hydrocele fluid removed from the preceding specimen. The specific gravity of the fluid was 1018. Gen.-U. G. C. 5 (1436). Hydrocele of the Tunica Vaginalis. Inside the original cavity is a large cyst which contained firm brown masses. (Haematocele ?) The testis appears healthy. Gen.-U. G. C. 6 (1437). Hydrocele of Tunica Vaginalis. The sac of a hydrocele carefully dissected out. Gen.-U. G. C. 7 (1438). Hydrocele of Tunica Vaginalis. A dis- section of the sac. The testis is retained in situ. Gen.-U. G. C. 8 (1438a.) Hydrocele of Tunica Vaginalis. The sac is dissected out with the testis left in situ. Gen.-U. G. C. 9 (1439). Hydrocele of Tunica Vaginalis. This specimen is remarkable on account of the presence of two distinct sacs, completely shut off from one another.

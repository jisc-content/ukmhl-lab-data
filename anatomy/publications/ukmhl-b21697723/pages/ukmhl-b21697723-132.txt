ANATOMY OF STUMPS. I 12 Os. L. a. 21 (657). A cast of the stump formed after Syme’s amputation through the ankle-joint. (Presented by Dr John Struthers.) Os. L. a. 22 (Y 72). A similar cast. Os. L. a. 23 (Y 73). A similar cast. Os. L. a. 24 (658). A cast of the stump after the mid-tarsal or Chopart’s amputation. Os. L. a. 25 (659). A similar cast. Os. L. a. 26 (Y 74). A similar cast. (Presented by Professor Annandale.) Os. L. a. 27 (661). The cast of a stump formed after the tarso- metatarsal or Key’s amputation. Os. L. a. 28 (663). A cast of the foot, shewing the results of an amputation of the second toe. Os. L. a. 29 (664). A similar cast. B. The Diseases of Sttnnps. Os. L. b. Os. L. b. 1 (645). A dissected preparation of a somewhat pointed or conical stump, following on an amputation of the thigh. The cut end of the femur projects at the apex of the stump, and a small nerve crosses immediately in front of the bone, between the latter and the skin. All the superficial nerves terminate at their cut ends in bulbous enlargements, which are incorporated with the cicatricial fibrous tissue over the extremity of the bone. Os. Li. b. 2 (654). A dissected preparation of a stump, following on an amputation through the lower part of the leg. There is a circular ulcer with raised edges on the face of the stump. The nerves on both aspects of the leg may be seen to terminate in bulbous ends, which are incorporated with the subcutaneous fibrous tissue close to the margin of the face of the stump. Os. L. b. 3 (662). The soft parts removed from a stump where a tarso-metatarsal or Key’s amputation had been performed. There is a large indolent ulcer over the face of the stump. (Pre- sented, with the two preceding specimens, by Professor Spence.) Os. L. b. 4 (648). A longitudinal section of the end of a femur, from a case in which an amputation had been performed through the thigh. There is a large amount of new bone formed beneath the periosteum on one aspect of the shaft. Os. L. b. 5 (A 74). The upper portion of the humerus of a man aged 48 (?), who died 21 days after suffering amputation through the middle of the arm for gunshot injury. The end of the bone is dead, and was found denuded of periosteum for two inches

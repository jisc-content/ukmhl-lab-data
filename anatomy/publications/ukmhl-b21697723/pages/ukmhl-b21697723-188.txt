168 ALIMENTARY SYSTEM. Al. D. a. 4 (737). Stomach shewing excoriation and ulceration ot mucous membrane, which is much corrugated. Discoloured patches are seen near the pyloric end, and at points along the greater curvature. Description given in old Catalogue, in which specimen is placed amongst Poisoning Series. The appearances are, however, more suggestive of cancer at cardiac orifice. Al. D. a. 5 (740). Stomach shewing a buffy colour and thickening over a great extent of the mucous membrane, which appears friable. Supposed due to poisoning. Al. D. a. 6 (741)- Stomach shewing rugose and mammillated condition of entire mucous membrane. Supposed due to poisoning. Cadaveric Softening (Post-mortem DigestionJ. Al. D. b. Al. D. b. 1 (824). Cadaveric Softening. Two large openings are seen ; the one nearer the pylorus is surrounded by a ring of cancerous tissue. With this is connected, by an elevated ridge, another nodule in an earlier stage of ulceration. The larger opening is probably the result of post-mortem digestion. Al. D. b. 2 (825). Cadaveric Softening. The gastric juice has digested the coat of the stomach to a considerable extent towards the cardiac end, leaving an irregular opening with ragged edges. Al. D. b. 3 (826). Cadaveric Softening, from a dog. The process of post-mortem digestion has separated the lower part of the stomach from the upper. The separated edge is ragged, and there are several perforations. Dilatation of the Stomach. Al. D. c. Al. D. c. 1 (824a). Dilatation of Stomach. An enormously dilated stomach, dried and stuffed with horse hair, from a man who had diabetes mellitus; see also Os. D. m. i, and N. A. e. 6; described by Dr D. J. Cunningham in Journat Anat. and Fhys.y Vol. XIII., p. 509. Presented by Professor Sir William Turner. Simple Gastric Ulcer, syn. “ Chronic^ ‘‘ Circtilarp or ''^Perforating'' Ulcer. Al. D. d. Al. D. d. 1 (814). Gastric Ulcer. Four healing ulcers; two of con- siderable size and somewhat circular outline are seen near the pylorus. In the floor of the largest the muscular coat is exposed. The cardiac orifice is very small, and the gastric

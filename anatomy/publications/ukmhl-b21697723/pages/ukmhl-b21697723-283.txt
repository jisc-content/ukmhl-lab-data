265 TUMOURS AND CYSTS. Gen.-U. A. W. iii. 4 (1277). Lympho-Sarcoma. Right kidney from a case described by Dr Laycock as being affected by “morbid growths of a lymphoid character in the right kidney and its fatty capsule, heart [Cir. C. d. 8 (2130^7)], and thyroid gland” [T. A. h. 10 (2647^)]. The kidney is enlarged, and contains — as does also the fatty tissue around it — a large number of somewhat spherical nodules of new growth, probably lympho-sarcomatous in nature. Presented by Professor Laycock. IV. Carcinomas. Gen.-U. A. w. iv. Gen.-U. A. W. iv. 1 (W 13). Carcinoma of Kidney, shewing irregular nodulation and infiltration of the kidney substance. The tumour is a malignant adenoma which has grown from a suprarenal “rest,” />., a piece of that gland included in the kidney substance during development, which has, later in life, taken on new growth, which, on microscopic examination, shews aberrant suprarenal structure. V. “ Cystic Degeneration ” of the Kidney. Gen.-U. A. w. v. Gen.-U. A. W. V. 1. Cystic Kidney. The organ is much enlarged, and shews an enormous number of cystic spaces, varying in size • from those just visible to the naked eye up to spaces about an inch in diameter. Presented by Dr Muirhead. Gen.-U. A. W. V. 2 (1319). Cystic Kidney—“General Cystic Degeneration.” Probably a “congenital” condition affecting both kidneys, the substances and surface of the organ shewing innumerable cystic spaces varying in size from those just visible to the naked eye up to spaces about an inch in diameter. Pre- sented by Professor Sanders. Gen.-U. A. w. V. 3 (13196. and c.) Cystic Kidney. Sections of both kidneys from a case of “General Cystic Degeneration” of the organs, probably a so-called “ congenital ” condition due to intermingling of the meso- and meta-nephros. Arteries injected red (in one specimen), veins blue. Presented by Pro- fessor Sanders, May 7, 1872. VI. Cysts other than the foregoing. Gen.-U. A. w. vi. Gen.-U. A. W. vi. 1. Kidney shewing a large number of minute cysts, mostly crowded together in the cortex immediately under the capsule. Probably due to blocking and distension of tubules. Gen.-U. A. W. vi. 2 (1313). Retention Cysts in Kidney. Specimen shewing several of these in the cortex, especially near the surface of the organ. They are due to blocking and distension of the secreting tubules, more rarely of the glomeruli.

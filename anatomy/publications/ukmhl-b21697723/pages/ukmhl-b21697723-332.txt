URINARY CALCULI. 314 Gen.-U. S. e. 2. Laminated Calculus; smooth externally, and slightly constricted. Weight, 727 grains. Nucleus, uric acid, around this a layer of oxalate of lime; the outer and greater part of the Calculus was uric acid. A little urate of ammonia and phosphate of lime. Gen.-U. S. e. 3. Section of an ovoid laminated Calculus; smooth on the outer surface. Uric acid, oxalate of lime, and uric acid. A little urate of ammonia also present. Gen.-U. S. e. 4. Numerous fragments of an oval laminated Calculus. Chiefly composed of uric acid and urate of ammonia, but with a thin layer of oxalate of lime two or three lines from the exterior. Small quantities of the urates of lime and mag- nesia, with phosphate of lime, were also found. Gen.-U. S. e. 5. A large, flattened, oval Calculus, laminated; smooth surface externally. Length, 2f inches; circumference, 8 inches; weight, 1680 grains. Nucleus, a urate, with fine laminae of oxalate of lime; the great mass being uric acid, with a trace of urate of lime. Gen.-U. S. e. 6. Section of a large Calculus. Nucleus, uric acid. Calculus, chiefly oxalate of lime. A thin layer of uric acid on surface. Gen.-U. S. e. 7. A small Calculus of the size of a pea, passed by the urethra, with pain. Uric acid, with a layer of oxalate of lime, and an external deposit of urate of ammonia. Q. D. d. 15 Old Catalogue. Nucleus Uric Acid or Urate of Am7no7tia invested by Oxalate of Lhrie attd Earthy Phosphates. Gen.-U. S. f. Gen.-U. S. f. 1. Large egg-shaped alternating Calculus. Length, 3J inches; breadth, 2J inches; circumference, 9J inches. Nucleus, uric acid, invested by thick deposit of oxalate of lime ; the exterior being a thick, finely laminated deposit of fusible phosphate. Traces of the carbonates of lime and magnesia are mixed with the phosphates. From the Bell Collection. Pre- sented by Dr G. Bell. Gen.-U. S. f. 2. Irregularly shaped Calculus, with a rough and broken exterior. Weight, 367 grains. Nucleus, uric acid, on which is a thick layer of oxalate of lime; the outer surface, phosphate of lime, with some urate of lime and magnesia.

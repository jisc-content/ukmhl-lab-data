120 NERVOUS SYSTEM. Cysts in connection with Memb7^anes of the Brain. N. A. e. N. A. e. 1 (1937)- A large flat Subdural Cyst, with calcified walls, is seen over the upper aspect of the left hemisphere. Probably the result of old pachymeningitis haemorrhagica interna. N. A. e. 2 (1938). A similar condition to the preceding specimen, but with thicker calcareous deposit. A portion of the left hemi- sphere is retained. The cyst probably results from pachymenin- gitis haemorrhagica interna. N. A. e. 3 (1939)- A small Serous Cyst between the layers of the dura mater in the frontal region of the superior longitudinal sinus. It has been filled with plaster of Paris. Dried pre- paration. N. A. e. 4 (1941)- Large Cyst from the Subdural Space. From a subject in the Dissecting-Room. Described by Professor Cossar Ewart in Joiir7i. Anat. and Phys. May 1875 Presented by Professor Sir William Turner. N. A e. 5 (1940). A Cyst, of which the delicate membranes are seen attached to the right side of the falx and adjacent dura mater. It was of the size of a gooseâ€™s egg, and projected into the right lateral ventricle. It was surrounded by gelatinous matter, and contained a serous fluid. The bones of the right side, especially the parietal, were very much thinned. Patient a man aged 20. N. A. e. 6 (1939a). Brain in which a large Sub-arachnoid Cyst has produced absorption of a great part of the right parietal lobe. Described by Dr D. J. Cunningham in Journ. Anat. and Phys. July 1879. The skeleton (case of Acromegaly with diabetes) is described under Os. D. m. i, and the stomach under Al. D. c. i. Presented by Professor Sir William Turner. N. A. e. 7. A Cyst from the subdural space, the contents of which consist of partially decolourised blood-clot. From a subject in the Dissecting-Room. Presented by Professor Sir William Turner. A rrested Development. N. A. f. N. A. f. 1. Cast of Anencephalus Foetus. The meninges are pro- longed in the form of a sac above the head. N. A. f. 2. An Anencephalous Foetus in which defective de- velopment is not confined to the head, but exists in the back as low down as the dorsal spine.

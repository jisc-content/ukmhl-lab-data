221 TEETH. Al. M. a. 12, Cast of the two Dentary Arcades of a scrofulous Idiot, shewing displacement and overlapping of the upper Incisors. AI. M. a. 13. Cast of the two Dentary Arcades of a patient suffering from Dementia, shewing displacement and overlapping of the upper central Incisors. Al. M. a. 14. Cast of the two Dentary Arcades, shewing dis- placement of the upper lateral Incisors and Canines. Al. M. a. 15. Cast of the two Dentary Arcades. The upper is pointed in front, and shews displacement of the central and lateral Incisors and left Canine. The palate is highly arched. The lower arcade is rounded in front. When the two arcades are placed together they do not come into apposition. Al. M. a. 16. Cast of Upper Dentary Arcade of a young man, with Mesial Palatal and right Alveolar Cleft. The cleft lies between the right central incisor and the canine. On the palatal side, and slightly posterior to the right canine, is a small conical tooth, which may perhaps represent the missing lateral incisor. The other teeth are well formed, but the wisdoms are not erupted. Presented by W. Bowman Macleod, Esq., L.D.S. Al. M. a. 17. Cast of Upper Dentary Arcade of boy, aged 5. Mesial Palatal and double Alveolar Cleft. In the inter- maxillary region the stumps of the two central incisors are present, but no trace of lateral incisors. On the left side are the milk canine and molars, and between the canine and the cleft is a precanine of the form of a normal lateral incisor. On the right side only the canine and milk molars are present. Presented by W. Bowman Macleod, Esq., L.D.S. Al. M. a. 18. Two Casts of the Upper Dentary Arcade of a boy aged 13, shewing Mesial Palatal and Double Alveolar Clefts. In A the position of the two incisor teeth in the premaxillae is seen. On the proximal side of each alveolar cleft a precanine tooth is situated between the cleft and the canine. The cast B was taken after the extraction of the incisors and the right precanine.

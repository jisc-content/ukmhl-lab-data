PREFACE. Vlll The section on Tumours was revised by Dr Lindsay Steven Milne, who likewise determined their microscopic structure. He also catalogued from preparations, mounted and provisionally arranged by Mr James Simpson, the Entozoa in the section on Parasites. In 1903 Sir William Turner presented the anatomical collection which he had formed during his tenure of the Chair of Anatomy. In 1908 the University Court purchased one half of the collection formed by Professor Annandale, the other half having been acquired for the Museum of the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh. The specimens from this collection belonging to the University have been described by Dr L. *C. Peel Ritchie. Owing to the sheets preceding the section on Diseases of the Skin having been printed off, only the specimens in and subsequent to that section could be included in this edition of the Catalogue. The specimens are arranged on the shelves of the Museum in strict accordance with the arrangement in the Catalogue. The other figures in brackets, which appear on a large number of the specimens, are the numbers in the manuscript catalogue prepared by Dr Cobbold. Sir William Turner has acted as general Editor of this Volume. The cost of preparing the Catalogue has in part been defrayed by a grant from the Carnegie Trustees. WM. TURNER, ) ^ V Conservators. D.

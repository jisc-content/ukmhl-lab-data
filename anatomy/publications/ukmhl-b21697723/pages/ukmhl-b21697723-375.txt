DISEASES OF THYROID GLAND. Thyr. Bronchocele. Thyr. a. Thyr. a. 1 (2647). Dissection shewing a large Bronchocele affecting the left lobe of the thyroid gland. The right lobe appears to be quite normal. Thyr. a. 2 (2647<2). Enlarged thyroid gland, which was removed during life by Professor Annandale in May 1874. The patient recovered from the operation. Thyr. a. 3 (26476). Enlarged thyroid gland m situ from a patient of Professor Laycock’s. From the same patient were removed a kidney and heart containing growths of a lymphoid structure corresponding to lympho-sarcoma. Vide specimens Gen.U. A. W. iii. 4, and Cir. C. D. 8. Thyr. a. 4. Goitre; symmetrical bilateral hypertrophy of thyroid gland, removed by operation. Annandale Collection. Thyr. a. 5. Enlarged thyroid gland, removed by operation. The tissue shews microscopically large spaces filled with colloid material with very little interfollicular connective tissue, a Colloid Goitre. Annandale Collection. Thyr. a. 6. Goitre; adenoma of right lobe removed by operation, a rounded encapsuled swelling with smooth surface. Original Goitre removed 33 years before. Female, cet. 54. March 5th, 1905. Annandale Collection. Thyr. a. 7. Enlarged thyroid gland removed by operation. The tissue shews microscopically small spaces filled with colloid material with very little interfollicular connective tissue. The most striking feature is the enormous engorgement of the capillary blood-vessels, the presence of haemorrhages and blood pigment. This accounts for the brownish-red appearance of the tumour. The condition is probably one of Exophthalmic Goitre. Annandale Collection. Thyr. a. 8. Cyst of thyroid gland of right lobe, with portion of thyroid tissue, removed by operation. The thyroid tissue shews microscopically considerable epithelial proliferation with little colloid formation—a Parenchymatous Goitre. The cyst is lined internally with similar tissue and externally by fibrous tissue. October loth, 1900. Annandale Collection.

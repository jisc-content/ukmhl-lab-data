ALIMENTARY SYSTEM. 170 Follimlar Ulceration. Al. D. e. Al. D. e. 1 {823). Follicular Ulcers of Stomach—“ Haemorrhagic Erosions.” The mucous membrane near its lesser curvature shews numerous small haemorrhages into its substance, at which points there is superficial ulceration or erosion. Towards the greater curvature there appear cicatrices of previous ulcers. The mucous membrane is much atrophied and wrinkled. Ulcers due to Infiltration of the Coats of the Stomach with New Growth other than Cancer. Al. D. f. Al. D. f. 1 (819). Gastric Ulcer, probably due to new growth. A large jagged opening is seen near the pylorus. There is great thickening around the ulcer and irregular erosion. Al. D. f. 2 (819a). Gastric Ulcer, probably due to adenoma. An everted stomach, which displays two large patches of ulceration on its mucous surface. The larger one, oval in form and irregular on its surface, presents at one point an oval perforation. Both ulcers possess well - defined raised margins. Al. D. f. 3 (8196). Duodenal Ulcer. Portion of the duo- denum of the same person, displaying a deep ulcer on its mucous surface. On the serous surface a well-defined oval cicatrix is visible. Presented by Professor Laycock. From a patient in the Royal Infirmary. March 10, 1865. AL D. f. 4 (822). Gastric Ulcer, probably due to new growth at the pyloric end of the stomach, which is much contracted. The mucous membrane is greatly thickened, especially around the perforation. Al. D. f. 5 (822a). Gastric Ulcer, probably from new growth. Pyloric end of stomach of a subject from the Dissecting-Room. The mucous membrane exhibits a honeycombed, ulcerated appearance. Presented by Professor Sir William Turner. Al. D. f. 6 (8236). Portion of stomach with infiltration of mucous membrane and minute follicular ulceration. See Al. E. f. 12 and 13. From a case of Professor Sanders’, June 1871. Al. D. f. 7. Ulcer of Stomach, from a case of Congenital Syphilis. Stomach laid open from behind, shewing an irregular elongated area of ulceration, extending from near the cardiac orifice along the lesser curvature. There is enlargement of the glands around the lower end of the oesophagus, and much thickening and infiltration along the lesser curvature and in the floor of the ulcer. Patient, a girl aged 19, suffered from congenital syphilis.

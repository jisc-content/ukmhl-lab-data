267 TUMOURS. Gen.-U. A. W. vii. 3. Tumour of Kidney. A mixed tumour, probably due to intermingling of the tissues during embryonic life. The upper part of the organ is occupied by an irregularly rounded mass divided up by dense fibrous septa, which enclose areas of new growth, which are at some parts soft and haemor- rhagic and at other parts composed of cartilage. In some parts there are cystic adenomatous spaces, while here and there can be seen small yellow masses of aberrant suprarenal gland tissue. Presented by Professor Greenfield, 1905. VIII. Teratomas.

Kidney shewing great dilatation of the pelvis, and infundibula, producing somewhat globular projections on the surface of the organ, somewhat resembling the condition of foetal lobulation; the substance of the kidney is much atrophied owing to the pressure of the retained secretion and the progressive loss of function. Gen.-U. B. C. 2 (1235). Hydronephrosis. The pelvis of the kidney is considerably dilated, the upper part of the ureter being blocked by the impaction of two calculi which are seen in situ; a calculus is also lodged in one of the upper calyces. The surface of the organ is very soft and rough, being covered ap- parently by fibrinous lymph, the result of some inflammatory condition, perhaps perinephritic abscess. The renal artery is very much thickened. Gen.-U. B. C. 3 (1234). Hydronephrosis—slight; the pelvis and infundibula are somewhat dilated and contain several small calculi. Gen.-U. B. C. 4 (1236). Hydronephrosis and Atrophy of the Kidney, due to impaction of renal calculus. The organ is small and irregular, the pelvis and infundibula being dilated into a series of sacculi in some of which calculi are still left in situ. S

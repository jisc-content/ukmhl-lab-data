242 TUBERCULOSIS. R. C. g. 6 (2398). Chronic Phthisis shewing formation of very numerous smooth walled cavities communicating with the Bronchi; probably partly bronchiectatic. Piece of whale-bone at lower part inserted into branch of pulmonary artery, which had burst into a cavity. Professor Alison’s case. R. C. g. 7 (2343). Chronic Phthisis; several cavities near the apex and a perforation lower down. Great thickening of pleura. R. C. g. 8 (2376). Half of left Lung. Upper lobe shews some- what Chronic Phthisis with great thickening of Pleura and extensive breaking down, so as to form a large cavity. Im- mediately below is an irregular perforation into pleural cavity, into which air passed through left bronchus. The lower lobe shews tubercular broncho-pneumonic infiltration. R. C. g. 9 (2377)- Chronic Phthisis, Lung injected. Large irregular cavity and smaller sinuous cavities occupying upper lobe, evidently of slow formation and partly bronchiectatic. Lower lobe shews scattered whitish nodules with greyish centre, for most part in clusters into which injection has not penetrated. Enlarged bronchial glands. See Fig. 459, Professor Hughes Bennett’s Clinical Lectures on Medicine^ 1868. R. 0. g. 10 (2378). Opposite half of same Lung, injected. Shews well the projecting ridges and bands in vomica corresponding to obliterated vessels and bronchi. R. C. g. 11 (2382a). Very Chronic Phthisis, Lung injected. Lung extremely shrunken, shewing several large irregular cavities with smooth fibrous lining. Extreme fibrous thickening and adhesion of pleura over upper part of lung. Professor Alison’s case. R. 0. g. 12 (2384). Upper lobe of right Lung. Chronic Phthisis with extensive excavations and great thickening of adherent pleura. R. 0. g. 13 (2388). Chronic Phthisis, large smooth walled cavity the size of an orange in upper lobe, which has perforated pleura. Old and recent pleurisy. R. C. g. 14 (2400). Portion of Lung shewing a large vomica with a smooth lining membrane. Slight puckering and adhesions on pleural surface. R. C. g. 15 (2402). Chronic Phthisis with thickened pleura, shewing formation of cavities, and extensive grey and caseous infiltration of lung tissue. R. 0. g. 16 (2403). Chronic Phthisis shewing large cavity lined with caseous material. Pleura greatly thickened. R. O. g. 17 (2411). Portions of Lung shewing Grey Hepatisation. Old tubercular cavity in the apex covered by thickened pleura.

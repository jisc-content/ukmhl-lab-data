URINARY CALCULI. 30 Gen.-U. S. a. 26. Ovoid, slightly compressed laminated Calculus. Weight, 742 grains. Minute trace of phosphate of lime. Gen.-U. S. a. 27. Rounded Calculus, laminated, of a pale earthy colour. Weight, 461 grains. Minute ash of phosphate of lime. Gen.-U. S. a. 28. Two flattened Calculi, laminated; external surface smooth. Gen.-U. S. a. 29. Three small laminated Calculi; sides flattened, probably through mutual rubbing. Gen.-U. S. a. 30. Irregularly shaped Calculus; nucleus excentric, laminae not running in regular concentric lines. Gen.-U. S. a. 31. Fragments of a small oval laminated Calculus. Gen.-U. S. a. 32. Trilateral laminated Calculus; outer surface slightly tuberculated. Length, if inch; weight, 491 grains. Minute ash of lime. Gen.-U. S. a. 33. Section of triangular-shaped Calculus, flattened on one side, laminated, the laminae projecting more on the convex side; surface smooth externally. Weight, 526 grains. Minute ash containing phosphate of lime, with a trace of urate of lime. Gen.-U. S. a. 34. Small oval laminated Calculus. Weight, 92 grains. Minute ash, with almost imperceptible trace of phos- phate and of urate of lime. Gen.-U. S. a. 35. Part of one lateral section of an oval laminated Calculus. Gen.-U. S. a. 36. Elongated, partly flattened laminated Calculus. 'I'he outer surface is partly smooth, and in part looks as if it had been acted upon by some fluid, which had removed the most external portion. A tuberculated surface is thus exposed, concentric lines extending around the tubercles. Weight, 457 grains. Minute ash of phosphate of lime and urate of potash. Gen.-U. S. a. 37. Small, ovoid, imperfectly laminated Calculus; nucleus excentric, situated at one extremity of the Calculus. Minute ash of Iron, phosphate of lime, and urate of lime. Gen.-U. S. a. 38. Section of an oval laminated Calculus; outer laminae much more compact than the inner ; external surface nearly smooth. Gen.-U. S. a. 39. Small, oval, flattened laminated Calculus. Minute ash of phosphate and urate of lime. Presented by Professor Goodsir. Gen.-U. S. a. 40. Fragments of a compact laminated Calculus. Minute ash of phosphate of lime.

TUMOURS. 291 [No specimens.] Gen.-U. N. i. 12 (1820). Malignant Disease of Uterus and sur- rounding parts. There is very extensive cancerous infiltration and ulceration, which has destroyed the cervix and greater part of the body of the uterus, especially posteriorly, where its cavity directly communicates with that of the abdomen. There is also extensive invasion of the vaginal walls. Gen.-U. N. i. 13 (1821). Malignant Disease of Uterus. The cervix is completely destroyed, and the disease has also spread to the vagina and bladder and has produced a fistulous com- munication between them. Gen.-U. N. i. 14 (1822). Malignant Disease of Uterus, Vagina, and Rectum. A large fungating and ulcerating mass of new growth, continuous with the uterine cancer, is seen projecting into the rectum. Gen.-U. N. i. 15 (1823). Malignant Disease of Uterus. The disease has spread from the cervix and has produced free com- munication between the cavities of the uterus, vagina, rectum, bladder, and abdomen. Gen.-U. N. i. 16 (1824). Malignant Disease of Uterus and Vagina. Injected specimen. The new growth has also invaded the walls of the bladder and produced a vesico-vaginal fistula. Gen.-U. N. i. 17 (1825). Malignant Disease of Uterus, Vagina, Rectum, and Bladder. A soft fungating mass is seen growing from the fundus of the bladder which communicates with the uterus and rectum. The latter presents a series of fistulous openings which communicate with a large sinus-like cavity, which in turn opens by a narrow mouth into the upper part of the vagina. Gen.-U. N. i. 18 (18256). Malignant Disease of Uterus. The cervix is completely destroyed, and the cavity of the uterus is enlarged and ulcerated. There is a transverse linear rupture of the anterior wall of the organ.

URINARY CALCULI. 3II Gen.-U. S. C. 21. Large oval Calculus. Weight, 811 grains. Mostly uric acid, with a layer of earthy phosphates on the surface. Gen.-U. S. c. 22. Small, irregular, somewhat hour-glass shaped Calculus. Weight, 65 grains. The interior consists of uric acid, with traces of urates of lime, magnesia, and ammonia. A layer of fusible phosphate externally. Gen.-U. S. C. 23. Section of an elongated urinary Calculus. Nucleus, uric acid and urate of ammonia, with fusible phos- phate, and traces of the carbonates of lime and magnesia on surface. Gen.-U. S. C. 24. Large heart-shaped Calculus, ij inch in breadth, and rough externally. Uric acid and urate of ammonia, mixed with a considerable quantity of phosphate of lime, and traces of carbonate and oxalate of lime. Gen.-U. S. c. 25. Roundish, flattened Calculus; white and smooth externally. Weight, 230 grains. Uric acid and urate of ammonia, with phosphate of lime, and small quantities of urate of lime and magnesia. Gen.-U. S. C. 26. Very small white Calculus, with a smooth, porcelain-like exterior. Weight, 6 grains. Uric acid and urate of lime, with earthy phosphate. Gen.-U. S. C. 27. A large, smoothly laminated Calculus, with a nearly smooth exterior. Uric acid and urate of ammonia, with a trace of urate of lime. Fusible phosphate, in considerable quantity, alternating in the outer part of the Calculus with layers of the uric acid. Gen.-U. S. C. 28. Large egg-shaped Calculus, of a pale, white- brown colour externally, and loosely laminated appearance internally. Weight, 1180 grains. Chiefly uric acid, with about 5 per cent, of phosphate of lime. Gen.-U. S. C. 29. Oval laminated Calculus; white and smooth externally. Weight, 249 grains. Uric acid, and the urates of ammonia and lime. Phosphate of lime. Gen.-U. S. C. 30. Elongated oval Calculus, laminated. Weight, 270 grains. Chiefly uric acid and some urate of ammonia. About 25 per cent, of phosphate and urate of lime. Gen.-U. S. C. 31. Irregularly rounded and flattened Calculus, laminated; outer surface smooth. Weight, 252 grains. Uric acid, trace of urate of ammonia, with urate of lime and phosphate of lime.

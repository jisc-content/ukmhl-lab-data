PLEURA. 234 R. B. b. 6 (2349). of lower lobe of the right lung of a child. Effusion of recent lymph on the pulmonary pleura. R. B. b. 7 (2347). Portion of Diaphragm and Pleura covering it, shewing a thick layer of inflammatory lymph, which formed a portion of the parietes of an abscess that contained two lbs. of pus. R. B. b. 8 (2346). Total Collapse of right Lung following Pleurisy. Lung covered on outer surface with smooth firm layer of lymph. R. B. b. 9 (2359). Collapsed Lung and thickened Pleura from a case of Empyema. R. B. b. 10 (2350). Total Collapse of left Lung, with recent lymph on Pleural surface, and deep pigmentation of lung substance. R. B. b. 11 (2362). Adhesion and thickening of the pulmonary and costal Pleurae. Lung very dense and pigmented. R. B. b. 12 (2339). Thoracic parietes and left Lung shewing old Empyema with caseous contents and calcareous plate - like masses formed on the inner surface of the sac. The lung substance is condensed. R. B. b. 13 (2352). Portions of the Lung of a child in which the pulmonary pleura is thickened. The lung substance is con- densed and pale, and with minute apparently tubercular cavities. R. B. b. 14 (2354). Portion of Pleura and Diaphragm from case of Empyema, the former greatly thickened and attached to the Lung, the substance of which is tubercular and collapsed. R. B. b. 15 (2355). Pneumothorax—Portion of Lung from case of Empyema ; Pleura is greatly thickened and ragged; the Lung is collapsed. A communication exists between the pleural cavity and a large bronchus, into which a bristle is passed. Caseous tubercular nodules in Lung, one of which had probably softened. R. B. b. 16 (2338). Pneumothorax—Portion of left Lung shew- ing great thickening of pulmonic and adjoining costal pleura, which are separated in places by cavities containing pus. The lung substance is condensed, tubercular, and hollowed into cavities, one of which communicates with one of the pus- containing cavities of the pleural sac. R. B. b. 17 (2345). Pneumothorax—Right Lung much collapsed, with recent lymph on the pleural surface. About an inch from dorsal border of lung is an opening through which air had escaped into the pleural cavity, which also contained twenty- two ounces of a sero-purulent fluid. R. B. b. 18 (2341). Pneumothorax and Empyema. A large irregular cavity in the substance of the lung which communicates by an oblique fissure with an abscess in the pleural cavity.

Gen.-U. l. d. Gen.-U. I. d. 1 (1339)- Enlarged Prostate, accompanied by ulceration of the prostatic portion of the urethra. Gen.-U. I. d. 2 (1365). Enlarged Prostate. The bladder is dilated owing to the enlargement of the lateral lobes of the prostate. Gen.-U. I. d. 3 (1366). Enlarged Prostate. The obstruction caused retention of urine, which was followed by rupture of the coats of the bladder near the urachus. The torn cellular tissue between the peritoneum and the anterior part of the bladder was gangrenous and infiltrated with foetid matter. Gen.-U. I. d. 4 (1367). Enlarged Prostate. Section of the lower part of the bladder shewing the hypertrophy of the muscular coat. Gen.-U. I. d. 5 (1369). Enlarged Prostate. All the lobes of the prostate, especially the lateral, are greatly enlarged. The bladder does not appear to be hypertrophied. Gen.-U. I. d. 6 (1372). Enlarged Prostate. The third lobe is more particularly affected. Gen.-U. I. d. 7 (1373)- Enlarged Prostate. The gland has been dissected out from the surrounding tissues. Gen.-U. I. d. 8 (1374). Enlarged Prostate. The prostatic urethra is partly closed by the enlargement, which particularly affects the middle lobe. A false passage has apparently been formed by attempts at catheterisation. T

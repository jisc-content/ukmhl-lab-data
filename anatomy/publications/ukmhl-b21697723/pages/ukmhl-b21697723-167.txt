ENDOCARDITIS. 147 Cir. F. e. 2 (2097)- Endocarditis, chronic and acute, with some ulceration of the aortic valve; aortic incompetence; hyper- trophy of the left ventricle. Cir. F. e. 3 (2110). Chronic endocarditis of aortic valve, with great fibrous thickening and shrinking, and calcification and adhesion of two segments. Cir. F. e. 4 (2108). Endocarditis, effects of Part of base of left ventricle with aortic valve, shewing fusion of two of the segments, probably due to endocarditis, thickening and con- traction of the valve; also aorta atheromatous. Cir. F. e. 5 (2098a). Chronic endocarditis, with adhesions between two of the segments of the aortic valve and calcification. Presented by Professor Laycock. Cir. F. e. 6 (2109). Chronic endocarditis of aortic valve, with vegetations, ulceration, and calcification. Cir. F. e. 7 (2077). Extreme aortic stenosis, with calcification of the valve; hypertrophy and dilatation of the left ventricle. Cir. F. e. 8 (2083). Heart shewing extreme stenosis and calci- fication of aortic orifice from chronic endocarditis, leaving only a narrow triangular aperture ; great hypertrophy of left ventricle. Cir. F. e. 9 (2106). Great stenosis of aortic valve, with adhesion and thickening of the segments, forming a funnel-shaped orifice. Cir. F. e. 10 (2111). Chronic endocarditis of aortic valve; advanced atheroma of the aorta, which has been turned inside out to shew atheroma and calcification of its first part. Cir. F. e. 11. Two segments of aortic valve, one shewing calcifica- tion, the other perforation. Dried preparation. Cir. F. e. 12 (2112). Chronic degeneration of one of the segments of the aortic valve, with dilatation of the sinus of Valsalva. Cir. F. e. 13 (2115). General fibroid thickening and partial calcification, with retraction of the aortic valve segments. Cir. F. e. 14 (2113). The commencement of the aorta of an ox, exhibiting slight calcification at the free margin of the semilunar valve. Diseases affecting the Tricuspid and Ptilmonary Valves. Cir. F. f. Cir. F. f. 1. Endocarditis of tricuspid valve and wall of right ventricle. On the wall of the ventricle near the valve are seen numerous vegetations covered with coagulum. A mass of fibrin the size of a small walnut is attached to the chordae tendineae, and projects freely into the ventricle. Presented by Professor Grainger Stewart. K

KIDNEY. 254 III. Thrombosis. Gen.-U. A. g. [See specimens Gen.-U. A. m. lo; Gen.-U. A. w. iii. 2.] IV. Embolism and Infarction. Gen.-U. A. h. Gen.-U. A. h; 1. Old Infarction (?) which has become surrounded by a fibrous tissue capsule. Absorption of the necrosed tissue has been very imperfect, it presents a caseous appearance and has undergone partial calcification. The capsule of the kidney is thickened and adherent, and the infarction occupies a large area on the surface of the organ. Gen.-U. A. h. 2. (W. 6). Old Infarction (?) which has under- gone necrosis, has become caseous and partially calcified, and is surrounded by a fibrous tissue capsule. Gen.-U. A. h. 3. Infarction of Kidney. From a man, aged 50, with extreme mitral stenosis, and dilatation and thrombosis of the left auricle. The surface is somewhat irregular, there are numerous minute cortical cysts, and the stellate veins are congested. The greater part of the organ is occupied by a large infarct of a somewhat greenish colour. On sectio?i, this infarct is well seen, together with several smaller infarcted areas, around which there is intense congestion and some haemorrhage. Presented by Professor Greenfield, 1905.

The organ is pale and firm, and its capsule somewhat thickened and adherent. Microscopically.â€”Moderately advanced waxy change, and considerable degeneration of the tubular epithelium. Appended is a small portion of waxy liver from the same case.

CIRCULATORY SYSTEM. 156 Aneurism of Abdominal Aorta. Cir. G. f. Cir. G. f. 1 (2231). Aneurism of commencement of abdominal aorta the size of a foetal head. The sac of the aneurism is completely filled with firm laminated coagulum. Cir. G. f. 2 (2242a). Aneurism at the root of the superior mesen- teric artery shewing on section the lamination of the clot. Pre- sented by Frederick Pauli, M.R.C.S. Cir. G. f. 3 (2229). Thoracic and abdominal aneurisms. The thoracic aneurism involved the descending aorta, is of large size, bulged chiefly to the left side, and had eroded the fifth and eighth dorsal vertebrae, and caused compression of the cord. The abdominal involved the origin of the superior mesenteric artery, and is filled with laminated clot. Described by Pro- fessor Hughes Bennett in Monthly Jour, of Med. Science^ July 1852. Cir. G. f. 4. Aneurism of the abdominal aorta, the size of an orange, involving right renal artery and partially compressing the corresponding vein. Cir. G. f. 5 (2239). Double aneurism of the abdominal aorta; the upper aneurism involves the origin of the superior mesenteric and renal arteries; the lower is just below the origin of the inferior mesenteric. Presented by Professor Grainger Stewart. From the same case as Al. E. f. 6 and 7. Cir. G. f. 6 (2232). Large aneurism of abdominal aorta, shewing laminated clot. Cir. G. f. 7 (2233). Aneurism of abdominal aorta, eroding vertebrae. It had burst into the left pleural cavity through an opening on its diaphragmatic surface. The arch and descending thoracic aorta were atheromatous and calcareous. Cir. G. f. 8 (2236). Aneurism of abdominal aorta three inches above the bifurcation, laid open to shew laminated clot; anteriorly the aneurism is constricted, forming a separate smaller sac, from the centre of which the superior mesenteric artery springs. Cir. G. f. 9 (2237). Aneurism involving the bifurcation of the abdominal aorta; paiietes of sac much thickened. Aorta obstructed by a thrombus two inches above the aneurism. Cir. G. f. 10 (2238). Aneurism of abdominal aorta involving bifurcation; the aneurism has opened into the inferior cava, and eroded partially the body of one of the lumbar vertebrae. Dried specimen.

119 INFLAMMATION. Amte Ififlammation. N. A. c. N. A. C. 1 (1928). Basal Meningitis (probably Tubercular).

A. d. N. A. d. 1 (1929). Chronic Thickening of the Meninges. The arachnoid and pia mater over the upper part of the right hemisphere are thickened, and adhere to the subjacent cortex. The dura mater is also adherent to the arachnoid and pia mater. Patient, cet. 50, subject to epilepsy. N. A. d. 2 (1930). Ossification or Calcification of the Cerebral Membranes. On each side of the falx cerebri are bone-like spicules in the dura mater. N. A. d. 3 (1932). Calcareous deposits in the cerebral membranes. A similar condition to the preceding. Case of mania. Specimen has been dried and preserved in turpentine. N. A. d. 4 (1931). Fibrous thickening of the Dura Mater. The thickening is most marked near the superior longitudinal sinus. From a case of mania. N. A. d. 5 (1933). Calcareous Deposits in the Cerebral Membranes. Spicules are seen in the dura mater on each side of the superior longitudinal sinus. From a case of mania. Dried preparation. N. A. d. 6 (1934). Calcareous Deposits in the Cerebral Mem- branes. The inner surface of the dura mater shews extensive plate-like deposits of calcareous matter. Dried preparation. N. A. d. 7 (1935)- Ossification of the Cerebral Membranes. Three plate-like masses of bone adhere to the falx cerebri. No symptoms. N. A. d. 8 (1936). Ossification of the Cerebral Membranes. A plate of bone adheres to the outer surface of the dura mater. No symptoms. N. A. d. 9 (1938a). Ossification in the Cerebral Membranes. Falx cerebri (of the late Professor Alison), replaced at one point by a thick plate of bone. Presented by Dr Rutherford Haldane. Case described by Dr Newbigging in Edin. Med. Journ.^ p. 676, 1859. N. A. d. 10. The cranial dura mater from a man aged 62, who had suffered for many years from chronic mania with epilepsy, and who died of cerebral haemorrhage. Scattered over the cerebral aspect of the dura mater are numerous minute masses of calcar eous material. Presented by Dr Kidd, Assistant Medical officer Cane Hill Asylum, Surrey, through Dr H.

41 SYPHILITIC DISEASES OF BONE. Os, D. e. 37 (248). The tibia and fibula of an adult; the former presents several nodular thickenings on its internal or sub- cutaneous surface, consisting of smooth compact bone. Os. D. e. 38 (249). A tibia, shewing a diffuse spongy crust of new bone, here and there heaped up in a nodular fashion. Os. D. e. 39 (255). A tibia, shewing massive nodular thickenings of its shaft. The superior articular surface is distorted and ulcerated from disease of the knee-joint. Os. D. e. 40 (258). A portion of the shaft of a tibia, uniformly thickened by a periosteal deposit of bone, shewing for the most part a longitudinally laminated arrangement of its structure. Os. D. e. 41 (265). A similar specimen. Os. D. e. 42 (271). A similar specimen. Os. D. e. 43 (260). A tibia, in which the shaft is thickened and sclerosed. Os. D. e. 44 (261). A tibia, shewing a large fusiform thickening occupying the greater part of the internal or subcutaneous sur- face of the shaft. The thickened area consists of compact bone, minutely perforated by vascular openings on its periosteal aspect. Os. D. e. 45 (264). A tibia, in which the internal surface of the shaft is nodularly thickened, and there is further a spongy crust of new bone on its interosseous aspect. • Os. D. e. 46 (268). A tibia, thickened and sclerosed along the inner aspect of its shaft. Os. D. e. 47 (270). Enlargement and sclerosis of the lower two- thirds of the shaft of a tibia. Os, D. e. 48 (279). The shaft of a fibula, shewing a thin spongy crust of new bone on its periosteal surface. Os. D. e. 49 (281). A similar specimen. Syphilitic Lesions which have led to Destruction of Bone— Caries and Necrosis. Os. D. e, 50 (222). The Femur of an adult, which is much increased in girth throughout the entire length of the shaft; externally it is covered by irregularly tuberculated new bone, which in several places is heaped up around superficial sequestra of the original compact tissue ; some of the latter are to be seen i?i situ. The sawn section of the shaft exhibits the sclerosis and increase in the amount of bone, the medullary canal being almost ol)literated.

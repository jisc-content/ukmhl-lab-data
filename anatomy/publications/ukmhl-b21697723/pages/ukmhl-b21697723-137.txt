An irregular opening is seen in the dura mater, and a deposit of lymph on its external surface, near the superior longitudinal sinus; the result of fracture of the skull. From a child 4 years of age. N. A. a. 2 (1922). Injury to Cerebral Membranes. Coagulum, two ounces in weight, from beneath the dura mater at the back part of the parietal bones. Patient, a lad of 15, received a blow on the head from a stone. No fracture of the skull or wound of the scalp. N. A. a. 3 (1922a). Injury to Cerebral Membranes. On the outer surface of the dura mater is a deeply-coloured clot. Old haemorrhages, apparently in the substance of the dura mater, are seen along the superior longitudinal sinus. N. A. a. 4 (1923 a). Injury to Cerebral Membranes. The upper part of the dura mater exhibits a large diffused coagulum on its external surface, in the neighbourhood of the superior longi- tudinal sinus. N. A. a. 5 (19236). Injury to Cerebral Membranes. Upper part of the dura mater, exhibiting a scattered coagulum on its inner aspect. N. A. a. 6 (1947)- Injury of Brain. K punctured wound of the cranial vault is seen, for which trephining was successfully em- ployed, the external wound being partly cicatrized. An abscess subsequently formed deep in the substance of the brain. N. A. a. 7 (1949). Injury of Brain.

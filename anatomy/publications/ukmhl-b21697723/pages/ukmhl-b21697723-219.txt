99 INTESTINAL CONCRETIONS. ends is concave. Another of the concretions is scaphoidal, and its convex surface fits the concavity in the large specimen. The smallest of the three tapers, and has a convex surface which fits into the concavity in the scaphoidal one. These concretions were found in the beginning of the transverse part of the colon of a boy, cut, 12. (See Edin. Med. and Surg. Journ..^ No. 84, p. 84). Al. I. a. 17. The halves of an Intestinal Concretion of a tuberous appearance. The cut surface is laminated, and the exterior is partly coated with lime salts. Al. I. a. 18. The half of an Intestinal Concretion. Externally it is tuber-like, and internally has a finely concentrically laminated appearance. Al. I. a. 19. Half of an Intestinal Concretion. The exterior is tuberous. Interior shews a concentric laminated appearance, more particularly towards the periphery. Al. I. a. 20. An Intestinal Concretion unequally bisected. In- ternally it is concentrically laminated, and the surface has the feel of fine felt. Al. I. a. 21. Half of an Intestinal Concretion of a felt-like consistence, and with faint concentric lamination. Al. I. a. 22. Half of an Intestinal Concretion. Externally it has a worm-eaten appearance, and internally it exhibits concentric laminae. Al. I. a. 23. The halves of a tuberous-like Intestinal Concretion, hollow in the centre, as if the nucleus had been removed, and concentrically laminated. Al. I. a. 24. Half of a tuberous Intestinal Concretion. Al. I. a. 25. Half of a tuberous Intestinal Concretion of a felt- like consistence, and shewing concentric lamellae. Al. I. a. 26. Two irregularly-shaped portions of an Intestinal Concretion of felt-like consistence. Al. I. a. 27. Half of a reniform Intestinal Concretion. The cut surface shews concentric laminae and a felt-like appearance. Externally it is coated with lime salts. Al. I. a. 28. Portion of an Intestinal Concretion concentrically laminated. Al. I. a. 29. A small Intestinal Concretion, and three pieces of another one. Al. I. a. 30. Five small irregularly-shaped Intestinal Concretions. Al. I. a. 31. Half of an Intestinal Concretion, laminated on section and coated on surface with lime salts.

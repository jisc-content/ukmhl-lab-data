URINARY CALCULI. 302 Gen.-U. S. a. 41. Two fragments of a Calculus, apparently the outer laminae. Minute ash of phosphate and urate lime. Gen.-U. S. a. 42. A roundish, slightly compressed, closely laminated Calculus, many of the exterior laminae broken off. Weight, 278 grains. Minute ash of phosphate and urate of lime. Gen.-U. S. a. 43. Numerous fragments of a Calculus, probably all belonging to the same stone. The nucleus is distinctly seen in one portion. Q. D. d. 48. 9 Old Catalogue. Gen.-U. kS. a. 44. Two halves of a Calculus, removed by lateral operation. Surface nodulated, shape oval, colour brown. Weight, 14 ounces; specific gravity, 1*63; dimensions, 3-7 inches in length, 3 inches in breadth, and 2*3 inches in thickness. Pure uric acid, no appreciable ash. In structure it is extremely compact, and the laminae throughout the greatest part of its extent are closely packed together. Q. D. d. 46 Old Catalogue. Gen.-U. S. a. 45, Four rounded and flattened Calculi of nearly uniform size; only one examined. Laminated internally and smooth externally. Analysed by Dr Wilson. Uric acid and urate of lime. Gen-.U. S. a. 46. The two halves of a Calculus and one-half of another Calculus, smooth and rounded externally; one ex- tremity is concave. The Calculi are pale and present a waxy lustre; laminated on section. Uric acid. Gen.-U. S. a. 47. Sections of three Calculi, one reniform in shape, the others rather ovoidal in form. Uric acid, the kidney- shaped Calculus left a minute ash of phosphate and urate of lime. Gen.-U. S. a. 48. Numerous fragments of a Calculus of a smooth glistening appearance externally. Uric acid, with traces of phosphate and oxalate of lime. Gen.-U. S. a. 49. Portion of a small Calculus, imperfectly laminated in its texture. Minute ash of phosphate and urate of lime and urate of soda. Q. D. d. 45. 2 Old Catalogue. Gen.-U. S. a. 50. Section of a Calculus, the laminae of which formed a hard and compact mass, though the surface is irregular. Uric acid, with the urates of lime, soda, and magnesia. Gen.-U. S. a. 51, Large elongated Calculus. Weight, 1360 grains. The nucleus, formed by a small angular renal Calculus, is excentric, and consists of uric acid and urate of lime. The bulk of the Calculus is arranged in lamellae, irregularly placed. Uric acid, with a minute trace of urate of ammonia.

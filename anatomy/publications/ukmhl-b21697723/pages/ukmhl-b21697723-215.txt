195 , MESENTERIC GLANDS. Al. F. C. 6. Cancerous Peritonitis, Transverse colon, with omen- tum attached. The latter shews irregular thickening, small nodules of new growth, and shaggy, partially organised, fibrous adhesions. Attached to the wall of the colon are rounded tumour nodules. Microscopically, scirrhus cancer. Al. F. C. 7 (985). Malignant Disease. A tumour communicating with the intestines, which were matted together and ulcerated. The patient had a swelling in the right iliac region, which burst, and faeces were discharged through the opening. Probably a cancerous tumour, starting in the walls of the gall-bladder, and infiltrating the liver and intestine. Professor Alison’s case. Al. F. c. 8 (899). Colloid Cancer. The diaphragm exhibits exten- sive infiltration by a new growth of colloid appearance. The wall of the small intestine is also markedly affected; the pleura to a less extent. Al. F. C. 9 (990). Colloid Cancer of the Peritoneum. A portion of large intestine is seen, surrounded by masses of colloid cancer. Al. F. C. 10. Colloid Cancer of the Peritoneum. A small portion of the small intestine is seen passing through a thick mass of cancerous infiltration of the peritoneum, to which it is intimately adherent. Presented by Professor Hughes Bennett. Diseases of Mesenteric Glands. Al. F. d. Al. F. d. 1 (25696). Lymphoma of Mesenteric Glands. Part of a very large and somewhat lobulated “ lymphoid ” tumour of the mesenteric glands. No history. Al. F. d. 2 (2650). Tumours of Mesenteric Glands. Section of greatly enlarged mass of mesenteric glands, probably lympha- denomatous (described as Medullary Sarcoma in MS. Catalogue). Al. F. d. 3 (893). Malignant Disease of Mesenteric Glands (probably Lympho-sarcoma). The centre of the gland is softened and broken down. A part of the diaphragm appended shews multiple nodulated new growths of various size. The peritoneum and mesenteric glands were similarly affected. From a patient aged 24. Al. F. d. 4 (894). Tuberculosis of Mesenteric Glands. The mesenteric glands are enlarged and caseous. There appears to be tubercular infiltration of the walls of the transverse colon, and in the omentum minute tubercles are seen alongside the small vessels. Doubly-injected specimen. Al. F. d. 5 (890). Tuberculosis of Mesenteric Glands. Portion of mesentery, with numerous enlarged glands, some of which have undergone caseation and softening. From a girl aged 15, who died of tubercular phthisis. N

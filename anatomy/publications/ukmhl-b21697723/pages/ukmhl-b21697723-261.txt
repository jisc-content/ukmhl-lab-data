TUBERCULOSIS. 241 R. 0. f. 12 (L. 5). Lung shewing atrophy with great thickening of pleura; there is apparently an extensive interstitial pneumonia and some recent tubercle. R. 0. f. 13 (24o8flf). Left Lung of a Monkey, the upper lobe hollowed to a large vomica, the lower is also tubercular. See spleen 1178^. R. C. f. 14. Portions of the upper and lower lobes of a Lung. The upper lobe is minutely injected. The lower lobe contains only a trace of injection, but is solidified with tubercle, in which small cavities can be seen. R. 0. f. 15 (L. 2). Acute Broncho-pneumonic tubercle, with Pleurisy. Presented by Professor T. R. Fraser. R. 0. f. 16 (2390). Tubercular Broncho-pneumonia with rapid softening. R. 0. f. 17 (2406). Portion of lower lobe of Lung of an infant (zt. eight months. Tubercle is deposited in substance which also contains small cavities. R. 0. f. 18. Injected Lung with extensive Tubercular deposit. A small vomica is in the apex. Pleura thickened and roughened. Chronic Phthisis. R. C. g. R. C. g. 1 (2391). Upper lobe of right Lung almost entirely excavated into a huge thin-walled cavity with a smooth lining. An extremely thin layer of condensed pulmonary tissue separ- ating it from the pleural cavity. In portion of middle lobe numerous caseating tubercular nodules are seen. R. O. g. 2 (2392). Chronic Phthisis; large irregular thin-walled cavity; adherent and thickened pleura; caseating tubercular infiltration of lung. R. O. g. 3 (2393). Vertical section of Left Lung; very Chronic Phthisis; pleura much thickened, firmly adherent; lung con- solidated throughout; cavity at apex; below it extremely indurated grey consolidation. Chronic fibroid tubercle through- out. In lower part tubercle mainly peribronchial and minute bronchi shew very marked dilatation. R. 0. g. 4 (2395). Chronic Phthisis, shewing adherent Pleura and numerous cavities. R. 0. g. 5 (2396). Phthisical Lung, almost entirely destroyed with formation of very numerous irregular cavities.

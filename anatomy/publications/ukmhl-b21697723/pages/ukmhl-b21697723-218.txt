igS INTESTINAL CONCRETIONS. Al. I. a. 2. An Intestinal Concretion, concave on one surface, convex on the other. The surface is hardened with a calcareous covering. Al. I. a. 3. An irregularly-shaped Intestinal Concretion, felt-like on the surface. Al. I. a. 4. Two irregularly-shaped Intestinal Concretions. The surface is hardened with lime salts. Al. I. a. 5. Nine felt-like Intestinal Concretions of various sizes and form, one of which is bisected and exhibits concentric laminae. Al, I. a. 6. The halves of an Intestinal Concretion of a somewhat rectangular form and indented on both sides. The surface has a felted appearance. Al. I. a. 7. Two portions of an Intestinal Concretion, felt-like on the surface, laminated on section. Al. I. a. 8. The halves of an Intestinal Concretion. The external surface is rough and irregular, with deep depressions. Internally it shews a concentrically laminated appearance, and the nucleus is a plum stone. Al. I. a. 9. Half section of an Intestinal Concretion. Internally it shews a concentrically laminated appearance of alternating layers of brown fibres and white lime salts. The nucleus is a plum stone. Figured by Professor Hughes Bennett, in his Clinical Lectures on Medicine^ p. 280. 1868. Al. I. a. 10. A similar specimen to Al. I. a. 9, but smaller. Al. I. a. 11. A similar specimen. Al. I. a. 12. Half of an Intestinal Concretion, four inches in length, tuberculated on the surface. The laminae are arranged around a nucleus which appears to be a piece of bone. Al. I. a. 13. One half of a small potato-like Concretion, shewing concentrically laminated arrangement around a nucleus of bone. (See Monroâ€™s Morbid Anatomy^ plate ii., p. 72). Al. I. a. 14. Portion of an irregularly-shaped Intestinal Concretion. The nucleus seems to be a cherry stone. Al. I. a. 15. The halves of a tuberous-like Intestinal Concretion. The surface is in part formed by a layer of hard calcareous matter, and in part of a softer felted substance. The section is laminated, and the nucleus is apparently a piece of bone. Al. I. a. 16. Three Intestinal Concretions, largely composed of lime salts, though the husks of oats may be seen on their surfaces. The largest is bisected, and within is concentrically laminated. Its form is elongated and the surface of one of its

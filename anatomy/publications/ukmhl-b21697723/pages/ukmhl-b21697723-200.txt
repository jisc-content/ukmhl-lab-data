ALIMENTARY SYSTEM. i8o Dilatation of Caput Ccscttm Coli. Al. E. d. • Al. E. d. 1 (679)* Caput Caecum Coli, much dilated by a large con- cretion, which has been removed. Rest of colon communicates with caecum by an aperture about an inch in diameter. The appendix vermiformis is elongated, hypertrophied, and its glandular orifices enlarged. It contained a pin. Al. E. d. 2 (680). Dilatation of Caput Coli and lower end of Ileum. The ileo-caecal valve has disappeared, so that the cavity seems to be formed by a dilatation of the extremity of the ileum. There is a valvular arrangement resembling the pylorus, about a quarter of an inch in diameter, between the dilated caecum and ascending colon. Professor James Gregory’s case. Al. E. d. 3 (681). Dried preparation of the Caput Coli, dilated by a concretion. Enteritis, Simple and Membranous. Al. E. e. Al. E. e. 1 (834). A well-defined patch of exudation is seen at one point, and near it several smaller patches, adhering to the valvulae conniventes. Injected specimen. Al. E. e. 2 (834 a). Enteritis. Exudation of lymph on the mucous surface of the small intestine. Presented by Professor Hughes Bennett. Al. E. e. 3 (8346). Enteritis (Membranous). The exuded fibrin forms flakes on the mucous surface of the small intestine. Al. E. e. 4. Membranous Enteritis. Portion of the colon shew- ing fibrinous false membrane on the mucous surface. The intestine was much contracted, its inner surface lined by an irregular layer of buff-coloured exudation, with here and there blood clots. Microscopically, the exudation is composed of fibrinous layers and coagula, which adhere intimately to the inflamed mucous membrane. From a man 30 years of age, suffering from paralytic dementia, who was in the habit of swallowing various foreign bodies—dirt, etc. A similar condi- tion was present throughout the greater part of the small and large intestines. There was acute peritonitis. Patient under the care of Dr H. Alexis Thomson. Presented by Professor Greenfield, 1888. Al. E. e. 5 (873). Enteritis. The mucous membrane of the colon is thickened and swollen, and there is exudation adhering to the mucous surface in places. From a case of typhus, with dysenteric symptoms.

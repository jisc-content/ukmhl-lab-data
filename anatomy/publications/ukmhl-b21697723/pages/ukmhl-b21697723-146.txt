NERVOUS SYSTEM. 26 N. A. 1. 9 (1959)- Cerebral Haemorrhage. A clot about the size of a filbert is seen in the white matter of a cerebral convolution. N. A. 1. 10 (i960). Cerebral Haemorrhage. A deep-coloured clot, from effusion into the centre of the pons Varolii. N. A 1. 11 (1962). Cerebral Haemorrhage. A small cyst situated in the lower part of the pons Varolii, a quarter of an inch in front of the floor of the fourth ventricle, and between the olivary fasciculus and the deep fibres of the pons. N. A. 1. 12 (1963). Cerebral Haemorrhage. A small cyst in the upper part of the pons, due to haemorrhage. It shews rusty pigmentation. N. A. 1. 13 (1957)- Cerebral Haemorrhage. The remains of an apoplectic cyst are seen on the under surface of the right lobe of the cerebellum, and to the right of the medulla oblongata. The pressure of the cyst seems to have caused disappearance of the inferior cerebellar peduncle and right restiform body of the medulla. There was right-sided hemiplegia. Presented by Professor Hughes Bennett. Abscess of the Brain. N. A. m. N. A. m. 1 (1990). Abscess of Brain. A large abscess situated in the left cerebral hemisphere, between the surface and the corpus striatum. The left hemisphere was half an inch broader than the right, its dura mater was tense, and its convolutions flattened. Patient a man aged 37. N. A. m. 2 (1991). Abscess of Brain. The cavity is situated apparently in right temporo-sphenoidal lobe. The frontal and parietal lobes also contained pus. The origin of the disease was caries of the temporal bone. Patient a woman aged 30. N. A. m. 3 (1992). Abscess of Brain. The abscess has destroyed the front of the left temporo-sphenoidal lobe and the adjacent parts. No history. N. A. m. 4 (1982). Abscess of Brain. The commencing abscess is situated' superficially towards the outer part of the right temporo-sphenoidal lobe. A piece of whalebone is inserted where it communicates by a minute ulcerated aperture in the dura mater with the tympanum. The latter was disorganised by long-continued suppuration. Patient a woman aged 20. For symptoms see MSS. Catalogue. N. A. m. 5 (1983). Abscess of Brain. A thin cyst in the middle lobe of the left hemisphere, which was filled with purulent matter. N. A m. 6 (1984). Abscess of Brain. A large abscess cavity is seen in the right anterior lobe of the brain, above which several cerebral convolutions are obliterated. No symptoms indicative of brain disorder.

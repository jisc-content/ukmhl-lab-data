ALIMENTARY SYSTEM. i88 Al. E. j. 20 (9130?)- General Tuberculosis. The dissected trunk of a male pheasant, opened to display abdominal viscera and lungs. The stomach, intestines, liver, and spleen, minutely in- jected, are studded with tuberculous masses. This and numerous other pheasants in the preserves at Gosford, belonging to the Earl of Wemyss, had pined away and died in the year 1874. Al. E. j. 21 (9136). Tubercular Ulceration. A portion of the small intestine of another pheasant, from the same preserves. Presented, together with Al. E. j. 20, by Professor Sir Douglas Maclagan. Malignant Disease (Morbid Growth) and Ca7icerous Stricture. Al. E. 1. Al. E. 1. 1 1959)- Malignant Disease of Intestine. Several ulcerated patches of new growth are seen on the mucous mem- brane of the ileum. Al. E. 1. 2 (959flf). Malignant Disease of the Large Intestine. There is great enlargement of the solitary glands in the caecum and colon, and greatly swollen lymphatic glands at the angle near the ileo-caecal valve. Possibly lympho-sarcoma. Al. E. 1. 3 (960). Malignant Disease of Intestine. The mucous membrane of the ileum presents several fungoid ulcerations. Al. E. 1. 4 (961). Malignant Disease of Intestine. A fungating and ulcerated new growth occupies a considerable extent of the mucous membrane of the ileum. Possibly a typhoid ulcer. Al. E. 1. 5 (963). Malignant Disease of the Large Intestine. The walls of the caput caecum coli are largely infiltrated with can- cerous growth, which has ulcerated at one point. The ileo-caecal orifice is contracted, and several affected glands are retained. Al. E. 1. 6 (964). Malignant Disease of the Large Intestine. The mucous and submucous coats of the caput caecum coli and ascending colon are considerably infiltrated by a nodular new growth. Al. E. 1. 7 (965)- Malignant Disease of the Large Intestine. A perforation has occurred into the abdominal cavity, from ulcera- tion of the new growth in the ascending colon. The liver is closely adherent to the latter. Al. E. 1. 8 {9650!). Malignant Disease of the Large Intestine. A cancerous mass projects into the cavity of the large intestine. Externally, a coil of small intestine, involved in the new growth, is adherent. Presented by Professor Hughes Bennett, July 1864.

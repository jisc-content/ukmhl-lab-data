URINARY CALCULI. 313 Gen.-U. S. c. 41. Two small angular Calculi; the outer surfaces quite smooth. Weight, 46 grains. They consist of a minute nucleus of uric acid, with a layer of earthy phosphate deposited upon it, the exterior being composed of uric acid and urate of ammonia. Gen.-U. S. c. 42. Several small Calculi, varying in size, shape, and colour. Some contain phosphates in excess of the urates ; others, urates in excess of the phosphates. Gen.-U. S. C. 43. Section of an oval and flattened Calculus. The greater part of the Calculus consists of a mixture of phosphate of lime, with the urates of lime, magnesia, and ammonia. The cortex consists of a thin layer of uric acid. Gen.-U. S. C. 44. Calculus about the size of a small walnut, tuberculated on the exterior. Nucleus laminated, and com- posed of urate of ammonia, with trace of urate of lime. Cortex, phosphate of lime. Gen.-U. S. C. 45. Small oval flattened Calculus, laminated. Urate of ammonia and urate of lime, with a small quantity of phosphate of lime. Gen.-U. S. C. 46. Section of oval Calculus, smooth externally, and very compact on section, the whole being composed of closely placed concentric laminae. Removed from Professor Monro, tertius. Presented by Dr Rutherford Haldane, 1878. Uric Acid or Urate of Ammonia, with Oxalate of Lime externally. Gen,-U. S. d. Gen.-U. S. d. 1. Oval Calculus, laminated internally, mulberry- looking externally. Weight, 181 grains. Gen.-U. S. d. 2. Section of a Calculus, principally composed of oxalate of lime. At the centre, a deposit of uric acid and urate of ammonia, mingled with small amount of oxalate of lime. Nucleus Uric Acid or Urate of Ammonia invested by Layers of Oxalate of Lime and Uric Acid. Gen.-U. S. e. Gen.-U. S. e. 1. Oval Calculus; smooth externally. Weight, 317 grains. Nucleus, uric acid, around this a deposit of oxalate of lime ; outer layers consisting of uric acid, with traces of urate of lime and magnesia.

An oblique fracture of the tibia through its lower third; the inferior articular surface shews eburnation and other changes characteristic of arthritis deformans. Os. B. e. 87 (156). An oblique fracture of the tibia in its lower third; union with overriding has occurred, the upper fragment projecting on the inner side. Os. B. e. 88 (157). An oblique fracture of the tibia at the junction of its middle and lower thirds; united with partial overriding, the upper fragment projecting in front and to the inner side of the lower. Os. B. e. 89 (158). “An internal malleolus detached by a fracture into the ankle-joint.” (Old Catalogue.) Os. B. e. 90 (159). A comminuted fracture of the tibia of a Dog; partially united, with overriding and much new bone surrounding the protruding fragments. Os. B. e. 91 (160). A fracture of the fibula at its lower fourth, in which the fragments have united at an angle, open on the tibial aspect. Os. B. e. 92 (161). A fibula fractured through its middle and at its lower fourth; both have united at an angle, the upper one also with overriding of the fragments. Os. B. e. 93 (162). An oblique fracture of the fibula at its upper fourth; united, with overriding of the fragments, for a distance of nearly 5 cm. Os. B. e. 94(163). oblique fracture of the fibula at its upper third; united, with less deformity than the preceding specimens. Os. B. e. 95 (164). An oblique fracture of the fibula at its upper fourth, also well united. Os. B. e. 96 (326). Fragments of bone removed in a case of com- pound fracture of the tibia. Os. B. e. 97 (327). Portion of bone removed after compound fracture of the tibia. Plaster Casts illustrating Fractures. Os. B. e. 98 {121a). Cast of the anterior aspect of the left knee- joint in a case of transverse fracture of the patella, in which there was an interval of 7*5 cm. between the fragments. Os. B. e. 99 (Y 168). Cast of a transverse fracture of the patella. Os. B. e. 100(Y8p). Cast of the leg and foot in a case of com- pound fracture of the tibia. The lower end of the upper frag- ment is projecting through a granulating surface. It is probable that the fibula is also broken B

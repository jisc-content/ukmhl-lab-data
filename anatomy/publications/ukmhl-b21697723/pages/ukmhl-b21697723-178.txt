CIRCULATORY SYSTEM. 158 Aneurisms of Vessels of Lower Limbs, Cir. G. h. Cir. G. h. 1 (2248). Aneurism of upper part of femoral artery; it is embedded in the muscles of the thigh and springs from the femoral artery at the point at which the profunda is given olf by an opening four inches in length. The patient com- mitted suicide with a corkscrew by boring a hole into the aneurism. Presented by Professor Miller. Cir. G. h. 2 (2245). Diffuse aneurism of femoral artery lodged in muscles of the thigh and communicating with the artery by an oval opening. Presented by Professor Miller. Cir. G. h. 3 (2250). Wax model of left lower limb, shewing aneurism of popliteal artery. Cir. G. h. 4 (22476). Small aneurism on posterior aspect of popliteal artery. Presented by Professor Sir William Turner. Cir. G. h. 5 (2246). Saccular popliteal aneurism the size of a walnut; two irregular dilatations of the v^essel immediately above. Presented by Professor Miller. See also Cir. G. m. 4. Cir. G. h. 6. Saccular aneurism of popliteal artery bulging to the outer side of the space; filled with laminated clot. The rela- tions of the vein and nerves to the sac are well seen. Cir. G. h. 7 (2244). Aneurismal sac from the posterior tibial artery. The lining membrane is studded with atheromatous and calcareous patches. Cir. G. h. 8 (2243). Aneurism of posterior tibial artery. Aneurism of Cerebral Arteries. Cir. G. i. Cir. G.i. 1. Saccular aneurism the size of a marble on the circle of Willis, probably on the termination of the internal carotid.

Obliteration by ligature of aorta of dog below the renal arteries; anastomosis between intercostal and lumbar branches of aorta. Prepared and pre- sented by Professor Syme. Cir. G. m. 2 (2256). Obliteration by ligature of aorta of dog opposite the third lumbar vertebra. Prepared and presented by Professor Syme. Cir. G. m. 3 (2257).

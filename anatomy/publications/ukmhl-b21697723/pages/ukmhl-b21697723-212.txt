ALIMENTARY SYSTEM. 192 Al. E. O. 6 (ggga). External Haemorrhoids. Two projections, the size of a pea, are seen at the anus. There is also slight ulceration. Al. E. o. 7 (999External Haemorrhoids. One very large haemorrhoidal mass and several small ones are seen arising from the margin of the anus. Presented by Professor Goodsir. Al. E. O. 8. Cast shewing haemorrhoids in situ. DISEASES OF THE PERITONEUM. Al. F. Inflammation^ Peritonitis, Acute and Chronic. Al. F. a. Al. F. a. 1 (827)- Peritonitis, etc. A layer of fibrinous exudation covers the serous surface of the bowel, especially at the side furthest from the mesenteric attachment. The mesentery is thickened and its glands enlarged. Injected specimen. Al. F. a. 2 (828). Peritonitis. There is a covering of partly organised lymph on the serous surface of the small intestine, detached in places. The mesentery is thickened and contracted. Injected specimen. Al. F. a. 3 (829). Peritonitis. The exudation is in a further state of organisation, as shewn by the passage of the injection into the fibrous adhesions, which have been torn through. Injected specimen. Al. F. a. 4 (831). Peritonitis. Previous inflammation has resulted in dense, universal, fibrous adhesions between the coils of intestine, omentum, and mesentery. A considerable quantity of sero-purulent fluid was found in the abdominal cavity. From a woman in whose gall-bladder were numerous biliary calculi. (See MS. Catalogue, 1117.) Al. F. a. 5 (832). Peritonitis, due to Perforation. A coil of small intestine, matted together by recent fibrinous exudation. Injected specimen. Al. F. a. 6 (832 a). Peritonitis (Chronic). To the serous coat of the transverse colon numerous flocculent fibrous adhesions are attached. The great omentum is somewhat thickened and retracted from old inflammation. Al. F. a. 7 (833). Abdominal Abscess. Part of the sac of the abscess is shewn, with ulcerations into the colon and peritoneum, through which pus was discharged shortly before death. The abscess was situated between the peritoneum and the muscular fibres of the left crus of the diaphragm.

D. c. 1 (1400). Gonorrhoeal Urethritis with Cystitis. The mucous membrane of the urethra is thickened and ulcerated in some places, especially at the bulb. The muscular coat of the bladder is hypertrophied, and, with the exception of the trigone, the whole mucous surface is covered with exudation and partially ulcerated. In the centre of the left vesicula seminalis was a small abscess which communicated with the bladder. Disease of three months’ duration. stricture of Urethra. Gen.-U. D. d. Gen.-U. D. d. 1 (1377)- Stricture of Urethra. The stricture, which is situated at the bulb, was treated by caustic. Unskilful use of the catheter has resulted in the formation of a false passage. The bladder is somewhat hypertrophied. Gen.-U. D. d. 2 (1401). Stricture of Urethra. The inflam- matory thickening and stricture are nearly two inches in length, and occupy the bulbous and membranous urethra. The mucous membrane of the bladder, which is everted, is covered at the parts with an inflammatory exudate. Gen.-U. D. d. 3 (1405). Stricture of Urethra. The situation of the stricture is at the bulb, behind which the canal is dilated. The bladder is very much contracted and hypertrophied. A bougie is inserted into an opening in the rectum, probably made by operation to reach an abscess in the region of the vesiculae seminales. Gen.-U. D. d. 4 (1408). Stricture of Urethra, situated about three inches from meatus. A false passage has been formed anterior to the stricture, whilst behind it the urethra is some- what dilated. Gen.-U. D. d. 5 (1409). Stricture of Urethra. Section of the penis, with the urethra laid open, shewing a stricture, half an inch in extent, situated immediately anterior to the bulb. Corpora Cavernosa injected. Gen.-U. D. d. 6 (1402). Stricture of Urethra. The situation of the stricture is about one inch in front of the bulb. Some of the lacunae are dilated. A small probe is passed into a false passage, which has been formed by unskilful catheterisation. The bladder is hypertrophied, contracted, and sacculated. The prostate—more especially its third lobe—is enlarged.

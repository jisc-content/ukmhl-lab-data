BILIARY CALCULI. 2I6 Al. K. t. 12 (1123)- Portion of a very large Biliary Calculus. It has a yellowish-white colour, and the broken surface presents a radiated crystalline fracture. Al. K. t. 13 (1124). Twenty-four Biliary Calculi of angular form, but with the edges rounded off. The largest is about the size of a pea. Al. K. t. 14 (1125). A large Biliary Calculus, separated into numerous fragments, and exhibiting layers of inspissated bile, alternating more or less with deposits of cholesterine. Al. K. t. 15 (1126). Three Biliary Calculi of angular shape, and two portions of two larger specimens. The latter exhibit con- centric laminse. Al. K. t. 16 (1130). Several small Biliary Calculi and fragments of others. The fractured surfaces shew a radiated crystalline appearance. Al. K. t. 17 (1131). Five fragments of a large Biliary Calculus, presenting a semi-crystalline or micaceous deposit. Al. K. t. 18 (1133). Thirteen small Biliary Calculi of a lustrous appearance, and presenting a remarkable gradation of forms; the largest, about the size of a pea, has three spine-like processes ; another has two long spines, and from others shorter spines project. Figured by Professor Hughes Bennett in Clinical Lectures 07i Medicine^ p. 274, 1868. Al. K. t. 19 (1134). Fragments of a very friable Biliary Calculus. The fractured surfaces shew concentric laminae. Al. K. t. 20 (1135)* External fragments and nuclear portion of a large Biliary Calculus. The fragments shew the radiated crystalline fracture. It was passed per anum. Al. K. t. 21 {1136). Several small Biliary Calculi of an angular form and portions of others. Al. K. t. 22 (1137). A quadrangular shaped Biliary Calculus, which has been divided to shew the radiated and crystalline nucleus, surrounded externally by less transparent concentric laminae. Figured by Professor Hughes Bennett in his Clinical Lectures on Medicine, p. 274, 1868. Al. K. t. 23 (1138). Three Biliary Calculi consisting of pure cholesterine, and presenting a white and waxy appearance. Al. K. t. 24 (1139). Twenty-one Biliary Calculi. The three largest are whitish and waxy looking. The others are more tinged with biliary secretion and are angular in form. Al. K. t. 25 (I141). Eighteen Biliary Calculi, which are angular in form, whitish, and of a pearl-like appearance.

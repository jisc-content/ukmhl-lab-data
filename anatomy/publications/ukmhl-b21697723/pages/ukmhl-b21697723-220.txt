INTESTINAL CONCRETIONS. 200 Al. I. a. 32. A wedge-shaped portion of an Intestinal Concretion. Al. I. a. 33. Two slices from an Intestinal Concretion. Al. I. a. 34. Two portions of an Intestinal Concretion. Al. I. a. 35. Two portions of an Intestinal Concretion of a felt- like consistence. Al. I. a. 36. An irregularly-shaped Intestinal Concretion. Al. I. a. 37. Portion of an Intestinal Concretion, irregular in shape, with one surface concave, as if a second concretion had been in contact with it. Al. I. a. 38. Five Concretions about the size of large marbles, but polygonal in shape. The cut surface of one shews con- centric laminae. Al. I. a. 39. A large number of very small Intestinal Concretions, composed of the husks of oats, some loose, others centrally attached at intervals on pieces of worsted like short strings of beads. The concretions vary in size, the largest being about the size of a hazel nut. Al. I. a. 40. Husks of Oats from the Intestinal Tract. Al. I. a. 41. Concretion from the Intestine composed of magnesia, which the patient had taken in large quantities. (See Monroâ€™s Morbid Anatomy^ p. 34). From the Horse. Al. I. a. 42. A very large Intestinal Concretion. Weight, 5;^ lbs.; the long diameter is 8 inches ; the transverse 6^ inches. The outer surface is roughly tuberculated and composed of a mix- ture of lime salts and the husks of oats. It has been bisected, and the surface of section presents many alternating concentric layers of hair, portions of grain, and calcareous matter. Al. I. a. 43. The halves of an oval-shaped Intestinal Concretion. Length, 10 inches; breadth, 6 inches; weight, 3 lbs. 10 oz. The surface presents numerous nodulated masses. Internally the great mass of the concretion is similar to Al. I. a. 42, but the surface nodules presented their own concentric lamination, as if deposited independently of the mass of the concretion. Al. I. a. 44. A tuberous Intestinal Concretion of an irregular shape, and pitted on its external surface. Through the separa- tion of one side a nucleus about the size of a walnut has been exposed, which would appear to be composed of the finely divided husks of oats and hair. The bulk of the concretion consists of these materials, with the addition of short pieces of straw. Al. I. a. 45. A similar Intestinal Concretion.

THE EDINBURGH STEREOSCOPIC ATLAS OF ANATOMY. EDINBURGH: T. C. & E. C. JACK; and 34 HENRIETTA STREET, LONDON, W.C. ABDOMEN. INGUINAL REGION—No. 2. SAPHENOUS OPENING AND EXTERNAL ABDOMINAL RING. This view shows the apertures through which femoral and inguinal herniae appear. The Sajphenous opening is an oval aperture in the deep fascia' of the thigh, one inch long, and half an inch wide, or slightly larger, situated about an inch and a half below and external to the spine of the pubis. The outer edge, which is strong, and is called the falciform process, passes upwards to join Gimbernat’s ligament, while the inner edge lies on a posterior plane, and passes behind the femoral vessels. The internal saphenous vein and lymphatic vessels pass through the opening to join the deeper vessels. The thin cribriform fascia, which covers the opening, has been removed. The fascia on the inner side covers the pectineus muscle, and is called the pubic fascia; that on the outer side is the iliac fascia. The external abdominal ring, the outlet of the inguinal canal, is a triangular aperture in the aponeurosis of the external oblique muscle of the abdomen, which, in the male, transmits the spermatic cord and its coverings, and the ilio-inguinal nerve; and, in the female, the round ligament. The margins are united by some thin transverse fibres, called the intercolumnar fibres, which.have been removed, in order to show the ring as an aperture. The figures indicate— 1. Arcuate fibres of the external oblique aponeurosis. 5. Falciform edge. 2. Poupart’s ligament. 6. Fascia of pectineus muscle. 3. External pillar of the external abdominal ring. 7. Spermatic cord. 4. Internal pillar of the external abdominal ring. 8. Femoral vein.

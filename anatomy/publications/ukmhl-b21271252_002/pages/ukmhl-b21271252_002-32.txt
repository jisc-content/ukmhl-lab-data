This view shows the visceral or inferior surface, and the back part of the parietal surface. The inferior surface of the liver is divided into a right and a left portion by the umbilical fissure and by the fissure for the ductus venosus. To the left of this line is the left lobe, on which is seen an impression for the upper surface of the stomach and an elevation called the tuber omentale, in contact with the lesser omentum. The portion lying to the right of the umbilical fissure is subdivided by the fossa for the gall- bladder into two portions. To the left of the gall bladder, lies the quadrate lobe in contact with the pylorus, and, in this specimen, greatly indented by the colon in front, while the area to the right shows a colic, a renal, and a duodenal impression, indicated by numbers. Behind the transverse fissure lie the caudate lobe and the Spigelian lobe. This fissure is a transverse cleft, by which the hepatic artery, portal vein, and the hepatic plexus of nerves enter, and the hepatic ducts and lymphatic vessels leave the liver. An enlarged lymphatic gland is seen, which is liable to exercise pressure upon these structures. The posterior part of the parietal surface shows on the right, a portion of the bare area, and to the left of this, are seen the supra-renal impression, the fossa lodging the inferior vena cava, the Spigelian lobe, and the groove for the oesophagus.

EDINBURGH: T. C. & E. C. JACK; and 34 HENRIETTA STREET, LONDON, W.C. D ■£ Q c z £ m - f Running along the side wall of the pelvis is seen the white line or arcus tendineus, from which the levator ani takes origin, and which extends from the back of the symphisis pubis to the spine of the ischium. Above this level, the pelvis is lined by the obturator internus muscle, and at its upper margin is the notch by which the obturator vessels and nerve escape from the pelvic cavity. In this case there is an abnormal obturator artery, arising from the deep epigastric artery, and accompanied by a vein which joins the internal iliac vein. There is only a very small obturator branch from the internal iliac artery. Below the white line, is the pelvic diaphragm, composed of the levator ani and coccygeus muscle on each side of the body. On the front of the sacrum lies the pyriformis muscle, with the anterior sacral nerves, from which some branches pass forwards to supply the levator ani muscle on its pelvic aspect. 1.

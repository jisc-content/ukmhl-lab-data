THE EDINBURGH STEREOSCOPIC ATLAS OF ANATOMY. EmiffillBOH ? T. fL & F. C JACK: and 34 HENRIETTA STREET. LONDON, W.C. ABDOMEN. ABDOMINAL CAVITY—No. 2. The great omentum has been removed, to show the arrangement of the coils of intestine. The usual sub-division of the abdominal cavity into nine regions is shown by the wires laid on the surface. The positions occupied by different parts of the alimentary canal vary greatly, and no definite arrangement can be laid down applicable to all cases. The principal factors which produce these changes in position are the distension and contraction of the hollow viscera, and constriction of the abdominal wall, as well as the position of the body, respiratory movements, etc. In this subject, the stomach is empty, the small intestine is well filled, and the large intestine distended in certain parts, especially the caecum, ascending colon, transverse colon, and pelvic colon. To ascertain the arrangement of the intestine, several coils were numbered, and the distances of the different coils so numbered from the duodenum were measured after removal of the intestine. There is,no definite arrangement of these coils, but it may be stated generally that the proximal coils lie in the upper and left segment of the abdominal cavity, and pass thence down towards the right and lower part of the cavity. The loop indicated by 2 was 4>b feet from the duodcno-jejunal flexure, 3 was 3 feet further on, 4 was 2 feet beyond 3, 5 was 2| feet beyond 4, 6 was 1| foot beyond that, and from 6 to the end of the ilium was 4 feet. The distended pelvic colon—indicated by 7 and 8—occupies the greater portion of the lower segment of the abdomen. The figures indicate— Transverse colon. 10. Ascending colon. Loops of small intestine. 11. Hepatic flexure. Loops of pelvic colon, greatly distended. 12. Loop in transverse colon. Upper part of caecum.

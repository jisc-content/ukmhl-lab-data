JACK; axd 34 HENRIETTA STREET, LONDON, W.C. The aponeurosis of the external oblique has been divided and turned down, to show the spermatic cord lying in the inguinal canal. The Inguinal Canal is an oblique, flattened passage through the abdominal wall, measuring about an inch and a half in length, and extending from the internal to the external abdominal ring, above the inner half of Poupart’s ligament. In shape, it is a groove formed by the union of Poupart’s ligament and the fascia transversalis. It is described as having an anterior and a posterior wall, a roof, and a floor. The anterior wall of the inguinal canal is formed by the aponeurosis of the external oblique muscle, and also by the internal oblique in the outer part. The internal oblique arches over the canal, and forms a roof for it. The external spermatic fascia was divided at the external abdominal ring, and is seen forming a covering for the spermatic cord as it passes to the scrotum. The ilio-inguinal nerve is seen joining the cord near the internal ring, and the ilio-hypogastric nerve lies higher up. 4. External spermatic fascia.

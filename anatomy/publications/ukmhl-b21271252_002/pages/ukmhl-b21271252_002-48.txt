ABDOMEN PELVIS. No. 12. Rectum. VERTICAL SAGITTAL SECTION OF THE MALE PELVIS SLIGHTLY TO THE LEFT OF THE MESIAL PLANE. The peritoneum has been removed to show the vessels and nerves. The bladder is moderately distended, and occupies the anterior halt of the pelvic cavity the apex rising up behind the symphisis pubis. A large area of the posterior or basal aspect lies m front of the rectui, the seminal vesicles intervening in the lower part. The-prostate lies fixed in i s sheath of fascia, and the portion of bladder wall associated with it does not change its position. The rectum is distended, and is seen to receive branches of supply from .the inferior mesenteric artery The principal vessels and nerves lie on the side wall of the pelvis at a somewhat higher level than those organs, and therefore are not liable to pressure, except when the viscera are con- siderably over-distended. The course of the vessels and other structures is seen m the next view. 1. Intervertebral disc above the sacrum. 3. Bifurcation of the common iliac artery. 5.

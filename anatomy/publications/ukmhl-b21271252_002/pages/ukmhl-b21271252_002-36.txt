THE EDINBURGH STEREOSCOPIC ATLAS OF ANATOMY. ABDOMEN. VISCERA—No. 14. EDINBURGH: T. C. & E. C. JACK; and 34 HENRIETTA STREET, LONDON, W.C. ABDOMEN VISCERA. No. 14. MUCOUS MEMBRANE OF THE INTESTINE. The character of the mucous membrane of the alimentary canal presents marked differences in different portions. In the upper part of the jejunum, the wall of the intestine is thick and fleshy, the inner surface is velvety, from the presence of villi, and shows numerous well-defined transverse ridges, called valvulae conniventes. Further down, these characters become less distinct, until, near the end of the ileum, the coats are thinned, the ridges are few and irregular, and the diameter is diminished. In this region may be seen the characteristic Peyer’s patches, which are oval masses of lymphoid tissue, situated opposite the mesenteric attachment, and with the long axis lying along the line of the intestine. One of these is seen on an elevation in fig. 3. The large intestine shows irregular sacculations, and the surface is smoother, as there are no villi. Appendices epiploicae project from the peritoneal surface, and are merely small pads of fat covered by peritoneum. The pieces of intestine shown are:— 1. Upper end of jejunum. 2. Middle of small intestine. 3. Lower end of ileum. 4. Large intestine.

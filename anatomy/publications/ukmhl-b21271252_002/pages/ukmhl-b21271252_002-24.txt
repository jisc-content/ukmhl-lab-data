“VISCERA—No. 2. ABDOMEN. THE STOMACH BED. 8. Right kidney. 9. Spleen. THE EDINBURGH STEREOSCOPIC ATLAS OF ANATOMY. The figures indicate—* ABDOMEN VISCERA EDINBURGH: T. C. & E. C. ACK; and 34 HENRIETTA STREET, LONDON, W.G, 11. Splenic flexure of the colon. 12. Left crus of the diaphragm. View of the last specimen after removal of the stomach. The stomach lies in a chamber under cover of the left lobe of the liver and left cupola of the diaphragm, and this chamber is bounded by the gastric surface of the spleen, the left crus of the diaphragm, the left supra-renal capsule and a varying amount of the left kidney, the upper surface of the pancreas, the transverse mesocolon, and the transverse colon. The transverse colon and mesocolon have been removed, leaving the splenic flexure in position, and showing the flattened upper surface of the pancreas. The left crus of the diaphragm lies above and internal to the left supra-renal body. The second and third parts of the duodenum are seen as in the last view. It will be noticed how close the termination of the duodenum lies to the under surface of the stomach, the transverse mesocolon alone intervening, and hence the intestine can easily be fixed to this surface of the stomach, as in the operation of posterior gastro-enterostomy. 1-5. Ligamentum teres of liver. 6. Gall bladder. 7. Hepatic flexure of the colon. 10. Head of the pancreas and superior mesenteric vessels.

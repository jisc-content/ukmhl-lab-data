ABDOMEN ABDOMINAL WALL. No. imraRnRmi. T fi ft yl C. .TACK- and 34 HENRIETTA STREET, LONDON, W.O. The external oblique muscle and aponeurosis are displayed, with cutaneous nerves on one side. The external oblique is a wide flat muscle, which takes origin from outer surfaces and lower borders of the lower eight ribs, interdigitating with the serratus magnus above and with the latissimus dorsi below. The aponeurosis extends in a vertical direction from the ensiform cartilage above to the crest of the pubis below, and between these points it is inserted into the linea alba, the fibres decussating with those of the opposite side. The aponeurosis is very wide below, where it occupies the whole of the lower part of the anterior abdominal wall, as the muscular fibres do not extend below the level of the anterior superior iliac spine, and the pectoralis muscle takes origin from the upper part of the aponeurosis. The cutaneous nerves which are seen piercing the aponeurosis of the muscle are the small terminal branches of the lower five intercostal nerves, and the ilio-hypogastric lower down, while some lateral cutaneous branches of the intercostal nerves are seen piercing the muscle. The anterior cutaneous nerves, after piercing the aponeurosis, pass in an outward direction. muscle. 2. Slip of pectoralis major muscle, arising from aponeurosis of external oblique. 3.

THE EDINBURGH STEREOSCOPIC ATLAS OF ANATOMY. ABDOMEN. The figures indicate— ABDOMINAL CAVITY.—No. 3. 11. Commencement of the jejunum, divided. EDINBURGH: T. C. & E. C. JACK; and 34 HENRIETTA STREET, LONDON, W.C. ABDOMEN ABDOMINAL CAVITY. The small intestine has been removed, and the mesentery divided close to its root. This view illustrates the regions of the abdomen occupied by the small intestine when the stomach is empty, and the large intestine is distended. From the posterior abdominal wall a double fold of peritoneum, the mesentery, passes off along a line extending from the left side of the second lumbar vertebra downwards into the right iliac fossa. This fold divides the lower part of the abdominal cavity into a right and a left half. In this specimen, the greater part of the small intestine was pushed upwards and to the left, by the distended pelvic colon, and was enabled to pass upwards on account of the contracted state of the stomach. The descending colon is, as usual, firmly contracted, and the peritoneum on either side of it is raised into transverse folds. To its inner side, at the upper part, is seen the projection of the left kidney, crossed by a branch of the inferior mesenteric artery, and the splenic flexure lies well under cover of the left costal margin. The arrangement of the coils of the pelvic colon when distended is clearly seen, and the consecutive loops are numbered. 1. Descending colon. 2. Iliac colon. 3. 4, 5, and 6. Consecutive loops of the pelvic colon. 7. Caecum. 8. Ascending colon. 9. Lies below the hepatic flexure. 10. Transverse colon. 12. Branch of inferior mesenteric artery behind the peritoneum. 13. Folds of peritoneum passing from the descending colon.

KIDNEYS VIEWED FROM THE FRONT, THE UPPER PAIR FROM A YOUNG SUBJECT, THE LOWER FROM AN ADULT. ABDOMEN. VISCERA.—No. 15. THE EDINBURGH STEREOSCOPIC ATLAS OF ANATOMY. The figures Indicate— EDINBURGH: T. C. & E. C. JACK; and 34 HENRIETTA STREET, LONDON, W.C. ON VHq'IC The shape of the kidneys is characteristic, and each possesses an upper and a lower pole, two surfaces, and two borders. The upper pole is broad but thin, and lies nearer the middle line than the lower, which is narrower but thick. The outer border is convex, and on the inner border is an oblong fossa, the hiluin, in which the ureter and the blood-vessels are lodged. The middle part of the anterior surface is raised up so that this part of the kidney is thick, and the surface slopes away towards each pole, forming two planes of pressure. In contact with the upper plane of the right kidney is the liver, and with the lower the colon, while the duodenum lies in front of a variable area near the hilum. The left kidney, on the other hand, is in contact above with the stomach, spleen, pancreas, and suprarenal capsule, while below it is in contact with the coils of intestines, and the descending colon lies along its outer border. 1. Hepatic area. 4. Splenic area. 2. Duodenal area. 5. Pancreatic area. 3. Colic area. 6. Intestinal area.

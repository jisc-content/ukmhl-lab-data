VISCERA IN A FEMALE SUBJECT. ABDOMEN. The figures indicate— ABDOMINAL CAVITY.—No. 5. THE EDINBURGH STEREOSCOPIC ATLAS OF ANATOMY. ABDOMEN ABDOMINAL CAVITY. No. 5. Transverse colon. EDINBURGH : T. C. & E. C. JACK: and 34 HENRIETTA STREET, LONDON, W.C. 2. Anterior surface of the stomach. The arrangement of the movable viscera within the abdominal cavity shows a great amount of variation in different individuals, depending upon several conditions, such as, the amount of distension of different parts of the alimentary canal, and in the female, upon the constriction of the lower part of the thoracic wall which occurs in tight-lacing. The specimen seen here illustrates a condition which is found in a certain number of such cases, and illustrates some of the changes which apparently may be produced by such constriction. The principal alterations are that the liver has been pushed downwards by the constriction of the thoracic wall, and there has been a descent of the pyloric region of the stomach, and a shifting of the whole body of the organ to the left so that the lesser curvature is vertical in position, and lies a considerable distance from the under surface of the liver. The first part of the colon is greatly distended, and the first part of the transverse colon passes up in front of the lower border of the liver, and then along the lesser curvature of the stomach. The remaining part was firmly constricted, and passed along the greater curvature of the stomach, upwards to the left hypochondriac region. The coils of small intestine were almost entirely displaced down into the cavity of the pelvis. Abdominal symptoms were entirely absent during life in this case, and this view has been included in order to show an extreme degree of a condition of the stomach which may exist without special symptoms, and, it may be added, almost any intermediate condition may also be found. 1.

THE EDINBURGH STEREOSCOPIC ATLAS OF ANATOMY. 34 HENRIETTA STREET, LONDON, W.C. EDINBURGH: T. C. & E. C. JACK; ABDOMEN. INGUINAL REGION—No. 5. In addition to the previous dissections, the sheaths of the recti muscles have been opened, and a portion of the rectus abdominis muscle removed on the right side, to show the posterior wall of the sheath. The sheath of the rectus is a membranous structure, derived from the aponeurosis of the flat abdominal muscles. The aponeurosis of the internal oblique enters into the formation of both the anterior and posterior walls of the sheath, and the aponeurosis of the external oblique passes into the anterior lamella, and that of the transversalis into the posterior. In the sheath are seen the rectus and pyramidalis muscles, the deep epigastric vessels, and the terminal branch of some of the lower intercostal nerves. The semilunar fold of Douglas is the lower free margin of the posterior wall of the sheath, which stops at a point midway between the umbilicus and the pubis, and below this level, the rectus is in contact with the fascia transversalis (7). This view also shows the relation of the conjoint tendon to the sheath of the rectus. The fi} 1. Aponeurosis of external oblique. 2. Aponeurosis of internal oblique. 3. Conjoined tendon. 4.

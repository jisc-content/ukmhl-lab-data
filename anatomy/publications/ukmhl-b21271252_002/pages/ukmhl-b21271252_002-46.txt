Peritoneal fold due to the ureter, crossed here by ABDOMEN PELVIS (MALE) PELVIS.—No. 2 (Male). VERTICAL MESIAL SAGITTAL SECTION THROUGH THE MALE PELVIS, TO SHOW THE VISCERA The peritoneum covering the superior surface of the bladder is continued forwards on to the anterior abdominal wall. In a backward direction it leaves the bladder, passes over the apex of the seminal vesicles and the vasa deferentia, and thence on to the front of the rectum, which it reaches about an inch above the base of the prostate gland. Laterally, the peritoneum passes on to the side wall of the pelvis. When the bladder and rectum are empty, it is raised into two folds. One of these passes as a sharp crescentic margin from the base of the seminal vesicles and the vas deferens outwards and backwards towards the sacrum, and is called the sacro-genital fold. It contains some fibrous and muscular tissue. In front of this, a fold is raised up by the ureter. These folds divide the lateral pelvic peritoneal cavity into three fossae. By the side of the rectum is the para-rectal fossa, limited in front by the sacrogenital fold. In front of it is a middle or genital fossa extending forwards to the fold of the ureter, and in front of it again, by the side of the bladder, is the para-vesical fossa. The- fold of the ureter is crossed by a ridge due to the vas deferens which lies below the peritoneum, and crosses the ureter. The recto-vesical peritoneal pouch is limited below by the peritoneum between the bladder and front of the rectum. 1. Fourth lumbar intervertebral disc. 5.

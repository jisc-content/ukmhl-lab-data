Orifice of the vermiform appendix. ABDOMEN ABDOMINAL CAVITY. FROM THE SAME SUBJECT AS THE PRECEDING VIEW. The small intestine has been removed, and also a portion of the colon, and the caecum opened. The positions of the pyloric portion of the stomach and of the pyloric orifice are seen, and also the interior of the caecum. The pyloric orifice has moved downwards and to the left, and the duodenum has been thrown into a loop. This view shows in a very typical manner the structure of the ileo-caecal orifice, and the retinacula which pass round the interior of the caecum. The vermiform appendix is seen passing down into the pelvis. The anterior surface of the liver shows the groove which contained the first part of the 3. Pyloric orifice. 5.

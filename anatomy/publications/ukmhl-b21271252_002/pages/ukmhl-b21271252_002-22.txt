HENRIETTA STREET, LONDON, W.C, ABDOMEN ABDOMINAL CAVITY. No. EDINBURGH ; T. C. & E. C. JACK; and 3 GENERAL VIEW OF THE POSTERIOR ABDOMINAL WALL AND OF THE VISCERA RESTING ON IT. This view illustrates a large number of important anatomical relationships, and attention may be directed to the abdominal aorta lying in front of the bodies of the vertebrae, with the psoas muscle lying on each side. A number of structures lie in relation to these muscles, such as the inferior vena cava, the inferior mesenteric vessels, the ureters, spermatic vessels, and the branches of the lumbar plexus. The pancreas and duodenum are seen lying mainly in the epigastric region. The duodenum overlaps the front of the right kidney, while the pancreas passes in front of the left. The right kidney lies at a somewhat lower level than the left, and the branches of the inferior mesenteric artery should be noticed crossing in front of the left kidney. The greater part of the pelvic colon has been removed, leaving only the termination, which is distended, and which is seen, in this case, to be on the right side of the pelvis. 3.

C. & E. C. JACK ; and 34 HENRIETTA STREET, LONDON, W.C. CORONAL SECTION OF THE PELVIS, WITH THE BLADDER AND PROSTATE IN SITU. Lining the side wall of the bony pelvis is seen the obturator internus muscle on the left side, with fascia on its inner and outer aspects. The fascia on its pelvic aspect gives origin to the levator ani muscle, and the anterior strong pillars of that muscle are seen supporting the prostate gland and passing on to blend with the wall of the anal canal. External to this muscle, on-the right side of the specimen, is seen the apex of the ischio-rectal fossa, with the internal pudic nerve and vessels lying in its outer wall. The prostate rests on the end of the rectum, and the groove between its base and the neck of the bladder was occupied by a plexus of veins and by fibrous tissue. The anal canal passes down- wards and backwards from the prostate. The vessels, nerves, and ureter lying on the side wall of the pelvis, and the vessels and nerves on the pelvic brim should be noticed. The figures 2. Obturator internus muscle. 6.

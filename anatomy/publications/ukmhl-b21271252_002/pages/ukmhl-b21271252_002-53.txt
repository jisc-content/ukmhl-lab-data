THE EDINBURGH STEREOSCOPIC ATLAS OF ANATOMY, ABDOMEN. BLABDEE—No. 1. 2. Lateral surface of the prostate. The figures indicate— ABDOMEN BLADDER. 5. Seminal vesicle. 3. Termination of the ureter. TWO SPECIMENS OF THE BLADDER, PROSTATE, ETC., VIEWED FROM BELOW. In A the bladder is moderately distended, and in B it is empty. The inferior surface of the bladder is in contact, at the back, with the base of the prostate, and, in this region, it is called the neck, and contains the aperture of the urethra. From this point, the urethra passes through the substance of the prostate, and emerges from its rounded tip. In front of the prostate, the under surface of the bladder is rounded, and it is sometimes divided into two lateral halves by a median sagittal border which passes forwards to the apex of the bladder The inferior surface passes almost insensibly into the basal aspect behind, an it is separatee from the upper surface by the lateral borders of the bladder. This under surface is in contact with the pubic symphisis and body of the pubis, the retro-pubic pad of fat, and the levator ani and obturator internus muscles. As the bladder fills, this surface becomes more rounded, and is elongated, so that the apex o the bladder passes upwards above the symphisis pubis. 1. Inferior surface of the bladder. 4. Vas deferens.

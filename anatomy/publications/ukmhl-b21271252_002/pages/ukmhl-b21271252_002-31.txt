The figures indicate— ABDOMEN. ABDOMINAL VISCERA—No. 9. The parietal surface of the liver, in contact with the diaphragm, is divided into right and left THE EDINBURGH STEREOSCOPIC ATLAS OF ANATOMY. o J ABDOMEN VISCERA. No EDINBURGH; T. C. & E, C. JACK; and 34 HENRIETTA STREET, LONDON, W.C. THE LIVER VIEWED FROM ABOVE. lobes by the attachment of the falciform ligament, a double fold of peritoneum which runs upwards on this surface and then divides into two parts. The lateral parts of this surface are convex, and are in relation to the base of the lung on each side, while the central part is flat and is related to the heart and pericardium. The posterior part seen in this view is directed backwards, and forms the posterior surface of the organ. The diverging limbs of the falciform ligament form, on the right, the upper layer of the coronary ligament, and, on the left the upper layer of the left lateral ligament. The coronary ligament, consisting of an upper and a lower layer, encloses the bare area of the liver, a surface destitute of peritoneal covering in contact with the under surface of the diaphragm. The meeting of the two layers to the right forms the small right lateral ligament. On the posterior surface are seen, from left to right, the groove for the oesophagus, the Spigelian lobe, the groove for the inferior vena cava, and the bare area, with a portion of the surface for the right suprarenal body. In the lumen of the inferior vena cava are seen some orifices of the hepatic veins, by which the blood is returned from the liver. 1. Upper end of the falciform ligament, 5. Bare area. 2.

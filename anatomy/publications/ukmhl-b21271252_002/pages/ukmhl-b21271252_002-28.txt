SPLEEN, PANCREAS, KIDNEY, AND UNDER SURFACE OF THE STOMACH, FROM THE LEFT SIDE AND BELOW. The tail of the pancreas passes across the front of the left kidney towards the spleen, below the under surface of the stomach. The splenic vessels accompany it, and are seen entering the spleen at the hilum. The stomach here is empty, and comes into contact with only a small portion of the gastric surface of the spleen, the remainder of that surface was in contact with the splenic flexure of the colon. The kidney is seen to be related in front to the pancreas and spleen, while the branches of the inferior mesenteric artery cross in front of it, and, with the peritoneum, separated it from the small intestine. The descending colon passes downwards along its outer border. The anterior margin of the spleen shows a distinct notch. 1. Under surface of the stomach. 2. Splenic vessels. 3. Tail of pancreas. 4. Upper part of left kidney. 5. A portion of the phrenico-colic peritoneal ligament, supporting the spleen. 7. The seventh rib.

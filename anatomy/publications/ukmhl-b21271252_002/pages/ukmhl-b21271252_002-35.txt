CAECUM. Interior of the caecum in situ from the front. The caecum lies in the right iliac fossa, immediately above the outer half of Poupart’s ligament. The terminal part of the ileum opens on its inner and posterior aspect about two and a half inches above its lower end, and the vermiform appendix opens a short distance lower down. The caecum is usually completely invested by peritoneum, and lies upon the right ilio-psoas muscle. The ilio-caecal valve is formed by the invagination of a portion of the ileum into the cavity of the large intestine. The orifice therefor comes to lie at the top of a double fold of the wall, the upper fold being horizontal and the lower more or less vertical, with a horizontal slit between them. From these folds two bands pass off, called retinacula, and extend round a considerable portion of the interior of the caecum. The valve so formed is usually competent. The vermiform appendix is here seen lying to the upper and inner side of the caecum, and bent upon itself at an acute angle, while the terminal part of the ileum is in this specimen at a higher level than usual, having been displaced upwards by the distended pelvic colon. 1.

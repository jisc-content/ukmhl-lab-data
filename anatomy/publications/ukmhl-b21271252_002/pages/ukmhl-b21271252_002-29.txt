THE EDINBURGH STEREOSCOPIC ATLAS OF ANATOMY. EDINBURGH: T. C. & E. C. JACK; ahd 34 HENRIETTA STREET, LONDON, W.C. ABDOMEN. VISCERA—No. 7. The head of the pancreas lies in the hollow formed by the descending and transverse parts of the duodenum. The superior mesenteric vessels lie in a notch in it, and the portion below this notch is the uncinate process. The head is in relation, above, with the body of the gland, the pyloric region of the stomach, and the first part of the duodenum, and it lies in front of the bodies of the first and second lumbar vertebrae, from which it is separated by the aorta, inferior vena cava, and part of the diaphragm. The pancreatico-duodenal vessels ramify on its surface and between it and the duodenum. The portal vein is formed in front of it, and the common bile duct passes down behind it. The body of the pancreas is somewhat triangular in shape. The anterior surface is curved to receive the posterior surface of the stomach, and the posterior surface rests on the posterior abdominal wall, with the splenic vein intervening, while the inferior surface is in contact with the duodeno-jejunal flexure, and the colon. The tail of the organ passes to the spleen. Relation to peritoneum.—The anterior and inferior surfaces are covered by peritoneum, and the root of the transverse colon crosses the head and lies along the lower border of the body, while the root of the mesentery commences at the lower part of the head, thus creating a small area destitute of peritoneum. The figures indicate— 1. Gastro-epiploic artery, and first part of the duodenum. 2. Second part of the duodenum. 3. Third part of the duodenum. 4. Duodeno-jejunal flexure. 5. Inferior pancreatico-duodenal vessels. 6. Superior mesenteric vessels. 7. Tail of the pancreas. 8. Spleen. 9. Left kidney. 10. Under surface of stomach (empty). 11. Inferior mesenteric vessels. 12. Descending colon.

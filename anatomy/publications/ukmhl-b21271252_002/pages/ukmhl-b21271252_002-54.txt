JACK: and 34 HENRIETTA STREET, LONDON, W.C. ABDOMEN BLADDER. BLADDER, PROSTATE, AND SEMINAL VESICLES, SEEN FROM BEHIND. The prostate is an impaired glandular body, of the shape of a chestnut, the rounded tip of which projects downwards. The upper surface, or base, is directed upwards and forwards. It is pierced by the ejaculatory ducts. In front of that point it is in contact with the bladder, and, behind it, with the seminal vesicles. The posterior surface is flat, and is in relation to the anterior wall of the rectum. The surface of the prostate is smooth, and is covered behind and at the sides by a sheath of connective tissue, the fascia prostatse. The seminal vesicles are situated above and behind the prostate. They are paired, oblong, flattened bodies, with a nodular surface. They lie along the outer side of the termination of the vas deferens, and the upper end touches the terminal part of the ureter. The posterior surface is covered in its upper half or third by peritoneum. The terminal part of the vas deferens lies behind the bladder, and presents a spindle-shaped dilatation called the Ampulla. From the internal abdominal ring as far as to the middle of the ampulla, the vas deferens lies immediately under the peritoneum. 2. Posterior surface of the prostate. toneum. 3. Seminal vesicle. 7.

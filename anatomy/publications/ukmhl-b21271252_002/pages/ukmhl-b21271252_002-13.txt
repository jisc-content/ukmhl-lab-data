No. The external and internal oblique muscles have been reflected, and a portion of the spermatic cord cut away to show the posterior wall of the inguinal canal. This posterior wall is formed, from within outwards, by the triangular fascia, the conjoined tendon, and transversalis fascia. Through an opening in the transversalis fascia the deep epigastric vessels are seen running upwards in the inner side of the internal ring. The triangular fascia is a membranous structure, continuous with the aponeurosis of the external oblique of the opposite side, and forming an insertion for it into the crest of the pubis and the ilio-pectineal line. It lies behind the inner pillar of the external abdominal ring. The internal abdominal ring lies half an inch above, and to the inner side of the middle of Poupart’s ligament. It is the inlet for the inguinal canal, and at this point the transversalis fascia gives off a pouch- like process, which envelopes the spermatic cord. 3. Transversalis abdominis muscle. 9.

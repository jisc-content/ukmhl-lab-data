along in the substance of the gland to the right. It is joined by numerous small ducts which come ABDOMEN. The figures indicate:— THE EDINBURGH STEREOSCOPIC ATLAS OF ANATOMY. 7. Splenic artery.

PANCREATIC AND COMMON BILE-DUCTS, SEEN FROM THE FRONT. The ducts have been exposed by removing the greater part of the head of the pancreas, and cutting away a portion of the anterior surface of the body of the gland. The superior mesenteric vessels have also been removed. The main duct of the pancreas or canal of Wirsung begins at the tail of the gland and passes from the differents lobules, the majority of them entering it at a right angle. Within the head of the pancreas, the duct bends downwards, lies by the side of the common bile-duct, and ends by piercing its wall and thus entering the second part of the duodenum with it. There is frequently a small accessory duct which arises in the head of the gland and enters the duodenum at a higher level independently. „ The manner in which the splenic vessels enter the spleen along an elongated slit-like hssure, the hilum, should be noticed. 1. 2. 3. 4. 5.

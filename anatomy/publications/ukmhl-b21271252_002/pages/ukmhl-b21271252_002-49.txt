(SAME AS NUMBER 4, AFTER REMOVAL OF THE RECTUM AND OF THE LATERAL PART OF THE BLADDER WALL) TO SHOW THE NERVES AND VESSELS AND THE COURSE OF THE URETER AND VAS DEFERENS. The ureter enters the pelvis, crossing in front of the common iliac, or, as here, the external iliac vessels. It then passes dowmvards and slightly forwards to the base of the bladder, lying in front of the internal iliac artery and crossing the obturator vessels and nerve, and the obliterated hypogastric artery. It is crossed by the vas deferens, and ends by piercing the bladder wall very obliquely. The vas deferens pursues a curved course, first crossing the external lilac vessels, and then passing down and back by the side of the bladder, crossing the obliterated hypogastric artery, and then the ureter. It then turns inwards, and lies on the inner side of the seminal vesicle, and passes to the base of the prostate. Behind the ureter lies the internal iliac artery, which divides into an anterior and a posterior division, and from them branches are seen passing in different directions. 4. Division of common iliac artery. 5. Ureter crossing the external iliac vein. 9. Obliterated hypogastric artery. 10. Prostate.

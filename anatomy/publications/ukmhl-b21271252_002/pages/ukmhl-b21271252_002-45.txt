ABDOMEN. PELVIS—No. 1. THE EDINBURGH STEREOSCOPIC ATLAS OF ANATOMY. The figures indicate— 1. Ureters. 5. Round ligament of the uterus. EDINBURGH: T. C. & E. C. JACK; and 34 HENRIETTA STREET, LONDON, W.C. ABDOMEN PELVIS. PELVIC BRIM AND CAVITY, VIEWED FROM ABOVE AND IN FRONT. The pelvic peritoneal cavity in the female is divided into an anterior and posterior compartment by the uterus and a transverse fold of peritoneum which runs outwards from it on either side to the side wall of the pelvis, called the broad ligament. The ovary lies on the posterior aspect of this fold and is concealed from view. The posterior compartment or recto-vaginal pouch, or pouch of Douglas, is limited laterally by a fold of peritoneum which passes from the side of the uterus to the sacrum, called the utero-sacral fold. The uterus is, in this specimen, somewhat retroverted, and the loops of the pelvic colon fill the left part of the pouch of Douglas. In front of the uterus is the utero-vesical pouch of peritoneum. On either side of the promontory of the sacrum are seen the common iliac vessels, and crossing them, the ureters and the ovarian vessels, and on the left side, the terminal portion of the inferior mesenteric artery. Still further out, is the psoas muscle, and, in this case, there is a psoas parvus muscle lying in front of it. 2. Utero-sacral ligament. 6. Bladder beneath the peritoneum. 3.

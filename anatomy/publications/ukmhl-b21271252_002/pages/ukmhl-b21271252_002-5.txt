NOTE TO SECTION II The views in this Section illustrate the position and relation, as well as the shape, and in some cases the structure of the abdominal and some of the pelvic viscera. It has not been found possible to include in this Section the illus- trations of the anatomy of the female pelvis, and they are therefore held over to another Section, in which room will be found to include an adequate number of views of that important region. The enormous differences which are found in the position and relations of many of the abdominal viscera in different individuals, and which are of so great importance to the practical physician and surgeon, rendered the task of selecting what may be considered typical examples one of some diffi- culty, and it has been considered advisable to include some views which illustrate different conditions of several organs, such as the stomach, spleen, and bladder, etc. The extreme condition of the stomach in a female, illustrated in two views, will be of great interest to clinicians, since the history of the case which was supplied to me states that there were at no time symptoms pointing to any morbid change in the alimentary canal, but it may be stated that the condition is almost identical with that described by Arthur Keith, as a case of enteroptosis, or Glenardâ€™s disease, produced by tight-lacing. It is hoped that this series of views, illustrating the anatomy of the inguinal region will prove of special use to surgeons in connection with operative work for the cure of inguinal hernia.

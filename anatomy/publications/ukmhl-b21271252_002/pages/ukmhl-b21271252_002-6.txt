THE EDINBURGH STEREOSCOPIC ATLAS OF ANATOMY. The skin has been removed from the lower part of the abdominal wall and upper part of the thighs, and also, on the right side, the superficial fascia. The Superficial Fascia on the lower part of the anterior abdominal wall consists of two layers, a superficial fatty, and a deeper, more membranous layer. The former is continuous with the fatty superficial fascia of adjacent regions; the latter, in the reo-ion of the pubes, is carried down over the spermatic cord, and becomes one of the layers of the wall of the scrotum. Outside this, it passes over Poupart’s ligament, and blends with the fascia lata of the groin. This union limits the'spread of extravasated urine downwards to the thighs. Between the two layers are found some superficial vessels and cutaneous nerves. Above the symphisis pubis, there is a strong band of elastic tissue which passes down to be con- nected with the root of the penis and its suspensory ligament (5). Cutaneous Nerves are seen emerging through the aponeurosis of the external oblique muscle, the ilio-inguinal with the spermatic cord, through the external abdominal ring, the ilio-hypogastric a short distance above it, and the anterior branches of the lower intercostal nerves pierce the sheath of the rectus higher up.

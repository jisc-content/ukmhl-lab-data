They form two sepa- rate masses, one on either side of the head and gills, extending outwardly to the cartilaginous margins of the great fins; and, posteriorly, to the cartilage which separates the thoracic from the al dorainal cavity. Their form and the honey-comb embossments of their surfaces can be distinguished through the skin both of the dorsal and ventral aspects. The common inte- guments being removed, two strong fascial pulp, divided into numerous pentagonal prisms by the fascial processes just mentioned. These lie close together, parallel with one another, and perpendicularly between the dorsal and ventral surfaces of the fish, so that their extre- mities are separated from these surfaces only by their fascial and the common integuments. YVhen these are removed, the columns present something of the appearance of a honey-comb. The columns are longest next to the head and gills, and thence gra lually diminish outwardly, until, on the external margin, they are only

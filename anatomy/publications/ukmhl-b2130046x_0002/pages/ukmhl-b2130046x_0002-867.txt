849 ILIAC ARTERIES. to be pursued must be very much influenced by the convenience of the moment; but it would seem the better plan, where a choice can be made, to pass the needle first backward between the artery and the external iliac vein, and then inward behind the artery toward the pelvis, by which plan the veins will be more surely avoided, and more space will be ob- tained for seizing the ligature. In this as well as every operation upon the iliac arteries, the spermatic vessels must be kept in mind, inasmuch as they require atten- tion as much as the ureter ; they are usually, however, like it, removed with the peritoneum. Velpeau suggests the possibility of rupturing the ilio-lumbar artery in isolating the internal iliac, and the risk ought not to be overlooked. Ligature of the primitive iliac artery.â€”Any of the methods recommended, whether for the internal iliac or the external at a high point, will answer for the ligature of the primitive iliac. Guthrie gives the preference to that upon Abernethy's first plan in this as in the case of the internal iliac ; but it appears to me that here, at all events, the method of Roux or the modification of Cooper's operation is to be preferred ; for, beside that there does not exist in this case the reason for approximating the line of incision to the aperture of the pelvis, which applies to the internal iliac artery, the situation of the aneurismal tumour in front must render the direct line of incision less convenient than a lateral one, and by the adoption of the for- mer there must be incurred a great exposure of the peritoneum without a commensurate advantage ; the necessity also of stripping the membrane from all or a great part of the front of the aneurism, incurred by this plan, must be very objectionable. The length of incision recommended by Guthrie is five inches at the least, and may be required of even greater extent; thus Mott was obliged to extend it in his case upward and backward, about half an inch within the ilium, to eight inches: he adopted the principle of Cooper, commencing his first incision " just above the external ab- dominal ring, and carrying it in a semicircular direction half an inch above Poupart's liga- ment until it terminated a little beyond the anterior superior spinous process of the ilium, making it in extent about five inches." It is likely that a longer incision may be necessary in this method when applied to the primitive iliac than in that recommended by Guthrie; the greater length of the external incision is doubtless an objection of secondary impor- tance; but it is probable that, when the pri- mitive artery is to be tied, little will be gained by commencing the incision so low as was done by Mott, and that it would be more ad- vantageous to carry it upward rather than downward; such appears to have been the design of Crampton in the operation per- formed by him for the ligature of the primitive iliac, in which the line of incision was curved, concave toward the umbilicus, and extended from the anterior extremity of the last rib down- ward beyond the superior anterior spinous process of the ilium, and since unnecessary VOL. II. division of the abdominal parietes is of course to be avoided, and the leaving them entire at the lower part must be attended with two good results, viz. avoidance of the aneurism and less subsequent danger of pecuniary protrusion, I cannot but regard this plan as a desirable addition to the methods of proceeding when the primitive iliac is the vessel to be tied. In passing the ligature the difference of the relation between the vein and artery of the opposite sides is to be borne in mind, the former being external to the artery on the right and internal on the left, on both sides however being upon a posterior plane. The obstruction to the course of the opera- tion caused by the protrusion of the viscera is to be expected ; in that of Mott it is described as very great, while no mention is made of it in Crampton's. This difference was probably the consequence of the difference in the site of the wounds. The separation of the artery and vein is more easily effected than in the case of the external ihacs, because their investment is less thick and resisting. The diversity presented by the arteries of the opposite sides suggests a difference as to greater practicability and probability of success on one as compared with the other; the artery of the right side being longer than the left presents greater room for the application of a ligature at a sufficient distance, whether from the seat of the disease or from the origin of the vessel, while that of the left being more per- pendicular in its course and nearer to the left side of the body ought to be more easily ex- posed ; but it is to be recollected that this dis- position is not uniformly present. Before undertaking an operation upon any of the iliac arteries it will be advantageous to determine, so far as possible, the relation of the vessel, which is to be the subject of.it, to the superficial points of the abdominal wall. This must be understood to be intended only as an approximation, but by attention to the follow- ing circumstances it will prove sufficiently close to serve the desired purpose. The mean point, at which the aorta divides and the pri- mitive iliac commences, is half an inch below the umbilicus at its left side, and thit at which the external iliac terminates is midway between the symphysis pubis and the superior anterior spinous process of the ilium : of course a line connecting these points will define the general course of the primitive and external iliac arte- ries. The length of the primitive iliac being from two to three inches, the extent of its course may be determined by the subdivision of this line. The point of demarcation be- tween the primitive and external iliacs, and which will serve to mark the orfgin of the in- ternal and external, as well as the termination of the primitive, may be further determined by a line extending from the crest of the ilium about one inch and a half behind its anterior superior spinous process to a similar point on the other side; such a line will traverse the sacro-vertebral articulation posterior to the di- vision of the primitive iliac, and by its decus- sation with that before mentioned will mark 3 K

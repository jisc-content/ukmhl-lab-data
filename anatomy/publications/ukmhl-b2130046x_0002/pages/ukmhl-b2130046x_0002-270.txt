FEMORAL ARTERY. 256 separation of the artery from the vein: the best method of effecting this, as it seems to the author, will be, after having opened the sheath directly over the centre of the artery either by a touch of the knife or first nipping up a part of it with the forceps ; making an aperture into it with the blade of the knife held horizon- tally, and extending the opening upon a di- rector to the length of " three-quarters or an inch," as recommended by Guthrie ; then with the forceps to take hold of each portion of the sheath in turn and drawing it to its own side, outward or inward as the case may be, to de- tach the artery from it with the extremity of a director or of the aneurism-needle, moving the extremity of the instrument gently upward and downward at the same time that the vessel is carried, by means of it, in the opposite direc- tion from the side of the sheath which is in the forceps ; by this proceeding the artery may be easily and safely insulated almost, if not quite, round, and with little if any disturbance to it. That done, the needle and ligature may be carried round the artery: the performance of this, which is the most delicate step in the operation, will be found much facilitated by the separation of the artery as recommended ; in fact, little more will then remain than to pass the needle, the passage having been al- ready opened. In doing so it will be well to hold the inner portion of the sheath, with the forceps, inward and backward, by which the vein will be drawn away from the artery, and at the same time to insinuate the blunt extre- mity of the aneurism-needle round the artery from within outward, because of the situation of the vein, moving it, if any obstruction be encountered, upward and downward, while it is also carried forward, and bearing the artery somewhat outward with it at the same time; when the extremity of the needle has appeared on the outside of the artery it may be liberated, if necessary, by a touch of the scalpel upon it. In the execution of this manoeuvre two acci- dents are to be avoided, viz. injury of the vein, and inclusion of the saphenus nerve: the close juxta-position and attachment of the former to the artery render much care neces- sary to leave it uninjured; but the proceeding recommended will, if carefully executed, cer- tainly preserve it from being wounded. The saphenus nerve is here on the outside of the artery, and might be included within the liga- ture if the extremity of the needle were carried too far outward ; the operator should therefore assure himself, before tying the ligature, that the nerve has not been included; but the risk of this accident ought not to be great at this part of the artery's course, certainly not so much so as at a lower point, inasmuch as the nerve has as yet hardly entered the femoral canal, and is therefore separated from the ar- tery by more or less of its outer wall; and with the precautions recommended in insulating the vessel and passing the ligature it will almost certainly be excluded at every part: the possi- bility of the accident is, however, not to be lost sight of. The needle having been carried round the artery, the ligature is to be taken hold of with the forceps, and one end drawn out, after which the needle is to be withdrawn. The advantages of the part chosen by Scarpa for this operation are numerous and obvious : 1. the artery is nearer to the surface and has fewer coverings; there is therefore less to be divided in order to bring it into view; 2. the vessel being more superficial, its pulsations can be more distinctly felt and its course ascer- tained previous to operation, a guide wanting in the lower parts of the thigh; 3. " the ope- ration is done," as Guthrie observes, " on that part of the artery which is not covered by muscle, and all interference with the sartorius is avoided : this method obviates all discussion as to placing the ligature on the outside of the muscle." The plan of cutting upon the out- side of the sartorius in the upper stage of the artery must be, if contemplated by any, a pro- ceeding hardly defensible in the ordinary dis- position of the muscle, for all the reasons ad- vanced already against its use in the second stage apply with much greater force to it in the former case; but it is at the same time to be observed that the distance of the point at which the muscle crosses the femoral artery is not ab- solutely regular, and that great deviation in this respect might render it necessary even to cut upon the outer margin of the muscle in order to expose the artery in the first third of its course. The distance from Poupart's liga- ment at which the muscle ordinarily crosses is, according to the stature, from three and a half to five inches, but it may in certain cases be found to cross so much sooner that the artery could not be exposed below the origin of the profunda without displacing the muscle ; thus Burns* mentions that he has seen, in conse- quence of malformation of the pelvis, the artery covered by the muscle, before it had reached two inches below the ligament, and the author has witnessed the same from retraction of the thighs, consequent apparently upon long con- finement to bed; in the latter case it would certainly have been more easy to expose the vessel from the outer than from the inner side of the muscle; but such cases are to be re- garded only as exceptions to be borne in mind, but not to influence our general conduct. 4. The performance of the last and most deli- cate parts of the operation must be much more easy and less embarrassed, the interference of the sartorius being avoided; while, on the other hand, all apprehension on account of the pro- funda is removed, since that vessel seldom, if ever, arises farther than two inches from Pou- part's ligament, and the course of the case after operation is more likely to be favourable and exempt from untoward occurrences, since much less violence must be done, and the superven- tion of injurious inflammation or its conse- quences thereby prevented. The operation for taking up the femoral ar- tery above the origin of the profunda is not often required, and, except in case of wound, may pro- bably give place altogether to that of tying the external iliac : it presents no advantage over * Op. cit. p. 321.

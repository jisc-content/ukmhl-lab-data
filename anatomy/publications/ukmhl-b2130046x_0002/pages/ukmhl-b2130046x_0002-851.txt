ILIAC ARTERIES. 833 may be deficient or more developed, the obtu- rator will be derived principally or altogether from the internal iliac or from the epigastric ; when both are equally so it will present the double origin. 2. The gluteal artery, denominated also posterior iliac, is the largest branch of the internal iliac, and arises from, or is the conti- nuation of the posterior division of that vessel; it runs downward, backward, and outward, until it reaches the superior part of the great sciatic notch; it then changes the direction of its course, and making a turn passes directly out- Ward between the lumbo-sacral and the anterior branch of the first sacral nerves, and escapes from the pelvis through the upper part of the notch above the pyriformis muscle, and accom- panied by the superior gluteal nerve. As soon as the artery has escaped from within the pelvis and gained its external aspect, it divides into branches. The trunk of this artery, as it is the largest, so is it the shortest of the branches of the iliac; within the pelvis it corresponds ex* ternally to the lumbo-sacral nerve, internally to the rectum, and inferiorly to the first sacral nerve and the pyriformis; it gives small branches to the rectum, the pyriformis, and the surrounding cellular structure ; at times it also gives off the llio-lumbar, the lateral sacral, or the obturator. At its exit posteriorly from the pelvis it is situate between the adjoining margins of the pyriformis and the gluteus minimus, and it is covered by the gluteus maximus. The branches into which it divides after its escape are two, a superficial and deep one. The first passes outward and upward between the glutei maximus and medius, and divides into numerous branches, which are distributed to these muscles, particularly to the maximus; many of them descend in its substance toward its insertion, and there meet branches of the circumflex (femoral) and sciatic arteries; others pass through the muscle, become superficial, and supply the integument and subcutaneous fat; others again pass onward, traverse the attachment of the gluteus maximus to the sa- crum, and are distributed to the muscles and integuments of the posterior sacral region. The second, the deep branch, passes outward, upward, and forward, between the glutei medius and minimus muscles toward the superior anterior spinous process of the ilium in an arched course around the attachment of the gluteus minimus. As it proceeds it gives off numerous branches upward from its convexity and downward from its concavity; the former are distributed to the gluteus medius; the lat- ter are chiefly two, of which one runs forward and downward toward the anterior part of the great trochanter between the two muscles, gives branches to both, and finally throws itself into the gluteus medius near the trochanter, and is consumed in it: it communicates freely with the external circumflex artery. The other runs downward and forward toward the back of the trochanter, lies for some way upon the gluteus minimus, or over the interval between it and the pyriformis, gives branches to both muscles, VOL. IF. and then gains the surface of the oS innomina- tum by traversing the gluteus or by passing between it and the pyriformis, pursues its course upon the bone, to which it gives an artery, above the llio-femoral articulation, to the capsule of which it also gives branches, and approaching the anterior inferior spinous process of the ilium it terminates in supplying the gluteus minimus, and anastomosing with the external circumflex artery. The deep division of the gluteal artery hav- ing run round the line of attachment of the gluteus minimus, and reached the superior anterior spinous process, terminates in an anas- tomosis with the circumflex iliac, the ilio-lumbar, and the external circumflex arteries; branches also turn over the crest of the ilium, and so communicate with the iliolumbar. The deep division, also, furnishes a nutritious artery to the ilium, the canal for which is to be seen on the dorsum of the bone. The branches of the gluteal artery are numerous and large ; in order to expose them the gluteus maximus having been dissected clean may be detached from the femur and raised toward the sacrum, when the branches may be displayed running in every direction as from an axis. The situation of the gluteal artery external to the pelvis permits the trunk of the vessel to be secured; the gluteus maximus being the only muscle by which it is covered, it may be exposed by the division of that muscle; the situation of the artery may be first determined " by drawing a line from the posterior spinous process of the ilium to the miclspace between the tuberosity of the ischium and the great trochanter; if we divide this line into three, we shall find the gluteal artery emerging from the pelvis at the juncture of its upper and middle thirds."* The ligature of this artery in case of aneurism has been very much superseded in favour of that of the inter- nal or even of the primitive iliac, the latter of which has been tied by Guthrie for aneurism of the gluteal artery ; the propriety of this pro- ceeding, however, may be questioned; the ligature of either the internal or the primitive iliac must be regarded a more serious operation than that of the gluteal, and the latter has proved so efficacious in the many instances in which it has been had recourse to, that, while it is practicable, the other can be hardly justi- fiable. 3. 'The ischiatic artery arises from the ante- rior division of the internal iliac, which, after having given off its internal branches, divides into two, of which the posterior and larger is the ischiatic ; it is the second in size of the branches of the iliac, being smaller than the gluteal; but in the adult it appears, for the most part, in- direction the continuation of the original vessel; its course within the pelvis is long; it descends, at the same time inclining forward, and forming a curve convex backward, toward the inferior part of the great sciatic notch, and escapps through it from the pelvis superior to the sacro-sciatic ligaments and infe- rior to the pyrifoimis muscle; it then descends * Harrison. 3 I

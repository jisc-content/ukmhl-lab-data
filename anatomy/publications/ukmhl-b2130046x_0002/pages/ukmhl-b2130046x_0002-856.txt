833 ILIAC ARTERIES. designation adopted by Chaussier, which, while it recognises the identity of the vessel throughout its course, sufficiently marks the grounds of distinction between its two portions. The external is somewhat smaller than the primitive iliac, but in the adult considerably larger than the internal ; its direction is down- ward, outward, and forward, and hence it forms with the primitive iliac a curve convex backward, and seems the continuation of that vessel; its length is from three to four inches, and during its course it forms one or more Curvatures. Such is the disposition of the vessel in the adult; but in the younger subject it is different in some respects; in the foetus the external iliac is considerably smaller than the internal, and does not seem the continuation of the primitive iliac, which at that epoch is continued into the internal; the external appearing rather as a branch or a smaller division from a trunk common to the other two ; after birth the relative disposition of the iliacs gradually changes, until they acquire that of the adult. The relations of the external iliac artery are as follows ; posteriorly, it corresponds through the upper half of its course to the lateral part of the superior aperture of the pelvis; inclining outwards as it descends, it corresponds in its lower half to the os innominatum, and the more perfectly, the nearer it approaches the crural arch, at which part it is placed in front of the bone, crossing it nearly at right angles, and separated from it by an interval occupied by the psoo-iliac aponeurosis and the psoas muscle. At its outset the external iliac vein is directly behind the artery, and on its right side, also the commencement of the primitive iliac vein, the artery crossing the junction of the two vessels, on that side, obliquely in its descent; during- the remainder of its course, the vein, though posterior to it, is also internal; through- out the lower half of its course it lies upon the psoo-iliac aponeurosis, supported by the os innominatum, and at first separated from the bone only by the aponeurosis; but as it pro- ceeds separated from it also by the tendon of the psoas parvus when present, and by the inner mar- gin of the psoas magnus, it is very near to the os innominatum, external to the ilio-pectineal emi- nence, and being here supported by bone, and made steady by its connections it may with certainty be compressed and its circulation perfectly commanded. Internally, the artery corresponds above to the aperture of the pelvis, to its viscera more or less intimately, according to their state of distension or contraction, and also to the small intestines which descend into it; in the lower half of its course, the external iliac vein, which at its outset is behind or beneath the artery, is internal, though still some- what posterior to it ;at the crural arch the artery and vein are nearly upon the same level, being supported by the os innominatum ; the artery however somewhat anterior to the vein, but as the vein recedes from the arch it inclines less inward than the artery, and at the same time retreats more from the surface; and hence it gradually gets more completely behind the artery until at its junction with the primitive vein it is concealed by it anteriorly. The artery is covered by peritoneum, upon its inner side through a considerable part of its course; above the membrane covers it com- pletely ; but as it descends the extent becomes less in consequence of the ascent of the vein ; which thus gradually intervenes between the artery and the membrane, and removes the latter from it altogether in the lower part of its course. When the primitive iliac divides at a high point, the ureter descends into the pelvis internal to the external iliac immediately after its origin; this occurs more frequently upon the right side than the left. Beneath the perito- neum the artery is covered by an investment, of which presently again, attaching it superiorly to the peritoneum and inferiorly to the vein. Externally the artery corresponds through its entire course to the psoas magnus muscle, but it is separated from it by the psoo-iliac fascia, to which it is connected by its immediate invest- ment ; the relation of the artery and the muscle are, however, somewhat different at the upper and lower parts of the vessel's course; above, the artery does not lie upon the muscle, but rests against its inner side along its anterior part, while inferiorly it lies upon the inner margin of the muscle at the same time that it rests against it externally. The genito-crural nerve is situate along the outer side of the artery; this nerve, long and slender,a branch of the lumbar plexus, descends upon the psoas, extenal to the artery, and at first at a little distance from it; as it proceeds, it approaches thevessel,andliesclosetoitenveloped in the fascia propria; at the lower part of its course its genital branch frequently passes in front of the artery. The anterior crural vein is also external to the artery; but it is considerably posterior to it, separated from it by the outer margin of the psoas, between which and the iliacus it lies, and also by the fascia iliaca, which covers it; the nerve is about half an inch from the artery at the crural arch; as it recedes from the arch the distance increases. In front, the artery is covered immediately by a cellular investment, formed by the sub- peritoneal cellular structure—-the fascia propria — upon the posterior wall of the iliac fossa; this encloses both the artery and the vein and at the same time connects them; it varies in its condition according to the subject, in some it appears a dense, but still cellular expansion, in others from the deposition of fat it forms an adipose stratum, which however still presents a more condensed character in immediate con- tact with the vessels ; it adheres closely to the surface of the fascia iliaca upon either side of the vessels and thus attaches them to it; it is prolonged upward upon the primitive iliac vessels, and below, it ascends between the peritoneum and the fascia transversalis upon the anterior abdominal wall; upon the primi- tive iliac it is very thin and proportionally weak ; but as it descends it increases in thick- ness and strength until at the lower part of the

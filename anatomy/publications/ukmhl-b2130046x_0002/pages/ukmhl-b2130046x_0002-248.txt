FAT. 234 dissolves in the fat and volatile oils, and is in part deposited as the solution cools. Alcohol always extracts a small portion of oil from the spermaceti of commerce; as the boiling alco- holic solution cools, it deposits the purified spermaceti in white crystalline scales, and in this state, Chevreul terms it cetine. Cetine does not fuse under 120°; it forms, on cooling, a lamellar, shining, inodorous, and insipid mass, which is volatile at high temperatures, and may be distilled without decomposition. It burns with a brilliant white flame, and dis- solves in about four parts of absolute alcohol; it is very difficultly saponified; digested for several days at a temperature between 120° and 190°, with its weight of caustic potassa and two parts of water, it yields inargarate and oleate of potassa, and a peculiar fatty matter, which Chevreul calls ethal,* and which amounts to about 40 per cc7it. of the cetine used. To ob- tain it in an insulated state the results of the saponification of cetine are decomposed by tartaric acid, which separates the margaric and oleic acid, together with the ethal; the fat acids are saturated with hydrate of baryta, and the resulting mixture well washed with water to separate all excess of base; it is then well dried, and digested in cold alcohol or ether, which takes up the ethal and leaves the barvtic salts ; the former is then obtained by evapora- tion of the solvent. Ethal is a solid, transpa- rent, crystalline, fatty matter, without smell or taste; when melted alone it congeals at 120° into a crystalline cake; it is so volatile that it passes over in vapour when distilled with yvater. It burns like yvax, and is soluble in all propor- tions in pure alcohol at a temperature below 140°. It readily unites by fusion with fat and the fat acids, and yvhen pure is not acted upon by a solution of caustic potassa; but if mixed with a little soap it then forms a flexible yel- lowish compound, fusible at about 145°, and yielding an emulsive hydrate with boiling water. The ultimate composition of train oil, sper- maceti oil, spermaceti, cetine, and ethal, are shewn in the following tables :— TRAIN OIL. SPERMACETI OIL. ('ai bon.. Hydrogen Oxygen..

Phoccnine is a peculiar fatty substance contained in the oil of certain species of por- poise (Delphinus phocena and globiceps). When this oil is saponified, it yields margaric and oleic acid and cetine, and a peculiar vola- tile acid obtained by a process similar to that for separating hircic acid, and which has been termed phocenic acid.* It is a thin, colourless, strong-smelling oil, of a peculiar acrid, acid, and aromatic taste; its specific gravity is .932 ; it does not congeal yvhen cooled doyvn to 14°. Its boiling point is above 212°. In this state it is an hydrate, containing 9 per cent, of water, from which it has not been freed. It is solu- ble in all proportions in pure alcohol. The neutral salts of this acid (plwecnatesj are inodorous, but any free acid, even the car- bonic, in a gentle heat, evolves the odour of the phocenic acid. Heated in the air they exhale an aromatic odour, dependent upon the forma- tion of a peculiar product. By dry distillation they blacken, evolve olefiant gas and carbonic acid, and a thin, odorous, yellow oil, insoluble in potassa. The pliocenates of potassa, soda, and ammonia, are deliquescent; the phocenate of baryta forms efflorescent prismatic crystals ; and that of lime, small acicular prisms. The neutral phocenate of lead, evaporated in vacuo, yields flexible lamellar crystals, which are fusible and easily become basic when heated ; the subphocenate of lead is difficultly soluble and crystallisable, and decomposed by the car- bonic acid of the air. According to Chevreul, the anhydrous pho- cenic acid (as existing in its anhydrous salts) consists of Atoms. Equivalents, Theory. Experiment.

The Jut of birds has been but little exa- mined ; Chevreul states that the fat of gee* concretes after fusion at about 80° into a gra- nular mass of the consistency of butter. Ac- cording to llraconnot it yields by pressure at 32°, 0.68 of yellowish elain, having the odour and taste peculiar to this kind of fat, and 0.32 of stearin, fusible at 110°, and soluble in rather more than three parts of anhydrous alcohol. When saponified, it yields margaric and oleic acid and glycerine. • The same acid is contained, according to Chevreul, in the ripe berries of the Viburnum ojiutut.

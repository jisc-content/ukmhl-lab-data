ECHINODERMATA. 37 Fig. 16. Asterias rubens: three rays openedâ€”in the one, at A, cceca cut short to shew the vesicles of the feet, d, d, and one ovary, o; g, g, cceca, g' g', coeca inflated. into it from above, which are probably secre- ting organs. The coeca are thin and mem- branous like the stomach; each consists of a central tube with lateral branches, which in their turn are lobed or branched, and terminate in cellular dilatations. The two coeca of a ray sometimes communicate with the stomach by a short single tube (A); in other cases they have separate orifices. They do not reach so far as the distal end of the ray; each one is attached to the roof by what might be called a double mesentery, for the peritoneum forms here two duplicatures (Jigs. 12 and 16, n,) between the coecum and the roof of the ray. A space is inclosed between these duplicatures which opens into the central part of the body at the root of the coeca. Such is the structure in the Asterias, but in some other genera belonging to the tribe of Asteroidea it is different. In Ophiura, Eu- ryule, and Comatula, in which the rays are very long and slender, the cceca are mere cel- lular dilatations of the stomach, and do not extend into the rays. Comatula moreover dif- fers from all the tribe, inasmuch as its alimen- tary canal has two openings, a mouth and anus, situated near to each other on the ventral sur- face. The mouth of the star-fish is very dilatable, so as to admit large mollusca in their entire

ILIAC ARTERIES. 842 sing the external iliac with least clanger to the peritoneum, viz. on the outside of the deep inguinal ring and close as possible to the crural arch. The peritoneum of the anterior wall of the fossa is weaker toward the middle line than externally; it presents toward the abdo- men two depressions or recesses denominated by Velpeau " fossettes inguinales," internal and external; these depressions vary very much in their depth, sometimes hardly perceptible, at others of considerable depth and capacity, more especially the external, which is much the larger; they are produced by the projection of the umbilical ligament from the interior of the abdominal wall, and the reflection of the peritoneum round the ligament, by means of which a triangular fold, wide in proportion to the degree to which the ligament projects, is formed, the base of which is below, the apex above toward the umbilicus, and in the free edge of which the ligament is contained ; this fold separates the depressions, one being external to it, the other internal, between it and the urachus ; the external one, the bottom of which tends forward and inward, corresponds to some point of the posterior wall of the in- guinal canal, but its precise relation to it is uncertain, because of the irregularity of the position of the umbilical ligament; at times it is identical with another slight depression situate on the outside of the epigastric vessels, which marks the situation of the deep inguinal ring, the ligament in such case being behind these vessels; at others it corresponds to the wall of the canal, to the superficial inguinal or the deep femoral rings, the ligament being in these latter cases internal to the epigastric vessels. The branches of the external iliac artery de- serving of particular attention are usually two, the anterior or circumflex iliac and the epigas- tric arteries; throughout the superior part of its course the artery gives only minute branches to the peritoneum, the cellular tissue, the psoas muscles, and the lymphatics; the other two, which have been mentioned, are given off im- mediately before the artery escapes from the abdomen. They arise at a very short distance above the crural arch, sometimes so high as three-fourths of an inch from it, at others at it, and sometimes again below the arch from the femoral; they proceed one from the outer and the other from the inner side of the vessel^ sometimes opposite to each other, at others in- differently one above the other: occasionally they are given off from a trunk common to both; they are nearly of equal size, but for the most part the epigastric is larger than the cir- cumflex. 1. The anterior or circumflex iliac artery, (arteria circumflexa iliaca or ilii; Fr. artere circorijiexe iliaque., ou iliaqvc ou anterieure,) arises from the outer side of the external iliac on a level with or somewhat lower than the epigastric; it runs outward and upward above and paiallel to the crural arch as far as the superior anterior spinous process of the ilium; during this course it lies upon the fascia iliaca superficial to the psoas and iliacus mus- cles and the anterior crural nerve, and it is inclosed in a triangular canal, formed behind by the fascia iliaca, below and above by la- minae of the fascia transversalis, which divides at its union with the former, in order to inclose the artery. When the anterior abdominal wall has been thrown down, and the peritoneum with the fascia propria removed from the iliac fossa, the course of the vessel may be traced by a white line, which marks the union of the two fasciae, extending from the middle of the crural arch upward and outward within about three- fourths of an inch of the spinous process of the ilium; by the division of the fascia trans- versalis along this line the artery will be ex- posed. During its course toward the spinous process the artery gives branches to the psoas and iliacus, the transversalis and oblique muscles, and to the inguinal glands ; near the process it gives upward a considerable branch, which ascends in the anterior wall of the abdomen between the internal oblique and transversalis muscles, in front of the spinous process, serving with its accompanying veins as a guide in dis- section by which to distinguish between the two muscles; it divides into branches, which are distributed to the muscles, as also to the structures, which cover and line them, and communicate with branches of the epigastric, lumbar, and intercostal arteries. The circumflex artery pursues its course and runs backward around and within the crest of the ilium, internal to the transversalis muscle ; during its course it gives branches inward to the iliacus muscle which anastomose with si- milar branches from the iliolumbar, and up- ward to the lateral abdominal muscles, which are partly distributed to them, partly turn over the crest of the ilium and communicate with the gluteal artery, and in part communicate with the lumbar or intercostal arteries. Finally, the artery, very much reduced in size, anasto- moses freely with the termination of the ilio- lumbar, which pursues a similar course in a contrary direction around the interior of the crest of the ilium. The circumflex artery has been found by Monro to present an irregularity deserving of notice; he has seen a branch from it, nearly as large as the epigastric, pass under the crural arch, about two inches from the symphysis pubis, and there divide into branches, which were distributed upon the symphysis and the fat and skin over the arch. 2. The epigastric artery, (Fr. artere epigiis- trique, A. sus-pubienne) arises from the in- ternal and rather anterior part of the iliac artery, near to the crural arch; the distance of its origin from the arch, however, is liable to variety ; for the most part it occurs about half an inch above it, but it is frequently nearer to it, or even at it, and occasionally it is below it, arising from the femoral artery; it is given off, as has been stated, from that part of the iliac, which is left uncovered by peri- toneum, and its point of origin is posterior to, sometimes above, sometimes on a level with, and at others below the reflection of the mem-

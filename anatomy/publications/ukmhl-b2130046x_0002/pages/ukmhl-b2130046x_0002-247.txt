The Jut of beef when melted begins to concrete at 100°: it requires for solution 40 parts of boiling alcohol, and contains about three-fourths its weight of stearin, which is obtained by stirring the melted fat whilst it is concreting, and then pressing it in woollen cloths at a temperature of about 95", by which the elain is squeezed out, together with a por- tion of stearin, which is deposited at a lower temperature, for the elain does not congeal at 32°. The stearin is white, granularly crystal- line, fusible at 112°, and may be cooled to 100° before it congeals, when its temperature rises to 112°. It looks and burns like wax. 100 parts of alcohol dissolve 15 of this stearin : when saponified, it yields 0.95 of fat acids, which fuse at 130°. The elain of beef fat is colour- less and almost inodorous, and soluble in less than its weight of boiling alcohol. Candles made of the stearin of this fat, with a small addition of wax to destroy its brittle and crys- talline texture, are little inferior to wax candles. 4. Neat's foot oil is obtained by boiling the lower ends of the shin-bones of the ox, after the removal of the hair and hoofs, in water. This oil remains fluid below"32°, and after the sepa- ration of the stearin, is used for greasing turret- clocks, which are often so exposed to cold as to freeze other oils. 5. Gout's fat is characterized by its peculiar colour, which seems to depend upon the pre- sence of a distinct fatty matter, which, in the separation of the stearin and elain, is asso- ciated with the latter, and which Chevreul has called hircin. When the elain is saponified, a liquid volatile acid is formed, which may be separated as follows: four parts of the fat are made into soap with one of hydrate of potassa dissolved in four of water : the soap is after- wards diluted, and decomposed by phosphoric or tartaric acid, by which the fat acids are sepa- rated : these are distilled with water, taking care that the contents of the retort do not boil over: the distilled liquid is saturated with hydjate of baryta, evaporated to dryness, and decomposed by distillation with sulphuric acid diluted with its weight of water: the acid is separated in the form of a colourless volatile oil which floats upon the distilled liquid; Chevreul terms it hircic acid: it congeals at 32°: it has the odour of the goat, blended with that of acetic acid ; it reddens litmus, dissolves difficultly in water, and readily in alcohol: it forms distinct salts with the bases : the salt of ammonia has a strong hircine odour: that of potassa is deliquescent, and that of baryta difficultly soluble in water. 6. Mutton fat is whiter than that of beef, and acquires a peculiar odour by exposure to air; when melted it begins to concrete at about 100°. It requires 44 parts of boiling alcohol for solution. Its stearin, when fused, begins to congeal at 100°, and its temperature rises on solidification to 113°. 100 parts of alcohol dissolve 16 of it. Its elain is colourless, slightly odorous, sp. gr. 0.913, and 80 parts of it are soluble in 100 of boiling alcohol. When saponified, it yields a very small quantity of hircic acid. This species of fat, together with its stearin and elain, are composed as fol- lows :— FAT. STEARIN. ELAIN.

Whale oil, or train oil, (from whale blub- ber,) sp. gr. .927, when cooled to 32°, deposits stearin ; the filtered oil is then soluble in 0.82 of boiling alcohol. Aided by heat it dissolves arsenious acid, oxide of copper, and oxide of lead ; sulphuric and muriatic acids render the latter combination turbid, nitric acid tinges it dark brown with effervescence; and it is coa- gulated by potassa and soda. This oil is easily saponified when mixed with 0.6 its weight of hydrated potassa, and five parts of water; the soap is brown, soluble in water, and when de- composed by tartaric acid and the sour liquid distilled, it yields traces of phoeenic acid, also glycerine, and oleic and margarir, but no stearic acid: these acids are accompanied by a greasy substance which has the odour of the oil. The stearic portion of train oil, when freed from adhering elain by washing with weak alcohol,concretes, after having been fused, at a temperature between 70° and 80°; it is soluble in 1.8 parts of boiling alcohol, and is deposited in crystals as it cools, leaving a dark thick mother-liquor. When saponified, 100 parts yield 85 of margaric and oleic acids, 4 of a brown substance infusible at 212°, and per- fectly soluble in boiling alcohol, 7 of bitterish glycerine, and traces of phoeenic acid. 8. Spermaceti oil, the produce of the sper- maceti whale,* is lodged in the cartilaginous cells of a bony cavity on the upper part of the head ; as it cools, it deposits its peculiar stearic portion in the form of spermaceti; this sub- stance is further separated by pressure in wool- len bags from the oil, and is then washed with a weak solution of caustic potassa, melted in boiling water, and strained; it is commonly cast into oblong blocks, and if the interior liquid portion is drawn off when the exterior has concreted, the cavity exhibits upon its sur- faces a beautiful crystalline texture. Sperma- ceti, as it occurs in commerce, is in semi-trans- parent brittle masses of a foliated fracture, and soapy to the touch ; it has a slight odour and a greasy taste, and when long kept becomes yel- lowish and rancid. Its specific gravity is .943; it fuses at about 114°. 100 parts of boiling' alcohol, sp.gr. .823, dissolve 3.5 spermaceti, and about 0.9 is deposited on cooling. Warm ether dissolves it so copiously, that the solution conc-etes on cooling; by the aid of heat, it * Physetcr macrocephalus, or Cachalot.

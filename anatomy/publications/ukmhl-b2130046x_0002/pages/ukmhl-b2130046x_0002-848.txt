ILIAC ARTERIES. 830 division of the internal iliac, at times from the iliac itself; at times from the gluteal, occa- sionally from the primitive iliac, and frequently by a trunk common to it and the lateral sacral; from its origin, which is somewhat below the base of the sacrum, it runs upward, outward, and backward toward the iliac fossa, passes in front of the sacro-iliac articulation and the lumbo-sacral nerve and external to the obturator nerve; having surmounted the outlet of the pelvis it passes behind the psoas muscle, the external iliac vessels and the anterior crural nerve, and emerges from behind them at the superior and internal part of the fossa, where it divides. As the artery emerges from the pelvis it gives off' a branch which descends along the brim, gives small branches to the inside of the psoas, and finally anastomoses with a branch from the epigastric artery ; while concealed by the psoas it gives branches to it and the iliacus internus. Finally it divides into two sets of branches, superior or ascending, and external or transverse; the former ascend beneath the psoas, supply it, the iliacus and the quadratus lumborum, send a branch into the vertebral canal through one of the inferior intervertebral foramina, and finally communicate with the inferior lumbar arteries. The external set pass outward into the iliac fossa, and are distin- guished into two, a superficial and deep; the former run across the iliacus muscle, superficial to it and beneath the iliac fascia, supply the muscle and anastomose freely with corres- ponding branches from the circumflex branch of the external iliac artery : the superior of the superficial branches runs round the crest of the ilium within its inner edge, as it proceeds it gives branches downward to the iliacus and upward to the quadratus lumborum, the trans- versalis and oblique muscles, some of which turn over the crest and communicate with branches of the gluteal artery ; finally it ends in a direct and free anastomosis with the ultimate branch of the circumflex artery, the fossa having thus an artificial circle formed around it in- ternally, between these branches and the original iliacs. The branches of the deep set pass into the substance of the iliacus muscle, and between it and the bone, and are distributed to the muscle, the periosteum, and the bone, one of them entering the ilium through the canal to be observed at the bottom of the fossa; their deep branches also communicate with the circumflex iliac, the gluteal and the external circumflex femoral arteries. Sometimes there are two ilio-lumbar arteries. 2. The lateral sacral artery may be either single or double, and arises either from the posterior division of the iliac, from the iliac itself on its inner side, from the gluteal, or the sciatic, and frequently in common with the ilio-lumbar : it runs downward, and inward in front of the lateral part of the sacrum, the sacral nerves at their exit from the anterior sacral foramina, and the pyriform muscle external to the middle sacral artery and the sympathetic nerve ; it descends to the extremity of the sacrum and then anastomoses with the middle sacral and the artery of the other side ; at tunes instead of terminating thus it enters the sacral canal through the third or fourth foramen and is distributed internally. Its branches are dis- tinguished into two sets, an anterior or internal and a posterior or external. The former are distributed to the sacral nerves within the pelvis, to the pyriform muscle, to the pelvic cellular tissue and glands, to the levator ani muscle and to the sacrum. The posterior are the larger, they are usually four, but at times more numerous, two branches sometimes taking the same course; they pass backward along the sacral nerves, through the sacral foramina, into the canal, and then divide into two, of which one is distributed within the canal to the nerves and their ganglia, to the membranes and the sacrum; the other escapes backward through the posterior sacral foramen, and is distributed upon the back of the sacrum in the sacro-vertebral channel, anastomosing with the adjoining vessels. 3. The yniddle hemorrhoidal artery is some- times wanting, its place being supplied by branches from the other divisions of the iliac; it is of about the same size as the previous arteries, and varies very much in its source, arising from the anterior division of the iliac, from that vessel itself or from the pudic, the sciatic or lateral sacral arteries, it runs down- ward, forward, and inward along the side and front of the rectum, at first between the intes- tine and the levator ani, and then between it and the fundus of the bladder in man and the vagina in the female, and divides into branches, of which the greater part are distributed to the rectum, anastomosing with the branches of the superior hemorrhoidal from above and with those of the inferior hemorrhoidal from below ; others are distributed to the fundus of the bladder, the prostate and vesiculas in man, and to the vagina in the female. 4. The vesical arteries are subject to great variety ; they are numerous and smaller than the last described : they are distinguished by Harrison into three sets, inferior, middle, and superior ; the inferior set consists of those branches given to the fundus of the bladder by the middle hemorrhoidal, pudic, and sciatic arteries; the superior, furnished by the um- bilical, are two or more in number, and are distributed to the superior region of the bladder, but the middle is a single vessel larger than the others, and given off by the iliac artery, though frequently arising from some of its branches, particularly the umbilical: it is en- titled by Chaussier " vesico-prostatique:" it passes downward and inward to the fundus of the bladder, and then divides into branches distributed to the bladder, and in the male also to the prostate, the vesiculas and neck of the bladder. 5. The umbilical artery. In the adult sub- ject a small arterial canal usually from an inch and a half to two inches and a half long ex- tends from the termination of the internal iliac, or from one of its branches to the superior lateral part of the bladder; there it is continued with, or seems to have attached to it superiorly the umbilical ligament, the artery appearing

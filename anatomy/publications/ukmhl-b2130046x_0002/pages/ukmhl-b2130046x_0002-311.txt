297 FIFTH PAIR OF NERVES. Vidian passes into the interior of the packet, crossing its fasciculi nearly at right angles, but rather in a reflex direction, and then spreads out and breaks up into a number of very delicate fila- ments with which cineritious matter is inter- mixed, and thus a ganglionic structure is pro- duced, which is in some instances more mani- fest than in others, and is at the same time connected with fasciculi of the facial nerve. The filaments into which the Vidian separates can be followed in both directions, some re- trograde, and some along with the facial: the former appear to pass partly to the auditory nerve, as stated by Arnold, and partly to the facial between the point at which the Vidian joins it and the brain : they can be rent from the one into the other, and indeed look more like filaments from the facial to the Vidian than from the latter to the former. The latter fila- ments of the Vidian are dispersed among the fasciculi of the facial, with which they become united, and can be followed by means of a careful dissection for some distance: their number the writer is not prepared to state : the fasciculus of the facial from which the chorda tympani more particularly arises, appears deci- dedly to receive one or it may be more. Fur- ther, the chorda tympani does not arise by a single root, but is formed by two or tliree de- rived from different parts of the facial. The opinion that the chorda tympani is a continu- ation of the Vidian nerve appears, therefore, to the writer altogether unfounded, and while he admits that the conclusion of Arnold may proba- bly be well-founded, with regard to its compound nature, he yet must dissent from the opinion that the branch which forms it arises immediately from the gangliform swelling of the facial: the fasciculus, from which its principal root pro- ceeds, existing distinctly upon both sides of, and consequently not arising from the swelling, however it may receive an accession from, or be affected by its connection with this part. The author cannot refrain from regarding the chord as a branch of the facial nerve in the same sense with any other branch arising within the limits of the influence of the Vidian nerve. Magendie maintains that the chord is a continuation of the Vidian, because the section of the fifth nerve itself deprives the ear of all sensibility, but whatever part the chord may play in the sensi- bility of the ear, and it is doubtful that it plays any, the result of the experiment will be easily explained by the doctrine of Eschricht, that the facial nerve owes its sensibility to the fifth nerve, the division of which must in such case influence through the Vidian nerve any branch of the facial arising within the range of its in- fluence. After the junction of the chorda tympani with the lingual branch, the latter gives at times a small branch to the internal pterygoid mus- cle : during its descent along the ramus of the jaw, it also gives filaments to the arches of the palate, to the mucous membrane of the cheek, and to the gum of the lower jaw. While the nerve is situate between the mucous membrane of the mouth and the submaxillary gland, it is connected by means of two, three, or four fila- ments with the submaxillary ganglion. This ganglion is a small reddish body resembling the spheno-palatine ganglion in size, colour, and consistence, situate above the posterior extre- mity of the submaxillary gland, and connected superiorly with the lingual branch by the fila- ments mentioned ; inferiorly there arises from it a considerable number of very delicate nerves, which descend through the divisions of the gland, anastomose with each other, and are distributed for the most part to the substance of the gland; one of them descends upon the hyoglossus, anastomoses with a filament from the ninth, and enters into the genioglossus muscle, and another long one accompanies the duct of the gland. A filament of communi- cation also from the superior cervical ganglion of the sympathetic reaches the submaxillary ganglion by following the course of the facial artery, and is represented by Arnold. The filaments by which the ganglion is con- nected to the lingual branch, are, as has been stated, two, three, or four; they are not attached to the nerve all together, but one or two some lines before the others, and they are remarkable for the circumstance, that the posterior descend forward, while the anterior descend backward ; on attentive examination it is found that the posterior are derived one from the chorda tym- pani, and the other from the lingual branch itself; it also appears that the filament derived from the former source is but a part of the cord, the remainder being continued on with the trunk of the lingual, and again that the anterior filament or filaments, which descend backward to the ganglion, are continuations of the poste- rior, which, after having been connected to the ganglion, ascend forward from it again to the trunk of the nerve. The course of those fila- ments of connection is well described and re- presented by the elder Meckel, and a very accu- rate delineation of them is given by Treviranus and Arnold. To this connection probably it is, that we are to attribute the influence which impressions on the organs of taste, or even sounds exert upon the salivary apparatus; let us, when hungry, only hear a sound associated in our minds, in any way, with the gratification of our appetite, and at once that apparatus is roused into activity. Next, while lying between the mylohyoid and the hyoglossus muscles, the lingual nerve sends off from its inferior side some branches, which descend upon the hyoglossus, and anastomose with filaments ascending from the ninth nerve. At the same time, from its superior side, it gives filaments ; some of which, the posterior, are distributed to the mucous membrane and to the gum of the lower jaw ; others, the ante- rior, to the sublingual gland, and by some of their ramifications to the membrane and the gum. Lastly, the nerve divides at the anterior margin of the hyoglossus into its lingual branches; these are, at first, three, poste- rior, middle, and anterior; they pass up- ward and forward, and divide, each into two or three branches, which altogether di- verge from the nerve, and are ranged in suc- cession from behind forward, along the line

27 DIGESTIVE CANAL. With respect to the causes of nausea they may be reduced to two heads; those that act immediately on the stomach, and those that act, in the first instance, on the system at large. Of the first class the most active in their opera- tion are the medicinal substances which are specifically styled emetics, from their peculiar tendency to produce nausea and subsequent vomiting. Besides these certain kinds of food, or food of any description, if it remain in an undigested state, and various substances of an acrid or stimulating nature frequently produce nausea and vomiting. In the second class of causes we have to enumerate various circum- stances, which act .upon parts of the body, sometimes very remote from the stomach, but which, either by direct nervous communica- tion, by sympathy, or association, produce the effect in question. One of the most powerful of these is the motion of a vessel at sea, giving rise to the well-known and most distressing sensation of sea-sickness, certain morbid affec- tions of the brain, particular odours and flavours, renal and biliary calculi, herniae or other affec- tions of the intestinal canal, and lastly, certain causes which can act only through the medium of the mind or imagination. These various circumstances, although so extremely different in their nature and origin, agree in producing a similar effect on the stomach, which may be explained by referring to the nervous com- munications which exist between the organ and every part of the system, and more espe- cially with the other abdominal viscera and the brain.* Bibliography. — Acad, del Cimento, Esper.

Anat.) — The digestive canal is that cavity of the body which is destined to receive the food of animals and to retain it until its nutritious part has been separated or absorbed. It is termed also the alimentary or the intestinal canal. As it is the part into which foreign matter is first conveyed for the nutriment of the system, its forms and structure are most intimately related to the kind of food, and consequently to the living habits and instincts, ard the whole mechanism of animals. The most universal organs in the animal kingdom are the digestive, and most of the others may be considered as secondary or subservient to these. The lowest animals pre- sent us with no other organs than those sub- servient to digestion, and almost all the organs

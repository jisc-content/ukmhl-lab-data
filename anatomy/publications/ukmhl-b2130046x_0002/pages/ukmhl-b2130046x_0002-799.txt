781 ABNORMAL CONDITIONS OF THE HIP-JOINT. wards, forwards, and inwards, and this obliquity is greater in proportion as the pelvis is broader; hence the deformity in the female increases about the age of puberty: there is, in conse- quence of this breadth of the pelvis, a tendency of the limbs to cross each other inferiorly, and the movements they are found to enjoy are very limited, particularly those of abduction and rotation; hence the individual finds great difficulty in performing the different functions belonging naturally to the inferior limbs. When we examine a person with this double defect standing, we are struck at once with the apparent want of proportion between the superior and inferior parts of the body, with the imper- fection of the lower limbs, and with the peculiar attitude of the patient. The trunk is fully deve- loped, says Dupuytren, whilst the inferior limbs, short and slender, seem as if they were suited only to au individual of smaller stature. When we view the patient laterally, we observe that the chest and superior part of the body are carried very much backwards, while the anterior part of the abdomen is thrown very prominently forwards, and at the same time we notice there is a corresponding hollowing posteriorly in the region of the loins, and that the nates jut out backwards most conspicuously. A very cha- racteristic circumstance relative to the standing position of these malformed individuals is, that they rest on the ground only by the anterior part of their feet; most of the peculiar cir- cumstances relating to the attitude of these persons follow as the necessary consequence of their hip-joints (or in other words the centre of motion of the lower extremities) being placed behind their ordinary situation with respect to the pelvis. If a patient so unhappily constituted wish to walk, we see him incline the superior part of his body towards the limb which is now in- tended to support the weight of the body ; he as it were balances himself on the anterior part of the foot of this side ; he next raises from the ground the opposite foot, and transfers labori- ously his weight from one side to the otherâ€” indeed each time this motion takes place, the head of the femur which receives the weight of the body, ascends upon the external iliac fossa, and is sustained by its ligaments and muscles; the pelvis is at the same time depressed, and all the signs of displacement become more ob- vious on this side, while they diminish sensibly on the other; in a word, progression thus be- comes an awkward and waddling movement. It may appear singular that running and leaping should be executed by these patients with more facility than walking, yet such is the fact; for in those exertions the energy of muscular contraction, and the rapidity with which the weight of the body is transferred from one limb to the other, are such, that the want of a true acetabulum is not so much felt as in walking. Any of these exercises, how- ever, very soon induce fatigue, which we can readily account for when we recollect the friction which the head of the femur must un- dergo against the side of the pelvis, and the great efforts which the muscles have to-sustain in supporting the weight of tRe body, during the balancing or waddling motion described. When persons afflicted with this malformation lie down horizontally on their back, the signs of their infirmity become so slight as to be scarcely perceptible, because in this situation of complete repose the muscles do not draw upwards the lower limbs, nor does the weight of the body depress the pelvis. Dupuytren found that in this situation of the body he could elongate or shorten the affected limbs of the patient; to elongate them, he says, it was merely necessary to pull slightly down- wards at the knee or ankle, and to shorten them, to push them upwards; the head of the femur will undergo in such experiments a dis- placement of one, two, or even three inches (Dupuytren), and all these displacements will be affected without causing any pain and with the greatest ease, convincing us that no proper cavity exists fit to receive and retain the head of the femur. It is of importance that this congenital mal- formation of the hip-joint should be well under- stood, not only that dangerous errors in diagnosis may be avoided, but that this defect, when it really exists, may be recognized early, so that timely and proper treatment may be resorted to. It presents to the superficial observer many of the signs which belong to a disease of the hip- joint ; and of the cases seen by Dupuytren, few, he says, had been recognized by the surgeons previously consulted : almost all these unfor- tunate patients had been subjected to painful and worse than useless treatment. Many individuals afflicted with original luxation of the hip-joint have been, in consequence of the errors or igno- rance of their medical attendants, condemned to keep their beds during many years. " I have seen others," says he, " whom they had forced to submit to numberless applications of leeches, blisters, issues, and moxas; among others I remember the case of a young girl, who suffered the application of twenty-one moxas around the hip, without this barbarous treatment having effected any favourable change in the situation of this unfortunate patient." We can easily distinguish this original luxation from disease of the hip-joint, as there is no pain felt by the patient either in the hip or knee ; there is neither heat, swelling, nor abscess, no evidence of inflammation chronic or acute, nor is there any cicatrix ; consequently nothing exists which can induce us to believe that heretofore there ever existed any abscess or fistula, consequences so very usual in cases of disease of the hip-joint, when this disease has arrived at the stage of luxation. Dupuytren's description of this condition of the hip-joint seems to apply altogether to the case in which both joints are engaged; when one articulation only is affected, so far as it is concerned, the features of the congenital defect are just as well marked as those above alluded to. The usual signs of the dislocation upwards and backwards on the dorsum ilii, and the same range of ascent and descent of the head of the femur on the ilium and towards the ischi- atic notch, is noticed as in the former case ; as-,

EDENTATA.â€”A group of mammiferous animals, exhibiting no very distinct general characters to indicate any close mutual affinities between them, but agreeing in the unimport- ant character of the absence of incisive teeth and the possession of long claws. They may indeed be considered as consisting of two very distinct groups ; the one exclusively vegetable feeders, the other generally insectivorous in their habits. To the first belong the Sloths (Brudypm), (fig. 24), constituting the Tar- digrada of Illiger; to the second, the Ant- eaters (Myrmecophaga), (fig. 25), the Arma- dillos (Dasypus), ("^g. 26), the Pangolin (Ma- nis) (fig. 27), with their congeners, and the re- cently discovered American fossorial animal, the Chlamyphorus, forming the Edentata proper. The enormous extinct animal, the Megathe- rium (Jig. 28), may be considered as an addi- tional form, and a very interesting and impor- tant one, as it certainly exhibits some charac- ters which appear to connect the Tardigrada and the true Edentata. The organisation of these forms is so different as to require a se- parate description. The Ornithorynchus and the Echidna are necessarily excluded from the Edentata, with which they had been united by Cuvier and others, and form the group called Monotremata by Geoffroy. In the Sloths, the whole structure is evidently formed to enable them to pass their life in trees, amongst the branches of which they con- stantly reside, hanging with the back down- wards and creeping slowly along in this remark- able position, embracing the bough, and Skeleton of the Ant-eater,

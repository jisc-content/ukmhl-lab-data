42 ECHINODERMATA, Asterias aurantiaca opened from above. A, ray with thn cceca g, g,'m their place. B, coeca removed ; vesicles of feet d, seen. C, vesicles of feet removed to shew the calcareous segments of the ray. D, skin forming roof of the body and rays A, B, C, raised ; vessels seen on its inner surface with collapsed stomach,/, &c. inferior circular vessel. The descending canal is dilated in the middle; its comparatively thick brown coloured parietes are smooth externally, but reticulated on the inside and composed of interlaced fibres, which Tiede- mann found to possess muscular irritability. He accordingly considers this canal as the heart. The inferior circular vessel (which must not be confounded with the circular canal connected with the feet) surrounds the mouth on the outside or inferior surface; it sends out five branches which pass into the interior of the body, and are distributed to the stomach, coeca and ovaries. Tiedemann re- gards these branches with the circular vessel from which they proceed as arteries, and he thinks it probable that their minute ramifica- tions open into the radicles of the veins, though from their delicacy he has not been able to ascertain the fact by injection. Tiedemann's view of the function of the respective vessels is derived solely from a con- sideration of their anatomical disposition, and while in the same way it may be inferred that the blood circulates in a direction conformable with this view, it must nevertheless be kept in mind that no direct physiological proof of such a course of the blood has been yet ob- tained. Besides the vessels described, Tiede- mann found yet another circular vessel sur- rounding the mouth on the under surface and placed more superficially than the last men- tioned ; it is of an orange colour and sends a branch along each of the rays, in the groove which is on the middle of their inferior sur- face. He could trace no connection between

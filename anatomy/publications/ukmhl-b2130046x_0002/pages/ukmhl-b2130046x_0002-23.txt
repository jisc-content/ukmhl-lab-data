9 DIGESTION. cles causes the epiglottis to close the passage into the larynx. The muscular fibres of the oesophagus itself are now brought into play, and by their successive contraction, propel the food from the upper to the lower part of the tube, and thus convey it to its final destination. These three stages, which altogether constitute .a very complicated train of actions, are so connected with each other, that the operation appears to be of the most simple kind; it is one of the first that is performed by the newly born animal, and is exercised during the whole period of existence with the most perfect facility.* The food, after having thus experienced the action of the first order of parts, which, as we have seen above, is principally, if not entirely, of a mechanical nature, is finally deposited in the stomach. The stomach is a bag of an irregular oval form, which lies obliquely across the upper part of the abdomen, in what is termed, from the presence of this organ, the epigastric region. The structure of the sto- mach, considered in its physiological relation, is threefold. A large portion of it is composed of membranous matter, which gives it its ge- neral form, determines its bulk, and connects it with the neighbouring parts, constituting its external coat. To the interior surface of this coat are attached a number of muscular fibres, by which the various contractile actions of the stomach are performed; these, although not capable of being exhibited as a connected or continuous structure, are considered, accord- ing to the custom of the anatomists, as com- posing the muscular coat, while its internal coat consists of a mucous membrane, which appears to be the immediate seat of the se- creting glands, from which the stomach de- rives its appropriate fluids. But besides this, which may be regarded as the physiological structure of the stomach, by which its parts are so arranged as to give the organ its form and position, its contractile power, and its chemical action, the anatomists have resolved it into a greater number of mechanical divisions, depending principally upon the minuteness to which they have carried their dissections. In this way no less than six or even eight distinct strata or coats have been assigned to the sto- mach. First, the peritoneal covering, which it has in common with all the other abdominal viscera, the dense membrane which more especially gives the stomach its form, called in the language of the older writers the ner- vous coat, two muscular coats,f one composed of longitudinal and the other of circular fibres, and the innermost, or, as it has been termed, * For a minute account of the process of deglu- tition generally we may refer to Boerhaave, Praol. t. i. ยง 70. .2, Hallcr's Phys. by Mihles, lect. 23; Prim.

The ner- vous coat is usually described as being the seat of the glands, as well as of the bloodvessels, nerves, and absorbents which belong to the stomach; but although they cannot perhaps be actually traced beyond this part, there is some reason to suppose that their ultimate destination is on the innermost or villous coat. The membranous part of the stomach ap- pears to be peculiarly distensible, so as readily to admit of having its capacity greatly and suddenly increased, in order to contain the large quantity of solids and fluids that are occasionally received into it, while its mus- cular fibres and nerves are possessed respec- tively of a high degree of contractility and sensibility, by which they act powerfully on its contents, propelling them, when necessary, into the duodenum, and thus reducing the bulk of the stomach to its ordinary standard. Besides the mucous fluid which the inner sur- face secretes, in common with all other mem- branes of this description, the stomach is sup- posed to possess certain glands, adapted for the formation of a specific fluid, termed the gastric juice, which acts an important part in the process of digestion ; but the presence of these glands has been rather inferred from then- supposed necessity, than from any actual ob- servation of their existence.* From the peculiar form and disposition of what have been termed the muscular coats of the stomach, they not only enable the organ to contract in its whole extent and in all direc- tions, but they give to its individual parts the power of successively contracting and relaxing, so as to produce what has been termed its peristaltic or vermicular motion .f The effect produced appears to be, in the first instance, to form in the interior of the stomach a series of folds or furrows, and at the same time to agitate the alimentary mass, so as to bring every part of it, in its turn, within the in- fluence of the gastric juice, while the whole of the mass is gradually carried forwards to- wards the pylorus, and is in due time dis- charged from that orifice. The muscular fibres of the stomach, like all those that are con- nected with membranous expansions, forming what are termed muscular coats, are not under the control of the will. In consequence of the great degree of vitality which the stomach possesses, a circumstance in which it is surpassed by scarcely any organ in the whole body, it is very plentifully provided with bloodvessels and with nerves. The arteries, according to the ordinary construction of the sys- tem, are furnished by the contiguous large trunks, * Winslow's Anat. Sect. viii. ยง 63..5 โข, Haller, El.

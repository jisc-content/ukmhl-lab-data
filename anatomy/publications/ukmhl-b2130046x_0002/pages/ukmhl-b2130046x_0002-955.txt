INSECTA. 937 Fig. 400. Diagram of the muscles and nerves of the ventral surface of the segments in the larva "' of Sphinx ligustri. (Newport, Phil. Trans.) beneath the upper one. The second layer con- sists of seven distinct fasciculi, which extend from the anterior margin of the segment, close to the smaller rectus, and beneath the larger, about half their breadth across the segment. They run backwards and outwards in a dia- gonal direction, and are attached to the middle ridge below the rectus as far across the seg- ment as the outer margin of that muscle (8). These layers of muscles when in action draw the outer part of the anterior margin of the following segment diagonally forwards in the direction of the median line of the body, and, consequently, when these muscles in se- veral segments on one side of the body act ogether, they bring forward the posterior por- ion of the body of the same side, and bend it in a semicircular direction. When these layers on both sides of a segment act together, they draw forwards the posterior part of the body in a straight line. The most internal of these layers (6) which lies close to the rectus may be called the first oblique, and the other the second oblique (7). Beneath this there is another diagonal layer of fibres which originates close to the median line of the body (9), be- neath the nervous cord, almost in a line with the insertion of the smaller rectus. The origin of this set is exceedingly narrow and distinctly tendinous, and the fibres diverging pass di- agonally upwards and outwards, forming a Hat triangular muscle, the third oblique (9, 10), which is attached to the posterior ridge, and extends outwards to the margin of the greater

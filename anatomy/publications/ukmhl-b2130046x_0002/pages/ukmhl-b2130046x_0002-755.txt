737 HERMAPHRODITISM. The fact itself, however we may explain it, of the comparatively extreme rarity of both male and female sexual organs upon double monsters seems sufficiently established by va- rious careful investigations made into the sub- ject. Thus out of forty-two perfectly double monsters which Haller* was able to collect at the time at which he wrote, there were only two that were supposed to be of double sex, or, in other words, that had one body male, and the other female. Among double-headed monsters, with single lower extremities, he found an hermaphroditic type more common, arid adduces three examples of it. In re-investigating this matter, the late Pro- fessor Meckelf could discover among the nu- merous class of monsters with perfectly double bodies united anteriorly or laterally by the tho- rax and abdomen, only one very doubtful case of exception to the above general fact. In the class of double monsters united in the region of the pelvis he mentions two exceptional cases from Valentin'J and IJasenest ;§ of double- headed monsters with single bodies, he quotes three similar eases from Lemery,|| Bacher,5f and Bilsius ;** and of monsters with a single head and double body he adduces two cases from BrissKusff ai1d Condamine,JJ in which in a like manner one body of the monster was supposed to have female, and the other male sexual organs. Several of these cases, how- ever, certainly rest upon too doubtful authority and insufficient observation. Isidore St. Hilaire has still further extended the data on which the above general fact is founded, by shewing that the same uniformity of sex holds good with respect to double para- sitical monsters,§§ and even in monstrosities double by inclusion. Thus out of this last in- teresting class of double monsters, he alludes|||| to ten distinct cases in which the sex of the included being was ascertained. In six out of these ten cases the includingand included body were both male; and in the other four they were both female. On the whole, therefore, we must consider as founded on a proper induction from the ex- isting data, the axiom of Meckel,—" Sexuum diversorum indicia in eodem organismo, quan- tumvis duplicitate peccet, non dari, sed unum tantum observari."H1[ But while all the data hitherto collected with regard to this subject one family in the different branches of which twelve pairs of twins have been born within three generations. In eleven out of these twelve pairs the co-twins have been of opposite sexes. * Opusc. Anat. (1751.) p. 176. t De Duplicitate Monstrosa, p. 21. X Eph. Nat. Cur. Dec. ii. Ann. iii. p. 190. 6 Comment.

II. would seem to point it thus out as one of the most constant and best ascertained laws in te- ratology, still we are not altogether disposed to consider it with Zeviani* and Lesauvagef as subject to no exceptions whatever. In the study of monstrosities, as in the study of other departments of medical science, we find many general, but no universal laws. Bibliography.—Affaitat (J.), De hermaphro- ditis, Venct. 1549.

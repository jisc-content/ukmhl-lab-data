807 ABNORMAL CONDITIONS OF THE HIP-JOINT. Fie, 318. where the globular head joins the under part of the neck, but which gradually enlarges down- wards towards the lesser trochanter, and even so low as the middle of the femur, where it will be found nearly twice the breadth of the opposite wall of the shaft of the bone; the compact stratum which, scarcely thicker than a wafer, invests the entire of the head, upper part of the neck, and trochanter, seems to have little reference to any design of imparting strength or resistance to this portion of the bone, and the same may be said of the whole of the reticular tissue of these processes, while, on the contrary, the compact tissue of the under surface of the neck seems artfully arranged, if we can so say, so as to give support to the weight of the body in the erect position ; hence do we find this compact stratum thrown into an arch, upon which the weight of the body falls, as that of a carriage does on the C spring which sustains it. When we fall or leap from a height on the feet or knees, the thin upper stratum of the neck, and the whole of the reticular tissue of the bone will first receive, and probably yield somewhat to, the weight, by which some of the force of the shock may be decomposed, but to the bony arch of compact tissue, to which we have alluded, must ultimately be referred any violence which the neck of the femur can re- ceive from any impulse transmitted from above. We seldom hear of a fracture of the neck of the femur occurring to a healthy adult when he falls with violence on his feet or knees, for the weight of the superincumbent body is thrown in the most favourable manner on the bony arch of compact tissue before alluded to, which from its density and form, and strength deriva- ble from both, it is almost always able to resist; and even a fracture of the acetabulum or rupture of the capsular ligament and dislo- cation are accidents more likely to happen under these circumstances. But, on the other hand, let us suppose a person to fall on the trochanter major, which is resisted by the ground, while the weight of the pelvis, &c. acting obliquely on the under sur- face of the neck, will have a tendency to bring the neck of the femur into a straight line with the shaft of the bone, or in other words, to efface its obliquity ; here the compact tissue, so often alluded to, receives the force from below in a most unfavourable manner, and this tissue cracks across, and if no more happens for the present, we shall have the simplest form of partial fracture of the neck of the femur. While circumstances are in this state, we can conceive the possibility of a patient being- able to stand after such an accident, and even walk for some distance; and when examined by the surgeon, we can understand how the latter, as it has often happened, might be de- ceived into the opinion that there was really no fracture. Again, we can easily imagine how under such circumstances an awkward move- ment or a fall may render the fracture complete, or how, from a severe secondary injury, or even the continued action of the first impulse, some- what varied in its direction, the upper fragment of the broken neck of the femur could be wedged into the cancelli of the shaft. Anatomical characters of fracture of the neck of the thigh-bone.-â€”In those cases in which opportunities have occurred of making recent anatomical examinations of those who have died shortly after having suffered fracture of the neck of the thigh-bone, blood has been found extensively extravasated beneath the skin, among the interstices of the muscles, and we find the line of the fractures through the tro- chanters and upper portion of the shaft of the femur itself marked out by blood in a coagu- lated state, which had insinuated itself into and among the interstices of the broken bones. When we examine a case of intra-capsular fracture which had taken place a long time previously to the death of the patient, very remarkable changes in the structures around the joint are noticed. The muscles, when com- pared with those of the opposite side, are more or less atrophied. This observation, however, only applies to the greater number of the muscles around the hip-joint, as some of the smaller ones (in cases of ununited fractures of the neck of the thigh-bone of long standing) are usually found to have undergone a con- siderable change in their appearance and struc- ture; of all these, the obturator externus seems to be the most changed and thickened. This is easily accounted for, uhen we recollect that when the neck of the femur is fractured, there is a strong tendency in the muscles around the joint to drag up the femur, and cause its shortening ; indeed, the capsular ligament and the obturator externus alone resist the ascent of the head of the bone on the pelvis. The tonic force of the muscles has constantly this tendency to elevate the femur on the dorsum of the ilium, and when the patient begins to walk, and to throw

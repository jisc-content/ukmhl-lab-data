ILIAC ARTERIES. 841 between it and the fascia transversalis ; it ap- proaches very near to the inner margin of the deep ring, and at its insertion into the pectineal line it meets and is identified with Gimbernat's ligament; it is closely adherent to the surface of the fascia transversalis, and hence that fascia presents an appearance of thickness and strength upon the inside of the deep ring, which it does not really possess. From the inferior margin of the internal oblique and from the superior side of the crural arch the cremaster muscle descends upon the anterior and external part of the spermatic process, forming one of the coverings of the process within the inguinal canal, of course concealing it after the division of the aponeurosis of the external oblique, and requiring to be detached from the arch along with the lower fibres of the internal oblique in order that the process may be fairly exposed. The deep structures of the anterior wall of the iliac fossa are also three, viz., the fascia transversalis, the fascia propria, and the peri- toneum. 1. The fascia transversalis is most remark- able in the iliac region, but it is not con- fined to it, being to be traced upward to the surface of the diaphragm, and backward round the interior of the lateral walls of the abdo- men. In the iliac region this fascia is interiorly first identified with the fascia iliaca from a short distance behind the anterior superior spinous process of the ilium to the outer side of the external iliac artery, or about the middle of the crural arch ; the line of its connection with the fascia iliaca runs downward, forward, and in- ward, at a short distance within the crest of the ilium and the crural arch, approaching the latter, however, as it descends, until at the outside of the artery it touches it; it is sepa- rated along this line into two lamina? which enclose the circumflex iliac artery between them; there is, therefore, an interval between the arch and the line of connection of the two fascia? in which the fascia iliaca intervenes, and to the surface of this part of the fascia it is that the internal oblique and transverse muscles are attached. In the second place the fascia transversalis descends into the thigh beneath the crural arch, between it and the iliac vessels, and forming the front of their sheath; and, thirdly, it is attached upon the inside of the vessels, along the pectineal line of the pubis posterior to the conjoined tendon of the internal oblique and transverse muscles, between it and the peritoneum, and separated by it from the spermatic process, which is m front of both. Internally the fascia transversalis is con- nected to the edge of the tendon of the rectus. Midway between the superior anterior spi- nous process of the ilium and the spinous pro- cess of the pubes, and at from half to three- fourths of an inch above the crural arch, the spermatic process escapes from the abdomen, descending within a cylindrical prolongation of the fascia by which the process is enclosed, and which thus forms a sheath for the process. By detaching this prolongation from the fascia around the process, a circular aperture is formed in the fascia, which is the deep in- guinal ring, the situation of which has been just defined. On the inside of this opening- are situate the epigastric vessels, the artery, and vein or veins, the artery in the former case being next the ring, in the latter at times the outer of the two veins. 2. The fascia propria is a cellular stratum in- terposed between the peritoneum and the struc- tures of the abdominal walls which it lines ; it varies in thickness and condition at different parts and in different subjects ; at times it con- tains adeps, at others it is purely cellular, or forms a condensed expansion; in the iliac region it is thicker upon its posterior than its anterior wall; on the latter it increases in thickness as it descends towards the crural arch, being so thin towards the umbilicus that the peritoneum adheres very closely to the ten- dinous expansion of the muscles; at the deep inguinal ring it is more dense, and the perito- neum, the fascia transversalis, and it, are more intimately connected than at either side; ex- ternal to the ring, between it and the spinous process of the ilium, it is so free that the pe- ritoneum may be separated without difficulty from the interior of the fascia transversalis, and along the crural arch it forms, from the external iliac artery outward, a soft mass, sometimes thick, occupying the interval left between the peritoneum and the fascia trans- versalis, at the reflection of the former from the iliac fossa to the anterior wall: upon this wall it encloses the epigastric vessels, the um- bilical ligament, and the spermatic vessels, and not only does it extend universally over the in- terior of the abdominal walls but it is prolonged through their several apertures upon the parts which pass through them, as in the case of the spermatic vessels. From the anterior wall of this region it passes to the posterior, where it lines the iliac fossa, and connects the peritoneum or the viscera to the iliac fascia ; at the outer part of the fossa it is remarkably free, soft, and easily lacerated, so that the peritoneum can be detached, pro- bably with greater facility at this than at any other situation; at its inner part it is even more abundant, thicker the nearer to the crural arch, forming the investment by which the iliac ves- sels are inclosed, and descending thence into the pelvis. Lastly, the peritoneum of the anterior wall is continuous inferiorly with that of the iliac fossa, being reflected from the one to the other at the distance of five or six lines above the crural archâ€”a fact deserving of much attention, since it permits the external iliac artery to be secured without disturbing the membrane. In its reflection from one wall of the region to the other it leaves immediately above the crural arch, between itself, the fascia transversalis, and the fascia iliaca, a triangular interval of some lines, occupied by the fascia propria, and at times at least by one or more lymphatic glands; this space is widest at the iliac artery and diminishes as it extends outward; this fact also deserves attention, inasmuch as it points out where the fascia transversalis may be di- vided, if necessary, in the operation of expo-

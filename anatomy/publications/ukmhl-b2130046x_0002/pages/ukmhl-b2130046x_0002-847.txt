829 ILIAC ARTERIES. the sacro-iliac articulation or of the lateral part of the sacrum, as it may be, inclining backward and outward, and describing a curve concave forward, until it reaches the superior part of the great sciatic notch, where it usually divides ; this however is by no means uniform, the point of its division ranging between the brim of the pelvis and the notch. The internal iliac is an artery of great size, but in the adult smaller than the external; its course is somewhat tor- tuous and short, from one and a half to two and a half inches. During its descent the artery is placed before the lumbo-sacral nerve, on the left side before the primitive iliac vein, and on both before the sacro-iliac articulation or the lateral part of the sacrum. Before it are in the male the bladder or its lateral connections, in the female the uterus and its broad fold of peritoneum ; ex- ternally the artery corresponds to the internal iliac and the commencement of the primitive iliac veins, to the inside of the psoas magnus muscle, to the brim of the pelvis, to the obtu- rator nerve, which it crosses nearly at right angles, to the lumbo-sacral and first of the anterior branches of the sacral nerves, and to the superior attachment of the pyriformis muscle : the ilio-lumbar artery is also external to the internal iliac, between it and the wall of the pelvis. Internal to it are the peritoneum, the rectum with its mesentery, and the superior hemorrhoidal vessels, (these parts being nearer to the artery upon the left than the right,) and the small intestine when in the pelvis. The external iliac vessels are above, before, and external to the internal.* In the foetus the condition of the internal iliac differs remarkably from that which it presents in after life; in it both in size and direction this artery appears the continuation of the primitive trunk, exceeding the external as much as afterward it is exceeded by it. It is the channel which conveys the blood to the placenta, and it is generally entitled the " hypogastric or umbilical artery ;" " placental'' would certainly be preferable. It passes from the primitive iliac or rather from the aorta, for there the primitive iliac appears only the com- mencement of the placental artery, downward and at first outward as far as the sacro-iliac articulation, where it gives off the external iliac artery, then forward to the side of the bladder, descending but little into the pelvis and at the same time giving off pelvic branches; it next changes its direction and ascends in- clining inward toward the umbilicus, at first by the side of the bladder and then in the anterior abdominal wall, between the peritoneum and the rectus muscle or its sheath, and on either side of the urachus; thus forming a curve convex downward through the concavity of which pass the vas deferens or round ligament before, the ureter posteriorly and the rectum, the extremity of the ilium and the appendages of the uterus in the mean space. Having reached the umbilicus the artery escapes through it from the body of the foetus and is conducted * 'Hiis is to be understood to refer to the recum- bent posture; in the erect posture the external arc not superior to the internal vessels. by the umbilical cord to the placenta ; during their transit to the placenta the arteries at the very early periods of utero-gestation, are straight, but afterwards, in proportion as the develope- ment advances, they become tortuous, and are twined round the umbilical placental vein, whence the length of the arteries exceeds that of the cord which varies from one to two feet. At the placenta the two arteries are connected by a considerable anastomosis, and divide into numerous branches, which subdivide minutely in the lobes of that structure, the ramifications of the several lobes being distinct from each other; ordinarily the two vessels are distinct until they approach the placenta, but they have been found to unite into a single one before escaping from the abdomen of the foetus.* The placental arteries give off within the body of the foetus branches similar in number and destination with those of the primitive iliac of the adult, but in a rudimental condition; between the summit of the bladder and the umbilicus however they do not furnish branches, and hence, the circulation through them be- tween these points ceasing at birth, they be- come obliterated to the same extent and connected into impervious cords, known by the name of umbilical ligaments; these hold the same course and relation with the original vessels, and are less distinct in proportion to the age of the subject; they are covered upon their abdominal aspect by the peritoneum, which is reflected upon them to a greater or less extent according to the subject, and thereby forms triangular falciform folds, the base of which is below in the iliac fossa, and the apex above toward the umbilicus, and in the free edge of which the ligament is contained. At a point intermediate to the brim of the pelvis and the upper part of the sacro-sciatic notch the internal iliac artery divides into branches ; these are numerous, amounting altogether in the male to nine, and in the female to eleven ; but in their mode of origin they vary very much, arising sometimes separately, sometimes by common trunks, but for the most part from two, into which the iliac divides ; these are an anterior one giving off the hemorrhoidal, the umbilical, the vesical, the uterine, the vaginal, the sciatic and internal pudic, and a posterior, from which arise the ilio-lumbar, the lateral sacral, the obturator and the gluteal. Another diversity in the mode of their origin is that of the obturator from the epigastric or external iliac. The branches of the internal iliac are arranged either into four sets, viz. posterior, anterior, internal, and inferior,! or into two, internal and external,]; the former distributed within, the latter without the pelvis ; the latter seems the more simple division, and is the one which will be adopted in this article. The internal branches are in the male five, in the female seven ; they are as followâ€” 1. The iliolumbar artery varies in size and ori- gin ; for the most part it arises from the posterior * Cloquet. t Cloquet. X Harrison

FIFTH PAIR OF NERVES. 312 also from the orbit, the eye and its appendages, and in our operation for the division of the nerve we do less violence either in their vicinity or actually to them, until the operation is per- formed at such a distance from those parts, that they are not involved in the injury inflicted. Thus the nerve cannot be divided through the temporal fossa without great violence done to the parts in the vicinity of the orbit, and con- nected with the eye as well as the fifth nerve, as is evident from the result, and as has been explained elsewhere.* In the section be- tween the ganglion and the pons, the violence is inflicted at a part more remote than the former, from the orbit, &c, and here, according to his own account, the effect upon the eye was much less considerable. But the most re- markable fact is, that the alterations of nutrition are much less marked than in the former mode of experiment; there forms only a partial in- flammation at the superior part of the eye, and the opacity which ensues occupies but a small segment upon the circumference of the cornea at the superior part; and in the third case the parts injured are so far removed from the eye,— (in dividing the nerve on the margin of the fourth ventricle, Magendie exposed the parts by " opening the spinal envelopes between the occiput and the first vertebra,")—that the effects of the injury could not, under ordinary circum- stances, extend to it, and accordingly in it no alteration occurred. It would seem, then, that the great violencef inflicted, either in the vici- nity of the eye or actually to its appendages, constitutes the primary and immediate cause of the alterations which took place in the eye in the experiments under consideration. But it is likely they were the result of more causes than one, for there were also engaged in the experi- ments other agencies, the influence of which must have enhanced greatly that of the violence inflicted by the operation; thus, in the first place, in some of the instances at least,—and we have no evidence that it was not so in all,—■ * It is hardly possible to conceive the section effected at the point and in the mode adopted, without a division of most of the nerves and vessels supplying the eye and its appendages. t A better idea of the injury likely to be inflicted in the experiment will be formed from a brief ac- count of the mode of conducting it. A lancet- pointed style is driven into tlie cranium through the temporal fossa and through its base, and when carried in to such depth as the experience of the operator teaches him to be sufficient, its point is moved upward and downward, until the loss of sensa- tion in the superficial paits assures him thatthe fifth nerve has been divided. After such a proceeding the question should rather be, what mischief has not been done than what has. There cannot be any assurance that, in the division of the fifth, the third, fourth, and sixth nerves with the branches of the sympathetic—nay, the optic itself—have not been involved : and if to this be added the almost cer- tainty of dividing the internal carotid artery, from which the supply of blood to the internal structures of the eye is directly derived, and the division of which causes the death of the greater number of the subjects of experiment, an amount of injury will be made out, quite adequate to account for the total loss of the eye, and which must reduce the influence of the fifth in producing it to a low degree indeed. a highly irritating agent was introduced, and, in consequence of the insensibility of the organ, probably in considerable quantity, into the eye; and in the second the eye was left under cir- cumstances more than enough to excite inflam- mation and to produce serious injury to it, though the organ had remained in full posses- sion of all those safeguards with which its sen- sibility and the sympathetic action established thereby between its several protecting appen- dages naturally endow it; for " the eye was dry;" and " the eyelids were either widely open and immoveable, or else they were glued together by the puriform matters, which were dried between their margins;" and an organ so circumstanced has abundant cause for inflamma- tion, independently either of nervous influence or of its absence. It may be said that Magen- die has proved that neither the open state of the eyelids nor the want of the lachrymal secre- tion is adequate to the effect. Admitting for a moment that he has, he certainly has not shewn that the combined influence of the two is inad- equate to produce it; but the first position is by no means satisfactorily established: his mode of determining the question, whether the inflammation was excited by the eye remaining constantly open or not, was by the division of the portio dura, and his experiment has certainly proved that the effect of the section of that nerve will not excite inflammation in the eye, but no more; inasmuch as such section does not produce a permanently open state of the eye : an eye so circumstanced will be closed during sleep, and even during the waking state it requires attention and experience in such observations to discover that the animal has lost the power of closing the lids by a muscular effort of those parts themselves ; for by the sud- den exertion of the power of retracting the eye, which inferior animals possess to a remarkable degree, the lids become nearly, if not quite, closed, and the animal appears to wink as well as before, while by rolling the eye the different parts of its surface are in turn brought beneath the lids, and thus no one part is ever left long absolutely uncovered. So great indeed is the power which brutes possess in this respect, that the author has seen a dog in which the portio dura had been divided on one side, presented for observation, and persons aware that the nerve had been divided, yet not able to disco- ver on which side it had been done, and even deny that the lids were paralyzed on either side, until something was approximated to each eye successively, when the uninjured eye was at once closed, but the other remained open, and the animal appeared looking at the object, which it was unable to exclude. It is obvious, then, that the question has not been and cannot be determined in this way. To the causes already enumerated must be added the loss of the nervous influence, for it is not intended, in what has preceded, to assert that the section of the fifth has no share in the production of the changes in the eye, but only that it is not the primary or essential cause of them. Indirectly it must contribute powerfully to produce and aggravate, or it may even excite

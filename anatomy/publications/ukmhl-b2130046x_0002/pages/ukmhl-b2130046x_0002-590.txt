HEARING. 572 were suggested by the result of several ob- servations which he made upon the communi- cation of vibrations through the air from a vibrating body to one placed even at a great distance from it, and susceptible of under- going vibrations. The effect is best seen by using a thin membrane, such as very fine paper, carefully stretched in a horizontal position over the mouth of a glass, or of a small delft basin : a thin layer of sand is spread on this, and a glass thrown into vibration by a violin bow is held at a little distance from it; that the paper immediately begins to vibrate is shewn by the motions excited in the sand, the par- ticles of which arrange themselves into figures, which are sometimes perfectly regular, and which form with so much rapidity that the eye can scarcely follow " the circumstances which accompany the transformation of the thin layer of sand into a greater or less number of lines of repose." By a series of experiments to be hereafter detailed, Savart showed that the tympanic membrane is capable of being thrown into vibrations by the sonorous impulses from a vibrating body communicated to it by the in- terposed air How far the external ear and auditory canal serve to increase these vibrations of the tympanic membrane, he sought to ascer- tain by the following experiments. He formed a conical tube of pasteboard, with a very wide mouth at its base, the opening at the smaller end being closed by a thin paper stretched over it and glued to the margins of the open- ing. This tube is placed resting on its base, the membrane being upwards and per- fectly horizontal, so that a layer of sand may be spread over it. When a vibrating glass is brought near and parallel to the upper surface of this membrane, it immediately begins to vibrate, and the grains of sand are tossed about but raised but very slightly from the surface. If, however, the vibrating glass be placed near the base or the wide and open extremity of the tube, the vibrations of the membrane will be found to be much more manifest, and the ex- cursions of the grains of sand so considerable, that they are often raised to a height of three or four centimetres ; so that there is a manifest difference in the influence produced upon the membrane by the sonorous undulations excited in the air according as they impinge upon the external surface of the membrane or upon that which is turned towards the interior of the tube. This phenomenon, Savart adds, may depend upon two causes, namely, upon the concen- tration of the sonorous undulations by the tube, or upon the communication of motion to the parietes of the tube, which again would com- municate it to the membrane. With a view to ascertain which of these causes was the effective one, a second conical tube, open at both ends, was held with its narrow extremity a little above and corresponding to the narrow extremity of the former one, but so that there was no contact between them. If now the glass is made to vibrate successively at the large orifices of the two tubes, it will be found that when placed at the orifice of the tube to which the membrane is attached, the oscil- lations of that membrane are considerably greater than when the aerial undulations reach it through the other tube. Whence it may be inferred that in all probability the external ear and auditory canal have, besides any influence they may exert in modifying the movements of the particles of the air, the additional function of presenting a large surface to the aerial un- dulations, consequently to enter into vibration under their influence, and thus to contribute to increase the excursions of the vibrating pd^ts of the membrane with which they are imme- diately in contact; the auricle, by the variety of the direction and the inclination of its sur- faces to one another, can always present to the air a certain number of parts, whose direction is normal (at right angles with) to that of the molecular movement of that fluid. We get a general notion of the value of this external part of the auditory apparatus in col- lecting and directing the sonorous undulations, from the assistance often derived in hearing from increasing the concavity of the external ear by placing the hand behind it, so as to draw it forward and shorten it by pressure at its upper and lower part; by the dulness of hearing which it is said follows the loss of the auricle, and from the fact, so stated, that the seal and walrus are extremely dull of hearing. As regards the loss of the auricle, it is said by Kerner that this loss is followed by the greatest dulness of hearing in those animals in whom the osseous meatus is wanting. In a cat, from whom the right ear was cut close to the skull, after the wound had healed without any stoppage of the meatus, there was a re- markable disposition always to keep its head turned so as to be ready to receive sounds with the left ear, and this continued even after the tympanic membrane of the opposite side had been frequently perforated, that of the right side remaining whole; and when the left ear was stopped (although the right tympanic mem- brane was sound, and the only injury on that side was the removal of the auricle,) a total deaf- ness was manifested except to the loudest and clearest sounds. The tympanum and its contents.â€”We have already stated that Savart had demonstrated that the membrana tympani is thrown into vibrations by undulations of the air excited by a sonorous body. This he demonstrated ex- perimentally upon the membrana tympani itself. The temporal bone having been sepa- rated, he sawed away the osseous meatus so as to expose the membrane on a level with the rest of the bone, and when it was suf- ficiently dry, he covered it with a thin layer of sand. A vibrating glass held parallel and very near to the surface of the membrane occasioned a slight movement of the grains of sand; but owing to the slight extent and the shape of the membrane, it was impossible to determine the existence of any nodal line. In a second experiment, the cavity of the tym- panum was opened, so as to expose the ossi- cles of the ear and their muscles; and it was observed that when the internus mallei muscle

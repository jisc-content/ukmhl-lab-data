The clitoris, (Jig. 455, c,) which is of considerable length, and very much resembles the penis of the male, is pierced for the passage of the urine, and thus constitutes a true urinary penis. Beyond this is a trans- verse slit of a slightly crescentic form, (Jig. 455, 2), which constitutes the opening of the vagina. There are none of those duplicatures of the integument which in other Mammalia constitute the labia and nymphce, but the skin is smooth. But one of the most curious points in the structure of these parts is that in the virgin state this vaginal aperture does not exist, (Jig. 455, 1,) the skin being per- fectly and tightly drawn over the entrance; so that there are in this state but two openings, the urethral and the intestinal. So perfectly is this the case that it is very difficult to know a virgin female mole from the male by mere external examination. As this covering is so tense, the utility of the little bone at the extremity of the penis in the male is very obvious, and its pointed and tapering form is at once accounted for : it is clearly intended to perforate this tense covering to the vagina. Another peculiarity in this animal is that the abdominal cavity being extended greatly be- yond the pelvis, the vagina, the rectum, and the urinary passage terminate considerably fur- ther back than in other animals. The opening of the rectum is opposite to the articulation of the fourth with the fifth caudal vertebra. The uterus is of considerable size in the mole, and its cornua much convoluted.

770 HIBERNATION. ing the comparative temperature of the animal with that of the atmosphere. The slightest ex- citement induces a degree of respiration, with the consequent evolution of heat. The plan which is best adapted to determine this question in regard to the bat, and which I have adopted, together with every attention to preserve the animal quiet and undisturbed, is the following : a box was made of mahogany, with a glass lid, divided horizontally at its mid- dle part, by a fold of strong riband, and of such dimensions as just to contain the animal. The bat was placed upon the riband, and in- closed by fixing the lid in its place. Being lethargic, it remained in undisturbed quiet. A thermometer, with a cylindrical bulb, was now passed through an orifice made in the box on a level with the riband, under the epigastrium of the animal, and left in this situation. This arrangement is made obvious by the subjoined wood-cut, (fig. 306,) which also displays the mode of examining the circulation. It was only now necessary to make daily ob- servations and comparisons between this ther- mometer and another placed in the adjacent at- mospheric air. The layer of silk, and the por- tion of air underneath, protected the animal from the immediate influence of the tempera- ture of the table, on which the box was placed. The following table gives the result of obser- vations made during many days, in very vary- ing temperatures. Temperature of Temperature Date. the Atmosphere, of the Animal.

When the changes of temperature in the latter are slight, the two thermometers denote the same temperature. If these changes are greater and more rapid, the temperature of the animal is a little lower or higher, according as the external temperature rises or falls; a little time being obviously re- quired for the animal to attain that temperature. Similar observations were made during the first three days of February. On the 4th, how- ever, the temperature of the atmosphere rose to 50§°; that of the animal was now 82°, and there was considerable restlessness. On the 6th, the temperature of the atmosphere had fallen to 474 , and that of the animal to 48°, whilst there was a return of the lethargy. After this period there were the same equal alterations of temperature in the animal and in the atmosphere, observed in the month of January. It is only necessary to add to these observa- tions, that the internal temperature is about three degrees higher than that of the epigas- trium. In two bats, the external temperature of each of which was 36°, a fine thermometer, with an extremely minute cylindrical bulb, passed gently into the stomach, rose to 39°. The following experiments, made by the celebrated Jenner, illustrate this point: " In the winter, the atmosphere at 44°, the heat of a torpid hedgehog at the pelvis was 45°, and at the diaphragm 48^°. " The atmosphere 26°, the heat of a torpid hedgehog, in the cavity of the abdomen, was reduced so low as 30°. " The same hedgehog was exposed to the cold atmosphere of 26° for two days, and the heat of the rectum was found to be 93°; the wound in the abdomen being so small that it would not admit the thermometer.* * The animal had become lively, on the Animal (Economy, p. 113.

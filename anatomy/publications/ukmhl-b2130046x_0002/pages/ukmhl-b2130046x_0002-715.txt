HERMAPHRODITISM. 697 A well-marked example of lateral herma- phroditism among the Crustacea has been re- corded by Dr. Nicholls.* In a lobster (Anta- eus murium) he found on the right side of the body a female sexual aperture in its normal situation at the root of trie third leg, and con- nected with a regularly formed oviduct, full of ova. On the left side of the animal there was a male sexual aperture placed, as usual, at the root of the fifth leg, and connected internally with an equally perfect testicle and spermatic cord. The general external conformation of the animal corresponded with its internal sexual structure, the right lateral half of the body presenting all the secondary characters and pe- culiarities of the female, and the left all those of the male; so that if split from head to tail, (to use Dr. Nicholls'mode of expression,) the animal would have been perfectly female on the right side, and perfectly male on the left. The investigations of Sir E. Homef led phy- siologists some years ago to believe that among Fishes lateral hermaphroditism constituted the natural type of sexual formation in the genera Myxine and Petromyzon ; but the later and more accurate observations of RathkeJ have shewn that these species are strictly bisexual, and that the opposite opinion had arisen from the kidneys of the female having been mistaken for the male testicles. Various instances, how- ever, are on record of fishes, known to be nor- mally bisexual, presenting from abnormal deve- lopement a lateral hermaphroditic structure, or a roe on one side, and a milt on the other. Such an hermaphroditic malformation has been met with in the genera Salmo,^ Gadus,\\ and Cy- prinus*\ and in the Merlangus vulgaris,** Aci- penser husorff and Esox lucius-H Of lateral hermaphroditism in Birds, we have * Phil.

The older error of Cavolini, who supposed that he had detected two ovaries and two testicles in the Perca marina and Labrus channa, (Sulla Generazione dei Peschi et dei Granchi, Nap. 1787,) had been previously shewn by Rudolphi to depend upon his having mistaken undeveloped portions of the ovaries for testicles.

The external appearance of the bird presented a mixture of the characters of the two sexes. Rudolphi has referred to a second and more ancient example of lateral hermaphroditism in the hen, mentioned by Ileide.f The case, en- titled by the author " galli qui putabatur her- maphroditus anatome rudis," is so imperfectly detailed as not to be entitled to much attention. We have ourselves been fortunate enough to meet with two domestic fowls that presented in their sexual organization examples of lateral her- maphroditism. In the first of these cases (fig. 290) the female sexual organs were placed on the Fig. 290. left side of the body, and the ovary (a) and ovi- duct (b) were in all respects apparently natu- rally formed. On the right side, a male vas deferens (</), of about half the normal length, * Naturgeschichte der Voegel, &c. Bd. ii, s. 1219, (1807). + Anatome Mytuli: subjecta est Centuria Obser.

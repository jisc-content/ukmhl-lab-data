782 ABNORMAL CONDITIONS OF THE HIP-JOINT. however, the weight of the body is almost entirely thrown on the unaffected limb, the latter becomes much larger and stronger than usual, while the malformed limb falls into a state of more or less of atrophy from want of use; its circulation in general seems more languid, and its nervous energies and tempera- ture are less than those of the well-formed ex- tremity ; add to this, as we have already noticed (what might be expected,) that in consequence of the centre of gravity being so uniformly thrown on the sound limb, a lateral curvature of the spine takes place, and a great mobility of the sacro-lumbar articulation exists. Anatomical characters of this affection.— Opportunities for ascertaining the anatomy of this congenital defect, whether both hip-joints be implicated or one only affected, are very rare. Although Dupuytren has seen so many patients afflicted with this malformation, he has had very few opportunities, he says, of study- ing its anatomy, because the affection is not a disease, but an infirmity which has no tendency to shorten life. With respect to the muscles he has remarked, that some of them around the joint are found to be well developed, while others are in a state of atrophy: the first are those which have still preserved their functions, the second are those whose action has been restrained by changes induced in the position and form of the parts : some of these latter, he says, are reduced to a sort of yellow fibrous tissue, in which we can scarcely discover mus- cular fibre. The cotyloid cavity of the os ilii in some cases scarcely can be said to exist, so irregular are the traces of it; sometimes an irregular bony eminence occupies its place, having no cartilaginous covering, no rudiment of cotyloid ligament; it is merely surrounded by resistant cellular tissue, and covered by muscles which pass by it to be inserted into the little tro- chanter. Sometimes, says Dupuytren, I have found the ligamentum teres of the articulation much elongated, flattened superiorly, and worn as it were in certain points by the pressure and friction of the head of the femur; the latter is lodged in a cavity analogous enough to that which we find formed in cases of luxation up- wards and outwards, which have been left for a long time unreduced. This cavity (if such it can be called) is situated in the external iliac fossa, above and behind the usual situation of the cotyloid cavity, at a height proportioned to the shortening of the limb, or degree of ascent of the head of the femur. The superior portion of the femur preserves in all its parts, its form, its dimensions, and its natural relations, only the internal side, and the anterior part of the head of this bone has sometimes lost its rounded form, a circumstance which would ap- pear to result from the friction which it has been subjected to by its frequent contact with parts which have not been organized to receive it. The writer's observation does not entirely correspond with this account of the superior portion of the femur preserving its form and natural relations with the rest of the bone. He has usually noticed that the head of the femur has lost its spheroidal shape, and presents somewhat of a conical appearance, as Dupuy- tren well describes ; but two other circumstances he has observed in almost all the cases he has examined, whether in the recent dissections he has himself witnessed, or in the macerated bones he has seen in Dublin or elsewhere :— 1st, that the neck of the femur, instead of having its axis directed, as it naturally is, from behind forwards, upwards, and inwards, has in this malformation lost its usual relation with the shaft of the thigh-bone, and the axis is directed upwards, and almost directly forwards. This alteration in the direction of the axis of the neck of the thigh-bone did not escape the observation of Dr. Hutton, in his remarks on his case already alluded to; he expressed his idea of the altered direction of the axis by say- ing that the axis of the neck in this case fell directly on the anterior part of the upper ex- tremity of the shaft: " the relative position of the neck and shaft appeared as it might be supposed to do if, the lower portion of the femur being- fixed, the upper portion were twisted forwards, the head moving through one fourth of a circle." 2dly. The other circumstance which the writer has noticed must be viewed in connec- tion with this altered direction of the usual axis of the neck of the femur just alluded to ; it is that in all the cases he has as yet seen of this original luxation of the femur, the head of the thigh-bone, instead of being directed back- wards, as it is in the ordinary luxation on the dorsum ilii, on the contrary has been directed forwards, and has been placed beside the anterior inferior spinous process of the ilium, while the trochanter major has been directed backwards on the dorsum ilii. It is rather strange that a relative position of the bones of the hip-joint, so different from what has been observed in the ordinary dis- location upwards on the dorsum ilii, and one so usually met with in the case of original lux- ation of the hip-joint, should have heretofore escaped observation. In one of the specimens of malformation of the hip-joint preserved by Mr. Harrison in the Museum of the University of Dublin, this relative position of the femur and the anterior inferior spine of the ilium can be noticed, while the trochanter major is placed posterior to both. And in two preparations preserved in the Richmond Hospital Museum, the same observation can be made,—the atrophied heads of the thigh-bones are directed forwards; the great trochanters lie behind these heads on the sides of the pelvis. These are circumstances important for us to keep in mind, when we are considering the diagnosis of the various affections of the hip- joint. We say that such a remarkable circumstance demands notice from us, because in the cases of this affection we have as yet observed in the living subject, the thigh, leg, and foot of the malformed limb has not been so much inverted as it always is in the ordinary luxation upwards and backwards on the dorsum ilii; indeed in the case of a lad, named Hannon, whom the writer

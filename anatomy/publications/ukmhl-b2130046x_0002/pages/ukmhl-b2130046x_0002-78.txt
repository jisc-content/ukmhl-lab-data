84 REGION -OF THE ELBOW. the other division of the median vein, called median cephalic, passes obliquely upwards and outwards, external to the prominence formed by the biceps, and joins the cephalic at an acute angle above the external condyle. The cephalic, the basilic, and the two divi- sions of the median vein joining them, form a figure which somewhat resembles the Roman capital letter M. The superficial lymphatic vessels follow the course of the veins; those on the internal side are larger and enter small ganglions, varying in number from two to five, which are situated in the subcutaneous cellular tissue, above and in front of the internal condyle, where they are sometimes seen swollen and inflamed in consequence of inflammatory affections of the hand or fore-arm. The subcutaneous nerves are : branches of the internal cutaneous, usually three or four in number, the external cutaneous, and some twigs from the radial and ulnar nerves. The branches of the internal cutaneous pass down to the fore-arm, generally superficial to the basilic and median basilic veins, while the external cutaneous lies deeper than the ce- phalic and median cephalic, with the latter of which it is more intimately connected. Some twigs from both the internal and the external cutaneous nerves are distributed to the inte- guments behind the elbow. Aponeurosis.—The aponeurosis of the region of the elbow is continuous with the brachial aponeurosis above, and with that of the fore- arm inferiorly; it is strong behind the elbow, where it receives an expansion from the tendon of the triceps, and has an intimate adhesion to the margin of the olecranon: on each side it is firmly attached to the condyles of the hu- merus, sending off several layers from its internal surface, which form septa between the origins of the muscles of the fore-arm which arise from these processes: anteriorly it is spread over the triangular depression, where its strength is considerably increased by ex- pansions which it receives from the tendons of the biceps and the brachials amicus ; the ex- pansion from the brachiaeus anticus comes forward on the external side of the tendon of the biceps, and is lost over the external mus- cular prominence of the fore-arm in front of the external condyle ; the expansion from the biceps forms a narrow band about half an inch in breadth where it is first detached from the tendon of that muscle; it then descends obliquely to the inner side of the fore-arm, on the aponeurosis of which it is lost about two inches below the inner condyle. Superiorly this expansion crosses over the brachial artery, and its superior margin is defined by a lunated border to which the brachial aponeurosis is attached, while its inferior margin is con- founded with the aponeurosis of the fore- arm. From the above described attachments of the tendons of the biceps and brachiaeus an- ticus to the aponeurosis of this region, it fol- lows as a necessary consequence that the con- tractions of these muscles must have the effect of rendering it more tense. The aponeurosis of the arm assumes the form of a very thin fascia as it approaches the superior margin of the expansion of the biceps ; at this place it often appears to degenerate into cellular tissue which covers an oval space placed obliquely, the broader extremity of which is below, being bounded by the expan- sion of the biceps externally and inferiorly, and by a sort of defined border terminating the lower margin of the brachial aponeurosis superiorly and internally: in this oval space the brachial artery and the median nerve which lies to its inner side are more thinly covered than in any other part of their course. The aponeurosis is also very weak on the external side of the expansion of the biceps, where it is pierced by the deep branch of the median vein, and by the external cutaneous nerve which comes from beneath the aponeurosis at this place. The brachial artery terminates by dividing into the radial and ulnar arteries in the tri- angular depression, which is bounded exter- nally by the supinator longus and internally by the pronator radii teres. This artery enters the region of the elbow on the internal side of the tendon of the biceps included in a common sheath with its two venae comites, one of which lies on either side of it; it lies on the surface of the brachiaeus anticus, and, becoming deeper as it descends, it divides into the radial and ulnar arteries at about an inch below the level of the internal condyle. The median nerve lies internal to it, separated from it at first by cellular tissue; lower down, where this nerve pierces the pro- nator teres, the external origin of that muscle arising from the coronoid process is interposed between it and the artery : the radial and ulnar arteries, while still in this region, give off their recurrent branches, which pass upwards, encir- cling the condyles of the humerus, to anasto- mose with the profundae and anastomotic branches of the brachial, as described in the article Brachial Artery. The venae comites of the brachial, radial, and ulnar arteries are double : these vessels are also accompanied by a deep set of lymphatics. The nerves which traverse this region beneath the aponeurosis are, the median on the internal side of the brachial artery; the radial, which, descending between the brachiaeus anticus and the supinator radii longus, then between the biceps and ex- tensor carpi radialis, divides into two branches, the posterior of which passes between the supi- nator brevis and extensor carpi radialis brevior to the muscles on the back part of the fore-arm, while the anterior branch or proper radial nerve descends in the fore-arm under the su- pinator radii longus. The trunk of the ulnar nerve passes behind the internal condyle, and entering between the two heads of the flexor carpi ulnaris follows that muscle down the fore-arm. Development.—In early life the condyles of the humerus are not so well marked, nor is

392 GASTEROPODA. across the other viscera, and communicating with the ventricle near its middle. The blood arrives at the heart through four vessels from the long fringe of branchiae, two comina; from the anterior and two from the posterior parts. We have already described the disposition of the branchiae in the Tectibranchiate order, but in following the course of the circulating fluid, we shall find in some of the individuals in- cluded in this division circumstances requiring special notice, as being of extreme interest to the physiologist. In Aplysia, the blood re- turned from the system is brought by two lars;e venous trunks to the vena cava or pulmonary artery (fig. 191, b); for in this case the same Fig. 191. vessel performs the functions of both; these large veins turn round in the vicinity of the operculum, and unite into one trunk prior to their dispersion over the branchial plates, but on opening them at this point so as to display their interior, a most singular arrangement is brought to light; the sides of the veins are found to be formed of muscular bands (c) crossing each other in various directions, and leaving spaces between them ; these intervals are seen even by the naked eye to be apertures establishing a free communication between the interior of the vein and the abdominal cavity, and allowing injection to pass with facility from the vein into the visceral cavity, or from the abdomen into the vein : the anterior portion of each of these vessels may indeed be said to be literally confounded with the general cavity of the the body, a few muscular bands, forming no obstacle to a perfect communication, being the only separation between the two. It is there- fore evident that the fluids contained in the abdominal cavity may in this manner have free access to the mass of the blood as it approaches the respiratory organ, and that the veins can thus perform the office of the ab- sorbent system ; but in what mariner the blood is prevented from escaping through the same channels is not at all obvious, although pro- bably during life the contraction of the fasci- culi which bound these apertures may in some measure obstruct the intercourse. It is from this circumstance, and the analogous commu- nication which exists in the Cephalopoda by the intervention of the spongy appendages to the venaa cavae found in those Mollusks, that Cuvier was led to the conclusion that in all the class the veins are the immediate agents of absorption, and that an absorbent system does not exist in any but the vertebrate division of the animal kingdom. We meet, moreover, in Aplysia with another peculiarity in the cir- culating vessels; the aorta, shortly after its commencement, divides into two large arteries (A //'), one of which presents nothing peculiar in its distribution; but to the larger of the two, whilst still enclosed in the pericardium, we find appended a remarkable structure, the use of which has been hitherto perfectly inexpli- cable : projecting from the opposite sides of the vessel are two vascular crests, represented in if formed of a plexus of vessels issuing from the aorta itself, and ramifying in an ex- ceedingly beautiful manner through the sub- stance of these extraordinary organs ; in other respects the arteries are distributed in the usual manner. The Cyclobranchiate and Scutibran- chiate Gasteropods approximate the testaceous class in many points of their organization, but in none more so than in the position which the heart is found to occupy, and the arrangement of its cavities. In Patella, indeed, the heart is placed in the anterior part of the body, and still conforms in its general structure to the description which we have given above ; but in Oscabrio the auricle is divided into two distinct portions, one receiving the blood from each range of branchial plates ; and in Haliotis, Fissurclla, Emargenula, and Parmophorus, not only is this division of the auricle met with, but the ventricle, as in many of the testaceous Mollusks, is perforated by the rectum, and the similarity of arrangement which is here presented with what is met with in the Con- chifera will be readily appreciated by a refer- ence to the article which treats of the anatomy of that division of the Mollusca. Nervous system.â€”The nervous system of the Gasteropoda furnishes us with the most perfect form of the heterogangliate, or as it has beenlesshappily denominated, cyclo-gangliated type. It consists of a variable number of ganglia or nervous centres disposed in different parts of the body, but connected with each other by cords of communication, and from these ganglia the nerves appropriated to dif- ferent parts proceed. Each ganglion, therefore, is a distinct brain; and were the preponderance in size to be regarded as the criterion of rela- tive importance, it would not unfrequently be hard to say to which the pre-eminence is due. There is, however, as we shall soon perceive, an uniformity in the arrangement of certain masses, and a regularity in the appropriation of the nerves proceeding from them to parti- cular organs, which leave us little room for

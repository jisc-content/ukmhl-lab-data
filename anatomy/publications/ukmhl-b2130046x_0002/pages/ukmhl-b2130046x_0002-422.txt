ORGANS OF GENERATION. 408 found rolling loosely within the body of the larger animalcule, effecting their rotatory move- ments by the agency of cilia of extreme minute- ness, which under a good microscope are seen to cover their external surface. The contained globules having attained a sufficient maturity, the parent volvox bursts, and thus by its own destruction allows its progeny to escape from their imprisonment. The multiplication of these animalcules is effected with considerable rapidity, and it not unfrequently happens that even before the escape of the second generation the gem mules of a third may be observed within their bodies, which in like manner advancing through similar stages of development will ter- minate by their birth the existence of their parent.* It would appear from the observations of Professor Grant, that in the sponges, notwith- standing their different form, the process of re- production is entirely similar. In these curious animals the gemmules are developed in the substance of that living parenchyma which coats their porous skeletons, and when mature are expelled through the fcecal orifices to com- mence an independent existence. When sepa- rated from the parent sponge, these gemmules, like those of the volvox, are ciliated over a great portion of their surface, and being thus endowed with a power of locomotion, are enabled to swim to a considerable distance in search of a situation adapted to their future growth, until having at length selected a permanent support, they become attached, and developing within themselves the spicular or horny skeleton pecu- liar to their species, they gradually assume the porous texture and particular character of the sponge from which they were produced. But it is in the gelatinous Polypes that we meet with the most perfect forms of gemmi- ferous propagation : of this the Hydra viridis, orfresh-water polype, affordsan interesting illus- tration, and from the facility with which it may be procured and examined by glasses of very ordinary powers, it is well calculated to illus- trate the mode of generation which we are at present considering. The body of this simple polype is transparent, and under the microscope appears to be entirely made up of translucent granules, without any trace of internal appara- tus appropriated to reproduction. The gem- mules by which it is propagated sprout from some part of the surface, appearing first as mere gelatinous excrescences, but gradually enlarging they assume the form of their parent, acquiring similar filamentary tentacles and a gastric cavity of the same simple structure. As long as the junction between the polype and its off- spring continues, both seem to enjoy a commu- nity of being, the food caught by the original one being destined for the nourishment of both ; but at length, the newly-formed animal having at- tained a certain bulk, and become capable of employing its own tentacles for the prehension of food, detaches itself with an effort, and as- * [Some physiologists, however, refer the genera- tion of this creature to the fissiparous mode. See the succeeding article.—En.] sumes an independent existence. This mode of multiplication is exceedingly rapid, a few hours sufficing for the perfect developement of the young creature; and not unfrequently even before its separation, another gemmule may be observed emerging from the newly-formed polype, soon to exhibit the same form and ex- ercise the same functions as the parent from which it sprouts. The propagation of some of the lithophytour polypes resembles that of the hydra, the young being produced from buds or gemmules, which sprout from the living investment of their cal- careous skeleton. Such are the Fungia, in which the young are at first pedunculated, and fixed to the laminae upon the upper surface of the mass from which they spring; in this state they might readily be mistaken for solitary Caryophyllia, but in time they separate from the parent stock, and loosing the pedicle which originally supported them, they assume the form of their species. Oviferous generation.—In the third, and by far the most numerous division of the animal kingdom, the young are derived from ova or eggs, in which the germ of the future being is evolved, and from which the young animals escape in a more or less perfect state. It will be seen that the ovum which gives birth to all the higher animals differs essentially from the gemma furnished by the gemmiferous classes; in the gemmiferous type the bud or offshoot of the parent appears by a kind of vegetative evolution to assume the proportions and functions of the original from which it sprang. The ovum we would define as a nidus, containing not only the germ of the future animal, but a sufficient quantity of nu- tritious matter, serving as a pabulum to the embryo during its earliest state of existence, and supplying the materials for its growth until sufficiently mature to derive them from other sources. We have already shewn that in the fissiparous and gemmiferous animals there is no necessity for any special generative appa- ratus, but in the oviferous classes we find, for the most part, a distinct system, more or less complicated in structure, in which the repro- ductive ova are developed and matured. It must be confessed, however, that in the present state of our knowledge upon this subject we are not prepared to state how far the existence of a generative system is exclusively confined to the ovigerous type. We are well aware that many authors describe generative canals to exist in several of the polypiferous tribes, although the reproductive germs produced from them resemble in their ciliated organs of pro- gression and mode of development the gem- mules of less elaborately organized polypes; yet, on the other hand, as we have abundant evidence to prove that such polypes as have the ovigerous canals most distinctly formed, as the Actinias for instance, produce their young per- fectly organized and evidently developed from true ova, we are content, in the present state of our knowledge upon this subject, to regard the presence of generative canals as co-existent with ovigerous generation, and shall leave

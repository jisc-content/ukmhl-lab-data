380 GASTEROPODA. scribing it we shall avoid obscurity by applying to its different parts the names ordinarily made use of by anatomists to distinguish the tissues enumerated as composing the human integu- ment. The dermis is an extremely lax and cellular texture, eminently elastic, and so intimately blended with the contractile layers beneath it, that it is difficult to recognise it as a distinct structure : its great peculiarity consists in the power which it possesses of secreting calcareous matter, which being deposited either in a cavity within its substance, or as is more frequently the case, upon its outer surface, forms a con- cealed or external shell: from this circum- stance, and from the abundant quantity of mucus which it constantly furnishes, we may infer its great vascularity, while the high degree of sensibility which it evidently possesses une- quivocally demonstrates that it is plentifully supplied with nerves, although the existence of a true papillary structure cannot be satisfac- torily distinguished. The colouring pigment likewise exists, as is evident from the brilliant markings which are often met with in some of the more highly coloured species; but there is a circumstance in connection with this rete mucosum which requires particular mention, as it will enable us afterwards more clearly to ex- plain the formation of shells; the pigment is not merely a layer which serves to paint the surface of the body generally, but appears ra- ther to be an infiltration of the lax tissue of the cutis with coloured fluid, which is poured out in great abundance at particular points, espe- cially around the margin of the shell, and there being mixed up with the calcareous matter se- creted by the collar, its tints are transferred to the exterior of the shell itself, tinging it with similar hues. The epidermis is evidently defi- cient, its place being supplied by the viscid matter with which the surface of the body is continually lubricated. The muciparous crypts destined to furnish the copious supply of glairy fluid with which the skin is so largely moist- ened, have not been detected, but the pores through which it exudes are sufficiently distinct. It is in connexion with the needful diffusion of this secretion over the entire animal, that the skin of the terrestrial species, as the Slugs and Snails, is observed to be deeply furrowed by larg€ anastomosing channels, formed by the rugae of the surface, and serving as canals for its conveyance by a species of irrigation to every point. No pilous system, properly so called, exists in any of the Gasteropods, the hairy covering of many shells being, as we shall presently see, of a widely different nature. From the modifications observable in the structure of the integument, it is not to be won- dered at that names have been applied to diffe- rent portions, which it will be useful to notice, especially as they are not unfrequently used in a confused and unprecise manner. That por- tion of the skin which is more immediately connected with the secretion of the shell, in such Gasteropoda as are provided with a de- fence of that description, has been termed the mantle, and in certain instances, from the mode in which it seems to form a special coering to a part of the body, it has some claim to the name; the mantle is, however, extremely varia ble, both in position and arrangement. In the Nudibranchiata, which have no shell, it cannot be said to exist, as no fold of the integument or defined margin indicating a portion deserving of a distinct appellation can be detected. In the Tectibranchiata the mantle is a small trian- gular fold of the integument on the right side of the body, inclosing a rudimentary shell, and serving as a covering to the subjacent branchiae. In the Inferobranchiata it invests the whole of the back, and forms a fold around the margins of the body, beneath which the branchiae are found ; whilst in all the conchiferous Gastero- pods it lines the interior of the shell, whatever its shape, forming a distinct fold or thickened rim around its aperture, to which when much developed, as in Helix, the name of collar is not improperly applied. In the naked terrestrial species the mantle consists of a thickened portion, occupying a variable position on the back, and more or less defined by a distinct margin; it is here not un- frequently termed the corselet, and generally contains a calcareous plate. In Vaginula it covers the whole of the back; in Umax it occu- pies only its anterior portion; in Parmacella it is found in the middle of the dorsal region, whilst in Testacella it is placed quite poste- riorly in the vicinity of the tail; yet whatever its situation, shape, or size, it is the immediate agent in the formation of the shell, and as such we have deemed it necessary to be thus precise in describing the different aspects which it assumes. Growth of shell.—The varied and beautiful shells that form so important a part of the inte- gument of many individuals belonging to this order, however they may differ in external form and apparent complication, are essentially simi- lar in composition and in the manner of their growth. These calcareous defences, although serving in many cases as a support to the ani- mal, from which important muscles take their origin, differ widely from the internal skeletons of vertebrate animals, being mere excretions from the surface of the body, absolutely extra- vital and extra-vascular, their growth being en- tirely carried on by the addition of calcareous particles deposited in consecutive layers. The dermis or vascular portion of the integument is the secreting organ which furnishes the earthy matter, pouring it out apparently from any part of the surface of the body, although the thicker portion, distinguished by the appellation of the mantle, is more especially adapted to its pro- duction. The calcareous matter is never depo- sited in the areolae of the dermis itself, but ex- udes from the surface, suspended in the mucus which is so copiously poured out from the mu- ciparous pores, and gradually hardening by ex- posure; this calciferous fluid forms a layer of shell, coating the inner surface of the pre-exist- ent layers to increase the size of the original shell, or else is furnished at particular points for the reparation of injuries which accident may have occasioned. It is to the investiga-

839 ILIAC ARTERIES. external iliac. It forms a stratum of some thickness and considerable resistance, deserving of much attention in a practical point of view; there are imbedded in it immediately above the crural arch, and superficial to the artery, one or more lymphatic glands; the genito-erural nerve also descends enclosed in this structure, at the outside of the artery. Beneath the investment, and immediately above the crural arch, an ex- pansion of limited extent, presenting frequently a true fibrous or aponeurotic character, arises from the front of the vessels, and passing forward becomes identified with the fascia transversalis upon its internal surface; thus connecting the vessels to the anterior part of the superior aperture of the femoral sheath, and closing the interval between these parts, which otherwise would be unguarded. In the second place the artery is covered anteriorly through about four-fifths of its course by the peritoneum of the iliac fossa ; in the inferior fifth, i.e., for from half to three-fourths of an inch immediately above the crural arch, the membrane passing from the front of the artery to the anterior wall of the abdomen leaves the iliac artery uncovered; and hence the practical inference that the external iliac artery may be tied without disturbing the peritoneum. Beneath the peritoneum the artery is crossed at the inferior part of its course by the sper- matic vessels, and at the superior, upon the right side very frequently by the ureter. Thirdly, the viscera of the iliac fossa on the one hand, or of the pelvis on the other, ac- cording to circumstances, cross or overlap it; on the right, the ccecum and the termination of the ileum ; on the left, the sigmoid flexure and the commencement of the rectum, and on both sides the small intestines are placed in front of it. And when the viscera of the pelvis become distended and rise from the cavity they overlap it from that side. The third relation of the artery in front is the anterior wall of the iliac region ; the details of this it is not proposed to examine at length, but only so far as they may be concerned in the relations of the artery ; the structures com- posing the wall being numerous, they may be conveniently arranged into three sets, viz., the superficial, the intermediate, and the deep or lining structures. The superficial structures are three, the skin, the subcutaneous cellular tissue, and the fascia. Of these the first does not require to be dwelt upon ; the second is subject to much variety in its condition ; it forms a stratum of considerable thickness in every case ; when, however, the superficial cellular structure of the body is charged with much adeps, it then forms an uniform and thick stratum of fat without any distinction into lamina;; this is best exemplified at the early periods of life, particularly in children cut off by an acute disease; when, on the contrary, the body is emaciated, it forms a condensed cellular ex- pansion much thinner than in the former case, and divisible frequently into laminoe. This structure is continued from the iliac over the other regions of the abdomen, downward upon the thigh, and in the middle line upon the spermatic process of the male and the organs of generation. Numerous superficial vessels are contained in and ramify through it; these are derived from several sources, but that which is proper to the iliac region is the superficial epigastric artery which ascends from the femoral superficial to the aponeurosis of the external oblique muscle and intermediate to the inguinal rings. Beneath the subcutaneous stratum is the third superficial structure, the fascia ; this is a thin dense expansion by which the external oblique muscle and its aponeurosis are covered ; it is not confined to the abdomen, but is con- tinued into a similar expansion upon the ad- joining regions whether upward or downward ; it adheres closely to the muscular portion of the oblique, particularly at the junction of the muscular fibres with the aponeurosis along the linea semilunaris, but its connection to the aponeurosis itself is more free, an extensible and delicate cellular tissue being interposed. Hence it is easily detached from the latter; it is most dense, fibrous, and strong upon the iliac region ; as it ascends thence it becomes less dense and fibrous, and assumes more of a simply condensed cellular character; it is not equally distinct in every subject, in all it can be recognized at the crural arch, and for some distance above it, but as it recedes from the arch it frequently seems to be gradually re- solved and to cease. Below, it is attached posteriorly to the outer edge of the crest of the ilium, and along this line it meets the insertion of the fascia lata of the bock of the thigh ; in front between the superior anterior spinous process of the ilium and the spinous process of the pubis it descends over the crural arch, having only a cellular connection to it, and being separable with ease from it, as well as from the aponeurosis of the oblique ; immediately below the arch it is united to the superficial surface of the fascia of the thigh, both externally and internally, on the latter side passing back to the pectineal line of the pubis, into which it is inserted along with the pubic portion of the fascia lata; in the interval between the spinous processes of the pubis it is prolonged down- ward upon the spermatic processes, and is continued upon them in the form of a sheath into the scrotum, where it invests the testicle ; it is very thin and transparent upon the spermatic process. The existence of this structure, to which attention appears to have been first directed by Camper, can always be demon- strated however fat or young the subject may be, though, as has been stated, it is not always equally manifest; it seems distinct from the subcutaneous cellular structure, which frequently forms a uniform and thick stratum of fat be- tween it and the skin. Different views have been taken of its nature; by Scarpa it is re- garded as a prolongation of the fascia lata of the thigh, while others and the majority consider it as a continuation of the superficial fascia, so called, of the same part, and formed by the deep stratum of the abdominal subcutaneous cellular

239 FEMOKAI- ARTERY. which is called its cribriform portion, and over the course of the femoral artery, across which they are placed obliquely: they are separated from the vessel hy the superficial lamina of the iliac portion of the fascia, and by the prolongation of the fascia transversal is, with the interposed cellular structure; and they derive numerous arterial and venous branches from the main trunks bene ath : those branches, which are given off partly by the vessels themselves, and partly by their super- ficial pudic, superficial epigastric, and su- perficial anterior iliac branches, pass through the interposed structures in order to reach the glands; in doing so they carry with them sheaths from the fascia lata, which is prolonged upon each as it < scapes, and thus they become the means of establishing that connection be- tween the fascia in the groin and die subcu- taneous stratum, in which the glands are enveloped, which is considered to influence so remarkably the course of femoral hernia. The glands of the second set are less nu- merous, are situate farther from Poupart's ligament than the former, being below the entrance of the saphena ; they are also deeper seated, lying upon the fascia lata, and they are placed with their longer diameter parallel, or nearly so, to the femur and to the course of the artery. Their relation to the artery is not in all cases the same, inasmuch as the disposition of neither part is strictly uniform, hut usually one or two of them lie over the vessel, or immediately on either side of its course; their relation to it, however, is, in the natural condition of the parts, not of great consequence; for in such case they may be easily held aside during operation if necessary, and thus both they and their lymphatic vessels be saved from injury. The relation of the inguinal glands, more particularly the superior, to the femoral artery suggests several inferences. 1st, That the very commencement of the artery's course, although the situation in which the vessel is nearest to the surface, and that in which it can be most easily distinguished by its pulsa- tion, is yet not the most eligible part at which to expose it, since the glands and their vessels cannot, by any precaution of the surgeon, be protected certainly from injury. 2dly, That phagedenic ulceration of the glands of the groin must be attended with great danger from the vicinity of the great vessels. 3dly, That hemorrhage consequent upon such ulceration does not necessarily proceed from those vessels themselves; but that it may, and in the ma- jority of cases in the first instance probably does arise from the branches supplying the glands ; and, 4th, That the groin is likely to be the seat of pulsating tumours requiring to be distinguished from aneurism. The third covering of the artery is the superficial lamina of the iliac portion of the fascia lata. This portion having covered the an- terior surface of the iliacus and psoas muscles as far as the middle of Poupart's ligament, along which it is attached from without inward, divides at that point into two laminae, a deep one and a superficial one; the former passes inward and backward from the ligament, upon the psoas muscle, to the ilio-pectineal eminence of the os innominatum, into which it is in- serted, continued thence upward, upon the inside of the muscle, along the brim of the pelvis into the fascia iliaca, and downward across the capsule of the ilio-femoral articula- tion, to which it is also attached : it is in fact that part of the fascia iliaca, (for the fascia iliaca and the iliac portion of the fascia lata are one and the same expansion, distinguished from each other only by Poupart's ligament,) which is situate upon the inside of the psoas magnus, and which forms the outer wall of the femoral canal, being interposed between the femoral artery and the muscle. At the iho- pectineal eminence it also meets and is iden- tified with the pubic portion of the fascia lata, which is attached to the pectineal line of the pubis, in continuation with this deep lamina of the iliac portion, covers the pectinalis muscle, and is situated immediately behind the vessels. When that part of the deep lamina of the iliac portion of the fascia lata which extends from Poupart's ligament to the ilio-pectineal eminence has had the prolonga- tion of the fascia downward detached from it, it appears as an oblique partition dividing the crural arch into two parts, an external containing the iliacus and psoas muscles with the crural nerve, and an internal containing the femoral vessels. The second lamina of the iliac portion of the fascia lata—the superficial one — passes inward across the femoral vessels, superficial to them and to the prolongation of the fascia transversalis, until it has reached the inside of the vessels : it is at the same time attached above, in front of the vessels, and in con- tinuation with the iliac portion itself, to the inferior margin of Poupart's ligament, from its middle to the base of its third insertion— Gimbernat's ligament, and upon their inside along the base of the latter ligament as far as the pectineal line of the pubis, into which it is finally inserted, external to the base of Gimbemat, between it and the insertion of the fascia transversalis upon the inside of the aperture of the femoral sheath, and where it is also identified with the pubic portion of the fascia attached along the same line : from thence it is united to the anterior surface of the pubic portion of the fascia lata, down- ward along the inside of the vessels. The superficial lamina of the iliac portion is thus thrown across the front of the vessels, and by the disposition, which has been detailed, the fascia lata encloses the vessels between the two laminae, and forms, by means of them and their connection at either side, a canal, within which are contained the vessels and the prolongation of the fascia transversalis covering them in front. The constitution of the canal, as described, may be considered to extend from Poupart's ligament until the artery is about to be covered by the sartorius; from whence its anterior wall is formed, through the remainder of the vessel's course, by another

The others are small and resemble false molares. In Tupaia (fig. 452) these teeth are two on each side, distant from each other, and from the first false molar. The inferior incisores also vary greatly in their form and number. In Scalops there are two, the first small, the second larger and resembling in form a canine tooth. In Condytura there are two, rounded in front, flattened behind. In Talpa there are four similar to those of the upper jaw, and in Sorex there is one only of a very pecu- liar form : it is very long from the anterior to the posterior part, somewhat hooked, pointed, and, in_ some species, the edge is notched or trifid. There are no true canines, according to the opinion of Frederick Cuvier, in any of these animals, excepting Condytura, Talpa, (in which they exist in the upper jaw only) Centenes, and Tupaia. The first tooth be- yond the incisores, considered by Fred. Cuvier as the first false molar in the lower jaw in the mole, is by Baron Cuvier termed the canine. In Centenes these teeth are of the normal form ; and in fact the general arrrangement of the teeth in this genus indicates a marked approach towards the Carnivora. In Condytura the su- perior canine is strong and large; the inferior merely rudimentary. The molares, as in the other Zoophaga, are divided into false and true. Those of the

310 ILIAC ARTERIES. structure converted by condensation or removal of its adeps into an expansion ; to me it appears that the view taken of its nature by Scarpa is cor- rect, not in the sense that it is a prolongation of the fascia lata, but that it is of the same nature, and that it is to the abdomen the same structure which the fascia lata is to the thigh ; it is a question entitled to consideration only for ac- curacy's sake, but I have frequently verified the inferior connections of this expansion such as they have been detailed, and further it appears to me that it is not properly continuous with the superficial fascia of the thigh, for if it be detached from the aponeurosis of the oblique muscle and the crural arch without injury to its connection with the fascia lata, and be then held perpendicular to the latter, the superficial fascia of the thigh may be removed from the angle which it will thus form with the fascia lata, and its connection still remain perfect: a favourable subject and a careful dissection will certainly be required for the purpose, but this circumstance will not invalidate the con- clusion ; it is also to be recollected in making the dissection, that the fascia detaches processes over the inguinal lymphatic glands. The structures of the second order of parts concerned with our subject, are the aponeurosis of the external oblique muscle, the internal oblique and the transversalis muscles; of these the first, which is immediately beneath the fascia, extends over the entire anterior wall of the fossa reaching from the linea semilunaris above to the crural arch below ; internally it is united with that of the other side in the linea alba, and inferiority it forms the crural arch by its border, which is attached externally to the superior anterior spinous process of the ilium, internally to the spinous process of the pubis, and in the interior to the iliac fascia and the fascia lata. The direction of this band is to be borne in mind, for it does not run directly from one of these points of bone to the other; but it descends toward the thigh, and recedes from the surface at the same time that it passes inÂ» ward, hence it is concave both forward toward the surface and upward toward the abdomen ; the cause of this direction is its connection inferiorly and posteriorly with the fascia lata and the fascia iliaca. The aponeurosis consists primarily of tendinous fibres which run in the same direction as the fibres of the muscle, i. e., downward and inward, parallel to each other, and also to the crural arch, though rather con- verging toward it internally, and thereby form a tendinous expansion; the longitudinal fibres of the aponeurosis are crossed by others which run downward and outward ; these are very irregular in number and do not interlace with the former, to which they are superficial; hence the aponeurosis does not possess great strength in the transverse direction, and its longitudinal fibres are liable to be separated, and deficien- cies to be thereby formed in the aponeurosis, which are not ^infrequently to be observed. The superficial inguinal ring is seated in the aponeurosis ; this aperture, for the particulars of which see the articles Abdomen and Herma, is of variable form and size; in some cases it is elliptical, in others triangular; in the male it is larger than in the female; its position is oblique, the longer diameter inclining from the pubis upward and outward toward the superior anterior spinous process of the ilium; its actual length is extremely variable, in some instances not amounting to half an inch, in others exceeding an inch. . The inferior part of the internal oblique and of the transversalis muscles, which alone is concerned in the anatomy of this part of the abdominal wall, may be distinguished into two parts, viz,, their muscular portion and their aponeurosis. The muscles are both, but more particularly the latter, very thin, though of great width ; they are placed the one within the other, and the internal oblique, which is super- ficial to the transversalis, also descends a good deal lower, so that its inferior margin approaches very close to the crural arch, leaving only suf- ficient space between them for the escape of the spermatic process, which it covers beneath the aponeurosis of the external oblique, and which in some instances passes between its fibres,* while the margin of the transversalis is at some distance from the arch, and rarely covers the process, at least to any extent, the process escaping from the deep ring, for the most part below the margin of the muscle; Cloquet has even seen the margin of the muscle so far as two fingers' breadth above the point of escape of the cord, and its fibres are usually pale, fine, and scattered. The muscular fibres of the lower part of the two muscles are at- tached to the anterior extremity of the crest of the ilium and to its spinous process, also to the superior aspect of the outer part of the crural arch, the oblique to nearly the outer half of the arch, the transverse to the outer third or fourth, but the ultimate attachment of the latter is to the surface of the fascia iliaca above the arch, to which they adhere very intimately as they pass forward from the fascia ; they run inward nearly transversely, but convex forward in proportion to the prominence of the abdo- men, those of the oblique over the deep ring, and the spermatic process within the inguinal canal, those of the transverse above the ring, until they have both passed that point; they then descend along the inside of the process, and at the same time recede from the surface so that they become posterior to it, and terminate as they descend in a thin irregular aponeurotic expansion common to the fibres of both mus- cles, and thence denominated " the conjoined tendon ;" though designated by an especial name, this is in reality only the inferior part of the general conjoined tendon of the two mus- cles which terminate between the umbilicus and the pubis in a common expansion ; this is placed superficial to the rectus muscle, and is inserted into the linea alba, the anterior margin of the crest of the pubis as far as its spinous process, and thence outward into the pectineal line of the bone, there forming the " conjoined tendon" of the anatomy of hernia. This struc- ture is situate behind the spermatic process, * Cloquet.

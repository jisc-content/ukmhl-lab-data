Part VII.] OF THE NERVES. From the Superior Ganglion, also, are sent off small Branches, which, uniting with Filaments from the La- ryngeus Superior, form the Ramus Cardiacus Supremus, vel Supetfcialis Cor dis. The Superficial Cardiac Nerve of the Sympathetic, in the Right Side, divides into Branches at the bottom of the Neck, which send a Filament or two along the In- ferior Laryngeal Artery to the Thyroid Gland, and af- terwards unite with the Superficial Cardiac Nerve of the Eighth Pair before the Subclavian Artery, and with the Laryngeal Nerve behind it.—In the Left Side, it termi- nates in the Cardiac Plexus of Nerves. From the Second, Third, and Fourth Cervical ^Nerves, an equal number of Cords descend behind the Scaleni and Rectus Major, to the middle Ganglion of the Great Sympathetic. From the opposite side of the Ganglion, Brandies are sent down, which join and form the Nervus Mag- nus Profundus : others are fixed to the Superficial Car- diac, and to the Recurrent of the Eighth Pair. The rest go partly over and partly behind the Subclavian Artery, to the Inferior Cervical, and to the first Tho- racic Ganglion. Nervi Accessorii ad Par Octavum.—The Acces- sory Nerves arise by small Filaments from the Lateral Parts of the Medulla Oblongata and upper portion of the Spinal Marrow. The Filaments from the Spinal Marrow come off be- tween the Anterior and Posterior Bundles of the Cer- vical Nerves,—the first of them frequently extending as far as the space between the Sixth and Seventh Pairs.

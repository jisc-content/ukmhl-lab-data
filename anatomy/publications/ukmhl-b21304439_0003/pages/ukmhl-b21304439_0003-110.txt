98 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [PartV. the Umbilicus, the other continued in the line of the Rectus. It furnishes Branches to the Muscles, Integuments, and Membranes of the fore part of the Abdomen, com- municates in several places with the Lumbar Arteries, and terminates a little above the Umbilicus, where it forms several distinct though small Anastomoses with the under end of the Mammaria Interna. Circumflexa Ossis Ilii, sometimes termed Iliaca Anterior.—The Circumflex Artery of the Ilium, almost as large as the Epigastric Artery, arises nearly opposite to it, though frequently a little lower,—immediately be- hind the under end of the Fallopian Ligament. It runs at the inner edge of the Crest or Spine of the Os Ilium, between the Transvcrsalis and Obliquus In- ternus, till it arrives near the Vertebrae of the Loins. It gives Branches to the Psoas, Uiacus, and Sarto- rius, to the under end of the Obiiqui and Transversus Abdominis, and at length communicates with the Epi- gastric, and with the Inferior Intercostal and the Lum- bar Arteries. Arteria Femoralis. The Femoral, or Crural Artery,—the continua- tion of the External Iliac,—passes out of the Abdomen between the Ligament of Poupart and Brim, of the Pelvis. At its first exit, it is situated superficially over the Bali of the Os Femoris, having the inner edge of the common

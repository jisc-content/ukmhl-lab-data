155 Part VII.] OF THE NERVES. âœ“ V sels and Fibres of Cellular Substance straitening the Nerves. Dr Monro considers them as Folds or Joints allow- ing the Nerves to accommodate themselves to the va- rious states of Flexion and Extension. The Nerves are supplied with Arteries from the neigh- bouring Blood-vessels, to which they return correspond- ing Veins. The Arteries, however, are small, and are injected with difficulty, excepting in the large Nerves, where they are more considerable, and where, after a minute injection, the Nerve receives the colour of the matter injected. Upon dividing the Nerves, they are not found to pos- sess much contractility ; while the Arteries, upon being cut, are observed to retract very considerably. They are generally lodged in the common Cellular Substance and Fat, and in the Interstices of the Viscera and Muscles, where they are protected from compres- sion ; though in several parts they are exposed to the hardness of Bones, or to the action of Muscles, over or through which they pass. In their course through the different parts of the Body, they generally run as straight as is consistent with the nature of the particular part over which they pass, and their own safety. In their progress, they divide into Braiichcsy which become gradually smaller, and which, though taken col- lectively, are inferior in size to the Trunks from which they issue. The i

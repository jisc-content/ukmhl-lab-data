217 Part VII.] OF THE NERVES. The Superior Mesenteric Plexus forms a Vagina, which surrounds, and in a great part conceals, the Trunk of the corresponding Artery. From this Plexus, numberless Filaments, many of diem extremely minute, are produced, which run through the Mesentery, partly with the Blood-vessels, and partly at a distance from them; and which, after supplying the Coats of the Vessels and Mesenteric Glands, are distributed to the small Intestines in general, and to the i’in;ht Portion of the Colon. The Nerves of the Colon are, in proportion to tho part they have to supply, larger than those of the small Intestines, and in several places form Arches, which are situated at the sides of the Arteries. The Cceliac Ganglia send down, along the Aorta, a Vagina similar to that surrounding the Superior Mesen- teric Artery, which is joined by other Nerves from the Trunk of the Sympathetic continued along the Lumbar Vertebrae. From the Aortic Vagina or Plexus, a Process is sent off, termed Inferior Mesenteric Plexus, which sur- rounds the Trunk of the Inferior Mesenteric Artery, and follows it to the Left Portion of the Colon, and to the Rectum ;—the Nervous Filaments forming Arches in several places, as in the Superior Mesenteric Plexus. The Aortic Plexus, receiving fresh supplies from the Trunks of the Sympathetics, sends down a Plexus, com- monly termed Hypogastric, which passes over the end of the Aorta, and, upon the last Lumbar Vertebra, splits into right and left Portions, which descend to the Vis- cera contained in the Pelvis.

158 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part VII. They DISTRIBUTION OF THE NERVES. The Nervf.s are distinguished into two Classes; one arising from the Brain, termed Cerebral, the other from the Spinal Marrow, termed Spinal Nerves. The Cerebral Nerves are generally reckoned Nine or Ten Pairs, besides a particular Pair, which has the name of Sympathetic. They pass through the Holes in the Base of the Cra- nium, and receive their respective names according to their Order; or from their Functions; or from the Parts on which they are dispersed, &c. The Spinal Nerves consist of Twenty-nine or Thirty Pairs, which pass out between the different Vertebrae, besides a Pair called Accessory, which enter the Cranium from the top of the Spinal Marrow, and afterwards pass out with one of the Cerebral Nerves. Nerves which pass through the Base of the Cranium. The First Pair, or Olfactory Nerves, arise, on each side of the Brain, by three separate Striae, from the Corpora Striata, at the under and back part of the Anterior Lobes, near where the Carotid Arteries enter the Fissures of Sylvius. They are more tender than the other Nerves, and al>o dilfer from them in not being composed of Fasci- culi.

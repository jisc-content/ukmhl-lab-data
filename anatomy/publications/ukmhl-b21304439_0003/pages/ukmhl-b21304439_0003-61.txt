The Scapulaius Interna, vel Subscapularis, vel Scapularis Communis, which arises at the under edge of the Subscapularis Muscle, and soon divides into the proper Scapularis Interna, and the Dorsalis Scapulae In- ferior : The Scapularis Interna runs near the inferior edge of the Scapula, and sends off many large Branches, the principal part of which are dispersed upon the Latissi- mus Dorsi, Teres Major, and Subscapularis. It sends Branches also to the Muscles arising from the Coracoid Process, to the Capsular Ligament, and to the Axil- lary Glands, which have large Anastomoses with each other, and with the Superior Dorsal Artery of the Sca- pula. The Dorsalis Scapulae Inferior, immediately after leaving the Internal Scapulary Artery, turns round near the Cervix of the Scapula, between the Inferior Costa of the Bone and Teres Major, to the Fossa In- fra-Spinata. Upon the Posterior Surface of the Scapula, it spreads out into Branches of considerable size, which are dis- persed upon the Muscles covering the under and back part of the Bone, and extend also to the Capsular Li- gament ; while the Trunk, ascending, inosculates with that of the Superior Dorsal Artery of the Scapula, Vol. III.

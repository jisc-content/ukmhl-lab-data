40 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part V. the opposite sides of the Eye, and pass, either sepa- rately, or united with other small Veins in the Orbit, into the Trunk of the Ocular Vein. The other Venous Branches within the Orbit, corre- spond in a great measure with their respective Arteries. They consist of— jBranches from the Palpcbrae and inner Corner of the Eye: The Lacrymal Branch: The Ethmoidal Branches: Muscular Branches,—and Branches from the Fat in the Orbit, and from the Membranes lining it. The different Branches from the Eye and its Appen- dages form, by their union, the Ocular Vein, which greatly exceeds the size of the corresponding Artery. The Ocidar Vein forms large Anastomoses with the Facial Vein, at the inner Corner of the Eye, and after- wards passes back at the inner side of the Orbit. From the inner, it goes across to the outer side of the Orbit, under the Attollens ; and, after running back through the Superior Orbitar Fissure, covered by the Third and Sixth Pair of Nerves, it terminates in the Cavernous Sinus. Veins or tiie Dura Mater corresponding with its Arteries. The Veins of the Ehira Mater accompany their Ar- teries, and go partly through Perforations in the Base of the Cranium, to terminate in Branches of the Ex- ternal

i*8 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Paut-VII. From thence it proceeds among the Muscles of the Radial side of the Fore Arm, as far as the Hand. While passing behind the Os Humeri, it gives several Branches of considerable size to the different Heads of the Triceps; some of them accompanying the Branches of the Arteria Spiralis, and terminating on the Heads of the Extensors of the Hand. Immediately behind the Body of the Os Humeri, it transmits a Subcutaneous Branch, which is distributed upon the Muscles and Integuments on the posterior part of the Fore Arm, anastomosing at last with the Nerves on the back part of the Hand. The Trunk of the Nerve, having arrived at the Elbow, is lodged in a Fissure between the Brachialis Internus and Radial Extensors of the Carpus, and there gives off other Brandies to the Extensors and to the Supinators of the Hand. At the Head of the Radius, the Trunk of the Nerve divides into two nearly equal Branches,â€”the Superficialis and Profundus. The Superficialis, continued almost straight from the Trunk, immediately transmits a Branch to the Exten- sores Radiales and Supinator Longus, and then de- scends at the inner edge of this Muscle along with the Radial Artery. A little below the middle of the Radius, it crosses between the Tendons of the (Supinator and Extensores Radiales, and is divided into a Volar and Dorsal Branch. The Volar Branch, after sending Tv.igs to the Annu- lar

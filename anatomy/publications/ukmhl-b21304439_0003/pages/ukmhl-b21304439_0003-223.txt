t>Aftf VII.] OF THE NERVES. 211 nary Artery, along with which it is dispersed upon the corresponding side of the Heart. The Great Cardiac Plexus, after sending a Filament or two to the Lungs, gives off Nerves which unite and form the Trunk of the Great Deep Cardiac Nerve of the left side* which has a soft Gangliform appearance, and passes along the corresponding side of the Pulmo- nary Artery. Upon the Surface of this Artery, the Trunk soon di- vides into Branches, which, after sending Filaments across it to the Right Coronary Plexus, give origin to the Coronary Plexus of the left side, which attends the Trunk and Branches of the Left Coronary Artery. In the Left or Posterior Coronary Plexus, the Nerves are larger than in the Right, corresponding with the parts they have to supply; and the Plexuses have re- peated connections with each other on the Surface of the Heart. In general, the Nerves run close to the Arteries; some of them being continued as far as the Apex, while others penetrate the Substance of the Heart. The Great Sympathetic, having produced the prin- cipal Cardiac Nerves, consists of an anterior and a pos- terior part,â€”the former going over, and the latter un- der the Subclavian Artery. Behind this Artery, the two parts unite into a Trunk, which descends in the Thorax over the Heads of the Ribs. At the head of each Rib, it forms a small Ganglion of an irregular shape, which unites behind with each of O 2 the

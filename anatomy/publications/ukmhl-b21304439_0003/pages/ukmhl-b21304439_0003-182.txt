l'O COMPENDIUM OK ANATOMY. [Part VII. Jongs to tlie Coclilea, the other to the Vestible and Se- micircular Canals. Each of these Fasciculi passes by numberless Fibrillaj through the Cribriform Plate in the bottom of the Mea- tus Auditorius Internus, to the inner parts of the La- byrinth. The Fibrillm destined for the Cochlea go through the Holes in the sides of the Modiolus. Some pass between the Plates which form the Septa of the Gyri; others go through Holes between the Os- seous Plates of the Lamina Spiralis ; but by much the greatest number perforate the sides of the Modiolus, between the Septum of the Gyri and the Lamina Spi- ralis. The larger Fibrilloe run upon the Membrane covering the Lamina Spiralis ; while the smaller go from the Modiolus, between the Osseous Septa, and on the inner sides of the Gyri, to be dispersed upon the Membrane lining them. The remaining Fibrilloe perforate the Plate common to the Modiolus and Infundibulum, and vanish upon the last half-turn of the Lamina Spiralis and the Cupola Â©f the Cochlea. Upon the Osseous part of the Lamina Spiralis, the Nerves have the common appearance; but upon the Membranous Portion, they are of the colour of the Re- tina of the Eye. In the whole of their course upon the Lamina Spi- ralis, they form a real Retina; though the reticulated structure becomes much less apparent upon the outer pert of this Lamina, and upon the continuation of the Membrane

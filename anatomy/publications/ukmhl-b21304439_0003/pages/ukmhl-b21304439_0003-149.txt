137 Fart VI.] OF THE ABSORBENTS. The principal part of the Lymphatics upon the con- vex Surface of the Liver, go by a Right and Left Plexus towards the Suspensory Ligament. Running along this Ligament, they directly perforate the Diaphragm, after which they pass through Giands situated upon the anterior part of the Pericardium. Other Lymphatics from the convex part of the Liver run towards the Lateral Ligaments, where they form on each side one or more Trunks of considerable size. From the Lateral Ligaments they pass through the Substance of the Diaphragm, and afterwards run for- wards on its convex Surface, following the direction of the Ribs.—Not unfrequently these Vessels, instead of perforating the Diaphragm, run downwards, and ter- minate in the Thoracic Duct, within the Abdomen. In their course upon the Diaphragm, they often send Branches backwards, which terminate in Glands upon the Esophagus.—In other instances, these Branches are observed to go directly into the Thoracic Duct. They receive Branches from the Substance of the Diaphragm, and, alter perforating two or three Glands upon its Surface, they join the Trunks from the Liga- jnentum Suspensorium. The Lymphatics from the Lateral Ligaments, joined by those from the Ligamentum Suspensorium, form either a principal Trunk, or a Plexus, which runs up, sometimes between the Layers ol the Anterior Medias- tinum, and, at other times; in company with the Inter- nal Mammary Blood-vessels on each side. When they run in the Anterior Mediastinum, they most l

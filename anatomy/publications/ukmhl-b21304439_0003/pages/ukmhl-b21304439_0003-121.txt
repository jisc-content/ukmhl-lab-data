Part V.] OF THE BLOOD-VESSELS. 109 da, which may be considered as the continuation of the Trunk, sinks between the Metatarsal Bones of the two first Toes, and anastomoses in the Sole with the Pos- terior Tibial Artery. The Anterior Branch runs forwards, under the name of Dor so-Metatar sea, or Dorsalis Pollicis, to be dis- persed upon the Great and Second Toes. Tibialis Postica.—The Tibialis Postica, somewhat larger than the Antica, divides about afinger's-breadth under the origin of the Tibialis Antica, though some- times considerably lower, into the Fibularis, and Tibia- lis Postica strictly so called. The Fibularis, termed also Peronea, which is smaller than either of the Tibial Arteries, runs down at the in- ner side of the Fibula for a considerable way along the Leg, and is situated, first between the Tibialis Posticus and Flexor Longus Pollicis, and is afterwards covered by the last-named Muscle. Its Branches are distributed to the Muscles at the outer part of the Leg in the neighboiu-hood of the Fi- bula,—a small Medullary Branch also penetrating the Substance of that Bone. A little above the inferior Articulation of the Tibia and Fibula, it sends a Branch forwards, termed Fibu- laris, or Peronea Anterior, w hich perforates the Interos- seous Ligament, and is dispersed upon the fore part of the Ankle, where it anastomoses with the External Branch of the Tibialis Antica. The continuation of the Trunk, sometimes termed Fibularis, or Peronea Posterior, descends behind the Malleolus Externus, to the outer and back part of the. Foot,

Part VII.] OF THE NERVES. lar Ligament, is distributed to the Muscles and Integu- ments of the'Thumb. The Dorsal Branch is again subdivided into numerous other Branches, some of which goto the Muscles in the interval of the Metacarpal Bones of the Thumb and Fore Finger, a few Filaments being distributed to the Annular Ligament; while principal Branches run, one along each side of the Fore and Mid Finger, and like- wise along the Radial side of the Ring Finger. The Ramus Profundus, after sending several Branches to the Extensores Radial.es and Supinator Brevis, per- forates the latter, and gets to the back part of the Fore Arm. After quitting the Supinator, it descends under the Extensor Primi Internodii Pollicis and Extensor Digi- torum to the back of the Hand. In this course, it sends Branches to the different Ex- tensors of the Thumb and Fingers, and at length dege- nerates into a slender Brand), which, at the Wrist, ad- heres closely to the Annular Ligament, where it has a Gangliform appearance, and is dispersed, partly upon this Ligament-, and partly on the Membranes and Muscles on the back part of the Metacarpus: The Median or Radial Nerve, which comes from the middle and lower part of the Plexus, is formed by Fasciculi from all the Nerves which enter the Plexus, and is nearly of a similar size with the Spiral Nerve. It descends in the Arm, along the anterior Surface of the Humeral Artery, to which, and to the Deep Veins, it adheres closely by Cellular Substance. In this course, it does not give off any considerable N Branches;

69 Part V.] OF THE BLOOD-VESSELS. The Ef? BLOOD-VESSELS op the CHYLOPOIETIC, and ASSISTANT CHYLOPOIETIC VISCERA. I Arteries. The Arteries of these Viscera consist of the Cceliac, and the Superior and Inferior Mesenteries ; all of which are Azygous, or single Arteries arising from the forepart of the Aorta. Arteria Cceliaca. The Arteria Cceliaca arises from the Aorta, imme" diately after it emerges from between the Crura of the Diaphragm into the Abdomen, or nearly opposite the Eleventh Dorsal Vertebra, and is situated at the upper edge of the Pancreas. The Trunk of the Cceliac Artery is remarkably short, being little more than half an inch in length, be- fore it divides into its Three Principal Branches, called, from their destination, Superior Gastric, Hepatic, and Splenic. The Gastrica Superior, or Coronaria Ventw- cuLr Superior, is the smallest of the Three. It goes upwards, and a little towards the left, to reach the right side of the upper orifice of the Stomach. Here it sends Branches to the Cardia, which encircle it, and, ascending some way upon the Esophagus, com- municate with the Arteriae Esophagete.

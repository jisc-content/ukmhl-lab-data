Part VI.] OF THE ABSORBENTS. 139 the Stomach and those descending from the under part of the Liver; and the whole of them, near the head of the Pancreas, form a considerable Plexus. From this Plexus Branches are sent off, some passing over the Duodenum, and others under it, and all of them going into the Thoracic Duct, near the termination of the Lacteal s. The Lymphatics of the Kidney are seldom seen, ex- cepting when it is enlarged or ulcerated ; in which case they may sometimes be distinctly observed. The Superficial Abso/bents run from its outer to- wards its inner edge, where, meeting with those deep seated, they commonly unite with them, and form a Plexus which accompanies the Renal Blood-vessels, after which they pass through some of the Lumbar Glands, and terminate in large Lymphatics near tho Aorta. The Lymphatics of the Capsid a Renal is, which arc numerous in proportion to its size, terminate in the Re- nal Plexus. All the Absorbents already described, excepting those from the convex Surface of the Liver, terminate in the Thoracic Duct near its beginning. The Thoracic Duct, at its under extremity, is formed by the union of three, or sometimes of more principal Trunks ; the first of which is composed of the Lympha- tics of the right, and the second of those of the left In- ferior Extremity;â€”the third Trunk, or set of Trunks, belongs chiefly to the Lacteals. These large Absorbents unite so as to form the Duct over the third Vertebra of the Loins. Sometimes

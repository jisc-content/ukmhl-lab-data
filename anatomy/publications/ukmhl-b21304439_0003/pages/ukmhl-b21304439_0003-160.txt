HS COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [PaetVL From the Superficial arul Deep Parts of the Head in general, the Lymphatics accompany the External and Internal Jugular Veins and the Carotid Arteries ; re- ceiving at the same time Branches from the Larynx, Pharynx, Muscles, and other parts of the Neck. The principal part of these Lymphatics go along with the Internal Jugular Vein and Carotid Artery, and, in their passage, form a remarkable Plexus, which goes through the numerous Glands seated near the Blood- vessels, composing a chain, from which they are termed Concatenates. The Glandules Concatenates are more numerous than any other set of Glands in the Body, excepting those which belong to the Mesentery. The Cervical Plexus of Lymphatics, having passed through the Glandula? Concatenate, and having re- ceived some Branches from the interior part of the Thorax and Axillary Glands, unite at the bottom of the Neck into a Trunk, and sometimes two; which, in the left side, enter the Thoracic Duct near its termination, and, in the right, go into the Trunk, which forms the General Termination of that side. The Trunk which forms this General Termination is only from a quarter of an inch to half an inch in length, but its size not much less than that of the Thoracic Duct. It is formed by Lymphatics from the right side of the Liver, Diaphragm, Heart, and the Right Lobe of the Lungs, by ihose of the Right Arm, right side of the Head, Neck, and Thyroid Gland; the Lymphatics of the

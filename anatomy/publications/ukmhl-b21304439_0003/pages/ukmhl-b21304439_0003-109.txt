In this course, it does not send off any Branches, ex- cepting sometimes a Twig or two to the Peritoneum, Psoas Muscle, Lymphatic Glands, &c. till it is about to leave the Abdomen, where it gives rise to two prin- cipal Arteries,â€”the Epigastrica, and Circumfexa Ossis Ilii. The Arteria Epigastrica goes off from the inner side of the Femoral Artery, immediately before that Vessel gets under the Ligament of Poupart At its origin, it is a little bent downwards \ and about half an inch from the place where it first comes olf, it crosses obliquely upwards and inwards, at the upper and outer end of the Abdominal Fung, behind the Sper- matic Cord in the Male, and Round Ligament in the Female. It proceeds in this oblique manner, under the inferior part of the Transversus, till it reaches as high as the point of the Pyramidalis, after which it tak^s a perpen- dicular direction along the back part, and near the middle of the llectus Abdominis. Near its origin, it sends Branches to the adjacent parts of the Pubes, one of which, in the Male, fre- quently runs to the Spermatic Cord, and in the Female to the Round Ligament of the Uterus. Under the Umbilicus, it generally divides into two Branches, variable in their size ; one directed towards Voi. III. G the

1.19 Part VII.] OF THE NERVES. Filaments, sent down from the Sixth Pair while in the Cavernous Sinus ; or, according to the opinion of some Authors, the Sympathetic sends off these small Nerves to join the Fifth and Sixth Pairs. Upon the Surface of the Internal Carotid Artery,- while in the Carotic Canal, the Branches of the Fifth and Sixth Nerves and Great Sympathetic making this connection, are pulpy and tender, and form a Plexus which surrounds the Carotid, from which the Trunk of the Sympathetic is most frequently considered as being sent out. After escaping from the Carotic Canal, the Trunk, which is here of small size, is closely connected, for a short space, with the Trunks of the Eighth and Ninth Nerves; and, separating from these, it expands into a large Ganglion, termed Ganglion Cervicale Superius, of a long oval form, and situated opposite to the Second Cervical Vertebra. From this Ganglion, the Nerve comes out very little increased in size, and descends on the Anterior Verte- bral Muscles of the Neck, behind, and to the inner side of, the Eighth Pair of Nerves, with which, and with the Carotid Artery, it is connected by a Sheath of Cellular Substance. At the under part of the Neck, and nearly where the Inferior Laryngeal Artery turns towards the Larynx, the Sympathetic forms another Ganglion, termed bv some Authors Cervicale Medium, and by others Cervicale Iiiferiiis. The Inferior Cervical Ganglion is somewhat similar INI 2 in

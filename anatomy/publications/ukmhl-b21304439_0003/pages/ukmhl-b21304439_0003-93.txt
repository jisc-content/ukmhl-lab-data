Part V.] OF THE BLOOD-VESSELS. 81 F The Vol. III. in different Subjects, which sometimes send Twigs to the Glandula Renalis and Tunica Adiposa of the Kid- ney. The Renal Branches then plunge into the Substance of the Kidney, surround its Pelvis, and afterwards ra- mify chiefly in its Cortical Substance*, forming Arches with each other, but few in number, at the roots of the Papillae. Frequently, instead of one Renal Artery, there arc two from the Aorta to each Kidney, or sometimes the Artery is single in one side of the Body, and double in the other, and in tarer instances three or more have been found. The Vena Renalis, or Emulgens, terminates in the Inferior Cava, and is more superficial than its corre- sponding Artery. It is the largest Vein received by the Cava from its origin to the part where it reaches the Liver. • The Left Renal Vein is longer than the Right, in consequence of the Aorta lying between the left Kidney and the Cava, and is situated first behind, but is after- wards anterior to the corresponding Artery. The Right Vein is short, it covers the Artery, and passes directly into the Cava. Arteriae Capsulares.—The Arterice Capsularcs, or Arteries of the lienal Capsules or Glands, are small but numerous. They are derived from the Renal and Diaphragmatic Arteries; and, in general, the Renal Gland, especially the Left, receives additional Branches from the Trunk of the Aorta.

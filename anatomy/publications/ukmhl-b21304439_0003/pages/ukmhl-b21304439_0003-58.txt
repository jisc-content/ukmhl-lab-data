45 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [PartV, After crossing the first Rib, it goes under the Pecto- ral Muscles to the Axilla, where it obtains the name ot Axillary Artery.—In this course, it Sends off the follow- ing Branches, viz. The Vertebral;—the Internal Mammary; and—the Superior Intercostal Artery.—The first of these has been already described; the two others belong to the inner part of the Thorax. It also gives off— The Thyroidea, vel Gutturalis Inferior, which arises at the outer side of the Vertebral Artety, previous to the passage of the Subclavian under the Scalenus. It ascends obliquely inwards in a winding manner behind the Carotid Artery, gives Branches to the Trachea, which descend in the Thorax, and inosculate with the Bronchial Arteries; also Twigs to the Larynx, Pha- rynx, and Esophagus ; while the most considerable part of the Artery is dispersed upon the Thyroid Gland, in- osculating with the Superior Laryngeal Artery: The Cf.rvicalis Anterior, which frequently comes off from the root of the Inferior Thyroid, and ascends in the Neck, furnishing Superficial Branches to the Muscles which go from the Trunk of the Body to the Neck, and Deep Branches to the Glands, Nerves, &c. lying on the fore and lateral parts of the Cervical Ver- tebrae. The Deep Branches anastomose with the Vertebral and Occipital Arteries ; and some passing through the Intervertebral Holes where the Nerves come out, com- municate with the Spinal Arteries : The Cervicalis Posterior, which arises in common with the Anterior Cervical, or with the Inferior Thyroid. —This

212 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part VII, the Intercostal Nerves, generally by two, and some- times by three short Branches. From several of the Dorsal Ganglia of this Nerve, Filaments are detached obliquely over the Vertebrae to the Coats of the Aorta. From the Sixth, Seventh, and Eighth Dorsal Gan- glia,—and frequently from a Ganglion above or below these,—Branches arise, which descend obliquely upon the sides of the Vertebrae, and unite into a Trunk, termed Nervus Splanchnicus, which perforates the Ap- pendix of the Diaphragm, and goes to the Viscera of the Abdomen ; from which circumstance the Nerve ob- tains its name. Besides the Nervus Splanchnicus, another, termed Splanchnicus Secundarius, or Accessorius, is generally observed, which arises from one or two of the Dorsal Ganglia, below the origins of the Splanchnicus,—near its termination,—or runs separate from it into the Ab- domen. The Intercostal, or Costal, or Dorsal Nerves, after escaping from the Vertebrae, run in the Furrows at the lower edges of the Ribs, in company with the Intercostal Blood-vessels, and proceed to the anterior part of the Thorax, between the two Layers of the In- tercostales. Immediately after getting out from between the Ver- tebrae, each is connected, as already taken notice of, by short Branches to the Sympathetic Nerve. Opposite to this connection, they give principal Branches backwards to the Muscles lying near the Spine, and serving for the erection of the Trunk of the Body. Through

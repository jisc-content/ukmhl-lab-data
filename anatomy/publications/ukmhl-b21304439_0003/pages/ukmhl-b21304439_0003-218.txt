208 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part VIIV divided into several Branches, which are distributed in a radiated form upon the Fleshy sides of that Muscle. Pars Vaga.—The Pars Vaga, upon approaching the Thorax, sends a Filament, and sometimes two, termed Cardiac Nerves, which join the Cardiac Branch of the Great Sympathetic, as already observed. It enters the Thorax between the Subclavian Vein and Artery, and, after giving off the Recurrent Nerve, passes behind the root of the Lungs. Recurrent Nerve.—The Recurrent is reflected up- wards, behind the Subclavian Artefy in the right, and behind the Arch of the Aorta in the left side of the Thorax ;—in consequence of which the left Nerve is the longer of the two. It afterwards ascends in the Neck, adhering to the posterior and lateral parts of the Trachea in its way to the Larynx. It is connected, near its Origin, by one or two Branches of considerable size, with the adjacent Ganglia of the Great Sympathetic Nerve ; and from the oppo- site side of its Root it sends other considerable Branches to join those of the Eighth Pair, in the formation of the Anterior Pulmonary Plexus of Nerves. Near the Subclavian Artery, it is connected by diffe- rent Filaments to the Superficial and Deep Cardiac Branches of the Sympathetic Nerve. In its ascent in the Neck, it transmits Pencils of Fi- laments, which penetrate the Trachea, and are dispersed- upon its Internal Membrane. Behind the Thyroid Gland, it sends off minute Fibres- to the beginning of the Esophagus and bottom of the Pharynx, and small Twigs to the Gland itself. Upon

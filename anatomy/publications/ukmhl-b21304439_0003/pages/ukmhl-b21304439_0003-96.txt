3* COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [PartV. of the Ligamentum Latum, to be dispersed first upoH the Ovarium and Uterine Tube, and then upon the Fundus of the Uterus itself,—passing in at its corner, and communicating with the Artery of the opposite side. The Spermatic Vein has the same termination in the Female as in the Male,—but is considerably larger. Arteri.’e li.iACiE.—The Iliac Arteries consist of the Two common Jliacs, which are formed by the divi- sion of the Aorta j and of the External and Internal lliacs of each side, which are formed by the Bifurcation of the Iiiacoe Communes. The External Iliac passes out of the Abdomen be- hind the Ligament of Poupart ; the Internal, termed also Artcria Hypogastrica, descends obliquely into the Pelvis. At the side of the Pelvis, the Internal divides into many Branches, some of which belong to the Organs of Urine and Generation, the rest to other parts of the Pelvis and adjacent parts of the Thigh. The following are the Branches sent from the Hy- pogastric Artery to the Organs of Urine and Genera- tion. Arteria Umbilicalis.— The Arteria Umbilicalis appeurs in the Foetus, as the continued Trunk of the Internal Iliac ; but in the Adult, is shrivelled into a Ligament, excepting at its beginning or under part. The beginning of the Umbilical Artery gives off-— One or more Arteries Vesicates, which run to the un- der part of the Bladder, and extend along its sides as far as the Fundus Vesica?. At their Origin, they fur- nish

Part VIE] OF THE NERVES. 19 J The Middle Cutaneous Nerve, which runs towards the Angle of the Jaw : The Great Posterior Awicidar Nerve, which furnishes an anterior Branch to the under part of the Ear, and a posterior Branch dividing into many others which go to the back part of the Ear and Temple* The Cutaneous and Auricular Nerves are dispersed upon the Platysma Myoidcs, Integuments of the side of the Neck and Head, the Parotid Gland, and External Ear; and have several Communications with the Portio Dura of the Seventh Pair. The remainder of the Second Cervical is distributed t upon the Levator Scapulae, and the Extensors of the Neck and Head. The Third Cervical Nerve, after emerging from between the Vertebrae, sends down a Branch to the Trunk of the Fourth Cervical, and another Branch, which forms the principal root of the Diaphragmatic Nerve. A Third Branch perforates the Muscles on the side of the Vertebrae, and joins the middle Ganglion of the Sympathetic Nerve. A Small Filament connects the Third Cervical with the Descendens of the Ninth Pair. The Nerve is afterwards divided into External and Internal Branches. The External Branches form Anastomoses with the Nervus Accessorius, near the upper part of the Scapula while the Internal, after furnishing Twigs to the Jugu- lar Glands, are dispersed by several large Branches upon Vol. III.

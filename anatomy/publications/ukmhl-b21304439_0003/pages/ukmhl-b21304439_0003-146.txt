134 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part VI. The Mesenteric Glands are seated in the Fat, between the Layers of the Mesentery, near the Branches of the Blood-vessels. They are commonly scattered over the Mesentery, at a little distance from each other; but there are seldom any observed within two or three inches of the Intes- ti les. They are of different sizes in different parts of the Mesentery, some being about half or two-thirds of an inch in diameter, while others are so small as to be traced with difficulty. Their .Structure is the same with that of the Absor- bent Glands in other parts of the Body, but they arc generally flatter, and are of a pale colour. When filled with the Chyle, they are almost as white as the Fluid contained in them. They are considered by some Authors as dividing the Lacteals into different Orders. From the Intestines to the Glands, the Lacteals are called Vasa Laciea Pi imi Generis, and from the Glands to the Thoracic Duct, Vasa Lactea Sccundi Generis. Some divide them into three Orders ;—the first con- sisting of those which go from the Intestines to the Glands,—the second, of those which run from one Set of Glands to another,—and the third, of those which pass from the Glands to the Thoracic Duct. 'Hie Lacteals of the Small Intestines, after passing through the different Glands in the Mesentery, form at last one, and frequently two, three, or more Trunks, which accompany the Trunks oi the Superior Mesente- ric Artery, till they arrive at the right side of the Aorta, where

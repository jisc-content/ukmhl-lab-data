13J Part VI.] OF THE ABSORBENTS. I 3 The which goes through many Glands, and is chiefly situated behind the Aorta and Vena Cava. The Lacteal Vessels, so calied from conveying a Fluid like Milk, which is termed Chyle, begin upon the inner Surface of the Intestines. Each Lacteal takes its ori- gin upon one of the Villi, by numerous short radiated Branches, and each Branch is furnished with an Orifice For imbibing the Chyle. From the Villi, the Laeteals run a considerable way under the Muscular Coat of the Intestines, and then pass obliquely through them, uniting in their course into larger Branches. They follow the direction of the Blood-vessels, and their Trunks are double the number of the Arteries,â€” one being situated on each side of them. Upon the outside of the Intestines an External Set appear. They run between the Peritoneal and Muscu- lar Coats, and commonly proceed some way in the di- rection of the Intestine, and with few Ramifications. The Superficial and deep-seated Laeteals communi- cate in the Substance of the Intestines, and, after leav- ing them, commonly form a Plexus, which runs be- tween the plies of the Mesentery and Meso-colon, with- out following the coarse of the Blood-vessels. The Laeteals of the Jejunum are large and more nu- merous than those of the Ilium; the principal part of the Chyle being contained in this Intestine. In their course, they pass through a great number of Lacteal or Mesenteric Glands, .which, like the Laeteals themselves, are largest and most numerous in that part pf the Mesentery which belongs to the Jejunum.

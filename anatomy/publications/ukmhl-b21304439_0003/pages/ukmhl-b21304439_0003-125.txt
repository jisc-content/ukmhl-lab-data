The Veins of the Inferior Extremity, like those of the Superior, consist of a Subcutaneous and a Deep Set, and, like them also, are furnished with numerous Valves.

They anastomose frequently with each other by large Branches, and have several communications also with the deep-seated Veins. They form two principal Trunks called Saphaena Ma- jor and Saplicena Minor. The Saphena Major begins upon the upper side of the Foot, runs over the fore part of the inner Ankle, and ascends in the Leg at the inner edge of the Tibia.

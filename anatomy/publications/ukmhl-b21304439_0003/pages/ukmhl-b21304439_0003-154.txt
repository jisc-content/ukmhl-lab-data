M2 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [PartVI. After leaving the Bronchial Glands, the Absorbents of the Right Lung form a few principal Trunks, one of which commonly ascends on the fore part of the Vena Cava Superior, and, running in a convoluted manner, opens into the Trunk which terminates in the Veins in the right side of the Neck. The rest of these Trunks go into the Thoracic Duct, near the Bifurcation of the Trachea. The Absorbents of the Heart are small, but numerous, and form principal Trunks which accompany the Coro- nary Aiteries, and, like them, the largest belong to the Left Ventricle. From the side of the Right Coronary Artery, an Ab- sorbent Trunk, which corresponds with it, passes over the Arch of the Aorta to a Gland commonly found be- hind the Origin of the Carotid Arteries. From this Gland it goes afterwards to the general Termination in the right side of the Neck. The Lymphatic Trunk accompanying the Left Coro- nary Artery is formed of two principal Branches.â€”One of these runs in the Groove between the Ventricles on the superior Surface of the Heart: the other runs in a similar Groove on the under side of the Heart, and ha- ving reached the space between the Auricle and Ven- tricle, turns round to join the former Branch near its corresponding Artery. The 'Trunk runs next to a Gland placed behind the Pulmonary Artery, between the Arch of the Aorta and Root of the Trachea, which, with the others here si- tuated, is common to the Absorbents of the Heart and Lungs.

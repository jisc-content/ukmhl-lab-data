204 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part VII. Intf.rcosto-PIumeuales.—Besides the Nerves of the Superior Extremity sent from the Brachial Plexus, there are others belonging to it, which take their origin from the Intercostal Nerves, and which may therefore be termed [ntercosto-Humerales. The Intercosto-Humeral Nerves consist of a Branch from the Second, and of another from the Third Inter- costal Nerves ; both of which pass out at the fore and lateral parts of the Thorax, the one under the Second, and the other under the 1 bird Rib. The First Nerve is joined bj a small Branch with the Cutaneous Nerve, or with the Cutaveus Interims of Wrisberg, and is afterwards dispersed by numerous Filaments upon the Axillary GJands, and upon the In- teguments of the Axilla and of the inner part of the Arm. ’ , The Second Nerve is connected by one or more Branches with the First, and sends some Twigs to the Axillary Glands ; but is chiefly distributed upon the In- teguments of the back part of the Arm, which it sup- plies with many Branches,—some of them extending as far as the Elbow.

9l« COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part V, Anterior Branches. Arteria Obturatoria, or Obturatrix.—The Ob- tiirator Artery has its Origin from the Trunk of the Hypogastric, or from the Ilio-Lumbar, or from the Gluteal or Ischiatic, and frequently from the end of the Iliaca Externa, or from the root of the Epigastrica ; in which last case, it makes a Curve by the inner side of Gimbernat’s Ligament, and is then found on the fore-side of the Gut, in a Crural Hernia. Sometimes one Branch of the Obturator is from the Internal Iliac, another from the Epigastric. It descends in the Pelvis by the under side of the Psoas Muscle, and afterwards passes through the Hole at the upper part of the Obturatcy Ligament. While in the Pelvis, it frequently gives Twigs to the Bladder and other parts near it, and sends a Branch to the Obturator Internus in its passage through the Fora- men Thyroideum. After perforating the Ligament, it divides into Branches, one Set of which are dispersed upon the parts about the Hip-Joint, while another belong to the Obturator Externus, and to the Muscles which arc si- tuated at the upper and inner part of the Thigh ;—the two Sets of Branches inosculating w'ith each other. Ar'i [•eria Umbilicalis.—The Umbilical Artery sends off Rami Vcsicales from its under part or beginnings the rest of it, in the Adult, being shrivelled into Liga- ment, as already observed.

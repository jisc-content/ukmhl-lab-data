20 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [PartV. % * . this Artery, Twigs are also sent to the Sterno-Mas- toideus, Nerves, and Conglobate Glands. The Arteria Occipitalis, which arises from the back part of the External Carotid, and at its Origin is concealed by the other original Branches sent off from that Artery. It runs over the beginning of the Internal Jugular Vein, and afterwards passes between the Atlas and Mas- toid Process, and is covered by the posterior Belly of the Digastricus. It goes likewise behind the upper ends of the Trachelo- Mastoideus, Splenius, and Complexus; after which it becomes more superficial, where it runs near the middle of the Occiput. In its course, it is very tortuous, and gives off different Branches to the surrounding Muscles, viz. Branches to the Digastricus, Stylo-Hyoideus, Sterno- Mastoideus, and Glands of the Neck, and communi- cates with Branches of the Cervical Arteries: Another Branchy which passes, with the Jugular Vein, to the under and back part of the Dura Mater: A small Branch, which is sometimes from the poste- rior Auricular, and is distributed on the Lobe and outer edge of the Ear: The Auricularis Posterior, which comes frequently off from the Trunk of the Carotid.—it sends Branches to the Parotid Gland, Digastricus, and Sterno-Mastoideus, —a Branch to the Meatus Externus and Membrana Tympani,—the Stylo-Mastoid Branchy which passes through the Foramen Stylo-Mastoideum, giving Twigs to the Meatus Externus, Membrana Tympani, and In- ternal Ear.

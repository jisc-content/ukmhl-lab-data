Part V.] OF THE BLOOD. VESSELS. *?a Colon,—its Branches communicating with those of the Ilio-Colica; and— The Colica Media, or Media Anastomotica, which proceeds to the great Arch of the Colon. Near the Colon, the Colica Media divides into two large Branches, one forming an Arch with the Colica Dextra, the other with a Branch of the Mesenterica Inferior. From the opposite side of the Colon, Branches of this Artery run to the Omentum, and communicate with the Gastro-Epiploic Arteries. Besides the Colic Branches already described, there is frequently an additional one, which arises from the beginning of the Superior Mesenteric Artery, and in its ascent splits into two others; one of which, uniting with the Colica Media, forms the large Meso-colic Arch, and the other a similar Arch with the ascending Branch of the Inferior Mesenteric Artery. Mesenterica Inferior. The Mesenterica Inferior, vel Minor, arises from the Anterior and left side of the Aorta, somewhat lower than half-way between the Superior Mesenteric and the Bifurcation of the Aorta. It descends obliquely behind the Peritoneum, upon the left Psoas Muscle, and soon divides into principal Branches. These near the Intestines join with each other, and form Arches, from which others go off, composing Areolae in some measure similar to those which belong

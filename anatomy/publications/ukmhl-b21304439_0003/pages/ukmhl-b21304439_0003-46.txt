34 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Pari V, mg there the Dura Mater, and Tunica Arachnoideay between it and the Bone. From the sides of this Artery, numerous Filaments run transversely, to be dispersed upon the Tuber and adjacent parts. One Branch, larger than the rest, called Auditoria Interna, passes between the two portions of the Seventh Pair of Nerves to the Internal Organ of Plearing. At the extremity of the Cuneiform Process of the Occipital Bone, and at the upper and fore part of the Tuber Annulare, the Basilar Artery divides into four principal Branches, two to each side; and these go off almost at right angles from the Trunk, viz. The Arteria Superior, vel Superior Cerebelli, which turns round the Crura Cerebri, expands its Branches upon the upper part of the Cerebellum, and sinks into its Substance, supplying also the walls of the Fourth Ventricle, the Nates, Testes, and Parts near them: The Arteria Posterior, vel Profunda Cerebri, which sends Twigs to the Tuber and to the Crura Cerebri, and unites with tiie Internal Carotid by the Arteria Communicans. It supplies also parts lying near the Third Ventricle, and afterwards turning round the Crura Cerebri, passes back between the Cerebrum and Cerebellum. It distributes its numerous Branches chiefly to the Posterior Lobe of the Brain, one Branch in particular penetrating into the Posterior Cornu of the Lateral Ventricle, and, with Branches of the Internal Carotid* forming the Arterious part of the Choroid Plexus. The Branches of this Artery anastomose with those . of

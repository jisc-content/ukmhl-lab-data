Part V.] OF THE BLOOD-VESSELS. 39 They run from the Iris backwards along the Choroid Coat, communicate in their passage by minute Branches with the Vorticose Veins, and afterwards perforate the Tunica Sclerotica behind. The Vena Vorticosa are numerous, and obtain their name from the Whirls composed by their Branches; the course of which has been compared to a Jet d'Eau> or to the Spiral Ridges upon the points of the Fingers, &c. Of these Veins, four, or sometimes five, are by much the most conspicuous; the rest being smaller, and ha- ving less of the Vorticose appearance. The Branches of each of the four principal Venae Vorticosae run in a close Congeries, unite at acute angles into larger Branches which have a curved direction, and these proceeding from all sides, meet in a point, and form the Trunk of the Vein. The Trunks of these Venae Vorticosae, thus placed in the centre of their respective Whirls, are situated at the opposite sides of the Eye, and perforate the Sclerotic Coat obliquely near its middle. The rest of the Venae Vorticosae, or smaller Ciliary Veins, communicate with the adjacent larger Vorticose Veins upon the Surface of the Choroid Coat, and also perforate the Sclerotica near its middle. After piercing the Sclerotica, the different Vorticose Veins unite into four or five small Ciliary Trunks, re- ceiving a number of minute Twigs, which paint the Cellular Substance covering the Surface of the Sclero- tica. The Ciliary Veins run in a Serpentine direction at C 4 the

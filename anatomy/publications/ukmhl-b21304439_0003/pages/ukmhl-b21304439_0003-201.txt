V / Paiit VII.] OF THE NERVES. 189 i tal, and in the Loins from the Lumbar Arteries; all of which go through the Intervertebral Holes. It terminates at the under end of the Spinal Marrow; the Cauda Equina being supplied by Branches from the Internal Iliac Artery, which enter through the anterior and posterior Holes of the Os Sacrum. The Posterior Spinal Arteries arise commonly from the Inferior Arteries of the Cerebellum, and frequently from the Trunks of the Vertebral Arteries within the Cranium. They are equal in length to the former Artery, but. considerably inferior to it in size, and continue separate through the whole of their course. They have constantly a serpentine appearance, and form frequent Inosculations with each other, and with Arteries, the Bx-anches of which communicate with the Anterior Spinal Artery. The Arteries of the Spinal Marrow are divided into minute Branches, which are dispersed upon its Sub- stance, upon the Membranes which inclose it, and also upon the Substance of the Vertebrae and Origins of the Nerves. The Veins of the Spinal Marrow accompany their Arteries, and afterwards terminate in the Sinus Venosi of the Spine. The Sinus Venosi consist of one on each side, which runs exterior to the Dura Mater ; being chiefly lodged in the Ligamentous Membrane which lines the fore and lateral parts of the Vertebral Canal. They extend from the Foramen Magnum of the Oc- cipital Bone to the under end of the Os Sacrum, and are

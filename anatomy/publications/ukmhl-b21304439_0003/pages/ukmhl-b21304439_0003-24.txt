12 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [PartV. DISTRIBUTION OF THE BLOOD-VESSELS. Of the Pulsionary Artery and Veins. The Pulmonary Artery, nearly of the same size with the Aorta, arises from the Kight Ventricle of the Heart, and ascends behind the Sternum, and within the Peri- cardium, inclining a little to the left side. Having run as high as the concave side of the Arch of the Aorta, it divides into Right and Left Lateral Branches, which terminate in the corresponding sides of the Lungs. The Right Branch, which is the largest, passes be- hind the Curvature of the Aorta and the Superior Vena Cava, and is of course also the longer of the two. The two Branches are dispersed throughout the Sub- stance of the Lungs, by Ramifications which accompany those of the Bronchi, and, becoming gradually smaller, terminate upon the Pulmonary Cells. From the extreme Branches of the Pulmonary Arte- ry, the Blood is returned by corresponding Veins. The Pulmonary Veins run contiguous to the Arteries, but, unlike the other Veins in general, are nearly of the same size with their Arteries. In their course they unite into larger Branches, which, after leaving the Lungs, form Four Principal Trunks,â€” two

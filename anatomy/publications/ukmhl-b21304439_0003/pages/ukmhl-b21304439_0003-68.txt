56 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [PautV. with these a Plexus of Vessels upon the back part of the Joint. The Interossea is afterwards continued downwards, and is chiefly dispersed upon the Bellies of the Extensor Muscles of the Hand and Fingers, being commonly exhausted before it reaches the Wrist: The Interossea Anterior, which comes olf sometimes immediately below the former, and at other times in common with it. Now and then, both arc from the Radial Artery ; and this is commonly the case where that Artery lakes its origin in the Upper Arm. Some- times the Interosseae arise by a common Trunk from the Humeral Artery. The Anterior Interosseous Artery is considerably larger than the Posterior, but is only about half the size of the Ulnar Artery, from which it springs. It runs close upon the Interosseous Ligament, and furnishes Branches to the Muscles and deep parts upon the anterior side of the Fore Arm, and the Nutritious Arteries of the Radius and Ulna. Near the Wrist, the principal part of the Artery per- forates the Ligament, and goes to the posterior side of the Carpus and back of the Hand, dividing into Branches which inosculate with others of the Posterior Interosseous and Radial Arteries. The other part of the Artery is spent about the Ligaments on the fore side of the Wrist. Sometimes the Interossea terminates in one of the Palmar Arches. The Ulnary Artery, having given off its Recurrent Branch, and the Arterise Interossea?, with many La- teral Branches to the inner side of the Fore Arm, passes

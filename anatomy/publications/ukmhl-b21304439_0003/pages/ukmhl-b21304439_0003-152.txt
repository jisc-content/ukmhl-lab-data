140 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part VI. Sometimes they unite upon the second Vertebra, where the Duct formed by them is twice or thrice as large in diameter as it is higher up. Commonly it enlarges again upon the first Lumbar Vertebra, where it has generally been called the Rc- ceptaculum Chyli, and considered as the beginning of the Duct; being often found forming an oval, or Pyri- form Bag, about the third of an inch in diameter. These large Trunks which form the Thoracic Duct lie close upon the Spine, those of the right side being placed below the Right Crus of the Diaphragm, and those of the left between the Aorta and Spine, while the Thoracic Duct itself lies at first behind the Aorta, but afterwards passes from it upwards and a little to the right side, till it gets before the first Vertebra of the Loins. Here it is situated behind the Right Crus of the Dia- phragm, a little higher than the Right Renal Artery, from whence it passes upwards, and afterwards appears in the Thorax, upon the fore and right side of the Spine, between the Aorta and Vena Azygos, where it is supposed to be considerably assisted by the strokes of the Aorta in impelling its Fluids. In the middle of the Thorax, it is smaller than else- where, being only about a line in diameter. After this it gradually enlarges, and, near its termination, is about an eighth or tenth of an inch over. In the Thorax, it receives the Lymphatics of the Spa- tia Intercostalia, one or two of which accompany each of the Intercostal Arteries, and the whole go through small Glands placed near these Arteries, but most nu- merous

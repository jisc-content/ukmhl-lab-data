Fart V.] OF THE BLOOD-VESSELS. 7 The strength of the Arteries depends upon the thick- ness of their Coats, which is found to vary in different Arteries.—In the Aorta, the Coats are thick and strong; —in the Arteries of the Brain and Spleen, they are thin and tender ;—but the thickness and consequent strength are proportionally greater in the small Branches than in the large Trunks. The Arteries run more or less in a waving direction, which breaks the force of the Blood in them, and pre- vents them from being strained by the motions of the parts to which they belong. The Flexions are most frequent in Arteries belonging to parts, the size and situation of which are changeable. The Windings of many of the Arteries are in pro- portion to the degree in which they are distended ; those which are nearly straight in their natural state, frequently becoming serpentine when their distension is increased, Several of the large Arteries form Communications with each other, termed by Anatomists Anastomoses; but the Anastomoses are more frequent among the small Branches, where they form a Plexus which lessens the danger of Obstruction. The Anastomoses are more frequent in the Skin and Membranous Parts. In the Solid Viscera, the Arteries run in a different manner, being in some crowded to- gether in the form of Trees or Bushes, in others having a Serpentine appearance, and in several forming Peni- villi, according to the disposition of the part. lhe Arteries obtain their particular names from their Situations, Place of Destination, &c. and the term Ca~ A 4 pillary,

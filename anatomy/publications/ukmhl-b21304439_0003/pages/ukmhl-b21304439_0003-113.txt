Part V.] OF THE BLOOD-VESSELS. 101 detached, which enters the Breach at the under and fore part of the Acetabulum, to be dispersed upon the Lijjamenturn Rotundum and the Substance called Gland of the Joint: An Inferior, or Inferior Posterior Circumflex Branch, which is the continuation of the Trunk. It bends round the Neck of the Thigh-bone, sending small Branches to the Capsule of the Joint, to the Ob- turator, Quadratus, and Adductor Femoris; commu- nicating with the Obturator and Sciatic Arteries, Hoe- Tnorrhoidals, and small Branches from the Gluteal. Circumflex a Externa.—The Circumflexa Externa arises for the most part nearly opposite the former, but frequently a little lower.—Now and then it has a double Origin ; one of the Trunks coming off higher than the other. It passes outwards between the upper ends of the Rectus, Tensor Vaginae Femoris, and Vastus Externus, and over the root of the Trochanter Major of the Os Femoris. \ It sends Branches upwards to the under part of the Glutei, and to other Muscles placed at the inferior and back part of the Pelvis, which anastomose with those running down from the Arteria Glutea. Others which have more of a lateral direction, and are distributed upon the Muscles at the upper and back part of the Thigh, and upon those more immediately about the Joint,—communicating with the Branches of the Circumflexa Interna. The largest Branches descend between the Rectus Femoris and Vastus Externus; one, longer than the G 3 Test,

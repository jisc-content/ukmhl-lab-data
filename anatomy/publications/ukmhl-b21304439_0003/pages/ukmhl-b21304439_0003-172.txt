[PartVII. less Cineritious Matter entering their composition ; and differ also in the Pia Mater furnishing them with a ge- neral Covering, before it invests the several Fasciculi of which they are formed. At the fore part of the Sella Turcica they unite, and have their Medullary Parts intimately intermixed. From this union, they go obliquely outwards and for- wards through the Foramina Optica into the Orbits ; and advancing in the Orbits in a waving direction, to prevent them from being overstretched in the motions of the Eye, they perforate the Balls, to be expanded into the Retinfe, which have been already described. The Third Pair, or Motores Oculorum, smaller than the Optic Nerves, arise at the under, inner, and back part of the Crura Cerebri, or between the Cor- pora Albicantia and Tuber Annulare, by numerous Threads, which are soon collected into their respective Trunks. They pass outwards, perforate the Dura Mater at the sides of the Posterior Clinoid Process, and, running along the upper part of the Cavernous Sinuses, at the outside of the Carotid Arteries, they get through the Foramina Lacera into the Orbits. Upon entering the Orbits, they divide into several Branches, which supply the greater number of the Muscles of the Eye, in consequence of which the Nerves have obtained their particular name. A Branch runs to each of the Muscles within the Orbits, excepting the Trochlearis and Abductor; and the Nerve likewise assists in forming a small Ganglion, termed

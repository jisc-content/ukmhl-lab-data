lb' COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part V. cases, the Right Subclavian comes off from the left end of the Arch of the Aorta. Carotid Arteries.â€”The Carotid Arteries, after emerging from the Thorax, ascend upon the fore part of the Vertebrae, on eacli side of the Neck, between the Trachea and Internal Jugular Veins, and behind the Sterno-Mastoidei, gradually receding from each other, and getting upon the fore part of the Longug Colli, and Rectus Capitis Interims Major, on each side. In the Neck, they do not send off any Branches till they reach the top of the Larynx, where each, opposite to the Os Hyoides, though in some rare instances much lower, divides into External and Internal Carotid Arte- ries, the former supplying the upper part of the Neck, and the outei parts of the Head, the latter the Brain. The External Carotid, sometimes termed Facial Carotid, is placed more anteriorly, and nearer the La- rynx, than the Internal, which lies deeper, and is, at its root, the larger of the two. The External, though smaller than the other, appears as a continuation of the common Trunk. It runs up behind the Angle of the Lower Jaw, un- der the Digastricus and Slylo-EIyoideus, towards the Temple, and in its passage before the Ear, is sunk deep in the Substance of the Parotid Gland, which it supplies in its course, and is divided into the following principal Branches, viz. The Arteria Laryngea Superior, Gutturalis Superior, vel Thyroidea Superior, which comes off from the Root of the External Carotid, and sometimes from the top of the Common Carotid. It passes downwards and forwards in a Winding di- rection,

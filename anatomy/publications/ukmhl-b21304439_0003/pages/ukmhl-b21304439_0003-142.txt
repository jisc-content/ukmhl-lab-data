130 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part VI The upper and inner Inguinal Glands ; those deeper seated passing with the Lymphatics of the Testicle into the Abdomen. The Superficial Lymphatics of the Penis begin at the Prepuce, and form a few Trunks which run principally upon the Dorsum Penis, receiving in their passage Branches which turn round from its Inferior Surface. In some Subjects, they unite into Trunks in the middle of the Dorsum Penis, which afterwards separate into right and left parts. In others, they are more unconnected j and in all, they appear to divide at the root of the Penis into right and left Branches, passing into the corresponding In- guinal Glands, which lie next the Symphysis Pubis. The Deep-seated Lymphatics of the Penis arise from the Gians, and from the body of the Penis, and accomr pany the Arteries into the under part of the Pelvis. The Lymphatics of the Testicle are numerous, and are among the largest of the whole Body j some of them exceeding the size of a Crow-quill. They arise from the Coats and Substance of the Tes- ticle, and from the Epididymis, and run with the Sper- matic Cord through the lting of the Abdominal Muscle, to terminate in the Lumbar Glands.—In their passage, they have few Communications with each other. The Lymphatics of the External Parts of Generation in Women, go partly to the Inguinal Glands of each side, and partly through the Bings of the External Oblique Muscles, in company with the Bound Ligaments oi’ the Uterus, and terminate in the Iliac and in the Lumbar Glands.

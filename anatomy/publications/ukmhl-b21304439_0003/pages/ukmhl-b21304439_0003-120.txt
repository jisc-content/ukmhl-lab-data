108 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [PatitV. the former, and is distributed to the parts near the outer Ankle: The Arteria Tarsea, which takes its origin a little be- fore the bending of the Ankle-joint, and is more con- siderable in size than the Malleolar Branches. It passes obliquely outwards and forwards under the Extensor Brevis Digitorum, and sends Branches to the Joint of the Ankle, where it communicates with the Malleolar Arteries. It supplies the greater part of the Muscles, Integu- ments, &c. on the upper and outer part of the Foot, and sends Branches, termed fiiterossece, to the Muscles between the Metatarsal Bones of the small Toes,â€” which, however, are frequently derived from the Meta- tarsal Artery: Branches from the Artery upon the Dorsum Pedis, distributed to the Integuments, Muscles, Membranes, and Bones, at the upper and inner side of the Foot: The Arteria Metatarsea, which goes off about the middle of the Dorsum Pedis, and passes obliquely to- wards the root of the Little Toe, assisting the former Artery in furnishing Branches to the upper side of the Foot and Toes, and sometimes, in part or entirely, sup- plying the place of that Artery. The remaining portion of the Anterior Tibial Ar- tery afterwards advances between the Extensor of the great, and long Extensor of the small Toes, sending Twigs to the adjacent parts, and dividing, between the Metatarsal Bones of the Great Toe, and that next it, into a Large Posterior, and a Small Anterior Branch. The Posterior Branchy termed Anastomotica Profun- da9

19-! Part VIL] OF THE NERVES. Spinal Marrow, by an anterior and posterior Fascicu- lus, like the rest of the Spinal Nerves ; and, like these also, they have their Ganglia where they pass out be- tween the Bones. They perforate the Dura Mater immediately under the entrance of the Vertebral Arteries, and go forwards under them, and over the Transverse Processes of the Atlas. They afterwards appear in the fore part of the Neck, and are each connected above by an Arch to the root of the Ninth Pair, and below by a similar Arch to the first Cervical Nerve. Anteriorly, each is joined by one or two short Branches to the upper Ganglion of the Great Sympa- thetic Nerve. They afterwards divide into Branches, which are dis- tributed upon the Recti et Obliqui Capitis, and upon some of the deep Extensors of the Head. The First Cervical Nerve comes out, on each side, between the Atlas and Vertebra Dentata, and imme- diately splits into two parts ; the first of which passes forwards under the Transverse Process of the Atlas, and is joined by an Arch with the Nervus Accessorius, and by Branches with the Ninth Pair : It is also connected by a soft Gangliform Pellucid Root with the upper Gan- glion of the Sympathetic Nerve, sending a Branch, downwards, to be fixed to the second Cervical Nerve, and also small Branches to the Muscles connected with the fore part of the Vertebrae. 1 he other, which is the principal part, goes back- wards, and, after sending Branches to the Extensors of the

180 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part VII, in shape and size to the Superior ; though it varies con- siderably in these respects in different Subjects. From this Ganglion principal Branches are sentdown, one of which, larger than the rest, and considered as the continuation of the Trunk, turns outwards between the Inferior Laryngeal and V ertebral Arteries to an- other Ganglion. This third Ganglion is placed at the head of the First Bib, and is termed by some Authors Ganglion Cervicale Inferius, vel Imum, while others consider it as the first of the Thoracic Ganglia. The Cervical part of the Great Sympathetic is con- nected with other Nerves, and dispersed upon different parts, by the following Branches, viz. One or two short but thick Branches, which connect the beginning of the Superior Ganglion with the root of the Sub-occipital Nerve: One or two Pulpy Nerves, which run forwards be- hind the Internal Carotid Artery, and divide into many others. These, together with the Filaments from the Glosso-Pharyngeus, form a Plexus which sends Branches to the Gangliform Expansion of the Pharyngcus, and afterwards embraces the External Carotid Artery, send- ing Plexuses of Filaments along its different Branches : One or two other soft Nerves, going behind the In- ternal Carotid, and with a Branch of the Laryngeus interims of the Eighth Pair, forming the Laryngeus Internus: Thick shori Roots connecting the First, or Conjuga- tion of the First and Second Ccrvicals, with the Supe- rior Ganglion of the Sympathetic Nerve.

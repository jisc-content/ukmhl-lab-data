Fart V.] OF THE BLOOD-VESSELS. The Superficial Branch bends round between the Ori- gin of the Gluteus Maximus and Mcdius, giving many Branches to each, but chiefly to the former, and inos- culating, by means of the Posterior Sacral Holes, with the Sacral Arteries. The Deep Branch, situated under the middle of the Gluteus Medius, is subdivided into Two Principal Branches,—a Superior and Inferior. The Superior crosses the Origin of the Gluteus Mi- nor, extends as far as the Spine of the Ilium, and gives Branches to the Gluteus Medius, and others passing downwards between the Gluteus Minimus and Ilium to the Joint of the Thigh;—one Branch forming a Nutritious Artery of the Ilium. The Inferior or Transverse Branch ascends over the Gluteus Minimus, and gives many large Branches to the Gluteus Medius and Minimus ; some of which ex- tend to the Joint of the Thigh and parts adjacent. At the under edge of the Gluteus Medius, it is di- vided into two Sets of Branches, one of which runs in a radiated direction close upon the Bone, and is chiefly dispersed upon the two smaller Glutei, while Branches of inferior size run, some of them downwards to the Muscles and Ligaments about the Joint of the Thigh, and others backwards to the parts about the Sacrum, communicating with the Lateral Sacral Arteries through the Posterior Foramina of the Os Sacrum. The other Set of Branches of the Gluteal Artery creep in between the Gluteus Medius and Maximus, upon the latter of which they are chiefly dispersed. Anterior

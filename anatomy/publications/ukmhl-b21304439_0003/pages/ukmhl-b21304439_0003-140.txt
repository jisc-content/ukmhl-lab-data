128 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part VI. From the Sole another Plexus of Lymphatics arises, and joins those upon the Leg already described. From the inside of the Knee a Plexus runs up, con- sisting of from twelve to twenty Trunks, which pass afterwards on the fore and inner part of the Thigh to the Groin. The greater part of the Trunks of the last Plexus ac- company the Vena Saphana Major, and, in their pas- sage, they receive many small Branches from the outer and back part of the Thigh. In the Groin, they split into Branches, which pene- trate the Inguinal Glands. The Inguinal Glands are generally from six or eight to a dozen in number, and are of very different sizes * but sometimes the number is smaller, from two or more of them being united into one large Gland. Of the Inguinal Glands, some lie in the Angle be- tween the Thigh and Abdomen, and others a few inches farther down on the fore part of the Thigh. The greater number are placed upon the outer part of the Tendinous Aponeurosis, the rest deeper, being m contact with the great Blood-vessels. The Superficial Lymphatics of the Thigh enter the lowest of these Glands; one or more of them, however, frequently pass the first Glands they meet with, and penetrate others higher in the Groin ; and sometimes a fewr do not enter any Glands till they go into the Abdo- men. The superficial Lymphatics of the upper and back part of the Thigh, with those of the Nates, Abdo- men, and Loins, also enter into the Inguinal Glands. The Deep-seated Lymphatics of the Lower Extremity, are

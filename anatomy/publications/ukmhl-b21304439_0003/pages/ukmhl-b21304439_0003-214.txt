Â£02 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part VII. Near the under end of the Os Humeri, a Twitr or two commonly go to the inner end of the Triceps. Under the bending of the Elbow, a Branch is given out to be dispersed upon the Belly of the Flexor Ulnaris. Immediately below the former, another Branch is produced, which is distributed upon the Flexor Pro- fundus Digitorum. About the middle of the Fore Arm, a Filament is transmitted, which adheres to the Ulnar Artery, fur- nishing small Twigs to the Coats and Sheath ol the Ar- tery, and terminating in the corresponding parts of the Wrist, and Integuments of the Palm. Near the end of the Ulna, a considerable Branch, termed Dorsalis, is sent out, which, turning between the Flexor Ulnaris and Ulna, is directed to the back part of the Hand. The Dorsal Nerve sends Branches to the Integuments of the Wrist and Metacarpus, which have various A- nastomoses with others of the Spiral Nerve. It sends off a Branch, which proceeds along the Ul- nar side of the Little Finger; and at the Heads of the Metacarpal Bones, another splitting into two Branches, which run along the adjacent sides of the Auricular and Ring Fingers. The Trunk of the Nerve passes with the correspond- ing Artery over the Annular Ligament into the Palm, where, like the Radial Nerve, it is covered with the Aponeurosis Palmaris. In the Palm, it divides into Superficial and Deep Branches ; the former destined chiefly for the Fingers, the latter for the Deep Region of the Hand. r of V The

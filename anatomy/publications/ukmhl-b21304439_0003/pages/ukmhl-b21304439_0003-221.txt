Part VII.] OF THE NERVES. 20$ the latter of which is termed by Scarpa Cardiacus Aor- ta Superficialis. The Cardiacus Magnus Profundus is principally formed by Branches from the Second Cervical Ganglion of the Sympathetic, and afterwards receives one or two Filaments from the Cardiacus Supremus, together with the Superficial Cardiac and other Branches of the Eighth Pair, as formerly described. The Trunk, arising in this manner from different sources, passes between the Superior Cava and ascend- ing Aorta, to the posterior Surface of the latter, and joins the Cardiac Branches of the left side. By the addition of the Left Cardiac Nerves, a Plexus is formed, termed Plexus Cardiacus Magnus of Haller, from which is sent out a long Ganglion of a soft con- sistence, described by Wrisberg under the name of Ganglion Cardiacum. * From the Cardiac Ganglion, the following Branches tire given off, viz. A Branch which, after transmitting Filaments to the Anterior Pulmonary Plexus of the Eighth Pair, passes behind the Right Division of the Pulmonary Artery to the Left Coronary Plexus of the Heart: One or two Filaments, which unite with others sent from the Anterior Pulmonary Plexus of the Eighth Pair, and go before the Right Branch of the Pulmo- nary Artery to the Base of the Heart: Branches of considerable size, passing partly over the right side of the Aorta, and partly between it and the Pulmonary Artery, to the Anterior Coronary Plexus: 7 Vol. III.

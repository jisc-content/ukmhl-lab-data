pAlrr VII.j OF THE NERVES, Blood-vessels of that name to the Pectoralis and Integu- ments. The Plexus afterwards divides into Nerves, most of which are of great size, to supply the Superior Extre- mity.â€”They are as follow : The Scapularis, which commonly arises from the combination of the Fourth and Fifth Pairs, and, ex- tending outwards, runs through the Semilunar Arch in the upper edge of the Scapula, afterwards descending between the Root of the Spine and Head of that Bone. It furnishes Branches to the Supra-Spinatus, and is ultimately spent upon the Infra-Spinatus: The Auticularis, which arises, like the former Nerve, from the Trunk common to the Fourth and Fifth Cervicals. It sinks deep in the Axilla, and getting between the under edge of the Subscapularis, and insertions of the Teres Major and Latissimus Dorsi, it follows the course of the Posterior Circumflex Artery, round the Body of the Os Humeri, immediately below the Articulation. It sends Branches to the Teres Minor, and some Twigs to the Ligament of the Joint; but is chiefly dis- persed upon the Deltoides : The Nervus Cutaneus, which arises from the Trunk common to the last Cervical and first Dorsal Nerve; but is principally formed by Fibrillae from the latter. It runs down at the inner and fore part of the Arm, near the Radial Nerve. It sometimes gives a small Branch to the upper part of the Coraco-Brachialis and Biceps $ and, farther N 2 down,

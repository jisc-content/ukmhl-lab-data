Part V.] OF THE BLOOD-VESSELS. 25 out its Ramifications upon the side and upper part of the Fore-head, some of which reach as far as the Orbit. It supplies the Integuments and Muscles near it, com- municates, about the Orbit, with the Facial Artery, and, at the upper part of the Head, with the corresponding Branch of the other side. It occasionally gives a Branch from near its root, termed Ramus Orbicularis, which runs towards the outer Corner of the Eye, to be distributed upon the Orbicu- laris. The Posterior, or External Posteriory or Temporo- Occipital Branch, appears as the continuation of the Trunk. It ascends obliquely backwards, and is distri- buted extensively on the Integuments and Muscles upon the lateral parts and Crown of the Head, communicat- ing with the Anterior Branch, and with the Occipitalis on the same side of the Head, and also with the Poste- rior Temporal Branch of the opposite side,—from which, and from the other Branches on the Head, numerous Twigs go to the Pericranium, and to the Substance of the Bone. X? Internal Carotid Artery. The Internal Carotid,—sometimes termed Arteria Cerebralis,—is arched back at its Origin, and then ascends in a waving direction on the fore part of the Rectus Capitis Anterior Major, as far as the Foramen Caroticum, without giving off any Branches. At the Base of the Cranium, it makes a sudden turn forwards, and enters the Carotic Canal of the Temporal Bone.

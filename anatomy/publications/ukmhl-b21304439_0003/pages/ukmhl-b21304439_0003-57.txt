Arteria Innominata.—The Arteria Innominata, seu Anonyma, named also 1light Subclavian, which is scarcely two inches in length, ascends obliquely over the Trachea, at the right side of which it divides into the Right Proper Subclavian, and the Right Common Ca- rotid. The Left Subclavian arises from the Arch of the Aor- ta, at the outside of the Carotid, and ascends to the up- per part of the Thorax; forming there a sharper or more extensive Curvature than the Subclavian of the right side, and advancing till upon a level with the first Rib, before it gives off’ any Branches. After the two Subclavians have emerged from the Thorax, each passes transversely outwards at the under part oi the Neck, behind the origin of the Sterno-Mas- toideus, and continues its course outwards between the Anterior and Middle Scaleni, and between the Subcla- vian Muscle and first Rib.

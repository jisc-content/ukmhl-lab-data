122* COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part VI, In the different parts of the Body, they generally run in two sets i one Superficial and very numerous, the other accompanying the Arteries, and at least double their number. The Lacteals are of the same nature with the other Absorbents. They begin from the inside of the intes- tines ; and when these contain Alimentary Matter, they carry a white I'iuid, called Chyle, and at other times a Clear Fluid or Lymph, to be mixed with the contents of the Lymphatics. Most of the Lymphatics, and all the Lacteals, termi- nate in the Thoracic Duct, by which the Lymph and Chyle are conveyed to the Red Veins, and mixed with the Blood. The large Veins in the bottom of the Neele are the common place of termination ; no facts or observations having been yet established of their terminating in any other part of the Venous System. The Coats of the Absorbents are thinner and more transparent, but stronger than those of the Red Veins, being able to support a column of Mercury of consider- able weight;—but, from their thinness, they cannot be enumerated. The Absorbents, however, like the Blood-vessels, are generally supposed to be formed of different Membra- nous Layers.—Fibres can be seen in them, and their Muscularity is rendered probable by the Contractile power which they are observed to possess in a living or moribund Animal. By this contractility, together with a degree of elas- ticity they possess, they convey their contents from their Origins

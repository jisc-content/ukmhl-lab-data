172 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Paiit VII. the different Ampullae, are spread out upon them, as in the Cochlea, in the form of a Net-work •, the Fibres of which, by degrees becoming pellucid, disappear upon the beginning of the Membranaceous Canals. Portio Duha.—The Portio Dura, or Facial Nerve, separates from the Portio Mollis at the bottom of the Meatus Auditorius Interims, and, by the anterior Hole in ihe upper Fossulaat the bottom of the Meatus, enters die Aquceduclus FallopiI. After getting into the Canal, it receives the retrograde Nerve from the Second Branch of the Fifth Pair, which enters by the Foramen Innominatum on the fore-side of the Pars Petrosa. It sends Twigs through Foramina in the sides of the Aqueduct to the Mastoid Cells and to the Stapedius. A little before its exit from the Aqueduct in the Adult, but at the outer end of it in the Foetus, it gives off a re- flected Branch, termed Chorda Tympani, which passes between the long Processes of the Malleus and Incus, and over the Membrana Tympani. The Chorda Tympani goes afterwards in a Fissure at die outside of the Eustachian Tube, and soon after that Nerve has got out of the Cranium, joins the Lingual Branch of the Fifth Pair. In its passage, it supplies the Muscles of the Malleus, and the Membranes, &c. of the Tympanum. The Portio Dura afterwards passes out of the Aque- duct by the Foramen Stylo-Mastoideum, and is at first lodged deep, being situated in a Hollow behind the Pa- rotid Gland. Here it gives a small Occipital Branch, which sends Twigs

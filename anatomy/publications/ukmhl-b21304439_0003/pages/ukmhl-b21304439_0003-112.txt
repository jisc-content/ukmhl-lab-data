100 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part V. Profunda Femoris. The Arteria Profunda, also called Vasta Poste- rior, or Muscularis Femoris, concealed at first by the proper Femoral Trunk, gives off* at its Origin from that Artery small Branches, arising separately or in a common Trunk, and dispersed upon the Integuments, Muscles, and Capsular Ligament, at the upper and fore part of the Thigh. It gives next, from its Origin also, two large Branches, —the Circwvjlexa Interna, and Circnmjlexa Externa,— which run in opposite directions at the upper part of the Thigh. The Circumflexa Interna, though most frequent- ly coming off from the beginning of the Profunda, often arises higher than it, from the common Femoral; and there are now and then two of them, one a little lower than the other, or sometimes it comes off in com- mon with the Circumflexa Externa. It passes between the under end of the Psoas and the Pectinalis, and afterwards turns round the inner part of the Neck of the Thigh-bone. It sends off— Branches to the Pectinalis, Triceps, and Capsule of the Joint: A Superior or Anterior Ascending Branch, to the Tri- ceps and Obturator, having a considerable Anastomosis with the Obturator Al ter}’ at the external margin of the Foramen Thyroideum. From this Branch a Twig is detached.

After furnishing the Branches already mentioned, the Inferior Gastric Artery passes under the Pylorus to the great Curvature of the Stomach, along which it runs ; being included, to near its large extremity, in the Layers of the Anterior Portion of the Omentum. In this course it sends off— The Rami Epiploici, which are long and slender Branches dispersed upon the Epiploon or Omentum: The Rami Gastrici, which, plunging suddenly into both sides of the Stomach, communicate with the Py- loric and Superior Gastric Arteries. The Hepatic Artery, having given out the Inferior Gastric, and frequently the Pyloric Artery, soon divides into two principal Branches, a right and a left, of un- equal size, which run into the Porta;—the one,—under the Hepatic Duct,—to supply the great,—and the other the small Lobe of the Liver. From the Right Branch, before it plunges into the Liver, is sent off the Arteria Cystica, afterwards divid- ing into two smaller Branches, termed Gemellcey which are dispersed upon the Gall-bladder. Frequently, besides the Hepatic Artery sent off from the Cceliac, there is another, coming sometimes from the Superior Gastric, at other times from the Superior Mesenteric Artery, or from the Aorta, to be sent into the Liver. In such cases, the Trunk which gives origin to this additional Artery is greater than usual, and the. Hepatic Branch which this Artery accompanies is pro- portionally smaller.

Part VII.] OF THE NERVES. 161 termed Ophthalmic, from which Twigs are sent off to supply the Ball of the Eye. The Fourth Pair, or Pathetic, have their origin the highest of the Cerebral Nerves, and are the most slender of the Body* being generally formed of one Fasciculus only on each side. They arise by a single, and sometimes by a double root, behind the Testes, from the Medullary Expan- sion which lies over the passage to the Fourth Ventricle, and which unites the Processus ad Testes to each other. They afterwards turn round the Crura Cerebri, and, some way behind the entrance of the Third Pair, perforate the Dura Mater at the edges of the Tento- rium. They run afterwards along the Cavernous Sinuses, at the outer side of the Third Pair, then cross over that Pair, and passing out of the Cranium through the Fo- ramina Lacera, they go obliquely over the Muscles at the upper part of the Orbits, to be entirely dispersed upon the Patheticus or Trochlearis on each side. The Fifth Pair, or Trifacial, or Par Trigemi- num, which are the largest Nerves of the Brain, arise, each by an anterior small and a posterior large Portion, from the side of the Tuber Annulare, where the Crura Cerebelli join it. They enter the Dura Mater a little below the Tento- rium, over the points of the Partes Petrosas of the Temporal Bones, and form a Plexus on each side, in which upwards of fifty Fasciculi have frequently been enumerated. The Plexus sinks close by the outside of the Caver- Vol. III. Jm nous

207 Part VII.] OF THE NERVES. Upon the inner side of the Thyroid Cartilage, it furnishes a Branch which constitutes a remarkable Anastomosis with another from the Internal Laryngeal Nerve. At the back part of the Larynx, it is divided into many Fibrilke, which are distributed to the different. Muscles fixed to the Arytenoid Cartilage of the corre- sponding side. It has also some connections, smaller than the one already mentioned, with Branches of the Internal La- ryngeal Nerve, and sends minute Fibrillae to the Inter- nal Membrane of the Larynx; from which circum- stance, the Recurrent Nerves are considered as the principal Instruments of the Organ of Voice. The Pars Vaga, having transmitted the Recurrent Nerve, gives off Filaments which form connections with Branches arising from the Root of the Recurrent of the same and of the opposite side. They anastomose also by small Fibrillae with the Car- diac Branch of the Sympathetic, and then pass to the fore part of the Bronchi, where they constitute what is termed the Anterior Pulmonary Plexus of Nerves. The Anterior Pulmonary Plexus, thus formed by Branches from the Trunk of the Eighth Pair, with the assistance of others from the Recurrent and Sympathe- tic Nerves, extends across the Great Branches of the Pulmonary Artery, and, after transmitting small Fila- ments to the Pericardium and to the Great Cardiac Nerve, furnishes many minute Fibrillae, which accom- pany the Ramifications of the Bronchi and Pulmonary Blood-vessels in the Substance of the Lungs.

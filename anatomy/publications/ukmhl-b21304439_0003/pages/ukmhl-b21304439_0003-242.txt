230 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part VIE I lie longest Branch of the Nerve accompanies the Anterior Tibial Artery, and divides upon the Foot into Branches, which have some connections with each other, and supply the Extensor Digitorum Brevis.â€”Some Fi- laments continued from these Branches run to the In- terossci, while others of more considerable size go to some of the innermost Toes ; one Twig sinking with a Branch of the Anterior Tibial Artery to the Deep Muscles of tbe Sole. The Tibial Nerve passes between the Heads of the Gastrocnemius, and, perforating the origin of the So- leus, descends between it and the Flexor Digitorum Longus, upon the Posterior Tibial Artery, to the under part of the Leg; in which course, it sends off the foL lowing Nerves, viz. The Comviunicans Tibia?, which accompanies the Vena Sapliama Minor in the back part of the Leg, and to the outer part of the Foot. Behind the Belly of the Gastrocnemius, the Comrnu- nicans sends a^Branch to be consumed in the I at; and a little lowpr, it anastomoses with the communicating Branch of the Fibular Nerve. The under part of this Nerve is dispersed upon the Integuments of the outer Ankle and adjacent side of the Foot, some Branches passing as far as the Dorsal side of two or three of the smaller Toes: Branches to both Pleads of the Gastrocnemius, to the Plantaris, and to the Soleus. Near the middle of the Leg, it sends Branches to the Tibialis Posticus, to the Flexor Digitorum, and Flexoi* Pollicis. One

Part Vi] OF THE BLOOD-VESSELS. 51 Humeral Artery. The Humeral Autery descends at the inner part of the Arm, behind the inner edge of the Biceps, covered by the General Aponeurosis, and having the Triceps Extensor Cubiti at the back part of it. In this course, it bestows Branches to the Muscles and Integuments, and to the Periosteum and Bone, viz. A Branch under the Coraco-Brachialis to the Capsule of the Joint and parts adjacent to it: Branches to the Triceps and Coraco-Brachialis : Various Branches to the Biceps, Brachialis Internus, and Bone : The Profunda Humeri, vel Spiralis', which arises near the upper part of the Arm, at the insertion of the Latissimus Dorsi and Teres Major, but sometimes has its origin from the Scapularis Interna, or from the Ar- ticularis Posterior. It takes a Spiral direction down- wards and outwards, between the Triceps and Bone, and terminates at the outer Condyle of the Os Humeri, by a Large communicating Radial, or Recurrent-Radial Branch: The Arteria Profunda sends Branches upwards, which inosculate with others from the Humeral and Scapulary Arteries. The principal Branches run to the Coraco- Brachialis and Triceps, and to the Muscles at the outer part of the Elbow;—and one of them, termed Large communicating Ulnar, or Proftmdo-Ulnar, descending at the inner side of the Arm, is sometimes so consider- able as to form— D 2 The

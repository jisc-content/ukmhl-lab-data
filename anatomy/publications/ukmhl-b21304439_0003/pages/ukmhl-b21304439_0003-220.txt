208 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part VII. the I rom the Pars Vaga, a little below the origin of the Recurrent, and likewise from the Root of the Recurrent itself. Nerves are sent oft', which form a Plexus, to bg dispersed, partly upon the Fleshy-Glandular Substance of the Trachea, and partly embracing the Esophagus, and forming upon it the small Esophageal Plexus. Behind the Root of the Lungs, about six or seven Nerves of different sizes are sent off in a transverse di- rection, whieh are termed Posterior Pulmonary Plexus, although they have few connections with each other. The Posterior Pulmonary Nerves, like the Anterior, follow the Branches of the Bronchi and Blood-vessels in the Substance of the Lungs, and, becoming gradually smaller, send off minute Twigs, which penetrate the Air-vessels, and are ultimately dispersed upon their In- ternal Membrane. After giving out the Pulmonary Nerves, the Pars Yaga is split into Cords, termed Great Esophageal Plexus, which surrounds the Esophagus, sends Fila- ments into its Substance, and is joined by Funiculi of the Pars Vaga of the opposite side.â€”It goes afterwards through the Diaphragm, to be distributed upon the Viscera of the Abdomen. From the Ganglia of the Great Sympathetic Nerve, at the bottom of the Neck, and top of the Thorax, the principal Cardiac Nerves are produced, which are dis- persed upon the Fleart, while the continuation of the Trunk of the Sympathetic descends in the Thorax at the side of the Vertebras. The Cardiac Nerves of the Right Side consist of the Cardiacus Magnus Profundus, and Cardiacus Minor ;

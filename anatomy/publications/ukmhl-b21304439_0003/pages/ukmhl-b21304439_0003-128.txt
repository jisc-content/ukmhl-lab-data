116 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part V. Besides the Vena Profunda, the Femoral Vein takes in small Veins from the External Parts of Genera- tion, from the Inguinal Glands, and from the other superficial parts of the Groin ;—and, in particular, it receives a Branch of considerable size, which de- scends from the Integuments of the fore side of the Ab- domen. The Trunk of the Femoralis, having received the dif- ferent Veins of the Inferior Extremity, passes into the Abdomen, behind Poupart’s Ligament, being still si- tuated at the inner side of the Artery,—after which it forms the Iliaca Externa. The Iliaca Externa receives into its beginning the Epigastric and Circumflex Veins of the Os Ilium, and sometimes the Vena Obturatrix. f It is situated at the jnsidc of the External Iliac Artery, and afterwards crosses behind it on the right, and be- hind the Internal Iliac Artery on the left side of the Pelvis, to join the Trunk of the Hypogastric Vein. The Vena Hypogastrica, or Iliaca Interna, is situated at the outer side of the Concomitant Artery, and receives the different Veins which correspond with the Branches of that Artery, and which are furnished with Valves where they are situated among the Fleshy part* of the Pelvis. The External and Internal Iliacs unite, and form the Common Iliacs, a little below the division of the corre- sponding Arteries. The Iliac.® Communes ascend by the right side of their respective Arteries, and a little below the Bifurca- tion of the Aorta,—or upon the fore part of the Fifth Lumbar

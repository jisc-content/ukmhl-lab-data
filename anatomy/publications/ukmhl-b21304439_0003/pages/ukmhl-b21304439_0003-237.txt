Under the Knee it gives off a Branch, named by Fis- cher Saphcenus Minor, which goes down a little behind the Saphaenus, and, furnishing Filaments to the Inte- guments of the inner and back part of the Leg, termi- nates behind the Malleolus Internus, on the Integu- ments of the Foot. The Trunk of the Sapluenus attends the Vena Sa- phaena Major, sending many Nervous Threads oblique- ly forwards to the Integuments on the inner and fore 1 part of the Leg, and is at length consumed upon the Skin and Cellular Substance of the upper and inner part of the Foot. The remaining part of the Fourth Lumbar Nerve unites with the Fifth into a Trunk which descends into the Pelvis. Sacral Nerves. The Sacral Nerves consist of small Posteriori and large Anterior Trunks. The Posterior Sacral Nerves pass out by the Holes in the back part of the Os Sacrum, and anasto- mose with each other, and with some of the Branches of the Gluteal Nerve.

72 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [PahtV. The Arteuia Splenica, nearly equal in size to the Trunk of the Hepatica, takes a long and serpentine course across the left side of the Body ; running first behind, then at the upper part of the Pancreas, in its way to the Spleen.—Its Branches are,— The Rami Pancreatici, which are few in number, and small. They run from the Splenic Artery, nearly at right angles,, and supply the greater part of the Pan- creas : The Gastrica Sinistra, Gastrica Inferior Sinistra, or Gastro-Epiploica Sinistra, which is considerably inferior in length and size to the Gastrica Dextra, communicates by its Branches with the Gastrica Superior and Inferior, while its Trunk runs a little way towards the right side, along the great Curvature of the Stomach. It sends some Rami Pancreatici, and Gastro-Epiploici, and Meso-colici Sinistri, to the Pancreas, to the left portions of the Omentum ^nd Meso-colon ; while its Trunk frequently forms a common Arch with the G^s- trica Dextra: Three or four considerable Branches, termed Vasa Brevia, or Arterice Breves, which run to the left part of the great Curvature of the Stomach, to be distributed upon the upper and under parts of its large extremity; their Ramifications anastomosing with those of the Su- perior and of the Left Inferior Gastric Arteries. The Rami Splenici, which are also contorted, are se- veral in number, and of considerable size. They go at the concave side of the Spleen, to be distributed through- out the whole of its substance, but in such a manner that

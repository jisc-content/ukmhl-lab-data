The Superior Petrosal Sinuses, situatefl upon the Iiidges of the Partes Petrosae. They receive some small Veins from the Dura Mater and Base of the Brain, and communicate backwards with the Lateral, and forwards with the Cavernous Si- nuses ; The Inferior Petrosal Sinuses, placed at the roots of the Partes Petrosae.—They receive theJBlood from the Cavernous, and discharge it into the ends of the Late- ral Sinuses. Besides the Sinuses mentioned above, the following also are frequently met with, viz. A Perpendicular Occipital Sinus, situated in the Falx Cerebelli, which is sometimes single, sometimes double, and terminates in the Lateral Sinuses.—Jt receives Veins from the Dura Mater, and communicates with the Ver- tebral Veins: The Anterior Superior, and Anterior Inferior Occipi- tal Sinuses, placed over the Cuneiform Process of the Occipital Bone, and communicating with the Inferior Petrosal and Lateral Sinuses, and with the Vertebral Veins. Internal Jugular Vein. The Lateral Sinuses, having received the Blood sent to the Brain from the Carotid and Vertebral Arteries, (. * . • pass

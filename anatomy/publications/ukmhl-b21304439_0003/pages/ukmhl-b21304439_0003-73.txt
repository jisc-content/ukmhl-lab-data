61' jPart V.] OF THE BLOOD-VESSELS. Near the Joint of the Elbow, the Deep Radial Ulnarâ€ž , and Interosseous Veins, form a Plexus over the Bifurca- tion of the Humeral Artery. From this Plexus, a short but large Branch passes outwards, and forms a communication with one of the Subcutaneous Veins, and, in general, the communica- tion is with one of the Median Veins. The Vena Axillaris, formed by the Trunks of the Su- perficial and Deep Humeral Veins, receives the Veins corresponding with the Circumflex Arteries, and the In- ternal, and the Inferior Dorsal Veins of the Scapula. A little higher, it is joined by the Vena Tkoracicat Externa, and about this place changes its name for that of Subclavian Vein. The Vena Subclavia passes between the Clavicle and First Rib, at the inner side of the Trunk of the Artery, and afterwards goes over the fore part of the Scalenus Anterior, at the under end of the Neck. After crossing the First Rib, it receives the Vein cor- responding with the Superior Dorsal Artery of the Sca- pula, the Veins which belong to the Cervical Arteries, and also small Veins from the Skin and Muscles on the back part of the Neck. While situated in the Neck, it likewise receives the External, and then the Internal Jugular Veinsand near this last, a Vein of considerable size, which corresponds with the Trunk of the Vertebral Artery. The Vertebral Vein communicates within the Cranium,. by small Branches, with the Inferior Petrosal Sinuses, or with the Occipital Sinuses ; but is chiefly formed by Branches arising from the Spinal Marrow and its Mem- branes,

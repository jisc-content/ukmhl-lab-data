159 Part VII.] OF THE NERVES. They run each in a Furrow, upon the under Surface of the Anterior Lobes of the Brain, converging a little, and becoming somewhat larger, till they reach the Cri- briform Plate of the Ethmoid Bone. Upon this Plate, each forms an Oblong Bulb, which, in colour and consistence, resembles the Cortical part of the Brain, but is mixed with streaks of Medullary Matter. From this Bulb, numerous Nervous Filaments are sent off, which pass through the Holes of the Cribri- form Plate, and now become firm and strong like the other Nerves, by receiving a covering from the Dura Mater. After entering the Nose, they divide into two Por- tions or Planes, one passing on the Septum, the other upon the Ossa Turbinata, and other parts opposite to the Septum, and both running at first in Grooves of the Bones. They form a beautiful Plexus, which is spread out upon that side of the Membrane of the Nose which is contiguous to the Bones, and maybe traced a consider- able way upon it in distinct Threads, which, becoming gradually smaller, sink into the Membrane, and arc sup- posed to terminate on the Surface next the Cavity of the Nose, there constituting the Organ of Smell. The Second Pair, or Optic Nerves, which are of great size, arise from the Tlialami Optici, and arc con- nected in their passage to Tubercles at the root of the Infundibulum, which furnish them with an addition of Medullary Substance. They are of a purer white than other Nerves, having less

[Part V. of the Lingual Artery, running at the under and lateral part of the Tongue, and terminating near its point: The Arteria Facialis, Maxillaris Externa, La- uialis, vel Angularis, which also runs forwards, and goes under the Stylo-Hyoideus, and Tendon of the Di- gastricus. It perforates the Submaxillary Gland, mounts suddenly over the Angle of the Lower Jaw, at the under and fore part of the Massc-ter, from whence it proceeds^ in a tortuous manner by the side of the Nose, towards the inner Corner of the Eye. In this course, it sends the following Branches to the adjacent parts: The Palatina Inferior, vel Ascenders, which runs up- wards upon the side of the Pharynx, covered by the Sty- loideus, to be dispersed, by a Superficial and a Deep Pa- latine Branch, upon the Velum Palati and parts near it: A Branch spread out by many Twigs upon the Ton- sil, and reaching as far as the Tongue : Branches to the Inferior Maxillary Gland: Small Branches to the root of the Tortguc, to the Skin, Muscles, &c. near the Angle of the Jaw : The Arteria Suhmentalis, which advances between the anterior Belly of the Digastrieus, the Mylo-IIyoideus, and Base of the Lower Jaw, furnishing Branches to the Submaxillary Gland, the Skin, Mylo-Hyoideus, Chin, and Under Lip: A Branch, upon the outside of the Jawr, to the Mas- seter: The Inferior Labial Artery, which arises a little higher than the former, and goes to the lower part of the Un- der

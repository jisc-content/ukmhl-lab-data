Part VII.] OF THE NERVES 231 One or two Cutaneous Branches, dispersed upon the Skin at the under and inner part of the Leg: Near the Ankle, a Branch which passes behind the Tendo Achillis; principally to the Integuments of the outer and back part of the Foot. The Tibial Nerve passes afterwards between the Ar- teries and Os Calcis into the Sole. In the hollow of the Os Calcis, after detaching Branches to the parts adjacent, it divides into Internal and External Plantar Nerves, which are nearly of equal size. The Internal Plantar Nerve runs near the inner side of the Sole, sends Filaments to the Abductor Pol- licis. Flexor Digitorum Brevis, and Flexor Digitorum Accessorius, and Twigs to the Lumbricales. It afterwards gives out four large Branches, splitting into others, which run with the Arteries along the Plan- tar sides of the three first Toes, and inner side of the fourth Toe,â€”in the manner the Radial Nerve runs along the corresponding Fingers. The External Plantar Nerve sends Branches to the Heel, and passes with the Artery of the same name to near the Outer edge of the Sole, where it splits into three principal Branches. The two first run to the adjacent sides of the Fourth and Fifth Toes, and outer side of the Little Toe ; the inner one often anastomosing with a corresponding Branch of the Internal Plantar. The third forms an Arch corresponding with that of the External Plantar Artery, furnishes Branches to the short Muscles of the Little Toe, to the Interossei, Lum- P I) bricales.

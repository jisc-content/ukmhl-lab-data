166 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [PatitVII. 'which penetrate into the Palate-Plate of the Superior Maxillary Bone: Small Branches, which pass round the Upper Jaw, and vanish in the Cheek: A Twig, which goes through the Hole in the Os Malm, along with a Brand) of the Ocular Artery to the Face: Small Filaments, which run down into the back part of the Superior Maxillary Bone, and supply the Sub- stance of the Upper Jaw, the Large Dentes Molares, and Membrane lining the Antrum Maxillare. The Second Part of the Fifth Pair, after sending off these different Branches, goes into the Canal under the Orbit, and forms the Infra-Orbitar Nerve, which, while in the Canal, gives off Filaments passing through mi- nute Conduits in the Upper Jaw, to the Antrum, to the Substance of the Bone, to the small Molares, Caninus, and Incisores *, and sometimes a Twig, the companion of a small Branch of the Internal Maxillary Artery, to the Membrane lining the Orbit. The Infra-Orbitar Nerve passes afterwards out of the Foramen Infra-Orbitarium, and divides into many large Branches, to be distributed upon the Cheek, Under Eye-Lid, Upper Lip, and side of the Nose. The Third Branch, or Inferior Maxillary Nerve, goes through the Foramen Ovale of the Sphe- noid Bone, and supplies the parts belonging to the Un- der Jawr, and the Muscles situated between it and the Os Hyoides, by the following Branches, viz. One or sometimes two Deep Temporal Branches, to the inner part of the Temporal Muscle: Branches

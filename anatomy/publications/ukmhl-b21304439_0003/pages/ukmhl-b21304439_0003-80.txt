The Arterije Diaphragmatic^ are two in number, one on each side, which arise from the fore part of the Aorta as soon as it enters the Abdomen. In general, their origins are distinct from each other, but sometimes they arise from a common Trunk ; and now and then, one or both originate from the root of the Cceliaca, or even from the lleual or Lumbar Ar- teries. They afterwards go obliquely upwards and outwards over the Crura of the Diaphragm, spread out into many Branches, which are chiefly dispersed upon its fleshy sides, and inosculate with those which enter at its upper Surface. They likewise give small Branches to the Glandulae Renales, to the Cardia, and parts in general which lie near them. The Venas Diaphragmatic®, like their corresponding Arteries, run upon the under part of the Diaphragm, and terminate in the Inferior Cava behind the Liver,— the right being commonly a little lower than the left.

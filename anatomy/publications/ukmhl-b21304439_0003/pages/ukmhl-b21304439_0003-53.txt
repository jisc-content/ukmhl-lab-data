i?AKT V.J OF THE BLOOD-VESSELS. u t* ternal or Internal Jugular Veins.—The rest go into thp nearest Sinuses of the Brain. Veins of the Brain. The smaller Veins of the Brain accompany the Ar- teries. Their Trunks run chiefly between the Circum- volutions of the Brain, at a distance from the Trunks of the Arteries. They terminate in the different Sinuses of the Dura Mater, and generally in an oblique direction, which prevents the Blood from returning into them. The Sinuses most commonly found are the following: The Superior Longitudinal Sinus, which begins at the under part of the Spine of the Frontal Bone,—runs along the upper edge of the Falx, and, becoming gra- dually wider, terminates upon the middle of the Occipi- tal Bone, in the two lateral Sinuses. I It receives the Blood from the upper part of the Brain, by several large Venous Trunks, which enter it oblique- ly forwards: The Torcidar Herophili, or Fourth Sinus of the An- cients, chiefly formed by the Vena Galeni, which re- turns the Blood from the Choroid Plexus, Corpora Striata, Septum Lucidum, and other internal parts of the Brain. The Torcular passes back in the joining of the Falx and Tentorium, and terminates, along with the Supe- rior Longitudinal Sinus, in the beginning of the Late- ral Sinuses: The Inferior Longitudinal Sinus, a remarkably small one,

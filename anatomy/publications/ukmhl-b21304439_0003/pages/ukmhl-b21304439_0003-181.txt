Part VII.] OF THE NERVES. 169 rior part of the Fourth Ventricle, and is separated from its fellow of the opposite side only by the Crena of the Calamus Scriptorius. The Striae, turning round the Medulla Oblongata, apply themselves to the Tuber Annulare, from which they receive an addition of Substance, and then get to the side of the Portio Dura. The Portio Dura, sometimes also called Sympathe- ticus Minor, arises from that part of the Brain which is common to the Pons Varolii, Crura Cerebelli, and Medulla Oblongata; and, at its origin, is situated upon the inner side of the Portio Mollis. Between the origin of the Portio Dura and Trunk of the Portio Mollis, a small Nerve arises, termed by Wrisberg, Portio Meed a inter Portionem Duram et Portionem Mollem. It comes off by minute Fibrillae, which soon unite into a Trunk, from the posterior part of the Pons Va- rolii, or from the adjoining part of the Medulla Oblongata, and is an Accessory Nerve of the Portio Dura. The Portio Dura, considerably smaller than the Por- tio Mollis, gets into a Cul-de-Sac of the Meatus Audi- torius Internus, and is there lodged in a kind of half- sheath, formed by the Nerve, to which it is connected by fine Cellular Substance; the Dura Mater, which lines the Passage, giving here a general Covering to both Nerves.

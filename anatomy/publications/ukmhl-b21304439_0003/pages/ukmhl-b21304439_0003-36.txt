2* COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [PartY. The Transversalis Faciei, which arises nearly oppo- site to the Internal Maxillary. It proceeds transversely under the Zygoma, over the Masseter, and near the Parotid Duct. After giving Branches to the Parotid Gland, it supplies a large portion of the Cheek, com- municating with the Facial and Internal Maxillary Ar- teries : The Articular Artery, which sends Branches to the Articulation of the Jaw, the External Meatus and Mem- brana Tympani, and penetrates as far as the Inner Ear, communicating with the Arteria Stylo-Mastoidea: The Deep Temporal Branch, sent off behind the Condyle of the Jaw, which ascends obliquely forwards under the Aponeurosis of the Temporal Muscle to the outer part of the Orbit: Anterior Auricular Branches, which come off near the Origin of the former Branch, and are ramified upon the fore part of the Ear, inosculating there with the Posterior Auricular Artery: Branches to the Masseter, which comrfiunicate in the Cheek with the Facial and Internal Maxillary Arteries. The Temporal Artery, having detached the Branches mentioned above, forms one or two sharp turns before the Ear ; and a little above the root of the Zygoma, where the Pulsation of the Artery can be felt, and fre- quently even seen, it divides into two Large Branches, an Anterior and Posterior, which are placed superficially between the Integuments of the Head and Aponeurosis of the Temporal Muscle. The Anterior, Internal Anterior, or Temporo-Frontal Branch, advances in a Serpentine direction, spreading out

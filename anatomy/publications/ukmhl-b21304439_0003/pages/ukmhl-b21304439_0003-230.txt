218 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part VII. NERVES OF THE ORGANS OF URINE AND GENERATION. The Nerves of the Organs of Urine and Generation consist of the Renal and Hypogastric Plexus, and of the Spermatic and Pudic Branches. The Renal Plexus is composed of Nerves sent from the Coeliac Ganglia, joined by some others derived from one or two of the Ganglia of the Sympathetic Nerve in the bottom of the Thorax. It is interspersed, at its beginning, with small Gan- glia, termed Renal, and is afterwards divided into An- terior and Posterior Plexuses, which extend along the corresponding Surfaces of the Renal Artery, accompa- nying its Branches in the Substance of the Kidney. From the Renal Plexus, small Nervous Twigs ascend to the Renal Gland, w'hich is furnished with others from the Coeliac Ganglia and root of the Hepatic Plexus. The Renal Plexus also sends down Filaments to sup- ply the upper portion of the Ureter,â€”the under receiv- ing Nerves from the Hypogastric Plexus. The Hypogastric Plexus, the origin and course of which have been already mentioned, is connected by different Nerves to the adjacent Trunks of the Great Sympathetic and Sacral Nerves, and sends many Branches

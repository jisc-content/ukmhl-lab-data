I IPart V.] OF THE BLOOD-VESSELS. HI The Trunk of the Artery divide, in the Hollow of ; the Os Calcis, at the place where it is about to go be- 1 hind the Abductor Pollicis, into two principal Plantar Branches,—the Interna and Externa. The Plantar Arteries run forwards under the Apo- ; neurosis Plantaris, having the Flexors of the Toes be- tween them. The Plantaris Interna passes near the inner side i of the Sole, between the Aponeurosis Plantaris and Abductor Pollicis. It gives Branches which run in a retrograde direc- tion to the back part of'the Ankle and adjacent parts of the Heel: Several Branches from each side, which go forwards to the Muscles and Integuments, and other parts at the ' concave edge of the Sole. At the root of the Great Toe, it sends a Principal Branch to its inner side; it then passes under the Flexor Longus I’ollicis, and, after anastomosing with the Arcus Plantaris, gives off a Large Biancli which splits into two,—one to the outer side of the Great Toe, and the other to the adjacent side ol the Toe next it. The Plantaris Externa, which may be considered as the continuation of the Trunk, being in general much larger than the Jnterna,—passes obliquely outwards be- tween the Flexor Brevis Digitorum and Flexor Acces- sorius, till it reaches the Base of the Metatarsal Bone of the Little Toe. It is afterwards arched forward, between the Flexors and Metatarsal Bones of the small Toes, the Trunk be- ing

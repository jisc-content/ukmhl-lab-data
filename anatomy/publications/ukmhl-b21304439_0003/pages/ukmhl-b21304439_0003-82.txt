7a COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part V. The Trunk of the Artery afterwards divides, upon the small Curvature of the Stomach, into principal Branches, some of which run across the upper and un- der Surfaces, and others obliquely towards the right side, supplying a large portion of the Stomach, and sending Twigs to the Omentum Minus,—while the Trunk is frequently extended as far as the Pylorus. The Arteria Hepatica, the largest of the three great Branches, is concealed at its root by the Pancreas, and passes obliquely forwards, upwards, and to the right side, behind the Pylorus,—before and a little to the right side of the Lobulus Spigerii,—till it arrives at the Cavi- ty of the Liver, called Porta. Where it approaches the Porta, it divides into the Gastrica Inferior Dextra, and the Proper Hepatic Ar- tery. The Gastrica Dextra, or Gastrica Inferior Dextra, or Gastro-Epjploica Dextra, sends out— The Arteria Pylorica, which, however, is frequently produced immediately from the Hepatic artery. It gives Branches to the Pylorus and other parts about the small end of the Stomach, and afterwards runs some way along its small Curvature, inosculating with the Superior Gastric Artery. Besides this principal Branch, there are a few smaller ones sent from the Gastrica Inferior to the Pylorus: The Duodenclis, which is dispersed upon the begin- ning and right portion of the Duodenum, along with other Branches coming from the same source, but of inferior size.

3 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part V. The pillaryi as expressive of their smallness, is applied to their minutest Branches. The Diameters of the different Trunks and Branches of the Arteries, vary much in different parts of the Body; but those of the Capillaries are more nearly equal to each other. The Arteries terminate in the following manner, viz. In Red Veins, as is observed by the assistance of the Microscope and by Injections: In Glands or Follicles, by Secretory Ducts, which se- parate a Fluid from the general Mass of Blood : In Exhalent Vessels, which discharge their Contents into the Internal Cavities, or upon the External Sur- face of the Body: In colourless or Lymphatic Branches, which are af- terwards continued to the Circulating Veins, as in the Cart lages and Cornea. The Use of the Arteries is to convey Blood from the Heart to the different parts of the Body: To assist in converting the Chyle into Blood: To nourish the Body, and promote its Growth: To assist in preserving the Fluidity of the Blood, and the Heat and Life of the Body: To form the different Secretions; and, To renew the Growth of Parts destroyed by Accident or Disease. Veins. The Veins are Elastic Flexible Tubes, returning the Blood from the different parts of the Body to the Heart, =—and have no Pulsation. *■ i< . .

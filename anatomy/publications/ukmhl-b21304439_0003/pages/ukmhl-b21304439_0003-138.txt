326 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part VL Like other Glands, they are supplied with Arteries^ Veins, and Nerves, which they derive from those of the adjacent parts. They are described by some Anatomists as being composed of Cells internally, while others consider them £ts being a Congeries of convoluted Absorbent Vessels.— Most of the Glands have much of the former, but many of them of the latter appearance. The Absorbents entering into the Glands, arc called Vasa Infercntia. Whent they approach, or come in contact with the Gland, they split into radiated Branch- es, which, after spreading out upon it, penetrate into its Substance, where they divide almost to infinity, in some parts coiling up upon themselves; then they re- join, and pass out at the opposite side. The greater part of the Absorbents, approaching a Gland, terminate in it in this manner, while others turn aside, or go over it, and terminate in other Absor- bents, or in other Glands. From the opposite side of the Glands, the Vessels go out nearly in the manner they entered them, and are there termed Vasa Ejferentia. These arc frequently, though by no means always, fewer in number, but larger than the Vasa Infercntia. Most of the Absorbents go through several Glands, but in some parts through one only, before they reach their general terminations. The Lymph and Chyle are strained through the Glands, by which they are supposed, to undergo certain changes,—but the nature of these changes has not yet been

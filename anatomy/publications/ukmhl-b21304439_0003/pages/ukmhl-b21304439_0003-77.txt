Towards the fore part of the Thorax, each sends off a Branch to the upper edge of the Rib below it. They furnish Branches to the Spine, to the Spinal Marrow, and its Membranes, to the Intercostales, Pleu- ra, &c.; also numerous Branches to the Muscles on the outside of the Thorax, and communicate with those of the Internal and External Mammary Arteries. The first of the Aortic Intercostals inosculates with the Superior Intercostal of the Subclavian ;—the last, passing behind the Crus of the Diaphragm, goes over the Quadratus Lumborum, and follows the margin of the Twelfth Rib, to be distributed upon the Tendon of the Transversalis Abdominis: The Pericardiaca, Superior and Posterior, a small Branch arising sometimes from the concave side ’of the Arch of the Aorta, although more frequently from the Subclavian or Internal Mammary, and sending Vol. III. • E Twigs

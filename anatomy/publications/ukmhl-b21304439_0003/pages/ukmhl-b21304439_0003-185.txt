ITS Part VII.] OF THE NERVES. They Twigs to the back part of the Ear, and terminates in the Oblique Muscles of the Head. It sends a Branch to the Digastricus, and another to the Stylo-Hyoideus ; gives off a Filament which joins the Auricular Branch of the Inferior Maxillary Nerve, and goes to the fore part of the Ear ; and is connected by another small Filament at the under part of the Ear, with Branches of the Sympathetic Nerve which run along the External Carotid Artery. It also furnishes Filaments to the Parotid Gland, and then perforates it; dividing into large Branches, which join, separate, and rejoin, different times, on the side of the Face. This Plexus is expanded in such a manner as to con- stitute what has b?en called by some Pes Anserinus, and is divided into the following Sets of Branches, viz. The Temporal Branches, which ascend upon the side of the Head, to be distributed upon the Temple; some running over, others under the Branches of the Tem- poral Artery, and forming several joinings with the Frontal Branches of the first part of the Fifth Pair of Nerves : The Superior Facial Branches, which are dispersed upon the Orbicularis Oculi, and the parts in general about the outer Angle of the Eye, communicating in various places above and below the Orbit, with the first and second Branches of the Fifth Pair: The Middle Facial Branch, or the Great Facial Nerve, which runs across the Masseter, and divides into many Branches, to be dispersed upon the Cheek, and side of the Nose and Lips:

1S6 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [PartVJL Denticulatum, is situated, which is attached to the Dura Mater, where that Membrane comes out from the Cra- nium, and accompanies the Spinal Marrow to its infe- rior extremity. It adheres by Cellular Substance to the Pia Mater, and sends off from its opposite sides slender Cords, in the form of Denticuli, which carry the Tunica Arach- noidea along with them, and, running more or less in a transverse direction, are fixed, each by minute Fibres, to the Dura Mater, in the interstices of the Fasciculi. The Ligamenta Denticulata or tlie right and left sides incorporate with the Pia Mater at the inferior extremity or Conical Point of the Spinal Marrow, and form a Ligamentous Filament which perforates the under end of the Dura Mater, and is fixed by small Fibres to the Membranes covering the Os Coccygis, in the manner the Denticuli are fixed to the Dura Mater. It is termed by some Authors Ligamcntum Pice Matrits, and was considered by the Ancients as the Fortieth Pair of Nerves. It assists in preventing the Spinal Marrow and the tender Origin of the Nerves from being overstretched. Having got between the Vertebrae, each of the pos- terior Bundles forms a Ganglion, from the opposite end of which a Nerve comes out, and is immediately joined by the anterior Bundle, thus constituting the beginnings of the Trunks of the Spinal Nerves. The Nervous Cords sent out from the Spinal Mar- row, after receiving their Coverings from the Dura Ma- ter, become considerably larger than the Fasciculi which form

Part VII.] OF THE NERVES. 213 Through the rest of their course, they send off Brandies to the Intercostales, to the Muscles and Integuments of the Thorax, and also to those of the Abdomen, and, becoming gradually smaller, they at last vanish in the fore part of the Body. The six upper Intercostals send Branches to the nu- merous Muscles, and to the Integuments covering the back part of the Thorax, to the Serratus Magnus, and to the upper part of the Abdominal Muscles ; while the remains of them, passing out between the Ribs at the edge of the Sternum, are reflected along with Branches of the Internal Mammary Blood-vessels, to be dispers- ed by small Filaments upon the Mamma, and likewise upon the Muscles and Integuments next the edge of the Sternum. The Trunk of the First Intercostal enters into the com- position of the Axillary Plexus ; a Brandi of it, however, runs along the edge of the First Rib, in the manner the other Intercostals run along their respective Ribs. Two Principal Branches, one from the Second, and the other from the Third Intercostal, are occupied in forming the Intercosto-PIumeral Nerves, already de- scribed ; while a considerable Branch from the Fourth is reflected over the edge of the I.atissimus Dorsi to the Integuments of the back part of the Thorax. The Six Lower Intercostals, after supplying the ad- jacent Muscles and Integuments of the Thorax, con- tinue their course obliquely forwards, and are dispersed upon the different Muscles and Integuments of the Ab- domen ;â€”the Twelfth, running from the lust Rib along 0 3 the

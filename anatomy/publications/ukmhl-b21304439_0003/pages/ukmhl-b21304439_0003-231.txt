Part VII.] OF THE NERVES. 21 9 Brandies to the Rectum, Bladder, and Spermatic Ves- sels in the Male ; and to the Rectum, Bladder, Uterus, and Vagina in the Female.—The Nerves of the Uterus are proportionally small.—They pass into its Substance at the Cervix, and follow the course of the Blood- vessels. Spermatic Nerves.—The Spermatic Nerves are very minute;—they consist of a Superior or Inter- nal, and of an Inferior or External Set of Capillary Branches. The former are derived from the Renal and Aortic Plexus, and accompany the Spermatic Blood-vessels in their course through the Abdomen, and afterwards to the Testicle. The latter are sent off from a Branch of the second Lumbar Nerve, which, running near the Spermatic Ves- sels, detaches a Filament, which, in the Male, goes in the Spermatic Cord towards the Testicle, but is more particularly dispersed upon the Cremaster. In the Fe- male, Filaments are reflected from it along the Liga- mentum Rotundum to the Uterus. Nervi Pudici.—The Nervi Pudici arise in two Fas- ciculi,—a Superior and Inferior,—which are formed by Fibrillae from all the Cords entering into the composition of the Sciatic Nerve. The Superior Fasciculus consists, more particular- ly, of Threads from the two under Lumbar and two upper Sacral Nerves;—the Inferior is composed of a small Cord from the Second, and a large one from the Third Sacral. The Fasciculi pass through the under part of the Notch

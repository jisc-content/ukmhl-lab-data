Part VII.] OF THE NERVES. 1(35 are subdivided into still smaller Branches, which run in a radiated and waving direction ; the Ciliary Vessels being interposed. Near the Pupil, they are united into Arches, from which very minute Twigs run to the interior margin of the Iris. The Second Branch, or Superior Maxillary Nerve, is larger than the Ophthalmic, and is princi- pally dispersed upon the Parts belonging to the Upper Jaw, from which it has its name. It goes through the Foramen Rotundum of the Sphe- noid Bone, and at its exit divides into numerous Branches, viz. The Spheno-Palatine, or Lateral Kasai Nerve, which sends a reflected Branch through the Foramen Ptery- goideum of the Sphenoid Bone, to join the Sympathetic. Nerve in the Canalis Caroticus, and a Branch which enters the Foramen Innominatum of the Pars Petrosa, to join the Portio Dura of the Seventh Pair. The Lateral Nasal Nerve goes afterwards into the Spheno-Palatine Hole, to be dispersed upon the under and back part of the Septum, and opposite side of the Nose, and upon the Membrane of the Sphenoidal Sinus and Eustachian Tube : One Branch, in particular, after passing along the Septum, goes through the Foramen Incisivum to the Roof of the Mouth. The Palato-Maxillary, or Palatine Branch, which descends through the Canal leading to the Foramen Palatinum Posterius, and running near the Alveoli with considerable Blood-vessels, sends Branches to the Velum Palati and Roof of the Mouth, and minute Filaments L 3 which

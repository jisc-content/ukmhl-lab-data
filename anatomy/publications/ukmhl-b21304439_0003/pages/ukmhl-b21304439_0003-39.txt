Fart V.] OF THE BLOOD-VESSELS. 27 ticum, and creeps under the Optic Nerve, included in the Dura Mater, towards the outer part of the Orbit. After proceeding some way through the Orbit, it tra- verses its Cavity, taking a spiral direction towards the Nose, between the Optic Nerve and Depressor Oculi Muscle. In this'course, it first transmits Filaments to the Dura Mater and Substance ot the Optic Nerve, and to the beginning of the Muscles in the bottom of the Orbit; after which it gives off the following Branches, viz. The Arleria Lacrymalis, which runs at the outside of the Orbit, and is chiefly dispersed upon the Lacrymal Gland ; some Threads advancing to the Eye-lids. One Twiff to the Periosteum of the Orbit, and another through the Cheek-bone: The Arteria Centralis Ret hire, which penetrates the Optic Nerve a little behind the Ball of the Eye,â€”runs in the centre of the Nerve, and spreads out into many small Branches upon the inside of the Retina. When the Nerve is cut across near the Ball of the Eye, the Orifice of the divided Central Artery is ob- servable, which, before its nature was understood, was known by the name of Porus Opticus. In the Adult, the Central Artery appears to termi- nate entirely upon the Retina ; but in the Foetus, after furnishing, at the bottom of the Orbit, the Branches proper to the Retina, the Trunk is continued forwards through the Axis of the Vitreous Humour, supplying its Cells and Membrane with delicate Filaments, and afterwards spreading out upon the back part of the Cap- sule of the Lens. Its

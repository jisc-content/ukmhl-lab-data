I Part VII.] OF THE NERVES. 157 : they are composed of Fibrillse which come off in con- i trary directions ;—the one set from the beginning, the ■ other from the opposite extremity of the Ganglion. The Nerves which go out from the different Ganglia have the same structure with those which enter them, but are found, with only a few exceptions, to be rather larger. In the Trunk of a Nerve, the Cords appear to run parallel to each other; but when macerated in water, so as to dissolve the Cellular Substance, or when other- wise accurately examined, they are seen evidently to in- termix somewhat after the same manner of the Fibrilla? in the Plexus, or in the Ganglia.—Obs. on Nerv. Syst. The Termination of the Nerves is soft, pulpy, and pellucid, as is distinctly seen in the Retina of the Eye or Ear ; the external Covering being entirely laid aside, while the Pia Mater, in particular, accompanies them throughout. The Nerves preserve the motion of the Muscular Fi- bres. They constitute the immediate Organs of Sensation, and convey impressions made upon them to the Mind. The manner in which these Impressions are produced, —whether by a Vibration communicated to the Nerves ; —or by a Liquid called Nervous Fluid, contained and moving in them j—or by an Electric Matter common to them and many other Substances;—or in what manner that Power acts, termed Animal Electricity, which has been lately discovered to take place in the Animal king- dom, upon the application of certain Metals,—is not yet understood.

200 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part VIE Branches:â€”Twigs, however, are sent from it to the Coats of the adjacent Vessels. At the bending of the Elbow, it slips over the Ten- don of the Brachialis Interims, and perforates the back part of the Pronator Teres. It afterwards descends between the Flexor Radialis and Musculus Sublimis, and goes in the middle of the interval of the Radial and Ulnar Artery in its way to the Hand. When it approaches the Fore Arm, it transmits Branches to the Pronator Teres and Integuments near that Muscle. In the Flexure of the Arm, it furnishes Branches to the Pronator, Flexor Radialis, and Flexor Sublimis, and an Interosseous Branch, which, in some Subjects, receives an addition from the Spiral Nerve. '1 he Interosseous Nerve gives Branches to the Flexor Longus Pollicis, and to the Flexor Profundus Digito- rum, descends upon the Interosseous Ligament with the Vessels of that name, and terminates in the Prona- tor Quadratus. Near the Hand, it sends a Branch, dividing into others which supply the Muscles and integuments form- ing the Ball of the Thumb. The Trunk of the Nerve, having given Branches to the Fore Arm, passes under the Annular Ligament of the Wrist, where it divides into Branches which are si- tuated behind the Aponeurosis Palmaris and Superficial Arch of the Arteries. The principal Branches in the Palm come off in three divisions, from which seven Nerves of considerable size are

C4 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part V. Aorta, and arc distributed to the Lungs. They con- sist of. The Biionchialis Dextra, which arises sometimes from the Aorta, more frequently, however, from the uppermost Aortic Intercostal, and runs to the corre- sponding Lung : The Bronchialis Communis, which is only some- times present. It arises from the upper and fore part of the descending Aorta, divides into two Branches •, one to the left side of the Lungs, the other to the right side, and also to the Esophagus: The Bhonchiales Sinistras, Superior and Inferior* which are of unequal size, from the fore part of the Aorta, at a little distance from each other; the Infe- rior occasionally coming off from those of the Esopha- geals. The Bronchial Arteries send small Brandies to the Esophagus, to the posterior Mediastinum and Pericar- dium, and afterwards accompany the Branches of the Trachea through the Substance of the Lungs, being dispersed upon the Bronchi, upon the Coats of the Pul- monary Artery and Veins, and upon the Cellular Sub- stance and Membranes of the Lungs; where they com- municate also by minute Blanches with the Pulmo- nary Artery: The ArteriasEsophage.®, which are minute Branch- es, arising from the different parts of the Aorta, or from the Bronchials, and dispersed upon the Esophagus, also sending Twigs to the Posterior Mediastinum and Peri- cardium. The Intercostaus Superior, which comes off from the

59 Part V.] OF THE BLOOD-VESSELS. they unite, separate, and re-unite several times, thus forming a Plexus by which it is surrounded. The Superficial Veins from the back of the Hand, (one of which belonging to the Little Finger, was term- ed Salvatella by the Ancients), go chiefly to the Superfi- cial Radial and Ulnar Veins, and to the Vein termed Mediana Longa. The Superficial Radial Veins go to the Vena Cephali- ca, and the Superficial Ulnar Veins to the Vena Basili- ca, at the Joint of the Elbow. The Superficial Veins on the anterior part of the Fore Arm form a Plexus which communicates laterally with the Radial and Ulnar Veins, and particularly with the Trunk of the Mediana Longa. From this Plexus an Internal Median Trunk, or a Mediana Longa Minor, is commonly formed, which terminates in the Basilica. The Mediana Longa, or Mediana Longa Major, arises by numerous Branches from the back of the Hand and root of the Thumb, and communicates with the Vena Salvatella. It crosses over the Radius, and has a slanting direc- tion, and a little below the bending of the Elbow, is divided into two short Veins, the Mediana Cephalica "and Mediana Basilica, which, running obliquely up- wards, terminate a little above the Elbow, the former in the Cephalic, and the latter, crossing over the Hu- meral Artery, in the Basilic Vein. Though this description corresponds with the general distribution of the Veins of the Fore Arm, yet so great is

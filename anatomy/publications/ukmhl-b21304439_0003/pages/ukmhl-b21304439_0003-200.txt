188 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part VIE The Lumbar and Sacral Fasciculi, while included in the Dura Mater, lorm a Bundle of Cords, termed Cau- da Equina, from the resemblance it has to the tail of a Horse; especially when the Fmrjllae of the Nerves are unravelled by separating them from each other. The Fasciculi perforate the Dura Muter, nearly op- posite to the parts where they pass through the Verte- brae,—of course the Nerves of the inferior parts of the Spinal Marrow emerge from the Spine, considerably lower than the different origins. Blood-Vessels of the Sfinal Marrow.—The Arteries of the Spinal Marrow consist of Anterior and Posterior Spinal Arteries, and of many additional Branches communicating with others from the adjacent Vessels. The Anterior Spijial Arteries arise, one on each side, from the Vertebrals, near where these join to form the Basilar Artery. Upon the beginning of the Spinal Marrow, they ge- nerally unite into a common Trunk, which descends in that depression on the Anterior Surface of the Medulla, whereby it is distinguished into two Lateral Portions, and in this course is covered by the Tunica Arachnoi- dea. The Artery continues nearly of the same size throughout, in consequence of additions it receives from the neighbouring Arteries. In the Neck it communicates with the V ertebral, Thyroid, and Cervical Arteries, by Branches which pass through the same Holes with the Nerves. In the Back, it receives Branches from the Intercos- tal,

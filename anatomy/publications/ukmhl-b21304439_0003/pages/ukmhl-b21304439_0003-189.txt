The External Branch,—which Scarpa considers as more properly termed Pharyngo-Laryngeus,—is origi- nally composed of a Branch from the Internal Laryn- geal, and another from the Great Sympathetic; and is connected by a Filament to the Pharyngeal, and some- times also by one to the Internal Laryngeal Nerve. It imparts Twigs to the Middle and Lower Constric- tors of the Pharynx, and afterwards terminates in the Thyroid Gland and inner part of the Larynx. The Filament, sent from the Pars Vaga at the bottom of the Neck, joins the Great Cardiac Branch of the Sympathetic Nerve in the upper part of the Thorax, to be dispersed upon the Heart. The Ninth Pair,—frequently termed Lingualcs, and sometimes also Linguales Medii,—arise from the under and lateral parts of the Corpora Pyramidalia, on the fore side of the Medulla Oblongata, by numerous Fila- ments which are collected into Fasciculi. They pass out at the Superior Condyloid Foramina of the Occipital Bone, after which they adhere, for some way, to the Eighth Fair, by Cellular Substance. A little below the Cranium, each of the Trunks of this Pair of Nerves is conjoined by a cross Branch with the Sub-occipital Nerve, or with an Arch which con- nects that Nerve and the First Cervical together. The Trunk then descends between the Internal Jugu- Vol. HI. M lar 1

22G COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part VII. crals, the two uppermost are the largest; the rest sud- denly diminish in size, the last being the smallest of the Spinal Nerycs. They go through the Holes in the fore part of the Os Sacrum, and, soon after their exit, are united with each other, and with Branches of the Sympathetic Nerve. The Fjiist, Second, and Third Sacrals, join into a Trunk, which receives the common one sent down from the Fourth and Fifth Lumbars, and forms a Plexus which sends out the Sciatic, the largest Nerve of the Body. The roots of the Sciatic Nerve give origin to the Fas- ciculi which compose the Pudic Nerve, formerly de- scribed, and also the Gluteal Nerves which are dispersed upon the Muscles of the Flips. The Gluteal Nerves run in two Fasciculi, a Supe- rior, arising immediately from the Trunk formed by the last Lumbars, and an Inferior, coming oil’from the two last Lumbars, and first Sacral. The Superior Fasciculus goes through the upper part of the Notch of the Os Ilium, to be dispersed upon the two smaller Glutei. The Inferior Fasciculus passes through the under part of the same Notch, and below the Pyriformis, to be distributed upon the Gluteus Maximus and Integu- ments. The Fourth Sacral sends Filaments to the Plypo- gastric Plexus, others to the Muscles and Ligaments of the Os Coceygis ; the rest pass outwards to the Muscles, and Integuments about the Anus, .

Another Branch is sent from the Second, or from the Second and Third Lumbars, termed Cutaneus Externus, which passes behind the Psoas, and across the Iliacus Interims, to the Superior-anterior Spinous Process of the Os Ilium. It afterwards bends over the outer end of Poupartâ€™s Ligament, and descends in the Anterior and External Part of the Thigh ; dividing into Branch- es, which are chiefly dispersed upon the Integuments covering the Vastus Externus; some Twigs extending as far as the Joint of the Knee. Branches of the Second, Third, and Fourth Lum- bars, form a Nerve of considerable size, called Obturator or Sub-pubial, which passes between the External and Internal Iliac Blood-vessels, and along the side of the Pelvis. The Obturator Nerve accompanies the Blood-ves- sels of the same name through the upper part of the Obturator Muscles and Ligament, and having furnished Branches to the Obturators and Pectineus, it divides into an Anterior and a Posterior Fasciculus; the former dispersed upon the two small Adductors and Gracilis, the latter upon the Adductor Magnus Femoris. The principal parts of the Trunks of the four upper Lumbar Nerves, especially of the Third and Fourth, unite and form a Nerve of great size, termed Crural or Anterior Femoral. The Crural Nerve, after bestowing Branches upon the Iliacus Internus and Psoas, passes behind, then at the outside of the Psoas, to get to the Thigh. In

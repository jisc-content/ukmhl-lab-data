106 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [PartV. Besides the Superior and Inferior Articulating Arte- ries, another branch is frequently found, termed Arti- cularis Media, or Azygos, which is irregular in its ori- gin, arising sometimes from the Trunk of the Poplitea, at other times from one of the Superior Articular Branches. It is situated between the Condyles, and is exhausted upon the Ligaments, Fat, and Bones, at the back part of the Joint •, inosculating with all the ad- joining Branches. The other less constant Articular Branches are dis- persed upon the Muscles a little above the Joint. The Arteria Poplitea, having furnished Branches to the Joint of the Knee, gives others to the Muscles at the upper and back part of the Leg ; two of which, termed Suralcs, more considerable than the rest, pass, by different Branches, into the heads of the Gastroc- nemius Externus. The Trunk of the Artery passes afterwards between the heads of the Gastrocnemius Externus, and com- monly from two to three inches below the bending of the Knee, and at the under and outer edge of the Po- pliteus, or upper end of the Soleus, divides into two large Arteries, the Tibialis Antica, and 7'ibialis Pos- tica. Tibialis Antica.—The Tibialis Antica arises from the fore part of the Poplitea, and passes directly through the upper end of the Interosseous Ligament to the fore part of the Leg. In its descent in the Leg, it adheres closely to the an- terior surface of the Interosseous Ligament; lying at first

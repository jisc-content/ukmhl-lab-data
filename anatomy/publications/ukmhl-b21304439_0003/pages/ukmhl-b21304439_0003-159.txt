147 Part VI.] OF THE ABSORBENTS. From K2 of the Face, accompany the Branches and Trunk of the Facial Artery. Some of them pass through Glands situated upon the outside of the Buccinator, while the principal Trunks go through a number of large Glands placed upon the outer, and also at the under part of the Lower Jaw, at the anterior edge of the Masseter, and about the Infe- rior Maxillary Gland. The Lymphatics from the inner fart of the Nose run principally with the Internal Maxillary Artery, and pass through Glands situated behind the Angle of the Lower Jaw, where they are joined by those which belong to the inner parts of the Mouth. The Lymphatics of the Tongue, and likewise of the Muscles and other parts about the Os Hyoides, enter the Glands placed behind the Angle of the Lower Jaw. Lymphatics have been frequently searched for in the Brain, but their existence in that Organ is not yet fully ascertained ; though rendered highly probable, from an appearance of Lymphatics having been now and then observed upon the Surface of the Dura Ma- ter, and between the Tunica Arachnoides and Pia Ma- ter,from Lymphatics and Glands being occasionally found in, or immediately on the outside of the Pas- sages of the Blood-vessels of the Brain,—from Swell- ings in the Lymphatic Glands of the Neck, following Diseases of the Brain,—from the Absorption of Water, which has sometimes happened in Hydrocephalous Cases, and—from their having been found on the Brains of Fishes.

22 L Part VII.] OF THE NERVES. of the Sympathetic, and of the Tranks and Branches of the Lumbar and Sacral Nerves. The Sympathetic Nerve, after reaching the Abdo- men, makes a sweep forwards upon the anterior and la- teral part of the Lumbar Vertebrae, between the Tendi- nous Crura of the Diaphragm and the Psoas. It afterwards descends into the Pelvis, nearly of the 3ame size as in the superior parts of the Body, and passes over the anterior Surface of the Os Sacrum, at the inner side of the Great Sacral Foramina. Towards the lower part of the Pelvis, it becomes con- siderably smaller, and at last finishes its course upon the Surface of the Os Coccygis, where it unites into an Arch with its Fellow of the opposite side. In the Loins, it forms Ganglia similar to those in the Thorax, each of which is connected behind by two or three long slender Branches to the roots of the Lumbar Nerves, and before, by other slender Nerves, to the Aortic Plexus. In the Pelvis also it forms Ganglia, which are connect- ed to the Sacral Nerves on one side, and to the Great Sympatheticj3n the other, by cross Branches. Filaments are sent off, in the Pelvis, from the Sym- pathetic to the Muscles and Membranes about the Os Coccygis, and to the Intestinum Rectum. Lumbar Nerves. The Five Lumbar Nerves, immediately after emerg- ing from between the Bones, communicate with each o- ther, and are connected with the Sympathetic Nerve by Branches

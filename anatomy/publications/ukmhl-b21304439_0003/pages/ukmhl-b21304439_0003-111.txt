At the top of the Thigh it forms the Inguinal or Common Femoral Artery, so named from its situation, and subsequent division into other Arteries. Here it is covered by the Glands of the Groin, and by the general Aponeurosis and Fat; farther down, it is lodged deep in a hollow at the upper and inner part of the Thigh, with the Rectus and Sartorius upon the outer, and the Adductor Femoris upon die inner side of it. From this part it descends at the inside of the Thigh, turning gradually backwards till it reaches the Ham. From the Inguinal or Common Femoral Artery, a few small Branches are sent off to the Skin of the Ab- domen, to the Superficial Muscles and Inguinal Glands, and to the common Integuments at the upper part of the Thigh ; also one or two others, termed Pudicce Ex- terncc, to the Pubes and the Integuments of the Exter- nal Parts of Generation and inside of the Thigh in both Sexes. About two inches below the Ligament of Poupart, though sometimes considerably lower, and in some rare cases directly under this Ligament, the Common Femo- ral Artery divides, somewhat iike the Common Iliac, into anterior and posterior parts :â€”The former is the Femoral Artery strictly so called, the latter is termed Profunda Femoris.

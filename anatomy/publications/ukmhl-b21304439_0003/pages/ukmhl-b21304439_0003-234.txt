222 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part VII Branches which run over the sides of the Vertebrae, and send large Branches backwards to the Muscles and In- teguments on the posterior part of the Loins. By their connections with each other, they compose a Plexus termed Lumbar, which is situated behind the Psoas, and sends Branches outwards to the Quadratus Lumborum, and to the Flexors of the Thigh. The First Lumbar Nerve is connected by a small Branch to the Twelfth Dorsal, and by its Trunk to the Sccpnd Lumbar. After giving Twigs to the Muscles of the Loins, it detaches a principal Branch, which passes over the Quadratus Lumborum towards the Spine of the Os Ilium, where it sends Branches to the Integuments of the Pelvis, to the upper and outer part of the Thigh, to the under end of the Abdominal Muscles, to the In- teguments of the Groin, and to the Pubes and Scrotum. The Second Lumbar perforates the Psoas, to which it gives Branches, and afterwards runs into the Third. From the Second Lumbar, and partly also from the First, the Spennaticus Extenius is sent off, which perfo- rates the upper end of the Psoas, and descends near the Spermatic Vessels to the under part of the Abdo- men. Near Poupartâ€™s Ligament, and sometimes much higher, it splits into two Branches: One goes through the Abdominal Ring, to be dispersed upon the Pubes, Spermatic Cord, Scrotum, and Testis, in the Male; and upon the Round Ligament, the Uterus, the Mons Veneris, and Labia Externa, in the Female. The other Branch passes out with the Femoral Ves- sels,

26 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY; [Part Vi Bone. While in the Canal, it passes upwards and for- wards like the Canal itself, and is surrounded by a con- siderable quantity of Cellular Substance, and by the Dura Mater, which form a Cushion between it and the Bone. After leaving the Canal, it again bends upwards and then forwards, by the side of the Sella Turcica, and here it is situated within the Cavernous Sinus; and perforating the Dura Mater, at the root of the Ante- rior Clinoid Process, it is suddenly reflected obliquely backwards and upwards j after which it divides into Branches. Through the whole of its course, it runs in a Serpen- tine manner, which prevents the Blood in it from rush- ing too quickly and forcibly upon the tender Substance of the Brain, and, contrary to the nature of other Ar- teries, it is of a Conical form, though it does not send off any Branches till it enters the Cranium. While at the side of the Sella Turcica, it furnishes small Twigs to the Dura Mater and parts adjacent, as— a Branch which passes through the Pars Petrosa to the Tympanum,—a Branch termed Posterior,—and another termed Anterior Artery of the Cavernous Sinus, to the Dura Mater, GJandula Pituitaria, and Nerves at the side of it. As soon as the Carotid perforates the Dura Mater, at the root of the Clinoid Process, it transmits The Arteria Ophthalmica, which is the principal Artery belonging to the Eye and its Appendages. The Ophthalmic, or Ocular Artery, immediately after it comes off from the Carotid, enters the Foramen Op- ticura,

196 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part VII. down, it gives others to the Integuments and Coats of the Blood-vessels. About the middle of the Arm, it splits into two Branches,â€”an Internal and External. The Internal Branch, which is rather the smaller of the two, passes before the Basilic Vein to the inner part of the Elbow, where it divides into Branches ; two of which, larger than the rest, turn obliquely over the Heads of the Flexors of the Hand, to be dispersed upon the inner and back part of the Fore Arm. The External Branch divides into several others, behind the Median Basilic Vein, which descend on the Anterior and Ulnar side of the Fore Arm, as far as the Wrist. They pass partly over and partly under the Subcuta- neous Vessels ; furnishing Twigs to these, and vanish- ing in the Integuments. Besides the Nervus Cutaneus, there is another, term- ed Cutancns Minor Interims of Wrjsberg, which, like the rest of the Nerves of the Superior Extremity, takes its origin from the Axillary Plexus ; but is more parti- cularly connected with the Ulnar Nerve. It is consider- ably smaller than the Nervus Cutaneus. It soon separates from the Ulnar, running afterward* between it and the inner side of the Arm. A little below the Axilla, it splits into two Branches: The smaller, turning to the posterior part of the Arm, is divided into Filaments, which are chiefly dispersed upon the Triceps and its Integuments: The larger Branch descends at the inner edge of the Triceps,

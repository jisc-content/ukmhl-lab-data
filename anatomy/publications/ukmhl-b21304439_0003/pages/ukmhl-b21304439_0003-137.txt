This is seen about the size of the Crystalline Lens, some- times on the back, at other times on the fore side of the Thorax. They arc of a round or oval form, and frequently a little flattened ; and are of different sizes, from that of a Millet-seed to that of a Substance near an inch in dia- meter ; sometimes several are collected into one Mass. Their colour also varies in different parts of the Body, and at different times of life. In young Subjects, they are generally largest, and of a reddish or brown colour, but become smaller and paler with increasing age â€¢, and immediately under the Skin, they are redder and firmer than within the large Ca- vities. In the Mesentery, they are of a pale colour ; about the Bronchi, they are almost black. They have a smooth, dense, Membranous Covering, which gives them a shining appearance, and are con- nected to the surrounding parts by loose Cellular Sub- stance. Their Coat is connected to the Glandular part by a Cellular Membrane, which, according to Dr Haller, is pervaded by a Succus Prtyprius full of Globules, which, Mr FIewson supposed, afterwards form the red Glo- bules of the Blood.

loi COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part VII. The Medullary Substance of the Fibrillse is Pulpy and tender, but rendered thicker and stronger by the coverings they receive from the Tunica Arachnoidea and Pia Mater while within the Bones, and more parti- cularly by the additional covering given them by the Dura Mater upon their exit. The Dura Mater, in its passage through the Base of the Cranium, and between the different Vertebrae, is connected by its External Surface to the Pericranium and Periosteum \ while the inner part of it, together with the Tunica Arachnoidea and Pia Mater, is conti- nued along the Nerves. The Involucray or Coverings, inclose each of the Nerves in general, and likewise the several FibrilliE of which they are composed, whereby their size, as well as strength, is greatly increased. The Nerves, soon after leaving the Bones, have the Dura Mater so intimately connected with them, that it has been considered, by some Authors, as degenerating into condensed Cellular Substance, notwithstanding it still retains the general appearance of the Dura Mater. Upon examining the Nerves, especially the small ones, in a living or recently dead Animal, they are observed to have numerous White Lines placed transversely, or in a serpentine direction.â€”Obs. on Nerv. Syst. When the Nerves are moderately stretched, this ap- pearance becomes less evident j and when extended considerably, or when macerated in water, it vanishes entirely. Prochaska (De Came Musctdari) supposes these serpentine Lines to be owing to a decussation of Ves- sels

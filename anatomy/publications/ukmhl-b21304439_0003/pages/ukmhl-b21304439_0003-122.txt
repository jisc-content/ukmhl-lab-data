110 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part V. The Foot, anastomosing with the External Malleolar and Tarsal Branches of the Tibialis Antica. The Tibialis Postica, properly so called, passes down at the back-part of the Tibia, and runs over the Tibialis Posticus and Flexor Digitorum, and under the Gastrocnemius Interims, in its descent through the Leg. At the under part of the Leg it becomes more super- ficial, running between the Tendo Achillis and Malleo- lus Interims ; having the Tibialis Posticus and Flexor Digitorum Longus on the inner, and the Flexor Lon- gus Pollicis on the outer side of it. From the Ankle, it runs in the Hollow of the Os Cal- cis, and behind the Abductor Pollicis, to the Sole of the Foot. Its Branches supply the Muscles at the back and in- ner part of the Leg, and the different parts of the Sole j forming many Inosculations with the Branches of the Anterior Tibial, and the Fibular Artery. In its course along the Leg, it gives offâ€” Numerous Branches, similar to those of the Tibialis Antica, to the surrounding Muscles: The Arteria Nutritia Tibia:, which begins a little be- low the upper end of the Trunk, descends for someway in the Leg, and gives Branches to the deep Muscles and Membranes near it, and one Branch, termed Arteria Medullaris, which enters the Hole near the middle of the Bone: Several Branches to the parts behind, and at the in- ner side of the Ankle and Heel, which communicate with others of the Anterior Tibial Artery.

30 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [PartV. The Branches of the Venee Hepatic® afterwards unite into large Trunks, which recede from the Hepatic "Artery and Vena Port®, and terminate in the Inferior Cava. Their termination in the Cava is by two, and fre- quently by three Trunks, at the place where it perfo- rates the Diaphragm ; but commonly below this, a few small Hepatic Branches go into the Cava, where it is situated behind the Liver.

It commonly comes off by one large Trunk, though frequently by two, and sometimes morej in which case, each of these is smaller than when the Artery is single. It runs across the Spine and Psoas Muscle, nearly in a transverse direction, descending, however, a little in its course towards the Kidney. The Artery of the right side goes behind the Vena Cava, and is longer than the left, in consequence of the Cava being situated between the Aorta and the Right Kidney. At the concave edge of the Kidney, the Artery di- vides into three or four Branches, which vary in length in

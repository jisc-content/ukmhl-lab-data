83 Part V.] OF THE BLOOD-VESSELS. To the Peritoneum and Cellular Substance near it; —and, To the Ureters,—which are also supplied with other Arteries from the adjacent Vessels, viz. from the Renal and Capsular Arteries, from the Aorta, lliacee, and Ve- sicales. The Vena Spermatica is much larger than its cor- responding Artery, and is furnished with Valves within, but more particularly without the Abdomen. It forms a Plexus which accompanies the A rtery, and about the place where it recedes from it, which is near- ly opposite to the under end of the Kidney ; it forms a single Trunk, which in the right side goes into the Cava a little below the Emulgent Vein, and in the left into the corresponding Vena Renalis. Besides the Artery commonly called Spermatic, the Testicle generally receives a smaller Branch from the Hypogastric, and frequently also a minute Brandi from the Epigastric, which accompany the Vas Deferens to the body of the Testicle, upon which they are dispers- ed, communicating there with the Branches of the Sper- matic Artery. The Veins proper to these Arteries terminate in the Hypogastric and Epigastric Veins. The Spermatic Artery, in the Female, has the same kind of Origin, and the same course through the Abdo- men, as in the Male, but is frequently more tortuous ; especially during pregnancy, where it also increases in size in proportion to the size of the Uterus. In place of perforating the Abdominal Ring, as it does in the Male, it descends into the Pelvis, between the Lamina F 2 of'

They have likewise some communications with deep Brandies of these two Nerves, which pass outwards be- tween the Massetcr and Buccinator : The Inferior Facial Branches, which proceed along the side ot the Under Jaw, to be dispersed upon the parts covering it, and upon the Under Lip ; and connect themselves with some of the Middle Facial Branches, and with others belonging to the third part of the Fifth Pair: The Descending, or Subculancous Cervical Branchesy some of which run forwards under the Lower Jaw, and others downwards, near the External Jugular Vein, to the Superficial Muscles, and to the Integuments at the side and upper part of the Neck, where they form communications with the Inferior Facial Branches, and with different Branches of the Upper Spinal Cervical Nerves. The Eighth Pair arises from the Medulla Oblon- gata, at the sides of the Bases of the Corpora Olivaria, and consist, in each side, of the Nervus Glosso-Pha- ryngeus and Pars Vaga. The Gi.osso-Pharyngeus is the smaller of the two, being only a little larger than one of the Nerves of the Fourth Pair. The Pars Vaga comes ofF immediately under the former, and is composed of several separated Fasciculi, which are soon collected into a single Cord. The two Nerves, passing outwards, go through the Base 'A

182 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part VIL The different Filaments unite by degrees into then- respective Trunks, and often have connections while within the Dura Mater with one or two of the Bundles of the uppermost Spinal Nerves. The Trunk of the Nerve passes out, in each side of the Cranium, in company with the Nerve of the Eighth Pair; but forms no part of that Nerve, being included in its own peculiar Sheath received from the Dura Mater. After perforating the Cranium, it separates from the Eighth, and descends obliquely outwards through the Sterno-Mastoidcus to the Shoulder. At its exit, it sends off a Branch, termed by some Ramus Minor, (the Trunk itself being then called Ra- mus Major), which assists in forming the Pharyngeal Nerve *, and gives another, smaller than the former, to be connected to the Pars Vaga of the Eighth Pair. At the fore part of the Sterno-Mastoideus, it is joined by an Arch to the Sub-occipital, and frequently by an- other to the First Cervical Nerve. In its passage through the Sterno-Mastoideus, it sends several Branches to Substance of .that Muscle, and terminates at length in the Trapezius. SPINAL

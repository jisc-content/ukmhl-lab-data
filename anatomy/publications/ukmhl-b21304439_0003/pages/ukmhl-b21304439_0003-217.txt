Part VII.] OF THE NERVES. 205 NERVES l WITHIN THE THORAX. The Nerves, in each side of the Thorax, consist of tthe Phrenic, the Pars Vaga of the Eighth Pair, the {.Great Sympathetic, and the Intercostals; all of which are concealed by the Pleura, till they are exposed by IDissection. The Phrenic, or Diaphragmatic Nerve, has a -small Filament from the second Cervical; but is chiefly formed by a Branch from the Third, and by one, and ■sometimes by two, from the Fourth Cervical Nerve. It descends in the Neck, along the outer and fore part of the Scalenus Anticus, and enters the Thorax Ibehind the anterior extremity of the First Rib, between tthe Subclavian Artery and corresponding Vein. In the Thorax, it passes over the root of the Lungs, and then proceeds along the Pericardium, to which it ^adheres closely in its way to the Diaphragm. The Right Phrenic has nearly a straight direction op- posite to the Superior Cava and Right Auricle; while tthe left makes a considerable Curve near its under end, ■corresponding with that part of the Pericardium which covers the Point of the Heart. Upon the Surface of the Diaphragm, the Trunk is divided

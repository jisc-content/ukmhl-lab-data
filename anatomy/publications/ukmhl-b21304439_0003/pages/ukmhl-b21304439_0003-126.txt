114. COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part V. frequent Anastomoses with each other, and are of con- siderable size. In its ascent, it is joined by Branches from the super- ficial parts of the Leg, and some way below the Knee, is frequently split into a Plexus. It receives Branches from the superficial parts of the Thigh, and small Twigs from the Inguinal Glands. It terminates in the top of the Femoral Vein, nearly opposite to, or a little higher than, the origin of the Ar- teria Profunda. The Saph.*na Minor arises upon the outer side of the Foot, and afterwards passes behind the Malleolus Externus. From this it ascends, in the back part of the Leg, upon the surface of the Gastrocnemius Externus, and goes into the Hum. It is formed by the Veins of the upper and outer part of the Foot, and is joined to the Saphaena Major, over the Metatarsal Bcius, by one or more Arches, which receive a Plexus of Branches into their lower or convex part. It is joined by the Superficial Veins of the outer and back part of the Leg, which have frequent Anastomoses with each other, and with the Branches of the Saphaena Major. It terminates in the Vena Poplitea, and, a little above the Knee, communicates constantly by a small Branch with the Saphaena Major. Deep Veins.—The Deep Veins of the Leg, like those of the Fore-arm, run ’close at each side of their Arteries, and are double their number, but difler a little from

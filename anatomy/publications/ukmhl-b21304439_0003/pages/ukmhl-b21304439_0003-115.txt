Fart V.] OF THE BLOOD-VESSELS. 103 perforating Branches, which are greatly inferior in size to the two former, and are lost upon the Flexors at the under and back part of the Thigh ; one Twig sent off from these sometimes forming a Nutrilia or Medullaris of the Os Fern oris. The Femoral Artery, after giving off the Profunda Femoris, passes down, still covered by the Fascia of the Thigh, between the Vastus Interims and insertion of the Triceps, giving only small Branches to the Muscles and Integuments at the fore and inner side of the Thigh. One Branch, termed Ramus Anastomoticus Magnus, more conspicuous than the rest, is sent off previous to the passage of the Artery through the Tendon of the Triceps. It descends with many Ramifications upon the Vastus Internus, upon which it is chiefly dispersed; inosculating with the Descending Branch of the Cir- cumflexa Externa, and below, with Branches about the Knee. About the middle of the inside of the Thigh, the Trunk of the Artery is situated behind the Sartorius; and, nearly two-thirds down upon the Os Femoris, it perforates the Triceps passing between that Muscle and the Bone, in its way to the Leg. Having perforated the Triceps, it is found in the back part of the Thigh, where it sends Rami Perforantes to the adjacent Muscles and Integuments. Of the Rami Perforantes two are more constant and ■considerable than the rest, and called by some Authors Perforans Superior, and Perforans Inferior ; the former distributed to the Muscles at the back and inner, awd the latter, after sending off the Principal Medullaris, .

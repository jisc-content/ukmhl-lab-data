164 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part VII. and by another from the Third Pair, and is commonly the smallest in the Body. It is of an oblong form, and compressed ; is situated at the outside of the Optic Nerve, a little before the Fo- ramen Opticnm, and is concealed in Fat. Sometimes, though rarely, the Filaments which form it take their origin entirely from the Third Pair. From the Ganglion, about a dozen of Filaments a- rise, termed Ciliary Nerves, collected into two portions, which creep along the opposite sides of the Optic Nerve, separated a little from each other, and running in com- pany with the Ciliary Arteries. Besides the Ciliary Nerves from the Ganglion, one, and sometimes two Filaments arise from the Ramus Na- salis, and pass along with the other Ciliary Branches. The Ciliary Nerves, running with scarcely any divi- sion, reach the back part of the Eye, and, a little be- fore the insertion of the Optic Nerve, enter the Sclerotic Coat, pass obliquely through it, and, about the middle of the Ball, appear upon the Surface of the Tunica Choroides. Upon this Coat they are flat, and run in a parallel di- rection, sending very few evident Branches, either to it or to each other, till they reach the Ciliary Circle, where they divide into numerous minute Filaments. Upon the Choroides, five or six are larger than the rest; the others are so minute as almost to escape the naked Eye. . , At the Ciliary Circle, each commonly divides intq two Branches, which are covered by the Cellular Sub- stance of the Circle ; and these, at the root of the Iris, are

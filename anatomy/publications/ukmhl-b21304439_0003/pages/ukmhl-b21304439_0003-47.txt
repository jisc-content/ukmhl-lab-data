It runs by the sides of the Sella Turcica, sends mi- nute Threads to the Crura Cerebri, to the Corpora Albicantia, Optic Nerves, and Infundibulum, and con- tributes to the formation of the Circle of Willis,—or that kind .of communication by which the Blood or In- jected Matter can pass readily across from one Internal Carotid to the other,—or from these backwards to the Basilar Artery. The Circle of Willis incloses the Optic Nerves, the Infundibulum, and the Corpora Albicantia, and is of an irregular figure, the sides varying in length, not only in different Subjects, but in the different sides of the same Body. Veins of the Head and Part of the Neck. The Veins which return the Blood from the Arteries of the Head and part of the Neck, unite into the fol- lowing Trunks, viz. C 2 The

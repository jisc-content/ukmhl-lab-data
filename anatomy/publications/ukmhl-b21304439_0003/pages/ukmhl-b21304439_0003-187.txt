i J Part VII.] OF THE NERVES. 1** Â£ Base of the Cranium, immediately before the end of the Lateral Sinus, by the Hole common to the Occipi- tal and Temporal Bone, and are separated from each other and from the Sinus by small Processes of the Dura Mater. The Glosso-PJiajyngeus, termed also Lingualis Late- ralis, from its exit upon the Cranium, sends a Branch backwards, which joins the Digastric Branch of the Portio Dura. A little lower, it gives off Branches, which, with others from tire Pharyngeal Branch of the Eighth Pair, and from the Great Sympathetic Nerve, form a Plexus which embraces the Internal Carotid Artery, and after- wards sends Branches along the Caroticus Communis to the Heart. I Still lower, it gives Branches which communicate with others belonging to the Pharyngeal Nerve, and go to the upper part of the Pharynx, and to the Stylo- Pharyngeus. The Glosso-Pharyngeus, after sending a Twig or two to the Tonsil, to the upper part of the Pharynx, and Membrane of the Epiglottis, divides into many Branches, which run partly to the Margin, and partly to the middle of the root of the Tongue, supplying, especially, the Papillce Majores, and the parts in their neighbourhood. The Pars Vaga, or Pneumo-Gastric JServe, upon emerging from the Cranium, frequently becomes a little increased in diameter for about an inch downwards, forming w hat some Authors have termed its Gangliform Enlargement. It descends in the Neck at the outer and back part of the

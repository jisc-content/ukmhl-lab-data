21 Part VJ OF THE BLOOD-VESSELS. The Auricular Artery passes afterwards behind the Ear, gives Branches to the Integuments, Muscles, and Bones there, and, creeping upon the back part of the Concha, sends Twigs to it, and terminates upon the side of the Head. • . . • f. * . ^ * * The Occipital Artery gives next a Branch, of consi- derable size, which descends between the Trachelo-Mas- toideus and Comjplexus, and afterwards gives Branches to most of the Muscles on this part of the Neck. The Trunk of the Artery afterwards ascends in a ser- i . , pentine manner upon the Occiput, dividing into several Branches, which are dispersed upon the Integuments and Occipito-Frontalis, communicating with the Occi- pital Artery of the opposite side, one Twig passing oc- casionally through the Foramen Mastoideum to the Dura Mater. ' » The Arteria Maxillaris Interna, which goes off from that part of the Trunk which is covered by the Pa- rotid Gland, and at its Origin lies behind the middle of the upright Plate which divides into the Condyloid and Coronoid Processes of the Lower Jaw, It passes first between the Jaw and Pterygoideus Ex- ternus, and aftenvards ascends, in a tortuous manner, towards the back part of the Antrum Maxillare, send- ing numerous Branches to, the parts belonging to both Jaws. At its Origin, it furnishes Twigs to the fore-side and adjacent parts of the Outer Ear : It then sends off the Arteria Dares Matris Media Maxima, Meningea Media, vel Spheno-Spinalis, which mns between the External and Internal Carotids, passes B 3 through

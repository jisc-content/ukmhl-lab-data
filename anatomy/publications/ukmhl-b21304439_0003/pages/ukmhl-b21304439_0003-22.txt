10 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part V. with the collective Area of their Branches, like them, too, they are perceived to he Conical; the Base of the Cone being formed by the Branches, and the Apex by the Trunks. The size and number of the Veins is so much greater than that of their corresponding Arteries, that when the Vessels of a Membranous Part are distended by an In- jection of different colours, the Veins are observed in a great measure to conceal the Arteries: In the Intestines, however, the number of the Arteries and Veins is near- ly equal. There is much greater variety among the Trunks of Veins, with respect to Situation and Division into Branches, than is observable among the Arteries. The variety in Nature, in this respect, is such, that the Veins of every Subject differ a little from those of another. , , The Veins are capable of suffering greater distension than the Arteries, yet are more frequently ruptured. The Anastomoses are greater and more frequent in Veins than in Arteries ; those of the former being often by large Trunks, whereas those of the latter, excepting in a few places, are by small Branches only. Where the Veins are exposed to Muscular action, theyare furnished with Valves, which are Semilunar Folds continued from the inner side of the Vessels, and placed in Pairs at irregular distances. The Valves are Concave towards the Heart, and, when closed or applied to each other, represent a figure Somewhat like that of the shut end of a Thimble. Between the Valves and sides of the Veins next the Heart,

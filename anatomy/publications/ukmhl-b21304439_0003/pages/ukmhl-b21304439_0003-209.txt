1-97 Part VII.] OF THE NERVES. Triceps, and vanishes upon the under end of that Mus- cle and Skin of the Elbow: The Musculo-Cutaneus, called also Pciforans Ca- serii, which consists of Fibrilloe from almost all the Nerves entering the Plexus. The Cord formed by these perforates, obliquely, the upper part of the Coraco-Brachialis, to which it gives Branches. It afterwards passes between the Biceps and Brachialis Internus, furnishing Branches to both. At the Elbow, it gets to the outside of the Tendon of the Biceps, and runs behind the Median Cephalic Vein. From thence it descends in the Fore Arm, between the Supinator Longus and Integuments; furnishing Branches to the latter, as far as the Root of the Thumb and back of the Hand : The Spiral, or Spiral-Muscular Nerve, which is apparently formed by all the Nerves entering into the Axillary Plexus, and when the Sheaths of the Nerves are slit open, is found to be composed of Fibriliae from each of the Trunks, excepting from that of the First Dorsal. It is rather larger than any other Nerve of the Supe- rior Extremity, and is distinguished by its Spiral di- rection. It is at first situated between the Axillary Artery and the Ulnar Nerve, and passes obliquely downwards be- tween two of the Heads of the Triceps Extensor Cubit), and afterwards behind the Os Humeri to the outside of the Elbow.

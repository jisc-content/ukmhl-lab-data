163 Pajit VII.] OF THE NERVES. The Nasal Branch, which runs obliquely over the Optic Nerve, where it detaches a Filament or two to the Eye, then under the Levator Palpebrae et Oculi; and, getting between the Abductor Oculi and Troch- learis, passes to the inside of the Orbit. It sends a Branch, which, after entering the Foramen Orbitarium Internum Airterius, re-enters the Cavity of the Cranium, and gets upon the Cribriform Plate of the Ethmoid Bone. From thence it passes down through one of the ante- rior Holes of tin's Plate, and sends Twigs to the Mem- brane at the anterior part of the Nostril, while the Nerve, descending at the fore part of the Septum Na- rium, is dispersed upon the Point and Wing of the Nose. The continuation of the Nasal Branch, now called Infra-Trochlearis, passes forwards to the inner Corner of the Eye, and is distributed upon the Lacrymal Sac and parts adjacent: The Lacn/mal Branchy which runs along the Abduc- tor Oculi, sends Twigs to the Membranes and Fat near ft, likewise one or two through the Substance of the Cheek-bone, and one in particular to the Substance of the Lacrymal Gland, while another passes over the Gland, and vanishes in the neighbouring parts : A Branch to the Ophthalmic Ganglion, which is sometimes sent off from the Nasal, at oilier times from the Ophthalmic Trunk. The Ophthalmic Ganglion, termed also lenticular, from its shape, is formed by this Branch from the Fifth, , Qua Â£) f sy\j

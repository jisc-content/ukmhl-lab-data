60 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [PautV. is the variety among them, that they arc scarcely found to apree exactly in any two Subjects. Frequently tlie Cephalic is almost entirely formed by the Medianu Cephalica, or the Basilic by the Medians Basilica. Sometimes the Medians Longa Minor goes into the Median Basilic. There are often more than two short Median Veins ;â€”and sometimes, instead of a Mediana Major and Minor, there is an irregular Plexus, but constantly a communication i& found, of the Veins on the Radial and L inar sides of the Anterior pari of the Fore Ann, and also a communication be- tween the superficial and deep Trunks at the bending of the Elbow. The Basilica, in its ascent, forms the principal Hu- meral Vein, which passes along the side of the Os Hu- meri, a little to the inside of the Humeral Artery ; and receiving Branches from the corresponding side of the Arm, and communicating with the deep Veins, it runs into the Arm-pit, and forms the Vena Axillaris. The Cephalica ascends at the outside of the Bi- ceps, receives Branches from the adjacent parts of the Ann, and communicates in several places with the Ba- silica ; and, passing in the Groove between the Pectora- lis Major and the Dcltoides, terminates in the Axillary Vein. The Deep Veins, termed also Vena: Satellites, or Conn comites, run close by the sides of their respective Arte- ries, one lying commonly on each side of the Artery, and receiving the Blood from the adjacent parts. In various places they anastomose with each other by short Branches, which cross over the Arteries. Near

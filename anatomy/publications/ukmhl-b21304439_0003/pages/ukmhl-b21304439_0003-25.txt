I Part V.] OF THE BLOOD-VESSEL^ is two from the Right, and two from the Left Lung,â€” which, after perforating the Pericardium, terminate in the Left Auricle of the Heart, at its upper and lateral parts ; of these Trunks one is Superior, and the other Inferior, on each side. The Superior passes before the corresponding Artery, the Inferior behind the Branches of the Trachea. The Trunks of the Veins of the Right Side, like their Artery, are longer than those of thr Left. General Course of the Aorta and Vena Cava. The Aorta arises behind the Pulmonary Artery, from the upper and back part of the Left Ventricle of the Heart, opposite the third Vertebra of the Thorax, and sends off, at its Origin, the Coronary Arteries formerly described. Where it takes its Origin, it turns a little to the right, and is afterwards directed upwards, backwards, and towards the left side. It ascends as far as the top of the second Dorsal Ver- tebra, under the name of Aorta Ascendens, and is after- wards reflected obliquely backwards over the root of the left Branch of the Trachea, till it reaches the third Vertebra of the Back, forming what is termed Curva- ture or Arch of the Aorta. It then commences Aorta Descendens, which runs down close upon the Spine, till it reaches the Fourth Vertebra of the Loins, where it divides into the Two Iliac Arteries. The Thoracic portion of the Aorta Descendens is si- tuated

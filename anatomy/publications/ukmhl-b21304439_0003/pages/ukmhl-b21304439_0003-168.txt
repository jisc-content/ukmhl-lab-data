156 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part VII. The Branches generally go off at acute angles; but in several places they have a retrograde direction. They have commonly the same kind of distribution in the opposite sides of the same Subject, and vary little in this respect in different Subject^. In some parts of the Body, several Nerves unite to- gether, and form a Plexus; in others, they unite into a Common Trunk ; and in many, by such an union, a hard Knot, termed Ganglion, is formed. When the Plexuses or the Common Trunks arc mi- nutely examined by slitting open their Coverings, it is found, that their Fibrillae are intermixed in such a manner, that each of the Nerves passing out from the Plexus, or from the Common Trunk, is composed of Fibrillae from several, or from all the Nerves which en- tered it, in consequence of which, the Organs in ge- neral are furnished with Nerves from various sources.— Obs. on Ncrv. Syst. The Ganglia differ from each other in size and figure: They have thicker Coats, and are more Vascular than the Nerves ; and are larger than the whole of the Nerves, taken conjunctly, which enter into or go out from them.—They are supposed to serve as fresh sources of Nervous Influence. They are composed of Nervous Fibrillae, covered by something like a Cineritious Matter, and are so divided, multiplied, and intermixed, that each ot the Nerves passing out from a Ganglion is found to be composed of Fibrillae derived from the greater part of the Nerves which enter it.—Obs. on Nerv. Syst. Where Nerves pass out from the side of a Ganglion, they %

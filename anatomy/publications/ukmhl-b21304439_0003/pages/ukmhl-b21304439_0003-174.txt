162 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [PautVIF. The nous Sinus, concealed by a Doubling of the Dura Mater, and forms a Ganglion sometimes called Gasserian. The Ganglion is of a Semilunar form, and placed transversely with respect to the Trunk of the Nerve. From the opposite and curved edge of the Ganglion, three large Branches come out •, the first and anterior, termed Ophthalmic,—the second and middle, the Supe- rior Maxillary,—and the third and posterior, the Infe- rior Maxillary. The First Branch of the Fifth Pair, at the side of the Sella Turcica, is situated lower than the Third Pair, and afterwards crosses over it, being previously connected by Nervous Matter to the Trunk of the Fourth Pair. It goes through the Foramen Lacerum into the Orbit, and is there divided into the following Branches, viz. The Supra-Orhitar, which is the largest of the whole, being a continuation of the Ophthalmic. It passes immediately under the Membrane which lines the upper part of the Orbit, and splits into two Branches of unequal size. The smaller Branch, termed Supra-Trochlearis, runs under the Superciliary Ridge to the Upper Eye-lid and Fore-head. The larger passes through the Foramen Supra-Orbi- tarium,—or over the Superciliary Ridge when the Fo- ramen is wanting,—sends Branches to the Upper Eye- lid, and divides into several others, which run back, partly above, but chiefly under the Frontalis, to supply the fore and upper part of the Head in general, while minute Fibres appear to penetrate the Bones :

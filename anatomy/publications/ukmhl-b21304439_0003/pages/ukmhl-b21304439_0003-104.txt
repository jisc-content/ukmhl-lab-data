92 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [PartV. ternus, communicating there with the Lumbar Arteries and Circumflex Branches of the Ilium -a particular Twig, constituting an Artcria Nutritia, or Medullar is of the Os Ilium. SacrjE Laterales.—There are generally two, but sometimes three, arising from the common Trunk, or the Ilio- Lumbar, or frequently from the Gluteal Ar- tery. Sometimes there is only a single Artery, which descends by the sides of the Sacral Holes, giving Branches, which supply the place of the Same Late- rals, and sometimes also, though seldom, of the Sacra Media. They furnish Branches to the Muscles, Membranes, and Nerves, on the surface of the Os Sacrum, and in- osculate by cross Branches with the Sacra Media. Their principal Trunks enter the Anterior Sacral Holes, to be distributed upon the Cauda Equina, and the Membranes and Bones inclosing it. Arteria Geutea.—This is sometimes termed lliaca Posterior, and is the largest Branch of the Hypogastric Artery. Soon after it arises, it passes between the two Trunks or Heads of the Sciatic Nerve, goes afterwards through the upper part of the great Notch of the Os Ilium, and is reflected over the edge of the Bone, after the manner of the Inferior Scapulary Artery. Upon emerging from the Cavity of the Pelvis, and after giving Twigs to the Iliacus Internus, and Pyrifor- mis, it is divided into two great Branches; one more superficial, the other deep seated. The

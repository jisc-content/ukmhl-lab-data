Part VII.] OF THE NERVES. 203 The Superficial Palmar Nerve sends— Branches to the short Muscles of the Little Finger: A Branch to the Volar-Ulnar side of the Little Fai- rer : and— Another, which is soon split into two smaller Branch- es; one to the Radial side of the Little Finger, the other to the Ulnar side of the Ring Finger. The Deep Palmar Nerve sinks in between the Abduc- tor and Flexor Parvus Digiti Minimi, or perforates the 'Head of the latter, and forms an Arch which accompa- nies the Deep Arch of the Arteries, under the Tendons jjf the Flexors, and the Lumbricales. The Deep Nerve gives— A Branch to the Abductor Minimi Digiti, and one :.o each of the Interossei: A Twig to each of the Lumbricales, which enters from behind: Branches to the Flexor Brevis and Adductor Pollicis. The Nerve terminates at length by several short IBranches upon the Abductor lndicis. The Nerves on the Palm and corresponding part of the Fingers, like the Arteries, are much larger than those of the opposite side of the Hand. The Digital Nerves send off many lateral Branches i o the Integuments and other parts of the Fingers, and xerminate, each, by a Brush of Fibres, at the Apices if the Fingers. i Between the Branches of the Radial and Ulnar Nerves, different Anastomoses are frequently found; and the same maj be observed between the Nerves of •the Palmar and Dorsal sides of the Fingers.

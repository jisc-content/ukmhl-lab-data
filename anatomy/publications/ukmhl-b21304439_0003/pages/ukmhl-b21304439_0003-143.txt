Part VI.] OF THE ABSORBENTS. 1S1 I 2 The % The Superficial Lymphatics of the under part of the Ab- domen, those of the Loins, Nates, and Verge of the Anus, pass into the Inguinal Glands ; each set terminating in such of the Glands as lie nearest the parts to which the Vessels belong. The Inguinal Glands, having received the Lympha- tics of the Inferior Extremity, and likewise the Super- ficial Lymphatics of the external Parts of Generation, send out Trunks fewer in number, but considerably larger than those which enter the Glands. The Vasa Efferentia of the Inguinal Glands enter the Abdomen under Pgupart’s Ligament, in company with the Inguinal Artery and Vein. Some of them go into the Glands situated about the Iliac or the Lumbar Blood-vessels. The Illiac Glands are frequently almost as numerous as the Glands of the Groin, and one of them is generally found larger than the rest* and placed at the inner edge of Po opart’s Ligament. The Lumbar Glands are more numerous than any of the classes already described, and are placed over the Abdominal Aorta, Inferior Cava, and Bodies of the Lumbar Vertebrae. The rest of the Lymphatics from the lower Extre- ty descend at the side of the Pelvis, near the Internal Iliac Blood-vessels, and pass through some of the Glands which are situated there. The last-mentioned Lymphatics are joined by Absor- bezits from the Viscera of the Pelvis in general, especial- ly by those of the Bladder and Vesiculce Seminales in the Male, and by a portion of those of the Uterus and of the Vagina in the Female.

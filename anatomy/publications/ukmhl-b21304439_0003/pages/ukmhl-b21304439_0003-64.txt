52 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [PartV. The Profunda Inferior, or Minor. This Artery is frequently a Branch of the Profunda Superior, but more commonly an original Branch sent off from the Trunk of the Artery, near the middle of the Arm. It gives Branches to the Muscles and other parts at the inside of the Arm, and terminates about the inner part of the Os Humeri. The Ramu6 Anastomoticus Magnus, which comes off a little above the Elbow, and bestows Branches to the Brachialis Interims, to the under end of the Tri- ceps, and to the Muscles, Ligaments, and parts in ge- neral about the Elbow-Joint. The Ramus Anastomo- ticus is variable both in its origin and distribution ; fre- quently instead of one there are two, or even three A- nastomosing Arteries at this part of the Arm. The smaller Branches sent from the Humeral Artery, pass in succession from the Trunk to the Muscles and other parts adjacent. They are shorter than the rest, and run more in a transverse direction, especially those to the Biceps. One small Branch, termed Nutritia, or MedullariSy goes into the Substance of the Bone by the passage near its middle, and supplies the Marrow, and parts which contain it; though this Branch is some- times sent off from some of the Brunches in the neigh- bourhood. The Trunk of the Humeral Artery, having sent off the different Branches which belong to the Arm, passes to the middle of theâ€˜bending of the Elbow, between the Aponeurosis and Round Tendon of the Biceps. About an inch below the Elbow, it commonly divides into two principal Arteries, the lladiul and Ulnar. It happens.

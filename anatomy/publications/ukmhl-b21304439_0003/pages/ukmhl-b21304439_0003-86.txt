U COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [FatitV, In their course through the Mesentery, the principal Branches communicate, first by reciprocal Arches, thcil by Areolae or Meshes of different figures, which in- crease in number, but diminish in size, as they approach the Intestines. From the last of these Areolae, many Branches arc detached, which take a straight course to the concave side of the Intestines, and are afterwards ramified through the Substance of the Gut, forming numberless Anastomoses with each other, and terminating at length upon the inner side of the Canal, by Branches so mi- nute as to require the assistance of Glasses to view them distinctly. The Branches produced from the right or concave side of the Trunk are situated between the Layers of the Meso-colon,— their length being almost equal to the breadth of that Membrane. Near the Intestines, they communicate by large, and then by smaller Arches,—but the Arteries here are of greater magnitude than those which belong to the Small Intestines; their Arches are also larger, but they are less frequent, and nearer the Bowels; of course, the last Ramifications sent off from these Arches are shorter than those belonging to the Small Intestines. The principal Branches arc the following: The Ilio-Colica, which arises near the under part of the Trunk, supplies the end of the Ilium and beginning of the Colon, and communicates with the Branches' sent from the extremity of the Trunk of the Artery: A Short Trunk, which divides into— The Colica Dex/ra, for supplying the right side of the Colon,

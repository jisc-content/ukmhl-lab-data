S8 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part V. the Interstices of the Metacarpal Bones, to the roots of, or Clefts between the Fingers. At these Clefts, each of the three Digital Arteries is divided into two Branches, one of which Branches of each division runs along the Anterior Radial Margin of one Finger, and the other along the anterior Ulnar Margin of the Finger next it iâ€”the three Digital Arte- ries thus supplying the Margins of all the Fingers, ex- cepting the inner Margin of the Little Finger, and the outer Margin of the Index. At the roots of the Fingers, each of the Digital Arteries receives a small Branch from the Arcus Pro- fundus. At the Roots and Joints, but more particularly at the Points of the Fingers, the Arteries communicate by cross Arches, and send Branches to the parts adjacent. The Superficial Arch of the Palm commonly sendsi off one of the Arteries of the Thumb, and ultimately communicates by a large Anastomosis with the Root of- the Arteria Magna Pollicis. * Veins of the Superior Extremity, and of part of the Neck. The Veins of the Superior Extremities have numerous Valves, and are divided into a Superficial and a Deep Set; the former lying immediately under the Integu- ment, the latter accompanying the Arteries, and taking their names from them. The Subcutaneous Veins have many large Anastomo- ses with each other, particularly on the Fore Arm, where they

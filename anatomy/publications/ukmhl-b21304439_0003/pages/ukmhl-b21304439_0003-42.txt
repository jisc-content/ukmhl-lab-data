33 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part V. Arteries of the Brain. The Arteries of the Brain consist of the two Internal Carotids, and the two Vertebrals. Eacli Internal Carotid, after sending forwards the Ocular Artery, gives a number of separate Twigs to the Optic Nerve, the Infundibulum, and the Choroid Plexus, and sends a particular branch backwards to the Vertebral, termed Artcria Communicans, and then divides into two principal parts, the Arteria Anterior, and Arteria Media Cerebri. The \rteria Anterior Cerebri turns towards its fellow of the opposite side, and commonly sends Fila- ments to the First and Second Pair of Nerves. A little before the union of the Optic Nerves, the right and left Anterior Cerebral Arteries become al- most contiguous, and anastomose by means of a short, but large transverse Branch, and sometimes by two, which form part of that Communication of Vessels termed Circus Arteriosus Willisii. From this transverse Branch, but more frequently from the Anterior Cerebral Artery near it, a Branch is sent off, which passes into the Third Ventricle, and fur- nishes Twigs to the Septum Lucidum, and fore part of the Fornix. The Anterior Cerebral Artery ascends upon the in- ner side of the Anterior Lobe of the Brain, and sends off a principal Branch, and commonly another soon after, both of which arch backwards upon the inner flat Surface of the Hemisphere.

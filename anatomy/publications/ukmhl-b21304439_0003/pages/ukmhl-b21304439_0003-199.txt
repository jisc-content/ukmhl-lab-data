Part VII.] OF THE NERVES. 1S7 I form them ; as has been already observed in the general description of the Nerves. As soon as the Spinal Nerves emerge from between ithe Vertebrae, each sends Branches backwards to the Muscles near the Spine, and others forwards, to join ithe Great Sympathetic Nerve ; while the Trunk is con- ; tinued outwards to its place of destination. The Spinal Nerves are distinguished-on each side by : numbers, according to the Bones under which they ! pass : Thirty Pairs are most commonly enumerated ;— i one going under the Head, and termed Sub-occipital; —seven passing under the Cervical,—twelve under the Dorsal,—five under the Lumbar Vertebrae,—and five under the pieces which originally composed the Os Sa- crum. The Fasciculi which form the Cervical Nerves are short, running nearly in a straight direction from their origin to the Intervertebral Holes. Those which form the Dorsal Nerves are longer than the former, and run more obliquely downwards ; and those which form the Lumbar and Sacral Nerves are very long, and run still more obliquely downwards, till at length the undermost of them become nearly longitudinal. The size of the Fasciculi corresponds with that of the Nerves which they go to form.—The Fasciculi of the four lowest Cervical and first Dorsal are large and broad, giving origin to the Great Nerves which supply the Su- perior Extremity.—Those of the Back are much more slender, while the Fasciculi of the Loins and the three upper Sacral ones are of great size, to form the very targe Nerves which run to the Lower Extremity.

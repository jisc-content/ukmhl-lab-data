224 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part VIt. Ip its course from the Abdomen, and at the upper part of the Thigh, it is situated at the outside of the Femoral Artery, which lies between it and the correy sponding Vein. Behind Poupart’s Ligament, it is divided into many Branches, which are distributed to the Muscles and In- teguments on the fore and lateral parts of the Thigh,— one Branch in particular, termed Saphcenus, descending upon the Leg. The Branches are as follow : The Cutaneiis Medius, which descends in the fore part of the Thigh, opposite to the inner edge of the Rectus, and supplies the Integuments near it, as far as the Knee, —one Branch of it connecting itself with another of the Cutaneus Anterior: The Cutaneus Anterior, more internal than the Cuta- neus Medius,—which crosses over the middle of the Sartorius, and, after supplying the adjacent Integu- ments, terminates in the Skin and Cellular Substance, at the fore and inner part of the Knee: The Cutaneus Interims, still more internal than the former, which passes between the Sartorius ancl Triceps, and, after giving Filaments to the Integuments at thc- inside of the Thigh, terminates in the Skin, at the un- der and fore part of the Knee. The Deep Branches of the Crural Nerve, which are considerably larger than the Superficial, go to the Pec- fineus and Triceps, to the Sartorius and Gracilis, and to the four Extensors of the Leg, and also furnish Twigs to the Femoral Blood-vessels. The Ncrvus Saphanus descends between the Sartorius and

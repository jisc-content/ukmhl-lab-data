SO COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part V. whereby an Arch common to the two Arteries is formed at the root of the Acromion : The ClRCUMFLEXA, vel ArTICULARIS ANfERIOR, which is sent off between the Subscapularis and Teres Major. It passes in a transverse direction between the Heads of the Coraco-Brachialis and Biceps, and Body of the Os Ilumeri, immediately below the Joint of the Humerus. It is dispersed upon the Muscles which cover it, and upon the Periosteum and Capsular Liga- ment of the Joint: The Circumfi.exa, vel Articularis Posterior, which arises directly opposite to the former, or by a common root with it, and is by much the larger of the two. i It passes first between the Subscapularis and Teres Major, and then turns round between the back part of the Os Humeri, and Long Head of the Triceps, and the Deltoides. It sends Branches to the Periosteum and Joint, to the Short Head of the Biceps and Coraco- Brachialis, to the two Tereti, to the Triceps and Sub- scapularis, and runs in a circular manner to the Del- toides. Its extreme Branches anastomose with those of the Anterior Circumflex Artery, so as completely to encompass the Body of the Bone. After giving off these different Branches, the Axillary Artery emerges from behind the edge of the Pectoralis Major, and runs along the Os Humeri, where it is termed Humeral or Brachial Artery.

Part VII.] OF THE NERVES. 2Gi are distributed to the Thumb and Fingers. Of these, two go to the Thumb, and one to the Radial side of : the Fore Finger; the rest come off from two forked Trunks, near the Heads of the Metacarpal Bones, and supply the adjacent sides of the Fore and Middle, and of the Middle and Ring Fingers. These Branches send Twigs through the Aponeurosis ;to the Integuments of the Palm, and others to the Mus- culi Lumbricales ; after which they accompany the Ar- tteries sent out from the Superficial Palmar Arch, be- * stowing Twigs to the adjacent parts of the Fingers, at ■the points of which they terminate, by numerous Fibres : The Ulnar Nerve, which, like the former, is of ;great size, comes off chiefly from the last Cervical and .First Dorsal Nerve. It extends along the inside of the Triceps, frequently jperforating some of its Fleshy Fibres, and, near the Elbow, slants a little backwards, to get into a Groove lbetween the inner Condyle of the Os Humeri and Ole- cranon of the Ulna. From thence it passes to the Fore Arm, where, after Jperforating the Heads of the Flexor Muscles, it joins tthe Ulnar Artery a little below its origin, and accom- panies that Vessel,—running behind it all the way to the IHand. Under the Axilla, it sometimes receives a Branch from the Spiral Nerve; and from this connection, or ifrom the Trunk of the Ulnar Nerve itself, a Subcuta- meous Branch is sent off, which runs between the Tri- iceps anti Integuments ; furnishing Branches to the lat- ter for a considerable way along the Fore Arm.

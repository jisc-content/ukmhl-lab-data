229 Part VII.] OF THE NERVES. Over the outer Condyle of the Os Femoris, it gives off’ another Cutaneous Branch, which descends upon the Gastrocnemius, and, after anastomosing with a Branch of the Tibialis, goes along the outer part of the Leg, and terminates in the Integuments of that side of the Foot. The Fibular Nerve afterwards passes over the Head of the Fibula, and divides into Superficial and Deep Branchest which supply the Muscles and Integuments of the outer and fore part of the Leg. The Superfcial Fibulor crosses over the Fibula, im- mediately under its articulation, and, perforating the Peroneus Longus, and going over the Brevis, it gives Branches to both, and afterwards becomes Subcuta- neous, about the middle of the outer part of the Leg. It sends Branches to the Metatarsus, and to the Ex- tensor Digitorum Brevis ; and others, which, after anas- tomosing upon the upper part of the Foot, furnish Dor- sal Branches to the larger Toes. The Deep Fibular Nerve crosses over the Fibula, im- mediately above the former, and divides into several Branches, viz. A Defected Branch to the soft parts of the Joint *. A Branch to the Peroneus Longus: A Branch to the Tibialis Anticus: Branches to the Extensor Pollicis, and Extensor Di- gitorum Longus : Filaments which creep along the Periosteum of the Tibia, and others which adhere to the Coats of the Ti- bia!

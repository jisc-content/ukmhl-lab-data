The Mesenterica Superior, vel Major, arises from the Aorta, immediately below the Coeliac Artery, which it equals in size ; and, running under or behind the Pancreas, and then over the Duodenum, it passes between the Layers of the Mesentery, towards the un- der side of the Abdomen. In its descent, it is bent forwards and a little to the left side, its lower extremity turning toward the begin- ning of the Colon. From the convex side of the Artery, many large Branches are sent off to the Small Intestines; while others proceed from the right side to the right portion of the Colon. t The First Arteries sent off from the Trunk are very inconsiderable, running to the Pancreas and to the left portion of the Duodenum, and communicating there with Branches of the Cceliac Artery. The principal Branches from the left or convex side of the Trunk are dispersed upon the Jejunum and Ilium, supplying, in their course, the Layers of the Mesentery with the parts it contains. The first of these Branches are short and small; those which succeed gradually increase in length and size to the middle of the Arch, after which they diminish again somewhat in the same proportion towards the lower part of the Ilium.

It has also, in a few rare instances, been observed to terminate in the Veins in the right side ot the Neck, while a short Trunk, similar to that commonly found there, has terminated in the left side. The Superior, in a similar manner with the Inferior Extremities, have two sets of Lymphatics, one lying immediately under the Integuments, and belonging to the Skin and Cellular Substance under it, the other ac- companying the principal Blood-vessels, and belonging to the deep-seated parts. The Superficial Lymphatics of the Superior Extre- mities are numerous, and are readijy seen in Emaciated Dropsical Subjects. They arise from the fore and back parts of the Fin- gers and Hand, by a considerable number of Branches, and form an extensive Plexus upon the corresponding sides of the Fore-arm.

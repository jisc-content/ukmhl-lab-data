It afterwards perforates the Notch in the superior Costa of the Scapula, and, expand- ing its Branches upon the Dorsum of that Bone, sup- plies the Spinati and other Muscles situated there, and likewise furnishes Branches to the Joint of the Shoul- der. Besides the Branches of the Subclavian Artery men- tioned above, others are frequently found, which are more variable in their origin, and in their distribution in the Neck j coming off occasionally from the Trunk of the Subclavian Artery, or, at other times, from some of its Branches already described. Axillary Artery. The Axillary Artery, lying in the Axilla, between the Subscapularis and Serratus Major, is surrounded by the Lymphatic Glands and Fat, by the Veins, and also bv the large Nerves which form the Brachial Plexus.

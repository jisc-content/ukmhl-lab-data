Part VII.] OF THE NERVES. 1SS SPINAL MARROW, AND ORIGIN OF THE SPINAL NERVES. The Spinal, or Vertebral Marrow, is the conti- nuation of the Medulla Oblongata, and obtains its name from being contained in the Osseous Canal of the Spine. It is invested by the same Membranes which cover the Brain, and has an additional partial Involucrum from the Ligamentous Membrane which lines the Bodies of the Vertebras, and which has been already taken no- tice of in the description of the Ligaments. On the inner side of the Ligamentous Lining, the Dura Mater is situated, which passes out of the Cra- nium by the Foramen Magnum Occipitis, and forms a Cylindrical Sheath, which loosely envelopes the Spinal Marrow, and extends as far as the Os Sacrum. It is more elastic than the Dura Mater of the Brain, and thereby admits more readily of the different mo- tions of the Spine. At its egress from the Cranium, it is intimately con- nected to the beginning of the above-mentioned com- mon Ligamentous Lining, and is also united with the Pericranium at the edge of the Foramen Magnum of the Occipital Bone.

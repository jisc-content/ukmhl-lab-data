After dispersing the Branches already mentioned, the Pudic Artery divides, at the root of the Penis, into three principal Branches, viz. The First Branch, which passes into the Bulb of the Urethra, and is continued forward in the Corpus Spon- giosum Urethrae, into the Cells of which many of its Branches open : The Second Branch, termed Profunda Penis, or Cavernosa, which goes into the Crus Penis of the cor- responding side, and directs its course in the Corpus Cavernosam, through which it passes, in nearly a straight line, .o its other extremity ; its Branches com- municating with the Artery of the opposite side, and by innumerable Branches with the Cells of the Penis: The Third Branch, called Dorsalis Penis, which turns between the Symphysis Pubis and root of the Penis, and proceeds along the Dorsum as far as the Gians, adher- ing closely to the Ligamentous Substance which incloses the Corpora Cavernosa, and sending Branches to it and to the Integuments.

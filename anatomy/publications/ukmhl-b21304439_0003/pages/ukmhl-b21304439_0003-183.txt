Part VII.] OF THE NERVES. 171 Membrane lining the Gyri,—the Nerves seeming to ter- minate in a semi-pellucid Pulpy Membrane, resembling the Retina of the Eye. The Membrane upon which the Nerves are expand- ed, is but slightly connected to the Periosteum which lines the inner side of the Cochlea, and which, though thin, may be readily perceived, being painted with Blood-vessels;—nor does it differ from the Periosteum lining the Tympanum.—See Dr Monro’s Treatise on the Ear. The Fasciculus, which belongs to the Vestible and Semicircular Canals, forms at first a Plexus, then a Gan- gliform Enlargement, previous to its entrance into the Labyrinth. The Nerves which belong to the Vestible and Semi- circular Canals, pass through the Macula Cribrosa, or Holes subdivided into smaller Holes by Cribriform Plates in the bottom of the Meatus Auditorius Inter- pus. Of these Branches, small Filaments pass through the Macula Cribrosa in the Inferior Fossula of the Meatus Auditorius Internus, to the Alveus Communis or Sac- culus Vestibuli. A small Branch goes through another Cribriform Hole in the Inferior Fossula, to the Ampulla of the pos- terior Membranaceous Semicircular Canal. A Branch, larger than any of the former, enters the posterior Holes in the upper Fossula of the Meatus In- ternus, to be dispersed upon the Ampullae of the Supe- rior and Exterior Membranaceous Canals. The Nerves, after reaching the Sacculus Vpstibuli and the

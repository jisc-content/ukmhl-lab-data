227 Part VII.] OF THE NERVES. The Fifth, which is scarcely above the size of a sew- ing-thread, passes forwards between the extremity of the Os Sacrum and Os Coccygis. After giving Twigs to the Coceygeus, it perforates the Sacro-Sciatic Liga- ments, and terminates in the Muscles and Integuments of the Anus. Scfatic Nerve.—The Sciatic or Ischiatic Nerve passes obliquely through the Notch of the Ilium, between the Pyriformis and Gemelli. It goes afterwards over the other short Rotator Muscles, and is placed between the Tuber Ischii and Trochanter Major, where it is co- vered by the Gluteus Maximus. After leaving the Pelvis, it descends in the back part of the Thigh, fi^st between the Long Flexors and Ad- ductor Magnus, and then between the latter and Os Femoris, to the Ham, where it obtains the name of Po- plitcus. In this course, it gives out the following Branches, which supply the Muscles and Integuments on the back part of the Thigh, viz. Twigs to the Rotators of the Thigh, which come oft' from it after its passage through the Sciatic Notch : The Cuianeus Superior Posterior, which arises within the Pelvis, and, passing out with the Sciatic, is divided into Branches, some of which arc reflected to the Scro-< turn in the Male, and to the posterior parts of the La- bia in the Female; and in both, to the Skin about the Anus and Pcrinceum.—The principal Branches of this Nerve pass downwards, supplying the Integuments of the back part of the Thigh, as far as the bending of the Knee:

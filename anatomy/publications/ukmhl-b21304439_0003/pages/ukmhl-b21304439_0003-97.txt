I Fart V.] OF THE BLOOD-VESSELS. Si nish Twigs to the Vesiculae Seminales, Prostate Gland, and Rectum. In the Female, the Umbilical Artery sends minute Branches to the Bladder, Uterus, Vagina, and Rec- tum : Arteria Uterina.—The Arteria Uterina, termed -also Uterina Hypogaslrica, is much larger than the Spermatic Artery ; and, like that Artery, increases in size in the state of pregnancy. It arises from the Hypogastric, near the origin of Pudic, Haeraorrhoidal, or Umbilical Arteries, and runs into the Uterus at its under extremity. % It is afterwards reflected upwards along the edge of the Uterus, towards its Fundus or upper part, where it meets with the Spermatic Artery, with which it forms frequent Anastomoses. It runs under the outer Coat of the Uterus, and sends out many Serpentine Branches which plunge into its Substance; forming numerous communications with the Artery of the opposite side. The Uterine Artery sends Branches downwards to be distributed extensively upon the Substance of the Vagina, a principal Branch of which is termed Vagi- nalis, and others forwards to be dispersed upon the Bladder: Arteria Vaginalis.—The Arteria Vaginalis is com- monly from the Uterine, at other times it is from the Trunk of the Hypogastric, or from some of the adja- cent Branches, particularly the middle Haemorrhoidal. It is extensively distributed upon the Vagina, commu- nicating with the Uterine Branches at the Cervix of the Uterus. F 5 Besides

42 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [PaktV, one, situated in the under edge of the Falx.—It receives Branches from that Membrane, and from the Corpus Callosum and parts of the Brain near it, and terminates in the beginning of the Torcular Herophili: The two Lateral Sinuses, or Second and Third Si- nuses of the Ancients, formed by the Longitudinal and Torcular Sinuses They run at the Posterior Edge of the Tentorium, along the Lateral Ridges of the Os Occipitis, as far as the Base of the Petrosal Processes of the Temporal Bones, from whence they wind downwards, pass through the Foramina Lacera common to the Occipital and Temporal Bones, and form the Internal Jugular Veins. Frequently one of the Lateral Sinuses is formed by the Longitudinal, and the other by the Torcular Si- nus ; in which case, the one is found larger than the Other. The Lateral Sinuses receiye Veins from the Cerebel- lum, and from the under and back part of the Cere- brnm. They likewise receive the following small Si- nuses, situated under the Brain, viz. The Circular Sinus of Ridley, which is placed about the Glandula Pituitaria, and frequently surrounds it completely ; receiving the Blood fpom it, and froiq the adjacent Bones and Membranes, and terminating in the Cavernous Sinuses : The Cavernous Sinuses, which are situated at the sides of the Sella Turcica, and receive Blood from Veins ly- ing near the lateral Branches of the Internal Carotid Arteries, from the Ocular Veins, and from the Circular £>inus of Ridley.

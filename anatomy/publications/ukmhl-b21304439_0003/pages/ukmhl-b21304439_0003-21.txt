9 Part V.] OF THE BLOOD-VESSELS. The Coats of the Veins are the same in number with those of the Arteries, but are thinner, denser, and less elastic. Their Coats are thicker, however, propor- tionally in the small Branches than in the Trunks. In the large Veins, as the Vena Cava, the Coats can be separated from each other; bpt in the small Branches their separation is difficult. The Muscular Coat of the Veins being loose like Cel- lular Substance, much thinner, and more indistinct than that of the Arteries, has occasioned its existence to be denied by many Authors. The Veins are also furnished with their Vasa Vasorum, similar to, and from the same source with those of the Arteries. The Colour of the Veins is bluish, and when full of Blood, in consequence of their thinness, they appear of a purple tinge. Their Size is move than double that of the Arteries to which they belong-, excepting the Pulmonary Veins, the size of which scarcely surpasses that of the corre- sponding Arteries. In the Fleshy parts of the Body, particularly in the extremities, they consist of Two Sets; one Deep-sea led, accompanying the Arteries, the other running imme- diately under the Skin, and termed Subcutaneous. The Veins of the Thoracic and Abdominal Viscera generally accompany their Arteries; and the same is observable in the small Bi'anches belonging to Membra- nous parts. The Figure of the Veins is similar to that of the Ar- teries; and, upon comparing the Area of their Trunks with

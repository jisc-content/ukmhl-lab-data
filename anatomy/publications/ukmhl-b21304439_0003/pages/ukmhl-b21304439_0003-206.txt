m COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Fart VIE the Muscles and Integuments at the under part of the Neck, and upper part of the Shoulder. The Fourth Cervical sends a Branch behind the Muscles situated on the fore and lateral parts of the Cervical Vertebrae, to the middle Ganglion of the Sym- pathetic Nerve. It is connected by one, and sometimes by two Fila- ments, to the Diaphragmatic Nerve. It gives Twigs to the Jugular Glands and Deep Mus- cles of the Neck, and, at the outer edge of the anterior Scalenus, joins the Fifth Cervical Nerve. The Fifth Cervical is united with the Fourth into a common Trunk, which, after running a little farther out, joins the Sixth Cervical Nerve. The Sixth Cervical joins the Seventh behind the Clavicle; and to the Seventh, the First Dorsal Nerve is ^dded over the First Rib. The Four Inferior Cervicals and First Dorsal Nerves are of great size,â€”especially the three intermediate Nerves. A They pass out between the Scalenus Anticus and Me- dius, and afterwards run between the Subclavius and First Rib, at the outer side of the Subclavian Artery, to the Axilla. In the Axilla they separate, unite, and separate again, forming an irregular Plexus, termed Axillary or Bra- chial, which surrounds the Axillary Artery. The Axillary Plexus sends Branches to the Subscapu- laris, Teres Major and Latissimus Dorsi, and furnishes the External Thoracic Nerves which accompany the Blood-

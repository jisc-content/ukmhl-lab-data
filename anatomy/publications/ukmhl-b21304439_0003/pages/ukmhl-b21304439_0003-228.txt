216 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [PartVU. The retained, and the particular name of each Plexus is de- rived from the Artery which it surrounds, or the Yiscus to which it belongs. The Hepatic Plexus, after giving Twigs to the Re- nal Glands, sends Filaments to the Diaphragm, which accompany the Diaphragmatic Arteries, and anastomose with Branches of the Phrenic Nerves. It afterwards divides into Right and Left Plexuses, corresponding with the Right and Left Branches of the Hepatic Artery, or with the Right and Left Trunks, when such are present. The Left Hepatic Plexus furnishes several Branches to the Stomach, which intermix with those of the Eighth Pair, upon the small Curvature. The Right Hepatic Plexus imparts Branches to the corresponding parts of the Pancreas, to the small end of the Stomach and beginning of the Duodenum, and gives origin to the Right Gastro-Epiploic Plexus, which attends the Artery of the same name, distributing its Filaments to the Great Curvature of the Stomach, and to the Omentum Majus. The Hepatic Plexuses surround the Hepatic Artery and Vena Portae, and, after sending several Filaments to the Biliary Ducts and Gall-Bladder, follow the Branches of the Blood-vessels through the Substance of the Liver. The Splenic Plexus, composed of several small Filaments, surrounds the Splenic Artery, gives Twigs to the Pancreas, and then accompanies the Vessels into the Spleen.

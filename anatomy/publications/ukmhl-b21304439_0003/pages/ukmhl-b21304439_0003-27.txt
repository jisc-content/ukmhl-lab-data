Part V.] OF THE BLOOD-VESSELS. 15 what higher than the Arch of the Aorta, and has at first a small inclination towards the right side. After descending about an inch, it perforates the Pe- ricardium, and having run nearly twice, this space, it enters the Right Auricle, opposite to the termination of the Inferior Cava. The Superior Cava receives the Blood from the Head, Neck, Arms, and Containing Parts of the Thorax, and also carries it to the Heart. BLOOD-VESSELS of the HEAD, and PART OF THOSE OF THE NECK. Arteries. From the upper side of the Arch of the Aorta, Three Targe Arteries arise, which supply the Head, Neck, and Superior Extremities. . Of these Three Arteries, one on the right side, term- ed Innominata, or Communis, soon divides into the Right Carotid, and Right Subclavian Artery. The other two are the Left Carotid, and Left Subcla- vian, which come off in separate Trunks. The above is the ordinary way in which the Carotids and Subclavians come off from the Aorta, but there is considerable variety in this respect in different Bodies. Sometimes there are two Common Trunks from which these Arteries take their rise ; at other times there are four original Arteries from the Aorta, and in some rare cases

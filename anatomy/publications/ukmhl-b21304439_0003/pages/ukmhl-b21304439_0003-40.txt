28 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOM^. [Part V„ Its Branches are dispersed upon the Lens in a ra- diated manner, and, after surrounding it, some of them are sent forwards to the Mcmbrana Pupillaris, as may be distinctly seen by a fine Injection thrown into the Ocular Artery previous to the seventh Month of Ges- tation : The Arteries Ciliares, three or sometimes more in number,—which divide into Branches running in a Ser- pentine direction along the opposite sides of the Optic Nerve, and dividing into the Ciliares Breves, and Ci« ii ares Longse : The Ciliares Breves, vel Posteriores, which are formed not only of Branches from the original Ciliary Trunks, but also of Twigs from the Muscular Branches, and arc numerous. They perforate the Sclerotica, near the In- sertion of the Optic Nerve, give Twigs to that Coat, and dividing into still smaller Branches, Creep forwards upon the Tunica Choroides *,—forming many communi- cations with each other as they ndvance, and retiring gradually from the convex to the concave surface of this Coat, to supply the Iris and Ciliary Processes. The Ciliares Lougcc, which seldom consist of more than two Trunks. They perforate the Sclerotica a little ther forwards than the former, pass along the Choroid Coat to its anterior part, and then each separates into two Branches, and these into others which inosculate round the outer edge of the Iris. ' Besides the Ciliares Breves et Longse, there is an- other Set, termed Ciliares Anteriores, which are a few Arterious Filaments from the Muscular Branches, en- tering

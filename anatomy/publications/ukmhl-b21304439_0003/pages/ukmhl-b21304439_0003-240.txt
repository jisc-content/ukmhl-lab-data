228 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part VII A Branch to the Long Head of the Biceps: Two small Nerve,s, the one termed Cidaneus Interims Superior, which comes off near the upper part of the Thigh, and vanishes in the Skin, a little farther down ; the other, termed Cutancus Interims Inferior, which arises near the former, goes down the posterior part of the Thigh, and then, descending upon the inner Head of the Gastrocnemius Extern us, terminates in the In- teguments of the Calf of the Leg : A Larne Common Trunk, and sometimes, instead of it, separate Branches, which arise near the middle of the Thigh, and are distributed to the Adductor Mag- nus, Semi-Membranosus, Biceps, and Semi-Tendino- sus. Nervus Popliteus.â€”The Popliteal Nerve is situated between the Ham-strings, and between the Skin and Popliteal Blood-vessels. A little above the bending of the Knee, it is divided into a Small External, and a Large Internal Branch ; the former named Popliteus Ext cm us, or Fibular, and the latter Popliteus Interims, or Tibial Nerve. The Tibial and Fibular Nerves adhere, for someway,, by Cellular Substance; and even the Trunk of the Sciatic may be split into these two Nerves for a consi- derable way up the Thigh. The Fibular, termed also Peroneal Nerve, sends off, at its beginning, the Cutancus Externus, which is a small Branch giving Twigs to the under end of the Bi- ceps, and which, after running down on the outer Head of the Gastrocnemius, disappears in the Integuments of the same side of the Leg.

136 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part VI. The Stomach, and, after becoming larger, they enter other Glands in company with the Deep-seated Lymphatics of the Liver, along with which they terminate in the Thoracic Duct. The other Set pass from the Great Curvature of the Stomach, partly to the right, and partly to the leftside, and, as on the Small Curvature, are formed of Branches from its opposite Surfaces. Those on the left side receive the Lymphatics of the middle and corresponding half of the Omentum Majus ; running to the left side of the Large Curvature of the Stomach, and passing through one or two small Glands on it, they go with the Lymphatics of the Spleen and Pancreas to the Thoracic Duct. Those of the right side receive the Lymphatics of the corresponding halt of the Great Omentum, and also pass through one or two small Glands which lie close to the liight Gastric Artery. In their descent by the Pylorus, they meet the Plexus which accompanies the Superior Coronary Artery, and run with them and with the Deep Lymphatics of the Liver to the Thoracic Duct. The Lymphatics of the Liver, like those of the other Viscera, run in two Sets; the Superficial of which are numerous, and unite into Trunks in the manner Roots unite to form the Trunk of a Tree. The Superficial and Deep Sets communicate so freely, that upon injecting the Lymphatics of the Lxternai Sur- face, the Deep-seated Absorbcuts are readily filled from them.

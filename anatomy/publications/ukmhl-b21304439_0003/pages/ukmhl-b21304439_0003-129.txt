Part V.] OF THE BLOOD-VESSELS. 117 Lumbar Vertebra,—unite to form the Inferior Cava, si- tuated, as formerly mentioned, at the right side of the Aorta. The Vena Cava Inferior, which is much larger than the Cava Superior, and greatly exceeds in size the descending Aorta,—receives, at its beginning, the Vena Sacra, and, higher, the Vense Lumbares, which, in the left side, pass behind the Trunk of the Aorta. It likewise receives the Vense Renales, and the Sper- matica of the right side. At length it takes in the Vense Hepaticse and Dia- phragmaticae, and, perforating the Tendinous part of the Diaphragm, at the root of the Liver, it terminates in the under part of the Right Auricle of the Heart; thus receiving the Blood from the Inferior Extremities, from the Viscera and Parities of the Abdomen, or from all the parts situated under the Diaphragm.

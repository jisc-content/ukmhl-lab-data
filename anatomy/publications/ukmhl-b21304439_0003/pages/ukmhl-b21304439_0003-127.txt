Part V.] OF THE BLOOD-VESSELS. 115 from the Radial or Ulnar Veins, in being proportion- ally larger. The Tibial and Fibular Veins anastomose in some places with each other, and also communicate with the Subcutaneous Veins. At the upper part of the Leg, they are united toge- ther, to form the Vena Poplitea, and the union is nearly at the same place where the corresponding Arteries come off. The Vena Poplitea adheres closely to the upper or posterior surface of the Artery, which it in a great mea- sure conceals, and is commonly single, excepting a small Vein which sometimes accompanies it, and communi- cates with it. The Popliteal Vein receives the Venae Surales and Articulares, and the Saphaena Minor; after which it forms the Femoral Vein. The Vena Femoralis receives the Veins which cor- respond with the perforating Branches of the Femoral Artery, and passes in through the Triceps, where the Artery comes out. In the middle of the Thigh it lies deeper than the Artery, afterwards turning gradually to its inner side j and, at the upper part 'of the Thigh, is joined by the Vena Profunda. The Vena Profunda receives the Veins correspond- ing with the Branches of the Artery of that name, and is sometimes of a large size, being then in a great mea- sure the continuation of the Vena Poplitea,â€”a small Vein only in such cases accompanying the Trunk of the Femoral Artery.

55 Part V.] OF THE BLOOD-VESSELS. It appears at first as the continuation of the Trunk of the Humeral Arteiy. At its upper part it sinks deep behind the Flexor Muscles of the Hand, and passes afterwards, for some way, between the Flexor Sublimis and Profundus Di- gitorum. When its origin is in the Upper Arm, it commonly runs superficially upon the Aponeurosis of the Fore Arm, in which case the Radial appears as the continuation of the Trunk of the Humeral Arteiy. Near the Wrist, it becomes more superficial, and runs between the Tendons of the Flexor Carpi Ulnaris and Flexor Digitorum Profundus, to the Hand. In this course, it sends off many Branches to the Fore Arm, among which the following are the most considerable: The Recwrens Ulnaris, which runs deep among the Flexor Muscles, and soon divides into Branches, which ascend and supply the parts about the posterior and inner side of the Elbow and Capsule of the Joint.â€”In the Groove behind the Inner Condyle of the Os Hu- meri, it communicates by distinct Anastomoses with the Profunda Inferior, or with the Ramus Anastomoticus, sent down from the Humeral Artery : The Intercssea Posterior, which comes off at the up- per end of the Interosseous Ligament, perforating it immediately after coming off from the Trunk, and going to the back part of the Fore Arm. From this place it sends upwards a Recurrent Branch, which communicates, upon the back part of the Elbowr, with the other Recurrent Arteries, and with the Branches sent down from the Humeral Artery, and forms along D 4 with

[Part V, Besides this, there are other smaller Vaginal Branches from the neighbouring Arteries ; as the Vesicates, Utc- ritia, and Pudica, which communicate with each other, and with the proper Vaginalis, upon the Substance of the Vagina: Arteria Pudica, or Pudenda Communis.â€”The Arteria Pudica, named from its belonging to the Parts of Generation in both Sexes, comes off either imme- diately from the '1 runk of the Hypogastric, or from the Arteria Ischiatica. It passes out of the Pelvis, through the under part of the Notch of the Os Ilium, at the lower edge of the Py- riformis. It then turns between the Sacro-Sciatic Ligaments, to get to the inner side of the Tuber Ischii, where it is lodged so deep in the Cellular Substance, as to be in some measure again in the Cavity of the Pelvis. From the Tuber, it proceeds along the inner side of the Crus of the Os Ischium and of the Os Pubis, and behind the Transversus Perinei and Crus Penis, till it approaches the Symphysis Pubis. In its course, it sends off' many Branches, of which the following are the principal, viz. Branches to the Vesiculae Seminales, Prostate Gland, Neck of the Bladder, and Rectum : Branches to the Muscles and parts adjacent to the Sa- cro-Sciatic Ligaments ; some of them extending as far as the Joint of the Thigh-Bone : Branches to the Muscles, Membranes, and Fat about the Tuber of the Os Ischium.

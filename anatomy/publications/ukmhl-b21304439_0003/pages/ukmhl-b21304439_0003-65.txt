The Radialis passes over the Pronator Teres, and runs on the fore part of the Radius through the whole length of that Bone. It descends between the Supina- tor Longus and Flexor Radialis, resting on the Flexor Longus Pollicis. At the upper part of the Fore Arm, it is covered by the Supinator Longus : In its descent, it becomes more superficial, and, at the under part of the Fore Arm, it lies close upon the Radius, and immediately under the Skin, in consequence of which the Pulse is commonly felt in this place. Its principal Branches are. The Rccurrens Radialis, which is reflected to the Muscles and parts of the Joint near it, and anastomoses freely with the Prdfundo-Radial and Profundo-Minor of the Humeral Artery, at the outer part of the Elbow. In some rare cases, a Branch of considerable size forms a communication between the top of the Radial Artery and Trunk of the Humeral one, a considerable way up the Arm : Numerous Lateral Branches, in the descent of the Artery, to the Muscles and Integuments, and parts in general situated about the Radius : The Supeijicialis Lola:, which goes off at the Wrist, and passes over or through the Abductor Pollicis to the Palm. It is sometimes so small as scarcely to reach the Palm. More frequently it is a considerable Artery, sending Branches to the Ball of the Thumb and super- D 3 â–  ficial

s* COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part V. iicial parts of the Palm near it,—a Branch along the outer side of the Thumb,—and an anastomosing Branch which unites with the Arch of the Ulnar Artery.— Sometimes the Superficial Volar Branch is equal in size to the continuation of the Trunk of the Radial Artery ; in such cases it forms a considerable part of the Super- ficial Palmar Arch of the Ulnar Artery: Small Branches to the Ligaments, Bones, and other parts about the Wrist: One, or sometimes two Branches, termed Dorsal, to the back part of the Metacarpus and Fingers. At the under part of the Fore Arm, the Radial Ar- tery turns back under the Tendons of the Extensors of the Thumb ;—then, getting between the roots of the Metacarpal Bones of the Thumb and Fore Finger, and perforating the Abductor Indicis, it divides into three principal Branches, viz. The Artcria Magna Pollicis, which runs along the side of the Thumb next the Fingers, and sometimes divides at its root into two Branches, which supply both bides of it: The Radialis Indicis, which runs along the side of the Fore Finger next the Thumb : The Palmaris Profunda, which crosses the Hand be- tween the roots of the Metacarpal Bones and Flexors of the Fingers, and forms an Arcus Profundus, from which Branches go off to the Interossei and other deep parts of the Palm. The Ulnaris, somewhat larger than the Radialis, is found at the anterior and inner part of the Fore Arm. It

Part VII.] OF THE NERVES. MS The lateral Portions are firmly united together by fine Cellular Substance, but, without lacerating either, may be separated from each other, before as well as be- hind, to near their middle, where they are connected by a Layer of Cineritious Matter, which passes from the one Cord into the othfer. When the Medulla Spinalis is divided transversely, the Cineritious Substance is observed to have a'Cruci- form appearance, corresponding with the Cords of which it is composed. The Body of the Spinal Marrow descends in the Child to the Twelfth Dorsal, and in the Adult as far as fhe second Lumbar Vertebra, and terminates there by a Conical point, which is concealed by Fasciculi of Nerves. Each of the lateral Portions of the Spinal Marrow sends off from its anterior and posterior parts, fiat Fas- ciculi of Nervous Filaments, which are placed opposite their fellows on the other side. Several of the Fasciculi of the Cervical Nerves detach Filaments to those immediately above or below them ; and the same thing is occasionally observed of some of the Bundles of Dorsal Nerves. The anterior and posterior Fasciculi perforate the Dura Mater, from the inner part of which each Fasci- culus is furnished with a proper Sheath, which is conti- nued along it, and the Sheaths are connected by Cellular Substance only, till they get between the Vertebrae. Between the anterior and posterior Fasciculi of Spinal Nerves, and between the Tunica Arachnoidea and Pia Mater, a small Ligamentous Cord, termed Ligamcntum. Denticulatum,

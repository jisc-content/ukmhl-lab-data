I 23 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part a through the Foramen Spinale of the Sphenoid Bone, and spreads, like the Branching of a Tree, over the Surface of the Dura Mater and inside of the Parietal Bone. Before entering the Foramen Spinale, it sometimes gives Twigs to the Muscles and other parts near it, and within the Cranium, besides the Branches mentioned above, it furnishes Twigs to the Substance of the Bones, and to the Inner Ear : The Inferior Maxillary Branch, which runs in the Inferior Maxillary Canal, sending Branches to the Sub- stance of the Bone, and to the Teeth; the remainder of it passing out at the Anterior Maxillary Foramen, communicating upon the Chin with Branches of the Facial Artery: Branches to the Pterygoideus, Massetcr, and inner part of the Temporalis, under the names of Artcricc Pterygoidece, Massetericce, and Tcmporalcs Profundce: The Arteria Buccalis to the Buccinator and other soft parts of the Check : The Arleria Alvcolaris, which runs behind the An- trum, and sends Branches to the soft parts surrounding the Upper Jaw.â€”It sends other Branches which enter by small Holes to the Antrum, and to the Substance, and Back Teeth of the Jaw j one of which is larger than the rest, and is the Proper Alveolaris : The Injra-Orbitar, which passes in the Canal under the Orbit, giving, at its entrance, Twigs to the soft parts in the bottom of the Orbit, and, in its progress, other Twigs to the Antrum, Substance of the Jaw, and Fore Teeth j after which it goes out at the Foramen Infra-

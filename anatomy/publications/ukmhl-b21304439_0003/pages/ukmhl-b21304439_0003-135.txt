Part VI.] OF THE ABSORBENTS. 123 Origins towards their terminations, in which they are assisted by the motions of the surrounding parts, indeT pendent of such a Vis a Tergo as contributes to propel the Blood through the Veins. They are furnished with Blood-vessels for their nou- rishment, as is sometimes distinctly observed by pene- trating Injections •, and this is rendered still more evi- dent, by their being susceptible of inflammation and pain. The presence of Nerves also appears probable from the acuteness of their feeling when in a state of inflam- mation. In general, they have a waving direction, and form an irregular Net-wo?-Jc, having frequent communications with each other; and these are most numerous in the vicinity of their Glands. . Through their whole extent, they are intercepted by Valves, which are placed in Pairs, and are of a semicir- cular form ; having one edge of each Valve fixed to the side of the Vessel, and the other edge loose across its Cavity, but turned towards the general terminations, being quite similar to the Valves of the Red Veins. In some parts, the Valves are found to be situated at equal distances; in others, more irregularly.—Their number also is very uncertain, amounting m some parts to three or four, and in others to seven or eight pairs, or upwards, in the length of an inch ;—bin varying still more with respect to number in different Bodies, and in different parts of the same Body. "W hen the Absorbents are distended, they appear largest on the side of the Valves towards their general terminations.

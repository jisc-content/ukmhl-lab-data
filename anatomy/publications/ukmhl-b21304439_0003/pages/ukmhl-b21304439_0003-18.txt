6 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part V. is diminished, and this is in proportion to the number of their Ramifications. Wherever an Artery divides into two Branches, the Area of these two Branches, taken conjunctly, is found to be nearly one half larger than the Area of the Trunk from which they issue. When the Trunk and Branches of an Artery are re- garded collectively, they appear evidently ot a Conical figure -, the point of the Cone being formed by the Trunk, and the Basis by the Branches of the Artery. The Section of the Arteries is Circular;—when emp- ty, they become Fiat, but recover their round form upon being distended by Injection. The Angles at which the Branches go off from their Trunks are in general more obtuse or acute, in propor- tion to their vicinity to the Heart, and are‘such as are most favourable to the parts they have to supply. In the Trunk of the Body, or where they belong to tender and de licate Viscera, the Angles are more obtuse, —in the Extremities they are more acute; the former circumstance tending to diminish, and the latter to in- crease, the lorcc ol the Blood. The Arteries form many Divisions and Subdivisions before they reach their Terminations, and at last be- come invisible to the naked Eye. The Divisions formed by any single Artery have been variously enumerated b} different authors,—one, in par- ticular, reckoning them at forty, and another, of equal respectability, only at twenty ; their number, however, js such as to allow them to supply the most minute parts pf the Body.

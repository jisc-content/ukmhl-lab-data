In the termination of *he Absorbents, whether in the Thoracic Duct or in the Red Veins, there is always one, and commonly two Valves, to prevent the Contents of the Duct or of the Veins from passing into them. The Valves promote the general course of the Lymph and Chyle, and prevent the retrograde motion of these Fluids within their Vessels. The Lymphatics take in the Fluids applied to their Orifices by Capillary Attraction, and by a power inhe- rent in themselves, and by their contractile nature, con- duct them into the Mass of Blood, whereby they pre- vent Morbid Accumulations.—The Lacteals, in like manner, receive the Chyle from the Intestines, for the nourishment of the Body. The Conglobate Glands, or Glands of the Absorbent Vessels, arc found in various parts of the Body, and are situated in the Cellular Substance under the Skin, ge- nerally about the great Blood-vessels, or over the Trunks of the Vessels belonging to the different Vis- cera. They are chiefly found at the bendings of the Knee and Thigh j about the Vessels in the Pelvis •, be- tween the plies of the Mesentery, where they are in greater abundance than in any other part of the Body; about the Vessels going to the other Viscera of the Ab- domen ; about the Vessels in both Mediastina, especial- ly the Bronchi; at the inner part of the Arm ; in the Axilla ; about the large Vessels of the Neck ; under the Lower Jaw; before and behind the Ear.

OF THE v NERVES IN GENERAL, 1 he Nerves are firm, white Cords, which are gene- . rally considered as being directly continued from the Medullary Substance of the Brain and Spinal Marrow j —although instances have been frequently met with, where the Brain, and even the Spinal Marrow, have been found nearly obliterated in the Foetus, and yet the Nerves retained their usual appearance. They are composed of Funiculi closely connected, and each of these again of smaller Fibrilla, which may be subdivided into parts so extremely minute, as almost to elude the naked Eye, but which may be readily seen by the assistance of the Microscope:—no cavity, however, has been yet observed in them. The Medullary Part of the Fibrilloe appears to be fur- nished with Cineritious Substance derived from their Pia Mater ; in proof of which, they are observed to be in general ol a browner colour than the Medullary Sub- stance ol the Brain, and larger in their course than at their supposed origin.—Monro’s Ohs. on New.

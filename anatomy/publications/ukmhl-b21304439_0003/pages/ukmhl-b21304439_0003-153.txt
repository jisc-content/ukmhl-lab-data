Part VI.] OF THE ABSORBENTS. HI merous about the sides of the Dorsal Vertebrae, where they form a sort of Chain. Here, likewise, it receives Branches from the Eso- phagus and Lungs *, the former of which is surrounded with a number of Glands, and with a remarkable and intricate Plexus of Lymphatic Vessels. The Superficial Lymphatics of the Lungs form la^ge* Areolae, which have smaller Areolae within them ; the larger running chiefly between the Lobules, and the smaller passing over them in such a manner as to cover almost the whole Surface of the Lungs. From the Surface they go to the root of the Lungs, where they pass through the Bronchial Glands, which have already been taken notice of in the description of the Lungs. At this place they are joined by the deep-seated Lym- phatics, which creep along the Branches of the Trachea and of the Pulmonary Blood-vessels. Through the medium of the Bronchial Glands, the Lymphatics of the two sides of the Lungs communicate freely with each other. Having left the Glands, the principal part of those from the Left Lung form a Trunk of considerable size, which terminates in the Thoracic Duct, behind the Bi- furcation of the Trachea. The rest of the Absorbents of the left Lung pass through Glands behind the Arch of the Aorta, which are likewise common to those of the Lleart. They run at last by a principal Trunk into the Tiioracic Duct near its termination. â€¢ After

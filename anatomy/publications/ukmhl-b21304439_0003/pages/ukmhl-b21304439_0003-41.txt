At the root of the Iris, different Sets of Ciliary Ar- teries unite into Arches, which form an irregular Circle, called Circulus Iridis. From this Circle, many Arteries run upon the Iris, in a radiated serpentine manner, towards the Pupil, near which several of them also unite into Arches ; and from these, Twigs are sent, along with the rest of the radiated Branches, to the inner edge of the Iris.—In the Foetus, they are continued to the Membrana Pa- pillaris : The Muscular is Superior, et Muscular is Inferior, which are dispersed upon the Muscles, Membranes, and Fat of the Eye ; giving Twigs also to the Sclerotic Coat: The Ethmoidalis Anterior, at Posterior, two extremely small Twigs, especially the latter, which pass through the Foramina Orbitaria Interna,—Anteriuset Posterius, —to the Bones and Membranes of the Nose, particu- larly to the Frontal, Ethmoid, and Sphenoid Sinuses, where they communicate with the Nasal Branches of the Internal Maxillary Artery: The Supra-Orbitalis, vel Fiotitalis, which, after giv- ing Branches to the Muscles and Periosteum at the upper and fore part of the Orbit, emerges from the Socket, passes through the Foramen Supra-Orbitarium, and is divided into two parts;—one dispersed upon the Periosteum of the Fore-head, the other running to the Skin and Muscles on the Fore-head and upper Eye-lid, and communicating with the anterior Branch of the Temporal Artery.

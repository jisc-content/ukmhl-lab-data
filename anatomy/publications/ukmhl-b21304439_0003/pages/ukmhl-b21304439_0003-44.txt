52 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [PartV. the substance of the Brain, where they meet with the deep Branches of that Artery. Vertebral Artery. The two Vertebral Arteries,—which are only a little smaller than the Internal Carotids,—arise from the Sub- clavian Arteries at the bottom of the Neck. Each of them, at a small distance from its origin, en- ters the Canal formed for its reception by the six upper- most Cervical Vertebrae, though in some rare instances it is seen entering the Seventh Vertebra, or sometimes only perforating two or three c>f the uppermost of these. It ascends through the Neck, nearly in a straight di- rection, sending Twigs outwards between the Vertebras to the deep Muscles of the Neck, and others which pass inwards by the Holes which transmit the Spinal Nerves, to the Spinal Marrow and its Membranes j com- municating with the Spinal Arteries. Immediately below the Head, it gives out more con- siderable Branches to the Deep Muscles at the back part of the Neck, particularly to the Recti and Obliqui Pos- tici, the Trachelo-Mastoideus, and Complexus j inos- culating with Branches of the Occipital Artery. One turn is formed upwards and outwards, in passing from the third to the second Vertebra ; and another out- wards and forwards, in going between the Vertebra Dcntata and Atlas. After perforating the Atlas, it bends suddenly back, and runs in a horizontal direction in a Notch upon that Bone. Having reached the Foramen Magnum Occipitis, it turns

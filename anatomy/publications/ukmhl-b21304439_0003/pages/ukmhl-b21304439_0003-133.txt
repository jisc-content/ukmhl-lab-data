OF THE absorbents in general. 1 he Absorbent System consists of the Absorbent Vessels 3and Conglobate Glands ; the former of which are divided into Lymphatic and Lacteal Vessels. The Absorbents are small Pellucid Tubes, which have ' Ibeen discovered in most parts of the Body, and are sup- posed to exist in all. They begin by numberless open Mouths, too minute to be visible to the naked Eye: By the assistance of (Glasses, however, the Orifices of the Lacteals have been iseen in the Human Body —and those of the Lympha- l tics in certain kinds of Fishes.—See Monro’s and Crui/c- shank’s Treatises on this Subject. They arise from the External Surface of the Body, I from the Cellular Substance, from the Surfaces of the ! large Cavities, and from the Surface and Substance of I the different Viscera ; but have not yet been distinctly (observed in the Cavity of the Cranium and Spine, nor in the Placenta and its Membranes.

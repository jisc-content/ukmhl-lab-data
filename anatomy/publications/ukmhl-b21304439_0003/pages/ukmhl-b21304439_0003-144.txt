132 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part VI. The Lymphatics of the Bladder, in both Sexes, ac- company its principal Blood-vessels, pass through some small Glands upon the side of it, and, at the under part of the Pelvis, go into the Glands which surround the Internal Iliac Artery and Vein. The Lymphatics of the Uterus run in two sets. One, which is the largest, goes with the Hypogastric, the other with the Spermatic Blood-vessels. The Hypogastric Lymphatics form a Plexus which runs from above downwards, into Glands situated on the sides of the Vagina. From these Glands they pass to others which surround the Internal Iliac Vessels, and then, intermixing with the Trunks from the Extremi- ties, thev terminate in the Thoracic Duct. The Spermatic Lymphatics terminate in the Lumbar Plexus. The Lymphatics of the Uterus, like its Blood-vessels, are much enlarged, and of course easily discovered, in the Gravid state, where they are also observed to be ex- tremely numerous. The Lymphatics of the Rectum go first into small Glands which lie between it and the Os Sacrum, and afterwards terminate in the Lumbar Plexus of Glands and Vessels. Besides the Lymphatics which lie on the inside of the External Iliac Artery, there are others situated on the outside of it, upon the Psoas. Of these one part passes up to the Lumbar Plexus, and goes under the Aorta in different Branches which terminate in the Thoracic Duct. Another part pusses under the Iliac Arteries, and ap- pears upon the Os Sacrum, forming a remarkable Plexus, which

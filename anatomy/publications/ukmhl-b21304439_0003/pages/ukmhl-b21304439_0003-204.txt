192 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part VII. the Head and Neck, perforates these, and forms the Proper Occipital Nerve. The Occipital Nerve ascends upon the Head with the Artery of that name, and terminates upon the Muscles and Integuments on the upper and back part of the Head ; some of its Filaments anastomosing with others belonging to the First Branch of the Fifth, and Portio Dura of the Seventh Pair. The Second Cervical Nerve, after escaping from between the Bones, gives off a Branch, which perforates the Muscles connected to the fore and lateral parts of the Vertebra?, and joins the middle Ganglion of the Sympathetic Nerve. It sends another Branch of considerable size down- wards to the Trunk of the Third Pair. It sends several Branches to the Sterno-Mastoideus, behind which it is connected by an Arch, and still far- ther out by a Filament, with the Nervus Accessorius. It is afterwards divided into several Branches ; one of which passes downwards some way upon the Exter- nal Jugular Vein, and, together with a Branch from the First Cervical, forms an Arch with the Descendens of the Ninth Pair. It gives ofF a small Root, which is united with others in the formation of the Diaphragmatic Nerve. A large Branch comes out from it behind the Sterno- Mastoideus, which, turning over this Muscle, sends off the following Nerves, viz. The Inferior Cutaneous Nerve of the Neele, which passes forwards to the parts under the Lower Jaw: The

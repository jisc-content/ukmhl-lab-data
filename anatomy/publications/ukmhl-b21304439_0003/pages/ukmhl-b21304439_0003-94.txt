82 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part V. The Venje Capsulahes commonly unite into a large Trunk, which, in the left side, terminates in the Vein of the Kidney, while in the right it frequently goes into the Cava. AiiTERLas Adipose.—The Arteries which supply the Tunica Adiposa of the Kidney are numerous Twigs proceeding from the Diaphragmatic, Capsular, and Kenal Arteries, or from others near it. The Veins which return from the extremities of these Arteries pass into the Trunks adjacent. Arteria Spermatica.—The Spermatic Artery, the diameter of which is small when compared with its great length, arises opposite to its fellow, from the fore- part of the Aorta, a little below the Renal Arteries. Sometimes it arises from the Arteria Renalis, at other times a little higher from the Aorta, and in rarer in- stances, from the Diaphragmatic Artery. It descends, in a waving direction, on the Surface of the Psoas, behind the Peritoneum ; the right passing obliquely over the Cava, tlie left behind the Colic Arte- ries of the same side, and both before the Ureters, to the under part of the Abdomen. After this, it perforates the Ring of the Obliquus Externus, and runs in the Spermatic Cord, where it di- vides into Branches, which are dispersed, some upon the Epididymis, while others, larger and much convo- luted, run across the Surface of the Testicle, plunge into its Substance, and are distributed upon the Seminal Ducts. In the descent of the Artery, it imparts Twigs— To the Tunica Adiposa of the Kidney; To

176 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part Vlf. the Common Carotid Artery, to which it is closely united, being included along with it in the same com- mon Sheath of Cellular Substance. ' At the upper part of the Neck, it transmits a Branch, called Pharyngeus, to the Pharynx ; and immediately afterwards, a larger one, termed Laryngeus Superior, to the Larynx; and near the top of the Thorax, it sends a Filament, and sometimes two, to the Heart. The Pharyngeus, chiefly formed by the Pars Vaga, but partly also by a Branch from the Accessorius, is afterwards joined by Branches from the Glosso-Pharyn- geus, and descends obliquely over the Internal Carotid Artery. Near the origin of this Artery, it sends Filaments which join others from the upper part of the Great Sym- pathetic, and creep along the Common Carotid. Upon the middle ot the Pharynx, it expands into a Gangliform Plexus, from which many small Branches are sent out, to be distributed upon the three Constric- tors of the corresponding side of the Pharynx ; one or two Filaments uniting above with the Glosso-Pharyn- geus, and others below with the Laryngeus Superior. The Laryngeus Superior descends obliquely forwards between the Carotid Arteries and Pharynx ; and, be- hind the origin of the Carotids, is divided into a large Internal or Superior, and a small External or Inferior Branch. The Internal Branch passes forwards between the Os Hyoides and Superior Cornu of the Thyroid Cartilage. It divides into numerous Branches, some of which go to the Arytenoid Gland, and to the Arytenoideus Obli- quus

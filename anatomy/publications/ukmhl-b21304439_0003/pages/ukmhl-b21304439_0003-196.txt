. 8* COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [PartVJlL Below the First Vertebra of the Neck, this intimate connection between the Dura Mater and inner Liga- ment of the Vertebrae is discontinued ; a Cellular, Fatty, and Slimy Substance, which surrounds the Dura Mater throughout the rest of the Canal, being interposed be- tween that Membrane and the Ligament. The Dura Mater is only in contact with the Tunica Araehnoidea, and this also only in contact with the Pia Mater, and lying so loosely over it as to be separated from it with facility through the whole length of the Spine. 1â€™he Spinal Marrow, like the Brain, consists of a Cor- tical and Medullary Substance, but differs in this re- spect, that the Cincritious Matter is placed within the other. Upon the Surface of the Spinal Marrow, while lying in its natural situation, many Transverse Wrinkles or Folds are observed, which allow it to be extended in the motions of the Vertebrae. It is a little flattened on its anterior and posterior sur- faces, and is larger near the under part of the Neck, and at the top of the Loins, where the great Nerves of the Extremities are sent offj than in the other parts of the Spine. It is divided into two lateral Portions or Cords, which are separated from each other externally by an anterior and posterior Fissure continued from the Medulla Ob- longata j and each of the lateral Portions is in some measure subdivided by a superficial Furrow into a large Anterior and small posterior Cord, The

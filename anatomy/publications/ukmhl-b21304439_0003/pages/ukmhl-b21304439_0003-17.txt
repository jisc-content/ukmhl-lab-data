PartV.] OF THE BLOOD-VESSELS. 5 together, and formed into Layers, which can be sepa- rated from each other, especially in the Great Arteries, and still more particularly in those of large Animals. By the contractility of this, and the Elastic nature of the former Coat, the Arteries are enabled to drive the Blood to the Veins, in proportion as they receive it from the Heart;â€”and this Con traction is called the Systole of the Arteries. The Third, or Inner Coat, is formed of a transparent Membrane, remarkably thin, smooth, and dense, by which the Blood is prevented from transuding. The different Coats of the Arteries are connected to each oilier by fine Cellular Substance, which some Au- thors have considered as forming so many Lamellae. The Arteries are supplied with their own Blood-ves- sels, termed Vasa Vasorum, which come from the nearest small Branches, and are every where dispersed upon their external Surface. They have also their Lymphatics, which, on the Large Arteries, as the Aorta, are so numerous as sometimes to cover them. They are likewise furnished with small Nerves, form- ing, in some parts of the Body, a Plexus, which vanishes in their external Coat. There are no Valves belonging to the Arteries, ex- cepting those which are placed at the Mouths of the Pulmonary Artery and Aorta. V here the Arteries run a certain way without send- ing off Branches, they are observed to be of a Cylindri- cal form ; but where Branches come off, their capacity A 3 is

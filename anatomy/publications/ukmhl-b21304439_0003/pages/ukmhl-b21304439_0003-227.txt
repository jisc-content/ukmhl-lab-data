Part VII.] OF THE NERVES, 215 The Nerves of the two Fasciculi have several connec- tions with each other, about the Cardia, and along the small Curvature of the Stomach, and form a Plexus, by some Authors termed Coronary, from which Branches extend along the small Curvature, as far as the Pylorus. The Ramus Speanchnicus, and Sflanchnicus Se- cundarius, have their origins from the Sympathetics, and perforate the upper and lateral part of the inferior Muscle of the Diaphragm,â€”as already mentioned in the Description of the Nerves ,of the Thorax. After entering the Abdomen, they expand their Fi- bres, and incorporate with the lateral part of the Great Semilunar Ganglion. The Semilunar Ganglion is formed by the Rami Splanchnici of the Right and Left Sympathetics, with the addition of the Branches of the Eighth Pair. It is of a long curved shape, with the convex edge undermost, and is composed of many smaller Ganglia, termed Cccliac, which are of different sizes and of irre- gular forms. The Cceliac Ganglia arc placed over the Aorta, about the roots of the Coeliac and Superior Mesenteric Arteries, and extend some way upon the Fleshy Pillars of the Diaphragm. From the Coeliac Ganglia innumerable Nerves issue on all sides, forming a Plexus, termed by some Authors Solar, which extends along the Trunks and Branches of the Coeliac and Superior Mesenteric Arteries. The Nerves upon these Arteries are so intermixed with each other, and with Cellular Substance, as to form confused Webs-, the name of Plexus, however, is still O 4 retained,

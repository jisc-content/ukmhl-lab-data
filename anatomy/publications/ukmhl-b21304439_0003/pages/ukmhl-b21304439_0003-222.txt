210 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [PartVIL Small Branches which unite with others coming from the Trunk of the Great Cardiac Nerve, and pass over the Aorta to the Anterior Coronary Plexus. The Nervus Cardiacus Minor arises from the un- dermost Cervical Ganglion, creeps over the Arteria In- nominata and Aorta, and terminates in a Plexus formed by the Cardiac Nerves on the left side of the Aorta Asccndens. The Left Cardiac Nerves are, the Cardiacus Su- perficialis, and the Cardiacus Magnus Profundus. The Cardiacus Superficialis arises from the upper part of the Sympathetic Nerve, as formerly noticed, and passes behind the Arch of the Aorta to the Plexus Cardiacus Magnus. The Cardiacus Magnus Profundus Sinister, the upper portion of which is smaller than that of the right side, arises by numerous roots from the middle, and from the lowest Ganglion of the Sympathetic Nerve. It passes across the Arch of the Aorta, and, after receiving the Cardiac Branch of the Eighth Pair, joins the Great Cardiac of the right side, to assist in forming the Cardiac Plexus. From the Cardiac Plexus, a Reticulum of Nerves ex- tends upon the left side of the Ascending Aorta, which receives the Cardiacus Minor, and a Filament or two from the Cardiacus Magnus of the right side, going over the Aorta. From this Reticulum, the Anterior or Right Coro- nary Plexus is produced, which passes between the Pul- monary Artery and Aorta, and afterwards follows the course of the Trunk and Branches of the Right Coro- nary

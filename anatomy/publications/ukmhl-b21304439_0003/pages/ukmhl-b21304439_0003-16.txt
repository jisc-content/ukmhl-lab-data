4 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part V. The largest Arteries go to the Viscera, within the Great Cavities, the smaller ones to the Skin and Muscles, and those still smaller to the Bones, and, in certain places, they become so extremely minute as altogether to exclude the Red Blood, carrying a Colourless Fluid only. The Arteries are distinguished from the Veins, by the whiteness of their Colour, and thickness of their Coats. They are composed of different Layers or Coats, which are readily separated by Dissection. In several parts of the Body, as in the Posterior Me- diastinum, they are surrounded by a Membrane, com- mon to them and to the neighbouring Viscera. In other parts of the Body, especially in young Sub- jects, they are surrounded with so much Cellular Sub- stance, as to give them the appearance of being inclosed in Sheaths. The first of the proper Coats is the External Mem- branous, or Cellular, called also by some Authors the Nervous Coat. In the large Arteries, this Coat is frequently furnish- ed with Fat, and is of a very elastic nature. Owing to this Elasticity, the Arteries, in receiving the Blood from the Heart, become dilated and elongated, and start from their place, which forms the Pulse, called also the Dias- tole of the Arteries. The Second, or Middle, or Muscular Coat, is com- posed of Fibres running in a Transverse direction,—of a pale red colour •,—each Fibre appearing to form only the Segment of a Circle, although the whole constitutes a Cylinder round the Artery. The Fibres of the Second Coat are closely compacted together^

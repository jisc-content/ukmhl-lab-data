102 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part V. rest, reaching almost as far as the outer part of the Knee. The Profunda Femoris, having detached the Circum- flex Arteries, sinks deep behind the Trunk of the Fe- moralis, and, passing between the Abductor Muscles and Vastus Internus, descends near to the middle of the 1 high. In its descent, it sends off, or is divided into principal Branches, termed Rami Perforantcs> which, after giv- ing out small Branches to the Triceps, perforate it, to be dispersed upon the Flexors and other Muscles on the back part of the Thigh. 1 he Perforates come off in the following succes- sion, viz. The Per/orans Prima, which arises near the Trochan- ter Minor, perforates the Triceps a little farther down, am turnishes Branches to the Muscles in the upper and back part of the Thigh. It forms numerous communications with the Circum- flex Arteries, about the root of the Trochanter Major, and anastomoses in particular with the under end of the Sciatica: The Perforans Sccunda or Magna, which comes off some way below the former, and is the largest of the perforating Arteries. It gives Branches to the Muscles in general about the middle of the back part of the Thigh, particularly to the Adductors, Vasti, and to the Flexors of the Leg; and communicates above with Branches of the Pcrfo- rans Prima, and with the Circumflex Arteries. Besides these, there is one, and sometimes two other perforating

H6 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part VI. From the Axillary Glands large Branches go under the Subclavian Muscle, and form a Trunk, which, in the left side, commonly joins the Thoracic Duct near its termination. In the right side, it joins the Short Trunk which forms the Second General Termination of the Absorbent System. Sometimes this Trunk, pro- ceeding from the Superior Extremity, terminates in the Subclavian Vein, at a little distance from the General Termination. Sometimes two Trunks arise from the Axillary Glands in each side, in which case one goes to the end of the Thoracic Duct, or the corresponding Trunk in the right side, while the other terminates in the Subcla- vian Vein. The Axillary Glands receive also the Subcutaneous Lymphatics from the back part of the Thorax, together with the Lymphatics from the Integuments and Muscles of the Scapula. The Lymphatics on the outside of the Head accom- pany the Blood-vessels, and pass through Glands in their way to the Neck. Those accompanying the Temporal Artery go through small Glands connected with the Parotid Gland, and also through others situated immediately under the root of the Zygoma. The Lymphatics which accompany the Occipital Blood-vessels penetrate one or two minute Glands placed a little behind the root of the Ear, and over the Mas- toid Process of the Temporal Bone. The Lymphatics proceeding from the different parts of

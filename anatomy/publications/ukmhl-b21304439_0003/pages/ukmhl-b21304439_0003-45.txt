Part V.] OF THE BLOOD-VESSELS. S3 turns upwards, perforates the Dura Mater, and enters i the Cavity of the Cranium. After entering the Cranium, it passes with the Me- dulla Oblongata, upon the Cuneiform Process of the Occipital Bone, inclining towards its fellow on the other side; and at the beginning of the Medulla, the two Vertebrals unite into the Trunk called Basilar Ar~ tcry. Upon entering the Skull, each Vertebral Artery sends a small Branch, termed Arteria Meningea Posterior, to the posterior part of the Dura Mater, which communi- cates by small Branches with the other Arteries of this Membrane. It then disperses Twigs to the Medulla Oblongata, and frequently gives off the small Branch which forms one of the Posterior Arteries of the Spinal Marrow. Near the part where it unites with its fellow, it sends down the Anterior Artery of the Spinal Marrow, which, with the Posterior Arteries of tills Substance, will be afterwards described. From the Vertebral, or from the Basilar, or some- times from each, a principal Branch is sent off, named Arteria Cerebclli Posterior vel Inferior, which passes be- tween the Cerebellum and Medulla Oblongata, and fur- nishes Branches to the under part of the Cerebellum, to the back part of the Medulla Oblongata and Tuber Annulare, and forms the Choroid Plexus of the fourth Ventricle. The Basilar Artery runs along the middle of the Tuber Annulare, which it slightly impresses, and lies upon the Cuneiform Process of the Os Occipitis $ hav- Vol. III.

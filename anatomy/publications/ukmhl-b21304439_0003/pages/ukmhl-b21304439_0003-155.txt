Part. VI.] OF THE ABSORBENTS. . u$ This Trunk terminates at length in the upper end of the Thoracic Duct. The Thoracic Duct, after receiving numerous Lym- phatics within the Thorax, and having reached as high as the third or fourth Dorsal Vertebra, passes obliquely over to the leftside of the Spine, behind the Esophagus, and end of the Arch of the Aorta or beginning of the Aorta Dcscendens, till it reaches the Left Carotid Ar- tery. After this, it emerges from the Thorax, and runs be- tween the Longus Colli and Internal Jugular Vein, to about the Sixth Vertebra of the Neck. It now makes a turn downwards, and, after descend- ing near an inch, terminates in the upper and back part of the angle formed by the Left Internal Jugular and Subclavian Veins. Throughout its whole course, it has a waving appear- ance, and this becomes more conspicuous in proportion as it is distended by Injection. Near the middle ot the Thorax, it not unfrequently splits into two or more Branches, and sometimes forms a Plexus, the Branches of which again unite into a common Trunk a little higher up. After emerging from the Thoi;ax, it commonly di- vides into two parts, which unite again previous to the termination of the Duct in the Red Veins ; and where there is no division, there is generally a Dilatation or Sac at the Termination. Sometimes there is one termination in the Angle formed by the Red Veins, and one or two in the Sub- clavian

168 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part VII. it distributes Filaments to the different Teeth of the corresponding side, and to the Substance of the Bone } and coming out of the Canal by the Anterior Maxil- lary Foramen, somewhat diminished in size, it scat- ters its remaining Branches upon the Chin and Under Lip. The Sixth Pair, or Arducentes, arise from the beginning of the Medulla Oblongata, at the part com- mon to the Tuber Annulare and Corpora Pyramidalia, and are the smallest of the Cerebral Nerves, the Fourth Pair excepted. They perforate the Dura Mater at the inner side of the entrance of the Fifth Pair, and run forwards within the Cells of the Cavernous Sinus, but so surrounded by Cellular Substance, as to seen^to be protected from the Blood of that Receptacle. While in the Sinus Cavcrnosi, they are situated be- tween the Ophthalmic Nerves and Carotid Arteries, upon the Surface of the latter of which they send off two or three Filaments on each side of the Head, to assist in forming the Great Sympathetic Nerves. The Trunks of the Sixth Pair afterwards go through the Foramina Lacera, to be dispersed entirely upon the Abductores Oculorum. The Seventh Pair is composed, on each side, of two portions,â€”the Nervus Auditoriusy Nervus AcusticuSy or Portio Mollisand the Communicans 1'acieiy or For- tio Dura. The Portio Mollis is the softest of the Nerves, ex- cepting the Olfactory. It arises by transverse Medullary Striae from the ante- rior

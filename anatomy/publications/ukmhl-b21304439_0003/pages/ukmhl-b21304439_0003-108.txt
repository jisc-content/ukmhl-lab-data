iiS COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part V. It afterwards descends some way down the Thigh, in company with the Sciatic Nerve, in the hollow be- tween the great Trochanter of the Thigh-bone and Tuber of the Ischium,—covered by the Gluteus Maxi- mus. Within the Pelvis, it sends Twigs, to the Rectum, Obturator Internus, and Pyriformis. Without the Pelvis, it sends an Artery backwards, termed Coccjgca, which creeps along the Posterior Sacro-Sciatic Liga- ment ; some of its Branches perforating the Fibres of the Ligament. It is distributed upon the Coccygcus, the Levator Ani, the Fat and Bones of the Coccyx, and sends Branches upwards which anastomose with some of the Lateral Sacral Arteries, through the Holes in the back part of the Os Sacrum. It next gives off a Concomitant Branch, which passes along the Surface of the Sciatic Nerve. It sends Branches to the Gluteus Mcdius and Mini- mus, to the Pyriformis and other Rotator Muscles of the Thigh, and to the Capsule of die Joint. The principal Branches of the Sciatic Artery, how- ever, are dispersed upon the under part of the Gluteus Maximus, some Twigs being sent to the Muscles arising from the Tuberosity of the Os Ischium, which commu- nicate with the Obturator and Pudic Arteries. Iliaca Externa. The Iliaca Externa, which appears in the Adult as’ the continuation of the common Trunk, descends along the Brim of the Pelvis, behind the Peritoneum, taking a

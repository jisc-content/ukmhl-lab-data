133 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part VI. most frequently terminate in the upper end of the Tho- racic Duct;—sometimes, however, they communicate with the general termination on the right side of the Neck. When they accompany the Internal Mammary Ves- sels, they are observed to terminate, the left in the Tho- racic Duct, and the right in the general termination of that side. The Lymphatics on the concave Surface of the Liver run towards the Porta, and join the Deep-seated Set.— One part of them goes over the under Surface of the Gall-bladder, from which they derive numerous small Branches. The Deep-seated Lymphatics accompany the Blood and Biliary Vessels, and, communicating with the Su- perficial Absorbents already mentioned, they pass through several Glands situated about the Trunk of the Vena Portae, and terminate in the Thoracic Duct near the Root of the Superior Mesenteric Artery. The Superficial Lymphatics of the Spleen are re- markably small. They pass from its convex to its con- cave Surface, where they join the Deep-seated Lym- phatics, which are very considerable in size and number. The Splenic Plexus of Lymphatics accompany the Splenic Artery, and go through several Glands of a dark colour, scattered along the Surface of that Vessel. The Lymphatics of the Spleen receive those of the Pancreas, which run into them in a transverse direc- tion. In their course, they unite with the Lymphatics of the

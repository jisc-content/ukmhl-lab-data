COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part V. The Facial Veiti, which is formed by the Frontal Vein, and by an intricate Plexus of Branches upon the Face. It winds obliquely downwards and outwards, at a distance from the Artery ; but, in crossing the Jaw, it goes close by the outside of it, and terminates in the External Jugular Vein : The Temporal Vein, formed by Superficial and Deep Branches from the sides and upper part of the Head, and running down upon the Temple, at some distance from the Artery. The Branches of the Temporal Vein form large An- astomoses ; before, with those of the Frontal Vein ; a4- bove, with their Fellows on the other side $ and be- hind, with the Branches of the Occipital Vein. The Trunk descends at the fore part of the Ear, and, along with the Artery, sinks in the Substance of the Parotid Gland. In its descent before the Meatus Auditorius Externus, it receives Branches from the Ear, Parotid Gland, and Cheek, corresponding with those sent to these parts from the Carotid, or Temporal Artery. At the under part of the Lower Jaw, the Facial and % Temporal Veins commonly unite and form the External Jugular. The External Jugular Vein receives the following Branches at the upper part of the Neck, viz. Branches of the Internal Maxillary Vein, the princi- pal part terminating in the Internal Jugular : The Lingual Vein, which more frequently terminates in the Internal Jugular : Some Branches from the Occipital Vein, the rest passing

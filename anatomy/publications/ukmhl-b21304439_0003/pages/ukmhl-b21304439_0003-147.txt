At other times they descend a little, and join the Trunks from the Inferior Extremities, to form that Duct. The Absorbents of the Great arc of an inferior size in proportion to those of the Small Intestines, and have seldom, though sometimes, been observed to be filled with Chyle. In their course, they go through the Meso-colic Glands, which are situated between the Layers of the Meso-colon, but are generally much less numerous and considerably smaller than those of the Mesentery, or of most other parts of the Body. The Absorbents of the Ceecirn, and of the Right loca - tion of the Colon, join those of the Small Intestines, about the root of the Mesentery. j Those of the Left Portion of the Colon accompany the Inferior Mesenteric Artery, and communicate with large Lymphatics near its root. They terminate at last in the Lumbar Glands, or go directly into the lower part of the Thoracic Duct. Of the Absorbents of the Stomach, one Set runs upon its Small, and another upon its Great Curvature ; but neither the one nor the other are found to carry Chyle, though a few Absorbents have been observed filled with it in other Animals,â€”as the Dog. The first Set, composed of Branches from the upper and under Surfaces of the Stomach, accompany the Su- perior Coronary Artery. In their passage, they go through a few small Glands situated at the junction of the Omentum Minus with the 14 Stomach,

Part V.] OF THE BLOOD-VESSELS. 31 The continuation of the Anterior Cerebral Artery is termed Arteria Corporis Callosi, and is reflected back upon the union of the Corpus Callosum and Hemi- sphere as far as the Posterior Lobe of the Brain. The Branches of the Anterior Cerebral Artery are divided into minute Ramifications, which are first spread out upon the flat Surface of the Hemisphere, and after- wards upon its upper part. The Ramifications form numberless Anastomoses with each other upon the Surface of the Brain, and after- wards pass, by minute Filaments, into its Cortical and Medullary Substance. Besides the Anastomoses of the different Branches of this Artery on the Surface of the Hemisphere, small Branches run across the Corpus Callosum, and inoscu- late with those of the opposide side. The Arteria Media Cerebri,—termed also Arte- ria Sylvian a, which is larger than the former,—runs outwards in a lateral direction through the Fossa of Sylvius, to the upper part of the Brain. It gives first Filaments to the Glandula Pituitaria and parts adjacent to it, and then divides into principal Branches; of which one Set go to the Anterior, and the other to the Lateral and part of the Posterior Lobe of the Brain. From this Artery, one or two Twigs run up into the Anterior Cornu of the Lateral Ventricle, and assist in forming the Choroid Plexus of that Cavity. Upon the outer Surface of the Brain, the Branches of this Artery inosculate with each other, and with those pf the Anterior Cerebral Artery, and then plunge into the

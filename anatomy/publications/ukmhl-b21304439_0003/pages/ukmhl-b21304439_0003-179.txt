167 Part VII.] OF THE NERVES. Branches to the Masseter, Pterygoideus, and Bucci- nator : A Branch, which passes behind the Cervix of the Lower Jaw, and gives off Filaments to the fore part of the Ear, and afterwards accompanies the Temporal Ar- tery upon the side of the Head, where it terminates: A Branch to the Buccinator, and other parts of the Cheek. A Nerve of considerable size, termed Lingual or Grns- tatorius, which passes between the Pterygoidci, to the inner of which it gives some FiNpients. It then sends off, from its under side, a Ganglion which transmits Nerves to the Inferior Maxillary Gland. The Lingual Nerve also transmits several Branches to the Sublingual Gland, and to the Muscles of the Tongue. It terminates, at length, upon the upper and fore part of the Tongue, but more particularly upon its point, by many Branches which belong chiefly to the Papillae ; in consequence of which, this Branch is considered as the principal Nerve of the Organ of Taste. The Trunk of the Inferior Maxillary Nerve, having- parted with the Lingual Nerve, directs its course be- tween the Pterygoid Muscles to the Posterior Foramen of the Inferior Maxillary Canal. Before entering the Canal, it sends off a long and slender Branch, which is lodged at first in a Furrow of the Bone, and goes afterwards to be dispersed chiefly upon the Mylo-PIyoideus and Sublingual Gland. The Trunk of the Nerve is afterwards conducted along the Canal of the Jaw under the Alveoli, where I. 1. it

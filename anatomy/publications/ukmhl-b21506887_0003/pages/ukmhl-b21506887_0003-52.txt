%% COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part V. The Arteria Lacrymalis, which runs at the outside of the Orbit, and is chiefly dispersed upon the Lacry- mal Gland ; some Threads advancing to the Eye-lids : one Twig goes to the Periosteum of the Orbit, and another through the Cheek-bone to the Face. The Arteria Centralis Retinas, which penetrates the Optic Nerve a little behind the Ball of the Eye, runs in the Axis of the Nerve, and spreads out into many small Branches upon the inside of the Retina. When the Nerve is cut across near the Ball of the Eye, the Orifice of the divided Central Artery is ob- servable, which, before its nature was understood, was known by the name of Porus Opticus. In an Adult, the Central Artery appears to termi- nate entirely upon the Retina; but in a Foetus, after furnishing, at the bottom of the Orbit, the Branches proper to the Retina, the Trunk is continued forwards through the Axis of the Vitreous Humour, supplying its Cells and Membrane with delicate Filaments, and afterwards spreading out upon the back part of the Capsule of the Lens. Its Branches are dispersed upon the Lens in a ra- diated manner, and, after surrounding it, some of them are sent forwards to the Membrana Pupillaris. These Branches have been distinctly seen by the Author, af- ter throwing in a fine Injection into the Ocular Ar- tery, previously to the seventh Month of Gestation : The Arterice Ciliares, three or sometimes more in number, which separate into Branches running in a serpentine direction along the opposite sides of the Optic Nerve, and dividing into the Ciliares Breves, and Ciliares Longae.

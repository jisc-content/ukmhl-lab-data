306 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part IX. Spongy Bones; and shew the different parts connected with the Nares.—See Vol. II. p. 105. Dissect next the Muscles contiguous to the Anterior part of the Vertebrae of the Neck,—Vol. I. p. 238, and also the three Musculi Scaleni.—Vol. I. p. 251. Dissection of the Muscles situated upon the Posterior Part of the Trunk of the Body.— Vol. I. p. 240. Tab. XI. In the Dissection of these Muscles, their connexions are found to be so complicated, and their fibres so in- termixed, that in many parts they cannot be separated from each other without using considerable freedom with a Knife. Remove the Integuments from the posterior part of the Neck, Backhand Loins, after which the Trapezius, Latissimus Dorsi, and part of the Rhomboideus, will appear. Here the Cellular Substance is detached with some difficulty, on account of its close connexion with the surface of the Muscles, but ought to be entirely se- parated from them, to shew them distinctly. Turn back the Trapezius from the Head and Spine. Cut the Latissimus Dorsi from within an inch of the origin of its Fleshy Fibres, and turn it back, to expose the Serratus Inferior. Then remove from the Spine, and turn outwards, the Tendon sometimes called Fascia Lumborum, common to the Serratus and Latissimus Dorsi. Turn back the Rhomboideus from the Spine, and also the Serratus Superior, which requires attention, on

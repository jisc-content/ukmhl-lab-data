182 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part VII. Second Pair. The Second Pair, or Optic Nerves, which are of great size, arise from the posterior and inferior part of the Thalami Optici, and here they have the name of Tractus Optici ; or, according to the opinion of some Authors, they have their origin from the Nates and Testes, and are connected in their passage to Tubercles, on the under part of the Thalami, at the root of the Infundibulum, which furnish them with an addition of Medullary Substance. They are of a Cylindrical form, and of a purer white than other Nerves, having less Cineritious Matter entering their composition; and differ also in the Pia Mater furnishing them with a general Covering, be- fore it invests the several Fasciculi of which they are formed. At the fore part of the Sella Turcica the Tractus Optici unite, have their Medullary Parts intimately in- termixed, and afterwards form the Optic Nerves strict- ly so called. Some consider the Optic Nerves as taking their origin from the union of the Tractus Optici. From this union they go obliquely outwards and for- wards through the Foramina Optica into the Orbits; and advancing now in a waving direction, to prevent them from being overstretched in the motions of the vEye, they perforate the Balls, to be expanded into the Retinae,â€”which have been already described. The Optic Nerves differ from all others in this respect, that they are neither connected with any other Nerves by Branches, nor do they exhibit any Ramifications.

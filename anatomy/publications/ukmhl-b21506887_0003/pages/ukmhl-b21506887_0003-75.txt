Part V.] OF THE BLOOD-VESSELS. 55 edge of the Subscapularis, and upon the Pectoralis and Serratus. The External Thoracic Arteries are frequently found to correspond with the description given above ; but it may be at the same time noticed, that they vary much in their number, origin, course, and termination, in different individuals. In general, however, they come off from the Axillary Artery, by Branches separate or united, and supply the parts about the top of the Shoul- der, and upper and outer lateral parts of the Thorax; anastomosing above with the Arteries of the Neck, and below with those belonging to the containing parts of the Chest, and to the Upper Arm. SCAPULARIS INTERNA. The Scapularis Interna, vel Subscapulars, vel Scapular is Communis, which is the largest of the Axillary Branches, arises at the under edge of the Sub- scapularis Muscle, and soon divides into the proper Scapularis Interna, and the Dorsalis Scapulae Inferior: The Scapularis Interna, strictly so called, runs near the inferior edge of the Scapula, and sends off many large Branches, the principal part of which are dispersed upon the Latissimus Dorsi, Teres Major, and Subscapularis. It sends Branches also to the Muscles arising from the Coracoid Process, to the Capsular Li- gament of the Joint of the Humerus, and to the Axillary Glands, which have large Anastomoses with each other, and with the Superior Dorsal Artery of the Scapula. The Dorsalis Scapula Inferior, vel Circum- flexa Scapularis, immediately after leaving the Inter-

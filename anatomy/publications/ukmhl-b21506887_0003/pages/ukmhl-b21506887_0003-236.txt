204 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part VII. The Superficial Cardiac Nerve of the Sympathetic, in the right side, divides into Branches at the bottom of the Neck, which send a Filament or two along the Inferior Laryngeal Artery to the Thyroid Gland, and afterwards unite with the Superficial Cardiac Nerve of the Eighth Pair before the Subclavian Artery, and with the Laryngeal Nerve behind it.—In the left side, the Superficial Cardiac terminates in the Cardiac Plex- us of Nerves. From the Second, Third, and Fourth Cervical Nerves, an equal number of Cords descend behind the Scaleni and Rectus Major, to the middle Ganglion of the Great Sympathetic. From the opposite side of this Ganglion, Branches are sent down, which join and form the Nervus Magnus Profundus; others are fixed to the Superficial Cardiac, and to the Recurrent of the Eighth Pair. The rest go partly over and partly behind the Subclavian Ar- tery, to the Inferior Cervical, and to the first Thoracic Ganglion. Nervi Accessorii ad Par Octavum. The Nervi Accessorii arise by a series of small Filaments from the lateral parts of the Medulla Ob- longata and Cervical portion of the Spinal Marrow. The Filaments from the Spinal Marrow come off be- tween the Anterior and Posterior Bundles of the Cer- vical Nerves,—the first of them frequently extending as far as the space between the Sixth and Seventh Pairs. The lowest Filaments are short, and lie close to the Spinal Marrow, those higher extend more outwards,

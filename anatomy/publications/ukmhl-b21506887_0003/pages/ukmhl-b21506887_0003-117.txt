At the side of the Pelvis, the Internal divides into many Branches, some of which belong to the Organs of Urine and Generation, the rest to other parts of the Pelvis and adjacent parts of the Thigh. The following are the Branches sent from the Hypo- gastric Artery to the Organs of Urine and Generation. Arteria Umbilicalis. The Arteria Umbilicalis appears in a Foetus, as the continued Trunk of the Internal Iliac ; but in an Adult, is shrivelled into a Ligament, excepting at its beginning or under part. The beginning of the Umbilical Artery gives offâ€” One or more, but most frequently two, Arteria* Ve- sicates, which run to the under part of the Bladder, and extend along its sides as far as the Fundus Vesica?.

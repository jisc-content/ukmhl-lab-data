234 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part VII. The Posterior Pulmonary Nerves, like the Anterior, follow the Branches of the Bronchi and Blood-vessels in the Substance of the Lungs, and, becoming gra- dually smaller, send off minute Twigs, which pene- trate the Air-vessels, and are ultimately dispersed upon their Internal Membrane. After giving out the Pulmonary Nerves, the Pars Vaga is split into Cords, termed Great Esophageal Plexus, which surrounds the Esophagus, sends Fila- ments into its Substance, and is joined by Funiculi of the Pars Vaga of the opposite side.â€”It goes afterwards through the Diaphragm, to be distributed upon the Viscera of the Abdomen. Nervus Sympatheticus, and Cardiac Nerves. From the Ganglia of the Great Sympathetic Nerve, at the bottom of the Neck, and top of the Thorax, the principal Cardiac Nerves are produced, which are dis- persed upon the Heart, while the continuation of the Trunk of the Sympathetic descends in the Thorax at the side of the Vertebrae. The Cardiac Nerves of the Right Side consist of the Cardiacus Magnus Profundus, and Cardiacus Minor: the latter of which is termed by Scarpa, Cardiacus Aorta? Superficialis. The Cardiacus Magnus Profundus is principally formed by Branches from the Second Cervical Ganglion of the Sympathetic, and afterwards receives one or two Filaments from the Cardiacus Supremus, together with the Superficial Cardiac and other Branches of the Eighth Pair, as formerly described.

Part VII.] OF THE NERVES. 227 cranon of the Ulna. Here the seat of the Nerve, as well as its course, is sometimes severely felt, after receiving a stroke upon this part of the Elbow. From this it passes to the Fore-arm, where, after perforating the Heads of the Flexor Muscles, it joins the Ulnar Artery a little below its origin, and accom- panies that Vessel,â€”running behind it in its course to the Hand. Under the Axilla, it sometimes receives a Branch from the Spiral Nerve; and from this connexion, or from the Trunk of the Ulnar Nerve itself, a Subcuta- neous Branch is sent off, which runs between the Tri- ceps and Integuments ; furnishing Branches to the lat- ter for a considerable way along the Fore-arm. Near the under end of the Os Humeri, a Twig or two commonly go to the inner end of the Triceps. Under the bending of the Elbow, a Branch is given out to be dispersed upon the Belly of the Flexor Ulnaris. Immediately below the former, another Branch is produced, which is distributed upon the Flexor Pro- fundus Digitorum. About the middle of the Fore-arm, a Filament is transmitted, which adheres to the Ulnar Artery, fur- nishing small Twigs to the Sheath and Coats of that Vessel, and terminating in the corresponding parts of the Wrist, and Integuments of the Palm. Near the end of the Ulna, a considerable Branch, termed Dorsalis, is sent out, which, turning between the Bone and the Flexor Ulnaris, is directed to the back part of the Hand. The DorsalNerve sends Branches to the Integuments p 2

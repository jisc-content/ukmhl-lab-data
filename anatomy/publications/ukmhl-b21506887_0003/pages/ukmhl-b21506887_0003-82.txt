m COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part V. One, or sometimes two Branches, termed Dorsal, to the back part of the Metacarpus, Thumb, and Fingers. At the under part of the Fore-arm, the Radial Ar- tery turns back between the Tendons of the Extensors of the Thumb, and the Bones of the Wrist;â€”then, getting between the roots of the Metacarpal Bones of the Thumb and Fore-finger, and perforating the Ab- ductor Indicis, it divides into three principal Branches, viz. The Arteria Magna Pollicis, which runs along the side of the Thumb next the Fingers, and sometimes divides at the root of the former into two Branches, which supply both sides of it: The Radialis Indicis, which runs along the side of the Fore-finger next the Thumb : The Palmaris Profunda, which crosses the Hand between the roots of the Metacarpal Bones and Flexors of the Fingers, and forms an Arcus Profundus, from which Branches go off to the Interossei and other deep parts of the Palm. Ulnaris. The Ulnaris, somewhat larger than the Radialis, is found at the anterior and inner part of the Fore-arm. It appears at first as the continuation of the Trunk of the Humeral Artery. At its upper part it sinks deep behind the Pronator Teres, Flexor Carpi Radialis, Palmaris Longus, and Flexor Digitorum Sublimis, and passes afterwards, for some way, between the Flexores Sublimis et Profundus Digitorum. When its origin is in the Upper Arm, it

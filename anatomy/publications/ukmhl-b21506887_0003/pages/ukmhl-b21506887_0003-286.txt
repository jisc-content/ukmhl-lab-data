254 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part VII. Anterior Sacral Nerves. Of the Five Anterior Sacrals the two uppermost are the largest; the rest suddenly diminish in size, the last being the smallest of the Spinal Nerves. The Third is only about half the size of the Second ; the Fourth, half the size of the Third ; and the Fifth, half the size of the Fourth. They go through the Holes in the fore part of the Os Sacrum, and, soon after their exit, are united with each other, and with Branches of the Sympathetic Nerve. The First, Second, and Third Sacral Nerves. The First, Second, and Third Sacrals, join into a Trunk, which receives the common one sent down from the Fourth and Fifth Lumbars, and forms a Plexus which sends out the Sciatic, the largest Nerve in the Body. The roots of the Sciatic Nerve give origin to the Fasciculi which compose the Pudic Nerve, formerly de- scribed, and also the Gluteal Nerves which are dispers- ed upon the Muscles of the Hips. Nervi Glutei. The Gluteal Nerves run in two Fasciculi, a Su- perior, arising immediately from the Trunk formed by the two last Lumbars, and an Inferior, coming off from the two last Lumbars and first Sacral.

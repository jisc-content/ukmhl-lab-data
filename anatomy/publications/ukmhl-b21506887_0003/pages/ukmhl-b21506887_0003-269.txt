Part VIL] OF THE NERVES. across it to the Right Coronary Plexus, give origin to the Coronary Plexus of the left side, which attends the Trunk and Branches of the Left Coronary Artery. In the Left or Posterior Coronary Plexus, the Nerves are larger than in the Right, corresponding with the parts they have to supply ; and the Plexuses have re- peated connexions with each other on the Surface of the Heart. In general, the Nerves run close to the Arteries; some of them being continued as far as the Apex, while others penetrate the Substance of the Heart. Sympathetic Nerve continued. The Great Sympathetic, having produced the prin- cipal Cardiac Nerves, consists of an anterior and poste- rior part,-^the former going over, and the latter under the Subclavian Artery, where they unite into a Trunk, which descends into the Thorax over the Heads of the Ribs. At the Head of each Rib, it forms a small flat Gan- glion of an irregular shape, which unites behind with each of the Intercostal Nerves, generally by two, and sometimes by three short Branches. From several of the Dorsal Ganglia of this Nerve, Filaments are detached obliquely over the Vertebrae to the Coats of the Aorta. Nervus Splanchnicus. From the Sixth, Seventh, and Eighth Dorsal Gan- glia,â€”and frequently from a Ganglion above or below

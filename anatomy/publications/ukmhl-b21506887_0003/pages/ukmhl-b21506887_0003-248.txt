216 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part VII. Gangliform Semi-pellucid Root, with the upper Gan- glion of the Sympathetic Nerve, sending a Branch downwards, to be fixed to the second Cervical Nerve, and also small Branches to the Muscles connected with the fore part of the Vertebras. The other, which is the principal part, goes back- wards, and, after sending Branches to the Extensors of the Head and Neck, perforates these, and forms the Proper Occipital Nerve. The Occipital Nerve ascends upon the Head with the Artery of that name, and terminates upon the Muscles and Integuments upon the upper and back part of the Cranium ; some of its Filaments anastomosing with others belonging to the First Branch of the Fifth and Portio Dura of the Seventh Pair, Second Cervical Nerve. The Second Cervical Nerve, after escaping from between the Bones, gives off a Branch which perfo- rates the Muscles connected to the fore and lateral parts of the Vertebras, and joins the middle Ganglion of the Sympathetic Nerve. It sends another Branch of considerable size down- wards to the Trunk of the Third Cervical Nerve. It sends several Branches to the Sterno-mastoideus, behind which it is connected by an Arch, and still far- ther out by a Filament, with the Nervus Accessorius. It is afterwards divided into several Branches; one of which passes downwards some way upon the Exter- nal Jugular Vein, and, together with a Branch from

Â£68 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part VIII. Classes, according to their Fabric, or to the Liquor they secrete. The most general division is the original one of Syl- vius into Conglobate and Conglomerate, the former of a roundish shape, and belonging to the Lymphatic Sys- tem ; the latter formed into Lobes, and these into Lo- bules, that are composed of still smaller Corpuscles^ and the Lobules having proper Ducts, into which the secreted Liquor is discharged ; or they are formed of small Corpuscles, or little Kernels, termed Acini, col- lected into a Mass. Winslow retains this division, but makes a subdivi- sion of the Conglomerate, into Simple and Compound Glands. Malpighi adds what he calls the Simple Glands, or Simple Folliculous Glands, as those in the Fauces, &c. To the above some add Conglutinate, Congregate, Vesicular, Vascular, and Anonymous. Some divide them according to the Fluids they dis- charge, viz. the Lymphatic, Secretory, and Anonymous, which discharge every species of secreting Substance. Or they are divided, according to their Fabric, into Simple, Conglobate, and Compound or Conglomerate. The First of these consist of hollow Follicles, Mu- cous Sinuses, or Cylindrical Mucous Fistulae, inclosed in a proper Membrane, and having no Excretory Duct. In this Class are included the Mucous Follicles of the Nose, Fauces, Intestines, &c. When these are se- parate, they are termed Simplices Solitariae, and when collected into a group, they are called Simplices Aggre- gate. The Second Class includes the Conglobate Glands

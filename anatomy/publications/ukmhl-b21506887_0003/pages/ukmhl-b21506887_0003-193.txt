Part VI.] OF THE ABSORBENTS. 167 From the Axillary Glands large Branches go under the Subclavian Muscle, and form a Trunk, which, in the left side, commonly joins the Thoracic Duct near its termination. In the right side, it joins the short Trunk which forms the second General Termination of the Absorbent System. Sometimes this Trunk, proceeding from the Superior Extremity, terminates in the Subclavian Vein, at a little distance from the general termination. Sometimes two Trunks arise from the Axillary Glands in each side, in which case one goes to the end of the Thoracic Duct, or the corresponding Trunk in the right side, while the other terminates in the Subcla- vian Vein. Absorbents of the Head and Neck. The Lymphatics on the outside of the Head accom- pany the Blood-vessels, and pass through Glands in their way to the Neck. Those accompanying the Temporal Artery go through small Glands connected with the Parotid Gland, and also through others situated immediately under the root of the Zygoma. The Lymphatics which accompany the Occipital Blood-vessels penetrate one or two minute Glands placed a little behind the root of the Ear, and over the Mastoid Process of the Temporal Bone. The Lymphatics proceeding from the different parts of the Face, accompany the Branches and Trunk of the Facial Artery,

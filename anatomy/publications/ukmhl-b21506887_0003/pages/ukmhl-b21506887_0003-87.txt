Part V.] OF THE BLOOD-VESSELS. 67 form also considerable Anastomoses with the deep-seat- ed Veins. The Superficial Veins from the back of the Hand, (one of which, belonging to the Little Finger, was termed by the Ancients Salvatelld), go chiefly to the Superficial Radial and Ulnar Veins, and to the Vein termed Mediana Longa. The Superficial Radial Veins run principally to a Vein termed Cephalica, and the Superficial Ulnar Veins to one named Basilica, at the Joint of the Elbow. The Superficial Veins on the anterior part of the Fore-arm form a Plexus which communicates laterally with the Radial and Ulnar Veins, and particularly with the Trunk of the Mediana Longa. From this Plexus an Internal Median Trunk, or a Mediana Longa Minor, is commonly formed, which terminates in the Basilica. Mediana Longa. The Mediana Longa, vel Mediana Longa Ma- jor, arises by numerous Branches from the back of the Hand and root of the Thumb, and communicates with the Vena Salvatella. That from the root of the Thumb has been termed Cephalica Pollicis, though it goes in- to the Median Vein. The Long Median Vein crosses over the Radius in a slanting direction, and, a little below the bending of the Elbow, is divided into two short Veins, the Mediana Cephalica and Mediana Basilica, which, running ob- liquely upwards, terminate a little above the Elbow, the former in the Cephalic, and the latter, crossing over the Humeral Artery, in the Basilic Vein.

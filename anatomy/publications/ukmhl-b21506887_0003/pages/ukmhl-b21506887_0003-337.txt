Part VIII.] OF THE GLANDS. 267 opinions are entertained;â€”the most prevalent are those of Malpighi and Ruysch. According to the idea of the former Author, Glands contain Acini, the extreme Arteries of which terminate partly in corresponding Veins, and partly in Corpora Globosa, Cryptse, or little Follicles, from the opposite sides of which Excretory Ducts are sent out. In the Mamma, after a minute Injection, the Follicu- lous appearance is more distinct than in other Glands. In the Liver it is much less so. In the Salivary Glands there is an appearance like the Cells of the Lungs, the Follicles seeming to communicate and to open into Ducts, as the Cells do into the Branches of the Tra- chea. According to Ruysch, the Arteries in the Glands, wonderfully convoluted, terminate, partly in Red Veins and partly in Excretory Ducts, without the interven- tion of Follicles ; and he asserts, that the Follicles de^ scribed by Malpighi may, by a good Injection, be en- tirely converted into Vessels, and all of these having a Cylindrical form. Of the two opinions mentioned above, that of Ruysch appears to have gained most advocates, though the question is certainly by no means yet sufficiently de- cided ; nor does it even seem to be more so than when it was at first proposed. Most of the English Authors consider the Glands to be a composition of Arteries convoluted, or not convo- luted, from the extremities, or sides of which, but par- ticularly from the former, the Excretory Ducts are sup- posed to arise, so as to receive the proper Juices. The Glands are divided by Authors into different

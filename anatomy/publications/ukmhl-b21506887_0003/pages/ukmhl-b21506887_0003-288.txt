Twigs to the Rotators of the Thigh, which come off from it after its passage through the Sciatic Notch : The Cutaneus Superior Posterior, which arises with- in the Pelvis, and, passing out with the Sciatic, is di- vided into Branches, some of which are reflected to the Scrotum in a Male, and to the posterior parts of the Labia in a Female; and in both to the Skin about the Anus and Perinoeum.â€”The principal Branches of this Nerve pass downwards, supplying the Integuments of the back part of the Thigh, as far as the bending of the Knee: A Branch to the Long Head of the Biceps: Two small Nerves, the one termed Cutaneus Interims Superior, which comes off near the upper part of the Thigh, and vanishes in the Skin, a little farther down ; the other, termed Cutaneus Internus Inferior, which arises near the former, goes down the posterior part of the Thigh, and then, descending upon the inner Head of the Gastrocnemius Externus, terminates in the Inte- guments of the Calf of the Leg: A Large Common Trunk, and sometimes, instead of it, separate Branches, which arise near the middle of the Thigh, and are distributed to the Adductor Mag- nus, Semi-membranosus, Biceps, and Semi-tendinosus.

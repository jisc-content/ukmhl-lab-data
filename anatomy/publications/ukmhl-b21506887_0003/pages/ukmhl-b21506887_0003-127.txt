Part V.] OF THE BLOOD-VESSELS. 107 sive, anastomose with each other, with the last of the Lumbars, and with the Sacrse Laterales, through the Posterior Foramina of the Os Sacrum. Anterior Branches. Arteria Obturatoria, vel Obturatrix. The Obturator Artery has its Origin from the Trunk of the Hypogastric, or from the Ilio-lumbar, or from the Gluteal, or Ischiatic, or Pudic, and frequently from the end of the Iliaca Externa, or from the root of the Epigastrica. Sometimes one Branch of the Obtu- rator is from the Internal Iliac, another from the Epi- gastric, or Trunk of the External Iliac near the Epi- gastric. In some rare instances it has been observed to arise from the Femoral Artery, and pass behind the Crural Arch into the Pelvis. When the Obturator arises from the Hypogastric, or from one of its Branches, it^descends in the Pelvis by the inner side of the Psoas Muscle, or over the up- per edge of the Obturator Internus, and afterwards passes through the hole at the upper part of the Ob- turator Ligament. While in the Pelvis, it frequently gives Twigs to the Bladder and other parts near it, and, in its passage through the Foramen Thyroideum, sends a Branch to the Obturator Internus. After perforating the Ligament, it divides into two Sets of Branches, one Set of which are dispersed upon the parts about the Hip-joint, while another belong to the Obturator Externus, and to the Muscles which are

142 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part VI. the Lymphatics a jointed, and the Lacteals frequently a Vesicular appearance. In the termination of Absorbents, whether in the Thoracic Duct or in the Red Veins, there is always one, commonly two, but never more than two Valves, to prevent the contents of the Duct or of the Veins from passing into them. The Valves promote the general course of the Lymph and Chyle, and prevent the retrograde motion of these Fluids within their Vessels. Even after death they per- form the office of Valves, as the Lymphatics can only be injected according to the course of the absorbed Fluids; and they can support a column of Mercury, and prevent its retrograde motion. Use of the Absorbents. The Lymphatics take in the Fluids applied to their Orifices by Capillary Attraction, and afterwards by a power inherent in themselves, and, by their contractile nature, conduct them into the Mass of Blood, where- by they prevent Morbid Accumulations.â€”They absorb the thinner parts of the secreted Fluids, so as to give them a proper consistence, and take up solid parts ori- ginally formed for temporary purposes, to make way for others that are to be more permanent, &c. The Lacteals receive the Chyle from the Intestines, in the same manner as the Lymphatics do the Lymph from the other parts, and afterwards, by means of the Thoracic Ductj send it to be mixed with the Blood, for the nourishment, of the Body.

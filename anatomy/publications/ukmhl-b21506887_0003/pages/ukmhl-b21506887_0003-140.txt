lis COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part V. under and back part of the Thigh, and upon the Peri- osteum ; one Twig sent off from these sometimes form- ing a Nutritia vel Medullaris of the Os Femoris. The Femoral Artery, after giving off the Profunda Femoris, passes down, still covered by the Fascia of the Thigh, between the Vastus Internus and insertion of the second or long Head of the Triceps, giving only small Branches to the Muscles and Integuments at the fore and inner side of the Thigh. One Branch, termed Ramus Anastomoticus Magnus, more conspicuous than the rest, is sent off previously to the passage of the Artery through the Tendon of the Triceps. It descends with many Ramifications upon the Vastus Internus, upon which it is chiefly dis- persed ; inosculating with the descending Branch of the Circumflexa Externa, and below, with Branches about the Knee. About the middle of the inside of the Thigh, the Trunk of the Artery is situated behind the Sartorius; and, nearly two-thirds down upon the Os Femoris, it perforates the Triceps, passing between that Muscle and the Bone, in its way to the Leg. Having perforated the Triceps, it is found in the back part of the Thigh, where it sends Rami Per/b- rantes to the adjacent Muscles and Integuments. Of the Rami Perforantes two are more constant and considerable than the rest, and called by some Authors Perforans Superior, and Per/brans Inferior ; the for- mer distributed to the Muscles at the back and inner, and the latter, after sending off Branches to the Peri- osteum, and the Principal Medullaris, going to those of the back and outer part of the Thigh; and both com-

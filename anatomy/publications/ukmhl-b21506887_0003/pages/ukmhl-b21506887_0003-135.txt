Part V.] OF THE BLOOD-VESSELS. 113 It gives Branches to the Psoas, Iliacus, and Sarto- nus, to the under end of the Obliqui and Transversus Abdominis, between which it sometimes extends a con- siderable way. At length it communicates with the Epigastric, and with the Inferior Intercostal and the Lumbar Arteries. Arteria Femoralis. The Femoral, or Crural Artery, the continua- tion of the External Iliac, passes out of the Abdomen between the Ligament of Poupart and Brim of the Pelvis. At its exit, it is situated superficially over the Ball of the Os Femoris, having the inner edge of the com- mon end of the Psoas and Iliacus Internus between it and the Capsular Ligament of the Joint. At the top of the Thigh it forms the Inguinal or Common Femoral Artery, so named from its situation, and subsequent division into other Arteries. Here it is covered by the Lymphatic Vessels and Glands of the Groin, and by the general Aponeurosis and Fat; farther down, it is lodged deep in an angular Cavity in the upper and inner part of the Thigh, with the Rectus and Sartorius upon the outer, and the Tri- ceps Adductor Femoris upon the inner side of it. From this part it descends at the inside of the Thigh, turn- ing gradually backwards till it reaches the Ham, or rather, strictly speaking, having the Thigh-Bone first upon its outer, then upon its fore part. From the Inguinal or Common Femoral Artery, a few small Branches are sent off to the Skin of the Ab- domen, to the Superficial Muscles and Inguinal Glands, VOL. III. H

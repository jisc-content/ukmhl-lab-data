Cut the Parietes of the Abdomen in a crucial di- rection, at the Umbilicus.—Dissect first the Diaphrag- matic Vessels.—See p. 77. Divide next the Omentum Majus near its root, to allow the Stomach and Colon to be separated from each other, so as to give a view of the distribution of the Cceliac Artery. Blood-vessels. Dissect and expose the different Branches of the Cceliac Artery.—See Vol. III. p. 79. —89.

Peel off one side of the Mesentery, and trace the different Ramifications of the Superior Me- senteric Artery, which are much concealed by Cellular Substance.—See Vol. III. p. 89. Upon fully exposing the Superior Mesenteric Artery, turn the Small Intestines over to the right side, and dissect the under part of the Aorta and the Inferior Mesenteric Artery, but save the Sheath which lies over the Aorta, on account of the Nerves.—See p. 86.

Patit V.] OF THE BLOOD-VESSELS. 127 Plantar Arteries. The Plantar Arteries run forwards under the Apo- neurosis Plantaris, having the Flexors of the Toes be- tween them. The Plantaris Interna, vel Ramus Internus, passes near the inner side of the Sole, between the Aponeurosis Plantaris and Abductor Pollicis; having the Muscle upon the inner side of it. It gives Branches which run in a retrograde direc- tion to the back part of the Ankle, and adjacent parts of the Heel : Several Branches from each side, which go forwards to the Muscles and Integuments, and to the Bones, Ligaments, and other parts at the concave edge of the Sole. It sends a principal Branch to the inner side of the Great Toe; it then passes under the Flexor Longus Pollicis, and, after anastomosing with the Arcus Plan- taris, gives off a Large Branch which splits into two, —one to the outer side of the Great Toe, and the other to the adjacent side of the Toe next it. The Plantaris Externa, vel Ramus Externus, which may be considered as the continuation of the Trunk, being in general much larger than the Interna, —passes obliquely outwards between the Flexor Brevis Digitorum and Flexor Accessorius, till it reaches the Base of the Metatarsal Bone of the Little Toe. It is afterwards arched forward, between the Flexors and Metatarsal Bones of the small Toes, the Trunk be- ing continued to the root of the Great Toe, under the name of Arcus Plantaris.

232 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part VII. consequence of which, the left Nerve is the longer of the two. It afterwards ascends in the Neck, adhering to the posterior and lateral parts of the Trachea in its way to the Larynx. It is connected, near its origin, by one or two Branches of considerable size, with the adjacent Gan- lia of the Great Sympathetic Nerve; and from the opposite side of its root it sends considerable Branches to join other Nerves of the Eighth Pair, in the forma- tion of the Pulmonary Plexus of Nerves. Near the Subclavian Artery, it is connected by dif- ferent Filaments to the Superficial and Deep Cardiac Branches of the Sympathetic Nerve. In its ascent in the Neck, it transmits Pencils of Fi- laments, which penetrate the Trachea, and are dis- persed upon its Internal Membrane. Behind the Thyroid Gland, it sends off minute Fi- bres to the beginning of the Esophagus and bottom of the Pharynx, and small Twigs to the Gland itself. Upon the inner side of the Thyroid Cartilage, it fur- nishes a Branch which constitutes a remarkable Anasto- mosis with another from the Internal Laryngeal Nerve. At the back part of the Larynx, it is divided into many Fibrilloe, which are distributed on the different Muscles fixed to the Arytenoid Cartilage of the corre- sponding side. It has also some connexions, smaller than the one already mentioned, with Branches of the Internal Laryngeal Nerve, and sends minute Fibrillar to the Internal Membrane of the Larynx ; from which cir- cumstance, the Recurrent Nerves are considered as the principal Instruments of the Organ of Voice.

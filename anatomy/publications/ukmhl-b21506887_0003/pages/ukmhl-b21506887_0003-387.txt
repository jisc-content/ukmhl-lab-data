Part IX.] RULES FOR DISSECTION. 317 dissection will allow, but divide the Parotid Gland length-ways, to allow the Vessels to be traced. By means of a Mallet and small Chisel, cut along the middle of this side of the Lower J aw, and expose the Vessels and Nerves in the Maxillary Canal. Divide the Lower Jaw in its middle, and afterwards separate from it the Muscles and the Membrane of the Gums, but leave the soft parts surrounding the hole at the side of the Chin. Next, saw the Bone across a little above the Posterior Maxillary Foramen, guarding the Inferior Maxillary Vessels and Nerves, by placing a Spatula between them and the Bone. Turn the pro- cesses of the Jaw upwards, to shew parts deeper seated. Saw the Frontal Bone through at the outside of the Foramen Supra-orbitarium, and the Upper Jaw oblique- ly downwards at the outside of the Infra-orbitar Canal. Divide next the Root of the Zygoma, and saw the Squamous part of the Temporal Bone as far as the Base of the Cranium. Cut, by means of a Chisel, the Skull at the outer part of the Foramen Rotundum, Ovale, et Spinale, and at a sufficient distance, to save the Chorda Tympani from being injured. Turn now the cut parts outwards, and divide the Pterygoid Muscles to shew the distribution of the Internal Maxillary Ves- sels.—See Vol. III. p. 25, 42. Dissection of the Nerves corresponding to the Blood-vessels mentioned above. Right Side.—~Divide the Parotid Gland by means of a pointed instrument, and trace the different Branches of the Portio Dura of the seventh pair of Nerves.

COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part V. 86 Arteries of the adjacent parts of the Parietes of the Abdomen:â€”and The Colica Media, vel Ramus Colicus Medius, vel Arteria Media Anastoinotica, which proceeds to the great Arch of the Colon. Near the Colon, the Colica Media divides into two large Branches, one forming an Arch with the Colica Dextra, the other with a Branch of the Mesenterica Inferior. From the opposite side of the Colon, Branches of this Artery run to the Omentum, and communicate with the Gastro-Epiploic Arteries. Besides the Colic Branches already described, there is frequently an additional one, which arises from the beginning of the Superior Mesenteric Artery, and in its ascent splits into two others ; one of which, uniting with the Colica Media, forms the large Meso-colic Arch, and the other a similar Arch with the ascending Branch of the Inferior Mesenteric Artery. Sometimes the Superior Mesenteric Artery has been found to communicate at the head of the Pancreas, by a large Branch with the Arteria Gastrica Dextra. Mesenterica Inferior. The Mesenterica Inferior, vel Minor, arises from the anterior and left side of the Aorta, somewhat lower than half-way between its Bifurcation and the origin of the Superior Mesenteric Artery. It descends obliquely behind the Peritoneum, upon the left Psoas Muscle, and soon divides into principal Branches.

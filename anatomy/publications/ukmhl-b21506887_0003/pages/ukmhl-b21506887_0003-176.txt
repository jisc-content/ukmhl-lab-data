350 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part VI. with the round Ligaments of the Uterus, and termi- nate in the Iliac, and in the Lumbar Glands. Superficial Absorbents of the Abdomen and Loins, with the different Absorbents of the Nates. The Superficial Ly mphatics of the under part of the Abdomen, and those of the Loins, pass into the Ingui- nal Glands; each set terminating in such of the Glands as lie nearest the parts to which the Vessels belong. Of the Absorbents of the Nates, some go to the Glands of the Groin, but the greater number pass into the Pelvis with the Gluteal and Sciatic Blood-vessels, and terminate in the Iliac Glands. Inguinal, Iliac, and Lumbar Absorbents. The Inguinal Glands, having received the Lympha- tics of the Inferior Extremity, and likewise the Super- ficial Lymphatics of the External Parts of Generation, send out Trunks, fewer in number, but considerably larger than those which enter the Glands. The Vasa Efferentia of the Inguinal Glands enter the Abdomen under Poupart's Ligament, in company with the Inguinal Artery and Vein. Some of them go into the Glands situated about the Iliac or the Lumbar Blood-vessels. The Iliac Glands are frequently almost as numerous as the Glands of the Groin, and one of them is generally found larger than the rest, and placed at the inner edge of Poupart^s Ligament. The Lumbar Glands are more numerous

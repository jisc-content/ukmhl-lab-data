272 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Paut VIII. which the Fluids may be transmitted with different de- grees of facility. The Excretory Ducts are destitute of Valves, though in some, as the Cystic Duct of the Liver, there is a Cellular Structure within, which retards the motion of the Secreted Fluids. The Ducts discharge their contents in consequence of a Vis a Tergo from the Heart and Arteries,—of pressure from the surrounding parts,—of the Pulsation of the Arteries near them, to which may probably be added, a small degree of contractility in the Ducts themselves. Many of the Ducts terminate obliquely, others are surrounded at their termination by a Papilla, both of which circumstances contribute to prevent the return of the Fluids they discharge. Many of them have Receptacles attached to them, which vary much in size in different parts of the Body. These serve to receive the Fluids from the Ducts, and retain them till an occasion occurs for their being dis- charged. The Receptacles are termed Jperta, or Cceca* ac- cording as they possess outlets, or the reverse, for the discharge of the Excretions, and all of them are consi- dered to be lined by a Mucous Membrane. The Receptacula Aperta have orifices by which the Humours are allowed to escape, as in the case of the Bladder of Urine, Gall-bladder, &c. ; and these are shut or opened as circumstances may require, and this owing to the irritability of the part,—its mechanical power,—the action of the surrounding Viscera,—the acrimony and quantity of the Fluids contained, &c.

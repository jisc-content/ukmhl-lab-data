198 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part VII. backwards, which joins the Digastric Branch of the Portio Dura. A little lower, it gives off Branches, which, with others from the Pharyngeal Branch of the Eighth Pair, and from the Great Sympathetic Nerve, form a Plexus which embraces the Internal Carotid Artery, and after- wards sends Branches along the Carotis Communis to the Heart. Still lower, it gives Branches which communicate with others belonging to the Pharyngeal Nerve, and go to the upper part of the Pharynx, and to the Stylo- Pharyngeus. The Glosso-Pharyngeus, after sending a Twig or two to the Tonsil, to the upper part of the Pharynx, and Membrane of the Epiglottis, divides into many Branches, which run partly to the margin, and partly to the middle of the Root of the Tongue, supplying especially the Papillae Majores, and the parts in their neighbourhood. The Pars Vaga, upon emerging from the Cranium, frequently becomes a little increased in diameter for about an inch downwards, forming what some Authors have termed its Gangliform Enlargement. It descends in the Neck at the outer and back part of the common Carotid Artery, to which it is closely united, being included along with it, in the same com- mon Sheath of Cellular Substance. At the upper part of the Neck, it transmits a Branch called Pharyngeus, to the Pharynx ; and immediately afterwards, a large one, termed Laryngeus Superior, to the Larynx ; and near the top of the Thorax, it sends a Filament, and sometimes two, to the Heart.

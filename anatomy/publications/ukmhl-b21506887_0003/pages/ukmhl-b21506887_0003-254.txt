<m COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part VII. A little below the Axilla, it splits into two Branches: The smaller, turning to the posterior part of the Arm, is divided into Filaments, which are chiefly dispersed upon the Triceps and its Integuments: The larger Branch descends at the inner edge of the Triceps, and vanishes upon the under end of that Muscle, and upon the Skin of the Elbow. Nervus Musculo-Cutaneus. The Musculo-Cutaneus, called also Perforans Casserii, consists of Fibrillar from almost all of the Nerves entering the Plexus. The Cord formed by these Fibrillae perforates ob- liquely the upper part of the Coraco-brachialis, to which it gives Branches. It afterwards passes between the Biceps and Bra- chials Internus, furnishing Branches to both. At the Elbow, it gets to the outside of the Tendon of the Biceps, and runs behind the Median Cephalic Vein. From thence it descends in the Fore-arm, between the Supinator Longus and Integuments; furnishing Branches to the latter, as far as the root of the Thumb and back part of the Hand. Nervus Spiralis. The Spiral, or Spiral-Muscular Nerve, is ap- parently formed by all the Nerves entering into the Axillary Plexus, and, when the Sheaths of the Nerves are slit open, it is found to be composed of Fibrillae

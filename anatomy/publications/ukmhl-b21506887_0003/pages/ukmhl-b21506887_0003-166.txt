The Coats of the Absorbents are thinner and more transparent than those of the Veins, in consequence of which the colour of their Contents is readily perceived through them ; but they are stronger, being able to support a column of Mercury of considerable weight; —yet from their thinness, they cannot be enumerated. The Absorbents, however, like the Blood-vessels, are generally supposed to be formed of different Membra- nous Layers.—Fibres can be seen in them, especially in a Human Thoracic Duct, as well as in that of the larger Animals, as in a Horse and Ox, and the Muscularity of the Absorbents is rendered probable by the contractile power which they are observed to possess in a living, or moribund, or even in a re- cently dead Animal. By this contractility, together with a degree of elas- ticity they possess, they convey their contents from their origins towards their terminations, in which they are assisted by the motions of the surrounding Mus- cles, and pulsations of the neighbouring Arteries, in- dependent of such a Vis a Tergo as contributes to pro- pel the Blood through the Veins.

226 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part VIL Near the Hand, it sends a Branch, dividing into others which supply the Muscles and Integuments form- ing the Ball of the Thumb. The Trunk of the Nerve, having given Branches to the Fore-arm, passes under the Annular Ligament of the Wrist, where it divides into Branches which are situated behind the Aponeurosis Palmaris and Super- ficial Arch of the Arteries. The principal Branches in the Palm come off in three divisions, from which seven Nerves of considerable size are distributed to the Thumb and Fingers. Of these, two go to the Thumb, and one to the Radial side of the Fore-Finger; the rest come off from two forked Trunks, near the Heads of the Metacarpal Bones, and supply the adjacent sides of the Fore and Middle, and of the Middle and Ring Fingers. These Branches send Twigs through the Aponeuro- sis to the Integuments of the Palm, and others to the Musculi Lumbricales ; after which they accompany the Arteries sent out from the Superficial Palmar Arch, bestowing Twigs to the corresponding parts of the Fin- gers, at the points of which they terminate, by nume- rous Fibres. Nervus Ulnaris. The Ulnar Nerve, like the former, is of great size, and comes off chiefly from the last Cervical and first Dorsal Nerve. It extends along the inside of the Triceps, frequent- ly perforating some of its Fleshy Fibres, and, near the Elbow, slants a little backwards, to get into a Groove between the Inner Condyle of the Os Humeri and Ole-

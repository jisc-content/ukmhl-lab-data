186 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part VII. It sends a Branch, which, after entering the Foramen Orbitarium Internum Anterius, re-enters the Cavity of the Cranium, and gets upon the Cribriform Plate of the Ethmoid Bone. From thence it passes down through one of the ante- rior Holes of this Plate, and sends Twigs to the Mem- brane at the anterior part of the Nostril, while the Nerve, descending at the fore part of the Septum Na- rium, is dispersed upon the Point and Wing of the Nose. The continuation of the Nasal Branch, now called Infra-Trochlearis, passes forwards to the inner Corner of the Eye, and is distributed upon the Lacrymal Sac and parts adjacent. The Lacrymal Branch, which runs along the Abduc- tor Oculi, sends Twigs to the Membranes and Fat near it, likewise one or two through the Substance of the Cheek-bone, and one in particular to the Substance of the Lacrymal Gland, while another passes over the Gland, and vanishes in the neighbouring parts : A Branch to the Ophthalmic Ganglion, which is sometimes sent off from the Nasal, at other times from the Ophthalmic Trunk. The Ophthalmic Ganglion, termed also Lenticular from its shape, is formed by this Branch from the Fifth, and by another from the Third Pair, and is common- ly the smallest in the Body. It is of an oblong form, and compressed ; is situated at the outside of the Optic Nerve, a little before the Foramen Opticum, and is concealed in Fat. Some- times, though rarely, the Filaments which form it take their origin entirely from the Third Pair.

18 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part V. the Ascending Aorta, and is about two-thirds of an inch in diameter. It begins behind the Cartilage of the first Rib, some- what higher than the Arch of the Aorta, and has at first a small inclination towards the right side. After descending about an inch, it perforates the Pericardium, and having run nearly twice this space, it enters the Right Auricle, opposite to the termina- tion of the Inferior Cava. The Superior Cava receives the Blood from the Head, Neck, Arms, and containing parts of the Tho- rax, and, like the Inferior Cava, carries it to the Heart. BLOOD-VESSELS of the HEAD, anb fart of THOSE OF THE NECK. Arteries. From the upper side of the Arch of the Aorta, three Large Arteries arise, which supply the Head, Neck, and Superior Extremities. Of these three Arteries, one on the right side, termed Innominata, or Communis, soon divides into the Right Carotid, and Right Subclavian Arteries. The other two are the Left Carotid, and Left Subcla- vian, which come off in separate Trunks. The above is the ordinary way in which the Ca- rotids and Subclavians take their Origin ; but there is considerable variety in this respect in different Bodies.

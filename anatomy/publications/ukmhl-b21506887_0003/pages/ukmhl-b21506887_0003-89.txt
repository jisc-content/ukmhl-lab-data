69 Part V.] OF THE BLOOD-VESSELS. Deep Veins. The Deep Veins, termed also Vena? Satellites, vel Concomites, run close to their respective Arteries, one lying commonly on each side of the Artery, and receiv- ing the Blood from the adjacent parts. They termi- nate directly, or indirectly, in the Axillary Vein. In various places they anastomose with each other by short Branches, which cross over the Arteries. Near the Joint of the Elbow, the Deep Radial, Ul- nar, and Interosseous Veins, form a Plexus over the Bi- furcation of the Humeral Artery. From this Plexus, a short but large Branch passes outwards, and forms a communication with one of the Subcutaneous Set; and, in general, the communication is with one of the Median Veins. Vena Axillaris. The Vena Axillaris, formed by the Trunks of the Superficial and deep Humeral Veins, but more es- pecially by the Basilic, receives the Veins correspond- ing with the Circumflex Arteries, and the Internal, and the Inferior Dorsal Veins of the Scapula. A little higher, it is joined by the Vena? Thoracicce Externa?, and about this place changes its name for that of Subclavian Vein. Vena Subclavia. The Vena Subclavia passes between the Subcla- vian Muscle and first Rib, at the inner side of the Trunk of the Artery, and afterwards goes over the fore

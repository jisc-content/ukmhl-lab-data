48 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part V. the Base of the Petrosal Processes of the Temporal Bones, from whence they wind downwards, pass through the Foramina Lacera common to the Occipital and Tem- poral Bones, and form the Internal Jugular Veins. Frequently one of the Lateral Sinuses is formed by the Longitudinal, and the other by the Torcular Si- nus ; in which case, the one is found larger than the other. The Lateral Sinuses receive Veins from the Cerebel- lum, and from the under and back part of the Cere- brum. They likewise receive the following small Sinus- es, situated under the Brain, viz* The Circular Sinus of Ridley, which is placed about the Glandula Pituitaria, and frequently surrounds it completely ; receiving the Blood from it, and from the adjacent Bones and Membranes* and terminating in the Cavernous Sinuses* The Cavernous Sinuses, which are situated at the sides of the Sella Turcica, and receive Blood from the Veins lying near the lateral Branches of the Internal Carotid Arteries, from the Ocular Veins, and from the Circular Sinus of Ridley. The Cavernous Sinuses surround the Carotid Arte- ries and Sixth Pair of Nerves, and have a Cavernous Structure within, somewhat resembling that of the Penis. The Superior Petrosal Sinuses, situated upon the Ridges of the Partes Petrosae. They receive some small Veins from the Dura Mater and Base of the Brain, and communicate backwards with the Lateral, and forwards with the Cavernous Sinuses. The Inferior Petrosal Sinuses, placed at the roots of

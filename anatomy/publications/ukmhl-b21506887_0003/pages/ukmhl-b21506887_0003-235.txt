PautVIL] of the nerves. 203 one of which, larger than the rest, and considered as the continuation of the Trunk, turns outwards be- tween the Inferior Laryngeal and Vertebral Arteries to another Ganglion. This third Ganglion is placed at the Head of the first Rib, and is termed by some Authors Ganglion Cer- vicale Inferius, vel Tmiim, while others consider it as the first of the Thoracic Ganglia. The Cervical part of the Great Sympathetic is con- nected with other Nerves, and dispersed upon different parts, by the following Branches, viz. One or two short but thick Branches, which connect the beginning of the Superior Ganglion with the root of the Sub-occipital Nerve : One or two Pulpy Nerves, which run forwards be- hind the Internal Carotid Artery, and divide into many others. These, together with the Filaments from the Glosso-pharyngeus, form a Plexus which sends Branches to the Gangliform Expansion of the Pharyngeus, and afterwards embraces the External Carotid Artery, send- ing Plexuses of Filaments along its different Branches: One or two other soft Nerves, going behind the In- ternal Carotid, and with a Branch of the Laryngeus Internus of the Eighth Pair, forming the Laryngeus Externus : Thick short Roots, connecting the First, or Conju- gation of the First and Second Cervicals, with the Su- perior Ganglion of the Sympathetic Nerve. From the Superior Ganglion, also, are sent off small Branches, which, uniting with Filaments from the Laryngeus Superior, form the Ramus Cardiacus Su- premus, vel Superflcialis Cordis. (

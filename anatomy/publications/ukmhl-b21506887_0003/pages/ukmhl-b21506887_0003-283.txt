Part VII.] OF THE NERVES, 251 and Internal Iliac Blood-vessels, and along the side of the Pelvis. Nervus Obturator. The Obturator Nerve accompanies the Blood-Ves- sels of the same name through the upper part of the Obturator Muscles and Ligament, and having furnish- ed Branches to the Obturators and Pectineus, it di- vides into an Anterior and a Posterior Fasciculus; the former dispersed upon the two small Adductors and Gracilis, the latter upon the Adductor Magnus Femoris. The principal parts of the Trunks of the four upper Lumbar Nerves, especially of the Third and Fourth, unite and form a Nerve of great size, termed Crural or Anterior Femoral. Nervus Cruralis. The Crural Nerve, after bestowing Branches up- on the Iliacus Internus, and Psoas, passes behind, then at the outside of the Psoas, to get to the Thigh. In its course from the Abdomen, and at the upper part of the Thigh, it is situated a little to the outside of the Femoral Artery which lies between it and the corresponding Vein. Behind Poupart's Ligament, it is divided into many Branches, which are distributed to the Muscles and In- teguments on the fore and lateral parts of the Thigh,â€” one Branch in particular, termed Saphenus, descending upon the Leg.

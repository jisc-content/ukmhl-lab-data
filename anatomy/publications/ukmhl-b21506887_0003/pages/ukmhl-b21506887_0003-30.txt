10 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part V separate a Fluid from the general Mass of Blood, as in the Salivary Glands: In Exhalent Vessels, which discharge their Contents into the Internal Cavities, as the Pleura, or Perito- neum, or upon the external Surface of the Body, to lubricate these; In colourless or Lymphatic Branches, which are af- terwards continued to the Circulating Veins, as in the Cartilages and Cornea: In Cells, as in the Penis, Clitoris, and Corpus Ca- vernosum Vaginae. The Use of the Arteries is,— To convey Blood from the Heart to the different parts of the Body : To assist in converting the Chyle into Blood: To nourish the Body, and promote its growth : To assist in preserving the Fluidity of the Blood, and the Heat and Life of the Body: To form the different Secretions; and, To renew the growth of Parts destroyed by accident or disease. Veins. The Veins are elastic flexible Tubes, continued di- rectly from the Extremities of the Arteries, returning the Blood from the different parts of the Body to the Heart,—and having no Pulsation. The commencement of the Veins is seen, as the ter- mination of the Arteries is, by the assistance of a Mi- croscope, after a minute injection in the dead body, or in certain Membranous Expansions, as the Foot of a Frog, in a Living Animal, where the one set of Vessels

W COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part V. and nearer the Larynx, than the Internal, which lies deeper, and is, at its root, the larger of the two. The External, though smaller than the other, ap- pears as a continuation of the common Trunk. It runs up behind the Angle of the Lower Jaw, un- der the Digastricus and Stylo-hyoideus, towards the Temple, and in its passage before the Ear, is sunk deep in the substance of the Parotid Gland, which it supplies in its course, and is divided into the following principal Branches, viz. Laryngea Superior, Lingualis, Facialis, Pharyngea Inferior, Occipitalis, Maxillaris Interna, Temporalis* Arteria Laryngea Superior. The Arteria Laryngea Superior, Gutturalis Superior, vel Thyroidea Superior, comes off from the Root of the External Carotid, and sometimes from the top of the Common Carotid. It passes downwards and forwards in a winding di- rection, under the Omo-hyoideus and Sterno-thyroi- deus, and sends Branches to the Muscles under the Os Hyoides, and to the Bone itself, and Ligament connecting it to the Larynx: Branches to the Sterno-mastoideus, Platysma Myoi- des, Jugular Glands, and Skin near the Larynx : The Laryngeal Branch, which passes between the Os Hyoides and Thyroid Cartilage, to the Cartilages, Muscles, and Membranes peculiar to the Larynx. This Branch is sometimes sent off from the Trunk of the External Carotid.

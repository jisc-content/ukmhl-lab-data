890 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part IX. Observe the nature of the Mesentery, the manner in which the Intestines are inclosed in it, and its attach- ments to the Spine.—See Vol. II. p. 226. The Spleen is to be examined by pulling the Stomach towards the right side ;—when the one Viscus will fol- low the other, the Pancreas is to be seen by tearing through the Great Omentum between the large Curve of the Stomach and Arch of the Colon. Before farther Dissection, make a puncture into the end of the Duodenum, and innate the Stomach and all the Intestines, to shew their size and inverted Conical form. Remove next the Small and Great Intestines for Dis- section, excepting the Duodenum and Rectum, which are to be left in their places. Separate the Mesentery, and then distend with Air about six inches of the upper end of the Jejunum, and under end of the Ilium, to allow their relative diame- ters to be compared ; but leave about a hand-breadth of the under end of the Ilium attached to the Caecum. Invert a piece at the top of the Jejunum, and under end of the Ilium, to shew the difference with respect to the Valvulae Conniventes. From a piece at the upper part of the Jejunum, cut the Mesentery, invert the Gut, tie up one end, and blow Air forcibly into the other, till the Villous Coat is inflated. Hang up in a Jar of clear Water a piece of the Je- junum inverted and washed, to shew the Valvulaa Con- niventes. In another piece, raise the Peritoneal from the Muscular Coat, and that from the Cellular, then

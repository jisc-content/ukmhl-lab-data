298 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part IX. Shew the course of the Ureters. Examine fully the situation and general appearance of the Contents of the Pelvis, while they are still in situ. Attend next to the External Parts, and to the intro- duction of the Catheter to discharge the Urine, and of the Finger by the Vagina, to examine the Os Tinea?. In the dissection of the External Parts, divide the Skin from the Groin to the Anus ; remove the Cellular Substance, to shew the Crus of the Clitoris, and the different Perineal Muscles. Raise the Sphincter Vagi- nae, to expose the Corpus Cavernosum Vaginas. After dissecting the parts seen in the Perineum, se- parate the left Os Innominatum, as in a Male. At- tend to the Lymphatic Glands, which are numerous; some round the Blood-vessels, and on the sides of the Bladder, Uterus, and Vagina, and others between the Layers of the Mesocolon. Distend the Bladder and Rectum moderately with Air, to shew their relative situation, and the extent of the Peritoneum upon them ; and trace the Ureter to its termination. After attending to the situation, separate the Con- tents entirely from the Pelvis, to admit of their farther investigation. Slit open the Urethra, leaving its extremities entire ; then cut open the Bladder along its fore part, and exa- mine its internal Surface, and the termination of the Ureters. Lay open also the Vagina, leaving the Os Externum and Os Tincae in their natural state. Cut open the Uterus, from near the Os Tineas to the

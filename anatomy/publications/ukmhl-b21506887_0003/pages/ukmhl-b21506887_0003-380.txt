310 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part IX. Dislocations of the Joints of the Superior Extremity. In an Extremity where the Muscles are dissected, cut as much of the Ligaments of the Joints as to allow the different Dislocations to be imitated, and their Re- ductions afterwards effected. In forming the Dislo- cations, divide no more of the Muscles than is abso- lutely necessary, so as to judge of the appearance of the Joint when in a state of Dislocation. Dissection of the Muscles, &c. on the Pelvis and Thigh.â€”See Vol. I. p. 284. Remove the Integuments from the Pelvis and Thigh, as far as a hand-breadth below the Knee. Dissect the Superficial Fascia, Vol. I. p. 210, the In- guinal Glands, Vol. III. p. 147, the Absorbents of which are sometimes seen running into, or out from them, filled with Lymph. Dissect also the Fascia Lata, with its different Pro- cesses, Vol. I. p. 211.; and the continuation of this Fascia, p. 284. Examine the situation of the Trunks of the Femoral Vessels and Nerves, and the insertion of the Vena Sa- phena. On the fore side of the Thigh divide the Fascia Lata longitudinally, and turn it to each side, to shew the Muscles described, Vol. I. p. 285, &c. Observe the passage of the Femoral Artery between

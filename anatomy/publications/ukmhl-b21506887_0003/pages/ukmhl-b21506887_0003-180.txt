154 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part VL and have been called Ampullae of Leiberkuhn, from that Author considering them as little Bottles receiving the Chyle. From the Villi, the Lacteals run a considerable way under the Muscular Coat of the Intestines, and then pass obliquely through it, uniting in their course into larger Branches. They follow the direction of the Blood-vessels, and their Trunks are double the number of the Arteries,â€” one being situated on each side of an Artery. Upon the Surface of the Intestines an external Set also appears. It runs between the Peritoneal and Mus- cular Coats, and commonly proceeds some way in the direction of the Intestine, and with few Ramifications. The Superficial and deep-seated Lacteals communi- cate freely in the Substance of the Intestines, and, after leaving them, commonly form a Plexus, which runs between the plies of the Mesentery and Meso-colon, without following particularly the course of the Blood- vessels. The Lacteals of the Jejunum are larger and more nu- merous than those of the Ilium ; the principal part of the Chyle being contained in the former. In their course they pass through a great number of Lacteal or Mesenteric Glands, from 130 to 150 and up- wards having been counted by different Authors. The Glands, like the Lacteals themselves, are largest and most numerous in that part of the Mesentery which belongs to the Jejunum. The Mesenteric Glands are seated in the Fat, be- tween the Layers of the Mesentery, near the Branches of the Blood-vessels.

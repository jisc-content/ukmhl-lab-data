236 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part VII. The Cardiacus Superficialis arises from the up- per part of the Sympathetic Nerve, as formerly noticed, and passes behind the Arch of the Aorta to the Plexus Cardiacus Magnus. The Cardiacus Magnus Profundus Sinister, the upper portion of which is smaller than that of the right side, arises by numerous roots from the middle, and also from the lowest Ganglion of the Sympathetic Nerve. It passes across the Arch of the Aorta, and, after receiving the Cardiac Branch of the Eighth Pair, joins the Great Cardiac of the right side, to assist in form- ing the Cardiac Plexus. From the Cardiac Plexus, a Reticulum of Nerves extends upon the left side of the Ascending Aorta, which receives the Cardiacus Minor, and a Filament or two from the Cardiacus Magnus of the right side, going over the Aorta. From this Reticulum, the Anterior or Right Corona- ry Plexus is produced, which passes between the Pul- monary Artery and Aorta, and afterwards follows the course of the Trunk and Branches of the Right Coro- nary Artery, along with which it is dispersed upon the corresponding side of the Heart. The Great Cardiac Plexus, after sending a Filament or two to the Lungs, gives off Nerves which unite and form the Trunk of the Great Deep Cardiac Nerve of the left side, which has a soft Gangliform appearance, and passes along the corresponding side of the Pulmo- nary Artery. Upon the Surface of this Artery, the Trunk soon divides into Branches, which, after sending Filaments

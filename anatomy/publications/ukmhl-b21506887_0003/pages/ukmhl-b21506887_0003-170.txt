144, COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part VI. Their colour also varies in different parts of the Body, and at different times of life. In young Subjects, they are generally largest, and more turbid, and of a reddish and brown colour, and become smaller and paler with increasing age, though they never entirely disappear. Immediately under the Skin, they are redder and firmer, and have more of a pink colour than within the large Cavities. In the Mesentery, they are of a pale greyish colour ; about the Bronchi, they are of a bluish tint, and some- times almost jet black. They have a smooth, dense, Membranous Covering, which gives them a shining appearance, and are con- nected to the surrounding parts by loose Cellular Sub- stance. Their Coat is connected to the Glandular part by a Cellular Membrane, which, according to Dr Haller, is pervaded at an early period of life, by a Succus Proprius full of Globules, which, Mr Hewson suppos- ed, afterwards form the red Globules of the Blood. Mascagni maintains, that this matter is not contained in the Cellular Substance, but in the Vessels themselves. Like other Glands, they are supplied with Arteries, Veins, and Nerves, which are derived from those of the adjacent parts. They are described by some Anatomists as being composed of Cells internally, while others consider them as a Congeries of convoluted Absorbent Vessels.â€”Most of the Glands have much of the former, but many of them of the lattr appearance. The Absorbents entering into the Glands, are called Vasa Infei'entia. When they approach, or come in

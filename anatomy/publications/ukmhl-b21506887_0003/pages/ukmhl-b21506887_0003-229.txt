Part VII.] OF THE NERVES. 197 Branches, and with others belonging to the third part of the Fifth Pair: The Descending, or Subcutaneous Cervical Branches, some of which run forwards under the Lower Jaw, and others downwards, near the External Jugular Vein, to the Superficial Muscles, and to the Integuments at the side and upper part of the Neck, where they form com- munications with the Inferior Facial Branches, and with different Branches of the Upper Spinal Cervical Nerves. Eighth Pair. The Eighth Pair arise from the Medulla Oblon- gata, at the outer part of the bases of the Corpora Olivaria, and consist, on each side, of the Nervus Glosso-pharyngeus, and Pars Vaga. The Glosso-Pharyngeus is the smallest of the two, being only a little larger than one of the Nerves of the Fourth Pair. The Pars Vaga, or Pneumo-Gastric Nerve* comes off immediately under the former, and is com- posed of upwards of a dozen of separate Fasciculi, which are soon collected into a single Cord. The two Nerves, passing outwards, go through the Base of the Cranium, immediately before the end of the Lateral Sinus, by the Hole common to the Occipi- tal and Temporal Bones, and are separated from each other, and from the Sinus, by a small Process of the Dura Mater. The Glosso-pharyngeus, termed also Lingualis Late- ralis, upon its exit from the Cranium, sends a Branch

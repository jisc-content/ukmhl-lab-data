84 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part Y, size ; and running under or behind the Pancreas, and over the Duodenum, it passes between the layers of the Mesentery, towards the under side of the Abdo- men. In its descent, it forms an Arch, being bent for- wards and a little to the left side, its lower extremity turning toward the beginning of the Colon. From the convex side of the Artery, about sixteen or eighteen Branches are sent off to the Small Intes- tines ; while others proceed from the right side to the right portion of the Colon. The First Arteries sent off from the Trunk are very inconsiderable, running to the Pancreas and to the left portion of the Duodenum, and communicating there with Branches of the C celiac Artery, and of the Lum- bar or other Arteries situated near them. The principal Branches from the left or convex side of the Trunk are dispersed upon the Jejunum and Ilium, supplying, in their course, the Layers of the Mesentery, and the parts it contains. The first of these Branches are short and small; those which succeed gradually increase in length and size as far as the middle of the Arch, after which they diminish again, somewhat in the same proportion, to- wards the lower part of the Ilium. In their course through the Mesentery, the principal Branches communicate, first by reciprocal Arches, then by Areolae of Meshes, of different figures, which in- crease in number, but diminish in size, like the Vessels themselves, as they approach the Intestines, the convex side of the Arches always being turned towards the part on which the Arteries are to be dispersed,

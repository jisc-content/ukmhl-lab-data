Part V.] OF THE BLOOD-VESSELS. 19 Sometimes there are two common Trunks from which these Arteries take their rise ; at other times there are four original Arteries from the Aorta; and in some rare cases, the Right Subclavian comes off from the left end of the Arch of the Aorta, and passes behind the Trachea. In some instances, the two Carotids come off from the Arteria Innominata. Carotid Arteries. The Carotid, termed also Cephalic Arteries, after emerging from the Thorax, ascend upon the fore part of the Vertebrae, between the Trachea and Internal Jugular Veins, and behind the Sterno-mastoidei, gra- dually receding from each other, and getting upon the fore part of the Longus Colli, and Rectus Capitis In- tern us Major, on each side. In the Neck, they do not send off any Branches till they reach the top of the Larynx, where each, op- posite to the Os Hyoides, though in some rare instan- ces much lower, divides into External and Internal Carotid Arteries, the former supplying the upper part of the Neck, and the outer parts of the Head, the lat- ter the greater part of the Brain. In some very rare cases, the Common Carotid has been observed to divide suddenly into numerous small Branches. External Carotid. The External Carotid, or Pericephalic, some- times termed Facial Carotid, is placed more anteriorly,

Part VII.] OF THE NERVES. 179 wise accurately examined, they are observed to divide, subdivide, and re-unite, or to intermix somewhat after the same manner of the Fibrillae in the Plexus, or in the Ganglia, in consequence of which, the danger a- rising from Accident or Disease is lessened. The termination of the Nerves in the different Or- gans, is soft, pulpy, and semi-transparent, at least this is distinctly the case in the Retina of the Eye, and in the Ear ; the external covering being then entirely laid aside, while the Pia Mater, in particular, accompanies them throughout. The Nerves preserve the motion of the Muscular Fibres, and the irritability of the Arteries ; promote the circulation in the extremities of these, and their power of secretion. They constitute the immediate Organs of Sensation, and convey impressions made upon them to the Mind. The manner in which these impressions are pro- duced,—whether by a Vibration communicated to the Nerves,—or by a Liquid called Nervous Fluid, con- tained and moving in them,—or by an Elastic Matter common to them and many other Substances,—is not yet understood. DISTRIBUTION OF THE NERVES. The Nerves are distinguished into two Classes; one arising from, or connected with, the Brain, termed Ce- rebral, the other from, or connected with, the Spinal M 2

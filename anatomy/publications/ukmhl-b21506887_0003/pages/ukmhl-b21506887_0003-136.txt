114 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part V. and to the common Integuments at the upper part of the Thigh; also one or two others, termed Pudicce Ex^ ternce, and by some Authors Pudicas Externa? Supe- rior et hiferior, to the Pubes, to the Integuments of the External Parts of Generation, and to the upper and inner side of the Thigh in both Sexes. Some of these Branches sent from this part of the Femoral Ar- tery, anastomose with those of the Epigastric, and others with the Arteries of the Penis. About two inches below the Ligament of Poupart, or opposite the insertion of the Psoas Magnus and Ilia- cus Internus into the Trochanter Minor, the common Femoral Artery divides, somewhat like the common Iliac, into anterior and posterior parts.—The former is the Femoral Artery strictly so called, the latter is term- ed Profunda Femoris. It sometimes, however, though rarely, happens, that the division of this Artery is a- bout three inches below Poupart's Ligament, and, in some still more rare cases, directly under it. Profunda Femoris. The Arteria Profunda, also called Vasta Poste- rior, vel Muscularis Femoris, concealed at first by the proper Femoral Trunk, gives off at its origin from that Artery, small Branches arising separately or in a common Trunk, and dispersed upon the Integuments, Muscles, and Capsular Ligament, at the upper and fore part of the Thigh. It gives next, from its origin also, two large Branch- es,—the Circumflexa Interna, and Circumflexa Exter- na,—which run in opposite directions at the top of the Thigh.

180 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part VII. Marrow, termed Spinal Nerves, and all similar to their fellows in the opposite side of the Body. According to the idea of some modern Physiologists, the Nerves, instead of taking their origin from the Brain and Spinal Marrow, as is commonly understood, have their termination there. The Cerebral Nerves are generally reckoned Nine or Ten Pairs, besides a particular Pair, which has the name of Sympathetic, or by some late Authors they are considered as consisting of only eight pairs, viz. The Olfactory, the Optic, the common Oculo-Mus- cular, the Internal Oculo-Muscular, the External Oculo-Muscular, the Trigeminal, the Facial, and the Auditory Nerves. They pass through the Holes in the base of the Cranium, and receive their respective names according to their order ; or from their functions ; or from the parts on which they are dispersed, &c. The Spinal Nerves consist of Twenty-nine or Thirty Pairs, which pass out between the different Vertebrae, besides a Pair called Accessory, which enter the Crani- um, from the top of the Spinal Marrow, and afterwards pass out with one of the Cerebral Pairs of Nerves. Nerves which pass through the Base of the Cranium. First Pair. The First Pair, or Olfactory Nerves, arise, on each side of the Brain, by three separate Striae, from the Corpora Striata. The Striae unite into Trunks at the under and back part of the Anterior Lobes, near

70 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part V. part of the Scalenus Anticus ; of course is more su- perficial than the Artery at the under end of the Neck. After crossing the first Rib, it receives the Vein cor- responding with the Superior Dorsal Artery of the Sca- pula, the Veins which belong to the Cervical Arteries, and also small Veins from the Skin and Muscles on the back part of the Neck. While situated in the Neck, it likewise receives the External, and then the Inter nalJugular Veins ; and by the addition of these forms a Trunk, which may be called great Subclavian, or Jugular Subclavian Vein. Near the termination of the Internal Jugular, the Subclavian receives a Vein of considerable size, which corresponds with the Trunk of the Vertebral Artery, but commonly passes through the Vertebra beneath that by which the Artery enters these Bones. The Vertebral Vein communicates within the Cra- nium, by small Branches, with the Inferior Petrosal ^ Sinuses, or with the Occipital Sinuses ; but is chiefly formed by Branches arising from the Spinal Marrow and its Membranes, and from the Bones and deep-seat- ed Muscles of the Neck. Behind the top of the Sternum, the Great Subcla- vian Vein frequently receives the Inferior Laryngeal, Anterior External Jugular, and the Internal Mam- mary Vein, which at other times go into the Superior Cava. Besides these, the Left Great Subclavian receives also the Left Vena Azygos; after which it goes across the root of the Great Arteries sent up from the Arch of the Aorta, in consequence of which it is con- siderably longer than the Right Subclavian. It de-

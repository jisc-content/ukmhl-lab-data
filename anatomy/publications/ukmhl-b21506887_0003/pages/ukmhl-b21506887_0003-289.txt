257 Part VII.] OF THE NERVES. Nervus Popliteus. The Popliteal Nerve is situated between the Ham-strings, and between the Skin and Popliteal Blood-vessels. A little above the bending of the Knee, it is divided into a small External, and a large Internal Branch; the former named Popliteus Externus, or Fibular, and the latter Popliteus Internus, or Tibial Nerve. The Tibial and Fibular Nerves adhere, for some way, by Cellular Substance; and even the Trunk of the Sciatic may be split into these two Nerves for a considerable way up the Thigh. â€¢ Nervus Fibularis. The Fibular, termed also Peroneal Nerve, sends off, at its beginning, the Cutaneus Externus, which is a small Branch giving Twigs to the under end of the Biceps, and which, after running down to the outer Head of the Gastrocnemius, disappears in the Integu- ments of the same side of the Leg. Over the outer Condyle of the Os Femoris, it gives off another Cutaneous Branch, which descends upon the Gastrocnemius, and, after anastomosing with a Branch of the Tibialis, goes along the outer part of the Leg, and terminates in the Integuments of that side of the Foot. The Fibular Nerve afterwards passes over the Head of the Fibula, and divides into Superficial and Deep VOL. III. R

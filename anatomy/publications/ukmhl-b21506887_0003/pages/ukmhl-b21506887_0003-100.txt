80 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part V. goes upwards and a little towards the left, to reach the right side of the upper Orifice of the Stomach. Here it sends Branches to the Cardia, which encir- cle it, and, ascending some way upon the Esophagus, communicate with the Arterias Esophageae. The Trunk of the Artery afterwards divides, upon the Small Curvature of the Stomach, into principal Branches, some of which run across the upper and un- der Surfaces, and others obliquely towards the right side, supplying a large portion of this Viscus, and sending Twigs to the Omentum Minus,—while the Trunk is frequently extended as far as the Pylorus, Arteria Hepatica. The Arteria Hepatica, the largest of the three great Branches, is concealed at its root by the Pan- creas, and passes obliquely forwards, upwards, and to the right side, behind the Pylorus,—before and a little to the right side of the Lobulus Spigelii,—till it arrives at the Porta of the Liver. Where it approaches the Porta, it divides into the Gastrica Inferior Dextra^ and the Proper Hepatic Ar- tery. Gastrica Dextra. The Gastrica Dextra, vel Gastrica Inferior Dextra, velGASTRo-EpiPLOiCA Dextra, sends out,— The Arteria Pylorica, which, however, is frequently produced immediately from the Hepatic Artery. It gives Branches to the Pylorus and other parts about

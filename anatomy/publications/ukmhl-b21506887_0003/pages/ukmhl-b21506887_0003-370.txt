Raise carefully some of the Internal Intercostals, to expose the Pleura, and the Lungs appearing obscure- ly through, and in close contact with it- Raise the Pectoralis Minor from its origin, and exa- mine the Trunks of the Axillary Vessels and Nerves, together with the Absorbent Glands. Dissection of the Contents of the Thorax.—-Sec Vol. II. p. 165. Introduce a crooked Pipe into the Trachea, and by means of the Mouth, or of Bellows, have the Lungs distended, so as to allow the motions of the Diaphragm, in the different states of Respiration, to be examined. Cut cautiously through the Cartilages of the Ribs, at the sides of the Sternum, from the Second to the Seventh Rib inclusive, and raise them slowly, to shew the Sterno-costalis.—Vol. I. p. 237. Tab. X. Fig. 2. Divide the Intercostal Muscles between the First and Second, and between the Seventh and Eighth Ribs, as far as the lateral part of the Thorax, on each side, guarding against injuring the Diaphragm. Turn the Ribs outwards, by sawing or breaking them, so as to obtain a full view of the Contents of the Thorax. Examine the situation of the Pleura, Mediastinum, Pericardium, and Lungs, previously to making any far,- ther Dissection. Lay open next the Pericardium longitudinally, at it*

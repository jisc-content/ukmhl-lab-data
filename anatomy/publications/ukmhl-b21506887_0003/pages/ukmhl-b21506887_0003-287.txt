Part VII.] OF THE NERVES. 255 The Superior Fasciculus goes through the upper part of the Notch of the Os Ilium, to be dispersed upon the two smaller Glutei Muscles. The Irtferior Fasciculus passes through the under part of the same Notch, and below the Pyriformis, to be distributed upon the Gluteus Maximus and Integu- ments. The Fourth and Fifth Sacral Nerves. The Fourth Sacral sends Filaments to the Hypo- gastric Plexus, others to the Muscles and Ligaments of the Os Coccygis ; the rest pass outwards to the Muscles and Integuments about the Anus. The Fifth, which is scarcely above the size of a Fi- lament, passes forwards between the extremity of the Os Sacrum and the beginning of the Os Coccygis. After giving Twigs to the Coccygeus, it perforates the Sacro-Sciatic Ligaments, and terminates in the Muscles and Integuments of the Anus. Nervus Sciaticus. The Sciatic, or Ischiatic Nerve, passes obliquely through the Notch of the Ilium, under the Pyriformis. It goes afterwards over the other short Rotator Muscles, and is placed between the Tuber Ischii and Trochanter Major, where it is covered by the Gluteus Maximus. After leaving the Pelvis, it descends in the back part of the Thigh, first between the long Flexors and Ad- ductor Magnus, and then between the latter and Os

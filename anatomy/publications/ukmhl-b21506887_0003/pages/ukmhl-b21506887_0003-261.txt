Part VII.] OF THE NERVES. 229 The Nerve terminates at length by several short Branches upon the Adductor Indicis. The Nerves on the Palm and corresponding part of the Fingers, like the Arteries, are much larger than those of the opposite side of the Hand. The Palmar Digital Nerves send off many lateral Branches to the Integuments and other parts of the Fingers, and at their Apices each terminates by a Brush of Fibres. Between the Branches of the Radial and Ulnar Nerves, different Anastomoses are frequently found; and the same may be observed between the Nerves of the Palmar and Dorsal sides of the Fingers. Nervi Intercosto-Humerales. Besides the Nerves of the Superior Extremity sent from the Brachial Plexus, there are others belonging to it, which take their origin from the Intercostal Nerves, and which may therefore be termed Intercosto- Humerdles. The Intercosto-Humeral Nerves consist of a Branch from the Second, and of another from the Third In- tercostal Nerves; both of which pass out at the fore and lateral parts of the Thorax, the one under the Se- cond, and the other under the Third Rib. The First Nerve is joined by a small Branch with the Cutaneous Nerve, or with the Cutaneus Inter mis of Wrisberg, and is afterwards dispersed by numerous Filaments upon the Axillary Glands, and upon the In- teguments of the Axilla and of the inner part of the Arm.

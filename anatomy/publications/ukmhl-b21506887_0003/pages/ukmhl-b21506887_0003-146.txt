The remaining portion of the Anterior Tibial Artery afterwards advances between the Extensor of the Great, and long Extensor of the Small Toes, sending Twigs to the adjacent parts, and dividing, between the Meta- tarsal Bones of the Great Toe, and that next it, into a Large Posterior and a Small Anterior Branch. The Posterior Branch, termed Anastomotica Profun- da, which may be considered as the continuation of the Trunk, sinks between the Metatarsal Bones of the two first Toes, and anastomoses in the Sole with the Poste- rior Tibial Artery. The Anterior Branch runs forwards, under the name of Dorso-metatarsea, vel Dorsalis Pollicis, to be dis- persed upon the Great and Second Toes. Tibialis Postica.â€”The Tibialis Postica, somewhat larger than the Antica, divides about a finger's breadth under the origin of the Tibialis Antica, though some- times considerably lower, into the Fibularis, and Tibia- lis Postica strictly so called. FlBULARlS. The Fibularis, termed also Peronea, somewhat cor- responds with the Interossea Anterior of the Fore-arm. It is commonly smaller than, though,sometimes nearly equal in size to, either of the Tibial Arteries, and runs down at the inner side of the Fibula for a considerable way along the Leg. It is situated, first between the

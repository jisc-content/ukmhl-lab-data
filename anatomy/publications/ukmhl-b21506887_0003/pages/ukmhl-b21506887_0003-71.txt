Part V.] OF THE BLOOD-VESSELS. 51 tid, by a Trunk called Arteria Innominata; and on the left, to come off directly from the Aorta. Arteria Innominata. The Arteria Innominata, seu Anonyma, named also Bight Subclavian, scarcely two inches in length, ascends obliquely over the Trachea, at the right side of which it divides into the Right Proper Subclavian, and the Right Common Carotid. The Left Subclavian arises from the Arch of the Aorta, at the outside of the Carotid, and ascends to the upper part of the Thorax ; forming there a sharp- er curve than the Subclavian of the right side, and advancing till upon a level with the first Rib, before it gives off any Branches. After the two Subclavians have emerged from the Thorax, each passes transversely outwards at the under part of the Neck, behind the Origin of, the Sterno- mastoideus, and continues its course, first between the anterior and middle Scaleni, and then between the Subclavian Muscle and first Rib. After crossing the first Rib, it goes under the Pecto- ral Muscles to the Axilla, where it obtains the name of Axillary Artery.—In this course it sends off the following Branches, viz. The Vertebral;—the Internal Mammary;—and the Superior Intercostal.—The first of these has been al- ready described ; the two others belong to the inner part of the Thorax. It also gives off the Thyroidea Inferior, Cervicalis Anterior, Cervicalis Posterior, and Dorsdlis Scapula? Superior.

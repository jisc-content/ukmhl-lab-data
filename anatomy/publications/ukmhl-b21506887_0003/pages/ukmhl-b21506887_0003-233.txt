Part VII.] OF THE NERVES. SOI Where it begins to cross over the Carotids, it sends down a Branch of considerable size, termed Descendens Noni. The Descendens Noni passes down a certain length along with the Common Carotid Artery, and, in its course, furnishes Branches to the upper ends of the Omo-hyoideus and Sterno-thyroideus; after which it unites with Branches from the First and Second, and with small Filaments from the Second and Third Cer- vical Nerves, forming an Arch, from which long and slender Twigs go to the under Portions of the Sterno- thyroideus, and to the Omo-hyoideus and Sterno- hyoideus. The Ninth Nerve passes afterwards behind the Fa- cial and Temporal Veins, or the Trunk formed by these, and over the root of the Facial Artery,—send- ing a Twig to the Hyo-thyroideus. Upon the Hyo-glossus, the Trunk of the Nerve spreads out into many Branches, which go to the middle of the Tongue, and terminate chiefly in its Fleshy parts; a Twig extending as far as the Genio-hyoideus, and two, or sometimes, only one Filament, anastomose ing with the Lingual Branch of the Fifth Pair. Great Sympathetic Nerve. The Great Sympathetic Nerve,—obtaining its name from its numerous connexions with most of the other Nerves of the Body,—is either formed originally by the reflected Branch from the Second of the Fifth Pair, and by one or two, and sometimes three small Filaments, sent down from the Sixth Pair while in the

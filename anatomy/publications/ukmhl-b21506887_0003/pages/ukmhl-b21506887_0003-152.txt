180 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part V. It is at first composed of Veins derived from the up- per and inner part of the Dorsum Pedis, which have frequent anastomoses with each other, and are of con- siderable size. In its ascent, it is joined by Branches from the Super- ficial parts of the Leg, and, some way below the Knee, is frequently split into a Plexus. It receives Branches from the Superficial parts of the Thigh, and small Twigs from the Inguinal Glands. It perforates the Fascia Lata at the edge of the Fal- ciform Ligament, and terminates in the top of the Fe- moral Vein, nearly opposite to, or a little higher than, the origin of the Arteria Profunda. Saphena Minor. The Saphena Minor arises upon the outer side of the Foot, and afterwards passes behind the Malleolus Externus. From this it ascends, in the back part of the Leg, upon the Surface of the Gastrocnemius Externus, and goes into the Ham. It is formed originally by the Veins of the upper and outer part of the Foot, and is joined to the Saphena Major, over the Metatarsal Bones, by one or more Arches, which receive a Plexus of Branches into their lower or convex part. It is joined by the Superficial Veins of the outer and back part of the Leg, which have frequent anastomoses with each other, and with the Branches of the Saphena Major.

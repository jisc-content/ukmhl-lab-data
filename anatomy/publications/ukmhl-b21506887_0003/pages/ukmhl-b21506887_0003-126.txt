106 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part V. supply the place of the Sacrae Laterales, "and some- times also, though seldom, of the Sacra Media. They furnish Branches to the Muscles, Membranes, and Nerves, on the Surface of the Os Sacrum, and in- osculate by cross Branches with the Sacra Media. Their principal Trunks enter the Anterior Sacral Holes, to be distributed upon the Cauda Equina, and Membranes and Bones inclosing it. Arteria Glutea. This is sometimes termed Iliaca Posterior, and is the largest Branch of the Hypogastric Artery. Soon after it arises, it passes between the two Trunks or Heads of the Sciatic Nerve, goes afterwards through the upper part of the great Notch of the Os Ilium, and is reflected over the edge of that Bone, after the man- ner of the Inferior Dorsal Artery of the Scapula. Upon emerging from the Cavity of the Pelvis, between the Gluteus Medius and Pyriformis, and after giving Twigs to the Iliacus Internus and Pyriformis, it is di- vided into a Superficial and a Deep Set of Branches. The Superficial Set creep in between the Gluteus Maximus and Medius, upon the former of which they are chiefly dispersed. The Deep Set run in a radiated direction close upon the Bone, and are chiefly distributed to the two smaller Glutei, while Branches of inferior size run, some of them downwards to the Muscles and Ligaments about the Joint of the Thigh, and others backwards to the parts about the Sacrum. The Branches of this Artery, which are very exten-

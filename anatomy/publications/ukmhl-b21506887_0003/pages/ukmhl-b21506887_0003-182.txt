156 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part VI. Absorbents of the Great Intestines. The Asorbents of the Great are proportionally of an inferior size to those of the Small Intestines, and have seldom, though sometimes, been observed to be filled with Chyle. In their course, they go through the Meso-colic Glands, which are situated between the Layers of the Meso-colon, and are generally much less numerous, and also considerably smaller than those of the Me- sentery, or than most of the other Conglobate Glands of the Body. The Absorbents of the Cascum, and of the Right Portion of the Colon, join those of the Small Intestines, about the root of the Mesentery. Those of the Left Portion of the Colon accompany the Inferior Mesenteric Artery, and communicate with large Lymphatics near its root. They terminate at last in the Lumbar Glands, or go directly into the lower part of the Thoracic Duct. The Absorbents of the Tiectum go first into small Glands which' lie between it and the Os Sacrum, and afterwards terminate in the Lumbar Plexus of Glands and Vessels. Absorbents of the Liver. The Lymphatics of the Liver, like those of the other Viscera, run in two Sets; the Vessels of the Super- ficial Set are numerous, and unite into Trunks in the manner Hoots unite to form the Trunk of a Tree.

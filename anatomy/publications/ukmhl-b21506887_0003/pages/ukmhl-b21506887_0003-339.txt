Part VIII.] OF THE GLANDS. which belong to the Absorbent System, where the Glands appear first to have got their name. They are inclosed in a proper Membrane, are Orbi- cular or Oval, of different sizes, and situated near the Blood-vessels. They have no proper Duct, but receive the Lymph, and soon discharge it again. The Third Class comprehends those formed of Acini collected into a Mass, or of a Congeries of Lobules and Acini joined within a common Membrane by loose Cel- lular Substance, which braces them, and allows the Ves- sels and Nerves to pass between them. The Acini in some Glands are visible to the naked eye, but in others can only be seen by the aid of a Microscope. When viewed by a good Magnifier, the Acini are observed to be subdivided by Cellular Sub- stance into smaller parts, and these into parts still smaller, till the Eye loses sight of the division. From the Acini innumerable Excretory Ducts are sent out, which by degrees join into one or more com- mon Tubes, that carry out the Liquor they receive. To this Class belong the Mucous Glands of the Lips, Palate, and Root of the Tongue ; the Salivary Glands, Pancreas, Liver, and Kidneys ; some of the Glands of the Organs of Generation, as the Testes, Prostate, &c. The Brain, also, may be looked upon as a Gland, and ranked in this division. Besides these there are Anomalous Glands, Conglo- merate in their structure, but destitute of any apparent Excretory Duct. This Class includes the Thyroid, the Thymus, the Renal Glands, and the Spleen.

04 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part V. and is chiefly dispersed upon the Bellies of the Exten- sor Muscles of the Hand and Fingers, being commonly exhausted before it reaches the Wrist. Interossea Anterior. x The Interossea Anterior generally comes off immediately below the former, but at other times in Common with it. Now and then, both are from the Radial Artery; and this is for ordinary the case where that Artery takes its origin in the Upper Arm. Sometimes the Interosseae arise by a common Trunk from the Humeral Artery. The Anteri6r Interosseous Artery is considerably larger than the Posterior, but is only about half the size of the Ulnar Artery, from which it springs. It runs close upon the fore part of the Interosseous Ligament, and furnishes Branches to the Muscles and deep parts upon the anterior side of the Fore-arm, and the Nutritious Arteries of the Radius and Ulna. Near the Wrist, the principal part of the Artery per- forates the Ligament, and goes to the posterior side of the Carpus and back of the Hand, dividing there into Branches which inosculate with others of the Posterior Interosseous and Radial Arteries. The other part of the Artery is spent about the Ligaments on the fore- side of the Wrist. Sometimes the Interossea is con- tinued under the Anterior Annular Ligament of the Wrist, and terminates in one of the Palmar Arches. The Ulnar Artery, having given off its Recurrent Branch, and the Arteriae Interossea?, with many Late- ral Branches to the inner side of the Fore-arm, passes

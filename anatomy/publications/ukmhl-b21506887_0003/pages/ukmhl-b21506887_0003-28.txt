8 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part V. The Arteries divide something after the manner of the Branching of a Tree, or they form many divisions and subdivisions, before they reach their Termination, and at last become invisible to the naked Eye. The divisions formed by any single Artery have been variously enumerated by different Authors,—one, in particular, reckoning them at forty, and another, of equal respectability, only at twenty ; their number, however, is such as to allow them to supply the most minute parts of the Body. The strength of the Arteries depends upon the thick- ness of their Coats, which is found to vary in different Arteries.—In the Aorta, the Coats are thick and strong ;—in the Arteries of the Brain and Spleen, they are thin and tender ;—but the thickness and consequent strength are proportionally greater in the small Branches than in the large Trunks, as has been observed by fix- ing weights to them. The Arteries run more or less in a waving direction, which breaks the force of the Blood in them, and pre- vents them from being strained by the motions of the parts to which they belong. The Flexions are most frequent in Arteries belong- ing to parts, the size and situation of which are change- able, as in the Lips, Uterus, &c. The Windings of many of the Arteries are in pro- portion to the degree in which they are distended ; those which are nearly straight in their natural state, frequently becoming serpentine when their distension is increased, as appears evident in many parts of the Body, when their Vessels are well injected ; and this

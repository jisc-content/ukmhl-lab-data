Part V.] OF THE BLOOD-VESSELS. 115 Circumflex a Interna. The Circumflex a Interna, though most frequent- ly coming off from the beginning of the Profunda, often arises higher than it, from the common Femoral; sometimes it comes off in common with the Circuin- flexa Externa, and there are now and then two of them, one a little lower than the other. It passes between the under ends of the Psoas and Pectinalis, and afterwards turns round the inner part of the Neck of the Thigh-bone. It sends offâ€” Branches to the Pectinalis, Triceps, and Capsule of the Joint: A Superior and Anterior Ascending Branch, to the Triceps and Obturator, which has a considerable Anas- tomosis with the Obturator Artery at the external Mar- gin of the Foramen Thyroideum, though the commu- nication is not so visible as many have supposed. From this Branch a Twig is detached, which enters the breach at the under and fore part of the Acetabulum, to be dispersed upon the Ligamentum Rotundum and the Substance called Gland of the Joint. An Inferior, or Inferior Posterior Circumflex Branch, which is the continuation of the Trunk. It bends round the Neck of the Thigh-bone, sending small Branches to the Capsule of the Joint, to the Obturator Externus, Quadratus, and Adductores Femoris; com- municating with the Obturator, Sciatic, Hemorrhoi- dal, Gluteal, and Pudic Arteries. h 2

Part V.] OF THE BLOOD-VESSELS. 41 butes to the formation of the Circle of Willis,—or that kind of communication by which the Blood or In- jected Matter can pass readily across from one Inter^ nal Carotid to the other,—-or from these backwards to the Basilar Artery. The Circle of Willis incloses the Optic Nerves, the Infundibulum, and the Corpora Albicantia, and is of an irregular, or somewhat quadrangular figure, the size varying not only in different Subjects, but in the different sides of the same Body. Veins of the Outer Part of the Head, and of Part of the Neck. The smaller Veins which return the Blood from the Arteries of the outer part of the Head? and of part of the Neck, have a similar course with their corre- sponding Arteries; they unite into the following Trunks, viz. The Frontal Vein, which is formed by several Branches belonging to the Muscles and Integuments on the upper and fore part of the Cranium, and which is often single, returning the Blood then from both sides of the Fore-head. The Facial Vein, which is formed by the Frontal Vein, and by an intricate Plexus of Branches upon the Face. It winds obliquely downwards and outwards, at a distance from the Artery ; but, in crossing the Jaw, it goes close by the outside of that vessel, and termk nates in the External Jugular Vein.

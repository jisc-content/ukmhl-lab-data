66 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Patit V. subdivided into two Branches, one of which Branches of each Division runs along the Anterior Radial Mar- gin of one Finger, and the other along the Anterior Ulnar Margin of the Finger next it;â€”the three Digi- tal Arteries thus supplying the Margins of all the Fingers, excepting the Ulnar Margin of the Little Finger, and the Radial Margin of the Index. At the roots of the Fingers, each of the Digital Ar- teries receives a small Branch from the Arcus Profun- dus. At the Joints, but more particularly near the points of the Fingers, the Arteries communicate by cross Arches, and send Branches to the parts adjacent, an intricate Plexus being at length formed at the extre- mities of the Fingers. The Superficial Arch of the Palm commonly sends off one of the Arteries of the Thumb, and ultimately communicates by a large Anastomosis with the root of the Arteria Magna Pollicis. Veins of the Superior Extremity, and of part of the Neck. The Veins of the Superior Extremity have nume- rous Valves, and are divided into a Superficial and a Deep Set; the former lying immediately under the In- teguments, and chiefly above the Fascia, the latter ac- companying the Arteries, and taking their names from them. The Subcutaneous Veins have many large Anasto- moses with each other, particularly on the Fore-arm, where they unite, separate, and re-unite several times, thus forming a Plexus by which it is surrounded. They

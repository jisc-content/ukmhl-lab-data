Part VI.] OF THE ABSORBENTS. 161 whence it passes upwards, and afterwards appears in the Thorax, upon the fore and right side of the Spine5 between the Aorta and Vena Azygos, where it is sup- posed to be considerably assisted in impelling its Fluids by the strokes of the Aorta. In the middle of the Thorax, it is smaller than else- where, its diameter here being only about that of a wheat straw. After this it gradually enlarges, till it arrives at its general termination. In the Thorax, it receives the Lymphatics of the Spatia Intercostalia, one or two of which accompany each of the Intercostal Arteries, and the whole go through small Glands placed near these Arteries, but most numerous about the side of the Dorsal Vertebrae, where they form a sort of Chain. Here, likewise, it receives Branches from the Eso- phagus and Lungs ; the former of which is surround- ed by a number of Glands, and by a remarkable and intricate Plexus of Lymphatic Vessels. Absorbents of the Lungs. The Superficial Lymphatics of the Lungs form large Areolae, which have smaller Areolae within them; the larger Branches running chiefly between the Lobules, and the smaller passing over them in such a manner as to cover their whole Surface. From the Surface they go to the root of the Lungs, where they pass through the Bronchial Glands, which have already been taken notice of in the description of the Viscera of the Thorax. At this place they are joined by the deep-seated Lym- VOL. III. . l

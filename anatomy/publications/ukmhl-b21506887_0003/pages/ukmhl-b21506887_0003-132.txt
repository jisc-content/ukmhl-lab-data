110 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part V. Thigh in company with the Nerve, in the hollow be- tween the great Trochanter of the Thigh-bone and Tuber of the Ischium,â€”covered by the Gluteus Maxi- mus. Within the Pelvis, it sends Twigs to the Rectum, Obturator Internus, and Pyriformis. Without the Pelvis, it sends an Artery backwards, termed Coccygea, which creeps along the Posterior Sacro-sciatic Liga- ment ; some of its Branches perforating the Fibres of that Ligament. It is distributed upon the Coccygeus, the Levator Ani, the Fat and Bones of the Coccyx, and sends Branches upwards, which anastomose with some of the Lateral Sacral Arteries, through the Holes in the back part of the Os Sacrum. The Sciatica gives off also a Concomitant Branchy which passes along the Surface of the Sciatic Nerve. It sends Branches to the Glutei Medius et Mini- mus, to the Pyriformis and other Rotator Muscles of the Thigh, and to the Capsule of the Joint. The Principal Branches of the Sciatic Artery, how- ever, are dispersed upon the under part of the Gluteus Maximus, some Twigs being sent to the Muscles arising from the Tuberosity of the Os Ischium, which commu- nicate with the Obturator and Pudic Arteries. Iliaca Externa. The Iliaca Externa, vel Anterior, which ap- pears in an Adult as the continuation of the common Trunk, descends in tough Cellular Substance behind the Peritoneum, along the Brim of the Pelvis, taking a curved direction by the inner and fore part of the

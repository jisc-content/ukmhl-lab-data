From the Second Lumbar, and partly also from the First, the Spermaticus Internus is sent off, which perfo- rates the upper end of the Psoas, and descends near the Spermatic Vessels to the under part of the Abdomen. Near Poupart^s Ligament, and sometimes much higher, it splits into two Branches. In a Male, one of those Branches goes through the Abdominal Rings, to be dispersed upon the Pubes, Spermatic Cord, Scrotum, and Testis. In a Female, this Branch sends Fila- ments along the Round Ligament to the Uterus ; the remaining part going through the Abdominal Rings to the Mons Veneris and Labia Externa. The other Branch passes out with the Femoral Ves- sels, and sends Branches to the Inguinal Glands, and to the Integuments of the fore part of the Thigh. Another Branch is sent from the Second, or from the Second and Third Lumbars, termed Cutaneus Eoc- ternus, which passes behind the Psoas, and across the Iliacus Internus, to the Superior-anterior Spinous Pro- cess of the Os Ilium. It afterwards bends over the outer end of Poupart's Ligament, and descends in the anterior and external part of the Thigh ; dividing into Branches, which are chiefly dispersed upon the Inte- guments covering the Vastus Extern us; some Twigs extending as far as the Joint of the Knee. Branches of the Second, Third, and Fourth Lum- bars, form a Nerve of considerable size, called Obtura- tor or Sub-pubial) which passes between the External

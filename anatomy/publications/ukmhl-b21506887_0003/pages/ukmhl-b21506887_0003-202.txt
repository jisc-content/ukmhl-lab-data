Y, A lymphatic trunk from the mamma and adjacent parts of the thorax, entering glands near the axilla. Upon the Superior Extremities :—An extensive plexus formedby the superficial lymphatics, which pass from the anterior side of the extremity upwards, and re- ceive many branches which ascend in an oblique di- rection, from the opposite sides of the arm. At the Axillae :—The lymphatics of the superior ex- tremities entering the axillary glands. a, a, Principal trunks proceeding from the glands of the axilla?. b, The principal trunk of the left arm, terminating a- long with the thoracic duct. c, The thoracic duct receiving a lymphatic belonging to the neck, and terminating in the angle formed by the left internal jugular, and left subclavian veins. In the Right Side of the Neck :—-Some of the lymphatic vessels and glands which form the jugular plexus. d, The general termination of the lymphatic vessels of the right side of the head and neck, right arm, &c. in the angle formed by the right internal jugular, and right subclavian veins. N. B.—A much greater number of Absorbents were in- jected in the Preparation from which this Figure was taken, than are here represented,—none having been drawn excepting what could be distinctly seen, after the Preparation had been kept a considerable time in the dried state, and, of course, many Lymphatics so shrivell- ed as not to admit of accurate delineation.

128 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part V. The External Plantar Artery sends off— A considerable Branch, first to the under, then to the outer part of the Heel* which communicates ex- ternally with Branches of the Anterior Tibial and Fi- bular Arteries : Several Branches to the Flexors of the Toes, and to other parts in the outer portion of the Sole; which communicate, on the inner side, with the Branches of the Plantaris Interna, and at the outer, with those of the Anterior Tibial Artery. The Aecus Plantaris gives out— Several Branches to the deep Muscles of the Sole, particularly, Rami Interossei to the Muscles between the Meta- tarsal Bones :—and Perforating Branches, which, passing between the Metatarsal Bones, communicate with the Arteries on the upper part of the Foot: A Branch to the outer side of the Little Toe : Three Large Digital Arteries, which are forked at the roots of the Toes, and run along the edges of these in the manner the Digital Arteries do along the Fin- gers. Between the Metatarsal Bones of the Great Toe and the one next it, the Plantar Arch anastomoses with the Posterior or perforating Branch of the Anterior Tibial Artery, forming a large communication between the Arteries of the upper and under side of the Foot. Frequently it sends off here a Digital Artery, which forks and runs along the outer side of the Great Toe, and inner side of the Toe next it, so as to supply the

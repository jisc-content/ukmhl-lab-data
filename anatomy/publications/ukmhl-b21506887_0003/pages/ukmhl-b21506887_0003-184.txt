158 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part VI. either a principal Trunk, or a Plexus, which runs up, sometimes between the Layers of the Anterior Medias- tinum, and at other times in company with the inter- nal Mammary Blood-vessels on each side. When they run in the Anterior Mediastinum, they most frequently terminate in the upper end of the Thoracic Duct:—sometimes, however, they communi- cate with the general termination on the right side of the Neck. When they accompany the Internal Mammary Ves- sels, they are observed to terminate, the left in the Thoracic Duct, and the right in the general termina- tion of that side. The Lymphatics on the concave Surface of the Liver run towards the Porta, and join the Deep-seated Set. —One part of them goes over the under Surface of the Gall-Bladder, from which they derive numerous small Branches. The Deep-seated Lymphatics accompany the Blood and Biliary Vessels, and, communicating with the Su- perficial Absorbents already mentioned, pass through several Glands situated about the Trunk of the Vena Porta?, and terminate in the Thoracic Duct near the root of the Superior Mesenteric Artery. Absorbents of the Spleen. The Superficial Lymphatics of the Spleen are re- markably small. They pass from its convex to its con- cave Surface, where they join the Deep-seated Lympha- tics, which are very considerable in size and number. The Splenic Plexus of Lymphatics accompanies the

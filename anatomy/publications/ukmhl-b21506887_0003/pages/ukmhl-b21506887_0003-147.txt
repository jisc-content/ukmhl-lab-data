Its Branches are distributed to the Muscles, Integu- ments, and other parts at the outer side of the Leg in the neighbourhood of the Fibula,â€”a small Medullary Branch also penetrating the Substance of that Bone. The Branches of the Fibular Artery inosculate forwards with those of the Anterior Tibial, and backwards with the Branches of the Posterior Tibial Artery. A little above the Inferior Articulation of the Tibia and Fibula, it sends a Branch forwards, termed Fibu- laris vel Peronea Anterior, which perforates the Inter- osseous Ligament, and is dispersed upon the fore part of the Ankle, where it anastomoses with the external Branches of the Tibialis Antica. The continuation of the Trunk, sometimes termed Fibularis vel Peronea Posterior, descends behind the Malleolus Externus, to the outer and back part of the Foot, anastomosing with the External Malleolar and Tarsal Branches of the Tibialis Antica, and also with Ramifications of the Tibialis Postica., Tibialis Postica. The Tibialis Postica, properly so called, analo- gous to the Ulnaris, passes down at the back part of the Tibia, and runs over the Tibialis Posticus, and Flexor Digitorum, and under the Gastrocnemius In- terims, in its descent in the Leg. At the under part of the Leg it becomes more super- ficial, being covered only by Cellular Substance and the Tendinous Fascia. Here it runs between the Tendo

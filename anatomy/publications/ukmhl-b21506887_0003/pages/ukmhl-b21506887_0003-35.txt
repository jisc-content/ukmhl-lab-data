Part V.J OF THE BLOOD-VESSELS. 15 DISTRIBUTION OF THE BLOOD-VESSELS. Of the Pulmonary Artery and Veins. The Pulmonary Artery is nearly of the same size with the Aorta; it arises from the upper and left side of the Right Ventricle of the Heart, and ascends be- hind the Sternum, and within the Pericardium, inclin- ing a little to the left side. Having run as high as the concave side of the Arch of the Aorta, it divides into two Lateral Branches, which terminate in the Right and Left Lungs. The Right Branch, which is the largest, passes be- hind the Curvature of the Aorta and the Superior Vena Cava, and is of course also the longer of the two. The two Branches are dispersed throughout the Sub- stance of the Lungs, by Ramifications which accom- pany those of the Bronchi; and, becoming gradually smaller, terminate upon the Pulmonary Cells. From the extreme Branches of the Pulmonary Ar- tery, the Blood is returned by corresponding Veins. The Pulmonary Veins run contiguous to the Arte- ries, but, unlike the other Veins in general, are nearly of the same size with their Arteries. In their course they unite into larger Branches,

Part VII.] OF THE NERVES. 233 Pulmonary and Esophageal Branches of the Pars Vaga. The Pars Vaga, having transmitted the Recurrent Nerve, gives off Filaments, which form connexions with Branches arising from the Root of the Recurrent of the same and of the opposite side. They anastomose also by small Fibrillar with the Car- diac Branch of the Sympathetic, and then pass to the fore part of the Bronchi, where they constitute what is termed the Anterior Pulmonary Plexus of Nerves. The Anterior Pulmonary Plexus, thus formed by Branches from the Trunk of the Eighth Pair, with the assistance of others from the Recurrent and Sympa- thetic Nerves, extends across the Great Branches of the Pulmonary Artery, and, after transmitting small Filaments to the Pericardium and to the Great Cardiac Nerve, furnishes many minute Fibrillae, which accom- pany the Ramifications of the Bronchi and Pulmonary Blood-vessels in the Substance of the Lungs. From the Pars Vaga, a little below the origin of the Recurrent, and likewise from the Root of the Recur- rent, Nerves are sent off, which form a Plexus, that is dispersed, partly upon the Fleshy Glandular Sub- stance of the Trachea, and partly upon the Esopha- gus, which it embraces, forming upon it the Small Esophageal Plexus. Behind the Root of the Lungs, about six or seven Nerves of different sizes are sent off in a transverse di- rection, which are termed Posterior Pulmonary Plexus, although they have few connexions with each other.

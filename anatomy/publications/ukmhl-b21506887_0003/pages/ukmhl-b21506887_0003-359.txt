Part IX.] RULES FOR DISSECTION. 289 Dissection of the Ligaments on the Anterior Surface of the Peritoneum. To shew these Ligaments, mentioned in Vol. II. p. 212, make an incision through the Parietes of the Ab- domen, in the same direction with that in the Integu- ments ; but leave the Peritoneum entire, to allow them to be examined. They are seen projecting on the outer side of the Peritoneunij and intermixing at the Umbi- licus with the Tendinous Fibres of the Linea Alba. After examining the Ligaments, puncture the Peri- toneum near the Umbilicus, then divide it carefully, so as to allow the Parietes of the Abdomen to be raised and turned back without wounding the Intestines. Dissection of the Chylopoietic and Assistant Chylopoietic Viscera. Previously to the disturbing of the Viscera, observe their general situation in the Abdomen—Vol. II. Tab. XXVII.;—the smooth shining appearance of the Peri- toneum ; its rough external surface ; and the manner in which it lines the Abdomen, and covers its contents. Attend next to the situation of the Lobes and Liga- ments of the Liver,—-Vol. II. p. 240,—the Capsule of Glisson, and Foramen of Winslow, with the extent and connexions of the two Omenta.—Vol. II. p. 228. Trace after this, the situation and course of the Sto- mach and different Intestines; the small Guts occupy- ing the middle of the Abdomen, and the Colon sur- rounding them.—Vol. II. p. 212. Tab. XXVI. VOL III. T

Thej run first over the fore part of the Bodies of the four uppermost Lumbar Vertebrae, and afterwards go between them and the Psoae Muscles, in their way towards the Parietes of the Abdomen. They give Branches to the Spine, to the Spinal Mar- row and its Membranes; are particularly dispersed upon the Lumbar Muscles, and upon the Transversus and Obliqui Abdominis ; and, perforating these, they also furnish Branches to the large Muscles and the In- teguments in the back part of the Loins. They communicate with the lower Intercostal, Dia- phragmatic, Internal Mammary, and Epigastric Arte- ries, and also with their fellows of the same side.

It generally sends off a Branch over each side of the

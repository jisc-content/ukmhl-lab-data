Part V.] OF THE BLOOD-VESSELS;. 7 There are no Valves belonging to the Arteries, ex- cepting those which are placed at the Mouths of the Pulmonary Artery and Aorta. Where the Arteries run a certain way without send- ing off Branches, they are observed to be of a Cylindri- cal form ; but where Branches come off, their capacity is diminished, the diminution being in proportion to the number of their Ramifications. Wherever an Artery divides into two Branches, the Area of these two Branches, taken conjunctly, is found to be nearly one half larger than the Area of the Trunk from which they issue, though this has been differently stated by different Authors. When the Trunk and Branches of an Artery are re- garded collectively, they appear evidently of a Conical figure; the point of the Cone being formed by the Trunk, and the Basis by the Branches of the Artery. The Section of the Arteries, in the distended state, is circular ;—-when empty, they become flatter, but do not collapse entirely, on account of their elasticity. The Angles at which the Branches go off from their Trunks vary in different parts of the Body; they are in general more obtuse or acute, in proportion to their vicinity to the Heart, and are such as are most favour- able to the parts they have to supply. The acute angle is the most common. In the Trunk of the Body, or where they belong to tender and delicate Viscera, the Angles are more ob- tuse,—in the Extremities they are more acute; the former circumstance tending to diminish, and the latter to increase, the force of the Blood.

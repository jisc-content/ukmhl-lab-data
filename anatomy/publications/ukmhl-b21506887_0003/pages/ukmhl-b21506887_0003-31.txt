Part tij OF THE BLOOD-VESSELS. II can be distinctly traced as continued from the other, though without our being able to fix upon the point where the one set ends and the other begins. The Coats of the Veins are the same in number with those of the Arteries, but are much thinner and denser, and less elastic when taken in a longitudinal direction, but the reverse when considered transversely ; yet from late experiments they are found to be proportionally stronger. Their Coats, like those of the Arteries, are thicker, however, in proportion, in the small Branches than in the Trunks. In the large Veins, as the Vena Cava, the Coats can be separated from each other; but in the small Branches their separation is difficult. About an inch in length of each of the Venae Cava?, next the Heart, has scattered Fibres between the outer and inner Coats, somewhat similar to those of the Auricles. The Muscular Coat of the Veins being loose like Cellular Substance, much thinner, and more indistinct than that of the Arteries, has occasioned its existence to be denied by many Authors. The Veins are also furnished with their Vasa Vaso- rum, similar to, and from the same source with those of the Arteries. The Colour of the Veins is bluish, and, when full of Blood, in consequence of the thinness of their Coats, they appear of a purple tinge. Their size is generally more than double that of the Arteries to which they belong. Haller thinks the Area of the whole Venous System to that of the Arte- rious, is about nine to four ; but the Pulmonary Veins

56 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part V. nal Scapulary Artery, turns round near the Cervix of the Scapula, between the Inferior Costa of the Bone and the Teretes Muscles, to the Fossa Infra-spinata. Upon the Posterior Surface of the Scapula, it spreads out into Branches of considerable size, which are dis- persed upon the Muscles covering the under and back part of the Bone, and extend also to the Capsular Li- gament ; while the Trunk, ascending, inosculates with that of the Superior Dorsal Artery of the Scapula, whereby an Arch common to the two Arteries is form- ed under or at the root of the Acromion. ArtErle Circumflex^. The Circumflex Arteries are two in number, one termed Anterior, the other Posterior. The Circumflex a vel Articularis Anterior, is sent off between the Subscapularis and Teres Major. It passes in a transverse direction between the Heads of the Coraco-brachialis and Biceps, and body of the Os Humeri, immediately below the Joint of the Hu- merus. It is dispersed upon the Muscles which cover it, and upon the Periosteum and Capsular Ligament of the Joint; anastomosing with Branches of the Dor- salis Scapulae Inferior. The Circumflex a vel Articularis Posterior, arises directly opposite to the former, and is by much the larger of the two. It passes first between the Subscapularis and Teres Major, and then turns round between the back part of the Os Humeri, and Long Head of the Triceps, and the Deltoides. It sends branches to the Periosteum

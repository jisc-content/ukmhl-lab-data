Part VII.J OF THE NERVES. 215 Sub-Occipital Nerve. The Sub-Occipital Nerve was formerly called Tenth Nerve of the Head, and by many at present is termed First of the Neck. It arises from the beginning of the Spinal Marrow by an anterior and posterior Fasciculus, like the rest of the Spinal Nerves; and, like these also, it has its Gan- glion, where it passes out between the Bones. It perforates the Dura Mater immediately under the entrance of the Vertebral Artery, and goes forwards under that Vessel, and over the Transverse Process of the Atlas. It afterwards appears on the fore part of the Neck, and is connected above by an Arch to the root of the Ninth Nerve, and below by a similar Arch to the first Cervical Nerve. Anteriorly, it is joined by one or two short Branches to the upper Ganglion of the Great Sympathetic Nerve. It afterwards divides into Branches, which are dis- tributed upon the Recti et Obliqui Capitis, and upon some of the Deep Extensors of the Head. First Cervical Nerve. The First Cervical Nerve comes out between the Atlas and Vertebra Dentata, and immediately splits into two parts ; the first of which passes forwards under the Transverse Process of the Atlas, and is joined by an Arch with the Nervus Accessorius, and by Branches with the Ninth Pair : It is also connected by a soft

Part IX.] RULES FOR DISSECTION. 801 fore part, in the left side of the Thorax. Examine the situation of the Heart in its empty state ; then, by in- troducing a Pipe into the cut Vena Cava* under the Diaphragm, inflate the Right Auricle and Ventricle. In a similar manner, by a Pipe introduced through the divided Coeliac Artery into the Aorta, distend the left side. While the Heart is kept distended* observe the situa- tion of its different Cavities with respect to the Ribs and Sternum, and of the large Vessels communicating with the Heart After distending the Heart, inflate the Lungs, and observe their general appearance. Having examined the situation of the Heart and Lungs, the Sternum may be removed, to allow them more readily to be separated from the Body for farther investigation. In raising the Bone, attend to the for- mation of the Anterior Mediastinum, and to the origi- nal seat of the Thymus Gland* In perforating this piece of Dissection, divide the Superior Cava at its origin, and the Inferior one where it perforates the Diaphragm. Cut across the Ascend- ing Aorta, directly below the origin of the Carotid and Subclavian Arteries. Divide the Trachea as high in the Thorax as possible, and separate the Heart and Lungs from the Thorax ; leaving the Posterior Medias- tinum, and the parts it contains, for future examination. Previously to laying open the Cavities of the Heart, distend them again with Air, and examine their shape, size, and general appearance. Afterwards slit open longitudinally, with Scissars, the Right Auricle at its fore side, and examine the different parts within it.

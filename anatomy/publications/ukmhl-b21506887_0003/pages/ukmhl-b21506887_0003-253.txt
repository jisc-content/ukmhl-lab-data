Part VII.] OF THE NERVES. m\ It runs down at the inner and fore part of the Arm, near the Radial Nerve. It sometimes gives a small Branch to the upper part of the Coraco-brachialis and Biceps ; and farther down it gives others to the Integuments and Coats of the Blood-vessels. About the middle of the Arm, it splits into two Branches,â€”an Internal and External. The Internal Branch, which is rather the smaller of the two, passes before the Basilic Vein, to the inner part of the Elbow, where it divides into Branches ; two of which, larger than the rest, turn obliquely over the Heads of the Flexors of the Hand, to be dispersed up- on the inner and back part of the Fore-arm. The External Branch divides into several others, be- hind the Median Basilic Vein, which descend on the Anterior and Ulnar side of the Fore-arm, as far as the Wrist. They pass partly over and partly under the Sub- cutaneous Vessels; furnishing Twigs to these, and vanishing in the Integuments. Nervus Cutaneus Internus Minor of Wrisberg. Besides the Nervus Cutaneus, there is another, term- ed Cutaneus Minor Internus of Wrisberg, which, like the rest of the Nerves of the Superior Extremity, takes its origin from the Axillary Plexus ; but is more par- ticularly connected with the Ulnar Nerve. It is con- siderably smaller than the Nervus Cutaneus. It soon separates from the Ulnar, running afterwards between it and the inner side of the Arm.

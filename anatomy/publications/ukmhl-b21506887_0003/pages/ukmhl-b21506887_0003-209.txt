Part VII.] OF THE NERVES. 9 t$j In their progress, they divide into Branches, which separate into others still smaller; and which, when taken collectively, are little different from the size of the Trunks from which they issue. The Branches generally go off at acute angles; but in several places they have a retrograde direction. They have commonly the same kind of distribution in the opposite sides of the Body, and vary little in this respect in different Subjects. In some parts of the Body, several Nerves unite to- gether, and form a Plexus ; in others, they join into a Common Trunk ; and in many, a number of Nerves unite together, and form a hard Knot, termed Gan- glion. In some parts, a Ganglion is found upon the Trunk of a single Nerve. When the Plexuses or the Common Trunks are mi- nutely examined by slitting open their Coverings, it is found that their Fibrillse are intermixed in such a man- ner, that each of the Nerves passing out from the Plex- us, or from the Common Trunk, is composed of Fi- brillse from several, or from all the Nerves which en- tered it, in consequence of which, the Organs in gene- ral are furnished with Nerves from various sources. The Ganglia differ from each other in size and figure: Some of them are little larger than the head of a com- mon-sized pin, while others are upwards of half an inch in one direction or other. They have thicker Coats, are more Vascular, and generally firmer than the Nerves ; and are larger than the whole of the Nerves, taken conjunctly, which enter into or go out from them. â€”They are supposed to serve as fresh sources of Ner_ VOL.

Part VII.] OF THE NERVES. 175 The Nerves, soon after leaving the Bones, have the Dura Mater so intimately connected with them, that it has been considered by some Authors, as degenerating into condensed Cellular Substance, notwithstanding it still retains the general appearance of the Dura Mater. When the Cellular Texture connecting the Fibrillar of the Nerves is exposed to an Alkaline Solution, it appears like a bundle of hollow Tubes, the Medul- lary Matter being destroyed. This Substance is now known by the name of Neurilema. If, instead of using an Alkaline Solution, the Nerves be macerated a short time in Muriatic Acid, the Neu- rilema is then dissolved; the Nervous Filaments are at the same time hardened, and may be separated from each other and examined. The Fibrillar inclosed in the Neurilema, vary in size in different Nerves. They are commonly so much smaller than fine hair, as to require the assistance of a Microscope before they can be distinctly observed. The Neurilema of the Nerves within the Cranium and Spine, is observed to consist of Pia Mater. Upon examining the Nerves, especially the small ones, in a living or recently dead Animal, they are ob- served to have numerous White Lines placed transverse- ly, or in a serpentine direction. When the Nerves are moderately stretched, this ap- pearance becomes less evident; and when extended considerably, or when macerated in water, it vanishes entirely. Prochaska, (De Came Musculari), supposes these serpentine Lines to be owing to a decussation of Ves-

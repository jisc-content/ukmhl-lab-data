16 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part Y. which, after leaving the Lungs, form four principal Trunks,â€”two from the Right, and two from the Left Lung, which, after perforating the Pericardium, ter- minate in the Left Auricle of the Heart, at its upper and lateral parts; of these Trunks one is Superior, and the other Inferior, on each side. The Superior passes before the corresponding Artery, the Inferior behind the Branches of the Trachea. The Trunks of the Veins of the right side, like their Arterv, are longer than those of the left, General Coarse of the Aorta and Vena Cava. The Aorta arises behind the Pulmonary Artery, from the upper and back part of the Left Ventricle of the Heart, opposite the third Vertebra of the Thorax, and sends off, at its Origin, the Coronary Arteries, for- merly described. Where it takes its Beginning, it turns a little to the right, and is afterwards directed upwards, backwards, and towards the left side- It ascends as far as the top of the second Dorsal Vertebra, under the name of Aorta Ascendens, and is afterwards reflected obliquely back wards over the Right Branch of the Pulmonary Artery, and root of the Left Branch of the Trachea, till it reaches the third Verte- bra of the Back, forming what is termed the Curva- ture or Arch of the Aorta. It then becomes Aorta Descendens, which runs down close upon the Spine, till it reaches the fourth Vertebra of the Loins, where it divides into the two Iliac Arteries.

Part VII.] OF THE NERVES. 207 On the inner side of the Ligamentous Lining, the Dura Mater is situated, which passes out of the Cra- nium by the Foramen Magnum Occipitis, and forms a Cylindrical Sheath, which loosely envelopes the Spi- nal Marrow, and extends as far as the Os Sacrum. It is more elastic than the Dura Mater of the Brain, and thereby admits more readily of the different mo- tions of the Spine. At its egress from the Cranium, it is intimately con- nected to the beginning of the above-mentioned com- mon Ligamentous Lining, and is also united with the Pericranium of the edge of the Foramen Magnum of the Occipital Bone. Below the first Vertebra of the Neck, this intimate connexion between the Dura Mater and inner Liga- ment of the Vertebrae is discontinued; a Cellular, Fatty, and Slimy Substance, which surrounds the Dura Mater throughout the rest of the Canal, being interposed be- tween that Membrane and the Ligament. The Dura Mater is only in contact with the Tunica Arachnoidea, and this also only in contact with the Pia Mater, and lying so loosely over the latter, that, by making a puncture in it, and distending it with Air, it may be separated from it with facility through the whole length of the Spine. The Spinal Marrow, like the Brain, consists of a Cortical and Medullary Substance, but differs in this respect, that the Cineritious Matter is placed within the Medullary. It differs also from the Medulla Oblonga- ta, in containing a smaller proportion of Medullary Matter. Chaussier is of opinion, and this is confirm- ed by some other Authors, that the Medullary Sub-

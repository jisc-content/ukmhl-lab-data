Part VII.] OF THE NERVES. 219 Clavicle; and to the Seventh, the First Dorsal Nerve is added over the First Rib. The Four Inferior Cervicals and First Dorsal Nerve are of great size,—especially the Fifth, Sixth, and Se- venth-Cervicals. They pass out between the Scalenus Anticus and Medius, and afterwards run between the Subclavius and First Rib, at the outer side of the Subclavian Artery, to the Axilla. Axillary, or Brachial Plexus. In the Axilla, the Nerves mentioned above separate, unite, and separate again, forming an irregular Plexus, termed Axillary or Brachial, which surrounds the Ax- illary Artery. In the Axillary Plexus, the Nervous Fibrillae are so intermixed, that each of the Trunks passing out from it, may be considered as being formed of Fibres from most of the Nerves which enter into its compo- sition. The Axillary Plexus sends Branches to the Subsca- pularis, Teres Major, and Latissimus Dorsi, and fur- nishes the External Thoracic Nerves which accompany the Blood-vessels of that name to the Pectorales, Mamma, and Integuments. The Plexus afterwards divides into Nerves, most of which are remarkably large, to supply the Superior Extremity.—They are as follow :

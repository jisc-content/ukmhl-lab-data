4 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part V The Principal Trunks run in such parts of the Body as are least exposed to danger, deriving support or de- fence from the Bones along which they pass ; and the larger Arteries are generally seated deeper than the corresponding Veins. The Arteries are placed in the Cavities of the Body, or in the bending sides of the Joints, or between the Processes of ^Bones, or in the Grooves, or in Ca- nals formed in the Bones, to prevent the Blood from being impeded in its course. The largest Arteries are in general deep-seated^ while the smaller Branches run more superficially; on the contrary, many of the large Veins, particularly those of the Muscles, run directly under the Skin, while Veins of inferior size are found in the deeper parts of the Body. The largest Arteries go to the Viscera within the Great Cavities, the smaller ones to the Skin and Mus- cles, and those still smaller to the Bones, and, in cer- tain places, they become so extremely minute as alto- gether to exclude the red Blood, carrying a colourless Fluid only. The greatest number of Arteries go to active Or- gans, as the Muscles, Glands, and Organs of the Senses. A more scanty allowance of Branches is given to the Bones, Tendons, and Ligaments. The Arteries, when empty, are distinguished from the Veins, by the whiteness of their colour, and thick- ness of their Coats. They are composed of different Layers or Coats, which are readily separated by Dissection. In several parts of the Body, as in the Posterior Me-

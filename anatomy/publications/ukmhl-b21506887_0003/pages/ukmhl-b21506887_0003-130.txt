108 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part V. situated at the upper and inner part of the Thigh ;—• the two Sets of Branches inosculating with each other. When the Obturator comes off from the External Iliac, it commonly goes directly into the Pelvis, but sometimes it make a Curve by the inner side of Gim- bernat's Ligament, and is then found on the fore part of the protruding Bowel in Crural Hernia; but this circumstance happens more frequently where the Obtu- rator arises from the root of the Epigastric. The Trunk common to these two Vessels varies from a quarter to upwards of an inch in length. Where it is long, the Obturator is then apt to take such a turn as to go by the inner side of the Crural Arch, and to be found on the Anterior Surface of a Femoral Hernia. Arteria Umbilicalis. The Umbilical Artery sends off Rami Vesicales from its under part or beginning ; the rest of it, in an Adult, being shrivelled into Ligament, as already ob- served. Vesicalis Ima of Haller. This is a long and slender Branch which frequently comes off from the root of the Pudic, at other times from the Hypogastric near the Umbilical, and runs to the under part of the Bladder, and to the Prostate Gland. Arteria Uterina. The Uterine, or Uterine Hypogastric Ar- tery, is dispersed upon the Uterus, as has been al- ready described.

6 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part V. small Arteries, but paler in the large vessels, especial- ly in the Aorta. Each Fibre appears to form only the Segment of a Circle, although the whole constitute a Cylinder round the Artery. The Fibres of the second Coat are closely compact- ed together, and formed into Layers, which can be separated from each other, especially in the Great Ar- teries, and still more particularly in those of large Ani- mals. By the contractility of this, and the elastic nature of the former Coat, the Arteries are enabled to drive the Blood to the Veins, in proportion as they receive it from the Heart;â€”and this contraction is called the Systole of the Arteries. The Third or Inner Coat resembles the inner lining of the Heart. It is formed of a transparent Mem- brane, remarkably thin, smooth, and dense, by which the Blood is prevented from transuding. The different Coats of the Arteries are connected to each other by fine Cellular Substance, which some Au- thors have considered as forming so many Lamellae. The Arteries are supplied with their own Blood-ves- sels, termed Vasa Vasorum, which come from the near- est small Branches, and are every where dispersed upon their external and middle Coats, none being ob- served on the internal one. They have also their Lymphatics, which on the large Arteries, as the Aorta, are so numerous as sometimes to cover them. They are likewise furnished with small Nerves, form- ing in some parts of the Body, a Plexus, which vanishes in their external Coat-

52 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part V. Thyroidea Inferior. The Thyroidea, vel Gutturalis Inferior, arises at the outer side of the Vertebral Artery, previous to the passage of the Subclavian under the Scalenus. It ascends obliquely inwards in a winding manner behind the Carotid Artery, gives Branches to the Trachea, which descend into the Thorax ; also Twigs to the La- rynx, Pharynx, and Esophagus ; while the most con- siderable part of the Artery is dispersed upon the Thy- roid Gland, inosculating with the Laryngea Superior. Cervicalis Anterior. The Cervicalis Anterior, vel Superficialis, fre- quently comes off from the root of the Inferior Thy- roid. It ascends behind the Sterno-mastoideus, fur- nishing Superficial Branches to the Muscles which go from the Trunk of the Body to the Neck, and Deep Branches to the Glands, Nerves, &c. lying on the fore and lateral parts of the Cervical Vertebra?. The deep Branches anastomose with the Vertebral and Occipital Arteries ; and some passing through the Intervertebral Holes where the Nerves come out, com- municate with the Spinal Arteries. Cervicalis Posterior. The Cervicalis Posterior, vel Transversalis Colli, arises in common with the Anterior Cervical, or with the Inferior Thyroid.â€”This is larger than the

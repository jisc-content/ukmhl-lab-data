Part V.] OF THE BLOOD-VESSELS. 123 lateral direction, to the Muscles and Integuments on the outer and fore part of the Leg; many minute Ramifications spreading out also upon the Periosteum. The Malleoli Interna, which comes off near the lower end of the Tibia, and is dispersed on the parts about the inner Ankle: The Malleoli Externa, which arises a little lower than the former, and is distributed to the parts near the outer Ankle. The Arteria Tarsea, which takes it origin a little before the bending of the Ankle-joint, and is more con- siderable in size than the Malleolar Branches. It passes obliquely outwards and forwards under the Extensor Brevis Digitorum, and sends Branches to the Joint of the Ankle, where it communicates with the Malleolar Arteries. It supplies the greater part of the Muscles, Integu- ments, &c. on the upper and outer part of the Foot, and sends Branches, termed Interossea?, to the Muscles between the Metatarsal Bones of the small Toes,â€” which, however, are frequently derived from the Meta- tarsal Artery: Branches from the Artery upon the Dorsum Pedis, distributed upon the Integuments, Muscles, Membranes, and Bones, at the upper and inner side of the Foot: The Arteria Metatarsea, which goes off about the middle of the Dorsum Pedis, and passes obliquely to- wards the root of the Little Toe, assisting the Arteria Tarsea in furnishing Branches to the upper side of the Foot and Toes, and sometimes, in part or entirely, supplying the place of that Artery. The above is the common origin, course, and distri-

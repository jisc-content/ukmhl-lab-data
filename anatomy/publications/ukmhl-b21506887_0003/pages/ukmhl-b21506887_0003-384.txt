314 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part IX. heated, especially the coarse, to something more than the Finger immersed in it can easily bear, and then thrown in quickly, so as not to be in danger of being cooled till the operation is finished, and with a force sufficient to drive it to the extreme Vessels, but with- out occasioning any rupture. After the Vessels have been injected, and the Body sufficiently cooled, it is ready for Dissection; and the Arteries being now filled with Substances which greatly resist putrefac- tion, the parts are less liable to decay ; the Dissection, therefore, may be performed a Capite ad Calcem. Dissection of the Blood-vessels and Nerves be- longing to the Parts covering the Skull-cap. Dissect off the Integuments as thinly as possible, from the upper part of the Head, as far as the Super- ciliary Ridges, Zygomatic Processes of the Temporal Bones, and the large Arch of the Occipital Bone. Shew the Branches of the Frontal Artery,^—Vol. III. p. 34, —of the Temporal Artery, p. 29,—of the Occipital Artery, p. 24,—of the corresponding Veins, p. 41,— and Nerves, p. 185, 196. Dissection of the Blood-vessels of the Brain. Cut the Integuments from the Nose to the Occiput, and turn them down over the sides of the Head. Saw the Cranium in a circular direction, a finger's breadth above the Superciliary Ridges and Lateral Sinuses, and remove the Skull-cap.

Part ?| OF THE BLOOD-VESSELS. 39 Basilar Artery. The Basilar Artery runs along the middle of the Tuber Annulare, which it slightly impresses, and lies upon the Cuneiform Process of the Os Occipitis ; hav- ing there the Dura Mater and Tunica Arachnoidea be- tween it and the Bone. From the sides of this Artery numerous Filaments run transversely, to be dispersed upon the Tuber and adjacent parts. One Branch, larger than the rest, called Auditoria Interna, passes between the two portions of the Seventh Nerve to the Internal Organ of Hearing. At the extremity of the Cuneiform Process of the Occipital Bone, and at the upper and fore part of the Tuber Annulare, the Basilar Artery divides into four principal Branches, two to each side; viz. the Anterior Cerebelli, and Posterior Cerebri, and these go off al- most at right angles from the Trunk. Arteria Anterior Cerebelli. The Arteria Anterior, vel Superior Cere- belli, turns round the Crus Cerebri, expands its Branches upon the upper part of the Cerebellum, and sinks into its substance, supplying also the Walls of the fourth Ventricle, the Nates, Testes, and parts near them.

286 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part IX. thinness of the Partition between the Eye and the Brain, and dissect the different Muscles in the Orbit;—attend to the large quantity of soft Fat surrounding the Mus- cles. Lay in view the Lacrymal Gland, and shew the si- tuation of the Optic Nerve.—Vol. II. Tab. XXI. Next remove the Eye-lids and Orbicularis from the edges of the Orbit, then separate the Levator Palpe- bral, and all the other Muscles within the Orbit, with the Lacrymal Gland, the Tunica Conjunctiva, Eye- lids, and Lacrymal Sac, from the Ball of the Eye. Put Wires into the Puncta Lacrymalia, and pass them into the Lacrymal Sac. Cut upon one of the Wires, to shew the size of the Lacrymal Passages. Introduce a Probe, bent near its point, from the Nose upwards, into the Lacrymal Sac. Shew the Lacrymal Gland, and Chain of Glands from it. Dissect the inner Lining from the Eye-lids to expose the Glandulae Sebaceae. Pin down the sides of the Eye-ball to a wooden Plate, to allow the different Coats, Humours, &c. to be exposed. Slit open the Dura Mater of the Optic Nerve, and af- terwards divide the Sclerotic Coat, longitudinally, from the insertion of the Nerve to the edge of the Cornea. A little behind the edge of the Cornea, cut the Scle- rotic half round, and turn its Flaps in a lateral direc- tion. Cut the Choroid Coat also longitudinally, and re- flect it to each side, to shew the Retina.

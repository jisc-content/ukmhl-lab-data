202 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part VII. Cavernous Sinus; or, according to the opinion of some Authors, the Sympathetic sends off these small Nerves to join the Fifth and Sixth Pairs. Upon the Surface of the Internal Carotid, while in the Carotic Canal/ the Branches of the Fifth and Sixth Nerves and Great Sympathetic making this connexion, are pulpy and tender, and form a Plexus which sur- rounds the Carotid Artery. From this Plexus the Trunk of the Sympathetic is most frequently consider- ed as being sent out. After escaping from the Carotic Canal, the Trunk, which is here of small size, is closely connected, for a short space, with the Trunks of the Eighth and Ninth Nerves, and, separating from these, it expands into a large Ganglion, termed Ganglion Cervicale Superius, of a long oval form, which is situated opposite to the Se- cond Cervical Vertebra. From this Ganglion, the Nerve comes out very little increased in size, and descends on the Anterior Vertebral Muscles of the Neck, behind, and to the in- ner side of, the Pars Vaga of the Eighth Pair of Nerves, with which, and with the Carotid Artery, it is connected by a Sheath of Cellular Substance. At the under part of the Neck, and nearly where the Inferior Laryngeal Artery turns towards the Larynx, the Sympathetic forms another Ganglion, termed by some Authors Cervicale Medium, and by others Ccriti- cal e Inferius. The Inferior Cervical Ganglion is somewhat similar in shape and size to the Superior, though it varies con- siderably in these respects in different Subjects. From this Ganglion principal Branches are sent down,

t Part VI.] OF THE ABSORBENTS. 159 Splenic Artery, and goes through several Glands of a dark colour, scattered along the Surface of that Vessel. The Lymphatics of the Spleen receive those of the Pancreas, which run into them in a transverse direc- tion. In their course, they unite with the Lymphatics of the Stomach, and those descending from the under part of the Liver, and the whole of them, near the Head of the Pancreas, form a considerable Plexus. From this Plexus Branches are sent off, some passing over the Duodenum, and others under it, and all of them going into the Thoracic Duct, near the termination of the Lacteals. Absorbents of the Kidney and Capsula Renalis. The Lymphatics of the Kidney are seldom seen, ex- cepting when it is enlarged or ulcerated ; in which case they may sometimes be distinctly observed. The Superficial Absorbents run from its outer to- wards its inner edge, where, meeting with those deep- seated, they commonly unite with them, and form a Plexus which accompanies the Renal Blood-vessels, after which they pass through some of the Lumbar Glands, and terminate in large Lymphatics near the Aorta. The Lymphatics of the Capsula Renalis, which are numerous in proportion to its size, terminate in the Renal Plexus.

Part V.] OF THE BLOOD-VESSELS. 45 name from the Whirls composed by their Branches; the course of which has been compared to a Jet (PjEau, or to the Spiral Ridges upon the points of the Fingers, &c. Of these Veins, four, or sometimes five, are by much the most conspicuous ; the rest being smaller, and hav* ing less of the Vorticose appearance* The Branches of each of the four principal Venae Vorticosae run in a Congeries, unite at acute angles into larger Branches which have a curved direction, and these, proceeding from all sides, meet in a point, and form the Trunk of the Vein. The Trunks of these Venae Vorticosae, thus placed in the centre of their respective Whirls, are situated at the opposite sides of the Eye, and perforate the Scle- rotic Coat obliquely near its middle. The rest of the Venae Vorticosae, or smaller Ciliary Veins, communicate with the adjacent larger Vorticose Veins upon the Surface of the Choroid Coat, and also perforate the Sclerotica near its middle. After piercing the Sclerotica, the Vorticose Veins re- ceive a number of minute Twigs which paint the Cellu- lar Substance covering the Surface of the Sclerotica. The Ciliary Veins run in a Serpentine direction at the opposite sides of the Eye, and pass, either sepa- rately, or united with other small Veins in the Orbit, into the Trunk of the Ocular Vein. The other Venous Branches within the Orbit corre- spond in a great measure with their respective Arteries. They consist ofâ€” Branches from the Palpebral and inner Corner of

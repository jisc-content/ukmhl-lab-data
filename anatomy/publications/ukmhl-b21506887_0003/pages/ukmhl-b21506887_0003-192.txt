166 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part VI. do not appear to enter any Glands till they reach those of the Axilla. A few Lymphatics accompany the Cephalic Vein, and receive Branches from the outer part of the Arm; and after passing between the Pectoralis and Deltoides, penetrate Glands at the under side of the Clavicle. Of the deep-seated Lymphatics, two commonly ac- company each principal Artery in the Fore-arm ; and these, uniting at the Elbow, form two principal Ves- sels, which accompany the Trunk of the Humeral Artery. Having reached the upper part of the Arm, they enter the Axillary Glands, where they are joined by Lymphatics which come from the Mamma and lateral parts of the Thorax, after passing through small Glands placed upon the under edges of the Mamma and Pectoralis Major. The Superficial Lymphatics of the containing parts of the Thorax, in general, with the Absorbents from the Integuments and Muscles of the Scapula, run in a radiated manner ; those from the upper parts passing downwards, those from below going upwards, and those from the middle running in a transverse direction, to terminate in the Axillary Glands, each Set entering the Glands of its respective side. The Axillary Glands vary in number and size in different persons. They are somewhat smaller andfewer in number than those of the Groin ; they are generally surrounded by a considerable quantity of Fat, and are situated in the hollow between the Pectoralis Major and Latissimus Dorsi; adhering closely to the Trunks of the Axillary Blood-vessels and Nerves.

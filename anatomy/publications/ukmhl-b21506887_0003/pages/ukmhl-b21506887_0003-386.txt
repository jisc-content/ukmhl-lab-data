316 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part IX. Dissection of the Blood-vessels and Nerves of the Eye and its Appendages. Cut off the Supra-orbitar Plate by means of a Chisel and Mallet, to shew first the Periosteum ; then divide this, to expose the Fourth Nerve and Frontal Branch of the Fifth one. Next separate as much of the Cel- lular Substance and Fat as possible, to allow the diffe- rent Vessels and Nerves to be traced, as described in Vol. III. p. 31, 43, and 182. Dissection of the Common and of the External Carotid Arteries, and their Corresponding - Veins. Right Side.—Divide the Integuments longitudinally at the fore part of the Neck, and reflect them outwards. Remove also the Skin from the side of the Face, and trace the different Branches of the Facial Artery,—see Vol. III. p. 21,—and Vein, p. 41. Left Side.—Dissect the parts corresponding with those seen in the Right Side, then cut the Platysma Myoides from the Lower Jaw and Clavicle, and turn it outwards. Divide the Sterno-mastoideus at its ori- gin and insertion, and turn it back ; guarding against cutting the Nerves which pass through it. Lay in view the Carotis Communis, its division into External and Internal Carotids; and afterwards the different Branches of the External Carotid,—see Vol. III. p. 18,—and the corresponding Veins, p. 41.

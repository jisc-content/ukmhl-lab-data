These consist of the following Branches, viz. the Intercostalis Superior, and Intercostales Inferiores. Intercostalis Superior. The Intercostalis Superior, vel Intercostalis Subclavia, comes off from the Subclavian Artery, a little farther out than the Mammary one, or sometimes from one of the Branches of the Subclavian. After sending a branch upwards to the Deep Muscles and Nerves at the under and fore part of the Neck, it de- scends between the Pleura and first Rib, near the Spine, and sends off two or three Branches, which pass be- tween the External and Internal Intercostal Muscles, supplying an equal number of the uppermost Inter- costal Spaces; and one or two Branches, which go backwards to the Spine and Spinal Marrow, and to the Muscles of the Back and Neck. The Branches of this Artery communicate, in the Neck, with others of the Subclavian, and in the Tho- rax with each other, and with the Mammaries. Intercostales Inferiores. The Intercostales Inferiores, vel Aortic^, are nine or ten Pairs, the number varying with that of the Superior Intercostal Branches. They arise from the lateral and back part of the Aorta, and run in the

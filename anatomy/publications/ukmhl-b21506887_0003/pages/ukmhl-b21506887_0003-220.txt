188 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY.] Part VII. dispersed upon the parts belonging to the Upper J aw, from which it has its name. It goes through the Foramen Rotundum of the Sphenoid Bone, and at its exit divides into numerous Branches, viz. The Spheno-Palatine, or Lateral Nasal Nerve, which sends a reflected Branch through the Foramen Ptery- goideum of the Sphenoid Bone, to join the Sympathetic Nerve in the Canalis Caroticus, and a Branch which enters the Foramen Innominatum of the Pars Petrosa, to join the Portio Dura of the Seventh Pair. The Lateral Nasal Nerve goes afterwards into the Spheno-Palatine Hole, to be dispersed upon the under and back part of the Septum, and opposite side of the Nostril, and upon the Membrane of the Sphenoidal Si- nus and Eustachian Tube : One Branch, in particular, after passing along the Septum, goes through the Fora- men Incisivum to the Roof of the Mouth. The Palato-Maxillary, or Palatine Branch, which descends in the Canal leading to the Foramen Palati- num Posterius, and, having passed through the Fora- men, runs near the Alveoli with considerable Blood-ves- sels, and sends Branches to the Velum Palati and Roof of the Mouth, and minute Filaments which penetrate into the Palate-Plate of the Superior Maxillary Bone. Small Branches, which pass round the Upper J aw, and vanish in the Cheek. A Twig, which goes through the Hole in the Os Malae, along with a Branch of the Ocular Artery, to the Face. Small Filaments, which run down into the back part of the Superior Maxillary Bone, and supply the Sub-

16^ COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part VI. phatics, which creep along the Branches of the Trachea and of the Pulmonary Blood-vessels. Through the medium of the Bronchial Glands, the Lymphatics of the two sides of the Lungs communicate freely with each other. Having left the Glands, the principal part of those from the Left Lung forms a Trunk of considerable size, which terminates in the Thoracic Duct, behind the Bifurcation of the Trachea. The rest of the Absorbents of the Left Lung pass through Glands behind the Arch of the Aorta, which are likewise common to the Lymphatics of the Heart. They run at last by a principal Trunk into the Thora- cic Duct near its termination. After leaving the Bronchial Glands, the Absorbents of the Right Lung form a few principal Trunks, one of which commonly ascends on the fore part of the Vena Cava Superior, and, running in a convoluted manner, opens into the Trunk which terminates in the Veins in the right side of the Neck. The rest of these Trunks go into the Thoracic Duct, near the Bifurcation of the Trachea. Absorbents of the Heart. The Absorbents of the Heart are small, but nume- rous, and form principal Trunks which accompany the Coronary Arteries, and, like them, the largest belong to the Left Ventricle. From the side of the Right Coronary Artery, an Ab- sorbent Trunk, which corresponds with it, passes over

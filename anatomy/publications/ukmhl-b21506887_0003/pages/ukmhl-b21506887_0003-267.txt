Part VII.] OF THE NERVES. 235 The Trunk, arising in this manner from different sources, passes between the Superior Cava and ascend- ing Aorta, to the posterior Surface of the latter, and joins the Cardiac Branches of the left side. By the addition of the Left Cardiac Nerves, a Plexus is formed, termed Plexus Cardiacus Magnus of Hal- ler, from which is sent out a long Ganglion of a soft consistence, described by Wrisberg under the name of Ganglion Cardiacum, From the Cardiac Ganglion, the following Branches are given off, viz. A Branch which, after transmitting Filaments to the' Anterior Pulmonary Plexus of the Eighth Pair, passes behind the right Division of the Pulmonary Artery to the left Coronary Plexus of the Heart: One or two Filaments, which unite with others sent from the Anterior Pulmonary Plexus of the Eighth Pair, and go before the Right Branch of the Pulmo- nary Artery to the Base of the Heart: Branches of considerable size, passing partly over the right side of the Aorta, and partly between it and the Pulmonary Artery, to the Anterior Coronary Plexus: Small Branches which unite with others coming from the Trunk of the Great Cardiac Nerve, and pass over the Aorta also to the Anterior Coronary Plexus. The Nervus Cardiacus Minor arises from the undermost Cervical Ganglion, creeps over the Arteria Innominata and Aorta, and terminates in a Plexus formed by the Cardiac Nerves on thejleft side of the Aorta Ascendens. The Left Cardiac Nerves are, the Cardiacus Su- perficialis, and the Cardiacus Magnus Profundus.

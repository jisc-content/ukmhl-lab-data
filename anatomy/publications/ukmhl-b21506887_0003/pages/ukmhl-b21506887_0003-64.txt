44 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part V. of the Retina along with those of the corresponding- Artery. The Vena Centralis enters the Optic Nerve, where the Artery leaves it; and a little behind the Ball of the Eye, emerges from the Nerve, and runs between it and the Sheath which covers it; receiving many Twigs from the Nerve and its Membranes. It passes afterwards under the Fasciculus of Nerves which belongs to the Eye, and terminates sometimes in the Ocular Vein, but, in general, directly in the Ca- vernous Sinus. From the Iris and Choroid Coat, the Blood is re- turned by the Short or Anterior Ciliaryr, and by the Long or Posterior Ciliary Veins, and also by a princi- pal Set of Ciliary Veins, termed Vasa Vorticosa. Small Veins return from the Iris, which go under the Arterious Circle to the Veins of the Choroid Coat, and communicate with each other ;—but without form- ing any Circle such as is found in the Eyes of Oxen, and which corresponds, in them, with the Arterious Circle. The Short Ciliary Veins pass from the Iris through the Sclerotic Coat, near the same part where the An- terior Ciliary Arteries enter. The Long Ciliary Veins, like the Arteries, are com- monly two in number, and of a smaller size than the Vorticose Veins. They run from the Iris backwards along the Choroid Coat, communicate in their passage by minute Branches with the Vorticose Veins, and afterwards perforate the Tunica Sclerotica behind. The Vena? Vorticosce are numerous, and obtain their

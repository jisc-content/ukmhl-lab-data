In this course, it does not send off any Branches, excepting sometimes a Twig to the Peritoneum, Psoas Muscle, coats of the corresponding Vein, and the Lym- phatic Glands, till it is about to leave the Abdomen, where it gives rise to two principal Arteries,â€”the Epi- gastrica, and Circumfleoca Ossis Ilii. Arteria Epigastrica. The Arteria Epigastrica goes off from the inner side of the External Iliac Artery, immediately before that Vessel gets under the Ligament o/*Po^jpart, but is found on the outer side of the Peritoneum. At its Origin it is a little bent downwards ; and a- bout half an inch from the place where it first comes off, it crosses obliquely upwards and inwards, at the inner side of the upper Abdominal Ring, behind the Spermatic Cord in a Male, and Round Ligament in a Female. It commonly passes in such a manner as to lie first behind, then at the inner side of a common Inguinal Hernia ; though in somes cases the reverse of these has occurred. It continues its oblique course, under the inferior part of the Transversus, till it reaches about as high as half way between the Symphysis Pubis and Umbilicus, af- ter which it takes a perpendicular direction along the back part, and at the outer side of the middle of the Rectus Muscle.

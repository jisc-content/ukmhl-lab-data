220 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part VII. Neevus Scapularis. The Scapularis, which commonly arises from the combination of the Fourth and Fifth Cervicals, and, extending outwards, runs through the Semilunar Arch in the upper edge of the Scapula, afterwards descend- ing between the Root of the Spine and Head of that Bone. It furnishes Branches to the Supra-Spinatus, and is ultimately spent upon the Infra-Spinatus. Nervus Articularis. The Articularis arises, like the former Nerve, from the Trunk common to the Fourth and Fifth Cervicals. It sinks deep in the Axilla, and, getting between the under edge of the Subscapularis, and insertions of the Teres Major and Latissimus Dorsi, it follows the course of the Posterior Circumflex Artery, round the Body of the Os Humeri, immediately below the Ar- ticulation. It sends Branches to the Teres Minor, and some Twigs to the Ligament of the Joint; but is chiefly dispersed upon the Deltoides. Nervus Cutaneus. The Nervus Cutaneus arises from the Trunk com- mon to the last Cervical and first Dorsal Nerve ; but is principally formed by Fibrillae from the latter.

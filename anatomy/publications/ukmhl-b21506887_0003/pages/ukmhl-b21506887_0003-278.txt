246 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part VII. Hypogastric Plexus. The Hypogastric Plexus, the origin and course of which have been already mentioned, is connected by different Nerves to the adjacent Trunks of the Great Sympathetic and Sacral Nerves, and sends many Branches to the Rectum, Bladder, and Spermatic Ves- sels in a Male; and to the Rectum, Bladder, Ute- rus, and Vagina, in a Female.—The Nerves of the Uterus are proportionally small.—they pass into its Substance at the Cervix Uteri, and follow the course of the Blood-vessels. Nervi Spermatici. The Spermatic Nerves are very minute; they con- sist of a Superior or Internal, and of an Inferior or External Set of Capillary Branches. The former are derived from the Renal or Aortic Plexus, and accompany the Spermatic Blood-vessels in their course through the Abdomen, and afterwards in their descent to the Testicle. The latter are sent off from a Branch of the second Lumbar Nerve, which, running near the Spermatic Vessels, detaches a Filament, which, in a Male, goes in the Spermatic Cord towards the Testicle, but is more particularly dispersed upon the Cremaster. In a Female, Filaments are reflected from it along the Ligamentum Rotundum to the Uterus,

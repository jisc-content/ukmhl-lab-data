Arteries. The Arteries are strong elastic Canals, which convey the Blood from the Heart to the different parts of the Body, and, during life, are distinguished from the Veins by their Pulsation. The original Trunks of the Arteries, or those which arise from the Heart, are two in number,â€”the Pulmo- nary Artery and Aorta. From these all the other Ar- teries are derived.

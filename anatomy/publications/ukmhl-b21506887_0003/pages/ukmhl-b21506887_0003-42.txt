22 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part V. goes under the Stylo-hyoideus, and Tendon of the Di- gastricus. It perforates the Submaxillary Gland, mounts suddenly over the side of the Lower Jaw, at the under and fore part of the Masseter, from whence it proceeds in a tortuous manner, between the Zygo- matic and Buccinator Muscles, to the Angle of the Mouth, and then by the side of the Nose, towards the inner Corner of the Eye. In this course, it sends the following Branches to the adjacent parts: The Palatina Inferior, vel Ascendens, which runs upwards upon the side of the Pharynx, covered by the Stylo-hyoideus, to be dispersed, by a Superficial and a Deep Palatine Branch, upon the Muscles attached to the Styloid Process and Palate, and upon the Velum Palati and parts near it: A Branch spread out by many Twigs upon the Ton- sil, and reaching as far as the Tongue: Branches to the Inferior Maxillary Gland: Small Branches to the Root of the Tongue, to the Skin, Muscles, &c. near the Angle of the Jaw : The Arteria Submentalis, which advances between the Platysma Myoides and Mylo-hyoideus, and also between the anterior Belly of the Digastricus, and the Base of the Lower Jaw, furnishing Branches to the Submaxillary Gland, the Skin, Mylo-hyoideus, Chin, and Under Lip : A Branch, upon the outside of the J aw, to the Mas- seter : The Labialis Inferior, which arises a little higher than the former, and goes to the lower part of the Un-

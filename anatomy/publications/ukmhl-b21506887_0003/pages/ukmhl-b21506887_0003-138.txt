116 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part V, Circumflex a Externa. The Circumflex a Externa arises for the most part nearly opposite the former, but frequently a little lower. Now and then it has a double origin, one of the Trunks coming off higher than the other. It passes outwards between the upper ends of the Rectus, Tensor Vaginae Femoris, and Vastus Exter- nus, and over the root of the Trochanter Major of the Os Femoris. It sends Branches upwards to the under part of the Glutei, and to other Muscles placed at the inferior and back part of the Pelvis, which anastomose with those running down from the Arteria Glutea. Others which have more of a lateral direction, and are distributed upon the Skin and Muscles at the upper and back part of the Thigh, upon the Muscles more immediately about the Joint, and also upon the Pe- riosteum,â€”communicating with the Branches of the Circumflexa Interna. The largest Branches descend between the Rectus Femoris and Vastus Externus; one, longer than the rest, reaching almost as far as the outer part of the Knee. Sometimes an External Pudic Branch is derived from this Artery, which more frequently comes off from the Trunk of the common Femoral. Rami Perforantes.

183 Part VII.] OF THE NERVES. Third Pair. The Third Pair, or Motores Oculorum, or Com- mon Oculo-Muscular Nerves, smaller than the Optics, arise at the under, inner, and back part of the Crura Cerebri, between the Corpora Albicantia and Tuber Annulare, by numerous Threads, which are soon collected into their respective Trunks. They pass outwards, perforate the Dura Mater at the side of the Posterior Clinoid Process, and, running along the upper part of the Cavernous Sinuses, at the outside of the Carotid Arteries, they go through the Foramina Lacera into the Orbits. Upon entering the Orbits, each of them divides into several Branches, which supply the greater number of the Muscles of the Eye, in consequence of which, the Nerves have obtained their particular name. A Branch runs to each of the Muscles within the Orbit, excepting the Trochlearis and Abductor ; and the Nerve likewise assists in forming a small Ganglion, termed Ophthalmic, from which Twigs are sent off, to supply the Ball of the Eye. Fourth Pair. The Fourth Pair, or Pathetic, or Internal Oculo-Muscular, have their origin the highest of the Cerebral Nerves, and are the most slender of the Body, being generally formed of one Fasciculus only on each side, though this Fasciculus, by coagulation, may be divided into smaller parts.

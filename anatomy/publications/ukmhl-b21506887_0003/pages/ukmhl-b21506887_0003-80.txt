60 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part V. on its outer, and the Pronator Teres and Flexors of the Fore-arm on its inner side. About an inch below the Elbow, it commonly divides into two principal Arteries, the Radial and Ulnar. It happens, however, now and then, that this division takes place directly over the Joint of the Elbow ; at other times about the middle of the Arm ; and not un- frequently as high as the Axilla. In some very rare instances, the Humeral Artery divides upon the Arm into two portions, which again unite into a Trunk, that afterwards divides in the common way. Some- times the Artery divides into the Radial, Ulnar, and Interosseous Branches. In Lusus Naturae of this kind, the Branch sent off in the Humerus, whether it be the Radial, Ulnar, or Interosseous, is commonly situated in the vicinity of the Trunk ; or if there be an equal division, the two Arte- ries, or Trunks, have nearly the same situation which the Trunk has in common cases, and, like it also, are continued under the general Aponeurosis. Radialis. The Radialis passes over the Pronator Teres, and runs on the fore part of the Radius through the whole length of that Bone. It descends between the Supi- nator Longus and Flexor Carpi Radialis, resting on the Flexor Longus Pollicis. At the upper part of the Fore-arm it is covered by the Supinator Longus: In its descent, it becomes more superficial, and, at the under part of the Fore-arm, lies close upon the Radius, and immediately under the Skin

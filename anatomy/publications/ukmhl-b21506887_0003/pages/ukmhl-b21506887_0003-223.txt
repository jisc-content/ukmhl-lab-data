Part VII.] OF THE NERVES. 191 dulla Oblongata, at the part common to the Tuber An- nulare and Corpora Pyramidalia, and are the smallest of the Cerebral Nerves, the Fourth Pair excepted. They perforate the Dura Mater at the inner side of the entrance of the Fifth Pair, and run forwards with- in Cells of the Cavernous Sinuses, but so surrounded by Cellular Substance, as to seem to be protected from the Blood of that Receptacle. While in the Sinus Cavernosi, each is situated be- tween the Opthalmic Nerve and Carotid Artery, upon the Surface of the latter of which it sends off two or three Filaments, to assist in forming the Great Sym- pathetic Nerve. The Trunk of the Sixth Pair afterwards goes through the Foramen Lacerum, to be dispersed entirely upon the Abductor Oculi. Seventh Pair. The Seventh Pair is composed on each side of two portions,â€”the Portio Mollis, and the Portio Dura. The Portio Mollis is the softest of the Nerves ex- cepting the Olfactory. It arises by transverse Medullary Striae, from the anterior part of the Fourth Ventricle, and is separated from its fellow of the opposite side only by the Crena of the Calamus Scriptorius. The Striae, turning round the Medulla Oblongata, apply themselves to the Tuber Annulare, from which they receive an addition of Substance, and then get to the side of the Portio Dura. The Portio Dura, sometimes also called Sympathe-

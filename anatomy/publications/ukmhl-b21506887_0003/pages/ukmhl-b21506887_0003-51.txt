Part V.] OF THE BLOOD-VESSELS. 31 tine manner, which prevents the Blood in it from rush- ing too quickly and forcibly upon the tender Substance of the Brain. Contrary to the nature of other Arteries, the Internal Carotid is of a conical form, though it does not send off any Branches till it enters the Cranium. While at the side of the Sella Turcica, it furnishes small Twigs to the Dura Mater and parts adjacent, viz.—a Branch which passes through the Pars Petrosa to the Tympanum,—a Branch termed Posterior,—and another termed Anterior Artery of the Cavernous Si- nus, which go to the Dura Mater, Glandula Pituitaria, and Nerves at the side of it. As soon as the Carotid perforates the Dura Mater, at the root of the Clinoid Process, it transmits the Ar- teria Ophthalmica. Arteria Ophthalmica. The Arteria Ophthalmica is the principal Ar- tery belonging to the Eye and its Appendages. Immediately after it comes off from the Carotid, it enters the Foramen Opticum, and creeps under the Optic Nerve, included in the Dura Mater, towards the outer part of the Cavity of the Orbit. After proceeding some way through the Orbit, it tra- verses its Cavity, between the Optic Nerve and Depres- sor Oculi, taking a spiral direction towards the Nose. In this course, it first transmits Filaments to the Dura Mater and Substance of the Optic Nerve, and to the beginning of the Muscles in the bottom of the Orbit; after which it gives off the following Branches, viz.

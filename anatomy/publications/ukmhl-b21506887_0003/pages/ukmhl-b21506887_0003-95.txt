Part V.] OF THE BLOOD-VESSELS. 75 Grooves at the under edges of the Ribs, between the Intercostales Externi et Interni, and, of course, are covered by the Pleura. Towards the fore part of the Thorax, each sends off a Branch to the upper edge of the Rib below it. They furnish Branches to the Spine, to the Spinal Marrow and its Membranes, to the Intercostales, Pleura, and other parts adjacent; also numerous Branches to the Muscles on the outside of the Tho- rax, and communicate with each other, with those of the Internal and External Mammary, and with the Diaphragmatic Arteries. The first of the Aortic Intercostals inosculates with the Superior, or Subclavian Intercostals ,*â€”the last, passing behind the Crus of the Diaphragm, goes over the Quadratus Lumborum, and follows the Margin of the Twelfth Rib, to be distributed upon the Tendon of the Transversalis Abdominis. When there are thirteen, or only eleven Ribs, the number of Intercostal Arteries corresponds with that of the Ribs. Veins. The Blood sent to the Thorax by the Arteriae Mam- marise Interna?, Bronchiales, Esophageal, and Intercos- tales, is returned to the Heart by the following Veins, viz. The Mammarl^e Interna, which accompany their corresponding Arteries, and terminate, the Left in the Left Subclavian, and the Right in the Right Subcla- vian, or in the top of the Vena Cava.

210 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part VII. Pia Mater. It sends off from its outer edge about twenty slender Processes, in the form of Denticidi, which carry the Tunica Arachnoidea along with them, and, running more or less in a transverse direction, are fixed each by minute Fibres to the Dura Mater, in the interstices of the Fasciculi. The Ligamenta Denticulata of the right and left sides, incorporate with the Pia Mater at the inferior extremity or conical point of the Spinal Marrow, and form a Ligamentous Filament, which is continued down- wards among the Nerves that form the Cauda Equina. It perforates the under end of the Dura Mater, and is fixed by small Fibres to the Membranes covering the Os Coccygis, in the manner the Denticuli are fixed to the Dura Mater. It is termed by some Authors Ligamentum Pice Ma~ tris. It is of a whitish colour, of a fibrous nature, and was considered by the Ancients as the Fortieth Pair of Nerves. It assists in preventing the Spinal Marrow and the tender origin of the Nerves from being overstretched. Having got between the Vertebras, each of the poste- rior Bundles of the Nervous Fibrillaa forms a Ganglion, from the opposite end of which a Nerve comes out, and is immediately joined by the anterior Bundle, thus con- stituting the beginnings of the Trunks of the Spinal Nerves. The Nervous Cords sent out from the Spinal Marrow, after receiving their Coverings from the Dura Mater, become considerably larger than the Fasciculi which form them ; as has been already observed in the general description of the Nerves.

302 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part IX. Make next an incision from the Mouth of the Pul- monary Artery to the Point of the Heart, guarding against injuring the two Sets of Valves. Then cut open the whole length of the Pulmonary Artery, excepting its beginning, and the Valves, which ought to be left entire. Lay open two of the Pulmonary Veins, then the left Auricle and Ventricle, in a similar manner with what was done to the corresponding parts of the right side. Inject the Thoracic Duct from its under extremity, and as many Lymphatics as possible going into it, with coarse Injections of a soft consistence ; but first tie up the Left Subclavian Vein, to prevent the Injection from escaping.â€”Vol. II. p. 200. Vol. III. p. 160, 162. Separate from each other the two Layers of the Me- diastinum, and then examine the structure of the diffe- rent parts it contains. Raise a portion of the Platysma Myoides, and origin of the Sterno-mastoideus in the left side of the Neck, and shew the termination of the Thoracic Duct. Examine the structure of the Lungs, Vol. II. p. 193, as far as can be done by the assistance of a Knife. Dissect the different Coats of the Trachea, and the Mucous and Bronchial Glands. Distend the whole, and then a part of the Lungs, and attend to the communication between the Tracheal Branches and Cells. In one of the Lobes of the Lungs slit open and fol- low a Branch of the Trachea into the Cells, and trace next the corresponding Artery and Vein. In the left side of the Thorax, attend to the motions, and shew the Capsular Ligaments of the Heads of

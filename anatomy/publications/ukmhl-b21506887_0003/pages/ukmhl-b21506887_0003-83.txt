Part V.] OF THE BLOOD-VESSELS. 68 commonly runs superficially upon the Aponeurosis of the Fore-arm, in which case the Radial appears as the continuation of the Trunk of the Humeral Artery. Near the Wrist, it becomes more superficial, and runs between the Tendons of the Flexor Carpi Ulnaris and Flexor Digitorum Sublimis, to the Hand. In this course it sends off many Branches to the Fore-arm, among which the following are the most considerable, viz. the Recurrens Ulnaris, Interossea Posterior, and Interossea Anterior. The Recurrens Ulnaris runs deep among the Flexor Muscles, and soon divides into Branches, which ascend and supply the parts about the posterior and inner side of the Elbow and Capsule of the Joint.â€”In the Groove behind the Inner Condyle of the Os Humeri, it com- municates by distinct Anastomoses with the Profunda Inferior, or with the Ramus Anastomoticus, sent down from the Humeral Artery. Interossea Posterior. The Interossea Posterior comes off at the upper end of the Interosseous Ligament, perforating that Substance immediately after coming off from the Ul- naris, and going to the back part of the Fore-arm. From this place it sends upwards a Recurrent Branch, which communicates, upon the back part of the El- bow, with the other Recurrent Arteries, and with the Branches sent down from the Humeral Artery, and forms along with these a Plexus of Vessels upon the posterior part of the Joint. The Interossea is afterwards continued downwards,

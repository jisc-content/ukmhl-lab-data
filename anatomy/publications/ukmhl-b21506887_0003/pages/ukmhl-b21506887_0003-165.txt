Part Vl.j OF THE ABSORBENTS. 139 Lacteals carry a white Fluid, called Chyle, which, on account of the thinness of the Coats of the Vessels, readily appears through them. At other times, they carry a Colourless Fluid or Lymph, to be mixed with the contents of the Lymphatics. In a Human Body, and in Quadrupeds, the Chyle has the appearance of Milk. It has a sweet and some- what saline^taste. By allowing it to remain at rest for some time, and exposed to the Air, it is said to afford Cream, and also to coagulate. It is found to contain Albumen, Serum, and different kinds of Salts, and, ac- cording to some, Saccharine Matter. When a Person has died a few hours after taking too great a quantity of Food, the Lacteals have been observed gorged with Chyle; and, upon opening the Abdomen of a Dog, &c. three or four hours after the Animal has taken Food, the Lacteals are found full of this Fluid. At longer periods than that just men- tioned, the whiteness of the Fluid diminishes ; and where the Animal has fasted twenty-four hours, the contents of the Lacteals are colourless. General Termination of the Absorbents. Most of the Lymphatics, and all the Lacteals, ter- minate in the Thoracic Duct, by which the Lymph and Chyle are conveyed to the Red Veins, and mixed with the Blood; after which these Fluids pass through the Lungs, where they undergo various changes. The large Veins in the bottom of the Neck are the common place of termination ; no facts nor observa-

Â£00 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part VII. and another from the Great Sympathetic; and is con-, nected by a Filament to the Pharyngeal, and sometimes also by one to the Internal Laryngeal Nerve. It imparts Twigs to the Middle and Lower Constric- tors of the Pharynx, and afterwards terminates in the Thyroid Gland and inner part of the Larynx. The Filament, sent from the Pars Vaga, at the bot- tom of the Neck, joins the Great Cardiac Branch of the Sympathetic Nerve in the upper part of the Thorax, to be dispersed upon the Heart. Ninth Pair. The Ninth Pair, frequently termed Linguales, and sometimes also Linguales Medii, and Hypo-glossal Nerves, arise from the under and outer part of the Corpora Pyramidalia, on the fore side of the Medulla Oblongata, by numerous Filaments, which are collect- ed into Fasciculi that are placed in a row, one over another in each side. They gradually converge so as to form two Trunks which pass out at the Superior Condyloid Foramina of the Occipital Bone, after which they adhere, for some way, to the Eighth Pair, by Cellular Substance. A little below the Cranium, each of the Trunks of this Pair of Nerves is conjoined by a cross Branch with the Sub-occipital Nerve, or with an Arch which con- nects that Nerve and the First Cervical together. The trunk then descends between the Internal Ju- gular Vein and Internal Carotid Artery, and at the root of the Occipital Artery crosses over both Carotids to its place of destination.

Part VII.] OF THE NERVES. 225 Nervus Radialis. ' The Radial, or Median Nerve, comes from the middle and lower part of the Plexus. It is formed by Fasciculi from all the Nerves which enter the Plexus, and is nearly of a similar size with the Spinal Nerve. It descends in the Arm, along the anterior Surface of the Humeral Artery, to which, and to the Deep Veins, it adheres closely by Cellular Substance. In this course, it does not give off any considerable Branches:â€”Twigs, however, are sent from it to the Coats of the adjacent Vessels. At the bending of the Elbow, it slips over the Ten- don of the Brachialis Internus, and perforates the back part of the Pronator Teres. It afterwards descends between the Flexor Radialis and Musculus Sublimis, and goes in the middle of the interval of the Radial and Ulnar Artery in its way to the Hand. When it approaches the Fore-arm, it transmits Branches to the Pronator Teres and Integuments near that Muscle. In the Flexure of the Arm, it furnishes Branches to the Pronator, Flexor Radialis, and Flexor Sublimis, and an Interosseous Branch, which, in some Subjects, receives an addition from the Spiral Nerve. < The Interosseous Nerve gives Branches to the Flexor Longus Pollicis, and.to the Flexor Profundus Digito- rum, descends upon the Interosseous Ligament with the Vessels of that name, and terminates in the Prona- tor Quadratus. vol. in. r

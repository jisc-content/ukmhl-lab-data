Part IX.] RULES FOR DISSECTION. 309 between the Muscles. Remove all that part of the Fas- cia from which the Muscles do not directly take their origin, except what forms the Posterior Ligament of the Wrist. Cut the Palmaris Brevis, with part of the Skin, and turn it towards its origin. Preserve entire the Liga- mentum Annulare Anterius. Clean the Sheaths of the Tendons of the Fingers, cut and open the Sheath of the Middle Finger, to shew the difference this produces with respect to the Tendons. Dissection of the Burs,e Mucosa of the Superior Extremity. Clean their Surfaces, and then cut into them and examine their Cavities.—See Vol. I. p. 320—323. Dissection of the Ligaments of the Superior Extremity.—Vol. I. p. 343. Previously to the Dissection of the Ligaments, consi- der how far it may be proper to attend here to the Dislocations. Clean the surfaces of the different Ligaments, by se- parating all the Muscles, &c. entirely from them, ex- cept the Interossei. Examine the effects of the Ligaments on the Bones, then lay open the several Joints. Attend now to the Interosseous Muscles, which can be seen to more ad- vantage than formerly. Take a view also of the Ossa Sesamoidea.—Vol. I. p. 171.

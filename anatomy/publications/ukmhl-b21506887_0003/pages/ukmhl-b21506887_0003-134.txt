112 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part V. Near its Origin, it sends Branches to the adjacent parts of the Pubes, one of which, in a Male, fre- quently runs to the Spermatic Cord, and in a Female to the Round Ligament of the Uterus ; the Branch to the Cord running to the Cremaster and Scrotum, and anastomosing with the Spermatic and Pudic Arteries, and that to the Round Ligament, going sometimes as far as the Uterus. Under the Umbilicus, it generally divides into two Branches, variable in their size; one directed towards the Umbilicus, the other continued in the line of the Rectus. It furnishes Branches to the Muscles, Integuments, and Membranes of the fore part of the Abdomen, com- municates in several places with the Lumbar and Ilio- Lumbar Arteries, and with its fellow of the opposite side, and terminates a little above the Umbilicus, where it forms several distinct, though small Anastomoses, with the under end of the Mammaria Interna. Circumflex a Ossis Ilix. The Circumflex a Ossis Ilii, sometimes termed Iliaca Anterior^ almost as large as the Epigastric Ar- tery, arises nearly opposite to it, though frequently a little lower, immediately behind the under end of the Fallopian Ligament. In some rare cases, it comes off in common with the Epigastric, or from the beginning of the Femoral Artery, or from the Profunda Femoris. It runs at the inner edge of the Crest or Spine of the Os Ilium, between the Transversalis and Obliquus In- ternus, till it arrives near the Vertebra? of the Loins.

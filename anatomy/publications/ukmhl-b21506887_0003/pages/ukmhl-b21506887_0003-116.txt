96 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part V. nearly opposite to the under end of the Kidney, it forms a single trunk, which in the right side goes into the Cava alittlebelow the termination of the Emulgent Vein, and in the left into the corresponding Vena Renalis. Besides the Artery commonly called Spermatic, the Testicle generally receives a smaller Branch from the Hypogastric, and frequently also a minute Branch from the Epigastric, which accompany the Vas Defe- rens to the Body of the Testicle, upon which they are dispersed, communicating there with the Branches of the Spermatic Artery. The Veins proper to these Arteries terminate in the Hypogastric and Epigastric Veins. The Spermatic Artery, in a Female, has the same kind of origin, and the same course through the Ab- domen, as in a Male, but is frequently more tor- tuous ; especially during Pregnancy, when it also in- creases in size in proportion to the size of the Uterus. In place of perforating the Abdominal Rings, as it does in a Male, it descends into the Pelvis, between the Lamina of the Ligamentum Latum, to be dispersed first upon the Ovarium and Uterine Tube, and then upon the Fundus of the Uterus itself,â€”passing in at its corner, and communicating with the Artery of the opposite side. The Spermatic Veins have the same termination in a Female as in a Male, but are considerably larger. ARTERIiE ILIACE. The Iliac Arteries consist of the two common Iliacs, which are formed by the division of the Aorta ; and of

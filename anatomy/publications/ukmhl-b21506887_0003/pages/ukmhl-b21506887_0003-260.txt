823 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part VIL of the Wrist and Metacarpus, which have various Anastomoses with others of the Spinal Nerve. It sends off a Branch, which proceeds along the Ul- nar side of the Little Finger ; and at the Heads of the Metacarpal Bones, another, splitting into two Branches, which run along the adjacent sides of the Auricular and Ring Fingers. The Trunk of the Nerve passes with the correspond- ing Artery over the Annular Ligament into the Palm, where, like the Radial Nerve, it is covered with the Aponeurosis Palmaris. In the Palm, it divides into Superficial and Deep ' Branches ; the former destined chiefly for the Fingers, the latter for the Deep Region of the Hand. The Superficial Palmar Nerve sends— Branches to the short Muscles of the Little Finger : A Branch to the Volar-ulnar side of the Little Fin- ger :—and Another, which is soon split into two smaller Branch- es ; one to the Radial side of the Little Finger, the other to the Ulnar side of the Ring Finger. The Deep Palmar Nerve sinks in between the Abduc- tor and Flexor Parvus Minimi Digiti, or perforates the Head of the latter, and forms an Arch, which accom- panies the Deep Arch of the Arteries, under the Ten- dons of the Flexors and the Lumbricales. The Deep Nerve gives— A Branch to the Abductor Minimi Digiti, and one to each of the Interossei: A Twig to each of the Lumbricales, which enters from behind: Branches to the Flexor Brevis and Adductor Pollicis.

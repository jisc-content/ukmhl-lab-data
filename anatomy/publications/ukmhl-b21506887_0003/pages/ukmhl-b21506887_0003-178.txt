One, which is the largest, goes with the Hypogastric, the other with the Spermatic Blood-vessels. The Hypogastric Lymphatics form a Plexus which run from above downwards, into Glands situated on the sides of the Vagina. From these Glands the Lym- phatics pass to others which surround the Internal Iliac Vessels, and then, intermixing with the Trunks from the Extremity, they terminate in the Thoracic Duct. The Spermatic Lymphatics terminate in the Lum- bar Plexus. The Lymphatics of the Uterus, like its Blood-ves- sels, are much enlarged, and of course easily discover- ed, in the gravid state, where they also are observ- ed to be extremely numerous. Absorbents of the Stomach. Of the Absorbents of the Stomach, which consist of superficial and deep Branches, one set runs upon its Small, and another upon its Great Curvature ; but neither the one nor the other is found to carry Chyle, though a few Absorbents have been observed filled with it in other Animals,â€”as a Dog. The first Set, composed of Branches from the upper and under Surfaces of the Stomach, accompanies the Superior Coronary Artery. In their passage, the Lymphatics go through a few small Glands situated at the junction of the Omentum Minus with the Stomach, and, after becoming larger, they enter other Glands in company with the Deep-

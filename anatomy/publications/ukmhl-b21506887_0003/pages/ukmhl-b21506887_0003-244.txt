*12 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part VII. The Lumbar and Sacral Fasciculi, while included in the Dura Mater, form a bundle of Cords, termed Cauda Equina, from the resemblance it has to the tail of a Horse ; especially when the Fibrillae of the Nerves are unravelled by separating them from each other. The Fasciculi perforate the Dura Mater, nearly opposite to where they pass through between the Ver- tebrae,—of course the Nerves of the inferior parts of the Spinal Marrow emerge from the Spine, considera- bly lower than their different origins. Blood-vessels of the Spinal Marrow. The Arteries of the Spinal Marrow consist of Ante- rior and Posterior Spinal Arteries, and of many addi- tional Branches communicating with others from the adjacent Vessels. The Anterior Spinal Arteries arise, one on each side, from the Vertebrals, near where these join to form the Basilar Artery. Upon the beginning of the Spinal Marrow, they ge- nerally unite into a common Trunk, which descends in that depression on the Anterior Surface of the Me- dulla, whereby it is distinguished into two Lateral Portions, and in this course the Artery is covered by the Tunica Arachnoidea. It continues nearly of the same size throughout, in consequence of additions it ■ receives from the neighbouring Arteries. In the Neck it communicates with the Vertebral, Thyroid, and Cervical Arteries, by Branches which pass through the same Holes with the Nerves. In the Back it receives Branches from the Intercos-

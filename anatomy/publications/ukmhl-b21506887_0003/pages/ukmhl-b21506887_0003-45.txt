Part V.] OF THE BLOOD-VESSELS. 25 quently off from the Trunk of the Carotid.—It sends Branches to the Parotid Gland, Digastricus, and Sterno- mastoideus,—a Branch to the Meatus Externus and MembranaTympani,—the Stylo-mastoid Branch, which passes through the Foramen Stylo-mastoideum, giving Twigs to the Meatus Externus, Membrana Tympani, and to different parts of the Internal Ear. The Auricular Artery passes afterwards behind the Ear, gives Branches to the Integuments, Muscles, and Bones there, and, creeping* upon the back part of the Concha, it sends Twigs to it, and terminates upon the side of the Head. The Occipital Artery gives next a Branch, of consi- derable size, which descends between theTrachelo-mas- toideus and Complexus, and afterwards gives Branches to most of the Muscles on this part of the Neck. The Trunk of the Artery afterwards ascends in a serpentine manner upon the Occiput, dividing into se- veral Branches, which are dispersed upon the Integu- ments and Occipito-frontalis, communicating with the Occipital Artery of the opposite side, one Twig passing occasionally through the Foramen Mastoideum to the Dura Mater. Arteria Maxillaris Interna. The Arteria Maxillaris Interna, which has its name in opposition to the Maxillaris Externa, goes off from that part of the Trunk which is covered by the Parotid Gland, and at its Origin lies behind the middle of the upright Plate which divides into the Condyloid and Coronoid Processes of the Lower Jaw.

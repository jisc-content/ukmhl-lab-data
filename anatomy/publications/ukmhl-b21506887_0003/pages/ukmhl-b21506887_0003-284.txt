252 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part VII." The Branches are as follow : The Cutaneus Medius, which descends in the fore part of the Thigh, opposite to the inner edge of the Rectus, and supplies the Integuments near it as far as the Knee, —one Branch of it connecting itself with another of the Cutaneus Anterior. The Cutaneus Anterior, more internal than.the Cu- taneus Medius,—which crosses over the middle of the Sartorius, and, after supplying the adjacent Integu- ments, terminates in the Skin and Cellular Substance, at the fore and inner part of the Knee. The Cutaneus Internus, still more internal than the former, which passes between the Sartorius and Triceps, and, after giving Filaments to the Integuments at the inside of the Thigh, terminates in the Skin, at the un- der and fore part of the Knee. The Deep Branches of the Crural Nerve, which are considerably larger than the Superficial, go to the Pec- tineus and Triceps, to the Sartorius and Gracilis, and to the four Extensors of the Leg, and also furnish Twigs to the Femoral Blood-vessels. The Nervus Saphenus descends between the Sarto- rius and Triceps, and afterwards behind the Tendon of the former, to the inner side of the Tibia. Under the Knee it gives off a Branch, named by Fischer, Saphenus Minor, which goes down a little behind the Saphenus, and, furnishing Filaments to the Integuments of the inner and back part of the Leg, terminates behind the Malleolus Internus, on the Inte- guments of the Foot. The Trunk of the Saphenus attends the Vena Sa- phena Major, sending many Nervous Threads oblique-

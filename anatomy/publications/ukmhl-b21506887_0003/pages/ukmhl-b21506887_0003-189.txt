Part VI J OF THE ABSORBENTS. 163 the Arch of the Aorta to a Gland commonly found be- hind the Origin of the Carotid Arteries. From this Gland it goes afterwards to the general termination in the right side of the Neck. The Lymphatic Trunk accompanying the Left Coro- nary Artery, is formed of two principal Branchesâ€” One of these runs in the Groove between the Ventricles on the Superior Surface of the Heart: the other runs in a similar Groove on the under side of this. Organ, and having reached the space between the Auricle and Ventricle, it turns round to join the former Branch near its corresponding Artery. The Trunk runs next to a Gland placed behind the Pulmonary Artery, and behind the Arch of the Aorta and root of the Trachea, which, with the others here situated, is common to the Absorbents of the Heart and Lungs. This Trunk terminates at length in the upper end of the Thoracic Duct. Thoracic Duct continued. The Thoracic Duct, after receiving numerous Lym- phatics within the Thorax, and having reached as high as the third or fourth Dorsal Vertebra, passes obliquely over to the left side of the Spine, behind the Esopha- gus, and end of the Arch of the Aorta, or beginning of the Aorta Descendens, till it reaches theLeft^Carotid Artery. After this, it emerges from the Thorax, and runs between the Longus Colli and Internal Jugular Vein, to about the Sixth Vertebra of the Neck. l 3

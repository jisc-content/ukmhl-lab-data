Part VII.] OF THE NERVES. 187 From the Ganglion, about a dozen of Filaments a- rise, termed Ciliary Nerves, collected into two portions, which creep along the opposite sides of the Optic Nerve, separated a little from each other, and running in company with the Ciliary Arteries. Besides the Ciliary Nerves from the Ganglion, one, and sometimes two Filaments, arise from the Ramus Nasalis, and pass along with the other Ciliary Branches. The Ciliary Nerves, running with scarcely any divi- sion, reach the back part of the Eye, and, a little be- fore the insertion of the Optic Nerve, enter the Sclero- tic Coat, pass obliquely through it, and, about the middle of the Ball, appear upon the Surface of the Tunica Choroides. Upon this Coat they are flat, and run in a parallel direction, sending very few evident Branches either to it or to each other, till they reach the Ciliary Circle, where they divide into numerous minute Filaments. Upon the Choroides, five or six Branches are larger than the rest; the others are so minute as almost to escape the Naked Eye. At the Ciliary Circle, each commonly divides into two Branches, which are covered by the Cellular Sub- stance of the Circle ; and these, at the root of the Iris, are subdivided into still smaller Branches, which run in a radiated and waving direction ; the Ciliary Vessels being interposed. Near the Pupil, they are united into Arches, from which very minute Twigs run to the interior Margin of the Iris. The Second Branch, or Superior Maxillary Nerve, is larger than the Ophthalmic, and is principally

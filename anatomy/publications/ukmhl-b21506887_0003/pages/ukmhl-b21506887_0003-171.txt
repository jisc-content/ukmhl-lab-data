Part VI.] OF THE ABSORBENTS. 145 contact with the Gland, they split into radiated Branch- es, which, after spreading out upon it, penetrate into its Substance, where they divide almost to infinity, in some parts coiling up upon themselves ; then they re- join/and, communicating freely with each other, pass out at the opposite side of the Gland. The greater part of the Absorbents, approaching a Gland, terminate in it in this manner, while others turn aside to go over it, and end in other Absorbents, or in other Glanis, but at such a distance, that virulent matter may enter the mass of blood without being at first perceived. From the opposite side of the Glands, the Vessels go out nearly in the manner they entered them, and are there termed Vasa Efferentia. These are fre- quently, though by no means always, fewer in num- ber, but larger, than the Vasa Inferentia. Most of the Absorbents go through several Glands, but in some parts through one only, before they reach the general terminations. Few appear to enter the Red Veins without previously having penetrated one or more Glands; but occasionally an Absorbent, as in the Arm, passes through its whole course without perforating any Gland. The Lymph and Chyle are strained through the Glands, by which they are supposed to undergo cer- tain changes,â€”but the nature of these changes has not yet been ascertained, though the Glands are found to be as essential to the Absorbent Vessels as the Gan- glia are to the Nervous System. vol. nr. k

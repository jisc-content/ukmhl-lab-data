Part VII.] OF THE NERVES. 205 and become longer. The different threads unite by de- grees into their respective Trunks,, and while within the Dura Mater, they often have connexions with one or two of the Bundles of the uppermost Spinal Nerves. The Trunk of each Accessory Nerve passes out of the Cranium, in company with the Nerve of the Eighth Pair, but forms no part of that Nerve, being included in its own peculiar Sheath received from the Dura Mater. After perforating the Cranium, it separates from the Eighth, and descends obliquely outwards through the Sterno-mastoideus to the Shoulder. At its exit, it sends off a Branch, termed by some Ramus Minor, (the Trunk itself being then called Ra- mus Major), which assists in forming the Pharyngeal Nerve; and gives another, smaller than the former, to be connected to the Pars Vaga of the Eighth Pair. At the fore part of the Sterno-mastoideus, it is join- ed by an Arch to the Sub-occipital, and frequently by another to the first Cervical Nerve. In its passage through the Sterno-mastoideus, it sends several Branches to the Substance of that Mus* cle, and terminates at length in the Trapezius.

208 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part VII. stance here is firmer in its consistence, than the same Substance is in any part of the Brain, the Annular Protuberance excepted. Upon the Surface of the Spinal Marrow, while lying in its natural situation, many transverse Wrinkles or Folds are observed, which allow it to be extended in the motions of the Vertebrae. It is divided into two lateral Portions or Cords, which are separated from each other externally by an anterior and posterior Fissure continued from the Medulla Ob- longata ; and each of the lateral Portions is in some measure subdivided by a superficial Furrow, into a large anterior and small posterior Cord. The lateral Portions are firmly united together by fine Cellular Substance, but,, without lacerating either, may be separated from each other, before as well as behind, to near their middle, where they are connect- ed by a Layer of Cineritious Matter, which passes from the one Cord into the other. When the Medulla Spinalis is divided transversely, the Cineritious Substance is observed to have a Cruci- form appearance, corresponding with the Cords of which it is composed ; or it represents something of a square form, with its opposite sides bent towards each other, and the angles projecting and curved at their extremities. It is rendered firm by being immersed in Acids, Al- cohol, &c. ; and, when torn in this state, it has a fi- brous appearance. The Body of the Spinal Marrow descends 'in a Child to the Twelfth Dorsal, and in an Adult as far as the Second Lumbar Vertebra, and terminates there by

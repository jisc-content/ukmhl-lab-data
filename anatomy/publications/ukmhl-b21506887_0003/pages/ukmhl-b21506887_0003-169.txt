Part VI.] OF THE ABSORBENTS. 14$ Glands of the Absorbents. Thtf Glands of the Absorbents, or Conglobate Glands, are found solitary or in groups in various parts of the Body, and are situated in the Cellular Substance un- der the Skin, generally near the great Blood-vessels, or over the Trunks of the vessels belonging to the dif- ferent Viscera; but scarcely can be said to be placed in the Substance, or upon the Surface of any of the Viscera. They are chiefly found at the bendings of the Knee and Thigh ; about the Vessels in the Pelvis ; between the plies of the Mesentery, where they are in greater abundance than in any other part of the Body; about the Vessels going into the other Viscera of the Ab- domen ; about the Vessels in both Mediastina, espe- cially the Bronchi; at the inner part of the Arm ; in the Axilla; about the large Vessels of the Neck ; under the Lower Jaw; before and behind the Ear. They have not yet been found upon the Hands or Feet, nor in the Cavity of the Cranium ; and scarcely have any ever been observed upon the Fore-arms or Legs ; and only a small straggling Gland is occasionally met with upon the superficial parts of the Trunk of the Body. This is seen about the size of the Crystalline Lens, sometimes on the back, at other times on the fore side of the Thorax. They are of a round or oval form, and frequently a little flattened ; and of different sizes, from that of a Millet-seed to near an inch in diameter; sometimes several are collected in one Mass.

They are composed of Nervous Fibrillar, inclosed seemingly in Neurilema, and covered by something like a Cineritious Matter, or, according to Scarpa, by a soft Cellular Substance, filled with a greyish and Mu- cilaginous Matter in emaciated Subjects, and with a yellowish oily matter in those that are fat. The Nerves are so divided, multiplied, and inter- mixed in a Ganglion, that each of the Nerves passing out from it, is found to be composed of Fibrillae de- rived from the greater parts of the Nerves which en- ter it. The Longitudinal Section of a perfectly recent Gan- glion, shews the Fibrillar to pass through it, none seeming to terminate entirely in it, or to take their origin directly from it. The section of a Ganglion also shews the Fibrillae to have the same serpentine or zigzag appearance as Nerves have in other parts of the Body. Where Nerves pass out from the side of a Ganglion, they are composed of Fibrillae which come off in con- trary directions; the one set from the beginning, the other from the opposite extremity of the Ganglion. The Nerves which go out from the different Ganglia have the same structure with those which enter them, but are found, with only a few exceptions, as in some parts of the Sympathetic Nerves, to be rather larger. In the Trunk of a Nerve, the Cords appear to run parallel to each other; but when macerated in Water, so as to dissolve the Cellular Substance, or when other-

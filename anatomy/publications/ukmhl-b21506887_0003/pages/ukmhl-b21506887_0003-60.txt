40 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part V. Arteria Posterior Cerebri. The Arteria Posterior, vel Profunda Cerebri, sends Twigs to the Tuber and to the Cms Cerebri, and unites with the Internal Carotid, by the Arteria Communicans. ^ It supplies also parts lying near the third Ventricle, and afterwards turning round the Crus Cerebri, passes backwards between the Cerebrum and Cerebellum. It distributes its numerous Branches chiefly to the Posterior Lobe of the Brain, one Branch in particular penetrating into the Posterior Cornu of the Lateral Ventricle, and, with Branches of the Internal Carotid, forming the Arterious part of the Choroid Plexus. The Branches of this Artery anastomose with those of the anterior part of the Internal Carotid, at the in- side of the Hemisphere,â€”and with those of the lateral part of that Artery, at the outside of the Hemisphere, in the manner these do with one another in the other parts of the Brain ; Arteria Communicans. The Arteria Communicans unites the posterior Cerebral Branch of the Vertebral Artery to the Trunk of the Internal Carotid, and is nearly of the same dia- meter, but longer than the Transverse Artery which connects the anterior Branches of the Internal Carotids, It runs by the sides of the Sella Turcica, sends mi- nute Threads to the Crura Cerebri, to the Corpora Al- bicantia, Optic Nerves, and Infundibulum, and contrj-

148 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Paat VI, The Deep-seated Ly mphatics of the Lower Extremity are situated among the Muscles.—They accompany the Blood-vessels, and are few when compared with the Subcutaneous Set. In several places, one only has been yet observed on each side of the Trunk of the Arteries, though in others they are somewhat more numerous, forming a Plexus over the Blood-vessels. They arise from the sides of the Toes, and from the deep parts of the Sole, accompanying the Plantar Ar- teries ; and, after reaching the Leg, they run up with the Posterior Tibial Artery to the Ham. In the Ham, they lie close upon the Trunk of the Artery, and enter the Popliteal Glands. Besides these, there are similar but smaller Lympha- tics, which begin upon the upper part of the Foot, and afterwards accompany the Anterior Tibial, and the Fibular Arteries, receiving Branches from the deep parts of the fore and outer side of the Leg. The Anterior Tibial and the Fibular Lymphatics, terminate with the Posterior Tibial in the Glands of the Ham. From the Popliteal Glands, two and sometimes more Trunks of considerable size are sent out, which ac- company the Femoral Artery, and, at different dis- tances, communicate with each other, by Branches which pass obliquely across the Artery. At the upper part of the Thigh, they enter the un- dermost of the Inguinal Glands, where the Lymph of the Superficial and deep-seated Absorbents of the Limb is mixed and incorporated. * ■

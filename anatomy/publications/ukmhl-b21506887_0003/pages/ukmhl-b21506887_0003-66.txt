48 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part V. The Lacrimal Branch: The Ethmoidal Branches : Muscular Branches, andâ€”Branches from the Fat in the Orbit, and from the Membranes lining it. The different Branches from the Eye and its Appen- dages form, by their union, the Ocular Vein, which greatly exceeds the size of the corresponding Artery. The Ocular Vein forms large Anastomoses with the Facial Vein, at the inner Corner of the Eye, and after- wards passes back at the inner side of the Orbit. From the inner, it goes across to the outer side of the Orbit, under the Levator Oculi; and, after running backwards through the Superior Orbitar Fissure, co- vered by the Third and Sixth Cerebral Nerves, it ter- minates in the Cavernous Sinus. Veins of the Dura Mater corresponding with its Arteries. The Veins of the Dura Mater accompany their Ar- teries, and run at each side of them. They go partly through the perforations in the Base of the Cranium, and more especially through the Foramina Ovalia of the Sphenoid Bone, to terminate in Branches of the External or Internal Jugular Veins. The rest pass into the nearest Sinuses of the Brain. Veins of the Brain. The smaller Veins of the Brain accompany the Ar- teries. Their Trunks run chiefly between the Circum- volutions of the Brain, at a distance from the Trunks of the Arteries.

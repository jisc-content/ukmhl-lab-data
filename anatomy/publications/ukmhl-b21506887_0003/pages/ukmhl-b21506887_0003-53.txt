Part V.J OF THE BLOOD-VESSELS. SS The Ciliares Breves, vel Posteriores, which are nu- merous, and are formed not only of Branches from the original Ciliary Trunks, but also of Twigs from the Muscular Branches. They perforate the Sclerotica, near the insertion of the Optic Nerve, give Twigs to that Coat, and, dividing into still smaller Branches, creep forwards upon the Tunica Choroides; forming many communications with each other as they ad- vance, and retiring gradually from the convex to the concave surface of this Coat, to supply the Iris and Ci- liary Processes. The Ciliares Longce, which seldom consist of more than two Trunks. They perforate the Sclerotica a little farther forwards than the former, pass along the Choroid Coat to its anterior part, and then each sepa- rates into two Branches, and these into others which inosculate round the outer edge of the Iris. Besides the Ciliares Breves et Longse, there is an- other Set, termed Ciliares Anterior es, which are a few Arterious Filaments from the Muscular Branches, en- tering the Eye where the straight Muscles are inserted. At the root of the Iris, the different Sets of Ciliary Arteries unite into Arches, which form an irregular Circle, called Circulus Iridis. From this Circle, many Arteries run across the Iris in a radiated serpentine manner towards the Pupil, near which several of them also unite into Arches ; and from these^ Twigs are sent, along with the rest of the ra- diated Branches, to the inner edge of the Iris.â€”In a Foetus, they are continued to the Membrana Pu- pillaris.

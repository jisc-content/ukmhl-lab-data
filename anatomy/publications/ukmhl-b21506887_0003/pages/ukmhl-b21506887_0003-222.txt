190 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part VII. tatory^ which passes between the Pterygoidei, to the inner of which it gives off some Filaments. It then sends off from its under side a Ganglion, which trans- mits Nerves to the Inferior Maxillary Gland. The Lingual Nerve also transmits several Branches to the Sublingual Gland, and to the Muscles of the Tongue. It terminates at length upon the upper and fore part of the Tongue, but more particularly upon its point, by many Branches, which belong chiefly to the Papil- lae ; in consequence of which, this Branch is consider- ed as the principal Nerve of the Organ of Taste. The Trunk of the Inferior Maxillary Nerve, having parted with the Lingual Nerve, directs its course be- tween the Pterygoid Muscles to the Posterior Fora- men of the Inferior Maxillary Canal. Before entering the Canal, it sends off a long and slender Branch, which is lodged at first in a Furrow of the Bone, and goes afterwards to be dispersed chiefly upon the Mylo-Hyoideus and Sublingual Gland. The Trunk of the Nerve is afterwards conducted a- long the Canal of the Jaw under the Alveoli, where it distributes Filaments to the different Teeth of the cor- responding side, and to the Substance of the Bone ; and, coming out of the Canal by the Anterior Maxil- lary Foramen, somewhat diminished in size, it scatters its remaining Branches upon the Chin and Under Lip, Sixth Pair. The Sixth Pair, or Abducentes, or External Oculo-muscular, arise from the beginning of the Me-

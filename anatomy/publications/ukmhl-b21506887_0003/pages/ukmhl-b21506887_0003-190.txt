164 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part VI. It now makes a turn downwards, and, after descend- ing nearly an inch, terminates in the upper and back part of the angle formed by the left Internal Jugular and Subclavian Veins. The Thoracic Duct, like the Absorbents which form it, is endowed with Valves, but the number of these varies in different Bodies, there being sometimes only three or four pairs, at other times a considerable num- ber are found in it. Throughout its whole course, it has a waving ap- pearance, and this becomes more conspicuous, in pro- portion as it is distended by Injection. Near the middle of the Thorax, it not unfrequently splits into two or more Branches, and sometimes forms a Plexus, the Branches of which again unite into a common trunk a little higher up. After emerging from the Thorax, it commonly di- vides into two parts, which re-unite previously to the termination of the Duct in the Red Veins, and where there is no division, there is generally a dilatation or Sac at the termination. Sometimes there is one termination in the Angle formed by the Red Veins, and one or two in the Sub- clavian Veins, and now and then, though more seldom, in the Internal Jugular near the Angle. In a few instances it has been found double through its whole length; one Duct going to the common place of termination in the left, and the other to the corre- ponding part in the right side of the Neck. It has also, in a few very rare instances, been ob- served to terminate in the Veins in the right side of the

888 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part IX. Cellular Substance, which in former times was consider- ed here as part of the Tunica Propria Musculorum. Then shew the Digitations of this Muscle, and their intermixing with those of the Serratus Magnus. Dissect the Ring of the External Oblique Muscle, and the Passage through it ; the top of the Spermatic Cord in a Male, or the insertion of the Round Liga- ment of the U terus in a Female. Cut the External Oblique Muscle within an inch of its origins, except at the Crural Arch, where the Ten- don of the Muscle ought to be divided some way above the external Abdominal Ring. After cutting the Mus- cle, raise and turn it forwards as far as the Linea Se- milunaris. Clean next the surface of the Internal Oblique Mus- cle, and turn it also forwards from its origins, till where its Tendon joins that of the External Oblique. Dissect also the Surface of the Transversalis, leaving the Muscle itself entire, excepting where a small cut ought to be made into it, to expose a part of the Peri- toneum i. Replace the two Oblique Muscles, then cut the edge of the Linea Alba through its whole length, and turn back the anterior part of the Sheath of the Rectus, which requires attention, on account of the adhesions of the Lineae Transversales.â€”Vol. I. p. 221. Raise the Rectus, to shew the posterior Layer of the Sheath, the under end of the Tendon of the Trans- versalis, and the surface of the Peritoneum, at the lower part of the Abdomen.

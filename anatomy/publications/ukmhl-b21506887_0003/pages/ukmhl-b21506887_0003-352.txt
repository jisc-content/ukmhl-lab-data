In raising the Integuments, guard against dividing the Occipito-frontalis, which forms a close connexion with the Skin. After exposing the whole of this Mus- cle, introduce a probe under it, before and behind, to shew the thickness, or rather thinness, of its fleshy Sub- stance—See Vol. I. p. 181. Tab. V. VIII. Right Side.—Dissect the Attollens Aurem, and shew at its sides a portion of the Aponeurosis of the Tempo- ral Muscle ; shew also the anterior and posterior Auris. —•See Vol. I. p. 184. Tab. V. VIII. Left Side.—Dissect, then turn down, the Attollens Aurem, to expose the whole surface of the Aponeurosis Temporalis.—See Vol. I. p. 184. Turn down next, the Aponeurosis, and observe part of the Temporal Muscle taking its origin from the inner side of it. Examine the surface of the Temporal Muscle,—Vol. I. p. 184,—and trace its course under the Zygoma, where a probe can be pushed down, shewing the course which purulent Matter has sometimes taken into the Substance of the Cheek. Cut the Tendon of the Occipito-frontalis across, and bring it forwards, to exhibit the Pericranium. Raise part of the Pericranium, to shew its connexion with the surface of the Bones. Raise the insertion of the Occi- pito-frontalis, and expose the Corrugator Supercilii. —Vol. I. p. 182. Tab. V. Fig. 2. Cut a piece of the Integuments, a few inches square, from the Crown of the Head, from the Nates, and from

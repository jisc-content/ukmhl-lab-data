\ Part VII.] OF THE NERVES. 185 From the opposite and curved edge of the Ganglion three large Branches come out; the first and anterior, termed Ophthalmic,—the second and middle, the Supe- rior Maxillary,—and the third and posterior, the Infe- rior Maxillary. The First Branch of the Fifth Pair, at the side of the Sella Turcica, is situated lower than the Third Pair, and afterwards crosses over it, being previously connected by Nervous Matter to the Trunk of the Fourth Pair. It goes through the Foramen Lacerum into the Orbit, and is there divided into the following Branches, viz. The Supra-Orbitar, which is the largest of the whole, being a continuation of the Ophthalmic. It passes immediately under the Membrane which lines the upper part of the Orbit, and splits into two Branches of unequal size. The smaller Branch, termed Supra-Trochlearis, runs under the Superciliary Ridge to the Upper Eye-lid and Fore-head. The larger passes through the Foramen Supra-Orbi- tarium,—or over the Superciliary Ridge when the Fora- men is wanting,—sends Branches to the Upper Eye-lid, and divides into several others, which run back, partly above, but chiefly under the Frontalis, to supply the fore and upper part of the Head in general, while mi- nute Fibres appear to penetrate the Bones: The Nasal Branch, which runs obliquely over the Optic Nerve, where it detaches a Filament or two to the Eye, then under the Levatores Palpebral et Oculi; and, getting between the Abductor Oculi and Troch- lears, passes to the inside of the Orbit.

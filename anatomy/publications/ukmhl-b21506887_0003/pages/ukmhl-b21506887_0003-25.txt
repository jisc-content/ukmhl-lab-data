Part V.j OF THE BLOOD-VESSELS. 5 diastinum, they are surrounded by a Membrane com- mon to them and to the neighbouring Viscera. In other parts of the Body, especially in young Sub- jects, they are surrounded with so much Cellular Sub- f stance, as to give them the appearance of being inclos- ed in Sheaths. This appears very evident about the Abdominal Aorta, and the great Arteries of the Arm, Thigh, &c. The first of the proper Coats is the External Mem- branous, or Cellular, called also by some Authors the Nervous Coat. It is the strongest of the Coats of the Arteries, but the thickness varies considerably in dif- ferent parts of the Body. It is composed of minute Threads, which internally are condensed into a firm. Substance, that accompanies their Arteries to their ter- minations. In the large Arteries, this Coat is frequently furnish^ ed with Fat, and is of a very elastic nature. Owing to this elasticity, the Arteries, in receiving the Blood from the Heart, become dilated and elongated, and start from their place, and this forms the Pulse, called also the Diastole of the Arteries. That the Dilatation of the Arteries is the cause of the Pulse, is readily proved by fixing a flexible Tube, as the Gut of a Cat, or the Trunk of an Artery, to the Artery of a living Animal, in such a manner as to transfuse the Blood from the latter into the former. In this case, the inanimate Substance acquires a Pulsatory motion. The Second is the Middle, or Muscular, which is the thickest of the Coats. It is composed of Fibres run- ning in a transverse direction,â€”of a red colour in the

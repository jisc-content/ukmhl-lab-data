284 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part IX, to be examined out of the Cranium, otherwise the Body may remain in the same situation. If the Brain is to be removed, the Cerebrum, Cere- bellum, Tuber Annulare, and Medulla Oblongata, are to be taken out in one piece, after dividing the Blood- vessels and Nerves ; beginning the division of these at the fore part of the Head. Cut the Internal Carotid Arteries, Infundibulum, and Nerves, close to the Skull, to allow these to be pro- perly examined. Divide the Vertebral Arteries, and the Medulla Oblongata, as deep in the Spinal Canal as the Scalpel can reach. After removing the Brain from the Head, examine the nature of the Dura Mater, and the different Pro- cesses into which it is divided.—Vol. II. p. 19.—At- tend next to the four large Sinuses of this Membrane, and slit them open, to shew their size, situation, and Course.-^VoL II. p. 22. Take next a view of the different parts on the outer Surface of the Brain, and of the two inner Membranes which cover it.—Vol. II. p. 23. Previously to cutting into the Brain, it may be pro- per to examine the parts seen on its under Surface, the general course of the Trunks of the Arteries, and origin of the Cerebral Nerves.—See Vol. II. p. 40. After becoming acquainted with the under part of the Brain, lay it on its Base to shew its upper Surface, and trace its different parts, as described Vol. II. p. 24. &c. Having examined the Hemispheres, Lobes, and Cir- cumvolutions of the Brain, separate the two Hemj-

176 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Fart VII. sels and Fibres of Cellular Substance straitening the Nerves. ^ Dr Monro considered them as Folds or Joints, al- lowing the Nerves to accommodate themselves to the various states of flexion or extension. The Nerves are supplied with Arteries from the neighbouring Blood-vessels, to which they return cor- responding Veins. The Arteries, however, are small, and are injected with difficulty, excepting in the large Nerves, where they are more considerable, and where, after a minute Injection, the Nerve receives the colour of the Matter injected. When the Arteries are now examined, they are ob- served to run into the Nerves at different places, then to go parallel to the Funiculi, and at last to penetrate the Filaments themselves. The Nerves have also their Absorbents; these are, however, but occasionally seen, and then only on the largest Trunks. Upon dividing the Nerves, they are not found to possess much contractility ; while the Arteries^ upon being cut, are observed to retract very considerably. The Trunks of the Nerves are generally lodged in the common Cellular Substance and Fat, and in the Interstices of the Viscera and Muscles, where they are protected from compression ; though in several parts they are exposed to the hardness of Bones, or to the action of Muscles, over or through which they pass. In their course through the Body, they generally run as straight as is consistent with the nature of the particular part over which they go, and with their own safety.

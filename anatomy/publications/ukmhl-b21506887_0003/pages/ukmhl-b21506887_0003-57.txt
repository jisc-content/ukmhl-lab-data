Part V.] OF THE BLOOD-VESSELS. 37 Vertebral Artery. The two Vertebral Arteries,—which are only a little smaller than the Internal Carotids,—arise from the Subclavian Arteries at the bottom of the Neck. Each of them, at a small distance from its Origin, enters the Canal formed for its reception by the six uppermost Cervical Vertebra?, though in some rare instances it is seen entering the Seventh Vertebra, or sometimes only perforating two or three of the upper- most of these. It ascends through the Neck, nearly in a straight di- rection, sending Twigs outwards between the Vertebrae to the deep Muscles of the Neck, and others which pass inwards by the Holes that transmit the Spinal Nerves, to the Spinal Marrow and its Membranes; communicating with the Spinal Arteries. Immediately below the Head, it gives out more con- siderable Branches to the Deep Muscles at the back part of the Neck, particularly to the Recti and Obliqui Capitis, the Trachelo-mastoideus and Complexus ; in- osculating with Branches of the Occipital Artery. In passing from the Third to the Second Vertebra, one turn is formed upwards and outwards; and in going between the Vertebra Dentata and Atlas, ano- ther outwards and forwards. After perforating the Atlas, it bends suddenly back- wards, and runs in a horizontal direction in a Notch upon that Bone. Having reached the lateral partof the Foramen Mag-,

24 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part V. which are dispersed upon the Pharynx, Fauces, and Base of the Skull, where some of them enter the large Foramina, and supply part of the Dura Mater.â€”From this Artery, Twigs are also sent to the Sterno-mastoi- deus, Nerves, and Conglobate Glands. Arteria Occipitalis. The Arteria Occipitalis arises from the back part of the External Carotid, and at its Origin is con- cealed by the other original Branches sent off from that Artery. It runs over the beginning of the Internal Jugular Vein, which is exterior to the Carotis Interna. It after- wards passes between the Atlas and Mastoid Process, and is covered by the posterior Belly of the Digastri- cus. It goes likewise behind the upper ends of the Tra- chelo-mastoideus, Splenitis, and Complexus; after which it becomes more superficial, where it runs near the middle of the Occiput. In its course it is very tortuous, and gives off diffe- rent Branches to the surrounding Muscles, viz. Branches to the Digastricus, Stylo-hyoideus, Sterno- mastoideus, and Glands of the Neck, and communicates with Branches of the Cervical Arteries : A Branch, which passes, with the Jugular Vein, and goes to the under and back part of the Dura Mater: A small Auricular Branch, which is sometimes from the posterior Auricular, and is distributed on the Lobe and outer edge of the Ear : The Auricularis Posterior, which comes fre-

Part VII.] OF THE NERVES. 217 the First Cervical, forms an Arch with the Descen ens of the Ninth Pair. It gives off a Small Root, which is united with others in the formation of the Diaphragmatic Nerve. A Large Branch comes out from it behind the Ster- no-mastoideus, which, turning over this Muscle, sends off the following Nerves, viz. The Inferior Cutaneous Nerve of the Neck, which passes forwards to the parts under the Lower Jaw : * The Middle Cutaneous Nerve, which runs towards the Angle of the Jaw : The Great Posterior Articulating' Nerve, which fur- nishes an anterior Branch to the under part of the Ear, and a posterior Branch, dividing into many others which go to the back part of the Ear and Temple. The Cutaneous and Articular Nerves are dispersed upon the Platysma Myoides, Integuments of the side of the Neck and Head, the Parotid Gland, and Exter- nal Ear; and have several communications with the Portio Dura of the Seventh Pair. The remainder of the Second Cervical is distributed upon the Levator Scapulae, and the Extensors of the Neck and Head. Third Cervical Nerve. The Third Cervical Nerve, after emerging from between the Vertebras, sends down a Branch to the Trunk of the Fourth Cervical, and another Branch, which forms the principal root of the Diaphragmatic Nerve. A Third Branch perforates the Muscles on the side

208 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part VII. SPINAL MARROW, AND ORIGIN OF THE SPINAL NERVES. Spinal Marrow. The SriNAL, or Vertebral Marrow, by some termed Spinal Cord, is the continuation of the Me- dulla Oblongata, and has the same structure and gene- ral appearance with it. It begins directly behind the origin of the Ninth Pair of Nerves, and obtains its name from being contained in the Osseous Canal of the Spine. Its weight is from a twentieth to a twenty- fifth of that of the Brain. In the Neck, where it sends off the Nerves of the Superior Extremity, it is about half an inch in diame- ter from one side to the other, and somewhat less from before backwards ; in the Back it is a little narrower, and is more of a cylindrical form; in the Loins, where the Great Nerves of the Inferior Extremity are given off, it widens out a little, though not so much as in the Neck, and then gradually tapers to a point below. It is invested by the same Membranes which cover the Brain, and has an additional partial Involucrum from the Ligamentous Membrane which lines the Bo- dies of the Vertebrae, and which has been already ta- ken notice of in the description of the Ligaments.

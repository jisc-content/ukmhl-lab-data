Part VI.] OF THE ABSORBENTS. 165 Neck, while a short Trunk, similar to that commonly found there, has terminated in the left. Absorbents of the Superior Extremity. The Superior, in a similar manner with the Inferior Extremity, has two sets of Lymphatics, one lying im- mediately under the Integuments, and belonging to the Skin and Cellular Substance under it, the other accompanying the principal Blood-vessels, and belong- ing to the deep-seated parts. The Superficial Lymphatics of the Superior Extre- mity are numerous, and are readily seen in emaciated Dropsical Subjects. They arise from the fore and back parts of the Fin- gers and Hand, by a considerable number of Branches, and form an extensive Plexus, upon the corresponding sides of the Fore-arm. Those upon the anterior part of the Fore-arm run directly upwards to the Arm, while the Lymphatics on its back part separate into two Sets, one of which passes obliquely over the Muscles on the Radius, and the other over those on the Ulna, to join the Lympha- tics on the anterior part of the Fore-arm. The Lymphatics of the Fore-arm run over the bend- ing of the Elbow, and afterwards ascend upon the fore and inner part of the Arm; the greater number of them running near the Basilic Vein. Some of them frequently pass through small Glands placed along the Humeral Artery, one of which is com- monly found a little above the inner Condyle of the Os Humeri, the rest somewhat higher ; other Lymphatics

270 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part VIII. Vessels and Nerves of Glands. The Arteries of Glands are larger, and more nume- rous, than in any other part of the Body. They are derived from those of the adjacent parts, and have their size proportioned to the quantity of Fluids they are destined to secrete;â€”examples of which are seen in the Kidneys, Testicles, &c. The Surculi, or Branches of Arteries in Glands, are innumerable. They are formed into Racemi and Pe- dunculi, as may be seen after Maceration for some time in Water. The Veins of Glands are destitute of Valves, except- ing those from the Testicle, and sometimes also those from the Mamma. They are fewer in number, but many of them are larger and more lax than in other parts, and may be either larger or smaller than the corresponding Arteries. The communications between the Arteries and Veins are more remarkable in some Glands than in others. Thus, in the Kidney, an Injection passes with greater facility from the Artery to the Vein than it does in the Brain. The Absorbents are generally very numerous, and di- vided into a Superficial and a Deep Set. They are plentifully supplied with Valves, and have many anas- tomoses with each other, both in the Substance and on the Surface of the Gland. The Nerves of Glands are rather numerous than large; like the Arteries, they generally go in at a par- ticular part of the Gland. They accompany the Blood-

Part VII. J OF THE NERVES. 209 a Conical point, which is concealed by Fasciculi of Nerves. Spinal Nerves. Each of the lateral Portions of the Spinal Marrow sends off from its anterior and posterior parts, a little to the outside of the middle Fissure, flat Fasciculi of Nervous Filaments, in regular succession, which are placed opposite to their fellows on the other side. Several of the Fasciculi of the Cervical Nerves de- tach Filaments to those immediately above or below them; and the same thing is occasionally observed of some of the bundles of Dorsal Nerves. The anterior and posterior Fasciculi converge, each into one bundle, and the two bundles perforate the Dura Mater very near each other, a small portion of this Membrane only being between them. From the inner part of the Dura Mater, each Fasci- culus is furnished with a proper Sheath, which is con- tinued along it, and the Sheaths are connected by Cel- lular Substance only, till they get between the Verte- brae. Between the anterior and posterior Fasciculi of Spinal Nerves, and between the Tunica Arachnoidea and Pia Mater, a slender Cord, termed Ligamentum Denticida- tum, is situated, which is attached to the Dura Mater, where that Membrane comes out from the Cranium, and accompanies the Spinal Marrow to its inferior ex- tremity. It has a whitish, semi-transparent, and tendinous appearance, and adheres by Cellular Substance to the VOL. III. o

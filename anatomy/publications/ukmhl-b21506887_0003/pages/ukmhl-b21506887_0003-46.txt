26 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part V. It passes first between the Jaw andPterygoideus Ex- ternum and afterwards ascends, in a tortuous manner, towards the back part of the Antrum Maxillare, send- ing numerous Branches to the parts belonging to the Jaws. At its Origin, it furnishes Twigs to the fore-side and adjacent part of the Outer Ear, and to the Articulation of the Lower Jaw* It then sends off the Arteria Durce Matris Media Maxima, vel Meningea Media, vel Spheno-spinalis> which runs between the External and Internal Carotids, passes through the Foramen Spinale of the Sphenoid Bone, and spreads, like the Branching of a Tree, over the Surface of the Dura Mater and inside of the Parietal and Temporal Bones. Before entering the Foramen Spinale, it sometimes gives Twigs to the Muscles and other parts near it. A minute Branch runs along the Inferior Maxillary Nerve to the Dura Mater; and within the Cranium, besides the Branches mentioned above, it furnishes Twigs to the Substance of the Bones, and to the inner Ear: The Iriferior Maxillary Branch, which runs in the Inferior Maxillary Canal, sending Branches to the Sub- stance of the Bone, and to the Teeth ; the remainder of it passing out at the Anterior Maxillary Foramen, is dispersed upon the Under Lip, communicating upon the Chin, with Branches of the Facial Artery. Branches to the Pterygoideus, Masseter, and inner part of the Temporalis, under the names of Arteria? Pterygoidew, Masseterica?, and Temporales Profunda? t

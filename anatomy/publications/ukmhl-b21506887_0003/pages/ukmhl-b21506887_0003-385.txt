Part IX.] RULES FOR DISSECTION. 315 On the Left Side, cut the Dura Mater near to, and parallel with, the Superior Longitudinal Sinus. On the Right Side, divide the Membrane where the Cra- nium has been sawed. Turn the Subject on its Breast, and cut the Tento- rium at its root on both sides of the Heapl. The Body ought again to be turned, to allow the Falx to be se- parated from the Crista Galli and reflected, and the Brain and its Appendages to be removed in one piece. For this purpose, divide the Trunks of the different Blood-vessels and Nerves, and top of the Spinal Mar- row. In doing so, attend to the passage of the Arteries through the Cranium to the Brain, and of the Nerves from the Brain, through the Foramina of the Cranium. Cut the Carotids half way between the origin of the Ocular Artery and Circle of Willis, and divide the under end of the Infundibulum. Cut the Nerves close to the Brain on the Left Side, and half way between the Brain and Skull on the Right. Leave as much as possible of the Left Accessory Nerve in the Cranium. Separate the Right one, along with the Medulla Oblongata, and cut the Vertebral Arteries close to the side of the Foramen Magnum. After removing the Brain, invert it, and dissect off the Tunica Arachnoidea, to shew the Circle of Wil- lis, and the origin of the different Nerves. Follow the Branches of the Carotid Arteries, and also those of the Vertebrals, and trace them to their terminations.â€”Vol. III. p. 34. Cut open the different Sinuses described in Vol. III. p. 47, &c. and examine their situation, size, and ter- minations.

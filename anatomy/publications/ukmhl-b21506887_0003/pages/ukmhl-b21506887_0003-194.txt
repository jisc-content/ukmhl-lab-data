168 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part VI. Some of them pass through Glands situated upon the outside of the Buccinator, while the principal Trunks go through a number of large Glands placed upon the outer, and also at the under part of the Lower Jaw,—at the anterior edge of the Masseter, and about the Inferior Maxillary Salivary Gland. The Lymphatics from the inner part of the Nose run principally with the Internal Maxillary Artery, and pass through Glands situated behind the Angle of the Lower Jaw, where they are joined by those which be- long to the inner parts of the Mouth. The Lymphatics of the Tongue, and likewise of the Muscles and other parts upon the Os Hyoides, enter the Glands placed behind the Angle of the Lower Jaw. Lymphatics have been frequently searched for in the Brain, but their existence in that Organ is not yet fully ascertained; though rendered highly probable, from Lymphatics and Glands being occasionally found in, or immediately on the outside of the Passages of the Blood-vessels of the Brain,—from Swellings in the Lymphatic Glands of the Neck following Diseases of the Brain,—from the Absorption of Water, which has sometimes happened in Hydrocephalous Cases,—from an appearance of Lymphatics having been by some, as Mascagni, observed upon the Surface of the Dura Mater, and between the Tunica Arachnoidea and Pia Mater, and—from their having been found on the Brains of Fishes. From the Superficial and Deep Parts of the Head in general, the Lymphatics accompany the External and Internal Jugular Veins, and the Carotid Arteries; re-

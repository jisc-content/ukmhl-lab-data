Part V.] OP THE BLOOD-VESSELS. 29 Anterior Auricular Branches, which come off near the Origin of the former Branch, and are ramified up- on the fore part of the Ear, inosculating there with the Posterior Auricular Artery* Branches to the Masseter, which communicate in the Cheek with the Facial and Internal Maxillary Arteries. The Temporal Artery having detached the Branches mentioned above, forms one or two sharp turns before the Ear ; and a little above the root of the Zygoma, where the Pulsation of the Artery can be felt, and fre- quently even seen, it divides into two large Branches, an Anterior and Posterior, which are placed superfi- cially between the Integuments of the Head and Apo- neurosis of the Temporal Muscle. The Anterior, External Anterior, or Temporo-Jrontal Branch, advances in a serpentine direction, spreading out its Ramifications upon the side and upper part of the Forehead, some of which reach as far as the Or- bit. It supplies the Integuments and Muscles near it, communicates, about the Orbit, with the Facial Ar- tery, and, at the upper part of the Head, with the cor- responding Branch of the other side. It occasionally gives a Branch from near its root, termed Ramus Orbicularis, which runs towards the outer Corner of the Eye, to be distributed upon the Orbicularis. The Posterior, or External Posterior, or Temporo- occipital Branch, appears as the continuation of the Trunk. It ascends obliquely backwards, and is distri- buted extensively on the Integuments and Muscles upon the lateral part and Crown of the Head, communicat-

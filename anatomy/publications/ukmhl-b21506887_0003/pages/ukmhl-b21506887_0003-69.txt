Part V.] OF THE BLOOD-VESSELS. 49 the Partes Petrosae.—They receive the Blood from the Cavernous, and discharge it into the ends of the Late- ral Sinuses* Besides the Sinuses mentioned above, the following also are frequently found, viz. A Perpendicular Occipital Sinus, situated in the Falx Cerebelli, which is sometimes single, at other times double, and terminates in the Lateral Sinuses.—It re- ceives Veins from the Dura Mater, and communicates with the Vertebral Veins. An Anterior Superior, and Anterior Inferior Occi- pital Sinus, placed over the Cuneiform Process of the Occipital Bone, and communicating with the Inferior Petrosal and Lateral Sinuses, and with the Vertebral Veins. Internal Jugular Vein. The Lateral Sinuses, having received the Blood sent to the Brain from the Carotid and Vertebral Arteries, pass out of the Cranium, and form the Internal Jugular Veins, each of which, at its Origin, is bulged back in form of a Varix, which is termed Diverticulum ; and this is lodged in the Jugular Fossa at the root of the Pars Petrosa of the Temporal Bone. The Internal Jugular Vein descends behind the Sterno-mastoideus, upon the fore and outer part of the Common Carotid Artery, with which it is included in a Sheath of Cellular Substance; and is frequently a good deal dilated towards its under extremity, espe- cially in persons advanced in life. In its course in the Neck, it receives, either by se- vol. in. d

\ PaktVIL] OF THE NERVES. 199 The Pharyngeus, chiefly formed by the Pars Vaga, but partly also by a Branch from the Accessorius, is afterwards joined by Branches from the Glosso-pharyn- geus, and descends obliquely over the Internal Carotid Artery. Near the origin of this Artery, it sends Filaments which join others from the upper part of the Great Sympathetic, and creep along the common Carotid. Upon the middle of the Pharynx, it expands into a Gangliform Plexus, from which many small Branches are sent out, to be distributed upon the three Constric- tors of the corresponding side of the Pharynx ; one or two Filaments uniting above with the Glosso-Pharyn. geus, and others below with the Laryngeus Superior. The Laryngeus Superior descends obliquely for- wards between the Carotid Arteries and Pharynx, and, behind the origin of the Carotids, is divided into a large Internal or Superior, and a small External or Inferior Branch. The Internal Branch passes forwards between the Os Hyoides and Superior Cornu of the Thyroid Car- tilage. It divides into numerous Branches, some of which go to the Arytenoid Gland, and to the Arytenoidei Obliquus et Transversus, and others to the Glandular Membrane of the Epiglottis ; while the greater number and the largest of these Branches are dispersed upon the Glandular Membrane lining the upper portion of the Larynx and parts adjacent. The External Branch,—which Scarpa considers as more properly termed Pharyngo-laryngeus,—is origi- nally composed of a Branch from the Internal Laryngeal,

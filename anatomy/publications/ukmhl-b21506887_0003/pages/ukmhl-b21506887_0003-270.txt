238 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part VII. these,—Branches arise, which descend obliquely upon the sides of the Vertebrae, and unite into a Trunk term- ed Nervus Splanchnicus, which perforates the Appen- dix of the Diaphragm, and goes to the Viscera of the Abdomen; from which circumstance the Nerve obtains its name. Besides the Nervus Splanchnicus, another, termed Splanchnicus Seczmdarius, vel Accessorius, is generally observed, arising from one or two of the Dorsal Gan- glia, below the Origin of the Splanchnicus, which it joins near its termination,—or runs separate from it in- to the Abdomen. Nervi Intercostales. The Intercostal, or Costal, or Dorsal Nerves, after escaping from the Vertebrae, run in the Furrows at the lower edges of the Ribs, in company with the Intercostal Blood-vessels, and proceed to the anterior part of the Thorax, between the two Layers of the In- tercostal Muscles. Immediately after getting out from between the Ver- tebrae, each is connected, as already taken notice of, by short Branches to the Sympathetic Nerve. Opposite to this connexion, they give principal Branches backwards to the Muscles lying near the Spine, and serving for the erection of the Trunk of the Body. Through the rest of their course, they send off Branches to the Intercostales, to the other Muscles, and to the Integuments of the Thorax, and also to those of

194 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part VIL The Fasciculus, which belongs to the Vestibule and Semicircular Canals, forms at first a Plexus, then a Gangliform Enlargement, previously to its entrance in- to the Labyrinth. The Nerves which belong to the Vestibule and Semi- circular Canals, pass through the Macula Cribrosa, or Holes subdivided into smaller Holes by Cribriform Plates in the bottom of the Meatus Auditorius Inter- nus. Of these Branches, small Filaments pass through the Macula Cribrosa in the Inferior Fossula of the Meatus Auditorius Internus, to the Alveus Communis, vel Sac- cuius Vestibuli. A small Branch goes through another Cribriform Hole in the Inferior Fossula, to the Ampulla of the Posterior Membranaceous Semicircular Canal. A Branch, larger than any of the former, enters the posterior Holes in the upper Fossula of the Meatus In- ternus, to be dispersed upon the Ampullae of the Supe- rior and Exterior Membranaceous Canals. The Nerves, after reaching the Sacculus Vestibuli and the different Ampullae, are spread out upon them, as in the Cochlea, in the form of a Net-work; the Fibres of which, by degrees becoming semi-pellucid, disappear upon the beginning of the Membranaceous Canals. Portio Dura, Communicans Faciei, vel Nervus Facialis.â€”The Portio Dura, or Facial Nerve, sepa- rates from the Portio Mollis at the bottom of the Mea- tus Auditorius Internus, and, by the Anterior Hole in the upper Fossula at the bottom of the Meatus, enters the Aquceductus Fallopii.

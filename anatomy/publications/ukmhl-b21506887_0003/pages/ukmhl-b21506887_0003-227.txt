Part VII.] OF THE NERVES. 195 After getting into the Canal, it receives the retro- grade Nerve from the Second Branch of the Fifth Pair, which enters by the Foramen Innominatum on the fore side of the Pars Petrosa. It sends Twigs through Foramina in the sides of the Aqueduct, to the Mastoid Cells and to the Stapedius. A little before its exit from the Aqueduct in an A- dult, but at the outer end of it in a Foetus, it gives off a reflected Branch, termed Chorda Tympani, which passes between the long Processes of the Malleus and Incus, and over the Membrana Tympani. The Chorda Tympani goes afterwards in a Fissure at the outside of the Eustachian Tube, and soon after it has got out of the Cranium, it joins the Lingual Branch of the Fifth Pair. In its passage, it supplies the Muscles of the Mal- leus, and the Membranes, &c. of the Tympanum. The Portio Dura afterwards passes out of the Aque- duct by the Foramen Stylo-mastoideum, and is at first lodged deep, being situated in a hollow behind the Pa- rotid Gland. Here it gives a small Occipital Branch, which sends Twigs to the back part of the Ear, and terminates in the Oblique Muscles of the Head. It sends a Branch to the Digastricus, and another to the Stylo-hyoideus ; gives off <a Filament which joins the Auricular Branch of the Inferior Maxillary Nerve, and goes to the fore part of the Ear ; and is connected by another small Filament at the under part of the Ear, with Branches of the Sympathetic Nerve which run a- long the External Carotid Artery. It also furnishes Filaments to the Parotid Gland, N 2 *

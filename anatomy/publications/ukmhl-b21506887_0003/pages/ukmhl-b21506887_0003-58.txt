88 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part V. num Occipitis, it turns upwards, perforates the Dura Mater, and enters the Cavity of the Cranium. After entering the Cranium, it passes, with the Me- dulla Oblongata, upon the Cuneiform Process of the Occipital Bone, inclining towards its fellow on the other, side ; and at the beginning of the Medulla, the two Vertebrals unite into the Trunk called Basilar Artery. Upon entering the Skull, each Vertebral Artery sends a small Branch, termed Arteria Meningea Poste- rior, to the back part of the Dura Mater, which com- municates by small Ramifications with the neighbour- ing Arteries of this Membrane. It then disperses Twigs to the Medulla Oblongata, and frequently gives off the small Branch which forms one of the Posterior Arteries of the Spinal Marrow. Near the part where it unites with its fellow, it sends down the Anterior Artery of the Spinal Marrow, which, with the Posterior Arteries of this Substance, will be afterwards described. AitTEitiA Posterior Cerebelli. From the Vertebral, or from the Basilar, or some- times from each, a principal Branch is sent oiF, named Arteria Cerebelli Posterior vel Inferior, which passes between the Cerebellum and Medulla Oblongata, and furnishes Branches to the under part of the Cerebel- lum, to the back part of the Medulla Oblongata and Tuber Annulare, and forms the Choroid Plexus of the fourth Ventricle,

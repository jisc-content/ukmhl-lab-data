Pakt VII.] OF THE NEBVES. 211 As soon as the Spinal Nerves emerge from between the Vertebrae, each sends Branches backwards to the Muscles near the Spine, and others forwards to join the Great Sympathetic Nerve; while the Trunk is conti- nued outwards to its place of destination. The Spinal Nerves are distinguished on each side by numbers, according to the Bones under which they pass : Thirty Pair are most commonly enumerated ;— one going under the Head, and termed Sub-occlpltal; —seven passing under the Cervical,—twelve under the Dorsal,—and five under the Lumbar Vertebrae,—and five under the pieces which originally composed the Os Sacrum. The Fasciculi which form the Cervical Nerves are short, running nearly in a straight direction outwards from their origin to the Intervertebral Holes, or in- clining downwards only in a small degree. Those which form the Dorsal Nerves are longer than the former, and run more obliquely downwards, and those which form the Lumbar and Sacral Nerves go still more obliquely downwards, and the inclination gradu- ally increases among the Spinal Nerves, till at length the undermost of them become nearly longitudinal. The size of the Fasciculi corresponds with that of the Trunks of the Nerves which they form.—The Fasciculi of the four lowest Cervical and first Dorsal are large and broad, giving origin to the Great Nerves which supply the Superior Extremity.—Those of the Back are much more slender, while the Fasciculi of the Loins and the three upper Sacral ones are of great size, to form the very large Nerves which run to the Lower Extremity. o 2

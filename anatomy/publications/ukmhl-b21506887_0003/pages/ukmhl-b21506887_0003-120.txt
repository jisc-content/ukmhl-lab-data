100 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part V. versalis Perinei, in the space between the Crus Penis and Bulb of the Urethra, and gives Branches to the Skin, Muscles, and Fat, at the fore part of the Anus, and root of the Penis, and to the Scrotum ; while the Artery itself terminates on the under part of the Penis. One of these Branches, termed Transversa Perinei, is necessarily divided, along with the Muscle of that name, in the lateral operation of Lithotomy. After dispersing the Branches already mentioned, the Pudic Artery divides, at the root of the Penis, into three Principal Branches, viz. The First Branch, which is the smallest of the three. It passes into the Bulb of the Urethra, and is continued forwards in the Corpus Spongiosum Urethrae, into the Cells of which many of its Branches open : The Second Branch, termed Profunda Penis, vel Arteria Cavernosa, which goes into the Crus Penis of the corresponding side, and directs its course in the Axis of the Corpus Cavernosum, through which it passes, in nearly a straight line, to the other extremity of that Body ; its Branches communicating, through the medium of the Septum, with the Artery of the op- posite side, and by innumerable Branches with the Cells of the Penis : The Third Branch, called Dorsalis Penis, which turns between the Symphysis Pubis and root of the Penis, and proceeds along the Dorsum as far as the Glans, adhering closely to the Ligamentous Substance which incloses the Corpora Cavernosa, and sending Branches to it and to the Integuments. In some very rare cases, the Pudic Artery, instead of passing between the- Sacro-ischiatic Ligaments, has

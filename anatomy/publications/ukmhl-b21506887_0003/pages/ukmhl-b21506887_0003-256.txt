224 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part VII. diales and Supinator Longus, and then descends at the inner edge of the Supinator along with the Radial Ar- tery. A little below the middle of the Radius, it crosses between the Tendons of the Supinator and Extensores Radiales, andis divided into a Volar and Dorsal Branch. The Volar Branch, after sending Twigs to the An- nular Ligament, is distributed to the Muscles and In- teguments of the Thumb. * The Dorsal Branch is again subdivided into numa- rous other Branches, some of which go to the Muscles in the interval of the Metacarpal Bones of the Thumb and Fore-Finger, a few Filaments being distributed to the Annular Ligament; while principal Branches run, one along each side of the Fore and Mid Finger, and likewise along the Radial side of the Ring Finger. The Ramus Profundus, after sending several Branch- es to the Extensores Radiales and Supinator Brevis, perforates the latter, and gets to the back part of the Fore-arm. After quitting the Supinator, it descends under the Extensor Primi Internodii Pollicis and Extensor Digi- torum to the Back of the Hand. In this course, it sends Branches to the different Extensors of the Thumb and Fingers, and at length degenerates into a slender Branch, which, at the Wrist, adheres closely to the Annular Ligament. It has here a Gangliform appearance, and is dispersed, partly upon this Ligament, and partly on the Membranes and Mus- cles on the back part of the Metacarpus.

Part V.] OF THE BLOOD-VESSELS. 9$ the other; and in rarer instances, three or more have been found* There is occasionally, also, some variety in point of origin, sometimes the right coming off higher than the left, and sometimes the reverse. In a specimen in the Anatomical Museum of the University of Edinburgh, one of the Kidneys, which is situated in the back part of the Pelvis, has its Artery from the Bifurcation of the Aorta, while the other, placed a little higher than the former, and towards the left side of it, derives its Artery from the lateral part of the Aorta, lower than the Mesenterica Inferior. Vena Renalis. The Vena Renalis, vel EMULGENSj terminates in the Inferior Cava, and is more superficial, and less variable, than its corresponding Artery. It is the largest Vein received by the Cava from its origin to the part where it reaches the Liver* The Left Renal Vein is longer than the Right, in consequence of the Aorta lying between the left Kidney and the Cava. It is situated on the fore part of the Aorta, and goes first behind, but afterwards anterior to the corresponding Artery. Sometimes, though rarely, it passes between the Aorta and Spine. The Right Vein is short, it covers the Artery, and passes directly into the Cava. ARTERLE ET VEN^ CaPSULARES. The Arterle Capsulares, or Arteries of the Re- nal Capsules or Glands, are small but numerous.

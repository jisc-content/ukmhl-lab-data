Part V.] OF THE BLOOD-VESSELS. 85 From the last of these Areolae, many Branches are detached, which take a straight course to the concave part of the Intestines, where each divides into two that are afterwards ramified on the opposite sides of the Sub- stance of the Gut, forming numberless Anastomoses with each other, first on the same side, then on the op- posite one. They terminate at length upon the inner surface of the Tube, by Branches so minute as to re- quire the assistance of Glasses to view them distinctly. In this part of the Canal they are observed to form innumerable Plexus. The Branches produced from the right or concave side of the Trunk are situated between the Layers of the Meso-colon,—their length being almost equal to the breadth of that Membrane. Near the Colon, they communicate by large, and then by smaller Arches,—but the Arteries here are of greater magnitude than those which belong to the small Intestines; their Arches are also larger, but they are less frequent, and nearer the Gut; of course the last Ramifications sent off from these Arches are shorter than those belonging to the Small Intestines, The principal Branches, from the concave side of the Trunk, are the following : The Ilio-Colica, which arises near the under part of the Trunk, supplies the end of the Ilium and begin- ning of the Colon, and communicates with the Branches sent from the Extremity of the Trunk of the Artery : A Short Trunk, which divides into— The Colica Deoctra, vel Ramus Colicus Dexter, for supplying the right side of the Colon,—its Branches communicating with those of the Ilio-colica, and with

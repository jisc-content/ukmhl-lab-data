Part VII.] OF THE NERVES. 249 or three long slender Branches to the roots of the Lum- bar Nerves, and before, by other slender Nerves, to the Aortic Plexus. In the Pelvis also it forms Ganglia, which are con- nected to the Sacral Nerves on one side, and to its fel- low on the other, by cross Branches. Filaments are sent off, in the Pelvis, from the Sym- pathetic, to the Muscles and Membranes about the Os Coccygis, and to the Intestinum Rectum. Lumbar Nerves. The Five Lumbar Nerves, immediately after emerging from between the Bones, communicate with each other. They are also connected with the Sympa- thetic Nerve by Branches which run over the sides of the Vertebrae, and send large Branches backwards to the Muscles and Integuments on the posterior part of the Loins. By their connexions with each other, they compose a Plexus termed Lumbar, which is situated behind the Psoas. This Plexus sends Branches outwards to the Quadratus Lumborum, andto the Flexorsof the Thigh, The First Lumbar Nerve is connected by a small Branch to the Twelfth Dorsal, and by its Trunk to the Second Lumbar. After giving Twigs to the Muscles of the Loins, it detaches a principal Branch, which passes over the Quadratus Lumborum towards the Spine of the Os Ilium, where it sends Branches to the Integuments of the Pelvis, to the upper and outer part of the Thigh, to the under end of the Abdominal Muscles, to the In-

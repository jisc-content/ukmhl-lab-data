Part V.] OF THE BLOOD-VESSELS. 87 These near the Intestines, join with each other, and form arches, from which others go off, composing Areolae, and, in the Substance of the Intestines, Anas- tomoses and Plexus, much after the same manner with those which belong to the right side of the Colon, The principal Branches are,â€” The "Ramus Ascendens, which divides near the Intes- tine into two Branches : one of which joins the Colica Media, to form the Great Meso-colic Arch, the other is reflected upon the left portion of the Colon: The Colica Sinistra, vel Ramus Colicus Sinister, which is frequently double from its origin, or at other times splitting into two Branches, one joining the Ra- mus Ascendens, the other passing down by the Sigmoid Flexure of the Colon: The Hcemorrhoidalis Interna, which is of great size, being the Trunk continued. It anastomoses with the Colica Sinistra, and afterwards descends by many Branches, upon the back part of the Rectum, as far as the under extremity of that Intestine; communi- cating with the Arteries in the adjacent parts of the Pelvis. Veins. The Veins which return the blood from the Chylo- poietic and Assistant Chylopoietic Viscera, accompany their respective Arteries; the Hepatic Veins excepted. They have, like their Arteries, large and frequent com- munications with each other, but are much superior in size, and, as well as the other Veins of the Viscera situ- ated in the great Cavities, are destitute of Valves.

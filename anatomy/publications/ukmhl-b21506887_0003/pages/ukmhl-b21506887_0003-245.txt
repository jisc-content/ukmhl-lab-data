Part VII.] OF THE NERVES. SIS tal, and in the Loins from the Lumbar Arteries ; all of which go through the Intervertebral Holes. It terminates at the under end of the Spinal Mar- row ; the Cauda Equina being supplied by Branches from the Internal Iliac Artery, which enter through the anterior and posterior Holes of the Os Sacrum. The Posterior Spinal Arteries commonly arise from the Inferior Arteries of the Cerebellum, and frequent- ly from the Trunks of the Vertebral Arteries within the Cranium. They are equal in length to the former Artery, but considerably inferior to it in size, and continue separate through the whole of their course. They have constantly a serpentine appearance, and form frequent Inosculations with each other, and with Arteries, the Branches of which communicate with the Anterior Spinal Artery. The Arteries of the Spinal Marrow are divided into minute Branches which are dispersed upon its Sub- stance, upon the Membranes which inclose it, and also upon the Origins of the Nerves, and Substance of the Vertebras. The Veins of the Spinal Marrow, like the Arteries, are remarkably small; they accompany the ramifica- tions of these, and afterwards terminate in the Sinus Venosi of the Spine. The Sinus Venosi consist of one on each side of the Spinal Marrow, which runs exterior to the Dura Ma- ter ; being chiefly lodged in the Cellular Substance, and in the Ligamentous Membrane which lines the fore and lateral parts of the Vertebral Canal. They extend from the Foramen Magnum of the Oc-

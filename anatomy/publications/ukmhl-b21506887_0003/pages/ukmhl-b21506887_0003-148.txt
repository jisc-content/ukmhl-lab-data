126 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part V. Achillis and Malleolus Interims ; having the Tibialis Posticus and Flexor Digitorum Longus on the inner, and the Flexor Longus Pollicis on the outer side of it. From the Ankle, it passes in the hollow of the Os Calcis, between that Bone and the Abductor Pollicis, to the Sole of the Foot. Its branches supply the Muscles, Integuments, and Membranes, at the back and inner part of the Leg, and through the whole length of the Sole; forming many Inosculations with the Branches of the Anterior Tibial, and Fibular Arteries, on the different sides of the Leg and Foot. In the deep-seated parts there are also many communications, by means of perforations in the Interosseous Ligament. In its course along the Leg, it gives off— Numerous Branches, similar to those of the Tibialis Antica, to the surrounding Muscles : The Arteria Nutritia Tibiae, which begins a little below the upper end of the Trunk, descends for some way in the Leg, and gives Branches to the deep Mus- cles and Membranes near it, and one Branch, termed Arteria Medullaris, which enters the Hole near the middle of the Bone : Several Branches to the parts behind, and at the in- ner side of the Ankle and Heel, which communicate with others of the Anterior Tibial Artery. The Trunk of the Artery divides in the hollow of the Os Calcis, at the place where it is about to go be- hind the Abductor Pollicis, into two principal Plantar Branches,—the Internal and External Plantar s.

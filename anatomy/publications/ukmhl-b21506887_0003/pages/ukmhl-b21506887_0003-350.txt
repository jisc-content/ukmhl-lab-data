280 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part IX. ried along in the direction of these, so as to separate the Cellular Substance entirely from them, and render their Surface perfectly distinct. 4. In dissecting the Muscles, they ought to be laid in the position which puts the Fibres most upon the stretch. 5. When a Muscle is to be raised to show others deeper seated, it should always be cut from within a little of its origin, to allow it afterwards, if necessary, to be replaced. 6. The Cellular Substance ought, in general, to be removed entirely away, along with the Integuments; though, in certain parts of the Body, it may be better to clear away the Integuments by themselves, so as to prepare for the nicer parts of the Dissection. 7. In removing the Cellular Matter by itself, atten- tion should be paid to the keeping of it as much as possible in an entire web, as time is lost in removing it in patches. 8. When the Muscles are covered by Tendinous Fasciae, the Surface of the latter ought to be first ex- amined. They should next be raised, to allow the Muscles, &c. which they cover, to be properly dis- sected. 9. In dissecting a first Subject, the Blood-vessels ought not to be injected, for the parts have a more natural appearance when free from the Injection. The Trunks only of the Vessels and Nerves should in this case be examined, reserving the minuter Ramifications of these to be dissected in a Subject well injected, and (dedicated to that purpose. 10. In the various Dissections, attention should be

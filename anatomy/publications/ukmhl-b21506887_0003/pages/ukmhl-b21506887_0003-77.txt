Its ex- treme Branches anastomose with those of the Anterior Circumflex Artery, so as completely to encompass the Body of the Bone. 11 inosculates also with the Branches of the Dorsalis Scapulae Inferior. Though the above is the common origin of the Cir- cumflex Artery, it frequently happens that they come off from the Humeral Artery ; or one rises from the Axillary, and the other from the Internal Scapulary, or they often come off by a common Trunk. After giving off these different Branches, the Axil- lary Artery emerges from behind the edge of the Pec- toralis Major, and runs along the Os Humeri, where it is termed Humeral or Brachial Artery. Humeral Artery. The Humeral Artery, which is a continuation of the Axillary one, descends at the inner part of the Arm, between the Tendons of the Latissimus Dorsi and Pectoralis Major, and behind the internal edge of the Coraco-brachialis and Biceps. It is covered by the ge- neral Aponeurosis, and has the Triceps Extensor Cli- bit i and Brachialis Internus at the back part of it. In this course, it bestows Branches to the Muscles and Integuments, and to the Periosteum and Bone, viz. A Branch under the Coraco-brachialis to the Cap- sule of the Joint and parts adjacent to it.

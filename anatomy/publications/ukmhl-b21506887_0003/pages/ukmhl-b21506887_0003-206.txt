174 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part VII. veral Funiculi closely connected, and each of these again of smaller Fibrillar, which may be subdivided into parts so extremely minute, as almost to elude the naked Eye, but which may be readily seen by the as- sistance of a Microscope ; some Nerves consist of only one Funiculus. No Cavity has been yet observed in the Nerves. The Medullary Part of the Fibrillar appears to be furnished with Cineritious Substance derived from their Pia Mater; in proof of which, they are observed to be in general of a browner colour than the Medullary Substance of the Brain, and larger in their course than at their supposed origin.â€”Monro's Obs. onNerv. Syst. The Medullary Substance of the Fibrillar is Pulpy and tender, but rendered thicker and stronger by the coverings they receive from the Tunica Arachnoidea and Pia Mater while within the Bones, and more par- ticularly by the additional covering given them by the Dura Mater upon their exit. They possess a great degree of strength in conse- quence of the covering they derive from the Dura Mater, but have very little elasticity. The Dura Mater, in its passage through the base of the Cranium, and between the different Vertebras, is connected by its External Surface to the Pericranium and Periosteum; while the inner part of it, together with the Tunica Arachnoidea and Pia Mater, is conti- nued along the Nerves. The Involucra, or Coverings, inclose each of the Nerves in general, and likewise the several Fibrillse of which they are composed, whereby the size, as well as strength of*the Nerve, is greatly increased.

138 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part VI. face of the large Cavities, and from the Surface and Substance of the different Viscera ; but have not yet been distinctly observed in the Cavity of the Cranium and Spine, nor in the Placenta and^its Membranes. Mascagni, however, represents a few Lymphatics both upon the Brain and its Membranes. In the different parts of the Body, they generally run in two Sets; one Superficial and very numerous, the number being much greater than that of the red Veins, the other accompanying the Arteries, [and at least double their number. In general, they have a waving direction, and form an irregular Net-worJc, having frequent communica- tions with each other, more so than either the Arteries or Veins have; and these are most numerous in the vicinity of their Glands. The Communications of the Absorbents differ from those of the Blood-vessels in this, that when two of them unite to form a Trunk, it is commonly not larger than either of the Branches which enter into its com- position. The Lymphatics contain a pellucid, insipid, and slightly Viscid Fluid, which is considered by some of the latest Writers on the Subject, as being chiefly formed of a Solution of the Blood. Mr Brande found in it a small quantity of common Salt. Lacteal Vessels. The Lacteals are of the same nature with the other Absorbents. They begin from the inside of the Intes- tines ; and when these contain Alimentary Matter, the

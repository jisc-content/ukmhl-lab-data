260 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part VII. The Tibial Nerve passes afterwards between the Arteries and Os Calcis into the Sole. Plantar Nerves. In the hollow of the Os Calcis, after detaching Branches to the parts adjacent, the Tibial Nerve di- vides into Internal and External Plantar Nerves, which are nearly of equal size. The Internal Plantar Nerve runs near the in- ner side of the Sole, sends Filaments to the Adductor Pollicis, Flexor Digitorum Brevis, and Flexor Digito- rum Accessorius, and Twigs to the Lumbricales. It afterwards gives outfour large Branches, splitting into others, which run with the Arteries along each side of the three first Toes, and inner side of the Fourth Toe,â€”in the manner the Radial Nerve runs along the corresponding Fingers. The External Plantar Nerve sends Branches to the Heel, and passes with the Artery of the same name to near the outer edge of the Sole, where it splits into three principal Branches. The first, splitting into two, runs to the adjacent sides of the Fourth and Fifth Toes ; the second goes to the outer side of the Little Toe; the inner often anastomosing with the corresponding Branch of the Internal Plantar. The third forms an Arch corresponding with that of the External Plantar Artery, furnishes Branches to the short Muscles of the Little Toe, to the Interossei, Lum-

58 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part V. Branches to the Triceps and Coraco-brachialis: Various Branches to the Biceps, Brachialis Inter- ims, and Bone. Three Branches, more conspicuous than the rest, viz. the Profunda Humeri, Profunda Iriferior, and Ramus Anastomoticus Magnus. Profunda Humeri. The Profunda Humeri, vel Profunda Superior, vel Spiralis, arises near the upper part of the Arm, at the insertion of the Latissimus Dorsi and Teres Ma- jor, but sometimes has its origin from the Scapularis Interna, or from the Articularis Posterior, and in some very rare cases, is of great proportional size. It takes a Spiral direction downwards and outwards, between the Triceps and Bone, and terminates at the outer Condyle of the Os Humeri, by a large communicating Radial, or Prqfundo-radial Branch. The Arteria Profunda sends Branches upwards, which inosculate with others from the Humeral, Sca- pulary, and Circumflex Arteries. The principal Branches run to the Coraco-brachialis and Triceps, and to the Muscles at the outer part of the Elbow;—and one of them, termed large communicating Ulnar, or Prqfundo-idnar, descending at the inner side of the Arm, is sometimes so considerable as to form the— Profunda Inferior. The Profunda Inferior vel Minor, is frequently a Branch of the Profunda Superior, but commonly an

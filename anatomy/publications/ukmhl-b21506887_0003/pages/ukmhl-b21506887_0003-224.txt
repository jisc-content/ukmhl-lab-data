192 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part VII. ticus Minor, or Facial, arises from that part of the Brain which is common to the Pons Varolii, [Crus Cerebelli, and Medulla Oblongata; and, at its origin, is situated upon the inner side of the Portio Mollis. Between the origin of the Portio Dura and Trunk of the Portio Mollis, a small Nerve arises, termed by Wrisberg, Portio Media inter Portionem Duram et Portionem Mollem. It comes off by minute Fibrillar, which soon unite into a Trunk, from the posterior parts of the Pons Va- rolii, or from the adjoining parts of the Medulla Ob- longata, and is an Accessory Nerve of the Portio Dura. The Portio Dura, considerably smaller than the Por- tio Mollis, gets into a Cut de Sac of the Meatus Audi- torius Internus, and is there lodged in a kind of half- sheath, formed by the Portio Mollis, to which it is con- nected by fine Cellular Substance; the Dura Mater, which lines the Passage, giving here a general covering to both Nerves. Portio Mollis, Nervus Auditorius, vel Nervus Acusticus.â€”The Portio Mollis is formed of two Fas- ciculi, nearly of equal size, one of which belongs to the Cochlea, the other to the Vestibule and Semicircular Canals. Each of the Fasciculi passes by numberless Fibril- lae through the Cribriform Plate in the bottom of the Meatus Auditorius Internus, to the inner parts of the Labyrinth. The Fibrillse destined for the Cochlea go through the Holes in the sides of the Modiolus. Some pass between the Plates which form the Septa

122 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part V. directly through the upper end of the Interosseous Ligament, at the under edge of the Popliteus Muscle, to the fore part of the Leg. In its descent in the Leg, it adheres closely to the anterior surface of the Interosseous Ligament; lying at first between the Tibialis Anticus and Extensor Di- gitorum, and then between the Tibialis and Extensor Pollicis. A little above the Ankle, it passes upon the outer and fore part of the Tibia, and, getting under the Annular Ligament and Extensor Pollicis, advances in a waving direction upon the convex Surface of the Foot. It supplies, in general, the Muscles and Integuments which belong to the outer and fore part of the Leg and upper part of the Foot, and is ultimately spent upon the deep Muscles of the Sole. Its Branches come off in the following order, viz. A Small Branch sent off before the Trunk perforates the Interosseous Ligament, to be dispersed upon the Bones, Ligaments, and Muscles near the Joint of the Knee, particularly upon the Soleus and Tibialis Posti- cus ; the superior Twigs running in a retrograde di- rection, and inosculating with the Inferior Articular Branches : The Recurrens Anterior, which arises from the Ar- tery after it has perforated the Ligament, and passes up between the Tibialis Anticus and Extensor Digitorum Longus, to which it gives Branches, and is afterwards distributed upon the Ligaments at the upper part of the Leg, and upon those at the under part of the Knee, anastomosing therewith the Inferior Articular Arteries: Numerous Branches sent off, at short distances, in a

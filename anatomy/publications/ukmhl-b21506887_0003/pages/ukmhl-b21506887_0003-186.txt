160 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part VI. Thoracic Duct. All the Absorbents already described, excepting those from the convex Surface of the Liver, terminate in the Thoracic Duct near its beginning. The Thoracic Duct, at its under extremity, is form- ed by the union of three, or sometimes of more princi- pal Trunks ; the first of which is composed of the Lym- phatics of the right, and the second of those of the left Inferior Extremity ;â€”the third Trunk, or set of Trunks, belong chiefly to the Lacteals. These large Absorbents unite so as to form the Duct over the third Vertebra of the Loins. Sometimes they unite upon the second Vertebra, where the Duct formed by them is twice or thrice as large in diameter as it is higher up. It commonly enlarges again upon the first Lumbar Vertebra, where it has generally been called the Recep- taculum Chyli, and considered as the beginning of the Duct, being often found forming an oval, or Pyriform Bag, about a fourth or the third of an inch in diameter. These large Trunks, which form the Thoracic Duct, lie close upon the Spine, those of the right side being placed below the right Crus of the Diaphragm, and those of the left between the Aorta and Spine ; while the Thoracic Duct itself lies at first behind the Aorta, but afterwards passes from it upwards and a little to the right side, till it gets before the first Vertebra of the Loins. Here it is situated behind the Right Crus of the Dia- phragm, a little higher than the Right Renal Artery,

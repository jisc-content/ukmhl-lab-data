320 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part IX. the view of the parts to be examined. Trace the Arte- ries described in p. 59—66.; the Veins in p. 67, &c. ; Nerves, p. 220, &c. Dissection of the Blood-vessels and Nerves on the Anterior and Lateral Parts of the Tho- rax. Divide the Integuments along the Sternum, and turn them outwards. Cut and turn back the Serratus Mag- nus, and shew the Arteries described p. 53, 54, and the Branches of the Internal Mammary and Intercostal Arteries passing out between the Ribs to the Mamma and Pectoral Muscles. The Veins corresponding with these, and the Nerves from the Axillary Plexus and In- tercostals.—Vol. III. p. 69, 219. Dissection of the Blood-vessels and Nerves within the Thorax. Cut the Sternum longitudinally in its middle, from hear its upper end, to the Cartilago Ensiformis, on the Left side. Raise and turn outwards the Section of the Sternum, with the corresponding Ribs from the second to the seventh inclusive, from the External Mammary Vessels, which are to be left entire, adhering to a por- tion of the Pleura. Leave also the Diaphragm entire. Divide the Ribs at the Lateral part of the Thorax; turn them back, guarding against injuring the Inter- costal Vessels and Nerves. The Ribs may be divided by means of a Mallet and Chisel at the inner side of the Thorax, or by a Saw applied externally.

In some Subjects, they unite into Trunks in the middle of the Dorsum Penis, which afterwards sepa- rate into right and left parts. In others, they are unconnected; and in all, they appear to divide at the root of the Penis into right and left Branches, which pass into the corresponding In- guinal Glands, that lie next the Symphysis Pubis. The Deep-seated Lymphatics of the JJenis arise from the Glans, and from the Body of the Penis, and accom- pany the Arteries into the under part of the Pelvis. The Lymphatics of the Testicle are numerous, and are among the largest of the Body ; some of them ex_ ceeding the size of a Crow-quill. They arise from the Coats and Substance of the Tes- ticle, and from the Epididymis, and run with the Sper- matic Cord through the Abdominal Rings, to termi- nate in the Lumbar Glands.â€”In their passage they have few communications with each other.

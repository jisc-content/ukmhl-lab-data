%m COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part VIL Arteries, and extend some way upon the Fleshy Pil- lars of the Diaphragm. From the Cceliac Ganglia innumerable Nerves issue out on all sides, forming a Plexus, termed by some Authors, Solar, which extends along the Trunks and Branches of the Cceliac and Superior Mesenteric Ar- teries. The Nerves upon these Arteries are so intermixed with each other, and with Cellular Substance, as to form confused Webs ; the name of Plexus, however, is still retained, and the particular name of each Plexus is derived from the Artery which it surrounds, or the Viscus to which it belongs. Hepatic Plexus. The Hepatic Plexus, after giving Twigs to the Renal Glands, sends Filaments to the Diaphragm, which accompany the Diaphragmatic Arteries, and anastomose with Branches of the Phrenic Nerves. It afterwards divides into Right and Left Plexus, corresponding with the Right and Left Branches of the Hepatic Artery, or with the Right and Left Trunks, when such are present. The Left Hepatic Plexus furnishes several Branches to the Stomach, which intermix with those of the Eighth Pair, upon the small Curvature. The Right Hepatic Plexus sends Branches to the corresponding parts of the Pancreas, to the small end of the Stomach, and beginning of the Duodenum, and gives origin to the Right Gastro-Epiploic Plexus, which attends the Artery of the same name, distributing its

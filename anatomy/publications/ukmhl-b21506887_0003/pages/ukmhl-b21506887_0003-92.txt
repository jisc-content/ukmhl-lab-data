72 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part V. Thymus Gland, and which, like the Gland itself, are most considerable in a young Subject: A minute Branch, termed Comes Nervi Phrenici, and Pericardio-Diaphragmatica, which accompanies the Phrenic Nerve, and, after giving Twigs to the neigh- bouring Membranes, is distributed upon the Dia- phragm : Some small Branches, called Mediastinal, and Peri- cardiacce, to the Mediastinum and Pericardium, and others to the Sternum and Cartilages of the Ribs. Several Branches, outwards to the Intercostales, and others between the Cartilages of the True Ribs, at the edge of the Sternum, to the Pectorales, Mamma, and Integuments, which communicate with those of the Thoracicae Externse. A Large Branch at the under end of the Thorax, or near the Cartilage of the Sixth Rib, termed Musculo- phrenica9 which is dispersed upon the Diaphragm, and partly also upon the Transversalis Abdominis, and com- municates with the Intercostals. The Mammary Artery afterwards emerges from the Thorax, commonly under the Cartilage of the Seventh True Rib, and forms an Epigastric Branch, which runs anterior to the Peritoneum, upon the back part of the Rectus Abdominis, upon the upper end of which it is dispersed, after sending a Branch to the Obliqui Abdo- minis. Arteri^e Bronchiales. The Arterle Bronchiales come chiefly from the fore and near the upper part of the descending Aorta,

30 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part V. ing with the Anterior Branch, and with the Occipitalis on the same side of the Head, and also with the pos- terior Temporal Branch of the opposite side.â€”From this and from the other Branches of the Head, nume- rous Twigs go to the Peri cranium/and to the Substance of the Bone. Internal Carotid Artery. The Internal Carotid, termed also Arteria Cere- bralis, vel Encephalica, is arched back at its Origin, and then ascends in a waving direction, at the lateral and posterior part of the Pharynx, on the fore side of the Rectus Capitis Anterior Major, as far as the Fo- ramen Caroticum, without giving off any Branches. At the Base of the Cranium, it makes a sudden turn forwards, and enters the Carotic Canal of the Temporal Bone. While in the Canal, it passes upwards and for- wards like the Canal itself, and is surrounded by a con- siderable quantity of Cellular Substance and the Dura Mater, which form a Cushion between it and the Bone ; of course Pulsation is admitted here, as well as in other parts of the Arterious System. After leaving the Canal, it again bends upwards and then forwards, by the side of the Sella Turcica, and here it is situated within the Cavernous Sinus ; and perforating the Dura Mater, at the root of the Ante- rior Clinoid Process, it is suddenly reflected oblique- ly backwards and upwards ; after which it divides into Branches. Through the whole of its course, it runs in a serpen-

Part VII.] OF THE NERVES. 193 of the Gyri; others go through Holes between the Os- seous Plates of the Lamina Spiralis ; but by much the greatest number perforate the sides of the Modiolus* between the Septum of the Gyri and the Lamina Spi- ralis. The larger Fibrillar run upon the Membrane cover- ing the Lamina Spiralis* while the smaller go from the Modiolus, between the Osseous Septa, and on the inner sides of the Gyri, to be dispersed upon the Membrane lining them. The remaining Fibrillar perforate the Plate common to the Modiolus and Infundibulum, and vanish upon the last half-turn of the Lamina Spiralis, and upon the Cu- pola of the Cochlea., Upon the Osseous part of the Lamina Spiralis, the Nerves have the common appearance; but upon the Membranous Portion, they are of the colour of the Re- tina of the Eye. In the whole of their course upon the Lamina Spira- lis, they form a real Retina.; though the reticulated structure becomes much less apparent upon the outer part of this Lamina, and upon the continuation of the Membrane lining the Gyri*—the Nerves seeming to terminate in a semi-transparent Pulpy Membrane, re- sembling the Retina of the Eye. The Membrane upon which the Nerves are expanded is but slightly connected to the Periosteum, which lines the inner side of the Cochlea, and which, though thin, may be readily perceived, being painted with Blood- vessels; nor does it differ from the Periosteum lining the Tympanum.—See Dr IMonro's Treatise on the Ear. vol. nr. u

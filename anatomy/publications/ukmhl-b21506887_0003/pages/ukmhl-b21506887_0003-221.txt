Part VII.] OF THE NERVES. 189 stance of the Upper Jaw, the Large Dentes Molares, and Membrane lining the Antrum Maxillare. The Second Part of the Fifth Pair, after sending off these different Branches, goes into the Canal under the Orbit, and forms the Infra-Orbitar Nerve, which, while in the Canal, gives off Filaments passing through mi- nute Conduits, in the Upper Jaw, to the Antrum, to the Substance of the Bone, to the small Molares, Cani- nus, and Incisores; and sometimes a Twig, the com- panion of a small Branch of the Internal Maxillary Artery, to the Membrane lining the Orbit. The Infra-Orbitar Nerve passes afterwards out of the Foramen Infra-Orbitarium, and divides into many large Branches, to be distributed upon the Cheek, Under Eye-lid, Upper Lip, and side of the Nose. The Third Branch, or Inferior Maxillary Nerve, goes through the Foramen Ovale of the Sphe- noid Bone, and supplies the parts belonging to the Under J aw, and the Muscles situated between it and the Os Hyoides, by the following Branches, viz. One, or sometimes two, Deep Temporal Branches, to the inner part of the Temporal Muscle. Branches to the Masseter, Pterygoideus, and Bucci- nator. A Branch, which passes behind the Cervix of the Lower Jaw, and gives off Filaments to the fore part of the Ear, and afterwards accompanies the Temporal Artery upon the side of the Head, where it termi- nates. A Branch to the Buccinator, and other parts of the Cheek. A Nerve of considerable size, termed Lingual or Gus-

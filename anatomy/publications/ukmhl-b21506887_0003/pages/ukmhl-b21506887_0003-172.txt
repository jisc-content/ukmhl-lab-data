146 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part VI. PARTICULAR ABSORBENTS. Absorbents of the Lower Extremity. The Superficial Absorbents of the Lower Extremity consist of numerous Vessels, which are imbedded in the Cellular Substance, between the Skin and Muscles. They belong to the Integuments in general, and are much more numerous than the Subcutaneous Red Veins. They can be traced from the Toes, round which they form a Plexus. From the Toes several Branches, likewise forming a Plexus, run over the top of the Foot, to the inner part of the Leg, and from that along the corresponding side of the Knee. From the outer part of the Foot, another Plexus arises, which runs along the outside of the Leg, where it splits into two divisions, one of which crosses ob- liquely over the fore part of the Tibia, to the Lym- phatics at the inner side of the Knee. The other division passes partly to the Popliteal Glands, some ascending upon the outer and back part of the Thigh. The Popliteal Glands are commonly two or three in number, and situated near the Artery of the same name; but frequently they are so small, and so much buried in Fat, as to be discovered with difficulty.

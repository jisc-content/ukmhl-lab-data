184 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part VII. Each of the Nerves of this Pair arises by a single, and sometimes by a double root, behind the Testes, from the Medullary Expansion, which lies over the passage to the Fourth Ventricle, and which unites the Processus ad Testes to each other. It afterwards turns round the Crus Cerebri, and some way behind the entrance of the Third Pair, per- forates the Dura Mater at the edge of the Tentorium. It then runs along the Cavernous Sinus, at the outer side of the Third Nerve, crosses over that Nerve ; and passing out of the Cranium through the Foramen La- cerum, it goes obliquely over the Muscles at the upper part of the Orbit, to be entirely dispersed upon the Obliquus Superior vel Trochlearis, Fifth Pair. The Fifth Pair, or Trifacial, or Par Trigemi- num, which are the largest Nerves of the Brain, arise, each by an anterior small and posterior large Portion, from the side of the Tuber Annulare, where the Crura Cerebelli join it. It is at first of a flat form, and enters the Dura Ma- ter a little below the Tentorium, over the point of the Pars Petrosa of the Temporal Bone, to form a flat Plexus, in which upwards of fifty Fasciculi have fre- quently been enumerated. The Plexus sinks close by the outside of the Caver- nous Sinus, concealed by a Doubling of the Dura Mater, and forms a Ganglion, sometimes called Gasserian. The Ganglion is of a Semilunar form, and placed transversely with respect to the Trunk of the Nerve.

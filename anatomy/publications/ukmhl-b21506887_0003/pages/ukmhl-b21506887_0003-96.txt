76 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part V. Some small Veins, as the Pericardio-diaphragmatic, the Thymic, and Pericardiac, which, in place of joining the Mammary Trunk, commonly terminate, the Right in the Subclavian, or top of the Cava, and the Left in the corresponding Subclavian Vein : The Ven^e Intercostales, which are the same in number with their Arteries, and accompany them along the edges of the Ribs. They terminate, partly in the Vena Semi-Azygos, but chiefly in the Vena Azygas. Vena Azygos. Several of the Lower Left Intercostals unite into a Trunk, termed Vena Azygos, which crosses over the Spine, about the middle of the Thorax,—behind, but in some rare instances, before the Trunk of the Aorta, —to the right side. The Vena Azygos, vel Vena sine Pari, thus origi- nally formed by the Lower Left Intercostals, ascends on the fore part of the Spine over the Intercostal Ar- teries, on the right side of the Aorta. At its lower extremity, it generally communicates with one of the Lumbar or Renal Veins, and not un- frequently with the Trunk of the inferior Cava. Upon the Spine, it receives the Right Intercostals and the Right Bronchial Vein ; and turning forwards over the root of the Great Pulmonary Vessels of that side, it terminates in the Superior Cava, directly be- fore this Vein perforates the Pericardium. The Upper Left Intercostal Veins, or such as are not received by the Vena Azygos, terminate in a

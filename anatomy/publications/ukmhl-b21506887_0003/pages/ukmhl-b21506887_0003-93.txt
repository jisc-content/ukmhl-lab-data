Part V.] OF THE BLOOD-VESSELS. 73 and are distributed to the Lungs. They vary much in different Subjects, both in origin and number. They commonly consist of, The Bronchialis Dextra, which arises sometimes from the Aorta, but more frequently from the upper- most Aortic Intercostal, and runs to the corresponding Lung : The Bronchialis Communis, which, however, is frequently absent. It arises from the upper and fore part of the descending Aorta, divides into two Branches, one to the Left Lung, the other to the Right one, and also to the Esophagus : The Bronchiales Sinistra, Superior et Inferior, which are of unequal size, arising from the fore part of the Aorta, at a little distance from each other; the Inferior occasionally coming off from those of the Esophageals. The Bronchial Arteries send small Branches to the Esophagus^ to the Posterior Mediastinum, to the Pe- ricardium, and to the Bronchial Glands, and after- wards accompany the Branches of the Trachea through the Substance of the Lungs, being dispersed upon the Bronchi, upon the Coats of the Pulmonary Artery and Veins, and upon the Cellular Substance and Mem- branes of the Lungs ; where they communicate also by minute Branches with the Pulmonary Artery. Arteri^e Esophage/E. The Arteri^ Esophage.e are a few minuteBranches arising from the different parts of the Aorta, or from the Bronchials, and dispersed upon the Esophagus, also

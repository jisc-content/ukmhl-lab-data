Part V.J OF THE BLOOD-VESSELS. 131 It terminates in the Vena Poplitea, and, a little above the Knee, communicates constantly by a small Branch with the Saphena Major. Deep Veins. The Deep Veins of the Leg, like those of the Fore- arm, run close at each side of their Arteries, and are double their number, but differ a little from the Deep Radial or Ulnar Veins, in being proportionally larger. The Tibial and Fibulae Veins anastomose in some places with each other, and also communicate with the Subcutaneous Veins. At the upper part of the Leg they are united toge- ther to form the Vena Poplitea, and the union is nearly at the same place where the corresponding Arteries come off. The Vena Poplitea adheres closely to the upper or posterior Surface of the Artery, being more superficial than the latter, which it in a great measure conceals, and is commonly single, excepting a small Vein which sometimes accompanies it, and communicates with it. The Popliteal Vein receives the Venae Surales and Articulares, and the Saphena Minor; after which it forms the Femoral Vein. Vena Femoralis. The Vena Femoralis receives the Veins which cor- respond with the perforating Branches of the Femoral

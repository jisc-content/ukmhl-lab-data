120 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Pakt V. the Semi-membranosus and Semi-tendinosus, and, after perforating the Tendon of the Triceps, is dispersed up- on the upper and inner part of the Knee, anastomosing with Branches sent down from the Femoral Artery. The Articularis Superior Externa, which arises near- ly opposite to the former, passes outwards between the Tendon of the Biceps and body of the Os Femoris, immediately above its outer Condyle, and is lost upon the Vastus Externus, and upon the upper and outer part of the Knee; its Branches anastomosing with those of its fellow, and particularly with the long de- scending Branch of the Circumflexa Externa : The Articularis Inferior Interna, which arises oppo- site the bending of the Joint, passes downwards, and then turns round the Tibia, immediately below its In- ner Condyle. It sends Branches first to the back part, then to the inner side of the Knee ; some of them passing by the Semilunar Cartilage into the internal part of the Joint. It communicates above with the Branches of the Articularis Superior Interna. The Articularis Inferior Externa, which comes off near the former, and passes first downwards, then out- wards, between the External Lateral and the Capsu- lar Ligaments, to be dispersed upon the under and outer side of the Knee and inner part of the Joint; communicating with its fellow of the opposite side, and above, with the Branches of the Articularis Superior Externa. Besides the Superior and Inferior Articulating Arte- ries, another Branch is frequently found, termed Artu

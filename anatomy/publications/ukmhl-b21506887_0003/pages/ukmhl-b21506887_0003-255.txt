Part VII.] OF THE NERVES. 223 from each of the Trunks, excepting from that of the First Dorsal. It is rather larger than any other Nerve of the Supe- rior Extremity, and is distinguished by its Spiral di- rection. It is at first situated between the Axillary Artery and the Ulnar Nerve, and passes obliquely downwards between two of the Heads of the Triceps Extensor Cubiti, and afterwards behind the Os Humeri, to the outside of the Elbow. From thence it proceeds among the Muscles of the Radial side of the Fore-arm, as far as the Hand. While passing behind the Os Humeri, it gives seve- ral Branches of considerable size to the different Heads of the Triceps; some of them accompanying the Branches of the Arteria Spiralis, and terminating on the Heads of the Extensors of the Hand. Immediately behind the Body of the Os Humeri, it transmits a Subcutaneous Branch, which is distributed upon the Muscles and Integuments on the posterior part of the Fore-arm, anastomosing at last with the Nerves on the back part of the Hand. The Trunk of the Nerve, having arrived at the El- bow, is lodged in a Fissure between the Brachialis In- ternus and Radial Extensors of the Carpus, and there gives off other Branches to the Extensors and the Su- pinators of the Hand. At the Head of the Radius, the Trunk of the Nerve divides into two nearly equal-sized Branches,â€”the Superficialis and Profundus. The Superficialis, continued almost straight from the Trunk, transmits, first a Branch to the Extensores Ra-

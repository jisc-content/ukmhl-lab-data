Paet VII.] OF THE NERVES. 231 It descends in the Neck, along the outer and fore part of the Scalenus Anticus, and enters the Thorax behind the anterior extremity of the First Rib, be- tween the Subclavian Artery and corresponding Vein. In the Thorax, it passes first over the root of the Lungs, and then proceeds along the Pericardium, to which it adheres closely in its way to the Diaphragm. The Right Phrenic has nearly a straight direction opposite to the Superior Cava and Right Auricle; while the Left makes a considerable Curve near its un- der end, corresponding with that part of the Pericar- dium which covers the point of the Heart. Upon the Surface of the Diaphragm, the Trunk is divided into several Branches, which are distributed in a radiated manner upon the Fleshy sides of that Muscle. Pars Vaga. The Pars Vaga, upon approaching the Thorax, sends one, and sometimes two Filaments, termed Car- diac Nerves, which join the Cardiac Branch of the Sympathetic, as already observed. It enters the Thorax between the Subclavian Ar- tery and Vein, and, after giving off the Recurrent Nerve, passes behind the root of the Lungs. Nervus Recurrens. The Recurrent Nerve is reflected upwards, be- hind the Subclavian Artery in the right, and behind the Arch of the Aorta in the left side of the Thorax ;â€”in

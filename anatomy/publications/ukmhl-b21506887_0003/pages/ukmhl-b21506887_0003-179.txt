Part VI.] OF THE ABSORBENTS. 153 seated Lymphatics of the Liver, along with which they terminate in the Thoracic Duct* The other Set passes from the great Curvature of the Stomach, partly to the right, and partly to the left side, and, as on the small Curvature, is formed of Branches from its opposite Surfaces. Those on the left side receive the Lymphatics of the middle and corresponding half of the Omentum Majus ; running to the left side of the large Curvature of the Stomach; and passing through one or two small Glands on it, they go with the Lymphatics of the Spleen and Pancreas to the Thoracic Duct. Those of the right side receive the Lymphatics of the corresponding half of the great Omentum, and also pass through some small Glands which lie close to the Right Gastric Artery. In their descent by the Pylorus, they meet the Plexus which accompanies the Superior Coronary Ar- tery, and run with it, and with the Deep Lymphatics of the Liver, to the Thoracic Duct. Lacteals or Absorbents of the Small Intestines. The Lacteal Vessels, so called from conveying a Fluid of the colour of Milk, begin upon the inner Sur- face of the Intestines. Each Lacteal takes its origin upon one of the Villi by numerous short radiated Branches, and each Branch is furnished with an Ori- fice for imbibing the Chyle. The Radiated Branches are collected into Fasciculi, which are inclosed in Processes of the Inner Coat of the Intestines. These Fasciculi are of a roundish form

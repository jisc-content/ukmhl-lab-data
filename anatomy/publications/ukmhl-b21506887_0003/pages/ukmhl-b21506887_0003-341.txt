Part VIII.] OF THE GLANDS. 271 vessels, but become extremely small before they reach the surface of the part upon which they are spent. The Excretory Ducts begin by innumerable Branches continued from the Acini, but are at first invisible, be- ing considered to be still smaller than the Arteries which give origin to them ;—and smaller also than the Veins, for Leeuenhoeck, by means of his Glasses, could per- ceive the origins of the one, but was unable to discover those of the other. They generally unite into larger Branches, and these, in their progress, into still larger, till a Trunk is form- ed ; or they join something in the manner of the Roots of a Tree, as is the case in the Liver, &c. ; or they form different Trunks, as in the Mamma and Prostate Gland. The Excretory Ducts are proportionally of a stronger texture than either the Arteries or the Veins ; but in this they vary much among themselves,—some, as the Parotid Duct and Vas Deferens, being thick and strong, '—-while others, as the Pancreatic, are so thin as to be semi-transparent. Each is composed of an outer and inner Membrane, and these, in the Ureter, have a Muscular Coat between them ; but in other Ducts their Muscularity is not ap- parent. The Inner Coat, or lining, probably continued from the Arteries, is a Mucous Membrane, in which, as in the Biliary Ducts, the Mouths of the Mucous Follicles can frequently be distinctly seen. The Excretory Ducts are straight in some Glands, as the Kidney ; tortuous in others, as the Testicle ;— or short in some, and long in others, in consequence of

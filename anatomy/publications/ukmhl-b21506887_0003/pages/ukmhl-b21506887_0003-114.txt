94 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part V. They are derived from the Renal and Diaphragma- tic Arteries, and sometimes there are Twigs from the Coeliac, or from the Lumbars; and, in general, the Renal Gland, especially the Left, receives additional Branches from the Trunk of the Aorta. The Capsular Arteries inosculate with those of the adjacent Viscera. The Ven.-e Capsulares commonly unite into a large Trunk, which, in the left side, terminates in the Re- nal Vein, while in the right it frequently goes into the Cava. Arterle et Ven.e Adipose. The Arteries which supply the Tunica Adiposa of the Kidneys are numerous Twigs proceeding from the Diaphragmatic, Capsular, and Renal Arteries, or from others near it. The Veins which return from the extremities of these Arteries, pass into the Trunks adjacent. Arteria et Vena Spermatica. The Arteria Spermatica, the diameter of which is small when compared with its great length, arises opposite to its fellow, from the fore part of the Aorta, a little below the Renal Arteries. Sometimes it arises from the Arteria Renalis, or Cap- sulars, at other times a little higher from the Aorta; in rarer instances, from the Diaphragmatic Artery, or from one of the Lumbares, and frequently the one comes off a little higher than the other, and occasional- ly they come off' from the Aorta in a common Trunk.

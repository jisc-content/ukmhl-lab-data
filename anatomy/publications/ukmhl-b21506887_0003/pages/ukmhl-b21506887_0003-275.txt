Part VII.] OF THE NERVES. 243 Filaments to the Great Curvature of the Stomach, and to the Omentum Majus. The Hepatic Plexus surrounds the Hepatic Artery and Vena Porta?, and, after sending several Filaments to the Biliary Ducts and Gail-Bladder, follows the Branches of the Blood-vessels through the Substance of the Liver. Splenic Plexus. The Splenic Plexus, composed of several small Filaments, surrounds the Splenic Artery, gives Twigs to the Pancreas, and then accompanies the Vessels in- to the Spleen. Superior Mesenteric Plexus. The Superior Mesenteric Plexus forms a Va- gina, which surrounds, and in great part conceals, the Trunk to the corresponding Artery. From this Plexus, numberless Filaments, many of them extremely minute, are produced, which run through the Mesentery, partly with the Blood-vessels, and partly at a distance from them ; and which, after supplying the Coats of the Vessels, and the Mesente- ric Glands, are distributed to the small Intestines in general, and to the right Portion of the Colon. The Nerves of the Colon, corresponding with the parts they have to supply, are larger than those of the small Intestines, and in several places form Arches, which are situated at the sides of the Arteries.

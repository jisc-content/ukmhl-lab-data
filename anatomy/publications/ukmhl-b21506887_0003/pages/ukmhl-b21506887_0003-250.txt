218 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part VII. of the Vertebrae, and joins the middle Ganglion of the Sympathetic Nerve. A Small Filament connects the Third Cervieal with the Descendens of the Ninth Pair. The Nerve is afterwards divided into External and Internal Branches. The External Branches form Anastomoses with the Nervus Accessorius, near the upper part of the Sca- pula ; while the Internal, after furnishing Twigs to the Jugular Glands, are dispersed by several large Branches upon the Muscles and Integuments at the under part of the Neck, and upper part of the Shoulder. . t. Fourth Cervical Nerve. The Fourth Cervical sends a Branch behind the Muscles situated on the fore and lateral parts of the Cervical Vertebra?, to the middle Ganglion of the Sympathetic Nerve. It is connected by one, and sometimes by two Fila- ments, to the Diaphragmatic Nerve. It gives Twigs to the Jugular Glands and deep Muscles of the Neck, and, at the outer edge of the an- terior Scalenus, joins the Fifth Cervical Nerve. Fifth, Sixth, and Seventh Cervicals, with the First Dorsal Nerve. , The Fifth Cervical is united with the Fourth in- to a Common Trunk, which, after running a little far- ther, joins the Sixth Cervical Nerve.

82 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part V. Liver, is sent off the Arteria Cystica, which afterwards divides into two smaller Branches, termed Gemellce, that are distributed upon the Gall-bladder, and Trunks of the Biliary Ducts. The Branches of the Hepatic Artery are ramified extensively through the Substance of the Liver ; they supply also the Coat which covers it, and, through the medium of the Ligaments connecting it to the Abdomen, they anastomose with the Phrenic and In- ternal Mammary Arteries. frequently, besides the Hepatic Artery sent off di- rectly from the C celiac, there is another, coming some- times from the Superior Gastric, at other times from the Superior Mesenteric Artery, or from the Aorta, to be sent into the Liver. In such cases, the Artery which gives origin to this additional one is greater than usual, and the Hepatic Artery, which this one accompanies, is proportionally smaller. Arteria Splenica. The Arteria Splenica, nearly equal in size to the Trunk of the Hepatica, and sometimes exceeding it, takes a long and serpentine course across the left side of the Body, the Flexures guarding it and the Spleen from being ruptured by over distension. It runs first behind, then at the upper end of the Pancreas, in its way to the Spleen.—Its Branches are— The Rami Pancreatici, which are few in number, and small. They run at different distances from the Splenic Artery nearly at right angles, and supply the greater part of the Pancreas :

Part VI.] OF THE' ABSORBENTS. 157 The Superficial and deep Sets communicate so free- ly, that, upon injecting the Lymphatics of the Exter- nal Surface, the Deep-seated Absorbents are readily filled from them. The greater number of the Lymphatics upon the convex Surface of the Liver, go by a Right and Left Plexus towards the Suspensory Ligament, and the Vessels of these Plexus, contrary to what happens in other parts of the Body, may be injected against the natural course of the Fluids. Running along this Ligament, they directly perforate the Diaphragm, after which they pass through Glands situated upon the anterior part of the Pericardium. Other Lymphatics from the convex part of the Liver run towards the Lateral Ligaments, where they form on each side one or more Trunks of considerable size. From the Lateral Ligaments they pass through the Substance of the Diaphragm, and afterwards run for- wards on its convex Surface, following the direction of the Ribs.—Not unfrequently these Vessels, instead of perforating the Diaphragm, run downwards, and ter- minate in the Thoracic Duct, within the Abdomen. In their course upon the Diaphragm, they often send Branches backwards, which terminate in Glands upon the Esophagus.—In other instances, these Branches are observed to go directly into the Thoracic Duct. They receive Branches from the Substance of the Diaphragm, and, after perforating two or three Glands upon its Surface, they join the Trunks from the Liga- mentum Suspensorium. The Lymphatics from the Lateral Ligaments, joined y those from the Ligamentum Suspensorium, form

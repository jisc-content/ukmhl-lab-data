The Arteria Anterior Cerebri turns towards its fellow of the opposite side, and commonly sends Fi- laments to the First and Second Cerebral Nerves. A little before the union of the Optic Nerves, the right and left Anterior Cerebral Arteries become al- most contiguous, and anastomose by means of a short, but large transverse Branch, and sometimes by two, which form part of that Communication of Vessels termed Circus Arteriosus Willisii. From the transverse Branch, but more frequently from the Anterior Cerebral Artery near it, a Branch is sent off, which passes into the Third Ventricle, and furnishes Twigs to the Septum Lucidum, and fore part of the Fornix. The Anterior Cerebral Artery ascends upon the in- ner side of the Anterior Lobe of the Brain, nearly pa- rallel to its fellow of the other side, and sends off a principal Branch, and commonly another soon after, both of which arch backwards upon the inner flat Sur- face of the Hemisphere. The continuation of the Anterior Cerebral Artery is termed Arteria Corporis Callosi, or simply Arteria Callosa, and is reflected back upon the union of the Corpus Callosum and Hemisphere as far as the poste- rior Lobe of the Brain. The Branches of the Anterior Cerebral Artery, are divided into minute Ramifications, which are first, c 2

68 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part f; Though this description corresponds with the gene- ral distribution of the Veins of the Fore-arm, yet so great is the variety among them, that they are scarce- ly found to agree exactly in any two Subjects. Frequently the Cephalic is almost entirely formed by the Mediana Cephalica, or the Basilic by the Me- diana Basilica. Sometimes the Mediana Longa Mi- nor goes into the Median Basilic. There are often more than two short Median Veins :â€”and sometimes, instead of a Mediana Major and Minor, there is an ir- regular Plexus ; but constantly a communication is found of the Veins on the Radial and Ulnar sides of the anterior part of the Fore-arm, and also a commu- nication between the superficial and deep Trunks at the bending of the Elbow. Vena Basilica. The Basilica, in its ascent, forms the principal Humeral Vein, which passes along the side of the Os Humeri, a little to the inner part of the Humeral Ar- tery \ and receiving Branches from the corresponding side of the Arm, and communicating with the deep Veins, it runs into the Arm-pit, and forms the Vena Axillaris. Vena Cephalica. The Cephalica ascends at the outer side of the Bi- ceps, receives Branches from the adjacent parts of the Arm, communicates in several places with the Basili- ca, and, passing in the Groove between the Pectoralis Major and the Deltoides, terminates in the Axillary Vein.

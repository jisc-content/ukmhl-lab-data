Part V.] OF THE BLOOD-VESSELS. 59 original Branch sent off from the Trunk of the Artery near the middle of the Arm. It gives Branches to the Muscles and other parts at the inside of the Arm, and terminates about the inner side of the Os Humeri. Ramus Anastomoticus Magnus. The Ramus Anastomoticus Magnus comes off a little above the Elbow, and bestows Branches to the Brachialis Internus, to the under end of the Triceps, and to the Muscles, Ligaments, and parts in general about the Elbow-Joint. The Ramus Anastomoticus is variable both in its origin and distribution ; frequent- ly instead of one there are two, or even three Anasto- mosing Arteries at this part of the Arm. The smaller Branches sent from "the Trunk of the Humeral Artery, pass in succession to the Muscles and other parts adjacent. They are shorter than the rest, and run more in a transverse direction, especially those to the Biceps. One small Branch, termed Nutritia or Medullaris, goes into the Substance of the Bone by the passage near its middle, and supplies the Marrow, and parts which contain it; though this Branch is some- times sent off from some of those in the neighbour- hood. The Humeral Artery, having sent off the different Branches which belong to the Arm, passes to the middle of the bending of the Elbow, between the Aponeurosis and Round Tendon of the Biceps ; here it is situated over the Brachialis Internus, having the Tendon of the Biceps and Extensors of the Fore-arm

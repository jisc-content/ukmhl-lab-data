It is situated between the Condyles, and is exhausted upon the Ligaments, Fat, and Bones, at the back part of the Joint; inosculating with all the ad- joining Branches. The other less constant Articular Branches are dis- persed upon the Muscles a little above the Joint. The Articular Arteries form numerous communica- tions with each other : some are expanded in the form of a net-work over the Patellaseveral are distributed upon the Capsular and other Ligaments of the Joint, while numerous Branches penetrate the Substance of the corresponding Bones. The Arteria Poplitea, having furnished Branches to the Joint of the Knee, gives others to the Muscles of the upper and back part of the Leg; two of which, termed Sureties, more considerable than the rest, pass by different Branches into the Heads of the Gastrocne- mius Externus. The Trunk of the Artery descends afterwards be- tween the heads of the Gastrocnemius, and commonly from two or three inches below the bending of the Knee, and at the under and outer edge of the Popliteus, or upper end of the Soleus, divides into two large Arte- ries, the Tibialis Antica, and Tibialis Postica. Tibialis Antica. The Tibialis Antica, analogous to the Radialis, arises from the fore part of the Poplitea. It passes

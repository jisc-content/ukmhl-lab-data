Most of these Lymphatics go along with the Internal Jugular Vein and common Carotid Artery, and, in their passage, form a remarkable Plexus, which goes through the numerous Glands seated near the Blood- vessels, composing a Chain, from which they are term- ed Glandulce Concatenates. The Glandular Concatenate are more numerous than any other set of Glands in the Body, excepting those which belong to the Mesentery. The Cervical Plexus of Lymphatics, having passed through the Glandulae Concatenate, and having re- ceived some Branches from the anterior part of the Thorax and Axillary Glands, unite at the bottom of the Neck into a Trunk, and sometimes two, which, in the left side, enter the Thoracic Duct near its termi- nation, and, in the right, go into the Trunk, which forms the general termination of that side. General Termination of the Absorbents in the right side of the neck. The Trunk which forms the termination mentioned above, is only from a quarter of an inch to half an inch in length, but its diameter not much less than that of the Thoracic Duct. It is formed by Lymphatics from the right side of the Liver, Diaphragm, Heart, and the Right Lobe of

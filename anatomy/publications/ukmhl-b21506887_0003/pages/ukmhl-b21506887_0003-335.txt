0Â¥ THE GLANDS. OF THE GLANDS IN GENERAL. Glands are circumscribed organic Substances, of a peculiar appearance and structure, belonging to the soft parts. They are inclosed in proper Membranes, and are destined for altering or secreting particular Fluids from the general mass of Blood, or for mak- ing certain changes upon the Fluids absorbed, so as to answer various purposes in the animal economy. The name has been originally derived from the word Glans, a Nut or Acorn, to which some of them bear a sort of resemblance. Some Glands are placed near the Surface of the Body, as the Cutaneous Glands, the Mammae, &c. ; others are deep-seated, as the Liver and Pancreas. Some are single, as the Spleen ; others double, as the Kidneys and Testes.

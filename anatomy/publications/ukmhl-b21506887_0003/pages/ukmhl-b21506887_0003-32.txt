12 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part V. are excepted, the size of which scarcely surpasses that of the corresponding Arteries. In the fleshy parts of the Body, particularly in the Extremities, the Veins consist of two Sets ; one Deep- seated, accompanying the Arteries, the other running immediately under the Skin, and termed Subcutaneous. The Veins of the Thoracic and Abdominal Viscera generally accompany their Arteries; and the same is observable in the small Branches belonging to Mem- branous parts. The Figure of the Veins is similar to that of the Ar- teries, but in certain parts of the Body they are more apt to swell out into Sinuses ; and, upon comparing the Area of their trunks with the collective Area of their Branches, like the Arteries too, they are perceiv- ed to be Conical; the Base of the Cone being formed by the Branches, and the Apex by the Trunks. The size and number of the Veins is in general so much greater than that of their corresponding Arte- ries, that when the Vessels of a Membranous Part are distended by Injections of different colours, the Veins are observed to form a Plexus, and in a great measure to conceal the Arteries: In the Intestines, however, the number of the Arteries and Veins is more nearly equal. There is much greater variety among the Trunks of Veins, with respect to situation and division into Branches, than is observable among the Arteries. The variety in Nature, in this respect, is such, that the Veins differ a little in every different Subject. . The Veins admit of less elongation than the Arteries,

Part VI.] OF THE ABSORBENTS. 141 by the assistance of penetrating Injections ; and this is rendered still more evident, by their being susceptible of inflammation. The presence of Nerves also appears probable, from their vicinity in many parts to considerable Nerves, and from the acuteness of their feeling when in an in- flamed state. Valves of the Absorbents. Through their whole extent, the Absorbents are in- tercepted by Valves, which, like the sides of the Vessels to which they belong, are of great proportional strength. They are placed in pairs, and are of a semicircular form ; having one edge of each Valve fixed to the side of the Vessel, and the other edge loose across its Cavi- ty, but turned towards the general terminations, being quite similar to the Valves of the Red Veins. In some parts, the Valves are found to be situated at equal distances ; in others, more irregularly.—Their number also is very uncertain, amounting in some parts to three or four, and in others to seven or eight pairs, or upwards, in the length of an inch;—but varying still more with respect to number in different Bodies, and in different parts of the same Body. Sometimes there is not above a single pair in the space of an inch, and occasionally a Lymphatic runs one or more inches without a Valve. When the Absorbents are distended, they appear largest on the side of the Valves towards their general terminations, and the enlargements are such as to give

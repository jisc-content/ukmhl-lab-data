Paet VII.] OF THE NERVES. 181 where the Carotid Arteries enter the Fissures of Syl- vius. The Trunks are of a flattened or rather triangular form, with one of the angles upwards, are more ten- der than the other Nerves, and also differ from them in not being composed of Fasciculi. They run each in a Furrow, covered by the Tunica Archnoidea, upon the outer Surface of the Anterior Lobes of the Brain, converging a little, and becoming somewhat larger, till they reach the Cribriform Plate of the Ethmoid Bone. Upon this Plate, each forms an Oval or Pyriform Bulb, which is widest anteriorly, and in colour and consistence resembles the Cortical part of the Brain, but is mixed with Streaks of Medullary Matter.* From this Bulb, numerous Nervous Filaments are sent off, which pass through the Holes of the Cribri- form Plate, and now become firm and strong like the other Nerves, by receiving a covering from the Dura Mater. After entering the Nose, they divide into two Por- tions or Planes, one passing into the Septum, the other upon the Os Spongiosum Superius, and other parts opposite to the Septum, and both running at first in Grooves of the Bones. They form a beautiful Plexus, which is spread out upon that side of the Membrane of the Nose that is contiguous to the Bones, and may be traced a consider- able way upon it, in distinct Threads, which becoming gradually smaller, sink into the Membrane, and are supposed to terminate on the Surface next the Cavity of the Nose, there constituting the Organ of Smell.

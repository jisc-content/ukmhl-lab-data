98 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Paet V, and, like that Artery, increases in size in the state of Pregnancy. It arises from the Hypogastric, near the origin of the Pudic, Hemorrhoidal, or Umbilical Arteries, and, get- ting between the Layers of the Ligamentum Latum, it runs to the Uterus at its under extremity. It is afterwards reflected upwards along the edge of the Uterus, towards its Fundus or upper part, where it meets the Spermatic Artery, with which it forms fre- quent Anastomoses. It runs under the outer Coat of the Uterus, and sends off many serpentine Branches, which plunge into its Substance; forming numerous communications with the Artery of the opposite side. The Uterine Artery sends Branches downwards, to be distributed extensively upon the Substance of the Vagina, a principal Branch of which is termed Vagi- nalis, and others forwards, to be dispersed upon the Bladder. Arteeia Vaginalis. The Aeteeia Vaginalis is commonly from the Ute- rine, at other times it is from the Trunk of the Hypo- gastric, or from some of the adjacent Branches, par- ticularly the middle Hemorrhoidal. It is extensively distributed upon the Vagina, communicating with the Uterine Branches at the Cervix of the Uterus. Besides this, there are other small Vaginal Branches from the neighbouring Arteries, as the Vesicates, Ute- rina, and Pudica, which communicate with each other, and with the proper Vaginalis, upon the Substance of the Vagina.

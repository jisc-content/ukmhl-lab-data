m COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part IX, will give a more complete view than formerly of the tuation of these Viscera ; or try to make this inflation by blowing Air through a slightly curved Tube, intro- duced by the Mouth into the Esophagus, after putting a Ligature round the Duodenum. While the Duodenum is distended, make a cut lon- gitudinally through the fore part of its second Curva- ture, to shew the termination of the Biliary Ducts. Examine next more distinctly, the situation and Ex- ternal Parts of the Liver, Spleen, and Pancreas; then remove them, with the Stomach and Duodenum, from the Body, for farther Dissection, by dividing the Car^ dia, and the different Ligaments, Blood-vessels, &c. which form the Adhesions. Dissect the different Coats of the Stomach, and a band of Muscular Fibres which runs along its Small Curvature;—trace the Lymphatic Glands on both Curvatures;—split open the Stomach, to allow its In- ner Coat and Rugae to be seen; dissect also the Sphincter Muscle of the Pylorus. Expose the Trunks of the different Vessels, and the Lymphatic Glands, &c. in the Capsule of Glisson. Introduce a Probe by the Mouth of the Ductus Choledochus in the Duodenum, and pass it into the Hepatic Duct,—then slit open the Biliary Tubes as far as their exit from the Liver and Gall-bladder, and attend to their structure. Peel off a portion of the Tunica Propria Hepatis, and examine the substance of the Liver. Distend the Gall-bladder, separate its Coats from each other, then lay it open and attend to the Rugae, &c. Endeavour to separate the two original Coats of the

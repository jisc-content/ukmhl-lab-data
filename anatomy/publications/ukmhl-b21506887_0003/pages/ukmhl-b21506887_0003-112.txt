The Artery of the right side goes behind the Vena Cava, and is longer than the left, in consequence of the Cava being si- tuated between the Aorta and Right Kidney. At the concave edge of the Kidney, the Artery di- vides into three or four Branches, varying in length in different Subjects, which sometimes send Twigs to the Glandula Renalis and Tunica Adiposa of the Kidney. The Renal Branches then plunge into the Substance of the Kidney, surround its Pelvis, and afterwards ra- mify chiefly in its Cortical Substance; forming Arches with each other, but few in number, at the roots of the Papillae. Frequently, instead of one Renal Artery, there are two from the Aorta to each Kidney, or sometimes the Artery is single in one side of the Body, and double in

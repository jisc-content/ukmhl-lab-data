Part V.J OF THE BLOOD-VESSELS. 17 The Thoracic portion of the Aorta Descendens is situated on the fore and left part of the Spine, between the Layers of. the Posterior Mediastinum. Where it passes from the Thorax to the Abdomen, it goes between the long Crura of the Diaphragm, after which it descends mor^ immediately upon the fore part of the Vertebrae. The Aorta sends off Arteries which carry Blood to the different parts of the Body, from whence it is re- turned by Veins to the Inferior and Superior Venae Cavae, excepting what passes by the Coronary Vessels. The Inferior Cava is formed by the union of the two Venae Iliacae, upon the last Vertebra of the Loins, a little below the termination of the Descending Aorta, and is of great size, being about an inch in diameter. It is situated upon the fore part of the Spine, and at the right side of the Aorta, which it accompanies a considerable way through the Abdomen. Near the upper end of the Abdomen, it recedes from the Aorta, and passes behind the large Lobe of the Liver. It perforates the Diaphragm in its Tendinous part, and having entered the Pericardium, it goes immediate- ly into the Right Auricle of the Heart. The Inferior Cava receives the Blood from the Lower Extremities, from the Pelvis and Abdomen, and carries it to the Heart. The Superior Cava, formed by the union of the two great Venae Subclavian, with the addition of the Vena Azygos,â€”is situated in the upper part of the Thorax, upon the right side of, and a little more anteriorly than, vol. in. b

/ Part V.] OF THE BLOOD-VESSELS. 9 partly owing to their being fixed down at their Extre- mities. Several of the large Arteries form communications with each other, termed by Anatomists Anastomoses : but the Anastomoses are more frequent among the small Branches, where they form a Plexus, which les- sens the danger of obstruction. In some parts two Arteries unite into a Trunk; in others, they form an Arch, from the convex side of which other Arteries are sent off; and this may be re- peated several times, the Arches and Arteries gradual- ly becoming more diminutive in their size. The Anastomoses are more frequent in the Skin and Membranous Parts. In the solid Viscera, the Arteries run in a different manner, being in some crowded toge- ther in the form of Trees or Bushes, in others having a serpentine appearance, and in several forming Peni- cilli, according to the disposition of the part. The Arteries obtain their particular names from their situations, place of destination, &c.; and the term Capillary, as expressive of their smallness, is applied to their minutest Branches. The Diameters of the different Trunks and Branches of the Arteries vary much in different parts of the Body; but those of the Capillaries are more nearly equal to each other. The following is the manner in which the Arteries of the Body terminate, viz. In Red Veins, as is observed by the assistance of a Microscope, and by Injections : In Glands or Follicles, by Secretory Ducts, which

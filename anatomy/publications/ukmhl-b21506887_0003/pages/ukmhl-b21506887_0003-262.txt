230 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part VII. The Second Nerve is connected by two or more Branches with the First, and sends some Twigs to the Axillary Glands ; but is chiefly distributed upon the Integuments of the back part of the Arm, which it sup- plies with many Branches,â€”some of them extending as far as the Elbow. NERVES WITHIN THE THORAX. The Neeves, in each side of the Thorax, consist of the Phrenic, the Pars Vaga of the Eighth Pair, the Great Sympathetic, and the Intercostals ; all of which are concealed by the Pleura, till they are exposed by Dissection. Nervus Phrenicus. The Phrenic, or Diaphragmatic Nerve, has a small Filament from the Second Cervical; but is chief- ly formed by a Branch from the Third, and by one, and sometimes by two, from the Fourth Cervical Nerve.

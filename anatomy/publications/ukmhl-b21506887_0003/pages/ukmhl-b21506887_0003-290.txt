258 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Pakt VII. Branches, which supply the Muscles and Integuments of the outer and fore part of the Leg. The Superficial Fibular crosses over the Fibula, im- mediately under its Articulation, and, perforating the Peroneus Longus, and going over the Brevis, it gives Branches to both, and afterwards becomes Subcutane- ous, about the middle of the outer part of the Leg. It sends Branches to the Metatarsus, and to the Extensor Digitorum Brevis ; and others, which, after anastomosing upon the upper part of the Foot, fur- nish Dorsal Branches to the larger Toes. The Deep Fibular Nerve crosses over the Fibula, immediately above the former, and divides into seve- ral Branches, viz. A Reflected Branch to the soft parts of the Joint: A Branch to the Peroneus Longus: A Branch to the Tibialis Anticus: Branches to the Extensor Pollicis, and Extensor Digitorum Longus: Filaments which creep along the Periosteum of the Tibia, and others which adhere to the Coats of the Tibial Artery. The longest Branch of the Nerve accompanies the anterior Tibial Artery, and divides upon the Foot into Branches, which have some connexion with each other, and supply the Extensor Digitorum Brevis.â€”Some Filaments continued from these Branches run to the Interossei, while others of more considerable size go to some of the innermost Toes; one Twig sinking, with a Branch of the Anterior Tibial Artery, to the Deep Muscles of the Sole.

28 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part V. Cells,—a larger Branch to the Septum Narium,—a conspicuous Branch passing through the Spongy Bones to the bottom of the Nose, furnishing Twigs to the Membrana Schneideriana and Antrum Maxillare, and communicating with the Palato-maxillary Branch, which passes through the Foramen Incisivum. Arteria Temporalis. The Trunk of the External Carotid, having given off the Arteries already mentioned, emerges from the Substance of the Parotid Gland, then passes up be- tween the Meatus Auditorius Externus, and root of the Zygoma, to form the Temporal Artery, named also Temporalis Externa vel Superficial!s. From the root of this Artery are sent off several Brandies, of unequal size, to the Parotid Gland : It next sends off, The Transversalis Faciei, which arises nearly oppo- site to the Internal Maxillary, and proceeds trans- versely under the Zygoma, over the Masseter, and near the Parotid Duct. After giving Branches to the Parotid Gland, the Transversalis supplies a large por- tion of the Cheek, communicating with the Facial and Internal Maxillary Arteries. The Articular Artery, which sends Branches to the Articulation of the Jaw, the External Meatus and Mem- brana Tympani, and penetrates through the Glenoid Fissure, as far as the Inner Ear, communicating with the Arteria Stylo-mastoidea. The Deep Temporal, Branch, which arises behind the Condyle of the Jaw. This penetrates the Aponeuro- sis of the Temporal Muscle, and ascends obliquely foi% wards to- the outer part of the Orbit;

The PalatinaDescendens, orPalato-ma&illari/~Branch, which passes through the Foramen Palatinum Poste- rius, and runs between the Osseous and Fleshy parts of the Palate, supplying these with Branches, and com- municating with the Palatina Inferior, and frequent- ly proceeding through the Foramen Incisivum to the inner part of the Nose : The Superior Pharyngeal, which is a small Branch terminating in and about the upper part of the Pha- rynx, and Base of the Cranium near it: The Large Lateral Nasal, or Spheno-palatine, which enters the Foramen Spheno-palatinum, and divides, at the upper and back part of the Nose, into many Branches, which supply the greater part of the inside of that Organ, viz. a Branch to the posterior Ethmoid

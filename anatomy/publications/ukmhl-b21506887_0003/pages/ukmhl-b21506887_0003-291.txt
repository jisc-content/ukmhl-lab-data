Part VII.] OF THE NERVES. 259 Nervus Tibialis. The Tibial Nerve passes between the Heads of the Gastrocnemius, and, perforating the origin of the So- leus, descends between it and the Flexor Digitorum Longus, upon the posterior Tibial Artery, to the un- der part of the Leg ; in which course, it sends off the following Nerves, viz. The Communicans Tibice, which accompanies the Vena Saphena Minor in the back part of the Leg, and to the outer part of the Foot. Behind the Belly of the Gastrocnemius, the Com- municans sends a Branch to be consumed in the Fat; and a little lower, it anastomoses with the communi- cating Branch of the Fibular Nerve. The under part of this Nerve is dispersed upon the Integuments of the outer Ankle and adjacent side of the Foot, some Branches passing as far as the Dorsal side of two or three of the smaller Toes : Branches to both Heads of the Gastrocnemius, to the Plantaris, and to the Soleus. Near the middle of the Leg, it sends Branches to the Tibialis Posticus, to the Flexor Digitorum, and Flexor Pollicis. One or two Cutaneous Branches, dispersed upon the Skin at the under and inner part of the Leg. Near the Ankle, a Branch which passes behind the Tendo Achillis, principally to the Integuments of the outer and back part of the Foot. r 2

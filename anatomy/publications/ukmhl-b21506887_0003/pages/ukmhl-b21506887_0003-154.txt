The Vena Profunda receives the Veins correspond- ing with the Branches of the Artery of that name, and is sometimes of a large size, being then in a great mea- sure the continuation of the Vena Poplitea,—a small Vein only in such cases accompanying the Trunk of the Femoral Artery. Besides the Vena Profunda, the Femoral Vein takes in small Veins from the External Parts of Generation, from the Inguinal Glands, and from the other superfi- cial parts of the Groin ;-—and, in particular, it receives a Branch of considerable size, which descends from the Integuments of the fore side of the Abdomen, and is often very conspicuous in cases of Ascites.

The Iliaca Externa receives into its beginning the Epigastric, and the Circumflex Vein of the Os Ilium, and sometimes the Vena Obturatrix.

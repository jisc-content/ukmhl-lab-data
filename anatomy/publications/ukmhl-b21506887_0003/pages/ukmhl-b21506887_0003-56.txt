36 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part V, through the medium of the Pia Mater, spread out up- on the flat Surface of the Hemisphere, and afterwards upon its upper part. The Ramifications form numberless Anastomoses with each other upon the Surface of the Brain, and then pass by minute Filaments into its Cortical and Medullary Substances. Besides the Anastomoses of the different Branches of this Artery on the Surface of the Hemisphere, small Branches run across the Corpus Callosum, and inosculate with those of the opposite side. Arteria Media Cerebri. The Arteria Media Cerebri,—termed also Ar- teria Sylviana, which is larger than the former,— runs outwards in a lateral direction through the Fossq, of Sylvius, to the upper part of the Brain. It gives first Filaments to the Optic Nerves, Glan- dula Pituitaria, and parts adjacent to it, and then di- vides into principal Branches ; of which one Set goes to the Anterior, and the other to the Lateral, and part of the Posterior Lobe of the Brain. From this Artery, one or two Twigs run up into the Anterior Cornu of the Lateral Ventricle, and assist in forming the Choroid Plexus of that Cavity. Upon the outer Surface of the Brain, the Branches of this Artery spread out upon the Pia Mater, accom- panying it into the Sulci. They inosculate with each other, and with those of the Anterior Cerebral Artery, and then plunge into the Substance of the Brain, where they meet with the deep Branches of that Artery.

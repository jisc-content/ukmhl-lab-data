Part V.] OF THE BLOOD-VESSELS. 47 They terminate in the different Sinuses of the Dura Mater, and generally in an oblique direction, which prevents the Blood from returning from the Sinuses into them. The Sinuses most commonly found are the following: The Superior Longitudinal Sinus, which begins at the under part of the Spine of the Frontal Bone,— runs along the upper edge of the Falx, and, becoming gradually wider, terminates upon the middle of the Occipital Bone, in the two Lateral Sinuses. It receives the Blood from the upper part of the Brain by several large Venous Trunks, which enter it oblique- ly, forwards : The Torcular Herophili, or Straight Sinus, or Fourth of the Ancients, chiefly formed by the Vena Galeni, which returns the Blood from the Choroid Plexus, Corpora Striata, Septum Lucidum, and other internal parts of the Brain. The Torcular passes back in the joining of the Falx and Tentorium, and terminates, along with the Superior Longitudinal Sinus, in the beginning of the Lateral Si- nuses : The foiferior Longitudinal Sinus, a remarkably small one, situated in the under edge of the Falx.—It receives Branches from that Membrane, and from the Corpus Callosum and parts of the Brain near it, and terminates in the beginning of the Torcular Herophili. The two Lateral Sinuses, or Second and Third Si- nuses of the Ancients, formed by the Longitudinal and Torcular Sinuses. They run at the Posterior Edge of the Tentorium along the Lateral Ridges of the Os Occipitis, as far as

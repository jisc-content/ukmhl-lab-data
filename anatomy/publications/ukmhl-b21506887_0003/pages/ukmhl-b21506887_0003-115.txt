Fart V.] OF THE BLOOD-VESSELS. 95 It descends, in a waving direction, on the Surface of the Psoas, behind the Peritoneum; the right passing obliquely over the Cava, the left behind the Colic Ar^ teries of the corresponding side, and both crossing before the Ureters, to reach the under part of the Abdomen. After this it goes over the Arteria Epigastrica, per- forates the Abdominal Rings, and runs in the Sperma- tic Cord, where it divides into Branches, which are dispersed, some upon the Epididymis, while others, larger and much convoluted, run forwards across the Surface of the Testicle, plunge into its Substance, and are distributed upon the Seminal Ducts. In the descent of the Artery, it imparts Twigs— To the Tunica Adiposa of the Kidney ; To the Peritoneum and Cellular Substance near it; To the Ureters,—which are also supplied with other Arteries from the adjacent Vessels, viz. from the Renal and Capsular Arteries, from the Aorta, Iliacse, and Vesicales;—and, To the Cremaster and Scrotum, anastomosing there with the Pudic, and with its fellow on the other side. In its descent, it communicates with Branches of the Lumbar, Mesenteric, and other adjacent Arteries. In its course through the Abdomen, it has been ob- served to be somewhat increased in size, and of a ser^ pentine direction ; which circumstance is very remark- able in some of the large Quadrupeds, as a Bull. The Vena Spermatica is much larger than its cor- responding Artery, and is furnished with Valves with- in, but more particularly without the Abdomen. It composes a Plexus which accompanies the Artery ; and about the place where it recedes from it, which is

Part V.] OF THE BLOOD-VESSELS. 117 flex Arteries, sinks deep behind the Trunk of the Fe- moralis, and, passing between the Adductor Muscles and Vastus Internus, descends near to the middle of the Thigh. In its descent, it sends off, or is divided into, prin- cipal Branches, termed Rami Per/orantes, which, after giving out small Branches to the Triceps, perforate it, to be dispersed upon the Flexors and other Muscles on the back part of the Thigh. The Perforantes come off in the following succes- sion, viz. The Perforans Prima, which arises near the Tro- chanter Minor, perforates the Triceps a little farther down, and divides into ascending and descending Branches, which supply the Muscles and Integuments in the upper and back part of the Thigh. The ascending Branches form numerous communi- cations with the Circumflex Arteries, about the root of the Trochanter Major, and anastomose with the Glutea, and, in particular, with the under end of the Sciatica. The Perforans Secunda, vel Magna, which comes off some way below the former, and is the largest of the perforating Arteries. This also perforates the Triceps. It gives Branches to the Muscles in general about the middle of the back part of the Thigh, particularly to the Adductors, Vasti, and to the Flexors of the Leg; and communicates above with Branches of the Perforans Prima, and with the two Circumflexa?. Besides these, there is one, and sometimes two other 'perforating Branches, which are greatly inferior in size to the two former, and are lost upon the Flexors at the

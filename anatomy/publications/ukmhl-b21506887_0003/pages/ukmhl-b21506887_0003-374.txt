Cut the Masseter below, and expose the insertion of the Temporalis, the origin of the Buccinator, and the Muscles of the Face continued into the Orbicularis. Lay bare the Ligament of the Lower Jaw; observe the motions of the Bone, then examine the two Cavities of the Joint. Dissect all the Muscles described from p. 181, to p. 195. After dissecting the Platysma Myoides, raise it from the Clavicle and Lower Jaw, and turn it back, to shew the Digastricus. Raise the Mylo-hyoideus from the Jaw, to lay in view the Inferior Maxillary Gland, and some Lymphatic Glands connected with it.—See Vol. II. p. 122.—Put a Wire into the Duct, and pass it into the Mouth. Then turn the Gland forwards, and attend to the course of the Lingual Branch of the Fifth Pair of Nerves, which runs near it. In dissecting the Muscles about the Throat, observe the Ligament from the Styloid Process to the Lower Jaw, and that from the same Process to the Os Hyoides. Expose the Lobes and middle Portion of the Thyroid Gland, and as much as can be seen, in this stage of the Dissection, of the Pterygoideus Internus Muscle. Dissection of the Deep Parts of the Mouth, Nose, and Throat. Shew more fully the Muscles of the Lower Jaw and Os Hyoides.

Part V.] OF THE BLOOD-VESSELS. 105 vides upon the Sacro-iliac Symphysis, into a Posterior and an Anterior set of Branches, which come off either separately, or from each other; the former supplying the parts nearest the Sacrum and Ilium, the latter be- longing more immediately to those about the anterior region of the Pelvis. Posterior Branches. Ilio-Lumbaris. The Ilio-Lumbaris, vel Iliaca Interna Minor, is a small Artery arising sometimes from the end of the Hypogastric, at other times from the beginning of the Glutea. It passes outwards under the Psoas, and divides sud- denly into Branches ; one of which frequently forms a kind of Lumbalis Ima^ or fifth Lumbar Artery. The other Branches go to the Psoas and Iliacus In- ternus, communicating there with the Lumbar Arteries, and with the Branches of the Circumflex Artery of the Ilium;â€”a particular Twig, constituting an Arteria Nutritia, vel Meduttaris, of the Os Ilium. Sacile Laterales. The Sacr.e Laterales are generally two, but sometimes three, arising from the common Trunk, or the Ilio-lumbar, or frequently from the Gluteal Artery. Sometimes there is only a single Artery, which descends by the sides of the Sacral Holes, giving Branches which

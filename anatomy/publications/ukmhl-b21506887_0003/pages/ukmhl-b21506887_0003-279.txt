Fart VII.J OF THE NERVES. 247 Nervi Pudici. The Nervus Pudicus arises in two Fasciculi,—a Superior and Inferior,—which are formed by Fibrillae from all the Cords entering into the composition of the Sciatic Nerve. The Superior Fasciculus consists, more particularly, of Threads from the two Under Lumbar and two up- per Sacral Nerves;—the Inferior is composed of a small Cord from the Second, and a large one from the Third Sacral. The Fasciculi pass through the under part of the Notch of the Os Ilium, and afterwards go between the Sacro-Sciatic Ligaments, and follow the Pudic Blood- vessels, anastomosing in some places with each other by oblique Filaments. They send many Branches to the Muscles and other parts about the Anus and Perinoeum, and then pass forwards to supply the different parts of the Penis. On the Penis, the Nerves follow the course of the Arteries; the Superior Fasciculus constituting the Nervus Dorsalis, and the Inferior giving Branches to the under part of this Organ. The Nervus Dorsalis, which is the most consider- able Nerve of the Penis, runs forwards between the cor- responding Artery and the Vena Magna, expanding into many Branches, which, after supplying the Cor- pus Cavernosum and Teguments of the corresponding side, terminate in the Substance of the Glans.

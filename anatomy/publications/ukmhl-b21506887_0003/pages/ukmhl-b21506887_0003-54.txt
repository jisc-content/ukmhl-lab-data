U COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part V. which are dispersed upon the Muscles, Membranes, and Fat of the Eye ; giving Twigs also to the Sclero- tic Coat. The Ethmoidalis Anterior et Posterior, two extreme- m 7 ly small Twigs, especially the latter, which pass through the Foramina Orbitaria Interna,—Anterius et Poste- riusy—to the Bones and Membranes of the Nose, par- ticularly to the Frontal, Ethmoid, and Sphenoid Sinus- es, where they communicate with the Nasal Branches of the Internal Maxillary Artery. The Supra-Orbitalis, vel Frontalis, which, after giv- ing Branches to the Muscles and Periosteum at the upper and fore part of the Orbit, and to the Lacry- mal Sac, emerges from the Socket, passes through the Foramen Supra-orbitarium, and is divided into two parts;—one dispersed upon the Periosteum of the Fore-head, the other running to the Skin and Muscles on the Fore-head, and upper Eye-lid ; and commu- nicating with the anterior Branch of the Temporal Artery. Arteries of the Brain. The Arteries of the Brain consist of the two Internal Carotids, and the two Vertebrals, all of which spread out their Branches upon the Pia Mater. Each Internal Carotid, after sending forwards the Ocular Artery, gives a number of separate Twigs to the Optic Nerve, the Glandula Pituitaria, the Infun- dibulum, and the Choroid Plexus, and sends a parti- cular Branch backwards to the Vertebral, termed Arte-

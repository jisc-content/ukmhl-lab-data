Part V.] OF THE BLOOD-VESSELS. 13 but are capable of suffering greater distension, yet are more frequently ruptured. The Anastomoses are greater and more frequent in Veins than in Arteries, to lessen the danger of being ruptured; those of the former being often by large Trunks, whereas those of the latter, excepting in a few places, are by small Branches only. Where the Veins are exposed to Muscular action, they are furnished with Valves to prevent the Blood from being interrupted in its course. These are Semi- lunar Folds continued from the inner Coat of the Ves- sels, and placed in pairs at irregular distances. They are sometimes, though seldom, found single. The Valves are concave towards the heart, and, when closely applied to each other, by the force of the Blood against them, represent a figure somewhat like that of the shut end of a Thimble. Between the Valves and sides of the Veins next the Heart, the Blood insinuates itself; and Cavities are formed, termed Sinuses of the Valves, which appear externally in the form of Varices. The Valves are generally found in the Fleshy parts of the Body, but are chiefly situated in the Veins of the Extremities. They are wanting in the Veins of the Deep-seated Viscera, viz. in those of the Brain and Spinal Marrow, in those of the Lungs, in the System of the Vena Por- tse, and in those of the Kidneys, Bladder, and Uterus. They exist, however, in the Spermatic, and sometimes in the Internal Mammary Veins, and in the Branches of the Vena Azygos. The Valves direct the Blood towards the Heart, and

9 DUPLICITY. of a pelvis, with total deficiency of an axis, and of two posterior limbs fused together above as far as the middle of the femora by the skin and soft parts. Hunterian. 46. A Chick with the imperfect wings and legs of a second Chick attached to the abdominal integuments. Hunterian. Subclass IV. Heterologous union. 47. A Duckling with the remains of a second embryo adhering in the superior fontanelle, which has not been closed. It consists of a kind of atheromatous tumour, partially oc- cupied by a hernia of the Duckling's brain, with a small but well-developed leg and foot growing from it. Hunterian. 48. A Pigeon with a small accessory wing growing from the lower part of the sternum. There is no other trace of a second embryo, and the skin has been reflected to show the union of the limb by muscles and ligament with the sternum. Hunterian. Comparing this specimen with No. 47, and in the complete ab- sence of any other means of accounting for the condition, it has been placed in this series, as it seems probable that the limb may- be the remains of a second embryo. (See also No. 23.) Subseries VI. In Mammals. Subclass I. Dichotomy. A. Anterior Dichotomy. * In Animals. Anterior dichotomy in Mammals rarely extends further back than the basioccipital bone; it occasionally, however, reaches the dorsal vertebra;. In this respect Mammals present a marked contrast to Birds and Reptiles, in which it usually involves some of the vertebrae at least. It is very rare in the human subject.

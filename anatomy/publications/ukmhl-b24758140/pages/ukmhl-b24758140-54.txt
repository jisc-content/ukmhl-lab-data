ABNORMAL CONDITIONS OF THE AXIS. 20 except that the two faces are not perfectly symmetrical, the mouth of one being a small circular opening. Mus. Brit. 97. Twin foetal Hares united by the anterior extremities of the axes. The anterior portion of each axis has been arrested in development, so that the faces exhibit the characters of epencephalic deficiency, cyclopia, agnathia, fusion of the ears, &c. Presented by Sir W. Blizard, 1811. 98. Twin foetal Hares in a similar condition. There is a frontal proboscis on one face. B. Opisthozygosis*. Syn. Hypogastrodidynms, Gurlt. Ischiopagus, Geoff. In Opisthozygosis two distinct axes are united at their posterior extremities, or at some point near their posterior extremities. The embryos remain completely separate above the umbilicus, but unite below by the visceral laminae. One foetus is generally very defective. Sometimes the axes are bent at right angles,in opposite directions, at the point of union. Opisthozygosis is very rare in animals, and the pelvic bones and posterior limbs only of the second axis are usually developed in them, as in No. 103. A similar condition in birds is seen in Nos. 45 and 46. 99. Human female twins united by opisthozygosis about the sixth month of gestation. The viscera had been re- moved and the spinal columns and pelvis much damaged by a hasty examination. The viscera were fortunately preserved, and are seen in No. 100. The sacrum of one side only has been developed. It is situated at right angles to the two spinal columns, which are placed end to end, the bodies of the vertebras being united without any perceptible break. The sacrum is entirely cartilaginous, no traces of the second sacrum exist. The pelves are otherwise perfect; but the right in- nominate bone of one foetus is united with the left in- nominate bone of the other, and vice versd. The ilia are united to the lumbar vertebrae by elongated transverse * "QmoQev behind, fvydw to unite.

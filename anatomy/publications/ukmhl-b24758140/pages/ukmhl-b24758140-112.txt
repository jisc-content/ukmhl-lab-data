78 ABNORMAL CONDITIONS OF THE LIMBS. phalanges fused into a single hone. This condition pro- bably arises from imperfect differentiation of the digits and persistence of the primitive connecting web in which they are formed. Presented by Sir W. Blizard. 324. The other manns of the same animal; the functional digits are included in a single hoof. Presented by Sir W. Blizard. 325. A precisely similar specimen. Presented by Sir E. Home, Bart. 326. A similar specimen in which the digits are included in a single narrow pointed hoof. Hunterian. b. Perodactylus. Syn. Ectrodactylie, Geoff. This condition exhibits arrest accompanied by atrophy. 327. The hands of a full-time Human foetus. The right is pre- pared as a skeleton. The thumb of the left hand is represented by an imperfect terminal joint only; this adheres to the hand by a narrow pedicle of integument. In the right hand the thumb is entirely wanting, and the fifth digit is adherent to the metacarpal bone of the fourth. The union is ligamentous, and the base of the fifth meta- carpal bone has been entirely absorbed. The process of atrophy seen in progress in these digits is precisely similar to that which affects supernumerary digits. In these the phenomenon is observed far more commonly than in the normal parts. Presented by R. Partridge, Esq. B. Of the Limbs, a. Ischnomelia. Where the limb is preternaturally slender, some of the bones are frequently absent; the digits are often arrested at an early stage of development. There is usually arrest of other parts ac- companying this condition. A patagium very rarely remains in arrested conditions of the limbs. See No. 329*. * See also Gurlt, Path.

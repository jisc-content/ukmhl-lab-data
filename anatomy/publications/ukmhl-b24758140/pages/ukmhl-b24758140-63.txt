29 DUPLICITY. the glenoid cavity is articulated with the clavicles. The cartilage already mentioned, situated between the clavicles and glenoid cavity, is the only rndiment representing the anterior median limbs. 121. The viscera of the same; these are double, hut those of the right foetus are considerably smaller than those of the left j the latter are reversed. The hearts were situ- ated in distinct pericardia. The heart of the left is three times the size of that of the right foetus. The latter gives off a small aorta, which joins the descending aorta of the left foetus just below its arch. The livers are in- timately united; the oesophagi, stomachs, and duodena are distinct as far as the orifice of the bile-duct, where the intestines unite in a sacculate dilatation; below this point the intestine is single but reversed, the csecum being on the left side. d. Ischiopagus, Porster. Syn. Pygodidymus, Gfurlt. Pygopagus, Geoff. In Ischiopagus the twins are united by the lower extremity of the axis only, and are placed back to back, so that the visceral cavities are distinct. Judith and Helena, " The Hungarian Sis- ters" (Phil.Trans.vol.50,p.311), and Millie-Christine,the "Two- Headed Nightingale," exhibited in London in 1871 (Lancet, 1871, i. p. 725), are examples. No specimen occurs in the Museum.' 122. A wooden model representing two ischiopagous infants. The anus is represented as single, and the vaginae are united at their posterior commissures,â€”the usual disposition of these parts in such malformations. Subclass III. Homologous union with dichotomy. The so-called triplex human foetus described in the ' Atti dell' Accadem. Gioen.' t. viii. p. 203, is undoubtedly an example of pleuropagus combined with anterior dichotomy of one axis. Several cases are recorded by Gurlt as having occurred in animals.

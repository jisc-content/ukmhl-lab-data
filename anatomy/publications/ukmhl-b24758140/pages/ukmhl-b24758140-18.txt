INTRODUCTION. xiv 5. Variations in the disposition of the blood-vessels, and especially of the large trunks given off from the aorta. Class II. Duplicity. This Class contains a vast number of very remarkable conditions, at first sight extremely dissimilar, but clearly, on closer study, intimately related in their mode of origin. The forms included in this Class have been divided into three Subclasses:— Subclass I. Dichotomy. II. Homologous union. » III. Heterologous union. I. Dichotomy, or fission as it is frequently called, con- sists in the formation of two growing points in the place of one, in such a manner as to produce a dichotomously divided embryo or part, each half of the doubled portion being complete in itself. This process occurs normally in the production of a branching axis in plants, and is not un- frequent in the multiplication of Ccelenterates, in the division of Coral-polypes and certain branched Hydrozoa. The use of the term fission to designate this condition is unfortunate, as it implies the division of an already formed part; whilst Dichotomy in both animals and plants, either normal or abnormal, as has been carefully pointed out by Dr. Maxwell T. Masters in his ' Vegetable Teratology,' consists in the simultaneous production of two points of growth. Fission amongst coral-polypes is of this kind, a fact strongly insisted on by Milne-Edwards. The term has, indeed, been used to designate a totally distinct phenomenon in the Infusoria, where an already formed organism undergoes division. Dichotomy may probably arise from a cleavage of the original cells, out of which a part is developed; but we know nothing certainly on this point.

75 VARIATION, EXCESS OF GROWTH. a very rudimentary accessory fifth finger, attached by ligament only to the metacarpal bone. It has neither tendons nor muscles. 1 Presented by R. Partridge, Esq., 1864. 310. The right foot of the same Infant, with a supernumerary outer toe. The specimen is dissected. The fifth and supernumerary toes are equal in size; both are articulated with a very broad metatarsal bone. The fourth tendon of the flexor longus digitorum splits into two equal parts ; one portion is inserted into the accessory toe. The ad- ditional toe also receives a distinct slip from the tendon of the peronseus tertius. The other foot was normal. Presented by R. Partridge, Esq., 1864. 311. The bones of a Human thumb with dichotomy of the ter- minal phalanges. The accessory and normal bones are symmetrically developed, apparently right and left. Presented by Dr. Thumam, 1872. 312. The skeleton of the left foot of an adult Human female, with a supernumerary fourth toe, resembling that of the right foot, between the outer and fourth digits. The ad- ditional toe has a distinct but imperfect metatarsal bone, which is attached to the outer side of the fourth, and wedged between it and the fifth metatarsal bone. There is a cup-shaped cavity at the base of the fifth metatarsal bone, which lodges the base of the accessory bone. Presented by Erasmus Wilson, Esq., 1869. 313. A portion of a Human foot which had six toes. The great toe has been removed. The three outer toes are enclosed in a common integument to their extremities. Hunterian. Class II. Duplicity.

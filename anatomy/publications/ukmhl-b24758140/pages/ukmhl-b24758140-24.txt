INTRODUCTION. Class V. Arrest or Development. The most numerous and complicated groups of abnormal conditions are included in this Class; but as it is extremely comprehensive and well defined, and as two or more forms of arrest are sometimes united in a single malformation, it is extremely doubtful whether any good would arise in the substitution of several Classes in its place, at least with our present knowledge of the subject. The various forms of arrest may be epitomized in the following manner:â€” I. The normal evolution of an embryonic structure may fail, although its growth continues, so that an enlarge- ment of the embryonic condition results. It occurs in the external generative organs of the female, giving rise to a similarity to the male. The condition has the appearance of excessive development, but it is clearly due to the absence of the usual developmental change. Doubling of the female uterus by a septum, and the growth of the Mullerian duct and genital cord into an enormous organ in the male, are examples of this phenomenon. Some of the various kinds of atresia may probably be of a similar character. II. The second form of arrest of development is apparently due to an early arrest of growth in the lateral halves of such organs as are formed by the union of two symmetrical halves 5 in extreme cases there is usually great accompany- ing defect of development in the lateral parts. Persist- ence of a cleft only, inasmuch as it is the persistence of an earlier condition, is an arrest of development. Fissure of the sternum, abdominal wall, palate, iris, &c. are of this kind, as are also the states known as ectopia vesicas, epi- spadias, and hypospadias. III. The third form also arises from, or is at least accom- panied by, arrest of growth and atrophy, so that an organ or part may be rudimentary, minute, or entirely absent. When median structures fail in this way in the axis of the body, the lateral parts coalesce at too early a period and

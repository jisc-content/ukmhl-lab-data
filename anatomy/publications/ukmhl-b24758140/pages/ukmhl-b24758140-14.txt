X INTRODUCTION. Series V. Abnormal conditions of the Osseous and Mus- cular Systems*. VI. Abnormal conditions of the Sensory Organs. VII. Abnormal conditions of the Heart and Vessels. VIII. Abnormal conditions of Blood-glands. IX. Abnormal conditions of the Digestive Organs. X. Abnormal conditions of the Urinary and Genera- tive Organs. XI. Abnormal conditions of the Oviduct and Ova of Birds f. There are many practical reasons why the malformations of each set of organs should be arranged in a separate Series; it facilitates comparison and reference, and is in accordance with the general plan of arrangement of other parts of this Museum. The following considerations on the character and extent of each of the six Classes which have been adopted may be most conveniently discussed in the present portion of this work. Class I. Variation. Syn. Hemiteries, Geoff. The term variety is used by naturalists to designate the result of gradually accumulated individual differences, which are themselves slight variations. Some variations are, from their very nature, of a more marked character than ordinary * Abnormal conditions of the osseous and muscular systems are so intimately connected with each other that they have been arranged in a single Series. t This Series consists of preparations of eggs which are evidently the result of abnormal conditions or functional derangement of the oviduct, and which throw little1 or no light upon the more remarkable deviations which occur in the other Series. It may be looked upon as supple- mental to Series X., and it has therefore been placed last in the col- lection. Specimens of abnormal condition of the oviduct have also been arranged in this series, although, in strict conformity with the general plan of the Catalogue, they should have been placed in Series X. : this has been done because they elucidate, in some instances, the condition of the eggs.

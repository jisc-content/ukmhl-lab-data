94 ABNORMAL CONDITIONS OF THE URINARY ORGANS. 409. The fellow kidney to the last. The ureters are united closer to the gland than in the preceding preparation. Presented by Sir W. Blizard. 410. A double Human kidney and a portion of the urinary bladder. There are four ureters, two to each kidney. The left kidney has not been preserved. 411. A section of a very large Human kidney. The pelvis and ureter are double; they are injected. Hunterian. 412. A section of a similar kidney. Hunterian. 413. The lower part of a Human urinary bladder with four per- fectly distinct ureters. The orifices of the ureters and seminal ducts are marked by bristles. Mus. Heaviside. 414. A similar preparation from the same subject as Nos. 411 and 412. Hunterian. 415. A similar preparation, in which only one lateral half of the bladder has been preserved. Hunterian. 416. A pair of kidneys from a Human adult, with partial doubling of both glands and of their pelves. The glands are united by their lower margins. A portion of the aorta is preserved, and a second set of renal arteries are seen about 2\ inches below the normal vessels. 417. The kidneys of an adult Human subject with partial doubling of both glands, including their pelves. The lower edges of the glands have coalesced across the mesial line. 418. The lower half of the trunk of a Human foetus with large partially double kidneys united by their lower edges across the mesial line. There is an additional renal artery on the right side only. Presented by Sir W. Blizard. Class V'. Aeeest of Development. A. Of the Kidney. 419. The kidneys of an encephalous full-time (?) foetus slightly arrested in their development. The lobuli are somewhat more distinct than in the normal kidneys of a seven months' foetus.

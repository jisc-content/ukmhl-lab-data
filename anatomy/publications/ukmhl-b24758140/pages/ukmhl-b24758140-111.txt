77 ARREST OF DEVELOPMENT. 319. A Human female foetus with shortening of all four extre- mities. There is a considerable abnormal deposit of sub- cutaneous fat. The child was still-born at the eighth month of pregnancy. Presented by William Lyon, Esq., 1825. 320. A female Human foetus with arrest of growth in the pelvic girdle and all fcmr extremities. The left inferior ex- tremity has been dissected. The muscles of the toes and the gastrocnemius arise from the femur immediately below the insertion of the psoas and gluteus maximus. A constriction may be seen around the right thumb, which is obviously in the first stage of so-called intra-uterine amputation. Presented by Sir S. Hammick. 321. The skeleton of a full-time hydrocephalic foetus, with ex- treme shortening of the limbs. All the bones are well ossified except the sternum; its cartilaginous condition is an indication of arrested development. The shrivelling of the cartilaginous epiphyses has much increased the deformity of this preparation. Presented by R. Liston, Esq. 322. The skeleton of a similar foetus with the great arteries injected and preserved. The urinary bladder is also attached to the pelvis. Class V. Arrest of Development. Arrest of development is occasionally uncomplicated, as in aschistodactylus, or webbing of the digits. It is more commonly accompanied by atrophy, which is sometimes so complete that no trace of the part remains. So-called intra-uterine amputations apparently always arise from atrophy. Sometimes a single bone is undeveloped, probably from early arrest and atrophy. A. Of the Digits. a. Aschistodactylus, Gurlt. Syn. Syndactylus, Geoff. 323. The skeleton of the manus of a Pig, with the second pha- langes of the functional digits adherent, and their third

ABNORMAL CONDITIONS OF THE LIMBS. 70 immensely enlarged posterior fontanelle. The exoc- cipitals are very large and perforated by a considerable foramen. The spinal canal is open, the laminae and spines being spread out on either side; several are an- kylosed together, as are also the three upper ribs of the right side. The bodies of the cervical vertebrae exhibit two lateral centres of ossification, a condition very constantly met with in conjunction with other forms of abnormal development.

Presented by T. M. Donohoo, Esq., 1862. 292. A female Human anencephalous foetus with ectopia of the viscera. The sac containing the protruded intestine has been laid open; a large portion of the placenta is seen ad- hering to the sac. These two preparations are interesting, as they show an extremely frequent complication of these conditions. On a priori grounds it would appear extremely likely that the placenta would become adherent to an open membranous surface like the peritoneum, arachnoid, or pia mater, or to the edge of an ulcerating surface like that exhibited by No. 282. It is not a little remarkable that so many have considered such adhesion as the cause of the malfor- mation, as it is far more probably an effect, or an accidental com- plication extremely prone to occur.

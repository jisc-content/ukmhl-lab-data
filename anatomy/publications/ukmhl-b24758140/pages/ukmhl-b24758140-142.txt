108 ABNORMAL CONDITIONS OF TIIE OVA OF BIRDS. the peritoneal cavity. It appears that as each yelk was matured it fell into the abdomen, and was ultimately absorbed, whilst the oviduct poured out albumen and formed a shell, as it would if tho yelk had passed into its tube. The Hen, when killed, was ap- parently perfectly healthy. Specimens of the eggs are preserved in No. 467. Purchased, 1871. B. Of the Ova. a. Twin Eggs. In these two yelks or two perfect Chicks are enclosed in a single shell. Double-yelked eggs seldom produce two Chicks. Twin Chicks are probably produced from single-yelked eggs. For further remarks on these conditions see page xix. 457. The egg of a domestic Fowl with two yelks. The shell is well formed, and the egg is larger than the normal size. A portion has been cut away to show the interior. Hunterian. 458. A similar specimen. Hunterian. 459. The egg of a domestic Fowl containing one Chick. A twin Chick escaped from the egg; both birds were then alive. The one now in the egg, however, died immediately. Presented byW. D. Oliver, Esq. 460. The egg of a Fowl containing two distinct and perfect Chicks. The alantois and yelk appear to have been single. b. Of the coverings of the yelk. Inflammation of the oviduct gives rise to deficiency of the cal- careous covering of the egg, and to a fibrinous condition of the albumen. In some cases, from causes at present unknown, the shell-membrane is the seat of calcareous deposit. 461. The shells of three eggs, in which the shell-membrane is the seat of calcareous deposit. 462. The shell of a Hen's egg, in which the small pole of the albumen was prolonged into a short spiral and covered with shell. It is probable that this specimen is due to disease in a minor degree, similar to that which produced the following abnormal eggs. Presented by Dr. F. R. Fairbank.

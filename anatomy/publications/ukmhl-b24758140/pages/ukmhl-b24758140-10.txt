INTRODUCTION. VI present we possess no such knowledge as this; but what is known affords sufficient data for a physiological classifica- tion, which, if not entirely satisfactory, nevertheless ap- proximates sufficiently nearly to a satisfactory arrangement to fulfil the objects of classification to a very considerable extent. Although the causes producing malformations are themselves hidden in the deepest obscurity, their effects are sufficiently definite to admit of a very clear diagnosis and arrangement, whenever the first deviation of structure can be perceived and studied apart from the various modifi- cations which succeed and depend upon it. The primary deviation from the normal type may be looked upon as the immediate cause of the malformation. All the successive changes and aberrations which depend upon it bear a distinct morphological relation to each other and to the primary deviation. Hence when malformations belong to the same group (that is, when the primary de- viations are the same), they bear a distinct morphological relation to each other and admit of a morphological classi- fication. From these considerations it is evident that malforma- tions due to the same cause affecting morphologically similar parts may be arranged in groups, the members of which are morphologically related, although the groups themselves can only be arranged in classes by a knowledge of the physiological relation which they bear to each other. Such an arrangement is possible in many cases, because analogy leads to the belief that the causes determining the occur- rence of the malformations included in these groups are similar. In some the first deviations from the normal type are clearly of the same nature, or due to identical or nearly identical causes; we are then able to class the re- sulting forms with certainty in one class ; but a number occur in which the primary deviation is too obscure to admit of this. Hence Bischoff argued that no satisfactory classi- fication could be drawn from any but purely anatomical grounds, and many authors have followed this principle

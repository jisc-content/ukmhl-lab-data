89 ARREST OE DEVELOPMENT. 38G. A small Human heart, with a semilunar opening at the upper part of the ventricular septum. The pulmonary- artery has not half its normal calibre. The left auricle and the left auricular ventricular opening are much con- tracted. The mitral valves are very imperfect. The right auricle is enormously dilated, its walls being en- tirely membranous in places. The condition of the pulmonary artery and the dilated right auricle point to an imperfect condition of the lungs, with corresponding venous congestion. Unfortunately no history has been preserved. 387. A Human foetal heart, with the position of its great vessels reversed (situs mutatus). There is no trace of a ventri- cular septum. There is but one auriculo-ventricular opening, with five valves around its margin. There is one large auricle with a small pouch on its right side; this pouch has an auricular appendix, and obviously re- presents the systemic auricle. The larger left auricle is pulmonary; but it also receives the superior and inferior cava. d. Of an artery (stenosis). Is usually accompanied by other abnormal conditions. See No. 386, where there is partial stenosis of the pulmonary artery. e. Premature closure of ilie ductus arteriosus or foramen ovale. This sometimes occurs. It may either be looked upon, like stenosis of the arteries, as a form of arrest, or it may result from disease or from some other malformation. f. Of a valve. Occasionally one of the flaps of the arterial or auriculo- ventricular valve is arrested and remains rudimentary. This coudition is usually accompanied by disease of the valves, warty growths on the endocardium, or even pericarditis. It is pro- bably the result of congenital disease. 388. A portion of the heart of a Boy ten years of age with two of the aortic valve-flaps united into a single flap. The

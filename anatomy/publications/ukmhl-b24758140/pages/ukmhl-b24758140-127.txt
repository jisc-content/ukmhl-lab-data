ABNORMAL CONDITIONS OE THE URINARY AND GENERATIVE ORGANS. Class II. Duplicity*. Subclass I. Dichotomy. Dichotomy affecting the kidney to a greater or less extent occurs comparatively frequently.

The most marked condition of dichotomy exhibits two distinct ureters opening separately into the bladder; the kidney has then the appearance of two kidneys fused together. The opposite sides of the body are commonly affected symmetrically, and sometimes the double kidneys of opposite sides extend across the mesial line, and are fused together by their lower edges. a.

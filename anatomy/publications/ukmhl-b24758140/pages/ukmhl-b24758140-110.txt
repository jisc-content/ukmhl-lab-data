76 ABNORMAL CONDITIONS OF THE LIMBS. Class IV. Arrest op Growth. Although arrest of growth and arrest of development affecting the limbs very frequently occur together, and one is either the result or cause of the other, yet there are certain forms of arrest of growth giving rise to great shortening of the limbs, brachy- melia, which are not accompanied by any obvious arrest of de- velopment. In brachymelia the bones are usually exceedingly well ossified, but there is frequently deformity from irregular contraction of the muscles, as well as great hypertrophy of the subcutaneous tissue. Arrested growth is sometimes confined to the digits, and is more frequent in the forearm and leg than in the arm and thigh. When the whole of the lower limbs is affected, the pelvic girdle is also usually of small size. Arrest of the forearm or leg gives rise to considerable modification in the arrangements of the muscles; the flexors and extensors of the digits in these cases usually arise from the shaft of the hu- merus or femur. A. In the Digits. 315. The left hind foot of a Pig in which the third digit is shortened by arrest of growth. It is worthy of remark that in the Solidungula this is the only functional digit. Hunterian. 316. The other hind foot of the same animal with more con- siderable defect of the corresponding toe. Hunterian. 317. The left hand of a Human infant at birth with considerable shortening of the fingers. The ungual phalanges and the nails are much smaller than is normal. The thumb is short and thick, but its terminal phalanx is not abnor- mally defective. The mother had a similar malformation. Presented by R. Partridge, Esq., 1868. B. In the Limbs. Syn. Nanomelus, Ourlt. Phocomele, Geoff. 318. A foetal bitch Puppy with extreme shortening of all four extremities and arrest of growth in the posterior portion of the trunk. Hunterian.

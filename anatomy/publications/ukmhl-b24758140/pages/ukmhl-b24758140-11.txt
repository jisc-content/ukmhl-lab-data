PATHOLOGY AND TERATOLOGY. Vll strictly; every day, however, the difficulties of a physio- logical classification will become less, and it may confi- dently be predicted that in a few years this subject will emerge from the darkness in which it has hitherto been involved. Pathology has for its domain the consideration of the abnormal conditions of nutrition which occur in living bodies. Every disease maybe looked upon as an abnormal condition of nutrition, using that term in its widest sense, whether the deviation be structural or apparently only functional. Teratology has for its domain the consideration of abnormal conditions of development. In so far as the function of development is separable from the functions of maintenance and repair, Teratology is separable from Pa- thology ; but there are a large number of intermediate conditions in which it is impossible to distinguish between aberrations of nutrition and of development. Again, there are various abnormal conditions of growth which may be considered to belong to either class of phenomena. Hence, by common consent, all the diseases peculiar to intra-uterine life, together with certain abnormal congenital conditions of growth, producing dwarfs and giants, have been assigned to the Teratologist. As we know that all the functions and parts of the living body are prone to vary within certain limits, so we are justified in believing that the process of development is liable to a certain amount of variation. In some few cases it can be shown that slight variations may occur in differ- ent stages of the developmental process. Thus the occur- rence of transposition, or situs mutatus, of the non-symme- trical viscera is not very unfrequent; and we owe to Von Baer the following interesting theoretical explanation of its occurrence:â€” " The embryo of a bird during the first thirty-six hours lies with its abdominal surface downwards ; but in the course of the third day of incubation in the egg of the

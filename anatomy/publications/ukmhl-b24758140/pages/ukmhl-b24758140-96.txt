62 ABNORMAL CONDITIONS OF THE AXIS. The innominate bones are united in front, but are widely sepa- rated behind; there is no trace of a sacrum. The femora are arti- culated with the pelvis by imperfect joints. The limbs are fairly developed, but the outer toes have been arrested in their growth. Presented by Dr. Huggins, 1866. 246. The intestine of the same. It is blind at either extremity, and forms a large much convoluted mass. Presented by Dr. Huggins. Subclass IV. Defective closure of the thoracic and abdominal cavities. This condition sometimes arises from simple arrest of develop- ment ; the abdominal cavity, however, remains open more often as a result of some other malformation, especially curvature of the spine, the union of twins, or displacement of the abdominal viscera. A portion of the diaphragm is occasionally wanting. a. 'Fissure of the sternum (ectopia of the heart). Slight fissure of the sternum may exist without displacement of the heart; in the gravest forms there is complete ectopia of that organ. 247. The sternum of a Goose with deficiency of the median ossification. The carina is completely absent, its place being occupied by a fissure. 248. A foetal Pig with deficiency of the anterior thoracic and abdominal walls. The heart and peritoneal sac protrude from the cleft. The anterior membranous investment has been removed. Hunterian. b. Ectopia of the abdominal viscera. Syn. Schistocomus, Gurlt. Cases of ectopia are most usually accompanied by other mal- formations; hence several are arranged in other parts of the Collection. See Nos. 262, 263, 283, 292. 249. A female Human foetus at about the seventh month, with the greater part of the intestine protruding above the umbilicus. The walls of the sac which contained this intestine have been removed. Presented by W. Harris, Esq.

47 ARREST OF DEVELOPMENT. into a single foramen. The mandible projects consider- ably in front of the united maxillse. Presented by W. R. Gilbert, Esq. 180. The brain of the same. The anterior cerebral lobes arc completely fused together. Behind the cerebrum is a large triangular space, corresponding to the third and lateral ventricles; the fornix is seen crossing this space. The corpus callosum is completely absent. Presented by TV. R. Gilbert, Esq. 181. The skull of a similar foetal Lamb. The mandible projects more than in No. 179. 182. The skull of a foetal Horse, with a large median orbit. The axis is entirely wanting in front of the basioccipital. There are traces of a vomer between the solid pterygoid, palatine, and maxillary bones, but there is no trace of a nasal cavity. The mandible projects an inch and a half beyond the maxilla. The cranial cavity is much con- tracted, and probably only contained a cerebellum. 183. A foetal Kitten with complete fusion of the eyes. Hunterian. 184. A similar Kitten, with the thoracic and abdominal cavities laid open, to show the perfect condition of the internal organs. Hunterian. 185. The head of an hydrocephalic foetal Pig, with deficiency of the facial axis and fusion of the eyes into a single globe. The vertex is occupied by a very large cyst. Hunterian. 18G. A Human foetus with similar deficiency of the cranio-facial axis and complete fusion of the eyes. The cerebro-spinal canal has been laid open. The whole cavity has evidently been occupied by a large water-cyst. The head is doubled back on the contorted spinal column, so that its axis is almost parallel with that of the vertebral column. There is complete deficiency of the occipital region and extreme spinal bifida. The preparation should be compared with Nos. 278, 279. c. Anopia. In the following preparations the deficiency extends still fur- ther back ; the trabecular arch is entirely wanting ; and the eyes arc rudimentary or absent, although the orbit remains.

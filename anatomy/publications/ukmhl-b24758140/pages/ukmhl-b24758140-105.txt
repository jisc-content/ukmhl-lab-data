VARIATION. 71 II. In Vertebrates. Class I. Variation. A. In the number of Digits. The number of digits is frequently in excess of the normal number, polydactylism : more rarely fewer are developed; such specimens have been arranged under the fourth and fifth Classes. a. Polydactylus. Syn. Perissodactylus, Megalomelus perissodactylus, Gurlt. Several distinct conditions have been arranged under this head*. It has, however, been thought wiser to attempt no division until a much larger collection of specimens can be obtained. Some of these conditions are admitted varieties; such are the accessory toes of the St. Bernard dog and Dorking fowl: others are probably the effect of fission or dichotomy, either of a single digit, or of several, or even of the entire limb. Some- times the accessory digits resemble adventitious buds, and the supernumerary parts not unfrequently simulate to those of the opposite limb. 294. The foot of a Fowl with the inner toe bearing an accessory digit of three phalanges, nearly resembling the second toe of the other foot, on its inner side. The middle toe has also a minute supernumerary nail growing from its last phalanx on the same side. The existence of a supernumerary toe on the inner side of the foot is characteristic of the Dorking breed, and is transmitted veiy truly. Hunterian. 295. The skeleton of the other foot of the same bird. Hunterian. 296. The left manus of a Pig, with a small accessory inner toe behind the normal one. Tins too is probably a supernumerary digit added to the nor- mal second digit, and not a thumb, a view amply confirmed by the succeeding preparations. Hunterian. 297. The left manus of a Pig with considerable enlargement of * 8ec Introduction.

ARREST OF DEVELOPMENT. 55 only bone in the cranial axis, and it ends in a point in front. 217. The anterior half of a nanocephalous foetal Kitten. The ex- ternal ears were united at the base; but the left lateral half of the head has been removed to show the head in section. A bristle marks the external opening of the alimentary and respiratory tracts. 218. A microcephalous Human foetus, in which the face is entirely wanting, its position being occupied by a pair of ill-formed ears fused together above and below, with a small rounded tnbercle between them in the place of a meatus. The skull and spinal canal have been laid open from behied. 219. A longitudinal vertical section of the anterior part of a nanocephalous foetal Lamb. The brain in front of the medulla is represented by a cyst only. The pharynx opens externally through the united tympanic bullae and external meatus. Presented by Sir W. Blizard. 220. The atlas and bones of the skull from the other lateral half of the same. The anterior part of the skull is seen to be extremely defective. The bones of the ear-capsule retain their normal position, but the tympanic and squa- mous elements were united across the mesial line in front of the defective cranial axis. Presented by Sir W. Blizard. 221. The left half of a longitudinal section of the anterior part of a nanocephalous foetal Pig. The cranial bones are very thick. The specimen is in other respects similar to the last. Hunterian. 222. The right half of the same. Hunterian. c. Acephalus. 223. A portion of the spinal column and cord of a foetal Lamb. The medulla ends in a rounded extremity. It is sur- rounded by a case, partly of membrane and partly of carti- lage, which represents the cranium : a pair of imperfect periotic capsules are imbedded in its walls. Hunterian. 224. The anterior extremity of a nanocephalous foetal Lamb. The head is represented by a pair of ears and an elongated bladder-like cyst, which projects between and above

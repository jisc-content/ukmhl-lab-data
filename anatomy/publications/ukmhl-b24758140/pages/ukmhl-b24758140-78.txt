ABNORMAL CONDITIONS OF THE AXIS. 44 The corpus callosum is almost always absent, the fornix is ab- sent or rudimentary, the cerebral lobes are usually very defec- tive and are fused in front with each other; the third and lateral ventricles, in most cases, are opened out into a large cyst, which occupies the greater part of the cranial cavity, a condition which may well induce the belief that the cause of the phenomenon is probably internal hydrocephalus at a very early period of em- bryonic life. It is certain that hydrocephalus often accompanies this condition: examples are seen in specimens Nos. 185 and 186. a. Rhinocephalus. Syn. Rhinocephalus and Cyclocephalus, Geoff. Cyclops, Ourlt. In Rhinocephalus the naso-frontal processes form a frontal proboscis. 160. A foetal Lamb's head with entire deficiency of the axis in the facial region, a solid frontal proboscis, partially fused eyes, and a pair of imperfect nostrils between the maxillae. The roof of the skull has been removed to show the com- plete absence of the ethmoid bone and fusion of the optic foramina., Hunterian. 161. The brain of the same showing the fusion of the hemi- spheres in front, the absence of the corpus callosum, the open condition of the large third ventricle, and the com- plete absence of the olfactory nerves. Hunterian. 162. The head of a foetal Boar, with complete deficiency of the facial axis. The eyes are partially fused. An orifice cor- responding to the nostrils is situated at the extremity of the proboscis. Hunterian. 163. A similar preparation with the eyes more closely united. Hunterian. 164. The head of a foetal Sow, similar to the last two, but with the eyes still more closely united. Hunterian. 165. The head of a foetal Sow, in which the frontal proboscis is turned back over the forehead. The eyes are fused as far as the edges of the corneae. 166. The head of a foetal Pig with the eyes fused into a single globe. The roof of the skull has been removed to show

109 EGGS WITHOUT YELKS. 463. A Hen's egg, invested in a strong fibrous shell-membrane, but without any shell. The albumen is j^rawn out into a long twisted process at one pole of the egg. A section has been made through the albumen to show its fibrinous condition. Presented by Sir A. Carlisle, 1818. 464'. A similar specimen, in which both poles of the egg are prolonged. Presented by W. Clift, Esq., 1811. 465. Two Hen's eggs without shells, but with a thick shell- membrane, exhibiting small spots of calcareous deposit on the surface, united by a narrow pedicle. Hunterian. 466. A similar specimen. Presented by W. B. Tegetmeier, Esq., 1867. c. Pseudo-Eggs, or Eggs without yelks. 467. Pseudo-eggs laid by the Hen the oviduct and ovaries of which are preserved in preparation No. 456. The eggs consist of normal albumen enclosed in a small but well- formed shell. 468. A small, elongated, curved, pseudo-egg from a Fowl, pro- bably deformed by abnormal contractions of the oviduct. Presented by W. S. Pocklington, Esq., 1860. 469. The shell of a similar pseudo-egg. 470. The imperfectly calcified egg-shell of a similar egg. 471. Two small pseudo-eggs, formed of concentric masses of fibrinous albumen and united by a long pedicle; they are without shells. Sections have been made through them to show their structure. 472. The egg of a Bantam Hen, with two small masses of albu- men, which have descended upon it in succession, covered with shell, and united by calcific deposit to its upper extremity. d. Included Eggs or Pseudo-Eggs. Sometimes a small egg, or pseudo-egg, remains in the oviduct, or, according to Mr. Tegetmeier, is carried back from the shell- secreting into the albumen-secreting portion of the oviduct, and becomes invested with a second layer of albumen and a second shell; or it is met by and invested in a second ovum ; in this

17 DUPLICITY. The additional external ears are very defective and are fused together. Hunterian,. 84. A similar dichotomous foetal Pig. d. Schizocephalus. Syn. Iniops, Geoff. Synkephalus asymmotros, Forster. Janus-Bildung. This condition depends, apparently, on an extension of pos- terior dichotomy still further forwards, so that it involves the greater part of the base of the skull. An accessory face is formed in the angle between the two axes. This face is deficient in its axial parts, and hence it exhibits the phenomena of axial arrest or deficiency, as fusion of the eyes and ears, agnathia, &c. (See Class VI.) 85. A foetal Pig with dichotomy of the axis extending forward into the basisphenoid region. The accessory face has the eyes fused together as far as the edges of their irides. There is a frontal proboscis above, and a pair of closely approximated ears below; a condition precisely similar to that seen in cases of epencephalic deficiency, i. e. defi- ciency of the epencephalic region and all the parts an- terior to it. (See Nos. 187 to 190.) Hunterian. 86. A similar foetal Pig with the eyes of the accessory face di- stinct, but so obliquely placed that the fissures of the eyelids are almost vertical. Presented by J. Winter-bottom, Esq. ** In the Human foetus. a. Schizorhachis. Syn. Dipygus, Forster. Dc'radelphus, Geoff. 87. A female Human foetus with complete dichotomy of the spi- nal column, probably affecting the basioccipital region, although there is no external indication of dichotomy extending to the skull. There arc two perfect trunks united by the thorax. One of the right arms is distorted at the wrist. Hunterian. c

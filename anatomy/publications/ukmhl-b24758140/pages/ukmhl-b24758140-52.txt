18 ABNORMAL CONDITIONS OF THE AXIS. b. Schizocotis. Syn. Synkephalus asymmetros, Forster. Janiceps, Geoff. Janus-Bildung. 88. A female Human foetus with posterior dichotomy extending into the base of the skull, probably as far forward as the posterior part of the basisphenoid. There is a pair of well-formed external ears behind fused together below, with a single meatus between them. A small circular fossa above these, with a depression in its centre from which a minute tuft of hair is growing, probably represents a rudimentary Cyclops-eye. Mus. Brit. 89. A similar female Human foetus with the dichotomous condi- tion extending a little further forwards, so that a trans- verse fissure corresponds to the position of a Cyclops-eye. Brought from the East Indies in 1805. Presented by Sir E. Home, Bart., 1807. C. Antero-posterior Dichotomy. Syn. Hemipagus, Geoff. Anterior and posterior dichotomy often coexist in the same embryo. In animals there can be no doubt that this condition is distinct from Homologous union; when it is extreme, how- ever, as in No. 94, a human foetus, it is impossible to deter- mine to which Subclass the phenomenon should be referred*. 90. A foetal Kitten with complete dichotomy of the trunk, and a slightly double condition of the tongue and mandible. Hunterian. 91. A similar foetal Kitten with more considerable dichotomy of the mandible and tongue, accompanied by cleft palate. 92. A similar Kitten with the median anterior limbs fused as far as the carpus. 93. A foetal Pig with posterior dichotomy (Schizorhachis) com- bined with anterior dichotomy of the lower jaw and tongue. There is a considerable cleft in the palate con- nected with the median rami of the jaw by a fold of mucous membrane. (No. 52 exhibits a similar condition.) Hunterian. * See Introduction.

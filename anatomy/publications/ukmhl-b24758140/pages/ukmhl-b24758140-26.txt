INTROBUCTION. XXII become widely separated by the manner in which the ilia and sacrum supported the weight of the trunk. With regard to the nature of the origin of arrest nothing is known positively. Like all malformations, some forms appear closely allied to variations, some to diseases. In arrest, however, the variations, if they be such, take the form of reversions. This may be more apparent than real; but in some cases, where growth continues and evolution does not, it appears as if the parts are actually developed in conformity with an anterior type rather than simply arrested in their formation. Bilocularity of the human uterus, the formation of uterine cornua, enlargement of the clitoris, development of the uterus masculinus, hypospadias, the formation of a cloaca, webbing of the fingers, arrest of the ventricular septum of the heart, and the persistence of a spiracle uniting the pharynx and auditory meatus are ex- amples of this kind. Class VI. Disease. The last class of malformations consists of intra-uterine diseases and their results. The most marked forms are those of spinal and appendicular deformity, and dropsy of the central canal of the nervous system, giving rise to hydrocephalus, epicephalocele, spina bifida, &c. It will be observed that no class has been formed for malformations from excess of development; for it may well be doubted if any such exist, unless under the forms of variation or duplicity. There are, however, some cases which might possibly be considered as the result of excess in the developmental process; although, without more evidence, it appears inju- dicious to erect a class which all observations tend to render more and more hypothetical in its nature. Certain fishes, for instance, occasionally exhibit a very remarkable form of hermaphrodism in which a portion of an ovary is developed as a testis, whilst the remainder becomes a perfect ovary.

VARIATION. 87 from the posterior part of the arch of the aorta, and passes behind, the oesophagus to its destination. From the Museum of Sir A. Cooper, Bart. 375. A portion of the arch of a Human aorta. The vertebral arteries are given off between the innominate and left carotid arteries. The right vertebral is considerably larger than the left. b. Situs Mutatus. 376. A large Human heart with all its parts reversed; there was also reversion of all the viscera. The systemic auricle and ventricle are enormously enlarged and hypertrophied. The coronary sinus is largely dilated and receives two large veins. There is no evidence that the hypertrophy and dilatation are due to the malformation. These changes are the results of disease. The spleen in this case was divided into nine separate glands (see No. 390). The specimen is described and figured in the Path. Soc. Trans, vol. xx. p. 93, pi. v. Presented by Dr. Hickman, 1871. c. In the number of arterial valves. Sometimes two or four valves exist at the mouth of the aorta or pulmonary artery. With our present knowledge it is perhaps best to consider these deviations as variations. There is no evidence of dichotomy in cases of supernumerary valves. The condition is not very rare. d. Division of the cavity of a ventricle by an adventitious septum. This condition is perhaps a very near approach to excess of development. In the following preparation, however, it is apparently due to a variation in the development and position of the columnar carnse. 377. An adult Human heart with a strong muscular septum dividing the apex of the right ventricle into two cavities. The septum terminates in a concave margin between the pulmonary artery and the tricuspid valve; it apparently consists of united columnar carna;. It is perforated by numerous small openings, between the muscular bundles of which it is composed. Hunterian.

DUPLICITY. 37 been mistaken for a nipple, and hence the foetus was er- roneously described as a female. The generative organs are those of an imperfect male, consisting of a rudimentary penis invested by a very voluminous circular prepuce. The funis is short and thick, and when recent the foetus was covered with sebaceous secretion. Presented by N. HigUmore, Esq. C. By Adhesion. This is a much less intimate mode of union, and probably takes place at a much later stage of development. It occasionally happens that bothfoetuses are well developed, especially when they adhere by the skulls, the brains and their membranes remaining separate; much more frequently one foetus is very defective; it often forms a mere tumour, especially when adherent to the nates of the other. a.

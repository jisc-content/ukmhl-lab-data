DUPLICITY. 25 perfect twin similarly attached. In this preparation the parasitic limhs are fused as far as the metatarsus. A comparison of these limbs with the dichotomous limb of a monkey, No. 307, shows the difference between malfor- mation from fission and fusion in a marked manner. Hunterian. C. Parazygosis *. In Parazygosis twins are united, by the visceral laminae of the trunk, above the umbilicus. They are usually placed face to face, and have the laminae on each side equally developed; rarely they are placed side by side, and have the laminae of the adjacent sides very deficient. Parazygosis is extremely rare in animals, although it is the commonest form of duplicity in the human foetus. a. Xiphopagus, Geoff. The least degree of parazygosis. The union is by the xiphoid cartilages of the sterna and by the abdominal walls, above the umbilicus. 105. A wax model of the band of union of the " Siamese Twins " made in 1830, when they were 19 years of age. In child- hood the band was proportionately much larger and shorter, so that the twins were much closer together. The xiphoid cartilages of the sterna pass across the upper edge of the band. The condition of these twins at the age of 19 and their history is given in the Phil. Traus. 1830, p. 117. Presented by G. B. Bolton, Esq., 1830. b. Thoracopagus, Forster. Syn. Sternopagus, Geoff. In this form the thoracic cavities are united by the visceral laminae; the foetuses are placed symmetrically face to face. 106. Female Human thoracopagous twins, 3 inches long (about the third month of gestation). Presented by Sir E. Home, Bart., 1804. 107. A similar twin-birth, 3 inches long (about the third month of gestation). The relation of the foetuses was disturbed when this specimen was first put into spirit, so that it does not apparently conform with * Tlaph by 1 he side of, {vyuw to unite.

105 ARREST OP DEVELOPMENT. d. Hermaplirodism. Syn. Hermaphrodisme bisexuel, Geoff. Although there is no evidence that true hermaphrodism is an arrest of development, it has been thought advisable, in the absence of all knowledge as to its nature, to place it in the same series as those remarkable conditions known as Androgyny and Gynandry, with which it appears to have some connexion. True hermaphrodism is not uncommon as a malformation amongst unisexual Invertebrates. Sometimes one side of the body is male and the other female; this is the usual form amongst insects. Another form of true hermaphrodism has been frequently observed amongst fish, in which a portion of one or both ovaries is differentiated into a testis. The following preparations are of this kind :â€” 446. The ovaries and external generative aperture of a Codfish injected. A large piece of convoluted testicle is inti- mately connected with the wall of the right ovisac, in the middle of its outer margin. It is uncertain whether the seminal ducts in this case open into the ovisac; but in a precisely similar case described by Dr. J. A. Smith* there were five distinct ducts perforating the ovisac and open- ing into the cavity of the ovarium. Presented by W. Lynn, Esq., 1825. 447. A similar preparation, in which the posterior end of the left ovary is united with a convoluted mass of testicle almost equalling the ovary in size. Presented by Sir A. Carlisle, 1821. 448. A similar preparation, but not injected, in which a portion of convoluted testicle is attached to the anterior end of the left ovary. The testis is about half as large as the ovary. The right ovisac has been opened to show the tufts of ova. Presented by Sir E. Home, Bart., 1802. 449. The ovaries of a Fish, probably a small Cod, with a very small convoluted mass of testes attached to the anterior extremity of the right ovary. Mus.

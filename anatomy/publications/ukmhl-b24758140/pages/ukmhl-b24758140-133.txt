ARREST OF DUVISLOI'MKNT. 99 guinal canal; the right gland is entirely within the internal abdominal ring, and lies in the right iliac fossa. b. Androgyny. Syn. Pseudo-hermaphroditus, Gurlt. Androgynus, Gurlt. Hermaphrodismes niasculins, Geoff. Hermaphrodismes neutres, Geoff. 427. The lower portion of the trunk of a male child in which the external generative organs so closely resemble those of a female that the child was called " Ellen." The scrotum is very large, completely divided into two halves, so that it forms two labium-like folds of skin ; these are thickened by hypertrophied connective and adipose tissue. The penis is absent; but a fold of skin*strongly resembling the nympkse and clitoris exists in its place: it is probably the prepuce. The urethra and- sinus pocularis open by distinct orifices between the lobes of the scrotum. A blue glass rod marks the orifice of the sinus. The urethra is laid open laterally, as is also the lower part of the sinus. The upper part of the sinus is surrounded by prostatic tissue, and it terminates in a pair of cornua, to which the vasa deferentia are attached; these are probably impervious. The testes are abdominal. The bladder and one kidney have been preserved. Presented by R. Partridge, Esq., 1865. c. Gynandry. Syn. Hermaphrodismes feminines, Geoff. 428.

The uterus and ovaries are normal. The posterior wall of the vagina has been laid open, and a bristle marks the orifice externally. 429. The generative organs of a Human female infant. The clitoris is very large; a fold of skin above it represents H 2

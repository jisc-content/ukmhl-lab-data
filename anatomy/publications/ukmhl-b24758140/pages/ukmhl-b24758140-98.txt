ABNORMAL CONDITIONS OF THE AXIS. 64 Class "VI. Malfokmations of the axis feom disease. Subclass I. Curvature of the axis. The causes producing congenital curvature of the axis are un- known; it may nevertheless be looked upon as the effect of disease, and may occur at any time during foetal life from the earliest period. Except that the resulting malformations are more grave, it differs in no way from ordinary lateral curvature. a. Simple curvature. 256. A Perch with congenital curvature of the spine. Hunterian. 257. A similar specimen, with the integuments and muscles of the left side dissected off. Hunterian. 258. A Trout with congenital curvature of the spine. Presented by Sir A. Carlisle. 259. The embryo of a Goose about the fourth day of incubation, with curvature of the axis. Hunterian. 260. The skeleton of the trunk of a hybrid Duck, bred in St. James's Park, with a very remarkable antero-posterior flexure of the sacral region, giving rise to considerable shortening of the trunk. Presented by H. J. B. Hancock, Esq., 1868. 261. A foetal Calf removed from one of the lateral halves of a divided uterus, No. 450, with considerable curvature of the spine. Hunterian. b. With ectopia of the viscera. Syn. Monstres Celosomiens, Geoff. 262. A Human female full-time foetus with curvature of the spine and considerable contortion of the inferior extremities. The anterior thoracic and abdominal wall has been re- moved, with the viscera; it forms the next preparation. The abdominal cavity is so small that all the viscera pro- truded into a large sac situated in front of the abdomen. 263. The anterior thoracic and abdominal wall of the same, showing the opening through which the viscera pro- truded. The anterior wall of the hernial sac has been removed. The

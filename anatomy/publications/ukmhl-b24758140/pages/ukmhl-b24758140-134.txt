100 ABNORMAL CONDITIONS OF THE GENERATIVE ORGANS. the prepuce. The labia are close together below the urethra-like external generative opening: they resemble a scrotum. Externally this foetus could not have been distinguished from a hypospadiac male. The inch and a half of the genital tract common to the vagina and ure- thra is very narrow. Above the neck of the bladder the vagina is normal; it has been laid open to show the os and cervix uteri. The Fallopian tubes and ovaries are normal. The left round ligament has been preserved; it ends in the cellular tissue of the labium. 430. The external organs of generation of a Human female in- fant. The vaginal opening is contracted as in the last two preparations. There is a very large clitoris almost embraced by the labia and nymphse, the latter forming a prepuce above the clitoris. There appears to have been an imperforate anus ac- companying the malformation, for which an operation has been performed; this is not, however, recorded. Hunterian. *"* In Animals. a. Hypospadias. 431. The generative organs of a male Sheep with extreme hypospadias. The urethra opens immediately in front of the anus; but a groove passes forward from this point to the extremity of the penis. The glans penis is small, but is situated in the normal position. The retractor muscles of the penis are absent, and the abdominal in- tegument is united with the edges of the groove on the under side of the penis, as far forward as the glans. The scrotum is cleft into two distinct sacs; these are filled with hypertrophied connective tissue. The testes are abdominal. The vesiculse seminales and vasa deferentia open into the urethra.

The rectum of a male Child upon whom the operation for imperforate anus was performed with some success. In this instance the trochar had to be introduced three inches before it reached the intestine. The child survived more than ten months. The parts around the artificial opening are much contracted by the action of the spirit in which it is preserved, so that its length is reduced to little more than an mch. The child suffered much from constipa- tion, sometimes for three weeks at a time, and also from a small fistulous opening between the intestine and the urethra; the urine first became tinged with feces at the end of three months. The intestine above the structure is greatly dilated and hypertrophied. Presented by A. C. Hutchison, Esq., 1823.

12 ABNORMAL CONDITIONS OF THE AXIS. MS. dissections that there was a third median carotid in front of the trachea, which divided in the head into two vessels having the usual branches and distribution. Hunterian. b. Dicephalus, Gurlt. In dicephalus the dichotomy extends beyond the base of the skull, and involves the anterior portion of the vertebral column. 62. The cervical and some of the dorsal vertebrae of a dicephalous Calf, in which dichotomy extends as far as the anterior dorsal vertebrae. The atlas and axis of the right neck are unfortunately lost. The dorsal spines below the di- chotomous region are bifurcated. There are two ossific centres in the bodies of the dorsal vertebrae, a condition seen in almost all malformations of the spine. A num- ber of small ossific centres occur between the bodies of the vertebrae at the point of bifurcation. There is a piece of cartilage in the angle of bifurcation. Presented by J. B. Stauffer, Esq., 1867. 63. The brains and a portion of the spinal cord of a dicephalous Lamb. Dichotomy extends to an inch and a half below the foramen magnum. 64. The oesophagus of a dicephalous (?) Lamb bifurcated to within about 4 inches of the stomach. Presented by R. Partridge, Esq. B. Posterior Dichotomy. * In Animals. (This condition is almost confined to quadrupeds, and is very rare in the human foetus. Human foetuses affected with di- chotomy have been placed together at the end of the series: see Nos. 87, 88, and 89.) a. Dipygus, Gurlt. Dichotomy of the posterior portion of the axis is far more common in Mammals than of the anterior portion. There are three distinct forms of posterior dichotomy. In the first the pelvis alone is double and the second axis is wanting; hence it is doubtful whether such forms should be included in this class. 4K

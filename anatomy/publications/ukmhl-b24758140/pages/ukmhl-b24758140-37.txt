ABNORMAL CONDITIONS IN ANIMALS. 3 14. Three Spanish Nuts united by their pericarps : union seems to have taken place during the later stages of develop- ment, as it is not complete, and the adjacent portions of the pericarps are flattened. A section has been made through the nuts. Presented by Prof. Flower, 1871. c. Union of seeds (Synspermy). 15. Two Bean-seeds united by their cotyledons near their hila, which are distinct. The testa is continuous over the two seeds. Hunterian. d. Union of embryos (Synopliy). 16. Two seedling Orange-plants attached by their cotyledons; they were produced from a single seed. There are four cotyledons, but the two between the embryos are smaller and are closely adherent to one another. Presented by B. T. Lowne, Esq., 1871. 17. Three seedling Orange-plants growing from a single seed. The cotyledons are united between the embryos. The third embryo is very much smaller than the other two. " It occurs, not unfrequently, in the Orange and Hazel that more than one embryo is developed in a single testa; and this condition is very common in the Coniferae, Cycas, the Onion, and the Mis - seltoe. Now and then a union cf these embryos takes place." (Lindley's ' Introduction to Botany.') Presented by B. T. Lowne, Esq., 1871. Series II. ABNORMAL CONDITIONS AFFECTING THE AXIS IN ANIMALS. Class I. Variation*. a. Situs mutatus {transposition of the viscera). This is the only class of phenomena affecting the whole axis which can be regarded as a variation.

88 ABNORMAL CONDITIONS OF THE HEAKT AND VESSELS. * The other Classes do not occur in this Series. Class V. Aeeest op Development*. a. Arrested closure of ilie ductus arteriosus. 378. The heart of a male Infant, which died with symptoms of cyanosis five days after hirth. The ductus arteriosus is quite patent. The foramen ovale remains as a slight opening. The heart is abnormally large and weighed 1-^ oz. Presented by Dr. Thurnam. b. Of the foramen ovale. 379. The heart of a Child three years old, with a large valvular opening in the fossa ovalis. A quill is passed through the opening. Presented by Sir W. Blizard, 1811. 380. The heart of an Adult with a valvular opening in the fossa ovalis. A glass rod has been passed through the open- ing. Presented by Sir W. Blizard, 1811. 381. A similar preparation. Presented by Sir W. Blizard. 382. The auricular septum of an adult Human heart, with a similar opening in the fossa ovalis. Hunterian. 383. The auricular septum of an Adult of sixty years of age, with a double valvular opening in the fossa ovalis. Hunterian. c. Of the ventricular septum. 384. The heart of a lad of thirteen, with both ventricles laid open. The septum is deficient above, so that a semilunar opening exists between them. Mus. Heaviside. 385. An adult Human heart, with a similar semilunar opening in the upper part of the ventricular septum, protected by a poach-like valve of endocardium. The upper edge of this valve is strengthened by a thickened margin, above which there is a semilunar opening between the ventricles. The pouch projects considerably into the right ventricle; it is perforated by several small openings. The outer flap of the tricuspid valve is converted into a similar pouch, which probably covered the septal pouch during the ventricular systole, and partially closed the abnormal opening. Purchased.

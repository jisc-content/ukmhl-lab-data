101 AKREST OF DEVELOPMENT. 434. The generative organs of a Dog with extreme hypospadias. The scrotum is bifurcated. There is a large hood-like pouch in front of the imperforate penis, and a median furrow in front of the urethra. The urethra opens close to the anus. The testes are contained in the scrotum. Hunterian. b. Androgyny. 435. The generative organs of a small androgynous Dog. The testes are abdominal and atrophied. The vasa deferentia are impervious and like fine threads. The penis is im- perforate and very rudimentary. The urinary and sexual outlets are immediately in front of the anus; they are close together, but distinct. The vasa deferentia are united into a single cord, nearly two inches behind the external orifice *. Presented by Sir E. Home, Bart., 1802. 436. The generative organs of an androgynous Sheep. The penis is imperforate and of small size; it is retracted in lateral sigmoid curves, so that its extremity lies in front of the urethral outlet. The retractor muscles are well developed; the glans is covered by a hood-like sheath. The extremity of the urethra is marked by a blue glass rod. There are four well-marked teats, each with a single gland-duct. The testes are abdominal. Hunterian. 437. The generative organs of a young androgynous Bull. The penis is permanently retracted, so that its extremity lies in a sac-like pouch in front of the anus. Hunterian. 438. The testes of the same animal, imbedded in a mass of sub- cutaneous fat above four well-formed abdominal teats. Hunterian. 439. A section of the pelvis of an androgynous Calf, showing the generative organs. There is a narrow urino-genital pouch, about 4 inches in length; it is marked by a blue rod. The urethra, marked by a purple rod, opens into this sinus near its outlet. The upper (anterior) extremity of the sinus ends in two cornua, into which the vasa deferentia open. Two small cysts, probably the remains of the * Described in Phil. Trans, vol. lxxxix. p. 157, tab. iv. figs. 1 & 2.

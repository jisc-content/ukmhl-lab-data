16 ABNORMAL CONDITION'S OK THE AXIS. 77. A similar foetal Kitten, with the skull and spinal canal opened to show the brain and the double medulla and cord. Hunterian. 78. A similar Kitten, with the thorax and abdomen opened to show the viscera. There is slight anterior dichotomy affecting the lower lip, mandible, and tongue, with fis- sure of the palate. The alimentary canal is double from the lower portion of the ileum downwards. Hunterian. 79. A similar Kitten, with the thorax and abdomen opened and the viscera raised to show the kidneys, of which there are but two, the urinary bladders, and hypogastric arteries. Hunterian. 80. A similar Kitten, in which the median pair of anterior ex- tremities are united as far as the carpus. The upper lip and palate are deeply cleft. Hunterian. c. Schizocotis *. Under this term those forms have been classed in which, in addition to complete dichotomy of the trunk, dichotomy of the posterior part of the skull is apparent externally. A pair of more or less developed external ears exist between the two axes, exhi- biting variable degrees of fusion with one another in a 'manner analogous to that seen in extreme cases of anterior axial defi- ciency. 81. A foetal Rabbit with slight dichotomy of the base of the skull. The approximate external ears are of small size; they are very defective, and are fused together. Hunterian. 82. A foetal Rabbit with somewhat more considerable dichotomy of the base of the skull. There are a distinct pair of ad- ditional ears. The roof of the skull has been removed to show the extent of the dichotomy. This was one of a litter of six, the remainder were normal. Presented by C. R. Bree, M.D., 1871. 83. A foetal Cat with dichotomy extending to the base of the skull, and involving only part of the basioccipital bone. Ko-is, the occiput.

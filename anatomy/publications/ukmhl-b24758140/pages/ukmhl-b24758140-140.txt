106 ABNORMAL CONDITIONS OF THE GENERATIVE ORGANS. D. Of the Uterus, a. Double uterus. The Miillerian ducts in some animals (the Didelphia) remain distinct, in others partially distinct, forming the uterine cornua; or they unite to form the cavity of the uterus, their distinct ends forming the tubes, as in Man. Sometimes in the latter the union either fails partially or entirely, giving rise to a corniculate or double uterus. The vagina is also divided by a septum in extreme cases. 450. The uterus of a Cow, in which there is a partial septum below the cornua. The body of the uterus contains a single cavity, from which the deformed immature foetus No. 261 was taken. There are two cervices and a double os. Hunterian. 451. The vagina and internal generative organs of a Human adult female. The vagina is completely divided by a strong muscular septum. The uterus is double, and each lateral half is quite separate from the other ; they have been bent over laterally in making the preparation. There is a single tube and ovary to each uterus. The cavity of the vagina and uteri are laid open. Presented by T. Wormald, Esq. 452. The orifice of the vagina of a Human adult female; it is divided by a strong muscular septum, commencing im- mediately above the urethra. The right nympha forms a free process posteriorly, as if it had been dissected from its attachment. 453. A double Human uterus and vagina. One of tbe lateral uteri contains a full-time foetus; the other cavity is considerably developed, measuring 4 inches in diameter. The vagina is completely divided by a septum. The bladder, the right side of the vagina, and both uterine cavities are laid open. There is but a single Fallopian tube to each uterus. Hunterian. ยง Sometimes one lateral half of the uterus is undeveloped, uterus unicornis; sometimes the os or the vagina is occluded. It is uncertain whether such malformations should properly be included in the present Class.

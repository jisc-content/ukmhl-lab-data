ABNORMAL CONDITIONS OF THE AXIS. 48 187. The head of a foetal Pig with entire deficiency of the facial axis, naso-frontal processes, and eyes. There is a V-shaped fissure in the position of the eyelids, which has been en- larged on the right side to show the complete deficiency of the eye. The skull has been opened above, and the" cerebellum is seen to be the only portion of the brain it contains. Mus. Brit. 188. A portion of the occipital and parietal bones of the same. Mus. Brit. 189. The head of a foetal Pig with anterior deficiency of the facial axis and absence of the eyes. The maxillary pro- cesses are separated by a deep wide fissure, so that the two halves of the snout are turned outwards and upwards. Hunterian. C. Mesencephalic arrest. Syn. Anopia. It sometimes happens that the middle of the cranial axis and cavity are deficient, whilst the anterior cerebral lobes and the anterior facial region are normal. In this condition the eyes are rudimentary or absent. The tentorium divides the cranial cavity, sometimes to such an extent as entirely to separate the cerebral hemispheres from the cerebellum. 190. A vertical longitudinal section of the head of a Lamb, in which the cerebellum is cut off from the cerebrum by the tentorium. The axial parts between the cerebrum and cerebellum are entirely wanting. The eye is very small and rudimentary. There is atresia of the oesophagus, the upper part of which is apparently entirely wanting. The pharynx is wanting and the mouth ends in a pouch behind the tongue. 191. Half the skull of the same. The bones are all present but the orbito-sphenoids, which are represented by membrane only. The frontals are much elevated in front and de- fective behind; the parietals and all the bones behind the frontals are very small. The eye on this side was exactly like that on the other. D. Epencephalic arrest. The axis of the skull immediately in front of or between the

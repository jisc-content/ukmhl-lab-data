ARREST OF DEVELOPMENT. 91 median incisors; the upper specimen apparently con- sists of the two median upper incisors intimately united. They arc probably all from the same subject. Presented by J. Sivan, Esq., 1838. 392. A Human second molar tooth with an inverted tooth wedged in between its fangs. (The inverted tooth is probably the wisdom-tooth, which has been developed on the ascending ramus of the mandible, and which has grown downwards, displacing the fangs of the second molar with its crown and becoming impacted between them.) 399. The double tusk of an Elephant. B. Of the Alimentary Canal. Class V. Arrest of Development*. a. Of the pharynx and oesophagus. The pharynx may terminate in a blind pouch, which is either entirely separated from the oesophagus or connected with it by a fibrous or muscular cord only; in such cases the oesophagus often opens into the trachea, near its bifurcation. 394. The tongue, pharynx, trachea, and oesophagus of a Human foetus, with a small portion of the diaphragm and stomach. The oesophagus opens into the trachea just above its bifurcation; it is not connected with the pharynx. The trachea has been opened in front, and a green glass rod has been inserted into the oeso- phagus. 395. A similar preparation from a new-born Child, in which the lungs and stomach are also preserved. The oesophagus is united with the pharynx by a muscular band. Presented by Dr. Ayres. 396. A similar preparation from a Human foetus; the lungs are abnormal in form, and have not been inflated with air. b. Atresia of the rectum. Syn. Atreto cormus, Ourlt. One of the most frequent malformations which come under * The other Classes have not occurred in this Series.

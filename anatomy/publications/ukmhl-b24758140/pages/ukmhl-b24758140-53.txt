DUPLICITY. 19 94. A female Human foetus with posterior dichotomy (Schizo- rhachis) combined with anterior dichotomy, producing considerable doubling of the face. There are four eyes, but the inner ones are contained in a single orbit. The axes diverge, both in front and behind, from a point in the basisphenoid bone. Hunterian. Subclass II. Homologous union. A. Prozygosis*. Syn. Somatodidymus, Gurlt. Monstres Syncephaliens, Geoff. Synkephalus symmetros, Forster. Janus-Bildung. In Prozygosis there are two perfectly distinct axes united at their anterior extremities, so that at an early stage there must have been two distinct embryos. The foetuses arising from such embryos are united by the visceral arches and laminae above the umbilicus. The right side of one axis unites with the left side of the opposite one. 95. Female Human twins, about the seventh month of gestation, united by prozygosis. The faces are opposite to each other, and at right angles to the normal position; they are much flattened, the eyes are closely approximated, and the ears are very low down. The two embryos were pro- bably distinct at first, and became united by the fusion of the anterior extremities of the investing mass of each with that of the other, so that the trabecule became united in the same manner as the other facial arches are joined, the right arch of one embryo being fused with the left arch of the other. The following history is recorded:—" Labour lasted forty-eight hours, delivery followed without instruments. The mother, a negress, had convulsions. The foetuses lived five minutes, a very unusual occurrence in such cases. There was one funis and one placenta." Presented by T. Sharp, M.D., 1820. 96. A similar twin-birth about the sixth month of gestation, U(>i) before, £«yo« to unite. c 2

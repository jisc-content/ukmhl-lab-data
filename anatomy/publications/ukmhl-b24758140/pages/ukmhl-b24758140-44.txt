Diprosopus is the term applied to those forms of anterior dichotomy in which fission does not extend to any of the ver- tebrae. This condition often accompanies posterior dichotomy. Examples are seen in Nos. 90 to 94. In its lesser forms it is called Monocranus by Gurlt. 49. A Kitten with dichotomy of the anterior part of the face; one mouth is very imperfect. There is a single pair of eyes. Hunterian. 50. A Kitten with dichotomy of the head extending further back than in the last, so that there are four eyes. The eyelids of the median eyes have no inner commissures, but are united and bound in a single fissui'e. Hunterian. 51. A foetal Kitten with more considerable anterior dichotomy. The laminae of the vertebrae and spinal cord are deficient in the lumbar region. Hunterian. 52. The head of a foetal Pig with dichotomy of the anterior part of the face; the mandible, tongue, and the anterior portion of the maxillary bones are double. There is a consider- able fissure in the palate, from which a fibrous band ex- tends to the united mesial rami of the mandible. A por- tion of skin covered with hair, representing the mediau cheeks, is lodged in the fissure in the palate. Hunterian. 53. The head of a foetal Pig with considerable dichotomy of the lower, and slight dichotomy of the upper jaw, dissected to show the accessory masseter muscles. The tongue is double; the other parts are single. This specimen before dissection exhibited only what appeared to be a second mouth in the cheek. 54. An anencephalous foetal Pig with more considerable anterior dichotomy than the last, producing a single median eye. Purchased. 55. The head of a Calf with anterior dichotomy extending as far back as the presphenoid bone. The muzzles are united by a thick fold of integument almost to their extremities.

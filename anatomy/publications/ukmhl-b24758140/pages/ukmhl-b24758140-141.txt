ABNORMAL CONDITIONS OF THE OVA OF BIBDS. 107 b. Atresia of the os. 454. A section of a Human adult female pelvis, with tlie internal generative organs in situ. The uterus is very much en- larged ; it is prolapsed, and lies in the curve of the sacrum. The os was occluded, and an operation was performed, but the patient died. The uterus contained a quantity of offensive fluid. The right ovary is diseased and con- tains large cysts filling the right iliac fossa. There are traces of bloot-clot in the peritoneal cavity.

It forms a large thin-walled cyst, which was distended with air. The left oviduct was normal; it has been removed, but its orifice is indicated by a bristle. Presented by W. B. Tegetmeier, Esq. 456. The oviduct and ovary of a small Hen, which during life laid eggs about the size of a Pigeon's, consisting exclu- sively of albumen, covered by a very perfect shell. One of the eggs is*seen in the abdominal opening of the ovi- duct. The oviduct is so small that it could not grasp and transmit the yelks. The ovary is loaded with well- developed ova. When the abdomen was opened the peritoneal cavity was found to be full of the yellow fluid contents of the yelks, which had escaped. The egg which is now in the open extremity of the oviduct was found in the abdominal cavity; another was situated in the cloaca. As the egg found in the abdominal cavity had undergone no change, it appears probable that it passed back into the abdominal cavity when the Fowl was killed ; it was therefore replaced in the extremity of the oviduct, to show how it must have passed into

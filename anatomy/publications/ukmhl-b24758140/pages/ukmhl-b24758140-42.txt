8 ABNORMAL CONDITIONS OF THE AXIS. exposed. The upper mandible and maxillary bones are entirely deficient, but there is a slight frontal protu- berance. Presented by B. Hanbury, Esq. Subclass II. Homologous union. a, Pleuropagus, Forster. The following preparations exhibit posterior combined with anterior dichotomy; but there appear to be two axes throughout, although the vertebrae are themselves fused in some part of the spinal column. The condition will be at once understood by comparing Nos. 118 to 121. It is impossible, as has already been stated, to say whether the condition arises from fission or fusion. 42. Twin foetal Pigeons united by the dorsal regions of the spinal column, the median visceral laminae being absent. The right lamina of one bird and the left of the other form the abdominal and thoracic walls. The heads and necks are distinct. The neural arches in the upper part of both vertebral columns are defective. Purchased, 1858. 43. Twin foetal Guinea-fowls similarly united with fusion of the vertebral columns in their upper part. There is also fusion of the head and necks. The median eyes are fused into a single but abnormally large organ. The lower mandibles likewise form a single organ. The neural arch of the skull is open, and the brain and spinal cord are deficient. Presented by E. Belfour, Esq., 1818. 44. A similar union of twin foetal Ducks. The brain is com- pletely double and without any covering, b. Hypogastrodidymus, Gurlt. The two succeeding specimens almost exhibit the characters of heterologous union ; they, however, probably commenced their de- velopment by homologous union, and have therefore been placed in this Subclass. (See also J^os. 103 and 104, which present a similar condition.) 45. A Chick with the rudiments of a second Chfck occupying the pubic symphysis. The rudimentary Chick consists

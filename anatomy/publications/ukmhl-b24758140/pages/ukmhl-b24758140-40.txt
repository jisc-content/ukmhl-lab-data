6 ABNORMAL CONDITIONS OP THE AXIS. 27. A small English Snake with two heads. Presented by W. White Cooper, Esq., 1872. B. Posterior Dichotomy. There is no true case of congenital posterior dichotomy in Reptiles in the Collection. The following specimen probably represents an acquired condition, the result of injury and the well-known powers of repair possessed by these animals. 28. A Lizard in which a portion of the extremity of the tail is double. Hunterian. Subseries V. In Bikds. Subclass I. Dichotomy. A. Anterior Dichotomy. 29. A foetal Duck with two heads and necks; the dorsal vertebrae, the trunk, and its appendages are single. Hunterian. 30. A similar foetal Turkey with the skull and vertebral canal open from arrested closure of the neural arches. Presented by Lady Northampton. 31. A similar foetal Fowl, in which the neural arches of the head are undeveloped. The brain-membranes are exposed. Presented by Sir W. Blizard. 32. A similar foetal Chick with fusion of the heads, so that the approximate eyes have coalesced into a single organ. The neural arches of the head are undeveloped, and the brains are exposed. The spinal cord is deficient, the vertebral canal containing its membranes only. Hunterian. B. Posterior Dichotomy. 33. A Chick with the posterior half of the cerebro-spiiial axis double. There are four legs, but the wings are two in number. The abdominal parietes are deficient, and the neural laminae are undeveloped in the cervical region. There is a slight notch in the upper mandible, as if a tendency to superior dichotomy had likewise existed; Hiuil( Han. 34. A Duckling with posterior dichotomy of the greater part of

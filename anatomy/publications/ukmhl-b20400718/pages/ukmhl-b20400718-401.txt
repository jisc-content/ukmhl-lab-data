"DISSECTION OF THE FEMALE PERINEUM. 387 not enter the bulb, plump so to speak, and then pass on precisely through the middle of the spongy body, but that it runs all along nearer to its upper surface. The bulb, therefore, hangs more or less pendulous from the urethra. In old persons it hangs lower down than in children, and is consequently more exposed to injury in lithotomy. The corpus spongiosum has a much thinner external coat than the corpus cavernosum. Its interior is composed of a plexus of minute tortuous veins. This is plainly demonstrated by injecting the dorsal vein of the penis with wax. In this way we not only fill the spongy body, but also the glans and the large veins which form the plexus round the corona glandis.* e. The chief nerves of the penis are the pudic. By far the largest branches run along the dorsum of the organ to the outside ot the glans : a few only enter the erectile tissue of the organ. This, it has already been mentioned (§ 72), is supplied by filaments of the sympathetic nerve proceeding from the hypogastric plexus. f. The absorbent vessels roceeding from the glans and the in- tegument of the penis join the inguinal glands. The deeper set accompany the veins beneath the pubic arch, and join the glands in the pelvis. THE DISSECTION OF THE FEMALE PERINEUM. 79. The pudenda in the female consist of folds of the integu- ment, called the labia. Between these there is a longitudinal fissure which leads to the separate orifices of the urinary and genital canals. 80. Labia majora.—The pubic region is generally covered by an accumulation of fat, which is called the mons veneris. From this, two thick folds of skin descend, one on either side, consti- tuting the labia majora. Their junction, about one inch above the * In the museum of Royal College of Surgeons there is a beautiful prepara- tion in which the glans penis is injected with quicksilver, clearly showing it to consist of a plexus of veins.—Physiol.

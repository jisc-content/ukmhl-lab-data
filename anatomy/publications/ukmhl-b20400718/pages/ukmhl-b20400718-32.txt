THE UPPER ARM. 18 It may come from the axillary, or the infra-scapular, or the inferior thoracic. It ramifies in the cellular tissue of the axilla, supplying the axillary glands. 24. The axillary vein is formed by the junction of the vence comites of the brachial artery, near the anterior border of the subsca- pularis muscle. It receives the subscapular and the other veins corre- sponding to the branches of the axillary artery, with the exception of the circumflex, which usually join, either the subscapular, or one of the vense comites. The axillary also receives the cephalic, and sometimes the basilic veins. DISSECTION OF THE UPPER ARM. 25. Let the incision through the skin be continued down the arm over the front of the elbow to about two inches below it. Reflect the skin from the front and sides of the arm without re- moving the adipose and cellular tissue in which the subcutaneous nerves and veins ramify. The cutaneous nerves which perforate the fascia on the inner side of the arm are branches of the inter- costo-humeral, and the greater and lesser internal cutaneous nerves. The filaments of the inter costo-humeral nerves may be traced down the inner and posterior part of the arm to the olecranon. The branches of the internal cutaneous nerve, two or more in number, perforate the fascia in one or two places about the middle of the inner side of the arm, and subdivide into two sets of fila- ments, of which the one supplies the anterior, the other the posterior surface of the fore-arm. The lesser internal cutaneous, or nerve of Wrisberg, perforates the fascia about the lower third of the arm, and ramifies over the internal condyle and olecranon. All these cutaneous nerves have frequent communications with each other. The internal cutaneous branch of the musculo-spiral nerve is sometimes wanting, and always small. It is usually accompanied by a small artery, and pierces the fascia near the middle of the inner side of the arm.

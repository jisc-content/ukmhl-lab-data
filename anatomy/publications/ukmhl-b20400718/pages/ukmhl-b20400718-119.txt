105 JOINTS OF THE FINGERS. bones are found in the glenoid ligament belonging to the joint between the metacarpal bone and the first phalanx of the thumb. These joints are secured on their dorsal aspect by the passage of the extensor tendon, and the expansion proceeding from it on either side. Their synovial membranes are loose, especially beneath the extensor tendons. 164. Joints between the phalanges oe the fingers and the thumb.â€”The corresponding articular surfaces of the phalanges of the finger and thumb are so shaped as to form a hinge-joint, and, therefore, incapable of lateral movement. The ligaments connecting them are similar in every respect to those between the metacarpal bones and the first phalanges. The glenoid ligament of the last joint of the thumb generally contains a sesamoid bone. END OF PART I. Wilson aiid Ogilvy, 57, Skinner Street, Snoivhil5, London.

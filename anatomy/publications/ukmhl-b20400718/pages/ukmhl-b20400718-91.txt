77 BACK OF THE FORE-ARM. subanconeus is in this respect analogous to the subcruraeus muscle of the thigh. Observe the bursa under the tendon, and the nume- rous arteries which ramify upon the back part of the capsule of the joint. Trace the continuation of the superior profunda artery (see § 40) and musculo-spiral nerve (see § 39) round the posterior part of the humerus. They lie close to the bone, and are protected by an aponeurotic arch thrown over them by the external head of the triceps: here the nerve is placed between the two principal branches of the artery. Observe the branches given off by the nerve to each of the three portions of the triceps, and follow the long branch of the superior profunda artery through the substance of the triceps to the olecranon. DISSECTION OF THE BACK OF THE FORE-ARM. 127. Remove the skin from the back of the fore-arm, hand, and fingers. Observe the subcutaneous bursa over the olecranon. It is commonly of considerable siz,e, and, if distended, would appear nearly as large as a walnut. Another bursa is sometimes found a little lower down upon the ulna. A subcutaneous bursa is generally placed over the internal condyle, and another over the external. A bursa is also situated over the styloid process of the ulna; this sometimes communicates with the sheath of the extensor carpi ulnaris. Small bursce are sometimes developed in the cellular tissue over each of the knuckles. The cutaneous veins from the back of the hand and fore-arm join the venous plexus at the bend of the elbow (see § 45). 128. Subcutaneous nerves of the back of the fore-arm.—They are the external cutaneous branches of the musculo-spiral nerve, the posterior branch of the internal cutaneous nerve (see § 46), and slender filaments from the external cutaneous (see § 34). The greater number of these nerves may be traced down to the back of the wrist. 129. Subcutaneous nerves on the back of the hand, thumb, and fingers.—The skin on the back of the hand is united to the sub- jacent tendons by an abundance of loose cellular tissue, in which

DISSECTION OP THE BRAIN. 481 THE DISSECTION OF THE BRAIN. The most convenient manner of removing the brain is to cut through the scalp, across the top of the head, from one ear to the other, so that the anterior part of the scalp may be detached from the skull and pulled down over the face, and the posterior part over the back of the head. The skull-cap should then be taken off on a plane about half an inch above the supra-orbital ridges. It is better to saw only through the outer table of the skull, and to break through the inner with a chisel. In this way, the dura mater and the brain are least likely to be injured. Previous to the examination of the brain itself we shall give an account of the structure and uses of the three membranes by which it is surrounded,—namely, the dura mater, the arachnoid mem- brane, and the pia mater. Dura mater.—The first membrane exposed after the removal of the skull-cap is the dura mater; so called from the fanciful notion that it gave rise to all the other membranes in the body. It is remark- ably tough and fibrous, and should be considered rather as the lining membrane of the skull-cap than as a proper investment of the brain. It adheres very closely to the cranial bones, and serves as their internal periosteum ; for this reason it is more difficult to separate the skull-cap from it in early life, while the bones are in active growth, than in mature age. Numerous arteries ramify between the skull-cap and the dura mater; and the course of the chief branches may be distinctly traced by the grooves which they make in the bones. These arteries are very liable to be injured in fractures of the skull ; and hence it is that extravasation of blood between the skull and the dura mater is one of the common causes of compression of the brain. Of the arteries which ramify between the dura mater and the a A

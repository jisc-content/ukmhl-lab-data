418 FEMORAL GLANDS. THE DISSECTION OF THE THIGH. 1. An incision should be made along the bend of the thigh, from the spine of the ilium to that of the pubes; another, from the middle of the first, perpendicularly downwards for about six inches. We do not propose to commence, at once, the general dissection of the thigh, but to examine the special anatomy of the inguinal region. 2. Superficial fascia.— Reflecting the skin, we expose the sub- cutaneous adipose and cellular structure, of which the thickness varies according to the condition of the body. It is commonly described as being divisible into layers. The truth is, that any one who is dexterous with the scalpel can make as many layers as he pleases. Imbedded in it we find the superficial femoral absorbent glands, and numerous cutaneous vessels which ramify in different directions. One ascends over the surface of the abdomen, another towards the pubes, and a third towards the ilium; they are named accordingly the superficial epigastric, the superficial pudic, and the superficial circumflexa ilii arteries. All of them come from the femoral, and each is accompanied by one, or sometimes by two veins, which empty themselves, either directly into the femoral, or into the great cutaneous vein of the thigh, called the saphena. These superficial glands and vessels it should be our first object to display. 3. Femoral glands.—These are easily recognized, by their reddish-brown colour, imbedded in the subcutaneous tissue at the upper and front part of the thigh. They are generally situated close to a vein, but more especially along the outer side of the saphena. They vary in number and size, and are commonly oval, with the long axis vertical. In a well-injected subject we observe how freely they are supplied with blood-vessels; and this accounts for the rapidity with which they sometimes enlarge. They trans- mit the absorbents from nearly all parts of the lower extremity. In

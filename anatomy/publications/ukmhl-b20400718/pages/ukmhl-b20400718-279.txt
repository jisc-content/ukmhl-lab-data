DISSECTION OF THE ORBIT. 265 apex of the petrous portion of the temporal bone, makes its sigmoid curves, and then passes through the dura mater between the anterior clinoid process and the optic nerve : just in this situation it gives off the ophthalmic artery. 190. Cavernous plexus.—The superior cervical ganglion of the sympathetic sends up with the carotid artery two or more slender filaments, which form a plexus round it in its tortuous course through the petrous bone, and by the side of the sphenoid. After a careful dissection we may discover with the naked eye in this plexus very small ganglia called carotid or cavernous: but they vary in number, size, and situation. Through these nerves a communication is established between the sympathetic and many of the nerves which enter the orbit. Presuming that the bony framework of the orbit and the several openings in it be thoroughly understood, we propose to examine its contents, in the order in which they appear, commencing from the roof of the cavity. DISSECTION OF THE ORBIT. 191. The roof of the orbit should be taken off by two vertical cuts made with a fine saw; the one commencing a little on the outer side of the internal angular process of the frontal bone, in order to avoid injuring the beautiful little pulley there attached ; the other a little on the inner side of the external angular process. With a bone forceps, .the thin roof of the oibit should then be removed as far back as the optic foramen; and it is easy to do this without injuring the orbital periosteum, on account of its loose connexion with the bone. 192. Periosteum of the orbit.—The roof being removed, the first thing exposed is the thick fibrous membrane which lines the bony walls of the orbit. It is usually considered as a continuation of the dura mater through the optic foramen and the sphenoidal fissure. If it be traced forwards, we find that near the margin of the orbit it divides into two layers, one of which is directly con-

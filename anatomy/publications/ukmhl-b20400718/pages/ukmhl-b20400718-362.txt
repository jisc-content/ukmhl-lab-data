DISSECTION OP THE PELVIS. 448 passes beneath the crural arch, and is finally distributed to the skin on the outside of the thigh. c. The genito-crural nerve is but of small size, and generally comes from the second lumbar. After perforating the psoas, it descends along the outer side of the external iliac artery, and near the crural arch divides into the genital branch, which runs through the inguinal canal, and is lost in the cremaster muscle,—and the crural, which proceeds under the crural arch, and is lost in the skin of the upper part of the thigh. d. The anterior crural is the largest and most important branch of the plexus, and is generally formed by the union of the third and fourth lumbar nerves. It descends in a groove between the psoas and the iliacus, supplies both these muscles, and then, passing under the crural arch,, is finally distributed to the extensor muscles and the skin of the thigh. c. The obturator nerve. — This is also of considerable size, though less than the preceding. It proceeds from the third and fourth lumbar nerves, descends rather below the brim of the pelvis to the obturator foramen, and is finally distributed to the adductor muscles of the thigh. Postponing, for the present, the minute anatomy of the abdo- minal viscera, let us begin the examination of the contents of the pelvis. DISSECTION OF THE PELVIS. 40. We would first remind the reader of the general purposes served by the pelvis, and, what is of still more practical im- portance, the direction of its axis. Now the general purpose of the pelvis is to protect its own viscera, and to support those of the abdomen ; to give attachment to the several muscles which steady the trunk; and to transmit the weight of the trunk to the lower limbs in such a manner that, though they support the body, yet they can freely move. In adapta- tion to these purposes, the form of the pelvis is that of a perfect arch, with broadly expanded wings at the sides, and projections in

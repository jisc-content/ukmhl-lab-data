PKAMEWORK OP THE CHEST. 190 of their delicacy of structure " nervi molles," ramify around the external carotid artery and its branches. B. Middle cervical ganglion.—This is usually in size something less than a flattened barley-corn. It is situated behind the carotid sheath, about the fifth or sixth cervical vertebra, near the inferior thyroid artery. It receives branches from the fifth and sixth spinal nerves, and gives off— a. Branches to the thyroid body.—These accompany the inferior thyroid artery. b. Branch to the heart.—This usually descends in front of the subclavian artery into the chest. It often communicates with the recurrent laryngeal nerve. This ganglion, called by Soemmering " ganglion thyroideum," is, according to our observation, more frequently absent than pre- sent. In the cases where it is absent, the preceding nerves are supplied by the sympathetic cord connecting the superior and inferior ganglia. C. Inferior cervical ganglion.—This is commonly semilunar in form, and is situated in the interval between the transverse process of the seventh cervical vertebra and the first rib, immediately behind the vertebral artery. It receives branches from the seventh and eighth spinal nerves, and others which, descending from the fourth, fifth, and sixth, through the foramina in the transverse processes of the vertebrae, form a plexus around the vertebral artery. The only branch which it gives off is—■ a. Inferior cardiac nerve.—This descends, communicating often with the recurrent laryngeal, and joins the deep cardiac plexus behind the arch of the aorta. DISSECTION OF THE CHEST. 93. Before we proceed to examine the several organs contained in the chest, we ought to have some knowledge of the frame-work of this cavity. The true ribs with their cartilages desci'ibe a series of arcs, successively increasing in length from above downwards, so as to form, with the spine and the sternum, a barrel of a somewhat

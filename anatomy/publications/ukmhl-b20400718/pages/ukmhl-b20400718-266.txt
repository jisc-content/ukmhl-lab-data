252 MUSCLES OF THE LARYNX. mucous membrane. Some of them run near the free margin of the fold, others are found much lower down. These, being thinly distributed over the ventricle of the larynx, are able so to approxi- mate its walls as almost to obliterate the cavity. Hence the name " compressor sacculi laryngis," given to this part of the muscle by the anatomist* who first drew attention to it. The following table, taken from a paper by Professor Willis,f shews at a glance the action of the several muscles which act upon the glottis :— Crico-Thyroidei ......... Stretch the Vocal Cords \ Thyro-Arytenoidei Relax the Vocal Cords, and place them in the vocalizing position Crico-arytenoidei postici . Open the glottis Crico-arytenoidei laterales Draw together the ary- tenoid cartilages Arytenoideus Ditto Ditto Govern the pitch of the notes. Together close the glottis Govern the aperture of the glottis. The larynx should now be laid open by making a longitudinal incision along the middle of its posterior part. A complete view will thus be obtained of the true and the false vocal cords, and the ventricles between them. By carefully dissecting the mucous membrane from the lips of the glottis, we expose the elastic struc- ture of the vocal cords; we notice also the thyro-arytenoideus muscle below them, the direction of its fibres, and the mode in which they are inserted. We see that they run parallel with the vocal cords, and that they are closely connected to them, so that the tendency of their action will be to bring the lips of the glottis parallel to each other, and consequently to place them in the vocalizing position. 168. Vessels of the larynx.—These are derived from the superior and inferior thyroid arteries. The laryngeal branch of the superior thyroid (see § 31, b.) passes through the thyro-hyoid membrane * Hilton, Guy's Hospital Reports, Vol. ii. f Cambridge Philosophical Transactions, 1832.

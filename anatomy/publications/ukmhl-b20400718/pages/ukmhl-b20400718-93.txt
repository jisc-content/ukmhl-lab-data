BACK OF THE FOKE-AUM. 79 are connected with the pisiform bone and the anterior annular liga- ment of the carpus. Observe that they pass below the styloid process of the ulna, to which they are in no way attached, other- wise the rotation of the radius would be impeded. From the deep surface of this so-called ligament, processes are attached to the ridges on the back of the radius, so as to form as many as six distinct sheaths for the passage of the extensor tendons. Counting from the radius towards the ulna, the first sheath con- tains the tendons of the extensor ossis metacarpi and the extensor primi internodii pollicis; the second contains the tendons of the extensor carpi radialis longior and brevior; the third contains the tendon of the extensor secundi internodii pollicis; the fourth con- tains the tendons of the indicator and the extensor communis digitorum; the fifth contains the tendon of the extensor minimi digiti; and the sixth, the tendon of the extensor carpi ulnaris. All the sheaths are lined by synovial membranes, to facilitate the play of the tendons. In a few instances, one or more of them communicate with the wrist-joint. The fascia of the metacarpus consists of a thin fibrous layer continued from the posterior annular ligament. It separates the extensor tendons from the subcutaneous veins and nerves, and is attached to the radial side of the second metacarpal bone, and the ulnar side of the fifth. 131. Superficial muscles on the back of (he fore-arm.—The fascia must be removed from the muscles, so far as this can be done without injuring the muscular fibres which arise from its under surface. Preserve the posterior annular ligament. The following muscles are now exposed, and should be examined in the order in. which they are placed, proceeding from the radial to the ulnar side of the lore-arm :— The supinator radii longus (already described, § 54). The extensor carpi radialis longior. The extensor carpi radialis brevior. The extensor communis digitorum. The extensor minimi digiti. The extensor carpi ulnaris. The anconeus.

9 gitied. It teaclies us tliat the ultimate elements of Organized Bodies are found also in Unorganized bodies: that Oxygen, Hydrogen, Nitrogen, .Ik and Carbon, which almost alone compose and are the essential ultimate elements of the whole Vegetable and Animal kingdoms, do not consti- tute an absolute, distinctive difference between these and the Mineral world, because they all exist in the latter. It is true they are not in the same state: as, in the Mineral kingdom, Nitrogen is, probably, always, in combination so as to form Ammonia; and in the Atmosphere, (which we may with propriety consider, as Blainville does, one of the substances common to and pervading all matter. Water being the other) it is, at least, in mixture with other elastic fluids. Carbon, too, is scarcely ever found there, except in combination with Oxygen, and through it, with other elements, as in this Carbonate of Lime. The aggregate number of ultimate elements in all, and the particular number combined in each of the Bodies of the three kingdoms ; their state of combination; the kind of matter they constitute, or intimate structure; and the external form, mode of origin, growth and decay of these Bodies themselves, will afford us, by contrast, the best possible knowledge of the nature of Organized Beings. In these last, taken aggregately, the number of ultimate or sim- ple elements is very small; they are only Oxygen, Hydrogen, Nitro- gen, and Carbon, (which four may, perhaps, be considered their essential elements) Sulphur, Phosphorus, and one or two others, (probably rather adventitious than essential:) whereas, all these, and upwards of forty more exist in the Unorganized kingdom. The combination of elements in the latter is often only binary, and, at most, ternary. This Flint, like many other Bodies on the surface of the earth, is composed of only two elements—Oxygen and Silicium, and this Magnesite of three—Oxygen, Magnesium, and Carbon ; and, the mode of combination is such, that the combustible elements are com- pletely saturated with Oxygen: In other words, they are completely burnt, and all have yielded to the strongest possible affinity which could operate on them; hence, the difficulty of disuniting them, or the solidity and resistance to decomposition of Unorganized Bodies. In Organized Bodies, on the contrary, the combinations are scarcely ever less than ternary or quarternary ; and here, from the sum of affinity, if I may so express it, being divided among a greater number of elements, and from the combustible ones being less saturated with Oxygen, we find

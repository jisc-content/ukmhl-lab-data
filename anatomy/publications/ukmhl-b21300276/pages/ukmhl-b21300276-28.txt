If Anatomy teaches us the intimate struc- ture of Oi'gans, the information which it gives cannot be over-rated, because it furnishes us with the only means of detecting the existence and nature of diseases; and but for the valuable facts which have been eluci- dated by post mortem examinations, the errors of Theoretical Medicine would have still prevailed, to the great retaj'dation of true science, and the injury of society. Such researches to be profitable, must pre- suppose an apquaintance with the appearance of parts in a healthy and natural state, without which, morbid changes cannot be detected. We must not draw an inference in favour of the inutility of Anatomy to the Physician, from observing that some men practice with great success, although possessed only of a scanty share of this kind of knowledge, for there are very fcAv indeed of this description ; and if the argument were valid, similar instances are not Avanting in the field of Surgery, for there are Empirics in both professions; every neighbourhood has its pretenders to effect what can only be safely attempted by the hand of Science ; and if the extent of opportunity, and the cures reported to have been performed were just criteria forjudging of ability and skill, very few can cope with the

327 formed by the bifurcation of tlie common median yeirt. On tlie median cephalic, and median basilic are seen some fihiments from the external and internal cutane- ous nerves, and nnder the median basilic lies the bra- chial artery, but separated from it by an intervening fascia. The artery, vein, and median nerve are on the imier edge of the biceps tendon. It will be evident to the student after examining- the relation of the cutaneous veins to the artery, that there is some danger in opening the median basilic vein without care, because the artery is beneath it; but as varieties are constantly occurring in the branching off of the sujicrficial veins, and in the course of the brachial artery and its division, it is never prudent to bleed in either of the veins without first ascertaining' whether any arteiy is in danger of being wounded. In two of the subjects received into my dissecting-room last winter, there Avere varieties in the distribution Of the arteries of the arm. In one, the brachial artery divided into the radial and idnar branches a little below the axilla; the radial branch descended behind the median basilic vein, taking the same course that the brachial artery ordinarily does. In the other, the bifurcation took place about the middle of the arm, and the radial branch passed downwards, immediately by the side of the cephalic median, and quite as super- ficial as the vein. Here a wound of the radial artery would have been endangered in bleeding from what is commonly the safest vein, because it is very distant

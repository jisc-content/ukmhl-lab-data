369 Deal, instead of being spent about tbe ankle, was con- tinued over the dorsum of the foot, and supplied the place of the anterior tibial vessel. This discovery in- duced the surgeon to suppose, that in the case above related, the arteries were mal-distributed in a similar way, and was employed to explain why the bleeding was not checked, when the anterior tibial artery was tied. In the last edition, I objected to this explanation of the fact, and substituted for it the probability that the inferior part of the vessel was fed by anastomo- sing branches, as the mal-distribution alluded to was extremely rare, since I could not find a similar ano- maly in any anatomical work. A short time ago, how- ever, I perused Dr. Barclay's valuable little work on the Arteries, in which I found mentioned, that the late Mr. Allan Burns, of Glasgow, communicated to the author, an account of his having seen the anterior tibial artery wanting in two subjects, and that the arte- ria peronea antica supplied its place in the dorsum of the foot. These cases bear an analogy to the instance above cited; but still an opinion, founded on the possibility of such an anomaly, cannot be admitted in preference to that, founded on the basis of anatomy. I might have extended my observations on the importance of studying the Arterial Anastomoses, and the application of this branch of knowledge to the ti eat- ment of Aneurism and Haemonhage; but it is incom- 2z

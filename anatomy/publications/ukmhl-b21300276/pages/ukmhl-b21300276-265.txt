241 for reaching; it, would be that recommended by Mr. Coleman; not, however, for the purpose we are now considering', but for artificial respiration. It is, to divide the thjToid cartilage by a longitudinal incision ; an union of which, afterwards, is said to be as com- pletely effected, as if the trachea itself were cut; this operation is called laryngotomy. If the body had freely passed into the wind-pipe, and from being of a rounded form was capable of being carried up and down in that passage by the air, I think tracheotomy would be preferable to lai-yngo- tomy, and my ground of preference is founded on the experiment of Favier, related by Burns, which is, that when a pea was fairly jjut into the trachea of a dog, and an opening made into the wind-pipe below flie thyroid gland, the pea was raised by the force of the air expelled from the lungs, and thrown out by the wound; and this took place as often as the foreign substance was put into the wind-pipe. This might happen from the proximity of the opening to the bronchi; but the pea. would not, I presume, have so readily made its exit through an apertm-e in the larynx, as the edges would not be so far separable without danger, as the divided rings of the trachea are ; and independent of this circumstance, the body would be more likely to escape during a forcible expi-. ration, as it would meet with no obsti'uction until it arrived at the rima glottidis. 2 H

292 tion between the sacrum and ossa innoniinata, and flatten the bones; but a fracture would be likely to occur at the same time. The danger of this accident would be in proportion to the injur}', which the pelvic viscera sustained by the crush. After the student has made himself acquainted with the prominent parts of the pelvis, he must observe its axis with regard to the trunk, and that of its brim, cavity, and outlet with respect to each other, for the viscera partake of the same bearing as the cavity in which they lie. He must then notice the changes which take place in its axis, in the different positions of the body, as when the body is erect; when the thighs are partially bent; and when approximated to the ab- domen as in the position of the patient for lithotomy ; it will be found that these different postures vary the position of parts in a notable degree. When the Sui-geon ties the legs of his patient, and bends them towards the abdomen, the axis of the pelvis, and that of the trunk, are brought nearly to correspond : every deviation from this position causes a change of axis; and when the thighs and legs are extended, the pelvis is placed at a considerable angle. The soft parts which line tlie pelvic cavity, ai-e the next subject of inquiiy; some of them can be shown without interfering with the viscera; but those of the outlet must be examined in another stage of the dissection.

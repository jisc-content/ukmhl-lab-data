348 be carefully cut, and pushed upwards with the haudlc of the knife, a thin iuscia will he seen lining tlie posterior surface of the latter nmscle; it is the fascia transversalis of Cooper. Below, it is firmly attached to Por.part's ligament, and the pubis; and passing upwards, we find it between the posterior surface of the transversalis, and the peritoneum. In this fascia, is the internal abdominal ring, by which the cord leaves the abdomen. The tendons of the intenial oblique, and transversalis, are not then perfo- rated for the passage of the cord, for the opening is in the fascia above mentioned, and the tendons of these muscles form, as it were, an arch over the cord. In tracing the cord, the student will observe it, in what is called the inguinal canal, viz.â€”that space between the two rings; that it is here situated behind the apo- neurosis of the external oblique; and that it passes under the edges of the internal oblique, and trans- versalis muscles. At the internal abdominal ring, (which is not a well defined opening, without breaking down the cellular membrane about it,) the spermatic cord is formed ; and behind the i-ing is the peritoneum, Avhich lines the abdominal cavity; it is important to bear this in mind, as it explains the nature of the hernial sac. In the dissection, the student nnist observe the epigastric artery. It arises from the external iliac, and passes upwards, and inwards, towards the rectus muscle; it is situated a little on the inner side of the

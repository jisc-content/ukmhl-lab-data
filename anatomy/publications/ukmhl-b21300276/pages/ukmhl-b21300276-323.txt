295 rectum, and attaches this portion of intestine to the venter sacri, by a process called meso-rectuni. The neck of tlie bladder, then, and inferior part of the rectum, ai-e not covered with peritoneum; there is left a triangular space, the apex of which is formed by the prostate gland, and the sides by the vesiculae seminales; it is in this space that we puncture the bladder from the rectum, in retention of urine, where less formidable means have been had recourse to with- out effect. The opening is made in a dependent situa- tion, and without the risk of wounding the peritoneum. The perinasum is now to be dissected. In reflect- ing the integuments, the student must pay attention to tlie dense fascia of this part, which is the cause of the distressing consequences of a suppuration in periuaeo, and explains why abscesses, in this situation, are so much disposed to become fistulous. When matter forms, it cannot easily determine itself to the surface, on account of the great thickness of the anterior wall of the abscess; the pus, therefore, burrows amongst the loose cellular membrane, and gives rise to extensive mischief To obviate this effect, it is requii-ed that we should make an early opening with a lancet. Having exposed the muscles of the perinffium, the arteries, the bulb of tlie m*ethra, the membranous por- tion of the canal, the prostate gland, and the connec- tion of all these parts to the rectum; the student must apply his Anatomy to surgical purposes. He must

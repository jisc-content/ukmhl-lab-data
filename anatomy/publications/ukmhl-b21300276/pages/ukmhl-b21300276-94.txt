70 ing, hiccup, and laughing, are 8ymi)athetic affections of these organs. In speaking of the circulation, we said, that the blood passed from the venae cavae into the right auricle; from the right auricle into the right ventricle; and from thence to the lungs by the pulmonary artery. The ultimate branches of the pulmonary artery ramify on the parietes of the air cells; anastomose freely with each other; and terminate in the radicles of the pul- monary veins. The pulmonary veins unite, and form at length four considerable trmiks, which empty them- selves into the left amicle of the heart. Seeing, then, that the blood circulates through the lungs 'ere it goes from the venous to the arterial system, it is reasonable to inquire into the necessity for tliis. If we observe the blood in the right cavities of the heart, and compare it with that in the left, we shall find a great difference in the colour and pro- perties of the two. That in the former is what we call venous blood, or blood that has circulated throughout the body, and lost, from that circumstance, a part of its old properties, and acquired new ones. It is of a very dark crimson colour, in consequence of having absorbed a quantity of carbon. That in the latter is arterial blood, or blood deprived of its carbo- naceous qualities ; hence, of a lighter, and more florid, colour. Knowing that the change takes place in the lungs, we must, of course, ascribe it to respiration,

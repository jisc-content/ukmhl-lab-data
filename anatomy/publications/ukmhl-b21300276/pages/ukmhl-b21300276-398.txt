370 patible with the design of this volume, to enlarge on one point only of Surgical Anatomy; and I therefore must beg to refer the student for further detail, to mv " Practical Treatise on the Arterial Spstem." Ex- perience has proved, that Hunter's operation in aneurism is the only method that can be relied on: but the inquiring student will <jot rest satisfied with being told, that placing a ligatiu"e on the artery above the aneurismal swelling, will cure the disease; he will ask how it operates? and what are the resources of Nature when the main channel of the blood is thus obstructed ? It is not difficult to reply to the first of these questions; and the second may be easily answered, if it be under- stood that some of the branches of arteries communi- cate with each other, and that it is by these com- munications the circulation is continued, when the principal vessel of the limb is rendered impervious by ligature, accident, or disease. The study of the Anastomoses will moreover teach him, that the apprehension which some entertain, that the inosculating branches, in certain situations, are not sufficient to support the life of the part, is entirely gi'oundless; excepting in one case, viz.—when the aorta is obstructed by ligature at any point of its course between its origin and the passing off of the lumbar branches. 2dly.—That more is to be feared from their being abundant, than from their being few in number. 3dly.—That if the aneurism be of the common kind, it is reasonable to expect that the ope-

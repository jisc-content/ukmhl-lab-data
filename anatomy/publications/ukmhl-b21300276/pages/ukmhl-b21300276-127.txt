103 The aqueous humour occupies the chambers of the eye, or that space situated between the cornea before, and the capsule of the crystalline lens behind. The vessels of the ii'is are supposed to secrete it. This fluid is a very powei-ful solvent; but chemical analysis goes no way towards explaining the reason of it; since it is nothing more than albumen, gelatin, water, and a little common salt. The crystalline lens is a solid substance; but we are in the habit of classing it amongst the humours of the eye. A fluid, however, is contained in its capsule. The lens refracts, and transmits the rays of light to the vitreous humour. The vitreous humour forms the greatest part of the eye; the crystalline lens is received into a depression on its anterior surface; and posteriorly, and laterally, the retina is expanded on it. It is com- posed of a watery fluid enclosed in cells; and the whole is surromided by a membrane, called tunica hyaloidea, vitx'ea, vel aranea. The vitreous humour refracts the rays of light, in thefr transmission to the retina. Thepigmentum nigrum is secreted by the vessels of the choroid coat. Its use is to absorb the rays, which, if admitted to the retina in superfluous quantity, would cause confusion in vision. I

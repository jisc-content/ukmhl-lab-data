115 The nerves take their origin from two som-ces; the brain, and spinal marrow. Those from the former are called, the cerebral nerves; and those from the latter, the spinal nerves, which are divided into cer- vical, lumbar, dorsal, and sacral. The cerebral nerves are, 1— Olfactorii, 2— Optici, 3— Motores oculorum, 4— Pathetici, 5— Trigemini, 6— Abducentes, 7— Auditorii, 8— Faciales, 9— Glosso Pharyngei, 10— Pneumo- G astrici, 11— Linguales. The name given to each of the above paii's, with with the exception of two or three, will lead us to infer their respective distribution and uses. They supply the organs and parts connected with the head and face, the pneumo-gastrici excepted. The nerves which supply the organs of the thorax, abdomen, and pelvis, are the pneumo-gas- trici before-mentioned, and the nervi sympathetici. Each nervus pneumo-gastricus arises from the side of the crus cerebelli, and from a fissiu-e observed

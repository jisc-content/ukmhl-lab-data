224 affections of the brain. When the jugular vein is to be opened, the incision is to be made in the direction of the fibres of the platysnia myoides muscle, and at the part where it passes over the body of the stemo cleido mastoideus; the current of blood towards the heart being, of course, intercepted by means of pressure. Having reflected the platysma myoides muscle towards the jaw, (in doing which, the student must avoid the twigs of nerves which come off from the second, and third cervical branches,) the dissector will find underneath it much cellular structure, in which are embedded numerous absorbent glands. This structure insinuates itself between the muscles, vessels, and nerves of the neck. In a natural state, it is tolerably dense and strong; but by compressing causes, as the enlaigement of glands, abscess, and aneui'ism, it takes on a veiy considerable thickness. Yet, in the neck, the cellular fascia is not so compact, either under natural or diseased circumstances, as it is in some other parts of the body. The student will now proceed with the dissection of the deeper seated parts. He will first expose the sterno cleido mastoideus muscle throughout its whole course; then the omo hyoideus, the sterno hyoideus, and sterno thyroideus. If the sterno cleido mastoideus be drawn to the outer side, and the omo hyoideus pulled towards the trachea, the sheath of the vessels will be ex- posed ; exterior to it, will be seen the nei-vus descendens

222 that in the operation of tying the common carotid, our guide to the seat of the vessel, is the inner edge of the stemo cleido inastoideus. A knowledge of the place where the sterno cleido and omo hyoideus muscles meet, which is to be ascertained by drawing two lines, one from the anterior part of the mastoid process of the temporal bone, to the centre of the upper bone of the sternum; the other from the cornu of the os hyoides to the clavicle, about an inch and a half from its junction with the sternum; will almost infallibly lead us to the seat of the carotid artery, where it can be most easily secured by ligature. This relation of the external parts to the carotid, applies equally to the nervus desceudens noni, the internal jugular vein, and par vagum, for the descendens noni lic,^ upon the sheath; and the internal jugular vein, and par vagum, are contained in the same common cellular envelope as the artery ; but how placed with regard to it, is a point hereafter to be described. The fore part of the neck having been rendered tense, the following cii'cumstances must be attended to in the dissection. The first incision is to be made through the skin, in the direction of the fibres of the thin layer of muscle called the platysma myoides, which in some subjects is so pale and indistinct as not to be easily recognized as muscular. The fibres run from the base of the jaw obliquely outwards, and downwards over the neck, clavicle, and upper part of the thorax.

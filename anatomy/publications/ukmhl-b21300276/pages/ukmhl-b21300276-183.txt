1^9 Each corpus cavernosum arises ^rom the ramus pubis, ascends, aud meets tlie opposite body; the two bodies then unite, and pass to the glans penis, to which their extremities are applied. By their junc- tion a groove is left above, for the arteria dorsalis, and vena magna ipsius penis ; and below, is another fuiTow for the corpus spongiosum. Between the two corpora cavernosa there is a paitition, called the septum penis, but it is perforated, so that the cells in one corpus freely communicate with those of the other. The corpus spongiosum begins at the bulb of the urethra, and terminates in the expansion called glans. The prominent ring at the commencement of the' glans is named the corona glandis, and the contracted pai-t behind is the cervix. About the corona and cervix there are many small follicles, which secrete a sebaceous matter to defend the glans, and to facilitate' the motion of the prepuce backwards and forwards. The three corpora of the penis ai-e cellular in struc- ture, as inflation proves, but the cells of the corpus spongiosum are more delicate than those of the cor- pora cavernosa. The Organs of Re-production in the Fe- male are divided into external and internal. The external are, the mons Veneris, labia, pu-

For the illustrations of Mr. Bell's theory, I shall refer the reader to his Papers, published in the " Journal of Science and Arts,'' the " Philosopliical Transactions of the Royal Societi/,'" and elsewhere. On the whole, we must consider the theory as ingenious; and the inves- tigations which Mr. Bell and Mr. Shaw are engaged in, as likely to lead to an extension of our knowledge of the functions of the nervous system. Additional evidence in favour of their opinion, has been afforded by some experiments made by S. D. Brougton, Esq. and of which an account is given in the " Medical and Physical Journal,''' for June, 1823, The brain, the spinal marrow, and the nerves, are the organs of sensation in general, sensation being a generic term; but the species of this faculty require particular organs in order to convey to the mind, the different impressions which extemal objects are capable of making; thus, the eye is necessary to impress an idea of distance, and colour; the ear, to distinguish sounds; the nose, to detect the presence of odours; the tongue, to ascertain the savour of bodies; and the papillae of the cutis vera, to discover the qualities of hardness, softness, smoothness, rough- ness, heat, and cold.

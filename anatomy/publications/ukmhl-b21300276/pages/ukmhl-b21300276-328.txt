The shortest line is from the pro- tuberance of one parietal boue to the other, which is not more than tliree inches. It will be obvious by this comparison of the admeasurements of the pelvis, and the child's head, that there is ample room for the latter to pass'throui^h the apertures of the former, without the least com- pression of the bones; but how is the deliver}' accom- plished when the pelvis measures, from sacrum to pubis, very much less than natural? Dr. Merriman tells us, in his " Synop&is of Dif- jicult Parturition,^^ that Dr. Osborne, who took great pains in investi2:ating the best method of proce- tlure in cases of distorted pelvis, considers that a foetus, at full maturity, cannot pass alive, if the dimensions of the pelvis from the pubes to the projection of the sacrum, be only two inches and three quarters; atid Dr. Clarke, of Dublin, says, that three inches and a quarter, from the pubis to the sacrum, is the least diameter through which he has known a fullrgrown foetus to pass entire; but as it has been ascertained by Dr. Hamilton, that children have been born living, through a pelvis in which this diameter was " mani- festly under three inches," it is necessary that practi- tioners of undwifery should be very much upon theii- guaid agaiust being deceived in their estimate of the

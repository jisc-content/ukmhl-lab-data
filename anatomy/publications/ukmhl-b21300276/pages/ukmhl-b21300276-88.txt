64 extremities, end in the vena cava superior; those of the lower extremities, abdomen, and thorax, in the vena cava inferior; those of the heart, in tlie coronary veins; and those of the hmgs, in the four pulmonary veins, which terminate in the left auricle of the heart. The veins may be divided into two sets : the cutaneous, and deep; the latter set, for the most part, accom- panies the arteries. Between the two sets, there are very free communications; a fact well demonstrated by the effect of grasping, at the time of bleeding from the ai-m; when the blood does not flow from the orifice with freedom, it is usual to direct the patient to clench his fist, or move his fingers; on doing which, the blood issues freely. The explanation of this is, that when the muscles are in action, their bellies swell, and compress the deep seated veins; by which, ;he blood is driven into the superficial ones. The veins, like the arteries, have tliree coats; but they are all much thinner; hence, the difference in the thickness of the walls of the two orders of vessels. But the veins of the extremities differ from arteries, in having valves, which serve to support the column of blood; this, if allowed to gravitate, would be an almost insuperable obstacle to the circulation in the extreme veins, which is principally of a vis a tergo kind. When the valves do not perform their functions well, that knotted appearance of the veins, known by the name of varix, takes place, and is productive often of serious inconvenience.

ON THE HUMAN BODY. The Human Body is composed of organs, and parts, destined to perform the variety of functions essential to the life which it enjoys. Some axe imme- diately subservient to the facidty of loco-motion, viz. â€”the bones, cartilag-es, ligaments, and muscles. In addition to this office, the bones support the soft parts, and defend the vital organs (as the brain, heart, and lungs) from external injury; and muscles, besides being the active agents of transporting the body from place to place, and of executing the different motions of the trunk, extremities, and other pai'ts, operate the movements of the important viscera. A digestive sys- tem is given to the body, to prepare the materials for its nuti'ition; a cii-culating system to carry nourish- ment to the different structures; secreting organs to form certain fluids, some of which fulfil important purposes in the animal ceconomy; a nervous system for sensation, volition and sympathy; a reproductive system, for continuing the species; and cellular and other tissues, for the union and connexion of the whole. Thus the human body is constituted of many systems, not insulated, but essentially dependent; and we see in them, a wise and admirable adaptation of parts, to their intended uses.

126 The power which the eye has, of adapting itself to distances, is, by some Physiologists, ascribed to the recti muscles compressing the ball of the eye, and changing its conformation. To view objects placed at different distances, either the whole, or some pait of this organ, must have the ability to undergo changes, in order to adjust the focal point; for the rays of light which reach the eye from a near, and those from a distant object, could not converge at the retina, the seat of vision, without some alteration; either in the length of the axis; in the foi-m of the cornea; in the position of the other refracting media; or in the situation of the retina itself. If we suppose that the four straight muscles can compress the scle- rotic coat sufficiently to alter the axis, or to push for- wards the humours, and thereby to increase in a mate- rial degree, the convexity of the cornea, we need not seek for other means of accounting for the adjustment of the eye to distances; but it is far fi"om being certain that the muscles have this compressing effect, to the adequate extent, even in the human eye; and certainly not in such animals as have the tunica sclerotica of considerable thickness. The axis of the eye, or the form of the coniea, then, are not likely to be much altered by the action of the four recti muscles; but comparative Anatomy furnishes us with a fact, which proves that the cornea may be one of the instruments of adaptation; for Mr. Crampton informs vs, in the " Annals of Philosophy," that he has demonstrated the existence of a muscle in birds, capable of changing

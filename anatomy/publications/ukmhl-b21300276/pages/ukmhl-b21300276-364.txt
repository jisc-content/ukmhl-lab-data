336 muscles ai-e inserted, wliich muscles act on the tibia, and produce the extension of the leg upon the thigh. Internally, we find the alar and crucial ligaments, and some transverse ligamentous bands uniting the two semilunar cartilages. As there are no massy soft parts surroimding this articulation, we can readily discover the alterations produced in it, by accident and disease. The superficial nature of the knee-joint predis- poses it much to dislocation, and from being more ex- posed to violence from falls, than any other articula- tion, this accident is not of unfrequent occurrence, the patella, however, is oftener displaced from its situation, than the tibia is from the articulator^ surfaces of the femur. The leg consists or two bones, the tibia, and fibula; the tibia is articulated with the femur above, and with the astragalus below. The fibula is articu- lated above with the tibia, therefore is not at all con- nected with the knee-joint. At the ankle-joint we find three bones, the tibia, the fibula, and the astra- galus. The tarsal bone, called astragalus, has an articulatory surface for each of the bones of the leg^ Scarcely any other motions are allowed at the ankle, besides flexion and extension. Although this articulation is rendered exceedingly strong by capsular and other ligaments, it is, next to the shoulder-joint, the most liable to dislocation; and

13 from objeclions in all its bearings; yet, as affording; the fundamentiil distinctions of Physiology, it is re^ariled as the most perfect system of the schools. After observinjr that Life is " V ensemble des fonc- tioiis qui resistent a la Mart,'' which cannot be consi- dered as a definition of the thing itself, Bichat points out t\yo remarkable modifications of this principle;— one common both to Vegetables and Animals,—the other, peculiar to Animals. Upon these distinctions he founds a classification of our functions; those which we have iu common with Vegetables, he calls the functions of Automatic or Organic Life, from being common to all organised matter. Those, on the other hand, which are proper to Animals, he names the fimctions of Animal Life. By the organic functions only, an existence could be supported, because they are sufficient for vital purposes, from being subser- vient to nutrition and secretion; but the relation which Animals have to external objects, renders it necessary that they should have the functions of Ani- mal Life, such as Seeing, Hearing, Smelling, Tast- ing, and Touching, the power to reflect, to judge, and to will. It is true, Bichat gives us no real infor- mation on the principle of Life, nor does any other Physiologist; but that has not proved a barrier to the investigation of its laws. Buchan, the author of " BiONOMiA," remarks,—" tlie cause of gravitation remains unknown, but ignorance of that cause has been found no bar to the improvement of Physical Astronomy, which, founded upon the acknowledged I

144 water conducts them to the pulpy expansion of the auditory nerve. Soimd, like light, may be collected to a point, and thus its audibility is increased; on this principle, wliis- pering- galleries are constructed; and this property of sound suggested the invention of the " stethoscope " of IMonsieur Laeimec, an instrument employed for exploring the nature of thoracic diseases, and which has recently been proposed by Lisfranc, as a useful method of distinguishing the seats of fractures. We shall allude to this instrument in a future part of the volume. Sound like light, too, may be reflected; of which an echo is an illustration. The above ciicuni- stances connected with sound, viz.â€”its media of con- veyance ; its concentration; and its capability of reflection, aie all, more or less, concerned in the Physiology of the ear. The trumpet-like opening of the auiicle, is well calculated to receive the sonorous rays; and by its irregularities, they are directed on the principle of reflection, to the meatus auditorius extemus, by which they are amassed into a narrow compass, and there- fore, strike with force on the membrana tympani, which they set in motion. But to produce the neces- sary oscillation of this membrane, there must be a cun-eut of air behind, as well as before it; and this is

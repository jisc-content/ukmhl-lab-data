He will then be prepared to consider the detached suroical views which I shall now give him. When we were engaged in the Anatomy of the neck, we omitted to describe a triangular space, formed, on the inner side, by the outer edge of the sterno cleido mastoideus; on the outer side, by the external edge of the trapezius; and below, by the clavicle; because it was not connected with the vessels of the neck, but with the artery and nerves which supply the ujiper extremity. Having reflected a triangular portion of integu- ment, corresponding with the form of this space, the platysma myoides muscle will be exposed; under it, is the cervical fascia, and deeper still, we find much loose cellular structure. This last is to be carefidly dissected away, in order to show the subclavian artei-y, and vein, and the cei vieal nerves, which go to form the axillary plexus.

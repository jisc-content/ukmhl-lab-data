â€¢202 outer, OT molar wall is thick; the inner,' or nasal, is exceeding-ly thin. We have already said, that the antrum, as well as the other sinuses of the bones of the head, is lined by a membrane similar to the pituitary; the office of which is to secrete a mucous fluid to bedew their surfaces. Should this fluid be secreted in too great abundance, by the reflection of the membrane which covers the frontal, the sphenoidal, and the ethmoidal sinuses, or the nostrils, we can easily conceive how the superabundance is got rid off, as it ean be evacuated by the nose; but when the secretion is in excess in the antrum, the mode of escape is not so easy. True it is, that a communication exists with the nose; but the opening is small, and its mechanism such, as to olfer a valvular obstmction. Mr. Bums says, " Urine might as readily regui-gitate fi'om the bladder along the ureter, as fluid pass fi-om the antium into the nosebut, perhaps, the analogy is here carried too far; yet it is certain, that when by disease, or accident, the membrane becomes swollen, or thickened, the obstruction is complete. When there is a preternatural accumulation of fluid, whether mucus, or pus, in this cavity, we are not to expect that that mucus, or pus, will find an exit by the nose; how then is it to be dischaiged? It is to be done by forming a new passage, by extract- ing one of the grinding teeth, and perforating from its socket into the antrum. After the matter is thus dis- charged, the disease of the membrane, if it be of a

161 of wliich is to render tlie or^an fit for the purposes of conception. The fluid which is discharged at the nienstiual periods is not blood, but a secretion from the blood ; it is incoagulable, therefore contains no fibrine. The period when this new ftinction of the uterus begins, is very different in different climates. In hot countries it ajjpears as early as the ninth or tenth year, but in very cold regions not until the nine- teenth or twentieth year. After once appearing, it recuis monthly, (in some constitutions oftener) to the age of 45 or 50, unless temporarily suspended by pregnancy, lactation, and disease. Of the changes which the uterus, and its a2>pen- dages, undergo from imjjregnation, we have already given a full description in the section wliich treats " On the Phenomena of Life." In the female, we find the ovum which contains the rudiments of the new animal, and the nidus for the developement of its different parts; but conception, from involving the nature of life, and the state of existence of the animal in ovo, is one of the most obscure and intricate sub- jects in Physiological science. If we trace propaga- tion from its most simple form, as in gemmiparous animals, to its most complex, as in viviparous, we meet with phenomena as replete with mystery, as they are with interest. Finally, to complete the human body, all the organs, and parts, that we have mentioned, must be X

71 ami this is reducible to matter of fact; but to render it intelligible, I must first speak of the nature and composition of atmospheric air. The air of the atmosphere which surrounds up, is composed of three gases, besides heterogeneous mutters. The gases ai-e, oxygen, nitrogen, or azote, and carbonic acid; and in one hundred parts, they are usually found in the following proportions; of oxygen, about 22 parts; of nitrogen, 77; and of carbonic acid, about one; but Mr. Dalton thinks that there is not one per cent, of carbonic acid gas. This is the air we inspire. But on analysing the air expii-ed, instead of one of car- bonic acid gas in 100 parts, we find much mOre; and the oxygen proportionally diminished. Dr. Henry observes in his " Elements of Experimental Chemistry," that when the state of the expired air is examined, a quantity of oxygen is found to have dis- appeared, equal to the carbonic acid gas which has been formed. Now, as carbonic acid has been proved to contain its own bulk of oxygen gas, it follows, that all the oxygen which disappeai's in respiration, must have been expended in forming this acid. A chemical change, therefore, has been elFected; and to that change may be attributed the alteration in the colour of the blood. It would appear, that the atmospheric air in the lungs becomes decomposed, on the principle of chemical affinity: that when the carbonised or venous blood is exposed to its action in the lungs, a portion of the oxygen is resolved into its constituent parts,

225 noui, which is a hiauch of the lingual; and on laying open the sheath, the carotid artery, and internal jngular vein, will come into view; and between them, or rather concealed by them, is the par vagum. The artery is on the inner side of the vein. The sheath in which these parts ai-e included, will be found, on examination, to have a septum, or division, between the artery and vein; so that in the operation of tying the carotid, that part only of the sheath must be opened, which lies immmediately over the artery. Let the student now observe the artery, vein, and nerve, as situated with regard to the neighbouring parts. Below the point where the sterno cleido, and omo hyoideus muscles cross each other, he will find the sheath, concealed by the sterno cleido, omo, and sterno hyoideus muscles; above the jjoint of decussation, it is covered by the skin, jjlatysma myoides, and fascia only. On the inner side, are the lai-ynx, thyroid gland, tra- chea, and oesophagus. On the outer side, in the middle of the neck, is the sterno cleido mastoideus muscle; and behind it without the sheath, are the great sympathetic nerve, the inferior th}Toideal artery, the longus colli, and rectus capitis major muscles; and these are the soft parts in the vicinity of the vessels and par vagum. For a great part of its course, the carotid artery is accompanied by small absorbent glands, which, from forming one connected chain, are called glandulae concatenatae. Should one of these glands take on a 2 F

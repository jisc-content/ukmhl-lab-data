347 expected to find the external abdominal ring a distinct opening, he will, in this stage of the dissection, per- ceive his error. It is occupied by the spermatic cord, and cellular membrane, over which is a thin, delicate fascia, which is called the fascia of the cord, and conceals the site of the ring; on raising this, and breaking down, with the handle of his scalpel, the cellular comiections of the cord, he will be able to observe the ring, which, however, is not circular, as its name would seem to imply, but rather of an elliptical form. The aponeurosis of the external oblique muscle is now to be detached fi'om the internal oblique, which is under it, and turned towards the thigh. The internal oblique is then to be detached fi-om the transversalis, which is under it, and these two muscles observed in their relation to the spermatic cord m its passage from the external ring, to its disappearance at the groin. The student is then to replace the internal oblique and transversalis, and to leave the ajjoneurosis of the external oblique reflected towards the thigh. By taking hold of the spermatic cord, and gently di-aw- ing it, he will see its course behind Poupart's liga- ment; and will observe, that it is covered with a few pale fibres, called the cremaster muscle, which are derived from the obliquus iuteruus, and trans- versalis muscles. If now the internal oblique, and transversalis

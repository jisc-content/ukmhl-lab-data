The movements of which it is susceptible in the human body, are downwards, upwaids, forwaj-ds, backwards, and laterally in^Y^rds, and outwards. When the lower jaw is closed, the glenoid cavities are observed to be accurately filled by the condyloid processes. When slightjy depressed, the latter will be seen to quit the former in a partial manner, and to be in contact with the small elevated points on the fore part of the cavities, If still more depressed, they will mount over the elevations alluded to, and slip under the zygomatic arches. This will illustrate how dislo- cation happens from yawning, or violent laughing, in which acts, the condyles are easily dislocated, when a spasmodic action seizes the muscles connected with the jaw. As organs connected with the face, we shall now describe the Practical Anatomy of the eyes, nose, and mouth. Eye.â€”In a former part of the volume, we men- tioned the structures which enter into the composition of the eye, and the changes which this organ undergoes by disease.

192 coronary artery of the lips: the trunk tlien ascends by the side of the nose, and gradually expends itself on it, and the neighboui'ing parts. The second artery of the face is the transversalis faciei, a branch of the temporal, which we have ab'eady alluded to, when speaking of the parotid duct. By the internal maxillaiy arteiy, the face is sup- plied with a few small branches; thus, the inferior dental, after supplying tlie teeth, emerges by the men- tal hole to be distributed on the chin; and the trunk ends in the infi-a-orbitary branch, which ramifies on the cheek and side of the nose. Neither of the arteries of the face, however, are of mnch consequence in a surgical point of view, and theii* vense comites are still more unimportant. The student should examine the muscles which elevate the jaw, viz.â€”the temporal, and masseters. The depressors are situated in the neck. The articu- lation of the lower jaw is such as to admit of move- ment in every du-ection. The condyloid processes occupy the glenoid cavities of the temporal bones; but, like the sterno-clavicular, and one or two other joints of the body, there is an inter-articular cartilage, wliich divides the joint into two distinct cavities, each of which is lined by a synovial membrane. It is to the presence of these cartilages, that the inferior

To detect the real cause of distortion then, is often extremely difficult; since different causes pro- duce nearly similar effects. We cannot agree with Pott that the primary and sole cause of the cui'vature outwards, is a distempered state of the parts compos- ing, or in immediate connection with the spine, tend- ing to, aud most frequently ending in, a caries of the body, or bodies, of one or more of the vertebrae; that from this proceeds all the mischief, whether general or local, apparent or concealed; and that this causes the ill health of the patient, and in time the curvature. Nor can we simpliiy the question as Mr. Wilson, the late Lecturer on Anatomy, has done, by saying, " Incur- vations of the vertebral column are of two kinds; one arising from rickets, in this, the bend is usually to the sides; the other from caries of the bodies of the ver- tebrae, the bend in which is forwards;" nor can we, with Dr. Jarrold, content ourselves by referring lateral cui'vature to a specific disease of the inter-ver- tebral substance. Mr. Shaw has recently published a Work on Distortions of the Spine, which is illustrated with a 2 E

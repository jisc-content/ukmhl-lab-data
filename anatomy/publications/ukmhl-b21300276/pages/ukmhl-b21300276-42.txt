EXPLANATION OF THE PLAN OF THE FGETAL MEMBRANES. This Plan represents a perpendicular section of the gravid uterus. The membranes are naturally in close contact; but here, they are arbitrarily separated, for the sake of distinction. A. A. A.—Are the cut edge of the uterus. B. B.—The tunica decidua uteri. C C.—The tunica decidua reflexa. D. D.—That portion of the tunica decidua uteri which passes between the uterus and placenta, and is supposed to secrete the maternal part of the placenta. E. —The placenta. F. —The funis umbilicalis. G. G.—The chorion—a. a. showing that portion of the membrane which is thought to form the foetal part of the placenta—h. b. denoting the envelope which the chorion gives to the cord. H. H.—The amnion—c. c. its envelope to the cord. I. I.—Situation of the liquor amnii. K.—Os tincae, vel os uteri. This Plan will give the student a better idea of the foetal membranes than words can possibly convey.

•257 expediency of the operation. When we have two evils to contend with, viz.—the imminent danger, in which a person labouring under hydro-thorax is placed, and the possibility of exciting inilammation in the pleura, by inflicting a womid in it; there can be no doubt of the justifiability of hazaixling an opera- tion. We have only to fear two things, viz—a wound of the intercostal arteiy, and inflammation; the first may, in a general way, be avoided, by dividing the intercostal muscles at the tipper edge of the seventh rib; for the artery, vein, and nerve, occupy the lower margin: there are, however, some exceptions. I have seen the vessels rumiing intermediately between the ribs; but certainly never near the upper edge. With regard to the inflammation which may ensue, if great, we can commonly check it by depletion; if trifling, it may have a beneficial effect in effusion from chronic inflammation, by changing the action of the vessels; for instances are not wanting to show, that an acute disease will often ciu-e a chronic one, and it is this law in Pathology, upon which, injection for the radical cure of hydrocele is founded. With regard to. the expediency of the operation, this is more difficult to determine. Could we posi- tively ascertain that the water, or pus, arose from a disease of the pleui-a only, no Surgeon would hesitate to operate,, for many instances of cuxe are recorded; but when there is organic disease in the heart, no good is likely to result from the operation, and there- 2 K

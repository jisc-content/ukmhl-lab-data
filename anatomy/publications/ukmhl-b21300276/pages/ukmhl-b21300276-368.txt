340 The benders outwards are, the pcroiiei, and ex^ tensor longus digitorum. The toes, like the fingers, can be bent, extended, abducted, and adducted. The flexors and extensors ai-e named according to the toes which the supply. The abductors are, the abductor poUicis, abductor minimi digiti, and interossei anteriores. The adductors are, the adductor pollicis, trans-, versalis pedis, and interossei posteriores. Let us now see how these muscles produce the signs of fracture, when the solution of continuity in the bones is complete. When the cervix femoris is broken through, the limb is shortened, because the muscles which take their origin fi-om the pelvis, and ai*e inserted into, or near the trochanter, pull the lower portion of the bono upwards; and the toes are turned outwards, jirincipally from the rotators outwards, being more powerful than the rotators inwards. When the fracture happens below the trochanters, there are various muscles both above and below the seat of accident. There are some attached to the femur throughout its whole length, and from being connected with both fi-agments, would not occasion much displacement; but those which arise from the

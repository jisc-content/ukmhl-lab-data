200 Anatomy of the septum between the anterior and pos- terior cavity of the mouth, as is compatible with the design of this volume, I shall next describe the pos- terior cavity, or fauces, and the ducts, or passages opening into, and proceeding from it. The parts which bound the space behind the velum pendulum palati, are the following: on the fore part, above, we find the internill openings of the nostrils, and the iire- gulaiities in them formed by the spongy bones; below, are the velum pendulum palati, the aperture of com- munication between the anterior and posterior cavities, and the base of the tongue; the view of these parts can only be obtained by separating the cervical ver- tebrae from the back part of the throat; but this the student should defer doing until he has examined the other boundaries of the fauces. The posterior part is bounded by the bodies of the cervical vertebrae. The superior part by the basilar process of the os occipitis, and a part of the sphenoid bone. On each side, imme- .diately behind the posterior openings of the nostrils, we observe the trumpet-like orifice of the Eustachian tube; below, the fauces terminate in the larynx before, and the pharj-nx behind; thus, the air, in entering the lungs, and the food, in its route to the stomach, must pass through this cavity. The space thus bounded has many muscles connected with it, and it is lined by a continuation of the common membrane of the mouth. In a former part of the volume, I alluded to the manner in which the nostrils communicate with the 2 D

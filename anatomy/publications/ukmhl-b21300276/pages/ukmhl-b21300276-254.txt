230 The new operation for aneurism was first per- formed by Mr. Hunter, in 1785, on a patient in St. George's Hospital. It consisted in tying the main trunk of the artery above the seat of disease; the points to be gained by this were, to obliterate the calibre of the vessel communicating with the aneurismal sac; to cut off the supply of blood to the tumour, and thereby to allow the diseased mass to be removed by absorp- tion. Since Hunter's time, the method of operating has been improved and simplified, and may now be said to have arrived at its ultimate perfection. After the main artery of a limb has been secured by a ligature, the blood findg its way to the parts below the obliterated point, by means of the anasto- moses, or communications which exist between the final ramifications of arteries. The passage of the blood by these collateral routes is at first difficult; but eventually becomes free, by a gradual dilatation of the anastomosing branches. Before then an operation for the cure of aneurism be decided on, it is, of course, necessary to be assured, that there is a sufficient commimication between the branches passing off above, and those passing off below, the part to which the ligature is to be applied; for the life of the limb cannot be preserved unless there is. One of the carotid arteries may be tied Avith perfect safety; but it is doubtful whether both can be. The subclavian may be secured, but the success is

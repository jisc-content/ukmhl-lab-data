98 factorily proved to exist in healthy urine, viz.—water; free phosphoric acid; phosphate of lime; phosphate of magnesia; fluoric acid; uric acid; benzoic acid; lactic acid; urea; gelatine; albumen; lactate of am- monia; sulphate of potassa; sulphate of soda; fluate of lime; muriate of soda; 2)hosphate of soda; phos- phate of ammonia; sulphur; silica; making twenty ingredients. Berzelius, in his Analysis of Urine, speaks of its containing seventeen different ingredients, viz.— water; urea; sulphate of potash; sulphate of soda; phosphate of soda; phosphate of ammonia; muriate of soda; muriate of ammonia; animal matter, soluble in alcohol, and usually accompanying the lactates; animal matter, insoluble in alcohol; urea, not sepa- rable from the preceding; earthy phosphate, with a trace of fluate of lime ; uric acid; mucus of the bladder, and silex; but the composition of the urine must vai-y, according to the age, constitution, state of health, and the nature of the ingesta. There are no diseases that have more engaged the attention than those connected with the urinary system; and, generally speaking, there are none more painful, and distressing. From inflammation, and other causes, the secre- tion may be suppressed; or the reverse of this may happen, as in diabetes.

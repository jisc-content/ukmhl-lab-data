296 reflect on tlie infiltration of urine in the cellular mem- brane of the perinaeum, as being not an unfrequent cause of death after lithotomy; he must consider the parts to be cut in the lateral operation for stone, and the stages of the process; the new proposal, by M. Sanson, of cutting from the rectum into the bladder, which operation he calls the "recto vesical"; the operation of punctui'ing the bladder, from the rectum, for the discharge of ui-ine in case of unmanageable obstruction in the natural passage; the nature of fistula, in periiiaeo; fistula in ano; diseases of the rectum; and the treatment which they respectively require. Another examination of the pelvic viscera may now be made, by seijarating the left os innominatum at the sacro iliac junction, and sawing through the pubis, at a little distance from the symphysis; by thus removing one side of the pony pelvis, we obtain a lateral view. When the l)ladder is partially inflated from the ureter, and the rectum stuffed with hair or tow, the relation of these pai'ts to others, will be more clearly seen. The ureter will be observed descending to the bladder; the vesicula seminalis lying neai' its cervix; the vas deferens passing downwards; the prostate gland surrounding the neck of the bladder; the mem- branous part of the uz'ethra beyond it; and the turn- ings of the peritoneum can now be easily traced over the bladder and rectum.

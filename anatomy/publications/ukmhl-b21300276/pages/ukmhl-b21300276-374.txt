34G ing from the lin^, and the upper part of the thi^^h, is called the fascia superlicialis. It is a structure not confined to the groin; but here, and in other portions of the body, it is thicker, more membranous, and deserving- of jjarticular notice, from its relation to hernije, and suppurating buboes. The fascia superlicialis is to be separated from the aponeurosis which it covers, and reflected in a similar way to the skin; this will expose the glisten- ing tendon, its termination in Poupart's ligament, the upper portion of the fascia lata of the thigh, and the inguinal glands; and the student will easily under- stand, after observing the situation of the superficial fascia above the inguinal glands, why it is, that abscesses in the groin are long in bursting; for the fascia thickens from pressure, and offers great resis- tance; and Avh,y, if allowed to open spontaneously, a sinuous ulcer is often left, Avbich is troublesome to heal. The common skin, and fi\scia just described, are then the superficial parts of the inguinal region. The portion of aponeurosis, which stretches from the superior spinous process of the ilium to the sym- physis pubis, is next to be examined. It is called Poupai t's ligament, and at its pubic extremity, there is an opening, formed by a separation of the tendinous fib]-es, and named the external abdominal ring, in contradistinction to another aperture, by and by to be described, which is the internal ring. If the student

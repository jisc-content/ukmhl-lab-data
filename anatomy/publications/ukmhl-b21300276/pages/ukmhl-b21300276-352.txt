324 resources of nature have been found adequate to the supply of a sufficient quantity of blood for the support of the limb. A wound of the axillai-y artery is regarded as an accident which requires a ligature on the subcla- vian ; but no security against hoemorrhage can be fully calculated upon, unless the wounded vessel is cut â€¢down upon, and two ligatures passed; one above, and the other below the bleeding point. This remark will lead me to speak of the relations of the axillary ax-tery, and the parts concerned in the operation of tying it. To gain a view of the axillary vessels, and nerves just below the clavicle, an incision is to be made in a line corresponding with the lower margin of that bone, and another to meet it along the edge of the deltoid muscle; the integument is tlien to be reflected towards the sternum, in order to bring into view, the clavicvdar portions of the deltoid and pectoralis major muscles. The origin of the latter muscle from the clavicle is next to be raised, and the cellular mem- brane undenieath to be dissected carefully away. The parts seen after a little dissection are, the cephalic vein terminating in the axillaiy vein; the humeral thoracic arteiy winding up to the deltoid muscle; the axillary vein partly covered by the pectoralis minor muscle; the axillary artery partly concealed by the vein; and behind the artery is the axillaiy plexus of nerves; but in order to expose these parts in the greatest possible degree, the pectoralis major should be relaxed.

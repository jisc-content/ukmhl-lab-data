In comjjosition, the pancreatic juice is very similar to the saliva; and its use is to assist in the formation of chyle. In the mouth, oesophagus, stomach, and whole tract of the intestines, very many mucous glands exist. D.—The fluids of the circulating and respiratory organs, are in the fourth class. The heart is contained in a bag, called the peri- cardium, which is, in fact, a reflected membrane, like the pleura, peritoneum, and tunica vaginalis testis. It gives a close, and afterwards a loose covering to the heart. The internal surface is a secreting organ; it secretes a serous fluid named, liquor pericardii, which prevents the close and loose portions of the membrane from adhering together. An accumulation of this fluid constitutes hydrops pericardii. The lining membrane of the cavities of the heart, arteries, and veins, furnishes a serous secretion, which is useful in facilitating the circulation of the blood. In the trachea, bronchise, and pulmonary cells, there is a mucus, for the lubrication of their surfaces. E.—The peculiar secretion of the kidnies is the

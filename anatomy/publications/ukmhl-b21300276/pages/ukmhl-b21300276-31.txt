9 been engaged six years at least in the acquisition of profession^ knowledge: to qualify liim for examina- tion at Apothecaries' Hall, he must testify by the prQ- duction of his indenture, his having served an appren- ticeship of five yeai-s: what ought to be done then is to apportion his time, and to show how it can most pro- fitably be spent in professional acquirement. When he is first bound an apprentice, it is not safe for the practitioner to trust him mth the dispens- ing department, from his ignorance of the chemical nature and properties of drugs. It is therefore the interest, as well as duty, of the master, to alFord his pupU an opportunity of acquiring the necessary know- ledge by attending lectures, which are so arranged as to give a condensed view of the most useful points. By this method, and by diligent reading, he will soon become deserving of confidence, an(J may be entrusted with the important duty in question.â€” The pupil then should, as early as possible, be allowed to attend lectures on pharmaceutical chemistry, and botany. Dming the second winter he should be per- mitted to enter to the lectures on natural iihilosophy: and in the remaining part of his apprenticeship, hu- man and comparative anatomy, and the application of these studies to medicine, surgery, and midwifery, should be the objects of his researches. He will thus be qualified to extend his views, and to avail himself of future opportunities of improvement, with the best possible chance of benefit. c

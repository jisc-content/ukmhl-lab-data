Haller (than whom, a better Anatomist and Physiologist never lived) expressly tells us, in his " Bibliotheca CMrurgica^'' that he was never able to perform an operation on the living subject; although he had given instructions in surgery, for seventeen years, and had frequently shown, on the dead body, the most difficult operations in surgeiy. It is said, that Cheselden, to the last, was gene- rally affected with diai'rhoea, in contemplating a serious operation. At first, all men feel more or less anxiety, however great their anatomical knowledge may be; and often, this continues throughout their professional life. I shall here give what Richerand, a distinguished operative Surgeon of the Frejich School says, on this subject, and as the j)assage comprehends what I wish to imjiress on the mind of the student, viz.â€”how confidence is most likely to be acquired, I shall, with his words, conclude these introductoi-y remarks.

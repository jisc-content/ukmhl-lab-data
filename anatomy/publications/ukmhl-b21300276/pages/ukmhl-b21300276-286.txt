260 Abscesses are seldom known to heal when situa- ated in these organs, and one of the reasons of this would seem to be, that the parts cannot be kept in a state of rest. If an abscess of the lungs were to bui'st, and the matter were to discharge itself by the trachea, the sides of the abscess would fall together, gi-anula- tions would arise, adhesions form, and in time the sac would become obliterated in the same way as ab- scesses of other parts. But the function of the lungs renders this almost impossible, because the parts cannot be kept in that quiescent state, which is neces- sary to the reparative process we have described. The deduction is, that if the lungs can be kept quiet, abscesses may heal in them as in other structures; hence it has been proposed to puncture the chest with a view to cause a collapse of the lungs, by admitting air into the cavity of the thorax. The operation has been performed, at the recommendation of Dr. Carson, on a gentleman of Liverpool; but it was unsuccessM. In the Thirty-first Number of the " Medical Intelli- gencer^^ the editors mention, that they saw it inad- vertently tried, and that the effect was remarkably satisfactory, for the patient felt comparatively weU for a short time after the operation. Dr. Carson's suggestion is plausible; but it can- not succeed where adhesions exist to a great extent, and where there ai'e toustitutioiial circumstances to contend with.

264 collection of the serum of this bag, gives rise to the disease called, hydrops pericardii: ^M. Skicldenip, of Copenhagen, proposes, in cases of this kind, to remove by a trephine, a portion of the sternum, between the fifth and sixth ribs, and to let out the fluid by puncture. The student Avill find the heart lying obliquely to the left side in this bag; the base of it is placed back- wards, the apex forwards; and if the apex be accu- rately noticed, with regard to the part of the parietes to which it corresponds, it will be found that it is a little below the nipple of the left breast. Some of the ancients supposed that the heart lay perpendicularly in the thorax; that is, in a line with the stenium; an error induced by their observations being confined to the Anatomy of brutes. The incision in the pericardium is to be continued upwards, so as to make the great vessels at the basis of the heart conspicuous, and the student must ob- serve the situation of the right and left cavities of this organ, and the veins which terminate in, and the arteries which proceed fi'om them. The left ventricle gives origin to the main tnmk of the ai'terial system, which vessel, named, the aorta, ascends, forms a curvature, and then descends in the mediastinum posterius; and in the chest, it gives off the intercostal, oesophageal, and bronchial branches.

47 The musciJar tuiiic has two sets of fibres; a lon- gitudinal, aiid a circular; by the former set, the cardiac extreiuitj' can be brought to approach the pyloric; and by the latter, the circumference of the organ can be contracted; it is by these powers, that the food is propelled from the stomach, into the first portion of the intestinal canal. The Intestinal Canal is divided into the small, and large intestines; the sniaU are subdivided into duodenum, jejunum, and ilium; the large, into ccecum, colon, and rectum. Like the stomach, the intestinal canal has three coats; but some parts of it have merely a partial investment from the peritoneum. The auxiliary organs of digestion are, the Liver, Pancreas, and Spleen. The first of these is the largest gland in the body; the peculiarities of its structure will be mentioned in another place. The pancreas very much resembles the salivary glands, and its secreted fluid is similar in composition, and properties, to the saliva. The spleen is a spongy organ, composed of cells, in which the arteries termi- nate ; it is supposed to be accessary to digestion, but nothing positive is known respecting it. When the food has been partially digested in the stomach, it is carried by the peristaltic action of that organ into the duodenum, where a further change takes place. Into the duodenum open the ducts of

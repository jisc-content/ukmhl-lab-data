135 body be opaque; reflected, if it has a polished surface; and refracted, if the body is tiansparent, and pos- sesses a different degree of density to that through which they had previously passed. In the eye, we have more especially to do with the laws of refraction, and the following most appertain to our present enquiry. When rays of light go from a rai-er to a denser medium (as from air to Avater), they are refracted to the perpendicular line, and e contrario. When they go from the perpendiculai', the rays are said to diverge; when to the perpendicular, to con- verge ; and the point, where the converging rays meet, is named, the focus. These are the principal laws connected with the ftmction of the eye, which is con- stituted of parts capable of refracting the lummous rays, and of bringing them to converge at the retina; they there impinge, and produce an impression, which is transmitted by the optic nerve to the brain. For acciu'ate vision, it is necessary that the rays do not meet before they reach the retina, and that they do not go beyond that point; thus, the eye must have a power of adapting itself to the circumstances of the nearness and distance of objects. We believe, as we . have before observed, that this power resides, in part, in the lateral pressure of muscles, either lengthening the axis of the eye, or producing a greater convexity of the comea; and, in part, to the action of the iris on the aperture of the pupil; but these powers, when conjoined, are not sufficient to overcome the conse-

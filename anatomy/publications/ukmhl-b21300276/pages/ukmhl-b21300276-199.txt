177 The symptoms of concussion, which accompany a fis- sure, or fracture of tiie head, are not caused hy that fissure, or fracture; for, as Mr. Bell observes, " they originate from the injury which the brain received at the same time that the bone was hurt;" the fi'acture and concussion are, therefore, conjoint effects. The sources of symjitoms, furnished by injiu:ies, or violence applied to the cranium, ai*e two, viz.â€” concussion, and compression. By concussion, is meant a shock given to the brain by a blow; by which the functions of that organ ai-e temporarily sus- pended, or permanently desti'oyed. The symptoms which denote a slight degree of concussion, are giddi- ness, tremor, paleness, nausea, and momentary insen- sibility. When the concussion is violent, there is a . complete loss of sensibility and voluntary power; the skin is pallid and cold, and there is sickness, and a feebleness of pulse; this state of depression neai'ly resembles a state of syncope; but if the patient sur- vives, sensibility and volition, in some measure, return, the countenance becomes natural, the skin assumes its ordinary warmth, and the pulse rises ; this is what is called a re-action; we are now to apprehend inflam- mation, and our treatment must be directed to the prevention of it by the appropriate means. Should depletory measures not succeed in preventing it, the patient dies from inflammation of the brain, or from the symptoms of concussion giving place to those of z

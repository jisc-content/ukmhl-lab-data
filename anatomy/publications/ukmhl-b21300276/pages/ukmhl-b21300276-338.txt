310 the fore part is the brachialis interims, which is attached to the coronoid process, and the body of the bone. Notwithstanding the great strength of the elbow articulation, it is occasionally dislocated. The most common dislocation is backwards. A lateral one, now and th^n occurs; but a dislocation forwards cannot happen without a fracture of the olecranon ulnae. The fore-arm is composed of two bones; the radius, and ulna, which are united together, through- out neaily the whole of their length, by the inter- osseous ligament. The radius must be considered as the only hone of the fore-arm which enters into the composition of the wrist-joint, it is applied to the lunar and scaphoid bones: the joint of the inferior extremity of the ulna is quite distinct from that of the wrist. The ligaments of the cai-pal-joint are, the two lateral, the anterior, the posterior, and the capsular. Dislocation may take place either backwards, forwai'ds, inwards, or outwards, and either one, or both bones may be displaced. The carpus has eight bones; the metacarpus, five; the fingers, three; and the thumb only two. Between the first and second row of carpal-bones, there exists a perfect joint, with a capsulai* and other ligaments. The bones of the carpus are joined to those of the metacarpus by capsular, and iiiterosseal

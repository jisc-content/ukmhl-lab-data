The crural nerve is so far removed from the artery, as not to be at all in dansrer. When the external iliac, or upper portion of the femoral artery is obstructed, the blood passes into the lower extremity, principally, by the following branches. The internal iliac artery gives off the glutasal, which communicates with branches of the femoral and pro- funda ; also, the ischiatic and obturatoi*, which anas- tomose with the circumflex branches of the profunda femoris; and there are other collateral passages : by these means, the circulation is sufficiently established for present purposes, and becomes free, in time, by the gradual enlargement of the inosculating branches. Sir Astley Cooper has published a minute account of the anastomoses of the aileries at the groin, in the Fourth Volume of the " Medico-Chirurgical Trans- actions.^'' Popliteal aneurism, or aneurism of the popliteal artery, is treated by the application of a ligature to the femoral artery, about the middle of the thigh, where the sartorius muscle crosses the vessel. The artery is enclosed in a sheath of condensed cellular membrane, accompanied by its vein. The ope- ration of tying the femoral artery, for popliteal

67 distance of the vessel from the heart; the reason of which is obvious. At the adult age, in a state of health, the pulse is equal, regular, and has a mode- rate degree of poAver; but age, temperament, stature, iuid disease, occasion varieties in it. At birth, the nimiber of pulsations in a minute, are about 140.—At the age of twelve months, 120.— At the age of two yeai's, 110.—At the age of three years, 96.—At the. age of seven years, 86.—At puberty, about 80.—At the adult period, 75.—And at sixty yeai-s of age, about 60. Persons of a sanguine temperament have gene- rally a quick jjulse. Those of a melancholic tempe- rament, a slow one. Women have usually a quicker pulse than men; and dwarfish than tall persons. In disease, the pulse is often much affected. The pulsations may be fi'equent, or slow; weak, or' strong; full, or small; regular, or irregular; or intermittent. X frequent pulse is characterised by the pulsations being more numerous than they ought to be, in a given time. A slow pulse is the reverse of this. In certain Lnflammotory diseases, and in those attended with mnch constitutional initation, the pulse is fre- quent. In nervous fevers, and diseases of debility, the pulse is generally slow.

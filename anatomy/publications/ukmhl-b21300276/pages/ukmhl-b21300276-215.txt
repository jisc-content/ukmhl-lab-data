191 losophical Transactionsr Mr. Allan Burns says, to prevent re-union, a portion of the trunk of the nerve must be cut out, and this he thinks, is the only way to insure success. The arteries of the face are not large; and there- fore not of much practical importance; but the student should know the com-se of the principal branches. The common carotid artery ascends by the side of the trachea, accompanied by important parts; at another time to be introduced to the notice of the student." A little below a line, drawn transversely fiom the comer of the os hyoides, this main trunk divides into the external and internal carotid branches. The arte- teries of the face arise from the external carotid, and are the facial, or external maxillary; a branch of the temporal, named, the transversalis faciei; and some of the branches of the internal maxillary artery. The facial is the third branch given off by the external carotid. It mounts over the submaxillary gland and jaw-bone; and just at the anterior edge of the masse- ter muscle, the pulsation of the vessel can be felt; in this situation, it could be compressed so as to com- mand hcEmorrhage from either of its branches; but in order to succeed effectually, both facial aileries must be pressed on^ as their branches freely communicate. After passing over the jaw, the vessel is found under the depressor anguli oris muscle, in its course to the angle of the mouth; and at the angle, it gives off the

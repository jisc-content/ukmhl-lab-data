124 of the conjunctiva augments the secretion of tears; but if that sensibility is too great, the secretion dimi- nishes and ceases;" we cannot receive it as evidence, for we know that all the structures of the eye sympa- thize with each other, and that this cause, or an extension of the morbid sensibility to the lachrj raal gland, will be quite sufficient to occasion an aug- mented secretion of tears. We have already stated the effects of inflammation, when it attacks a glandular structure; and in a subsequent part of the volume, shall illustrate them in a more particular manner. We conceive then, that when the tunica conjunctiva is slightly inflamed, either sympathy, or a spreading of the inflammation to the lachrymal gland, is the cause of increased secretion; and that a gi'eater degree of inflammatory action operating, mediately or imme- diately, on the same organ, is the cause of its suspen- sion. The direct, and only source of the tears, seems to be the lachrymal gland; for we cannot see the necessity of there being any other provision. The last of the appendages of the eye are the muscles. The orbicular muscle surrounds the eye- lids, and, by contracting, shuts them. They are opened by the relaxation of this muscle, and by the action of the levator palpebrae superioris. From the bottom of the orbit, there arise muscles, which are inserted in the sclerotica, and act on the ball of the eye. The adductor oculi directs the ball towards the nose; the abductor oculi carries it outwards; the

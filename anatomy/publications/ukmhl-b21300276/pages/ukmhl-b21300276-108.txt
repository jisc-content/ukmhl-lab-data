84 red, in inflammatory disorders; of a dark appearance, in adynamic affections; almost black, in scurvy; and very pale, in diseases of debility. There is a work yet left for the Chemist to accomplish ; which is, to ascertain, by analysis, the changes which different diseases effect in the properties of this fluid. We have seen that there are two orders of blood-vessels in the body, viz.â€”arteries, and veins. They differ fiom each other in the density of their structure, and in the rapidity with Avhich the blood circulates in them. The movement of the blood in the axteries, is much quicker than that in the veins; because the heart gives a much stronger impulse to it in the former vessels; and this is one of the sources of greater danger from wounds of arteries. When called to a person who is suffering from haemorrhage, we should first ascer- tain whether tlie bleeding proceeds fi'om a wounded artery, or a wounded vein; obsei*vation on the colour of the blood, and the maimer in Avliich it flows, will soon enable us to determine this point. Arterial blood is scarJet; venous blood is quite dark; blood from .an artery issues per saltuni, but that from a vein rushes in an even, unbroken stream. The im2)ortaiice of discrimination is great; for if an artery, and vein of the same size Avere Avounded, the one would require a ligature, but tlie bleed- ing in the other might be commanded by means x)f pressure.

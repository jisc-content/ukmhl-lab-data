196 inner; it is lined by a vascular and secreting iiieni- branc, and terminates under the inferior spongy bone. The introduction of a probe into it, to exaniijie the nature of obstructions, is an operation which the student should practice. There is a comjJaint, the nature of which we should be at a loss to define, if we did not know the route which the tears take in escapijig from the surface of the eye. The disease is called, Â« fistula lachry- malis," and is caused by an obstruction in the ductus ad nasum, either from viscid mucus, or a thickening of its lining membrane. The first symptom which denotes it, is a trickling of tears over the cheek. If the proper treatment be neglected in this stage, an inflammation Avill supei-vene, and the probability is, that matter will form, and a true fistula be established. There are, then, three stages; the first consists of simple obstruction; the second, of inflammation of the lining membrane of the sac, and duct; and the third, of suppuration, and ulceration: this last stage consti- tutes the time fistula lachrj'malis. The tieatment depends on the stage of the disease; but a passage for the tears into the nose must eventually be made; and if the natural one cannot be restored, in consequence of its contracted state, we must make an opening into the nose through the os unguis, which, in neglected cases, Natui-e herself will often effect, by the ulce- rativp process.

354 When the oblique species of hernia is stranf^u- lated, the seat of stiicture may be, the external ring, the interna] ring-, or the neck of the sac; but the most common seat is the external rin":. The second kind of inj^uinal hernia is the direct, or veutro-inguinal. In this case, the intestine, or epiploon, or both, do not take the course of the inguinal canal, but pass directly through the external abdominal ring-; and in this case, the cremaster mus- cle does not give a tunic to the sac. The strictiu'c in this species must be either at the external ring, or neck of the sac. The third sj^ecies of inguinal hernia is the con- genital, so called from its usually appearing soon after birth. To comprehend the manner in which it occurs, the student must be perfectly acquainted with what is named the descent of the testes. It must first be recollected, that these glands are not, from the ear- liest period of the fcotus, situated in the scrotum; originally they are lodged in the abdomen, immedi- ately below the kidnies, and, like the kidnies, they have an anterior covering from the peritoneum. This is the relative situation of parts 'ere the child attains its seventh month. At, or near that jjeriod of uterine existence, the testes begin their descent into the scrotum, to which they are said to be guided by the gubernacula, and at birth their descent is usually com- pleted, but not always.

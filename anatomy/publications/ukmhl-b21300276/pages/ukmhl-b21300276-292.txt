266 so in all cases, for Portal mentions an instance of a soldier who lived fifteen days after an accident of this kind: hut the wound in this case could not have communicated with either of tlie cavities. The heart is liahle to the same diseases as other organs, but its function peculiarly predisposes it to preternatural dilatation ; enlargement therefore is one of the most common morbid conditions of this organ. With the exception of carditis, we are not in posses- sion of any infallible means of forming a diagnosis of the diseases of the heart; that is to say, of distinguish- ing one disease from another, by the prevailing symp- toms; and it is so often sympathetically affected as to perplex the judgment of practitionei's. Palpitations, frequent faintings, and irregularity of the pulse, are characteristics of troubled circulation ; but whether they arise from a disease of the heart itself, or of the vessels, or of the pericardium, or of the lungs, or of the diaphragm, or of the stomach, or of more distant parts ; it is not always easy to determine. No diseases are more liable to be confounded with each other, than those of the heart and lungs; the functional relations which subsist between these organs are such, that one of them cannot be materially deranged in structure, without the other being more or less affected in its office. When the heart is diseased, the function of res- piration suffers; and when the limgs are disordered, circulation is embarrassed. How desirable would it be then to possess a test of the actual seat of disease.

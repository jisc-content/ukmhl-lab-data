261 Phthisis pulnionalis is a general term, and implies that condition of the lungs iii wliich matter has fonned as the sequela of inflammation. In an advanced state of the disease, there is general emaciation, and hectic fever, as the consequences of the morbid state of the lungs. Phthisis may result from common or specific causes; amongst the former, is pneumonia from cold; amongst the latter, are hereditary diathesis, and defec- tive organization. Between these causes, a distinction should be made in practice, as the chance of cure in the one case, is far greater than that in the other. If a man, having no specific tendency to the disease, should happen to be attacked with inflammation of the lungs, and in spite of depletion, and a rigid adherence to an antiphlogistic regimen, matter should form, either in the right or left lung, and be discharged per tracheam, the abscess would heal, if it were not for the unfavourable cii'cumstances, under which the disease is placed; which circumstances have akeady been alluded to. In such a case, the operation might be successftd, because the disease may be considered as local; but without an operation, the morbid action will continue; the general system viiW be brought to sympathize with the local derangement; all the symp- toms characteristic of advanced phthisis will ensue ; and the patient will sink under them; these observa- tions illustrate the origin, progi-ess, and termination of phthisis, from a common cause if there be no inter- ference from art.

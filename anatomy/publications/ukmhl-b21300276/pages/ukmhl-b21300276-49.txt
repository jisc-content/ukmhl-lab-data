25 We have marked the beautiful work of nature, in forming original bone, and therefore are prepared to understand her operations, in the reparation of the injuries to which bone is liable, for the process of re- miion, in fractures, is governed by the same laws. The Surgeon is only an instrument in the hands of nature; he assists her in her efforts, but on her we must rely, as the principal agent. All that art can do, is to reduce the bone if displaced; to retain the frag- ments in contact; and to prevent the suj^ei'vcntion of circumstances, which would frustrate the ends of natiu-e, or retard the fulfilment of them. When this is done, the restorative faculty of livhig matter com- pletes the work. If we mark the changes which occur in a bone that has been broken, we shall find them to be these:â€” The injmy inflicted, causes a greater determination of blood to the part injiu'ed, and this determination is necessary to the incipient process of repair; for a new matter is to be secreted, and the quantity of it will be in proportion to the supply of blood, the source from which all secretions are derived.

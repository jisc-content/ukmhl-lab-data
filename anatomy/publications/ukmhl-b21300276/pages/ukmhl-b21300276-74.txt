The LacTEAi;r ai-ise from the inner surface of the small intestines by orifices, not visible to the naked eye in the human subject; and from their origin they pa«s^ t» the Mesenteric Glands. The lacteal vessels which enter the glands, are named vasa lactea primi generis; those passing out of the glands are called, vasa lactea secundi generis. What change the chyle undergoes in these glands is not exactly known; but they are supposed to add a se- creted fluid, by which it is more assimilated to the blood. From the mesenteric glands, the lacteals go to the thoracic duct, iu which they terminate. This duct begins at, or near the first lumbar vertebra; then ascends on the left side of the spine ; and ends in the left subclavian vein, at the i)lace where it is joined by the internal jugulai'. Thus, the organs which consitnte the digestive system are subservient to various purposes; and on the due performance of each of them depend the nutrition, health, and energy, of the body. The chyle, or product of the aliment after it has undergone digestion, is found, on analysis, to be composed of water, albumen, filwine, and saline par- ticles ; but there are some differences in the constituent parts and properties of this fluid, as abstracted from animal, and vegetable substances. Animal chyle contains more solid materials, hence, is more nutri- tious; but vegetable chyle is less putrescent, hence,

353 compact. Below them, he says, we find a cellular tissue, so much condensed, that it represents a compact and thick membrane, formed of several layers, applied one upon another. After having raised all these layers in succession, we come to the true hernial sac. He states this tunic to be a prolongation of the cellu- lar tissue which covers all the exterior of the perito- neum ; and that when the subject is embonpoint, the tunic is charged with fat, like that which unites the peritoneum to the abdominal muscles. The fascia cellularis of Scarpa, then, is another tunic in oblique hernia, and this constitutes the fifth covering of the sac. The relative position of the spermatic cord, and epigastric artery is thus : the former is placed ordina- rily behind the hernial sac, but there are some excep- tions to this rule; and the foundation of one excep- tion, viz.â€”the division of the constituent parts of the cord, is not difficvdt to explain, when we know that they come from different dii-ections; thus the blood- vessels descend to the internal ring, and the vas defe- rens ascends from the pelvis; therefore, the compo- nent parts of the cord may be split by the force of protruding viscera, and consequently, sometimes the blood-vessels may be found on the anterior, and the vas deferens, on the posterior surface of the sac. The epigastric artery is a little on the inner side of the internal ring; thus in oblique ingumal hernia, it is on the pubic side of tlic mouth of the hernial sac. 2 X

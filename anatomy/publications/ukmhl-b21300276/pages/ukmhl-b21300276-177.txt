153 a property residing in the CuTis VERA, which is abundantly supplied with blood-vessels, absorbents, and nerves; the extaemities of the fingers and toes, however, have a more exquisite sense, than other pai'ts. The cutis vera is one of the three tunics which cover the body. On the surface, is the dense inor- ganized cuticle; and intervening, between it and the cutis, is the rete mucosum. The integuments of the body are reflected inwards, so as to line certain passages, as the nostrils, mouth, oesophagus, trachea, urethra, vagina, and a part of the rectum. The cuticle and rete mucosum, are believed to be secretions of the cutis vera. This last is an exceedingly vascular membrane; it is also plentifully supplied with absor- bents ; as shown by quicksilver injections. The cutis is a very sensible structure; and but for the cuticle and rete mucosum, the impressions of tactile bodies, could scarcely be endured; this is proved by the acute pain experienced, when these extenial coverings are removed. But the sense of touch, is not the only function of the cutis; it is also a secretive organ, and supposed by some Physiologists, to effect the same changes on the atmosphere, as the lungs; but there is a doubt about this point. The eminent Chemists, Allen and Pepys, made gome experiments, with a view to deter- V

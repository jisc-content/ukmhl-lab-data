137 eye. The cornea may be in a natural and healthy condition, and capable of transmitting the rays; but, from hypopimn, or an accumulation of coagulated lymph, in the aqueous humour, in consequence of an acute inflammation of the iris, the rays will not be able to go beyond the cornea. The cornea, and aqueous humour may be natural, but the pupil may be: obliterated; in which case, the light would not pass beyond the anterior chamber. The pupil may exist; but there may be a deposition of lymph behind the capsule of the lens, or an opacity of the lens itself, constituting cataract. The crystalline lens may pre- serve its transparency; but the retina, or optic nerve, may, from pressui-e on the nerve, or disease of the brain, lose its sensibility, and amaurosis be the event; hence, the causes of blindess are various; but, fortu- nately, from the improved state of the opthalmic art, we' can now remove many of the affections of the eye, which were formerly classed amongst incurable diseases. Opacity of the comea, fr'om exti'avasated lymph, is to be treated on the principles of promoting absorption. Opacity, from the cicatrization of an ulcer, or wound, will often continue for life. Opacity from staphyloma is incurable. An accumulation of lymph in the aqueous humour is to be removed by exciting the action of the absorbents after the inflam- mation of the iris has been subdued. An obliteration of the pupil is to be remedied by the formation of an T

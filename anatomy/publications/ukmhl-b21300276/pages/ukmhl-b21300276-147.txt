123 of the eye, and connects the appendages with the globe. The lachr}'inal apparatus consists of the gland, puncta, caruncle, sac, and ductus ad nasum. The gland, which is situated in a depression behind the external angiUai' process of the os frontis, secretes the tears, wWch are carried from it by means of several small ducts, which open on the surface of the tunica conjunctiva. The tears, after moistening the surface of the eye, are directed by the caruncle, or that small red body seen at the inner corner, into the pimcta lachrymalia, which terminate in the lachrymal sac; and from this sac they are conveyed into the nose. Although the lachrymal gland is allowed by all Physiologists, to be one source of this fluid, which lubricates the eye. Portal thinks that it is not the only one; for he believes that the arterial exti'emities of the tunica conjunctiva exhale a part of it. He says, in his Anatomy, " Nous ne nierons pas quC une partie de la liqueur lachrymale, ne provienne du corps, ou de la glande lachrymale; nous dirons cependant que c'est de la conjonctive que decoule la plus quantity de cette humeur: elle s'exhale des extremites arterielles, et est reprise en partie par les vaisseaux lymphatiques, ou absorbans: le reste coule dans les points lachrymaux, d' ou elle parvient dans le nez.''' That the tunica conjunctiva is an absorbing and secreting membrane, is very probable; but that the fluid which it secretes, is analogous to that of the lachrymal gland, we have no proof. If M. Portal means to oflFer as such, that " an increased sensibility

136 quences of certain defects in the conformation of this organ. Some people are short-sighted; this arises from the cornea, or crystalline lens being too convex which circumstance will have the effect of collecting the rays of light to a point, before they arrive at the retina. Others again, particularly aged persons, are long- sighted ; tliis results from a too great flatness of the eye, occasioned by an absorption of a part of the humours; in which case, the rays do not converge at the retina. It is easy to prescribe the means of reme- dying these defects when the causes are known ; in the former case, we wish to give a greater divergency to the rays, which is done by a concave glass; and a greater convergency, which is required in the latter case, is produced by a convex one: thus, a knowledge of the causes of short and long-sightedness, and an acquaintance with the effects of concave and convex lenses, lead us to the adaptation of remedies proper for each of these cases. It will be evident, from the sketch wliich we have given of the Physiology of the eye, that every thing which obstructs the entry of the rays of light, must interfere, more or less, with the function of this organ. The cornea transparens may become opaque from acute opthalmia, by which a dense lymph is often extravasated on its surface, or between its laminae; or from a cicatrix, left by an ulcer, or wound; or from staphyloma. By these causes, the rays of light will be partially, or wholly prevented from entering the

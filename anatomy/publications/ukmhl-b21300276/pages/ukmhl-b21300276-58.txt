34 projects forward; in its descent through the thorax, the curvature is backward; and in the loins, forward again: thus its figure has been eomjyared to tlte italic f. Between the cervical, dorsal, and lumbar vei1e- brae, and even amongst the vertebrae of each class, there are differences, or peculiarities, which must not be overlooked. The firs-t cervical is called the atlas, and is nothing more than a bony ring. The second is named the dentata, from its having a toothlike process. The third, fourth, fifth, and sixth, resemble one another. The seventh is like a dorsal vertebra. The transverse processes of the seven vertebrae of the neck are perforated with a hole; the holes of the six superior transmit the vertebral arteries to the brain; that in each transverse process of the seventh is for the transmission of a vein. The student will readily discover the peculiarities in the rest; and will find no difficulty in accounting for their effects on the degi-ees of motion in the different parts of the spine. The movements of the spinal column are freest in the neck; next, in the loins; and lastly, in the dorsal vertebra. The articulation of the vertebrae to the ribs laterally, and the locking together of their spinous processes, are the causes why they are least moveable in the back. The dorsal vertebrae form the back part of the Thorax, and passing forwards from them are the

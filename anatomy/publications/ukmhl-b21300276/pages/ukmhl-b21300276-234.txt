210 fauces, and of the practicability of passing' a propei-ry curved bougie, or hollow flexible tube, into the larynx, and pharynx, from the nose; this knowledge is of greater importance, as it respects the former, than the latter operation, because in a case of sus- pended animation it supersedes the necessity of la- ryngotomy, or tracheotomy ; as a tube cannot be made to enter the larynx from the mouth, but may, under all circumstances, be introduced with facility from the mouth into the oesophagus. But to perform these operations, the Surgeon must be well acquainted with the mechanism of the pai'ts concerned in deglutition. After a portion of food has been masticated, it is formed into a bolus, and placed on the dorsum of the tongue; in swallowing that morsel, the tongue recedes in the mouth, the effect of which is to press the epig- lottis down upon the opening of the glottis, and thus to prevent the food from entering the ti'achea. The tongue then is the preventive agent, and of this we can readily convince ourselves, by carrying it back- wards, and forwards : in the former case, the epiglottis falls flat on the rima glottidis; and if we draw the tongue from the mouth, the epiglottis is raised, and the orifice of the glottis exposed. When it is our wish to pass a tube from the right nostril into the trachea to inflate the lungs, our first aim must be to open the larynx, this is done by pulling the tongue from the mouth; but if we want to pass a tube from the nose, or mouth, into the pharynx, we should push the tongue back to prevent the possibility of its

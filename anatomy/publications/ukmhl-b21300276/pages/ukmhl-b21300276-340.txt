312 understand the actions of muscles without a previous knowledge of the mechanism of the joints ? Certainly not; he must therefore avail himself of the means which every dissecting-room affords, to gain the necessary preliminary information. Before commencing the dissection, the stu- dent should familiarize himself with the relation of the hard to the soft i)arts. He can easily trace the clavicle from its sternal to its scapular extre- mity. Behind the clavicle, is the first rib, over which the subclavian artery passes; and in a depression under the scaj^ular end of the collar-bone, the artery- may be compressed so as to command the circulation of the blood in the arm. The acromion scapulae is superficial. The head of the os humeri may be felt by the fingers, in the axilla, when the ai-m is raised. The condyles of the os humeri, and the olecranon ulna are prominent points at the elbow-joint, and the styloid processes of the radius and ulna, at the wrist. By knowing the natural situation of these hard parts, the student acquires the means of detecting injiiries of joints. I do not think it necessary to give a description of the origins, insertions, and individual uses of the muscles of the extremities, for it cannot be expected that this volume should supply the place of a Manual of Dissections, for the aim of it is different; but after the student has exposed and dissected them, the

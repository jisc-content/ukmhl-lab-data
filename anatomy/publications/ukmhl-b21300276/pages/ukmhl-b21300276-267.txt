243 roidcal aiteries arise by a common trunk from the right subclavian artery. The vessel creeps up the side of the ti-achea, lower than the gland, and when it has reached the front of the wind-pipe, it divides into two branches. It is well to bear the possibility of these maldistributions of the arteries in mind, as it enforces the necessity of care, and that in the operation of tracheotomy, it is safer to lay down the knife after the crucial incision has been made, and to expose the rings of the trachea with the fingers, than to run the risk of being annoyed by an unexpected hcemorrhage. If a vessel be wounded, of course it must be secured by ligature, before an opening be made into the wind-pipe. The presence of foreign bodies in the ti'achea, is not the only case which may require either of these ope- rations. In the Third Volume of the " Transactians of the Association of Fellows and Licentiates of the King's, and Queeti's College of Physicians in Ireland,^'' there is an account of a case of cynanche laiyngea, by R. Carmichael, Esq. in which tracheotomy was per- formed with success; and in the Seventy-seventh Number of the " Edinburgh Medical and Surgical Journal,''' there are two instances related by Mr. Lis- ton, in which the same operation was required, and fiilly "^succeeded. One was a case of oedema glottidis, a disease described by Bayle; the other, a case in which the larynx was paralized by a blow, and where

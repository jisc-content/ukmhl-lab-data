174 On obsei-vhig the manner in which the bones of the cranium are protected from external injur}', by soft parts, we find that in the frontal part of the head, above the superciliaiy ridges, there is nothing more than common integument, the tendon of the occipito frontalis muscle, and the pericranium On the sum- mit of the head, and on the upper and lateral parts of it, the protection is similar. At the lower and lateral parts we find the temporal muscles covered with a dense fascia; posteriorly, above the upper transverse ridge of the os occipitis, the soft parts are the same as on the forehead; but below the occipital ridge, are the thick muscles of the neck. Bearing in mind the relative thickness, and strength of the bones of the cranium, and the means of protection funiished by the soft parts, inferences should be drawn as to the comparative liability of the different bones to suffer fracture from extenial force. Of all the bones of the cranium, the parietal are most frequently broken, because they are larger, weaker, and less protected, the temporal excepted, which, at their squamous portion, are somewhat thinner. The os frontis is quite as much exposed to accident; but it is stronger, and thicker, than the parietal. The force to fracture either of the temporal bones, must be of a pointed or penetratijig kind; for the massy temporal muscle shields it. A very little of the occipital bone appears above the fleshy muscles attached to the upper transverse ridge; hence,

205 Tvc are not to relax our exertions; but the indication of treatment is changed. An abscess in the throat is dangerous, as it may sjiontaneously burst, the matter escape into tlie trachea, and the patient be suffocated. Many fatal cases of this accident are recorded; the progress of suppuration, therefore, must be watched, and as soon as matter forms, it must be discharged by pimcture. But here, a word of caution is necessary, from the proximity of the tonsil to the carotid artery, and I shall give it in the language of Mr. Buins. He says, " When we have resolved on opening an abscess in the tonsil, some caution is required; it is to be remembered, that this gland, naturally, is very near to the carotid arteiy, and that by enlargement, it is brought still more closely in connection with it Hence, this vessel may, by jjassing the cutting instru- ment too deep, and inclining it too much towards the angle of the jaw, be injured. In this "country, I have been informed, that a Surgeon, in opening a tonsillitic abscess, actually did plunge the knife into the cai'otid; I scai'cely need add, that he lost his patient before he could suppress the bleeding.

From the passage which Burns has quoted from Portal, and which he gives in French, but which I have taken.the liberty of translating, we should infer that the carotid

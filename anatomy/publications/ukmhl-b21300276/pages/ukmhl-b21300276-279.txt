253 the spine on the internal surface of the lung (tl), adapt- ing- itself to the irregularities of the lobes. It then passes over the pericardium (ee); afterwards on the internal siu-face of the right lung (f); and finally, on the external face of tlie same lung (g); and finally, on the right wall of the chest (h), to terminate behind the sternum where the reflection was begun. Thus the pleura is a complete bag without any aperture, and the viscera of the chest are situated exterior to it. The mediastinum anterius contains the thymus gland, and cellular membrane; the mediastinum posterius encloses the important parts, marked F. G. II. and I. It is to be remembered that the pleui-a adheres closely to the walls and organs of the chest, and that it is represented as separated from them, merely for the sake of clearness. We have said, that the pleura is a secreting membrane, and that the fluid, or halitus, which it gives out, is for the purpose of preventing adhesion between its surfaces. During life and health, the exhalation, and absoi'ption of this fluid are equal; thus the pleura is an absorbing as well as an exhaling surface; and its fluid is never in excess. But inflam- mation materially alfects the secretion; when exces- sive, the secretive function is suspended, and then the surfaces of the pleura costalis, and pleura pul- monalis adhere; but when the inflammation is mild, the secretion is increased, and this is one of the causes of hydro-thorax.

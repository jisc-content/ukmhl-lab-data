335 Now it is tp be allowed, that there is no positive mode of determining- the exact seat of the fracture, and that the different species may be confounded. Seeing- this, all fractures of the cervix should be ti-eated after the same manner. The ti-eatment should be, to bring the fragments, as much as possible, in coaptation, by extension and counter-extension, and to keep them in that state by retentive means. To fulfil this last indication, we must form an effectual opposition to the motions of the pelvis on the thigh, the thigh on the pelvis, the leg on the thigh, and the foot on the leg, by means of splints properly secured. In the French Hospitals, fractures of the cervix femoris are as attentively treated and watched, as fractures of the body of the femur, from a conviction that the one unites as readily as the other; we must atti-ibute the success of Desault's cases to this attention; and, perhaps, the frequent failures in this country, to the negligent practice which is engendered by our entertaining an opposite opinion. The thigh-bone terminates in two condyles, which contribute to form the knee-joint, which, like the elbow, is of the hinge-like description, and susceptible of flexion and extension only. The bones Avhich com- pose it are three, viz.â€”the femur, tibia, and patella. The ligaments are, the external and internal lateral; the posterior ligament, the capsular and ligamentum patellfe ; into tliis last the rectus, cruraeus, and vasti

258 fore it would not be prudent to perform it; when in tlie lungs, the propriety is rendered less questionable, by the theory of Dr. Carson, to which we shall pre- sently advert. Having inquired into the natural, and most com- mon morbid conditions of the pleura, we shall now notice the relative position of the organs of the thorax; and the effects of respiration on the walls and contents of the chest. The heart is observed not to be in the median line, but inclining to the left side. To show how the lungs lie, they should be inflated, when it will be seen how perfectly they adapt themselves to the figure of the cavities, so as to leave between their surface and the parietcs, no vacuity; this is the state in which they are during life and health. Respiration is their function; and consists of two parts, inspiiation, and expiration. In inspiration, the chest is expanded on all sides, in consequence of an elevation of the ribs, and a descent of the diaphragm, produced by the contrac- tion of the intercostales, levatores costai'um, and diaphragm; assisted occasionally by the sterno mas- toidei, subclavii, sen-ati, pectorales, and latissimi dorsi muscles; but in order that the three last sets of muscles act, the shoulders must be fixed. In expiration, the chest is contracted in all its dimensions; the contraction is caused by the depres-

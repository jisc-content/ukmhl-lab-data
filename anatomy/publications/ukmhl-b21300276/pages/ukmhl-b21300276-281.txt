255 is weakened, or destroyed, by over-distension; or tliat tlie action of the lymphatics is much under the influ- eiwe of the circuhition ; to whichever conchision we come, the practical inferences are not materially dilFe- reut, so far as dropsies ai'e concerned. Such information as this, and coming too fi-om so respectable an authority, will have the effect of altering our views with regard to etFiisions. We can no longer refer them to either increased secretion, or diminished absorption operating independently of each other. In dropsy from active causes, there is not only an increased secretion, but also diminished absorption; and to cure in this case, we must bleed. Bleeding has recently been highly extolled, as a remedy in effusions; but it is in effusions from the above causes otily, that it can do good: when they are of a passive nature, as in cases where there is a want of energy, it must do harm. In dropsies from debility, an opposite indica- tion is necessary; and if we succeed in fulfilling it, the accumulated fluid will soon become absorbed; the equilibrium of exhalation and absorption be restored; and the parts again resume their healthy fnnction; but this happy termination can only be expected, when there is no organic disease. Scrum is not the only fluid which may lodge in the chest; pus, and blood, have been discovered in many cases. The presence of pus most commonly results from the bursting of an abscess of the lungs;

176 tures should be avoided; find notwithstandiiii? that excellent Surgeon, Mr. Pott, assents to their employ- ment, for uniting certain lacerated wounds of the seal]), most surgeons of the present day object to them; on account of their being both dangerous, and unneces- sary. Tlu'ee years ago, I saw an extensive laceration of the integuments of the forehead; in w hich case, the Surgeon was induced to retain the edges of the wound in contact, by sutures. On the day after the accident, the patient complained of considerable pain in the head; the edges of the woimd were swollen, and much inflamed; an evaporative lotion, and leeches were applied to the temples; but in spite of these means, the inflammation of the scalp extended. The Smgeon prudently withdi-ew the ligatures; after Avliich, the inflammation subsided, the pain of the head left, and the patient's convalescence was progiessive. When we are called to a patient in an insensible state; and, on enquiry, find that he has received a violent blow on the head, Ave tiy to ascertain, by means of a probe (if there be an external woimd) whether the bone has suffered. We succeed, perhaps, in finding a fissure; but we are not to conclude, that the fissure has caused the symptoms, if they be those of concussion only; but if we discover that a portion of bone has been depressed, and symptoms of com- pression exist, then it is quite fair to suppose that the depressed fragment of bone is the cause of those symptoms; even if the depressed portion be small.

The reticular is found in situ- ations where a considerable degi'ee of motion is neces- sary; the adipose occupies parts where the motion is limited. The great distinction between the two is this: betwixt the cells of the former, there is a free communication, as observed in (Edematous, and em- physematous swellings; but the cells of the latter do not at all communicate; each cell is a distinct glandu- lar part, and like to other secreting organs, exceed- ingly vascular.

Man is at the head of all created beings; he is, as Bacon styles him, " the final cause of all things ; for if man were removed fiom the world, creation would appear to be without a purpose."

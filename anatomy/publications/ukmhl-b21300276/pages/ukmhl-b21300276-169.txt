The vibratory movement of the raembrana tympani is imijarted to the malleus, which is in contact with it; the malleus commmiicates it to the incus; the incus to the os orbiculare, and stapes; and the stapes to the mem- brane which covers the fenestra ovalis. It is then sent by means of the water in the labyrinth, to the expanded auditory nerve, and the impi*ession made, is, by it, transmitted to the brain. Mr. Swan, of Lincoln, has communicated to the Medico-Chirm-gical Society of London, a very inter- esting Paper, " On the Physiology of the Ear,^^ which has been published in Part II. of the Eleventh Volume of their Transactions. Mr. Swan had ad- vanced in a former Pajjer, that sounds can be conveyed to the organs of hearing, by impressions made upon the facial nerves, and that people bom deaf and dumb, from imperfect mechanism of the ear, without any defect in the auditory nerves, might be made to hear through the medium of the facial nerves.

There are few persons who attain the age of three score years and ten, because there are many causes wliich have a tendency to curtail the thread of human existence. The desire of longevity (as Willich ob- serves) seems to be inherent in all animated nature; and particularly in the human race. It is intimately cherished by us throughout the whole of our life, and is frequently supported and strengthened, not only by justifiable means, but also by various species of collusion; but, in spite of the desire, how few there are who live to be old ; partly from causes of our own creation, partly from casualities, and partly from diseases to which the diflFerent periods of life pecu- liarly predispose us. In infancy, the convulsions attendant on dentition, hydrocephalus, hooping- cough, the meaisles, scarlet-fever, and small-pox, commit great havoc; thus, it has been computed that one-half of the children bom in London, die under the age of two years and three quarters; and in Man- chester, under five: but the mortality of the infantile period of life has been greatly diminished by the dis- covery of vaccination. In the middle stages of life, inflammatory dis-

16 plied with more blood than is sufficient for their nourishment; on this account there are collateral passages, by which the blood can be transmitted from the right to the left side of the heart, Avithout circu- lating through the lungs. Opening into the left auricle from the right, is an aperture, named the foramen ovale, by which a certain quantity of blood goes from the right to the left auricle, without entering the right ventricle; and originating at tlie root of the pulmonary artery, and terminating in the aorta, is a vessel called the ductus ai'tcriosus, by which some of the blood Avhich passed from the right ventricle into the pulmonaiy artery, is diverted towards the aorta, instead of circulating throngh the lungs: thus the blood of the right auricle is divided into two streams, and that too of the right ventricle. The blood that is brought to the left auricle by the foramen ovale and pulmonary veins, is driven into the left ventricle, and from thence into the aorta, to be distiibuted to the different structures of the body. It is then retimicd by the umbilical arteries, which arise from the internal iliacs, to the placenta, in which organ the blood loses the deteriorating quality which it had acciuired in the circulation through the foetus, and is agam rendered fit for nutrient purposes. At or neai- the ninth month of pregnancy, the child attains a sufficient degree of vigour to live ex utci-o, it therefore is emancipated from that cavity, partly by its own efforts, but more paiticularly by a stimulus exerting those of the mother.

279 abdominal muscles are subservient; they all concur in cluninishing the capacity of the chest by pulling down the ribs, as in expiration, and therefore arc in respi- ration the antagonists to the diaphragm; they are the auxiliary flexors of the trunk, in which action they antagonise the vertebral muscles ; and they all contri- bute to compress the viscera of the abdomen, which compression is necessary to the due performance of their respective functions. The organs are constantly compressed, from the walls of the belly having the power of adapting them- selves to the parts which they enclose; to talk there- fore of the cavity of the belly, whilst the viscera are con- tained Avithiu it, is anatomically incorrect. A i)ointed instrument, entering the parietes of the abdomen, would be as liable to wound one or other of the vis- cera, as an instrument pushecl into the chest would be to wound the lungs. When by any cause an atrophy attacks any of the organs of the abdomen, the mus- cular parietes contract in proportion to the diminution of size, which the organ has undergone. When, on the other hand, the viscera augment in bulk by disease or other causes, the walls yield so as to accommodate the increase. The abdomen can thus become extremely capacious by collections of fluid, air, &c. Behind the abdominal muscles, is a polished serous membrane, named peritoneum, which lines the walls, and furnishes a complete or partial envelope to the abdominal organs.

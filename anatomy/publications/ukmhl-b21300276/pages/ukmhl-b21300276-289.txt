263 physema, which is a swelling produced by air diffusing itself in the cellular membrane under the skin. Some- times the diftusion is pai-tial; but it may extend over the whole surface of the body. If the fracture of the rib were compound, (an accident which seldom occurs), emphysema would not be likely to take place, because if the lung were toni by the ragged extremity of the bone pushed inwards, the air would have a free exit by the external opening. It sometimes succeeds to wounds; but it is principally in gun-shot; because, as Mr. John Bell observes, the orifice in the skin inflames and swells, while the wound is wider within. On emphysema it is not necessary that I should dwell; I have explained the cause of this affection, and for the treatment, shall refer the reader to Works on Surgery. The student will now expose the heart by making a longitudinal incision in the pericardium. The pericardium is a perfect bag, like the pleura; and after giving a close covering to the heart, it is reflected, so as to form the loose portion, which is composed of two layers, the pleuritic and pericaj'diac. Its inner surface is a secreting surface, like the pleura; the secreted fluid is called, liquor pericardii, and pre- vents the pericardium from adhering to the heart; inflammation, and other diseases affect this mem- brane in a similar way to the pleura.

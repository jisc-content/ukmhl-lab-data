Ligaments, on the contrary, are very sparingly supplied with nen^es. If the ciliarg ligament he really muscular, it may be accessary to such a function, by changing the situation of the crystalline lens. The globe of the eye is made up of coats and humours, and certain appendages to each. It is nearly spherical in form; indeed, would be exactly so, if the sphere were not interrupted by the greater convexity of the transparent cornea. The humours, and the other delicate pai-ts of the eye, are enclosed in a dense membrane, called, the tunica sclerotica; anteriorly, it receives the coraea, which is transpai-ent, and may, by maceration, be -separated fiom the sclerotic coat; posteriorly, it is pierced by the optic nerve, which enters at the inner part of the optic axis; this axis being defined by drawing a central line from the anterior to the poste- rior surface of the eye.

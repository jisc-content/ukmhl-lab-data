315 The motions of the wrist ai-e, flexion, extension, ahduction, and adduction. The flexor muscles are on the anterior part of the bones; the extensors, on the i^osterior part; the abductors, on the radial side; and the adductors, on the ulnar side of the fore-ai-m. The thumb can be moved more extensively than the fingers, but not in more directions. The motions of both are, flexion, extension, abduction, and ad- duction. The student is now to apply what he has learnt of the actions of muscles to the explanation of those signs of fiactures which are furnished by deformity of limb, or displacement. When the clavicle is broken, we discover the nature of the accident by observation on the form of the shoulder, and by passing the fingers along the body of the bone, which will present an irregularity; this is occasioned by the extremity of the internal fragment projecting above the external one; it is not, however, the inner, but the outer fragment that is dis- placed, and Anatomy tells us why it is so. Above the inner portion, is the attachment of the stemo cleido mastoideus muscle, and opposite to it, below, is the origin of a pai*t of the pectoralis major. If either the clavicular portion of the sterno cleido, or that of the

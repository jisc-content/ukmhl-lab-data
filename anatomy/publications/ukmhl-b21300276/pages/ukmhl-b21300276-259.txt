235 parts mentioned, must be observed: it will be found that the internal carotid is deeper seated than the external, and separated from it by the styloid process of the temporal bone; that the external runs close to. the tonsil gland; and that there is an intricate arrange- ment of structures about the angle of the jaw. The internal carotid artery sends off no branch until it enters the skull; but the external begins imme- diately to supply the neighbouring parts. The place of origin of its branches frequently varies; but the following are usually found to arise from it:â€”The superior thyroideal; the lingual; the facial, or exter- nal maxillary; the ascending pharyngeal; the occi- pital ; the temporal; and internal maxillary. These different branches must be followed, and their relations accurately noted. The parts about the basis, and angle of the jaw, cannot be well described; it is by dissection only, that a knowledge of them can be obtained. The student will then learn, how the struc- tures of this portion of Anatomy are intermixed; and that to remove a tumour from this part, is a serious operation, unless conducted with care, and anatomi- cal skill. The student is now to go to the central por- tion of the neck, including the trachea, oesophagus, and their connections. Above the trachea is the os hyoides, to which the muscles- of the tongue are attached; below the os hyoides is the thyroid carti-

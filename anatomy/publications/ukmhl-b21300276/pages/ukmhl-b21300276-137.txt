113 This is a too hasty opmion; and until more facts are brought forward in support of it, we are not justified in adopting it. The Spinal Marrow is said, by most Anato- mists, to be a continuation of the brain; Gall and Spvurzeim, however, think differently. They say, that they are connected; not continuous. In its course down the vertebral canal, it sends off the spinal nerves, which aie thirty-one pairs; and on reaching the first or second lumbar vertebra, it terminates in a bushy extremity, called, cauda equina, from its resemblance to the tail of a horse. Its coverings are the same, as those of the brain. The Nerves are wliitish cords, composed of fibres, which are united together by fine membrane, and enclosed in a cellular sheath. They are fuinished with blood-vessels, &c., like other organised parts. The nerves, like the arteries and veins, pass into tlie different structures of the body, and are often seen in company with them; but there are textures, in which arteries and veins can be easily demonstrated, but where no vestige of nerves can be detected; and, according to the experiments of Haller, Portal, and other Physiologists, these parts do not evince the, least degree of feeling. Are we to infer from thi s that they do not possess nei"ves ? Q

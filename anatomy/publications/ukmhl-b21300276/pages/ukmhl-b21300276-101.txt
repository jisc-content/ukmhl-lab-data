77 acid gas; it is formed of the gaseous oxyde of carbon^ and cai-bonated hydrogen; it is proved, however, that they both destroy life in the same way, viz.â€”by obstructing the chemical phenomena of respiration. There are other gases highly destructive; such as the nitrous acid gas, the sulphureous acid gas, &c.; but tlieir actit)ii on the body is different; they seem to kill by irritating the lungs; therefore, deleterious 'per se, a property not residing in the azotic, and carbonic acid gases. We might here extend our inquiry into the causes of death, in asphyxia, from drowning, and hanging; but we shall merely remark, with regard to them, that death results in these cases, from the blood ceasing to be re-supplied with oxygen from the atmosphere; it, therefore, becomes super-carbonised, and on that account is incapable of supporting the functions neces- sary to animal existence. A knowledge of the cause of death, in asphyxia from gases, submersion, and sus- pension, will be the best clue to the mode of treatment in suspended animation, proceeding from such like causes. Besides the functions mentioned, the limgs are accessary to the formation of the voice. The passage which leads from the mouth to the lunsrs, is called the trachea, or wind-pipe. In its descent in the neck, it is situated before the oesophagus, or canal leading to the stomach; and at or near the third vertebra of the back it divides into the two bronchi; one bronchus

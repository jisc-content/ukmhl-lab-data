The embryo in utero derives its nourishment from the mother; its Life is almost Vege- table, many of its organs being of no use. The eyes, the eai's, the nose, and the mouth, are useless. The lungs perform no function, nor do the digestive organs. There is a cii culation, but singularities exist in the organs which execute it. The placenta, which is the medium of communication between the parent and her offspring in utero, is composed of two distinct parts, the one named maternal, the other foetal; and between the two, there is a structure, either vascular or cellulai', but whether the one, or the other, or both, is still doubtfi.ll. The blood passes from the mother to the placenta by the uterine arteries, and from thence to the navel of the child, by the umbilical vein. Having entered the child's body at the navel, the blood is carried by the umbilical vein towards the liver, where it separates into two currents; one passes into the substance of the liver by the vena porta?, the other goes to the vena cava by the ductus venosus, and eventually botli currents arrive at the right anricle of the heart. In the adult subject, the blood is sent from the right am-icle into the right ventricle; from the right ventricle to the lungs, by the pulmonary artery; and from the lungs to the left auricle, by the four pulmonary veins ; but in the foetus, the circulation is different. As the child does not breathe, there is no reason why the organs of respiration should be sup-

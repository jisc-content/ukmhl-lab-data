29- all the vessels which injection shows in it, are not for its nourishment, as some of them go to supply the bone which it invests; and it is principally by means of vessels that the periosteum adheres to the bone. It has absorbents and nerves; but unless under the influ- ence of disease, this structure is not endowed with a great share of sensibility. The periosteum serves two important uses, viz.— to give firm attachment to the muscles; and to sustain the branches of blood-vessels going to the bone. The cavities, or cancellated sti'ucture of bones ai-e lined by a membrane called the membrana medullaris. It is exceedingly vascular, and secretes the marroAV, which is said to be of the same use to the bone, as the fat is to the soft parts. Formerly, the diseases of bone were regarded as of a peculiar kind, in very few respects resembling those of the soft parts, au error resulting fx'om the ignorance of the Ancients, with regard to the true structure of this substance. Observation and chemistry have, however, removed this obstacle to improvement in Pathology. Seeing that bone is furnished with blood-vessels, absorbents, and nerves, we cannot be surprised at its liability to inflammation, and its consequences, viz.—increased exhalation, or effusion; suppuration; ulceration; and mortification. Seeing too, that an animal and earthy material enter into its

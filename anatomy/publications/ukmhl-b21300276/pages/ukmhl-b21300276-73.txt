49 have considered, as exceeding ibe power of matter. Tlie experiments recently made by Mr. Brodie, and published in Brande's, and other Journals, are capable of settling the point of dispute, respecting the effects of the bile in the process of digestion. Mr. B. was disposed to think, that the bile is intended to convert the chyme into chyle, by a chemical change: but to ascertain whether he was right in this, he completely obsti-ucted the flow of bile into the duodenum, by a ligatm-e on the ductus choledochus. The ligature, and the consequent want of bile, completely, and invariably, prevented the changing of a single particle of chyme into chyle; a process which takes place at the entrance of the duodenum, and never higher than the pylorus. No chyle could be ti-aced in the intestines, or in the lacteals; but both of these were filled with a fluid like the chyme, which became thicker as it proceeded, and at the termination of the ilium, it was quite solid, though not like faeces. The office then of the bile is to convert chyme into chyle; and to act as the natural stimulus to the peristaltic action of the intestines. When the process of chylification is completed, two functions are set up in the intestinal canal; the one is, absorption of the nutritious part of the food; the other, dejection, or the evacuation of the residuum, or excrementitious portion per anum: the former is accomplished by the lacteals; the latter, by the vermi- cular motion of the intestines.

An ingenious instrument for the purj)Ose has been invented by Mr. Weiss, in the Strand, at the suggestion of Sir Astley Coo2)er; and in the Twelfth Volume of the " Medico-Chirurgical Transactions,'''' a Paper will be found, by Sir Astley, giving an account of operations in which the dilator was successfully employed. As the student has examined the parietes of the abdomen, and the relative position of the contents, he will be induced to consider the nature and conse- quences of wounds. On the abdomen receiving a stab with a sharp instrument, what are the circumstances Avhich should lead the Surgeon to form a judgment on the mischief which has been produced, and the probable issue of the case? The first thing to be considered, is the depth of the wound; if it be superficial, that is, if

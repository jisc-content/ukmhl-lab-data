244 siiffbcation was threatened by a collection of some fluid in the trachea, and its ramifications. The next point to which the student must attend, is the situation of the oesophagus, behind the wind- pipe, as it will lead him to select the safest place for the operation of ccsophagotomy. The pharynx, or upper part of the gullet, is of a funnel shape, and of a muscular structure; it termi- nates in the oesophagus, just opposite to the inferior edge of the larynx; thus the oesophagus and trachea may be said to commence opposite to each other. At their commencement, the one is placed immediately behind the other; but as the oesophagus descends, it inclines to the left, and in the lower part of the neck is seen projecting beyond the side of the wind-pipe, and not far distant fi-om the carotid artery. The prin- cipal i^arts connected with the side of the oesophagus are, the branches of the recurrent nerve, and the infe- rior thyroideal artery, which are situated near the projecting part of the canal. Substances may lodge in the pharynx or oeso- phagus, and suffocate by producing spasmodic con- striction, or by their pressure on the trachea. The modes of giving relief are, extraction of the substance by the finger, or a ciu'ved forceps; pushing it into the stomach by means of a probaug; of cutting down upon

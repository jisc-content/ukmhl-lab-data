262 But in phthisis from a specific cause, the case is quite different; the disease is dependant on inherent defects, and without eradicating tliese, all attempts at cure will be inefficient; in such a case, it is obvious, tlie operation can do no good. The distinctions established are, in a practical point of view, of extreme importance; and expose, I think, in a striking manner, the probable efficiency, and inefficiency, of Dr. Carson's proposal. The lungs are closely applied to the inner surface of the ribs, and this will lead the student to reflect on the dangerous effects of wounds of the chest, and the consequences of fractures of the costae. If a sharp instrument be thrust through the intervals of the ribs, it must, almost of necessity, woimd the lungs, and the probability is, that the person will die from hcemorrhage. The blood will not flow through the apei'ture which has been made in the parietes, but into the cavity of the thorax; for on aii- being admitted, the lungs will recede. If a rib be fractured in a pointed manner, and the sharp fragment be forcibly driven inwards, it may tear through the i>leura pulmonalis, and penetrate the lung; a lacerated wound of this kind is not commonly suc- ceeded by much hcemorrhage, but there will be another eff'ect, which is almost constant, viz.â€”em-

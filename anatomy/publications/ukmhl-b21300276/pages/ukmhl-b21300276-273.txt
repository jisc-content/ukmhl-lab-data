THORAX. The thorax, whether regarded anatomically, phy- siologically, or pathologically, is decidedly the most important part of the hmnau body, as it encloses organs, the most essential to our existence. A wound of the head, or abdomen, may destroy life, but a per- son seldom survives a penetrating wound of the lungs, in consequence of the hcemorrhage which follows; and a wound of the heart is almost instantly fatal. The lungs and heart (strictly speaking) are vital organs; and Nature, all wise in her plans, has taken care to place them in a situation, and to surround them with a wall, well calculated to defend them from external violence. When we look to the Anatomy of the pariefes of the chest, we observe that they are composed of mate- rials well adapted to resist iujuries. The muscles of the abdomen oppose the effects of a blow, if not exceed- ingly violent; but the means are less protective than those of the thorax, as the latter consist chiefly of bone; the necessity for which is founded on the great importance of the thoracic viscera, and the di-eadful consequences of a sudden suspension of their function. The basis of all the bony parts of the chest is the spine; or that portion of it which is included within the last cervical, and first lumbar vertebrae.

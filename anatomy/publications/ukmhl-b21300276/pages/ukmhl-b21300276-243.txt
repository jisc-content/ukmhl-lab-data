of power, as to be inefficiently antagonized by the muscles on the opposite side of the vertebral column ; iuid that the spine would thus be laterally curved, and remain so until means iu-e employed to equalize mus- cular action. By Physiology we arc taught, that the spine is kept erect by the equal and regular action of the muscles, situated on each side of the vertebree; if then the spine is bent laterally, the action of the muscles cannot be equal, and that to render them so, must be one of the indications of cui'e. Mr. Grant of Bath, communicated to the late Mr. Wilson,* that he had proposed to remove the late- ral incun^ation of the spine, by j)lacing a weight on the head of the patient, on the principle of causing a regular and equal action of the vertebral muscles. The practice struck Mr. Wilson as founded on just physiological jirinciples, and he soon made a trial of it with a success which exceeded his most sanguine expectations. Mr. Wilson tried the plan in many in- stances during the last sixteen years of his life, and in no one instance, where it was properly persevered in, did he find it to fail in preventing the further pro- gress of the disease ; and in many it effected a perfect cure, at least so perfect, that no deformity Avas per- ceived, nor inconvenience in other respects suffered. The weight to be carried, must of course, be re- gulated by the age and strength of the patient.

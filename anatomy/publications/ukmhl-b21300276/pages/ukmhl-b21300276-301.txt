275 are more contracted: the viscera therefore are more in the middle division of the abdomen. The stomach of the child is not transversely, bnt perpendicularly placed, its pyloric extremity reaching to the umbilicus. The liver is, proportionately, much larger in the child than in the grown up person: in the former it is situated in the middle division of the belly; in the lat- ter, it occupies the hypochondiiac regions. The position of the urinary bladder too is different; its elongated form causing it, when distended with urine, to rise considerably out of the pelvic cavity; but all these variations gradually disappear in the progress of age. Having premised thus much ou relative position, I shall now proceed with a description of the parietes of the abdomen ; the disposition of the fibres of the five jjairs of muscles, and the parts formed by their aponeuroses, as linese, ligaments, &c. There are five pairs of muscles on the anterior and lateral pai'ts of the abdominal cavity, which are named according to the direction of their fibres. A line, drawn from the ensiform cartilage to the sym- physis pubis, in the course of what is called the linea alba, denotes the line of demarcation between the muscles of the opposite sides. To begin the dissection, an incision should be made through the integument, from the cartilage

363 nia; the ventral; the pudendal; the vaginal; the peri- neal; the thyroideal; the ischiatic; and the mesente- ric, and meso-colic herniae of Cooper. The appella- tion given to each siiecies, is derived from the situa- tion in which the protrusion takes place. The most important relation of the Anatomy of the groin to surgery, is, perhaps to be awarded to herniae; but aneurism of the external iliac artery, or of the femoral, high up, is another subject which demands an intimate knowledge of the parts contained in this region of the body. In an aneurism of the external iliac ai-tery, it is necessary to pass a ligature about the vessel above the seat of disease. To do this, the Surgeon must know how the ai'tery runs, and how it is relatively placed with regard to other parts. The internal abdominal ring is situated at a pointy midway between the ante- rior superior spinous process of the ilium, and the spinous process of the pubis. Behind this opening, is tie external iliac ai-tery; on the inner side of the artery, is the vein; and on the outer side, is the ante- rior crural nerve. The vessels are contained in a sheath behind the periton-eum. To reach the artery then, it is clear, that an inci- sion must be made above Poupart's ligament; that the aponeurosis of the external muscle must be raised; that the spematic cord, and margin of the internal

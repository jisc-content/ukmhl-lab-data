r>42 The proxiinalc causes assijnied for tlropsies in the difFereiit parts oi" the body, are, increased secretion, and diminished absorption. When more flnid is poured out by the cxhalent vessels of the pleura than natural, although tlie absorbents may be as active as in health, it is obvious that fluid would accumulate, from the balance of exhalation and absorption being destroyed. On the other hand, should the exhalation be in its due quantity, and absorption by any cause be diminished, it is equally obvious that the result would be similar. This is the view which Patholo- gists have taken of the nature of dropsies. But some modern experiments on the mechanism of absorption, by the ingenious French Physiologist Magcndie, may tend, by their result, to overthrow this kind of reason- ing on the jii'oximate causes. From a series of well- conducted experiments, he has been led to infer, that the veins and arteries, both large and small, are en- dowed with an absorbent power; that absorption depends on the capillary attraction of the vascular walls; that the more numerous the vessels, the more rapid is the absorption; and that distension, or j^le- thora, weakens the absorbing power, and if consi- derable, entirely suspends it. The results of the experiments, which Avill be found detailed in the First Number of the '■'■Jotirnal <Je Physiologie Experiinentale,^'' are exceedingly inter- esting; and prove, either that the blood-vessels are endowed with an absorbent power, and that that power

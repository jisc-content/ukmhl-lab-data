349 internal ring, and between the fascia transversalis, and peritoueiun. Tlius we have followed the spermatic cord, and its connections in its passage fi-oin the external ring to the abdomen; and if we reverse the order of things, we shall have the course of the viscera in oblique inguinal hernia. We stated, when speaking on the parietes, and contents of the abdomen, that, in health, the abdo- minal cavit)' was accurately filled by the viscera; that the musculai* walls exerted a constant but mild compression; and that the viscera re-act upon them. It is by this comjn'ession, that the organs are supported in their resiiective situations ; but when, by any cause, the imiformity of jiressure is disturbed, certain parts of the parietes, which are less resisting than others, may yield, and the viscera be pushed without the abdomen ; this is hernia. I shall not enter into the jjarticular causes of hernia, but shall just remark, that the disease consists in the protrusion of some of the contents of the abdo- men through certain apertures, which transmit blood- vessels, or other parts; and that when the protruding viscera appear at the external abdominal ring, the disease is called, inguinal; and when under Pou- pail's ligament, femoral hernia.

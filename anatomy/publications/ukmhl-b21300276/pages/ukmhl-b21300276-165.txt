141 membrane is oval in figure, and oblique in its direc- tion, in order to prevent the reflection of sound. By some Anatomists, it is supposed to be inuscular; Sir Everard Home is of this opinion, and thinks that the fibres run from the circumference to the centi'e, where they are attached to the malleus, or first of the chain of bones, and that the use of this structm'e is to enable the membrane to vary its degree of tension, to receive quickly the vibrations conveyed to it by the sonorous rays, and thereby to give us more accurate perceptions of soimd. Sir Everard may be right, but there is another circumstance which can vary the degree of tension of the membrana tympani suflUciendy for these purposes, viz.â€”the small muscles which act on the bones in the cavity of the tympanum; and as the first of these (the malleus) is attached to the menibrane of the drum, and the last (the stapes) to the menibrane of the foramen ovale; the movement of the bones must influence the state of both these membranes. Analogy is in favoiu* of Sir Everard Home's opi- nion, as muscular fibres exist in the elephant, and some other animals; but Physiology does not seem peremptorily to require them in the human ear. The membrana tympani, we have said, separates the external from the internal parts of the ear, and naturally the separation is complete, Cheseldon says, however, that the membrane does not entii'ely close the passage; but has, on one side, a small aperture,

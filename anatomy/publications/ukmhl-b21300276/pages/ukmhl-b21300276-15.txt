Ill it must not be believed, that any one can be a good Physiologist without being- a good Anatomist, fol* the two sciences aie mutually depeudent; it is there- fore absolutely necessai'y, that they should be studied iu conjuuction. But the ultimate object of these useful pursuits is not to be attained without combining Pathology with them; for this is the grand focus, in which the enlightening rays which emanate from Anatomy and Physiology converge. Anatomy, alone, is important to the Painter and Sculptor, as it enables them, accu- rately, to delineate the varieties in the contour of the limbs and trunk, caused by the action or repose of muscles. United to Physiology, it displays the most interesting views to the mind, and tends, in a great degree, to expand the scope of the understanding: but if these were all the uses of Anatomy, the science would not have merited one half of the attention Avhich has been bestowed upon it, by those who have assi- duously cultivated it, from the earliest ages of the world. In competition with Pathology, every other application of Anatomy is, comparatively, insignificant; for what earthly possession is there, we value so much as health ? Hence, what can be equal to that science

72 which are a base and caloric, or the matter of heart; the base, or acidifying? principle of the oxygen, unites with the carbon of the blood, and forms carbonic acid gas, which passes off in expiration; thus explaining, why more carbon is present in expired, than in inspired air. From being deprived of its carbonaceous prin- ciple, the blood changes to a florid red colour, in which state we find it in the left cavities of the heart and arterial system. But another purpose is fulfilled b^ this chemical decomposition of the oxygen of the atmospheric air, viz.—the productioiv of animal heat. The natural heat of the body is about 99° of Farenheit, and this obtains equally, whether man inhabits the climate where mercury freezes, or where the sun has almost a scorching power; climate, there- fore, does not affect the internal temperature of our bodies, which arises from the lungs performing a regular and uninterrupted operation upon the oxyen inspired. We have already spoken of the way in which the base of the oxygen is disposed of, viz.— in combining with the carbon to form carbonic acid gas; the other part, or caloric goes over to the arterial blood in a latent state; but in the circulation it be- comes sensible, and maintains an equal temperature of the body. The meaning of latent, and sensible heat, requires further elucidation. There are two opinions concerning the nature of heat; according to one, it is the property of matter;

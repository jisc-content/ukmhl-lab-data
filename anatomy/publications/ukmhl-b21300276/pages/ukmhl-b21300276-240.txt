210 but a ti-iflin^ degree of motion between any two bones ; the curve is gentle, and regular, so that the medulla spinalis readily accommodates itself to every change of posture. Under the integuments of the posterior pait of the trunk, we find expanded muscles, which pass from it to the upper extremities ; these muscles, under cer- tain circumstances, must modify the motions of the trunk. When the muscles which form this superficial stratum are reflected towards their insertions, we come to those which have a dii-ect influence on the head and sj)ine. At the nucha, or nape of the neck, there are some muscles which act upon the head, in antago- uizing those on the fore part, or in turning the head backAvards, or obliquely to one side; but throughout the remaining portion of the spine, we find the mus- cles which are appropriated to retain the spine erect, to bend it backwards, and to move it directly, or ob- liquely sideways. Distortions of the vertebral column may be pro- duced by vaiious causes. The cause may be a disease of the body, of one or more of the vertebrae, as caries from local injury. It may depend on an aff'ection of the vertebral joints, or on some disease of the inter- vertebral substance, to which cause Dr. Jarrold has lately directed the attention of the Profession, in his " Enquiry into the Causes of Curvatures of the Spine:' Besides the causes above enumerated, there

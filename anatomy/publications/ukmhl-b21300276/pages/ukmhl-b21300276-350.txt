.322 their origin and course; the next points for considei a- tion are, the practicability of passing a ligature about it, and the cases requii-ing the operation. 'I'he safety of cutting down U])on the artery, in order to tie it between the heai-t and scaleni muscles, is to be ques- tioned, on account of the proximity of the vessel to many very important parts; but that it may be tied Avithout much risk, after it has passed the scaleni ipjiseles, many successful cases bear witness. The external incision is to divide the skin imme- diately above the clavicle, from the outer edge of the clavicular portion of the sterno cleido muscle, to the margin of the clavicular insertion of the trapezius. On the edges of this incision being separated, the fibres of the platysma myoides will be exposed; these are to be cut through with caution, lest the external jugular vein, which lies immediately nnder it, should be wounded; the jugular vein is, by means of a blunt liook, to be di'awu to the outer side, the celhdar mem- brane carefully sepai'ated with the handle of the scalpel, and the arterv felt for, Avhicli has the cervical nerves of the axillary plexus above, and the subclavian vein below it- The vessel lies deep, and therefore some difficulty has occasionally been experienced in passing a ligature about it; this has induced Desault, Mr. Ramsden, and other Surgeons, to contrive instru- ments, by wliich this part of the operation may be facilitated. Not very long ago, Mr. Weiss, an inge- nious surgical instrument-maker in the Strand, con-

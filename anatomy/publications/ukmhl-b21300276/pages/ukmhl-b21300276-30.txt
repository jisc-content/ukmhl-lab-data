But to mxdcrstand certain functions, the student must he acquainted with other hranches of science. Without the assistance of mechanics, he would t>e unable to determine the principles of muscular motion; —^without pneumatics, he could not comprehend the beautiful process of resphation, and the physiological results of this function;—without optics, he could not explain the operation of the humours of the eye on the rays of light in their transmission through them;— and without acoustics he would be ignorant of the manner in which sound is conveyed to the sensible expansion of the auditory nerve; thus mechanics, pneumatics, optics, acoustics, and other branches of natural philosophy are the auxiliary sciences to the study of medicine, inasmuch as they elucidate certain natural and morbid phenomena in the animal economy.

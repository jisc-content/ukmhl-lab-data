.338 The motions of the lower extremity are, those of the femur on the pelvis; of the leg upon the thigh; of the foot upon the leg; and those of the toes. The hip is a ball and socket joint, like the shoulder; but differs from it in the depth of the socket, and size of the head of the bone. The move- ments of the thigh-bone on the pelvis are extensive, and in every direction; they are, backwards, (exten- sion) ; forwards, (flexion); outwards, (abduction); inwards, (adduction) ; and it can revolve upon its axis inwards, or outwards, (rotation inwards and out- wards). The muscles of extension are, the glutaeus maximus, part of the glutaeus medius, that portion of the biceps which arises from the tuber ischii, that portion of the adductor magnus from the same point, the semi membranosus, the semi tendinosus; besides which, some of the smaller muscles near the posterior part of the hip-joint assist in this action. The muscles of flexion are, the iliacus internus, the psoas magnus, the tensor vaginae femoris, the sarto- rius, the gracilis, the adductores, the rectus, the pec- tiueus, and the obturator extenius. The muscles of abduction are, the three gluta^i, the pyriformis, the gemini, the obturator internus, and tensor vaginae femoris.

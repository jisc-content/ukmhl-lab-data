180 autl the continued line inclicates the course of the lon- gitudinal sinus of the brain. 2d.—At the anterior inferior angle of the parietal bone, situated about two inches above the zyt^omatic arch ; because the artery of the diu*a mater is here embedded in a deep sulcus in the bone, and a wound of it might occasion a serious haemorrhage. 3d.—At the posterior infei'ior angle of the parietal bone, which is situated just above the root of the mas- toid process of the temporal bone; because it is oppo- site to a paj't of the course of the lateral sinus. Tlie accompanying sketch is intended to show the manner in which the dura mater envelopes the contents of the cranium; and the relations of the sinuses of the hi'ain to the exterior of the skull. Th(t dura mater gives a complete lining to the inner surface of the crauiinn, and forms the processes represented by A, Avhich is the fiilx, or septum cerebri. B—The left side of the tentorium; or that process w hich separates the posterior lobes of the cerebrum, from the upper surface of the cerebellum, and leaves an aperture of communication, C. D represents the commencement of the superior longitudinal sinus, which, running along the summit of the brain, terminates by bifurcating into the two lateral sinuses, of which the left is marked E; the right being concealed by the falx. F represents the inferior longitudinal sinus. G—The torcular Ilero- phili. il—The petrous sinus. I—The cavernous sinus; and K—The anterior inferior angle of the parietal bone.

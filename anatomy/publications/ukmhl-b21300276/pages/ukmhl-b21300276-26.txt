4 Wc arc to presume then, that when a young gen- tleman begins his professional career, he has had the necessary classical education, and other instruc- tion; and that he is now prepared to devote his time exclusively to the subjects of the profession he has chosen. In the study of medicine, Avhere so much is to be learnt, it is highly desirable that we should faci- litate labour. In the early period of a youth's appren- ticeship, every thing is drudgery, because he cannot adapt the means to the ends; it is therefore of great importance to conduct him in the right way, and to show that his early labours Avill be crowned Avith an abundant harvest. His first studies should embrace the sciences of chemistry and botany, which are the key-stones to pharmacy and materia medica. Pharmacy without chemistry would be productive of more harm than good, as an ignorance of chemical laws would lead us to bring together incompatible substances, the connexion of which might render their operation inert, or convert them into dangerous compounds. After learning the nature and properties of dr ugs, the student must knoAv how to apply them to practical purposes, and the basis of this knowledge is the study of the structures and functions of the human body, and the systems on which medicinal substances exert their influence. The ana- tomy and physiology of parts in a state of health must, precede his attempts to investigate the phenomena of disease, and the eifects produced by morbid ca"i>cs.

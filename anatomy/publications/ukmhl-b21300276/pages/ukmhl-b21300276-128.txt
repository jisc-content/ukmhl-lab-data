104 Between the skin and curtilages of the ear, there are very many small bodies called ceruminous glands, which secrete the wax. In the internal eai-, we have the water of the labyrinth, which is supposed to be secreted by the membrane which lines the vestibule, coclilea, and semicircular canals. It serves as a medium for trans- mitting the rays of sound from the membranes of the foramen ovale, to the sensible expanded pidp of the auditory nerve. A deficiency of either of the above secretions will affect, more or less, the auditory function. There is a mucous secretion in the nostrils, formed by the mucous glands. Its use is to defend the papillje of the olfactory nerves. In catanh, the secretion is increased. All the cavities which communicate with the nosti'ils are lined by a membrane, furnished with the same secretory apparatus as the pituitary membrane of the nose. The fluids of the mouth are the saliva, and mucus; the former has been ah'eady mentioned; the latter is secreted by the tonsils, and other mucous glauds.

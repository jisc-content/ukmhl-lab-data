134 All the nci-vcs, with the exception of the optic, are nerves of motion and feeling; the optic is the nerve of sense. It arises principally from a promi- nence in the ventricle of the brain, called the thalamus nervi optici, forms a long medullary tract, and enters the orbit through the foramen opticum. There is a difference of opinion amongst Anatomists, as to whe- ther the optic nerve passes to the eye on the same side as its origin; whether the nerves decussate, or cross, and pass to the opposite sides; or whether there is an intermixture of fibres. Dr. Woolaston has recently published an interesting Paper on the Subject, in which he states that there is a semi-decus- sation of the nerves; he came to this conclusion from reasoning on certain oculai* phenomena which occurred in his own person. Before the student can understand the mecha- nism, and phenomena of vision, he must acquire a knowledge of the leading laws in optics; and above all, he must inform himself on the changes in the du-ection of the rays of light produced by their passing through different media. Evei7 one knows, that if a beam of light tra- verses a vacuum, the course of the rays which consti- tute that beam is not changed; nor is it, if they pass through a medium of uniform density; but if, in their passage, they meet a body, the rays are either absorbed, reflected, or refracted; absorbed, if the

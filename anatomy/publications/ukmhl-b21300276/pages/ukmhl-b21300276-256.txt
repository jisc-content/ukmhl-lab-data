232 completely. Mr. Bums mentions a case, m which he and others were induced to hint, that the arteria iuno- minata might be tied; but the boldness of the ope- ration, and the deficiency of data whereupon to esti- mate the probability of its issue, forbade them to urge tlie proposition. We shall now enumerate the parts which are con- cerned in tying the common carotid artery; they are, the common integument; platysma myoides; fascia; stemo cleido mastoideus; omo hyoideus; nervus de-, scendens noui; sheath of the vessels; internal jugiUar reiii; and par vagum. The nervus sympatheticus iÂ» situated without and behind the sheath, tlierefore not at ail endangered in the operation. An examination of the course and parts in con- nection with the artery, must fully convince us that the situation where it is most easily reached, is just above the decussation of the sterno cleido, and omo hyoideus muscles; but the aneurismal tumour may be so low down, as to require the ligature to be placed on the vessel below this spot; here the operation is more difficult, as the artery is deeper, and to expose it, the sternal head of the sterno cleido muscle must be raised. The right carotid artery is one of the branches into which the arteria innominata divides; the left carotid arises from the arch of the aorta, and at the

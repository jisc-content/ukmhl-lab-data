dyle, and through which, the trunks of the lymplwtic vessels pass in their route to the axilla. If there be an irritable wound in either of the fingers, a swelling is likely to take place in one, or more of these glands. A tumour below the elbow is not glandular; because absorbent glands are never found below the joint; but between the elbow, and axillar)' glands, a few are to be met with, in the course of the brachial vessels. The glands of the axilla are numerous; being sometimes as many as ten or twelve, in number. Their relative situations, with respect to surrounding parts, should be obsei-ved. Along the edge of the pectoral muscle, there is a chain of glands; in the depth of the axilla, are others; and there are others along the edge of the latissimus dorsi muscle, which . bounds the axillary space posteriorly. Either of these sets of glands may be affected by an absorption of virus, from a cancerous breast; but, from proximity, the anterior chain is more likely to be first diseased. The extirpation of glandular tumours from the axilla, is a veiy delicate operation; and when the disease is cancerous, it is seldom effectual; for if the breast, and superficial glands, be removed, it is probable, that some t)f the deeper seated, as those of the chest, are affected; and as we camiot reach them, we cannot arrest tlie progress of the disease. Cancer may, for the most part, be regarded as a fatal malady; in most cases, the operation does littl*

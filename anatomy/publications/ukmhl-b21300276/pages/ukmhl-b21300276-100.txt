76 Oxygen is called vital air; it being the only one of the three that can support animal life; but when alone, it is so stimulating in its effects, as to cause a rapid expenditure of the vital principle. Nitrogen gas is quite incapable of supporting life; and carbonic acid, the same; but for the dilution of the too active properties of the oxygen, their addition is essential in atmospheric air. Monsieur Orfila mentions, in his valuable work on Poisons, that Nysten proved, by experiments, that guinea-pigs, plunged into nitrogen, or azotic gas, are asphyxied at the end of five minutes, and in three minutes and a half, if the experiment be begun by emptying the lungs of the air that may be contained in them. At the moment of inunersion into an atmosphere of azote pure, or almost pure; the animal experiences a difficulty in respiration, which becomes great, elevated, and more rapid than ordinary; it grows gradually weak, but without any lesion of the nervous functions; after death, the arterial system is found filled with black blood. This asphyxia takes place tlu'ough a defect of oxygen, as yoimg animals can be easily restored to life by exposing them to pure air. Carbonic acid, or that gas which is disengaged from fermenting liquors and lime-kilns, more speedily kills than the preceding. It will destroy life in a few minutes. The noxious principle, which is given out during the combustion of charcoal, is not the pure carbonic

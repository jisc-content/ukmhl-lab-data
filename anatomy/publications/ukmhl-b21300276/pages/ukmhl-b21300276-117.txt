93 tubuli for conveying the secreted fluid to its main excretory duct. But in the blood-vessels of the liver, there is this peculiarity; whilst other glands are sup- plied with arterial blood only, this organ receives, in addition to it, a large quantity of venous blood, thi-ough the medium of the vena portae, a considerable vessel formed by the imion of those veins which return the blood from the other chylopoietic viscera. It is supposed by many Physiologists, that the blood carried to the liver by the hepatic artery, is intended merely for the nourishment of the gland, and that the blood of the vena portas is only for the biliary secretion; but a case related by Mr. Abemethy, in the " Philosophical Transactions," proves that the blood of the ajrtery is subservient to both functions. The subject of the case referred to, was a child, in whom the vena portae terminated at once in the vena cava inferior, without approaching the liver; yet the child was well nourished; and, on examination after death, bile was found both in the gall-bladder and intestines. The bile is carried from the liver by the hepatic duet; to the gall-bladder, by the cystic duct; and to the intestines, by the ductus communis choledochus. The uses of this fluid are to assist in the chyliferous process, and to excite the peristaltic action of the intes- tines. It is found to consist of a resinous matter, albumen, salts of soda, lime, and oxide of iron.

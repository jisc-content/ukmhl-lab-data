212 are suspended in the cases now under consideration ; v, c are therefore to imitate tlieni by artificial means. Having distended the lungs in the way described, we imitate inspiration; we imitate expiration by com- pressing the chest, and allowing the nostrils and mouth to re-open. The distension and expulsion are thus alternated, until all hope is extinct, or resuscita- tion croAvns our efFoits with success. When the patient is in the passive state attendant on susiiended animation, the above methods of inflating the lungs are adequate substitutes for laryngotomy, or trache- otomy; but when a foreign body is lodged in the larynx, or windpipe, an opening must be made for its extraction, or dischai'ge. A knowledge of the relative position of parts shows the possibility of passing a probe, with a proper curvature, through the nostril into the Eus- tachian tube to clear it fi-om obstructions; and it explains how an enlargement of the tonsil gland may so close the orifice of the tube, as to exclude air from the cavity of the tympanum, and thereby produce a partial or complete deafness.

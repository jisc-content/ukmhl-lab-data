172 DISSECTION OF THE BACK OF THE NECK. two, nerve to the subclavius, f, and the supra-scapular, 9, are seen in a front-view of this region. The vagus nerve, 10, passes through the neck and thorax to the belly. At the lower part of the neck, on the right side, it occu- pies the interval between the jugular vein and the carotid artery, and crosses over the subclavian artery but beneath the innominate vein. It furnishes a small cardiac branch near the subclavian artery ; and close below that vessel it sends backwards the recurrent or inferior laryngeal nerve. DESCKIPTION OF PLATE XIX. A view of the deep muscles, and of the vessels and nerves at the back of the neck, is here given. After the integuments and the superficial muscles have been reflected the complexus is to be divided near the head; and this last muscle being thrown down and out, the vessels and nerves are to be sought in the dense tissue and fascia in which they are imbedded. Lastly, the muscles are to be defined. DEEP MUSCLES OF THE NECK. Extensor and rotator muscles of the head and neck lie beneath the complexus, B. Between the head and the first two vertebras, and corresponding with the interspinales, are placed the recti muscles ; and laterally there are two other small muscles, the obliqui. Occupying the vertebral groove is the semispinalis colli. A. Sterno-mastoideus. B. Complexus cut through. C. Semispinalis colli. D. Obliquus inferior. F. Obliquus superior. G. Rectus posticus major. H. Rectus posticus minor. The complexus muscle, B, is attached by the outer edge to the

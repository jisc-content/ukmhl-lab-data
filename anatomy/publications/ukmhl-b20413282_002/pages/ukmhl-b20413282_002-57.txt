THE SUBCLAVIAN ARTERY AND ITS BRANCHES. 167 Omo-hyoideus, B. The posterior belly of this muscle is attached behind to the upper border of the scapula, arid ends in front in a tendon beneath the sterno-mastoideus. It receives a small vessel from the supra-scapular, and a nerve from the descendens noni; and the supra-scapular vessels, I and iv, and the supra- scapular nerve, 9, course backwards with it. See also Plate xv., and p. 133. Subclavius muscle, C. In Plate ii. this may be viewed in its natural state, surrounded by a sheath of fascia. It arises from the first rib where the bone and cartilage join ; and it is inserted into the grooved under surface of the clavicle. The inner part of the muscle shows a ragged edge, where it was detached from the bone. THE SUBCLAVIAN ARTERY AND ITS BRANCHES. The subclavian artery runs through the lower part of the neck, and gives branches to the chest, the shoulder, the neck, and the brain. a. First part of the subclavian trunk. b. Third part of the subclavian. c. Common carotid artery. cl. Inferior thyroid artery. /. Ascending cervical artery. h. Transverse cervical artery. I. Supra-scapular artery. n. Internal mammary artery. The subclavian artery of the right side begins opposite the inner end of the clavicle, where the innominate trunk bifurcates, and ends at the lower border of the first rib by becoming axillary. Between those points the artery forms an arch with the convexity upwards, which lies between the scaleni muscles. Its numerous connections will be best learnt by dividing the trunk of the artery into three parts:â€”one inside, one beneath, and one outside the anterior scalenus. The first part of the artery, a, is concealed by the muscles of the front of the neck, viz., sterno-mastoideus, J, sterno-hyoideus, G, and sterno-thyroideus, H ; also by the integuments and the platysma. It lies deeply, but not in contact with the spinal column. Lying near the chest and below the artery is the arch of the

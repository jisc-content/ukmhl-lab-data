The rectus capitis lateralis, H, resembles in position an inter- transverse muscle ; it is attached below to the lateral part of the atlas, and above to the jugular eminence of the occipital bone. The muscle will approximate the skull to the atlas, and so help in inclining the head towards the shoulder. The rectus capitis anticus major, J, is continued upwards in a line with the anterior scalenus. Arising below where the scalenus is attached, viz., from the transverse processes of the 6th, 5th, 4th, and 3rd cervical vertebrae, it ascends, becoming thicker near the skull, to be inserted into the basilar process of the occipital bone. If the muscles of opposite sides act the head will be bowed forwards ; but only one acting it will turn the face to its own side, in consequence of its oblique position. A third rectus muscle (rect. cap. anticus minor) lies between the two preceding, and passes from the atlas to the basilar pro- cess of the occipital bone ; it is concealed by the vessels and nerves near the head.

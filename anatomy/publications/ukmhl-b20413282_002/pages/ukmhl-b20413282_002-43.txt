DESCRIPTION OF PLATE XYII. The anterior triangular space of the neck, as it appears after displacement of the sterno-mastoid muscle, is shown in this Figure. Whilst the skin is being reflected forwards, the platysma muscle may be denuded; and this muscle and the deep cervical fascia should be then raised. Afterwards the parotid gland is to be picked out of the hollow between the ear and the jaw, and the areolar tissue and the fat are to be removed from the space, as is seen in the Drawing, without injury to the numerous vessels and nerves. ANTERIOR TRIANGULAR SPACE. This intermuscular space corresponds with the surface-depres- sion between the jaw and the sternum, and contains the carotid bloodvessels with their companion veins and nerves, and some salivary and lymphatic glands. Triangular in form, with the base upwards, it is bounded in the following way. Behind is the reflected sterno-mastoideus with the ear; and in front the space reaches to the middle line of the neck. At the base lies the jaw-bone; and the apex touches the top of the sternum. Stretched over the hollow are the teguments, with the platysma muscle and the deep cervical fascia; and in the floor the air and food passages are lodged, covered by the muscles of deglutition. The depth increases from below upwards; and it is greatest along the upper two thirds of the sterno-mastoideus and the front of the ear, where the great vessels and neiwes are placed, but it diminishes gradually towards the front. Along the middle of the neck lie certain well-marked promi- nences, which can be felt readily by the finger during life, and serve as guides in operations on the vessels and the windpipe. About two inches from the lower jaw, when this is raised, projects

193 UPPER MAXILLARY NERVE. and forwards over the upper maxilla to the front of the bone, and anastomoses with the infra-orbital artery. It supplies superficial and deep branches :—the former descend to the buccinator muscle, the periosteum, and the gums ; and : the latter enter foramina in the bone, and supply offsets to the ! fangs of the teeth and to the lining membrane of the antrum maxillare. The infra-orbital artery, c, arises near the preceding, and enters the infra-orbital canal with the upper maxillary nerve. Con- tinued through that canal, it issues at the infra-orbital foramen, i and ends in branches for the lower eyelid and the parts between the orbit and mouth : it communicates with the facial, transverse facial, and posterior dental arteries. Many small offsets are furnished to the orbit; and near the front of the jaw bone it sends downwards an anterior dental branch, with a nerve, 8, of the same name, to supply the incisor and canine teeth. The transverse facial artery, n, commonly a branch of the superficial temporal, crosses the side of the face, supplying the contiguous parts, and anastomoses with the facial and the infra- orbital arteries. UPPER MAXILLARY NERVE. The second trunk of the fifth cranial nerve (p. 117) is named ;? as above from passing through the upper maxilla; it supplies the 3 teeth of the upper jaw. 1. Posterior dental branch. 2. Upper maxillary nerve. 3. Optic nerve. 4. Orbital branch, cut. 5. Ophthalmic trunk. The upper maxillary nerve, 2, leaves the skull by the foramen rotundum, and courses to the face across the spheno-maxillary 8 fossa, and through the infra-orbital canal. In the face it splits l^Winto large branches which are distributed to the muscles and :-: the integuments between the eye and the mouth : a fine offset Is ° 6. Interior maxillary trunk. 7.

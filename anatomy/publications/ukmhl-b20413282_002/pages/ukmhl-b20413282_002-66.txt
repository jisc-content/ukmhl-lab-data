176 DISSECTION OF THE PTERYGOID REGION. and at the spines of the vertebrae those that lie on the semi- spinals become cutaneous. They supply the complexus and the muscles filling the vertebral groove, with the interspinals. The following are the chief differences in these nerves:â€” The branch of the second nerve, 2, the largest of all, pierces the complexus and trapezius, and becoming cutaneous is distributed to the occiput: it is named great occipital, and is joined by the small occipital nerve, 8. It supplies branches to the inferior oblique and complexus muscles; and it communicates by loops with the first and third nerves. The cutaneous part of the third nerve, larger than those below it, sends upwards a branch to the occiput, which joins the large occipital nerve. The connecting pieces between the inner branches of the first three nerves are sometimes absent. M. Cruveilhier describes this looped arrangement as the posterior cervical plexus. The small occipital nerve, 8, is an offset of the cervical plexus (Plate xv.): it ends in the integuments of the occiput, and joins the great occipital nerve. DESCRIPTION OF PLATE XX. In this dissection of the pterygoid region the muscles of masti- cation, and the internal maxillary artery with its branches can be studied. Most of the branches of the inferior maxillary nerve come also into sight. This superficial dissection will be made by detaching and throwing down the zygomatic arch with the masseter muscle; by sawing off and raising the coronoid process with the temporal muscle: and by removing the piece of the ramus of the jaw between the condyle and the dental foramen. After each sawing of the bone the fat is to be carefully removed

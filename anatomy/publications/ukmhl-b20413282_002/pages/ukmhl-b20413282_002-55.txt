NERVES OF THE FRONT OF THE NECK. 165 1! It joins freely with the sensory fifth nerve, and furnishes offsets also to the integuments; and as it supplies alone the posterior J; belly of the digastricus and the stylo-hyoideus, it must confer on of} them sensibility as well as motion. lit The hypoglossal nerve, 14, is a motor nerve of the tongue. Descending through the neck with the great bloodvessels till it w comes below the digastric muscle, it is then directed forwards % \over the carotids to the submaxillary region: it will be continued an in Plate xxii. lis As it crosses the vessels it supplies two offsets :â€”one, descendens noni, 3, enters the depressor muscles of the hyoid bone, after joining with the spinal nerves (Plate xxiv.) ; the other, much smaller, ends in the thyro-hyoideus, F. Branches of the vagus. Two branches of this nerve, viz., the aii' upper laryngeal, 1. and the external laryngeal, 2, (an offset of aii! the first) are furnished to the larynx ; their distribution will be (referred to more fully in the description of the Plate of the larynx. . | Branches of the fifth nerve. The auriculotemporal, 11, is a 'sensory nerve, and ascends with the temporal artery to the side and top of the head : it supplies the ear with the attrahent muscle, and the parotid gland. The mylo-hyoid branch, 12, lies fi[, below the jaw, and ends in the anterior belly of the digastricus, and the mylo-hyoideus : contractility and sensibility are given to those muscles by the nerve. I The great auricular nerve, 10, of the cervical plexus is dis- played in Plate xvi. In this Figure the communicating branches, 11 '9, through the parotid to the facial nerve are brought into 1 view. ;lai ! ft! itn lit

They are four in number on each side; and along the centre lies a thin fleshy slip, which is connected with the uvula. The elevator muscles, two in number on each side, G- and H, descend from the base of the skull, and enter the soft palate at their lower ends. The levatorpalati, G, arises from the under surface of the apex of the temporal bone, and from the hinder part of the cartilage of the Eustachian tube ; entering the pharynx above the upper constrictor (Plate xxiv.) it spreads out in the soft palate, forming a fleshy layer from the attached to the free edge, and unites with its fellow along the middle line. The muscle contracting carries backwards and upwards the soft palate, placing this in a more horizontal position, and ap- proaching the free edge and the uvula to the back of the pharynx. By that movement the part of the pharynx leading to the nose is much diminished ; and if the upper constrictor muscle contracts at the same time the passage may be closed. The tensor vel circumflexus palati, H, has a thin but wide origin from the skull, and from the fore part of the cartilage of the Eustachian tube â€” the cranial attachment reaching from the navicular fossa at the root of the internal pterygoid plate to the styloid process. Descending along the inner pterygoid plate, the muscle enters the pharynx between two points of attachment of the buccinator muscle (Plate xxiv.) and becoming tendinous, turns round the hamular process to be inserted partly into the os palati, and partly into the aponeurosis of the palate beneath MUSCLES OF THE SOFT PALATE.

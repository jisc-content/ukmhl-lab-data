ILLUSTEATI0NS OF THE HEAD AND NECK. DESCRIPTION OF PLATE XIII. The base of the skull, with the cranial nerves, and the first and second stages of the dissection of the orbit, may be studied with the aid of this Figure. <â€¢ After the removal of the brain," the fossse and the dura mater in the base of the skull are visible without further preparation ; but the dissection required for the' display of the cranial nerves and the contents1 of the orbit will be subsequently described. BASE OF THE SKULL AND THE DURA MATER. The region called base of the skull is situate inside the cranium, and lies below the level of a line carried circularly round the head from the superciliary eminences in front "to the occipital protuberance behind. It is divided into three fossse on each side of the middle line ; and a strong fibrous membrane, the dura mater, lines the whole. A. Middle fossa of the base. B. Posterior fossa. C. Superior occipital fossa. D. Part of the tentorium, cut through. E. Part of the falx cerebri, also cut. F. Falx cerebelli. G. Straight sinus. H. Cribriform plate of the ethmoid bone. I. Crista galli of the ethmoid bone. K. Roof of the orbit raised. The anterior fossa of the base lies over the orbit, and must be destroyed nearly altogether by the dissection of that space. For

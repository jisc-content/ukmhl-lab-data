LATERAL MUSCLES OF THE NECK. 131 and above the ophthalmic vein: it is distributed to the external rectus muscle. In paralysis of the external rectus from disease of this nerve the eyeball cannot be directed outwards; and squinting inwards may ensue from the absence of a contracting muscle to balance the internal rectus. Orbital branch of the upper maxillary nerve. After the contents of the orbit have been removed, this small nerve may be found in the lower and outer angle, passing through the orbit on its way to the face and the temple. DESCRIPTION OF PLATE XV. —♦— This Figure illustrates the anatomy of the side of the neck behind the sterno-mastoid muscle. The position of the body indicated in the Drawing will be required also during the dissection, viz. the arm having been drawn down to depress the shoulder, and to make tense the neck muscles. The more prominent lateral muscles will appear readily on reflecting the skin by the incisions marked in the Plate, and on removing the thin platysma muscle, and the deep cervical fascia ; but much time and care will be needed to make clean, and to leave uninjured the deeper nerves and vessels. MUSCLES OF THE SIDE OF THE NECK. All the muscles here exhibited in part, are attached below either to the arch formed by the clavicle and the scapula, or to the first rib ; and above they are fixed to the head and the spinal column, with the exception of the omo-hyoid which is attached to the hyoid bone. A hollow, the posterior triangular space, intervenes between the two largest superficial muscles. K 2

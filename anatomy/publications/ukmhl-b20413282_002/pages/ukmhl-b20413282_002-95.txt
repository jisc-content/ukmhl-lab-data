SPINAL NERVES OF THE NECK. 205 Communicating 'branches.—Offsets unite the loop of the atlas with the vagus and hypoglossal nerves, 2 and 7, and with the upper ganglion of the sympathetic, 12. And two small branches from the second and third nerves, 17 and 18 (in this case one comes also from the fourth nerve, 19) join in one, 9, which unites with the descendens noni, and assists to supply the depressor muscles of the hyoid bone. The diaphragmatic or phrenic nerve, 20, begins in the fourth cervical nerve, but it often joins the trunk of the fifth nerve, 21, as it passes by. It descends to the thorax over the scalenus anticus A, and inside the internal mammary artery, c, as in the Drawing. Brachial plexus.—The lower four nerves are much larger than the upper, and are prolonged to the upper limb. The trunks, marked from 21 to 24 inclusive, issue between the anterior and the middle scalanus,* and join with part of the first dorsal in the large cords seen in the Figure. Only two of the branches arising from the plexus above the clavicle are now visible, viz., the supra-scapular 25, and the small nerve to the subclavius; the rest of this set of branches are shown in Plate xv. (p. 145). DESCRIPTION OF PLATE XXV. A side view of the pharynx with its muscles is depicted in this Figure. For this dissection the base of the skull is to be cut through behind the attachment of the pharynx ; and the fore part of the head being fixed on a block, and the pharynx distended with tow, the muscles will be easily prepared. * In this body the fifth and the fourth cervical came in front of the anterior scalenus.

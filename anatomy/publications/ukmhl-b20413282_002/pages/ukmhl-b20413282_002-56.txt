DESCRIPTION OF PLATE XYIII. The dissection of the subclavian bloodvessels with the tiguous nerves and muscles is pourtrayed in this Plate. This view has been obtained by cutting through the sterno- mastoid muscle, after the dissection of the posterior triangular space; and by sawing through the clavicle and removing the inner end. On the section of the clavicle the shoulder falls back, and the subclavius and omo-hyoideus muscles are stretched. MUSCLES OF THE SUBCLAVIAN REGION. Only the subclavius, the posterior belly of the omo-hyoideus, and the anterior scalenus will be now referred to, the other muscles having been described in other dissections. A. Pectoralis major, cut. B. Intercostal muscles of the first space. C. Subclavius muscle. D. Omo-hyoideus-posterior belly. E. Omo-hyoideus-anterior belly. G. Sterno-hyoideus. H. Sterno-thyroideus. J. Sternal part of the sterno-mas- toideus. K. Clavicular part of sterno-mas- toideus, cut. L. Anterior scalenus. N. Middle scalenus. Anterior scalenus, L. The connections of the muscle may be here studied : the attachments are given at p. 134. It lies beneath the sterno-mastoid and omo-hyoid muscles; and it is connected with the following vessels and nerves. In front of it lies the subclavian vein, p, with the external jugular, s, and anterior jugular, v; and along the inner edge descends the large internal jugular vein, r. Beneath it is the subclavian artery, b ; and on it are three small arteries, supra-scapular, I, transverse cervical, h, and ascending cervical, /. Issuing from beneath the muscle are the large cervical nerves; and running down in front of it is the phrenic nerve, 3.

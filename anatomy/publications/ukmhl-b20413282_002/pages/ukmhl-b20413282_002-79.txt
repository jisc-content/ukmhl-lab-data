NERVES OF THE TONGUE. 189 a. , Common carotid trunk. b. External carotid artery. c. Upper thyroid branch. d. Lingual artery. /. Sublingual branch. g. Facial artery, cut. h. Occipital artery. i. Branch of the sublingual artery. I. Internal jugular vein. e. Ranine branch. The Ungual artery, d, springing from the external carotid, runs obliquely upwards beneath the hyo-glossus to the under surface of the tongue, where it takes the name ranine, and continues along the middle line to the tip—distributing offsets. Near the I front of the tongue the arteries of opposite sides correspond with ; the tanum linguae in position, and may be cut when that fold of the mucous membrane is snipped with a scissors in tongue-tied infants. A few named branches come from the artery: the most un- important is the hyoid branch, which supplies one or more of the muscles attached to the os hyoides. Beneath the hyo-glossus a dorsal Ungual branch takes its origin. And at the fore part of that muscle arises the sublingual branch, /, which supplies the gland of the same name and the contiguous muscles, and joins the artery of the opposite side by means of the twig, i. Lingual vein:—Its anatomy is similar to that of the artery, and it ends in the internal jugular vein. Six large nerves end in the tongue, three in each half; and the three of the right side are delineated as they course through the submaxillary region. The hypoglossal nerve, 2 (twelfth cranial, Plate xxiv.), is the motor nerve of the tongue. Coursing with the lingual artery as far as the hyo-glossus it passes over this muscle, and enters the fibres of the genio-hyo-glossus, in which it is continued to the NERVES OF THE TONGUE. 1.

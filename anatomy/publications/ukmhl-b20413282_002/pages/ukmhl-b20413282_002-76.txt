DESCRIPTION OF PLATE XXII. The dissection of the submaxillary region is indicated in this Figure. The steps of the dissection are the following :â€”The soft parts over the jaw are to be divided, and the bone is to be sawn through rather on the right of the symphysis ; then, the tongue having been drawn out of the mouth, the mucous membrane is to be cut along it below, to trace forwards the vessels and nerves. To make tense the muscles, fasten down the os hyoides with a stitch to one of the firm surrounding parts. MUSCLES OF THE TONGUE AND THE HYOID BONE. Extrinsic muscles of the tongue and elevators of the os hyoides occupy the interval between the tongue and that bone. A. Mylo-hyoideus, reflected. B. Genio-hyoideus. C. Genio-glossus. D. Hyo-glossus. E. Stylo-glossus. F. Stylo-hyoideus. G. Middle constrictor. H. Digastricus. J. Inferior constrictor. K. Thyro-hyoideus. L. Omo-hyoideus. N. Sterno-hyoideus. 0. Stylo-hyoid ligament. P. Great cornii of the hyoid bone. Q. Thyroid cartilage. Elevators of the os hyoides. Some of the muscles of this group, viz., the mylo-hyoideus, A, the stylo-hyoideus, F, and the digas- tricus, H, have been described (p. 157): the remaining elevator is given below. ^ /^^^ Genio-hyoideus, B. It arises from an cminesee inside the symphysis of the jaw, and is inserted below into the centre of the body of the hyoid bone. The muscle touches its fellow along the middle line, and lies between the genio-glossus, C, and the mylo-hyoideus, A. When the mouth is shut the muscle will raise the hyoid bone ;

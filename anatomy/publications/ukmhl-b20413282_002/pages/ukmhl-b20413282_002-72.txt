DESCRIPTION OF PLATE XXI. This Illustration of the deep dissection of the pterygoid region exhibits the third trunk of the fifth cranial nerve, and the deep branches of the internal maxillary artery. In preparing the dissection the internal maxillary artery should be cut through, and the condjde of the jaw having been disarti- culated should be drawn forwards with the external pterygoid muscle. After the removal of the fat the nerves and vessels will be ready for learning. The muscles described with Plate xx. are met with again in this view, and they are marked with the same letters of reference. A better idea of the wide origin of the external pterygoid is obtained in this Plate. The meningeal and the muscular branches of the internal maxillary artery, which were hidden in Plate xx., are now brought under notice ; and the other arteries, which are the same as in the preceding Figure, are marked by the same letters.

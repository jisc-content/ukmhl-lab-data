155 MUSCLES OF THE FRONT OF THE NECK. Superficial to the sheath of the vessels where the common carotid may be tied, is the descendens noni nerve, 3. A little above the hyoid bone the hypoglossal nerve, 14, is directed for- wards over both carotid arteries; and in front of the ear the branches of the facial nerve, 4, cross over the external carotid. On a ljne with the base of the jaw-bone the glosso-pharyngeal nfiryft is inp.h'nerl inwards between both arteries. In the sheath, between and parallel with the vein and artery, the vagus nerve extends through the neck (Plate xxiv.); two of its branches, the superior laryngeal, 1, and the external laryngeal, 2, being directed inwards to the larynx. Beneath the sheath the cord of the sympathetic nerve (Plate xxiv.) rests on the spinal column. External or posterior to the sheath for a short distance is the spinal accessory nerve, 13, as this issues from beneath the digas- tric muscle, E. One small nerve is altogether removed from the sheath: it is the mylo-hyoid branch, 12, of the inferior maxillary nerve (Plate xxi.), and escapes from under the jaw-bone. Glands of the space. Two large salivary glands, the parotid and submaxillary, which are seen in Plate xvi., where they are marked L and R, occupy the base of the triangular space. The lymphatic glands have been cleared away in the dissection: one set lies along the jaw-bone (Plate xvi.); and the other (deep cervical) is placed along the side of the jugular vein, under the sterno-mastoideus. MUSCLES OF THE FRONT OF THE NECK. The muscles occupying the upper and fore parts of the trian- gular space converge to the os hyoides—the upper set elevating, and the lower set depressing that bone.

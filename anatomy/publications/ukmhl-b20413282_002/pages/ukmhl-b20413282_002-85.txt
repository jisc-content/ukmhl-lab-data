195 DEEP MUSCLES OF THE NECK. marked with 9, is called infra-orbital: it lies below the orbit, and supplies the muscles between the eye and mouth, and on the nose. In its course inwards its offsets cross, and join the branches of the upper maxillary nerve, forming the infra-orbital plexus by this arrangement. The facial is the motor nerve chiefly of the muscles of the face and head; and it is distributed for the most part to muscles receiving sensibility from the three trunks of the fifth | cranial nerve. To the buccinator, which acts as a muscle of mas- tication as well as a dilator of the aperture of the mouth, it gives the ability to contract; and consequently this muscle is paralysed when the other muscles which are supplied by the facial nerve : lose their contractile power. DESCRIPTION OF PLATE XXIV. This Illustration will serve as a guide to the dissection of the internal carotid and ascending pharyngeal arteries, and of the ; cranial nerves distributed in the neck. Leatl ; After the examination of the pterygoid region and the upper t, ] maxillary nerve, the dissection delineated will be prepared by ti I detaching the styloid process with its muscles, and the external dil carotid artery and its branches; and by sawing off the large piece ]T of the side of the skull outside the jugular foramen and the â–  carotid canal. Finally a dense fibrous tissue surrounding the m nerves and vessels near the base of the skull should be taken away t,;Icarefully; and as the internal jugular vein renders obscure the view of many objects it may be removed. DEEP MUSCLES OF THE NECK. Lying on the front of the spinal column are the deep muscles for the flexion and rotation of this part of the spine, and of the

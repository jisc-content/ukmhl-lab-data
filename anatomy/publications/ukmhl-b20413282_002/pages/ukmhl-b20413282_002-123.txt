THE TRACHEA. 233 lobe, and crossing the common carotid artery joins the internal jugular trunk. The trachea or windpipe, D, reaches from the larynx to the thorax, and divides in that cavity into two pieces or bronchi—one for each lung. Placed in front of the oesophagus, Z, along the middle line of the body, it is round and firm in front, but flat and soft behind, and is always pervious to the air. Its trans- verse width is about an inch in the male, but less in the female. Its fore and hinder parts differ much in their composition. The firm fore part of the tube consists of dense fibrous membrane, which incases separate pieces of cartilage about one sixth of an inch wide, and forming three fourths of a circle. Each piece has its convexity directed forwards; and the whole keep apart the walls of the tube. Behind, where the trachea is flattened, it is constructed by fibrous membrane (X, Fig. iii.) continuous with that containing the pieces of cartilage ; and beneath it is a layer of transverse muscular fibres, together with some superficial bundles of short longitudinal fibres. Lining the trachea is a mucous membrane covered with a columnar and ciliated epithelium ; and beneath the same is a layer of elastic tissue which is collected into bundles in the flat part of the tube. Many glands are placed beneath the mucous membrane; and the largest occupy the back of the windpipe, where some are external to the fibrous and the muscular layer. DESCRIPTION OF PLATE XXVIII. These three Figures of vertical sections of the nose will indicate the boundaries of that cavity, and the openings into it. For Figure i., the right half of the nasal cavity was cut through vertically, and the septum nasi was removed,—the fore part of

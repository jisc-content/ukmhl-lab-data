INTERIOR OF THE PHARYNX. 209 1. Glosso pharyngeal nerve. 2. Gustatory nerve. 3. Hypoglossal nerve. 4. Upper laryngeal nerve. 6. External laryngeal nerve. 7. Recurrent laryngeal nerve. The upper laryngeal nerve, 4, enters the larynx through the thyro-hyoid membrane with its artery, and ends in the mucous membrane. ^^^S^I-^-^' The external laryngeal branch, 6, arises from the preceding high in the neck, and is distributed outside the larynx to the crico- thyroid muscle, Q, and to the inferior constrictor A ; and as it is the only nerve reaching that laryngeal muscle, it must give to the fibres sensibility and contractility. The inferior laryngeal or recurrent nerve, 7, a branch of the vagus, ascends between the gullet and the windpipe, and passes under the inferior constrictor to supply the muscles of the larynx (Plate xxvii.). Muscular offsets are furnished by it to the two tubes between which it lies. DESCRIPTION OF PLATE XXVI, The interior of the pharynx, and the dissection of the muscles of the soft palate, are comprised in this Illustration. The objects inside the pharynx will appear on slitting down the tube behind, and everting the edges: and the muscles of the soft palate will be laid bare by removing the mucous membrane on the left side, and that layer with some muscular fibres under it on the right, in the manner indicated. INTERIOR OF THE PHARYNX. The pharyngeal cavity reaches from the base of the skull to the lower edge of the cricoid cartilage of the larynx, and tapers from above down. At its middle it serves as a common passage

THE AUDITORY ORGAN. 150 1060. The petrous portion of a Temporal Bone, cut so as to sliow the spiral turns of the cochlea. 1061. A Temporal Bone, with the petrous portions cut away to show the cochlea and semicircular canals. A bristle is placed in the Aqueductus Fallopii. 1062. Section of a Cochlea, showing the spiral curves. 1063. A Preparation of the Cochlea and Semicircular Canals. 1063a. Four Sections of Temporal Bones, displaying parts connected with the internal ear. 26. 18, 1064. Part of the Internal Ear of a Skate (Raia Batis), with the trunk of the auditory nerve, and the semicircular canals, the membranous tubes and ampullae within which are filled with mercury. 26. 24 1065. Section of the Head of a Turtle (Chelone Midas), showing tbe membrana tympani; the long, slender, and curved columella, expanded at its ends; the cartilaginous semicircular canals, and their ampullge; the vestibule ; and the trunk and principal branches of the auditory nerve. 26. 23 1066. The Membrana Tympani, with the Ossicula of an Ostrich (Struthio Camelas). The membrane is convex externally, that is, towards the meatus. The parts representing the malleus and incus are rudimental and cartilaginous: a long and slender bone, expanded at its distal extremity, and named " columella," or " bacillus," occupies the place of the stapes. 26. 21 1067. The Ossicula of the Ear of an Ostrich. 26. 22 1068. Part of the Temporal Bone of the Seal (Phoca vitulina), in which the membrana tympani, ossicula auditus, cochlea, and vestibule, are displayed. Its chief peculiarities are that the cochlea has only two spiral turns; the semicir- cular canals are very large ; the foramen rotundum is thi'ee times larger than the foramen ovale ; and the branches of the stapes are very thick. 26. 19 1069. Sections, showing the corresponding structures in the Walrus (Trichecus Rosmarus). They are generally similar to the foregoing ; but the cochlea has three turns, and the stapes has no opening between its crura, but is like a solid pyramid of bone. 26. 20 1070. The Tympanic Bones of a Whale (Balfena Mysticetus). 28. 187 1071. Tympanic Bone of a Whale (Balaenoptera Boops). 28. 186 1072. Tympanic Bone of a Greenland Whale. Presented by the Rev. J. Henslow. 1073. Fossil Tympanic Bones of several species of Extinct Whales from " Red Crag Pliocene Deposit" (Balsena Gibbosa, Balsena Affinis, Baljena Definita). Presented bj- the Ecv. Gr. Ilcnslow. Tlie preparations of the tongue, and otlicr oi'gans for the sense of taste, are in Series VllI and X.

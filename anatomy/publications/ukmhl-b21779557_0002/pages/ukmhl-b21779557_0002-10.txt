VI PREFACE. The following is a brief explanation of the classification. These preparations are placed in eight series, comprising the various con- stituent parts of the body. In each series the specimens therein contained are further sub-divided into the following six classes :â€” Class I. Variation. II. Duplicity. III. Excess of Growth. IV. Arrest of Growth. V. Arrest of Development. VI. Disease. The Catalogue has been prepared under the direction of the Museum Committee. I have received valuable aid in the revision of many of the series from members of the Hospital Staff, especially from Dr. Matthews Duncan and Dr. Norman Moore; to the latter belongs the entire credit of revising the Comparative Osteology. To Mr. D'Arcy Power, the present Curator, I am greatly indebted for the able assistance rendered by him in revising the proof sheets. ANTHONY A. BOWLBY. August, 1884.

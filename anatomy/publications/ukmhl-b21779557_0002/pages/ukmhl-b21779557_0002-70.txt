54 SERIES III. CELLULAR, FIBEO-CELLULAE, AEEOLAE, OE CONNECTIVE TISSUE. —♦— •27. Two portions of Cellular Tissue, from the scrotum, inflated and dried. The air impelled into the tissue has separated the bundles and lamellae of its component filaments, so that they form a kind of cells or spaces, communicating with each other, and of various size and shape. 3. 1 28. Fibro-cellular Tissue, in the form of membrane, from the Peritoneum. The membrane is formed by the interweaving of bundles of the component filaments of the tissue. 3. 2 29. A similar specimen, extended and in some measure unravelled, so as to show more plainly the irregularity of size and direction in the fasciculi of which it is composed. 3. 3 30. A portion of Peritoneum, dried after the minute injection of its blood vessels. The arrangement of the principal vessels is arborescent, with widely diverging branches, and numerous anastomoses. Each artery appears associated with a vein. 3. 4 31. A portion of Pleura, similarly prepared, and exhibiting a similar arrange- ment of its blood vessels. 3. 5 The two preceding specimens were prepared by Professor Scarpa, and given by him to Sir George Burrows, by whom they were presented to the Museum. 32. A portion of Adipose Tissue from the abdominal cavity of a Boa Constrictor (Python Seb«). The lobules are extremely large, and remarkably distinct, being loosely connected by a small quantity of areolar tissue. 3. 6

ABNORJIAL COXDITIOXS OF THE DIGESTIVE ORGANS. 44 A bristle is passed into a very minute hole in tlie poucli of mucous membrane through which the cavity of the gut communicated with the anal aperture. From a child aged 4 days. Previous to admission into the Hospital, a svirgeon had attempted to pass his finger into the rectum, and it would appear that in so doing he had peeled up the mucous membrane as seen in the specimen, for on passing the finger into the anus it entered a capacious pouch which did not apparently communicate with the bowel. The hole in the rectal wall was caused by an attempt to relieve the obstruction by the passage of a catheter. 3646. A Rectum and Bladder. The rectum terminates in a cul-de-sac about an inch from the anus. The urachus is pervious. There is no anal depression. A. 18 Presented by Thomas Davis, Esq. 3647. The Rectum of a Child 14 months old, in which, at birth, the anus was imperforate. The rectum was punctured from the anus with a trochar, and the aperture remained open for the passage of fteces. Where the partition existed between the rectum and anus there is now an annular fold of mucous membrane, projecting, like a perforated diaphragm, in the canal of the intestine, about two-thirds of an inch from the anus. At this fold the mucous membi'aue is smooth, and appears very dense ; above and below it is deeply wrinkled. The muscular coat of the rectum above the fold is very thick. A. 22 Presented by Henry Bateman, Esq. 3648. A similar specimen from a Child who lived two years after the puncture of the rectum. The tissues punctured appear to have been torn or cut in making the preparation; but the insufficiency of the aperture is proved by the great distension, the thick muscular walls, and the large follicles, of the rectum above it. a. 23

45 SERIES VII. ABNORMAL CONDITIOKS OF THE URINARY ORGANS. CLASS I.â€”YARIATION. (A.) or THE KIDNEY. 3649. Kidneys united at tlieir lower ends by a broad band of renal substance, so as to form a continuous mass shaped like a horse-shoe. Each lateral half has a pelvis, the median portion has none. A. 108 3650. A similar specimen of unusually large size. The median portion has separate arteries and veins, but no pelvis. A. 109 3651. A similar specimen. A. 110 3652. A Dissection of a Horse-shoe Kidney in an Infant. 3653. A Horse-shoe Kidney from an Infant. It lay to the left of the vertebrae. 3654. Kidneys of unequal size, and combined into an irregular form by portions which passed across the median line. A. Ill 3655. A lobulated Kidney from an Adult. It consists of several nearly distinct portions loosely connected with a common elongated pelvis, and of unnatural structure, apparently from granular degeneration. The other kidney was sound. A. 111a 3656. A Kidney, the infundibula of which unite to form the ureter, without the intervention of a pelvis. A. 112 3657. A right Kidney, with the adjacent blood vessels injected. The kidney rests on the right common iliac artery, with its hilus directed forwards. It receives one artery, at its hilus, from the left common iliac, and two from the aorta, just above the bifurcation. One of these two passes behind the kidney, winds round it to its anterior surface, and nearly reaches the hilus before it enters the kidney. A. 115 3658. The Kidneys from a Man, aged 24 years. The left kidney, which is smaller and rounder than natural, lay on the spinal column between the common iliac arteries ; it was not easily movable, that is not a floating kidney ; the pelvis lay between the organ and the spine. The kidney was supplied by three small arteries derived from tlie right common iliac ; no trace of the left renal

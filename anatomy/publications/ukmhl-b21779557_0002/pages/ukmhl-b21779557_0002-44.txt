28 ABNORMAL CONDITIONS OF THE VASCULAR SYSTEM. 3534. The Arch of an Aorta, from which arise:â€”(1) the right carotid artery; (2) the left carotid; (3) the left vertebral; (4) the left subclavian; (5) the right subclavian. A. 52 3535. The Arch of an Aorta, showing an abnormal arrangement of the branches. The carotids are given oS by a large trunk corresponding in position to the innominate artery. The left subclavian is the second branch ; the right sub- clavian is given off from the termination of the arch, and passes between the trachea and oesophagus to the right side. Presented by W. Harrison Cripps, Esq. 3536. An Abdominal Aorta giving off on the left side four, and on the right three, renal arteries. A. 53 3537. An Abdominal Aorta, with five renal arteries proceeding from it to the left kidney. A. 54 3538. The Bifurcation of an Abdominal Aorta; the common iliac arteries are less than an inch in length. A. 55 3539. The Bifurcation of an Abdominal Aorta, with common iliac arteries three inches and a half in length. It is probable that this difference of length in the common iliac arteries was due entirely to the variation in the place of division of the aorta; and that in both cases the division of the common iliacs took place opposite the same point, the upper margin of the sacro-iliac symphysis. A. 56 3540. Arteries from a Neck. The innominate gives a branch to tLe thyroid gland (arteria thyroidea ima). A. 57 3541. A similar specimen. A. 58 3542. A Thyroid Gland of ordinary size, to which six arteries pass, each as large as an average inferior thyroid artery. Of the two additional arteries, one pro- ceeds from the innominate, the other from the right common carotid an inch from its origin. A. 59 3543. Common Carotid Arteries, dividing opposite the cricoid cartilage. A. 60 3544. An external Carotid Artery, giving off all its branches close to its own origin. The bulbous form of the internal carotid artery is here very marked. A. 61 3545. Right Carotid Arteries. Of the usual branches of the external carotid, two arise from the common carotid, namely, the occipital and the superior thyroid ; and one, probably the posterior auricular, arises from the internal carotid. A. 62 3546. An external Carotid Artery, with two superior thyroid arteries arising close to its origin. A. 63 3547. Internal Carotid Arteries, each of which makes a long sigmoid curve before entering the petrous bone. A. 64 3548. A Left Subclavian Artery, passing in front of the scalenus anticus muscle. The risrht subclavian takes the usual course. A. 65 3549. Arteries of the Neck. The right vertebral artery enters its canal at the fourth cervical vertebra, the left at the si^th. A. 66

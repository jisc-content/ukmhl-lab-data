194 MOLLUSCA. 1616. Patella Vulgata (Common Limpet). The apex of the cone is turned for- wards over the animal's head. Within the shell is seen the body of the animal, much contracted. The foot, in the recent stage, is as large as the margin of the shell. The tentacles are seen on each side of the head. The inner surface of the mantle margin is fringed. 1617. Patella Vulgata (Common Limpet). 1618. Patella Pellucida. 1619. Voluta Magellanica. CHITONIDiE. 1620. Chiton. The shell is composed of eight imbricating plates, which causes the animal to resemble somewhat a crustacean in appearance. The coriaceous mantle forms an expanded margin round the body. Remnants of the branchiae which are disposed round the posterior portion of the body, can be seen between the foot and the mantle. TORNATELLlD.ffi. 1621. Three specimens of Tornatella Tomatilis on glass. 1622. Scaphanda. DOKIDiE. 1623. Doris. Tlie animal is suspended by the posterior portion of the body. In the Doridae the mantle is wanting. On the dorsal surface is seen the tuft of gill plumes surrounding the anus; further forwai-d are two papilliform eleva- tions, each having a central orifice, which mark the place where the tentacles are situated, which in these sea slugs are completely retractile. Sub-Class B.â€”PULMOGASTEROPODA. HELICIDiE. 1624. Helix Aspera (Garden Snail). The shell is cut so as to show the structure of the whorls. 1625. Two specimens of Helix Aspera. The lower specimen shows the way in which the animal has repaired a comminuted fracture of its shell. The fresh calcareous material is white, not marked like the older portions of the shell. 1626. Helix Aspera and Helix Pomatia. Tlie animals are much retracted, and nearly hidden in their shells. 1627. Helix Pomatia (Edible Snail), removed from its shell. This specimen shows well the foot whence the Gasteropoda obtain their names.

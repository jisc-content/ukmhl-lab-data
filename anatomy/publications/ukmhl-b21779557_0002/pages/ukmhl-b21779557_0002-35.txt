ABNORMAL CONDITIONS OF THE AXIS. 19 one-eighth. Both these bones present a more marked posterior curve than is natural, but their epiphyses are not very large. The bones of the right fore- arm are similarly shortened, the radius however being one-eighth of an inch longer than its fellow on the opposite side. At its upper end, the right ulna presents a very sharp curve with the concavity posteriorly. On the right hand there are six digits, on the left a similar number, but the little finger of this hand has in addition a small outgrowth from the tip of the fifth finger. The bones of the lower extremity are, like those of the upper, much shortened. The epiphyses of the right tibia are large compared with the shaft, which is curved in an outward and forward direction ; the fibula is also shortened. Only a part of the left tibia and fibula have been preserved ; their shafts are thickened, and their lower epiphyses large compared with the rest of the bone. The right foot has six metacarpal bones, but seven toes, two of the latter being connected with the first metacarpal bone. On the left foot are seven toes. A complete absence of all attempts at ossification at the junction of the epiphyses with the diaphyses was found on microscopical examination. As in the preceding specimens, there was also an ingrowth of fibrous tissue similar to that already described. The four previous specimens are described by Mr. Bowlby in the Transactions of the Pathological Society for 1883-84.

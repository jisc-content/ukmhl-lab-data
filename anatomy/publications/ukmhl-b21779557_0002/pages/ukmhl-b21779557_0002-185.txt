DEVELOPMENT OF THE OVUM. 169 Presented by Dr. Matthews Duncan. 1285. A similar specimen, showing in addition the abdominal position of the bladder. 35. 59 1286. Part of a FcBtus, with the testicles, in the course of their descent, lying immediately above the internal inguinal rings. 35. 61 1287. Part of a Foetus, with the testicles in the scrotum. Bristles are passed through the canals of communication between the cavities of the tunicse vaginales and the peritoneum. 35. 62 1288. The lower part of a Foetus, with the right testicle in the abdomen, and the left in the scrotum. 35. 63 1289. Portion of a Foetal Small Intestine, with largely developed villi, but no valvulse conniventes. 35. 39 1290. Portion of Foetal Ileum, with the caecum and its appendix turned inside out. The appendix is of proportionally large diameter, and enlarges into its continuity with the caecum much more gradually than in the perfect state. 35. 40 1291. The lower end of the Ileum, with the Cfecum, Colon, and Rectum of a Foetus, inflated and dried after injection of their blood vessels. 35. 41 1292. A Foetal Thymus Gland. 35. 42 1293. Placenta, with part of the Umbilical Cord. The foetal blood vessels are injected. 35. 17 1294. Placenta, from which, by maceration and washing, nearly all the blood was removed. The finely flocculent structure is thus shown which is formed by the growth of the villi of the chorion and their enclosed foetal blood vessels. 35. 18 1295. A similar specimen. 35. 19 Presented by Dr. Conquest. 1296. A similar specimen, prepared after injection of the foetal blood vessels. 35. 20 1297. Placenta and Cord, di*ied after the injection of their principal blood vessels, so as to show the mutually entwining spiral course of the umbilical arteries and vein within the cord, and their large diverging branches on the foetal surface of the placenta. 35. 21 1298. A similar specimen, with the cord attached to the edge of the placenta. (Battledore placenta.) 35. 22 Presented, â– with the preceding, by Dr. Conquest. 1299. A Battledore Placenta. 1300. Triplets at about the fourth month of pregnancy. Each foetus is provided with a separate amnion, no two of the amnia being in any way fused, although in very close contact. There is one chorion into which the umbilical cords are inserted.

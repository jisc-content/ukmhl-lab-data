162 ORGANS OF GENERATION IN THE FEMALE. Presented by Dr. Maltliows Duncan. 1187. Aa Ovary, in part of which bhe blood vessels are minutely injected. It contains a circnmscribed mass of ochre-yellow colour, and a small nearly closed cavity bounded by a material of nearly similar colour. 33. 27 1188. A Uterus, with the ovaries and other adjacent parts, from a woman who was supposed to have been impregnated a short time before death. The interior of the uterus is rough from the discharge of the dccidua. A bristle is passed through an aperture on the surface of the left ovary, into a cavity from which it was presumed the ovum was discharged, but which has the characters of a complete corpus luteum. 33. 18 1189. An Ovum at about the fourteenth day after impregnation. 35. 1 Presented by Dr. Conquest. 1190. An Ovum at about the third week of pregnancy. As in the preceding specimen, only the exterior of the ovum, with its uniformly flocculent or villous chorion, is shown. 35. 2 1191. An Ovum at about the third week. The embryo is injured ; its posterior half, with the umbilical vesicle, remaining connected with the interior of the chorion. 35. 3 1192. An Owm about two weeks after impregnation. Immediately beneath the villous chorion may be seen the outer layer of the amnion, separated by a small space from the true amniotic sac. The latter is very small, being no more than one-sixth of the whole bulk of the specimen. Presented by Dr. Matthews Duncan. 1193. Decidua and part of the Membranes about twenty-one days from the cessation of menstruation. 35. 79 1194. An Ovum at about the third week. The chorion has been slit open and the amniotic bag turned out. The foetus, about one-eighth of an inch in length, can be seen lying close to the chorion. Presented by Dr. Gibson. 1195. An Ovum in its membranes at the fourth week of pregnancy, showing the shaggy chorion separated from the decidua. 1198. An Ovum about one month after impregnation. 35. 91 1197. An Ovum between the thii'd and fourth week; the foetus measui'cs a quarter of an inch in length. Presented by Dr. Gibson. 1198. An Ovum at about the fifth week, without the maternal decidua. 35. 5 1199. An Ovum at about the fifth week, showing the embryo, membranes, and a shred of decidua. 35. 6 1200. Tlio Membranes of an Ovum at about the sixth week, showing the cavity lined by the amnion and surrounded by the decidua vera, reflexa, and serotiua. The decidua vera is partly turned back so as to show the line of junction with the decidua reflexa and its continuity above with the decidua serotina.

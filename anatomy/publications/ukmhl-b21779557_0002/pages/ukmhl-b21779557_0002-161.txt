145 THE EYE AND ITS ACCESSORY ORGANS. 1002. The Head of a Frog. On the left side a bristle has been passed beneath the superior oblique muscle which arises from the front part of the inner wall of the orbit. On both sides a bristle has been passed beneath the muscles upon which the eyeball rests and which form the floor of the orbit. 25. 58 1003. The Scaly Integument spontaneoasly detached from the Head of a Snake, including the transparent membranes separated in connection with it from the surface of the conjunctivae. 25. 4 1004. Eye of a young Crocodile (Crocodilus Acutus), showing the third eyelid or nictitating membrane. 25. 47 1005. Section through the Eyeball of a Turtle, showing the cartilaginous sclerotic coat with its thickness very much increased at the posterior part of the globe. '25. 52 1006. The Eye of a Turtle, with the lacrymal gland and duct. The gland is very large, elongated, and deeply lobed; a short duct, through which a portion of glass is passed, extends from it, and opens just above the external angle of the eye. 25.40 Presented by J. Bodman, Esq. 1007. The Cornea of a Turkey, dried, with the ring formed of imbricated bony plates with which it is surrounded, and which are enclosed in the substance of the sclerotic. 25. 3 1008. Part of the Head of a Turkey. On the right side the oblique muscles are shown, and the superior oblique is seen to arise from the front and inner wall of the orbit, immediately above the inferior oblique. On the left side the muscles have been divided and a bristle passed beneath the so-called Harderiau gland. 25. 57 1009. The Eyeball of a Turkey. It shows the dark cartilaginous sclerotic, with the plates of bone around the margin of the cornea. 25. 59 1010. The Cornea and front part of the Sclerotic of a similar Eyeball. 25. 60 1011. The two halves of the Lens of a Norwegian Owl. The nucleus remains transparent notwithstanding prolonged immersion in strong spirit. 25. 61 1012. Part of the Eye of an Ostrich, displaying the ciliary processes and iris, after the removal of the greater part of the dark pigment. 25. 35 1013. Part of the Eye of an Ostrich, showing the Pecten or Marsupium, an organ peculiar to the eye of birds. It is formed of membranous folded laminas, which are prolonged from the choroid, arranged in the shape of a four-sided pyramid, extending from around the entrance of the optic nerve to the posterior part of the crystalline lens. 25. 36 1014. Section of the Eye of an Ostrich, in which are more distinctly shown the relations of the marsupium to the retina, and its attachment by a portion of the hyaloid membrane to one side of the posterior surface of the capsule of the lens. 25. 37 1015. The Eye of a Brown Owl (Strix stridula), with the nictitating membrane and its muscles. The anterior part of the eye extends forwards, in a nearly

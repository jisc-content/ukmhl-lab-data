THE SKIN AND ITS APPENDAGES. 152 1084. Portion of a Tattooed Skin from the fore-arm of a man. 27. 33 1085. Portion of Tattooed Skin. 27. 34 1086. Specimen of Tattooed Skin. 1087. The Skin surrounding an Anus, together with the lower part of the rectum, inverted, so as to show the contrast between skin and mucous membrane, and between the cuticles by which they are severally covered. 27. 13 1088. A similar preparation from an African. Here are also seen the orifices of the numerous sebaceous glands around the anus. 27. 14 1089. The Cuticle of an Infant's Hand, removed, after putrefaction, in a single piece. 27. 15 1090. A similar preparation of the Cuticle of a Foot. In both instances the nails are connected with the cuticle. 27. 16 1091. Portions of the Skin of a Negro. In the upper specimen a part of the dark brown cuticle is reflected in a single layer; and to the under surface of this layer are attached numerous colourless prolongations of cuticle, which extended into hair-follicles and sweat-glands. In the lower specimen a part of the cuticle is reflected in two layers, of which the internal is that which has been named rete mucosum or rete nigrum; the external dried and less coloured layer being that more especially named epidermis. 27. 17 1092. A similar specimen, with the cuticle reflected in two layers. The internal layer, or rete mucosum, is thicker than natural, in consequence of chronic inflammation of the skin. The specimen was taken from the same leg as 1078. 27. 18 1093. Part of the Skin of the Heel from the same leg. The cuticle is colonrless, â– with the exception of a small quantity of pale brownish colouring matter in the deepest layers of the portion which extended up the side of the heel. The inferior surface of the cuticle presents some small wart-like elevations, which were imbedded in the surface of the cutis. 27. 19 1094. Portion of the Skin of a Negro, with the cuticle reflected in two layers; but both layers are completely decolorized by the long action of light and the products of decomposed spirit. 27. 20 1095. Portion of Caticle reflected with the Nail from a Great Toe. The cuticle is firmly attached to all the borders of the nail, and from the borders is reflected for a short distance upon each of the fi"ee surfaces. The inferior surface of the nail has, on its anterior three-fourths, a laminated structure, with thin lamella-like ridges, arranged in parallel longitudinal lines ; the corres- ponding surface of the posterior fourth presents a similax", but less distinct and less orderly, structure. 27. 22 1096. Sections of the end of a Great Toe, with an old Nail nearly exfoliated, and a new one formed in its place. In the upper specimen, the old nail is completely separated ; in the lower, it remains attached (as it was during life) to the anterior half of the new one, their opposed surfaces exactly fitting to each other. From this specimen an outer layer of cuticle was removed ; an inner layer, corresponding with the rete mucosum of the Negro, remains attached to the cutis, and has the characteristic reticulated surface. 27. 23

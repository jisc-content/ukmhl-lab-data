BOTANICAL SPECIMENS. 225 Geum URBANUM, L. (Avens, Herb Bennet.) Root. (Clove Boot, Badix Garyophyllata.) Note.—This root has been found in large proportion with arnica as an adulterant. It is dis- tinguished from Arnica by its astringent taste, larger size, and by being a true vertical root, not a rhizome. For fig. of root, see Goehel und Kunze, pt. ii, taf. xxv, fig. 2. [C. P. S.j Tragaeia, L. (Strawberry.) Flower (section). Wote.—Floral formula, [5. (5). 5. Oo.] 00 ; the epicalyx of five bracts adherent to the calyx is of stipiilar origin ; each apparently consists of two confluent stipules. Rosa Damascena, Miller. (DamasJc Base.) Petals. JSFote.—Otto of rose is largely adulterated with Turkish oil of geranium, or oil of gingergrass, (Andropogon nardus, Zi.) The purest otto is imported in bottles called " cappers." The oil imported in gilt bottles is generally much adulterated. [C. P. S.] Rosa canina, L. (Dog Bose.) Flower (section). Note.—Floral formula, 5. 5. oo. oo. 05?. the sepals are not coherent as in other genera of Kosacefe, tlie floral whorls being inserted on a hollow receptacular tube (the hip), within wliich the achenes are situated. Cydonia vulgaris, Pers. Pyeus Ctdgnu, L. (Quince.) Seeds. Note.—These seeds are readily distinguished from similar seeds of other fruits by the fai t that they always adhere together in small groups. They are used as an emollient application to the skin. [C. P. 8.] Pyrus malus, L. (Apple.) Flower (section). Note. — Floral formula, {[(5). 5. 00 .] ± (5)}. Obs. the 5 carpels are "falsely syncarpous," more or less coherent, ± ( ), by accidental cohesion only in consequence of the fleshy nature of the receptacular tube. (See preparations of abnormal and proliferous pears, s. Tbeatology). HALORAGE-ffi. Trapa natans, L. (Water Caltrops.) Note.—The fruit is remarkable for its four horns produced from the receptacular tube surrounding the ovary. It is a native of Europe. The seeds of this and other species of India, China, and Japan, abound with starch ; and those of T. natans are called Jesuit's nuts and Chataigne d'Eau, and are ground into flour for bread. Those of T. bispinosa, the Sinyhara of Kashmir, feed 30,000 persons for five months in the year. T. bicornis is the Ling of the Chinese. MYRTACE^. Eucalyptus globulus, Labill. (Blue Gum Tree.) Tar, Vinegar, Acetic Acid. Note.—The gum is very astringent, and soluble in water, but the solution is turbid when cold. Eucalyptol is that portion of the volatile oil whioli boils regularly at 175° F. For fig. of plant, see Bentley and Trimen, Med. Plants, tab. 109. [C. P. S.] Eucalyptus mannifeba, A Cunn. Saccharine exudation. (Australian Manna.) Note.—E. vimiualis, Labill (stringy bark), yields a similar substance. Q

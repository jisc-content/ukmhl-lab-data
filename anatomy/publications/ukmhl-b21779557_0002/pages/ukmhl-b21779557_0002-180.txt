164 ORGANS OF GENERATION IN THE FEMALE. 1210. An Ovum at the beginning of the third month. The amnion, chorion, and decidua are separated, and the external surface of the placenta is exposed. 35. 9 1211. An Ovum in the third month. The decidua is inverted, so as to show on its inner surface the numerous orifices of tubules. The umbilical cord is coiled thrice round the neck of the foetus. 35. 10 Presented by Dr. Conquest. 1212. An Ovum at about the same date, with the umbilical cord coiled four times round the neck of the foetus. 35. 11 Presented by Dr. Conquest. 1213. Section of a Uterus early in the third month of pregnancy. 33. 10 1214. Section of a Uterus in about the third month of gestation. The two layers of the membrana decidua are separated, and a part of the amnion is reflected from the surface of the placenta. 33. 9 1215. The Membranes of an Ovum at about the end of the third month. The amnion, chorion, and decidua are separated. 35. 12 1216. The Uterus at about the end of the fourth month of pregnancy, opened from behind, and showing its flattened globular form. There is a coi'pus luteum in the left ovary. Presented by Dr. Matthews Duncan. 1217. A Foetus in the fourth month, with its amnion and placenta. 35. 13 1218. A Uterus, with the Foetus and its Membranes, in the fourth month of gestation. The decidua is separated from the interior surface of the uterus, whose laminated muscular structure is shown in the section through its walls. The ovula Nabothi are large and numerous. The left ovary contains a corpus luteum, with a large central cavity bounded by a thin opaque white membrane, around which is a layer of yellow substance, nearly a line in thickness. 33. 1 1219. A similar specimen ; the foetus is in its natural position, with the umbilical cord twisted round its arm. 33. 2 1220. A Uterus at the end of the fourth month of pregnancy. It measures seven and a quarter inches in length, the cervix being an inch and a half. The cord, eight and a half inches long, is attached to the margin of the placenta, near the left Fallopian tube. The foetus measures nine inches. 33. 49 1221. A Uterus, with the Foetus and its Membranes, between the fourth and fifth months of gestation. The neck of the uterus is laid open to show the mucous plug which occludes its canal. 33. 37 1222. A Uterus, with the Foetus and its Membranes, in sHit, at about the fifth month of gestation. The neck of the uterus, its globular body, and its trans- versely wide external orifice, are here shown. The umbilical cord is twisted round the neck of the foetus. 33. 3 Presented, witli tlic preceding specimen, by Dr. Conquest. 1223. A Foetus in the fifth month, with its amnion, cliorion, and placenta. The natural position of the child, with its several parts close-packed, may be observed. 33. 14

122 SERIES XVII. THE ORGANS FOE ABSORPTION OF NUTRIMENT; LACTEAL AND LYMPHATIC VESSELS AND G-LANDS. 755. Portion of Small Intestine, with its mesentery, in which the principal lacteal vessels are full of chyle. The veins are injected with some blue material. 15. 1 756. A similar specimen. ' 15. 2 757. Part of the Surface of a Liver, in which the lymphatics are filled with mercury. The beaded form of the vessels derived fi'om the constrictions in the situation of their valves is distinctly shown. 15. 3 758. The Lymphatic Trunks of a Gall-Bladder filled with mercury. 15. 4 759. Part of a Spleen, with its lymphatic vessels similarly filled. 15. 5 760. Large Lymphatic Vessels, filled with mercury ; they were probably seated in the subcutaneous tissue. 15. 6 761. A similar specimen. 15. 7 762. Large Lymphatic Vessels and Glands filled with mercury. The form and arrangement of the valves of the lymphatics may be discerned by the consti'ic- tions of their walls. Each large lymphatic, when, as au afferent vessel, it reaches the lymphatic gland, divides into several branches, which run on the surface of tlie gland, and subdividing give origin to the plexus of minute vessels of which the greater part of the gland appears composed. From this plexus are derived other and larger efferent lymphatics, which leave the gland in the same manner as the afferent vessels enter it, but proceed from it in the opposite direction. 15. 12 763. A similar specimen. 15. 13 764. A similar specimen, in which both the afferent and the efl^'erent vessels are well shown. 15. 14

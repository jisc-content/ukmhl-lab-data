THE OSSEOUS SYSTEM. 71 189. Skull of a Kaffir. 28. 344 190. A similar specimen. 28. 345 190a. Calvaria of a Hottentot who was hanged for murder. 191. Skull of an African Negro, illustrating the "Negro form," and pre- senting, very strongly marked, the prognathous and dolichocephalic characters. (1) The jaws are very prominent, and the facial angle commensurately small; (2) the incisor and canine teeth project obliquely forwards, meeting at an obtuse angle; (3) the face is flat, though less so than in the preceding form ; (4) the forehead is very narrow, receding, low, not widening as it ascends ; (5) the length of the skull is great in proportion to its width and height; (6) the total capacity of the skull is small. 28. 47 192. Skull of an African Negro. With the other characteristics rather less marked than in the preceding skull, this shows a peculiar flatness of the temporal and lower parietal regions, and a marked hollowing of the temporal portion of the sphenoid bone, leaving a great space for the temporal muscle. 28. 48 193. Skull of an African Negro. Except in a somewhat greater prominence of the jaws, it scarcely deviates from the average characters of the oval or Cau- casian form. The temporal suture is obliterated. 28. 49 194. A similar specimen; but with a rather flatter and wider face, and with a more pyramidal form of the forehead. 28. 50 195. Skull of an African Negro, in which width and flatness of the face are com- bined with prominence of the jaws. In other characters also this skull has a form intermediate between the well-marked pyramidal and prognathous forms. 28. 51 196. Skull of an African Negro, in form intermediate between the oval and the prognathous. 28. 52 197. A similar specimen. 28. 53 198. Skull of a Man, the offspring of a Mulatto and an European. The slight projection of the jaws and chin, and the flatness of the temporal regions, are the only Negro features that it presents. 28. 54 Presented by C. L. Norton, Esq. 199.

The face is broad and flat; the jaws very wide, but not very prominent; the supra-orbital ridges are very prominent, and between them a remarkable prominence over the frontal sinuses far overhangs the nasal bones; the forehead is extremely narrow, and becomes narrower as it ascends; the general form of the cranium is long, narrow, and high; its height however is chiefly in its median part, and its base is wide. 28. 56 202. Skull of a Native of Moreton Bay, New South Wales, presenting the same characteristics, but rather less marked. 28. 57 Presented, witli the preceding, by Josepli Hodgson, Esq.

20 SERIES 11. ABNORMAL CONDITIONS OF THE LIMBS. CLASS I.â€”VARIATION. (A.) IN THE SHOULDER GIRDLE. 3493, 3494. Tlie ScapulaB and Clavicles of an Adult. On the inferior surface of each clavicle, about an inch from its scapular extremity, there is a broad oval process, the flattened free surface of which articulates with the upper surface of the base of the coracoid process. The articulations were provided with cartilages and synovial membranes. 3495. Portion of a Scapula and the Acromial end of a Clavicle. An irregular buttress of bone projects from the under surface of the clavicle, about one inch from its acromial extremity, and was connected by ligamentous tissue to an irregular expanded articular surface upon the upper border of the scapula and inner surface of the coracoid process. The promontory of bone occupies some- what the position of the conoid ligament. Obtained from the dissecting room. 3496. A Shoulder Joint. The long tendon of the biceps muscle is unusually slender, and lies between the synovial and fibrous layers of the capsule. A. 156 3497. A Shoulder Joint in which there is partial absorption of the articular cartilage upon the head of the humerus and glenoid cavity. The tendon of the biceps is continued on the outside of the capsule of the joint, to the upper edge of the glenoid cavity. There is also a distinct slip of this tendon adherent to the lower part of the bicipital groove in the humerus. It is not known whether this condition of the tendon of the biceps was the result of injury or disease, or a congenital defect. The other shovildcr joint presented a similar arrangement. (B.) IN THE DIGITS. 3498. Portion of an Adult Hand with a Supernumerary Thumb. This thumb is small and distorted; but it has a distinct flexor muscle and tendon, and a slip of tendon jiasses to it from that of the long flexor of the normal thumb. There is an appearance of a separate extensor tendon passing to the additional thumb. A. 158

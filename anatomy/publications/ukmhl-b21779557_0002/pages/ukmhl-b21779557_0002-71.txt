55 SERIES IV. —♦— FIBROUS AND TENDINOUS TISSUES. —♦— 33. A Tendo Achillis, with its parallel component fasciculi of tendinous fibres spread out and a little separated. 4. 1 34. A. Tendo Achillis, of which the component fasciculi are more completely separated. The margins of several of the fasciculi are flocculent with the cellular tissue by which they were connected to those adjacent to them. 4. 2 35. Tendons of the extensor muscles of the fingers dried after the injection of their blood vessels. The principal vessels within the tendons run in long parallel lines in the cellular tissue between the fasciculi, and communicate by short transverse branches. The arborescent vessels apparent on the surf aces of the tendons belong to the cellular tissue with which, as with sheaths, the several tendons were invested. 4. 3 36. One of the flexor tendons of the fore leg of a Calf, exhibiting, more perfectly than the preceding specimen, the arrangement of the long parallel blood vessels in the interfascicular cellular tissue, and their transverse communi- cating branches. 4. 4 The spenimen is described bv Mr. Paget in a paper " On the Blood Vessels of Tendinous Tissues," in the London Medical Gazette, vol. xxiv, p. 562. 37. Part of a Tendon from a Horse, dried after the minute injection of its blood vessels with mercury. Longitudinal vessels are shown like those in the preceding specimens ; but the vessels here principally shown are the arborescent arteries and veins of the cellular tissue investing the tendons. These form an intricate network, and every artery appears to be accompanied by two veins. 4.5 Prepared and presented by Thomas Wormald, Esq.

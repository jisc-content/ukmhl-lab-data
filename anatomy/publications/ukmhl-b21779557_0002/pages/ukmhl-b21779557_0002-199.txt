ANNULOIDA—SCOLECIDA. 183 1467. The dried shell of Spatangus Purpureus. Many of the spines have become broken or rubbed off. 1468. Acrocladia Mammillata. The massive spines of this species give the animal a curious appearance. Many of the spines have become detached, and some are fastened on the glass. Class II.—SCOLECIDA. TREMATODA. 1463. Distoma Hepaticum. Common Liver Fluke from the sheep. 1470. Distoma Hepaticum. Fluke from liver of sheep. 1471. Single specimens of the same mounted on glass slides. CESTODA. 1472. Taenia Mediocanellata. The head is seen supported by the loops of wire. No ripe proglottides similar to those in No. 1474 remain attached to the distal end. 1473. Head and proximal segments of Taenia Mediocanellata. 1474. Taenia Solium (common Tape Worm). The head and proximal part of the animal is not shown, the preparation consisting of numerous joints nearly mature. This species is not so common in London as Taenia Mediocanel- lata. 1475. Another specimen of Taenia Solium. 1476. A portion of Taenia Solium. The generative organs are shown, the OA'ary being injected with mercury. 1477. Cysticercus Cellulosae. From a portion of measly pork. The cystic or scolex form of Taenia Solium. 1478. Taenia Serrata. Head and proximal joints, from a cat. 1479. Bothriocephalus Latus. The head and finer portions, or proximal end, of the worm were not obtained. The position of the outlets of the generative organs at once enables one to separate this animal from the common tape worm. The worm is comparatively rare in England. The specimen was expelled from the intestines of a dock labourer at the East India Docks. 1480. Portion of Bothriocephalus latus passed from the intestines of a young woman, born of Swiss parents, but living in Scotland. 1481. Taenia Serrata from small intestines of dog. 1482. Taenia Echinococcus Veterinorum (pill box Hydatid). In the upper part of the preparation is suspended the maternal cyst, which has ruptured and given exit to the daughter cysts, which lie at the bottom of the jar. Some of the larger daughter cysts may be seen to contain secondary

Note.—In Madagascar the natives formerly placed unlimited confidence in the trial by ordeal with the poisonous seed of this plant. It was believed to be an infallible detector of guilt; the seed is pounded, and a small piece swallowed by each person to be tried ; those in whom it causes vomiting only, escape ; but to those who retain it, it is quickly fatal. gentianace^. Gentiana lutea, L. Root. {Gentian Boot.) Flower (section). Fruit, (From Tete Noire.) Note.—Floral formula, (5).[(5). 5].(2).

SERIES XXXI. Presented by Dr. Matthews Duncan. ORGANS OF GENERATION IN THE FEMALE IN AN UNIMPRE6NATED CONDITION. 1154. An Ovary, of which the blood vessels are minutely injected. Its fibrous covering or tunica albuginea presents numerous depressions or cicatrices indi- cating the former discharge of ova. On section its interior substance or stroma appears highly vascular; and the cavities of many Graafian vesicles or ovisacs are imbedded in it. 32. 1 1155. An Ovary bisected and showing Graafian follicles. Presented by Dr. Matthews Duncan. 1156. Two Ovaries, in which the Graafian vesicles, without any apparent change of texture, are large beyond the ordinary limits of health. 32. 2 1157. Ovaries, with thePallopian Tubes or Oviducts. Bristles are passed through the tubes, and their fimbriated extremities are displayed in their ordinary relation to the ovaries. 32. 3 1158. A Fallopian Tube, of which the bloodvessels are minutely injected; the canal is laid open, and the fimbriae are displayed. 32. 4 1159. The Internal Organs of Generation of a Girl aged 10 years. The length of the neck of the uterus in proportion to its body may be observed. The slight anteflexion which is present is not in excess of that which is frequently noticed in a majority of normal uteri. The vagina is rugose, the ovaries smooth, and the Graafian vesicles filled with a substance which, in the recent state, appeared gelatinous. 32. 12 1160. Internal Organs of Generation from a Girl 13 years old. 32. 11 1161. A similar specimen from a Girl 17 years old, who had menstruated only once. The uterus is imperfectly developed. 32. 10 1162.

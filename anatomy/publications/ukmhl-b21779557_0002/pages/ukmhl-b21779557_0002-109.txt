Sections of the Skull of a Wood Owl (Strix Aluco). They show the remarkable elevation of the anterior part of the cranium, produced by the large air cavities in the diploe, especially of the nasal, frontal, and parietal bones. 28. 259a 446. Skull of an Owl. 447. Skull of an Owl. 448. Sections of the Skull of an Hornbill (Buceros). It presents a very remarkable example of the formation of air cavities in the bones, all the cranial and maxillary bones (like nearly all the rest of the bones of the skeleton of this bird) being internally intersected by slender osseous filaments and lamellae, which in the recent state supported the membranes of air cells communicating with the lungs. The maxillary and nasal bones especially are as if inflated with air. The short and strong zygomatic or jugal arch, and the tubular form of the united palatine bones and vomer, may be also observed in this skull. 28. 262ji 449. A similar specimen. 450. Skull of a Spoonbill (Platalea lencorodia). 28. 271a 451. Skull of a Macaw (Macrocercus). 28. 264 452. Skull of an American Crane (Mycteria Americana). The partition between the orbits formed by the ethmoid bone is here completely osseous, while in the preceding specimen it appears wanting, a large aperture existing which was closed by membrane. 28. 271 Presented by Arnold Henry, Esq. 453.

BOTANICAL SPECIMENS. 235 BoRAGO OFFICINALIS, L. (Borage.) Flower in section. ]fote.—Flora formula, (5). r(5).5]. (2). Obs., stamens provided with an obtuse tooth. The pistil resembles that of the Labiatie in having the ovary deeply four-lobed, with a gynobasic style. The common borage when steeped in water imparts coolness to it, and is used in the beverage called cold tankard. LiTHOSPEEMUM OFFICINALE, L. (GrOWlWell.) Fruit (Nutlets). Note.—The lobes of the ovary which separate as nutlets have a siliceous and calcareous pericarp. CONVOLVULACE-ffi. BxOGONiUM PURGA, Benth; Ipom(ea puega, Hayne. (Vera Cruz Jalap.) Root. Also of I. siMtiLANS, Hanh., (Tampico Jalap.) Note.—True jalap is distinguished from Tampico by being usually turnip-shaped or pear- shaperl, by its density, by not being shrunken, and by being marked with numerous little transverse scars, which are absent in Tampico Jalap. The root contains 15 per cent, of resin, about 5 per cent, of which is soluble in ether, the rest insoluble. [C. P. S.] Batatas edulis, Choisy. Root; specimens preserved wet. (Sweet Potato.) Dried slices as " biscuit." Starch from root. Note.—The tubercular root is used as a substitute for potatoes in warm countries. Ipom^ia (Phaebttis), Nil, Ghoisy. Seeds. (Kaladana.) Note.—The resin (Kaladana resin) contained in the seeds is probably identical with that of true jalap, being insoluble in ether. It is official in the Pharm. Ind., as well as an extract, tincture, and compound powder. The specific name Nil, is a Hindustanee word, signifying blue, the flowers being of that colour. The seeds are a safe and efficient pixrgative, and are used in a roasted state by the natives. For fig. of plant, see Bentley and Trimen, Med. Plants, tab. 185. [C. P. S.] Convolvulus Scammonia, L.

Solanum dulcamaea, L. (Bittersweet or Woody Nightshade.) Flower and fruit. Note.—Floral formula, (5). [(5). 5]. (2).

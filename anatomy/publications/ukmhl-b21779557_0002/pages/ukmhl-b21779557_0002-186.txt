170 DEVELOPMENT OF THE OVUM. 1301. The Placentae of three Children born at one birth. 35. 29 1302. A Quadruplet Placenta. 1303. A Triplet Placenta. 1304. A Double Placenta, showing the irregular dilatations of the arteries on the surface. 1305. A Double Placenta, showing the anastomoses of the arteries and of the veins, and of considerable arterial branches with veins. Presented, with tlie three preceding specimens, by Dr. Matthews Duncan. 1306. An Umbilical Cord injected, showing the left-handed spiral arrange- ment (sinistrorse) of the vessels. Presented by Dr. Matthews Duncan. 1307. Portion of an Umbilical Cord which was found tied into a knot. 35. 26 1308. Nidamental Capsule of a Shark, laid open, showing two embryos in its interior. 1309. An Embryo Skate (Raia Batis), with its large umbilical vesicle. 35. -^G 1310. The Ovary and adjacent parts of a common Fowl, showing the clustered ovisacs filled with ova in successive stages of development. One ovum, exposed at the lower part of the oviduct, has acquired all its coverings and a perfect shell. In the upper and front part of the preparation the commencement of the oviduct is shown, and in the lower part the cloaca, with the terminations of the oviduct and the rectum. 33. 35 1311. A similar specimen, 33. 36 1312. Portion of one of the horns of the pregnant Uterus of a Sow. Its blood vessels are minutely injected, and its cavity laid 02:)cn, showing the transverse undulating folds of its mucous membrane. 33. 29 1313. Portion of the pregnant Uterna of a Sheep, having numerous small and highly vascular elevations, or cotyledons, on its inner surface. 33. 30 1314. Part of Cotyledonary Placenta of a Sheep. Presented by Dr. Gibson. 1315. Part of Cotyledonary Placenta of a Cow, injected. Presented by Dr. Matthews Duncan. 1316. Portion of the pregnant Uterus of a Cow, with three cotyledons on its inner surface. The lowest of these is still covered with the foetal amnion and chorion fitted to its surface. From the middle one these membranes are reflected, and the villi of the chorion are shown, which filled the tubular depressions or inflections from the surface of the cotyledon. The upper one is similarly exposed by the reflection of the chorion and amnion. 33. 31 The four preceding specimens were presented by Dr. Conquest. 1317. An Embryo Calf, in its Amnion. 35. 35a 1318. A Foetal Calf, in its Amnion. 35. 71

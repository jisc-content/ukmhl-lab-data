11 SKULLS. GROUP L —♦— IGHTHYOPSIDA. —♦— CLASS I—PISCES. 415. The bones of the Skull of a Cod (Gradus Morrhua), disarticulated from each other, arranged in nearly their natural relative positions, and numbered after the system of Professor Owen. 28. 21 416. Dried Head of a Sturgeon (Accipenser Sturio). 28. 325 417. Skull of a Bony Gar-fish (Lepidosteus osseus). Three rows of sharp conical teeth, of different sizes, are set on each of the elongated jaws. The premaxillary and maxillary bones are divided into many pieces. The basi- occipital bone bears two plates, which enclose the epencephalon and support the ex-occipital bones ; the supI'a-occipital is double. Behind the occiput some of the bony " ganoid " scales remain. 28. 326 418. Head of a Wolf-fish (Anarrhichas Lupus). It is chiefly remarkable for the strength of the bones that support its oral teeth, namely, the intermaxillary, premandibular, and palatine bones and the vomer, to which also are adapted the bones giving attachment to muscles of mastication. The dentigerous bones have strongly developed alveolar processes. 28. 312 419. Skull of a Pike. 420. Skull of a Cod (Gadus Morrhua). 421. The separated Bones of the Head, and the anterior five vertebras of a Tobacco-pipe Fish (Fistularia tabaccaria). The anterior four vertebrae are elongated, and their bodies, neurapophyses, neural spines, and parapopliyses are thin and laminar, and anchylosed, so as to present a remarkable likeness to cranial vertebrae. The first vertebra bears anteriorly a single concave surface, with which a corresponding convexity on the basi-occipital bone is articulated. All the bones of the head are remarkably lengthened, especially the vomer, the pterygoid, and the components of the tympanic portion of the tympano- mandibular arch. 28. 320

The Pelves of three Guinea Pigs (Cavia aperea), and the skull of one just born, showing the adaptations of the pelvis to parturition. Above, the pelvis is shown in its ordinary state, with close approximation of the pubic bones. Below this, is a pelvis taken at the time of parturition, with the pubic bones separated nearly an inch and a half: the ligament of the symphysis being elon- gated to the same extent, and the expanded portions of the ilia being carried outwards and upwards with slight elongation of the sacro-iliac ligaments. The lowest of the three pelves was taken seventy-two hours after parturition : and there remains only a very slight separation of the ossa pubis. 33. 33 Presented by Thomas Wilson, Esq. 1328.

SERIES XXVI. THE EYE, AND OTHER ORGANS APPERTAINING TO THE SENSE OF SIGHT. 972. Section of an Eje, displaying (1) the sclerotic, its continuity with the sheath of the optic nerve, and its connection by bevelled edges vrith the transparent cornea; (2) the choroid membrane (which, as in most of the following specimens, is completely decolorised by the prolonged action of light and decomposed spirit) ; (3) the ciliary processes, surrounding and somewhat overlapping; (4) the iris; (5) the optic nerve, exposed within its sheath, and passing through a small opening in the sclerotic. 25. 1 973. A similar section, in which the Retina and Crystalline Lens are also included. 25. 2 974. Sections of an Optic Nerve, showing its mode of passage through the sclerotic, and its apparent constriction therein. 25. 5 975. Section of the posterior part of an Eye, displaying the internal surface of the Retina. 25. 6 976. An Eye, from which the posterior part of the sclerotic and choroid has been removed, so as to show the external surface of the retina and its connection with the optic nerve. 25. 7 977. The posterior part of an Eye. A slight starred depression extends between the point at which the optic nerve expands to form the retina, and the position of the macula lutea and foramen centrale of Soemmering. 25. 8 978. A similar specimen. 25. 9 979. The Blood Vessels of a Retina, minutely injected. The nervous and other tissues have been washed from them. 25. 10 980. Part of an Eye, giving a view from behind of the retina, ciliary processes and lens. 25. 11 981. Section of an Eye preserved in chromic acid. It shows the vitreous humour, traversed by very numerous delicate membranous septa, which con- verge from its circumference towards its axis. The portion extending through the axis of the eye is homogeneous and undivided, the septa stopping short of it. 25. 15 Presented by Dr. Hannover.

149 THE AUDITORY ORGAN, 1042, Sections of a Temporal Bone, showing the external auditory meatus and the mastoid cells. 1043, A Membrana Tympani, dried after the injection of its blood vessels. Many of the principal branches radiate towards the centre of the membrane to which the extremity of the handle of the malleus is attached. 26. 6 1044. Part of a Foetal Temporal Bone, together with the tympanic osseous ring. The ring, which serves for the insertion of the membrana tympani, is slightly fixed to the lower part of the squamous portion of the bone. 26. 7 1045. A similar specimen, with the membrana tympani fixed in its ring, and the malleus and incus in their normal relations. 26. 8 1046. Sections of the Temporal Bone of a Child. The " tympanic bone " has not yet united to the remaining portion. 1047. Temporal Bone of a Foetus, showing the ossicles. Th.e tympanic bone is still separate from the remainder. 1048. The Ossicula Auditus of a Foetus. The small portion of bone which has been sometimes called " os orbiculare," is attached to the long process of the incus. 26. 9 1049. A corresponding set of Ossicula from an Adult. They are scarcely larger than those of the foetus. 26. 10 1050. The Auditory Ossicles articulated. 1051. Part of an Ear, showing the ossicula and muscles within the cavity of the tympanum. The membrana tympani is removed, and bristles are passed under the stapedius, tensor tympani, and laxator tympani muscles. 26. ] 1 1052. Sections of a Temporal Bone, cut so as to show the ossicles and tympanum. A bristle is placed in the canal for the chorda tympani nerve. 1053. Sections of the Temporal Bone, showing the ossicles in situ and the carotid canal. 1054. Section of a Temporal Bone. Bristles are placed in the bony canals for the nerves of the tympanic plexus. 1055. Part of the petrous portion of a Temporal Bone, in which the vestibule, cochlea, and semicircular canals are exposed. The cavity of the vestibule is laid open. 26. 12 1056. A similar specimen, but with all the cavities of the vestibule, cochlea, and semicircular canals laid open. 26. 13 1057. A similar specimen. 26. 14 1058. A preparation of the Semicircular Canals. 1059. Section of the Temporal Bone, showing the cochlea and semicircular canals.

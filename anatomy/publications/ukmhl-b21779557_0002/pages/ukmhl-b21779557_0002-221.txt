CASTS AND MODELS. 205 94. Cast of the external Genital Organs of an imperfectly formed Male. The scrotum is divided into two portions, each of which contained a testicle. The urethra is incomplete, and opens in the perineum. The penis is small and recurved. A. 29 Presented by George Macilwain, Esq. 95. Model of a similar malformation. It presents a more feminine appearance of the male organs ; the halves of the scrotum being smaller, and more wide apart, look like labia; the wide perineal orifice of the urethra looks like a narrow opening into a vagina; and the very small penis might be mistaken for a large clitoris. The testicles, with spermatic cords, were distinctly felt in the two portions of the scrotum. The person from whom this model was taken wore the dress of a woman. A. 30 96. Cast of the Face of the person from whom the preceding model was taken. A. 31 97. Model of a Double or Bifid Uterus, described by Dr. Robert Lee in the seventeenth volume of the Medico-Chirurgical Transactions. A, 32

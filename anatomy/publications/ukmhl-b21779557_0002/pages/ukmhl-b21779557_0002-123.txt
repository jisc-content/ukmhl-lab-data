107 SERIES IX. THE ARTICULATIONS OF THE SKELETON. 626. Part of the base of a Skull with the Superior Cervical Vertebrae. The spinal canal is laid open from behind; the occipito-axoidean ligament is turned down, exposing the transverse ligament of the atlas and the three odontoid ligaments, two lateral and one median, proceeding from the odontoid process to the occipital bone. 29. 2 627. Section of Dorsal Vertebrae showing the articulations of the ribs with the spinal column. 628. Section of a Spine in the lumbar region, showing the ligamenta subflava. 629. Portion of a Spine from the lumbar region, showing the articulations of the vertebrae, and especially the oblique decussating tendinous fibres composing the outer layers of the intervertebral fibro-cartilages. The superficial layers of fibres are removed from between the two upper vertebrae. 630. Sections of two Pubic Bones and their Symphysis. Bristles are passed into a narrow cavity in the middle of the symphysis. 29. 3 From a woman who died shortly after parturition, 631. A similar specimen, with the cavity displayed. 29. 4 632. A similar specimen. Considerable mobility existed between the two bones; and the sacro-iliac symphyses were similarly, though less, loosened. 29. 5 633. A Temporo-maxillary Articulation, with its interarticular fibro-cartilage. Two completely distinct synovial cavities are separated by the cartilage. 29. 6 634. A preparation of the chief Ligaments of the Lower Jaw; namely, the internal lateral, pterygo-maxillary, stylo-maxillary, and stylo-hyoid. 29. 6a 635. An Elbow-joint. Bristles ai'e passed under the lateral ligaments. The orbicular ligament is divided in front and reflected in two portions. The tendon of the biceps is left attached to the tubercle of the radius ; just below it, the oblique ligament passes from the radius to the ulna. 29. 7 636. A longitudinal section of the Humerus and Ulna at the Elbow-joint.

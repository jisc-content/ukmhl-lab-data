An (Esophagus, in which there is a small pouch or diverticulum in the posterior wall, about the middle of the tube. The mucous membrane, which is quite healthy, is drawn in and puckered around the orifice ; there is no thicken- ing of the surrounding tissues. See description of case by Dr. Moore, in the Transactions of the Pathological Society, Tol. xxiii, p. 191. (C.) OF THE STOMACH. 3627. A Stomach, a narrow portion of which nearly midway between the cardiac and pyloric orifices is extremely contracted, so as to divide the organ into two compartments, which communicate only by a small orifice, admitting the passage of the index finger. The stomach appears otherwise healthy. From a woman in tlie dissecting rooms. See description of case by Mr. Morrant Baker, in vol. X7ii of the Transactions of the Pathological Society, p. 105. 3628. A Stomach, presenting an hour-glass contraction. The cardiac end is somewhat dilated, the pyloric extremity is natural. The middle portion of the stomach is much contracted, so as only to admit the passage of two fingers; its walls are thickened and its mucous membrane thrown into longitudinal folds. 3629. A similar specimen to that last described. The thickening of the walls appears to be due to an increase in the muscular coat. xi. 5

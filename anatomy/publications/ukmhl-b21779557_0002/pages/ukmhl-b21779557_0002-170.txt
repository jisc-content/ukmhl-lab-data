154 SERIES XXIX. OEGANS OF GENERATION IN THE MALE ! THE TESTICLE, AND ITS COVERINGS AND DUCT. 1108. A Testicle and Spermatic Cord, to show their external form and relations, together with the arrangement of the tunica vaginalis testis and the deep pouch into which it is reflected between the body of the testicle and the epididymis. 30. 1 1109. A Testicle, with the spermatic and surrounding tissues. A layer of fibro- cellular tissue is opened and turned aside, which invests or forms the "cellular sheath " of the whole length of the spermatic cord and the tunica vaginalis testis. The tunica vaginalis is laid open, and the constituents of the spermatic cord are set apart. 30. 2 1110. A Testicle, of which (after cutting open the tunica albuginea) the secreting tubules have been unfolded and separated. Many of the tubules are thus shown, singly and in bundles, extending through long distances, finely undulating, of uniform diameter, and without branching or anastomosis. At the lower part of the preparation many of the tubules appear to form loops. 30. 3 1111. A Testicle, dried after the injection of mercury through the vas deferens. The mercury passing through the vas deferens has filled nearly the whole of the fine convoluted tube forming the epididymis, and a portion of the tubules in the body of the testicle. 30. 4 1112. A similar specimen, showing more plainly the tubules in the rete testis. 30. 5 Prepared and presented by Holmes Coote, Esq. 1113. A similar specimen. 30. 6 1114. A similar specimen. The spermatic veins are injected with wax. 30. 7 1115. A similar specimen. 30. 8 1116. A Testicle, dried after injecting with mercury the vas deferens and tubules of the epididymis, and the spermatic artery, veins, and lymphatics. 30. 9 Prepared and presented by John Havers, Esq. 1117. A similar specimen. 30. K)

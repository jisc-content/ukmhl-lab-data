151 SERIES XXVIII. THE Sm, AND ITS APPENDAGES; THE OEGANS APPEETAININa TO THE SENSE OF TOUCH. 1074. Part of a Finger, in whicli tlie blood vessels are minutely injected. The curved double rows of sensitive papillas on the ball of the finger, and those arranged in linear ridges on the bed of the nail, are made distinct by the fulness of their vessels. 27. 1 1075. A Finger, dried after a mercurial injection of the blood vessels of the skin. The cuticle or epidermis has been removed in both these preparations. 27. 2 1076. The Fore-arm and Hand of a Foetus, injected so as to show the vascularity and general texture of the skin. 27. 3 1077. A similar preparation of the Leg and Foot of a Foetus. 27. 4 1078. Portion of Skin from the neighbourhood of a chronic ulcer in the Leg of a Negro. Both the cutis and the epidermis are thickened. The cuticle or epidermis is reflected, so as to show the great size of the sensitive papillae of the cutis, which are close-set, cylindriform, and conical vascular eminences, various in size and in some cases beset with slender processes. The forms of the papillae may be distinctly seen impressed in the inferior surface of the reflected epidermis, in which also it may be observed that the part nearest to the ulcer is devoid of colour. 27. 6 1079. Portion of Skin from an Axilla, showing-, on the inferior surface of the cutis, a part of the layer of large, lobulated sweat-glands. The orifices of the short ducts of these glands are open on the external surface of the cutis. 27. 7 1080. Portion of Skin from over a mammary gland. In raising the cuticle, the continuations of it, which are reflected inwards to form the linings of the hair- follicles, have been drawn out, and now project from its inferior surface. From some of the corresponding follicles in the cutis hairs project; bristles passed through others show their oblique course. 27. 8 1081. Portion of Skin which has been tanned and coloured. 27. 9 1082. Portion of Tattooed Skin. 27. 10 1083. A similar specimen; but the epidermis has been removed, so as to show that the coloured particles are imbedded in the substance of the cutis. 27. 11

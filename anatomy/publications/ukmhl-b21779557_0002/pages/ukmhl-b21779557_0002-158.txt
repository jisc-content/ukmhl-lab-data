Anteriorly the section passes through the septum and inferior turbinated bones, and in front of the middle turbinated bones ; posteriorly, it passes through the septum and the inferior and middle turbinated bones, just behind the superior turbinated bones. The thickness, sponginess, and great vascularity, of the Schneiderian membrane lining the nasal cavities are shown. The orifices of the antrum, and of the nasal duct, are indicated by probes passed through them. 24. 1 968. The right outer wall of the Cavities of a Nose, displaying the three turbinated bones, the three meatiis behind and below them, and the openings of the antrum and nasal duct. 24. 2 969. A similar specimen, with the inferior turbinated bone raised so as to show more distinctly the position of the nasal duct, and with a probe passed through the Eustachian tube. 24. 3 970. Portions of a Skull, in which are shown the following parts having relation to the Nose: 1. The external nares, with the bones and cartilages bounding them. 2. The crista galli and cribriform plate of the ethmoid bone, with the orifices for the passage of the olfactory nerves. 3. The posterior nares, the sphenoidal sinuses and their openings into the nasal cavities. 4. The antra or maxillary sinuses, with their openings. 5. The nasal ducts with the portions of their walls projecting slightly into the cavities of the antra. 24. 4 971. Section of the Head of a Turtle, showing the left olfactory nerve tra- versing a long canal above the nasal septum, and distributed on the mucous membrane over the cartilaginous portion of the septum. A bougie is passed through the right nasal passage. 24. 5

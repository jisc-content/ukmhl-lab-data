MOLLUSCA. 197 mantle has been divided to display the organs within it, but its free edge is left entire. On the dorsal aspect, from above downwards, are seen the liver, the heart, and the ovisac. The outer capsule of the liver has been cut open to show the (Esophagus and the aorta (blue). The bulging on tlie left hand at the lower edge of the liver is caused hj the stomach, which lies within the outer capsule. A silk thread is tied round the origin of the aorta. Tlie shaggy structures seen at the upper edge of the heart are the org-ans called by Cuvier kidneys. One oviduct with nidamental gland is visible. On the ventral aspect a gill is seen on each side with a branchial heart at its root. The branched structure visible at the lowest part of the mantle cavity is the ovary. The ovisac has been opened on this aspect. Presented by Dr. Norman Moore. 1643. Portion of an Arm of Octopus vulgaris, showing the suckers. 1644. Argonauta Argo (Paper Nautilus). The animal is suspended by its shell, with the keel downwards. The shell, thin and transparent, is broken near the apex. The shell in the Argonauts is not secreted by the mantle, nor is the animal connected with its shell. The shell is secreted by the two epipodia, one of which, much shrivelled, can be seen near the left border of the opening of the shell. The epipodia are kept during life closely applied to the sides of the shell, and are never kept, as so frequently depicted, like sails. At the anterior end of the shell immediately above the keel is seen the siphon. The body of the animal and the arms, greatly reti-acted, are shrunk by the spirit, and are contracted within the hollow of the shell. The arms are elongated and slender, and furnished with two rows of suckers. The male Argonaut is unprovided with a shell, and is only about one-fifth the size of the female.

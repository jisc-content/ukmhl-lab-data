129 SERIES XX. —«— THE ARTERIES MD VEINS. 822. Portion of an Aorta, with its coats dissected. Part of the outer coat, composed of fibro-cellular tissue, mingled with elastic tissue, is separated and turned downwards. Above this the middle coat is similarly shown: it is composed of elastic mingled with muscular tissue, the fibres of which are, for the most part, arranged transversely to the axis of the artery. The outer surface of the internal or longitudinally fibrous coat is exposed, and its smooth compact texture shown: on its inner surface it bears the epithelium. 18. 1 823. Portion of an Aorta inverted, and with its internal coat separated and turned downwards. 18. 2 824. Portion of an Aorta, of which the middle or muscular and elastic coat is split into several layers. 18. 3 825. Portion of the Splenic Artery of a Horse. When, shortly after the horse's death, the muscular coat of the artery was contracted, so that the canal of the artery was very nearly closed, the outer or cellular and the elastic coats were separated and turned aside. The canal of the artery was then cut open, and the muscular and internal coats laid fiat. The contraction of the muscular coat is shown both by its wrinkling, and by its being now so much narrower than the elastic and cellular coats, which expanded when they were separated from it. 18.4 826. The Great Arterial Trunks of a Turtle. They were cut across near the heart during life, and their canals were closed by the contraction of their strong muscular coats. 18. 5 827. The Spermatic Artery of a Horse, injected and dried so as to show its remakably tortuous and convoluted course. 18. 6 828. A similar preparation of the Spermatic Artery of a Bull. 18. 7 829. A similar preparation from a Bull, in which is shown also the convoluted arrangement of the spermatic artery on the tunica vaginalis testis. 18. 8

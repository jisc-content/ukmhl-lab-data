The chief essential characters of the human teeth are (1) their number, thirty-two, comprising in each half of each jaw two incisors, one canine, two bicuspids or premolars, and three molars; (2) the equality in the length of the crowns of them all, so that the points of all in each jaw are nearly in one plane ; (3) the equal closeness of all the crowns, and especially the absence of a space between the upper lateral incisor and the upper canine tooth; (4) the conical form and obtuseness of the canine teeth ; (5) the nearly vertical direction of the crowns, especially of those of the incisors. 7. 37 121.

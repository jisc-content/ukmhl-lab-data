84 AVES. pubis divergent; (4) tlie great lengtli and slenderness of tlie tibice, and more especially of the tarso-metatarsal bones. In the Charadriomorphse and Geranoniorphse the maxillo-palatines are free, but in the Amphimorphae and Pelargomorphee they are united. 28. 269 365. Skeleton of a Woodcock (Scolopax rusticola.) The characters of the bones of this skeleton indicate that most of them contain marrow, not air; this is especially seen in the yellowness and greasiness of the wing-bones ; the same character is usual in the smaller wading birds. 28. 272 366. Skeleton of a Snipe (Scolopax Grallinago). The occipital foramen lies far forwards, and, as in some others of the order, the upper portion of the occipital bone has two foramina or fontanelles. 28. 272a 367. Skeleton of a Ruff (Tringa pugnax). 28. 272b 368. Skeleton of a Heron (Ardea Oinerea). 28. 335 Presented by Mr. E. Oldfield. 369. Skeleton of a common Duck (Anas Boschus). The chief characters common to the Cecomorphae, Spheniscomorphse, Chenomorphffi, and Dysporo- morphae, all formerly included under the " Palmipedes," may be illustrated in this and in the following specimens: (1) The nearly vertical occipital foramen; (2) in many, strong ridges for the attachment of muscles on the occipital bone ; in some, as the Duck, a fontanelle in it; and, in the Cormorant, a long bone attached to it by ligament, and projecting straight backwards ; (3) in many species, as the Albatross and Tern, deep concave depressions or grooves on the frontal bone, for the lodgment of nasal glands ; (4) the lacrymal bones large, and reaching, or nearly reaching, to the jugal arch; (5) the vomer large ; (6) an elongated or double obturator foramen ; (7) the phalanges of the feet long and large. In the Cecomorphae and Spheniscomorph^ the maxillo- palatines are free, while in the Chenomorphae and Dysporomorphae they are united. 28. 277 370. Skeleton of an Albatross (Diomedea exulans). 28. 273 371. Skeleton of a common Tern (Sterna Hirundo). Most of its bones are greasy, containing marrow. 28. 274 372. Skeleton of a Cormorant or Shag (Phalacrocorax Cai'bo). 28. 275 373. Skeleton of a Razor-bill (Alca torda). The great length of the sternum and the backward elongation of its middle portion may be observed. 28. 276 374. Skeleton of a tame Swan (Cygnus Olor). The great number of vertebrae, twenty-three cervical and eleven dorsal, may be here noticed. 28. 278 Presented by W. B. Hm-le, Esq. 375. Skeleton of a Penguin.

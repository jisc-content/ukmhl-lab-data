ANNULOSA. 188 claws are not the homologues of the similarly developed pair of thoracic appen- dages in the Crustacea, but are homologous with the mandible of the other Arthropoda. The aperture of the mouth is small; the legs, eight in number, consist of seven joints, and terminate in an unguiculate claw. Behind the last pair of legs are two pectinate appendages. Situated on the 2nd, 3rd, 4th and 5th ventral segments are the slit-like openings of the air sacs. The terminal abdominal segment is vesicular in shape, and carries the sting. 1534. Scorpio Funestus. Dissected so as to show the nervous system. 1535. Scorpio Euroep^us. 1535a. Scarcoptes Scabisei (the Itch Insect). Class III.—MTRIAPODA. 1536. Scolopeudra gigantea, from the West Indies. (Koch, Die Myriapoden, Bd, ii, 9, Table Ixv, 132.) The flattened form of the body, together with the single pair of limbs on each segment, distinguish the Chilopoda from the Chilognatha. The long antennse consist in tliis specimen of more than fourteen joints, the minimum number in this order. The two anterior post-cephalic segments have their appendages modified to form foot-jaws, the second being pointed with large sickle-shaped claws, which are in connection with the poison gland. 1537. Scolopendra horrida (Koch), from Java. (See ibid., Bd. i, 77, Table xxxiv, 67.) A very large species, but imperfect, the antennse being broken off short. Class IV.—INSECTA. ORTHOPTEBA. 1538. Locusta Dux. In this and the following preparations the characters of the Orthoptera are well shown. 1539. Locusta Migratorius. 1540. Locusta Migratorius. Dissected. Portions of two separate individuals have been used. 1541. Locusta Migratorius. 1542. Gryllotalpa vulgaris (Mole Cricket). One of the most modified forms of the Orthoptera. The first pair of legs very short and of enormous stoutness, the Sfcond pair are short, but not so stout. 1543. Mantis Religiosa (Praying Mantis). 1544. Phyllium Siccifolium (Leaf Insect). HEMIPTEKA. 1545. Pediculus Pubis (Crab Louse). Attached to the hairs are some of their egg-cases. 1546. Pediculus Corporis.

MAMMALIA. 88 the four, five, or more phalanges in the longest fingers ; (19) the simple rib-like pubic bones alone representing the pelvis, and bearing no posterior extremities ; (20) the inferior laminje and spinous processes (hsemapophyses and hsemal spines) of the caudal vertebrae. 28. 176 (D.) CARNIVOEA. 388. Skeleton of a large Greyhound (Canis familiaris, var. Graius). As illustrations of the skeletons of Carnivora, the following characters may be observed in this specimen, and, vrith few excepHons, in those of the following : (1) The thin-walled ampulla, formed by the petrous portion of the temporal bone; (2) the small and united parietal bones; (3) the strong malar bone arched outwards to form part of the great zygoma; (4) the large palate bones; (5) the lower jaw, provided with a broad coronoid process, a sharp process directed backwards from its angle, and its condyle low, lengthened in the transverse direction, and so locked in the glenoid cavity as to admit of little or no lateral motion; (G) the long and narrow sternum; (7) the clavicle rudimental (absent in some, as tlie Coati; more developed in others, as the Cat;) (8) the free rotation of the radius on the ulna; (9) the length and narrowness of the ilia, and the obliquity of the pelvis; (10) the distinctness of the tibia and fibula, though they are very closely approximated at their distal ends. 28. 135 Presented by Stej)hen Stafford, Esq. 389.

This specimen illustrates some of the chief characters of the skeletons of the Hyracoidea, which are as follows: (1) The large number of the dorso-lumbar vertebrae, namely, twenty-nine to thirty-one; (2) the premaxilte are large, and unite extensively with the nasal bones; (3) the post-orbital processes, which are chiefly furnished by the parietal and jugal, nearly meet, and part of the articular facet for the mandible is formed by the latter bone; (4) the scapula has no acromion process, there are no clavicles, but the coracoid process is well developed; (5) in the carpus, a line prolonging the axis of the third metacarpal bisects the OS magnum and the lunare; (6) in the hind limb, the third trochanter is not nearly so conspicuous as in some rodents, the tibia and fibula are complete, and the extremity of the inner malleolus articulates with a shelf- like process of the astragalus. The first and fifth digits arc not represented, and the terminal phalanx of the second is cleft. Preseuted by Dr. Norman Mooi-c.

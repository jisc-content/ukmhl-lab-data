27 SERIES IV. ABNORMAL CONDITIONS OF THE VASCULAR SYSTEM. (I.) OF THE BLOOD VESSELS. CLASS I.—VAEIATION. 3525. The Arcii of an Aorta, giving off only two principal branches. From one of these, as an artei'ia innominata, proceed the right subclavian and two carotid arteries : the other is the left subclavian. A. 41 3526. A similar specimen. In both these instances the arteria innominata passes obliquely across the front of the trachea. A. 42 3527. A similar specimen. The left carotid arises very near the origin of the innominate artery. A. 44 3528. The Arch of an Aorta, from which arise:—(1) an arteria innominata, that gives off, as in the preceding specimens, the right subclavian and both, carotid arteries ; (2) the left vertebral artery ; (3) the left subclavian. A. 45 3529. A similar specimen. The left vertebral artery entering the canal at the fourth cervical vertebra. A. 47 3530. The Arch of an Aorta, with an abnormal arrangement of its branches, seen from behind. It gives off (1) the right carotid; (2) the left carotid; (3) the left subclavian; (4) the right subclavian. This latter artery arises from the posterior part of the aorta, ascends, and then passes transversely to the right, behind the oesophagus and trachea, to the right side of the neck. A. 48 3531. The Arch of an Aorta, showing an abnormal arrangement of its principal branches. The right subclavian artery, as in the last specimen, is the fourth branch, and passes behind the trachea and oesophagus. A. 48a 3532. A similar specimen. The right vertebral artery arises from the right carotid, and enters the foramen in the transverse process of the fourth cervical vertebra. A. 49 3533. A smilar specimen seen from the front. The subclavian artery does not rise so high in the neck as in the last specimen. The right inferior laryngeal nerve branches from the pneumogastric opposite the lower border of the cricoid cartilage, and then passes to its distribution in a direct instead of a recurrent course. a. 51

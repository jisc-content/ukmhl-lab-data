ANNULOS A —CRUSTACEA. 187 1515. Lepas Anatifera (Common Barnacle). 1516. Specimen showing the anatomy of Lepas Anatifera. 1517. Two similar specimens preserved in spirit. 1518. A group of smaller specimens in their natural position. 1519. A larger specimen of a single barnacle. (E.) PODOPHTHAIiMIA. 1520. Pagurus Bernhardus (Hermit Crab). The abdomen in the hermit crab is covered by membranous walls, and its upper surface is somewhat strengthened by calcareous matter. The anterior feet and legs are of very unequal size: the large claws not only acting as weapons of offence, but helping to close the orifice of the shell it inhabits, as is seen in the following specimen. 1521. Pagurus Bernhardus (Hermit Crab). In its shell. 1522. Astacus fluviatilis (Common Fresh-water Cray-fish). In this and in the following specimens the external anatomy of the Podophthalmic crustaceans can be studied. 1523. Astacus fluviatilis (Common Fresh-water Crayfish); female; having the ova attached to the abdominal appendages. 1524. Astacus fluviatilis. Dissected so as to show the nervous system. 1525. Balanops Norwegicus, from Ireland. The two pairs of antennse and the other appendages of the segments are to be noticed. The hinge in the last exopodite is flexed on one side. Presented by Dr. Norman Moore. 1526. Monster Crab. 1527. Monster Lobster. 1528. Crab (Cancer). 1529. Maia Squinado (Spinous Spider Crab). Female. 1530. Maia Squinado (Spinous Spider Crab). Male. 1531. Crangon vulgaris (Common Shrimp). A portion of the carapace has been cut away, to show the gills injected with red. To the abdominal legs of each numerous ova are afiixed. Between the two shrimps a small crab, with the carapace removed and gills injected, is suspended. Class II.—ARACHNIDA. 1532. Tarantula. 1533. Scorpio Funestus. The external anatomy is well shown in this and the following specimens. The head and thorax are fused together, forming a cephalo-thorax, whilst the tail is distinctly jointed. There is only a single pair of antennae, which are modified to assist in the prehension of food. The lai-o-e

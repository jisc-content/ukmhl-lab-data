124 SERIES XVIII. tSe glands without ducts, or vascular glands; the spleen, thyrod and thymus glands, and supra-renal capsules. â™¦ 771. The Blood Vessels of a Spleen filled with wax, and exposed by macerating and washing away the rest of its substance. 16. 1 772. Part of a Spleen, macerated after the removal of its capsule. By thus washing away the pulpy substance formed of nuclei and cells, together with the blood and lympli contained in the spleen, a cellular or spongy texture is exposed, which is formed by the close interlacing of fibrous filaments con- nected with the capsule of the spleen and the coats of its larger blood vessels. The spaces or interstices between the fibres of this spongy substance are called the cells of the spleen. 16. 4 773. A similar specimen. 16. 5 774. A similar preparation of the spleen of a Horse with the arteries injected. 16. 3 775. A similar preparation of part of the Spleen of a Calf, dried. 16. 6 776. Part of the Spleen of a Horse, showing the mode of branching of the splenic artery and vein. The branches of both v^essels form nearly right angles with the trunks, and are small in comparison with them. Bristles are placed in the branches of the artery ; those of the vein are laid open; both may be traced for some distance into the substance of the spleen, in which, at length, their minute branches cannot be distinguished from, the fibrous cords which intersect it. 16. 2 777. The Spleen of a Dog. 16. 17 778. A Thyroid Gland, displaying the usual form of its lateral lobes, and of the middle lobe or isthmus connecting them. A section of the left lobe shows part of its structure. 16. 7 779. A Thyroid Gland, with the larynx and other adjacent parts. Bristles are passed under two slips of muscle, of which one, named Levator glandule thyroidefp, extends from the right side of the isthmus of the gland to the body of the hyoid bone, the other from the lower margin of the left ala of the thyroid cartilage to the same bone. 16. 8

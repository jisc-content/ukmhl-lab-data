The principal cerebral and cerebellar arteries also are shown, as well as the trunks of the vertebral and internal carotid arteries passiug tortuously to the base of the skull. 18. 30 850. The Arteries composing the circle of Willis, and the chief branches pro- ceeding from them. 18. 31 851. Parts of a Chest and Upper Extremities, showing especially the subclavian and axillary arteries and their branches. 18. 34 852. An Upper Extremity, with its principal arteries arranged in the most usual manner. 18. 36 853. A similar preparation of both the arteries and the veins of an npper extremity. 18. 38 854. A similar specimen. 18. 39 855. A similar specimen. 18. 40 856. A Fore-Arm and Hand, with their principal arteries. 18. 41 857. Several specimens showing the free anastomosis of small arteries around the elbow joint. 858. Hands, with their arteries injected, showing the course of the palmar arches and their branches. 18. 44 859. A similar specimen. 18. 45 860. A Hand, with its arteries and veins injected with wax. The wax injected by the arteries passed into the veins, apparently without any extravasation. 18. 47 861.

Portions of a Pelvis and Femur, with the principal branches of the left iliac and femoral arteries and veins. 18. 55 863. The front of a Pelvis, with portions of the urinary bladder and penis. The internal pudic arteries and veins and their principal branches are shown. 18. 58 864. A left Lower Extremity, with its principal arteries. 18. 62 865. A similar preparation, from a Child. 18. 63 866. Part of a Lower Extremity, with the popliteal, tibial, and peroneal arteries and their branches. 18. 65 867.

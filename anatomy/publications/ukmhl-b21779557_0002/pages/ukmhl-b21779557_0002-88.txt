Skull of an European, unusually flattened in the interorbital and parietal regions. 28. 67 212. Skull of an European, with the parietal and occipital regions very low in comparison with the frontal. 28. 68 213. An European Skull, of which the right side is higher than the left, giving it an api^earance of obliquity, or defective symmetry. 28. 69 214. A Skull of similar shape, but with the left side higher than the right. Six ossa triquetra, or "Wormian" bones, are in the line of the lambdoidal suture. 28. 70 215. A Skull with a similarly oblique form, in which all the parts of the right side are smaller than the corresponding parts of the left. 28. 71 216. An obliquely formed Skull, having its right half somewhat more anterior than the left, and in its occipital region rather smaller. 28. 72 217.

A similar specimen, but the obliteration is not so well marked. 221. A Calvarium, with the sagittal suture nearly entirely obliterated. 222. A similar specimen. The bone varies much in thickness, being quite translucent in places. 223. A Skull, with many Wormian bones occupying the situation of the posterior fontanelle and part of the lambdoid suture. The frontal suture is persistent. '224. A similar specimen. 225. A Calvarium, the position of whose anterior fontanelle is occupied by a large Wormian bone, aljout two inches in diameter and somewhat square in shape.

A Skull, supposed to be that of a Roman, taken from a sarcophagus which was discovered in 1878 during the digging of the foundations for the Medical School of St. Bartholomew's Hospital. The whole of the facial bones are twisted to one side, so that a line drawn down the middle of the cranium falls considerably to the right of the mesial line of the jaw. Many of the bones of the skeleton showed signs of rheumatoid arthritis. 170. Skull, supposed to be that of a Roman female, discovered together with the preceding specimen. 171. Skull of a Chinese. The chief features of the Mongolian or pyramidal form which it illustrates are: â€” (1) the width of the space between the zygomata, due to the width of the superior maxillary bones and of the anterior parts of the malar bones ; (2) the largeness of the zygomata ; (.3) the flatness of the face, due to the want of prominence of the nasal bones and of the nasal processes of the superior maxillary bones; (4) the width and the slight prominence of the alveolar margins of the maxillary bones; (5) the compara- tively narrow forehead, and its narrowing as it ascends towards the vertex; (6) the shortness of the antero-posterior diameter in proportion to the lateral diameter of the skull. 28. 42

3a ABNORMAL CONDITIONS OP THE VASCULAR SYSTEM. CLASS v.—ARREST OF DEVELOPMENT. (A.) ARRESTED CLOSURE OF FORAMEN OVALE. 3593. A Heart in which there is a large oval opening in the septum between the auricles. The opening is an inch in diameter, aud not valvular. The heart is enlarged, and all its parts appear increased in equal proportion. The patient, a -woman 30 years old, had good health till witliin a few months before death, when she began to have signs of disease of the heart, which gradually increased.—Case Book, vol. i, p. 110, No. 137. 3594. A similar Specimen. From a man aged 43, who died of phthisis. 3595. The Heart of an Adult, in which the septum of the auricles is almost wholly wanting. Its place is represented by only a crescentic fold projecting from the upper part of the single auricular cavity. In this fold, at the upper and back part, the fossa ovalis is distinct. The adjacent portions of the tricuspid and mitral valves appear continuous with each other over the septum of the ventricles. The rest of the heart appears well formed. A. 25 The patient, a man about 40 years old, lived and died withoTit signs of disease of the heart. He died with diseased kidneys. The case is related by Dr. Kirkes, in the London Medical Gazette, 1851. _ 3596. A Heart having a widely patent foramen ovale. The ductus arteriosus, although pervious, is contracted, and its walls are thickened. From the CoUeotion of J. R. Farre, Esq., M.D. (B.) ARRESTEE CLOSURE OF THE FORAMEN OVALE AND OF THE DUCTUS ARTERIOSUS. 3597. A Heart in which the Ductus Arteriosus and Foramen Ovale are patent. The former appears to be somewhat dilated. The communication between the auricles is unusually free. From the Collection of J. R. Farre, Esq., M.D., in whose work on the Heart it is described (p. 12). (C.) HYPERTROPHY OF THE WALLS OF THE RIGHT VENTRICLE, WITH PARTIAL OBLITERATION OF ITS CAVITY, AND NARROWING OR CLOSURE OF THE PULMONARY ARTERY. 3538. The Heart of a Child about 10 years old. The right auricle appears normal, except in that the foramen ovale is wide open. The tricuspid valve is a narrow ring of membrane with scarcely a trace of tendinous cords. The right ventricle is scarcely more than half an inch in diameter ; its walls are thick, but much fibrous tissue appears mixed with the muscular. The pulmonary artery is closed in the situation of its valves; beyond its closure it gains a normal diameter. The ductus arteriosus was pervious. The left auricle, left ventricle, aorta, aud their valves, are normal, except in that the aorta is large from its origin to its communication with the ductus arteriosus. A. 26 3599. The Heart of a Child 10 years old, similarly, but in a less degree, malformed. The foramen ovale is closed; the right ventricle is lai-gcr than in the preceding; its wall is very thick and strong; the pulmonary artery is not closed, D

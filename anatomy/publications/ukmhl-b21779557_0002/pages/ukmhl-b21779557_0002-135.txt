119 THE INTESTINAL CANAL. 727. Portion of the Small Intestine of a Turtle (Chelone Midas). Its mucous membrane is arranged in undulating longitudinal folds, like valvulse conniventes, extended in the direction of the axis of the intestine. 12. 39 728. Similar specimens, with the blood vessels injected. 12. 40 and 41 729. Portion of the Small Intestine of a Tui'tle, with the strong circular muscular coat exposed. 12. 42 730. Portion of the Large Intestine of a Turtle. Its mucous membrane is arranged in longitudinal folds or ridges, and appears highly vascular. 12. 43 731. Portion of the Duodenum of a Turtle, displaying its very thick circular muscular coat, and the reticular arrangement of the folds of its mucous membrane. Bristles are placed in the biliary and pancreatic ducts. 12. 44 732. Portion of the Small Intestine of an Ostrich, displaying its large, flat, and very vascular villi. 12. 35 733. Termination of the Small and the commencement of the Large Intestine of a Heron (Ardea Cinerea), showing the single small conical csecum. 12. 51 734. Portion of the Small Intestine and the Cseca of a Fowl. The mucous membrane of the small intestine is covered with short, thick-set villi; its canal becomes rather smaller where it opens into the rectum between the CEeca; and it has here a valvular orifice. Each of the ceeca is about eight inches long. Their mucous membrane, less vascular than that of the small intestine, is covered with villous processes in the part near their junction with the rectum, but in the rest its extent is simple and smooth, or but slightly wrinkled. 12. 36 735. Portion of Small Intestine from a Dog. The villi and glands are greatly developed. The former give the internal surface of the intestine a woolly appearance; of the latter, some are solitaiy, the rest in clusters or patches. The patches, corresponding with the Peyer's glands of the human intestines, present numerous deep small pits between intersecting ridges of mucous membrane, and at the bottom of each pit a small opaque white spheroidal body, like the isolated acinus of a gland. 12. 24 736. A similar specimen, displaying especially the long villi of the dog's intestine. 12. 25 737. A similar specimen, in which many of the villi are white with the chyle contained in them. 12. 26 738. Termination of the Small and the commencement of the Large Intestine of a Dog (Canis familiai'is), showing an abnormal condition of the Csecum. The lower end of the ileum is entirely occupied by Peyer's glands. 12. 53 739. Csecum of a Squirrel (Sciurus vulgaris). 12. 52 740. The end of the Ileum with the Csecum and part of the Colon of a Rat. The csecum is large in comparison with both the ileum and the colon, but is of simple form and not sacculated. 12. 32 741. The end of the Ileum and the Cfecum of a Monkey. They have nearly the same form as in man, but there is no appendix of the csecum. 21. 27

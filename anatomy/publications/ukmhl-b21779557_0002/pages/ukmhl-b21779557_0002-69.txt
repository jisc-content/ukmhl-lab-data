SERIES 11. THE BLOOD AND OTHER COMPONENT FLUIDS OF THE BODY. 18. A Clot of Blood, in the formation of which the red corpuscles sank below the surface before the fibrin coagalated. A layer of fibrin has thus coagulated on the surface of the clot, without any admixture of red particles, forming a white or " buS'y " coat on the top of the dark clot. The contraction of this portion of the coagulated fibrin not being hindered, as that in the dark part of the clot was, by red corpuscles imbedded in it, its margins are drawn towards its centre, puckered, and incarved, giving a " cupped " appearance to the clot. 2. 1 19. Similar Clots of "buffed and cupped" Blood: a section of one of them displays the thickness and almost pure whiteness of the buffy coat. 2. 2 20. A layer of Fibrin, or Buffy Coat, removed from the surface of a clot of blood, such as is shown in the preceding specimens. 2. 3 21. A mass of Fibrin, split into thin membranous layers and filaments. 2. 4 22. A colourless branched Clot of Blood, withdrawn from the pulmonary artery and its ramifications. In the slow coagulation of the blood after death the red corpuscles had time to subside to the posterior branches of the pulmonary artery, leaving the other constituents of the blood to form this pale coagulnm in the upper and anterior branches. 2. 5 23. Serum, which in the recent state had a milky appearance, from the minutely divided fatty matter mingled with it. 2. 6 24. Ashes of burnt blood. They are spotted with peroxide of iron. 2. 7 25. Oil from Human Fat; a mixture of Olein and Margarin. 2. 8 26. A colourless branched Blood Clot, removed from the branches of the pulmonary artery in a case of broncho-pneumonia. 2. 10

MAMMALIA. 90 olecranon; (11) the thumb small, free, supporting a claw; (12) the other very slender and long metacarpal bones and digits serving for the support of the membrane of the wing; (13) the pelvis elongated, and with its ossa pubis wide apart, but connected by ligament; (14) the long sharp spine on the os pubis, the rudiment of a marsupial bone; (15) the head of the femur placed between two equal and similar trochanters; (16) the fibula rudimental; (17) the os calcis, bearing a long spur-like bone for the support of that posterior part of the alary membrane which extends beyond the tail; (18) the general delicacy and lightness of the whole skeleton. 28. 116 410. A similar specimen. 28. 349 (I.) PRIMATES. 411. Skeleton of a young Oran-utan (Pithecus Satyrus). Principal characters of the skeletons of Quadrumana illustrated by this and the following specimens : (I) The generally anthropoid character ; (2) the nearly horizontal direction of the occipital foramen; (3) the single frontal bone ; (4) the smallness, and, in most of the following crania, the singleness, of the nasal bone ; (5) the extended inner plate of the malar bone, forming part of the orbit and temporal fossa ; (6) the small palate bones ; (7) the single lower jaw, with its symphysis sloping downwards and backwards ; (8) the general form of the skull, approach- ing the human form; (9) the sacral vertebrae, composing a sacrum which, though narrow in comparison with that of man, is broader and hollower than those of the foregoing mammalia ; (10) the scapula long, but broad at its neck; (II) the clavicle long, thick, and strong; (12) the humerus very long; (13) the radius and ulna long and slender, and very freely rotating ; (14) the fingers long and slender, but the thumb short and small; (15) the pelvis broad, and the ilia carried far back; (16) the ischium with a spine, and with broad and flat tuberosities ; (17) the femur short in comparison with the humerus; (18) the tibia and fibula distinct; (19) the toes long and slender, except the inner toe, which is like the thumb, and thus, making the foot look like the hand, gives the especially quadrumanous character. 28. 102 Presented by Dr. Roupell. 412.

The chief parts shown, m situ, are, from below upwards, the olfactory lobes, the elongated oval cerebral hemispheres, the pineal gland, the optic lobes, the cerebellum (a broad band dotted with black pigment), the large fourth ventricle, the short and wide spinal cord, and the cauda equina formed by the roots of the lumbar and sacral nerves. 22. 24 939. The Brain and the upper part of the Spinal Cord of a Turtle (Chelone Midas). From below, proceeding upwards, are shown, the olfactory lobes, the cerebral hemispheres, the pineal and pituitary bodies, the optic lobes, the nearly membranous cerebellum, the wide and shallow fourth ventricle, and the flattened spinal cord. 22. 23 Presented by Holmes Coote, Esq. 940. Brain of a Boa Constrictor (Python Seba?). 22. 34 941. Section of the Brain of a Turkey (Meleagris Gallo-pavo), showing the cavity of the fourth ventricle and its prolongation between the lobes of the cerebellum, the pineal gland, and the absence of a corpus callosum. 22. 21 Presented by Holmes Coote, Esq. 942. The Brain and Spinal Cord of a common Fowl (Gallus domesticus). The portions of the spinal cord with which the origins of the nerves supplying the extremities are connected, are much larger than the portions either above or below them; and the portion corresponding with the nerves of the lower ex- tremities is larger than that connected with those of the upper extremities. 22. 22 943. The Brain of a Kangaroo (Macropus Panyi). The upper part of the left cerebral hemisphere is removed, showing the very small corpus callosum, and tlie corpora qnadrigemina, of which the anterior pair are much larger than the posterior. 22. 20 Presented by Holmes Coote, Esq. 944. Brain of an Armadillo (Dasypus Conurus). 22. 30 945. Braiu of a Sheep (Ovis Aries). 22. 36 946. A vertical section through the middle line of the Brain of a Sheep, showing especially the cavity of the fourth ventricle, and the valve of Vieussens, of which the grey substance is continued through the corpora qnadrigemina into the optic thalamus. 22. 17 Presented by Holmes Coote, Esq. 947. The Brain of a Cat (Felis domesticus). 22. 16 Presented by Holmes Coote, Esq. 948. Brain of a Young Kitten. 22. 38 949. The Brain of a Leopard (Felis Leopai'dus). The upper part of the left cerebral hemisphere, and the left half of the cerebellum, are removed, exposing the corpus striatum, optic thalamus, and the large hippocampus, the corpora quadrigemina, and the floor of the fourth ventricle. 22. 15 Prepared and presented by Holmes Coote, Esq. 950.

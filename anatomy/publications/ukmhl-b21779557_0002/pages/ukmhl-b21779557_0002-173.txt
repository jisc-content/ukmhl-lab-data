157 ACCESSORY xMALE ORGANS. 1136. An Uretlira, with the blood vessels of its corpus spongiosam injected, and its canal laid open from below. 31. 12 1137. Transverse section of a Penis, after minate injection of its blood vessels. The preparation shows especially the forms and relative sizes of the corpora cavernosa penis separated by the fibrous septum, and of the corpus spongiosum surrounding the urethra; the lai'ge vessels beneath the integniments on the dorsum of the penis, and the general characters of the erectile tissue and its fibrous covering, are also shown. 31. 13 1138. Vertical section through a Glans Penis, showing the continuity of its spongy or erectile tissue with that of the anterior part of the corpus spongiosum urethrae, the strong fibrous covering that separates these from the corpus caver- nosum, and the general form of the anterior part of the urethra. 31. 14 1139. A Penis, dried after injecting the veins of the glans and corpus spongiosum urethra with yellow wax, and those of the corpora cavernosa with red wax. In both parts the structure of the erectile tissue appears almost entirely composed of tortuous, branching", and freely communicating veins. The veins of the glans and of the anterior part of the corpus spongiosum are collected in a close plexus of large branches, which lie on the dorsum of the penis behind the glans, and which converge and open into the great dorsal vein. A few smaller veins also pass from the median portion of the corpus cavernosum into this great dorsal vein, and into a smaller which lies by its side and parallel with it. 31. 15 Prepared and presented by Thomas Wormald, Esq. 1140. A similar preparation. 31. 16 1141. A corroded injection of the Veins of the Glans Penis, and of the adjacent portion of the corpus spongiosum urethrae. 31. 17 Prepared and presented by Thomas Wormald, Esq. 1142. Sections of Corpora Cavernosa Penis, inflated and dried. 31. 18 1143. A Penis, from which, on one side, the erectile tissue of the corpus caver- nosum is removed, and the internal surface of its fibrous sheath or investment is displayed. 31. 19 1144. A Penis, in which, by similar removal of the erectile tissue on both sides, the fibrous septum (septum pectiniforme) of the corpora cavernosa is shown. It is chiefly constructed of strong vertical bands of fibrous tissue, the apei-tures between which permit the passage of only small blood vessels from one corpus cavernosum to the other. 31. 20 1144a. A preparation of a Penis, and of the plexus of great veins at the sides of the prostate gland, injected with wax. The structure of the corpora cavernosa and the arrangement of their arteries are also shown. 31. 36 1145. A similar preparation of the Penis, vesiculee seminales, vasa deferentia, and urinary bladder. 31. 27 1146. The anterior part of a Penis, with the bulbous and membranous portions of the urethra shown in their relations to the triangular or subpubic ligament. 31. 30

PARASITES. 326 [SECT. VII. with a thin albuminous coating. The thread-worm inhabits the upper part of the colon and lower part of the ileum. According to Zenker and Heller the mature egg-bearing females affect the colon and caecum, the younger ones and the males affect the ileum. They are of very common occurrence and are often found in vast numbers. They are apt to migrate from the rectum into neighbouring parts, and may so enter the vagina. The irritation they cause induces violent scratching, and this again brings about inflammation of the skin and other disagreeable consequences. When the eggs have been ejected from the body with the faeces, they must be taken up into the stomach of an animal before they can develope. It is not improbable that the individual host may re-infect himself; for eggs may stick under his finger-nails after he has been scratching himself, and may thus be inadvertently carried to the mouth. The eggs are not destroyed by being dried, and in this condition they may be carried from j)lace to place. 230. Trichocephalus dispar, or whip-worm (Fig. 92), is a common but innocuous parasite inhabiting the caecum and neighbouring parts of the intestine. Davaine says that half the inhabitants of Paris are infested with it. Both male and female are 4â€”5 cm. long. The anterior part of the body is very fine and thread-like.

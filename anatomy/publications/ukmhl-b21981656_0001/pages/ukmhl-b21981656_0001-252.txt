232 TUMOURS. [SECT. VI. metastases. They are as malignant as the malignant carcinomata. In order to indicate this fact in their distinctive name, they have been called destructive adenomata, or adenocarcinomata. Their malignancy is manifested even in their local behaviour.

The figure (Fig. 61) shows that the neoplastic tubules are first developed in the mucosa, the normal constituents of the mucous membrane simultaneously disappearing. Starting thence the neoplasm invades the submucosa (b). It intrudes itself along the intermuscular septa between the muscle-bundles of the muscularis (c): and finally extends along the serous layer (d). Here and there through the fibrous tissue may be seen heaps of small cells: this indicates that proliferation is going on in this tissue likewise. This invasion of the neighbouring tissues is the first step towards the formation of metastases. Clearly the lymph-spaces of

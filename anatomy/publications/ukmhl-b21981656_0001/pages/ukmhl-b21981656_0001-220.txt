[SECT. VI. 200 TUMOURS. more rarely in the spinal cord. They appear as tumours which are imperfectly marked off from the healthy brain- or cord- substance ; the margin of the tumour gradually merges into the healthy tissue. They have thus the look rather of localised swellings than of tumours: but the difference in tint, and the blurring of the normal distinctions between the various elements of the brain-substance, serve to make good the diagnosis. Their appearance varies. Some are light grey and translucent like the cortical substance, and fairly firm in consistence. Others are whiter, coarser, and firmer. Others again are greyish red or even dark red, in which case they are traversed by large and numerous blood-vessels. Vascular gliomata often enclose haemor- rhagic patches. They are subject to fatty degeneration, caseation, softening, and disintegration. A section of a mature glioma exhibits under the microscope a kind of felted texture, made up -of excessively fine lustrous fila- ments (Fig. 40 B) interspersed with a multitude of slightly oval nuclei. The nuclei are surrounded by a scanty hardly-visible pro- toplasm. If however the preparation be examined when quite fresh, or after treatment with Miiller's fluid, it is readily seen that the nuclei belong to cells which are furnished with numerous delicate ramifying processes going off in various directions (Fig. 40 A).

These cells are very similar to neuroglia-cells, though they are often decidedly larger and coarser. Some of them may contain two, three, or more nuclei. Researches on the development of glioma have shown that the neuroglia-cells are the parent cells of the tumour. The ganglion-

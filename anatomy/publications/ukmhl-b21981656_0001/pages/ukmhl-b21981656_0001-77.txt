CHAPTER VII. LYMPHOKRHAGIA. 31. Lymphorrhagia occurs when a lymphatic vessel is rup- tured and the contained lymph is effused into the tissues around. The pressure in the lymphatics is very low, scarcely higher, that is to say, than that in the contiguous tissues. An escape of lymph from the vessel can therefore occur only when a cavity already exists at the place of rupture, or when one is made by the same injury which rent the vessel. Thus in wounds, for example, we see lymph and blood escaping together; but the flow of the lymph can be arrested by interposing a very slight resistance. If the opening in the surface be not closed up after the rupture of a lymphatic, so that lymph continues constantly to escape, as sometimes happens in the case of ulcers, we have lymph-fistulae formed. Such fistulae may lead to the loss of very considerable quantities of lymph. The most important lesion of this kind, as well as the most likely to be dangerous, is rupture of the thoracic duct. This has occasion- ally been observed as a consequence of a wound; but more com- monly of engorgement from closure of the lumen of the duct by in- flammation or tumour. The lymph escaping into the thoracic or abdominal cavity gives rise to chylous hydrothorax or chylous ascites.

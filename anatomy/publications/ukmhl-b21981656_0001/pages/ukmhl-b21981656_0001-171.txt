The nuclear juice and nuclear substance become distinct, so that it becomes possible to discern clearly a nuclear membrane, nucleoli, and nuclear granules Fig. 25.

This differentiation of the elements of the nucleus gives the cell an altogether different aspect and habit. It resembles an epithelial cell, or as it is phrasedâ€”it becomes epithelioid. The transformation of leucocytes into epithelioid cells is accom- panied by cohesion of the protoplasm of separate cells. A growing cell may appropriate the substance of others which are decaying; or two equal cells may coalesce to form a single one. The epithelioid cells are the formative cells of the granulation- tissue : they alone have the power of producing new connective tissue. They are best described as fibroblasts. They are usually uninuclear, and their numbers increase partly by successive trans- formations of round-cells, partly by subdivision. Very probably the division of their nuclei is of the karyokinetic type. If the pro- toplasm does not subdivide for some time after the nucleus has divided, binuclear (c) cells are formed; and even in some instances large multinuclear cells, the so-called giant-cells (cj. In healthy granulations giant-cells are produced but sparingly. Ziegler has endeavoured to prove experimentally that the migrated white blood-cells are capable of further development, and are the primary source of cicatricial tissue {Exper. Untersuch. iib. d.

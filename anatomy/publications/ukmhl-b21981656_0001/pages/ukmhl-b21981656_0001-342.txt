[SECT. VII. 322 PARASITES. animal has generally been dead for some time: it then appears as a nodule as big as a pea made up of a mortar-like chalky mass with a fibrous capsule. The mass often contains hooklets, but seldom the whole animal. Fiu. 88. Head-end of pentastoma den hculatum. (From PERLS: x 40) According to Leuckart, Pentastoma denticidatum is the larva of Pentastoma taenioides, a lanceolate arachnoid inhabiting the frontal sinuses of various animals, chiefly the dog. The female is 60—85 mm. long, the male 16—18 mm.; the breadth of each is about 3 mm. The mature animal resembles the larva, but it has no hooklets. Pentastoma constrictum has also been met with as a larva in the liver and in the lungs (von Siebold ; Aitken, Science and Pract. of Medicine 1882). 226. Insecta. The parasites belonging to this class are nearly all epizoa. Some settle on the skin for a brief time only, in order to extract nutriment from it: others are stationary and make use of the epidermal structures for the deposit of their eggs. Of the many insects which afflict man we need name only the following. (1) Pediculus capitis, or head-louse. This inhabits the hairy scalp, and extracts from it by means of its proboscis the blood on which it feeds. It fastens its eggs to the hairs by means of a chitinous covering. The 'nits' are easily seen as small greyish oval bodies, tightly affixed to the hair. The young louse emerges in about eight days, or less. The irritation induces scratching, which may set up somewhat severe inflammation or eczema. (2) Pediculus pubis, or crab-louse, inhabits the hairy parts of the body and extremities, more especially about the genitals. Its mode of life is much like that of the head-louse, but it is smaller, and often more difficult to detect. (3) Pediculus vestimentorum, or body-louse, infests the under- clothing, and lays its eggs there. It passes to the surface of the body merely in order to feed. It is somewhat larger than P. capitis.

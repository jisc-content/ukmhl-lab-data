In favourable circumstances these spores may germinate and develope into bacilli exactly like those originally taken from the blood. According to Koch, each spore consists of a bright body surrounded by an envelope of clear protoplasm. As the spore germinates the latter grows into a rodlet (Fig. 75 e). The researches of Klein, Brefeld, Prazmowski, Ewart, and others do not corroborate this account. They make out that the spore consists of protoplasm enclosed in a membrane. The rudimentary bacillus is developed not from the peripheral layer of the spore, but from its protoplasmic centre. In addition to this mode of increase by spore-formation observed in cultivated bacilli, the rodlets multiply by transverse subdivision. This is especially the case in the blood of living animals. As we have said, all bacilli have the power of forming spores. It is not however essential to the process that long filaments should be formed. Many bacilli produce spores without having undergone any marked increase in their length. The number of spores in each rodlet varies from one to three. They may occupy either a terminal or a medial position (Fig. 74, 10 and n). Anthrax-bacilli cultivated on gelatine are never motile (Koch): they always form flakes or tufts made up of long wavy tress-like or twined filaments. The bacilli of hay-infusion grow out into long filaments in very young colonies only. When they become

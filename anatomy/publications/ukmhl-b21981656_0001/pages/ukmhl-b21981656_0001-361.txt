It is 4 mm. long, and possesses only four segments, of which the last is larger than all the rest of the body (Fig. 113). The hooklets have a blunt process at the base, and are seated on a somewhat prominent rostellum. There are some thirty or forty of them. Only the cystic form or hydatid is known to occur in man; he acquires it by the introduc- tion of the eggs into the alimentary canal. When the embryo migrates from the in- testine to some other organ, it is transformed into a cyst incapable of active motion. The hydatid cyst consists of an external lamellar highly-elastic cuticle, and an internal lining of body-parenchyma consisting of granular matter, cells, muscle-fibres, and a vascular system. When the cyst reaches the size of a walnut (or in some cases sooner) it begins to develope from the parenchymatous layer a series of j?IG 1i3< fdll.GEOwn smaller vesicles (brood-capsules). The wall taenia echinococcus. of these is likewise two-fold; but the cuticular {From leucka r i : x 12) layer is within and the parenchymatous layer without. On these brood-capsules develope numbers of heads or scolices (Fig. 114). According to Leuckart they are formed out of sacculated out- growths from the external wall of the capsules (see the left side of Fig. 114). When the rudimentary head has become fully developed into a scolex (sometimes even sooner), it is retracted within the cyst which it thereby invaginates (Fig. 114). What was before the Fig. 114.

The original outer surfaces, which are parenchymatous, come now into contact and adhere to each other. The head is then

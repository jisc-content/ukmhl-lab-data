CHAPTER XXVI. TUMOURS DEVELOPED IN MESOBLASTIC TISSUES. CONNECTIVE-TISSUE TUMOURS. a. Fibroma. 142. A fibroma is a tumour made up of fibrous tissue. It usually takes the form of a sharply defined node or lump, and occupies a part only of the organ in which it is seated. , More rarely the organ (as e.g. the ovary) becomes transformed throughout into a fibrous mass. Fibromata occurring on epithelial or mucous surfaces often take a papillomatous form. The fibroma is of very varying consistence, according to the texture of its component tissue. It is often very firm and tough, grating under the knife, and having a glistening gristly look on section (desmoid fibroma). In other instances it may be soft and flabby, with a greyish translucent section. Other specimens will be found in which the scattered fibrous bands are dense and white and glistening, but the general structure is loose and incompact; so that the tumour as a whole is rendered limp and flabby. All varieties of intermediate forms occur between the firm and the soft, and even within the same tumour different parts may be of different consistence. The firm varieties are seen under the microscope to be made up chiefly of large coarse fibrous bundles, interspersed more or less thickly with cells whose proto- plasm is scanty. The softer fibromata, with then translucent greyish section, are usually richer in cells. By teasing out a fragment it is easy to isolate numbers of slender spindle-shaped or caudate cells. The intervening substance is more scanty, the fibrils less coarse and gathered into smaller bundles. Stained sections of such fibromata appear as if they were full of nuclei (Fig. 38). In loose-textured fibromata a clear juice is contained between the fibrous bundles, which are crossed and plaited and interwoven in all directions.

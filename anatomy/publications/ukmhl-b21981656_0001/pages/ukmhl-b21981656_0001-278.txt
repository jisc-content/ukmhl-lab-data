[SECT. VI. 258 TUMOURS. its normal or healthy state. We have indeed evidence of vascular alteration, infiltration of leucocytes, and even of new-formation of vessels and fibrous tissue; but this, the normal eliminating process, is feeble and sluggish, and is inadequate to deal with the intrusive epithelium. The vascular changes and the increased afflux of nutriment tend rather to react favourably upon the epithelium, and to foster its reproduction. It becomes gradually more and more activeâ€”and so the foundation of a carcinoma is laid. It seems not improbable that the process of neoplastic develop- ment does in fact occasionally pursue this general course. In other instances, it may well be that the fibrous basis-substance has a certain intrinsic predisposition favouring the formation of cancer, while the primary impulse which brings this into play is afforded only by some increase of formative activity on the part of the epithelial cells. The instructive discussion on the nature of cancer reported in the Trans. Path. Soc. 1874 should be consulted in this connexion. For an exposition of the constitutional theory, which makes cancer a specific blood-disease, see Paget, Surg. Path. Lects. 34, 35.

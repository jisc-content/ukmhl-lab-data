It depends on the properties of the fungus, which of these events takes place; just as do the changes it calls forth in the course of its multiplication. Fig. 79. Fig. 79.

Bacteria which settle in the smaller vessels give rise on the other hand to degenerations, necroses (Fig. 77 and Fig. 79 e), inflammations (Fig. 79 d e), and haemorrhages. The spot where a lodgement takes place is mostly matter of chance ; but it is to be noted that a bacterium may not be able to

('HAP. XXVII.] EPITHELIAL TUMOURS. CARCINOMA. 239 by sufficiently well-marked anatomical differences. The following are the most important. (1) Squamous epithelial cancer. The chief representative of this class is epithelioma or cutaneous cancroid (Fig. 62). This gives rise to warty and nodular tumours, or to diffuse thickenings of the skin. It is characterised by the occurrence in it of large epithelial nests, made up large multiform squamous cells. Ulcers are very often formed by the breaking down of the new tissue. If the section of an epithelioma be scraped, a gritty mass is obtained consisting mainly of nests and single cells. The nests often take the form of globes, in which the cells are arranged concentrically like the coats of an onion (Fig. 62 i). These at times become horny, forming what are called epithelial pearls. Epitheliomata in which these pearls are a distinct feature have been called horny or corneous cancroids. The tumour-cells of epithelioma are descendants of the superficial epidermis, and also of the epithelia of the hair-follicles and sebaceous glands. Squamous epithelial cancers occur in all the mucous membranes covered with squamous epitheliumâ€”in the mouth, pharynx, oesophagus, bladder, vagina, &c. (2) Cylindrical epithelial cancer. This has its seat in mucous membrane, chiefly that of the intestine, but also in that of Fig. 66. Glandular canceh or the uteiiuh.

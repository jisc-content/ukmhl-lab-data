NECltOSIS. 69 CHAP. VIII.] For example, the coagulation of the blood and formation of a clot is preceded by the liquefaction or solution of certain cells contained in the blood. A similar process may be observed in the case of blisters following upon bums. Fig. 4. Section through the epidermis and papillae after a burn.

This swelling up depends on the absorption by the dead cells of the liquid which transudes from the papillary vessels. It becomes at length so extreme that the cell-substance dissolves completely and the cell- mcmbrane itself disappears. Not until the tumefaction and colliquation have reached a certain point—i.e. when the cell is distended to a mere vesicle, or has gone altogether—do the granular fibrils which indicate coagulation begin to appear (f, g, h). In some tissues this coagulation after colliquation does not occur. Thus in anaemic necrosis (softening) of the brain we have simply disintegration and liquefaction of the brain-substance. The several constituents of the tissue break up, and dissolve in the liquid which is poured out from the vessels. They are then absorbed, and the liquid becomes gradually clear again: but there

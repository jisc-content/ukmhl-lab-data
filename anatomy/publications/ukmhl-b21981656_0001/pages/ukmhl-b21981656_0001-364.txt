PARASITES. [SECT. VII. 344 249. Bothriocephalus latus is the largest of human tape-worms. It measures 5 to 8 metres in length, and consists of three to four thousand short wide seg- ments (Fig. 115). The largest segment is about 3"5 mm. long and 10 to 12 mm. broad. To- wards the 'tail' the breadth diminishes arid the length in- creases. The body is thin and flattened like a ribbon. The central part of each segment pro- jects somewhat; it is here that the uterus lies, in the form of a simple tube coiled into numerous convolutions. When this is full of eggs the coils lie in contiguous loops, forming a kind of rosette. The genital openings are in the mesial line of the ventral surface, somewhat anteriorly ; the female opening being close behind the male. The testis consists of a series of sacculations lying along the lateral margins of the central layer of the body. The general structure of the body resembles that of the Taeniada. Anteriorly the worm becomes gradually more and more slender and at length thread-like. The head, which is 2*5 mm. long and 1 mm. broad, is club-shaped or oval in outline, and somewhat flattened. Along each lateral Fig. 115. Fkagments of a margin is a chink-like suctorial bothriocephalus latus. groove {From LEUGKART: natural size) The eggs (Fig. 116) are oval; they measure 0*07 mm.by0-045 mm. They have a thin brown shell furnished at the anterior pole with a lid or cap, which is in general easily seen. B. latus occurs chiefly in Switzerland and in the north-east of Europe: it is occasionally met with in Ireland. It lives like the Taeniada in the small intestine. The first development of the eggs takes place in water. After some tiSi' months an embryo is hatched, which is pro- (lkuckard vided with six hook lets and a ciliated cuticle. One is emptied of its contents and shows the lid.

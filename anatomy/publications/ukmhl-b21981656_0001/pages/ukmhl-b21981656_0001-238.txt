[SECT. VI. 218 TUMOURS. tumours. They are usually much firmer in texture than the round-celled forms. On section they look greyish or yellowish - white, and translucent; if the vessels are full of blood they may accidentally be tinged with red. They are generally speaking much less malignant than the round-celled sarcomata, but this depends somewhat on where they are seated. Sarcomata in which spindle-cells predominate are called briefly spindle-celled sarcomata: they are divided into large-celled and small-celled varieties. The cells may be more or less isolated by teasing out fragments of the tumour-tissue, and in this way very long spindle-cells may occasionally be found (Fig. 52). They lie side by side in the tumour, and group themselves into bundles. In a section these bundles may be seen cut through lengthwise, crosswise, or slantwise; which shows that they run in diverse directions through the growth. The grouping of the spindles into definite bundles is often very striking; but sometimes there is no such grouping, the spindles all lying parallel to the same direction throughout a considerable area. Sometimes also the arrangement of the spindles seems to depend on the direction of the vessels, the bundles forming a kind of sheathing to each vessel. Fig. 52. Fig. 53. Fig. 52.

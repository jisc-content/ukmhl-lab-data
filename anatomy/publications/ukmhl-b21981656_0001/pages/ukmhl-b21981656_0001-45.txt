CHAPTER II. MALFORMATIONS BY ARREST IN SINGLE INDIVIDUALS. a. Arrested development of the embryo as a whole. 6. If the development of the embryo as a whole be inter- rupted, one of two results will follow. When the disturbance is grave the further development of the embryo is rendered impossible; it either ceases to live forthwith, or it dwindles away and ultimately perishes unborn. A slighter disturbance may not exclude a certain amount of development, and as a result there is born a foetus whose general form is normal, though in size it is small and puny. A dead foetus cannot remain for long unchanged: sooner or later it undergoes certain retrograde alterations. In most cases, foetus and membranes are expelled from the womb: and this constitutes abortion. In other cases, that is to say, in the earlier stages of its development, the embryo may be absorbed and so disappear, the membranes undergoing a different fate. Most commonly they are expelled at once; but at times they remain and pass through further changes. In this latter way is generally formed the so- called fleshy mole (mola carnosa; otherwise clot- or blood- mole). This is a flesh-like mass consisting of membranes and altered blood-clots. The clots form the greater part of the mass; they are the result of hemorrhages from the maternal placenta, and are not infrequently the efficient cause of the death of the foetus. In other cases, the villi of the chorion undergo a peculiar degeneration, increase in size, and at length form a mass of club-shaped or spherical translucent cysts. These give the ovum at first sight the appearance of a bunch of grapes (whence the German name Traubenmole, or grape-mole.) The manner in which cyst grows out of cyst, and the absence of stems uniting the pedicles, render this comparison somewhat inexact. In England this ' cystic degeneration' of the membranes is often described as a hydatidiform mole.

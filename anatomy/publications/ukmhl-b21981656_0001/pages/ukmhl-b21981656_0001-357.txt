CHAP. XXXII.] 337 TAENIA. The latter is au excretory apparatus; it takes the form of two lateral canals running along the margins of the entire chain of segments and connected by cross-canals at both ends of each segment. Fine ramifications pass from these into the parenchyma. i 1 Fig. 107. Fig. 106. Immature and matube proglottides. (From LEUCKARl: natural size) Fig. 107. Two proglottides showing the uterus. (From LEUCKART: x 2) The male and female sexual organs lie close to each other. The testis is a clear or whitish convoluted tube with vesicles, lying in the fore-part of the segment. It passes into the vas deferens, and this into a cirrus or retractile extremity, which is rolled up within a muscular pouch or cloaca at the middle' of the lateral margin. The cirrus can be everted and protruded through the genital orifice. The opening of the female organ lies close behind the male opening in the same genital cloaca. From this the vagina passes backwards towards the hinder border of the segment. Before reaching the border it communicates with a copulative sac or receptacidum seminis, and receives the duct of the germ-bearing organ or true ovary. Then turning forwards it passes into an oviduct, into which opens the duct of the so-called vitelligenous organs. The entire ovigenous organ (which must be studied in unripe segments) is thus made up of an unpaired germ-bearing portion or true ovary and a pair of yolk-bearing or vitelligenous glands, all lying in the hinder part of the segment. The oviduct having received the ducts of these glands passes then into the dilated matrix or uterus, which in sexually mature segments forms a simple straight tube. The egg-germs leaving the true ovary become impregnated by spermatozoa from the seminal receptacle, and passing onwards are invested with yolk- m. 22

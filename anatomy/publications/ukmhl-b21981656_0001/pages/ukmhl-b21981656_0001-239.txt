CHAP. XXVI.] MESOBLASTICi TUMOURS. ALVEOLAR SARCOMA. 219 The intercellular substance may be very scanty, or altogether imperceptible in a section. In other cases it is abundant, and shows a kind of fibrillated structure. The cells are then poorer in protoplasm; so much so in fact that there is often none to be seen around the nucleus, and the cell-processes seem to start from the nucleus itself (' nuclear fibres'). Such tumours are firm and coarse- grained, and approach the fibromata in texture. They are called fibrosarcomata. Sarcomata whose cells are of several diverse forms are equally common. Their cells are spindle-shaped, pyramidal, prismatic, stellate, or altogether irregular (Fig. 53). Each cell seems in fact to take the form of the space which is left to it to fill. Sarcomata of this kind, as also the spindle-celled kind, usually contain a larger or smaller number of giant-cells (Fig. 53). These tumours are perhaps more properly described as giant-celled or myeloid sarcomata than those referred to in Art. 159. They chiefly affect the osseous system. The vessels of a sarcoma have generally walls which are quite distinguishable. In some cases however they have the appearance of canals excavated in the substance of the tumour, the tumour- cells themselves bounding the lumen of the vessel. Here it would seem as if the tumour had in part arisen from multipli- cation of the cells in the original vessel-wall. 161. Sarcomata of peculiar types. Sarcomata do not usually exhibit any special structure, or any resemblance to a Fig. 54. Section from a melanotic alveolae sarcoma of the skin.

The white cells in this way escape, migrate, or extravasate from the vessel (vein or capillary) by diapedesis. The first white blood-cells which migrate are quickly followed by others, and in six to eight hours the veins and capillaries are surrounded by a multitude of white cells, or leucocytes, which gradually distribute themselves through the tissue by active loco- motion. From the capillaries, in which the circulation becomes very irregular and often stops altogether, there escape red blood-cells (g), as well as white. If the mesentery be slightly strained so that the circulation is brought to a stand-still (stasis) at some point, the migration ceases there. Blood-cells do not escape from the arteries. Associated with the escape of the formed elements of the blood, there is always an escape of liquid. This is not in general directly perceptible, but is evidenced by the accumulation of liquid which takes place in the substance and on the surface of the mesentery.

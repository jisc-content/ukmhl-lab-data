CHAPTER XII. MUCOID AND COLLOID DEGENERATION. 55. The mucoid degeneration of the tissues has its physio- logical type in the mucus-secretion of the mucous membranes and mucous glands. As is well known, the epithelium of the mucous membranes contains so-called goblet-cells (Eimer). These look like goblets filled to overflowing with a transparent substance. This latter is mucus formed from the cell-protoplasm. The epithelial cells of the mucous glands are similar. They swell up when about to secrete mucus; the central parts become transparent, and the granules of the protoplasm become aggregated into groups or strings. â–  The so-called mucus-corpuscles in the salivary secretion, with their glassy contents and tremulous granules, are merely leucocytes which have undergone mucoid metamorphosis. The mucous substance formed from the protoplasm of the cell may be extruded, and the cell may recover: in other cases the cell perishes. The same process of mucus-formation takes place under patho- logical conditions. For example, in catarrh of the mucous membrane we find that the increased secretion of mucus depends on an increased mucus-forming power in the lining epithelial cells, as well as in the cells of the mucous glands. Investigation shows that in cylindrical epithelium the goblet-cells (Fig. 11, 6) are increased in number. In the secretion also we may find cells in a state of complete mucoid degeneration; they are transformed into glassy masses containing a few scattered granules (3 and 5). In other cells (7) the mucus may take the form of lumps of various sizes, enclosed within the unchanged cell-protoplasm. The epithelia of pathological tissues may like the normal ones undergo mucoid change. Typical goblet-cells are occasionally found in the epithelial lining of ovarian and intestinal cysts. In certain forms of cancer, the majority of the epithelial cells undergo mucoid degeneration.

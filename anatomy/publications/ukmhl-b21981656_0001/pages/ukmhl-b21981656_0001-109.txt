89 CHAP. XIII.] AMYLOID DEGENERATION AND CONCRETIONS. If a microscopic section of an amy- loid liver be so treated as to bring out the minuter changes in its structure, it is not hard to show that the seat of the affection is in the capillary walls, that is, in the periendothelial fibrous tissue. The endothelium is thickly coated on its outer aspect with a uniform glassy layer, here and there broken up into lumps (Fig. 12); this is the amyloid deposit. The liver-cells may remain un- changed between the amyloid masses, or they may be misshapen and partly atrophied. They very often contain fat. If the afferent vessels be examined, it will be found that they too exhibit amyloid patches, especially in their middle coat. The appearances in an amyloid kidney are exactly similar (Fig. 13). A good section shows as before that the formation of the homogeneous deposit occurs mainly in the vessel-walls. The Fig. 12. Amyloid degenera- tion OF LIVER CAPILLARIES.

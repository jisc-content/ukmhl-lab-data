The relative proportion of cells in the gumma varies with its site. Varieties which are poor in cells, such as are found at times in bone, are soft and gummy in texture. On section they have a gelatinous look, the liquid constituents exceed- ing the cellular in quantity. The older surrounding tissue under- goes in part a mucoid change. Varieties rich in cells, met with chiefly in the pia mater and arachnoid, and the spleen, form nodes or patches which are translucent, grey or whitish or greyish red in colour, and rounded (spleen) or irregular (brain-membranes) in shape. They have in fact the exact appearance of granulations.

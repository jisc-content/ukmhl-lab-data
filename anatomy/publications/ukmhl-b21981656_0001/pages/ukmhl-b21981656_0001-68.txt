CHAPTER V. ANOMALIES IN THE DISTRIBUTION OF THE LYMPH. OEDEMA AND DROPSY. 23. The lymph which bathes the tissues is merely a transudation from the blood, mingled with the products of tissue-change. The transuded liquid is taken up by the lym- phatics from the lymph-spaces of the tissues, and carried back into the venous system through the thoracic duct. Every change in the circulation, which determines an increased transudation of liquid from the blood, leads by consequence to an increased satura- tion of the tissues. This increased saturation is generally balanced by an increased discharge through the lymph-channels. But this compensating action has its limits. If the transudation from the blood-vessels still increases, there at last comes a time when the saturation of the tissues with liquid can no longer be kept down, and so it rises above the normal degree. The condition in which fluid collects in the substance of the tissues is called oedema. When the fluid collects in the greater cavities of the body we have hydrops or dropsy. The liquid transudation in oedema and dropsy has never the same composition as blood-plasma: it is always markedly poorer in albumen. Tissues which are the seat of oedema swell up; but the degree of swelling depends in great measure upon the structure of the tissue. The skin and subcutaneous cellular tissue may in virtue of their structure undergo extreme distension: an oedematous limb may thus become enormously swollen. It looks pale, is doughy to the touch, and ' pits' on pressure with the finger. It is customary to. describe oedema of the integumentary structures as anasarca. If an anasarcous part be cut into, the fibrous bundles of the tissue are seen to be separated from each other by clear liquid, which trickles away from the cut surfaces. Other structures, like the kidney, are much less capable of containing large quantities of liquid than are the integuments.

CHAP. XXVI.] MESOBLASTIC TUMOURS. ANGIOMA. 207 from each other merely by fibrous septa (Fig. 43). In section these cavities appear as sinuses of various size, separated by Fig. 43. Congenital cavernous angioma of the skin. (Haematoxylin staining: x 20) a epidermis b corium c cavernous blood-spaces a trabecular network of nucleated fibrous or spindle-celled tissue. The separation is not complete, as the spaces communicate with each other. The mass resembles greatly the corpus cavernosum of the penis, and is sometimes described as composed of ' erectile' tissue. The walls of the cavities are lined with endothelium. These tumours are commonly seated in the skin, and may be congenital (Fig. 43). In other cases they are developed from simple angiomata by continued dilatation of the already dilated vessels. In the skin they form livid raised and sometimes un- even patches (naevus prominens). Among the viscera the liver is by far the commonest seat. Here they take the form of dark brown patches, not raised above the surface, and not compressing the liver-tissue, which indeed they simply replace. They are never congenital, but are developed in advanced age when the liver is tending towards atrophy. It is easy to make out in favourable specimens that the cavities have arisen from the varicose dilatation of individual capillaries within the lobules, the liver-cells disappearing simultaneously (Fig. 44).

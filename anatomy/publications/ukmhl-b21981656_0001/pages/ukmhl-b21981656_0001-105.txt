85 CHAP. XII.] MUCOID AND COLLOID DEGENERATION. The fibrous tissues, like the epithelia, are also liable to undergo mucoid degeneration. Thus connective tissue, cartilage, bone, Fig. 11. Cataehhal secbetions from various mucous membeanes. (x 400) A from cylindrical epithelium, B from the mouth, C from the bladder. 1, round- cells (pus corpuscles). 2, large round-cells with clear nuclei from the nose. 3, mucoid cylindrical cells from the nose. 4, Spirillum from the nose. 5, mucoid ciliated cells from the nose. 6, goblet-cell from the trachea. 7, round-cells with mucus-masses from the nose. 8, epithelial cells containing pus corpuscles from the nose. 9, fatty cells in chronic laryngeal and pharyn- geal catarrh. 10, cells from sputum containing soot-pigment. 11 and 12, squamous epithelium from the mouth. 13, mucus-corpuscles. 14, micrococci. 15, Bacterium tcrmo. 16, Leptothrix buccalis. 17, Spirochaeta denticola. 18, superficial cells from the bladder; 19, deeper layer. 20, pus corpuscles. 21, Schizomycetes or bacteria. adipose tissue, marrow, sarcomatous tissue, may all become mucoid, and so assume a jelly-like translucent appearance. In these tissues it is usually the ground-substance which is transformed. The fibrous constituents lose their structure and become homogeneous. The tissue-cells may persist, or become fatty, or they may take part in the mucoid change. The final product is a hyaline mass recalling the original tissue only by virtue of a few stray fibrous shreds, or single cells, or groups of cells, scattered through it. Mucus swells up readily in water; acetic acid makes it co- agulate ; alcohol makes it turbid, white and opaque.

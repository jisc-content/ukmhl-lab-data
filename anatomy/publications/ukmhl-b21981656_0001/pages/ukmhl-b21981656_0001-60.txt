[SECT. I. 40 MALFORMATIONS. depends on a general hypertrophy of all the elements of the member, sometimes on a mere over-development of adipose tissue. Like the limbs, other organs also may reach abnormal dimen- sions by augmentation of their normal elements. This is the case with the thyroid gland, the tongue, the mammae, the kidneys, the bladder, the uterus, the clitoris, the labia pudendi, and the penis. Full references to the literature of congenital hypertrophy are given in Kessler's Inaugural-Dissertation iiber einen Fall von Macropodia lipomatosa Halle 1869. Compare also Eeid {Month. Joum. med. science 1843); Curling (Med. chir. Trans, xxvin); TriSlat and Monod (Be Vhypertrophie unilate'rale, Arch. gen. de rne'd. 1869) ; Friedreich (Congenital unilateral hypertrophy of the head, Virch. Arch. vol. 28). Cases of congenital hypertrophy of the limbs are reported by Busch (Arch. f. hlin. Chir. vn) ; Friedberg (Virch. Arch. vol. 40); Little (Trans. Path. Soc. 1866); Fischer (Der Riesenwuchs, Deutsche Zeitsch. f. Chir. 1880); Anderson (St Thorn. Hosp. Rep. London 1882). A good instance of hereditary polydactylism is given by Lucas, Guy's Hosp. Rep. London 1881.

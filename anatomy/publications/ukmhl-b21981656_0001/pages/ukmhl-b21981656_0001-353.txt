333 CHAP. XXXII.] TREMATODA. 237. Distoma hepaticum, the liver-fluke (Fig. 99), is a leaf- shaped trematode 28 mm. long and 12 mm. broad. The head-end projects like a beak, and bears a small suctorial disc in which the ElG. yi). DISTOMA HEPATICUM WITH MALE AND FEMALE GENITAL OKGANS. (From LEUCKART: X 2J) orifice of the mouth is visible. Immediately behind this on the ventral surface is another suctorial disc. The genital orifice lies between the two discs. The uterus is a convoluted tube lying behind the posterior disc. The ovaries lie on each side of the hinder part of the body, and between them lie the deeply bifurcated testes. The intestinal canal is also bifurcated and much branched. The eggs (Fig. 100) are oval, 0'13 mm. long and 0 08 'mm. broad. When placed in water a globular embryo is developed, Fig. 100. Egg of distoma hepaticum. (From LEUCKART: x 200) which swims freely by means of its ciliated envelope. The details of its life-history are not certainly known. The adult animal infests the biliary ducts: more rarely it is found in the intestine or in the vena cava. It is rare in man, but very common among the ruminants : it causes the ' rot' in sheep. The consequences of its invasion, especially in great numbers, are obstruction of the biliary ducts, accumulation of bile, dilatation and incrustation of the ducts with biliary matters, inflammation around them and hyper- plasia of the hepatic connective tissues, with associated atrophy of the liver-cells. 238. Distoma lanceolatum is only 8 or 9 mm. long and 2 to 2*5 mm. broad. It is lancet-shaped, and the head-end does not markedly project. The integument is naked. The two lobulated

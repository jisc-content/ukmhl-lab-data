242 [SECT. VI. TUMOURS. There is no sharp line to be drawn between scirrhus and simple cancer. Within one and the same growth we may find a part having the texture of scirrhus, and another resembling simple cancer (Fig. 68). The question is merely whether the stroma or the cellular elements predominate. The characteristic hardness of scirrhus is found at spots where the fibrous stroma is not so much alveolated as interspersed with small fusiform cell-nests (Fig. 68 g h). The cancer-cells often perish by fatty degeneration, and are then absorbed. The coarse fibrous stroma is left, looking like a deposit of firm scar-tissue. Cancers which have become hard and fibrous in this way are found not only in the mamma but also in the stomach, testis, ovary, and kidney. (6) Colloid (otherwise gelatinous or alveolar) cancer occurs as a definite tumour or a diffuse infiltration. It is most frequently found in the alimentary tract and in the mamma, more rarely in the ovary or other organ. It is characterised by the translucency of its substance. The stroma seems to contain masses of jelly rather than the usual more or less opaque cell-nests. The transparent glassy look may be apparent even on the outside of the tumour. This is true, for instance, in the case of colloid cancer of the mucous membrane, which usually forms semi-trans- jDarent papillary or fungous excrescences. In the mamma the colloid character becomes apparent only on cutting through the tumour. It often happens that the whole tumour is not alike; some parts being translucent, others greyish or reddish like the more ordinary forms. Fig. 69. Colloid cancer of the mamma.

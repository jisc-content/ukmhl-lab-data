187 CHAP. XXIV.] THE INFECTIVE GRANULOMATA. brae. In all the affected regions the destruction of tissue was very considerable. As regards the genesis of the disease, it seems very probable that the mouth is the starting-point of the infection. ISEAEL, Johne, and Ponfick affirm that in healthy individuals the specific fungus is now and then found lying in the follicular crypts of the tonsils. It has also been discovered in concretions from the lacrimal duct, and in hollow teeth. The observations of the above authors, with those of BOLLINGER, make it probable that infection often follows upon wounds of the oral cavity (e.g. those left after the extraction of teeth). Israel believes that the spores or fungi may be inhaled, and so give rise to the disease in the lungs. Clinically speaking, the disease is chiefly marked by its chronic course and local malignancy. Metastasis is not common. Israel's researches were published in Virch. Arch. vols. 76, 78: Bol- linger's in the Centralb. f. med. Wiss. 27, 1877. Since then the affection has more than once been observed in man. Johne and Ponfick have been the chief writers on the human affection. Johne demonstrated the inocula- bility of the disease in animals (Deutsch. Zeitsch. f. Thiermed. vn, 1881). Ponfick has quite recently published a monograph (Die Actinomycose des Nenschen Berlin 1882), in which the published observations on the disease are brought together; light is thrown on its aetiology by new observations and experiments; and the significance of the various morbid processes is explained. Gannet gives a useful summary in Bost. med. surcf. Joum. Aug. 31, 1882. Pflug lately described a case of actinomycosis in a cow, which took the form of miliary nodules disseminated through the lungs (Cent. f. med. Wiss. 14, 1882); Hink (ibid. 46,1882) gives another case, in which the nodular affection was confined to a part of one lung.

198 [SECT. VI. TUMOURS. the most part sharply defined. These characters are usually wanting in hyperplasias, such for instance as those consequent on chronic inflammation. Now and then however we meet with inflammatory hyperplasias which are circumscribedâ€”such as venereal warts in the skin, and the nodes developed in the lungs around inhaled dust-particles. As in the last instance, their texture may be different from that of the matrix. It is the life-history and mode of genesis to which we must appeal in such cases. Inflammatory hyperplasias, being mere products of inflammation, cannot properly be reckoned among the true tumours. b. Myxoma. 143. When the ground-substance of a fibroma swells up by the imbibition of fluid, it becomes gradually more and more translucent and may even become transparent. The tumour at length resembles a mass of jelly. A swollen fibrous tumour of this kind is best described as an oedematous fibroma. The texture of many oedematous fibromata much resembles that of the umbilical cord in nearly mature foetuses; where the cells and fibrils are more or less thrust asunder and interpenetrated by a transparent juice (Wharton's jelly). Adipose tissue, whether neoplastic (Art. 144) or normal, may similarly become transformed into a gelatinous mass. The fat disappears from the cells, and a dense saline liquid collects between them. They ultimately assume a ramified or stellate form. No sharp line can be drawn between jelly-like oedematous fibromata and lipomata, and true myxoma. Many writers do not hesitate to include the former class among the myxomata. It is Fig. 39. Cells from a periosteal myxoma of the thigh. (Gold staining: x 400)

CHAP. XXVII.] EPITHELIAL TUMOURS. ADENOMA. 231 adenoma is apt to grow to an enormous size, and very often imperils the life of the patient afflicted with it. It usually takes the form of a multilocular cystoma or cystadenoma, as it is called; and is made up of a multitude of small and large cysts. These contain a ropy, clear or turbid, and variously tinted liquid. Their inner surface resembles that of smooth mucous membrane. The walls are chiefly of a fibrous texture: but here and there occur masses of tissue with a soft marrow-like section and white or pink in colour, which resemble parenchymatous gland-substance. These masses exemplify the early stages of the tumour's development: they consist of a fibro-celhilar stroma, containing glandular tubules lined with tall cylindrical epithelium (Fig. 60). Some of the Fig. 60. Section from a papuliferous cystadenoma. (Haematoxylin staining: x 40) tubules are dilated. This dilatation is the first step towards the formation of a cyst; it is the result of an accumulation of secretion. When small cysts are thus formed, the fibrous tissue round them often proceeds to grow into the cavity in the form of papillary protuberances (Fig. 60). These papillary growths, which often develope in vast numbers, give to this variety its specific name of papuliferous cystadenoma. 169. All adenomata have not the same grave significance, whether we regard the affected organ or the system generally. Ovarian adenoma destroys the organ and jeopardises life by its size; but it forms no metastases and does not invade neighbouring structures. Adenoma of a sweat-gland or sebaceous gland remains as a local tumour, never reaching any great size. But the case is different with the adenomata of the alimentary canal, namely those of the stomach, large or small intestine, and rectum. Each of these tends to invade and destroy the surrounding parts, and to form

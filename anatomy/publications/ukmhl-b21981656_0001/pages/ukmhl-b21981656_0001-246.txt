These masses sometimes contain trabecular cores of new-formed bone (/). In- stead of the marrow, which should fill the interior of the bone (b), we find vascularised cartilage also containing numbers of trabeculae. The genesis and primary seat of the growth may thus be made out at once from this preparation. Cartilaginous proliferation has been set up in the periosteum and in the medullary tissue, and the product has subsequently been partially transformed into bone. Osteosarcoma has an exactly analogous appearance. The difference is merely that sarcomatous tissue fills the spaces between

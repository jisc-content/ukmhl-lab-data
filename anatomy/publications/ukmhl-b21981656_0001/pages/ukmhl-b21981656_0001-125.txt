105 THE FOEMATION OF CYSTS. CHAP. XVII.] substance. Similar cavities arising in tumours by the same process are also called cysts. In order to emphasise the difference between such cysts and cysts of retention, the former may be spoken of as cysts of disintegration. Lastly, a species of cyst may be formed around a foreign body which has become lodged in the tissues; round a parasite like a hydatid, for example (Art. 245). It is the result of a new tissue- formation in the neighbourhood of the foreign body. The student should consult the admirable lectures on Cysts in Paget's Surgical Pathology ; they contain many references of value. To the varieties in the text we might addâ€”cysts of extravasation, or blood-cysts, resulting from haemorrhage into closed cavities {e.g. haematoma, haematocele): and dermoid cysts, which are congenital (Art. 178). The various neoplastic cysts or cystoid tumours will be referred to under their proper headings in Section vi. ; and, so far as they affect particular organs, in the Special Pathological Anatomy.

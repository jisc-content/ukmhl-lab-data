CHAPTER XV. INFILTRATION OF THE TISSUES WITH SALTS. 64. Petrification or incrustation is a process of transforma- tion characterised by the deposit in a tissue of various salts derived ultimately from the blood. In by far the greater number of cases the deposit consists of carbonates and phosphates of calcium, with a small quantity of the magnesium salts: it is in fact calcareous or chalky. As we know, calcareous deposition takes place in special regions as a normal physiological process. The formation of true bone is always preceded by the deposit of calcareous salts in the cartilagi- nous structures first laid down. This deposit takes the form of minute granules, which on magnification look like grains of dust or irregular crumbs, and they are seen to lie chiefly in the matrix- substance and cell-cajDsules of the cartilage. If the grains he thick together, they give the part a whitish colour and a firm consistence. In the same way as under normal conditions, but in the most various regions of the body, we may have a morbid deposition or precipitation of calcareous salts in the tissues. Experience shows that the tissues affected are either already necrosed, as in the case of caseous lymphatic glands, dead parasites, thrombi, and dead foetuses (lithopaedia),â€”or have been seriously stinted in their nutrition. This latter is the case in fatty degeneration of the tunica media of the arteries, or in fatty degeneration of tumours such as uterine fibroids. The cause of calcareous deposits is thus a local one. The calcium-salts dissolved in the blood are not simply precipitated and retained by the tissue, but they proceed to form solid compounds with the albuminoids. Commencing calcification is not recognisable by the naked eye. When the deposit becomes more dense the tissue turns white. At the same time it often becomes extremely hard and cannot be cut with the knife. In other cases it becomes in colour and consistence more like mortar.

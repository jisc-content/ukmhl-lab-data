CHAP. XXVI.] MESOBLASTIC TUMOURS. LYMPHANGIOMA. 209 telangiectasis, and cavernous lymphangioma; together with a third form, the cystoid lymphangioma. As in the foregoing cases, the magnitude and arrangement of the dilatations may vary greatly. In the extreme stages actual cysts may be formed. The cavities contain lymph, which is generally clear and limpid, though it is sometimes milky. The growth may be congenital or acquired. Congenital lymphatic dilatations take various forms according to their seat, which may be the tongue (macroglossia), lips (macrocheilia), skin (lymphatic naevus), labia, &c. Lymphangiectasis of the skin is not rare as an acquired affection; it chiefly occurs in the thigh and thorax. Sometimes it gives rise to considerable tumours, which fluctuate on palpation. The section represented in Fig. 45 was taken from a tumour as large as the fist, which had formed in the subcutaneous fat of the thigh. The dilated and sacculated lymphatics have their walls more or less thickened, and they are generally embedded in the adipose tissue. Fig. 45. Subcutaneous caveknous lymphangioma.

The affection is often complicated with fibrous hyperplasia of the skin (as in elephantiasis lymphangiectodes), or of other organs. References:â€”Maier, Lehrb. d. allg. path.

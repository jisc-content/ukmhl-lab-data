In this case then, we may regard the carcinoma as an epithelial infiltration of the corium starting in the superficial epidermis. The share taken by the corium itself is not always the same. At first we are generally unable to detect in it any histological change whatsoever. The fibrous stroma in which the epithelial cells are lodged is furnished by the unaltered corium alone. In other cases, and in later stages (Fig. 62 h), a perceptible amount of cell-multiplication and occasion- ally of vascularisation takes place. It almost looks as if the fibrous tissue were endeavouring, by compensatory growth on its own part, to counteract the invasion of its borders by the epithelium. In tumours formed in the way we have described, the intruded masses of epithelial cells are spoken of as cancerous cell-nests, and the separate cells as cancer-cells. The fibrous framework in which they lie, made up partly of pre-existing and partly of new- formed fibrous tissue, is called the cancerous stroma. 171. The development of cancer in glands is essentially similar to that which starts in squamous epithelium or epidermis. Thus

CHAP. XXI.] EARLY STAGES OF INFLAMMATION. EXUDATION. 145 appear as yellowish white deposits, consisting chiefly of granular fibrinous trabeculae (Fig. 23 c) and filaments, interspersed with pus-corpuscles in varying amount. Fig. 23. Section of a croupous membrane from the trachea, (x 250) In other cases, the false membrane is chiefly made up of hyaline flakes and lumps (Fig. 24 b).' (3) Purulent or fibrino-purulent exudation. When the migration of white blood-cells from the vessels is very extensive, and coagulation does not immediately ensue, the exudation as- sumes a whitish milky or creamy appearance. It consists simply of a liquid plasma and small leucocytes containing from one to three nuclei, and is called ' matter' or pus. It is commonly the consequence of bacterial infection. The bacteria seem to act so as to hinder coagulation. When the purulent liquid contains in addition white flakes of fibrin infiltrated with pus-cells, the exuda- tion is described as fibrino-purulent. It takes this form chiefly in inflammations of the serous membranes. When purulent infiltra- tion leads to liquefaction and dissolution of the tissues, so that a pus-containing cavity is formed, we have what is called an abscess. If the loss of tissue is superficial, and a morbid surface is formed which secretes pus, we have an ulcer. Secretion of pus from the skin, mucous membrane, or synovial membrane, constitutes puru- lent catarrh. An infiltration, partly purulent and partly serous, is described as purulent oedema. (4) Haemorrhagic exudation. Blood may be mingled with serous, fibrinous, or purulent exudations, and is readily distinguished, by its colouring them red. Such mixed exudations are called haemorrhagic. (5) Putrid exudation. When from the presence of septic bacteria the exudation undergoes putrefaction, it is described as foul, putrid, or sanious. a false membrane b surface layer of the mucous mem- brane infiltrated with leucocytes (cZj) c fibrin d pus-corpuscles M. 10

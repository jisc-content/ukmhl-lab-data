132 FORMATIVE DISTURBANCES OF NUTRITION. [SECT. IV. Conversely, osseous tissue may pass into fibrous tissue or cartilage, especially the former, as happens very frequently in senile bone-affections. The ground-substance of the bone becomes decal- cified and fibrillated, while the bone-corpuscles become connective- tissue cells. The fibrous structures found in tumours are, like the normal ones, liable to metamorphosis into others of the same class. The metaplastic processes resemble those in normal tissues. The highly cellular sarcomatous tissue is very prone to transformations; and these are generally such as to show that it is allied to the connective-tissue group. 92. Metaplasia is to be distinguished from the simple de- generations as well as from the proliferative processes. In degene- ration no new tissue is formed, and what exists perishes. In proliferation new tissue is formed from a cellular matrix or blastema, which is the result of cell-multiplication. Metaplasia stands in a measure between these. New tissue is formed; but there is no cell-multiplication, or if there is it is quite subordinate. From many points of view metaplasia seems related to the retrogressive processes. The transformation of a tissue into mucoid tissue is near akin to mucoid degeneration. The new or trans- formed tissue is moreover not infrequently an unstable and perish- able one. On the other hand, proliferation is no uncommon accompaniment of metaplasia, which is thus brought into relation with the progressive or formative disturbances of nutrition. The factor of greatest importance, as regards the further development of the transformed tissue, is the behaviour of the blood-vessels. If good vascularization is effected, the tissue continues to live and grow: if not, then retrogressive changes are apt to set in.

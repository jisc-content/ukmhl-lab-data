I CHAP. XVIII.] CELLULAR PROCESSES TN HYPERPLASIA ETC. 121 tissue. Pathological vicarious tissue of this kind is described as cicatricial or scar tissue. It is the result of an inflammatory process (Art. 108), or of multiplication among the connective-tissue cells. With nerves and muscles the case is much the same. Deficien- cies of any size are filled up with scar-tissue. The connective and epithelial tissues are more favourably circumstanced. The latter especially have the power of reproduc- ing wide areas of lost surface. Among the fibrous tissues, the periosteum is remarkable for its regenerative power; while carti- lage is replaced very imperfectly if at all. 83. When by a process of proliferation a new tissue is produced whose elements are normal in type, though the type is not that of the matrix-tissue, we speak of the formation as a heteroplasia. In one sense a cicatrix in an organ like the liver is a heteroplasia, inasmuch as fibrous tissue replaces the proper liver-tissue. And even when the fibrous tissue of the cicatrix is compared with that of the liver, we must still regard the cicatrix as heteroplastic: the characters of the two tissues are markedly different. This is true of fibrous hyperplasias in general, and in particular of those consequent on inflammation. Owing to the generic resemblance of the normal and pathological tissues, however, it is not usual to reckon these among the heteroplasias. The special field of heteroplastic formations lies among the tumours or morbid growths. A tumour, in the limited sense of the term, is a formation of new tissue. It may resemble more or less the matrix-tissue from which it grows, but it always possesses certain characteristics which distinguish it from the surrounding structures, and which justify us in speaking of it as heteroplastic.

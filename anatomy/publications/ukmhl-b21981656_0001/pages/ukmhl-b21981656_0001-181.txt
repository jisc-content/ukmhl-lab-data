CH. XXIII.] IMPERFECT RE-ABSORPTION. FOREIGN SUBSTANCES. 161 116. Many foreign substances, and especially certain altered organic products, have a far more baneful effect on the surrounding tissues than any we have yet considered. Such, in a high degree, is dead tissue which from contamination with septic matters has passed into a state of putrid decomposition. In the course of this decomposition various chemical compounds are formed which act harmfully on the tissue (Art. 42), and set up in it progressive destructive changes, and violent haemorrhagic or purulent inflammation. Under the action of the pus-cells, which form in great quantity, and of the septic ferments, the necrosed tissue becomes dissolved. If it is connected with living tissue, a suppurative zone of demarcation is formed and sets it free : the result is a cavity filled with pusâ€”an abscess. The process often continues, the infiltration and dissolution of tissue go on, and the abscess grows larger and larger. If decomposing matter from the abscess reach the blood-vessels or lymphatics, and is so conveyed to other regions, it may lead to putrid decomposition and purulent inflammation at the spots where it lodges. In this way metastatic abscesses are formed. If the inflamed region be near a free surface and at length breaks through it, we have a suppurating ulcer formed. Should death not result from this destructive suppuration or purulent necrosis, the injury done may be repaired by the formation of granulation-tissue at the boundary of the living tissue and the dead. In the course of time the pus secreted may be absorbed, or solidified and encapsuled. 11

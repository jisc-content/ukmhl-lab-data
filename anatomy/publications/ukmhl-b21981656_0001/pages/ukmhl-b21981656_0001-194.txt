174 INFLAMMATION AND INFLAMMATORY GROWTHS. [SECT. V. A short but very comprehensive summary of the evidence for the trans- missibility of tuberculosis from man to man, and from man to lower animals, is given by Klein (Practitioner Aug. 1881). The student who desires to know the 'state of the case' for the specific nature of tuberculosis immediately before Koch's discovery cannot do better than to consult this article. Inoculation-experiments have been made in various ways. The tuber- culous matter has been inserted under the skin, into the peritoneal cavity, into the eye, and into the joints : it has been mixed with the food: it has been pidverised and conveyed to the lungs with the respired air. „ Keferences:—Villemin, Gazette hebd. 50, 1865; Comp. rend. 61, 1866; Etudes sur la tubercidose 1868: Lebert, Bullet, de Vacad. xxxn; Gaz. me'd. de Pans, 25—29,1867 : Lebert and Wyss, Virch.

Two important questions remain unanswered. Tuber- culosis is an infective disease: and it bears the anatomical character of a destructive nodular inflammation. It is important for dia- gnostic purposes to know something more. Does the tuberculous inflammatory process manifest itself by the formation of nodules only ? Conversely, are all varieties of cellular nodules, exhibiting the general structure of tubercles, to be regarded as evidence of tuberculosis ? The second question is—What is the nature of the tuberculous virus ? In answer to the former question, clinical observation and experiments on animals have shown that all nodular eruptions are not tuberculous. Thus when small irritating foreign bodies are introduced into the body of an animal, it sometimes happens that a nodular affection is produced which anatomically simulates tuberculosis. Yet these nodules have in reality no kindred with true tubercles. The exciting cause is essentially different (Art. 127) from that which engenders true tuberculosis; while neither the life-history of the nodules, nor the course of the process as a whole, corresponds with what is observed in human tuberculosis. Moreover, there occur in man certain nodular inflammations whose clinical course is radically different from that of tuberculosis, though the nodules in some' degree resemble tubercles. The best known instance is lupus of the skin (Art. 132). In this affection perfectly typical tubercles are frequently formed; but they never induce tuberculosis in other organs, or general tuberculosis. In

80 RETROGRESSIVE DISTURBANCES OF NUTRITION. [SECT. III. 51. A cell undergoing fatty degeneration always shows larger or smaller oil-drops in its interior. These are colourless, bright, dark contoured, insoluble in acetic acid, soluble in alcohol and in ether. In perosmic acid they stain black. The number and size of the oil-drops in the interior of a cell vary greatly: the size even of the largest is not usually great. Thus, for example, in fatty degeneration of the muscle of the heart, we find more or fewer according to the degree of the degeneration (Fig. 8). But they are all small and seldom coalesce into larger drops: they never form very large ones. In fatty degeneration ^nL^on'of oi the kidney (Fig. 9) the appearances are similar; the muscles of but the size of the oil-globules is not so regular (c, e). THE HEABT (* 35Â°) Fig. 9.

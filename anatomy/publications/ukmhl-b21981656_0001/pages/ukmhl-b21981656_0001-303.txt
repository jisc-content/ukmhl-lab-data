CHAP, WX.] THE SC1IIZ0MYCETES OR BACTERIA. 2m nucleus is broken up, or swells and disappears (Fig. 76 c). The fibrous elements of the connective tissue degenerate like the epithelial cells. The ground-substance alters at the same time. It becomes turbid, loses its structure, and ultimately dissolves. Fig. 76. Section containing colonies of micrococci from the vocal coed of a child.

When this may occur, and how widely it may spread, are circumstances depending on the nature of the bacteria and of the tissue. The processes we have considered are not without their influence on the circulation. The direct action of the bacteria, and the influence of the chemical changes they set up, tell at length on the vessel-walls within the affected region. The result is to disturb the circulation in various ways, chiefly in the way of inflammatory exudation and haemorrhage. In some instances the circulation is stopped altogether, and the preservation of the affected tissue is then impossible. The inflammatory process set up by bacterial action (Fig. 76 e) may be of very different intensity and extent in different cases. It may be slight and transient, or it may be severe and issue in suppuration and necrosis. Not unfrequently a more or less perfect granulation-tissue is formed as a result of the inflammation, as in tuberculosis. The extravasated cells often take up the bacteria into their substance.

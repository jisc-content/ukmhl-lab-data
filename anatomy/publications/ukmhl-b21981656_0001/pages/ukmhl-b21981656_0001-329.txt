HYPHOMYCETES OR MOULDS. 309 CHAP. XXXI.] membranes the contents flow together. The single new cell thus produced is the zygospore. Its membrane becomes thickened and Fig. 82. Development by conidia and zygospores. A the conidiophore or conidia-bearing hypha of Mucor Mucedo in optical section B mycelium of Phycornyces nitens ; g conidiophore ; m unicellular mycelium [three days old: grown in plum-decoction and gelatine : the finest ramifications are left out in the draioing: from SACHS) C germinating zygospore (z) of Mucor Mucedo; the germinal tube or hypha (7c) throws out a conidiophore (g) D free conjugating branches (bb) whose tips (aa) have not yet coalesced, but are marked off by. septa: the zygospore results from the coalescence of the cells (aa). it grows to a considerable size. The thickened membrane is divisible into a blackish exosporium and a colourless endosporium. From this zygospore, which in the case of Mucor is also a resting- spore, there springs, after some weeks of cultivation, a germinal hypha ( C k), which then developes a hypha bearing a sporangium (g).

CHAPTER VIII. NECROSIS. 32. Everything that lives comes sooner or later to an endâ€”it dies. Death makes its appearance so soon as the vital energy of the organism, infused into it when it was first engendered, is exhausted in antagonising external resistances. Besides this death of the organism as a whole, or somatic death, we recognise what we must regard as a localised death; a death, that is to say, of individual cells or cell-groups, which we call necrosis. The occurrence of local death or necrosis in a cell-group or entire organ is only in special cases associated with recognisable changes in structure. The slight histological changes the cells undergo in dying are not always enough to indicate with certainty the exact factor which has caused life to cease. The naked-eye appearances of the larger organs do not always betray the fact that some part of them has become necrosed. Even the cessation of the obvious functions of an organ may leave us in doubt whether, as in necrosis, the cessation is permanent, or whether the functions are merely suppressed for a time. Thus we can only subject necroses to anatomical examination, when death of the tissue involves change in its structure either consequent or antecedent. The latter occurs only to a limited extent: the former (i. e. change consequent on necrosis) on the other hand is invariably found after a longer or shorter interval. The varieties of necrosis are in fact distinguished from each other according to the nature of these consecutive tissue-changes. 33. The injuries which lead to local death are divisible into three groups. The first includes those which destroy the tissue by their mechanical or chemical action. Thus external violence may crush a finger; sulphuric acid may destroy a patch of skin; and fungous parasites may disorganise the structure of a gland in which they are permitted to grow. A second group of injuries may be classed as thermal. If the temperature of a tissue be maintained

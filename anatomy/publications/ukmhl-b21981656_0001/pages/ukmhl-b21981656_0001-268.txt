[SECT. VI. TUMOURS. 248 healing is only local and relative, and it does not last. Microscopic examination shows that the cancerous invasion of the deeper structures still persists. The formation of secondary growths, even after the surface ulceration is scarred over, testifies to the fact that the malignancy of the process is not removed with the removal of the primary growth. 176. Adenoma and carcinoma, may be combined with other neoplastic formations ; that is to say, the stroma may be composed of other than fibrous tissue. In the first place it must be remem- beredâ€”that as cancer invades successive tissues, the most various structures may in turn be utilised to form its stroma. Thus when a uterine cancer reaches the muscular Coats of the organ, we find that the stroma of the tumour contains smooth muscular fibres. When secondary nodtdes form in the liver, we often see liver-cells, atrophied no doubt but still recognisable, in the trabeculae of the stroma. The new-formed tissues which actually originate in the stroma are to be distinguished from such pre-existing formations. In the former case we may find that not only fibrous tissue but even cartilage or sarcomatous tissue has been developed. Such neoplasms are described as complex or mixed tumours. They are most common in the testis and parotid gland. They resemble the simple carcinomata in their general relations.

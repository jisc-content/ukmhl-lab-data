98 RETROGRESSIVE DISTURBANCES OF NUTRITION. [SECT. III. 66. In gout we find deposits of urates, chiefly of urate of sodium, together with carhonates and phosphates. The deposition is apt to occur paroxysmally, especially in the metatarso-phalangeal joint of the great toe, but not infrequently in other joints also. Shining white masses (chalk-stones or tophi) are thus formed in the ligaments and cartilages of the joints, and even in the bones. These may also occur in the arteries, endocardium, skin, and kidneys. The deposit is usually in the form of needle-like crystals (Rindfleisch), or amorphous granules. It is said that the cells are the first to exhibit the deposit, the ground-substance being invaded secondarily (Cornil and Ranvier).

CHAPTER XIX. HYPERPLASIA AND REGENERATION IN PARTICULAR TISSUES. 84. The morphological changes which take place in the hyper- plasia and regeneration of the epithelia are comparatively simple. Epithelium can arise only from epithelium: the several var- ieties even do not usually pass into each other. Eberth's re- searches ( Virch. Arch. vol. 67) have shown that the nuclear trans- formations in epithelial cells during their reproduction are quite analogous to those figured in Flemming's scheme. The disappear- ance of the nucleoli and nuclear membrane, the formation of filaments, of two semi-spindle forms (or as Eberth calls them ' creel-forms'), of star-forms, &c, are all observed in the epithelial cell, within a clear areola of cell-protoplasm. The star-forms likewise, as they move asunder polewards, become transformed into nuclear networks in the midst of the clear intermediate substance of the daughter-nuclei. Arnold describes (Virch. Arch. vol. 78) nuclear figures observed in tumour-cells, which in details seem rather to correspond with Strasburger's version of the pheno- mena. The subdivision of the cell-protoplasm occurs either during the later stages of nucleus-division, or after it is complete. In other cases processes are first thrown out by the subdiricling epithelial cell, and into these daughter-nuclei then migrate. The budded processes become independent cells by separation from the mother-cell. Small losses of lining epithelium are in general replaced quickly by means of regenerative multiplication. Glandular epithelium, like that of the kidney, may also be quickly reproduced when lost, provided only the structure of the basis-tissue (from which the cells derive their sustenance) is not altered or destroyed. Hyperplastic multiplication of epithelial cells is very common, especially in tumours.

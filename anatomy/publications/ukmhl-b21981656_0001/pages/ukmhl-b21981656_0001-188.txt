INFLAMMATION AND INFLAMMATORY GROWTHS. [SECT. V. 168 into a zone of grey or greyish-red translucent tissue, reminding one exactly of granulation-tissue. This grey or greyish-red tissue is found in other parts of the affected organ in the form of larger or smaller patches: these often quite visibly contain small grey or yellowish-white and opaque nodules. Lastly, the affected organ also contains small grey nodules lying in apparently unaltered tissue; and sometimes surrounded by a hyperaemic zone, sometimes not. The grey or greyish-red translucent tissue, whether it surrounds the caseous focus, or forms the base of an ulcer (Fig. 31 h and h^, or occurs in isolated patches, is nothing else but tissue infiltrated with cells; it is granulation-tissue. The grey and the yellow nodules are fresh or 'crude' tubercles generally containing giant- cells (Fig. 30 /), and old already caseated tubercles (Fig. 31 respectively. The grey and yellow isolated or aggregated nodules in the neighbourhood of the larger patches are of the same charac- ter (Fig. 30 g and Fig. 31 i and it). Fig. 31.

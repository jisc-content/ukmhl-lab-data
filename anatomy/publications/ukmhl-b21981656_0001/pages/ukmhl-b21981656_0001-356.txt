330 PARASITES. [SECT. VII. The development of the Cestoda is exhaustively treated in the handsome work of Hein, Die parasitiiren Krankheiten des Mensohen 1882 ; see also Davaixe, Les Cestoides, Diet, ency. sciences me'd. 1874 ; Cobbold, Tapeworms 1874. 241. Taenia solium when fully developed is 2 to 3 metres long. The head (Fig. 105 A) is the size of a small pin-head; it is globular and the suckers project somewhat. The vertex is not uncommonly pigmented and is surrounded with a pretty large rostellum or circlet of some 26 hooks (Fig. 105 B). The hooks are Fig. 105. A Head of TAENIA SOLIUM with eostelluh protbuded. [Carmine staining; mounted in Canada balsam : x 50) B Circlet of hooks magnified [leuckabt). short, broad, and appressed, with a small projection at the root. The head is followed by a filiform neck an inch or so in length. At a certain distance from the head the joints begin to be traceable. The first joints are very short, the more advanced ones are longer (Fig. 106): they then become square, and finally the length is greater than the breadth. About 130 cm. beyond the head the mature segments begin, though the sexual organs have been fully developed in earlier segments. The ripe segments (Fig. 107) are 9—10 mm. long and 6—7 mm. broad: then corners are rounded off. The genital opening lies at the side, somewhat behind the middle. The ovary has seven to ten lateral branches separated by considerable intervals; each branch breaks up into a series of dendritic ramifications. The ovary is filled with eggs. The parenchyma of the body both in ripe and unripe segments is divisible into a peripheral and a central layer. The central layer contains the generative organs and the water-vascular system.

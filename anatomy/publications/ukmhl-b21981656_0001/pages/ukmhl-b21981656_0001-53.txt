CHAPTER III. DOUBLE MONSTROSITIES AND MALFORMATIONS. a. Cleavage affecting the undifferentiated embryo, a. Complete cleavage of the axial structures. 12. Forms in which the development of the segments is equal. (1) Homologous twins; these are produced when the development of the divided rudimental embryos goes on without check or hindrance. Homologous twins are always of the same sex. Each twin is enclosed in its own amnion, though portions of the membranes may disappear where the two are in contact. The placenta is almost always single and common. (2) Thoracopagi. If the two rudimental embryos lie near or in contact with each other, a double monster may result. If portions of the trunk, that is of the thorax or abdomen, are coalescent, the monster is described as Thoracopagus. As the umbilicus and umbilical cord are single and common, the term Omphalopagus is sometimes apj)lied to it. The various forms of this monstrosity are named from the extent to which coalescence is carried. Xiphopagi are those in which the ensiform processes are united by a cartilaginous bridge. The peritoneum passes for some distance into the connecting structure (the well-known Siamese twins were xiphopagi). Sternopagi are xiphopagi with a common thoracic cavity. The sternum may be double or single ; the heart also double or single, in which latter case it is malformed; the alimentary canal is in part common; the liver double, though the two organs are connected by processes of gland-substance. Two of the upper limbs may be coalescent (Thoracopagus tribrachius), or two lower limbs and the pelves (Th. tripus). If the heads as well as the breasts and bellies have coalesced, we have a Prosojyo-thoracojyagus, Gephalo-thoraco- M. 3

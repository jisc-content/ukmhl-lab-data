CHAPTER XVII. THE FORMATION OF CYSTS. 71. A cyst is an excavation bounded by an envelope of fibrous tissue or other more complex structure, and enclosing contents distinguishable from the envelope. According to its mode of origin the inner surface of the envelope may be lined with epithe- lium or with endothelium. Epithelial cysts arise by the dilatation of pre-existing epithelial cavities. The commonest instance of this is the glandular cyst, which ensues upon closure of the gland-duct. The secretion collects behind the obstruction, and the gland dilates to a cyst filled with altered secretion. Cysts of retention, as these are called, are chiefly met with in the uterus, intestine, mamma, kidney, and skin. In the case of ductless organs, like the Graafian follicles and the thyroid, dilatation of the cavities ensues whenever the secretion is morbidly increased. Cysts may also be formed in glandular structures occurring in morbid new growths. Various canals more- over, which are normally clothed with epithelium, may in con- sequence of obstruction and local dilatation develope into epithelial cysts. Such canals are, for example, the bile-duct, congenital cervical fistulae, the vermiform appendix, and the ureter. Endothelial cysts arise primarily by dilatation of pre-existing cavities in the connective tissues, such as bursae, tendon-sheaths, obstructed lymphatics, &c. In other cases they are owing to the collection of fluid in new-formed or false membranes. The contents of these cysts vary with their mode of origin, but consist generally of mere lymph. These might also be described as cysts of retention, in a special sense of the term; they are really exudation-cysts. The cavities which are formed in the substance of a solid organ by softening and disintegration of a defined region are very fre- quently described as cysts. Such cysts occur, for example, in the brain, and they usually contain semi-liquid detritus of the brain-

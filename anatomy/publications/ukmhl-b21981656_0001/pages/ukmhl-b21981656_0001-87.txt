67 CHAP. VIII.] NECROSIS. Coagulative necrosis very often occurs in the course of inflam- matory processes. It is hardly ever quite absent where there has been copious exudation. In such cases it may take one of two forms. Either the effused fluid dissolves up the contained cells and then coagulates (Art. 35 Fig. 1 and Art. 102); or the tissue- cells themselves coagulate, forming homogeneous lumps or fibrous reticulated masses. To give an example, the ordinary stratified Fig. 3. Section through the uvula in diphtheritis faucium. (Aniline staining: x 75) a normal epithelium b normal areolar tissue c necrosed epithelium transformed into a coarse mesh-work d areolar tissue infiltrated with fibrin and leucocytes e blood-vessels / haemorrhage g heaps of micrococci epithelial cells (Fig. 3 a) of the pharynx and soft palate in diph- theritis faucium (diphtheria) solidify into a peculiarly-formed trabecular mesh-work (Fig. 3 c). Similar changes in the epithelium are observed in various cutaneous inflammations, such as small-pox. The aggregations of cells which accumulate in simple inflammation may also solidify into pale hyaline flakes or granular masses. Such solidifications occur, for example, in typhoid infiltration of Peyer's patches and of the lymphatic glands, and in the cellular exudations which fill the pulmonary alveoli in caseous bronchopneumonia. The formation of continuous hyaline masses out of cellular material may be typically seen in diphtheritic desquamation of mucous membranes (Arts. 103 and 425): the entire infiltrated tissue some- times solidifies in this manner. The ground-substance of connective tissue, hyaline membranes, the walls of blood-vessels, &c. are all liable to be transfused with coagulable liquid, and then to coagulate into homogeneous masses. 5â€”2

240 TUMOURS. [SECT. VI. the uterus. It forms soft nodulated tumours which start in the columnar epithelium of the glands. In consequence of active multiplication among the epithelial cells the glands become distended into more or less globular nests (Fig. 66). By mutual compression the cells assume very various forms, retaining their columnar character only at the periphery. Sometimes an unoccupied space or lumen remains at the centre. The cell-nests having thus the appearance of gigantic gland-acini, the tumour has also been described as adeno- carcinoma : we reserve this term for the destructive adenoma described in Art. 169. Glandular cancer of a like kind, with a coarse alveolar stroma, occurs in glands like the kidney and mamma, as well as in mucous membrane. In them it likewise starts in overgrowth and multiplication of the glandular epithelium. The difference between this variety and the last consists simply in the absence of tall columnar epithelial cells among the other constituents. This is due to the fact that the epithelium in which the growth originates is spheroidal rather than columnar. (3) Simple carcinoma is a term often applied to a variety usually originating in glands, and forming rather firm nodulated tumours. In section these have generally a light greyish trans- lucent look. The stroma and the cell-nests are often sharply distinguished from each other by the difference of their colour; Fig. 67. Section fkom a simple carcinoma of the mamma.

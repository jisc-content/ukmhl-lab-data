ix PREFACE. The first part—on General Pathological Anatomy and Pathogenesis—is now published. It is practically com- plete in itself, and on some subjects such as Malforma- tions, Inflammation, Aetiology of tumours, and Bacteria, it gives a fuller account of modern teachings and dis- coveries than has yet appeared in any English manual. The second part—on Special Pathological Anatomy—is in course of publication in Germany. It is hoped that the English version of this part may be ready soon after the German edition is completed. I owe more than I can well express to the kindnes3 of Professor Klein ; he has read through the proof-sheets of this volume, and has sent me many very useful suggestions and criticisms. Without his encouragement, and that of Professor Greenfield, I should not have ventured to undertake the work. I would also gratefully acknowledge the willing help I have received from my friends Professor Cossar Ewart, Dr J. F. Payne, and Dr S. H. Vines; and from one whose loss I shall never cease to feel—Frank Maitland Balfour. The beautiful drawing of tubercle-bacilli, somewhat inadequately represented by Fig. 80, was kindly sent me by Dr Heneage Gibbes, of King's College, London. In the multitude of references given I can hardly hope to have escaped all error. Any corrections or queries which may reach me shall therefore have my grateful attention.

Some of these, chiefly the specific tissues like glandular ejjithelium, muscle, bone, &c, disappear before the advancing growth. Fibrous tissue on the other hand is usually excited to proliferation, and new tissue and blood vessels may thus be formed and converted into cancer-stroma. Now and then other proliferations are set up in the neighbourhood of the tumour: and in this way, for example, new bony growths may be formed. In addition to this peculiar power of invasion, cancer has also in a high degree the power of originating metastases or secondary- growths. The germs which give rise to these metastases are the cancerous epithelial cells, which are carried off to remote places by the blood or lymph. The first development of the secondary nodules starts in these, when they have found a suitable nidus. An epithelial germ may reach the liver, for instance, and become wedged in one of the terminal radicles of the vena portae. If it finds adequate nutriment there, it begins to grow. It subdivides and multiplies, and thus a cell-nest is presently formed (Fig. 72) which distends the capillary vessel, and by compression causes the liver-cells to dwindle and atrophy. By the aid of the fibrous elements of the vessels, which proceed to multiply and so furnish a fibrous stroma and accessory vessels, a secondary nodule Fig. 73. Fig. 72.

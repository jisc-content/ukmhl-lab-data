CHAP. XIV.] HYALINE DEGENERATION OF THE FIBROUS TISSUES. 95 thrombi in lymphatic vessels,—in brief everything that has a hyaline look. This is a mere uncritical agglomeration of things that have nothing in common. We may perhaps be unable to distinguish with certainty the exact chemical and physical processes which lead to the formation of homogeneous masses in the various tissues and liquids; but this does not justify us in affirming that no distinction is at all possible. The case referred to in Art. 59 has great interest, as bearing on the discrimination of hyaline degeneration in fibrous tissues. It shows that hyaline change is near akin to amyloid change ; and that in the former as in the latter an albuminoid may be deposited in the tissues in the form of solid lustrous masses. Whether the hyaline degeneration of the vessel-walls, observed in various conditions, has always the same significance—is as yet an open question. Gull and Sutton (Med. chir. Trans. 1872) have described a 'hyalin- fibrous' degeneration of the blood-vessels in connection with chronic renal disease. Klein (Trans. Path. Soc. 1877) has described and figured hyaline changes in the arterioles in typhoid fever and in scarlatina.

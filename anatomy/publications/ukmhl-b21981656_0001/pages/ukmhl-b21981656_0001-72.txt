CHAPTER VI. ESCAPE OF THE BLOOD FROM THE VESSELS. HAEMORRHAGE. (THROMBOSIS, EMBOLISM, INFARCTION.) 26. Haemorrhage or extravasation implies an escape of blood (with all its constituent elements) out of the vessels into a tissue, or upon a free surface. It may be arterial, venous, capillary, or from all the vessels together, in which latter case it is termed 'parenchymatous.' Such an extravasation into a tissue takes on various appearances according to the quantity of blood which has escaped; and special names are given to some of these. When the quantity is small and forms more or less sharply defined red or brown spots, these are called petechiae or ecchy- moses: when larger and less defined they are sugillations or sanguineous suffusions. If the affected tissue is completely infiltrated by the escaped blood, we speak of it as a haemorrhagic infarct. If the blood forms a tumour or swelling, it is called a haematoma or blood-tumour. Haemorrhage in quantity always causes serious changes in the tissue invaded: not infrequently (as in the brain) the tissue is stretched, torn, and disintegrated. If the bleeding take place from the free surface of an organ, the blood flows away either altogether or into the cavity which is bounded by the free surface. Certain haemorrhages have received names from the localities in which they occur. Thus bleeding from the nasal mucous membrane constitutes epistaxis; vomiting of blood is haema- temesis; bleeding from the lungs gives rise to haemoptoe or haemoptysis; from the uterus to metrorrhagia; from the urinary organs to haematuria. A collection of blood in the uterus is called haematometra, in the pleural cavity haemothorax, in the tunica vaginalis of the testicle haematocele, in the pericardium haemopericardium.

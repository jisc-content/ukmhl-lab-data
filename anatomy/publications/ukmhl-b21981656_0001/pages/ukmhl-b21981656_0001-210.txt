CHAPTER XXV. GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS. 136. In Arts. 79â€”92 under the heading of Hyperplasia and Regeneration we discussed a series of progressive or formative disturbances of nutrition. Some of these were the result of nor- mal development carried to an excessive degree. Others seemed due to the resumption or intensification of processes of growth which had been interrupted or enfeebled. These processes led to the formation of new tissue, which either resembled exactly the matrix-tissue from which it arose, or at least was composed of the same elements. Another mode of tissue-formation was discussed in the last section, under Inflammation. This process, as we saw, gave rise only to a single form of new tissue: it resulted in the development of granulations and fibrous tissue from them. The mode of tissue-formation which leads to the development of a tumour, neoplasm, or new growth in the restricted sense of the term, is not comparable either with hyperplastic proliferation or with inflammation. It differs from the former in this, that the new tissue is not similar to the matrix-tissue but specifically differ- ent from it. A true tumour or neoplasm proper is always composed of tissue differing in type from that out of which it grows. It is distinguished from inflammatory tissue by the great variety of forms it may assume, and by the mode of its genesis. The diversity existing between the neoplasm and the matrix is manifested in two ways. First, the new-formed tissue appears as a more or less sharply bounded and defined mass. Secondly, its texture and structure differ from those of its matrix, and generally to such an extent that the difference is recognisable with the unaided eye; it is of course still more plainly marked under the microscope. These two marks are generally enough to determine the diagnosis of tumour, 'though not invariably. In a whole series of new-formations, it is difficult or even impossible to distinguish

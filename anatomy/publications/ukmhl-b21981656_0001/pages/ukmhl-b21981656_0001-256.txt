236 TUMOURS. [SECT. VI. from these as primary foci, the infiltration of the connective tissues (g f) extends far and wide, beyond the region of the gland-tissue itself. The fibrous bundles are thrust asunder by the multiplying cells, which link themselves into fusiform or rounded masses, or into long ramifying strings and bands. Spreading upwards these invade the corium; single cell-nests may even be found immediately underlying the epidermis (g). Within the substance of the nipple (a) also, we may discover numerous cancerous patches (h) in the fibrous tissue between the galactophorous ducts (d). In the figure we note that the only uninvaded part of the gland is near its edge. Even here however the groups of round-cells scattered through the connective tissue (k) show that the structures are not altogether in their normal condition. To sum up all that we learn from this preparation concerning the extension of the cancer we may say—that the process consists in infiltration of the connective tissue with epithelial cell-nests: that this is accompanied or succeeded by inflammatory or pro- liferous changes in the connective tissue: and that these ulti- mately result in fibrous hyperplasia.

146 INFLAMMATION AND INFLAMMATORY GROWTHS. [SECT. V. 103. We may likewise distinguish certain types of inflamma- tion, according to the way in which the inflamed tissue is affected. (1) Desquamative catarrh. In this form of inflammation, which affects the skin and mucous membranes, the epithelial cells are shed in large numbers and mingle with the secretion. It is also described as epithelial catarrh. Mucous catarrh is a variety of this, distinguished by free mucus-secretion from the surface epithelium, or mucous glands. (2) Necrotic inflammation. This term is applied to cases in which an inflamed tissue dies over an extent that is per- ceptible with the naked eye. The form of necrosis may vary: it may be simple necrosis, gangrene, mummification, caseation, or coagulation (Arts. 32â€”42). A special interest attaches to inflammatory coagulative necrosis or diphtheritic inflammation (Art. 38). In this form, the tissue which has been killed by the injury causing inflammation, or by the inflammation itself, coagulates into large flakes and reticulated masses. This happens, for example, in diphtheritic inflammation of the uvula, where the epithelium and infiltrated subepithelial e Fig. 24. Section of uvula from a case of diphtheria.

The granulating tissue of a wound may in like manner become necrosed, and solidify into diphtheritic denucleated flaky masses. Necrotic inflammation <is of course always' grave. It implies severe injury to the tissue, as well as serious alteration in the vessel-walls.

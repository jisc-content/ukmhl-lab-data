241 CHAP. XXVII.] EPITHELIAL TUMOURS. CARCINOMA. especially when the cells have already undergone partial fatty change, and so look white or yellowish-white and opaque. By scraping the section we can often obtain a fairly abundant milky juice. The tumour has a somewhat coarse fibrous framework (Fig. 67 a), containing alveoli of various sizes and shapes filled with masses of epithelial cells. It particularly affects the mamma, and occurs also in the stomach, pancreas, and kidneys. (4) Medullary (or encephaloid) cancer. When the cells are very abundant and the stroma delicate and scanty, the consistence of the tumour may become remarkably soft and semi-fluid. Such forms occur chiefly in mucous membrane, but also in the ovary, kidney, testis, &c. They are described as medullary or encephaloid cancers. They resemble very much the softer adenomata and sarcomata. An abundant milky cancer-juice may be expressed from the cut surface: it contains numerous cells and free nuclei, with fatty detritus and free oil-globules. (5) Scirrhus, or scirrhous cancer. In this the cell-groups are small and scanty and the stroma coarse and dense. The tumour feels firm or even hard, and looks very much like a dense fibroma. Fig. 68.

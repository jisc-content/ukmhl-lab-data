CHAPTER XIII. AMYLOID DEGENERATION AND AMYLOID CONCRETIONS. 57. Amyloid degeneration is a peculiar degenerative process, which is apt to affect the connective tissues, and is progressive in character. It leads to the deposit of a special albuminoid body (the amyloid substance) in the affected tissues: these therefore increase in bulk and assume under the microscope a peculiar uniform semi-translucent appearance. The affection may occur in any of the organs, but it is specially common in the spleen, liver, kidneys, intestines, and lymphatic glands. When sufficiently intense the morbid change is recognisable with the naked eye; the part looks semi-translucent, so that it is described as 'waxy' or 'lardaceousi.e. like the fat of fried bacon. If the change is confined to scattered patches, as it often is in the spleen, these look like grains of boiled sago or tapioca: hence the name ' sago-spleen'. In other cases, the process affects the spleen- tissue uniformly. The whole organ grows large and firm to the touch; while the section presents the peculiar translucent lardaceous appearance. Like appearances are found in the liver. The kidneys too may undergo considerable increase in size, and present in patches or throughout the lardaceous character, becoming at the same time firmer in consistence. In other cases the translucent patches are so small as not to be readily noticed; the possible presence of amyloid substance is however often indicated by changes of another kind, such as fatty degeneration. In the intestine the degeneration is seldom recognisable without optical or chemical examination. The same is true of the organs that are less liable to the change, such as the heart, the great vessels, the thyroid gland, &c. 58. The amyloid substance so deposited in the tissues in uniform shiny patches exhibits a peculiar reaction with iodine, and with some of the aniline colours.

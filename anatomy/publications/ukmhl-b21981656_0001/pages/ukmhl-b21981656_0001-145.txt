Wherever fibrous tissue, bone-tissue, gland-tissue, or any other is produced in quantity, new blood- vessels must of necessity be developed.. In no other way is it possible to keep the new-formed tissue adequately supplied with nutriment. For this reason new blood-vessels begin to be formed at a very early stage in all new growths, and they must be regarded as the chief factors in the formative process. New blood-vessels are developed out of off-shoots which start from the walls of existing blood-vessels. The first change observed is the formation of a conical sprout or projection on the outer surface of some capillary vessel. From the top of this runs off a fine filament of protoplasm, which gradually lengthens. The granular mass forming the projection increases in size, growing out into an irregular process or off-shoot. This is at first solid; but nuclei soon begin to appear among its granules. Fig. 20. Development of blood-vessels by sprouts and off-shoots. (Frompreparations of inflammatory granulation-tissue.) abed various forms of vascular off-shoots; some solid (b, c), others in process of excavation {a, b, d); some single (a, d), others branched {b, c); some with nuclei (6, c), others -without (a, d). Formative cells from without have at- tached themselves to the off-shoot d.

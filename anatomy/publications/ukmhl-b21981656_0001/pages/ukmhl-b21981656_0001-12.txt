viii PREFACE. surer grasp of Lis subject when it is first presented to him as a uniform and coherent system of doctrine, even though the teacher's statement of it should border on the dogmatic. Once this grasp is gained it is easy for the more advanced student to master and to appreciate other theories and doctrines. I have given in smaller print full references to the literature of each subject discussed, and I have added such indications of its bearing as may prove useful to those who are engaged in pathological research." The present English version was begun a year ago, on the basis of the first German edition. At that time there seemed to be no near prospect of a second German edition. In the first I found a considerable number of details which needed amendment or amplification in order to fit the book for the use of English students. The author very generously admitted my criticisms, and gave me full leave to make such changes as I might think useful. The work was well advanced, when a new edition of the first part was called for in Germany, and presently appeared. It embodied most of the improve- ments we had agreed upon, together with valuable additions. These I ha.ve now made full use of, so that this volume corresponds throughout to the second German edition. The matter in small print has had my special care, and I have verified a very large number of the references. The original contains few allusions to English or French memoirs; I have therefore made it my duty to add full notices of such as throw light on the subjects treated in the text, choosing both original contributions and papers serving as a clue to previous work. This feature, and the careful revision of the main text, will I trust help to make the text-book useful to English workers in Pathology, even though they may be familiar with German.

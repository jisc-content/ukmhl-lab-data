CHAPTER XXIII. IMPERFECT RE-ABSORPTION. FOREIGN SUBSTANCES. 112. The re-absorption of inflammatory exudations is not always so complete as we have hitherto assumed (Art. 104). Though it is true that in most cases even exudations containing numerous corpuscular elements are sooner or later absorbed, still there are limitations to this; or it may be that circumstances arise which directly check or hinder the process. If re-absorption (or briefly resorption) does not ensue, further changes take place in the exudation, whether it be an effusion into a cavity or an infiltration of a tissue. The commonest result is condensation, depending on loss of water and caseation. In purulent effusions, for example, the pus-cells undergo fatty changes (Fig. 26 d,' Gluge's Fig. 26. Pus-cells becoming patty and shrinking (x 400) a pus-cell in solution of common salt h pus-cell treated with acetic acid bx so-called granulation-cell c shrunken pus-cells c1 shrunken and fatty pus-cell d pus-cells that have become fatty and broken up (Gluge's corpuscles) corpuscles'). They then shrink and break up, so that presently all that is left is a mass of small irregular lumps (c and c,), and granular detritus (d3). The watery parts of the exudation being more or less absorbed, these products of disintegration form a creamy or cheesy pulp. Fibrinous effusions may also be transformed into a mass of cheesy detritus. These not infrequently become calcified as time goes on.

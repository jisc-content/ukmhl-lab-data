TRTOHINA. 329 CHAP. XXXII.] with the seminal ducts, in the cloaca. The testis consists of a tube which commences caecally at the tail-end, extends forward to the cellular bodies round the oesophagus, and then bends back to be joined by the seminal ducts. The genital organs of the female (A) consist of a simple ovary, uterus, and vagina: the latter opens at a quarter of the whole length from the head-end. The ovary, like the testis, is a tube commencing posteriorly and passing forwards to join the tubular uterus. The eggs develope into embryos in the uterus, and these are born in the free state. The trichina of muscle (Fig. 96) is a small worm 07 to TO mm. in length: it inhabits the fleshy muscles. It is usually coiled up into a spiral, and lies in a fibrous capsule or cyst, which sometimes also contains calcareous matter. A finely granular substance surrounds the coils of the worm. One capsule may enclose two to five trichinae. Fig. 96. Tbichinae encysted in muscle, showing the capsule and its contents. (From LEUVKART: magnified) 233. The following is the life-history of the trichina. When a piece of muscle containing live encysted trichinae reaches the stomach of a host, human or other, the capsule is dissolved and the trichinae set free. They come to maturity in the intestine in about 2^ days; when they proceed to pair. The birth of embryos begins on the 7th day and continues for some time, it may be for weeks. A single worm may bring forth 1000 to 1300 young. These then migrate from the intestine in search of striated muscle. They do so in various ways. Most of them seem to pass directly through the wall of the intestine, the peritoneal cavity, and the subperitoneal connective tissues. Others gain access to the lymph and blood, and are thus conveyed to remote organs. Once in the muscle they penetrate the primitive bundles, reduce the contents to mere detritus, and in 14 days or so become mature

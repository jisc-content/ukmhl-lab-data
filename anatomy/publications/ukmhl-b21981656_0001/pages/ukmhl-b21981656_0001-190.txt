170 INFLAMMATION AND INFLAMMATORY GROWTHS. [SECT. V. Fig. 32. Tubeeculosis of a lymphatic gland. (Haematoxylin staining: x 150) a large-celled tubercle with giant- d epithelioid cells lying outside the cell (c) tubercles in the adenoid reticu- ftj tubercle with central caseation lum (6) of the gland and giant-cells (cx) e. lymphoid cells 123. The virus which engenders tubercle may be carried out of the lymphatic system into the blood, either from a tuberculous focus in a gland or a tuberculous ulcer in the thoracic duct. It may thus be conveyed to distant organs. This will also happen when the virus passes directly from a tuberculous focus into an artery or vein. The result is an eruption of new tubercles either local or general. When the infection of the blood results in a general eruption of tubercles throughout all the organs or in most of them, the affection is called acute miliary tuberculosis. The various organs are beset more or less densely with minute (miliary) grey or translucent nodules, or here and there with yellowish-white opaque nodules with cheesy centres. This is the case whether the affection extend to several organs or to one, or even to a single arterial territory within an organ. . All these nodules are made up of cells. In their earliest stages they are nothing but little heaps of small round-cells (Fig. 33 b), unquestionably derived from the blood. Many foci maintain this character until they are mature: all the cells do is to multiply. In other cases giant-cells and epithelioid cells (Fig. 32 a) are developed. In these cases as in the others the nodule ultimately becomes caseous. Very seldom does fibrous transformation or resorption occur.

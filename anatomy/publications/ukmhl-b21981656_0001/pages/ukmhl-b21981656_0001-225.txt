When the vascular changes are more closely examined, by isolating the vessels or by making sections of the tumour, it is seen that they depend essentially on localised dilatations of new-formed or pre-existing capillaries (Fig. 41). The dilatations are fusiform, cylindrical, sacculated, or spherical; and these varieties of form Fig. 41. Dilated capillaeies fkom a simple angioma of the beain. (Isolated by removal of the basis-tissue: x 200) are combined in all possible ways. In naevi the dilatations are even more exaggerated than those in the figure. They form wide cavities connected together by normal or but slightly dilated capil- laries. The walls of the capillaries are not perceptibly thicker than the normal: they have thus the appearance of being rather tbin than otherwise. Another form of simple angioma, best described as the hyper- trophic form, is made up of dilated capillaries whose walls are very considerably thickened. The dilatations are not usually so ex- treme as in the former varieties; but the number of vessels is so vast that on section they seem everywhere contiguous, the basis- tissue being as it were thrust out of sight (Fig. 42). The capillary-walls are abnormally thickened and beset with nuclei, resembling somewhat the walls of the arterioles. When the

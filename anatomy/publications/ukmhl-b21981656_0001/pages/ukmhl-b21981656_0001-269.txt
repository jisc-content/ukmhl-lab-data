CHAPTER XXVIII. AETIOLOGY OF TUMOURS. 177. Our knowledge of the aetiology of tumours is still very defective. What we have to say on the subject is, generally speaking, largely hypothetical. We might at first be inclined to regard a tumour as the result of a local overgrowth of tissue, and to look for the conditions of its development among those which determine ordinary hyperplasia. But facts soon appear which tend to show that the processes are not parallel. There is, first, the histological diversity of the tumour (Art. 136) from the matrix in which it grows. Secondly, there is the associated impairment or extinction of the physiological function of the matrix-tissue. These facts do not suggest a mere over-active growth in situ. The anatomical facts are thus against our regarding tumours as localised hyperplasias. It follows that we cannot expect to discover the efficient causes of tumour-growth among the factors which give rise to such hyjoerplasias. Nor can we fairly compare the tumours with the inflammatory new-formations. Tumours may indeed contain foci which are infiltrated with leucocytes. But these are of secondary signifi- cance. The entire process of neoplastic histogenesis shows that it is something quite different from the formative processes which originate in inflammation. We thus exclude at once the possibility of attributing the growth of a tumour to a traumatic lesion, at least in any immediate or direct way. Clinical experience bears this out; for if now and then we have tumours developed in a substratum of tissue which has been injured and has undergone inflammatory change, it is on the whole a rare occurrence, and does not prove that such injury would of itself suffice to set up' tumour-formation in previously healthy tissue. This being the case, we are perforce constrained to admit that other factors must be sought, if we are to explain the genesis of tumours.

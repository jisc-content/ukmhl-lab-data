PARASITES. 334 [SECT. VII. testes lie close behind the posterior disc and in front of the ovary and uterus: the coils of the latter are seen through the transparent FlG. 101. DISTOMA LANCEOLATUM WITH ITS INTERNAL ORGANS. (From LEUCKART: x 100) body-walls. The more anterior coils which are filled with eggs look black, the remaining coils are russet-coloured. The yellowish- white ovaries lie about the middle of the lateral margin. The eggs (Fig. 102) are 004 mm. long. The embryo is visible in them before they have left the uterus, but it only escapes some Fig. 102. Eggs of DISTOMA LANCEOLATUM shortly after the shell is formed. {From LEUCKART: X400) weeks after they are deposited. Its metamorphoses are unknown. This fluke like the other infests the biliary ducts, but it is rarely found in man. It is commonest in sheep and cattle, but as it is usually present in small numbers, it rarely gives rise to any grave disturbances of health. 239. Distoma haematobium or Bilharzia haematobia (Fig. 103) is a species of fluke in which the sexes are distinct. The oral and ventral discs are close to each other, and the fore-end of the body is slender. The sexual orifice in each sex lies just behind the ventral disc. The male is 12—14 mm. long. The body is flattened, but its posterior part is rolled laterally into a kind of tube or gynaecophoric canal (Fig. 103) into which the female is received. The female is 16—19 mm. long and almost cylindrical in form. The eggs are prolate (Fig. 104) and 0'12 mm. long. They are furnished with a spine which may be either terminal or lateral. These worms are found in the branches and main stem of the portal vein, in the splenic vein, in the mesenteric veins, and in the vessels of the rectum and bladder. They feed on the blood, and infest man and the monkey. They are very common in Egypt and

CHAPTER XXIV. THE INFECTIVE GRANULOMATA. General characters. 117. The granulative formations we are about to discuss are all distinguished by similar characters. Their development usually stops short at the fibroblast stage, and having reached it (or even before that) the constructive process gives place to retrogressive changes. Cicatricial development being arrested, the granulation- tissue persists for a time unmodified, and often developes to a considerable amount. For this reason Virchow described the formations as granulative growths or granulomata. All of these growths have furthermore the clinical character of infectiveness. Hence they have been termed infective growths by Klebs and Cohnheim, and specific inflammations by Rindfleisch. Their infective character may be recognised by various signs. Thus they are all locally invasive; i. e. the granulation-tissue spreads centrifugally from a centre into the surrounding structures. At the same time the central (or oldest) part of the new formation usually dies and disintegrates. In many cases the lymphatic system becomes affected, so that secondary granulative foci are formed in it. From the lymphatics the process is at times transferred to the blood; or it may invade the blood-vessels directly. The final result is the spread of the disorder to various organs, or throughout the system. In most of the granulomatous disorders we may have not merely a diffusion of the disease throughout the individual organism, but also a transference of it from one individual to another: the affection is inoculable. If one person be inoculated with the inflammatory products derived from another, he acquires a disease whose course is exactly similar to that of the original one, and which yields identical inflammatory products. This latter character of infectiveness is that by which it is most readily recognised.

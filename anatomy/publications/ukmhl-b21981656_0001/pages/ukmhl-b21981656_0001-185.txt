CHAP. XXIV.] THE INFECTIVE GRANULOMATA. TUBERCLE. 165 axe partly lymphoid, partly larger and like swollen epithelial or endothelial cellsâ€”these are called epithelioid (Fig. 29 b). Giant- cells and epithelioid cells are marked by their coarsely granular Fig. 29. Tubercle from a fun gating granuloma in bone. (Aniline-brown staining: x 250) a giant-cell b epithelioid cells c lymphoid cells protoplasm, and large vesicular oval nuclei with clear nuclear juice and nucleoli. The round or lymphoid cells (c) are finely granular, with a small round nucleus in which the nuclear juice and nuclear substance are not clearly distinguished. These cells lie in a stroma which in many cases exhibits a reticular arrangement. 120. The epithelioid cells and giant-cells have been thought by some to be characteristic of tuberculosis. Many writers have thus come to speak of specific tubercle-cells, and have based the diagnosis of tuberculosis merely on the presence of these larger varieties of cells. This is certainly unjustifiable. Such cells, indeed, are common enough in tuberculous affections, but they are by no means exclusively confined to them. All inflammatory tissue-formation is preceded by a stage in which large cells are developed. It is very easy to generate experimentally in such formations all the various elements found in tubercle, and especially the giant-cells. The constituent cells of tubercle are precisely equivalent to the corresponding cells of granulation-tissue. All the evidence points to the conclusion that tubercles arise in the same way as granulations. The chief materials are derived from the migrated white blood-cells; and the endothelial cells and fixed connective-tissue cells supply only a minor part.

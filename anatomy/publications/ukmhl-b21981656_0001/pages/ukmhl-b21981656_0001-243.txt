These strings are very irregular in form and anastomose in all directions; they give the tumour a very peculiar texture. Its general structure justifies the name of myxosarcoma, which has been applied to it. It forms, as has been said, a subdivision of the class of cylin- dromata. It is not clear, from a histological point of view, in what way the clumps and strings of cells are formed. They seem to have no relation to the ramifications of the vessels, for these are seen to be unchanged, and ran through parts where the fibrous tissue has undergone no degeneration. A third variety of cylindromatous tumour, also somewhat trans- lucent and in part gelatinous, is characterised by the hyaline degeneration which affects the walls of its vessels and the tissue around them. If one of these vessels be isolated, it is seen to be invested with a more or less abundant deposit of hyaline substance (Fig. 57 a). To this sheath are attached similar hyaline appen- dages not traversed by vessels. Outside the hyaline sheaths, alternating with them in fact, are nests and strings of cells which here and there seem fastened or anchored to the hyaline masses (Fig. 57 b). The strings of cells have much the same look as Fig. 57. Blood-vessels with hyaline sheath and appendages from a cylindroma. (From SA TTLER'S ' Cylindroma' 1874: x 200) a small vessel b patch of epithelial-like cells on one of the hyaline appendages those shown in Fig. 56, and we infer that the tumour in question is allied to the myxosarcomata just described. The homogeneous appendages are the result of hyaline degeneration of the vessel-walls, or of the neighbouring tumour-cells; and this hyaline degeneration is either identical or connected with mucoid degeneration.

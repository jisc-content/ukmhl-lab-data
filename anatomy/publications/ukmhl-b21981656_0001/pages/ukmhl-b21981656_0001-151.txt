131 METAPLASIA. CHAP. XX.] The first step in the process is the liquefaction or dissolution of the matrix into a mucous or limpid mass (Fig. 21). The capsules Fig. 21. Metaplasia of cartilage into areolar tissue. (From a case of fungous arthritis; haematoxylin staining: x 400) a hyaline cartilage b tissue made up of branching cells c cartilage-cells, set free by dissolution of the matrix, becoming converted into connective-tissue corpuscles also dissolve away and the cartilage-cells are set free (c). These change their form (6), becoming spindle-shaped or branching ; and they then cohere into a cellular reticulum such as is met with in mucous tissue. The matrix-substance does not always become true mucus; it may pass into a liquid of different composition. Such changes are met with in the cartilages of diseased joints. The areolar tissue may subsequently become filled with marrow-cells or with simple fat; in the last case the tissue is transformed into mere adipose tissue (e. g. in rheumatic polyarthritis). Cartilage also changes very readily into osseous tissue. Part of it becomes transformed into bony trabeculae, part into medullary tissue. The latter is effected through the intermediate stage of areolar tissue : the former by the deposition of calcareous salts in the matrix, itself simultaneously undergoing change into gelatin; while the cartilage-cells pass into osteoblasts and bone-corpuscles. It often happens that the cartilage-cells proliferate abundantly during this process; it is not then strictly speaking a pure metaplasia. Fibrous tissue, like cartilage, may also be transformed into mucoid tissue and bone. The changes in this case are similar to those described in the other. The fibres and fibrillae disappear as the tissue becomes mucoid tissue : when it becomes bone, calcareous salts are deposited in the ground-substance. Here too cell-multi- plication is not uncommon. 9â€”2

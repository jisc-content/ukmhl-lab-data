PARASITES. [SECT. VII. sio We owe most of the details of our knowledge on this part of the subject to Brefeld (Botan. Untersuch. iiber tichimmelpilze Leipzig 1874â€”77): the fore- going account is taken from him. The mycelium of Phycomyces in the figure taken from Sachs agrees generally with that of Mucor; in the latter however only a single conidia-bearing hypha is developed. 216. The life-history of Eurotium Aspergillus {Aspergillus glaucus) and Eurotium repens is somewhat different. These two fungi are found on various substances, but chiefly upon cooked fruit. The}' form a finely filamentous jointed mycelium (Fig. 83 A), from which rise a great number of aerial hyphae or conidiophores (c). These end in a spherical knob, from the upper part of which sprout numerous densely-packed radial peg-shaped protuberances or sterigmata (si). Each sterigma gradually developes a long chain Pig. 83.

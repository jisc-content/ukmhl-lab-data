235 (HAP. XXVII.] EPITH \'AA A I, TUMOURS. CARCINOMA. in the glands of the uterus, we have cancer commencing with active growth and multiplication of the cylindrical epithelial cells. The single layer of cylindrical cells is transformed into a series of stratified or disorderly masses of epithelium (Fig. 63) piled upon Fig. 63. Section fkom a cancer of the uterine glands. (Haematoxylin staining: x 250) a stroma b cancerous ingrowths or loculi c isolated cancer-cells each other. The size of the gland (b) is thus considerably increased, and soon its typical structure is overlaid and lost by the substitution of great cell-masses and cancerous cell-nests or loculi. The cells retain their cylindrical form only at the borders of these groups. This represents the first stage. In the second, the surrounding tissue is invaded and infiltrated by cancerous cell-nests. A section from the advancing margin of a mammary cancer (Fig. 64) shows at one view the various steps of the process; a low magnification is all that is necessary. The first stages in the formation of the mammary cancer are essentially the same as those observed in uterine cancer, though the peculiarities of the matrix bring about certain minor variations. The primary aberra- tion is an excessive multiplication of the glandular epithelium. This is followed by general epithelial infiltration. The small and scattered acini of the mamma are replaced by cancerous cell-nests of various form and size (e), imbedded in a scanty stroma. Starting

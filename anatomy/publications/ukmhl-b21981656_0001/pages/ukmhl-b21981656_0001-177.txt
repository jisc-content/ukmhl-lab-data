OH. XXIII.] IMPERFECT RE-ABSORPTION. FOREIGN SUBSTANCES. 157 Most of the pulverulent or corpuscular matters referred to are removed from the tissue containing them by resorption. If they lie within a liquid exudation (as do fatty pus-cells or free oil- globules) they may be taken up along with it into the lymphatics, and so carried off. A large number of them would still however remain, if another means were not at hand for disposing of them. The additional resource is brought into play by the mild inflam- mation which the foreign substance excites. The agents are the white blood-cells which thereupon migrate from the blood-vessels. These migratory cells appropriate the foreign substances lying in the tissue (Fig. 27 h \ h2 hs). They let their protoplasm flow Fig. 27. Section through a degenerating patch from the brain.

By frequent repetition of this process granule-carrying cells are produced. Ac- cording to their contents, these have been variously described as fat-granule carriers (/t2), blood-cell, carriers (/i8), pigment-granule cells (Fig. 28 c), dust-cells, cinnabar-carrying spherules, &c. In cerebral degenerations, we constantly find cells containing granules

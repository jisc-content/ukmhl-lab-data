243 CHAP. XXVII.] EPITHELIAL TUMOURS. CARCINOMA. It begins with the formation of clear globules in their interior (d). The cells then perish, and the globules coalesce with each other and with larger gelatinous lumps already formed. In this way a large homogeneous colloid mass is ultimately built up. It is not uncommon for all the cells over a wide area to perish in this manner, so that the stroma is the only formed constituent remaining. In other spots, cell-groups may still be found encircled by colloid masses (Fig. 69 b): in others again there is no colloid substance at all. (7) Carcinoma myxomatodes. A cancerous tumour may likewise assume a gelatinous texture in consequence of mucoid change affecting the stroma (Fig. 70). With this metaplasia of the fibrous tissue there may also be associated a mucoid degeneration of the cancer-cells (Fig. 70 d): and this may increase considerably the transparent and gelatinous appearance of the growth. The connective-tissue cells of the stroma may also Fig. 70. Carcinoma myxomatodes of the stomach.

The favourite seats of this variety are the same as those of colloid cancer. (8) Cylindroma carcinomatodes is a very rare variety of cancer, characterised by the formation of homogeneous spherules within the cell-nests (Fig. 71). These spherules, which are possibly to be regarded as masses of colloid substance, press asunder the other cells of the group (Fig. 71 6). If a considerable number of spherules form within the same 10â€”2

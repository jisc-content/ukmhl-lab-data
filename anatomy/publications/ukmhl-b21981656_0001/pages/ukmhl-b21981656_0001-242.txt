TUMOURS. 222 [SECT. VI. translucent appearance than usual, and yield on section a turbid slimy juice. These have already begun to undergo mucoid change, as may be recognised by the swollen ap- pearance of the cells, and the for- mation of drops of liquid within them. When the tissue has been hardened the change is not so easily made out. The cells then seem shrunken (Fig. 55 6), and separated from the stroma (a) by a clear zone. Sometimes a few distended and transparent nuclei are observed, their protoplasm having become mucoid and so vanished. This mucoid change may at times extend throughout the entire sub- stance of the tumour; or it may be confined to scattered patches, sepa- rated by unchanged cells. Isolated hyaline spherules are occasionally noticed among the cells. Such par- tially degenerate sarcomata we may describe as myxomatodes. The tumours in which sarcomatous and mucous tissue are found combined have on section either a hyaline or an opaque dirty white appearance. The mucous tissue is partly composed of a net- work of ramified and anastomosing cells (Fig. 56 a), in addition Fig. 55. Sabcoma myxomatodes.

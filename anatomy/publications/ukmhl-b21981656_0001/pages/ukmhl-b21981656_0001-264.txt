To distinguish it from the sarcomatous kind (Art. 163), it has been called carcinomatodes. (9) Giant-celled (or myeloid) cancer is a form in which some of the cancer-cells attain an inordinate size. All parts of the cell—protoplasm, nucleus and nucleolar corpuscles—contribute to this enlargement. They become at the same time remarkably transparent, and the general aspect is much as if the cell had imbibed a great quantity of water, and had in consequence swollen out enormously. (10) Melanocarcinoma is a sufficiently distinct variety to deserve mention. It gives rise to grey, brown, or black tumours. The pigment is contained partly in the cancer-cells, partly in the stroma. It is seldom met with; being much rarer than melanotic sarcoma. Eeferences :—Waldeyer, Virch. Arch. vol. 55; Eindfleisch, Path. Histo- logy vol. I; Lucke, Art. Geschwiilste in Hand. d. Chirurgie v.

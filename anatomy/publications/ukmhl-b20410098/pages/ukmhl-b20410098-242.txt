216 THE SKELETON. Further forwards, on each side, there is a projection inwards of the sur- face continuous with the internal pterygoid plate : it is called the vaginal process, and articulates edge to edge with the vomer, while it is partially covered in by the sphenoidal process of the palatal bone, and has on it a groove, completed anteriorly by the palatal into the pterygo-palatine canal, a small passage containing the pharyngeal branch of Meckel's ganglion. Extending from between the vaginal processes, the fore part of the body projects forwards as a narrowing mesial keel, the rostrum, covered by the vomer, and on each side is a triangular plate with its apex pointing backwards. This is the portion of the sphenoidal turbinated bones termed triangular bone of Berlin, and curves upwards in front so as to look forwards and wall-in the sphenoidal sinus, leaving an aperture by which the sinus opens into the upper and back part of the nasal fossa. Between the two sphenoidal sinuses the body is reduced to a thin septum sphenoidale; and in front this thin plate has to be broken separate from the central plate of the ethmoid, and is named sphenoidal crest. The sphenoidal turbinated bones are, however, structures which reach the perfection of their development in childhood, and consist at that time of four distinct ossicles, of which the largest is the bone described by Bertin, while an upper and outer and an upper and inner plate complete in early years the walls of the sphenoidal sinuses, but become soon absorbed. The fourth ossicle is a constant orbital element, which may become adherent c to either the sphenoid, the os planum of the Fig. 203. —The vomkr, Ethmoid, ethmoid, or the Orbital process of the palatal, Sphenoidal Spongy Bones, AND Left , n p ,i it i , Palate and Maxillary Bones, from Or tO all 01 theSe, and alwayS Completes With THE Skull of an Infant.

In the lower animals, the sphenoidal turbinates being absent, the spheno-palatine foramen is completed by the ethmoid, and is ethmo-palatine. The orbital, anterior or small alae or wings spread out horizontally from where they meet in the middle line in front of the body. At this point there is usually a slight projection forwards, the ethmoidal spine, and the whole anterior border is serrated, articulating in the middle with the ethmoid, and further out with the orbital plate of the frontal. The pos- terior border, smooth and free, separates the anterior from the middle fossa ^ See Cleland on "Vomer, Ethmoid and Submaxillary Bones" {Philosoj^hical Trans- actions, 1862).

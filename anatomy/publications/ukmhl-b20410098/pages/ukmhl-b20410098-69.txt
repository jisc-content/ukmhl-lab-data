MUSCLE. 45 fibres of uniform breadth, are netted, each fibre giving and receiving divisions of smaller breadth which unite them with other fibres. They also present transverse marks, like partitions, dividing them into short lengths, in each of which may be seen a nucleus embedded in the contractile B Fig. 41.—A, Muscular fibres of heart; B, branched muscular fibre from tongue. substance. On account of the transverse partitions the cardiac fibres are generally said to consist of chains of corpuscles with one nucleus each, but the component fibrillae are continuous through the partitions, and the partitions in many preparations are not seen. They appear to me to be separable by means of carbolic acid, and I regard them as interrupted portions of sheath, a ruptured sarcolemma. Development of striped muscle. In the embryo, the corpuscles to be developed into muscle have the nucleus enlarged and then elongated, and become fusiform. Long fibres of uniform breadth are subsequently seen, with the i nuclei at intervals in their interior. In : ; < opposition to the views of earlier observers, who considered that these were formed by / coalescence of cells, it has more recently 1 ^ been taught that they are produced by 1 ' elongation of the fusiform corpuscles and v. multiplication of their nuclei. But in the * , human subject both processes appear to ."^^ P occur; for the band between the nuclei is ^ ' at first long and narrow, and afterwards when the fibres are of uniform breadth, division of nuclei may be seen taking place within them. Fibrillated substance appears first always at the periphery of the fibres, sometimes at one side; and transverse striation of the fibrillae can be detected from the first in them. The appearance of a sarcolemma also sets in very early. The fibres of the young embryo are a d Fig. 42.—Striped Fibres in Process of Development, a, b, c, From human em- bryo inch long; d, from foetus of 5th month.

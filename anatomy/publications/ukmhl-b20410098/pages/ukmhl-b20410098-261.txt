The whole surface of the ramus, including the coronoid process, gives attachment to the masseter muscle; and it is marked by it most strongly in its lower part, which, with the lower border in front of the angle, is ridged and prominent where the tendinous parts of the insertion are attached. The deep surface presents, near the symphysis, inside the lower border, a rough depression to which the anterior belly of the digastric muscle is attached; and close to the symphysis, higher up, are two little spines, one immediately above the other, the lower giving origin to the Coronoid process Left condyle I I Mylohyoid ridge I I Depression of submaxillarj^ gland Depression of sublingual gland For genioglossus For digastric For geniohyoid Fig. 218.â€”Lower Jaw, from left side and below. geniohyoid muscle, and the upper to the genioglossus. From belo^^^ these spines the prominent internal oblique line or mylohyoid ridge passes- obliquely backwards and upwards, giving origin for some distance back to the mylohyoid muscle, and at its back part to some fibres of the- superior constrictor of the pharynx, while it separates the depression for the sublingual gland above and in front of it from that for the- submaxillary gland below and behind it. About the middle of the ramus; is the inferior dental foramen leading into the dental canal and lodging the inferior dental nerve and vessels. Its inner margin is sharp with an upward projection, the lingula, giving attachment to the internal lateral ligament; and behind this is the commencement of the mylohyoid groove for the mylohyoid branches of the inferior dental nerve and vessels. On the inner side of the angle, and above it, there is a strongly marked

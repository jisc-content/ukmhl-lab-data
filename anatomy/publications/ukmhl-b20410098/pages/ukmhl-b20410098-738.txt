Sometimes portions j of this prolongation are completely detached. Other little detached accessory ' cartilages occur between the alar and the septal cartilage. The greater j part of the ala of the nose contains no cartilage. The nasal fossae, so far as their extent and the form of their walls ^ are concerned, require no further description than has been already given 1 at p. 238; for they are lined in their whole extent with mucous membrane j closely adherent to the periosteum and extending round the cavities of | all the various air-sinuses. This used to be called the pituitary or the j ScJmeiderian membrane. It is thick and spongy over the turbinations of | the ethmoid {superior and middle concha) and on the septum nasi, still j more so on the inferior turbinated bones {inferior concha), but comparatively | thin and firm on the floor and other boundaries, and reduced to tenuity | within the air-sinuses. It is divisible into three districts, namely, the j vestibule and the respiratory and olfactory tracts. I Middle Inferior Fig. 471.â€”Outer Wall of Right Nasal Fossa. The vestibule is the part in front, where the cavity is roofed in by the nasal cartilages, and is lined with stratified squamous epithelium. Close to the apertures of the nostrils it presents large sebaceous glands and hairs projecting into the passage. The respiratory tract includes the whole nasal fossa, with the exception of the olfactory tract to be described over the vestibule. It has stratified cihated columnar epithelium, as have also the air-sinuses, and is studded over with the racemose glands. It abounds in lymphoid tissue more or less diffuse, and in leucocytes which make their way even to the surface. The part in front of the inferior turbinated bone and inferior turbination of the ethmoid is called the agger nasi

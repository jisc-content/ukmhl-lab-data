The outer surface forms the inner wall of the axilla, and upon it lies the nerve of supply—the posterior thoracic branch of the brachial plexus. The pectoralis major arises by short tendinous fibres from the anterior surface of the sternum, the cartilages of the first six or seven ribs, and , . , ,^ . ■, Pectoralis major Space between pectoralis major and deltoid , Fig 231.—Superficial Pectoral Region.

It is inserted by a strong folded tendon into the outer or anterior lip of the bicipital groove of the humerus. The muscular fibres converge as they pass outwards, and in crossing the axilla those of the pectoral part are folded upwards behind the others to such an extent that the posterior lamina of the tendon reaches a little higher on the bone than the anterior.

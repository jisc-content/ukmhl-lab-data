650 ORGANS OF SPECIAL SENSE. which pierce the sclerotic opposite the ciliary muscle and enter the cornea at a little distance from the surface, to form in it at that depth an open meshwork, the primary plexus. From this plexus numerous fine branches pass toward the surface and form a subepithelial plexus on the anterior elastic lamina, whence minute fibres extend to form an intra-epithelial plexus, and end in free and dilated extremities close to the surface. There are no vessels in the cornea; the conjunctival capillaries cease after overlapping its border, as already described (p. 645).

The choroid is essentially a vascular membrane, and has the peculiarity that its arteries and veins are spread out in a membranous sheet, and are connected by means of the smallest order of branches with a membranous sheet of capillaries underneath them. The arteries are the short ciliary branches, about twenty in number, of the ophthalmic artery, and, piercing the sclerotic at the back, divide within the membrane; the divisions running directly forwards alongside one of another with narrow intervals between, so that the choroid tears easily in a longitudinal direction. They extend forwards into the ciliary processes, and communicate with the anterior ciliary arteries. The veins, venae vorticosae, lie on the sclerotic aspect of the arteries, inseparably united to them, and form a close net- work ending abruptly in front, opposite the ora serrata of the retina, a little outside the bases of the ciliary processes. They converge to four or five points round the widest part of the globe, and from each of these a

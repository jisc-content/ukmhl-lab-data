493 THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE VEINS. veins which are later of being formed. Between the primitive jugular veins of opposite sides, below the place of entry of the subclavian and internal jugular veins, there appears a transverse connecting branch. This transverse branch becomes the left innominate vein. The portion of the right primitive jugular on the distal side of the junction becomes the right innominate, the portion on the cardiac side and the right duct of Cuvier becomes the superior vena cava. Concomitantly with Left innominate Internal jugular Internal jugular Right external jugular (primitive jugular) Left external jiigular (primitive jugular) Right subclavian Right cardinal vein (great azygos vein) Right duct of Cuvier (superior vena cava) Right renal vein Right spermatic Lumbar vein Right external iliac Left subclavian Left duct of Cuvier Coronary sinus j Left cardinal vein ( (left superior intercostal) Inferior vena cava f Left cardinal vein ) (smaller azygos) Left renal vein Left spermatic Left external iliac Left internal iliac Right internal iliac Fig. 369.â€”Diagram to Illustrate the Development of the Systemic Veins. The original veins which become permanent are represented in black. The portions which disappear are shown in outline. The veins which are developed later are shaded. The portions which remain as impervious cords are dotted. (After Hochstetter.) (J. Y. M.) the development of the left innominate vein, which carries the blood of the left side to the right duct of Cuvier, the left duct of Cuvier undergoes atrophy; its basal portion however remains as the coronary sinus and the oblique vein of the heart, and the remainder of it is represented partly by the delicate fibrous cord which lies in the vestigial fold of JVIarshall, and, probably, in part by the uppermost portion of the left superior intercostal vein.

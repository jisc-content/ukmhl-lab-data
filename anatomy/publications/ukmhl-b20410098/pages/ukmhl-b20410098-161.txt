THE SCAPULA. 135 The upper border is the shortest, and springing from its outer part is the coracoid process, internal to which is the suprascapular notch converted by a ligamentous or sometimes a bony band into a foramen transmitting the suprascapular nerve, while the remainder of this border is a thin edge directed upwards as well as inwards, giving attachment to the omo-hyoid muscle. The vertebral border, the base, is the longest, and divisible into three parts, a short part opposite the spine, with a second part above, and a third ^ and longer part below, both inclining outwards as they recede from the first. The uppermost part gives attachment to the levator anguli scapulae muscle, the short middle part to the rhomboideus minor, and the lowest part to the rhomboideus major. The axillary border is at the side of a stout bar descending from below the articular head; at its upper part it presents a well marked rough- ness about an inch long, where the long head of the triceps muscle is attached, and below this if ie ncnall-iT- Tnarlrprl \\\t FiG- 140.—Right Scapula from Behind.

The anterior surface or venter scapidae is for the greater part slightly hollowed to form the subscapular fossa, from which, as well as from the stout bar outside, as far as the axillary border, the subscapularis muscle takes origin, for the most part fleshily, but with tendons within it indicated by converging ridges. In front of the upper and lower angles are two small flat surfaces beyond the subscapular fossa, which, together with a narrow line running between them in front of the base, give attachment to the serratus magnus muscle. On the posterior surface or dorsum scapulae, above the spine, is the supraspinous fossa, filled by the supraspinatus muscle ; while, below the spine the infraspinatus muscle occupies the greatest space, arising from what is properly called the infraspinous fossa; while external to it, on the thick bar at the axillary margin, is an elongated area with distinct

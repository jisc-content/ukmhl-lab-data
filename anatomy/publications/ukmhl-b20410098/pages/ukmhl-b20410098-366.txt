340 THE MUSCLES. is the name given to an occasional muscle passing from the styloid process either to the great or small cornu of the hyoid bone. Nerves. The stylo-hyoid and the posterior belly of the digastric are supplied by the seventh nerve, the mylo-hyoid and the anterior belly of the digastric by a branch from the inferior maxillary division of the fifth. The genio-hyoid receives its supply from the twelfth or hypoglossal nerve. Actions. The muscles act both on the hyoid bone and tbe lower jaw. When the jaw is fixed the hyoid bone, and with it the larynx, is drawn upwards by the digastric, upwards and forwards by the mylo-hyoid and geniohyoid, and upwards and backwards by the stylo-hyoid. The hyoid bone is drawn upwards in the action of swallowing. The mylo-hyoid in contracting raises the floor of the mouth and pushes the tongue up- wards. The digastric depresses the lower jaw and opens the mouth. The stylo-glossus, a narrow band, springs from the styloid process near its extremity, and from the stylo-hyoid ligament. It passes forwards and downwards, and is applied to the lower surface of the tongue at its border, its fibres becoming blended with those of the hyo-glossus and of the intrinsic muscles. The hyo-glossus, thin and four-sided, springs from the upper border of the lateral part of the body, and from the great cornu of the hyoid bone. It passes upwards to the under surface of the posterior part of the tongue at its border, where its fibres, along with those of the , stylo-hyoid - Hyo-glossus / Stylo-glossus 1^^^™^"* ; Mylo-hyoid Stylo-pharyngeus Genio-hyoid Fig. 274.—The Extrinsic Muscles of the Tongue. stylo-glossus, to the inner side of which they are at first placed, become interlaced with those of the intrinsic muscles. A small muscular slip (chondro-glossus) occasionally arises from the smaller cornu, and passes on the surface of the hyo-glossus to the tongue. An accessory slip sometimes springs from the thyro-hyoid ligament.

695 THE TEETH. its appearance to small spaces, often communicating one with another and with the tubules, and sometimes taking the form of interstices between aggregated globules of matrix, the globules varying in size but averaging about o^oVo^^^ ^^^^ diameter. On this account they have been described as inter globular spaces. But these are not to be confounded with much larger spaces of similar interglobular appearance arranged in conical sheets, so as to form concentric lines in horizontal sections, particularly of the crown.i The latter are bounded by much larger lobes and neither communicate with the tubules nor affect their course, and though less densely mineralized than the rest of the matrix, are so filled up that they cease to exist in decalcified sections. Some of the concentric lines show A B Fig. 527.â€”Sections of Human Tooth.

(Toldt.) this deficient mineralization in less definitely bounded patches, while yet others are caused by a finely granular disposition of mineralized particles, and such granular lines are the rule in some non-mammalian teeth. Separate small globules of mineralization occur close to the pulp, both in old teeth and in the first commencement of dentine in development. In decalcified dentine, lamination and fibrillation, similar to what occurs in bone, has been noticed (Sharpey). Enamel is much the hardest texture in the body. Different analyses have yielded from 2 per cent, to 3| per cent, organic matter; while the remainder consists of mineral salts, principally phosphate of lime. It ^ These are the contour lines of Owen, the incremental lines of Salter. The only objection to the first name is that they approach the surface at their extremities. It is perfectly certain that they have nothing to do with increment of any sort.

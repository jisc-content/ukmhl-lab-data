592 THE BRAIN. expansion, the thalamencejyhaloyi, presenting dorsally a pair of bodies, the optic thalami, covered, like the corpora quadrigemina, with pia mater, and joined by a thin roof in the middle line, but with a larger space between them, and ultimately with the nervous roof thrown open. From the front of the thalamencephalon a pair of hollow outgrowths, also covered with pia mater, grow and expand so as to extend backwards and outwards and inwards over both optic thalami and corpora quadrigemina. These are the hemisphere-vesicles, their cavities are the future lateral ventricles, and they present each, projecting into the cavity from the floor close to the thalamen- cephalon, a solid part which constitutes the corpus striatum. At an early date the nervous walls of the hemisphere-vesicles become grooved and Fig. 430.â€”Brain from above, showing the two hemispheres. On the right the fissure of Rolando is marked, and on the left the principal convolutions. imperfect close to the lines from which the roofs of the vesicles turn back over the optic thalami, and the pia mater at this part, reflected on itself, projects a hypervascular fringe, a chmvid plexus, into the interior, extending from side to side of what is called the transverse fissure of the brain. Even in the adult, as pointed out by Reichert, a section can easily be made, dividing the optic thalami from the corpora striata, and passing closely in front of the optic tracts, and thereby separating the comparatively simple root of the brain from the hemisphere-vesicles, which owe their complexity to their magnitude, the convolution of their pia-matral surface, the forma- tion of commissures crossing the mesial plane, and the unequal thickening of their walls.

594 THE BRAIN. and the optic tracts there is left a rhomboid space. In the posterior angle of this space, between the crura and in front of the pons, there is a depression where a number of small arteries, placed closely together, enter the cerebral substance, the j)osterior perforated spot. In front of this a pair of rounded white elevations like small peas lie together, the coipwa albicantia, structures connected with the fornix ; and in front of them the rhomboid space is filled by the tuber cinereum, a thin grey lamina whose deep surface looks into the third ventricle. The tuber cinereum is attached to the corpora albicantia, the inner edges of the optic tracts and the posterior edge of the optic commissure, and is prolonged into a hollow projection, infomdibulmn, which narrows rapidly, and is continuous by its slender j extremity with the solid structure, pituitary body, occupying the sella j turcica. i Fig. 43].â€”Basal View of Root of Brain after removal of hemispheres by a cut separating optic thalami from corpora striata, and passing along the anterior borders of the optic tracts. The lower border of the pons is slightly pressed upwards to show the descent of the fibres of the anterior pyramid and sixth nerve. From the anterior border of the optic commissure there passes upwards another grey membrane, lamina cinerea (Fig. 446). When the anterior lobes of the hemispheres are separated from below, the fore part of the corpus callosum is brought into view, bending round from above, and prolonged back nearly as far as the front of the optic commissure, but at a higher level; and there it comes to an edge continued on each side into a cms

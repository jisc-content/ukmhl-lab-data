THE MOUTH. 7O5 and Schwalbe (1867), easily studied in the foliate papillae of the rabbit and in other mammals. They were at first supposed to be confined in the human subject to the sides of the circumvallate papillae, but have since been found not only in the opposed surfaces of the valla surrounding these, but also scattered on the tongue, especially in the fimbria, and on the A B Fig. 536.—Taste-Buds from foliate papillae of rabbit. A, Papillae with taste-buds on their sides ; B, separated structures ; a, under surface of horny epithelium with three perforated hemispherical impressions corresponding with summits of taste-buds ; b, b, isolated taste-buds ; c, form of nucleated corpuscle found in taste-buds. under surface of the velum palati and on the epiglottis. They are pointed domes occupying the whole depth of the epidermis. They are composed of elongated nucleated corpuscles with their bases on the corium, and therefore to be considered as modifications of the deepest or perpendicular Fig. 537.—Section of an Ixjected Tonsil, a, a, Mucous membrane of fauces; b, a recess ; c, c, c, closed follicles. corpuscles of the cuticle; and their tips occupy openings left in the superficial scaly layers. The circumferent or cortical corpuscles are flattened like staves of a barrel, but pointed at the ends; the central corpuscles are narrow and rounded, with a swelHng in the middle caused by the nucleus, a short wire-like extremity projecting at the tip, and with the deep extremity prolonged into continuity with a nerve-fibre. 2 Y

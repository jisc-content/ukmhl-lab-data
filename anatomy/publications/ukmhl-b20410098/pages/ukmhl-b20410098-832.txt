THE DIGESTIVE OEGANS. 734 closely, are seen to constitute a continuous mass filling up the whole space left between the blood-capillaries, which form a very regular network with meshes elongated in a radiating direction, so that the whole lobule may be looked on as consisting mainly of two networks interlaced, the one vascular, the other cellular. Both the capillary and the cellular network are con- tinuous from one lobule to another, and, where the lobules meet, the radiating arrangement is lost. There are mammals, especially the pigs, camels, and giraffe, which have the lobules distinctly separated by connective tissue, but in most animals they are not so separated ; and in the human subject the connective tissue is so slight as to have been till recently somewhat overlooked. There is, however, both in the adult and the infant, a distinct set of isolated bands with netted branches uniting the tunica adventitia of the intralobular vein with the ultimate branches of Glisson's capsule and other fibres coursing between the lobules. An abundance of minute leucocytes or lymphoid corpuscles may be found in scattered groups, and stellate corpuscles have been described. Within the lobules there remains to be described a network of intercellular i ducts or canals. Fig. 568.—Hepatic Tissue Highly Magnified.

(Bohm and v. Davidoff.) | The ducts. Within the lobules there cease to be found any ducts lined with epithelium. The finest interlobular duds have simple membranous walls lined with flattened cells which at the periphery of the lobules come into direct contact with the hepatic cells. But in the interior of the lobes there is a network of minute intercellular canals much finer than the capillary j vessels, channelling the opposed surfaces of the hepatic cells, and only very j

583 SPINAL CORD. of the spinal cord. The canal is invisible to the naked eye in the unprepared human subject, and just visible in hardened sections; but is a structure of much morphological signiiicance, inasmuch as the spinal cord in its earliest embryonic condition was a grooved superficial ribbon whose sides were folded backwards so as to complete a tube which persists in this form, A B CD Fig. 420.—Sections of Spinal Cord. 'A, Mid-cervical; B, mid-thoracic; C, mid- lumbar ; D, near the pointed extremity. Below, in the middle of each, is the open anterior fissure ; above is seen the posterior fissiire, and on each side of it, in A and B, a septum which lies between the columns of Burdach and GoU. and of whose walls the spinal cord is the developed condition. The central canal is continued above into the medulla oblongata to open into the calamus scriptorius, the mesial groove of the floor of the fourth ventricle; and it is prolonged down a long way into the filum terminale, which is thus, at least in its upper part, a continuation of the cord without develop- FiG. 421.—Ependymal or Sponoioblastic Fibres of the Cord of a Seven Days' Chick. Golgi method, (v. KoUiker.) ment of nervous elements. The central canal is lined with elongated columnar ciliated epithelium, whose cells exhibit by the Golgi method a continuity with spongioblastic or neuroglial elements. The grey commis- sure is prolonged on each side into an expanded mass of grey matter, prolonged forwards and backwards so as to form what are called the anterior and posterior cornua, the anterior cornu clavately expanded and giving off the anterior roots of nerves, while the posterior cornu is con-

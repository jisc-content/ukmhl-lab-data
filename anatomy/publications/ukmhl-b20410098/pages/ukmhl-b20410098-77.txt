53 NERVOUS ELEMENTS. It is in harmony with the doctrine of the independent unity of nerve- corpuscles, that when nerves are cut across in the living animal the ends separated from their centres of origin undergo granular degeneration. This is called AValler's law, and affords a valuable means of tracking the continuity of fibres in the cerebro-spinal axis, and of determining, according as the degeneration is ascending or descending, the direction in which nerve- corpuscles of origin are to be sought. Both the spinal and the sympathetic ganglia differ from the brain and spinal cord in having, like the distributed nerves, abundance of white Conditions of degeneration—the first fibre from Fui. 51.—Ganglion from Gall-Bladdek of Dog, the rabbit, the second and third from the frog; with fine nerve-fibres ending in it. c^, ft, Non-medul- Rg, conditions of regeneration, from the rat. lated fibres ; b, a meduUated fibre.

In the larger ganglia, the primitive sheath of the nerve-fibre is continued round each nerve-corpuscle, and in connection with the sheath there is a layer of flattened nucleated corpuscles enveloj^ing each. In all the separate sympathetic ganglia, as distinguished from isolated nerve-corpuscles in ultimate diffuse plexuses, the corpuscles are made out to be multipolar with one axis-cylinder process, which at its far extremity ends in an arborization.

28 GENERAL ANATOMY. closely surrounding the bloodvessels and thereby completing the Haversian canals. In adolesence the alternations of absorption and deposition may be studied with special care in horizontal sections of the ramus of the lower jaw, where the appearances seen completely corroborate Humphry's observations (p. 35). All the bones normally become more dense for a long time after middle life, the arrangement of the lamination at the same time becoming more complex. But as old age advances absorption gains the ascendency, and not only medullary cavities are enlarged, but the tables of the skull approach one to the other, while everywhere compact tissue exhibits enormous absorption-spaces or enlarge ments of the Haversian canals, which in the recent state contain masses of closely set, small, but by no means active corpuscles. In sections of decalcified bone in which the soft tissues have been preserved, the Haversian spaces are lined with nucleated corpuscles regularly arranged; and similarly on the periosteal Fig. 27.—Compact Osseous Tissue of Old Age.

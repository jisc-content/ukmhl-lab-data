THE CRANIAL NERVES. 587 THE CRANIAL NERVES. The cranial nerves are numbered from before backwards, and each is, in addition, distinguished by a special name. According to the system of Names. 1 System of Willis. System of Soemmerring. Olfactory, n First. First. Optic, - - - a Second. Second. Ociilo-motor, e iliu^d. Third. Pathetic or trochlear*, e Fourth.

Soemmerring, which is now usually adopted, twelve pairs are enumerated ; in the older system of Willis they were arranged in nine pairs. In com- paring the two systems, the first six nerves in each correspond; the seventh nerve of Willis forms the seventh and eighth of Soemmerring. The eighth nerve of Willis corresponds in the more modern system to three trunks, the ninth, tenth, and eleventh; and the ninth nerve of Willis becomes in the classification of Soemmerring the twelfth. In speaking of the nerves behind the sixth, it is advisable to employ the descriptive names of the trunks, as the use of the numbers may lead to confusion. THE FIRST OR OLFACTORY NERVE. The first or olfactory nerve (Figs. 407, 408) consists of a brush of filaments arising from the olfactory lobe of the brain. This lobe in many mammals projects forwards from the under surface of the frontal region of the hemisphere and contains in its interior a ventricle, but in man and the ape it is much reduced in size. It is rudimentary in the seal, and absent in the cetacean. In man the lobe presents an olfactory bulb and tract. The olfadorii nerve-filariients number from twenty to thirty; they are

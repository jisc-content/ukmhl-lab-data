'238 THE SKELETON. The nasal fossa is opened into in front and behind by the anterior and posterior nares, is roofed by the nasal bone and the cribriform plate of the ethmoid, floored by the palate plates of the maxilla and palate bone, and separated from its fellow by the osseous septum of the nose formed by the vomer and central plate of the ethmoid. The external wall has its foremost part formed by the nasal and maxillary bones, and its hindermost part by the internal pterygoid plate, and in its intermediate extent is complicated by the projection inwards of turbinated bones which roof three galleries called meatuses. Of these the inferior meatus is the longest; it is roofed by the inferior turbinated bone and walled by maxilla and palate bone, and near its fore part has the nasal duct entering Frontal sinus Fig. 220.—Left Xasal Fossa. (Pterygoid process pulled slightly from palatal.) A feather is passed from the frontal sinus to the middle meatus through the infundibulum. it from above. The rrdddle meatus is neither prolonged so far forwards nor so far back as the inferior ; it is roofed by the inferior turbinated process of the ethmoid, and has, in the wall between it and the antrum, the uncinate process of the ethmoid and parts of the maxilla, lachrymal, and palate bone. The antrum opens into it directly, while the infundibulum leading up to the frontal sinus opens into the front part of its roof, vdth. which the anterior and middle ethmoidal cells also communicate. The superior meatus between the superior and inferior turbinated processes ■of the ethmoid is much shorter than the middle meatus, and leads into the posterior ethmoidal cells. Behind it in the outer wall is the spheno- palatine foramen; and looking forwards towards it, above the posterior nares, is an opening into the sphenoidal sinus.

319 MUSCLES OF LOWER LIMB. the plantar fascia. Two sets of vessels and nerves, the external and internal plantar, derived from the posterior tibial trunks which divide on entering the sole, pass forwards among the muscles supplying them and reaching the toes. The muscles of the first layer, three in number, from within outwards the abductor hallucis, the flexor digitorum brevis, and the abductor minimi digiti, occupy the whole length of the sole, and are intimately connected Fig. 265.â€”First Layer of the Muscles of the Sole. (L, Testut.) with the plantar fascia. Two vertical septa of fascia, one on each side of the central muscle, separate the muscles of this layer from one another; and between the abductor hallucis and the short flexor of the toes the internal plantar nerve and artery pass forwards. In the second layer are found the tendons of the long flexors of the toes and the associated muscles, the accessorius and lumbricales, all of which have been already described. Between this layer and the first the

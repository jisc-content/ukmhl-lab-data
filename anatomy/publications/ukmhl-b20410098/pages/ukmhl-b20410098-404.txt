378 THE MUSCLES. margin of the rectus muscle, and sweeps inwards to the linea alba, splitting as it reaches the muscle to assist in forming its sheath; the anterior layer blends with the tendon of the external oblique, the' posterior with that of the transversalis. The lowest fibres, joining with the lowest of the Internal intercostal Fig. 295.â€”The Internal Oblique and Rectus Muscles. (L. Testut.) transversalis muscle, are inserted along with them by the conjoined tendon into the first half-inch of the ilio-pectineal line, and into G-imbernat's and a portion of Poupart's ligament. The lower border of the muscle crosses in front of the inguinal canal. The cremaster represents a continuation downwards of a few of the lower fibres of the internal oblique, and is much better developed in the male than in the female. It springs from Poupart's ligament at the lower margin of the internal oblique, and in the male its fibres descend in front of the cord; many of them form loops, and pass backwards to an inner insertion on the spine of the pubis, but others reaching further down are lost in a fascia, the cremasteric fascia, which invests the cord and the testicle. In the female a few fibres representing the muscle are usually found descending in front of the round ligament. The transversalis has a broad origin, and its fibres are directed

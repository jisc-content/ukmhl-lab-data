THE MUSCLES. 282 portion arises from the lower edge of the outer part of the anterior annular ligament, and is inserted by a short tendon which contains a sesamoid bone into the outer border of the first phalanx at its base. The inner portion arises by a broad origin from the ligaments and fibrous structures, covering the three outer bones of the second row of the carpus, and from the bases of the three outer metacarpals.

(L. Testut.) superficial fibres, forming a rounded slip, pass obliquely behind the tendon of the long flexor to join the tendon of insertion of the outer head of the muscle. The deeper fibres are inserted along with the adductor into the inner border of the first phalanx at its base by a tendon which, like that of the outer portion of the muscle, contains a sesamoid bone. The adductor pollicis, triangular in outline, arises from the anterior

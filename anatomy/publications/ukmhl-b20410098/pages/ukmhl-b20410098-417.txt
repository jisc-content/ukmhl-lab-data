MUSCLES AND FASCIA OF THE PERINEUM. 391 The sphincter vaginae muscle of the female corresponds to the bulbo- cavernosus of the male. It is attached behind to the central point of the perineum, where it is continuous with the sphincter ani externus. Its hbres pass forwards, surrounding the vaginal orifice, and covering the outer surfaces of the bulbi vestibuli. They are attached in front partl}^ to the vestibular wall, and partly to the corpora cavernosa clitoridis. The ischio-cavernosus muscle in the male, or erector penis, invests the crus penis. Its fibres arise from the inner surface of the tuberosity and ramus of the ischium behind and on both sides of the crus, and converge to a tendinous expansion which passes forwards on the under surface of the crus, and gradually unites with its wall. Fig. 304.â€”Deep Perineal Muscles of the Male. The anterior layer of the triangular ligament of the left side has been reflected; the lower and hinder portions of the levatores ani and the recto-vesical fascia have been removed ; the anus has been drawn backwards. (L. Testiit.) The ischio-cavernosus or erector clitoridis of the female is similar in arrangement to but smaller in size than the erector penis. The constrictor or compressor urethrae muscle of the male, or muscle of Guthrie, is constituted by a set of fibres lying between the layers of the triangular ligament. The greater number pass across the middle line between the inferior pubic and ischial rami of opposite sides, some in front of and some behind the urethra, and associated with these are some circular fibres surrounding the canal. The most posterior fibres have a direction slightly backwards towards the central point of the perineum and are sometimes separately described under the name of deep transverse muscle.

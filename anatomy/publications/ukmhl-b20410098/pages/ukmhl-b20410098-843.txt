THE TRACHEA. 745 THE TRACHEA. Thyroid - Cricoid-—. — Upper cornu Lower cornu 1 lacliea The trachea is continuous with the larynx and ends by dividing into the two bronchi for the right and left lungs. H is about 4| inches in length and | inch or more in breadth, but is capable of elongation by elasticity, and of diminution in diameter by muscular contraction. Hs commencement is opposite the lower border of the fifth cervical vertebra, and its termination in the. adult is opposite the lower border of the fourth dorsal vertebra. H lies in the middle Hne, and rests on the oesophagus. At its commencement it is covered at the sides by the lobes of the thyroid body; and it is crossed by the isthmus of the thyroid body, opposite the second and third rings. Beneath this is the spot usually chosen for tracheotomy ; and here the trachea has in front of it a layer of deep cervical fascia stretched between the sterno- hyoid and sterno-thyroid muscles, and separated from it the further it descends by a greater depth of loose tissue. In this tissue lie the inferior thyroid veins and the ima tliyroidea artery when it is present; and at the sides are the common carotid arteries, the right artery further forward than the left. The trachea terminates opposite the lower border of the fourth dorsal vertebra, with the arch of the aorta in contact with it in front and on the left side. The branches of the arch are in close contact with it, the innominate to the right of the middle line, and the left common carotid and subclavian on the left side. The recurrent laryngeal nerves ascend in contact with it, in the angle between it and the oesophagus. The trachea is strengthened on its front and sides by cartilaginous bands ft Tirolichus Bronchia Fig. 579.—Air-Tubes fkom Befork. (Pansch.)

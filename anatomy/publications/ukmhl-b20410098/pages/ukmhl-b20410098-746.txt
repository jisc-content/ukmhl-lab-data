The fibres are delicate and straight, those of adjacent laminae decussating; and at the edge of the cornea they are continuous with those of the sclerotic. Nucleated corpuscles are abundant, and in vertical sections appear spindle-shaped, Fig. 478.—Section of Cornea, parallel to surface ; showing corneal corpuscles lying in branched space. (Beaunis.) lying between the lamellae; but in horizontal sections are seen to be spread out flat, and to give off slender branches which, when undisturbed, take straight courses, mostly in two decussating lines of direction such as might correspond with the courses of fibres of adjacent laminae, uniting A B Fig. 479.—Corneal Corpuscles of Calf, macerated in vinegar and stained with haenaa- toxylin ; photographed. The stained threads of protoplasm are seen in unstained sur- roundings. In B the corpuscles are multiplying. (Dr. Reid.) the corpuscles in a network, and also giving off threads parallel to the branches in the other direction. These corpuscles occupy spaces or laminae which intercommunicate, and would appear to correspond pretty closely with them in size and shape, but to be capable of distension. Beaded channels, decussating in like direction with the corpuscular branches, first described by Bowman, have in later years been passed over as artificial structures, but the appearance can be brought into view without injection,

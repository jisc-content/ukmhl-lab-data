SYSTEMATIC ANATOMY. THE SKELETON. The whole osseous and cartilaginous framework of the body constitutes what is know^n as the skeleton.^ The skeleton may be conveniently considered as consisting of two parts, the axial or central, and the appendicular or that pertaining to the limbs. Each limb starts from an arch or girdle situated in the trunk; the upper limb being supported by the scapula and clavicle, which are easily separable from the structures on which they rest, and the lower limb by the os innomiuatum or pelvic bone, which enters largely into the boundary of the lower part of the trunk, and is closely united to the vertebral column. The expression ' axial skeleton' excludes these girdles, which in their essential constitution belong altogether to the limbs, and refers to the skull, vertebral column, ribs, sternum and costal cartilages, parts which lie in a longitudinal range, and exhibit a segmental repetition of parts. The skull, however, is so complex that its consideration may be delayed till after the limbs are examined. I. THE AXIAL SKELETON OF THE TRUNK. THE VERTEBRAL COLUMN. The vertebral column extends from beneath the skull the whole length of the body, and consists of a series of bones called vertebrae, fundamentally homologous, but differing greatly in detail. It forms a column of support by means of a series of solid structures, the bodies of the vertebrae. From the bodies spring the neural arches, which extend backwards and bound ^ The junior student before proceeding to the study of individual bones and joints, ought first to acquaint himself with the general characters of bone, described at page 24, and with the nature, varieties, and movements of articulations explained in the account at page 36. It may also be noted that although most of the details of bones are best studied on dried specimens, the articular surfaces are seen to most advantage in the recent state, covered with fresh articular cartilage.

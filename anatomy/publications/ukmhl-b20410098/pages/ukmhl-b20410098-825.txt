The descending colon extends from the splenic flexure in the left hypo- chondrium, through the left lumbar region, to the upper and back part of the left ihac, and is imperfectly covered with peritoneum, being in contact with the posterior abdominal wall. The sigmoid flexure is a loop continuous with the descending colon, forming in conjunction with the commencement of the rectum the double curve from which it takes its name. The loop hangs loose by a mesocolon, continuous below with the mesorectum.

The rectum, about eight inches in length, extends from opposite the left sacro iliac articulation to the anus. It is attached in its upper half to the posterior wall of the pelvis by a mesorectum, and slopes at first inwards and downwards, then lies in the mesial plane and follows the curve of the sacrum and coccyx till immediately above the sphincter and an inch or two beyond the coccyx, when it is directed abruptly downwards and backwards to the outlet. In the lower part of its curve it is considerably dilated, and being beyond the recto-vesical pouch, it is devoid of peritoneal covering. Here it has in the male fhe trigone of the bladder and the prostate gland resting in front of it, and in the female the vagina. The longitudinal fibres of the

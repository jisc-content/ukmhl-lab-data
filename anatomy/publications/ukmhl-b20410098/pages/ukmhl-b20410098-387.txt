DEEP MUSCLES OF THE BACK. edge it usually receives a slip from one or two of the higher thoracic or lower cervical spines. It is inserted into the inner area between the two curved lines of the occipital bone. A tendinous intersection is usually Occipital protuberance Obliquus superior Occipitalis | Occipitalis Fig. 2S4.â€”The Upper Part of the Erector Spinae and the Complexus. (L. Tcstut.) found about the middle of the inner edge of the muscle, and, in con- sequence, the name biventer cervicis is sometimes given to the portion of the muscle which lies next the spines. The semispinalis springs from the transverse processes of the thoracic vertebrae from the first to the tenth, and is inserted into ten spines from that of the axis downwards. The upper four or five slips show large muscular bundles springing from short tendons of origin, and, collectively, receive the name of semispinalis colli. The lower portion of the muscle, semispinalis dorsi, is made up of five or six slender muscular sli[)s lying between long tendons of origin and insertion. The multifidus spinae is formed of a large number of generally fan- shaped muscular bundles, and extends from the sacrum to the axis. In the neck the bundles arise from the articular processes of the third and succeeding vertebrae, in the thoracic region from the transverse processes, in the loins from the mammillary processes, and in the sacral region, where the bundles are blended together at their origin, the muscular fibres spring

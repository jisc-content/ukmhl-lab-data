The internal head, narrow and pointed above, but covering the whole breadth of the bone below, arises by fleshy fibres from the posterior surface of the humerus internal to and below the musculo-spiral groove, and from the posterior surfaces of both the intermuscular septa, the origin extending from the insertion of the epicondyle Fig. 237.â€”Triceps. (L. Testnt.) teres major to within a short distance of the olecranon fossa. The muscle is inserted into the upper surface of the olecranon process of the ulna in two planes, superficial and deep. The fibres descending from the long head form a flat superficial tendon, which is joined on its outer side by the fibres from the outer head, and on its inner side by a few of the most internal fibres of the inner head, and is inserted into an area close to the posterior margin of the upper surface of the

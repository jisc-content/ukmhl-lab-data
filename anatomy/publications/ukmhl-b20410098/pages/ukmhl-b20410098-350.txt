Acting in this position the muscle would assist in the initial stages of extension, its tendon occupying the popliteal groove of the femur, i Extensor digitorum longus Extensor hallucis longus Peroneus brevis 1 I Tibialis anticus Fig. 269.—Muscle and Tendons oe^ the Dorsum of the Foot. (L. Testut.) The gastrocnemius acts upon both knee and ankle, producing flexion of the former or extension of the latter, according as the one or other extremity of the muscle is maintained in a fixed position. It under- goes no change of length in the passage from standing erect on tip-toe to extreme flexion of the knee and flexion of the ankle-joint, and may be held as acting ligamentously in all ordinary movements of flexion and extension of the limb. The soleus acts upon the ankle alone, assisted ^ Goodsir taught that this was the special action of the popliteus, and that it undid the inward twist given to the outer condyle of the femur in extreme flexion (page 193). I prepared for him, at his desire, a dissection of the leg of the cat, showing that in that animal the popliteus extended the flexed joint to a very con- siderable extent.—J. C.

THE SKELETON. 122 interior, which also increases the proportionate breadth of the cavity. The bodies of the vertebrae from about the fifth form a pillar sloping down- wards and forwards at an angle of about 15 degrees with the vertical,, while the average slope of the sternum may be about 25 degrees. Below the ninth rib the thorax is slightly narrower, and the eleventh and twelfth ribs have their upper margins distinctly everted. Fig. 131.â€”Thoracic Skeleton, with the clavicles, scapulae, and heads of humeri in position to show how the apparent shape of the chest is affected by the superposition of the shoulders. In the female there is little increase of breadth below the fifth or sixth rib, but more rapid increase above that level; and this makes the heaving of respiration more obvious in the upper part of the chest, it being principally in that part that in inspiration small arches are replaced by larger at any particular level. In the child the height of the thorax is short as compared with its girth. In old age the arches of the ribs are liable to be flattened laterally. In the globular chest of emphysema the convexity of the sternum is increased. In shoemakers there is often a deep depression at the lower end of the sternum caused by pressure of the last. ARTICULATIONS OF THE AXIAL SKELETON. The vertebral column is joined together by synovial joints, intervertebral discs and ligaments. The synovial articulations between the articular processes are surrounded by fibrous capsules.

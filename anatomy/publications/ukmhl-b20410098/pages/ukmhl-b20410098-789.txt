THE ABDOMINAL CAVITY. 691 ligament. This consists of two layers, one of them belonging to the smaller sac, and reflected from the surface of the pancreas and upper part of the surface of the left kidney, the other belonging to the greater sac or general peritoneum, and continuous at the posterior margin of the hilus with the peritoneal investment of the spleen. The spleno-phrenic ligament contains the splenic vessels between its layers, and superiorly is continued to the left side of the oesophageal opening of the stomach by what may be called a left gastro-phrenic ligament. of liver Fig. 524.â€”Diagram of Peritoneal Folds m mesial section. The transverse mesocolon, in the greater part of its extent, is the con- I tinuation backwards of the layers of the greater and smaller sacs of the I peritoneum which form the great omentum. The layer from the smaller sac invests the front, and that from the greater sac the back of the transverse colon, and the two layers meeting again extend back to the abdominal wall at the lower border of the pancreas. But beyond the left border of the smaller sac a certain extent of the transverse colon may be separated from the posterior wall by mesocolon formed altogether by the general peritoneum; and beyond the right border of the smaller sac the transverse colon crosses the duodenum with the general peritoneum surrounding it more or less completely.

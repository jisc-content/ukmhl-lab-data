" (Hertwig, after Fol.) after the extrusion of the second polar body, a small nucleus is formed which retires towards the centre of the yelk, and remains as the nucleus of the unimpregnated ovum, the female pronucleus of v. Beneden, a struc- ture comparable in size rather to the germinal spot than to the germinal vesicle.! ^ The polar bodies have been made to play an important part in the theories of Balfour and Weismann, as so much extruded material carrying with it certain powers of growth, whether sexual, hereditary or other. But the polar bodies are not excreted products; they have a structural origin distinctly pointing them out as

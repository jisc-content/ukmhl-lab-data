323 MUSCLES OF LOWER LIMB. DORSUM OF THE FOOT. In addition to the tendons of the long muscles already described, one special muscle is found upon the dorsum of the foot. The extensor brevis digitorum takes origin from the anterior part of the upper and outer surfaces of the os calcis, and from the anterior annular ligament. It divides into four tendons, which pass to the four inner toes. The tendon belonging to the great toe is inserted into the dorsal surface •of the first phalanx. Those of the second, third, and fourth digits join from the outer side the corresponding tendons of the long extensor. The Navicular Internal cuneifoi'm Fig. 268.—The Plantar Interosseous Muscles. (L. Testut.) muscle is crossed by the tendons of the long extensor and peroneus tertius. Its innermost tendon crosses the dorsal artery of the foot. It is supplied by the external branch of the anterior tibial nerve. Actions of the Muscles of the Leg and Foot. The popliteus acts upon the knee-joint alone. In full extension of the joint the muscle acts as a rotator outwards of the femur, or inwards of the tibia, its tendon occupying a groove which crosses the lower lip of the popliteal groove of the femur. In this action the muscle assists to initiate flexion by undoing the lock between the articular surfaces of the joint. In addition, it is probable, on the other hand, as was held by Goodsir, and as may be observed during manipulation of the joint in the <lead body, that in the later stages of flexion the muscular fibres are again fully stretched, owing to the upward rotation of the anterior part of the

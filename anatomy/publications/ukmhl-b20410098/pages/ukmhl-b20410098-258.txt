THE SKELETON. 232 But more frequently, especially in civilized nations, osseous union has occurred on only one side; the other ala undergoes absorption to a con- siderable extent, and the septum is bulged to the side on which the cartilage is left free, so as to narrow the corresponding nasal fossa, more frequently the left than the right, and restrict the space for the passing of both air and surgical instruments. Frontal sinus. Frontal spine.. Xaso-maxillary suture.. Inferior turbinated bone.. Xasal spine-- Anterior palatine canal. Fig. 215.—Vertical Section Displaying Septum Nasi. (The mesial intermaxillary surface happens to be marked by two deep grooves, but the crest passes further back, and is already united to the maxillary behind Stenson's foramen.) THE MALAR BONE. The malar, jugal or cheek bone articulates broadly with the maxilla, and projects upwards and outwards, dividing into a stout and long frontal process articulating at its extremity with the external angular process of the frontal bone, and a compressed and shorter zygomatic process passing back to articulate with the zygomatic process of the temporal bone by a suture, the lower end of which projects further back than the upper. Looked at from the front, the malar bone presents a surface bounded by two short borders converging to an inferior angle, and two longer borders converging above. The more internal of the two shorter borders is the anterior edge of the articulation with the maxilla; the more external is thick and uneven, extending back to the zygomatic process of the temporal, and giving attachment to the masseter muscle. The anterior and more internal of the upper borders is concave throughout, and extends Fig. 216.—Right Malar, deep view. It articulates at a, with the maxillary; at h, with great wing of sphenoid ; at c, with the frontal; at d, with zygomatic process of temporal.

THE SHOULDEK-JOINT. 155- in the positions in which pressure is perhaps most frequently made on the humerus, its head is pressed not against the glenoid surface but against the coraco-acromial arch, between which and the muscle clothing the joint there is a large sub-acromial bursa. Observation on the living subject shows that in raising the arm it is not the case that the elevation at the shoulder-joint is completed first, and then followed by movements of the shoulder-girdle. The elevation of the shoulder-girdle always begins before elevation at the shoulder-joint is completed, but the mode in which the two movements are mixed differs in different persons. The amount of rotation of the humerus allowed is about quarter of a circle, both in the raised and hanging condition. The radius and ulna are articulated one with the other by means of a superior and an inferior articulation and ligamentous union between. But the superior radio-ulnar articulation is inseparably connected with the elbow-joint and may be described along with it. The elbow-joint. The orbicular or annular ligament is a strong band attached in front of and behind the small sigmoid cavity of the ulna, and forming together with it a complete ring embracing the head of the radius. The external lateral ligament is a flat band attached superiorly below the external epicondyle of the humerus and inferiorly to the orbicular ligament. The Kadio-Ulnar and Elbow-Joints.

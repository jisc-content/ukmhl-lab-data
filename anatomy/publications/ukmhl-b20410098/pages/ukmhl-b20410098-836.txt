738 THE EESPIRATORY ORGANS. THE LARYNX. ~ | ■ ! The larynx is the upper part of the wind-pipe, modified in connection with the production of voice and protection from foreign bodies. It presents I a special arrangement of cartilages, ligaments, muscles and mucous mem- | brane, the general character of which is that a firm ring, the cricoid cartilage, I furnishes the base on which the thyroid cartilage in front and the arytenoid | cartilages behind are raised and depressed, so as to alter the position and tension of two lateral folds of mucous membrane, the true vocal cords, which project from the floors of two ventricles, and by their approximation and vibration produce the voice, while the aperture is overhung by the i epiglottis and other structures for protection. Fig. 573.—Cartilages of Larynx. A, From behind: 1, thyroid cartilage; 2, de- pression on the cricoid cartilage for posterior crico-arytenoid muscle ; 3, median crest of cricoid ; 4, arytenoid; 5, cartilage of Santorini; 6, cartilage of Wrisberg; 7, epiglottis ; 8, posterior crico-arytenoid ligament; 9, 10, upper and lower posterior kerato-cricoid ligament; 11, posterior wall of trachea. £, from the front: 1, thyroid cartilage ; 2, 3, its upper and lower cornua; 4, cricoid cartilage; 5, crico-thyroid ligament; 6, lateral part of the same, continued into the crico-thyro-arytenoid membrane ; 7, epiglottis ; 8, trachea ; 9, anterior kerato-cricoid ligament. (Beaunis.) Cartilages. The cricoid cartilage is a strong and complete ring. Its inferior border is horizontal and continuous with the trachea, while the upper border rises with a concavo-convex curve on each side from before backwards, so as to give a height behind more than three times greater than in front. The posterior elevated part is likewise thicker, and placed on it are two convex articular surfaces for the arytenoid cartilages. These

755 THE SPLEEN. ramifications of the arteries and veins part company after a little, the small vessels quitting the trabeculae; and between the tunica media and tunica adventitia of the minute arteries there is a layer of retiform tissue which is swollen out in nodules by masses of minute nucleated corpuscles like the medullary substance of lymphatic glands or the contents of closed follicles, and contrasts with the pulp by absence of colour. These modules are called Malpighian bodies. They are not distinguishable in the healthy adult human spleen cut open, but in the spleens of children, and in patho- logical circumstances, and also in mammals other than man, they appear in ret tr ret Fig. 589.â€”STRUcruRE of Spleen, tr, Trabeculae; ret, reticulum; il/i, Malpighian cor- puscle with arteriole on one side ; M'^, another partially surrounding arteriole ; il/3, a third with arteriole in the centre ; M^, a fourth without visible arteriole. sections as semi-transparent grey spots, which have been likened to boiled sago grains. A Malpighian body may be pierced in the middle by the arteriole on which it is placed, but more frequently lies to one side. The branches of the splenic artery end in long and wide capillaries which do not form meshes as elsewhere, but open into the pulp-spaces, whence also the venous radicles take origin. This agrees with the fact that the serum [ of blood from the splenic vein has been found, like the splenic pulp, to be coloured with escaped haemoglobin. The spleen makes its appearance as a corpuscular mass in the second month of embryonic life. THE THYMUS AND THE THYROID BODY. These two structures have a closer connection with one another than with other ductless glands, being both of them originally developed like I secreting glands from the pharynx, and losing their ducts in early em- Ibryonic life. The thymus is an organ of early life. It has a colour and appearance resembling a salivary gland. It increases in absolute and proportionate

Beneath them is a narrow canal, the aqueduct of Si/lvius (iter a tertio ad qiiartum ventriculum), continuous with the fourth ventricle and opening in front into the third ventricle between the optic thalami, with grey matter surrounding it continuous with that of the floor of the fourth ventricle, and containing, as already noted, the nuclei of origin of the third and fourth nerves. ;ria terminalis ptic thalamus.

(Bouchard.) The optic thcdami are two large oval bodies looking upwards in front of the corpora quadrigemina, having the free surface white, and in great part, like the corpora quadrigemina, clothed with pia mater; but they have not, like them, continuity of the pia-matral surface across the middle line. Beneath them are the crura cerebri, while from the front and outer sides emerge the fibres continuous with the crura, spreading toward the whole surface of the hemispheres and known as corona radia.ta. The posterior extremity of the optic thalamus projects free, external to the front of the corpora 2q II

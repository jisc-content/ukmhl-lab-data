607 THE CEREBELLUM AN J) ANTERIOR VELUM. Deposition of fibres icWnn the cereheUum. If the horizontal fissure, in a conveniently prepared cerebellum, be torn open, it will be found that the corpus dentatum is embedded in fibres below that fissure, and appears to receive into its interior the fibres of the superior peduncle ; the fibres of the middle peduncle are arranged in interdigitating fasciculi, those from the upper half of the pons passing to the lower part of the cerebellum, and those from the lower part of the pons going to the upper part of the cerebellum, some of them crossing the middle line (Fig. 435); and the fibres of the inferior peduncle pass up between the two sets of fibres spread Fig. 440.â€”Semi-diagrammatic Transverse Section of Cerebellar Lamina of Mammal. A, Molecular layer; b, granular layer; c, white substance : a, corpuscle of Purkinje in front view ; b, small stellate corpuscles of molecular layer; d, terminal descending arborizations surrounding Purkinje's corpuscles; e, superficial stellate corpuscles; /, large stellate corpuscles of the granular layer; g, grain-like corpuscles with ascending axis-cylinders bifurcating at i; h, mossy fibres ; j, neurogliar corpuscle with plume ; m, neurogliar corpuscle of the granular layer; n, clambering fibres; o, ascending collaterals from the axis-cylinder of Purkinje's corpuscles. (Cajal.) out below the horizontal fissure, namely, those of the superior peduncle internally and the lower fibres of the middle peduncle externally, and mingle with the ascending fibres of the middle peduncle. The fibres belonging to the inferior vermiform process pass outwards above the fibres of the superior peduncle. Roof and choroid plexus of fourth ventricle. The ventricular surface of the valve of Vieussens and of the cerebellum, back to the posterior medullary velum, constitutes the roof of the fourth ventricle, so far as that ventricle is roofed by brain-matter coated with epithelium. But the free

THE DIGESTIVE OEGANS. 708 of the inferior maxillary nerve, descending on the inner side of the jaw, passes under Wharton's duct before ascending to the side of the tongue; and descending from the nerve as it approaches the duct are its branches to the submaxillary ganglion which lies above the duct, near its origin. The Fig. 539.—Section of Parotid Gland, human. (Bohm and v. Davidoff.) submaxillary gland lies loose in the surrounding textures. Its acini have a stronger membrana propria than the parotid, and in connection with this there is a network of stellate corpuscles. The acini are some of them filled with corpuscles of the muciparous and unstainable kind, and some of them with stainable or serous corpuscles like those of the parotid. Intercalary duct Crescent of Gianuzzi Fig. 540.—Section of Submaxillary Gland, human. (Bohm and v. Davidoff,) The sublingual gland, much the smallest of the salivary glands, is about an inch long and is narrow, lying under the mucous membrane of the floor of the mouth. It rests on the mylo-hyoid muscle, at the side of the genio-glossus and duct of Wharton. It consists of a number of separable lobules, some of which may open into Wharton's duct; but the majority of them, ten to twenty in number, open separately in a line (ducts of Walther); while a larger outermost lobule has a separate duct running along to open near the orifice of Wharton's duct, and was described both

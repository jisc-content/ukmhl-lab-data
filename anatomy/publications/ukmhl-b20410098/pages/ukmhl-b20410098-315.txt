289 MUSCLES OF LOWER LIMB. portions of the obturator internus, pyriformis, and gluteus medius muscles, and the vessels and nerves which escape by the great sacro-sciatic foramen. It is supplied by the inferior gluteal nerve from the sacral plexus. The gluteus medius, fan-shaped, arises from the large area of the dorsum ilii, limited above by the middle three-fifths of the crest and the superior curved line, and below by the middle curved line; fibres also spring from the strong fascia which overlies the surface of the muscle, where it is uncovered by the gluteus maximus. It is inserted by a short tendon into the oblique line running downwards and forwards upon the outer Semimembranosus | Long head of biceps Semitendinosus Fig. 249.â€”Muscles of Hip, deep layer. (L. Testut.) surface of the great trochanter, a bursa being interposed close to the insertion between the tendon and the bone. The anterior fibres are directed downwards and slightly backwards, the posterior downwards and forwards. The muscle is partially concealed by the gluteus maximus and nearly completely covers the gluteus minimus. It is supplied by the superior gluteal nerve from the sacral plexus. The gluteus minimus, very similar in shape to the gluteus medius, arises from the area of the dorsum ilii between the middle and inferior curved lines. It is inserted by a tendon into the anterior border of the great trochanter, a small bursa being interposed close to the insertion. T

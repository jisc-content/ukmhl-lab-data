THE LIVING CORPUSCLE. 7 without their intervention is quite exceptional; but they have been most fully observed in certain instances, as in plants and in the cartilage and epithelial cells of amphibians. The following appear to be the most important stages described: (]) The netted appearance of the nucleus is changed to that of coiled ah c d e f 9 hi k Fio. 2.—Cells with Karyokinetic Chromatin Figures, epithelial cells from gills of larva of salamander, a, Nucleus at rest; b, a thread formed; c, a dense ball; d, looser ball or rosette ; e, monaster; /, ci, h, i, dyaster and its changes ; k, two independent nuclei and hour-glass contraction of the whole cell. (Toldt.) and contorted threads of stainable substance or chromatin, while nucleoli and nuclear wall disappear. (2) The coiled threads arrange themselves into a rosette round a centre. (3) The rosette is converted into an equatorial star or monaster of threads arranged in loops with their free Fig. 3.—Monaster and Dyaster with Achromatin Spindle and Polar Rays. Schema. (Toldt after C. Rabl.) ends at the circumference, while two radiating arrangements of unstainable material, or achromatin, at the poles are united by a spindle of delicate lines passing through the centre. (4) Each loop of the monaster splits longitudinally in its whole length, and each daughter-loop, so formed,

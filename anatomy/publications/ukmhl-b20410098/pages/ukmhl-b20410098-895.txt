DEVELOPMENT OF THE EEPEODUCTIVE ORGANS. 797 that the coni vascidosi and commencement of the epididymis are developed in the conical mass surmounting the Wolffian body. The canals of this mass remain in the female as the parovarium (or epoophoron), while the portion of it which forms in the female the extremity of the Fallopian tube persists as the hydatid of Morgagni in the male. The proper sub- stance of the Wolffian body leaves only small vestiges in either sex, viz., in the male, the organ of Giraldes, and in the female, the paroophoron. Fig. 623.â€”Female. Descent of the testicles. Unlike the ovary, the testicle retains the longitudinal position, while it gradually descends and carries with it the epididymis on the outer side and the vas deferens on the inner. It reaches the internal inguinal ring about the end of the sixth mouth of foetal life, and usually completes its descent about the beginning of the ninth month. A band homologous with the round ligament of the ovary passes from the lower end of the testicle to the lower end of the Wolffian body. It joins the testicle to the point where the epididymis becomes vas deferens, and is the upper portion of the structure named by Hunter guhernaculum testis. Continuous with it, a larger band descends to the in- guinal canal, and thence afterwards to the scrotum, constituting the lower, larger and more generally recognised portion of the guhernaculum, homologous with the round ligament of the uterus. The uj^per portion very early disappears by the shrinking of the AVolffian body and approach of the testicle to the globus minor of the epididymis, while tlie lower portion becomes more fully developed and extends down into the scrotum. The peritoneal sac is prolonged downwards as processus vaginalis prior to the testicle leaving the abdomen, and reaches the bottom of the

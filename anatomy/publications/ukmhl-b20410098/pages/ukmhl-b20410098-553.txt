487 THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE HEART. thelial layer. When the ventral closure of the alimentary canal takes place, the tubes of opposite sides are brought into contact, and coalesce to form a mesial tube. The upper end of the tube is continuous with two arterial vessels which, forming the first pair of arterial arches, take a dorsal direction on the sides of the alimentary canal, and are continued downwards as the primitive aortae. The lower end of the tube is continuous with the two vitelline veins which bring back the blood from the surface of the yelk sac. In elasmobranch tishes and amphibia, the heart does not begin to develop until after the splanchnic walls have met ventrally, and makes its appear- ance from the first as a single tube; in birds the tube is at first single Fig. 366.â€”Four Successive Stages in the Development of the Heart. 1, Arterial bulb ; 2, ventricle ; 5, auricular portion ; 6, veins entering the sinus venosus. (L. Testut.) in front, but double behind. After the fusion has taken place the tube becomes divided by slight constrictions into four portions; of these the one nearest the head, the bulhiis arteriosus, becomes the basal j^ortion of the pulmonary artery and aorta, the next is the ventricular portion of the heart, the next the auricular, and the last forms the sinus venosus, a dilatation which at first receives all the veins, and afterwards becomes absorbed into the right auricle. While the successive portions are becoming diff'erentiated from one another, the whole organ, growing more rapidly than the upper part of the body, and its arterial end being pushed away from the head, becomes bent upon itself. The curvature is at first S-shaped, the cephalic portion being bent to the right, the succeeding

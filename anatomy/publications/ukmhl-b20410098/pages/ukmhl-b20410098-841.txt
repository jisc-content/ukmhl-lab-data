They rotate the outer angles of the arytenoid cartilages forwards and the anterior angles inwards so as to approximate the vocal cords to the middle line ; and they come into action in every act of vocalization.

(Beaunis.) The thyro-arytenoid muscle of each side has its inferior and outer fibres in contact with the foremost and longest fibres of the lateral crico-arytenoid muscle, but above these it is divided into an external and an internal part, the external part lying against the outer wall of the ventricle and above it, while the internal part is in its floor, within the fold of the true vocal cord. The inferior fibres arise in part from the side of the crico thyroid ligament immediately below the thyroid cartilage; the rest arise from the thyroid cartilage, close to the front of the crico-thyro-arytenoid membrane. The external part is inserted behind into the outer margin of the aryte- noid cartilage; and the internal part into the lower portion of the anterior surface of that cartilage. Though thus divisible into parts, variously described by different authors,

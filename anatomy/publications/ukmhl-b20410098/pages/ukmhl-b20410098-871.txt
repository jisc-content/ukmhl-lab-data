773 THE TESTES, SCROTUM AND SEMINAL DUCTS. Structure. The whole secreting substance is inclosed within the tunica albuginea, which is a leathery white fibrous structure, resisting all efforts to stretch it by manipulation, but yielding before the continued pressure exercised in health, and enormously in orchitis. This is the better under- stood when it is observed that it is pierced behind by the numerous branches of the spermatic artery and veins, which coarse forwards in its substance and form by their finest twigs and capillaries an abundant network on its deep surface, the tunica vascutosa of Astley Cooper. The arteries also exhibit a fine undulation in their course forwards, permitting stretching without diminution of calibre. From behind, a fibrous septum projects a little forwards into the interior, the corpus Highmorianum or mecliastimm testis ; and from this mediastinum a number of slender cords and bloodvessels radiate forwards and to the sides to be attached all over the interior of the tunica albuginea.

The secreting substance, protected and supported by these fibrous structures, is soft, loosely adherent to its surroundings, and easily seen with the naked eye to consist of a mass of delicate threads, long portions of which can be partially unravelled and detached with ease, so slight is the cohesion of their convolutions. When the tunica albuginea is divided in front and reflected backwards, the contained mass presents a lobulated appearance; and about three or four hundred lobes can be separated pretty completely, all converging to the mediastinum, and consisting of tubuli seminiferi closely coiled.

GENERAL ANATOMY. 44 dosely to the surface of the sarcolemma. These are sometimes figured with granules beyond their extremities, but I find that they are united in linear series by threads which can be separated by carbolic acid from the surface of the sarcolemma. They differ widely in appearance from the capillary vessels. Nerves. Striped muscle is supplied with medullary nerve-fibres which After branching come into close contact with them, then suddenly lose their medullary sheath and spread into \ branches likened to antlers. These with V-'-TOtntn;T^ large nuclei between them and a certain j^VjS^ amount of sarcoplasma are described as • y being beneath the sarcolemma, and con- : stituting what are called the motorial end- ! plates (Kiihne), and are confined to one part of the fibre.

They -are destitute of sarcolemma, and instead of forming distinct columns or

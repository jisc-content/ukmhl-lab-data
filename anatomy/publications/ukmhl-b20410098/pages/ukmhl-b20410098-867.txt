THE UEINARY BLADDER 769 The triangular portion of the bladder between the neck and the orifices of the ureters is called the trigone, and in the male rests on the rectum, so that it can be felt through the rectal wall immediately beyond the prostate, and can be punctured from the bowel without injury to the peritoneum. On each side of the trigone in the male is the vesicula semi- nalis, and internal to it the vas deferens, which descends on the side of the bladder, crossing between it and the ureter. In the male the peritoneum reaches down much nearer to the trigone than in the female, and the fundus projects further backwards, but is not, as sometimes described, lower in position in the erect posture than the outlet.

The interior of the bladder has a smooth surface, which is thrown into folds when the muscular wall is contracted. The trigone as seen from the interior is an equilateral triangle with sides about an inch and a quarter long, the posterior angles formed by the oblique slit-like openings of the ureters and the anterior inferior angle by the outlet. Its floor presents a slight triradiate elevation caused by firm fibrous tissue subjacent to the mucous membrane, and connected with it so as to make it firmer and prevent its falling into rugae like the other parts. At the outlet of the bladder the mucous membrane is longitudinally corrugated, and in the male there is a slight elevation of the lower edge of the orifice, called uruh vesicae, due to the prostate gland which grasps the outlet, and liable when 3c

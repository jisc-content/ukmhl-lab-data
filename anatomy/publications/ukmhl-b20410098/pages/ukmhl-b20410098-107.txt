83 EMBEYOLOGY. Amphioxus from the term, the formative yelk accumulates on the upper side or animal pole, and the ovum has been termed telolecithal. In osseous fishes and amphibians the formative yelk passes round on the surface of the nutritive yelk. In ova of the largest sort, such as those of birds, it is distinctly confined area called about Jth e -f more to a limited the ckatricula inch in diameter in the hen's egg, marked by a paler colour of the yelk; and it is within this area that the changes prior to and immediately succeed- ing impregnation take place. These distinctions deserve attention even from the human anatomist, as many details of embryology are conveniently studied in the ova of amphibians and birds. Maturation of ovum. After attaining its full size, the ovum undergoes changes preparatory to im- pregnation, which have been specially studied in holoblastic invertebrate ova, such as those of the sea- urchin and the star fish. The germinal vesicle, which has approached towards one side of the ovum, begins to lose its regular form; and first the germinal Fig. so.—Ovum of Rabbit. «, Follicular cells ; b, zona pellu- cida; c, germinal vesicle; d, network within it; e, germinal spot; /, yelk.

While this is going on, two starlike arrangements, united to form the poles of a spindle, make their appearance in connection with the germinal vesicle, and one pole of the spindle turns round till it comes in contact with the surface of the yelk and

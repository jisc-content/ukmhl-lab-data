542 THE NERVES. pulley of the superior oblique muscle; it is connected with the infratrochlear nerve, detaches filaments to the upper eyelid, and ramifies with the frontal artery over the root of the nose and the anterior part of the forehead. The lachrymal nerve (Fig. 402) passes forwards along the angle between the roof and the outer wall of the orbit, in company with the lachrymal branch of the artery. It detaches a slender twig which joins the tem- poral branch of the temporo-malar nerve, and terminates in filaments which are distributed to the lachrymal gland, to the integument at the outer can thus, and to the skin and conjunctiva of the outer part of the upper eyelid.

Immediately above the posterior auricular the auricular branch of the pneumogastric is figured. (J. Y. M.) The nasal nerve (Figs. 403, 407, 408), entering the orbit between the heads of the external rectus muscle, passes forwards and inwards over the optic nerve. It then enters the anterior internal orbital foramen, and along with the anterior ethmoidal artery crosses the upper surface of the horizontal plate of the ethmoid bone, lying immediately underneath the dura mater of the anterior cranial fossa. Through the aperture by the side of the crista galli it descends into the nose, where it at once breaks up into an outer and an inner terminal division. As it is entering the orbit it detaches the long root of the lenticular ganglion, a slender twig which reaches the posterior and upper

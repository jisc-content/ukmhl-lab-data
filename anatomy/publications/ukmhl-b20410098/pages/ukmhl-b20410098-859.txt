THE KIDNEYS. 761 emerge at the hilus. The proper substance of the kidney consists of an outer or cortical part and an inner part or mecMlary between the cortical part and the sinus or cavity continuous with the hikis. The medullary substance is paler than the cortical and is arranged in masses averaging in number about a dozen, called pyramids of Malpighi, each with a rounded base continuous with the cortex and ending at its deep extremity in a free papilla which dips into the sinus. They present a distinct striation g a Fig. 595.â€”Frontal Section of Kidney, o, Ureter; h, pelvis ; c, c, calyces ; d, d, d, d, Malpighian pyramids in section from base to apex, showing their papillae dipping free into calj'ces ; c, e, c, e, oblique sections of pj'ramids ; /' adipose tissue with cut bloodvessels ; g, g, g, g^ cut bloodvessels opposite septula; h, papilla looking out at the constricted end of a calyx. The uniformly granular stratum at the surface of the cortex is distinguished from the larger portion pervaded by medullary rays. from papilla to base. The cortical substance is about quarter of an inch thick opposite the middle of each Malpighian pyramid and dips between the pyramids, forming septula (columns of Bertin). Along the plane of contact of the cortical and medullary parts a zona intermedia is distinguished by a slight displacement of striae due to bloodvessels coursing in this plane and sometimes by a tendency to venous congestion. Close to the surface the cortical substance is uniformly granular in its appearance to the naked eye, but further inwards the granular appearance is alternated with minute columns of striated material prolonged from the Malpighian pyramids and called medullary rays, while in the granular-looking part between each

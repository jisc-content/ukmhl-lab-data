684 VISCEKA. and, in the male of the human species, two other small portions being likewise closed off, namely, the timicae vaginales which cover the testes. All the divisions are transparent membranes with delicate simple squamous covering. They'have a vascular network proper to them, are supplied with nerves (Fig. 518), and become painful when inflamed. In man, as in all mammals, the visceral cavity is completely divided by the diaphragm into a thoracic cavity containing the heart and lungs covered respectively with pericardium and pleurae, and the abdominal cavity lined with peri- toneum and extending into the pelvis. {A) The Thoracic Cavity. The thoracic cavity is mainly occupied by the heart and lungs, each with its own serous sac. Those of the lungs are termed the pleurae^ and Fig. 519.â€”Frontal Section of Frozen Body of Female of 40 Years. 1, 2, Lungs ; 3, 4, costo-phrenic spaces ; 5, left ventricle ; 6, aortic cusp of mitral valve ; 7, right auricle ; 8, aorta; 9, innominate artery; 10, left common carotid; 11, vena cava inferior; 12, vena cava superior; 13, pulmonary artery ; 14, trachea ; 15, diaphragm ; 16, liver ; 17, stomach ; IS, spleen ; 19, pancreas ; 20, loops of small intestine ; 21, descending colon.

To the interval between the two pleurae the name mediastinum is given, and it is occupied in its principal part (the middle mediastinum) by the pericardium and its contents, as well as great bloodvessels and the bifurcating trachea, while superficial to it the anterior mediastinum is dis-

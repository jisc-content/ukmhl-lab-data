EMBRYOLOGY. 101 lishes and amphibiaDS. By the formation of bloodvessels in the area opaca and area pellucida, outside the embryo proper, ^„ and of others within the embryo, continuous with the anterior end of the cardiac tube, a circulatory system is completed. The area vas- culosa is bounded peripherally by a sinus or vena termianlis, whence the blood returns hy a right and left vitelline vein, and reaches by the heart the tnmcus arteriosus. Thence the blood is conveyed by a series of right and left hrancliial arches round the fore-gut to fall into a pair of pimitive aortae which afterwards unite; while lateral branches, the vitelline arteries, a single pair in the chick, but numerous and slender in the mammal, carry the blood back to the area vasculosa. The branchial arches are five in number, the foremost being first to appear; but in birds and mammals they do not all exist at the same time. The two lateral divisions of the coelom turn round to the middle line along with the right and left Fio. 107. — Frontal Recon- struction from embryo shown ill Fig. 101. «, Mesencephalon; h, primary optic vesicle ; c and d, ventricle and auricle of heart.

184 THE SKELETON. ARTICULATIOXS OF THE LOWER LIMBS. The Pelvis. The ilio-lumbar and lumbo-sacral ligaments are two strong bands which extend from the transverse process of the last lumbar vertebra, the one downwards to the sacrum, the other outwards to expand on the inner side of the crest of the ilium. Fig. 179.—Pelvic and Hip-Joints. «, Two intervertebral discs divided by a section through the two last lumbar vertebrae and the base of the sacrum; h, section of dorsal sacro-iliac ligament; c, section through the synovial cavity of the sacro-iliac articulation ; d, small sacro-sciatic ligament; e, great sacro-sciatic ligament; /, section of symphysis pubis ; g, round ligament of the hip-joint. (Section by Allen Thomson.) The sacro-iliac articulation is a perfect joint, the opposed auricular surfaces of the sacrum and ilium being clothed with articular cartilage, although the inequalities of their faces, and the adhesions and limitations of movement liable to set in with advance of years, misled the older anatomists into thinking that there was but one cartilage, and calling the joint a synchondrosis, as is still sometimes done. The ventral sacro-iliac ligament {anterior of books) is a thin layer of short fibres bounding the joint in the whole extent looking towards the cavity of the pelvis.

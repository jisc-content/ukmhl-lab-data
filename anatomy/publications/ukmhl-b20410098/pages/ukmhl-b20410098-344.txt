318 THE MUSCLES. found either on the inner or outer side arising from the fascia, the tendons round the joint, or the lower part of the femur; the soleus and plantaris in like manner occasionally receive additional slips of origin. The soleus has been found partially or wholly inserted separately into the calcaneum. In connection with the popliteus an additional slip is frequently noticed passing from the head of the fibula to the oblique line of the tibia (the peroneo-tibial muscle of Griiber).

(L. Testut.) occasional muscles have been described—a tensor of the capsule of the ankle-joint springing from the lower part of the tibia, and a peroneo- calcanean from the posterior surface of the external malleolus to the calcaneum. THE SOLE. The special muscles of the sole, along with the tendons of those of the deep group of the back of the leg and their associated muscles, form altogether four layers covered superficially, or on the plantar aspect, by

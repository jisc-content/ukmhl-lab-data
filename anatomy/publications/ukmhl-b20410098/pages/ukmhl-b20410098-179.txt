THE SHOULDEK-JOINT. 153 articular surface as compared with the humeral, together with looseness of capsule, and thus it is more liable than other joints to dislocation. The tendon of the long head of the biceps muscle traverses the joint, covered by a sheath of synovial membrane. The glenoid ligament is a fibrous rim surrounding the glenoid cavity, which, taking origin from the bevelled margin all round, has its fibres matted and forms a yielding addition to the articular surface. At the upper end it is continuous with the tendon of the long head of the biceps muscle, which takes origin partly from its fibres and partly from the tubercle above the glenoid cavity. The fibrous capsule [capsular ligament) is weak, and is loose to such a degree that, when the muscles have been dissected away, the head of the Suprascapular ligament Entrance to bursa opened Subscapularis reflected Fig. 153.â€”Right Shoulder. humerus, being allowed to hang, will separate as much as three-quarters of an inch from the glenoid surface. The fibres are shortest and strongest above, where they are attached close to the tuberosities, and are longest below, where they desceud on the inner side of the humerus for about half an inch below the articular cartilage. They come from the margin of the head of the scapula, with the exception of an accessory band of fibres springing beneath the deltoid ligament from the coracoid process, the coraco- humeral ligament. Above and behind, the capsule is strengthened by the supraspinatus, infraspinatus and teres minor muscles, while inferiorly it has no muscular support, and in front it is in peculiar relation to the tendon of the subscapularis muscle, which, instead of supporting it, enters into its

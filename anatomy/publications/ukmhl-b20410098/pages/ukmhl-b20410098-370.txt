344 THE MUSCLES. The parotid gland, which lies behind the ramus, sends its duct forwards across the masseter, and a small accessory portion of the gland usually lies beside the duct on the surface of the muscle. A deep prolongation of the gland passes on the deep surface of the ramus into contact with the internal and external pterygoid muscles. The facial nerve and the external carotid artery lie in the substance of the gland; the nerve sends branches forwards over the masseter, and the internal maxillary branch of the artery runs forwards on the deep surface of the ramus and usually crosses the outer surface of the external pterygoid to enter, between its heads, the pterygo-maxillary fissure. The inferior maxillary division of the fifth nerve, which escapes from the skull by the foramen ovale, breaks up into its branches on the deep surface of the external pterygoid; of these the Mouth of Eustachian tube r,, Li Fig. 277.â€”Pterygoid and other Mdscles, displayed by reflecting the tongue downwards. deep temporal and masseteric pass over the upper border of the muscle, the buccal emerges between its heads, and the lingual and dental descend beneath its lower border. Nerves. All the muscles of the group are supplied by the inferior maxillary division of the fifth nerve. Actions. The masseter, temporal, and internal pterygoid muscles of opposite sides usually act together and draw the lower jaw upwards against the upper maxilla. The external pterygoid draws the head of the jaw forwards, and thus comes into play along with other muscles in opening the mouth. Its chief use is in grinding the food between the teeth, the muscles of opposite sides acting alternately. The posterior fibres of the temporals are opponents of the external pterygoids. The temporal fascia, a strong, firm layer, is attached to the posterior margin of the malar bone, the temporal ridge of the frontal and parietal

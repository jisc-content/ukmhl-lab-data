MUSCLES AND FASCIA OF HEAD AND NECK. THE MUSCLES OF THE SOFT PALATE. The soft palate or velum, attached in front to the posterior margin of the hard palate, is a movable curtain, with a free pendulous posterior border projecting into the pharynx and prolonged in the middle line into a small process, the uvula. It is formed by a somewhat ill-defined A, Basilar process Posterior nares Pharyngeal rece s Aperture of Eustachian tube D, Tongue Tonsil Posterior pillar of fauces (;, Epiglottis Anterior pillar of fauces F, Aperture of larj-nx Pharyngo-laryngeal recess F, Inter-arytenoid region c, Eustachian tube.

At its lateral margins it is attached to the internal pterygoid plates and to the wall of the pharynx by the muscles which enter and pass from it. Its muscles reach it from above, pass from it downwards, or are confined entirely within its substance. To the last group belong the elevators of the uvula, one on each side of the middle line, passing backwards along the

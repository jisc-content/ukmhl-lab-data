It is hoped that by this means superior accuracy has been gained, while distinctness has been secured by the aid of touching, often of an elaborate kind, which had to be taken in hand by Dr. Cleland. He has likewise provided the original sketches of all drawings whose authorship is not specially indi- cated. The source of every illustration which has been borrowed is acknowledged. In some instances photographs taken directly from microscopic objects have been secured owing to the kindness and skill of the distinguished oculist. Dr. Thomas Reid, and some of those represent- ing structures connected with the eye have been taken from Dr. Reid's own preparations. In the preparation of the letterpress, valuable assistance has been obtained from the works of many writers, among which there are specially to be mentioned in Microscopy those of v. Kolliker and Toldt, in Embryology those of His and Hertwig, in the Central Nervous System the Nouvelles Idees sur le Systeme Nerveux of Ram6n y Cajal, in Surgical Anatomy the work of Treves, and, in many parts, Quain's Anatomy, particularly the tenth edition.

GENERAL ANATOMY. 14 and tendons, have a definite length and are inextensible; that is to say, they cannot be stretched beyond their proper length without damage to their tissue. The definite character of the movements of joints is dependent on this property, and were it not for the same property in tendons, there would be a great waste of power by muscular contraction expending its energy in lengthening tendons instead of moving the bones to which they are attached. YeUoiv-elastic substance gets the name elastic from having the properties of extensibility and resilience like india- rubber. In the innermost coat of arteries there is a good example of a homogeneous membranous arrange- ment of this substance, while, in the middle and outer coats there are laminae exhibiting a transition from membranes with frequent perforations to firm networks of fibres mem- branously arranged. There are two very different dispositions of yellow- clastic fibres. In one^ the fibres are scattered through white fibrous tissue, and each fibre exhibits highly irregular circular curves, totally Fig. 8.—Deep Fascia or Aponeurosis over biceps flexor radialis muscle. Bundles of un- dulating white fibres ; fusiform and amoeboid corpuscles.

Such fibres are found in great abundance in the cutis vera and subcutaneous tissue, under the serous membranes, particularly the pleura, and in other situations. The other disposition of yellow-elastic fibres occurs when they form the main substance

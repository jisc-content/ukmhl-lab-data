It is open to question if any can be traced to the opposite side, or if the fibres of the white commissure are not rather derived from special corpuscles in the anterior cornu, and continued into the anterolateral cord of the other side. Such commissural fibres have been seen, after crossing, to divide into an ascending and a descending fibre. The posterior nerve-roots contain some centrifugal fibres from the anterior cornu (Lenhossek and Cajal), but consist principally of centri- petal fibres from the spinal ganglion.

(Cajal.) ganglia are unipolar in the adult condition (p. 51). but the one pole divides into a centrifugal and a centripetal branch ; and within the cord the centripetal branch is found to bifurcate into an ascending and a descending fibre, both ending by arborization in the posterior cornu. As the fibres enter the cord they are distinguishable, according to Cajal, into an outer and an inner fasciculus, the outer consisting of fine fibres bifurcating in the marginal zone of Lissauer, and ending wholly in the posterior cornu, the internal consisting of larger fibres which bifurcate in the columns of Goll and Burdach. Sections, in living animals, of posterior roots before entering the cord show that the continuations upwards of their fibres, after ascending a

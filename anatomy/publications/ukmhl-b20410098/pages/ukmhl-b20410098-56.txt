A layer of nucleated corpuscles appears in the fibrous membrane in which ossification is about to take place, larger and more numerous than those proper to its own substance; and the mineralized substance is at first thrown round groups of them in radiating bars frequently united so as to make a network of bony matter; while the spaces and corpuscles between remain as the primitive marrow- spaces and their contents. At the ossifying margins, fibres push straight 0 C d Fig. 30.â€”Ossification from Periosteum. Sections of femur of kitten before birth.

Ossification from cartilage exhibits a certain amount of variation in difi'erent circumstances. At the growing end of a shaft of bone in which ossification has alread}^ been proceeding for a length of time, the cartilage near the ossifying surface exhibits a series of modifications preparatory to undergoing conversion into bone. At a little distance from the ossifying surface, the cartilage-capsules are isolated, each containing one or more cartilage-corpuscles. Nearer the bone, the isolated capsules have been broken up into lozenge-shaped groups of small capsules, which, in turn, undergo further growth, so as to be converted into vertically placed rows of capsules, each of which is transversely elongated and contains one large corpuscle. Yet nearer to the ossifying surface the cartilage-capsules become rounded out so as to be as deep as they are broad, and proliferation of the corpuscles within them begins. Meanwhile changes have begun in the matrix between the capsules. It is rendered opaque by the deposition of granules of mineralized substance, and, after the

THE MUSCLES. to the kimbricales muscles. In each finger the tendon is invested by the fibrous and synovial sheaths already described, and pierces opposite the first phalanx the tendon of the superficial flexor. The ligamentum breve, which unites the tendon to the second phalanx, is specially strengthened by elastic tissue. Flexor digitorum sublimis Fig. 240.â€”Muscles of Front of Forearm, deep layer. (L. Testut.) The lumbricales (Fig. 244), four small rounded muscular bellies tapering to delicate tendons, spring, a little below the annular ligament, from the surfaces and the outer edges of the tendons of the deep flexor : the two inner muscles, however, spring likewise from the inner edges of the adjacent tendons. They pass to the four inner fingers, where each is inserted into the fibrous expansion of the extensor tendons on the back of the first phalanx. The tendons cross the outer surfaces of the heads of the metacarpal bones.

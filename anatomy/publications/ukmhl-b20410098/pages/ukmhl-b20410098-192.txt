THE SKELETOX. 166 The part in front of the obturator foramen is called the superior (or ascending) ramus, while the broad part which lies beween the obturator foramen and the symphysis is the body, and the narrower portion from this to the ramus of the ischium is distinguished as the inferior ramus. The superior ramus presents toward the obturator foramen a siu-face obliquely grooved in a forward and inward direction for the passage of the obturator vessels and nerves, and on the brim of the pelvis ex- hibits the pubic part of the ilio-pectineal line, which limits a smooth surface looking forwards, whence the pectineus muscle takes origin. The ilio-pectineal line ends about three quarters of an inch or more from the symphysis, in a more or less prominent spine to which Poupart's Fig. 163.â€”Right Pelvic Bone, deep side. ligament is attached : while sloping from spine to symphysis is a rough crest to which the rectus abdominis and its sheath are attached. The body of the pubis decreases in thickness from the superior to the inferior ramus, and from near the symphysis to the obturator foramen. Beneath the crest it gives attachment to the tendinous origin of the adductor longus, and by the greater part of its superficial surface to the adductor brevis muscle. Internal to these is a ridge for the adductor gracilis, fascia lata and dartos, and between the ridge and the symphysis a space for the inter-femoral ligament of the symphysis. The acetahuhim or cotyloid cavity is deeply cup-shaped, surrounded by a prominent margin, except at the fore part of its ischial portion, where the margin is absent and a notch is left looking downwards and slightly forwards. A non-articular depression continued in from the notch occupies the middle of the cavity, and the articular surface curves round this

86 GENEEAL ANATOMY. extreme of the meroblastic arrangement is exemplified in birds, segmentation in them being confined to the small germinal disc or cicatricnla. In mammals, monotremata excepted, the ovum is holoblastic and segmentation is equal. The two nuclei derived by mitosis from the first nucleus seek the centres of the masses around them. The process is repeated in each of these masses, and again in their progeny, so that the two unwalled nucleated corpuscles arising from the first division of the yelk are con- Fi(i.

(Hertwig, after Hatschek.) verted into four, the four into eight, the eight into sixteen, and so on. In this manner is formed what is called the morula or mulberry mass. Within the morula a cavity is formed by the determination of corpuscles to the surface, accompanied in the case of mammals with an absorption of fluid leading to considerable enlargement of the ovum. The resulting condition is known as the blastoderm or germinal membrane. Formation of layers and embryo. In Amphioxus, a development starting from this stage takes place, more easily comparable with what has been

CIRCULATION IN THE EARLY EMBRYO AND FOETUS. 495 vascular area. Within the area the arteries ramify and become connected peripherally with a circular vessel or sinus which, though venous in the bird, is arterial in the mammal. The capillaries of the vascular area absorb the nutritive material from the yelk sac. The placental circulation (Fig. 370) becomes established in man about the fourth week. The blood returned from the placenta passes through the umbilical vein, from which it is carried through the ductus venosus into the hepatic veins, where it is mixed with the blood from the liver.

From the hepatic veins it enters the termination of the inferior vena cava, becoming mixed there with the blood from the lower limbs. Entering the heart by the orifice of the inferior cava, it is directed by the Eustachian valve through the foramen ovale into the left auricle. From the left auricle, where it becomes mixed with a small quantity of blood returning from the lungs, it falls into the left ventricle. From the left ventricle it enters the commencement of the aorta, and is carried thence, owing to the position and direction of the carotid and subclavian branches, almost entirely to the head and neck and upper limbs, from

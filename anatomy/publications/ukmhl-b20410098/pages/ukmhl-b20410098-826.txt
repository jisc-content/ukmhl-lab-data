The mucous membrane presents a few crescentic folds {valves of Houston), the most prominent of them being situated in front, behind the prostate, and the next above it projecting from the posterior j wall a little higher up. The constricted part within the grasp of the internal sphincter is thrown into longitudinal folds; and lower down than this the ! mucous membrane, covered with columnar epithelium, comes in contact with | a thin prolongation upwards of integument with squamous epithelium of the I cuticle. The line of termination of the mucous membrane is distinct and crenated; and between the crenations there run upwards some short '] narrow prolongations of integument about eight in number {columns of ,1 Morgagni) separating shallow depressions of the mucous membrane, which J when engorged may become convex. j THE PANCREAS.

388 THE MUSCLES. root of the penis formed of the bulb in the middle line, and the crura of the corpora cavernosa at the sides. The crura are covered by the erectores penis muscles, and the bulb by the accelerator urinae. In the female the vagina intervenes between the bladder and rectum, and passes through the triangular ligament; the accelerator urinae is represented by the sphincter vaginae and the erectores penis by the erectores clitoridis muscles. The central point of the perineum in the male is a spot about an inch in front of the anal aperture; it marks the posterior extremity of the bulb. To this point the anterior extremity of the sphincter ani reaches, becoming confluent with the posterior part of the accelerator urinae, and the superficial transverse muscles from the ischial tuberosities join in the interlacement. In the female the corresponding muscles meet a point between the vaginal and anal orifices. A somewhat firm mass of the superficial connective tissue at the central point of the perineum is sometimes spoken of as the perineal hodtj. Symphysis pubis Fig. 301.â€”The Levator Ani and Coccygeus, from above. (L. Testut.) The levator ani muscle lies on the deep surface of the pelvic and its continuation the recto-vesical fascia. It arises in front by a few fibres from the body of the pubis near the lower margin of the symphysis, behind from the margin of the ischial spine, and between these points from the pelvic fascia. The anterior fibres of the muscle pass backwards.

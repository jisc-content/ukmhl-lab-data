400 THE VASCULAE SYSTEM. THE YASCULAE SYSTEM. THE HEART. The heart is a hollow organ with muscular walls. The blood enters it through six large channels and one smaller one,—the four pulmonary veins from the lungs, the superior vena cava and the inferior vena cava from the body generally, and the coronary sinus from the walls of the heart itself. It distributes the blood through the aorta and the pulmonary artery. It is inclosed in a membranous sac, the pericardium, which also completely or partially invests for a little distance the great vessels connected with it. It has the shape of a somewhat flattened cone, with anterior and posterior surfaces and right and left borders. Its base lies on the vertebral column in the region corresponding to the bodies of the sixth, seventh, and eighth dorsal vertebrae, the structures in the posterior mediastinum intervening; the apex projects downwards, forwards, and to the left, and is found opposite a spot in the fifth left intercostal space three and a half inches from the middle line of the sternum. The anterior surface looks upwards as well as forwards, the posterior downwards and backwards. It is divided by a longitudinal septum into right and left portions, each of which is again subdivided by a transverse constriction into two chambers, auricle and ventricle, the former being superior and dorsal in position, the latter inferior and ventral. A deeply marked groove, the auriculo- Fig. 307.—The Heart, from the front and slightly from above and from the right. (C.

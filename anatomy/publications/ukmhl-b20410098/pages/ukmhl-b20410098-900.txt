One sees also that where articular surfaces are opposed, as the upper surfaces of the scaphoid and semilunar are to the radius, each surface presses in all positions Fig. 628.—Rontgen-ray-shadow of Wrist of Hand, stretched in a line with the forearm. only on the district specially set aside for it, and never on that set aside for another. When the hand is in a line with the forearm, the inner part of the scaphoid is indeed below the semilunar facet of the radius, but it Fig. 629.—The same, with the stretched hand bent over the ulna. is not in contact with it; and when the hand is inclined to the ulnar side, the semilunar bone is to a considerable extent beneath the scaphoid surface of the radius, but is very far from being in contact with it. In both lateral flexion and over-extension of the hand there is seen to be lateral movement

THE PANCREAS. 729 deniim is broad, and is called the head; the greater part of the succeeding length is about an inch and a half broad, and is called the body; and the narrow extremity next the spleen is called the tail. With the ex- ception of part of the head, it is clothed in front with peritoneum by the posterior wall of the smaller sac. It is in contact behind, from right to left, with the diaphragm, the inferior vena cava, the superior mesenteric vein and artery, the inferior mesenteric vein, the aorta and the left crus of the diaphragm; and close' to its upper border is the splenic vein, partly concealed by it, with the splenic artery above it, as also the coeliac axis and hepatic artery.

Davidoff.) The pancreas pours its secretion into the duodenum by a duct {duct of JFirsung) with thin non-muscular walls, which can be easily traced running in the middle of the gland in its whole length, receiving in its course numerous tributary ducts from above and below. The duct opens mainly or altogether into the descending part of the duodenum about four inches from the pylorus into a shallow depression on the posterior wall, common to it and the common bile-duct, having pierced the intestinal wall obliquely. Near its exit it receives a tributary from the lower part of the head, rather larger than the others, and often there is in addition a superior or accessory/ dud opening fully an inch above the main duct, to which it can be traced back. The larger lobules of the pancreas consist of smaller lobules as in the case of a salivary gland. The acini are small in transverse section, and sometimes so elongated that some observers describe the pancreas as a

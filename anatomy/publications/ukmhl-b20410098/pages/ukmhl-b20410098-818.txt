720 THE DIGESTIVE OEGANS. are largest and most frequent in the last part of the duodenum and beginning of the jejunum. They become smaller, and are placed at greater distances apart in the lower part of the jejunum, and dwindle away altogether below the middle of the ileum. The mucous membrane of the intestine is firmer and thinner than that of the stomach, and has this distinctive character that it is covered with minute processes called villi, which begin at the margin of the pyloric valve and cease at the margin of the ileo-caecal valve, and stand out like velvet-pile when the membrane is placed in water. It consists of closely set secreting f tubules, supported by retiform tissue and resting on a thin stratum of I muscular fibre, the muscularis mucosae. Deep texture | | Thickened epithelial wall Nucleus of epithelial cell Goblet-cell Fig. 554.â€”Section of Tip of Villus, man, -^f-. (Bohm and v. Davidoff.) The epithelium of the surface, both of the villi and the intervals between, is columnar and characterized by a thickening on the free extremities of the cells. This thickening is a pulpy substance continuous over them, less firm than their deep walls, neither swelling nor collapsing so easily as they, and permeable by the oily particles of the chyme, which thus enter the interior of the cells and may load them to the extent of concealing the nucleus ; it presents in different conditions more or less distinct vertical ( striation. Scattered among the other columnar cells are some distended with mucus which displaces the nucleus to the deep end, and others widely open by escape of this mucus and called goblet-cells (p. 58). \

The membrana tynipani consists of three "layers—namely, the proper fibrous membrane, an outer covering: from the integument, and an inner covering of mucous membrane. The fibrous layer consists principally of fibres radiating from the tip of the handle of the malleus : but toward the cir- cumference these have been found to be crossed on their tympanic side by thin annidar fibres. Attention does not seem to have been directed to the fact that the circular groove of the tympanic plate is mainly occupied by a strong ring of fibres, and that it is this ring which is continued across the notch of Eivini and separates the membrana flaccida from the re^t of the membrane. The tegumentary covering is thin and destitute of papillae. The handle of the niiilleus, fi'om the processus brevis to near the tip, is between the mucous layer and the fibrous, its periosteum being closely uuired to the latter : and close to the sides of this line of union there is" greater vascularitv of the mucous membraue than elsewhere.

Th'S Eusfachian tuot is an inch or more long, and leads from the tympanum to the pharynx. It begins in the lower division of the Eustachian orifice of the temporal bone, which is lined with thin mucous membrane, and is known as the osseous part of the tube. The whole ot the rest is called the cartilaginous part, and is waUed above and internally by cartilage, which is also folded for a short distance down on the outer side, while the floor and the greater part of the outer waU are formed of

EMBRYOLOGY. 95 of epiblast and hypoblast at points somewhat removed from the terminal extremity of the gut. The vitelline duct comes off from the digestive tube in the course of the small intestine, and the spot is sometimes indicated in the adult subject by the occurrence of a diverticulum situated at a distance varying from four feet to eighteen inches from the ileo-colic valve. The respiratory tubes and the biliary ducts both begin from the fore-gut as mesial ventral culs-de-sac, dividing into right and left branches and continuing to ramify. Arising from the ventral aspect of the extremity of the hind-gut is Fig. 102.â€”Transverse Section through Duck Embryo with about Twenty-four Primitive Segments, a, Amnion ; 6, somatopleure; c, splanchnopleure ; d, muscle-plate; e, spinal ganglion ; /', spinal cord ; g, aorta ; h, hypoblast, i, cardinal vein ; vjd, Wolffian ducts ; it, segmental tube ; di, notochord. The proto-vertebra of older writers included the tissue between d and <j in which vertebral elements ai-e found, and through which nerve-roots laass. (Hertwig, from Balfour.) another hollow projection, the allantois. The allantois forms a vesicular expansion which in birds and reptiles continues membranous and extends beneath the shell of the egg, carrying with it vessels which perform the respiratory function till the animal is hatched. In mammals it is elongated and divided by hour-glass contraction into an extra-embryonic and intra- embryonic dilatation separated by an elongated cord, the urachus. The intra- embryonic dilatation remains as the urinary bladder; the extra-embryonic part, projected at the umbilicus, retains for a while its cavity, but owes its importance to its mesoblastic layer being spread out in contact with the uterine wall, carrying with it bloodvessels from the embryo, and rapidly developing the foetal part of the placenta, which furnishes the means of intra-uterine respiration and nutrition.

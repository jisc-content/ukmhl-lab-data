624^ THE BRAIN. anterior perforated spot, it contains the island of Reil, beyond which it is I continued into two principal limbs or branches, viz., the posterior, running about two inches backwards before turning upwards a little way, and the anterior ascending, which is shorter and is directed upwards and a little forwards after giving off at its commencement a less important and short anterior horizontal branch. According to Horsley the anterior ascending limb starts opposite the upper end of the spheno-squamous suture and runs upwards along by or just in front of the coronal suture, while the anterior horizontal corresponds in position with the spheno-parietal suture, and the posterior limb, starting from opposite the highest point in the squamous suture, ends close to the parietal eminence. The islajid of Reil {insula, lobus centralis, gyri operti) is a triangular mass \ isolated from the rest of the hemisphere by a depression, sulcus circularis \ V. Umitans, and broken externally into gpi breves, typically five in number, Left cri Fig. 453.â€”Left Island of Reil and Olfactory Lobk, with Descending Cornu of Lateral Ventricle laid open by a cut through the wall between it and the posterior branch of the fissure of Sylvius, and reflecting the floor containing the hippocampus major. the three foremost separated by a complete sulcus from the two behind (anterior and posterior insula of Eberstaller), and all converging toward the inner angle or pole. The portions immediately surrounding the circular sulcus are spoken of as opercula. Cunningham counts four of these: (1) the external, known as fronto-parietal; (2) the posterior or tempm^al; (3) the orbital, lying internal to the anterior horizontal branch of the Sylvian fissure; and (4) the part which sometimes intervenes between the fronto-

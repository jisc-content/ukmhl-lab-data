They are about half an inch in breadth, and vary from the circular form to a [ length of more than two inches. The closed follicles have firm walls of connective tissue, and contain minute lymphoid corpuscles and fine threads of connective tissue, with loops of capillary bloodvessels converging to the i centre. They slightly project on the surface in the recent state, and reach down into the submucous tissue.

The bloodvessels of the mucous membrane present the peculiarity seen more distinctly in the stomach that the glands are supplied by capillaries given off from arterioles immediately after piercing the muscularis mucosae, and pour their blood into larger capillaries on the surface where the venous radicles take origin; but the arterioles are continued on to supply the villi, breaking up at the bases of these into large capillaries, which in the broader villi run parallel one to another, united by smaller branches. Each villus has its bloodvessels confined to the surface, so as to form a web in the form of a hollow cone. The lacteals arise, as already described, in the interior of the villi, and fall into a network of smaller vessels in the sub- stance of the mucous membrane, which discharges its contents into a network of wider vessels in the submucous coat, immediately beneath the muscularis mucosae. This network specially surrounds the base of each closed follicle, but does not seem to communicate with its interior, and has never been alleged to do so.

MUSCLES OF THE THORAX. 871 The serratus posticus superior (Fig. 282) arises by a thin flat tendon from the lower part of the ligamentam nuchae, the last cervical and the first two or three thoracic spines. It passes downwards and outwards as a thin sheet, and immediately beyond the lateral margin of the erector spinae is inserted into the outer surfaces and upper borders of four ribs from the second to the fifth, and into the fascia covering the corre- sponding intercostal spaces. The muscle lies on the deep surface of the 5j .2 S -S Stenio-hyoid Clavicle j Internal mammary 1 artery —), Internal mammary j veins Triangularis sterni Linea alba Transversalis Fig. 292.—The Triangularis Stekni. (L. Testut.) rhomboidei, and is completely covered by them, except at tlie upper part of the origin where it comes into contact with the deep surface of the trapezius. Tte serratus posticus inferior (Fig. 229) arises, under cover of the latissimus dorsi, from the posterior layer of the lumbar aponeurosis in the region between the tenth thoracic and fourth lumbar spines. It is inserted by four slips into the lower borders of the last four ribs. The slips of insertion extend outwards from the l)order of the erector s})iriae

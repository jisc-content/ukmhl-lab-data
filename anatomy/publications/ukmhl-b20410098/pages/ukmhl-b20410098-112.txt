In the mammalian ovum, the blastodermic membrane is spherical, and presents a single layer of corpuscles; but, unlike the arrangement described in Amphioxus, it has adherent to its deep surface at one part a mass of other corpuscles of rounded form, differing from those which form the membrane in being granular instead of clear. This granular heap becomes flattened out, and, in the part where it adheres, the area embryonalis appears as a white thickening. The most deeply placed corpuscles now become distinguished as a single layer of flattened cells, the entoderm; Fig. 88.—The Blastoderm, uterine ovum of rabbit, a, Zona pellucida ; 6, blastoderm ; c, heap of cleavage- corpuscles.

(Kolliker.) while the remainder, the ectoderm, distinct from the entoderm, consists of cubical cells, covered at first with others of flattened form, Bauhei'^s layers destined soon to disappear in a manner still disputed. The complete separation of ectoderm and entoderm gradually extends round the whole ovum. The thickening of the area embryonalis belongs entirely to the ectoderm. At first circular, it elongates to an ovoid form, and from its narrower extremity a immitive streak extends forwards, in connection with whose expanded hinder end a minute blastopore has been observed (Heape). In front of the primitive streak the medullary folds appear as in the bird.

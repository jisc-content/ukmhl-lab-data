Each consists of a long duct with saccules, simple and divided, ranged along each side, filled with sebaceous secretion, and presenting flat secreting cells like those of ordinary sebaceous glands. They are about thirty or forty in number, and afford a certain protection against overflow of tears. The Meibomian follicles are surmounted by accessory lachrymal glands, consisting of convoluted masses of tubules pouring their secretion out on the conjunctiva.

The conjunctiva is the mucous membrane within the aperture of the eyelids, developed by reflection of the integuments, and presenting a pal- pebral and an ocular part. The conjunctiva palpehralis is so vascular as to have a pink colour; it is firmly adherent to the tarsal cartilages, but beyond these is loose and easily separated. At the inner canthus it forms the caruncle, in which are to be found modified sudoriparous and sebaceous glands; and outside this it is thrown into a vertical fold, plica semilunaris, a vestigial third eyelid, better developed in various mammals, in some of which it contains tough structure, and even, as in the seal, a considerable cartilage, and also corresponding with the large membrana nictitans of birds. The conjunctiva bulbi is reflected on the sclerotic, and in the healthy state is transparent, displaying the course of only a few vessels, while its capillaries are insufficient to modify the whiteness of the sclerotic beneath it. Its

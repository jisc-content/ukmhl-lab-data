291 MUSCLES OF LOWER LIMB. large bursa lies between the tendon and the fibro-cartilaginous surface, and is sometimes continued on to the back of the capsule of the hip-joint. The muscle is supplied by a special branch from the sacral plexus. The gemelli, narrow fleshy bundles, are placed one above and the other below the extra-pelvic portion of the obturator internus and overlap it, the superior and smaller chiefly on the posterior aspect, the inferior chiefly in front. The superior arises from the base of the ischial spine, the inferior from the tuberosity and the outer lip of the trochlear surface. They are inserted with the tendon of the obturator internus. The three muscles cross the posterior surface of the capsule of the joint, and are attached to it by fascia. The superior is supplied by a special branch from the sacral plexus, the inferior by a nerve from the same source, common to it and the quadratus femoris. The quadratus femoris, small, four-sided, and fleshy, springs from the outer margin of the ischial tuberosity. It is inserted into the posterior margin and outer surface of the great trochanter, extending as far down as the level of the upper border of the small trochanter. The muscle conceals the tendon of the obturator externus. Its lower border is in contact with the upper edge of the adductor magnus. It is supplied from the sacral plexus. The obturator externus takes origin from the outer surface of the wall of the pelvis. It springs from the bony margin of the anterior half of the obturator foramen, and from the anterior half of the obturator membrane. Narrowing rapidly to a flattened band, it passes outwards beneath the acetabulum, then outwards and upwards across the posterior surface of the

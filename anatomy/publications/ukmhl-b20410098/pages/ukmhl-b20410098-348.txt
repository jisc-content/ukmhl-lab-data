THE MUSCLES. 322 under surface of the base of the fifth metatarsal bone, and the sheath of the peroneus longus. It is inserted with the abductor minimi digiti. The interosseous muscles. The arrangement of these muscles is very similar to that of the corresponding muscles in the hand, but differs from it in this respect that in the foot the muscles are grouped round the second digit instead of the third, as in the hand. Springing from the metatarsal bones they are inserted by tendons, which cross the metatarso-phalangeal joints, partly into the basal portions of the phalanges of the first row, partly into the expansions of the extensor tendons. 1 interosseous muscle interosseous muscle Fig. 267.â€”The Dorsal Interosseous Muscles. (L. Testut.) The four dorsal muscles. Each springs from the sides of both the bones between which it is placed; but while in most cases the origins extend along nearly the whole length of the metatarsal bones, the inner head of the first muscle is connected with the base only of the first metatarsal bone. The first two are inserted into the second digit. The third and fourth belong to the outer sides respectively of the third and fourth digits. The three plantar muscles act cn the three outer toes, and each is placed on the inner side of the digit to which it belongs. Each arises from but one metatarsal bone, that of the digit upon which the muscle acts, but all derive additional fibres from the sheath of the peroneus longus muscle.

666 OEGANS OF SPECIAL SENSE. the peduncle is the future optic nerve. Soon the primary optic vesicle and fore part of its peduncle become folded in, the lower and fore part of the vesicle being invaginated so as to come in contact with the upper and back part, and the edge of invagination becomes divided into a circular fore part and two retreating lower edges, which approach one to the other, so as to complete a cup, the secondary optic vesicle. At the same time that the primary optic vesicle is invaginated to form the cup of the secondary vesicle, a superficial depression appears opposite the mouth of the Outicular and subcutaneous Fig. 503.â€”Section of Eye of Embryo Rat. The place of continuity of the retina and choroid at the invagination of the primary optic vesicle is seen. (Preparation by Ur. Mackay.) cup, and deepens to a pit which becomes constricted at the neck and closed off as a shut sac embedded in mesenchyma and lined with epithelium, to be converted into the lens; while from the mesenchyma are derived the vitreous humour, iris and outer coat of the eyeball. The pigmented epithelium appears in the chick toward the fourth day, and it then becomes evident that the non-invaginated portion of the wall of the primary optic vesicle is converted into choroid and pigmented epithelium, while the invaginated part is converted into retina. There is no development of brain-matter from the non-invaginated wall, and therefore the vessels and epithelium come in contact exactly as they do at the choroid plexuses of the brain; while the retina, being formed from the invaginated wall, has its originally superficial surface turned to the centre of the eyeball, has its vascular supply on that surface, and has the surface originally looking

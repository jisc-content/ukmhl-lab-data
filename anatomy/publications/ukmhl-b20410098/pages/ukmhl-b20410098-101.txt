INTEGUMENTS. 11 races and in difterent parts of the body. In straight hair it is cylindrical^ in curly hair somewhat flattened, and in woolly hair quite strap-shaped. The flattest hairs are those of the armpit. The hair-follicle is the depression which lodges the root and lower end of the shaft of the hair. It is an invagination of the corium, and is- lined with an invagination of the epidermis, termed the root-sheath. The follicle has three distinct layers: (1) the external or peripheral coat of closely felted fibres, with the insertion of the erector muscle connected with it; (2) a middle dense coat, w^ith nuclei elongated transversely; and (3) an internal homogeneous membrane. The sheath presents in contact w^ith the follicle a continuation of the deep part of the epidermis, and internal to this three distinguishable layers continuous with the horny epidermis, viz.: (1) a layer of scales with no perceptible nuclei, named after Henle; (2) a layer with distinct nuclei, associated with the name of Huxley; (3) an imbricated so-called epithelium of the sheath, with the free edges of its scales directed downwards, continuous below with the epithelium of the hair itself. The hair-follicles are sloped, being arranged round various points and lines. Those of the scalp form a whorl round the vertex; those of the trunk incline towards the middle line in front and behind; in the male a line, absent in the female, extends up from the pubis; in the limbs the slope is downwards. On the side toward which the hair is inclined, there is a band of unstriped muscle, erector pili, descending from the corium at a little distance obliquely to near the lower end of the follicle, and tending to elevate the hair into the erect position. The action is well illustrated in the hair of a horse when taken ill, the coat losing its gloss and standing up.

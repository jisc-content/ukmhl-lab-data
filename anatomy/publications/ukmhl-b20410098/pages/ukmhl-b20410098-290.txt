At its origin the muscle clasps the insertion of the deltoid above, and extends below nearly as far as the place of attachment of the capsular membrane of the elbow-joint. From the greater part of the external septum it is separated by the supinator longus and the extensor carpi radialis longior. The musculo-cutaneous

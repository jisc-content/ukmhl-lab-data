On the shaft, for a fourth of its length, the Udpital groove, so named from lodging the long head of the biceps muscle, descends with a slightly inward inclination, bounded by an outer ridge which denotes the insertion of the pectoralis major muscle, and a less prominent inner ridge to which the teres major muscle is inserted, while the tendon of the latissimus dorsi

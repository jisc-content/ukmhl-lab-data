THE MUSCLES. 386 inguinal canal, namely—the infundibuliform fascia surrounding the sac, muscular fibres of the internal oblique and cremaster, and the tendon of the external oblique in front; the conjoined tendon with the fascia transversalis lying behind. In the scrotum this form of hernia, in addition to the dartos tissue, is surrounded by the intercolumnar fascia from the margins of the superficial ring, the cremasteric fascia, into which the cremaster muscle is continued, and the infundibuliform fascia.

(L. Testut.) A direct hernia, in addition to the sac and the subperitoneal tissue, carries before it a portion of the fascia transversalis and conjoined tendon, usually associated as a single covering, and, if retained within the wall, lies behind the lower part of the external oblique tendon. In the scrotum its coverings are similar to those of the oblique form, with the exception that the investment from the fascia transversalis and conjoined tendon replaces the infundibuliform fascia. When the anterior abdominal wall is viewed from the deep surface, the deep epigastric artery jjassing towards the outer margin of the rectus abdominis muscle makes with it the sides of a triangle of which the inner

MUSCLES OF UPPER LIMB. 257 outer surfaces of the first eight ribs near their anterior extremities. Con- verging considerably, the fibres are inserted into an area of the ventral surface of the scapula which lies close to the vertebral border of the bone. From the first and second ribs a thick slip forming the upper edge of the muscle passes backwards and slightly upwards to a rough area near the Fig. 230.â€”The Serratus Magnus and Neighbouring Muscles. (L. Testut.) upper angle; from the second and third ribs two broad thin slips pass downwards and backwards to a narrow line which connects the upper and lower rough impressions; the remaining slips converge rapidly to form a thick mass which is inserted into the large triangular area in front of the lower angle. The lower slips interdigitate at their origin with those of the external oblique muscle. The inner surface of the muscle is in close con- R

The mperior articular surface, taking part in the ankle-joint, is divided by prominent ridges into a central, an inner and an outer portion. The central portion looking upwards is convex from behind forwards, and slightly grooved longitudinally; its inner border is straight and nearly parallel with the inner side of the foot; its outer border is curved forwards and outwards so as to give greater breadth in front than behind, and is on the whole more prominent, but is flattened out behind to form an angular facet, which fits against a ligament and synovial pad between tibia and fibula when the foot is extended. The portion of the superior articular surface which looks imvards is a sickle-shaped strip, broadest in front and

APPENDIX. 803 I of the lower range of carpal bones on the upper range, for in both these positions the unciform is approached to the semilunar, while in the straight position of the hand it is quite separated from it. That this lateral move- I ment is accompanied by movement in which the scaphoid and cuneiform are thrown back at the extremities removed from the semilunar is shown by the apparent elongation of scaphoid and cuneiform. This is in keeping with the description of movements given at p. 161 ; also the gaps there Fig. 630.â€”The same, with the hand completely over-extended. pointed out as existing in different positions between trapezium and first metacarpal are to a certain extent illustrated. Another point may be noted. The hand employed happened to be that of a man over sixty, and the shadows exhibit the lines of union of the shafts and epiphyses of the radius and ulna, a thing which might be seen over and over again in macerated bones without the age of the bones being known. This reminds us that much accurate information can now be got on the subject of the condition of epiphyses at different ages.

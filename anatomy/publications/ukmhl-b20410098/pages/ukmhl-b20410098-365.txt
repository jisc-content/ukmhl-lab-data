MUSCLES AND FASCIA OF HEAD AND NECK. 339 The muscles of opposite sides together form a muscular floor for the buccal cavity. The genio-liyoid springs from the lower genial tubercle of the inferior maxilla, and is inserted into the anterior surface of the body of the hyoid bone. It is a small rounded bundle, and lies on the upper or deep surface of the mylo-hyoid, close to the middle line.

(L. Testut.) I The stylo-hyoid, a slender band, springs by a short tendon from the posterior and external part of the base of the styloid process. It passes downwards and forwards and is inserted into the anterior surface of the lateral part of the body of the hyoid bone. It is at first deeply placed, but afterwards becomes superficial, as it lies above the upper border of the posterior belly of the digastric, and its fibres passing to insertion embrace the intervening tendon of that muscle.

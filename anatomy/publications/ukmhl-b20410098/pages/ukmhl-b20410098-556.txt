THE VASCULAR SYSTEM. 490 formed by the union of the vessels of the opposite sides. The right aortic root disappears, tlie left forms a portion of the permanent aorta. The fifth arch of the right side disappears entirely; that of the left side gives off from its ventral extremity a branch to each lung, and its continuation towards the root of the dorsal aorta becomes the ductus arteriosus, a vessel which is patent during foetal life, but becomes in the adult a solid cord. When the bulbus arteriosus is divided by a septum into two channels, that which is connected with the right ventricle becomes continuous with the fifth left arch and forms the base of the pulmonary artery, while the other, connected with the left ventricle, becomes the ascending aorta.

The fourth arch of the left side forms a portion of the arch of the aorta, and is continued by the left aortic root into the dorsal aorta. The left subclavian artery springs from the left aortic root near the place where the ductus arteriosus or fifth left arch enters. The ventral vessel of the right side, in the region below the fourth arch, becomes the innominate artery of the adult. The fourth arch of the right side persists as far as the place from which the right subclavian, corresponding in position to the left subclavian, springs, but its continuation beyond this as the right aortic root disappears. The fourth right arch is therefore represented in the adult by the basal portion of the right subclavian artery passing outwards from the innominate.

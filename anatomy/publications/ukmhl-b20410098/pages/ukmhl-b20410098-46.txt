25 GENERAL ANATOMY. Articular cartilage is the permanent hyaline cartilage which coats the opposed surfaces of bones united by synovial articulation. It forms a coverino- which is thickest in the centre when the surface is convex, and thinner in the centre than at the circumference when the surface is concave. It has a more milky appearance than most cartilage, and breaks across with a vertically Fig. 19.—Yellow Cartilage, from human epiglottis.

It is apparently due to the vertical arrangement of the corpuscles in great part of the depth, the matrix being firmer in the solid parts between rows of corpuscles. In the deepest part the capsules are oval; superficial to this they become elongated, and one finds elongated capsules containing linearly placed corpuscles, together with linear rows of shorter capsules, up to near the free surface, where the capsules become flattened out parallel with the surface. A section peeled from the surface shows corpuscles grouped together, often a number in one capsule, something like costal cartilage, but difi"ering in respect that the corpuscles and capsules are flat. In every joint in the adult, the articular cartilage is separated from the osseous texture beneath, a thin calcified layer presenting unbranched cavities in a uniforml}^ calcified matrix. It is strange that writers have sometimes been slow to recognize th is layer, seeing that it persists in the macerated bone, forming the peculiar crust of the articular surfaces, destitute of orifices of the kind which pierce the surfaces of true bone.

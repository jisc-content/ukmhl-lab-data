SYSTEMATIC ANATOMY. 110 «ach with only one pair of ribs; the tenth bearing one pair of articular surfaces on its body and another on its transverse processes, while the eleventh and twelfth have no surfaces on their transverse processes, and the twelfth has its one pair placed well back on the pedicles. Still more ■distinctive of the twelfth is the eversion of the surfaces of its inferior articular processes, and the separation of the three tubercles which together represent the transverse process of the typical thoracic vertebra. The lumbar vertebrae, five in number, are massive; their bodies have mesial; their rings are three- sided and large. The spines are horizontal and spring abruptly from the laminae; ^^^^ '-'^C^ they are laterally compressed, the transverse diameter greater than the Sup. Art. TnfArt. Fig. 118.—Second Lumbar Vertebra, The superior and inferior epiphyses of the body can still be distinguished. MA.Pr nearly as deep as long, and end in a linear extremity. The transverse processes have only a slightly backward inclination. They are com- pressed from before backward and elongated, evidently in series with the ribs. The laminae are nearly horizontal, ^nd the articular processes stand out distinctly from them, the superior further separate than the inferior, and embracing those of the vertebra above. The superior articular surfaces are transversly concave, looking partly backwards and partly inwards, the two parts meet- ing rather abruptly, while the inferior articular surfaces have a corresponding convexity looking forwards and outwards. Acc.Pr Projecting backwards from the superior articular processes are two tubercles called mammil- lary processes, in series with the inner angles of the ex- tremities of the thoracic trans- verse processes and giving attachment to origins of the multifidus spinae. They correspond with the anapophyses (Owen) largely developed in the hedgehog and still more prolonged in the armadillo to support its armour. At the bases of the transverse processes posteriorly, and pointing downwards, are a pair of pointed projections, sometimes indicated by little more than roughness; they are called accessory processes, give attachment to insertions of the longissimus dorsi, and are in series with the inferior angles of the extremities of the dorsal transverse processes. They are Fig. 119.—Fifth Lumbar Vertebra from behind. Note the wide separation of the right and left articular processes, the decrease in depth of the body behind, and the irregular shape of the transverse and spinous processes.

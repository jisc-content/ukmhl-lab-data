Another bursa lies upon the anterior surface of the tendon, separating it from the common tendon of" the biceps and coraco-brachialis muscles, which descends in front of it. The nerves of supply are the first and third subscapulars from the brachial plexus. The subscapularis takes part along with the latissimus. dorsi and teres major in forming the posterior wall of the axilla. The teres minor arises from the narrow area of the dorsal surface and the axillary margin of the scapula between the teres major and the long head of the triceps. It is inserted by a tendon into the lowest facet on Levator anguK) scapulae j Rhomboideus minor Infraspinatus ^ Rhomboideus' major \ Supraspinatus; Infraspinatus.

The muscle passes behind the long head of the triceps, and crosses the shoulder-joint, its tendon adhering to the capsule. It is supplied by the circumflex nerve. The teres major arises from the rough area of the dorsal surface of the scapula adjacent to the lower third of the axillary border. It passes outwards in front of the long head of the triceps, and is inserted by a tendon into the posterior lip of the bicipital groove of the humerus. The tendon extends a little further down the bone than does that of the latissimus dorsi, which is inserted in front of it, and with which it is for some distance in close contact. It is supplied by the third sub- scapular nerve.

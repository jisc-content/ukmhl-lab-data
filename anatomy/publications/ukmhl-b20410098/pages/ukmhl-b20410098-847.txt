They consist of amorphous granules irregularly aggregated, unsur- another after removal of the pleura. epithelium covering the partitions. rounded by cell-walls, and affecting rather the tissue between the air-spaces than the walls of these; and that they are independent of the textural elements appears to be shown by their being found abundantly in the lymphatic glands into which the lungs pour lymph. The lung consists of a multitude of lobules, each of which receives air by a single bronchial tube, and has an air-system quite independent of others

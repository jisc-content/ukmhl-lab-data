ORGANS OF COMMON SENSATION. 79 Touch-corpuscles of Wagner or of Meissner. These are bodies found in papillae of the corium, most abundantly in the hand and foot, especially on the flexor aspects of the fingers and toes, and also in the skin of the nipple, the red borders of the lips, the tip of the tongue, and the tarsal part of the conjunctiva. Each occupies a considerable bulk of the centre Fio. 75.—Vertical Section of Skin of Sole treated " ' ■with gold, showing numbers of cells of Langerhans, hut no nerves. (Kolliker.)

(Kolliker.) •of the papilla in which it is contained, and has the appearance of a firm oval or pyriform mass, on the surface of which one or two nerve-fibres lose their medullary sheaths. AVithin them there are numbers of nucleated corpuscles {touch-cells), transversely elongated, with septa between them; and the axis-cylinder of the nerve breaks into branches which pass in between the cells. Similar organs, with a small number of more distinct transversely-arranged touch-cells, have for a long time been known on the edges of the bills of ducks and other birds, corpuscles of Grandry or of MeiM. End-bulbs of Krause. These are found in the sclerotic conjunctiva, mucous membrane of the cheeks and epiglottis, and the papillae of the tongue, glans penis, glans clitoridis and nymphae; also in the synovial

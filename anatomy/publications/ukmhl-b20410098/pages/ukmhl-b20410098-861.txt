THE KIDNEYS. 763 quarters of an inch in vertical diameter, and as it escapes at the hihis turns downwards and narrows to the ureter. The renal substance is made up of closely set tubuli uriniferi, which, together with the vessels supplying them, are bound firmly together by tissue so small in amount that the tubes seem in close contact ; and though there are copious lympliatic channels between them, it is only by such means as maceration in muriatic acid that they can be separated to any considerable extent. To the patho- logist this connective substance is important as the seat of scirrhosis. The tuhidi uriniferi begin in the cortical substance, each in a Malpighian corpuscle, and are in the first part of their course convoluted (tubuli contorti), in the latter part straight {tubuli recti), the convoluted part being confined to the cortex, and the straight part being principally in the medulla; but between the portions pro- perly so-called are interposed two other parts, the loop of Henle, plunging with straight limbs far into the medulla, and the intercalary tube in the cortex. The Malpighian corpuscle consists of a spherical wall called capsule of Bowman, from which on one side the convoluted tubule commences abruptly, while at an exactly opposite point two small blood- vessels, the afferent and the efferent artenj, pierce it and are continuous with a bunch of small bloodvessels, the glomerulus, which fills in great measure its interior. In the glomerulus the afferent artery breaks up rapidly into convoluted branches which keep to the circumference of the globe and then turn towards the centre in loops to join together to form the efferent artery; and by this means the more the blood enters the glomerulus the more its circumference is ex- panded so as to leave room for the return current in the middle (Ludwig).

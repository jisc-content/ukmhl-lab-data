THE STOMACH. 711 membrane constricting the diameter of the aperture of communication to about half an inch when at rest. The oesophageal or cardiac orifice is opposite the tenth thoracic vertebra, a little to the left of the mesial plane, while the pylorus is about two inches lower, and a little to the right of the mesial plane, beneath the left end of the portal fissure of the liver, with which it is connected by means of the gastro-hepatic omentum. The stomach presents an anterior and a posterior surface, which are applied one to the other when it is empty, and are limited by two borders. The upper border or smaller curvature, short and concave, descends from the right side of the cardiac orifice and crosses the middle line to reach the pylorus ; to it the gastro-hepatic omentum and gastro-phrenic ligament are attached.

(Luschka.) The other border, the great curvature, is much larger and sweeps to the left from the cardiac orifice, then turns round below, and as it nears the pylorus, gradually approaches to the upper border; to it is attached the pendulous gastro-colic omentum. When the stomach is empty and contracted it descends for about two-thirds of its extent before curving to the right. In the dis- tended condition the surfaces are rounded out; the greatest vertical antero- posterior section is opposite the cardiac orifice, the part properly termed the fundus ; to the left of this there is a large hemispherical recess, tlie great cul- de-sac, sometimes, but improperly, called fundus; while to the right the diameter gradually diminishes. Near the pylorus the curve is completed, and a slight bend in the opposite direction distinguishes the antrum of the pylorus.

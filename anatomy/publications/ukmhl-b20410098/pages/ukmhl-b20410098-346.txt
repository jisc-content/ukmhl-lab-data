THE MUSCLES. 320 external plantar artery and nerve pass forwards and outwards as far as the base of the fifth metatarsal bone. The third layer is formed of short muscles specially connected with the great and small toes. They are confined to the anterior part of the foot. Those passing to the great toe, three in number, are in order from within outwards, the flexor hallucis brevis, the adductor hallucis, and the transversus pedis. At some little distance from these, underlying the fifth metatarsal bone, is the flexor minimi digiti brevis. Fig. 266.â€”Third Layer of the Muscles of the Sole. (L. Testut.) The interosseous muscles form the fourth layer. They occupy the spaces between the metatarsal bones and are seven in number, as in the hand, four dorsal and three plantar in position. Between the interosseous muscles and the short muscles of the great toe, the external plantar artery and the accompanying deep branch of nerve bend inwards in the sole, passing from the base of the fifth metatarsal bone towards the first interosseous space. Further back in the sole the tendons of the peroneus longus and tibialis posticus lie close to the bones. The supply of the muscles of the foot is divided between the external

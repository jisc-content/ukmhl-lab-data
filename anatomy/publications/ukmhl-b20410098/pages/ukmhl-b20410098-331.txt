MUSCLES OF LOWER LIMB. 305 Poupart's ligament, and is formed by a splitting of the fascia into two portions, an inner and an outer. The inner or pubic portion passes upwards and is attached to the first half-inch of the ilio-pectineal line, along the line of attachment of Gimbernat's ligament; traced outwards it is deflected behind the femoral vessels, becoming continuous with the posterior wall of their sheath, and covers the pectineus muscle. The outer or iliac portion of the fascia passes upwards to Poupart's ligament; its inner margin is sickle-shaped and forms the outer boundary of the saphenous opening. The sickle-shaped or falciform margin is divided into three regions—an upper and a lower falciform process, both well marked, flipper falciform process _ Femoral vein _ Internal saphenous vein Fig. 256.—The Saphenous Opening. and an intermediate portion, not so distinctly outlined, where there is a close connection between the fascia lata and the cribriform fascia, the layer of superficial fascia which immediately overlies the opening. The femoral sheath is formed, in its upper part, of a prolongation of the fascia transversalis and fascia iliaca of the abdominal walls. The artery and vein are contained in different compartments, separated from one another by a delicate septum, the vein being the more internal. Immediately internal to the vein, however, a third compartment, short, and ending in a blind pointed extremity, about half an inch below Poupart's ligament, contains a small lymphatic gland and some fatty tissue. A femoral hernia descends in this com23artment and, stretching the walls of the sheath, passes to the surface through the saphenous opening. u

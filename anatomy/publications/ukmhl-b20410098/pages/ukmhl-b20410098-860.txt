THE URINARY ORGANS. 762 pair of rays there may be seen on careful inspection, especially when the minute vessels have been injected or if a lens be used, scattered spherules, the Malpighian corpuscles. Fig. 596.—Cortex of Kidney. Semi-diagrammatic, a, Tubules and Malpighian corpuscles round medullary rays (constituting with them two pyramids of Ferrein); T>, afferent and efferent bloodvessels of Malpighian corpuscles, and the capillary networks. The free papillae of the Malpighian pyramids are each embraced by a single division of the excretory tube. Such a dilatation, called a calyx or Fig. 597.—Renal Structure Highly Magnified. A, Malpighian corpuscle, showing glomerulus, epithelium and capsule, embedded in convoluted tubules with turbid striated epithelium ; £, straight tubule with clear epithelium. li infundihulum, is attached at the base of the papilla to the renal substance, and narrows toward the summit, which it allows to look out by a small opening into one or other of two or three main divisions (larger calyces) of a dilated cavity, the pelvis. The pelvis may be as much as three-

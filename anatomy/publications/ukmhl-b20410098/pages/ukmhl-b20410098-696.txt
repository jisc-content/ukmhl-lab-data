598 THE BRAIN. by the decussation of fibres taking a more or less nearly horizontal course, with others more nearly vertical, and is continued up through the posterior part of the pons Varolii. In the lateral area the reticular formation has small nerve-corpuscles scattered through it, and is distinguished as grey^ while that in the anterior area is called white. Fig. 432.â€”Mkdulla OblonCxAta of Foetus of 8 Months. P, Pyramid as yet devoid of white svibstance ; 0, olive with accessory olives ; OC, olivary cerebellar fibres ; Pt (ponti- culus), ligula; IX, X, roots of glosso-pharyngeal and vagus ; A'l, sensory vago-glosso- pharyngeal root; Fs, funiculus solitarius ; Xm, motor vago-glosso-pharyngeal root bending round ; X'^, motor vago-glosso-pharyngeal nucleus (nucleus ambiguus); V, sensory root of fifth ; Villa, principal auditory root; Fid, posterior longitudinal bundle ; S, S^, median and lateral divisions of fillet; S^, interolivary part of fillet; PC, RC, inferior peduncle of cerebellum, (v. Kolliker.) The olivary nucleus (inferior olive or corpus dentatum) is a thin corrugated capsule or pouch of grey matter occupying the length and breadth of ] the olivary body, with white matter round about it and in its interior^ ^ and with a hilum or opening of the pouch directed inwards. It is ] characterized throughout by numerous multipolar corpuscles of small size. An outer and an inner accessory olivary nucleus are described behind and in front of it, and may be seen in transverse section. A superior olive, not much developed in man, consists of similar corpuscles above the principal nucleus, placed in the pons Varolii, behind the transverse fibres.

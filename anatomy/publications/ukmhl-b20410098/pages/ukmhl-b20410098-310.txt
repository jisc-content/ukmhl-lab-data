THE MUSCLES. ^84 The Interosseous Muscles. They occupy the spaces between the metacarpal bones, and are seven in number. Three of them, regarded as palmar, adduct the fingers towards the middle line of the hand; four, more dorsal in position, are abductors. The palmar muscles are placed in the three inner interspaces. Each lies along the side of one finger, springing from the metacarpal bone, and being inserted by tendon partly into the first phalanx at the lateral aspect of the base and partly behind into the extensor tendons. The first belongs to the inner side of the index finger, the second and third to the outer sides of the ring and little fingers respectively.

Each takes origin by two heads, one from each of the two bones between which it is placed, and except in the case of the first or abductor indicis, the larger head is derived from the bone belonging to the finger on which the muscle acts. Each tendon is inserted into the first phalanx in a manner similar to the method of insertion of the palmar muscles. The first muscle belongs to the outer side of the index finger, the second and third to the outer and inner sides respectively of the middle finger, the last to the inner side of the ring finger. Nerve supply of the muscles of the hand. These muscles are supplied by the median and ulnar nerves. The median supplies the abductor pollicis,

259 MUSCLES OF UPPER LIMB. Aponeurotic fibres are prolonged from the upper edge of the tendon to the •capsule of the shoulder-joint, and from the lower edge to the insertion of the deltoid muscle. The insertion is slightly overlapped by the anterior margin of deltoid. The external anterior thoracic nerve and a branch from the internal anterior thoracic enter the muscle on its deep surface. A small muscular slip, the sternalis muscle, is occasionally present on one or both sides of the body, lying upon the surface of the pectoralis major along the edge of the sternum. An additional slip along the lower edge of the muscle occasionally descends for some distance in the arm. The pectoralis minor arises from the outer surfaces and upper borders of the third, fourth, and fifth ribs near their anterior extremities. It is ISubclavins Pectonilis minor Short head of biceps and coraco-brachi- alis Subscapul; Pectoralis major / _ '--^^j 3, Long head of - triceps Pectoralis major j Internal ( intercostals Pectoralis major External intercostals C"''' Fig. 232.—Deep Pectoral Region. (L. Testut.) inserted into the inner border and upper surface of the anterior half of the coracoid process of the scapula. The insertion takes place by a flat tendon continuous at its outer edge with that of the short head of the biceps and the coraco-brachialis. The muscle lies under cover of the pectoralis major, and forms part of the anterior wall of the axilla. It is supplied by the internal anterior thoracic nerve which enters it on its deep surface. Occasionally some fibres of the muscle take origin from the second rib. The subclavius arises by a tendon prolonged for a little distance on the under surface of the muscle from the cartilage of the first rib. The

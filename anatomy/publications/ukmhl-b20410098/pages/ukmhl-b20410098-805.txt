707 THE SALIVARY GLANDS. the level of the upper teeth, and crosses the masseter immediately below the transverse facial artery to pierce the buccinator muscle and open into the mouth opposite the second molar of the upper jaw. It is large enough to admit a crow-quill, but is constricted at its orifice. At the origin of the duct the gland is prolonged on the upper border and some- times presents a distinct lobe opening separately into it, the 'pars socia pa,rotidis. The lobulation of the parotid gland is finer than that of the other salivary glands, and the lobules less easily dissected out from the tissue around. The membrana propria of the acini is delicate. The secreting corpuscles belong to the so-called serous group, being easily stained with carmine, and having spherical nuclei. The place of opening of the duct shows the parotid to be premandibular. the gland having been developed by ramification of the duct, while the submaxillary and sub- lingual glands are postmandibular. Fig. 538.â€”Salivary Glands. A portion of the lower jaw is removed. The mylo-hyoid muscle is seen in section, with the submaxillary gland embracing its free border, and the sublingual gland with Walther's ducts lying abo\ e it. The submaxillary gland is placed in the digastric space, between the base of the jaw and the digastric muscle. Its larger part is superficial to the mylo-hyoid muscle, and is of somewhat circular figure, more than an inch in diameter; but posteriorly it curves round the border of the mylo- hyoid muscle, and from this deep part, which lies beneath the mucous membrane of the mouth, the duct, generally known as Wharton's dud, is given off and passes forwards to open near the root of the fraenum linguae by a constricted orifice, on a papilla common to the two ducts of opposite sides. The facial artery crosses the gland near the back, more or less deeply embedded in it and furnishing branches to it. The lingual branch

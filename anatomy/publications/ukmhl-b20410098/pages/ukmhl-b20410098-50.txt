26 GENERAL ANATOMY. the surface pervade its whole extent, running nearly parallel with the surface, and united by oblique and transverse connecting branches into a network occupied throughout with minute bloodvessels. They are called Haversian canals, after Clopton Havers, who noted their existence in 1689, but was ignorant of their contents. They vary very considerably in size, but the greater number of those running longi- tudinally are about --^o^h of an inch in diameter, while the connecting branches are often smaller and may even be less than -27700^^ of inch. In the neighbourhood of medullary cavities or can- cellated tissue, larger Haversian canals are formed containing an arteriole and a venous radicle, but those in thor- oughly compact tissue contain only one minute vessel belonging to a capillary network corresponding with the network of canals. The sub- stance of the compact tissue is laminated; and in a transverse section of the shaft of a long bone the arrangement of the lamination is brought into view. The lacunae are seen to be arranged in concentric layers, and to be flattened in the planes of lamination with the greater number of their canaliculi passing outwards and inwards to com- municate with those in the layers adjacent; and several lamellae, even as many as six, may be counted between successive layers, Four kinds of lamina- Tifs^Es^T^rre?^^^^^ are distinguished, viz.: (1) the Hlv?Sn"infis!''Tbiw^^^^ ""^""^ peripheral or primary, surrounding the bone and parallel to the periosteum, most abundant in young bones; (2) the Haversian systems, forming concentric rings round the Haversian canals and composing much the larger part of the adult tissue; (3) the internal or perimedullary, lining Fig. 23.â€”Section of Ox Bone, showing nucleated bone- corpuscles, also anastomosing canalicnli in the outer rings of a Haversian system.

THE SPHENOID BONE. 215 wards through the optic foramen, accompanied by the ophthalmic artery. The optic foramen pierces the base of the orbital wing, and, continuous with its upper border, a smooth process of that wing projects backwards, the anterior clinoid process. On each side three marks indicate the course Olivai-y jprocess Pituitary fossa | Anterior clinoid process Fig. 201.—Sphenoid from behind. of the internal carotid artery, viz., posteriorly, a deep notch separated from the posterior border of the great wing by a thin process, the lingula; secondly, a carotid groove running forwards at the side of the sella turcica ; and thirdly, a concave margin internal to the anterior clinoid Sphenoidal sinus Malar margin Optic foramen | Sphenoidal fissure Frontal surface Fig. 202.—Sphenoid from the front. process and behind the foramen opticum. A spicule, the middle clinoid process, may be present internal to the groove, and reach up to the anterior clinoid process. Inferiorly, opposite the posterior edges of the pterygoid process, there is a transverse groove made by a rough ledge looking backwards, the attachment of the posterior wall of the pharynx.

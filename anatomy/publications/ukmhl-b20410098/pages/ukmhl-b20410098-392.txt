366 THE MUSCLES. posterior edges of the muscles reach backwards to the line of the tubercles. The anterior edges, in most cases, extend as far forwards as the line of junction of the bony ribs with the cartilages, but in the case of the first two or three fall a little short of, and in the case of a few of the lower reach a little further than this line. Continuous with the anterior edges, thin sheets of aponeurotic fibres, the anterior intercostal aponeuroses, extend to the extremities of the spaces. The internal intercostals are not so strong as the externals, and are formed of somew^hat shorter fibres, the direction of which is downwards and backwards. Each muscle springs from the cartilage and osseous rib, 3rd dorsal vertebra Fig. 288.â€”The Intercostal Muscles. (L. Testut.) along the line of the upper margin of the subcostal groove, and is inserted into the rib below, on the inner surface close to the upper edge. The anterior edges of the muscles extend to the extremities of the spaces, and the last two are continuous in front with the internal oblique muscle. The posterior edges do not reach further backwards than the line of the angles, and, beyond this, thin sheets of fascia, the posterior intercostal aponeuroses line the external muscles. Additional slips are frequently found in connection with the intercostal muscles. The name " supra-costalis" has been given to an occasional slip connected with the external muscles descending from the anterior extremity of the first rib over two or three interspaces. The "sub-costal muscles" are small variable muscular sheets placed on the inner surface of the

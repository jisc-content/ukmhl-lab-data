The internal saphenous nerve, in its descent, gradually approaches the femoral artery ; in the middle third of the thigh the nerve accompanies the artery in Hunter's canal, lying in front of it and a little to its outer side. When the artery passes backwards into the popliteal space, the nerve, continuing its straight course, descends on the deep surface of the sartorius, and finally pierces the fascia below the level of the knee,

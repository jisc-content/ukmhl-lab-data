220 THE SKELETON. the serrated upper border of the mastoid part: it arches upwards and forwards, forming with the parietal the squamous suture, and its outer table is prolonged considerably beyond the inner, as a thin scale with a fluted surface which looks inwards, so that the two parietals are grasped between the two temporals of opposite sides. In front of the parietal the free border articulates with the great wing of the sphenoid, and is directed downwards, and then obliquely backwards and inwards, becoming more distinctly serrated as it proceeds, till it ends by coming in contact with the anterior border of the petrous. From this point a fissure, the Jissure of Glaser, passes outwards to the front of the external auditorj^ meatus, and separates the quadrate surface for the temporo-maxillary articu- lation from the tympanic plate. The articular surface, in its hinder Arterial fissure ! - ; Fissure of Glaser I ' Fxternal anditory meatus Fig. 205.â€”Right Temporal from below. part, presents a hollow, elongated inwards and a little backwards, the .glenoid fossa, in which the condyle of the lower jaw lies when the mouth is closed, and in front a convex eminence on which it rests when the mouth is opened : at the outer end of this eminence there is a tubercle marking the attachment of the external lateral ligament; and in front of the Glaserian fissure, a postglenoid tubercle separates the glenoid fossa from the external auditory meatus. The external and anterior part of the articular surface lies beneath the obliquely folded origin of an elongated bar, the zygoma or zygomatic process, which curves outwards and forwards to form with the malar bone the zygomatic arch. The lower border of the zygoma is rough, giving attachment to the masseter muscle, and is con- tinuous with the eminence of the articular surface, sometimes spoken of as its anterior root ; the upper border is narrower than the lower, and is

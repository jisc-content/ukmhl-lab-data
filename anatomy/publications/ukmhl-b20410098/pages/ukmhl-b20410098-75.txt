They have each a large nucleus, round and clear, containing one or two distinct nucleoli capable of being stained very deeply with carmine.^ But perhaps the most remarkable character of nerve-corpuscles is the possession of one or more poles or branches. Corpuscles apparently apolar are often met with, but there is reason to believe that these are merely corpuscles which have had their poles torn closely off.

Corpuscles apparently unipolar occur in the invertebrata, with the pole continued into a single nerve-fibre; but the only known unipolar nerve-corpuscles in the mammal, those of the ganglia of the nerve-roots, are at an early stage of development bipolar, and subsequently draw their ^Nerve-corpuscles have recently been shown to exhibit differences of constitution and appearance, according as they have been at rest or in activity ; activity being accompanied by increased size of cell, nuclei and nucleoli ; rest by chromatic material in the cell, and fatigue by shrivelling of the whole structure and diffuse chromatic material in the nucleus (see Gustav Mann, Journal Anat. and Phys., October, 1894).

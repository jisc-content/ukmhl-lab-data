It is directed in its first part from the pylorus horizontally toward the right under cover of thr liver and gall-bladder, and invested like the stomach with the general peritoneum in front and the smaller sac behind. It then gets beyond the smaller sac and descends in front of the right kidney opposite the second and third lumbar vertebrae, and covered with peritoneum in front only. The remainder or third part turns to the left as far as the middle line, •crossing the inferior vena cava, and then proceeds almost verticall;y ■upwards in front of the aorta to end abruptly opposite the second lumbal' vertebra by being suspended in a constant position from the surface olj the left crus of the diaphragm by a long, broad and strong fibrous sheet Gastro-hepatic omentum Cut gall bladder Duodenvim, first part — Stomach = ■ —Splenic flexure .

This third part, beingj crossed first by the transverse mesocolon, and afterwards by the commence-! ment of the mesentery, is only in contact with the peritoneum between, these two structures, and in half the breadth of its ascending portion to the left of the mesentery. The common bile-duct and the pancreatic duct or ducts open on the posterior wall of the descending part of the duo- denum. The concavity of its curve is occupied by the head of the pancreas, and the arteries which supply it are the superior and inferior pancreatico-duodenal, one a branch of the hepatic artery and the other of the superior mesenteric. The jejunum and tlie ileum include the whole of that part of the small intestine which is connected by mesentery with the abdominal wall,

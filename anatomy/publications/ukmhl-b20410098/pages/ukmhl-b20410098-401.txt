MUSCLES AND FASCIA OF THE ABDOMEN. 375 muscle stretches between the anterior superior spine and the extremity of the first half-inch of the ilio-pectineal line, and further inwards is attached to the spine and crest of the pubis. With the lower margin of the aponeurosis are incorporated the other constituents of the anterior abdominal wall. When the thigh is extended, the fascia lata being uncut, some of the lower fibres of the aponeurosis of the muscle are brought into special prominence and give the appearance of a band stretching from the anterior superior spine to the spine of the pubis. The band thus made prominent is Pouparfs ligament; it forms an important surgical Pectoralis major Tendon of Fig. 293.â€”The External Ui-LKiiE Mlsclk. (L. Te.stut.) landmark. The great vessels which pass between the abdomen and the thigh lie behind Poupart's ligament, and by their inner side there is a small blind pouch into which a. protrusion known as a "femoral liernia " . occasionally occurs. The lower part of the anterior abdominal wall is traversed by an oblique passage, the inguinal canal, which transmits in the male the spermatic cord and in the female the round ligament of the uterus. The inner opening of the canal is known as the internal or deep abdominal ring, and is placed about half an inch above the middle of Poupart's

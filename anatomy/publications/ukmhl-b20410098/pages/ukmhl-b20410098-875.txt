THE TESTES, SCROTUM AND SEMINAL DUCTS. 777 which is as thick as the two other Uiyers put together. The mucous membrane exhibits mostly three longitudinal rugae, and has elongated non-ciliated columnar epithelium with elongated nuclei resting on a layer with spherical nuclei; but the sacculated terminal part has some special peculiarities, being thrown into shallow recesses lined with cubical epitheliun. The vas deferens is supplied by a special branch of the inferior vesical artery, which runs its whole length as far as the epididymis; and its nerves are derived from the inferior hypogastric plexus. Corpus spongiosum Fig. 60S.â€”Bladder, Prostate and Bulb, from behind. The vesiculae seminales are sacculated pouches folded together so as to form structures less than two inches in length, and about two-thirds of an inch wide, lying on each side against the bladder, immediately external to the vas deferens. The pouch may be as much as four or five inches long when unfolded, and has saccules of unequal length, some of which may even be branched. It is narrow at the outlet, but in its course its mucous mem- brane may be about quarter of an inch broad when slit open. Like the vas deferens, it is lined with non-ciliated columnar epithelium, and has circular muscular fibres with longitudinal bundles superficial and subjacent to them. The surface of the mucous membrane is reticulated like that of the gall-bladder, but more finely. Muscular fibres have been found

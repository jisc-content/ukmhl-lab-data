MAMMARY GLANDS. 799 THE MAMMARY GLANDS. The mammae, like the other organs connected with reproduction, are represented in both sexes. They are fully developed in the female only. Their representatives in the male are in no way altered or disguised, but simply arrested in development. Both in the virgin and in the male the nipples are on a level with the lower end of the body of the sternum ; and in the virgin they form with the depression between the clavicles an equilateral triangle. The glandular substance of the mamma is arranged in a circular disc around the nipple. It lies in the subcutaneous adipose tissue, which pene- trates more or less between its lobules. The integument on its surface is easily removed, as is also a firm layer of superficial fascia beneath the deep surface of the gland, while between its lobules the meshwork of connective tissue is abundant and tough, forming as it were shut locules. Hence it happens that superficial abscesses rise up easily and give little Fig. 626.—Section through Ckntre OF Mamma, parallel to base of nipple.

Both the circumference and the deep surface of the mamma are thrown into a number of large lobes consisting of smaller lobules or groui)S of ultimate acini, and these are lined with an epithehum of small cells which when active expand laterally, and subsequently in depth also, while both they and the interior of the acinus are filled with milk charactc-rized by its butericeous globules of different sizes.

THE MUSCLES. 390 to the sex. Many are inserted into the skin. The fibres of the levator ani which enter the rectal wall become intimately associated with those of the external sphincter. The superficial transverse muscle is a small muscular slip, very vari- able in size, and sometimes absent altogether, arising from the inner surface of the ischial tuberosity, and inserted into the central point of the perineum, where it is connected with the superficial sphincter ani and with the bulbo- cavernosus, or in the female sphincter vaginae. The bulbo-cavernosus, ejaculator or accelerator urinae muscle, of the male, invests the bulb and the posterior part of the corpus spongiosum. A median tendinous raphe belonging to the muscle and dividing it into lateral portions is continued from the central point of the perineum forwards on the under surface of the bulb, and from it the fibres springs the posterior being connected behind with the sphincter ani externus. The fibres of each side diverge from one another. The posterior, which embrace the bulb, are inserted into the under surface of the triangular ligament; the anterior, which embrace the hinder part of the corpus spongiosum, pass to a tendinous expansion on the upper or dorsal surface of that body. At the extreme anterior border of the muscle a few fibres are directed forwards on each side to the crus penis, which they join in front of the ischio-cavernosus muscle.

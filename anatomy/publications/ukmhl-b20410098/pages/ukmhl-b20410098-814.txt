THE DIGESTIVE ORGANS. 716 glauds lined with regular cubical epithelium surrounding a considerable lumen. At the summit of the valvular fold these glands suddenly ceasej villi and simple tubules at once begin, and the intestinal muscularis mucosae | starts close to the surface. Compound tubular glands containing large cells i are found close to the cardiac orifice where the oesophageal epithelium and papillae have not yet disappeared.^ Between the glands and towards the surface special collections of minute unwalled corpuscles are here and there scattered in the retiform tissue, sometimes uninclosed, and generally less distinctly bounded than the closed follicles of the intestine. These are the conglobate or lenticular glands of| authors, though other structures may have been sometimes confused withj them. Fig. 549.â€”Section of Injected Mucous Membrane of Stomach of Cat. Arteries j and arterial capillaries, black ; veins and venous capillaries, grey. (Toldt.) j The bloodvessels of the mucous membrane are arranged in such a mannJj as to secure the flow of pure blood through its texture. Immediately m 1A good deal of work remains to be done on the differences of the mucoj membrane of the human stomach in different parts and in different conditions, ^fl operations now sometimes performed may afford means for obtaining fresh niateM for such research. Meanwhile, the account by Edinger {Archiv. Micr. Anat., is probably as accurate as any, and I quite agree with the view there suggested that in the human subject the different sizes of corpuscles are probably differenj stages of one series. The glands of the pyloric valve have been confused wi|i Brunner's glands, but are quite different both in their relation to the musculalM mucosae and in their contents. The compound glands at the cardiac orifice wen noted and figured by Allen Thomson in Goodsir's Annals, 1850.

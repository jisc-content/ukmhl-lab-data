CAETILAGE. 23 Yellow or reticular cartilage is seen to most advantage in the epiglottis. It differs from hyaline cartilage in ha^dng within the matrix a deposit of elastic substance arranged more or less distinctly in felted fibres, with granules interspersed. This yellow deposit does not invade the capsules, and in preparing sections, an occasional capsule may be rolled out in front of the knife, leaving the space which contained it empty. This form of cartilage occurs in the human subject in the epiglottis, cornicula laryngis, Eustachian tube and the pinna of the ear. Fibro-cartilage. Under this name several tissues considerably differing one from another are usually described.

The capsules contain clear fluid, and are placed close together. ferred to in connection with the general anatomy of the articulations, under the heads of fibro-plates, incomplete joints, and intervertebral discs. Embryonic cartilage. In the early embryo, cartilage is at first nearly purely corpuscular, there being only sufiicient matrix to cement the cor- puscles together but no appearance of proper capsules. Capsular cartilage. Contrasting with the embryonic there is another kind of cartilage found particularly in the pinna of the ear in small mammals. It consists of empty capsules placed close together and con- taining no vestige of corpuscular substance. Xo such texture occurs in the human subject. BONE. Bone, or osseous tissue, is so termed from being the principal texture entering into the composition of the skeletal structures called bones. A bone is an organ in which there are also present other textures. It is permeated by bloodvessels; it contains marrow; it is surrounded by a

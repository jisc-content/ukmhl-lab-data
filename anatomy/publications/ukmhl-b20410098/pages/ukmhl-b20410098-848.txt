750 THE EESPIRATORY ORGANS. when not united adventitiously with them by the pathological breaking down of septa, namely, by emphysema. But the lobules are only to a limited degree separable in the adult, although those which abut against the surface can often be isolated to a much greater extent than usually supposed. They are pressed together so as to have flat sides and an irregular polygonal form, and their diameters may vary from a quarter to two-thirds of an inch. The bronchial tube of each lobule divides into smaller tubes or bronchioles supplying smaller lobules, which are composed Fig. 586.â€”The Lungs from behind, a, Trachea; b, branch of right bronchus for upper lobe of right king; c, arch of aorta united by obliterated ductus arteriosus to commence- ment of left pulmonary artery; d, left auricle receiving from each side the pulmonary veins ; e, middle lobe of right lung; /, g, anterior inferior angles of the two lungs ; h, h, groove where the aorta lies against the left lung ; i, groove where superior vena cava lies against right lung. of groups of ultimate lobules or infundibula. Each infundibulum consists of an ultimate or respiratory bronchiole, which may be as small as one-fiftieth of an inch, and expands into an irregular passage which dilates and is walled all round by hemispherical alveoli or air-cells. The alveoli have a framework of elastic tissue, specially strong at the edges which separate them one from another. Spread out in this framework is a single layer of large capillaries forming a close network, the capillaries being about one-thousandth of an inch in diameter and the meshes not much wider; and in the septa between the alveoli one layer of capillaries is exposed to the air on both sides. Lining the interior of the alveoli there is a single

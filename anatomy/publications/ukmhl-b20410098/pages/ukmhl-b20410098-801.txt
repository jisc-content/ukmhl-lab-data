703 THE MOUTH. of mucous membrane on its upper surface. It may be said to be based on the two genio-glossi muscles, already described, whose insertions extend from the tip to the hyoid bone and from the middle line to the lateral margins, so that their fibres are much spread. The other extrinsic muscles, namely, the hyo-glossi, the stylo glossi, and the palato-glossi take less part in the formation of the tongue, and their fibres do not become so scattered, but along with the linguales muscles and the bodies of the genio-glossi, make a firmer or cortical layer surrounding the main sub- stance of the tono'ue. o Posterior pillar of fauces Uvula r 1 Tonsil Anterior pillar of f vucc^ , ^ »>, Foramen caecum .

The intrinsic muscles are sets of fibres altogether belonging to the [ tongue, and take longitudinal, transverse and vertical directions. The I longitudinal fibres form two pairs of muscles, named superior and inferior linguales. The lingualis superior lies underneath the whole upper surface, and consists of fibres of much shorter length attached to the mucous ' membrane. The lingualis inferior lies beneath the outermost fibres of the i genio-glossus, where they are curved outwards, and internal to the insertion of the hyo-glossus muscle. The transverse and vertical fibres are nowhere collected into distinct muscles, but are diffused throughout their extent between the others; the transverse fibres extending outwards from the

25 BONE. just visible to the naked eye, for the entrance of bloodvessels from the periosteum; and these, when there is any considerable thickness of compact tissue, are sloped, and enter from elongated grooves running in one direction; but over cancellated tissue they are irregular in size, owing to some of them being larger, and they have not such obliquity. Near the articular extremities of the long bones of the limbs, on the posterior surfaces of the bodies of vertebrae, and in other situations, foramina of greater size occur for the exit of veins. Bones possessed of a medullary cavity present in addition a foramen in the shaft, constant in position, the arterial or nutrient foramen, containing for the supply of the marrow and adjacent walls of bone the so-called nutrient artery and a small vein. Fleshy origins of muscles cause no mark on bone, the muscular fibres being attached to the outer layer of the periosteum; but where tendon has been attached there is roughness and elevation, because the tendinous fibres are continuous with the substance of the bone. The articular surfaces of dry bones have a characteristic appearance, being composed of calcified cartilage (p. 22). Microscopic structure. In thin slices under the microscope, all bone exhibits a clear translucent calcified matrix, and in it lacunae and canalkuli. Lacunae are small spaces, each of which, in the recent state, is occupied by a single hone-corpuscle. Canaliculi are fine thread-like canals which come off' from the lacunae, sometimes in numbers fewer than a dozen, but in other instances, as in compact tissue in the adult, so numerously as to be un- countable. They are seen to advantage in ground sections of dry bone so mounted that the air with which they have become filled is not displaced. They then have ^^^J^^-ii^^^^S.^^ the appearance of closely set fine black "f^^^ f^'^^^^' ^^""^ ^^^^y^ branching lines continuous with the canali- culi of neighbouring lacunae, or opening on the surface, or into one of the canals about to be described, called Haversian. The lacunae vary in size and shape in different situations, but may measure on an average o^oVcr^^ moh in their longest diameter. The bone-corpuscles fill the lacunae in which they lie, and send branches into the canaliculi; but the branches do not appear to occupy the canaliculi permanently in their whole extent. Lacunae and canaliculi can still be brought into view after decalcification; and some observers have even been able to isolate them, showing that their walls are firmer than the rest of the matrix. Compact osseous tissue presents additional arrangements besides those Avhich are common to all bone and sufficient for fine spicules or laminae embedded in soft tissues.

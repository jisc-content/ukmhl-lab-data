THE REPRODUCTIVE ORGANS. 790 corresponding part in the male in forming one crescentic curve from side to side, instead of two which meet in the middle line. The vulva is limited externally by thickened margins, labia majora, continued back from the mons veneris; and internal to them presents two smaller folds, the nymphae, meeting together in front at the praeputium clitoridis. The labia majoi'a are rounded and filled out with adipose tissue from infancy till after the prime of life, and are liable to shrivel at a later period. Into them may be traced from above the deep layer of the superficial fascia of the abdomen and the round ligament of the uterus, which both become lost in the web supporting the adipose tissue, which is distinct from the adipose tissue of the thigh and hinder part of the perineum, and still more firmly separated from the nymphae. The points where the inner margins of the labia majora meet in front and behind are called the anterior and posterior commissures, and the posterior commissure has in the uninjured condition a bridle-like margin or fraenulum often called the fourchette. Fig. 616.â€”Female Genitalia. (Pansch.) The nymphae, or labia minora, are a pair of narrow tegumental folds internal to the labia majora. They meet together in front in connection with an erectile prominence, the glaus clitoridis, hid in a smooth depression within the anterior commissure. They bifurcate on approaching the glans, the upper division joining with its fellow above that structure to form the praeputium clitoridis, and the lower division meeting its fellow on the under surface of the glans to form the fraenum. clitoridis. The nymphae

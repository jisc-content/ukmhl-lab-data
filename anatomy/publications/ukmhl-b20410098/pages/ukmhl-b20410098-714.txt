The [ superficial aspect is in contact in its whole extent with a convolution | (gyrus fornicatus) of each hemisphere, and is from two-thirds to three- fourths of an inch broad. It has a transverse striation indicating the direction of its bundles, and has a few longitudinal marks, viz., in the Splenium or bom-relet Fig. 447.â€”Corpus Callosum from above. (Bouchard.) middle, a longitudinal furrow, divided by a mesial elevation, the rajjJie, best seen in front; to the sides of this, a pair of slightly wavy distinct white threads, nerves of Lancisi; and considerably further out, where the overhanging convolutions cease to be in quite close contact, a pair of grey lateral hands or striae. A grey coat or indusium, containing scattered multipolar corpuscles, a vestigial continuation of the cortex of the cerebral convolutions, though not very evident, covers the whole surface. The deep surface completes the roof and anterior limit of the lateral

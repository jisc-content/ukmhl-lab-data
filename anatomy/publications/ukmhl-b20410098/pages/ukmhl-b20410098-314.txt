288 THE MUSCLES. great trochanter or in its immediate neighbourhood. The gluteus maximus and tensor vaginae femoris are entirely superficial ; the gluteus medius is partially so; the others are deeply placed. The gluteus maximus, a large four-sided muscle, extending downwards and outwards, arises from the posterior fifth of the iliac crest and the small adjoining area of the dorsum ilii, from the lower part of the posterior layer of the lumbar aponeurosis, from the margin of the posterior surface of the lower half of the sacrum and upper half of the coccyx, and from the posterior surface of the great sacro-sciatic ligament; fibres also spring Gluteus medius covered by the fascia Fascia covering surface of gluteus maximus (reflected) Vastus externus covered by the fascia Semimembranosus | Long head of biceps Semitendinosus Fig. 248.â€”Muscles of the Hip, superficial layer. (L. Testut.) from the fascia on the deep surface of the muscle. The deeper fibres of the lower part of the muscle are inserted into the rough gluteal ridge of the femur, extending from the outer lip of the linea aspera towards the great trochanter. The remainder, forming the larger part, passes into the fascia lata of the upper and outer part of the thigh. At the insertion into the fascia the tendinous fibres cover the great trochanter, a large bursa being interposed; the lower margin of the muscle in sweeping outwards crosses the upper part of the ischial tuber- osity. On its deep aspect lie the upper part of the adductor magnus, the origins of the hamstrings, the quadratus femoris, and gemelli, and

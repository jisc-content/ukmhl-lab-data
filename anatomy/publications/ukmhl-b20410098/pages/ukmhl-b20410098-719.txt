WALLS AND SEPTA OF THE CEREBEAL VENTRICLES. 621 and terminating with an inclination inwards. Its floor presents a convex elevation, hippocampus major (cormi Ammonis), extending its whole length. This is the obverse of the sulcus termed hippocampal, and is separated by a groove from the posterior crus of the fornix and from the fimbria, which in turn has the choroid plexus entering at its free edge into the cornu. At its extremity the hippocampus is expanded somewhat, and has Corpus callosum Optic thalamus | Front of pineal body Nucleus caudatus I I j Pineal crus Descending cornu | | Fornix | | | Posterior white commissure Hippocampus major I | | I I I ' Transverse fibres of pons Gyrus dentatus I I I Pyramidal bundle Fimbria | | | Reticular substance of pons Uncus i Substantia nigra Hippocampal lobe Fig. 450.â€”Vertical Transverse Section, cutting the superficial part of the pons, but clear of the medulla oblongata. Looking forwards. three or four shallow notches on its convex edge, giving it a digitate appearance, whence it has received the name of pes liippocampi. The hippocampus major amd minor are united at their commencements; and the angle left between them as they separate is called eminentia collateralis or pes accessorius. VL THE CEREBRAL HEMISPHERES. The hemisphere-vesicle of the embryo becomes developed into two parts, the stem-part and the mantle (Reichert); the former a solid mass consisting of the corpus striatum and island of Reil, and the latter all the remainder of the hemisphere. ^ The corpus striatum and hemisphere ^ The olfactory lobe of the encephalon is not here mentioned. It is considered as part of the hemisphere by Schwalbe (1881) and Turner (1890), who include with it under the name rhinencephalon the bulbus hippocampi. Schiifer follows the course of including under that name the combined olfactory and limbic lobes; and undoubtedly if the bulbus hippocampi is to be included in the term, he is perfectly right in

The mucous membrane is destitute of villi, thinner, firmer and more glistening than that of the stomach. It presents, like the small intestine, straight secreting tubules extending down to the muscularis mucosae, and lined with columnar epithelium. The name of follicles of Lieberkuhn is sometimes extended to them. They are longer and more closely set than those of the small intestine. Closed follicles are scattered singly {solitary glands) over the surface. The bloodvessels and lymphatics are arranged as in the stomach.

The nerves of the great intestine come from the superior and inferior mesenteric plexuses, and form gangliated networks on the coats, similar to those in the small intestine. The caecum (intestinum caecum or caput caecum coli), the blind pouch below the ileo-colic valve, is situated in the right iliac fossa, opposite the

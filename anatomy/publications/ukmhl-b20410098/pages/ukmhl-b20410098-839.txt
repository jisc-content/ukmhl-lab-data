THE LARYNX. 741 nodules (cartilagines triticeae). The tliyro-hyoid membrane extends from side to side between the ligaments, and is perforated on each side by the superior laryngeal artery and nerve. In front of it, in the middle line, there is a bursa between it and the posterior surface of the hyoid bone ; it is pretty constant and may be prolonged linearly to near the thyroid cartilage. The crico-anjtenoid articulation is a synovial joint with a capsule and a strong triquetrous posterior ligament, whose fibres spread upwards and outwards. This joint permits two sets of movements, namely, angular movement, by which the arytenoid cartilages are raised and depressed, and rotation round a vertical axis, by which the vocal cords are brought together and separated. Thyro-; Fig. 576.â€”Antkrior Half of Larynx from Behind. (Pansch.) The siiperior and inferior thyro-arytenoid ligaments consist each of a small number of elastic fibres, the superior lying in the fold called the false vocal cord, and the inferior, more distinct, placed in the margin of the true vocal cord, strengthening the thickened upper border of the crico- thyro-arytenoid membrane already described. Laryngeal cavity and mucous membrane. The entrance into the larynx is bounded on the sides by the aryteno-epiglottidean folds, which stretch from the epiglottis, at its broadest part, to the cornicula laryngis. The cornicula incline over into the pharynx, and between them the edge of the larynx is depressed in the spout-like fashion which has earned to the arytenoid cartilages their name. The sides of this depression are bounded by two rounded little swellings caused by the cornicula, and two others beyond

MUSCLE. 41 with peculiarities special to it. But it may be noted that the con- tractions of the heart and the movements of the bird's iris are more sudden than those of unstriped muscular fibre, and that it is in this respect that striped muscular fibre differs distinctively in function from unstriped ; for it both begins to contract more immediately after stimula- tion and completes its contraction more quickly. Unstriped muscular fibres are generally disposed in continuous sheets, as when they surround hollow viscera, or in separate fasciculi, as in the erectors of the hair-follicles. Striped muscular fibres are arranged in fasciculi or bundles, which are occasionally disposed in sheets, as in the upper part of the oesophagus, and in subcutaneous muscles such as the platysma myoides in man, or the panniculus carnosus of animals; but are generally collected in more distinctly individualized muscles attached to bone, and either applied directly to the periosteum or fastened by the intervention of tendon. A muscle is, therefore, an organ into which other structures enter besides muscular fibres. Not only has it got one or more arteries and veins, a branch of nerve, and, in most instances, some tendinous arrange- ment ; but, in addition, it has its special investment or perimysium of con- nective tissue, and has its fibres arranged in fasciculi bound together by more delicate connective tissue, the endomysium of authors. The actions of muscles are modified by the manner in which their muscular fasciculi are disposed, the strength of their contraction depend- ing on the number of fasciculi which act together, and the extent of this contraction depending on the continuous length over which the fasciculi extend, no matter though broken by tendinous intersections. It follows that if two muscles have the same length and bulk, but one has its fibres running lengthwise, while the other has short fibres arranged obliquely between tendons of origin and insertion, so as each to repeat the action of the others, the first muscle will be capable of contracting to a great extent but with little force, while the second will maintain its contraction with great strength, but will be incapable of shortening itself to the same extent. Thus, for example, the semitendinosus muscle has long fibres, while the semimembranosus, lying beside it, has its fibres much shorter and more numerous; both are placed on the stretch when the trunk is bent down and the knees kept straight, and the semimem- branosus will be the more powerful in helping to raise the trunk; but when the origin and insertion of both muscles are approached by throwing back the thigh and bending the knee preliminary to delivering a kick forwards, plainly the long-fibred muscle, the semitendinosus, can alone be effective, the extent of contraction possible for the semimembranosus being unequal to shorten it to the extent that the semitendinosus can be shortened. Chemically, both striped and unstriped muscular fibres consist in greater part of muscle-fibrin, which during life is in the form called myosin, and after death is speedily changed in ordinary

775 THE TESTES, SCROTUM AND SEMINAL DUCTS. digitate, each projection in connection with ii nucleus ; the nucleus throws out a tail, and, with a certain amount of protoplasm adherent to it, becomes free as a spermatozoon. Small portions of protoplasm have been observed sometimes surrounding the head like a cap, or adherent in a mass to the neck of a spermatozoon in later stages of its existence. Fig. 606.—Section of Tubulus Semimferi s of Rat, showing genesis of spermatozoa. (Bolim and v. Davidoff after v. Ebner.) The tiibuli recti, into which the tubuli seminiferi pour their contents, are only about one-tenth of an inch in length, and are reduced to about one- fourth the diameter of the tubuli seminiferi. They are lined with a single layer of cubical epithelium, and open into the rete testis. The rete testis, occupying the whole length of the mediastinum, is, as its name implies, a network of communicating passages. These have no membrana propria, and are lined with simple squamous epithelium; they vary in diameter, |\ \ fv^" rr'^ but are larger than the tubuli recti, and convey the secretion to the upper and back part of the tunica albuginea, when it falls into the msa effe-rentia. The vasa efferentia and coni vasculosi, from about ten to sixteen in number, are about a thirtieth of an inch in diameter. Escaping from the tunica albuginea, the vasa efferentia become each one almost immediately coiled up into a separate cone. These roni vasculosi are each over a third of an inch in length with the base at the further end about a tenth of an inch in diameter; but, in proportion as the cone gets wider, the tubule of which it is composed gets narrower till it is reduced to about a sixtieth of an inch, where it ends in the epididymis independent of its neighbours, the Fig. 607.—Ducts of Testis. 1, Tubuli seminiferi ; 2, vasa i-ecta; 3, rete; 4, vasa efferentia; 6, 7, epididymis; 8, vas aben-ans; 9, vas deferens.

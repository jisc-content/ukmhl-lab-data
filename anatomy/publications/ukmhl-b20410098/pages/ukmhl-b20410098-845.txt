THE LUNGS. 747 The posterior surface is the longest, lying in the vertebral fossa and con- tinued gradually into the external and internal surfaces; and the greatest volume of lung is behind, immediately above the highest level of the diaphragm. The whole lung is invested with pleura except at the root and the part opposite the attachment of the broad ligament below the root (p. 686).

The root of the lung is the part where it is continuous with other parts, and consists of bronchus, right or left pulmonary artery and pulmonaiy veins, together with bronchial vessels and lymphatics and nerves. It is situated on the inner surface of the lung, nearer the back than the front, and above the middle. The phrenic nerve descends in front of it, and the pneumogastric behind it. The pulmonary veins emerge in front of the corresponding arteries and at a lower level, while the bronchus and bronchial vessels are behind. The right and left lung differ one from the other in the numljer of lobes.

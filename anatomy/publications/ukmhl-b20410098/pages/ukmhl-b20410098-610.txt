THE NERVES. 530 region. At the ankle it passes in front of the internal malleolus. Its terminal branches communicate with offsets of the musculo-cutaneous nerve, and ramify upon the inner side of the metatarsal region of the foot. THE SACRAL PLEXUS. The sacral plexus (Fig. 395) is formed by the union with one another of the lumbo-sacral cord (which results from the junction of the descending branch of the fourth with the fifth lumbar nerve), and the first, second, third, and a portion of the fourth sacral trunks. These are chiefly continued Fig. 393.—Diagram of the Sacral and Coccygeal Plexuses. 1, To pyriformis; 2, to qviadratus femoris ; 3, to obturator internus ; 4, cutaneous branch of fourth sacral; 5, muscular branch of fourth sacral; 6, T, muscular and cutaneous branches of coccygeal plexus ; 8, visceral branches ; 9, communicating branches with sympathetic. The great sciatic is represented as split up into its terminal branches. (J. Y. M.) into two nerves, the great sciatic above and the pudic below, but several subsidiary branches are also given oif. The great sciatic, the largest nerve of the body, is formed from the larger parts of the lumbo-sacral cord, and the first, second, and third sacral trunks; in it may be distinguished two portions, one more anterior which eventually becomes the internal popliteal nerve, the other more posterior destined to become the external popliteal nerve. The pudic nerve, much smaller than the great sciatic, is formed from portions of the third and fourth trunks, and frequently receives a fasciculus from the second. The subsidiary nerves are—the superior gluteal which springs from the back of the lumbo-sacral cord and the first sacral trunk; the inferior gluteal from the back of the first and second sacral trunks; the small sciatic from the back of the second and third sacral trunks; the nerve to the pyriformis from the second or third sacral trunk; the nerve

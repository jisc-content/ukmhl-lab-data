THE REPEODUCTIVE ORGANS. 786 with fluid causes it to follow the same law as governs other collections of fluid, and push aside the textures on the side on which there is least resistance.! The uterus, or womb, is a hollow organ reaching above to the brim of the pelvis, continuous above on each side with the Fallopian tubes, and opening below into the vagina. It is a pyriform body, with thick muscular walls which give it the firmness of a solid structure, and is in the adult and unimpregnated condition about three inches long, two inches broad, and one inch thick at the upper and broadest part. A slight concavity of the lateral outline about two-thirds down marks superfically the division into the hocly above, and the cervix or neck below; but the interior shows more clearly the distinction. The cavity of the body is triangular, with the anterior and posterior walls in contact, and with all Cavity of Body 1- Os externum Fig. 614.â€”Uterus, in vertical transverse section. three margins curving inwards, and has a perfectly smooth surface. Its upper angles taper to the Fallopian tubes, and represent the parts which are prolonged into cornua in many animals; and its lower angle is separated by a constriction termed os uteri internum, from the cavity of the cervix. The cavity of the cervix is limited below by another constriction, the OS externum, and has its walls circularly compressed. Its surface is marked by two longitudinal lines, one in front and one behind, from each of which ^ The ovaries were recognised as homologous with testes by Galen, and continued to be called testes muliehres till the time of De Graaf. Fallopius mentioned in the testes muliebres both clear vesicles and yellow bodies, but it was left for De Graaf to give a description of both, and to demonstrate that mammals had ovaries like oviparous animals, and that the Fallopian tubes received ova from them; while it was not until 1827 that the true mammaliam ovum was discovered by von Baer.

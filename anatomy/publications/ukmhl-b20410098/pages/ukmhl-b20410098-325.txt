299 MUSCLES OF LOWER LIMB. and the anterior surface of the patella, and is joined on its deep surface by the crureus tendon and on its margins above the bone by fleshy fibres from the vasti, and a little lower by their tendons which reach the lateral portions of the upper border of the patella and the lateral patellar regions of the knee capsule. A large bursa communicating with the joint lies underneath the common insertion. From the lower margin of the patella the ligamentum ^patellae passes to the anterior tubercle of the tibia. Adductor lougus Rectus femoris Sartorius I Gracilis Adductor magnus Fig. 254.—Inner Side of the Knee. (L. Testut.) The rectus femoris arises by two very short, strong, tendinous heads— one, the reflected tendon from the rough mark on the upper and outer border of the acetabulum, the other, the straight tendon from the anterior inferior iliac spine. These unite with one another at an angle of about 45 degrees, and form a rounded tendon. The muscular belly occupies the middle three-fifths of the thigh, but consists of short oblique fibres stretching from the tendon of origin which passes downwards for some distance in the muscular substance to the tendon of insertion, which is prolonged upwards on the deep surface. The origin is deeply placed, being covered by the iliacus and gluteus minimus and crossed by the sartorius; the rest of the muscle is superficial.

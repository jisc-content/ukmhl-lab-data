The spine strikes backwards from the dorsum, arising by a line between the middle division of the vertebral border and a point separated by a broad groove from the back part of the articular head. From the outer end of this line a smooth concave border is directed backwards and upwards, while from the inner end there slopes a broad superficial border, more elevated as it extends outwards, till it arrives over the other, when both spread out and Fig. 141.—Right Scapula FROM Above. «, Supraspinal fossa; 6, superficial mar- gin of spine ; c, acromion ; (/, glenoid fossa; e, neck; /, angle outside the suprascapular notch where the coracoid process changes its direction ; g, rough attachment of coraco-clavicularligament; h, insertion of pectoralis minor muscle ; k, i, origins of coraco-brachialis and short head of biceps.

The superficial border of the spine begins at the base of the scapula by a smooth triangular area, over which glides the flat tendon of the lowest fasciculi of the trapezius muscle as it passes outwards to be inserted into a rough mark which lies across the border, beyond the triangular area. Outside this the upper edge of the superficial border of the spine and, continuous with it, the inner edge of the acromion are rough and give attachment all along to

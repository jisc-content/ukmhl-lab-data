THE SKELETON. 226 a lamina curved at its free edge, the superior turbinate process ; and a similar but more curved lamina, the inferior turbinate process, not only fo rms the floor of the superior meatus, but extends forwards the whole length of the bone, its free edge descending as low as the uncinate pro- cess, and roofing the middle meatus of the nose. Between the uncinate process and the fore part of the inferior turbinate process, a passage, the infundihulum, passes up from the middle meatus, through the anterior ethmoidal cells, to open into the frontal sinus. THE SUPERIOR MAXILLARY BONE. The maxilla, maxillary or superior maxillary bone supports the teeth of the upper jaw in sockets or alveoli, sunk in a projecting ridge, which com- C4roove of anterior Groove of posterior palatine canal palatine canal Fig. 210.â€”Right Maxillary, internal and posterior view. pletes an arch with its fellow, and is called the alveolar process or dental margin. Within this arch the palate plate extends backwards, and more externally the bulk of the bone rises up, presenting a facial, a zygomatic, an orbital and a nasal surface; while it sends a frontal (or nasal) process upwards to the cranium, and a malar process outwards. The palate plate falls considerably short of the hinder end of the dental margin, and articulates behind with the palatal bone. It is vaulted and rough inferiorly, and on its upper or nasal surface is smooth, and thrown into a longitudinal furrow by the rising up of the mesial border, which is vertically fluted where it unites with its fellow, and in the hinder part of its extent makes with it a mesial ridge articulating with the keel of the vomer. But in front, above the dental margin, the mesial border is expanded upwards, and is separated from the part behind by an interruption which, in

THE LIVER. 731 extends upwards and backwards over the liver and the opposed surface of the diaphragm, thus forming a septum, the falciform or suspensory ligament, whose hepatic attachment corresponds with the division of the inferior sur- face into right and left lobes. The other peritoneal connections of the liver are the coronary and right and left triangular ligaments, and the attachment of the gastro-hepatic omentum (p. 689). The inferior surface presents a number of fissures and lobes. The longi- tudinal fissure, dividing it into a right and a left lobe, extends from front to back, and consists of two parts, an anterior, the fissure of the umbilical vein, and a posterior, distinguished as the fissure of the ductus venosus, and also giving attachment to part of the gastro-hepatic omentum.

Behind : the right extremity of the portal fissure is the groove or fissure of the inferior vena cava, separated from it by a narrow elevation. The portal fissure is i the site of attachment of the part of the gastro-hepatic omentum containing structures entering and emerging from the liver. The structures in question enter and emerge at its extremities and are the right and left branches of I the hepatic artery, the right and left branches of the portal vein, the right I and left hepatic ducts, together with nerves and lymphatics. At the left t end of the portal fissure the obliterated umbilical vein ends in the left branch of the portal vein, and the obliterated ductus venosus starts from the same point to go backwards and upwards to join the inferior vena cava.

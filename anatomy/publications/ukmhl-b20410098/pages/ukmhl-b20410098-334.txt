THE MUSCLES. 308 ANTERIOR REGION OF THE LEG. The muscles of the anterior region of the leg are the tibialis anticus, the extensor hallucis longus, the extensor digitorum pedis longus, and the peroneus tertius; but the last-mentioned is small, and is regarded as a portion of the extensor digitorum longus. In the upper fourth of the Tibialis posticus Tibia Fibula longus Fig. 258.â€”Insertions of Tendons in the Sole, semi-diagrammatic. (L. Testut.) leg the tibialis anticus, the most internal of the group, lies in contact with the extensor digitorum longus, their fibres being separated only by an intermuscular septum. Lower down, the extensor hallucis longus intervenes between them; but this muscle, smaller than those between which it is placed, is at first overlapped and concealed by them, and only becomes apparent on the surface, between their tendons, in the lower third of the leg.

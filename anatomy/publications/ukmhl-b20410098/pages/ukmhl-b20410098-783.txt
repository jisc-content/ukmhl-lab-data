685 THE THORACIC CAVITY. tinguished, and behind is the posterior mediastinum, in which the oesophagus is placed. The pericardium consists of two membranes, a fibrous and a serous. The Jihrous pericardium is a strong white fibrous bag, widest below, where it is attached to the central tendon of the diaphragm, in front and behind to its margin, and on the right side external to the opening for the vena cava inferior, while on the left side it encroaches on the muscular fibres. Superiorly it is connected with the outlets of the pulmonary veins, and Fig. 520.â€”Sagittal Section of Thorax and Epigastrium of Frozen Body of Infant \h YEARS old. 1, 2, 3, Sternum ; 4, 5, diaphragm ; 6, its central tendon ; 7, right lung crossing the mesial plane ; 8, thymus ; 9,10, trachea and left bronchus ; 11, 12, oesophagus and aorta in posterior mediastinum ; 13, pericardium ; 14, right auricular appendix; 15, left auricular cavity ; 16, right ventricle ; 17, ascending aorta; 18, right pulmonary artery; 19, left innominate vein; 20, innominate artery ; 21, liver; 22, pancreas ; 23, stomach. (Luschka.) also with the vena cava superior and the pulmonary artery, but its strongest fibres are prolonged high on the front of the ascending aorta. The serous pericardium presents a parietal and a cardiac part. The parietal part clothes the tendinous surface of the diaphragm, and lines the fibrous pericardium. The cardiac part is continuous with the parietal by two distinct folds, one of which invests the ascending aorta and the pulmonary artery in a tubular sheath, while the other, behind, separated from the arterial sheath by a passage called the transverse sinus, is connected with the great veins and with the auricles, namely, with the right edge of the right auricle between the superior and the inferior vena cava, and with the upper edge of the left auricle between the right and left superior pulmonary veins, as has been more particularly described at p. 409.

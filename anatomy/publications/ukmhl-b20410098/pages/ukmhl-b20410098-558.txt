THE VASCULAR SYSTEM. 492 remain distinct from one another. They soon lose their direct connection with the sinus and join the right and left branches, respectively, of the portal vein, and their blood passes to the heart through the liver. A little later the right umbilical vein disappears, and from the left, at the place of its connection with the left portal vein, a new trunk, the ductus venosus, passing upwards to the right hepatic vein, is developed, and carries the most of the blood from the placenta to the heart. The left hepatic vein, in turn, loses its connection with the heart and falls into Right duct of Cuvier Right umbilical vein Vena cava inferior Right vitelline vein Venae revehentes (hepatic veins) Venae advehentes / Left umbilical vein \ (round ligament of liver) Intestinal veins Portal vein Left vitelline vein Intestinal veins Fig. 368.â€”Diagram to Illustrate the Development of the Portal System of Veins. The original veins which remain permanent are represented in black, those which disappear in outline. Veins later in appearing are shaded. Veins which remain as impervious cords are dotted. (After His.) (J. Y. M.) the ductus venosus. With the development of the lower limbs the inferior vena cava appears, and joins the cardiac end of the ductus venosus. After birth, the left umbilical vein becomes a solid cord, the round ligament of the liver, passing to the left branch of the portal vein; from the posterior part of the left portal vein, the ductus venosus, which likewise becomes impervious, stretches to the inferior vena cava. The systemic veins (Fig. 369). The primitive jugular veins which receive the blood from the cranial cavity and form the upper branches of the ducts of Cuvier, represent in the adult the external jugular veins; they are joined near their cardiac extremities by the subclavian and internal jugular Right umbilical vein Right vitelline vein

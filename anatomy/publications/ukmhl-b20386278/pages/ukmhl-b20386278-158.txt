114 HITMAN ANATOMY AND PHYSIOLOGY, LESSON XIV. THE ORGANS OF SENSE, The organs oe sense are those curiously formed instru- ments, connected with the nervous system, through which all our knowledge of external objects is conveyed to the brain. We have five different organs of sense; namely those of liearing, seeing, smelling, tasting, and touching; the first four belonging to the head, and the last being distributed over the whole surface of the body. Each of these organs is admirably fitted for receiving the impressions peculiar to its nature; which, being made on its minute nervous filaments, are transmitted to the brain by means of the large nerve connected with it. The impressions of form, colour, sound, odour or touch, thus conveyed to the brain, are termed sensations; and if deeply impressed, so as to be retained in the memory, they are called ideas. Perhaps the most important of all our organs of sense is that of hearing; as without that our race must have been mute, no language could have been formed, no know- ledge propagated, nor could experience have ever been transmitted to benefit society. The organ by which we become acquainted with every variety of sound is the ear, the air being the medium by which the vibrations or undulations of sound are conveyed to it; and without air sounds cannot be heard.

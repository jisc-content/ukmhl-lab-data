3 THE BONES. LESSON II. THE BONES. The hard bony frame-work of the human body is called the skeleton. This structure is admirably formed for voluntary1 motion, as well as for protecting the most important organs within the body. It is divided by anatomists into three principal divisions, called the head, the trunk, and the extremities; each division being composed of a great number of bones articulated to- gether, and firmly united by means of sutures,2 cartilage,3 or strong ligaments.4 The extremities are joined to the trunk by what are called ball and socket joints,5 but most of the other movable joints are termed hinge6 joints. Bones are of various and peculiar forms combining lightness with great strength. They derive their nutriment from the blood, and are therefore provided with arteries, veins, and nerves, though these are few in number com- pared with many other parts of the body. 1 Voluntary, dependant on the will. 2 Sutures, seam-like joinings as in the skull. 3 Cartilage, a gristly substance covering the end of bones, but sometimes placed between them as in the bones of the spine. 4 Ligaments, white fibrous bands for binding parts together. 5 Ball and socket joints, like a cup and ball, giving great freedom of mo- tion, as at the shoulders and thighs. 6 Hinge joints, as at the elbows and knees.

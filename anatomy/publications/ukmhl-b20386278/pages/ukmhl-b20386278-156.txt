112 HUMAN ANATOMY AND PHYSIOLOGY. The ninth pair, or the lingual nerves, are the principal nerves for producing the different movements of the tongue. The thirty-one pair or spinal nerves branch out on each side of the spinal cord; each nerve having a portion of its roots proceeding from the back part of the cord, and another portion from the front part. The back, or sensitive, roots, in passing from the spinal cord, unite and form a small knot, or ganglia, but the front, or motor roots do not, but merely unite â€¢ the two branches formed by these roots, as they pass through the openings of the vertebrae, unite and form the body of the nerve. The nerves so formed separate again, on the outside of the ganglia, into two branches ; one going to supply the back part of the trunk, and the other the front part and ex- tremities. The spinal nerves are known as the eight cervical, twelve dorsal, five lumbar, and six sacral nerves. From the upper and lower portions of the spinal cord, where the nerves branch off to supply the extremities, a number of them unite and branch into each other, so as to form a kind of net-work, called a plexus of nerves. The four lower cervical and first of the dorsal nerves unite to form what is called the brachial plexus; from which, among other important branches, proceed the nerves for supplying the upper extremities ; distinguished as the median, radial, and ulnar nerves. The dorsal nerves, as they proceed from the spinal cord, separate each into two branches, one going to suppy the skin and muscles of the back, and the other the intercostal muscles. The lumbar and sacral nerves also unite to form plexuses, from which, among other branches, proceed the nerves for

HUMAN ANATOMY AND PHYSIOLOGY, 98 LESSON X. NUTRITION, &c. Digestion and Circulation are, as described, two great means of preparing and purifying the blood, so as to afford Nutrition to the body—Secretion is a farther means of separating and elaborating from the blood various materials necessary for the wants of the system—Absorption is the process by which such materials are gathered up and taken o the parts required—and Excretion that by which waste a id j ernicious particles are thrown out of the body. In the young the different tissues, or minute parts of different organs, have to be enlarged; and this constitutes what is called growth. But in addition to this there is a continual waste of the different particles of the body, both in young and old; the amount of such waste being prin- cipally dependant on the health of the person, and the use and exercise of his different powers. The health, again, seeming to depend upon the purity of the blood, and the rapid changes that are effected in the different tissues by exercise; both mentally and bodily. The blood, by such exercise, being impelled more rapidly through the system, not only more speedily removes waste and decaying particles from the tissues in its passage, but by a greater quantity of it vigorously flowing through the lungs it receives a larger supply of oxygen to stimulate and nourish; thus imparting to mind and body the warm glow,the buoyant feeling, and mental pleasure, which we call health. The blood when pure contains all the elements necessary

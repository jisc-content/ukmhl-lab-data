THE BUAIN AND NERVOUS SYSTEM. Ill have their origin within the skull; the first pair proceeding from the brain itself, and the other eight from the upper and expanded portion of the spinal cord connected with the brain. The first pair, or the olfactory nerves, are the nerves of smell; the minute branches of which are spread out over the lining membrane of the nose. The second pair, or the optic nerves, are the nerves of sight; their branches being spread out on the innermost membrane of the eye-ball, called the retina. The third pair, or the common motor nerves, are nerves supplying the chief muscles that produce the movements of the eyes. The fourth pair, or the trochleares, are two small motor nerves, supplying the upper muscles that roll the eyes in their sockets. The fifth pair, or the trifacial nerves, are the two great sensation nerves of the head and face ; each of them sending off three large branches to different parts. The sixth pair, or the abducentes, are two small motor nerves, supplying the external rectus muscles of the eyes. The seventh pair, or the auditor 1/ nerves, consist each of two portions; one distributed over the membrane in the interior of the ear, being the nerve of hearing, and the other leading to the side of the head and face, being a nerve of motion. The eighth pair, or the pieumo-gastric nerves, may each be considered as three separate nerves, as they each rise from three roots. They are both sensitive and motor in their functions ; they have branches distributed to the root of the tongue, the pharynx, larynx, lungs, heart, stomach, and some of the muscles of the neck.

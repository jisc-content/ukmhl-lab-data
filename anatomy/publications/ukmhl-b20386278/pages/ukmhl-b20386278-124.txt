80 HUMAN ANATOMY AND PHYSIOLOGY. This contrivance consists in the epiglottis (the little cartilaginous valve at the root of the tongue) turning down over the passage of the wind-pipe in the act of swallowing ; the entrance itself at the same time spontaneously closing. When the stomach is empty it is comparatively small, contracted, and motionless; its mucous lining hanging somewhat loosely, and presenting a soft velvet appearance of a light pink colour. But no sooner has the morsel swallowed passed the cardiac opening of the stomach than the parts it comes in contact with become immediately excited. The pink colour changes to a deep red, by the flow of blood into the vessels, and the muscular fibre thus stimulated causes the muscu- lar coatings of the stomach to contract; that is their fibrous cords, arranged the lengthway and crossway of the stomach, produce what is called the vermicular, or peristaltic motion; a motion slow at first, but increasing in activity as digestion proceeds. At the same time the whole organ is thus stimulated, the folds of the mucous lining contract upon the food, the gastric juice begins to be secreted, and mixes with it, and continues to flow until the ordinary contents of the stomach are digested. The food, after entering, revolves slowly round the stomach, from the large end to the small, and back again, till the mass is dissolved; the stomach successively grasping and breaking it up, and the contractions at the same time going on, cause every particle of the food to come in contact with the gastric juice. The fragments of the food, being thus gradually softened, and finally converted into a soft, greyish mass, are detached from the harder, or indigested portions, and on reaching the

Tt is, however, not merely the change, but the peculiar arrangement of the different particles that excites admi- ration ; the new nutritious elements being deposited ac- cording to the texture of the various parts which they supply ; forming the dense bone which supports—the con- tractile fibre which moves—the nerves which stimulate— and the hair of the head destitute of feeling. Nutrition having been effected, or the blood having parted with some of its life sustaining constituents while flowing in the arterial capillaries, this fluid gradually loses its bright scarlet colour; and, while coursing its way back to the heart in the venous capillaries, acquires the peculiar purple hue of venous blood. The name, however, of capillary or hair-sized vessels, conveys but a very imperfect idea of their exterme minute- ness ; for in comparing a hair with the smallness of some of them, it is like comparing the trunk of a tree to its minute branches. Such then is the extreme minuteness of the capillary vessels, that, what might be thought, a very trifling cause will impede the circulation of the blood within them; and thus not only check nutrition, but prevent noxious matters in the blood from being excreted. Externally they are greatly affected by heat and cold, the former increasing and the latter impeding their circu- lation ; and the more so when the body is exposed to any sudden chill. Internally their circulation is impeded by any alteration in the character of the blood; whether arising from injurious substances taken into the body, or by noxious impurities not being removed out of it.

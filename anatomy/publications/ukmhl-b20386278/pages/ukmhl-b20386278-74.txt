HUMAN ANATOMY AND PHYSIOLOGY. 3G LESSON XIII. ABSORPTION. Absorption is the process by which the nutritive1 and waste materials of the body are taken up and conveyed to the parts required; as well as the process by which useful or pernicious2 substances are taken into the circulation. Nutritive matter, such as the chyle, is take up or ab- sorbed by a set of vessels called the lacteals, and by them is conveyed to the mesenteric glands, and is finally emptied into the thoracic duct. The worn out particles in different parts of the body are taken up by another set of absorbents,3 called the lymphatic vessels, and glands; the absorbed matter, called lymph, is likewise emptied into the thoracic duct. Lymphatic vessels are minute transparent tubes accom- paning the blood-vessels in their course through the body. They branch freely into each other but generally maintain the same size throughout; and, like the lacteals, transmit their contents through small bodies called the lymphatic glands. The lacteal and lymphatic vessels are each called absorbents. But, in addition to these special organs of absorption for the removal of old and the introduction of new materials, 1 Nutritive, affording nourishment. 2 Pernicious, injurious to health. 3 Absorbents, organs for absorbing.

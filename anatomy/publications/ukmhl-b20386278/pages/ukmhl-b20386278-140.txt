> 96 HUMAN ANATOMY AND PHYSIOLOGY. The change effected by the air on the blood is by a chemical process, depending on the mutual affinity of two elements. The air we breathe is composed of four parts of nitrogen and one part of oxygen, with a minute portion of vapour and carbonic acid. When this compound enters the air vesicles of the lungs, the oxygen of the air, having an affinity for the carbon in the blood, penetrates inwards through the lining of the air vesicles, and uniting with the blood changes its carbon into carbonic acid, which, penetrating outwards through the coats of the vesicles, is expired from the lungs. The blood thus freed from carbon, and charged with oxygen, at every inspiration of the lungs is conveyed on- wards by the blood-vessels into every tissue of the body; and by its active combination with the waste and carbon- aceous parts of the blood generates heat throughout the system. As the lungs differ in size, in different individuals, so does the quantity of air that they are capable of containing; but the lungs of an adult man are estimated to contain from ten to twelve pints. The quantity taken into the lungs at every inspiration also varies, according to the effort made, but in an ordinary inspiration, without exertion, it is sup- posed to be about a pint of air. The heart is said to contract four times while we breathe once; and, as an adult person in good health breathes about eighteen times in a minute, the quantity of air conveyed to the lungs daily is supposed to be about fifty-seven hogsheads. The quantity of carbonic acid expelled from the lungs is somewhat in proportion to the air inspired â–  the quantity expelled daily, if concentrated, is supposed to amount to from seven to fourteen ounces of solid carbon, in addition to

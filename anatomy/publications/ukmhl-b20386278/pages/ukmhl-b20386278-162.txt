ANATOMY AND PHYSIOLOGY. HUMAN 118 eye; where, crossing each other, they diverge to form a small reversed picture of the object upon the retina. This re- versed picture, in its transmission to the brain, is supposed to be rectified by some mental experience, so that we see the object erect, instead of reversed. To add to the efficiency of the eye, as an instrument of sight, the power of moving it in all directions is afforded by means of six small muscles; four2 of them to move it upwards, downwards, inwards, and outwards, and two3 others to roll round it in its socket. To shield and protect so delicate a structure, from in- jury, we find many wonderful contrivances provided. We find it set in a strong bony cavity, the interior of which is lined with a soft fatty substance on which it moves. We see that the eye-brows above form a hairy embank- ment, to ward off the sweat of the brow. That the eye- lids form a divided curtain, shutting with the rapidity of thought on approaching danger, while their lashes by their fanning movements prevent the intrusion of annoying par- ticles. But, that should these chance to enter, we find the lachrymal* gland instantly sending down the flow of tears to wash out the impurity, the fluid which on other occasions keeps the eye constantly bright and clear. We perceive the pupil instantly closed to exclude an excess of light, and to expand when more is needed. And finally at night, when rest is required for so active an organ, 2 The Rectus superior. 3 The Obliquus superior, or The Rectus inferior, Trochlearis, and The Rectus internus, The Obliquus inferior.

85 THE HEART AND BLOOD VESSELS. of the heart, is an opening, with a curiously constructed valve called the tricuspid valve; serving as a flood-gate to admit of the blood flowing down in the proper direction, but effectually preventing its return. There is also a simi- lar aperture in the division on the left side of the heart, with a valve for the same purpose, called the mitral valve. The mouths of the two principal vessels of the heart are also provided with what are called semi-lunar valves. The vessels for conveying the pure, or arterial blood, from the heart, to afford nourishment to all parts of the body, are called arteries. The vessels that bring back the impure or venous blood, from different parts of the body to the heart, are called veins * There are also a set of vessels attached to the heart for conveying the blood to and from the lungs. The large vessel which conveys the impure blood from the right ven- tricle of the heart to the lungs, to be purified, is called the pulmonary artery; it having two branches, one leading into each lung. When the blood is purified, in the lungs, it is conveyed back to the left auricle of the heart by means of the four pulmonary veins; two proceeding from each lung. The main trunk, or chief branch, of the arteries is called the aorta. This large tube has its opening in the left ven- tricle, from which compartment it rises upwards forming an arch over the top of the heart; then passing behind it, it proceeds downwards, sending off branches in its course, till it finally separates into two large trunks, one going into each thigh. Prom the arch of the aorta there are sent out two1 large 1 The Carotid Arteries.

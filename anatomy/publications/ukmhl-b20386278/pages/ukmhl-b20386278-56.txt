22 HUMAN ANATOMY AND PHYSIOLOGY. LESSON VIII. THE ORGANS OF CIRCULATION. The organs for circulating the blood through the body are the heart, arteries, and veins, the minute1 branches of the two latter being called arterial, and venous capillaries. The heart is a strong muscular bag, of a conical2 form, situated in the lower portion of the chest, its broad part about the centre, inclining backwards, and its point inclining a little to the left side. Its interior is divided into four compartments,3 the two upper ones called auricles, and the lower ones ventricles. It is also provided with ingeniously constructed valves,4 to prevent the blood from flowing otherwise than in its right course. The heart is kept in its right position, during the move- ments of the body, by means of the pericardium, a mem- braneous bag in which it is enclosed, as well as by the dif- ferent vessels to which it is attached. The vessels in, which the pure blood is conveyed from the heart are called arteries, and those by which the impure blood is brought back to the heart are called veins. The large branch of the arteries, proceeding from the heart, is called the aorta, and the two large branches of the veins, leading to the heart, the upper and lower vena cava. 1 Miwde, small or slender. 2 Conical, in the form of a cone. 3 Compartments, chambers or divisions. 4 Valves, membraneous constructions for admitting the blood to pass, and for preventing its return.

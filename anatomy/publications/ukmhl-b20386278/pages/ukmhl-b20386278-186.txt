142 HUMAN ANATOMY AND PHYSIOLOGY. granulous, or full of small brown tubercles, while its sur- face is covered with small hard prominences, is called, the " hobnail'd or " gin-drinkers liver" ; from its being so com- mon among drunkards. In hot weather, and in hot countries, all these diseases are aggravated; by reason of the atmosphere being so rari- fied that the same volume of air does not contain the same quantity of oxygen to burn off the excess of carbon which intoxicating drink occasions. The kidneys, being like the liver depurating organs, are subject to similar inflammatory and degenerating diseases, from the use of intoxicating drinks ; such as enlargement and change of structure, granular deposit, and general de- rangement. From their impaired functions, as well as from mineral and acid substances combined in different drinks, serious diseases of another description arise, such as gravelly deposits and stony concretions in the bladder; diseases exceedingly dangerous, and accompanied with pain of the most intense nature. These last diseases are common among wine and porter drinkers. Diseases of the lungs, both acute and chronic, are also prevalent among those who indulge in intoxicating drinks. Consumptive disease is induced by a vitiated state and obstructed circulation of the blood ; such as is produced by strong drinks. An inflammatory state of the lungs is fre- quently occasioned by the acrid nature of the blood, and the fumes of the drink, irritating the delicate lining of the air vesicles and bronchial tubes; rendering the whole organs highly susceptable of changes of temperature, and conse- quent disease. And nervous affection, and diminished action of the lungs, are produced by the pernicious effect of alcohol on the nerves of respiration.

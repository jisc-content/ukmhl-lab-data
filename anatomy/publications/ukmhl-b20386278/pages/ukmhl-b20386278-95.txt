THE BONES. 51 somewhat of a semi-circular form ; they are united behind to the spinal column by exceedingly tough ligaments, and are attached to the breast-bone in front by a strong gristly substance called cartilage. They unitedly form the hollow- cavity of our bodies called the thorax, or chest, and are so united as to move upwards and downwards with every breath we draw. The five lower ribs, on each side, being first united to each other by separate bands of cartilage, and these attached to the breast-bone6 by a single band, are called false ribs, to distinguish them from those which, being fixed singly to it, each by a separate band of cartilage, are called true ribs. The two shoulder-bones, to which the arms are attached, are two7 large triangular bones buried in the muscles of the shoulders, and extending from the second to the seventh ribs. At the large angle of each of those bones is a cup-like cavity, into which the round portion of the arm-bone is in- serted to form what is called a " ball and socket joint " that is, a joint capable of being moved in almost every direction. The collar-bones, one8 on each side, extend from the large angle of the shoulder-bone to the top of the breast-bone, to which they are firmly attached, for the purpose of affording greater strength and support to the shoulder and breast- bones. The four9 pelvic, or kip-bones, unitedly form the basis of the trunk, in the hollow cavity of which are contained a B The breast-bone, or Sternum. r The two shoulder-bones, or Sca- pluae. 8 The two collar-bonesj. or Clavicles, The Pelvis is formed of the two Innominata, the Sacrum, and the Coccyx, or point of the spine.

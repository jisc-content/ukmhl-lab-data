158 HUMAN ANATOMY AND PHYSIOLOGY. Noxious substances taken into the body, whether by the lungs, stomach, or skin, produce their prejudicial effects on the system according to their nature. Poisonous effluvia and noxious gases, absorbed by the lungs, are almost instantly commingled with the blood; hence the sudden effect so frequently produced on persons breathing them; and hence also the agues and fevers occa- sioned by persons breathing putrid vegetable and animal exhalations. Noxious matters taken into the stomach are varied in their effects; some are immediately expelled by its reverse action, others violently stimulate and inflame the whole course of the stomach and intestines, while others are ab- sorbed into the system, and disease and stagnate the whole mass of blood. Putrid substances, absorbed through a slight wound in the skin, have been known to deprive animals of life in a few hours ; and from a similar cause many medical men have lost their lives in dissection. The infliction of bloios and injuries on the body is often the cause of disease, and not unfrequently of sudden death. Blows on the face have often led to the loss of the nose, and to the deprivation of sight. When inflicted on the skull have frequently produced apoplexy, have often in- jured the mental powers, and at times caused raving mad- ness. Sudden blows on the pit of the stomach have often proved fatal; when inflicted on the breast have often occa- sioned cancerous tumours, while blows on the abdomen have often produced ruptures of the stomach and bowels. But of all sources of disease, from external injury, none have been productive of greater evils than those occasioned by the compression of the lungs, and the other vicera, by

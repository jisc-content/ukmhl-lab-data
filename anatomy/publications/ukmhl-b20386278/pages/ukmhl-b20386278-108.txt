64 HITMAN ANATOMY AND PHYSIOLOGY. LESSON III. THE SKINâ€”ITS FUNCTIONS. The skin is the tough elastic membrane enveloping the external portions of the body; serving to keep the various muscles in their position, to pass off some of the excretions, and to protect from cold and injury the innumerable blood- vessels, nerves and glands, spread out under its surface. This covering is also called the cutaneous membrane, to distinguish it from the mucous membrane, which is continu- ous with it, but which passes inwards to line the internal cavities and organs of the body; as well as from the serous membranes, which envelope or cover most of the internal organs. The skin is composed of three distinct layers one over the other, the outer one called the cuticle, or scarf skin, the middle layer the retr mucosum, or mucous network, and the under one the cutis, or true skin ; though some physiologists consider the middle, or mucous layer, as belonging to the one beneath it. The cuticle, or outer skin, is a thin semi-transparent membrane, which, being destitute of nerves, can be cut or pierced without pain. It is thickest on the palms of the hands and soles of the feet, and becomes thicker on any part of the body in proportion as this is subject to pressure. It consists chiefly of albumen1 in a solid state, and is of the 1 Albumen, the substance which forms the serum of the blood, the white of eggs, &c.

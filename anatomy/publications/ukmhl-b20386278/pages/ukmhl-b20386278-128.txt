HUMAN ANATOMY AND PHYSIOLOGY. 84 LESSON VII. ORGANS OE CIRCULATIONâ€”THE HEART AND BLOOD-VESSELS. The heart is the forcing apparatus which impels the blood through the body. This it does by its compartments contracting and distending alternately; forcing out about two ounces of blood at each contraction, and contracting from sixty to eighty times every minute. The heart is a strong muscular bag, of a conical form, situated in the lower portion of the chest between the two lungs. It lies somewhat obliquely, with its base or broad part about the centre, leaning towards the spine, and its point forward inclining a little to the left side. It is kept in its position partly by the vessels belonging to it, and partly by the bag in which it is enclosed being strongly attached to the diaphragm, on which it rests. This membraneous bag, called the pericardium, is much larger than the heart; admitting of its freedom of action, while at the same time it secures it in its place, and pro- tects it from the injury it might otherwise sustain by the varied movements of the body. A fluid is also secreted in the interior of this bag for preventing the ill effects of friction. The interior of the heart is divided into four compart- ments ; the two upper ones called the right and left auri- cles, and the two lower ones the right and left ventricles. In the division, between the compartments on the right side

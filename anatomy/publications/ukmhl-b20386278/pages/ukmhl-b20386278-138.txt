94 HUMAN ANATOMY AND PHYSIOLOGY. smaller ones, till at last they terminate in clusters of minute membraneous cells, called air vesicles. These air vesicles are said to be about the hundredth part of an inch in diameter, and so numerous that were the whole of their membraneous linings spread out they would occupy a surface equal to thirty times that of the body. The trachea, and its larger branches, are always kept open for the admission of air by means of little rings of cartilage ; and the smaller branches by means of a fibrous elastic kind of membrane. This is an important provision of nature; for, were the air shut out from the lungs for the space of only three or four minutes, death would be the result. Another beautiful arrangement is seen in connection with this. The tube for the admission of food into the stomach is attached to the back of the trachea, and if the rings of cartilage extended round the tube they might so press upon the food-pipe as to interfere^with the passage of its contents ; this, however, is effectually guarded against by the rings, in this part only, going about tioo-thirds round. The vessel for conveying the venous blood from the right ventricle of the heart, to the lungs, is the pulmonary artery; one of its branches entering each lung. In the lungs these branches divide into smaller and smaller branches, accompanying the bronchial tubes throughout the lungs, till at last their capillary extremities are spread out in a minute net-work over the surface of the air vesicles. The vessels for bringing back the purified blood from the lungs, to the left auricle of the heart, are the four pul- monary veins; the capillary extremities of which are con- tinuous with those of the pulmonary arteries of the lungs. The other organs of respiration, which produce the move- ments of the lungs, are the ribs and muscles on each side of

HUMAN ANATOMY AND PHYSIOLOGY. 90 The colourless fluid, called the liguor sanguini, holds, either in suspension or solution, a very important element of nutrition, namely the fibrin of the blood; which separates from the watery parts when coagulation takes place. By coagulation is meant that property which the blood of a healthy person has of clotting, when it has been removed from a vein or artery. That is of separating into two dis- tinct parts, the one a light straw coloured liquid called the serum of the blood, and the other part red and solid called the clot; the latter being a net work of the fibrous particles of the blood having the red globules contained in its meshes. This coagulating property of the blood seems to depend on the fibrine contahied in it, and on that the health of the body; for blood deprived of its fibrine will not pass into the minute capillary vessels. This property of congulating is also a beautiful provision of nature for stopping the effusion of blood in cases of cuts and wounds, as well as for heal- ing them ; for the clot of blood on the edges of a wound speedily becomes full of minute organized vessels, which serve to re-unite and heal the wounded part. "When the blood is analysed, it is found to contain about twenty-five different substances, animal and mineral; but the fibrine of the blood seems to be the chief element for nourishing and renewing the different organs of the body. The organs of circulation having been described, the manner in which it is circulated or distributed throughout the body will now be understood. Supposing the current of blood to have imparted its nutritive properties to the different tissues of the body, and to have coursed its way back to the heart to be purified, it is poured by the two chief branches of the veins, called the

139 INTOXICATING DRINKS. the muscles relaxed, the power of voluntary motion weaken- ed, and the whole system thus affected by the noxious poison causes the body to reel to and fro in drunken helplessness. In this state of prostration the drinker may be said to have lost all proper self-control, the brain being either irri- tated into madness, or drowned in stupor; if the former, the symptoms are perceived in his distorted features, dilated eye, irrascible temper, and tongue thickly uttering its impre- cations of rage and madness;â€”and if the latter, his bewil- dered head, stupid brow, and utter helplessness of body cause him to sink to rest in a lethargic, and too often in an apoplectic sleep. These last being the effects of the poison, ivhen diffused throughout the system, it may be well to trace the manner in which it is supposed to operate on the different organs of the body, so as to produce such intoxicating results. The alcohol taken, being rapidly absorbed by the ves- sels of the stomach, acts immediately upon the blood, dimin- ishing its red globules, and causing its fibrine to be less coagulable; by which means the blood becomes darker and thinner, and less fit for nourishing the body. But alcohol not only injures the general quality of the blood in this way, but, being diffused throughout the body, it also robs the arterial blood of its oxygen in its course from the lungs. This it does by its carbon having so great an affinity for oxygen that it penetrates the coats of the arte- ries to combine with it; by which means the whole mass of blood gradually becomes more and more of a venous quality, and less and less capable of affording nutriment to the different tissues of the body. The blood, being thus altered in its properties, will not so readily penetrate the minute vessels of the body, by

HUMAN ANATOMY AND PHYSIOLOGY. 150 Snuff takers are also subject to frequent inflammations of the head and eyes from colds; the hot acrid nature of the tobacco causing the pores of the skin to be unduly ex- tended, in order to pass off its noxious properties, render them extremely susceptible of colds. The constant secretion and drain of the fluids, which snuff-taking occasions, also cause the cheeks to become pre- maturely furrowed, and the skin and muscles of the eyes wrinkled; while the absorbed particles embrown the nose, render the face sallow, and disfigure the whole features. But the use of this irritating and poisonous powder is not only thus injurious to the health of those who take it, and highly offensive to those who come in contact with them, but calls, in an especial manner, for the reprobation of the public against it. For, when it is considered that the habit of snuff-taking is indulged in by thousands who are employed in the manu- facture of our daily bread, and various articles of diet, as well as by vast numbers who cook and prepare our food, and when we reflect on the poisonous and disgusting particles that must often be blended with what we consume, it excites our loathing against the abominable practice. In thus stating some of the evils attendant on these filthy habits, it may be necessary to impress upon the minds of the unreflecting, who, in public and private, thoughtlessly dose their noses with snuff, and puff their pipes and cigars to the injury of their own healths, and to contaminate the air which other people are compelled to breathe, that the sum spent upon tobacco and snuff, in this country alone, amounts to upwards of seven millions and a half annuallyâ€”a sum which, if wisely applied, would enlighten and bless thousands of their brethren, and save thousands from pauperism and crime.

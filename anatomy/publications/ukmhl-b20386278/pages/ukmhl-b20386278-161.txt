THE ORGANS OF SENSE. 117 The iris has a small hole in its centre for the admission of light, called the pupil of the eye, and this hole can be con- tracted or expanded by means of the delicate muscular fibres of which the iris Is formed. It is the iris that gives the eye its colour, being of different hues in different individuals. The retina, or inner coat of the eye, is a delicate pulpy membrane in which are expanded the filaments of the optic nerve, and by which the image, or visual impression of every object, is conveyed to the brain. Within the three coats of the eye are contained three different kinds of transparent matter called humours; which by their peculiar nature, construction, and arrangement, transmit the impressions of objects to the retina. They are known as the aqueous, the crystalline, and vitreous humours of the eye. The aqueous, or watery, humour is situated in front of the eye, filling up the space from the cornea to the crystalline lens; the iris floating in it. The crystalline humour is a transparent hard jelly-like substance, in the form of a double convex lens, situated immediately behind the iris; and imbedded in the humour behind it. The vitreous humour fills up the back, and by far the greater portion, of the eye. It is an extremely transparent substance, a little thicker than the white of an egg, enclosed in a film-like membrane. The eye, thus constructed, perceives objects presented to it by means of a very minute picture of them being first formed upon the retina. The rays of light, passing from the object, are refracted by the cornea and aqueous humour, and converge towards a point in the crystalline lens of the

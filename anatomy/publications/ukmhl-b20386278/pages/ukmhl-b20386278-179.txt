135 DIET. Of these drinks, however, we ought to be careful not to take too large a quantity, as tending to overtax the secre- tory organs ; nor swallow them too hot, as tending to weaken the mucous lining of the stomach. Of the kinds of teas, black is to be prefered; the green, being highly stimulating to the nerves, should be avoided as a common drink. Cocoa also forms a very nutritive and refreshing drink, and, from its oily nature, is to be prefered for keeping up the heat of the system in cold weather. Milk is not only excellent as drink, but is also highly nutritious as food; its curd being of a nature to afford nourishment to the tissues of the body, while its cream or buttery particles afford heat-producing food. Milk, thus combining the two essentials of food, and easily digested by the healthy stomach, is excellent for children ; and in the first nine months of their existence little more is required by them. Those persons, however, who have weak stomachs cannot well digest it. Of the comparative digestibility of various kinds of food, much must depend on age, constitution, and state of health; for the same person, in some circumstances, will take twice the time to digest the same kind of food as in others. The following estimate, however, of the time required for digesting different kinds of food, is taken from experi- ments made on an adult person in good health.3 Rice, tripe, sago, and milk, take from one to two hours to digest—mutton, beef, pork, lamb, bread, potatoes, soft- boiled eggs, chicken, cod-fish, and oysters, from two to three hours—and cheese, carrots, turnips, salt-beef, veal, sausages, clucks, and fowls, from three to four hours. 3 On Alexis, by Dr. Beaumont of Canada.

The cheat is covered on each side with four16 large muscles, two of them for drawing the arms towards the chest, and two for giving support to the shoulder and for assisting in forced respiration. The interior of the chest is separated from the abdomen by means of a thin muscle called the diaphragm, which, with the ribs, and the muscles17 between them, form the principal apparatus for expanding the chest in breathing. The abdomen is covered with five18 pairs of muscles, their use being to draw the ribs downwards, bend the chest upon the abdomen, and compress the cavity of the bowels. The muscles of the extremities are those of the shoul- ders, arms, and hands ; and of the thighs, legs, and feet. The arm, at the shoulder, is raised and moved in its various positions chiefly by means of eight19 powerful muscles; the chief, and most important one, on the shoulder, five others rising from the back and shoulder bone, and two from the chest. The arm is flexed, or bent, at the elbow, by means of 18 The Pectoralis major, The Pectoralis minor, The Subclavius, The Serratus magnus. 17 The Intercostales externi, The Intercostales interni, The Levatores eostarum, The Triangulares sterni. 18 The Obliquus abdominis externus, The Obliquus abdominis interims, The Transversals abdominis, The Eectus abdominis, The Pyramidalis. 19 The Deltoides on the shoulder.

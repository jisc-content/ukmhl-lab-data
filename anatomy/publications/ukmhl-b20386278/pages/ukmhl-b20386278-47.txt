THE ORGANS OF DIGESTION. 1 5 LESSON VI. THE ORGANS OP DIGESTION. The organs of digestion are the mouth, teeth, tongue, salivary glands, the pharynx, the esophagus, the stomach, the duodenum, the liver, the pancreas, the small and large intestines, the lacteals, the mesenteric glands, and the tho- racic duct. The month is the cavity formed by the cheeks, jaws, and palates. The teeth are thirty-two in number, sixteen in each jaw i they are distinguished as incisor,1 canine,2 and molar3 teeth. The tongue is made up of six muscles, well provided with blood vessels and nerves, and supported at its base by a small bone of a horseshoe4 form. The salivary glands5 are six in number, three on each side of the mouth. The pharynx is the large cavity on the top of the eso- phagus, down which the food passes into the stomach. The stomach is a strong muscular bag, something in the form of a bagpipe, and capable of containing about three pints of food. It is situated in the upper part of the ab- domen, chiefly on the left side. The large end on the left side by which the food enters is called the cardiac end, and 1 Incisor, teeth cutting like a scissors. 2 Canine, teeth tearing like a dog. 3 Molar, teeth grinding like a mill. 4 The Jiyoid bone. 5 The salivary glands, for secreting the saliva or spittle.

31 RESPIRATION. LESSON XL RESPIRATION. Respiration, or breathing, is the process by which the air1 is brought in contact with the blood so as to purify it, and at the same time to keep up the animal heat of the body. The blood is purified by the oxygen of the air combining with the carbon2 contained in the venous blood, and forming the carbonic3 acid gas which we pass out of the lungs in breathing; the nitrogen of the air also passing out in the form of gas. The heat of the body seems to be generated by the oxygen of the air combining with the carbon of the blood, much in the same manner as the heat of the fire is kept up by the oxygen of the air combining with the carbon of the fuel. When we inspire, or take air into the lungs, the diaphragm presses down upon the abdomen, and the inter- costal muscles at the same time raise the ribs, thus enlarging the cavity of the chest so as to obtain a sufficient supply of air. The reverse movements take place when we expire, or expel the air from the lungs. At the moment of inspiration a stream of venous blood 1 The Air, is composed of four parts of nitrogen gas, and one of oxygen, and a small portion of carbonic acid gas. 2 Carbon, of the nature of pure charcoal. s Carbonic acid gas, carbon and oxygen chemically combined,

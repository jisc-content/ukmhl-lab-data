RESPTRATION. LESSON IX. THE ORGANS OP RESPIRATION.â€”RESPIRATION. The Lungs are the chief organs of respiration, or breath- ing ; by which process the air is brought in contact with the blood, for the purpose of purifying or changing it from dark venous, into arterial, or bright red blood; as well as for combining with certain elements in the blood in order to develope the animal heat necessary for ^keeping up the warmth of our bodies. The lungs are two spongy bodies, somewhat conical in form, situated one on each side of the chest, with the heart between them; they^being kept in their position by means of the pleura, the membrane in which they are enclosed. They extend in height from the first rib to the diaphragm, and, together with the heart, nearly fill up the cavity of the chest. The right lung is the larger, and is divided into three lobes, the left lung having but two. The substance of the lungs consists of bronchial tubes, air-cells, blood-vessels, nerves, and glands; the whole con- nected together by a net-work of fibrous tissue. Nutrition is afforded to them by means of arterial branches leading from the aorta ; two of these going into each lung. The organ by which the air is conveyed to the lungs is the trachea, or wind-pipe; which, on entering the chest, separates into two branches, called the right and left bronchus, one going into each lung. In the lungs these branches divide into two branches, and each of these into smaller and

6 HUMAN "ANATOMY AND PHYSIOLOGY. LESSON III. THE MUSCLES. The muscles of the body in our ordinary language are called flesh. They are those fleshy, fibrous1 cords and layers which are attached to the bones, for the purpose of moving them iu different directions; and are of different forms according to the bones they are required to move. They are generally arranged in pairs, and almost every muscle has its antagonist, or opposing muscle. Muscles are mostly thick and fleshy in the middle, and they gradually become thinner and tendinous2 towards the ends â€¢ the parts by which they are attached to the bones. They are made up of a great number of little fibrous bundles of flesh, each bundle being enclosed in a sheath membrane,3 so that they may all move freely one over the other ; and every fibrous thread is supplied with blood ves- sels and nerves.4 The muscles move the bones by being contracted or shortened by the the influence of the nerves. That is when the brain desires any limb to be moved it makes known its will to the nerves, the nerves immediately cause every fibre of the muscle to contract or shrink from both ends towards Fibrous, made up of small threads of flesh or other substances. Tendinous, composed of whitish fibrous cords, such as are seen m a cow-heel. Membrane, a thin delicate layer. Nerves, small white cords, being the medium of commutation with the brain.

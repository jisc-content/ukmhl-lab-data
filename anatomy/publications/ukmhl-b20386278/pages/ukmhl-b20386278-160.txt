116 HUMAN ANATOMY AND PHYSIOLOGY. The undulations of sound, striking the external ear, is by it collected and transmitted inwards to the membraneous drum of the middle portion of the ear; the vibrations of which are taken up and conveyed, by the chain of bones and muscles, to the labyrinth; and from that by the nervous filaments and auditory nerve to the brain. The next organ of sense, the most wonderful in its con- struction and extensive in its range, is that of sight; con- veying to the brain the radient glory of the heavens and the myriad beauties of earth in a glance. As the air is the medium of sound to the ear, so is light the medium of sight to the eye; which may be said to be an optical instrument of the most perfect description, taking cognizance of the forms, colours, and proportions of all objects within its ken. The globe of the eye is a spherical body, about an inch ai diameter, enclosed in three membraneous coats, called the sclerotic, the choroid, and the retina; having also a circular transparent projection in front called the cornea. The sclerotic or outer coat is a tough fibrous membrane, the front portion of which is covered over with a thin tendinous expansion of the muscles, forming what is called the white of the eye. The transparent projection in front, called the cornea, is set in a groove in the sclerotic coat some- what like a watch-glass in it case. The choroid coat is an exceedingly vascular membrane, containing the chief arteries and veins for affording nutri- tion to the eye. Its exterior surface is of a deep brown colour, and its inner surface of a deep black, for absorbing the scattered rays of light. Connected with it in front is a thin membrane called the iris, which is extended across the eye immediately behind the cornea, like an inner curtain.

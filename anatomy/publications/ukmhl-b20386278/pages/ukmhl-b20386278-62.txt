The left auricle immediately contracting forces the blood down, through a small valve,3 into the left venticle, which also contracting forces it up into the aorta, by which it is con- veyed to the different arteries of the body. The blood, being thus distributed by the arteries into smaller and smaller branches, is conveyed at last by the arterial capillaries' to every minute part of the body. Here the blood begins its wondrous work of nutrition; that is it builds up, out of the same fluid, bone, muscle, fat, nerve, brain, and every other substance of the body. By this process a portion of the nutritious elements5 is extracted from the blood, and the waste matter combining with it causes it to become what it called venous or impure. These small venous or impure streams in their way back to the heart enter into the venous capillaries (which are continuous with the arterial capillaries), and these convey it into larger and larger branches till at last it is again emptied by the two vena cava into the right auricle of the heart; to be again circulated in the manner described. The veins of the intestines, however, first pour their contents into a large trunk called the vena porta by which the venous blood is distributed throughout the liver to form the secretion6 called bile before it is emptied into the vena cava. 3 The Mitral valve. 4 Capillaries, hair-sized vessels.

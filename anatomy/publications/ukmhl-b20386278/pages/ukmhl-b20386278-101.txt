THE MUSCLES, 5? from the both ends towards the middle, by which means the limb to be moved is drawn towards the fixed point to which the muscle is attached. The muscles, like the bones, are divided or classified into those of the head, trunk, and extremities ; but as one set of muscles are sometimes attached to two of those divisions the classification is not so distinct. The muscles of the head are those of the skull and face. The skull has one1 broad thin muscle expanded over it, for the purpose of moving the scalp of the head and giving expression to the forehead. On each side of the skull are three2 small muscles, for moving the external parts of the ears ; as also the attachments of the large muscles of the lower jaw. The muscles of the face comprise those of the jaws, eyes, nose, and lips ; as well as some of the attachments of the muscles of the neck. The jaws are moved in all their directions by means of five3 pairs of muscles ; some of them of exceedingly great power. Each eye has six4 curiously constructed muscles attached to different parts, for moving it in all the variety of positions of which we are capable. There are also two5 muscles be- 1 The Occipito-frontales. 4 The Rectus superior, 2 The Altollens aurera, The Attrahens aurem, The Retrahens aurem.

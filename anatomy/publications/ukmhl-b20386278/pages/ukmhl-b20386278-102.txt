There is likewise a small muscle,6 on the arch of each orbit, for drawing the eyebrows towards the nose, as is seen in persons frowning. The nose has four7 muscles attached to it, which, with the cartilaginous parts, give it form and expression ; two of them are for dilating and one for compressing the nostrils. The lips are principally formed by the oval8 muscle which encircles the mouth, enclosed in the outward skin and inner membrane; they are open and shut, contracted and drawn in all their various positions, by means of nine9 different muscles on each side. The muscles of the trunk are those of the back, neck, chest, and abdomen. The bach is covered with six different layers of muscles, each moving freely one over the other. The deep-seated are the smallest and most numerous, and are adapted for giving support and motion to the neck, back, and ribs.

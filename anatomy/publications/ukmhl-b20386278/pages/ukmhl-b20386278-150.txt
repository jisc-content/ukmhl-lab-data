106 HUMAN ANATOMY AND PHYSIOLOGY. The skin is proved to be absorbent, as various medical substances are often passed through it, especially by friction \ and when its cuticle is removed they are found to be still more rapidly absorbed. It is by this absorbent function of the skin that vaccina- tion and inoculation are effected—that putrid and poisonous matter is rapidly absorbed through the slightest wound— that nutritious substances given in baths are often absorbed through the skin, sufficient to keep patients alive when food cannot be otherwise administered—and that thirst is often alleviated at sea, by persons dipping their clothes in salt water. The lungs are also highly absorbent, as noxious fumes and impurities in the atmosphere are instantaneously intro- duced into the current of blood, through the delicate mem- brane of the air vesicles. It has been often proved that air, contaminated with putrid and decaying vegetable and animal substances, breathed into the lungs, as well as when these are otherwise absorbed into the system, generates fevers, agues, dysenteries, and other virulent diseases. The blood vessels are proved to be absorbent, as poisonous substances, dropped on their surface, will contaminate the mass of blood more readily than if taken into the stomach and bowels; as the mucous fluid in the latter organs some- what delay the power of absorption. It has also been shown by experiment that fevers and other disorders, more or less virulent, are engendered by minute portions of putrid matter being introduced into the circulation of the blood. Different membranes of the body are also absorbent, as is shown in cases where fluid matters, having found their way into the large cavities of the body, have been rapidly absorbed.

2'4 HUMAN ANATOMY AND PHYSIOLOGY. DESCRIPTION Or THE ORGANS OF CIRCULATION. PLATE 6. 1. The chief organ of circulation, or the Heart. 2. The chief branch of the arteries, or the Aorta. 3. The branches of the aorta for supplying the head and neck, or the Carotid arteries. 4. The branches supplying the upper portion of the trunk, &c, or the Sub- clavian (a) and Axillary arteries (6). 5. The Axillary arteries in the arms become the Brachial arteries (<?). 6. The Brachial divides and forms the Radial (d) and the Ulnar arteries (e). 7. The Palmar arch, sending oif branches to supply the fingers. 8. The branches of the aorta to supply the heart itself, or the Coronary arteries. 9. The branches to supply the muscles and organs of the chest, or the Thoracic arteries. 10. The branches to supply the diaphragm and organs of the abdomen, or the Abdominal arteries. 11. The branches to supply the kidneys, or the Renal arteries. 12. The aorta^ dividing forms the Iliac arteries, supplying the lower portion of the trunk. 13. The Iliac entering the thighs become in their course the Femoral (/), and and the Popliteal {g). H. The Popliteal in the legs divide into the Front and Back Tibial (k) (*), and the Peroneal (J). 15. The branches of these in the foot form the Inner and Outer Plantar ar- teries (Je) (/). 16. The trunk of the superior Vena Cava, or the upper chief branch of the Veins. 17. The Inferior Vena Cava, or the lower chief branch of the Veins. THE SIDE DIAGRAMS. a. Shows the structure of the Parotid gland, the secretory cells emptying their contents into the Salivary Duct. h.

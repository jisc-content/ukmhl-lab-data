7'J THE PROCESS OF DIGESTION. LESSON VI. THE PROCESS OE DIGESTION. Digestion comprises those curious and complicated opera- tions by which the food we take into our mouths is converted into blood; or nutriment for promoting the growth, and sup- plying the waste of our bodies. The first process which the morsel of food undergoes is that of mastication, or chewing, while, at the same time, it is being insalivated, or moistened and intermixed with the saliva, the fluid which flows from the salivary glands ; as also with the fluid which is poured out by the mucous glands of the mouth. While this process is going on the mouth is a closed cavity; formed in front by the lips, and behind by the soft palate, which drops down close to the tongue during masti- cation ; but as soon as the morsel is prepared for swallowing, it is gathered up by the tongue and muscles of the cheeks, and, being passed backwards, the soft palate rises to admit of its passage into the pharynx. The pharynx at the same time is extended and thrust forward to receive the morsel, and, having done so, its muscles instantly close upon it, and force it down the esophagus, by the muscular contractions of which it is forced onwards to the stomach. The entrance of the wind-pipe being in front of the pharynx, the food has to pass over it in its passage; and, as death might result if the food happened to pass down this breathing tube, a beautiful contrivance is provided to guard against such a calamity.

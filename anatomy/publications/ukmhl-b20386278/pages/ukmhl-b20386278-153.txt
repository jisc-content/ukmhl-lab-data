THE BRAIN AND NERVOUS SYSTEM. 109 Being of a soft nature it is secured in its positon by means of a tough membrane, called the dura mater; which also serves to prevent one portion of it from pressing upon another. A fold of this membrane firmly attached to the skull, from back to front, forms a partition dividing the brain into what are called the right and left hemispheres; a similar fold, extended across the back of the skull, also separates the upper from the lower part of the brain. The upper, and larger, portion of the brain is called the cerebrum; the upper surface of which is curiously disposed in winding tubular folds, called the convolutions of the brain, which, by their folds and spaces between, afford a greater amount of surface. The lower surface of it is divided into what are called the front, back, and middle lobes. The lower and back portion of the brain is called the cerebellum; it is about one-eighth the size of the upper por- tion. It is also divided into two hemispheres, and into several small lobes, but the folds on its surface are much smaller than those on the upper portion of the brain, and are arranged in semi-circular curves, or lamina. At the base of the brain, and connected with the two portions described, is a short and expanded portion of the spinal cord, called the medulla oblongata; different names being given to prominent portions of it. Within the brain are four cavities, having communication with each other, called the ventricles of the brain; they are lined with a serous membrane, which secretes a fluid for moistening their interior. On examining the internal structure of the brain it pre- sents the appearance of a soft, white, fibrous mass, united at the base, and disposed in numerous folds and convolutions connected together throughout the brain ; over the surface

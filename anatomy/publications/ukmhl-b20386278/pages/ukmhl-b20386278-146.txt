102 HUMAN ANATOMY AND PHYSIOLOGY. Holes; over the surface of which are spread out capillary vessels and nerves, which separate from the blood a mucous fluid, and pass it into the interior of the cells ; from whence it is poured out when required. A cluster, or aggregation, of single cells or follicles, (such as those which secrete the oily fluid for keeping the skin soft,) are called glands : those of the skin being of the simplest form. Over the surface of each of those minute follicles are spread out capillary vessels and nerves, by the agency of which the oily fluid is secreted from the blood, and being passed through the membraneous covering of the follicle is poured out on the surface of the skin as required. A more complicated kind of gland, such as the pa- rotid glands, the pancreas, and liver, is made up of myriads of such small secretory vessels; each having minute branches of arteries, veins, and nerves, spread out over its surface; the whole being connected together, and enclosed in a membrane, and provided with vessels for containing or conveying the secretion. The form of the secretory cells varies in different kinds of glands; in some they are elongated into bag-like bodies called follicles, and in others they are still more elongated, forming long tubular vesicles. The arrangement of those cells also varies in different glands, in some they are united so as to form a tree-like appearance, the cells arranged so as to pour their contents into branching tubes, and these again into a . common ex- cretory trunk; an arrangement which is seen in the salivary glands and the liver. In some glands the tubular-shaped vesicles are curiously convoluted, a beautiful arrangement of which is seen in the kidneys.

157 DISEASE. Pies, bringing from the heart a larger stream of pure arterial blood to stimulate and nourish the various tissues, and to keep up the animal heat of the body, impart energy and vigour to the whole system. The want of such exercise occasions a sluggish circula- tion, a low temperature of body, impurity of the blood, a constipated habit, varicose veins, swelled legs and feet, and frequently a scrofulous and gouty constitution. The muscular tissue being also weakened, for the want of exercise, leads to spinal and other deformities; the muscles loosing their power to sustain the weight imposed on them. Tn like manner as proper mental exercise gives the brain increased energy and power, so does mental inactivity pre- vent its full development, enfeeble its powers, and disorder its functions ; often producing melancholy, or hypochondrism, and mental imbecility. But, necessary and beneficial as exercise is to the system, mental and bodily over-exertion are to be guarded against as highly debilitating and injurious. When the muscles are over-exercised they become irri- tated and inflamed, and the nerves sympathizing with them produce a general lassitude of the whole body. And if this over-exertion is continuous from day to day, and the powers of the system are such as not to supply the waste occasioned, rheumatic pains will be soon felt, a feebleness of body generated, and premature old age be induced. Over mental exertion not only deprives the skin, stomach, and other organs of their necessary nervous stimulus, and thus weakens them; but, by keeping the blood-vessels of the head constantly over-distended, it produces nervous irrita- bility and mental derangement.

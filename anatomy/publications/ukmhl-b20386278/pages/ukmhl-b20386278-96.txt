5J HUMAN ANATOMY AND PHYSIOLOGY. 16 The knee-bone, or Patella. portion of the large intestines, the bladder, and parts of other organs. At the under and outer surface of the two side-bones are two large circular cavities, into which the rounded tops of the thigh-bones are inserted, thus forming " ball and socket joints." The extremities are the arms and hands; and the thighs, legs, and feet, distinguished as the upper and lower extre- mities. Each arm contains three cylindrical10 bones, the largest one in the upper part of the arm, called the upper arm, and the other two forming the lower, or fore-arm. The wrist, to which the fore-arm bones are attached, consists of eight" small bones, placed in double rows, and so joined to each other as to admit of a great variety of movements. The hand is formed of five12 bones, nearly parallel to each other, the one to which the thumb is joined being the shortest. The fingers,13 which are joined to the ends of the hand-bones, are each formed of three bones, excepting the thumb, which has only two; in all, fourteen finger-bones to each hand. Each thigh contains a single14 cylindrical bone, the largest and strongest in the whole frame. The legs have each two15 bones ; those joined to the lower portion of the thigh-bone, form the knee, to the front of which is attached a small bone16 for protecting the knee-joint. The upper arm, or Humerus, and the two fore-arm-bones, or the Radius and Ulna. 11 The eight wrist, or Carpal bones.

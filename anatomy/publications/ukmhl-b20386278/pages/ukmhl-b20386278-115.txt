71 THE INTERIOR OF THE BODY. which also lies upon it, like the envelope of the lungs ; it serves to keep it in its position, as well as to secrete a fluid into itself for keeping its parts pliable. The heart is situated behind the breast-bone, and between the two bags, or pleura, covering the two lungs; that space being called the mediastinum. It lies obliquely, with its base towards the spine and its point in front, a little towards the left side. It is kept in its position by means of the large vessels at its base, as well as by the bag which surrounds it, which is strongly attached to the diaphragm. The large branch of the arteries, proceeding from the heart, is called the aorta. It rises from the left ventricle of the heart, and forms an arch above it, from which arch it sends off branches to supply the head and upper part of the body; after which it turns down behind the heart, and penetrating through the diaphragm, proceeds downwards, sending off branches in its course. About opposite the last lumbar-bone it separates into two large branches, called the iliac arteries, which go to supply the lower extremities with blood. The thorax also contains the two large trunks of the veins, which are attached to the heart, called the upper and lower vena cava. Also a portion of the thoracic duct, or main trunk of the absorbents; likewise the esophagus, and parts of other vessels and organs passing up and down the body. The organs contained in the abdomen are the stomach, the small and large intestines, the liver, the pancreas, the spleen, the kidneys, the bladder, and parts of other vessels and organs. The stomach, or chief organ of digestion, is a muscular bag about a foot long, and from four to five inches diameter

THE BRAIN AND NERVOUS SYSTEM. 125 laws of our nature, and to cultivate our moral sentiments by acts tending to human elevation, our mental energies will gradually acquire strength, and our moral nature a supre- macy for good. As the organs of sense, and the nerves of sensation coil? nected with them, are the instruments for conveying informa- tion to the brain, so are the nerves of motion, proceeding from it, the instruments by which it carries its will into action; by which it stimulates the limbs to run its errand, the hands to execute its bidding, and the tongue to issue its commands. These two kinds of nerves, leading to and from the brain, form the six columns of nerves composing the spinal cord; the front and side columns being the nerves of motion, and the back columns those of sensation. The nerves branching out of the spinal cord have also the same two-fold functions, as they spring both from motor and sensitive trunks ; the filaments of the one generally distributed to the skin, and the filaments of the other to the muscles. But if by disease or accident a division is made in the spinal cord, the brain has no longer any control over the lower portion; sensation is at once cut off, the power of voluntary motion is destroyed, and the parts or limbs supplied by it are immediately paralyzed. Yet, so long as the nervous branches are attached to the spinal cord, there are various automic movements that may be induced; as for instance the limb can be made to move when the nerves on the surface are irritated. But of such movements the brain is unconscious, and over them it has no power; they being supposed to take place by the nerves irritated conveying the impression to the central matter of the spinal cord, and that, being of the nature of the grey

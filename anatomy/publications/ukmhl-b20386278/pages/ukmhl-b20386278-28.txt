4 HUMAN ANATOMY AND PHYSIOLOGY. Bones are composed for the most part of an animal sub- stance called gelatine,7 and of an earthly substance called phosphate8 of lime ; to the one belongs life and nourish- ment, and to the other hardness. The gelatine is the larger proportion in youth, and the lime in old age. Broken bones are reunited by the parts being placed opposite to each other and kept firmly in their place; the vessels secreting bony material to effect the junction. QUEST IONS.

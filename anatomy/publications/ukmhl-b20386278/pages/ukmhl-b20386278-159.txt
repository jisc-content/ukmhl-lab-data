THE ORGAN OF SENSE. 115 The ear is an organ of a very curious and complex structure; generally described as the external ear, the middle portion or drum, and the internal ear or labyrinth. What is called the external ear consists of a cartilagi- nous kind of funnel for collecting the sound, and a short tube leading inwards for conveying it to the middle portion of the ear; some animals having the power of moving their ears to enable them the better to catch the sound. The middle portion, called the tympanum, or drum of the ear, is a small cavity separated from the external ear by a thin membraneous partition extended across it like a drum head. Within this cavity are three1 small bones attached to the drum and to each other, by means of minute ligaments, and provided with four small muscles for moving them. There are three openings leading from it into the internal chambers of the ear, and one connected with the back of the mouth, for the admission of air, called the eustachian tube. The internal ear, or labyrinth, is a curiously constructed cavity, different parts of it being distinguished by different names; the central part called the vestibule, the back part the semi-circular canals, and the front part the cochlea ; so called from its winding form like the shell of a snail. The labyrinth is lined with a pulpy membrane, in which are spread out the filaments of the auditory nerve, and also by a serous membrane, which secretes a watery fluid filling the different cavities. All sounds are supposed to be conveyed to the brain in the following manner. 1 The bones of the ear called the Malleus, or hammer; the Incus, or anvil; and the Stapes or stirrup. I 2

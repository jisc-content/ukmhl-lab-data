6 Retrogade, the contrary, going back. THE. ORGANS OF CIRCULATION. S3 These large vessels in their course through the body send out branches in different directions, and these again send out smaller and smaller branches like a tree, until at last they terminate in little hair-sized vessels called capillaries. Most of the large branches of the arteries are protected from injury by being buried deep in the muscles ; but at places where there is but little muscle their pulsations5 may be felt, as at the wrist and temples. The coats of the arteries are stronger than those of the veins. The veins are larger and more numerous than the arteries, and are provided with valves in their interior to prevent the retrograde6 passage of the blood. The large vessel for conveying the impure blood to the lungs is called the pulmonary artery, and the vessels for bring- ing back the blood from the lungs the four pulmonary veins. QUESTIONS.

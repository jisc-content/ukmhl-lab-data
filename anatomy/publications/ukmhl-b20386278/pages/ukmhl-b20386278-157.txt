THE BRAIN AND NERVOUS SYSTEM. 113 supplying the lower extremities. The chief branch formed by this union is the great ischiatic nerve, the largest in the body; it separates about midway down the thigh into two branches, called the tibial and peroneal nerves. The sympathetic system may be considered as a sepa- rate set of nerves, belonging to what is called our organic life j yet having a communication with the other nerves of the body. It consists of a series of ganglia and branches, forming a kind of nervous chain, down each side of the spinal cord; and connected with a number of branches and ganglia supplying the various organs within the body. When the structure of the nervous system is micro- scopically examined, it is found that the grey or cineritious substance consists of myriads of minute cells and granules of different sizes, held together by a minute net-work of blood-vessels. That the white fibrous or medullary substance is made up of numerous bundles of exceedingly minute tubes, con- taining a colourless kind of fluid; each bundle enclosed in a thin membrane, and the whole held together by means of a delicate tissue. These tubes can be traced in the fibrous substance of the brain; some of them diverging from the upper portion of the spinal cord towards the convolutions, and some pro- ceeding from the surface of the brain, and converging to the substance of the spinal cord. The nervous tubes seem to pursue an uninterrupted course from their origin to their termination, which is generally in the form of minute loops. i

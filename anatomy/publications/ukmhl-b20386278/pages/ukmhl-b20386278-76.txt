38 HUMAN ANATOMY AND PHYSIOLOGY, LESSON XIV. EXCRETION. Excretion is the name given to that function by which all the rejected and noxious1 materials of the body are re- moved out of it; the chief excretions being those of the skin, the lungs, liver, kidneys, and intestines. The skin excretes or throws off a large proportion of the waste fluids of the body; in ordinary circumstances2 from a pound and a half to two pounds daily, but in circum- stances of great labour, in a heated atmosphere,3 as much as from two to four pounds in an hour. This perspiration is salt, acrid,4 and oily in its nature; and to ensure health, should be daily removed from the skin. The lungs, by the process of respiration, throw off, in the form of gas, the carbonaceous portion5 of the blood; as well as a large portion of its moisture in the form of vapour.6 It has been estimated that we send out from the lungs as much as from seven to fourteen ounces of solid charcoal, and from fifteen to twenty-four ounces of moisture, in every twenty-four hours. The liver secrets bile from the venous blood, a fluid, which, after answering the two-fold purpose of promoting T Noxious, prejudicial, injurious. 2 Circumstances, states, or conditions, around. 3 Atmosphere, the air surrounding. d Acrid, pungent and bitter. 5 Carbonaceous, containing carbon. 6 Vapour, an exhalation.

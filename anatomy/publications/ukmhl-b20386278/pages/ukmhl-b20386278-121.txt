77 THE ORGANS OF DIGESTION. The liver is a large gland, situated in the upper portion of the abdomen, its function being the secretion of the bile. This green bitter fluid is secreted by the liver from the venous blood, and is stored up in the gall bladder till wanted. All the veins of the digestive organs unite to form a large trunk called the vena porta, which again dividing spreads its branches throughout the liver in its passage back to the heart, secreting the bile in its progress. The pancreas, or sweet bread, is a gland, situated behind the stomach, by which is secreted a fluid, similar in appear- ance to the saliva of the mouth, called the pancreatic juice. This fluid slowly flowing into the duodenum in conjunction with the bile serves to separate the nutritious from the in- nutritious part of the food. The duodenum is the first twelve inches of the small intestines, joined to the pyloric end of the stomach. It is the cavity in which the food begins to be converted into chyle. Like the stomach it is provided with two muscular coatings, an external envelope, and a loose mucous mem- braneous lining, arranged in folds so as to greatly enlarge the surface as well as to cause the food to pass slowly along. The ducts of the liver and pancreas run into it by a com- mon opening. The small intestines, of which the duodenum is the upper portion, are those small membraneous tubes which are ar- ranged in folds, or convolutions, between the layers of the mesentery; a broad membrane which secures them to the back bone. In them the nutritious portion of the food is absorbed. The large intestines are joined to, or continued from the small ones in such a manner as to prevent any retrograde move- ment of their contents ; they are about twice the size of the

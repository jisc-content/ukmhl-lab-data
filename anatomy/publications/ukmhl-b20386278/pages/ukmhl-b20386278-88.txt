46 HUMAN ANATOMY AND PHYSIOLOGY. The tongue is the chief organ of taste, over the surface of which are spread out the papilla of the nerves. The substance tasted, being partially dissolved by the saliva, is pressed by the tongue against the roof of the mouth, so as to more fully impress the nerves with its peculiar taste. The /lands and fingers may be said to be the especial organs of touch; being more sensitive and descriminating than other parts of the body. We feel by means of the nerves of sensation; their extremities terminating in little nervous papilla6 all over the surface of the body. The papilla are larger on the tips of the fingers than on other parts of the body, and form the minute ridges we see on them. QUESTIONS. What i3 meant by the organs of sense ?

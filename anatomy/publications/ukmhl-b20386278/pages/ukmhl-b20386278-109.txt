THE SKINâ€”ITS FUNCTIONS. 65 same nature as the nails of the fingers and toes, which are hardened parts of the cuticle. The substance which forms this outer membraneis exuded in a fluid state from the true skin, and as it hardens assumes an organized form. When examined by the microscope it appears to be made up of minute scales united together by a delicate membrane, and is so constructed as to admit of substances passing out and in between the scales; the openings being connected with the excretory and absorbent vessels. The rete-mucosum, or middle layer of the skin, is a soft, mucous, or vicid fluid; its use being to protect the delicate vessels beneath, and to keep the nerves of touch, which pass through it, soft and pliable. It also constitutes the colouring matter of the skin, being dark in the Negro, yellowish in the Asiatic, reddish in the American Indian, and nearly colourless in Europeans. It is secreted by minute glands in the membrane beneath, and some of these contain the colouring matter spoken of; to the different combinations of which is attri- buted all the variety of colour in birds, beasts, and fishes. The cutis, or true skin, is the inner layer; it is a thick fib- rous membrane abounding in nerves, arteries, veins, glands, and other vessels. The upper surface of it is a complete net- work of vessels and nerves; the extremities of which, coursing through the mucous coating, terminate in the cuticle, by which covering their extreme sensitiveness is blunted. Those minute vessels and nerves are so numerously spread out over the surface that the point of the finest needle cannot be inserted without producing blood and causing pain, proving that some blood-vessel and nerve must be injured. The extremities of the nerves of the skin constitute the I

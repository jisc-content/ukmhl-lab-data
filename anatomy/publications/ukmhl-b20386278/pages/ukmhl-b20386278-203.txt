For by such pressure the free expansion of the lungs is prevented, the body distorted, the blood vitiated, consumption and other diseases generated, and the maladies occasioned by the practice are too often transmitted from one generation to another. In addition to the causes of disease enumerated might be included the want of cleanliness, together with many other bad habits and practices generated by ignorance, indo- lence, and vice. But, happily for us, all these diseases which afflict humanity, and which ignorance and credulity formerly ascribed to malignant powers and supernatural agency, have been mostly traced by enlightened and scientific men to their true source; to the neglect or infringement of some of the great physical and moral laws of the universe. These affording daily warnings, to men collectively and individually, that disease can only be avoided and health and happiness secured, by every man endeavouring to live in accordance with those eternal laws; and by his making every possible exertion to cause others to understand and obey them. And in concluding this lesson let it be engraven on our memories, that the exercise of our own moderate abilities to prevent disease, is far better than the exalted wisdom of others to cure it. But, with all our caution, should disease unhappily come upon us, let us avoid all kinds of tinkering nostrums; and remember that the most skilful physician will then be found our best, our safest, and cheapest guide.

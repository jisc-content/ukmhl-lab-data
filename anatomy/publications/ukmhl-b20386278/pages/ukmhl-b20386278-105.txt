THE MUSCLES. 6] two20 muscles placed on the fore part of the upper arm; and extended by means of two21 others on the back of it. There are also four22 muscles provided for enabling us to turn or twist the arm, so as to turn the palm of the hand up or down. The hand and fingers are bent chiefly by means of two28 muscles placed on the front of the fore-arm and hand, and extended by means of one24 muscle situated on the back of the arm and hand. These muscles are separated each into four divisions, and where they are attached to the fingers they curiously end in sheaths and tendons; the tendon for bending one joint run- ning through the sheath enclosing another joint. There are also several other small muscles belonging to the thumb and fingers to enable them to execute all their varied movements. The thigh, at the hip-joint, is bent upon the body chiefly by means of two25 powerful muscles on each side, attached to the pelvic and lumbar-bones ; and is extended by means of three26 large muscles situated behind. The thigh is also rotated and turned inwards and outwards by means of a number of other powerful muscles. 29 The Biceps flexor cubiti, The Brachialis interims. 21 The Triceps extensor cubiti, The Anconeus. 22 The Supinator longus, The Supinator brevis, The Pronator teres, The Pronator quadratus. 2S The Plexor digitorura sublimis vel peforatus, The Plexor digitorum profundus vel peforans. 21 The Extensor digitorum com- munis. 25 The Psoas magnus and parvus, The Iliacus internus. 26 The Gluteus maximus, The Gluteus medius, The Gluteus minimus.

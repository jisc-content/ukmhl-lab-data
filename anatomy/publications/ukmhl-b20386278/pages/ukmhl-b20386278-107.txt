THE MUSCLES. 6S leg, and a short37 muscle on the back of the foot, which likewise end in tendons running through each other. The muscles of the upper and lower extremities are enclosed in a strong tendinous sheath38 for affording them additional strength and protection. Tough ligaments are also bound round the wrists, palms of the hands, and insteps of the feet, for retaining the muscular tendons in their proper place. In contemplating the organization, arrangement and power of those innumerable living cords which unitedly compose the muscular structure, we must not fail to re- member that exercise is the most important law of their nature. By proper exercise the blood is impelled onwards in its course, nourishing, expanding, and strengthening each fibrous thread, and giving energy both to mind and body. Por the want of such exercise the muscles shrink, their power becomes weakened, and the whole mental and bodily system relaxed. 37 The Extensor brevis digitorum pedis. 33 The Fascia, or Aponeurosis.

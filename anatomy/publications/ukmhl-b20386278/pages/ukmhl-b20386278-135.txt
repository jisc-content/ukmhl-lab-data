91 THE BLOOD ITS CIRCULATION. superior and inferior vena cava, into the right auricle of the heart. This impure or dark venous blood stimulating the right auricle causes it to contract upon it, or to force it down through the tricuspid valve into the lower compartment, called the right ventricle; which also contracting, the valve at the same time preventing the blood from returning, forces it up through the pulmonary artery, by the two branches of which it is conveyed out into the lungs to be purified. The blood, having been thus conveyed to the lungs, is distributed into smaller and smaller branches of the arteries until at last it enters the extreme branches, called arterial capillaries; which are spread out over the air vesicles of the lungs so as to form a complete net work of vessels. The air having been conveyed into the lungs, by the minute branches of the wind-pipe, finally enters the interior of the air vesicles, and its oxygen penetrating through the delicate membrane of which they are composed comes in contact with the blood. The purification of the blood being effected by the oxygen of the air and the carbon contained in the blood having a mutual affinity for each other. The blood, being thus purified, is conveyed back again to the heart by another set of vessels, called the four pul- monary veins; the blood passing from the arterial into the venous capillaries, which are also spread out over the sur- face of the air vesicles, is by them conveyed into larger and larger branches until it is finally conveyed by the four veins into the left auricle of the heart. When it is conveyed into the left auricle, that compart- ment immediately contracts and forces it down through the mitral valve into the lower compartment, called the left ventricle; which also contracting, and the valve at the same

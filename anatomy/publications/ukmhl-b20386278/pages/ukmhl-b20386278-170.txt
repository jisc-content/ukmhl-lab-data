126 HUMAN ANATOMY AND PHYSIOLOGY. substance of the brain, conveys its motive influence to the muscles which move the limb; producing what are called reflex movements. But though the brain is thus essential for all poiver of thought and voluntary motion, and though animals rise in the scale of intelligence in proportion as their brains approxi- mate those of human beings, yet it does not appear to be essential to mere animal existence; as there are many animals without brains, and many have lived for some time when accident or injury has deprived them of it. The nerves of sensation and voluntary motion, or those belonging to our animal life, having been so far described, we have now to consider the functions of the sympathetic system, or those which belong to our organic life. The sympathetic, or organic nerves, supplying the dif- ferent organs within the body, their branches distributed over the blood-vessels, and their filaments supplying the minutest capillary, are the nerves which stimulate the func- tions of these organs. Without their influence nutrition, respiration, circulation, secretion, and other organic functions could not be regularly effected; and were the nerves and ganglia which supply them to be cut off their functions would be at once impeded. These important functions, on which animal life depends, are carried on, by the agency of the organic nerves, from birth till death, without tiring, without rest; without the brain being conscious of their varied operations, and without any other feeling than that of the pleasurable existence which we call health; unless, indeed, some disease or dis- arrangement takes place, when the attention of the brain is at once directed, by pain or otherwise, to the remedying of the evil.

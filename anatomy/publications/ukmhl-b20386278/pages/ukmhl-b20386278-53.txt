\9 THE FUNCTION OF DIGESTION. C 2 LESSON VII. THE FUNCTION OF DIGESTION. Digestion is the process by which food is converted into blood, or nutriment for our bodies. The first process the morsel of food undergoes is that of mastication, or the cutting, tearing, and grinding it with the teeth, while at the same time it is moistened with the saliva. Being thus masticated, and mixed with the saliva, it is gathered up by the tongue and cheeks and passed back- wards into the pharynx, the muscles of which force it down the esophagus into the stomach. As soon as the food has entered the stomach the blood vessels and nerves become excited, the gastric juice begins to flow, the vermicular1 motion to commence, and the food to pass slowly round and round the stomach until the whole is dissolved into a soft pulp-like state called chyme. As fast as every little portion of food is dissolved and carried towards the small end of the stomach, the pylorus? relaxing allows it to pass out into the duodenum. Into this last organ the bile3 and pancreatic4 juice flow, 1 Vermicular worm-like motion. 2 Pylorus, the small muscle round the orifice, sometimes called the gate- keeper. 3 Bile, a thick greenish fluid secreted by the liver. 4 Pancreatic juice, a fluid in appearance like saliva, secreted by the pancreas.

32 HUMAN ANATOMY AND PHYSIOLOGY. is sent out from the heart to fill the arterial capillaries which are spread out over the air vesicles of the lungs, and the air rushing down into the air vesicles, its oxygen passes through their thin membraneous coats, and coming in contact with the blood, changes it instantly from venous into arterial. At the moment of expiration the purified blood passes into the capillaries of the pulmonary4 veins, and is carried by the four venous trunks to the left side of the heart, while at the same time the carbonic acid gas escapes through the coats of the blood-vessels into the air vesicles, from which it is expelled by expiration. This expelled air, being of a poisonous quality, is unfit to be breathed over again. Thus the process of respiration shows us the necessity for a constant supply of fresh air to purify the blood, as well as the necessity for getting rid of the impure air, which can only be done by well ventilating5 our apartments. The liver is also an organ that assists in purifying the blood by another processâ€”that of secreting bile out of the venous blood. * Pulmonary, belonging to the lungs. 5 Ventilation, a free admission of air.

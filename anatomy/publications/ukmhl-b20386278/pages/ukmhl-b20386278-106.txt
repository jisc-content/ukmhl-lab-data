HUMAN ANATOMY AND PHYSIOLOGY. 62 The mass of muscle on the thigh-bone consists, for the most part, of the muscles for bending and extending the leg at the knee-joint. On the back of the thigh are three27 large muscles for bending the leg, and on the front of it are four28 large ones for extending it. There is also a thin, oblique29 muscle on each thigh for crossing the legs one over the other. The foot is bent by means of two30 muscles on the front of the leg, and extended by means of three31 others forming the calf, the lower ends of which unite to form the large tendon at the heel, called the tendon of Achittis. There are also two32 other muscles on the outer side of the leg, which enable us to turn our foot outwards; and a deep-seated33 one behind which aids in bending the foot and turning it inwards. The toes are bent by means of two34 long muscles placed beneath the calf, and a short one35 placed beneath the foot, the lower ends of which divide into tendons leading to the toes, in a similar manner to those of the fingers. The toes are extended by means of two36 muscles on the front of the 27 The Biceps femoris, The Semitendinosus, The Semimembranosus. 28 The Rectus femoris, The Crureus, The Yastus internus, The Yastus externus. 29 The Satorius.

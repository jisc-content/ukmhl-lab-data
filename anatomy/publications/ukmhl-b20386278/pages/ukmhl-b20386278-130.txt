As the aorta proceeds downwards through the thorax it sends off three4 branches from each side to supply the inter- nal muscles, and vessels and organs contained in it; and in like manner in its course through the abdomen it sends off nine5 branches to supply the various organs and parts belong- ing to this cavity. The division of the aorta, into the two6 large branches of the lower extremities, takes place opposite the fourth lumbar bone, from which divisions a number of smaller branches are sent off to supply the lower portion of the trunk. The large or main7 branches in their course through the thighs send off minor branches, and when they reach below the knees each of them separate into three8 branches, which go to supply the legs, feet,9 and toes, with blood. From these large divisions and branches of the arteries a The Subclavian and Axillary Arteries; these become the Brachial in the arms, the Radial and Ulnar in the fore arms, and the Palmar Arteries in the Hand. * The Coronary Arteries. 4 The Thoracic branches are the Bronchial, the Esophageal, and Intercostal arteries. 5 The Abdominal branches are the Phrenic, Cceliac, Superior Mesenteric, Spermatic, Inferior Mesenteric, Supra-Renal, Renal, Lumbar, and Sacral Media arteries. 8 The Iliac arteries, becoming ? The Femoral and Popliteal in the thighs, b The Front and Back Tibial, and Peroneal in the legs, and 9 The Plantar arteries in the feet,

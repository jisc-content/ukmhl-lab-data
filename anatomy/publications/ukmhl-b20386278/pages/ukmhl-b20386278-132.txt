HUMAN ANATOMY AND PHYSIOLOGY. den rush of blood to so delicate an organ. The vessels which bring back the venous blood from the brain are the two internal branches of the jugular veins. Arteries are composed of three coats, one over the other; the middle one of a fibrous nature giving great elas- ticity to the tube, and thus equalizing the flow of blood. The veins are also composed of three coats, but they are much thinner than those of the arteries. The supply of blood for their nourishment is derived from arteries in their vicinity, but is distributed throughout their coats by means of their own minute blood vessels, called the vasa vasorum. The blood in the veins having for the most part to flow upwards, there is provision in their interior to prevent the upward current from retrogressing. This consists in the internal membrane being arranged in semi-lunar folds, so as to form little valves at different distances throughout the veins; these valves allowing the blood to flow towards the heart but preventing its return,

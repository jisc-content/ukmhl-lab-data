This change, which seems to be of a chemical nature, is the complete separation of the nutritious from the in- nutritious portion of the food, the nutritious being a milky white rich fluid called chyle. The two substances being thus changed pass into the small intestines together, in the interior of which are the lacteals, vessels which gradually absorb5 the chyle in its on- ward course ; while the innutritious portion is gradually carried onwards to its receptacle the large intestines. The lacteals coursing their way through the coatings of the small intestines finally pass outwards, and, having ab- sorbed the chyle convey it onwards to the mesenteric glands. The chyle in passing through two sets of these glands is enriched and purified and becomes more and more of the nature of blood. Prom the mesenteric glands it is conveyed into the thoracic duct, by which it is carried upwards and emptied into the venous6 blood. s Absorb, to suck up. 6 Venousy a dark impure kind of blood.

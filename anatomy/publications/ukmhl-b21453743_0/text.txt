Extracts from the Reports of the Proceedings of General Courts and Committees of the Governors of the Hospital, respecting the Anatomical Museum and the Catalogues thereof. At a Sub-committee held on the 26th of May, 1828 :— " Mr. Abernethy and Mr. Stanley having made a tender of the Preparations and all the other property in the Museum, to the Hospital, by the following document— " We, the undersigned, engage to give up the Preparations, and all the other property in the Museum, to the President, Treasurer, and Almoners of St. Bartholomew's Hospital, for the time being, for the use of the Medical School; and we also pledge ourselves carefully to preserve the same, to keep the Pre- parations in a state of good preservation, to supply new ones for those that decay, in a manner adequate to the instruction of students in all the facts of Anatomy usually exhibited in this manner, and to put up specimens of every interesting occurrence relative to disease and accident which may be met with in the practice of the Hospital, so long as we continue to teach Anatomy and Phy- siology in the school of the Hospital. " We also engage not to make any separate collection, but to add all the Pre- parations and Drawings which we may procure, to those in the Museum, in order to make that collection as ample and useful as possible. "JOHN ABERNETHY. EDWARD STANLEY." "St. Bartholomew's Hospital,iv SAINT BARTHOLOMEW'S HOSPITAL. "We recommend that the care of the said Museum be confided hereafter to the appointed teacher or teachers of Anatomy, who, from time to time, shall communicate to the Medical Committee whatever alterations or additions may take place in the Collection; that it be considered as the duty of such teacher or teachers to keep the Preparations in a good state of preservation, to supply new ones for those that decay, and in a manner adequate to the instruction of students in all the facts of Anatomy; and also to add new specimens of any interesting circumstances relative to dis- eases or injuries which may occur in the practice of the Hospital. « That the teachers are also to be required not to make any separate collection, but to add all the Preparations and Drawings to the said Museum ; that the medical officers of the Hospital be requested carefully to inspect the Museum, and annually report their observations to the Medical Com- mittee, as well as to the House Committee previous to the Midsummer General Court. "THOMAS HELPS and THOMAS HODGKINSON, Almoners. " JONATHAN HARRISON, RICHARD STRONG WELLS, and JOHN ABERNETHY." Which recommendation was confirmed at the General Court of Governors, held July 23rd, 1828. At a General Court held on the 22nd of July, 1829, Mr Stanley, on behalf of John Abernethy, Esq. and him- self attended and presented to this Court a Catalogue of the Preparations, &c. contained in the Museum of this Hospital, when it was resolved, « That five Hundred copies of the Catalogue be printed, under the direction of Mr. Stanley."EXTRACTS, &c. At a General Court held on the 27th of July, 1831, Mr. Stanley attended and presented to this Court a printed Catalogue of the Preparations, &c. contained in the Museum of this Hospital, which was referred to the House Committee. At a House Committee held on the 8th of July, 1845, In the Report of the Medical Officers respecting the Ana- tomical Museum :— " The Medical Officers desire to draw the attention of the Committee to the present state of the Catalogues of the Anatomical Museum," . . " And beg to submit to the Committee the propriety of causing a new Cata- logue to be printed, in which the descriptions of all the specimens added to the Museum, since the printing of the Catalogue in 1831, should be included, and such alterations as are necessary in that Catalogue, should be made." Whereupon it was resolved:— " That a new Catalogue of the Museum he printed, agree- ably to the suggestion of the Medical Officers, under the direction of the Treasurer and Almoners." Which Resolution was confirmed at the next following General Court of Governors. At a Committee of the Treasurer and Almoners held on the 17th of September, 1846, " Mr. Paget presented a copy of the new Catalogue of the Museum, printed under their direction: whereupon it was re- solved that the Catalogue be forthwith published."PREFACE TO THE CATALOGUE OF 1831. In the following description, the Natural and Morbid Pre- parations are arranged in the order of their situation in the Museum; an arrangement originally adopted by Mr. Aber- nethy, in conformity with the plan of his Anatomical and Physiological Lectures. The description of each specimen of Morbid Structure will be found to exhibit only the circumstances which are actually visible in it, except in the instances where the description refers to the recent state of the specimen, when its characters of colour and texture were different from those it may now possess. Whenever it could be safely inferred, from the appearances of the diseased parts, that certain processes were taking place in them at the time of death, these processes are stated. With the description of the specimens of injured and diseased bone, for example, there is an explanation of the processes by which dead bone is exfoliated, and new bone formed in its place.viii PREFACE TO THE CATALOGUE OF 1881. In the formation of the Museum, only those Morbid speci- mens have been preserved which might be expected to retain their original characters in a sufficient degree to render them useful as objects of future reference. Without this explana- tion, the experienced pathologist would expect to find in the Collection more numerous specimens of some organs in the human body which are subject to frequent alterations in their structure. It is due to the liberality of Dr. Conquest here to record the gift of his private Collection of Preparations, which have so greatly enriched those departments of the Museum to which they belong. EDWARD STANLEY.PREFACE TO THE PRESENT CATALOGUE. Since the former Catalogue was printed, in 1831, 1035 Preparations have been added to the Pathological division of the Museum. In the formation of the present Catalogue, all the descrip- tions, whether printed in the former one, or added to it from year, to year in manuscript, have been revised and recon- sidered ; many of them have been extended ; some have been corrected. In all the instances in which it was possible, brief histories of the cases have been added to the descriptions of the specimens, together with references to more detailed accounts of them recorded in the Case-books belonging to the Museum. The general rules of description, and the arrangement of the specimens, adopted by Mr. Abernethy and Mr. Stanley, have been but little deviated from. The arrangement appears to be the most convenient for a Museum to which every yea rx PREFACE TO THE PRESENT CATALOGUE, brings numerous additions, such as it would be difficult to insert in appropriate places, in a more minute classification. But tlie advantages of an arrangement founded on Principles of Pathology are sought to be attained by adding tables of reference to the descriptions of each series. By the help of these tables, it will be easy both to find any specimen in the Museum, and to study the Preparations in each series in the order in which they may best serve for illustrations of the diseases of the part to which that series is devoted. The following general Table of References is inserted, in order that certain specimens, dispersed among the numerous divisions of the Museum, may be examined in the same order as if they had been arranged in a separate series, as illustrations of General Pathology—an arrangement which could not have been adopted, without detracting from the interest which those specimens contribute to the several series of illustrations of Special Pathology, in which they are now placed.

The situation of the abscess is pointed out by the deficiency of medulla. The periosteum is not so strongly united to the bone as in the natural state ; it has been partially reflected, to show its vascularity and softened texture opposite to, and for some way above and below, the situation of the abscess. There is a narrow ulcerated aperture in the integuments over the tibia leading to slight superficial ulceration of its outer wall. 2. Section of a Tibia, exhibiting a part of the process of Exfoliation after superficial Necrosis. The dead and exfoliating piece of bone is separated from the living bone in the upper half of its extent, and the space which has been here formed by the ab- sorption of the surface of the living bone is occupied by soft vascular matter, like granulations. Beneath the lower part of the dead piece of bone there is an ulcerated groove, but no granulation. The granulations arising from the parts around the dead bone are large and spongy; and they overlap the mar- gins of the dead bone. b 2FIRST SERIES. Part of a Tibia affected by Necrosis. A large portion of the middle of the shaft of the tibia, including parts of its outer surface, and a much greater extent of its inner layers and cancellous tissue, has perished. A nearly complete wall of new bone, from half an inch to an inch thick, has been formed around the sequestrum, and has soft vascular matter lining its inner surface; its external surface is irregular, and it is of very dense spongy texture. The new wall is incomplete only at those situations which are opposite to the parts at which the outer layers of the walls of the tibia have perished. Sections of a Tibia, in which a portion of the cancellous tissue of the head died and was separated: it lay loose within a large cavity in the head of the bone, which is lined by soft vascular tissue, and the opposite walls of which are shown in the two sections. The periosteum, thickened and vascular, has been partially reflected, to show the rough external surface formed by the accumulation of new bone on the outer surface of the head of the tibia. Parts of a Femur. A portion of the whole thickness of the shaft of the femur, five inches long, died and was separated. The dead bone is contained in a cavity, which is formed in part by new bone, and in part by the surrounding soft tissues. The forma- tion of new bone has taken place chiefly at the remaining upper portion of the shaft, but has not extended the whole length of the femur; a considerable space remains at the lower part of the thigh, where this new bone is connected with the con- dyles only by soft matter. The internal surface of the new bone exhibited great vascularity ; the external surface is rough and irregular, and covered, not by well-formed periosteum, but by tough condensed cellular tissue, a portion of which has been turned back at the upper part. The surface of the lower end of the femur, from which the dead bone separated, is covered with granulations. The cartilage has been almost completely removed from the lower end of the femur, but the bone thus exposed is not ulcerated. The patient was a lad 16 years old, in whom the disease had existed a year and . half when the thiph was amputated through the trochanter major. A few days5 DISEASES OF BONE. before the operation, the limb, by the complete separation of the sequestrum and the succeeding approximation of the ends of the femur, became one-third shorter than it had been. The rest of the patient's history is in the case of James Macdonnel, in a paper by Mr. Lawrence, in the Medico-Chirurgical Transactions^ vol. vi. p. 174. London, 1815. The patient lived thirty years after the operation \ his pelvis is preserved in Sub-series D, and his humerus in Sub-series A, No. 155. Case Book, p. 70, No. 111. 6. Section of a Tibia. A portion of its anterior wall has perished, and is surrounded by new bone, from which it may be distin- guished by its smoothness and peculiar whiteness. Between the new bone and the deeper portions of the dead bone there is a large quantity of soft vascular matter. 7. Tibia of a Dog, exhibiting a portion of its wall dead and in the process of exfoliation. The dead bone is distinguishable from the living by its whiter colour; its separation is almost complete. Between the dead and the living bone a space intervenes, which is filled by soft and vascular substance. New bony matter is heaped upon the living bone around the dead bone, as well as in a thick layer on that side of the shaft which is opposite the seat of the necrosis. The periosteum has been in part detached from the tibia, to show that the new bone is entirely beneath this membrane, having been formed between it and the surface of the original wall of the bone, with which, however, it has completely coalesced. The changes just described succeeded to the cauterization of the external surface of the bone. 8. Tibia of a Dog, from which a portion of the wall, nearly similar to that which is shown in process of separation in the preceding specimen, has entirely exfoliated. The surface from which the dead bone has been separated is very vascular; and new bone is deposited in considerable quantity on the surface of the shaft around and opposite to it. This preparation was made in the same manner as No. 7. 9. Section of the Tibia of a Dog, in which a large portion of the cancellous tissue and of the wall of the shaft perished. The dead bone lay in a cavity with very vascular walls, and new bone was in process of formation around it. The periosteumFIRST SERIES. G which belonged to the old bone covers this new bone; but many fistulous holes extend through it into the cavity which contained the old bone. The walls of the bone were perforated, and the medulla destroyed. The bone was laid bare for that purpose at the part where now the largest aperture into the cavity exists. 10. Section of the Tibia of a Dog, in which the shaft of the bone, in its whole length and in nearly its whole thickness, died. The periosteum separated from it, and is thickened. Upon the internal surface of the separated periosteum, the formation of new bone has taken place in small irregular deposits; and it will be observed that these are all opposite to those parts on which the surface of the dead shaft is rough, making it probable that the new bone is formed on portions of the surface of the old shaft, which separated with the periosteum and served as a kind of nuclei for the growth of new bone. The old bone, at its extremities, still retains connexion with the periosteum; hence it has received some of the fluid injected into the blood vessels* The death of the bone was produced by the destruction of the medulla, as in No 9. 11. Sections of the Tibia of a Dog, in which, as in the preceding, nearly the whole shaft of the bone has died. The dead bone is in process of separation, and new bone is formed around it in much larger quantity than in the preceding specimen. The periosteum which belonged to the old bone covers the new bone. The death of the bone was produced by the destruction of the medulla, as in No. 9. 12 Section of the Tibia of a Dog, exhibiting the process of repa- ration after a small portion of its anterior wall had been re- moved. The space left by the lost bone is partially filled by new matter, like granulations growing from the medulla, and bone is formed on the surface of the shaft around it. new 13 Section of the Tibia of a Dog, in which necrosis has been produced in the outer layers of a small portion of its wall. The dead bone is distinguishable by its yellow colour. The living bone around it is increased in vascularity, and m one7 DISEASES OF BONE. situation the separation of the dead bone has been commenced by the formation of a groove between it and the living bone. The death of the bone was produced by the perforation of its walls. 14. Section of the Tibia of a Dog, in which Necrosis was pro- duced in a portion of the middle of its shaft. The dead bone, not yet separated from the living, is in part enclosed by new bone which has been formed around it. The necrosis was produced by the destruction of the medulla. 15. Section of the Radius and Ulna of a Dog exhibiting Necrosis of a portion of the shaft of the former. The dead bone is com- pletely separated, and new bone is abundantly formed around it. The cavity in which the dead bone is contained, is lined by a very thick and vascular membrane. The necrosis was produced by the destruction of the medulla. 16. Sections of the Tibia of a Dog, exhibiting Necrosis of a small portion of the posterior wall, and deposit of new bone around the exfoliating portion. 17. Fore Leg of a Dog, in which Necrosis of nearly the whole shaft of the Radius has been produced by destruction of the medulla. The dead shaft has been separated from the articular ends, and new bone is in progress of formation around its extremities. The eleven preceding preparations were obtained by a series of experiments performed by Mr. Stanley. 18. Portion of the Lower Jaw of a Child, which separated by ex- foliation. It contains two molar teeth of the temporary set, and the rudiments of three of the permanent set. 19. Sections of a Tibia, of which nearly the whole length and thick- ness of the walls of the shaft perished, and were in pro- cess of separation from the cancellous and medullary texture, which has preserved its vitality and a nearly healthy condition. The groove formed between the dead and the living bone is filled with soft and very vascular granulations. On the internal surface of the periosteum, spongy and vascular new hone is formed in a nearly uniform layer, to supply the place of that8 FIRST SERIES. which has perished. The inner surface of this new bone is covered by vascular granulations. The walls of the bone perished after inflammation of the periosteum produced by the application of nitric acid to a sloughing ulcer in the front of the leg. 20. Portion of a Tibia from a compound fracture, exhibiting the changes in the periosteum and bone preparatory to the exfolia- tion of the fractured extremity. The periosteum is thickened and appeared very vascular, and granulations have grown from its torn margin ; a portion of it is detached and turned back, to show parts of the subjacent bone in a higher state of vascularity than is natural. Part of the extremity of the bone has acquired the peculiar white colour of dead bone. 21. Portion of a Tibia from a compound fracture, exhibiting a somewhat later stage in the process of exfoliation of the broken extremity of the bone. The dead bone is distinguishable from the living by its peculiar whiteness; and its separation has been begun by the formation of a superficial groove in the ad- jacent margins of the living bone. Granulations have arisen from the exposed medulla. 22. Section of a Femur, and of part of a large Fibrous Tumour which closely surrounds it. The tumour exhibits various textures. The great part of it consists of a pale, whitish, firm substance, traversed by fibres and mixed with spicula of bone; but in some parts its texture is much softer, and it has numerous small thin walled cells or cysts imbedded in it. The texture of the bone itself is natural, except that its external surface is rough and deprived of periosteum, as if that membrane were involved in the tumour. Cast of the Limb from which this tumour was taken,—No. 1. The tumour had grown rapidly but without much pain : and the patient recovered after the amputation of the limb. 23. The front of the Lower Jaw of a Child, which was removed by operation, on account of a tumour arising in the cancellous texture of the bone, and thence protruding into the mouth. In the progress of the operation, the front of the jaw separated into an upper and a lower portion. With the upper portion9 DISEASES OF BONE. there is a part of the tumour, which was lodged in a cavity of the bone formed by the absorption of its cancellous texture and by the separation of its anterior and posterior walls. The tumour consisted throughout of a red and fleshy mass, resem- bling a piece of lacerated spleen. 24. Sections of a Tibia, exhibiting a deposit of dense and very hard osseous substance, both upon the outer surface and within the medullary tissue of the upper two thirds of its shaft. The ori- ginal walls may be recognized on the surface of each section, but they have coalesced with the new bone. A circumscribed space upon the upper part of the shaft is covered by irregular plates of bone set vertically upon it. It is probable that on this space there was a softer portion of an Osteoid Tumour, which has been removed by maceration. See Nos. 60 and 108. 25. Section of a large Tumour growing from the lower part of the Femur, and composed of nodules of cartilage intermixed with osseous matter. Part of the morbid structure extends through the wall of the femur with which it is connected, and through the interior almost to the opposite side. 26. A Femur of which the shaft has been in great part destroyed by ulceration, or by the pressure of a tumour. Around the ulcerated part, the bone is rough and porous. Masses of bone, composed of fine osseous fibres, originally connected with the femur, have separated in maceration. Soft matter was mixed with these, and formed a large tumour around the femur, the remaining part of which is preserved in the next preparation. 27. Section, including the outer surface, of the Tumour last referred to. It consists for the most part of dense fibrous tissue, in which are mingled some fine bony fibres. At its centre its substance was broken up and formed a large irregular cavity. The Cast of the limb from which the two preceding specimens were taken,— No. 2. 28. A Sacrum, in the interior of which is a large cavity, which con- tained pus. The walls of the bone have been expanded around10 FIRST SERIES. the pus, and large portions of them have been removed by ulceration. The cavity of the abscess opened widely into the spinal canal. The patient was between fifty and sixty years old, and died of organic disease in the stomach. There was no symptom which led to a suspicion of disease of the sacrum. 29. Section of a Tibia, with the soft parts covering it, exhibiting the effects of Malignant Ulceration. The section was made longi- tudinally through the middle of the tibia; the other half of the tibia and the fibula are in the next preparation. By viewing the two preparations together, it will be seen that the ulcerative process has extended completely through the body of the tibia, in a great part of its length, and has reached the fibula, as is evinced by the peculiar excavated appearance of its surface. No attempt has been made to restore the lost bone; there is merely a slight deposit of bony matter upon the surface of the fibula, opposite to that which is in progress of ulceration. The interosseous ligament is in part converted into bone. The inte- guments around the hollow which has been left by the ulcera- tion are much changed in structure ; they are swollen, and the margins of the hollow are formed by very vascular, coarse, and hard, warty granulations. 30. Macerated portions of the Tibia and Fibula, referred to in the preceding description. They were taken from a man fifty-three years old.

These changes were probably consequent on abscess within the bone. The walls of the shaft are thickened and spongy, and the remaining cancellous tassue is consolidated, so that their respective textures can hardly be distinguished.DISEASES OF BONE. I I 32. A large Cyst connected with the upper part of the Tibia. The disease seems to have commenced in the head of the tibia. The greater part of the wall of the bone is absorbed, so that the parietes of the cyst are formed above by the cartilage which covered the head of the bone, and in nearly all other directions by condensed fibro-cellular tissue, or the distended periosteum. A large portion of the cyst has been removed, to give a clear view of its interior, which is uneven, in parts fasciculated and coarsely retiform, in other parts shreddy. It probably contained blood and had its origin (like the similar specimen, No. 220) in a medullary tumour growing within the head of the bone. 33. Portion of Integuments removed from a diseased bone, exhibit- ing a peculiar change of structure in the skin, with thickening and consolidation of the subjacent parts. 34. A Section (cut with a knife) of the Femur of a Ricketty Child, curved in consequence of the want of its natural hardness. The shaft, instead of the natural division into solid walls and medullary cavity, consists throughout of cartilaginous and gela- tinous substances intermixed and disposed in cells. It is observable, that a greater quantity of the cartilaginous substance exists in the middle of the shaft and towards the interior curve than at any other part. The articular ends of the bone are in a natural state. 35. Sections of the Femur and Tibia of a Ricketty Child. The bones, which had become curved through a want of their natural hardness, have recovered their osseous texture and their inflexi- bility, but the curvature remains. In the femur, the walls of the bone in the middle and along the interior curve of the shaft have acquired a greater thickness than elsewhere. The tibia is solid in the situation of the chief curvature; and in the same situation it is flattened from side to side. The two preceding specimens arc described by Mr. Stanley, in the Medioo- Chirwrgkal Transactions, vol. vii. p. 404, London, 1016. 36. Fragments of the upper part of a Skull increased to from half an12 FIRST SERIES. inch to three quarters of an inch in thickness, and consisting throughout of a very finely spongy or porous substance, which is dry, hard, and heavy, but friable and crumbling under the fingers, like hardened mortar. Into this substance both all the diploe and the tables of the skull are changed: in the inner table scarcely any trace, in the outer no trace, of compact sub- stance remains. The grooves and apertures for blood-vessels in the inner table are very strongly marked. These changes are such as are sometimes found in connexion with rickets or with mollities ossium. Among the casts, No. 108 represents a whole skull thus changed. 37. Sections of the lower end of the Tibia and Fibula of a Child. The walls of the bones are thin and soft, and the cells of the ossified portion of its epiphysis are filled by tuberculous matter. 38. Sections of the articular ends of the Femur and Tibia of a young subject, exhibiting the same changes as No. 37. In these, the cells of the cancellous tissue of the adjacent parts of the shafts are also filled by tuberculous matter. 39. Section of the Head, Neck, and upper part of the Shaft of the Femur of a young subject. The cells are filled through- out by tuberculous matter. The articular cartilage in this, as in the preceding similar specimens, is sound. 40. The Bones of two Wrists, together with the lower ends of the Radii and Ulnae and the Metacarpal Bones, exhibiting the effects of Scrofulous Ulceration. On the left side the carpal bones are nearly destroyed, and there are large deep cavities, bounded by soft, greasy, crumbling bone, in the adjacent parts of the bones of the fore-arm and metacarpus : on the right side the ulceration is extensive, but superficial. 41 Section of a Tibia, and of a large Tumour which has formed around its upper third. One half of the tumour, the vessels of which have freely received the injection, is of a soft, fleshy, vascular texture. The other half, into which the injection has not so freely penetrated, consists of a mixture of cartilaginous13 DISEASES OF BONK. and osseous matter, the cartilage being arranged in nodules, and exactly resembling that of the foetal skeleton. The mor- bid growth is very closely connected with the periosteum in the whole circumference of the tibia, and at the upper part the osseous portion of the tumour is consolidated with the bone. The internal part of the tibia is sound. Presented by William Brewer, Esq. 42. Section of a Leg, exhibiting a growth of soft, vascular, warty fungus from its front part. The base of the growth is con- solidated with the periosteum, which, for some distance above and below, has become soft and spongy and has its connexion with the bone loosened. The bone itself is healthy, except that there has been an irregular ulceration of its external surface. 42a. Portions of the Tibia and Fibula, from the Leg last described, more plainly showing the ulceration of their anterior surfaces. From a woman thirty-five years old. She received a blow on the shin when ten years old, which was followed by abscess and discharge of small pieces of bone. The parts healed and remained well for many years ; but again abscess formed, and again healed ; and after this had been several times repeated, the growth here shown sprouted out, and the patient's health failing, the limb was removed. Case Book, vol. i. p. 1. No. 1. 43. Bones of a Knee-Joint, exhibiting a peculiar alteration of tex- ture. The diseased bone is not softened; it has a yellow colour, apparently from a peculiar firm deposit in its cancellous tissue. In some situations ulceration has taken place on the exterior of the diseased bone. The epiphyses are separated from the shafts. The articular cartilage is in some parts absorbed. 44. The other portion of the Femur last described. 45. An Os Innominatum, exhibiting a peculiar alteration of structure. The natural texture of the bone is converted throughout into a peculiar substance, which in the interior has a granulated, and on the exterior a fibrous, appearance, like the close-set short bristles of a tooth-brush. In the upper part of the specimen, the periosteum is separated, to display the peculiar fibrous substance which is between it and the surface of the ilium. From an aged person, whose liver contained many medullary tumours. Case Book, Vol. I., p. 124, No. 147.M FIRST SERIES. ■IG. A Section of the lower part of a Femur, and of a Brain-like Medullary Tumour, which has grown within the condyles and has extended them in a large thin-walled osseous and fibrous cyst. The tumour projects chiefly backwards and laterally ; a part of it is covered by the articular cartilage of the femur, which is extended over it, and in the middle, between the con- dyles, is perforated by the morbid growth penetrating into the knee-joint in front of the crucial ligaments. 47. Sections of the Head, Neck, and Shaft of a Femur, exhibiting suppuration in the cancellous texture. The substance of the bone has undergone no further alteration than the secretion of pus into it, and an increase of its vascularity. 48. A Tibia, the external surface of which is mottled by irregular effusions of blood into its substance, like spots and blotches of Purpura. The three preceding specimens were taken from the same individual. Ihe thigh was amputated, and the suppuration in the medullary texture of the upper part of the femur was consequent on the operation. 49 Sections of the upper half of a Humerus, and of a Medullary Tumour which occupies the place of the shaft of the bone. In one of the sections, a small portion of the diseased structure, distinct from the general mass, has protruded through the walls of the bone. In the other section, the morbid structure is covered by the articular cartilage which belonged to the head of the bone. , . . f The tumour in this instance had a constant and regular pulsation, the cause of Job was not discerned in the examination of the limb. The case is related by Mr. Stanley, in the Medico-Cldrurgical Transactions, Vol. xxvn.., p. au*. London, 1845. 50 A Section of a Tibia, exhibiting deposits of Lymph in the me- ' dullary tissue. Upon the external surface of the bone, m some situations, there is ulceration ; in others, there are irregular de- posits of osseous matter; and some small portions of its walls have suffered necrosis. 51 A Section of a Tibia, in which several irregular thin pieces of the outer wall, and two small portions of the cancellous tissue of the upper part of the shaft, have perished. The surface of the15 DISEASES OK BONE. wall around the dead portions of bone is extensively ulcerated, and around this ulcerated part new bone has been abundantly formed. In the medullary tissue lymph has been formed, and in one situation it is nearly consolidated by bone. 52. Section of a Femur from the same limb as the preceding speci- men. The medullary tissue is similarly diseased. An irregular deposit of new bone has taken place upon its external surface. In some situations this deposit appeared to be connected only with the periosteum, and could be separated with it from the bone; in others, it appeared to arise from the bone itself. From a boy fourteen years old, who without any evident cause was attacked with severe pain in the leg and thigh; the whole limb became cedematous, ex- tensive suppuration ensued, and he died hectic. Case Book, vol. i. p. 2, No. 5. 53. Section of a Tibia, exhibiting great increase of thickness in its walls, with narrowing of the medullary tube, and consolida- tion of the medullary texture by thickening of the cancelli.

A Portion of the Skull-Cap of a Chili which is very much thickened, and so soft in its texture as to be easily divisible by a knife. It has throughout an appearance of great vascularity ; and the soft parts covering it had the aspect of a naevus. This state existed from the birth of the child, and extended over the left side of the head and face and the left arm and shoulder. Presented by William Kingdon, Esq. Case Book, vol. i. p. 15, No. 34. 55. A Section of four Dorsal and Lumbar Vertebras, the bodies of which have been deeply hollowed out by absorption conse- quent on the pressure of an aneurism of the aorta. The surface of bone formed part of the aneurismal sac, and layers of fibrine still adhere to it. It will be observed, that the fibro-cartilaees and contiguous edges of the bones are entire. 56. Sections of the Bones of an Elbow-Joint. Their articular ends are enlarged and ulcerated. The enlargement of the bones, which is greatest on the ulna, does not depend upon an additionlt> FIRST SERIKS. of new matter to their exterior, but upon a separation of the layers of their walls. Their whole texture is very light and brittle. From a boy ten years old, in whom the disease had existed three years. He recovered after amputation of the limb. Case Book, vol. i. p. 3, No. 7. 57. A Tibia, of which a part of the shaft has suffered Necrosis. New bone has been abundantly formed on all the rest of the shaft; but, especially in the proximity of the sequestrum, it has a peculiar dry, grey, light, and brittle texture. 58. A Child's Tibia, in which several pieces of the shaft have perished. Some of them are exposed, some surrounded by new bone. There are many round apertures in the new bone, lead- ing to the cavity in which the dead bone is contained. 59. A Tibia, in which there is a circumscribed oval ulcer which has destroyed the anterior half of its walls, laying open the me- dullary cavity. There is scarcely any appearance of reparation ; the edges of the ulcer are sharp and uneven, and the adjacent bone is light, but not otherwise unhealthy. 60. A Section of the upper end of a Fibula, and of a Tumour which is connected with it. The tumour consists of a mixture of bone and a softer fibrous-looking substance, and it appears to have arisen from the periosteum. 61. Sections of a Fibula, upon the external surface of which are several Osteoid Tumours—masses of compact white osseous substance, the outer surfaces of which have a fasciculated and finely fibrous aspect, like the surface of pumice-stone. Around these, the walls of the bone are in parts superficially ulcerated, and in parts thinly covered by new bone. The medullary cavity is partially obliterated by a similar substance. 62 Sections of the Bones of a Face, exhibiting an Osseous Growth ' filling up the maxillary sinuses. By the sections through the sinuses a small cavity appears remaining in each, and indicates, as the disease of the adjacent bones also does, that their oblitera- tion is the consequence, not of the growth of tumours into them,17 DISEASES OP BONE. but of the thickening of their walls. The new bone by which they are increased in thickness is hard, nearly solid, and heavy ; it is almost all formed on their inner surfaces ; only a few small similar growths are elevated on their outer surfaces, and project on the face and into one of the orbits. The septum nasi and spongy bones are similarly thickened, enlarged, and very dense in their texture. 63. A Sternum, in which there is Necrosis of the central part and whole thickness of the bone. The surfaces of the dead bone are ulcerated : those of the surrounding part of the sternum are covered by new bone. 64. A Tibia, exhibiting Necrosis of a portion of its anterior wall. The dead bone, distinguishable by its black colour, was in pro- cess of separation from the living bone, a deep groove being formed between them. Its surface was in part removed by ulceration previous to its death. The walls of the bone, around the exfoliating portion, are thickened and of a porous texture. 65. A Tibia from a young subject, in which there has been Necrosis of nearly the whole Shaft. There are several distinct forma- tions of new bone around the sequestrum, and these are placed opposite to those parts on which its surface is rough in conse- quence of the removal of its outer layers. The lower articular surface is destroyed by ulceration. Presented by A. Sicard, Esq. 66. Bones of Fingers which separated by exfoliation. 67. Portions of a Tibia which separated by exfoliation. 68. Portion of a Tibia which separated by exfoliation. 69. A Tibia, of which a large portion of the shaft suffered Necrosis and is nearly separated. There is abundant formation of new bone around the old and dead bone. 70. A section of the lower end of the Femur of a Child, in which there is a circumscribed abscess, the result, perhaps, of tuber- c18 FIRST SERIES. culous disease. It is situated in the cancellous texlure, imme- diately above the epiphysis, through which also a channel appears to have led from it into the joint. The internal surface of the cavity is very smooth, and lined throughout by a mem- brane, a part of which is still seen. 71. Sections of an Occipital Bone, to the lower part of which an Osseous Tumour, nearly an inch in diameter, is attached by a narrow base. The outer part of this tumour is smooth and very dense : within, it is in part cancellous and in part nearly as dense as ivory; its textures have coalesced with those of the outer table and diploe of the skull. 72. A portion of the Lower Jaw of a Child, containing two Teeth, which separated by exfoliation. 73. Portion of a Radius, in which Necrosis, following a peculiar change of structure, has taken place in a piece of its lower end and articular surface. A groove between the dead and the living part of the bone indicates that a separation of the former wis taking place. There is abundant deposit of new bone on the sound bone immediately around the diseased part. 74 Sections of a Tibia and Fibula. Both bones are greatly thick- ened in every part of their walls. The interosseous ligament is ossified. A portion of the tibia near its lower end has been destroyed by malignant ulceration which has penetrated through almost the entire thickness of the shaft. The ulcer- ated surface of the bone is covered by a thick and tough mem- brane. The cancellous tissue immediately above the ulcerated part is consolidated by osseous deposit. 75 Section of a Tibia. The walls are generally thickened, and the cancellous tissue is consolidated by osseous deposit, except in one part near the upper end of the bone. The periosteum is every where altered in its texture, but especially so at the lower part of the bone, where a thick fleshy growth has taken place from it. . The disease had existed twenty-five years, having commenced m a severe lace-DISEASES OF BONE. ration of the integuments, which never perfectly healed. Case Book, vol. i. p. 154, No. 180. 76. Section of the lower part of a Tibia ; the other half of that in No. 75. It exhibits more plainly the fleshy growth from the periosteum, which is seen to retain its close connexion with the bone. 77. Portions of a Sternum and Ribs. There is a large cavity in the sternum filled by tuberculous matter. This cavity was closed in both behind and in front by a membrane, apparently the thickened periosteum, a part of which is now reflected. 78. Portion of a Tibia, exhibiting a peculiar change of structure which extends entirely through the bone. Both its walls and its internal parts are converted into a soft and crumbling sub- stance of a yellowish white colour, as if by the deposit of some morbid material, like tubercle, in softened bone. The morbid alteration does not extend quite to the articular end of the bone. The integuments, in the extent to which they correspond with the diseased bone, are thickened, indurated, and ulcerated. There is a fracture in the upper part of the diseased bone; but how this was produced is uncertain. 79. A large portion of a Skull which exfoliated after trephining. 80. Portion of a Tibia after a compound fracture, illustrating the process of exfoliation. The fractured end of the bone has perished. A deep and irregular groove has been formed round the limits of the dead bone, and a considerable deposit of osseous substance has taken place upon the contiguous living bone. 81. A similar specimen. 82. Sections of the lower part of a Tibia, in the articular end of which is a cavity, probably a chronic abscess, of the form and size of a hen's egg. This cavity is lined by a soft and vascular membrane, a line in thickness, and it contained a serous fluid. c 220 FIRST SERIES. There is a small aperture in one side of the cavity, which pene- trates the wall of the bone; but, with this exception, the bone around the cavity appears healthy, and the joint is not implicated. 83. A section of the upper part of a Tibia, and of a large Medullary Tumour which has formed within it. The tumour consists partly of a soft, brown, fibrous-looking substance, and partly of coagulated blood; and there are some small cysts in it. A thin crust of the expanded walls of the bone surrounds the tumour. Upon the upper part of the tumour, in the situation of the articular surface of the tibia, there is a deep excavation which lodged one of the condyles of the femur. The diseased structure appears to have originated in the cancellous tissue of the head of the tibia, and is exactly circumscribed ; the shaft below it is healthy. 84. A section of the lower part of a Femur, the cancellous tissue of which is filled by a pale brownish, flocculent, and shreddy, medul- lary substance. The walls of the bone and the cartilage are sound, except at the posterior part of one of the condyles, where they are absorbed; and the morbid growth protruding from within the bone is connected with several similar medullary tumours formed around the bone. 85. Section of a Molar Tooth, and of a small, nodulated, hard, ivory-like, bony Tumour, which has grown from the base of the crown and from one of the fangs. 86 Portions of a Humerus with which a Tumour is connected, which apparently originated in the bone. The greater part of the body of the humerus has disappeared. The tumour connecting the remaining portions of the bone consists of soft pale sub- stance of gelatinous aspect, in the centre of which is a large cavity which contained a thick serous fluid. The brachial artery and nerves are attached to the exterior of the tumour, but they are healthy. The tumour had a constant and regular pulsation, which ceased on compression of the subclavian artery, but the cause of which was not discovered in the exami- nation of the limb. The patient was an old woman.DISEASES OF BONE. 21 87. Portions of a Tibia and Fibula, which suffered Necrosis after a compound fracture. The fractured ends of both bones have overlapped, and exfoliation of the ends of the tibia has commenced. There is a superficial groove between the dead and the living bone, with an irregular deposit of new bone upon the contiguous surface of the latter. 88. The lower half of a Tibia which, like the last described, suffered Necrosis after a compound fracture. The fractured ends lay at some distance from each other, and have been united by two lateral bridges of bone extended transversely between them. The necrosed end of the upper portion is almost exfoliated, and new bone is abundantly formed on the adjacent living bone. 89. Sections of a Tibia showing the reparative results of inflamma- tion after a compound fracture. The union of the fractured ends of the bone is effected by an irregular and very abundant deposit of hard and heavy new bone ; and for a considerable space above and below the place of union, the medullary tissue is consolidated. The surrounding tissues, thickened and indu- rated, were firmly adherent to the surface of the bone above and below the place of union. A portion of the thickened tissue has been detached and turned downwards. 90. A portion of the Fibula from the same limb as the preceding. Its fractured ends overlap each other and are united by bone formed between them. 91. Sections of the stump of a Humerus, exhibiting the results of Atrophy from long disuse after amputation. Its sawn end tapers to a small cone; the walls of the shaft are less than a line in thickness, light and dry; and nearly all the osseous part of its cancellous tissue being removed, the medullary tube appears, after maceration, like a smooth-walled cavity. 92. Section of a Femur, the shaft of which was fractured about two inches below the lesser trochanter, after atrophy and soft- ening of its texture. The fractured portions have united firmly22 FIRST SERIES. and smoothly, but so that they form an acute angle. The pos- terior surface of the head of the Femur is absorbed where, in the altered position of the lower extremity, it rested on the margin of the acetabulum. The other half of this bone, and the opposite femur, which was similarly frac- tured and united, are preserved in Sub-series C, No. 116. The patient, who was about fifty-six vears old, had been bedridden for some years before the fractures occurred; they were both produced while he was being turned in bed. Presented by William James Jones, Esq. 93. Portions of a Femur, Tibia, and Fibula, dried, with some of the surrounding parts. A peculiar change of structure, apparently similar to that shown in No. 78, has taken place in the femur. Its surface is extensively ulcerated from the condyles upwards, and it has been broken or ulcerated through the shaft just above the condyles. Irregular deposits of osseous matter have taken place in the soft parts around the diseased bone, and on the shaft at the borders of the ulceration. 94 Sections of the Femur of a young subject, in which there has been an Abscess in the cancellous texture just above the con- dyles. There are irregular ulcerated apertures m the walls ot the bone through which the matter passed from the cancellous texture into the surrounding soft parts. For some distance beyond the seat of the abscess, deposits of new bone have taken place upon the outer surface of the femur, and the layers of the Lll are separated. The texture of the whole of the bone » light, dry, fragile, and white. 95 Section of a Tumour occupying the situation of the head and upper third of the shaft of the Tibia. The external surface of the tumour is covered in by the aponeurosis which invested the knee-joint, and by remains of the walls of the bone extended and thinned around it. At the upper part of the tumour are the semilunar cartilages and the articular surface of he tibia in a sound state but enlarged. Internally the tumour consists of a mixture of soft medullary substance and bone disposed in the form of large cells or cysts of various size and ^Pe some of which were filled by a clear yellow fluid others by coagulated blood. The walls of the cells consist of mem-DISEASES OF BONE. 23 brane with bony fibres dispersed through it. Between the cells are considerable spaces, filled by soft and shreddy medullary substance, which extends for a short distance into the interior of the shaft of the tibia, and then terminates with an abruptly circumscribing line. 96. The other half of the Tumour last described. All the soft sub- stance having been removed by maceration, the irregular bony plates and fibres are displayed which contributed to form the walls of the cells or cysts in the interior of the tumour. From a woman thirty years old. The disease, beginning after a fall on the knee, had existed two years and a half, and had gradually increased without pain. She recovered after the amputation of the limb. See Case Book, vol. i. p. 57, No. 102; an extract from a fuller account of the case by Mr. Lawrence in tho Medieo-CHrurgical Transactions, vol. xvii. p. 35. London, 1832. 97. Section of a Femur and of a Tumour surrounding the lower part of its shaft. The tumour consists of a mixture of medullary substance and a firm tissue like that of a fibrous tumour or fibro- cartilage with spicula of bone dispersed through it. At its posterior part are some thick-walled membranous cells or cysts which were filled with coagulated blood. The injection of the limb has displayed minute vessels distributed irregularly through the tumour. The walls of the femur enclosed within the tumour are diseased, softened, and thinned, to the extent of about two inches; and in this situation the shaft is broken, and the can- cellous tissue is filled by a morbid structure similar to that which surrounds the bone. 98. Section of the Tumour last described. The patient was twenty-two years old, an opera dancer, and the disease had existed about seven months. The tumour grew rapidly and with much pain. Ho died shortly after amputation of the limb; and no other part was found diseased. Case Book, vol. i. p. 50, No. 103. 99. Section of a Tibia exhibiting a peculiar change of structure, with extensive ulceration, and necrosis of a portion of its walls and medullary texture. A cavity between the diseased bone and the periosteum was filled by purulent fluid. Above and below the chiefly diseased part the walls of the bone are thickened and indurated.FIRST SERIES. 100. A Skull from a Lunatic. The large portion of the parietal and occipital bones comprising about a third of the whole vault of the skull, as well as the small pieces which lie around it, were exfoliated in consequence of a burn. The size of the aperture left in the upper and back part of the skull was, during the twelve years in which the man survived the injury, in a very slight degree diminished by the growth of bone from its margins. The exposed part of the dura mater was covered by a dense tissue like that of an ordinary cicatrix. The patient was twenty-three years old when, after many attempts to commit ' suicide, he laid his head on a fire and remained till the whole of the scalp was completely charred and a portion of the hone was calcined. The process of exfoliation of the bone occupied eighteen months : but a complete cicatrix formed. When he recovered, the patient, though still insane, did not again attempt to destroy himself. Case Book, vol. i. p. 148, No. 171. 101. The second Phalanx of a Thumb, separated after necrosis which was connected with a Whitlow (Paronychia). 102. A Lower Jaw, nearly the whole body of which suffered Ne- crosis after the administration of a few grains of calomel in a case of fever. The dead bone is in part separated, and a small quantity of new bone is deposited around it. 103. Portion of a Tibia, with a circumscribed smooth-walled cavity in the cancellous texture of its head, which cavity was filled by pus, and is lined by a soft vascular membrane. It nearly resembles the cavity shown in No. 70, and opens by two apertures through the walls of the tibia; but the rest of the bone appears healthy. 104. Portion of a Tarsus, exhibiting Necrosis of the Os Calcis. The whole of the internal cancellous texture of the bone has perished, and was in process of separation from the thin osseous layer constituting its walls. The necrosis appears to have succeeded to a diffuse suppuration through the os calcis. 105. An Osseous Tumour, which was removed from the humerus of a boy fourteen years old. It was situated at the insertion of the pectoralis major. Its outer surface is covered by periosteum. Internally it consists in part of a white and denseDISEASES OF BONE. 25 osseous texture, and in the rest of its extent of a cancellous texture, the cells of which were filled by an oily fluid. At the bottom of the bottle are portions of the tumour which were separated in the operation. 106. The second Phalanx of a great Toe, near the end of the upper surface of which there is an osseous tumour composed of hard and finely cancellous bone. Presented by Robert Liston, Esq. 107. The second Phalanx of a great Toe, which was removed by operation. The nail is raised and pushed aside by a tumour beneath it. A small portion of the tumour has been removed for the purpose of showing that it consists, like the last described, of hard osseous substance. Presented by Robert Liston, Esq. 108. A Section of the lower half of a Femur, and of an Osteoid Tumour which has formed around it. The tumour consists almost entirely of a solid, uniform, and very dense osseous substance. The medullary tissue of nearly all that part of the bone which is surrounded by the tumour is filled by a similar substance, and about the condyles, the walls of the femur being absorbed, the morbid growths within and without form one mass. A part of the exterior of the tumour is composed of a soft fatty-looking substance. 109. The other Section of the Femur and Osteoid Tumour last described. By maceration, the soft matter of the tumour has been removed, leaving only the hard, dense, and white osseous substance around and within the bone. The outer surface of this portion of the tumour is nodulated, and portions of it have a fibrous texture like that of pumice-stone. In the lower part of the bottle are several of the inguinal and lumbar lymphatic glands from the same side of the body as the tumour. They are converted into an osseous substance similar to that of which the tumour is composed. 110. The Femoral Artery, together with several Bony Tumoursgq FIRST SERIES. Which occupied the situation of the lymphatic glands in the ham and groin of the patient from whom the two preced.ng specimens were taken. The tumours consist of a hard osseous substance, which is displayed by a section of one of them. The femoral artery is sound, but its popliteal portion is com- pressed and altered in its course by its connexion with the bony tumours. The ligature upon the artery, about three inches below the origin of the profunda, was placed around it in consequence of the tumour in the ham having a pulsation and other characters like those of an aneurism. The patient was a man thirty years old. The swelling seemed to have its origin in a fall on the right knee; it began at the front, and gradually extended round the lower part, of the thigh. It pulsated like an aneunsm, and when a part of it was punctured, arterial blood flowed. The femoral artery bemg twd, L pulsation ceased and the tumour for a time diminished ; but xt afterwards again enlarged, and the patient died exhausted. The femoral artery was com- pressed and displaced by the diseased glands. The case » reco.decI by Mr. Stanley, in the Medico-Chirurgical Transactions, vol. xxvm. p. 30o, 1S45. 111 Section of a Femur, and of a large spheroidal Tumour which has formed around it. In the upper part of the bone a frac- ture occurred several years before death. The two portions of bone overlapping have firmly united. The tumour, which nearly surrounds the middle of the shaft, is composed of a very firm substance, like fibro-cartilage. A portion of the same substance occupies the corresponding part of the me- dullary cavity, in which the disease has apparently commenced. 112 The other section of the Femur last described. Its walls are irregularly thickened, with expansion of their texture and deposit of new bone on their exterior; and together with irregular cavities in the medullary tube, there is thickening and induration of its osseous tissue. 113. Section of a Humerus from the same person as the last- described femur. It was fractured through the middle of its shaft some years before death. The fracture has firmly united, with a perfect apposition of the ends of the bone, and without any obliteration of its medullary cavity ; but there is the same disease of the walls and the cancellous tissue as there is in the femur.DISEASES OP BONK. 27 114. The other half of the preceding specimen macerated. 115. Portion of a Spine, with a Tumour which, originating in the heads of the ribs, has extended into the cavity of the chest, and, through the holes giving passage to the nerves, into the vertebral canal, where it compresses the spinal cord within the fourth and fifth dorsal vertebrae. That part of the tumour which projects into the chest is covered by a thick membrane, which apparently originated in the pleura costalis separated from the ribs; a portion of this membrane has been removed. The tumour, which is probably a softened cartilaginous one, consists of a gelatinous substance, in some parts approaching to the firmness of cartilage, and in others very much softer, and resembling boiled sago. The patient was a mail thirty years old. The compression of the spinal cord produced complete paralysis of the pelvic organs and the lower extremities. 116. Section of a Tumour and of part of a Tibia. The tumour occupies the situation of the head and the upper third of the shaft of the tibia: it apparently originated in the interior of the bone, and extended the wall around it as it grew. At the upper part, the articular surfaces of the tibia and the liga- mentum patellae may be recognized. The tumour consists in part of a white, solid, and very firm medullary substance, and in part of a more vascular and spongy substance, in which there are large cells that were filled by a gelatinous fluid. From a man aged forty. The limb was removed by operation. 117. The Head of a Tibia with a large osseous Tumour surrounding it. The tumour apparently originated from the external surface of the tibia and beneath the periosteum, which in one situa- tion is seen continued from the tibia upon its external surface. In the centre of the tumour is a large irregular cavity which was filled by purulent fluid, and upon one part of its surface are some smaller cavities which were filled with blood, and the sides of which are formed by a dark coloured and soft substance. A part of the interior of the head of the tibia is occupied by a similar osseous substance.28 FIRST SERIES. 118. Section of a Tumour consisting of nodules of cartilage con- nected by fibro-cellular tissue, and having specks of bone dispersed through it. It was connected with an Os Innomi- natum. The remaining part of it, consisting principa lly of bone, is preserved in the next Sub-series, A. 133. 119. Portion of a bony Cyst which was removed from the external and lateral part of a lower jaw. The cyst is lined by a thick and soft membrane which has been in part separated from it. The cavity of the cyst was filled by a glairy fluid, and at the bottom of it a canine tooth of the second set was adherent to the lining membrane. Upon the exterior of the cyst are some branches of the facial nerve which were removed with it. At the bottom of the bottle is the tooth which was contained in the cyst. 119a Part of a bony Cyst formed by expansion of the walls of ' the lower jaw of a sheep. The cyst was full of fluid, and an incisor tooth is loosely attached to its walls. 120. Section of a Tibia from a Stump, exhibiting the reparative chants which have taken place in the sawn end of the bone. The medullary cavity is closed by a thin layer of new bone and other thin osseous deposits are formed around the end of the stump. 121. Portion of a Femur from a Stump. The medullary cavity is completely closed, and there are two pointed processes of bone which extend upwards from the posterior part of the end of the femur and probably afforded attachment to the flexor muscles. 122 Portions of a Tibia and Fibula from a Stump. At the ex- ' tremity of each bone the medullary cavity is completely closed by new bone; and a bridge of new bone extends between the tibia and fibula, uniting them firmly together. 123 A Knee-Joint. A section of the head of the tibia shows a small portion of dead bone in the centre of its cancellous tex-•J)t DISEASES OF BONE. tiire. A piece of glass is passed through a fistulous passage extending from the skin covering the front part of the head of the tibia, to the dead bone in its centre. The synovial mem- brane of the knee-joint is very vascular and is covered upon its internal surface by a layer of lymph, into which the injec- tion has freely passed from the vessels of the synovial mem- brane. From a young woman, in whom the amputation of the limb was performed on account of the inflammation in the knee-joint consequent on the necrosis of the head of the tibia. The necrosis had existed many years. 124. Section of a Tibia with a vascular malignant fungus growing out of its cancellous texture, the internal surface of its poste- rior wall, and the surrounding soft parts. 125. The other Section of the Tibia last described, together with the Fibula. The tibia exhibits the destruction of a portion of its shaft, and new bone is thinly deposited upon the surrounding surface of the tibia and fibula. 126. Section of the lower part of a Tibia and of a malignant fungous growth from the integuments, such as probably preceded the destruction of the bone in the preceding specimens. 127. Section of a Tibia, the other half of the specimen, No. 126. The periosteum has been in part separated from the bone for the purpose of showing its altered state, and that the bone is sound. The periosteum is increased in thickness and of a soft flocculent texture ; and the morbid growth, which, as the speci- men No. 126 shows, apparently originated in the skin, is here traced to the periosteum. The principal part of the growth is composed of close-set groups of vascular, leaf-like, and warty prominences bounded by an elevated abrupt margin, beyond which the skin is nearly healthy. 128. Section of a Femur from a young woman, in which a fracture was produced by the action of the surrounding muscles. The walls of the bone are much thinner than natural; but its sub-30 FIRST SERIES. stance apparently contained the usual proportion of earthy matter. The fracture is imperfectly united. Presented by W. J. Wilson, Esq., Manchester. 129. Section of a Femur in which that change of structure has taken place which is usually denominated Mollities Ossium. The walls of the bone are very thin, and their substance so soft as to be readily divided by a knife. The osseous lamellae and filaments are removed from the cancellous texture ; and the medullary cavity and all the cells of the cancellous tex- ture are filled by a fatty substance, which is now, after mace- ration and the action of alcohol, of the consistence of lard. 130. Section of a Humerus from the same subject as No. 129. The walls of the bone are thin, but of their natural hardness. The adipose substance filling the medullary cavity and cancellous texture is converted by maceration into a white firm substance resembling adipocire.

The dead bone is separated and there is a considerable quantity of new bone formed around it In consequence of inflammation extending to the hip-joint, ulceration has taken place in the head and neck of the bone.3J DISEASES OF BONE. A portion of the head of the bone remains, but it has been separated in the line of the epiphysis. 133. Section of a Tibia from a Boy, in which there has been Ne- crosis of a large portion of the whole thickness of the wall. The largest piece of the dead bone has been removed from the cavity in which it lay and is preserved in the next following preparation. The outer surface of this piece of dead bone, as well as of that which remains in this specimen, is quite smooth, the periosteum having separated without any portions of bone attached to it. On the inner surface of the separated periosteum, a layer of new bone, half an inch thick, and form- ing almost a complete new wall to the tibia, has been pro- duced. The outer surface of this new bone is covered by the old periosteum, the continuity of which with that of the arti- cular ends is shown ; and the inner surface of the new bone is lined by a soft vascular membrane, which was in close contact with the outer surface of the dead bone. A portion of skin is left, which formed part of the boundaries of an external ulcer, exposing the dead bone on the front of the leg. Presented by Sir James M'Gregor. 133a. The dead and separated portion of the Tibia last described. 134. Section of a Femur, with the Femoral Artery and Vein at- tached to it. The bristles in the cut surface of the femur mark the boundaries of a cavity in the bone which is filled by soft substance. From this cavity it was presumed, from the history of the case, that a portion of dead bone had been extracted during the lifetime of the patient. Upon the surface of the femur there is an irregular deposit of bone thickening its wall: and to this the femoral vessels are very firmly adherent. The femoral artery is sound and of its full diameter in its whole extent. The femoral vein is also of healthy texture, but is much contracted in that part which ad- heres to the femur and lies within the tendinous sheath con- taining the vessels just before their passage into the ham: below this part there are clots in both the vein and the artery. From a middle-aged woman, who died with dry gangrene of the leg.32 FIRST SERIKS 135. Section of a Tumour, with the portion of the Lower Jaw from which it originated. The portion of jaw comprises the whole of its left ramus, condyle, and body, to within a short distance of the symphysis. The morbid growth apparently or.ginated in the cancellous texture of the jaw ; a part of its outer sur- face being formed by the walls of the bone expanded over it. It consists of a white and firm, nearly homogeneous, substance, with specks of osseous matter dispersed through it. The patient, was a man about twenty-two years of age. He recovered qu.ckly after the removal of these parts. 136. Sections of a Tumour, with the portion of the Lower Jaw from which it originated. The portion of jaw removed oy opera- tion comprises the whole of its ramus, except the condyle, with the whole of the same side of its body to the symphysis.

A growth of short, vertically-Placed, osseous fibres and lamellae has taken place on large extent of both the external and internal surface of 1 cranium. They probably formed the basis ^ or medullary tumour. The bone is completely perfoiated by many minute apertures. 138. Portion of the Os Innominatum of a young person- The bone is increased in thickness by the separation of its layers and the expansion of its cells. Its texture is very light and brittle. 13, Seefio, of .he head and ^^^^ occupies .he place of .he cance ous and extends some way down the medullary cavity.

A portion of the periosteum is separated, to show that the morbid growth has originated beneath the membrane from the surface of the bone itself. The smaller tumour connected with one side of the morbid mass occupied the situation of the popliteal lymphatic glands, and consists throughout of bone, partly ivory-like and partly spongy. 140. The other half of the Tibia and Tumour last described, from which the soft matter has been removed by maceration. 141. Section of the Stump of the Femur from the same patient as the specimens 139 and 140. The extremity of the bone is covered by skin. Within the medullary cavity are distinct morbid deposits, consisting partly of osseous, and partly of soft, matter. The patient was a middle-aged woman in whom the disease made slow progress for sixteen years, and gave little or no pain till three months before the amputation of the limb. She died eight weeks after the amputation with similar osteoid growths in the inguinal glands and lungs, and with wart-like tumours scattered over the diaphragm. 142. Section of a Femur from a Stump, exhibiting an irregular osseous deposit upon its surface, immediately above its extremity which has perished. 143. The Tibia of a Dog, in which Necrosis of part of the shaft was produced by destruction of the Medulla. The dead bone was separated by natural processes, and has been removed, with the exception of a small portion which is distinguishable in the centre of the new osseous cylinder. The new bone presents a very irregular external surface, and is firmly united to the articular ends of the old bone. The preparation was obtained by an experiment made by Mr. Stanley. 144. Portions of a Tibia and Fibula from a Stump. The fibula is united to the tibia by ossification of the interosseous ligament. An irregular deposit of new bone has taken place on the ex- ternal surface of both bones for a considerable distance above their extremities. DM FIBST SERIES. 145. Portion of an upper Jaw with two molar teeth, which separated by exfoliation. From a boy aged six years. The necrosis was consequent on a severe blow upon the face. 146. Portion of a lower Jaw containing a bicuspid and two molar teeth, which separated by exfoliation. From a boy aged four years. The necrosis occurred without any apparent cause. The loss of this portion of the jaw was completely repaired. Presented by Alexander Anderson, Esq. 147. Sections of a Tumour with the side of the body of the lower Jaw in which it originated; removed by operation. Part of the mucous membrane of the mouth, unaltered in structure, is extended over the upper surface of the tumour. The disease originated in the cancellous texture of the jaw. The walls of the bone are expanded into a thin case enclosing the tumour, but, in consequence of the absorp- tion of the bone in some situations, this case is incomplete. The morbid growth consists of granules of a peculiar fatty-looking substance, partitioned by fibro-cellular tissue, and having cells dispersed through it, which cells contained a glairy fluid. The boundaries of some of the cells are thin plates of bone, apparently the remains of the original cancellous texture of the jaw. From a man aged twenty-five. 148. Sections of a Tumour with the portion of the lower Jaw in which it originated ; removed by operation. The portion ot the jaw taken away includes one side of it, from the angle to within a short distance of the symphysis. Part of the mucous membrane of the mouth, unaltered in structure, is extended over the tumour. The tumour, originating in the cancellous texture of the jaw, is surrounded by a thin shell of bone, formed by the remains of the walls of the jaw. The tumour consists of a solid and very compact fibrous substance of a greyish colour, irregularly intersected by white fibres. From a female aged Fourteen. 149. Sections of a Tumour and of the portion of the lower Jaw. inDISEASES OF BONE. 35 which it originated ; removed by operation. The portion of the jaw comprises its whole side, from the angle to within a short distance of the symphysis. The morbid growth consists of a grey, dense, fibrous substance, originating from the alveolar border and from the outer surface of the jaw. Part of the alveolar border of the jaw has been absorbed; and in this situation the morbid growth appears to extend into the bone. The contiguous substance of the jaw is of an ivory-like hardness, and its cancellous texture is consolidated. From a female aged thirty. 150. Sections of a Tumour which formed in the side of the neck immediately below the seat of the operation by which the parts last described were removed. The tumour consists throughout of a firm fibrous substance. The irregularity of surface and looser texture which it presents in one situation result from the ulceration and sloughing of its substance, which commenced a short time before death. With the smaller section of the tumour is connected a part of the lower jaw : its texture is sound, but the morbid growth is closely attached to its surface. Other portions of the same are shown in No. 251. 151. Sections of a Tumour, which occupied the situation of the superior Maxillary Bone and was removed by operation. The whole of the natural structure of the superior maxillary bone has disappeared. The mucous membrane which covered the palatine surface of the bone extends over a part of the tumour. The morbid growth consists of a moderately firm fatty-looking substance, with minute cells and spicula of bone dispersed through it. From a man aged forty-six. The disease returned after the operation, and the patient died in consequence of hemorrhage from ulceration of the internal carotid artery which became involved in an extension of the disease. 152. Sections of the upper part of a Femur. The medullary canal of the bone is filled by firm fibrous substance. Around this substance the walls of the bone are converted into a loose flocculent texture. In the upper part of the specimen this change has extended completely through the walls of the bone: in the lower part it appears to be commencing d 23U first series; upon the inside of the bone contiguous to the tibrous substance filling the medullary canal. The head and neck of the femur, and the os innominatum of the same side had undergone similar alterations in structure. From a man aged fifty-five. 153 A Great Toe with its Metatarsal Bone removed by operation. There has been necrosis of a port.on of the interior of the me- tatarsal bone. The sequestrum lies within a cavity which is lined by soft and vascular substance, and opens externally by fistulous apertures in the skin. The inflammation accompanying the processes consequent on the necrosis of the metatarsal bone has extended to the first joint of the toe, and has pro- duced the complete destruction of the articular cartilages. 154. Section of a Humerus, with a Tumour which was attached to it There is a portion of skin connected with the tumour and the surrounding muscles; and the cicatrix in the skin is the result of an operation which was performed for the removal of a tumour which occupied the situation of that here shown. The disease being reproduced, it was deemed necessary to amputate the arm at the shoulder joint. Both the arter.es and veins are filled with red wax, which having been injected into the brachial artery returned freely by the veins Part of the tumour is situated in the biceps muscle ; the other part of it extends to the bone, on the outer surface of which there is an irregular cavity, in which a small portion of the tumour was imbedded. From this cavity several small canals deeply penetrate the bone ; and the medulla in this part of the bone was softer and more vascular than elsewhere. On one of its surfaces the tumour has a very close connexion with the vessels and nerves of the limb. The tumour is soft and of a medullary character. From a female aged twenty-five. 155 Portion of the Femur from a stump. A circle of bone at the extremity of the stump has separated after necrosis A con- siderable deposit of new bone has taken place upon the surface of the femur, and forms a thick ring above the part from which the dead portion separated.DISEASES OF BONE. 37 156. Portion of a Spine in which there are several excavations upon the front and sides of the bodies of the eleventh and twelfth dorsal and first lumbar vertebrae. These excavated surfaces formed part of the boundaries of an aneurism of the aorta. Around the excavations there are some deposits of new bone. 157. Sections of the second phalanx of a Great Toe, exhibiting the growth of an osseous exostosis from its extremity. The bony growth was immediately surrounded by a soft and fibrous substance which formed part of an external tumour projecting from beneath the nail. From a man aged thirty. 158. The greater part of the shaft of a young person's Fibula, which was attacked by Necrosis. The death of the bone occurred without obvious cause ; its separation was effected by exfoliation, and new bone was formed in its place. 159. Section of the lower part of a Tibia and of a Tumour con- tained within it. The tumour consists of a brain-like medullary substance, with blotches of blood effused in it, and is almost completely surrounded by a thick osseous cyst which is continuous with the wall of the tibia. It may be presumed that the morbid deposit commenced in the interior of the bone, and that, as it grew, so also the bone grew around it, with internal absorption and external deposit of new bone, and thus formed the osseous cyst. The arteries of the limb are injected; some of their branches pass through the morbid growth. 160. The other half of the Tibia and of the Tumour last de- scribed. A portion of skin is here left, in which there is ulceration with fungous growth originating in the morbid structure. The cavity immediately above the cartilage of the ankle joint was filled by soft medullary substance. The two preceding specimens were presented by Joseph Swan, Esq. The iinib was amputated by Mr. Hey, of Leeds.38 FIRST SERIES. 161. Portions of a Tibia which were separated by exfoliation. From a girl twelve years old. 162. Sections of the lower part of a Femur, enlarged and having a cavity in its interior. The cancelli and the wall of the bone surrounding this cavity exhibit a natural texture. Upon the outer surface of the bone, corresponding with the cavity m its interior, there is a considerable deposit of new bone, apparently the result of irritation of the periosteum. It is not known what the cavity in the femur contained, nor under what cir- cumstances it was formed. 163. Sections of the head and upper part of a Tibia. Portions of the bone, from long-continued inflammation, are irregularly excavated by ulceration, and the whole of its texture is porous and spongy. The limb was amputated in consequence of destructive inflammation of the knee joint. 164. Portion of the shaft of a Humerus separated by exfoliation, after Necrosis following amputation. The patient was a middle-aged man. The amputation was performed on account of a compound fracture. 165. The Finger of an adult, in which there is Necrosis of the first phalanx in one half of its length including the distal articu ar end The extent of the dead bone is marked by bristles introduced between it and the surrounding parts. The sepa- ration of the dead bone is complete, but no new bone has been formed in its place. 166 Portions of a Humerus from a case of Necrosis. They were removed by operation from a young person. In the upper end of the larger portion, the mark of the application of the trephine may be recognized. 167. Portion of a Lower Jaw, including its angle and a great part of the ramus, which was separated by exfoliation. From a young person in whom the necrosis had arisen without any evident cause. Presented by J. G. Perry, Esq.DISEASES OF BONE. 3.0 168. A Lower Jaw which was separated after Necrosis; from a Girl twenty years old. Previous to the necrosis the whole of the jaw had been covered by a formation of porous, hard, greyish, new bone; and this, which extends even over the condyles and coronoid processes, perished with the original substance of the jaw, and was exfoliated with it. The disease commenced six years before the removal of the jaw. In the operation for removal the middle of the jaw was cut from the rest and extracted first; one lateral half was removed the next day; and the other, three weeks afterwards. The wound made in the operation, and the sinuses which had led to the diseased bone, healed quickly, and the patient recovered completely; re- gaining the power of mastication with those of the lower teeth which remained imbedded in the gum after the removal of the jaw. Presented by J. G. Perry, Esq.; by whom a further account of the case is given in the Medico-Cliirurgical Transactions, "Vol. xxi. p. 290. Case Book, Vol. i. p. 117, No. 142. 169. An Os Calcis, of which a portion has been exfoliated after Necrosis. There is anchylosis between the os calcis and os cuboides. 170. Section of a Femur with the osseous part of a Tumour which occupied the place of the shaft of the bone. The tumour measured thirty-six inches in circumference. Its larger and outer part consisted of medullary substance ; the smaller and deeper, of a mixture of medullary substance and bone. The head of the femur is the only portion of the bone retaining its healthy structure. The morbid osseous substance is fragile, light, spongy, and cancellous; but the form of the cancellous spaces differs materially from that of those in healthy bone. From a girl aged eleven years. 171. Sections of the Femur last described. Presented by Joseph Sargent, Esq. 172. Portion of a Tibia in which a large piece of the middle of the shaft has been destroyed by ulceration and necrosis extending gradually through it. The remaining bone is light, brittle, and porous, and there is a deposit of new bone on its surface above and below the diseased part. Removed by amputation from a middle-aged man : the disease was the conse- quence of external injury from a rope coiled round the leg. Presented by Edgar Barker, Esq.40 FIRST SERIES. 173. Section of the articular ends of a Femur and Tibia, and of an Astragalus, from a boy whose limb was amputated. The bones are enlarged, chiefly by the expansion of their cells. Some of the enlarged cells are filled by healthy marrow; others by semi-fluid jelly : and some by a substance present- ing all the characters of healthy cartilage. Both the knee and ankle joints are anchylosed by adhesion of the opposite surfaces of the synovial membrane, and in the ankle joint there is also a partial osseous union. 174. The remaining portions of the bones last described. The removal of the soft matter from the interior of the bones by maceration displays the enlarged cells, and unusually numerous thin osseous laminae along the medullary tube. On the card marked A, is the other half of the section of the shaft of the Tibia, and on that marked B, are portions of necrosed bone which were removed by the patient himself from his tibia five years before the amputation of the limb. 175 A Tibia in which there has been Necrosis of a large portion of the shaft, including a part of its lower articular end. The dead bone remains inclosed within a case of new bone. Presented by Gumey Turner, Esq. 176 Section of the Shaft of a Femur, exhibiting a fistulous cavity ' in its interior, with Necrosis of a small portion of the inner layers of its wall. Two bristles are placed in a groove ex- tending to some depth between the dead, and the contiguous living, bone. A vascular membrane, having a soft velvet-like surface, lines the fistulous cavity in the bone. The limh was removed by amputation. Thirty-five years previous to the amputation, the femur was fractured; this was followed by abscess in the soft 11 and the formation of a fistulous passage extending mto he cavUy m the Ltelr of the bone, which passage remained open during the whole penod from the fracture to the removal of the limb. Presented by James Pritchard, Esq., Leamington, 177. The other half of the bone, No. 176, macerated. 178. A cartilaginous and osseous Tumour, removed by operationDISEASES OP BONE. 41 from the femur, just above the inner condyle, of a girl sixteen years old. The exterior of the tumour is covered by a thin layer of dense fibrous tissue ; beneath this is a layer of cartilaginous substance, enclosing the bone, which has a can- cellous texture and contains medulla. 179. Ring of bone exfoliated from the end of a Femur after amputation. 180. Part of the shaft of the Ulna of a child four years of age, separated by exfoliation. The cause of the necrosis was unknown. 181. The greater part of the superior Maxillary Bone of a child five years of age, separated by exfoliation. The cause of the necrosis was unknown. 182. A Cartilaginous and Osseous Tumour, removed from the metatarsal bone of the great toe of a man nineteen years old. The interior of the tumour consists of cancellous bone, the cells of which are filled by marrow. Its exterior is formed by a thin layer of cartilaginous substance ; and it is invested by fibro-cellular tissue. 183. Section of a similar Tumour removed by operation from the lower and inner part of the Femur of a man nineteen years old. The interior of the tumour consists of cancellous bone, the cells of which are filled by marrow. Its exterior is formed by a layer of cartilaginous substance. The tumour had been united to the femur by a narrow neck which, it is probable, was broken by external violence: for, in the operation, the narrow neck of the tumour was found connected with the femur only by soft substance, being fitted to an excavation in the femur upon which it had freely moved. 184. The Head of a Tibia in which there are numerous cavities, the remains of Abscesses within the bone. 185. Section of a Girl's face in which syphilitic Necrosis and Ulce-42 FIRST SERIES. ration affected large portions of the maxillary and malar bones. The separate portions of bone were exfoliated. 186. Sections of a Femur from the surface of which an osseous growth has arisen. The growth is of a flattened, elongated form, attached by a broad base, and with pointed processes directed downwards: it presents a cancellous texture sur- rounded by a thin shell of compact bone. The walls of the femur and its medullary cavity in the situation of the exostosis are perfectly sound. 187. Ring of Bone exfoliated from the end of a Tibia after am- putation. 188. Portion of a Tibia exhibiting a superficial Necrosis of its walls. The formation of the groove between the dead and the living bone has commenced; and there is a deposit of new bone around the dead bone. The other section, macerated, is in the next Sub-series, a. 103. 189 Masses of Osseous substance with small portions of the bones of the Pelvis upon which they had formed. The osseous substance consists of fine filaments loosely cohering together : it formed part of a large tumour. 190. Sections of Lumbar Vertebrae with Melanotic matter deposited in the cancellous texture of their bodies. 191. Sections of a Rib with Melanotic matter deposited in its interior. 192 Portions of a Parietal and a Frontal Bone displaying the deposi- ' tion of Melanotic matter in the diploe. In all these specimens the melanotic matter is deposited in circumscribed spots, like so much black pigment, in the bones. It does not form tumours, nor does the tissue of the bone in which it lies appear at all altered.. The three preceding preparations were taken from a wouum, Iron: whom the tunlo^No. 43 in Lies XXXV, was removed. Melanotic maUer wasDISEASES OF BONE. 48 abundantly deposited in various parts of the body, the lungs, liver, ovaries, mammary gland, dura mater, and others. 193. A Clavicle, in which a piece of the cancellous texture near its sternal end has suffered necrosis. The dead bone lies loose within a cavity, in which it is partially exposed by apertures formed in the surrounding walls of the bone. 194. A Great Toe with its Metatarsal Bone removed by operation. There is a broad flat growth of cancellous bone from the under part of the distal extremity of the metatarsal bone. The patient was a man about thirty years old. In consequence of a lace- ration of the soft parts in the sole, there remained a cicatrix on the under and inner edge of the foot. The irritation in the surrounding parts, excited by the pressure on this cicatrix in progression, was the cause of the growth of bone. 195. Sections of a Tibia, from a Boy eighteen years of age, exhibit- ing the effects of acute inflammation in its medullary tissue and periosteum. Lymph and pus are abundantly deposited in the cancellous tissue throughout its whole extent. Irregular ulcerations extend through the cancellous structure of the bone at each of its extremities, and have passed through the articular cartilages into the knee and ankle-joints; suppura- tion has also taken place between the epiphyses and the shaft. The periosteum, separated from the shaft of the bone in nearly its whole length, is very vascular, thick, pulpy, and velvet- like on its inner surface. Other bones from the knee and ankle-joints of the same patient are in the next Series, No. 46. 196. Sections of the Humerus, from a young person in whom there had been long standing disease in and around the elbow-joint. A very thick layer of new osseous substance has formed around the shaft to the borders of its articular surface. This osseous substance presents a vascular cancellous texture, and is sur- rounded by a layer of compact substance which is covered by the periosteum of the original bone. 197. Sections of the Ulna from the same Elbow-Joint. The same44 FIRST SERIES. changes have occurred here; the shaft of the ulna is sur- rounded by a very thick layer of cancellous osseous substance covered by a layer of compact bone and by the periosteum of the original bone. 198. Sections of the Radius from the same Elbow-Joint. This bone, also, has undergone the same changes as have occurred around the humerus and ulna. It is doubtful whether the new bone formed in this remarkable case were a deposit between the periosteum and the surface of the shaft, over which deposit a layer of compact tissue was developed; or whether the disease consisted in the expansion of the walls of the bones by the gradual separation of their outer from their inner layers, and in the formation of cancellous new bone between them. 199. Section of a Boy's Tibia, in which there is Necrosis of the middle half of the shaft, with detachment of the soft parts from the whole circumference of the dead portion. The sepa- ration of the dead bone from the living has commenced, and is marked on the cut surface and exterior of the bone by ulcerated grooves. It is probable from the history of the case that the necrosis commenced in inflammation of the periosteum, followed by extensive suppuration around the bone. 200. The other half of the Tibia last described. 201. The lower end of a Femur. The whole of the exterior of the bone is roughened by the growth of irregular plates and pointed processes of osseous substance. A large canal formed by ulceration passes obliquely through the bone from before backwards, just above the condyles, and communicates widely with a cavity occupying nearly the whole of the interior of the internal condyle. Around the lower part of each con- dyle there is a broad rim of new bone. The space between the condyles on the anterior aspect of the femur is deeply ulcerated. From a man thirty-five years old, who had had disease of the knee-joint for twenty-five years. Case Book, Vol. i., p. 136, No. 161. 202 The inferior angle of a Scapula with a section of a tumour growing from it. The base and interior of the tumour consist of cancellous bone, which is continuous with the cancellous45 DISEASES OF BONE. tissue of the scapula. The exterior is formed by a layer of cartilage of irregular thickness, and the whole is invested by libro-cellular tissue. Presented by W. Beaumont, Esq. 203. Section of a Tumour occupying parts of the seventh, eighth, and ninth ribs of the left side. The tumour is composed of a highly vascular medullary substance, in which there are some cells that were filled with serous fluid, and a few small masses of coagulated blood. The osseous substance of the ribs ap- peared to be expanded within the tumour, which in several parts presented small points of bone. The cartilage of one of the ribs is completely surrounded by the morbid structure, but is itself unaltered. 204. Portion of the Femur of a Child which separated in conse- quence of Necrosis. The separated portion includes the whole shaft and neck of the femur, with the exception of some small pieces of the outer layers of the shaft. The recovery of the child after the separation was complete ; the thigh was firm and not much shortened. 205. Portion of a Parietal Bone which separated in consequence of Necrosis. 206. Sections of the upper part of a Femur from a very aged woman. Its texture is remarkably soft and light, and contains an abundance of fatty matter which, in maceration, has assumed the appearance of adipocire. The walls of the Femur are at the thickest part not more than a line in thick- ness : the neck is shortened and is rather less oblique than is natural: the head is reduced in size and irregularly flattened. 207. Portions of a Humerus, Radius, and Ulna. The sections of the humerus exhibit thickening of the medullary membrane, which is in some parts upwards of a line in thickness, and presents an uneven velvet-like surface. A portion of can- cellous tissue has separated after necrosis and lies loose in the medullary cavity. A piece of glass is passed through a long46 FIRST SERIES. fistulous passage leading from the medullary cavity through the lower end of the humerus into the elbow-joint. The greater part of the articular cartilage is removed from the ends of the bones forming the elbow-joint; and the remains of the synovial membrane are thickened. 208. Portion of a Lower Jaw, comprising one side of the bone from the angle to the symphysis, which was removed by operation from a young woman. A soft medullary growth, originating in the interior of the bone, has caused the expan- sion of its surrounding walls. In the upper half of the section the morbid structure has been separated from the cavity in which it was imbedded. 209. The Metacarpal Bone of a Little Finger. The bone is enlarged, apparently by an expansion of its walls; an osseous tumour growing from this bone had been removed some time previous to the amputation of the finger. 210. Portion of the wall of a Tibia separated by exfoliation. The dead bone, which had been diseased some time before it perished, is porous and rough on its outer surface: it com- prises a part only of the thickness of the wall. The disease was connected with syphilitic periostitis. 211. Sections of the extremity of a Stump after amputation above the knee. The lower end of the bone protrudes nearly an inch beyond the extremity of the granulations upon the soft parts. The protruded portion and that immediately adjacent to it had died, and were in process of exfoliation. On the surface of the section, the line of separation between the dead and the living bone is marked by an arched layer of soft fleshy substance, like a layer of granulations, which extends across the cancellous tissue, and is continued less distinctly through the compact wall. In the upper section, the perios- teum and soft parts have been separated from one side of the bone. The surface of the latter is left rough and irregular, and in the lower part of the periosteum a mass of soft spongy47 DISEASES OP BONE. osseous tissue has formed, which nearly surrounds that part of the shaft which was not in a state of necrosis. From a. patient in whom the femoral artery was tied for the cure of an aneu- rism consequent on a wound. After the operation, extensive sloughs formed in the leg, and it was deemed necessary to amputate it ahove the knee. The stump sloughed, and the femur protruded; and the parts preserved in the prepa- ration were removed hy a second amputation, a month after the first. The patient subsequently recovered completely. A wax model of the leg hefore the first amputation is preserved, Cast 140. Case Book, No. 169, p. 145. 212. Section of the lower end of a Femur, in which nearly all the cancellous tissue within the condyles and for a short distance up the shaft is removed, and its place is occupied by a mass of brain-like medullary substance. The greater part of this substance is nearly white, but there are many spots in it of a deep red colour, from effused blood; and at the upper part is a section of a small cavity, which was filled by a soft gelati- nous material. The growth of the mass has expanded the internal condyle and the posterior part of the femur into a large round sac, of which the walls are partly formed by the articular cartilage and the periosteum. 213. Section of the anterior part of a Tibia, in which there are nu- merous small effusions of blood between the periosteum and bone, and in the superficial layers of the bone. From the same limb as the preceding specimen. The patient was a man twenty-seven years old; the disease had existed twelve months with obscure symptoms, and made steady progress till the limb was amputated. Case Book, Vol. i. p. 145, No. 169. 214. Section of the last Phalanx of a Great Toe. A small osseous tumour has grown from the anterior and upper part of the bone, and has elevated the nail; it is formed of cancellous tissue surrounded by a thin layer of compact substance. 215. Half a Pelvis, exhibiting the effects of the growth of Hydatids within the bones. The walls of the ileum are separated, and are in many places absorbed, so that there are large apertures in them, which open into a cavity extending through its whole interior. The same cavity com- municates with that of the pelvis by a large opening in the48 FIRST SERIES. acetabulum, and, by other openings, with a cavity in the interior of the sacrum, and with the spinal canal. There are several apertures in the posterior part of the sacrum. All these cavities were filled with hydatids, which had also protruded through the apertures in the walls of the bones, and were contained in cysts formed by the thickened periosteum and other tissues. 216 Part of the Acephalocyst Hydatids which were contained in , the Bones just described. Some of them are entire, but the maiority have been ruptured. The patient was an elderly woman. There were other hydatids in a large cys connected with the ovary. The disease was of long standing, and the paUent died with suppuration of some of the hydatid cysts. 217 Section of an Os Calcis, in which pus is diffused in many parts of the cancellous tissue. The whole tissue of the bone was soft, and could be easily cut with a knife. From a man seventy years old, all the bones of whose tarsus and metatarsus were similarly diseased. 218. Section of a portion of a Tibia after compound fracture. The whole thickness of the wall at the end of the bone, and a part of its thickness for three inches up the anterior and inner aspect of the shaft, have perished, and are separated from the living tissue by a deep groove. The medullary tissue has retained its vitality, and is increased in vascularity. A ayer of new bone, which in some parts is nearly half an inch thick, has formed on the surface of the shaft around the dead por- tion, and is invested by the original periosteum. The new bone is soft, spongy, and vascular. A portion of the perios- teum has been reflected from the upper part of the shaft, to exhibit the formation of new bone beneath it. 219 The other section of the Tibia and part of the Fibula from ' the same limb, after maceration. An inch of the extremity of the fibula has perished. The surface of the adjacent Dart of the shaft is covered by new bone, which is especally abundant at the lower part, and has coalesced with the new bone on the corresponding part of the t.b.a. A part of4H DISEASES OF BONE. the new bone has been separated from the shaft of the tibia, to show that it was all formed in the periosteum, or between it and the surface of the old bone, and that the latter is unaltered. 220. Portion of a Femur, of which the lower extremity is expanded into a large Cyst, which was filled by liquid and coagulated blood and a small quantity of brain-like medullary substance. The cyst is nearly globular; its walls are from a line to two lines in thickness, composed of thin plates of bone and fibrous membrane, smooth externally, and presenting inter- nally at some parts a rough surface of bone, and at others numerous prominent decussating fibrous bands and cords, like the texture of the basis of a spleen or of erectile tissue. To these bands, as well as to the osseous surface, loose flocculi and small portions of brain-like substance are adherent. Below, the cyst is bounded by the articular cartilages, of which the texture is unaltered; above, by the shaft of the femur which terminates abruptly just before it is expanded into the cyst. The shaft above the cyst presented numerous small spots of effused blood, like ecchymosis beneath the periosteum. From a gentleman thirty years of age, in whom the tumour had heen two years in progress. Four years after the amputation of the limb he was in good health. 221. The upper part of a Femur, the surface of which is irregularly, and for the most part superficially, ulcerated. Small portions only of the external lamellae remain, and these are in many parts covered by a thin layer of new bone. The epiphyses of the great trochanter and the head of the bone have separated. These changes were consequent on sloughing over the great trochanter, which ensued in a prolonged case of psoas abscess in a young subject. 222. The lower part of a Femur, from the front of which a broad flat exostosis had grown, and was removed by operation. The surface from which the exostosis was cut is rough : it is formed of cancellous tissue of healthy aspect. The ex- ostosis was composed of a similar tissue invested by a thin layer of compact substance. The upper margin of the base of the exostosis is very nearly three inches above the border of the articular cartilage of the trochlea of the femur; but it £50 FIRST SERIES.

The dead bone was removed after death. Presented by Carston Holthouse, Esq. 230. The upper half of a Femur, round a portion of which a thin, flat, nodulated, medullary growth, of a soft, spongy, and ob- scurely-fibrous texture formed. The shaft at the part enclosed by the diseased structure was broken by a slight force. Its texture at this part appears soft, and is perforated by many small apertures. Prom a woman forty-three years old, whose right breast had been removed, with a medullary tumour in it, three months before death. 231. Sections of a small oval Tumour, composed of cartilage and bone, which was removed from the inner and lower part of a Femur. The cartilaginous part of the tumour forms a smooth layer, from one to two lines in thickness, which invests the osseous part, and is itself invested by a thin layer of fibro- cellular tissue. The osseous part of the tumour is formed of a delicate cancellous texture, filled with medulla, and was attached to the femur by a narrow base. 232. The base of a Skull, from an elderly woman who appeared to have been long in the habit of wearing a plug to close an opening in the palate. The opening, gradually enlarging, attained such a size that nothing remains of the palatine por- tions of the superior maxillary and palate bones, and the alveolar border of the jaw is reduced to a very thin plate, without any trace of the sockets of the teeth. The antrum is on both sides obliterated by the apposition of its walls, its inner wall having probably been pushed outwards as the plug was enlarged to fit the enlarging aperture in the palate. e 252 FIRST SERIES. Nearly the whole of the vomer also has been destroyed, and the superior ethmoidal cells are laid open. The plug is preserved: it is composed of a large circular cork, with tape wound round it, and measures an inch and three quarters in diameter and an inch in depth. The history of the patient is unknown. She was brought from a workhouse to the dissectLg rooms', with the plug tightly and smoothly fitted m the roof of the mouth. 233. Section of a Femur affected with Mollities ossium The walls of the bone are thin, soft, and flexible, and their lamella, are partially separated. The place of its medullary and can- cellous tissue is occupied by soft, jelly-like, transparent fat, of various shades of yellow and pink: some of it was deep crimson. A similar kind of fat appeared to be diffused through the proper texture of the walls. Scarcely any of the osseous part of the medullary texture remains, except a thin layer beneath the articular surface of the bone. The perios- teum and articular cartilage are healthy. 234.

Another section of the same parts. A portion of the tumour has been so removed as to show the surface of the wall of the ilium on which it rested, and parts of which are absorbed in minute round holes and irregular spaces through which the growth without appears to dip in, and be connected with that within the ilium. 237. Another section of the same Ilium macerated, to show the same partial absorption of its walls, and the other changes which it has undergone by the growth of the tumour. 238. Portion of the Periosteum of the same Ilium, with fragments of the Medullary Tumour held together by fibrous bands and cords, and blood-vessels, somewhat like those of an erectile tissue. These pass from the inner surface of the periosteum, intersecting the substance of the tumour. 239. A Medullary Tumour, removed from the arm of the patient from whom the four preceding specimens were taken. It is of elongated oval form, soft and spongy in its texture, and has a few cells scattered through it. Its proper colour is pale, and nearly white: but it is blotched with many spots of vascularity and effused blood. It is invested by a thin fibro- cellular capsule, with which a part of the brachial artery and median nerve are closely connected. 240. Portion of the Heart of the same patient, with a small Medul- lary Tumour imbedded in its muscular substance near its apex. 241. The Lower part of the Aorta and the iliac arteries of the same patient. The left common iliac artery was tied three days be- fore death. Its internal and middle coats are cut through by the ligature : above the line of section is a portion of a large clot which had formed above the ligature. The patient was a man forty-two years old. The tumour in the arm had existed for ten years, and had not grown for three years. The tumour of the ilium had been growing rather quickly for about a year. It presented a distinct, deep, heavy pulsation, a bruit, and many other signs like those of an aneurism :54 FIRST SERIES. the common iliac artery was therefore tied. The patient died on the third day after the operation with suppuration in the track of the wound. The case is recorded by Mr. Stanley in the Medico-Cliirurgical Transactions, Vol. xxviii., p. 317; London, 1845. 242. Sections of a Tibia, of which a portion of the cancellous tissue near its lower end has suffered Necrosis and been separated. The sequestrum lay loose in a cavity lined by thin organized membrane. In one of the sections the half of the seques- trum is retained in its place ; in the other, it has been removed to expose the interior of the cavity. The walls of the bone around the cavity are slightly enlarged, and there are two ulcerated apertures extending through them : but their texture, as well as that of the periosteum, is nearly healthy. There is also a wide ulcerated aperture through the articular surface of the bone, and nearly the whole of its cartilage is removed. From a boy seven years old, in whom the disease, arising from no evident cause, had existed for some years. Numerous abscesses about the ankle made amputation necessary. Presented by Joseph Hodgson, Esq. 243. An Os Calcis, in which there was Necrosis of a portion of the cancellous tissue. After the separation of the sequestrum, abscesses formed in and around the bone, and there was abundant deposit of new bone upon its surface. Ulceration also extended through the superior articular surface of the os calcis; and anchylosis between it and the astragalus followed. From a man twenty-two years old. The disease commenced shortly after a rusty nail had been driven into the heel, piercing the bone. The patient re- covered after the amputation of the foot. 244. The anterior surface of a Patella, which exfoliated after an in- jury to the front of the knee. 245. Sections of a small Tumour from the Tibia.

The patient, a young man, recovered after the amputation of the foot. 247. Sections of the front of a Lower Jaw, which was removed with a Tumour, like Epulis, of the gum. The tumour, of a rounded oval form and a firm obscurely fibrous texture, rose to the height of half an inch from the margin of the jaw and over- lapped both its surfaces. But one of the sections shows that the part of the jaw on which the tumour rested is in its own texture sound: its surface was smooth and the periosteum healthy. From a young woman in whom the disease had made slow progress. 248. Section of a Frontal Bone, with numerous lens-shaped Tumours, of various sizes from a line to two inches in diameter, thickly scattered through its substance. They grow from both surfaces, and from the substance of both tables ; there were also several in other parts of the skull, and some on the dura mater. The tumours consist of a soft medullary matter; and in many of them delicate osseous fibres, standing vertically on the surface of the skull, are imbedded. In the situation of the largest tumour, parts of which grow from corresponding portions of both tables of the skull, a similar medullary substance is diffused through the diploe. 249. Another Section of the same Frontal Bone macerated, and showing more plainly the osseous portion of one of the tumours, and the altered state of the diploe where the medullary matter was deposited. 250. Section of a Humerus, around the middle of the shaft of which a firm obscurely fibrous medullary tumour has formed. Within the tumour, the texture of the humerus, apparently infiltrated with medullary matter, is soft and brittle, and was broken during life by a slight force. The disease extends for a short distance into the medullary canal above and below the fracture; and a small round mass of cancer, like that in- vesting the shaft, is imbedded on the inner surface of the wall. From an old lady who had suffered for some months from pains like those of rheumatism in the arm. She died shortly after the fracture of the humerus. Presented by Herbert Evans, Esq.0(i FIRST SERIES. 251. Part of a Lower Jaw, including one of its rami and its symphysis, imbedded in a large, firm, dense, pale and obscurely fihrous Tumour, near which also are one or two smaller tumours of the same kind resting on its surface, but not connected with the jaw. The tumour projects with an ulcerated surface into the side and floor of the mouth, displacing the tongue and soft palate, and rising as high as the condyle of the jaw. The specimen was taken after death from the patient from whom the tumour " in No. 150 was removed. She survived the operation about two years. Presented by George Harrison, Esq. 252. An Os Naviculare from an old Horse, exhibiting absorption of its articular cartilage and ulceration of the subjacent bone. 253.

Section of the opposite hind Leg of the same Dog, with exactly similar growths. The soft parts have been removed by maceration. The osseous parts of the growths thus appear formed principally of hollow crooked branching tubes, like masses of coral round the joints. The bases of the growths are fixed on the surfaces of the articular ends of the bones; and bone, of the same general character, but much less abundant, is deposited on the patella, the shafts of the femur and tibia, and all the bones of the foot.

Portion of a Skull-Cap increased in thickness, and all, except the surfaces of the tables, converted into a uniform, spongy, or porous tissue, apparently by a slighter degree of the same disease as is shown in No. 36 in the preceding Series. There is the cicatrix of an ulcer on the middle of the frontal bone. 34. Parts of a Tibia, Clavicle, Humerus, and Skull, from a man who died with syphilis. The shaft of the tibia is enlarged by the expansion of its walls and by external formation of new bone. In one part, the walls and the new bone covering them are penetrated by small irregular ulcers. The same disease has affected the middle of the clavicle ; and in it the ulceration has extended so far that a slight force broke the remaining portion of its shaft. In the humerus the lower half of the shaft is thickly covered by light and porous new bone, through which many ulcers of various size have pene- trated ; some of these extend deep into the original wall of the humerus, portions of which also appear to have suffered necrosis. In the skull the outer tables of the frontal and right parietal bone present an uneven tuberculated surface, seamed and starred, like the surface of confluent small blisters ; through this, numerous distinct and coalescing ulcers penetrate, and reaching the diploe spread therein in wider spaces, and in a few instances pass also through the inner table. The outer table of the left parietal bone is tubercu- lated but not ulcerated. There is a similar but less extensive disease on the inner table of the right parietal and occipital bones. ,.35. The Skull, Femur, and Bones of the right upper extremity of a man who died with syphilis. They present, in a less advanced form, similar appearances to those last described. The tuberculated character which the outer table of the skull assumes, previous to its ulceration, is shown on the upper part of the frontal bone; and the stages in the progress of the little ulcers which penetrate and spread through the new bone, maybe traced on the clavicles in which the process has just begun, and on the radius and humerus on which it is more advanced ; while on the femur, whose shaft like theirs is63 DISEASES OF BONE. much enlarged by the formation of new bone, there are many small round and oval apertures with smooth borders, indi- cating that similar ulcers have been healed. Presented by William Beaumont, Esq. 36. Sections of a Tibia and a Fibula. The shaft of the tibia is generally enlarged and hardened. Upon its external surface there are irregular deposits of bone, sharp-edged and over- hanging. Internally it presents a nearly uniform, closely can- cellated texture, in which there is hardly a distinction between the walls and the medullary cavity. Just above the ankle- joint, in the situation of the medullary canal, there is anirregular elongated cavity communicating externally by a small round aperture, or cloaca, through the walls. It is probable there- fore that there was necrosis of a portion of cancellous tissue at this part. The fibula is thinly covered by new bone. 37. A Skull-Cap, in which there is an irregular increase in the thickness of the diploe, producing large convex elevations of the outer surface about the prominences marking the original centres of ossification of the parietal bones. The diploe is consolidated as well as thickened: the outer table is smooth and healthy; the inner table is deeply impressed by the vascular grooves. The cavity of the skull appears to have been small, especially in the parts beneath the external eleva- tions. 38. Two Tibiae and two Femora, exhibiting a considerable in- crease in the thickness and density of their walls. The sec- tion of one of the femora shows that the thickest part of the wall is composed of nearly uniform compact bone. 39. A Skull-Cap, exhibiting numerous small irregular portions of bone projecting from the internal surface of the frontal bone. The diploe in the situation of these bony projections is con- siderably thickened, and indurated: the inner table, also, in correspondence with the increase of the diploe, is carried inwards, narrowing at this part the capacity of the skull.FIRST SERIES: SUB-SERIES A. 40. A Tibia exhibiting an irregular thickening of its walls in the middle and anterior part of its shaft. An ulcer in the soft parts covering the thickened bone had existed many years, and on this account the limb was amputated. Two distinct changes may be here recognized: namely, thickening by separation of the layers of the wall, and deposit of new bone on its exterior. 41. A Skull exhibiting through its whole extent an increased thickness and density of both the outer and inner tables. The increase affects also the bones of the face, but in a some- what less degree.

On its anterior surface there are circumscribed deposits of new bone, such as are found under ulcers of the integuments. The curvature of the tibia is not like that which takes place in rickets, but like that in A. 46, which is due to the tibia becoming elongated at the same'time that it enlarges, and to the separation of its ends from each other as it elongates being prevented by its con- nexion with the fibula. a. 43.

The head of the fibula is united by bone to that of the tibia. A 45. A Skull-Cap exhibiting a great increase of thickness of the diploe, and of portions of the inner table, at its anterior part. The inner surface of this part has an irregular rocky appear- ance from the deposit of hard new bone. The outer surface is smooth and healthy. A 46 Sections of the Tibia of a Lad about eighteen years of age. The left tibia is nearly an inch longer than the right; in its increase of length it has become curved, its ends, confined byDISEASES OE BONE. 65 their attachments to the tibia, having been hindered from separating more widely. The left tibia is increased in thick- ness as well as in length, chiefly by the expansion of its walls. The front wall is, in parts, an inch thick and com- posed of nearly uniform cancellous tissue : it is also more lengthened than the other walls. 47. Lower halves of a Tibia and Fibula firmly united for two inches above the ankle-joint, by the growth of a large irregular mass of bone from their posterior and outer surfaces. There is a deep groove for the passage of the tendons of the peronaei muscles behind this growth. A large ulcer had for many years existed in the outer and back part of the leg immediately above the ankle-joint. 48. Lower half of a Tibia, of which the walls are thickened and increased in density. The chief increase is in the anterior aspect of the shaft, where, also, the surface of the new bone on it is peculiarly rough, coral-like, and spongy ; characters indicative of new bone formed in circumstances of constant irritation. The irritation arose in this case from an ulcer of the integuments which had existed for a long time previous to the amputation of the limb. 49. Skull of a Man, who, fifteen years before death, received a violent blow on the head, and from whom, two years before death, the right eye was extirpated. All the upper part of the skull is increased in thickness and density. Its inner surface, especially on the right side, is marked by an unusual number of grooves and small apertures for blood vessels. The sutures are not obliterated. The right malar bone is somewhat depressed towards the orbit, and the ex- ternal and inferior angle of the right orbit is not so deep as that of the left. The right angle of the jaw is superficially ulcerated by the growth of a large cancerous tumour of the adjacent lymphatic glands. The eye which was extirpated is preserved in Scries IX., No. 17, and a por- tion of the thickened dura mater which covered the right hemisphere of the brain, in Scries VI., No. 6'3. F36 FIRST SERIES: SUT» SERIES A. a. 50. Portion of a Tibia, on the external surface of which, above the malleolus, new bone has been formed on a circumscribed oval space. A part of the new bone has been destroyed by ulceration, which probably extended into it from an ulcer of the integuments. A 51 A Tibia and Fibula. Ulceration, extending probably from a malignant disease of the integuments, has penetrated the front wall of the tibia, destroyed its medullary tissue, and made small apertures in its posterior wall. A deposit ot bone has taken place upon the fibula, and there is ossifica- tion of the interosseous ligament. A 52. Portion of a Tibia exhibiting superficial ulceration, with node-like thickening of the bone around the ulcerated surface : probably the effects of syphilis. A 53. Portian of a Tibia exhibiting superficial and extensive uleera- tion of its upper half, with new bone about the borders of the ulceration. A fleshy tumour, originating in the sott parts, completely surrounded this part of the bone. A 54.

The other Section is No. 51, ... the preceding Scries.67 DISEASES OF BONE. . 58. A Skull-Cap, exhibiting some of the effects of syphilis. In some situations there has been a complete destruction of the bone through both tables of the skull; at the borders of the apertures thus made, the disease seems to have stopped, and the parts appear to have cicatrised, for their edges are thin, smooth, and hard. In other situations, ulceration appears to have been in progress, the bone in these parts exhibiting a rough surface, a porous texture, and many small deeply penetrating holes. The spaces left by the removal of the bone are filled by membrane in which there are several small deposits of new bone: and the outer surfaces of all the portions of the skull which remain between the ulcers, are tuberculated, seamed, and starred, as in a. 34. 59. A Skull-Cap, large portions of which have been de- stroyed by syphilitic ulceration like that in the preceding specimen. The two preceding specimens were taken from patients who died in the venereal wards of the hospital while Mr. Pott was surgeon. 60. Portions of a Skull-Cap, of which the outer table is tubercu- lated and irregularly ulcerated. The diploe and inner table are thickened and consolidated, and the inner table appears to have been very vascular. These changes had their origin in the effects of external violence. 61. A Skull-Cap, exhibiting extensive ulceration of the outer table, and ulceration to a less extent of the inner table. The parts remaining between the ulcers have a tuberculated surface. It i3 presumed these changes were consequent on the formation of matter within the diploe. 62. A Skull-Cap, with numerous minute round holes in both the outer and inner tables. Generally, the absorption of the outer corresponds with that of the inner table. 63. A Skull-Cap, exhibiting extensive syphilitic ulceration of its outer table. The ulcers are distinct, large, and round. f 268 FIRST SERIES : SUB-SERIES A. Some of them, especially one on the frontal bone, show that they commenced in an annular form, an ulcerated groove forming round a portion of diseased bone, which portion was subsequently removed by the widening of the groove. The inner table is very vascular and less extensively ulcerated. Parts of the outer table are tuberculated. a 64 A Skull-Cap, in which there are numerous oval, rough-edged ' apertures. Some extend through both tables ; some are in the outer, others in the inner table alone. Inere has also been extensive destruction by ulceration of the frontal bone. The portions of skull between the apertures are healthy. , , .. It is most probable tbat these changes we consequent on the growth ot medullary tumours. a. 65. A Skull-Cap, exhibiting extensive superficial ulceration of the outer table. a 66. Portion of a Skull, in which nearly the whole surface of the outer table is tuberculated and ulcerated. In the greater part of its extent the disease resembles that described in A. 34, 35, and other preceding specimens; but over the occipital bone the ulceration presents the more diffuse rough, jagged form which belongs to that occurring in acute inflammation and suppuration on the surface of a bone. a 67. A Skull-Cap, in which a large portion of the outer table of the frontal bone is rough, grey, porous, and tu- berculated, presenting the same change as has preceded the ulceration in many of the specimens just described. In this case ulceration has commenced in only two or three points about the middle of the diseased surface. The corresponding portion of the inner table is porous, as if it had been more than naturally vascular, but is not otherwise diseased. A. 68. A Skull-Cap, exhibiting ulceration of a small circumscribedDISEASES OF BONE. 69 portion of the outer table of the frontal bone, with thickening of the inner table in the corresponding situation. 69. A Skull-Cap, with general thickening and induration of the frontal bone. Its outer table, like that of a. 67, is slightly tuberculated, and in one situation ulcerated; and all the ad- jacent parts appear to have been unnaturally vascular. 70. A Skull-Cap, exhibiting several distinct roundish ulcers, some of which have penetrated both its tables. They commenced in the outer table and present traces of the same annular primary form as those in a. 63. 71. A Skull-Cap, with superficial ulceration of both its tables. 72. A Skull-Cap, in which a small circumscribed ulcer of the outer table of the frontal bone has healed. There are general thickening and induration of the tables and obliteration of the diploe. 73. Portion of the Base of a Skull, exhibiting syphilitic ulceration of the palate, and the front of the alveolar process. There is also ulceration of the left malar bone, which presents the same characters as the ulceration in A. 34, and others of the preceding specimens. 74. A Skull-Cap, in which are many large ulcerated holes, oc- casioned by tumours originating in the dura mater. As in a. 64, the edges of the holes are abrupt, rough, and sharp, and the loss of substance in the diploe is a little greater than in either of the tables. Ulceration has also in one situation commenced on the exterior of the frontal bone. The grooves for the meningeal arteries, which were doubtless enlarged for the supply of blood to the tumours, are very deep, though the skull is not thickened nor otherwise diseased, except in the parts involved by the tumours. 75. The Base of a Skull, from a young subject, exhibiting ex-FIRST SERIES: SUD-SER1ES A. tensive ulceration through a part of the parietal and tem- poral bones : the effect of strumous disease. 76. Portion of a Tibia exhibiting superficial ulceration, with a porous appearance of the surrounding bone: the result of disease like that shown in a. 50. 77. Portions of a Tibia and Fibula. A large portion of the shaft of each bone has been destroyed by ulceration, in consequence probably of some malignant disease; as in a. 74, the margins of the ulcer are abrupt, sharp, and excavated. 78. A Tibia and Fibula, A large portion of the shaft of the tibia, in its entire thickness, has been removed by malignant ulceration like that in the last-described specimen. The inferior portion of the tibia is united to the fibula by bone. The fibula is greatly thickened ; and a fracture in the middle of its shaft has firmly united. . 79. Portion of the Skull described in Nos. 248, 249, in the pre- ceding Series, upon and within which medullary tumours grew. l. 80.

A Skull-Cap, exhibiting ulceration of its outer and inner tables in numerous minute holes, of which many are distinct in close set groups, but more have coalesced. There were fungous excrescences filling these minute excavations in the71 DISEASES OF BONE. bones, some of which were attached to the pericranium, and others to the dura mater; but it is uncertain whether they originated in the diploe or in the membranes investing the skull. 84. Portion of a Skull, with syphilitic ulceration of the frontal bone extending into the frontal sinuses and through the inner table of the skull. 85. Portion of a Skull-Cap, in which there has been extensive absorption. In the situation of the absorption of the inner table there were scrofulous tumours upon the dura mater. There were also sores in the scalp at the part where the outer table has been absorbed. 86. Portion of a Tibia with new bone formed round the middle of its shaft, and ulceration extending through part of the new bone to its surface : the effects of syphilis. 87. A Skull with the Lower Jaw. Many distinct portions of the cranium have been removed by ulceration like that conse- quent on the growth of tumours. In some situations, the ab- sorption is confined to the diploe and outer table of the skull; in others, it extends through both tables. There has been disease in one of the articulations of the jaw, producing absorption of the articular cartilage, with a deposit of bone in the circumference, of the glenoid cavity. The corresponding condyle is in part removed by absorption; its surface is rough, except at one point, where it is highly polished, and has an ivory-like texture. In the ramus of the jaw on the same side, disease, apparently commencing in the diploe, has produced absorption of the bone at many separate and minute points. 88. A Skull-Cap, in which there is consolidation of the diploe, with increased hardness of the tables, and ulceration of the frontal and left parietal bones, consequent, probably, on the formation of matter within the diploe.FIRST SERIES: SUB-SERIES A. 89. A Skull exhibiting the effects of syphilis. The palate septum nasi, and the lateral boundaries of the nose, are destroyed by ulceration extending as high as the middle tur- binated bone. The outer table of nearly all the upper part of the skull is tuberculated and very extensively ulcerated, and in several places the ulceration has penetrated the inner table. 90 The Skull-Cap of a young woman, in which, in the course of syphilis, the greater part of the outer table of the frontal portion of the frontal bone suffered necrosis, and was nearly separated from the adjacent bone. A deep groove has formed round the dead portion, and a large part of its under surface is separated. The inner table has not perished, but beneath the centre of the necrosed portion there are several irregular ulcerated openings in it. There are two small superficial ulcerations of the external table near the sa- gittal suture, on corresponding parts of the two parietal bones. A 91. Sections of a Tibia, in which the osseous part of nearly all the cancellous tissue being absorbed, there is a wide cavity extending completely through the interior of the bone The walls of the bone are a little thicker than natural: and their texture is light and porous; the cavity probably contained purulent matter. A. 92. Sections of a Femur in whieh there is an enlargement of the medullary cavity, with thinning of the walls, and general lightness and dryness of texture. A 93. A Femur, exhibiting a slight enlargement of the lower part of its shaft. The exterior of the bone at this part is smooth and healthy, but in the corresponding situation m the interior there is a cavity from which the osseous part of the medullary tissue has been removed. The rest of the cancellous tissue is very delicate and light. A. 94. Part of a Tibia in which there has been Necrosis of a portionDISEASES OF BONE. 73 of the shaft, and an abundant formation of new bone on all the adjacent part. The dead bone is completely separated, and lies loose in the cavity surrounded by the new bone, but is too large to be removed through any of the aper- tures, or cloacae, in the new bone. 95. Sections of a Femur in which there has been Necrosis of nearly the whole length and thickness of the walls of the shaft. The dead bone is separated, and is completely en- closed in a case of new bone formed around it. There are several round and oval apertures leading through the new bone into the narrow space by which it is separated from the surface of the sequestrum. 96. Portion of a Femur, in which there has been Necrosis of the posterior wall of the lower part of the shaft. The dead bone was separated, but was held by a bridge of new bone formed across it. In the adjacent part of the shaft the walls are thickened, the cancellous tissue is nearly con- solidated, and there is irregular ulceration above and upon the condyles. 97. A Tibia, in which there has been Necrosis of a portion of the wall and cancellous tissue of the upper half of the shaft. The new bone formed around the sequestrum is thick, hard, and very heavy, and there are many apertures leading through it into the cavity in which the sequestrum lies. 93. A Tibia and Fibula. There has been Necrosis of portions of the whole length of the walls of the tibia. The remaining walls with the new bone formed on them are thickened, enlarged, and very heavy. There is extensive ossification of the inter- osseous ligament. 99. Portion of a Femur in which there has been Necrosis of a part of the shaft. The sequestrum has been removed: the walls around the cavity in which it lay are thick, hard,FIRST SERIES: SUB-SERIES A. and heavy, though porous: and the adjacent cancellous tissue is nearly consolidated. 100. A Tibia, in which there has been Necrosis of a portion of the shaft and of the cancellous tissue of its lower end. New bone has been formed abundantly about the seat of the necrosis. The lower articular surface of the tibia is nearly all destroyed by ulceration. 101. A Femur, in which it is probable that there has been Necrosis of a portion of the inner wall and cancellous tissue of the lower part of the shaft. There is a large cavity in this part and by its side many smaller ones, around which the wall of the bone is thickened, porous, covered by new bone, and penetrated by an oval aperture like a cloaca. 102. Sections of a Tibia in which there has been Necrosis of a portion of the cancellous texture near its head. A portion of the dead bone was probably removed through the smooth oval aperture in the adjacent thickened wall: the rest of it is not completely separated, but a deep groove bounds it. A 103. Section of a Tibia, exhibiting superficial Necrosis of its walls. A groove has formed around the dead bone, and there is a considerable deposit of new bone upon the sur- rounding living walls. The .other half of this bone is in the preceding Series, No. 188. A 104. A Skull-Cap, in which there has been Necrosis of a large portion of both tables of the frontal and right parietal bones. A groove, beginning in the outer table and gradually deepening, has been formed around the dead bone. Two applications of the trephine were made in the dead bone, with the expectation of finding matter beneath it. The necrosis was produced by a burn. . ,05 A Skull-Cap, exhibiting extensive Necrosis, which, ap- patently, succeeded syphilitic ulceration of the outer tableDISEASES OP BONE. 75 110. A Skull-Cap, in which there has been Necrosis of a portion of the frontal bone. A groove has formed around the dead bone, and extends for some distance beneath its edges. There are cicatrices of old ulcers on the parietal bones : and the skull is heavy. 10G. A Skull-Cap, exhibiting extensive Necrosis and Ulceration of the whole thickness of the parietal bones. A groove has been formed around the dead bone ; the increased vas- cularity of the adjoining margin of the living bone is shown by the numerous minute apertures in it. As is usual, no new bone is formed on the outer table around the seques- trum ; but a thin layer of new bone is formed on that portion of the inner table to the margin of which the groove of separation, commencing in the outer table and gradually deepening, has penetrated. 107. A Skull, with syphilitic Necrosis and Ulceration of a portion of the left parietal bone. The dead bone has been in part removed. The frontal bone is tuberculated as in syphilitic disease. 108. A Skull-Cap, exhibiting Necrosis of a portion of the outer table of the frontal bone, with thickening of the inner table to a corresponding extent. The dead bone is black: pre- vious to its necrosis it appears to have been superficially ulcerated. There is a very shallow groove of separation around it. There is ulceration of the outer table of the frontal bone above the right orbit. 109. A Skull-Cap, in which there are several distinct syphilitic ulcers. The ulcers are nearly circular, and affect corre- sponding parts of both tables. Some of them present an annular form, a groove of ulceration extending round a central portion of diseased bone which is gradually removed as the groove widens towards the centre.FIRST SERIES: SUB-SERIES A. of the outer table of the frontal bone. A groove formed round the dead portion shows the progress of this part of the process for the separation of sequestra. There is also ulceration with irregular superficial necrosis of a portion of the left parietal bone. 111. A Skull-Cap, exhibiting extensive Necrosis of the outer table, and, to a small extent, of the inner table, of the frontal bone. The necrosis, as in the similar specimens, A. 105 and 107, occurred in the course of syphilitic ulcera- tion. 112. A Skull, in which, in the course of syphilitic disease there occurred necrosis of several large portions of the frontal and parietal bones. Many of the sequestra were completely separated, and the surface of the diploe and inner table exposed by their removal appears to have healed smoothly but many other portions in which the necrosxs; extends through both tables of the skull, are only partially detached The portions of the skull, which remain between those that have suffered necrosis, appear quite healthy : they were not even increased in vascularity. , 113 The lower end of a Tibia, including nearly the whole of its Idcular surface, which separated by exfoliation m a case of compound fracture. Presented by R. S. Eyles, Esq. A 114 The corresponding ends of a Femur and a Tibia. In a h avy fall, the femur was fractured about threefinches above le Id les. The fragments are firmly united; but he upper one lies in front of the lower, overlapping it. In con- sequence of the same injury, necrosis ensued m a smal portion of the tibia, including part of its articular surface. The sequestrum, when the limb was amputated many years after the injury, was found loose, where it is now fixed, in a large cav ty in the head of the tibia, which cavity opensDISEASES OF BONE. 77 through the anterior wall by the side of the tubercle of the tibia, and more widely into the knee-joint. The articular surfaces of both femur and tibia are ulcerated; and in the inner condyle of the femur, there is a deep cavity like that of an abscess, corresponding with the cavity in which the sequestrum lies in the head of the tibia. Presented by Thomas Sympson, Esq. 115. Portion of a Spine, exhibiting Necrosis with abscess in the cancellous texture of the body of one of the vertebrae. There is a considerable deposit of new bone upon the vertebra around the necrosed bone. Between two of the bodies, the fibro-cartilage has been removed, and they are united by bone. 116. Two Femora from the same person. There has been necrosis in the lower part of the shaft of one of these bones. The dead bone has been completely separated, and new bone is formed around the cavity in which it lay. The femur which was thus diseased is shortened to the extent of about four inches; and there is a peculiar flattening of the con- dyles, the consequence, probably, of the knee-joint having been immoveably fixed in the position of extension. 117.

From a patient -who had a suppurating node upon the cranium in the situation and to the extent of the surface of bone which has perished. 118. Sections of a Femur, in which a portion of the whole cir- cumference of the inner layers of its wall, six inches long, has perished, and has been separated from the surrounding bone. New bone has been abundantly formed in and upon the outer layers of the wall, which separated from the se- questrum. There is not in this new bone any aperture, or cloaca, leading into the narrow space around the sequestrum. The tissue of the new bone is compact and heavy, and its surface hard and nearly smooth. It will be observed, also, that the medullary tissue is entire within the perished partFIRST SERIES: SI'B-SERIES A. of the bone, although in this situation its tissue is nearly consolidated. 119. Sections of a Tibia, which is presumed to have belonged to the same person as the femur last described, but from the opposite limb. It is diseased in exactly the same manner. A sequestrum of a large portion of the inner layers of its wall is completely enclosed within the thick and hard layer of new bone formed on and united with the remaining por- tions of the wall. The exterior of this new bone is even smoother than that last described, and there is no aperture leading through it to the cavity containing the sequestrum. The medullary tissue is entire; but partially consolidated. 120. Sections of a Femur, exhibiting an increased thickness and density of the walls of the upper half of its shaft. 121. Part of the Femur of a boy thirteen years old. Almost all the lower half of the shaft has perished in its whole thick- ness, and was in process of separation. Deep grooves have been formed between it and the adjacent living bone, on all parts of which new bone has been deposited. The disease commenced after a blow on the knee, five weeks before the amputation of the limb. . 122. Part of a Tibia, two portions of which, each including both compact and cancellous tissue, have perished and were in process of separation by grooves being formed around them. Previous to the necrosis these portions had been irregularly ulcerated on their surfaces and consolidated in their internal structure by thickening and union of their lamellae. All the parts of the bone intervening between the necrosed portions are thickened and indurated. The patient was a man about fifty years old. The disease had made slow progress for many years before the removal of the limb. v 123. The Upper part of a Skull, exhibiting the effects of syphilitic ulceration and necrosis.. A large portion of the frontal bone exfoliated long before the patient's death ; and theDISEASES OF BONE. 7!) borders of the aperture, as well as the surrounding surface of the bone, are smoothly healed. A necrosed portion of the occipital bone was removed about a month before the patient's death : the aperture remains with ulcerated margins. There are also irregular superficial ulcerations on the external table of both the parietal bones; and on many other parts of the skull are appearances of the bones having been unnaturally vascular. 124. Section of a Skull, exhibiting a small ivory-like Osseous Tumour with a narrow base, growing from the outer table of the frontal bone, just above the external angular process. 125. Section of a Clavicle, the scapular end of which is so en- larged after fracture that it has the appearance of a tumour. 126. The upper part of a Femur, with a bony process of a pyramidal form and about three inches in length, continued from the trochanter minor. To the extremity of this bony process the tendon of the psoas and iliacus muscles is attached. 127.

A Humerus, with a broad based and sharp-edged growth of bone from the outer side of its shaft, close by the attach- ment of the deltoid muscle. 129. Sections of a Femur, and of a growth of bone from the outer side of its shaft. The growth has a broad base of attachment, and a smooth convex surface : one of its margins rises gently from the shaft, the other is sharp and over- hanging. The section shows that the growth is almost entirely formed of compact tissue, and is wholly external to the wall of the femur.i;o FIRST SERIES: SUB SERIES A. a. 130. Two thin irregular plates of Bone, which were found in the muscles close to the Femur last described. a. 131. A Humerus, with a nodulated Osseous Tumour growing from the front and upper part of its shaft. The tumour is much narrower at the point of its connexion with the shaft than elsewhere. a. 132. A Femur, from the whole circumference of which a Tumour of very large size has arisen. It extends from the condyles to near the upper end of the bone. The small portions of the femur remaining above and below the tumour are sound. The tumour consists of bone, of a light texture and grey colour, in thin lamellae and very fine fibres, groups or masses of which being arranged in nearly parallel lines give the surface of the tumour a fibrous aspect, like pumice-stone. The tumour, probably, is of the Osteoid species, and was covered by some softer substance. 133. Sections of a Femur and an Os Innominatum, from which an Osseous Tumour of large size has arisen. The tumour has arisen principally from the Femur. It consists through- out of a very hard osseous substance with a compact surface and cancellous interior. It is divisible into lobes, and its surface is nodulated. There has been a fracture of the shaft of the femur, a little below the trochanter minor, which has firmly united. This fracture occurred before the growth of the tumour commenced. A much larger part of this tumour consisted principally of cartilaginous substance: a portion of it is preserved in the preceding series, No. 118.

They are considerably curved, but their texture is as hard and heavy as in health. The femur is curved in an arch with its convexity directed forwards; the middle of its shaft is flattened at the sides, and the linea aspera in the same part is very prominent, its edge forming a straight line represent- ing the chord of the arc formed by the most curved part of the shaft. The tibia and fibula are curved inwards, and in the middle of their shafts present an antero-posterior flattening greater than the lateral flattening of the shaft of the femur. a. 140. Portion of the Femur of an adult very strongly curved in its upper third. The curved part of the shaft is so flattened that its anterior surface forms a narrow prominent ridge.

The lower dorsal vertebrae, inclining to the right, compensate for the preceding changes by having their right transverse processes directed forwards. The upper dorsal and the cervical vertebrae tend to the right, and their transverse processes incline to the same directions as those of the lumbar, viz. the left forwards, and the right backwards. From the manner in which the weight of the trunk has been transmitted to the pelvis, the sacrum has become nearly horizontal. The cavity of the pelvis is capacious: the ilia are everted; and the angle of the symphysis pubis is rather more acute than is natural. The femora are short, and strongly curved, with their con- vexities directed forwards ; and their lower articular ends appear very broad and flat. The tibiae and fibulae are also curved with their convexities directed forwards and inwards. a. 148. The Skeleton of an adult woman, showing, in a remarkable degree, the deformities consequent on rickets. The dorsal region of the spine is strongly curved to the right side, and the lumbar region to the left; but the curve to the right predominates, so that the right ribs project an inch beyond the great trochanter, the chest thus overhanging the extrem- ities. Together with the lateral curve of the spine, there is malposition of the bodies of the several vertebrae; they are all turned round, so that their front surfaces look out- wards in the direction of the lateral curve in which they are included. The right side of the chest is encroached upon by the dorsal curvature of the spine. The angles of the right ribs are very acute, their bodies strongly curved : the right inter- costal spaces are very narrow. The angles of the left ribs are very obtuse, the ribs long and comparatively little curved, but directed downwards; so that the cartilages of the false ribs are nearly on a level with the crest of the left ilium, g 2FIRST SERIES: SUB-SERIES A. and tlu ir bodies nearly in contact with the lower dorsal vertebra at the beginning of the second, or left, curvature of the spine. The general position of the chest is thus very oblique ; what should be its vertical ax. ,s directed from above downwards, from before backwards, and from right to left. _ . The pelvis is light and all its bones are thin. It is obliquely placed; the crest of the left ilium being higher than that of the right, and its ala further back and more concave. The left side of the sacrum being also narrower than the right, and the symphysis pubis in the middle line, the left side of the pelvis and of its upper aperture are less capacious than the right. The rami of the isch.a curve outwards ; and the lower aperture of the pdv* though misshapen, does not appear unnaturally small. The scapula* and clavicles are slender and well-formed. The humeri are short and proportionally thick ; the upper halves of their shafts present each a slight double curvature. The radii and ulnae are also short and slightly curved ; in comparison with the humeri they are slender. The bones of the wrists and hands are well formed. The femora are both curved and very short: they are of equal length ; but the left is slender, while the right is of full Scknesf In adaptation to the oblique pos^ofthe .elvis (the right acetabulum being nearly an inch lower th n tl le t and half an inch more forward), the right "much more strongly curved than the left; and the right is curved outwards, while the left is curved forwards By this adaptation the obliquities in the upper part of the r/eleton are" nearly compensated; so that the knee,om are at the same level; neither of them js advanced befo the other; and, except that the articular surface of the Zu is more oblique than that of the left, they are symme- trical. The tibiae and fibulae are strongly but simdarly " ved forwards and inwards, so that the shafts of the tibiaa nearly touch. The lateral axes of the ankle-joints are d re Jed from without inwards, and from above downwards; and he internal malleoli are far within the tarsi and on a evel with the lower margins of the astragal,. The feetDISEASES OF HONE. 85 are in a corresponding degree splayed out, and their soles are nearly flat. . 149. The Pelvis and Lower Extremities of a middle-aged woman who had suffered from rickets. The bones are all strong, thick, and heavy, and not much curved. They are all short, and the shaft of the left femur is two inches and a half shorter than that of the right. The necks of the femora are horizontal; and their lower articular ends, especially that of the left femur, appear, as they do also in many preceding specimens, broad and flat. 150. The Pelvis and Lower Extremities of a middle-aged woman who had suffered from Rickets. The cavity of the pelvis is contracted, especially on the left side, by the pressing in of the acetabulum ; but the lower aperture of the pelvis is wide, the rami of the ischia being bent outwards and their tuberosities divergent. The necks of the femora are less oblique than usual ; their shafts, as well as those of the tibiae and fibulae, are considerably curved forwards and inwards. The shafts of the tibiae and fibulae are broad and flat. The feet are so much turned inward that their great toes are in contact. 151. Pelvis and Lower Extremities of a young man. All the bones of the right side are atrophied. The several promi- nences on the right os innominatum are less marked, and its iliac fossa is more shallow, than the corresponding parts on the left side. The bones of the right thigh and leg are all shorter, less in circumference, softer, and lighter, than those of the left limb. From the hip-joint to the ankle there is a difference of nearly two inches in the length of the limbs. In compensation for this difference, the left foot is directed almost vertically, so that in the erect position of the body (in imitation of which the bones are arranged) the extremities of the toes of both limbs are at the same level. All the bones of the right foot are slender, small, and soft. The arch of the sole is much increased by the posterior part of the os calcis projecting more than usually downwards.FIRST SERIES: SUB-SERIES A. 8G The shaft of the right femur is enlarged by external deposit of new bone. The muscles of the left limb were small and in a state of fatty degeneration. u 152. Skeleton of an aged woman in which, with curvatures of the spine and an altered form of the chest, there is atrophy o the bones in the right lower limb. The spine has suffered three distinct curves, one to the left in the loins, a second to the right implicating the lower dorsal vertebrae, and the third to the left, extending from the middle of the back to the neck. The ribs are distorted in adaptation to the curvatures of the spine. The cavity of the chest is altered in its form and dimensions: its anteroposterior axis is direct, but its sides are flattened. The pelvis is well formed. The bones of the right lower limb are considerably smaller in all their dimensions than those of the opposite limb ; in partial compensation for their shortness, the posterior part of the os calcis is elongated, and pointed almost straight downwards.

Various Bones from Cows, on all of which there are ex- ternal deposits of light, grey, porous, new bone. The deposits extend, in many cases, over the whole shaft. They are, for the most part, in thin layers, but are in some cases accumulated in thick ridges and knobs. The cows from whom they were taken were fed in meadows near some arsenic-works; and it is presumed that these changes of the hones, which were observed in many of the cows, were the results of the impregnation of the air, or of their food, with arsenic. Presented by Dr. Roupell. 157. A Scapula and part of a Humerus. The arm had been amputated long before death ; and through disuse, the bones are atrophied, but the humerus in a much greater degree than the scapula. The shaft of the humerus has less than half its natural diameter and tapers to a slender cone, at the end of which is some rough new bone. The marks of the attachments of muscles on it are nearly obliterated, and its texture is light and dry. The head of the humerus is flattened and nearly all absorbed, and there is a correspond- ing diminution and change of form in the glenoid cavity. 158. An Os Innominatum and part of a Femur. After amputa- tion through the middle of its shaft, the stump of the femur has been atrophied just as the humerus in the specimen last described: but its head and the acetabulum are unchanged. 159. The Stumps of a Tibia and Fibula after amputation just below the knee. Their medullary cavities are nearly closed by a layer of bone : and they are scarcely reduced in size ; but their texture is very light and greasy. After the amputation the stump healed; but it ulcerated afresh as often as the patient returned to his work: a second amputation was therefore per- formed, and the patient did well.SERIES II.

An Astragalus, from the superior articular surface of which nearly all the articular cartilage has been removed ; a small portion remains closely adherent to the bone, and very thin. The exposed surface of bone is healthy, except at one small portion, which is superficially ulcerated. 3. A Knee-Joint, exhibiting the effects of inflammation. An abundant deposit of lymph has taken place from the internal surface of the synovial membrane, and thin flakes of it adhere to the articular cartilages. 4. An Ankle-Joint, from which nearly-all the articular cartilages have been removed: the small portions which remain are thinned, and their connexion with the bones is loosened. The bones are superficially ulcerated and very vascular. TheSECOND SERIES, posterior surface, by which the astragalus articulated with the os calcis, is similarly diseased. A similar specimen of ulceration of the cartilages and bones of the Ankle-Joint; but herein the exposed bones are covered thickly with lymph. Sections of the Condyles of a Femur. The articular cartilage is thinned, and its connexion with the bone is so loosened that its separation was readily effected. Portions of the cartilage have been detached and turned downwards, to show that parts of the surface which was connected with the bone are unnaturally rough. The exposed surface of bone is very superficially ulcerated and thinly covered by granu- lations. A Knee-joint, in whieh anchylosis has heen effected by the conization of lymph upon and between the oppos.te surfaces of the synovial membrane. A portion of the adherent synovial membrane is reflected from the front of the jomt The oatella is firmly united to the external coudyle of the Lur, and the tibia and fibula have been drawn backwards under the femur, lengthening and giving a very obhcpte direction to the external lateral ligament. The bones are atrophied. 8. A section of the upper part of a Femur, from a man who had for four years suffered will, rheumatic pams m and about the hip A arge portion of the articular cartilage has been com- pLly remold from the midd.e of tire head of the femur. The bone thus exposed is unnaturally hard; its surface ,s oolished, and the morbid hardness extends for about a toe m den h Of the remaining cartilage, some is softened, tlnck, succulent, and nodulated on its surface, while that round the mlin of the exposed bone is very thin; other parts, again, Tre marked with grooves, like wrinkles, rad.atmg to the outer m Jn of the head-, and others are converted mto a fibrous " sue, which hangs in shreds from the surface of the bone.DISEASES OP JOINTS. 91 New bone, in hard irregular nodules, is formed around the margin of the head, and on the neck of the femur. o From the man from whom the specimens of medullary disease of the ilium, in the preceding Scries, Nos. 235 to 238, were taken. i). A Patella, from which nearly all the articular cartilage has been removed by ulceration. The ulceration appears to have extended from the free surface towards the bone ; the margins of the remaining peripheral part of the cartilage are either abrupt and smooth, as if cut with a curved chisel, or, in parts, thinly prolonged over the surface of the bone. All the cartilage that remains has retained its natural firm connexion with the bone. The part of the surface of the patella which is exposed by the ulceration of the cartilage is itself superficially ulcerated and covered by lymph. 10. An Os Calcis and Astragalus, (probably from a gouty person), the articular surfaces of which are uniformly covered by thin deposit of white earthy matter, consisting princi- pally of carbonate of lime. The cartilages themselves are thin. 11. A Patella, the cartilage of which is similarly whitened by the deposit of earthy matter. It appears, also, thickened and nodular. The two preceding specimens were taken from a man between forty and fifty years old. Nearly all the joints in the body were in a similar state : in some, a portion of the white substance was in a fluid state ; and around some there was a similar deposit in the adjacent tissues. Case Book, Vol. i. p. 3, No. 10. 12. An Elbow-Joint, in which, probably by chronic inflammation, the synovial membrane is converted into a light brown sub- stance, of a firm texture, about half or three quarters of an inch in thickness, with white lines running through it in various directions, and with a soft smooth surface. The morbid change terminates at the margins of the articular cartilages. Around the neck of the radius, the thickened synovial membrane forms a fold projecting into the cavity of the joint. The cartilages and bones of the joint appear healthy. The patient was a man sixty years old, and the disease had existed fifteen92 SECOND SERIES. months. H originated in a blow, after which the joint remained verj Btiff, but without vain and with little swelling, for twelve the. Numerous m„ II swellings, like enlarged lymphatic glands, then formed around the joint; they inflamed, and when punctured discharged a glairy fluid. The disease outs.de the joint in reasing, the limb was amputated. On examination the swe.hngs wore found to have no connexion with the interior of the jo.nl. The difficulty ol motion in the joint, especially the hindrance to the rotation of the rad.usap- peared to depend on the projecting folds of the synovial membrane. Case Book, Vol.i. p.4, No. 11. 13. The lower ends of a Radius and Ulna, with the bones of the Carpus and Metacarpus, exhibiting extensive disease in and about the carpus, with necrosis of the lower end of the radius. A considerable portion of the end of the radius, already deeply ulcerated, died and was in process of exfoliation. The carti- lage between the ulna and the carpus is completely destroyed. The ulna and the bones of the carpus have had their cartila- ginous surfaces destroyed by ulceration, and anchylosis has taken place between them, both by adhesion of their surfaces and by thickening and consolidation of the surrounding parts. 14 A Hip-Joint, exhibiting the effects of inflammation. The cartilage has been completely separated both from the head of the femur and from the acetabulum, and some shreds and ulcerated remnants of it are loose in the cavity of the joint. The lio-amentum teres is destroyed. The exposed bones are superficially but smoothly ulcerated. The cavity of the ace- tabulum is enlarged by the ulceration of its walls. The cap- sule is thickened, and its synovial surface appears swollen, soft, and thinly covered by lymph. The patient was a sailor, forty years old. He awoke one night wHh m ense oain in the hip, which lasted some hours, and then in a less degree continued, S in a i he bruised his hip. After this the pain again became^xceedmgly severe; and tfiis continued, without remission, till he died. Case Book, Vol.,. p. 5, No. 12. U Portion of a Femur, of which nearly the whole head has been ' destroyed by ulceration. The uneven rough surface of what remains is covered by shreds of false membrane, by which, probably, it was fixed in the acetabulum. 1G. Portion of a Child's Femur, of which the greater part of the93 DISEASES OF JOINTS. head has been destroyed by ulceration. A portion of the head remains, but it is completely detached and is ulcerated on every surface. 17. A Hip-Joint, from an adult, exhibiting the effects of inflamma- tion. The cartilage covering the head of the femur is com- pletely destroyed by ulceration, and the exposed surface of bone is covered by lymph. The ligamentum teres, also, is destroyed. The head of the femur is dislocated from the acetabulum, and is drawn upwards and backwards upon the dorsum of the ilium, where it rests surrounded by a capsule formed, probably, in part by the diseased old capsule, and in part by the surrounding tissues thickened and consolidated. 18. A Hip-Joint from a child, in which, by a further progress of the inflammation shown in the preceding specimens, both the acetabulum and the whole of the head and neck of the femur have been destroyed by ulceration. 19. A Hip-Joint, in which the articular cartilage covering the acetabulum and head of the bone is completely destroyed. The exposed surfaces of bone are ulcerated, and the aceta- bulum is thereby enlarged. The ligamentum teres is also in great part destroyed; but shreds of it remain, and retain the connexion of the bones. The capsule is thickened, and its inner surface is thinly lined by lymph. 20. A Hip-Joint. In consequence, probably, of rheumatic disease, the acetabulum is greatly enlarged and has assumed an oval form. The head of the femur is enlarged and adapted in its form to the acetabulum. All the articular cartilage is removed, and the surfaces of the bones are smooth, hard, and polished. The capsule of the joint is thickened, and upon its internal surface around the neck of the femur there are several groups of slender pendulous growths. 21. A Hip-Joint, in which the head and neck of the femur have been completely absorbed. The margins of the acetabulum,94 SECOND SERIES. also, have been absorbed, and its cavity has been filled up ; so that in its place there is only an oval, flat, rough surface, with which the corresponding surface of the femur remaining be- tween the trochanters was in contact. The two surfaces were exactly adapted to each other, and covered by a substance like cartilage, so as to form a sort of joint, around which a thick capsule extended. These changes may be regarded as the results of healing after destructive ulceration such as is shown in No. 15,16, and other preceding specimens of dis- ease of the hip-joint. 22. A Shoulder-Joint, in which, in the same manner as in Nos. 8 and 20, there has been degeneration and removal of the articular cartilage, with hardening of the subjacent bone. The capsule is generally thickened, and there are numerous groups of small pendulous processes of fat, and two larger masses of hard nodulated bone, attached to its internal surface. 23 Bones of the Wrist, exhibiting the effects of inflammation in the whole of the carpal and metacarpal joints. The articular surfaces of the several bones are extensively ulcerated—some superficially, others deeply,-and there is a very abundant formation of new bone around the ulcerated parts. 24 A Knee-Joint, exhibiting a peculiar change of structure in the ' synovial membrane. The capsule has been extensively opened and raised for the purpose of exposing the cavity of the joint. The internal surface of the synovial membrane is granulated. The membrane has everywhere become very thick, and espe- cially so at the upper and front part of the joint, where its thickness is not less than two inches, and its substance is so firm as to be almost of a gristly texture. The part of the mem- brane opposed to the articular cartilage of the femur was adherent to it. The whole of the soft parts exterior to the diseased synovial membrane have been carefully removed, so that nothing else is left around the joint. 25 A flattened oval mass of a substance like cartilage, smooth ' ' on one surface, nodulated on the other, which was removed65 DISEASES OF JOINTS. from a Knee-Joint in which it was loose. The central part of the mass appears to be osseous. 26. A similar, but rather smaller specimen, in which, also, specks of osseous substance are formed at the centre. 27. The Base of a Skull, exhibiting disease in the right articulation of the Lower Jaw. Ulceration, commencing in the surface of the glenoid cavity, has extended both widely and deeply in the adjacent bone, and new bone is formed around the ulcerated surface. 28. A Knee-Joint, exhibiting numerous growths on its internal sur- face. The growths are of various sizes, nodulated, grouped, and attached, for the most part, by narrow pedicles. They are most abundant about the margins of the articular surfaces of the bones. Some of them are cartilaginous, others osseous; and there are some which consist of fat covered by a thin membrane, like a reflection of the synovial membrane. The heads of the bones are enlarged, their articular cartilages are removed, and the exposed surfaces are hard and polished. The disease had existed for more than two years with signs of chronic inflam- mation of the synovial membrane. There were four ounces of fluid " like train oil" in the cavity of the joint. The patient recovered completely after the am- putation of the limb. Presented by Thomas Fereday, Esq. 29. Section of a Knee-Joint, the articular surfaces of which are united by false membrane and bone. The patella is united to the inferior part of the outer condyle of the femur, and their respective cancellous tissues have coalesced. The tibia and fibula are drawn backwards under the femur. The external lateral ligament is changed in its direction and elongated. The other section of the joint is preserved in the next Sub-scries B. 41. 30. Bones of an Elbow-Joint, exhibiting the effects of inflammation which, probably, commenced in the joint. The texture of the bones has become porous and spongy: their articular surfaces are ulcerated ; and upon the external surface of each bone,,Ki SECOND SERIi-S there is an irregular deposit of new bone in ridges and sharp processes. 31. Bones of a Knee-Joint, exhibiting the effects of inflammation. Parts of the free surface of the cartilage upon each bone have been absorbed. There has also been a more extensive absorp- tion of the deep or attached surface of the cartilage, so that its connexion with the bone was loosened, and it was readily separable from it. Where the absorption of the deep surface ot the cartilage has taken place, granulations have arisen from the h0lnthe recent state the bones were seen to be exceedingly vascular; and it was presumed^inflammation of their articular surfaces preceded the other changes in the joint. 32. The articular portions of a Femur and a Patella exhibiting partial absorption of the articular cartilages, and loosenmg of their connexion with the bones. The cartdage upon the patella has been absorbed in its centre, and separable from the bone, except at its border, where .t stdl Jintains its natural firmness of connexion. Upon the postermr part of the condyles of the femur, the whole th.ckness of the cartilage is absorbed: the exposed surface of the bone ,s rough and very vascular. 33 The articular portions of two Femora and two Patelte from the ^ame individual.

There is also ulcera- tion of a part of the surface of the head and neck of the bone. 36. Bones of a Knee-Joint, exhibiting the effects of Inflammation, which it was presumed commenced in the synovial membrane. The greater part of the articular surfaces of the tibia and femur is deeply ulcerated; the portions of them which remain, are hardened and polished like ivory. Upon the exterior of each bone, contiguous to its articular surface, there is an irregular deposit of osseous substance. 37. Section of a Femur, exhibiting the effects of inflammation of the cancellous texture and articular surface of one of its con- dyles. The increased vascularity of the bone is evinced by the degree in which its vessels have received injection. The connexion of the articular cartilage with the bone was loosened so that it was readily separated. 38. The Bones of a Great Toe, in which, probably in consequence of gout, the articular surfaces of the metatarsal bone and first phalanx are in part destroyed, and there is an abundant deposit of hard nodulated new bone around their borders. 39. Portion of an Elbow-Joint, in which there are several car- tilaginous growths from the internal surface of the capsule, immediately above the olecranon. Two of these are closely attached to the capsule. A third is attached to it by a round and thin pedicle apparently formed by the synovial membrane. One portion of cartilaginous substance, which was found loose in the joint, is at the bottom of the bottle. 40. A Knee-Joint from a young subject, amputated on account of disease of the synovial membrane (see No. 41). The articular cartilages and bones are unaltered. The lateral ligaments are apparently unaltered in structure, but are considerably elongated, and have permitted displacement of the articular surfaces.98 SECOND SERIES. 41 Portion of the Synovial Membrane, with the Patella, from the Knee-Joint last described. The synovial membrane is con- siderably thickened, its internal surface is granulated, and portions of it in irregular pulpy masses overlay, so that they nearly conceal, the cartilaginous surface of the patella. 42 Portion of the Base of a Skull, exhibiting partial absorption of ' the surface of the glenoid cavity, the effect of disease m the ar- ticulation of the lower jaw. 43 Two Hip-Joints from the same person. In each joint the ligamentum teres is completely wanting. The capsule of each is perfect and exhibited no appearance of disease. In the usual situation of the attachment of the ligamentum teres there is a deep depression in the head of the femur, and just above this, the cartilage of each femur is slightly absorbed. 44 The Hip-Joint of a young subject. Dislocation of the femur occurred after disease of long standing. The head of the femur lies upon the ischium, close to the notch and a little above the tuberosity, in contact with the great ischiatic nerve under which bristles are passed. Immediately below the head of the bone is the obturator externus muscle. The articular car- tiLe of the femur has been completely absorbed; the surface of the bone is ulcerated and covered by lymph andI granulans No remains of the capsule are apparent. The shaft of the femur is fractured immediately below the trochanter. The fracture of the Femur occurred during life, and was probably the conse- Qul™ere convulsions of the thigh which bad «■£. symptoms of chorea, through the week previous \^\^™*^m * inflamed, and separated from the bone some mches below the fracture. 45 A Knee-Joint, exhibiting the effects of acute inflammation Effecting chiefly the articular cartilages The synovial mem- brane is slightly thickened and increased m vascularity. Upon «lla, as well as upon the outer condyle of the femur and he head of the tibia, the free surface of the articular cartilage s extensively absorbed. There has also been some absorption of its deep or attached surface, so that its connexion with theDISEASES OK JOINTS. El 2 98 bone is loosened. The exposed surface of the bones is ven vascular. The patient was a boy aged fifteen. The disease bad been of only two month duration; it commenced, apparently, in the cellular tissue of the bam, and thenci extended into the joint. During the last fortnight of its progress the pain was ex tiemcly severe. The limb was amputated and the patient recovered. 46. Bones of the Knee and Ankle-Joints of a boy, in whom ulcera- tion, connected with necrosis, extended through both the upper and lower articular surfaces of the tibia. The articular car- tilages of the femur and patella are diseased in almost exactly the same manner as those in the preceding specimen are. The cartilage of the upper surface of the astragalus is almost wholly removed, and the exposed bone is covered with lymph. From the same patient as No. 195 in the preceding Series. 47. Parts of the Ulnae of an old woman. An exactly similar portion of the articular cartilage of each ulna has been absorbed ; and the space thus left on the surface of each is filled by a vascular growth like a process of the synovial membrane. The specimens are represented in the Medico-Chimrgical Transactions, Vol. xxv., PI. ii., f. 1,2; where they are also described by Mr. Paget, together with Nos. 33, 43, 52, 53, in this Series ; Nos. 253, 254, in Series I.; and other speci- mens of symmetrical diseases. 48. Bones of the Hip-Joint, from a boy eighteen years old, in whom disease of the hip had existed for twelve years before death. Part of the head and neck of the femur has been removed by ulceration. There has been also ulceration of the wall of the acetabulum, widening its cavity, and at one point penetrating into the pelvis. New bone has been formed in the bottom of the acetabulum, and was intimately united with the rough ulcerated surface of the femur. The disease of the hip was not in progress when the patient died with phthisis. 49. A Hip-Joint, in which acute disease had been several months in progress; from a boy ten years old. The head of the femur has been d.slocated from the acetabulum to the dorsum of the -hum. Ulceratton of the capsule had taken place, and the b?ad oi the bone was contained in a cavity formed by the re-1()0 SECOND SKKIKS. mains of the capsule and by the surrounding muscles. Within this cavity, as well as in the acetabulum, was a mixture of a large quantity of pus and tuberculous matter. The section of the head of the femur shows tuberculous matter deposited in its cancellous texture. There is also a collection of tuberculous matter in the walls of the acetabulum communicating with its cavity and with the cavity of the pelvis. An abscess had formed between the periosteum and the shaft of the bone just below the trochanter. The ischiatic nerve is seen upon the tuberosity of the ischium, near the dislocated head of the bone. 50 A Shoulder-Joint, in which there is partial absorption of the * articular cartilage upon the head of the humerus and glenoid cavity. The tendon of the biceps is continued on the outside of the capsule of the joint, to the upper edge of the glenoid cavity. There is also a distinct slip of this tendon adherent to the lower part of the bicipital groove in the humerus. It is not know whether this condition of the tendon of the biceps were the ,Wt of injury or disease, or a congenital defect. The other shoulder-jomt presented a similar arrangement. 51 A Patella, in which there is softening, with fibrous degeneration ' and absorption, of the articular cartilage. The disease affects only half the cartilage. At the borders of the diseased part there are cracks extending in various directions through the whole thickness of the cartilage, and some of its substance be- tween the cracks is converted into close-set tufts of fine filaments, which float out from the surface of the bone, and are about twice as long as the healthy cartilage is thick In he centre of the diseased spot, where the morbid change has made most progress, the cartilage has been wholly removed, and the exposed surface of the patella is hard and nodulated. 52 The Bones of two Hip-Joints from the same person. In each oint are exhibited exactly the same morbid changes. Nothing remains of either ligamentum teres, except a few shreds_of fibrous tissue attached to the head of each femur. Close by he insertion of this ligament a similar small portion of each of articular cartilages has been removed by ulceration ; and on 1 interior surface of the neck of each femur there is an ntegula,101 DISEASES OF JOINTS. aperture in its synovial and fibrous covering, beneath which the surface of the bone is hard and nodulated. 53. The Bones and Ligaments of a Knee-joint. The anterior crucial ligament is wanting, and small portions of the articular cartilages of the femur and tibia have been absorbed, apparently after fibrous degeneration. The opposite joint was similarly and symmetrically diseased. 54. A Hip-Joint, exhibiting elongation of the capsule and of the liga- mentum teres. The ligamentum teres has separated through its whole length into three cords. The internal surface of the capsule is beset by small pedunculated membranous growths. The elongation of the capsule has allowed the head of the femur to pass to a considerable distance from the acetabulum, which is contracted to a small triangular cavity. Presented by W. J. Ward, Esq. An engraving of the specimen is published, with a paper by Mr. Stanley, " On Dislocations, accompanied by Elongation of the Ligaments," in the Medico-CMrurgical Transactions, Vol. xxiv., PI. iv. fig. 2, London, 1841. See also, for similar specimens, Nos. 24.31. in the next Series. 55. A Knee-Joint, in which during the course of long continued inflammation, the Tibia has been dislocated backwards and outwards. Firm anchylosis by fibrous tissue has taken place between the inner half of the upper surface of the tibia and the condyles of the femur. The patella is anchylosed to the outer surface and lower margin of the outer condyle of the femur. The external and internal lateral ligaments, retaining their normal attachments, are much elongated. 56. A Hip-Joint, in which there are portions of hard cartilaginous and osseous substance. They are fixed to the inner surface of the capsule, and to the anterior part of the neck of the femur, by adhesions of tough fibrous tissue ; their contiguous surfaces are exactly fitted to one another, and they form a nodulated, oval mass, nearly three inches long, one surface of which rested upon and was adapted to the neck of the femur. The capsule is thickened, and its interior is beset with slender pedunculated processes. From a woman upwards of seventy years old. The mass formed a distinct tumour projecting in the groin.102 SECOND SERIES. 57. A Knee-Joint, in which, in the course of inflammation of long standing, the Tibia and Fibula have been dislocated backwards so that the head of the tibia is fixed to the posterior surface of the condyles of the femur. The patella is fixed by osseous anchyloses to the outer condyle. Both the lateral ligaments and the ligamentum patellae are much elongated, but their tissue appears healthy. 58. A Hip-Joint, from a young woman, in which the articular car- tilages of the femur and acetabulum have been removed by ulceration, and the exposed surfaces of the bones are covered by soft granulations and flakes of lymph. The capsular liga- ment is thickened, and the head of the femur and the acetabulum appear enlarged. At the anterior and inner part of the capsule, there is a large oval opening with smooth defined margins. This opening was immediately beneath the tendon of the psoas and iliacus muscles, in the situation at which the bursa naturally existing beneath that tendon sometimes communicates with the cavity of the hip-joint. A large psoas abscess had long existed in this patient: and it seemed probable ft£ th pus haling passed under the tendon of the psoas and iliacus muscles, an IhLgh the aperture' of communication between the bursa and the joint, had excited acute inflammation of the latter. 59 The Hip-Joint of a child, in which the ligamentum teres, the ' cartikJ.of the acetabulum, and a part of the substance uniting the three component bones of the os innominatum, have been destroyed by ulceration. A portion of glass is passed through the floor of the acetabulum into the pelvis, where a collection of matter was formed beneath the obdurator muse e and fescia The acetabulum and the capsular ligament, a part of which preserved, are lined by lymph, which was mingled with pus ; but, with the exception of a slight superficial ulceration of its articular cartilage, the head of the femur is healthy. The child seven years old, had suffered for six months with pain and obscure intervals. Two months afterwards she died. Presented by R. W. Tamplin, Ksq.L03 DISEASES OF JOINTS. SUB-SERIES B.

Sections of the bones of a Hip-Joint, exhibiting complete osseous union of the head of the femur with the acetabulum. Their walls and cancellous tissues have coalesced, and are uninterruptedly continuous. The femur is fixed in extreme flexion. There are traces of healed ulceration through the bottom of the acetabulum into the pelvis. b. 3. The bones of a Hip-Joint, in which the head and neck of the femur and the brim of the acetabulum have been destroyed by ulceration. The ulcerated surfaces have healed, lhe femur was not dislocated: the remains of its neck appear to have rested in the acetabulum, and the trochanter minor m the foramen ovale. The bones are very slender, but their tissue appears healthy. B 4. The bones of a Hip-Joint, in which the head of the femur, after superficial ulceration, has been dislocated on the pos- terior border of the acetabulum, and is there firmly united bv bone. New bone has also been formed on all the adja- cent parts of the os innominatum. The acetabulum was deeply ulcerated. B. 5. The bones of a Hip-Joint, in which the head of the femur rests partly in the acetabulum and partly upon the ilium and in this situation has become firmly and smoothly uni ed by bone. In this, as in the preceding specimen, all the bones are of natural weight and hardness. B 6 The bones of a Hip-Joint, exhibiting an osseous anchylosis of the head of the femur to the ilium, similar to that shown in the preceding specimen. A thin band of bone, half an inch wide, is extended between the trochanter major and the upper part of the tuberosity of the ischium. B. 7. The bones of a Hip-Joint. The depth of the acetabulum isDISEASES OF JOINTS. 105 increased by absorption of its base, and by ossification of the cotyloid ligament. The articular surface of the femur is in part removed by absorption ; and there is a rough, nodulated formation of new bone around the margin of the head and on the neck of the femur. The surfaces of the acetabulum and of the head of the femur on which absorp- tion has taken place, are rough, hard, and deeply and irregu- larly perforated, like worm-eaten wood : parts of the remains of their articular surfaces are hardened and polished. . 8. The bones of a Hip-Joint, in which there has been ulceration of the acetabulum and of the head and part of the neck of the femur. The ulcerated surfaces appear to have healed, and were closely adapted. Presented by Richard Partridge, Esq. . 9. The bones of a Hip-Joint, in which there has been ulceration of the acetabulum and of the head and neck of the femur. Osseous deposit has taken place around the neck of the femur, and in thick nodvdes upon the posterior and inferior margins of the acetabulum. The remains of the head of the femur were adapted to the surface of new bone formed on the acetabulum ; and the summit of a very large mass of new bone growing up from the upper part of the neck rested on the surface of the new bone formed behind the posterior margin of the acetabulum. 10. The bones of a Hip-Joint, in which there has been extensive ulceration of the acetabulum, and of the head, neck, and parts of the trochanters of the femur. There is necrosis of the tuberosity of the ischium and of a portion of the great trochanter: both the dead pieces of bone are surrounded by grooves of separation. An ulcerated passage extends from the acetabulum through the ischium, just above its spine ; and new bone has been formed upon the shaft of the femur and other parts adjacent to the seats of the necrosis and ulceration. 11. Sections of the bones of a Hip-Joint, in which portions ofSECOND SERIES: SUB-SERIES ft the articular surfaces of the acetabulum and of the head of the femur have become finely polished and of an ivory-like texture. The polished portions are deeply penetrated by numerous minute irregular canals; and there is abundant formation of new bone round the margin of the head and on the neck of the femur, as well as about the brim of the acetabulum. 12. Sections of the bones of a Hip-Joint, in which there has been absorption of the upper part of the head of the femur. The surface of the part thus absorbed, as well as that of the acetabulum with which it was in contact, and on which it probably moved freely, are polished, ivory-like, and per- forated like those in the preceding specimen. 13. Portion of a Femur, exhibiting absorption of the upper part of its head, with a considerable formation of new bone around the margin of the head and on the neck. The bone is very light. 14. The bones of the Hip-Joint of a young person. The brim of the acetabulum, and the head, neck, and part of the shaft of the femur, have been completely removed by ulceration. There are also large ulcerated apertures in the upper and anterior walls of the acetabulum. 15. The bones of a Hip-Joint, in which there has been superficial ulceration of the acetabulum and of the head of the femur. The head of the femur was dislocated, and rested on the surface of some new bone formed on the posterior margin of the acetabulum. 16. Sections of the bones of a Hip-Joint, in which the depth of the acetabulum is increased by the deposit of osseous matter around its margin. Its articular surface, and that of the head of the femur, have been absorbed, and the surfaces exposed are hard, perforated, and in a few parts polished.

Portion of a Femur, exhibiting absorption, hardening, and polishing of the upper and anterior part, with osseous deposit around the margin, of its head. b. 18. An Os Innominatum, in which ulceration has removed the whole surface of the acetabulum, and has formed a large aperture of communication between its cavity and the in- terior of the pelvis. b. 19. Portion of a Femur, of which the head and neck have been removed by ulceration. New bone is formed, in a saccular shape, in front of the trochanter minor. b. 20. Portion of a Femur, in which the upper part of the head has been absorbed, flattened, and increased in width. Part of the surface absorbed is hard, polished, and perforated : new bone is formed on other parts. b. 21. Portion of a Femur, in which the neck of the bone appears to have yielded while in a softened condition, so as to permit the head to be carried backwards nearly into contact with the posterior part of the trochanter major. The bone is ligbt, and parts of it are brittle. b. 22. The bones of a Knee-Joint, in which the patella is united by bone to the space between the condyles of the femur, and the condyles are similarly united to the articular surfaces of the tibia. The disease, probably, commenced in the head of die tibia, this part of the bone being altered in structure, and deeply ulcerated. The tibia is drawn under the femur, and the joint fixed in the half-bent position. b. 23. The bones of a Knee-Joint, exhibiting ulceration of the arti- cular surfaces of the femur and tibia. b. 24. The bones of a Knee-Joint, in which the inner condyle ofSECOND SERIES: SUB-SERIES B. the femur is united by bone to the inner border of the arti- cular surface of the tibia. The rest of both the articular surfaces appears healthy. The bones are light. 15. The bones of the Knee-Joint of a young person, in which there is necrosis of part of the shaft of the femur, with ulceration of the cancellous texture extending through the epiphysis to the articular surface. 26. The bones of a Knee-Joint, light, spongy, and partially ulce- rated. What remains of the patella is united by bone to the femur, and the condyles of the femur are similarly anchylosed to the head of the tibia. 27. The lower end of a Femur, exhibiting ulceration of its wall, just above the condyles, with thickening of the surrounding bone, and superficial ulceration of the articular surface. 28. The bones of a Knee-Joint, exhibiting superficial ulceration of the articular surfaces of the femur, and very deep ulcera- tion of the head of the tibia. The bones are light, dry, and brittle. . 29. The bones of an Elbow-Joint, in which all the articular sur- faces are united and surrounded by bone. The joint is in the half-bent position. .30. Sections of the bones of an Elbow-Joint, in which there is complete osseous anchylosis between the humerus and ulna. .31. The bones of a Shoulder-Joint, in which the glenoid cavity and head of the humerus have been entirely removed by ulceration. The ulcerated surfaces have smoothly healed ; but, probably, there was no motion at the joint. ,. 32. The bones of both the Shoulder-Joints of an adult. In each joint there has been ulceration, or such absorption as occurs in chronic rheumatism, of the articular surfaces of the head of the humerus and the glenoid cavity. The heads of theDISK ASKS OF JOINTS. 1(1!) humeri are flattened and enlarged by growths of bone around their borders ; and the glenoid cavities, enlarged in a cor- responding degree and deepened, extend backwards and inwards to the bases of the spines of the scapulae. The articular surfaces thus enlarged are mutually adapted, and are hardened, perforated, and in some parts polished and ivory-like. The changes of structure are symmetrical, except in that the articular surfaces of the right shoulder- joint are more extensively polished than those of the left. 33. The bones of a Finger. There is osseous anchylosis, with slight lateral displacement, of the bones of the first and second phalanges. 34. The bones of a Carpus, with complete osseous union of their several articular surfaces. 35. The bones of two Toes, exhibiting ulceration of their arti- cular surfaces, and growths of bone around and near their articular borders ; the effects, probably, of gout. 36. The bones of a Carpus, with two of the Metacarpal Bones. There is osseous anchylosis of the metacarpal bones with the carpus, and of the several carpal bones with each other. A fracture of one of the metacarpal bones, which has been united, but with much displacement, probably preceded the disease of the articular surfaces. 37. Portions of a Radius and Ulna. There has been ulceration of the surfaces by which they were articulated. The ulce- rated surfaces, hardened and polished, have become remark- ably grooved and adapted to each other, so that the new joint which they form may have permitted a very free movement of the radius upon the ulna. The surface by which the ulna articulated with the carpus is similarly polished : the carpal surface of the radius is healthy. 38. The Bones of a Hip-Joint, in which there have been superficial ulceration of the head of the femur, and ulceration of the acetabulum penetrating to the cavity of the pelvis.lit) SECOND SERIES■ SUB-SERIES H. b. 39.

The other half of the joint is preserved in the preceding Series, No. 29. b. 42. The bones of a Hip-Joint, exhibiting an irregular, nodulated deposit of osseous substance upon the margins of the head of the femur, and of the acetabulum. The articular surfaces thus enlarged have been deprived of their cartilages, and are hardened, polished, and very irregularly and deeply per- forated. b. 43. The bones of the Hip-Joints of a man aged seventy-one, exhibiting nearly symmetrical changes of structure; the effects, probably, of chronic rheumatism. There is an irregular and very abundant deposit of osseous substance around the margins of the acetabula and upon the borders of the heads and necks of the femora. Both the width and the depth of the acetabula are thus greatly increased; their articular surfaces, as well as those of the femora, are hard and rough, and a portion of the head of one femur is polished and ivory-like. B. 44. A Humerus and a Scapula. There is a deposit of bone upon the end of the acromion, presenting an excavation on its under surface. The great tuberosity of the humerus presents a convex surface, which appears to have been adapted to, and to have moved in, the concavity on the under part of the acromion. Tt is probable, that these changes followed the destruction of the tendon of the biceps muscle, either by disease or by accidental rupture.Ill DISEASES OF JOTNTS. . '!;">. Pelvis and Femora, from a young man. The head of the femur and the acetabulum on the left side exliihit changes consequent on long continued disease of the hip-joint. The acetabulum is wider and shallower than is natural: the head of the femur, deeply ulcerated, has wholly lost its natural form. The ulcerated surfaces had healed, and the bones were united by a soft tissue which permitted a slight degree of motion between them. The left os inno- minatum and femur, atrophied, probably in consequence of their disuse, are considerably thinner and smaller in all their dimensions than the bones of the opposite side; and the left side of the pelvis is contracted by the nearly vertical position of the ilium. 46. An Os Innominatum and Femur, from a boy, exhibiting effects of disease of the hip-joint, similar to those shown in the speci- men last described. The walls of the acetabulum are in great part destroyed by ulceration, and its cavity communi- cates through three apertures with that of the pelvis. The head of the femur is also completely destroyed. All the bones are atrophied, and the ilium is placed almost vertically and deeply incurved. 47. Bones of two Knee-Joints from the same person. There has been inflammation in each joint, occasioning a deposit of new bone around the articular surfaces of both the femur and the patella. The patellae, displaced outwards, have been adapted to the outer condyles; and their articular cartilages having been completely removed, the opposite surfaces of the bones have been absorbed in regular and mutually adapted grooves, and are hardened, polished, and ivory-like. 48. The Pelvis and Femora of an adult. The head of each femur is dislocated upon the dorsum of the ilium. Portions of the capsules of the hip-joints remain, but there is no vestige of either ligamentum teres. There has been absorp- tion of the surface of the head of each femur, diminishing its size, and giving it an irregular conical form. The history of the case is not known. The dislocations may have been con-SECOND SERIES: SUB-SERIES B. genital, or, as the condition of the heads of the thigh bones may suggest, they may have been the consequence of ulcerative disease of the hip-joints. 49. The Bones of a Leg with the lower end of the Femur. The head of the tibia is fixed by firm osseous anchylosis to the articular surfaces of the femur and fibula. The shafts of the tibia and fibula are curved outwards. The wall of the tibia is irregularly thickened; and on the anterior and upper part, near the knee-joint, there is a rough and porous elevated surface of new bone. Over this surface there had long been an ulcer extending to the bone. . 50. A Scapula and Humerus united by bone. The head of the humerus has disappeared, and the upper part of the shaft is fixed by an irregular growth of bone to the remains of the glenoid cavity and the base of the coracoid process. The spine and inferior costa of the scapula are thickened. 8 51. Bones of a Hip-Joint. The neck of the femur is not more than half an inch long. The head is expanded and flattened into the form of a disk; its margin is very irregular; its articular surface is soft, and perforated by numerous small holes. The acetabulum is wide and shallow, in correspond- ence with the form of the head of the femur, which exactly fitted in it. The notch of the acetabulum is very large, and much of the osseous tissue adjacent to it seems to have been destroyed. B 52. A Scapula and the upper part of a Humerus diseased in the same manner as b. 44. The borders of the acromion are thickened and beset by nodules of new bone. A small portion of its inferior surface, indurated and polished, was adapted to a similar surface on the upper part of the head and the great tubercle of the humerus. Around the head of the humerus and on its tuberosities there are deposits of bone similar to those on the borders of the acromion. b. 53. A Humerus, Radius and Ulna. In consequence of chronicDISEASES OF JOINTS. 113 disease of the elbow-joint, the fore arm appears to have been for a long time nearly fixed in a position of extreme flexion, with the hand in extreme pronation. The articular surface of the humerus is much deformed; the internal condyle is reduced in size and pointed ; the trochlear cavity is nearly obliterated; the greater part of the articular car- tilage was removed; the external condyle has a part of its surface hardened and polished; and nodules of new bone have been deposited around the borders of the articular surface. The outer division of the greater sigmoid cavity of the ulna is hard, polished, and superficially grooved: the inner division is soft and rough as if it had been deeply ulcerated. The lesser sigmoid cavity is obliterated ; and just below its place, there is a large and deep pit in which the tubercle of the radius rested. The head of the radius is directed back- wards from the shaft. The articular surface has lost its cartilage, and new bone is deposited around a great part of its border. • The anterior border of the head of the radius, which rested on the front of the external condyle of the humerus, has formed a wide and slightly concave surface, which is covered by hard polished bone, like that on the surface of the condyle itself. The lower ends of the shafts of the radius and ulna are healthy. b. 54. Portions of an Os Innominatum and a Sacrum, exhibiting the effects of inflammation in the sacro-iliac symphysis and the posterior part of the ilium. The surface of the diseased bone is ulcerated, and around it are irregular deposits of new bone. A large circular hole is seen in the ilium, the result of necrosis of a portion of its texture. b. 55. An Os Innominatum and a Sacrum united by a bridge of bone, an inch wide, extending across the front of the right sacro- iliac symphysis. The symphysis itself appears to have been healthy. b. 56. A similar specimen ; but the bridge of bone is much wider,4 SECOND SERIES, SUB-SERIES B. extending from the upper edge of the sacrum to the margin of the superior aperture of the pelvis. . 57. A similar specimen. The bridge of bone here extends across both the upper and the lower part of the front of the sacro- iliac symphysis; and it also appears as if portions of the surfaces of the symphysis itself are united by bone.SERIES III.

A Shoulder-Joint, exhibiting partial absorption of the head of the humerus and glenoid cavity, with flattening and a great in- crease of the width of their articular surfaces. The surfaces of the scapula and humerus which were brought into contact by the absorption are exactly adapted to each other, and are covered by a substance like cartilage, so as to form a new joint. It is probable that these changes were the consequence of disloca- tion of the humerus. 2. Portion of a Humerus, in the middle of the shaft of which fracture occurred four years before death. The ends of the bone did not unite, but are enlarged, have become accurately adapted to each other, and have acquired a hard polished surface on those portions between which there was friction during the movements of the arm. The use of the arm was so little impaired by the fracture that the patient worked as a sailor to the time of his death. Presented by P. Brendon, Esq.117 INJURIES OF BONES AND JOINTS. 3. Portion of a Humerus, in which fracture of the shaft occurred many years before death. The ends of the bone did not unite : they are somewhat enlarged, and are covered by a substance like fibro-cartilage, and connected by a distinct membranous capsule, which is smooth upon its internal surface, and serves as a kind of capsular ligament to the false joint which is formed between the ununited portions of the bone. From a middle-aged woman : the fracture was produced by a slight muscular effort. 4. Sections of the Cartilage of a Rib, which appears to have been fractured and reunited by new cartilaginous substance placed in the angles between the ends of its overlapping portions. 5. An Elbow-Joint, in which there has been fracture and disloca- tion. The radius and ulna are broken about two inches below the joint: and their fractured ends, not having united by bone, are connected by new capsules which have formed around them. The head of the radius is dislocated upwards and forwards in front of the humerus. 6. An Elbow-Joint, exhibiting a transverse fracture extending through the base of the olecranon into the cavity of the joint. A portion of quill is passed between the ununited fractured surfaces. 7. Portion of a Femur, exhibiting a vertical fracture of recent occurrence through that part of its neck which is covered by synovial membrane. Upon the anterior half of the circumfer- ence of the neck of the bone, the periosteal and synovial cover- ings are torn : upon the posterior half they are entire. 8. A Hip-Joint, exhibiting a vertical fracture of recent occurrence through that part of the neck of the femur which is covered by synovial membrane. The capsule is thickened, and a portion of it, which is detached and turned downwards, has lymph de- posited upon its internal surface. 9. An Os Calcis, fractured transversely through its posterior part.THIRD SERIES. 118 The plane of fracture extends from the posterior border of the upper articular surface to the middle of the posterior surface of the tuberosity. The patient fell from a height, but did not strike his heel; and it appeared certain that the fracture of the os calcis was produced by the action of the muscles of the leg. He died of other injuries received in the fall. 10. Portion of a Femur, in which fracture of the neck and of the trochanter major occurred six weeks before death. The direc- tion of the fracture is still evident; it extended through the base of the neck, and through the base of the trochanter major, nearly detaching this process from the rest of the bone. The head and neck were forced downwards and impacted between the trochanters. The several parts of the bone thus brought into contact are united so firmly that they could not be moved upon each other. 11. Portion of a Femur, in which there has been fracture of the neck and of the upper part of the shaft. The plane of one fracture extended through the base of the neck; that of the other extended vertically through the trochanters, so as to separate the posterior parts of these processes and of the bone between them. The head and neck of the femur are driven downwards and impacted in the cleft through the trochanters : and in this position the fractured portions are firmly united. 12. Portions of a Femur in which there has been fracture through the base of the neck, and, apparently, a fracture through the trochanter major like that in the specimen last described. The base of the neck has been driven into the cancellous tissue be- tween the trochanters, in which situation it is firmly united by bone and fibrous tissue. The fracture of the trochanter has been firmly united by bone. 13. An Elbow-Joint, in which the head of the radius was dislocated backwards. No reduction of the dislocated bone having been effected, it has become extensively united to the side of the ulna. There appears, also, to have been a fracture of the internal condyle. All the bones are atrophied.119 INJURIES OF BONES AND JOINTS. 14. Portion of a Femur, exhibiting fracture of its neck and shaft . Two distinct lines of fracture may be traced, one across the base of the neck, the other passing obliquely through the shaft just in front of, and below, the trochanter major, and through the trochanter minor. The base of the neck is fixed between the fragments, but not tightly. 15. Portion of a Femur, in which, as in the last described, there is a fracture through the base of the neck and the upper part of the shaft. One line of fracture passes vertically through the base of the neck; the other extends vertically through the middle of the great trochanter and for about three inches down the shaft, and through the trochanter minor. The head is impacted between the fragments, and osseous union has taken place in the lower part of the vertical fracture. 16. Portion of a Femur, in which there is fracture of its neck and shaft. The fracture runs obliquely through the base of the neck ; it also extends in several directions through the adjacent parts of the shaft, separating some small portions of it. The trochanters are entire. 17. Portion of a Femur, in which fracture of the neck occurred many years before death. There has been complete absorption of the neck of the bone. The surfaces of the head and of the space between the trochanters which have been in contact, and which probably moved freely on each other, are very hard, polished, and ivory-like. 18. Portion of a Femur, exhibiting a fracture through its neck, just beyond the base of the head. The direction of the fracture is such, that the surface of the bone exhibits on the one side an eminence, and on the other a corresponding cavity. The periosteum and the synovial membrane covering the neck are torn in only the anterior half of its circumference: upon the other half, the membranes are entire and still connect the two parts of the bone, which may thus, as well as by the mutual adaptation of the uneven surfaces of the fracture, have been held together with very little displacement.THIRD SERIES. 1-20 19. A Hip-Joint, exhibiting fracture of the neck of the Femur within the capsule, which occurred many years before death. The neck of the bone is absorbed. Bristles are passed beneath three thick fibrous bands, which extend from the fractured surface of the head of the bone to the capsule. The capsule is generally thickened, as if by the organization of lymph upon its internal surface : and the fractured surfaces are covered by thin smooth layers of fibrous tissue. 20. A Hip-Joint, in which a dislocation of the head of the Femur upon the ischiatic notch occurred about three weeks before death. The ligamentum teres has been torn across its middle; no union of it has taken place. The cartilage covering the head of the bone is in part absorbed. The opening in the capsule through which the head of the bone escaped was situated at the posterior part of the joint. Only a small part of this opening is visible, the larger part of it being closed by the union of the torn edges of the capsule. The acetabulum is fractured, but it is doubtful whether this occurred during life. 21. Sections of the Head and Neck of a Femur, from an aged woman. On the surface of each section, a white line is visible, which extends obliquely from above downwards and inwards, in a plane which would include the base of the neck at its upper part and the base of the head at its lower part. The line marks the section of a thin layer of fibrous tissue, and appears to indicate that a fracture of the neck of the femur has been united partly by fibrous tissue and partly by bone. The head of the femur is below the great trochanter, and there is an accumulation of bone on the posterior surface of the neck, in a line corresponding with the direction of the presumed fracture. 22. Sections of the Head and Neck of the other Femur of the same woman. They present the same appearances as those last described, but the line of fibrous tissue is here uninterrupted, while in the preceding it is in some places interrupted by small portions in which the osseous tissue is continuous, as if the fracture had in them united by bone. The preparations were taken from a body supplied for dissection, of which no history could be obtained.121 INJURIES OF BONES AND JOINTS. 23. A Hip-Joint, exhibiting fracture of the neck of the Femur. The fracture extends vertically through the neck just beyond the base of the head. The capsule is much thickened, and the neck of the femur is absorbed. 24. A Hip-Joint, exhibiting dislocation of the head of the Femur with elongation of the capsule. The capsule is entire, and measures, now that it is laid open, between four and five inches in length. The cavity of the acetabulum has almost disappeared, being both reduced in size and filled by fibrous tissue. The ligamentum teres is absent, and a portion of the head of the femur has been absorbed. The capsule around the neck of the femur presents a fringe of slender growths. The specimen is figured in the Medico-Chirurgical Transactions, Vol. xxiv. PI. iv., fig. 1, London, 1841 : in illustration of a paper by Mr. Stanley, " On Dis- locations, accompanied by Elongations of the Ligaments." 25. A Hip-Joint, exhibiting a recent dislocation of the head of the Femur on the lower edge of the obturator externus muscle. The ligamentum teres is torn from its attachment to the head of the femur. The capsule is extensively lacerated at the inner side and lower part of the joint. The obturator externus muscle is lacerated where the femur rest partly on it and partly on the subjacent obturator ligament. 26. A Patella, with a small piece of bone, which had probably been broken off, and is now connected by ligament with its lateral border. 27. Portion of a Skull, exhibiting a fracture through the posterior part of the orbital plate of the frontal bone. The fracture was occasioned by the passage of an iron rod through the orbit into the brain. 28. Two Patellae from the same person. Both bones have been fractured transversely. The fractured portions of each, having been separated to a distance of five inches from each other, are connected only by a thin fibrous membrane. The fragments are all, but not equally, enlarged. 29. Section of a Patella which has been fractured into three pieces.THIRD SliRlES. 122 The portions are united by a thick ligamentous substance, and are all enlarged ; the upper fragment alone is as large, and has the same form, as an ordinary adult patella. 30. Section of a Patella in which there has been a transverse frac- ture. The fractured surfaces are united by a thick portion of ligament about an inch in length, which is smoothly lined, as if by a continuation of the synovial membrane. As in the pre- ceding specimens, the fragments are enlarged, and their texture is unaltered. 31. A Hip-Joint, exhibiting dislocation of the head of the Femur on the dorsum of the ilium, which occurred a considerable time before death. On one side of the preparation is a part of the original capsule; this has been extensively divided in front, to show the acetabulum, which is contracted into a narrow triangular cavity nearly filled by fibrous tissue. On the other side of the preparation, the head of the bone is shown, deformed, reduced in size, and surrounded by a thick membrane of tough fibrous tissue, which is smooth on its internal surface. This membrane, forming the capsule of the new joint, is in part newly formed, and in part consists of the remains of the former capsule: it is extensively divided behind, to give a distinct view of the head of the bone. The cavity of the new capsule communicates with that of the old capsule below the neck of the femur, and their smooth internal linings are continuous. 32. Sections of the upper part of a Femur, in which a fracture ex- tended obliquely through the base of its neck, in a line marked by bristles. The synovial and periosteal coverings of the neck of the bone are entire, and there is, in consequence, no separa- tion of the fractured surfaces. The patient was a man sixty years old. He was knocked down, and com- plained of pain in the hip; but there was neither shortening nor eversion of the limb, and its several motions could be exercised with perfect freedom and power. He died with intestinal disease five weeks after the accident. The case is de- scribed by Mr. Stanley, in the Medico-Chirurgical Transactions, Vol. xiii., p. 511. London, 1825. Case Book, Vol. i., p. 75, No. 114. 33. An Elbow-Joint, exhibiting dislocation of the Radius and Ulna123 INJURIES OF BONES AND JOINTS. backwards, which occurred a considerable time before death. The articular surface of the humerus was completely covered by a newly-formed capsule, the cavity of which is laid open from the front. The head of the radius and the articular surface of the ulna are also inclosed in new capsules, separated from each other and from that which incloses the articular end of the humerus. The sigmoid cavity of the ulna appears to rest on a prominence of bone, extending from the posterior surface of the trochlea of the humerus. The head of the radius is confined in the place which it now occupies by a thick fibrous cord, ex- tending from its upper surface to a process of bone connected with the margin of the humerus just above the outer condyle. 34. A Knee-Joint, exhibiting the consequences of a fracture in the lower part of the femur. The fracture extended transversely through the shaft a little above the condyles, and downwards between the condyles into the joint. The upper portion of the bone was forced downwards by the side of the patella, and a few days after the fracture, it protruded through the integu- ments, and could not be again replaced. In this situation it has become firmly fixed by bone to the condyles and the lower part of the shaft. An inch and a half of the protruding por- tion of the femur perished, and its separation from the living bone had commenced: a shallow groove is formed between them. The articular surfaces of the knee-joint are anchylosed. 35. The Scapular end of a Clavicle, with a small portion of bone united to it by a distinct joint. It is uncertain whether this had heen separated by fracture. 36. Portion of a Scapula exhibiting fracture of the Acromion, which has been united by fibrous tissue. 37. Portion of a Sternum fractured upon its internal surface by a bullet, which has become firmly imbedded in the surface of the bone, and in new bone deposited so as to form a shallow pit beneath it. 38. Portion of a Skull in which an extensive fracture of the adja-124 THIRD SERIES. cent parts of the occipital and parietal bones occurred four years before death. Some portions of bone, detached by the fracture, were removed at the time of the accident: other por- tions were left, and have been re-united by bone. There is also a close union by bone of two lines of fracture extending outwards through the parietal bones. The margins of all the broken portions of bone have been smoothly rounded, and their exposed diploe is covered in by compact bone. Case Book, Vol. i., p. i., No. 4. 39. A Wrist-Joint, exhibiting dislocation of the carpal ends of the radius and ulna backwards. The radius is arched with a con- vexity directed backwards, near its lower end: but there is no appearance of its having been fractured. 40. Portion of a Femur, exhibiting an irregular fracture through the base of its neck, which occurred about five months before death. The periosteal and synovial coverings are torn upon only the posterior side of the neck of the bone ; upon its an- terior side they are entire. The portion of the neck which remains connected with the head of the femur is not absorbed. The patient, a middle-aged man, fell in the street, and his hip struck against the curh-stone. Immediately afterwards the limh was inverted, and an inch shorter than the other; but no crepitus was felt. In the suspicion that disloca- tion existed, repeated attempts at reduction were made. The case is recorded by Mr. Stanley, in the Medico-Chirurgical Transactions, Vol. xiii., p. 508. Lon- don, 1825. Case Book, Vol. i., p. 73, No. 113. 41. A Radius and Ulna which were fractured a considerable time before death. The overlapping ends of the bones are united by thick tough layers of fibro-cellular tissue. They have been in part separated, to show the mode of their union. 42. A Shoulder-Joint, exhibiting dislocation of the humerus, which occurred eighteen months before death. The head of the humerus rests on the anterior surface, near the inferior border, of the scapula. The tendons of the supra-spinatus, infra- spinatus, teres minor, and sub-scapularis muscles are entire. A bristle is passed beneath the tendon of the sub-scapularis, close to its insertion. A bristle is also passed beneath theINJURIES OF BONES AND JOINTS. 125 tendon of the long head of the hiceps, which retains its attach- ment to the edge of the glenoid cavity. Two bristles are passed beneath the circumflex nerve, which has been com- pressed by the dislocated head of the humerus, and is, in con- sequence, flattened and firmly adherent to the capsule of the joint. The dislocation was followed by permanent paralysis of the deltoid muscle. 43. A Hip-Joint, exhibiting dislocation of the Femur which oc- curred many years before death. The head of the femur has been thrown upwards and forwards, and is lodged in a cavity, formed in part by new bone, and in part by what appeared to be the displaced cotyloid ligament, at the margin of the ilium, in the situation of the anterior inferior spine. The ligamentum teres is flattened and elongated, but it retains its natural con- nexions ; bristles are passed beneath the two portions of this ligament, which are attached to the margin of the original acetabulum. The lower part of the head of the femur is irre- gularly absorbed. The patient was forty years old. When he was about fourteen years old, he fell from a ladder and injured his hip. He had great pain at the time of the accident, and for many months much difficulty in walking; but he recovered, and was in an active walking occupation till his last illness. The case is re- corded by Mr. Wormahl, in the London Medical Gazette, Vol. xix., p. 658, London, 1837. 44. The lower extremities of a Tibia and Fibula. A recent fracture extends through the articular surface and cartilage of the tibia. The communication of this fracture with the ankle-joint is closed by a thin layer of lymph firmly adhering to all the parts of the articular cartilage through which the fracture extends. 45. Sections of the Head, Neck, and part of the shaft of a Femur. The neck of the bone is considerably shortened, and there is irregular osseous deposit upon its external surface. It is uncertain whether these changes were consequent on injury. The external appearance of the bone might indicate that there had been a fracture of the neck ; but the uniform character of its tissue, as shown on the surface of the sections, is . opposed to such a conclusion. 46. Portion of a Humerus, in which distinct fractures extend ver- tically through both its condyles into the elbow-joint. The fractured surfaces are united by fibrous tissue.rHIRD SERIES. 47. A Shoulder-Joint with the shaft of the Humerus, exhibiting dislocation and fracture. The head of the humerus is thrown forwards beneath the coracoid process. The tendon of the long head of the biceps is entire. The tendons of the supra- spinal, infra-spinatus, teres minor, and sub-scapularis muscles are also entire. There have been two fractures in the shaft of the bone, and they are both firmly united. The injury consisted, in the first instance, of the dislocation and a single frac- ture. No attempt was made to reduce the dislocation, and when the fracture had united, the patient fell down, and the second fracture then occurred. 48. Section of the Cartilage of a Rib, which has been fractured and is firmly united. The uniting medium consists of a substance like cartilage with small deposits of bone in it. 49. Portion of a Femur, in which fracture of the neck occurred many years before death. The neck of the bone is absorbed: both the fractured surfaces are thinly covered by fibrous tissue; and that of the head has become firmly united to the lower part of the thickened capsule by a broad band of fibrous or ligamentous substance. 50. Portion of a Femur, exhibiting fracture of its neck. The plane of the fracture is vertical, extending from the upper margin of the head straight downwards through the neck to the outer part of its lower border. Bristles are introduced between the frac- tured surfaces, which are in close apposition, and it will be observed that the attachment of the capsule to the bones is entirely beyond the line of the fracture. That portion of the neck of the bone which remained connected with the trochanters is partly absorbed, and the union of the fractured surfaces, although not complete, is by osseous matter inlaid between them. The individual from whom this specimen was taken was eighteen years of age. In a fall from a cart he injured his right hip; such symptoms ensued as gave rise to the belief that he had dislocated the head of the femur into the foramen ovale. Efforts at reduction were accordingly made. About three months after the injury he died with small pox. The case is described by Mr. Stanley in the Medioo- Chirurgical Transactions, Vol. xviii. p. 256, London, 1833. Case Book, Vol. i. p. 86, No. 122.INJURIES OF BONES AND JOINTS. 51. A Knee-Joint from a young subject, with an oblique frac- ture of the Femur just above the condyles. The upper por- tion of the femur, crossing the lower portion obliquely, has been united by bone to the back part of the outer condyle. About two inches of the extremity of the upper portion of the femur protruding through the skin were sawn off during life. Inflammation extending to the knee-joint has produced absorp- tion of the articular cartilages and adhesion of the opposite parts of the joint. At the bottom of the bottle is the piece of bone which was removed by the saw. 52. A Patella, in which a vertical fracture occurred a short time before death. The tendinous covering of the anterior surface of the bone is entire. Union of the fracture has not yet com- menced. The articular cartilage is in part absorbed; but this had, probably, occurred before the fracture. 53. Shoulder-Joint, exhibiting an incomplete dislocation of the Humerus backwards. The head of the humerus, unaltered in form, rests against the posterior border of the glenoid cavity. The tendons of the supra-spinatus and infra-spinatus are de- tached from the tuberosity of the humerus, but retain their con- nexion with the capsule. The tendon of the biceps is displaced from its groove in the humerus, but retains its attachment to the glenoid cavity. The tendons of the teres minor and sub- scapulars retain their attachments to the humerus. The cap- sule of the joint is thickened. 54. Portion of a Femur, in which a fracture of the neck within the capsule occurred a short time before death. The synovial and periosteal membranes are entire on the posterior half of the neck. 55. A Shoulder-Joint, in which a complete dislocation of the Humerus occurred about a fortnight before death. The head of the humerus was found resting on the subscapular fossa, and im- mediately below the clavicle. The tendon of the biceps retains its attachments to the margin of the glenoid cavity. The128 THIRD SERIES. tendons of the supra-spinatus and infra-spinatus are detached from the humerus, but retain their connexion with the capsule. The tendons of the teres minor and sub-scapularis retain their attachment to the humerus. There is a large lacerated aperture in the capsule. 56. A Hip-Joint, exhibiting a dislocation of the head of the Femur downwards and backwards, which occurred twelve hours before death. The head of the bone is situated on the ischium, opposite to the lesser ischiatic notch and the upper part of the tube- rosity. The tendon of the obturator internus is torn from its muscular fibres; some of the fibres of the pyriformis, gemelli, and glutaeus minimus are also torn. There is also a fracture extending through the os innominatum near the acetabulum. The patient was a maniac, who leaped from a third story window. He died of other injuries received at the Bame time. The case is puhlished by Mr. Wormald, in the London Medical Gazette, Vol. xix., p. 657, London, 1837. 57. The Bones of a Great Toe. The second phalanx, dislocated on the upper surface of the first phalanx, has there become firmly fixed by bone. 58. Portion of a Humerus, which has been fractured near the middle of its shaft. New bone is formed upon its outer surface, imme- diately above and below the fracture. The extremity of the lower portion of the bone has perished, and is in progress of exfoliation. The fractured surfaces were united by a soft substance; and a distinct capsule has been formed around the ends of the bone by the condensation of the surrounding cellu- lar tissue. From a girl twenty-three years old. The fracture was caused by external violence six years before death, while she was affected with syphilis. Presented by William Taylor, Esq. 59. A Shoulder-Joint. The capsule is thickened : in its upper part is an irregular opening, and the tendon of the supra-spinatus is here seen to have been torn away from the tuberosity of the humerus. The tendon of the biceps appears also to have been torn near its attachment to the glenoid cavity, and has become \INJUR IKS OF MONKS A NO JOINTS. 12U t adherent to the head of the humerus : a portion of it in shreds remains attached to the edge of the glenoid cavity. 60. The other Shoulder-Joint of the person from whom the pre- ceding specimen was taken. The capsule is thickened. The tendon of the biceps, separated from the glenoid cavity, has become firmly adherent to the head of the humerus, and an irregular nodulated deposit of bone has taken place around the part to which it is now attached. It is presumed that the alterations in these joints were the effects of external injury; probahly, of dislocation of the humerus. 61. Bones of the first and second phalanx of a Great Toe. The bone of the second phalanx is dislocated, and firmly united by bone to the upper surface of the first phalanx. 62. Portion of an Os Innominatum, exhibiting united fracture, with absorption of bone, in the bottom of the acetabulum. The fracture extended in several directions from the centre of the acetabulum to its circumference. The fracture was caused by a fall on the trochanter major a few months before death. 63. A Skull-Cap, in which fracture with loss of bone was produced by the wheel of a cart passing over the head several years before death. The frontal and right parietal bones were broken into many pieces; and the sagittal and coronal sutures were separated. Several portions of bone, which were insulated by the fracture, were removed, leaving numerous and considerable apertures in the skull; other insulated portions are thinned by absorption, but their edges are reunited by osseous substance. Considerable thickening of the frontal bone has taken place in one situation contiguous to the fracture. No new bone appears to have been formed in the spaces left after the removal of the loose fragments. 64. Section of a Sternum, exhibiting a dislocation between its first and second bones. The two bones overlap considerably, the first projecting in front of the second. The contiguous peri- osteal surfaces are firmly united. There is also a deposit KTHIRD SERIES. 130 of osseous substance upon the anterior surface of the second bone immediately below the projecting end of the first. The dislocation occurred five months hefore death, in an elderly man who fell from a tree. He died with cancer of the oesophagus. The other half of the sternum and the oesophagus, arc in the Museum of the Royal College of Surgeons of England. Presented by Joseph Swan, Esq. 65. Section of a Humerus, in which a fracture of the middle of the shaft occurred five weeks before death. The ends of the bone are not united ; but they are held firmly together by a ring of rough osseous substance deposited on the whole circumference of their outer surfaces, and extending some way above and below the fracture. 66. The other half of the Humerus, No. 65, macerated. 67. Section of a Tibia, in which are two fractures which occurred twelve weeks before death; one extends across its shaft, the other through the cancellous texture of its inferior extremity. The fractured surfaces are united only by soft substance. 68. A Hip-Joint, in which a dislocation of the Femur occurred a week before death. The capsule has been opened in front to show the head of the femur, which is deprived of many large portions of its cartilage, some of which are seen loosely con- nected with the neck of the bone. At the back part of the joint is the wide laceration in the capsule which was made by the head of the femur in its dislocation from the acetabulum. It was supposed that the dislocated head of the femur was situated upon the ischium, close to its spine. A portion of the posterior part of the rim of the acetabulum, in the presumed direction of the dislocation, is separated by fracture. Upon the front part of the joint there is also a detached portion of the rim of the acetabulum connected with the capsule. The surface of this piece of bone is very smooth, and is adapted to a cor- responding surface of the ilium immediately below the anterior inferior spine ; and above this surface, there is a deposit of bone, making it probable that the changes in this part of the joint were the result of some injury previous to the dislocation.131 INJURIES OF BONES AND JOINTS. 69. Section of the Tibia of a Dog, exhibiting the process of union on the tenth day after a transverse fracture through the middle of the shaft. A ring-shaped mass of cartilaginous substance is deposited between the periosteum and bone, around and for some way above and below the line of the fracture. In the centre of this cartilage there are some minute deposits of earthy matter. The line of fracture is distinct: in the medul- lary cavity it is interrupted by a deposit of cartilaginous sub- stance ; but in the walls of the bone it is still open. 70. Section of the Tibia of a Dog; the other half of the specimen No. 69. The periosteum is turned downwards and completely separated from the cartilaginous substance deposited upon the bone around, above, and below, the fracture. 71. Section of the Tibia of a Dog, exhibiting the process of union on the eighteenth day after a similar fracture. The cartilagi- nous substance deposited between the periosteum and bone around, above, and below the fracture, is ossified, except in that part which corresponds with the line of fracture. This line is still open, as in the preceding specimen, in the wall of the bone, but is closed by cartilaginous substance in the me- dullary tube. The experiments by which these specimens were obtained were performed by Mr. Stanley. 72. Two portions of a fractured Patella, which were united by ligamentous substance. The lower portion is much enlarged and altered in form by the deposit of osseous substance upon its borders. 73. Portions of Costal Cartilages. There has been a fracture of the cartilage of one of the false ribs. Its portions overlap, and are firmly united by a ring of bone extending around them. 74. A Shoulder-Joint, exhibiting an ununited fracture of the neck of the humerus, with obliteration of the axillary artery from the pressure of the lower portion of the bone against it. The k 2THIRD SERIES. fracture extends transversely through the humerus, immediately helow its head and below the tuberosities ; and it communi- cates with the cavity of the shoulder-joint. A small detached piece of the bone is connected with the synovial membrane. The synovial membrane is thickened, and its internal surface is rough. A bristle is passed beneath the tendon of the biceps. The axillary artery is obliterated, to the extent of half an inch, in the situation in which the end of the lower portion of the humerus pressed against it. Immediately above the oblite- rated part, the infra-scapular artery arises, of its usual size, and pervious. Close to the infra-scapular is the posterior circumflex artery, obliterated in the first half inch from its origin, and then pervious by means of the collateral circulation. About two inches above the origin of the infra-scapular, a large branch arises from the axillary artery; this branch, ex- tending down the inside of the arm, was continued into one of the arteries of the fore-arm, and formed a principal channel for transmitting blood from the upper to the lower part of the limb. From a man aged seventy-five. The injury occurred ten years before death. 75. Ossa Nasi, exhibiting the union of a transverse fracture a short distance above their lower borders. 76. Section of the Femur of an old man, in which a fracture through the base of its neck, and through the upper part of the great trochanter, occurred many years before death. The neck was driven into the upper part of the shaft between the tro- chanters ; and in this situation a layer of compact bone has been formed on the whole of the broken surface of the can- cellous tissue of the shaft and trochanters, in such a manner as to form a smooth excavation, in which the neck of the femur rests. To this excavated surface the neck of the femur, itself also covered by compact bone, was connected by ligamentous tissue. The fracture through the trochanter is completely united by bone. A similar specimen, except in that the fractured base of theINJURIES OF BONES AND JOINTS. neck is partially absorbed, and there is no appearance of fracture of the trochanter. From ii woman eighty-five years old. The fracture occurred three years before death. Presented by William Radnor, Esq. 78. Section of the Radius of a young man, which has been frac- tured three quarters of an inch above its carpal articular surface. The posterior or dorsal margin of the upper fragment is driven into the cancellous tissue of the lower one: their palmar margins are in contact, but a projecting angle is here formed, in the front of the wrist, at the line of fracture. The fracture is united, and new bone is formed in the angle between the displaced dorsal margins of the fragments. 79. Section of a Tibia from a case of compound fracture, in which amputation was performed eleven weeks after the occurrence of the injury. The two portions of bone are held firmly together by osseous substance deposited around the torn edges of the periosteum, and in the contiguous cellular tissue. The union of the fractured surfaces of the walls of the bone and of its medullary tissue is not yet complete; the uniting medium here consisting of only soft substance. 80. Section of a fractured Fibula; from the same limb as No. 79. A small piece of bone, which was detached, has been re-united. The upper and lower portions of the fibula have become so displaced that the fractured end of the lower has rested against the outer surface of the upper portion. In this situation they have become firmly united by bone. 81. Section of a fractured Rib, which has re-united with displace- ment and overlapping of its ends. The firm union of the two portions of the rib has been effected by the abundant deposit of osseous substance in the texture of the periosteum and contiguous cellular tissue around, and for some way above and below, the fracture. A spiculum of bone projects from one sitle of the rib; this was probably a fragment separated by the fracture, and re-united to the outer surface of the rib.t84 I IIIRl) SERIES. 82. Section of a Rib with its cartilage. The rib had been separated from the cartilage, but has reunited to it. The union is effected by an abundant deposit of osseous substance, apparently in the texture of the periosteum and perichondrium, and in the con- tiguous cellular tissue around and for some way above and below the line of separation. 83. Section of a Skull-Cap, exhibiting a fracture extending in several directions through the anterior part of the parietal bones. In one situation there is a fracture of the outer, without any corresponding fracture of the inner, table. 84. Section of a Skull-Cap, exhibiting a comminuted circumscribed fracture of the outer and inner tables of one of the parietal bones. Many pieces of the inner table are depressed. During life the outer table was raised by the elevator; and it was supposed that the instrument was acting upon the whole thickness of the skull, whereas the fragments of the inner table remained unmoved. 85. Portion of an Ulna from an adult, split and detached by a fracture which was occasioned by the arm being caught m machinery. The fractured portion, about four inches in length, comprises in its whole extent about one half of the thickness of the ulna. It is remarkable that the bone was splintered to so great an extent longitudinally without the fracture passing at any part through the entire thickness of the shaft. The vacancy left in the bone by the removal of this fragment was filled by granulations; but, whether these granulations ossified could not be satisfactorily ascertained. 86. Radius and Ulna of a Dog. A portion of the middle of the shaft of the radius, in its entire thickness and with its peri- osteum, was removed ten weeks before the dog was killed. In the upper part of the bottle is the piece of bone which was thus removed. The vacant space was found filled by soft cellular tissue. The shaft of the ulna opposite to and corresponding with the vacancy in the radius, is considerably enlarged by the deposit of osseous substance beneath the periosteum.INJURIES OK BONKS AND JOINTS. 135 87. Radius and Ulna of a Dog, on which an experiment was per- formed similar to that described in No. 86; with this excep- tion, that the bone alone was removed, the periosteum being divided and separated by a scalpel from the bone, to admit of the removal of the latter from within it. The vacant space in the radius is here completely filled by newly formed osseous substance. 88. Radius and Ulna of a Dog, in which an experiment was per- formed similar to that described in No. 87, and in which the periosteum was not removed with the bone. The vacancy in the radius is here almost completely filled up by newly formed osseous substance. The ulna has become bent in the situation of the experiment upon the radius, apparently in adaptation to an abundant deposit of osseous substance beneath the periosteum of the radius. The experiment was performed by Mr. Stanley. 89. Portions of a Radius and Ulna. The radius has been fractured a little more than an inch above its carpal end. The union is firm, but there is a prominent angle on the dorsal aspect of the radius in the line of the fracture, and an elevation of new bone on the corresponding part of the palmar surface, where it is probable that the palmar margin of the upper fragment was driven into the cancellous tissue of the lower one. The tri- angular fibro-cartilage was almost completely separated from the radius. 90. Portions of a Tibia, from a case of compound fracture through the middle of its shaft. The portions of the bone, partly overlapping, partly driven into each other, are united by new bone placed between their adjacent surfaces, but not surround- ing them. 91. Portion of a Femur, exhibiting a separation of its shaft from the lower epiphysis, and a fracture extending between the condyles into the knee-joint. The violence of the injury has also occasioned the stripping up of the periosteum from the shaft of the femur to the extent of many inches; and the shaft protruded through the muscles on the inner side of the thigh.THIRD SERIES. 136 Parts of the periosteum, which were stripped from the shaft, remain attached to the condyles. A line of new bone is formed on the anterior part of the shaft, along the torn edge of that part of the periosteum, which remained attached to the shaft. From a boy aged sixteen. The injury was produced by a rope entangled round the leg. - Amputation was performed three weeks after the injury. 92. Sections of a Clavicle, exhibiting a fracture which occurred while the patient was holding a weight above his head. Con- siderable progress has been made in the reparation of the fracture, the ends of the bone being held firmly together by an osseous ring extending around them. The periosteum is in part separated, to show that this osseous ring is deposited wholly beneath the membrane. The general texture of the clavicle does not appear diseased. From a man aged sixty. He stated that he had suffered rheumatic pains in the clavicle for some time before the fracture occurred: but he was not aware of the occurrence of the fracture; and when, about two months afterwards he came under the care of a surgeon, the ring of bone around the clavicle received so diBtinct a pulsation from the subclavian artery, that it was suspected to be an aneurism. The patient died of erysipelas of the head three months after the fracture of the clavicle. 93. Portions of the Crania of two young Dogs, upon whom the operation of the trephine was performed two months before they were killed. The piece of card indicates the size of the trephine which was employed. In each instance the opening is narrowed and altered in figure. The deposit of osseous matter has taken place wholly from the edges of the opening in the bone, and in no degree from the pericranium or dura mater. The experiment was performed by Mr. Stanley. 94. Sections of a Radius. At its carpal end there has been a transverse fracture immediately above the line of the epiphysis, and the posterior or dorsal margin of the upper fragment has been driven into the cancellous tissue of the lower one. The palmar margin of the upper fragment projects forwards, or in the direction of the palm ; and the dorsal surface of the lower fragment projects far backwards, similarly to that in No. 78, but differently from that in No. 89. The fracture is united,INJURIES OF BONES AND JOINTS. 137 and a buttress of new bone has formed on the dorsal and radial sides of the displaced portions. 95. Portions of a Radius and Ulna. Both bones have been frac- tured, just above their carpal ends, in several directions both vertically and transversely, as indicated by the bristles placed in the soft substance like cartilage, by which the lines of the fracture are filled. 96. Section of the Tibia of a Dog, which was fractured a fortnight before death. New osseous substance is thinly deposited in a ring beneath the periosteum, around, and for some way above and below, the line of fracture ; but in the line of the fracture, as well as in that part of the new bone which immediately sur- rounds the fine, the osseous union is not completed ; a line of cartilage only is here seen on the surface of the section, just as in Nos. 69, 70, 71. The experiment -was performed by Mr. Stanley. 97. Portion of a Clavicle, with the upper piece of the Sternum and the First Rib, from an adult. The sternal end of the clavicle is dislocated downwards and forwards. The capsule belonging to its articulation with the sternum is torn; but the costo- clavicular ligament is entire. The first rib is separated from its cartilage. 98. Section of a Femur, in which there has been a fracture through the middle of its shaft. The section was made after softening the bone in dilute hydrochloric acid. The fracture is firmly united, with the upper portion of the bone projecting in front and on the inner side of the lower. The uniting medium consists of bone placed between the adjacent surfaces of the displaced portions of the femur; and in this new bone there are formed cancellous tissue of healthy aspect, and an outer thick wall of compact tissue. This wall of the uniting medium of new bone is connected with the surfaces of the two portions of the femur, and with the layers of compact new bone by which their me- dullary tubes, exposed by the fracture and not placed in appo- sition, are covered in. The corresponding parts of the wallsTHIRD SERIKS. 138 of the overlapping ends of the fragments are very thin, as if in that progress of absorption by which, ultimately, the cancellous tissue of the uniting medium would have become continuous with that of both portions of the broken bone. 99. Section of a Tibia, in which a compound fracture occurred six months before death. The fractured surfaces, displaced and overlapping, are consolidated by bony matter. The extremity of one of the portions of fractured bone, separated either by the fracture or by exfoliation, lies loose in a cavity between the fractured surfaces. The portion of bone at the bottom of the bottle was found loose in the same cavity. The other half of the hone is preserved dry, C. 93. 100. Section of the Head and Neck of a Femur, with the Os Innominatum of a man in whom dislocation of the femur and fracture of the acetabulum occurred fifty years before death. The dislocation was reduced ; but, soon after, the head of the bone again escaped from the acetabulum, and was not again reduced. The head and neck of the femur are altered in form ; shortened, flattened, and much increased in their vertical diameter ; and the cancellous tissue of a thick layer of the head of the femur is consolidated and hard. A new and deep osseous cavity, with very thick walls, extends from the os innominatum, as if growing out from the original acetabulum, and incloses the head and a part of the neck of the femur. The wall of bone by which this cavity is separated from that of the pelvis, and which includes the former floor of the aceta- bulum, is an inch and a quarter in thickness, and is chiefly formed, like the rest of the walls of the cavity, of hard com- pact new bone. The surface of the cavity and that of the head of the femur are covered and partially connected by fibrous tissue: they have no articular cartilage. The obturator in- ternus muscle and sciatic nerve are seen in their natural situa- tions, but are flattened in consequence of the altered form and enlargement of the surrounding parts. The patient was eighteen years old at the time of the dislocation. His limb was a little shortened, but he had good use of it.

A Hip-Joint, with the head of the Femur, and part of the acetabulum from the opposite joint, of a man who had a dis- location of the femur on the dorsum of the ilium, three years before death. The dislocation was soon reduced, and the only traces of its effects which remain are, that there is a strong band or collar of ligamentous tissue around the base of the neck of the femur at its upper part, and that a slip of the ligamentum teres is attached to the notch of the acetabulum, external to the cotyloid ligament. But with this exception, the ligamentum teres presents no sign of having been torn. Case Book, Vol. L, p. 127, No. 153. 103. Section of a Femur, in which there was an oblique fracture through the shaft near the condyles. The upper portion of the bone projects far down in front and on the inner side of the lower portion; but their adjacent surfaces are firmly united by intermediate new bone. 104. Section of a Humerus, in which a fracture of the shaft at the attachment of the deltoid muscle has been exactly united, so that both the walls and the cancellous tissue are uninterrupt- edly continuous ; and, except by a slight deviation of its axis, and a small external deposit of new bone, the situation of the fracture could hardly be discerned. 105. A Patella which has been fractured transversely, near the attachment of the ligamentum patellae. A part of the line of fracture still remains open; but in another, and smaller part, the two portions are smoothly united by firm and healthy bone. 106. Parts of two Ribs which were fractured a fortnight before death. The extremities of the fractured portions are in close contact, and are surrounded by a broad ring of callus, par-NO THIRD SERIES. tially ossified. A section of one of the ribs shows the perios- teum continued over the exterior of the callus. 107. Sections of the upper part of a Femur, from a man aged eighty- two, who was believed to have received a fracture of the neck of this bone two years before death. Presented by Walter Jones, Esq. " The history of the case is clearly that of fracture of the neck of the femur ; the appearances of the bone show that there has been a fracture which has re-united by an osseous medium ; and the direction of the fracture is such as, in my opinion, can permit no doubt that it was confined to the portion of the neck of the bone covered by synovial membrane: conse- quently, that it was wholly within the capsule. The fracture extends through the basis of the head of the bone, in the line of its junction with the neck. As in other cases of the same kind, great part of the neck of the bone has disappeared, and, in consequence, the head is proportionately nearer to the trochanter major and shaft of the bone; its re-union has in fact taken place, in part to the remaining portion of the neck, and in part to the shaft. This union is certainly osseous. In addition to the first maceration of the bone with its surround- ing soft parts, it was subsequently immersed for several days in a strong solution of carbonate of potash ; and one half of the bone has been boiled in water for three hours without the slightest yielding perceptible in the line of the fracture." Description of the specimen by Mr. Stanley, in the Mcdico-Cldrurgical Transactions, Vol. xxiv., p. 13. London, 1841. 108. Patella fractured in three lines leading from the centre to the circumference. The portions are completely and closely united by bone, and with very little displacement: the lower portion alone being pushed somewhat forwards. Some new bone is deposited along the lines of fracture on the anterior surface of the patella: the posterior surface is smooth, and presents no new bone ; the margin of one of the fractures has still the appearance of a fracture of recent occurrence. It is probable that the fracture was caused by a blow upon the patella.141 JNJURIES OF BONES AND JOINTS. 109. Portion of a Skull, in which a trephine hole, made thirty-four years hefore death, has been nearly filled up by new bone. The greater part of the new bone has been produced from the border of the aperture in the inner table. The aperture still remaining is of an irregularly oval form, about five lines long, and a line and a half wide. Its margins are sharp, and its borders shelve obliquely inwards and downwards from the sur- rounding healthy bone. It was filled up by a tough fibrous membrane. The patient, a Sergeant of Marines, was struck on the head with a tomahawk, at the taking of the Danish fleet in 1807, and was trephined in Haslar Hospital shortly afterwards by Sir Stephen Hauimick. Presented, with the history derived from the patient, by George Mantell, Esq. 110. Sections of the upper part of a Femur fractured almost vertically through the neck, at the base of the head and wholly within the capsule. The neck and the upper part of the shaft have been drawn a little upwards, and the lower part of the fractured surface and margin of the neck, has been driven tight into the cancellous tissue of the head. In this position, with- out any lateral displacement, and without any absorption of the neck of the femur, the fractured surfaces have been united by a thin layer of tough fibrous tissue, which permitted them to be slightly moved on one another. The fibrous covering of the neck appears to have been torn across and reunited in front, but to have remained entire behind. All the textures adjacent to the fracture are healthy, but the walls of the bone are thin, and its cancellous tissue atrophied and full of soft fat. The patient was a very old woman. The fracture occurred about three months before death. 111. A Knee-Joint, of which the patella was dislocated outwards, long before death, and was not reduced. The patella rests on the outer surface of the external condyle of the femur, on which, in adaptation to it, a small articular surface has been formed by a layer of very dense and polished ligamentous tissue. The tendon of the quadriceps femoris lies on the outer side of the femur, and the ligamentum patellae is directed slightly inwards as well as downwards towards the tibia, which has been rotated outwards following the displacement of the patella. All the14-2 THIRD SERIES articular cartilages have been more or less deeply removed: the surfaces of the bones are in several places exposed, hard, and polished ; and their margins are nodulated. 112. A right Shoulder-Joint, exhibiting an unreduced dislocation of the humerus of long standing. The head of the humerus, with a great part of its cartilage removed, and its articular surface hardened, rests on the anterior surface of the scapula, with a thick layer of fibrous tissue intervening between it and the bone. It is directly below, and nearly in contact with, the coracoid process, just on the inner side of the glenoid cavity, but not below its level: the axillary artery and plexus of nerves are close to it on its anterior and inner aspect. The infra- spinatus, teres minor, and sub-scapularis muscles are shown retaining their natural connexions with the head of the humerus, A part of the capsule also is shown. The glenoid cavity retains its natural form, but its articular cartilage is thin and has numerous shreds, apparently of fibrous tissue, upon it. From the same person as the preparation last described. The body was brought to the dissecting rooms, and no history of it could be obtained. 113. Sections of the Tibia of a middle-aged woman, which was fractured through the junction of its middle and lower thirds, sixteen weeks before death. The ends of the two portions overlap each other nearly an inch ; and a firm union of them is effected ■ by new bone, formed between those surfaces, which, in their overlapping, were opposed to, and partly in contact with, each other. No new bone or callus is formed at any other part. The periosteum and the tissues adjacent to the bones appeared healthy, except in having small effusions of blood in them. 114. The Femur of a Fowl, fractured obliquely through the middle of its shaft. The ends of the two portions overlapping, are firmly united by bone formed between them and upon their sides. 115. The Femur and Tibia of a Cat. A fracture of the femur near the middle of the shaft, has been united by bone formed around and between the ends of the overlapping fragments. A smallINJURIES OF BONES A>fl) JOINTS. 143 leaden bullet is fixed in the tibia near its head; a fracture in this situation is nearly united, and without displacement, by bone deposited around it. Presented by Thomas Wormald, Esq. 116. Portion of the Parietal Bone of a Child, on which a sharp piece of a chimney-pot fell from a house-roof. It made a circular aperture in the skull, half an inch in diameter, and forced the bone which was included within this circle into the brain and dura mater. Portions of the bone thus driven in remain attached to the margins of the aperture. The child remained for three weeks with scarcely any of the usual symptoms of injury of the brain. Inflammation of the brain then ensued, and soon ended fatally. 117. The Femur of a Sheep, fractured long before death through the upper part of its shaft. The fractured surfaces, though adapted to one another, have not united; but new bone is abundantly formed upon and around them. 118. A Shoulder-Joint, in which a dislocation of the Humerus occurred long before death and was not reduced. The head of the humerus rested on the anterior surface of the scapula, and on the anterior margin of the glenoid cavity, just below the coracoid process. Tough ligamentous tissue has been formed on the scapula, beneath the head of the humerus, and a new fibrous capsule surrounded it. The surface of the glenoid cavity is covered by similar fibrous tissue, and that part of the head of the humerus which was in contact with its anterior margin has been absorbed. The tendons of the biceps, supra- spinatus, infra-spinatus, teres minor, and sub-scapularis muscles are all shown retaining their proper attachments. 119. Sections of the upper part of a Femur, in which a vertical fracture occurred through the middle of the neck, within the capsule. The portion of the neck, which was connected with the shaft, is nearly absorbed; the portion connected with the head remains, and its lower margin rests, as on a ledge, on the trochanter minor and the cancellous tissue within it. TheTHIRD SERIES. ui fractured surfaces are united by a thick layer of tough fibrous tissue, permitting a slight degree of motion between them. 120. The external Condyle of a Boy's Humerus, which was com- pletely detached in a compound fracture. The fracture was repaired without the supervention of any untoward symp- toms ; and the hoy recovered a free power of rotation, and a limited power of flexion and extension, of the arm. 121. An Astragalus, which was removed by operation from a Foot dislocated ten days previously. The foot was dislocated inwards, and the astragalus, which appeared to be par- tially separated from its connections with the rest of the tarsus, was carried far forwards and outwards. The dislocation, which was a compound one, but with- out fracture of the fibula, was reduced; but extensive suppuration followed, and the astragalus, becoming again displaced and presenting itself at an external wound, was removed. Subsequently, a considerable portion of the ligaments connected with it sloughed ; but, a month after the injury, the case was making favourable progress.INJURIES OF BONES AND JOTNTS. 145 SUB-SERIES C.

The tibia has been fractured in its middle, and the fibula near its upper end. Both fractures are firmly united, but with displacement and overlapping of the fractured ends, so that the tibia at the seat of fracture forms an angle directed backwards, and the fibula an angle directed outwards. Both the bones also are atrophied, and very slender. c. 2. A Tibia, Fibula, and Astragalus. The tibia has been frac- tured at the junction of the upper and middle thirds of its shaft. Its two portions, displaced laterally, have been firmly united, and the lower portion is enlarged by abundant external deposits of new bone, in which are two apertures, such as probably led to portions of dead bone. The fibula, in adaptation to the altered form of the tibia, to which also it is united by two bridges of new bone, is bent and flattened as in rickets. The lower end of the tibia is united by bone to the astragalus and to the external malleolus. c. 3. A Tibia and Fibula. The tibia has been fractured about one third from its lower end, and the fibula near its upper end. Both fragments are firmly and smoothly united, but with a slight lateral displacement, the lower fragments converging in the interosseous space.INJURIES OF BONKS AND JOINTS. J 47 :. 4. A Femur, which has been fractured at the junction of its upper and middle thirds. The fractured ends overlap con- siderably, the upper portion lying across the front of the lower, and the lower being much rotated outwards. In this position they are firmly united by bone formed between them and at their sides, and their medullary cavity, exposed by the fracture, is covered in by smooth thin layers of com- pact bone. . .5. A Femur, which has been fractured in the middle of its shaft. The two portions overlap to the extent of between four and five inches, the upper portion lying directly in front of the lower. They are firmly united by bone formed between them and at their sides, and the greater part of the surface of this bone is continuous with the surfaces of the overlapping frag- ments. A groove along the front of the lower part of the upper portion of the femur marks the healing of a fissure. 6. A Femur, which has been fractured transversely, immediately above the trochanter minor. The upper portion has been drawn forwards and upwards, and is firmly united to the top of the shaft, forming nearly a right angle with it. 7. Sections of a Femur, which has been fractured in the middle of its shaft. The two portions overlap considerably, the upper portion lying on the inner side of the lower. The fracture is firmly united by bone placed between and at the sides of the fragments; and the sections show that this bone is composed of cancellous tissue and compact walls, which have almost completely coalesced with the cancellous tissue and walls of the portions of the femur which it unites. 8. Portions of a Femur, fractured in two places by a wheel passing over the limb. One fracture is about one third from its upper end, and the other at the same distance from its lower end. 9. Portion of a Femur, which has been fractured transversely through the middle of its shaft, and in which there is an l 2THIRD SERIES: SUB-SERIES C. extension of the fracture downwards through the lower half of the shaft and through the internal condyle. 10. Portion of a Femur, which has been fractured through the trochanter major and upper part of the shaft. The fracture extends for five inches downwards through the shaft. The two portions of the shaft, though not in contact, have been united by processes of bone extended between the adjacent margins of their walls; and the portions of the trochanter, remaining more nearly in contact, are closely united by bone. 11. Portion of a Femur, which has been fractured about three inches below the trochanter minor. The fracture was a comminuted one, and the portions of bone have been dis- placed, so that a considerable angle, projecting forwards, is formed at their union. ,12. Portion of a Femur, which has been fractured in its lower part. The fracture extends transversely through the shaft, and obliquely between the condyles into the knee-joint. The lower end of the shaft is driven in between the displaced and separated condyles. . 13. Portion of a Femur, fractured in its lower part. The fracture extends in several directions through the lower third of the shaft a little above the condyles, and downwards between the condyles into the knee-joint. Several small portions of bone were completely detached. c. 14. Portion of a Femur, fractured transversely into many small pieces, just above the condyles. From inflammation in the knee-joint, there has been deep and extensive ulceration of the articular surfaces of the condyles of the femur and the head of the tibia. c. 15. Portion of a Femur, fractured in exactly the same manner as c. 13. 16. Sections of a Femur, which has been fractured about fourINJURIES OF BONES AND JOINTS. 149 inches below its upper end. The fracture is firmly united with some displacement of the ends of the bone, and the walls and cancellous tissue of the two portions have coalesced and become continuous. . 17. Portions of a Tibia and Fibula with the Astragalus. Both the tibia and the fibula were fractured about three inches above the malleolus, and the fracture of the tibia extends downwards into the ankle-joint. The fractures are all firmly united, with little displacement, but with much thick- ening and induration of the bones, and with osseous union of the tibia and fibula, and of both of them to the astra- galus. 18. Portions of a Tibia and Fibula, the shafts of which were fractured obliquely about three inches above the ankle. The fractures have been firmly united, but with displace- ment, the lower portion of the tibia having been carried towards the fibula. 19. Section of a Femur, which has been broken about the middle of its shaft. The two portions have overlapped considera- bly, and are united in this position. The bone forming the medium of their union has a cancellous texture, with compact walls. The medullary cavity is closed at both the fractured ends of the bone. 20. A similar specimen. 21. Sections of a Tibia and Fibula. There has been a com- pound fracture of both bones about two inches above the ankle. There is a vacancy in the tibia in the situation of the fracture, from which probably a portion of bone has been removed, and at the bottom of which there is a piece of dead bone not yet separated. A portion of the fibula also has necrosed, and is partially separated. The upper and lower fragments of the tibia have not approximated, but are united by a strong bridge, or splint, of bone behind them, and there is a firm and extensive union of the tibia toTHIRD SERIES: SUB-SERIES C. the fibula, at and below the seat of fracture. The fracture of the fibula is firmly and smoothly united. 22. Portions of a Tibia and Fibula. There is a comminuted fracture of the tibia about two inches above the ankle, and two lines of fracture extend downwards into the ankle- joint. The fibula is fractured about four inches above the ankle. 23. Two Ribs which have been fractured. In one rib the frac- ture occurred near its middle, and in the other near its angle. There has been very little displacement of the ends of the bones, and the fractures are firmly and smoothly united. 24. A Humerus, which has been fractured in several directions, but chiefly obliquely downwards, just above the condyles. The fractures are firmly united, but an aperture remains in the line of one of them. . 25. Sections of a Humerus, which has been fractured obliquely just above the middle of its shaft, and has been firmly repaired. The shaft is strongly arched backwards, probably from rickets. . 26. Portion of a Humerus, in which there has been fracture of the upper part of the shaft extending to its neck. The portions have been widely .separated, and are firmly, but imperfectly, united by bridges of bone. . 27. A Scapula and Humerus. The head of the humerus appears to have been dislocated forwards, and to have remained long unreduced just beneath the coracoid process, on the anterior surface and neck of the scapula. A concave sur- face has been here formed, on which the head of the humerus rested. The pressure of the posterior part of the head of the humerus against the anterior margin of the glenoid cavity, has caused them both to be partially absorbed; and the remaining edge of the glenoid cavity, fitting in the recess1.51 INJURIES OK BONES AND JOINTS. in the head of the humerus, forms a kind of new joint be- tween them. 28. A Scapula, in which there has been a transverse fracture of the acromion through the middle. The fracture was not united by bone, but probably by fibrous tissue ; for, though it may be inferred, from the appearance of the bone, that the fracture occurred a considerable time before death, yet the portions do not seem to have moved on each other. 29. A Radius and Ulna, which have been fractured near their upper ends. The fractures are both firmly united, and a large quantity of new bone has been formed around the seats of union. The surfaces of the new bone on the radius and of that on the ulna, meeting in the interosseous space, have been roughly adapted to each other, but have not coalesced. 30. A Radius, which has been fractured near the middle of its shaft. The fracture is united with a little overlapping of the ends of the bone. 31. A Radius and Ulna. The radius has been broken about three quarters of an inch above its lower end. The fracture is united, with the lower portion of bone displaced towards the radial and dorsal aspect of the upper portion. In con- sequence of the shortening of the radius, induced by this displacement, a new articular surface has been formed on the lower end of the ulna, by the growth of a half-ring of bone upwards from the margin of the surface by which it before articulated with the radius. The carpal articular surface of the ulna thus projects far beyond that of the radius. 32. A Clavicle, which has been broken near the middle of its shaft. The fracture is united with the scapular end of the bone beneath its sternal end. 33. A Scapula, which has been broken vertically through itsTHIRD SERIES: SUB-SERIES C. infra-spinous portion, and, apparently, through the acromion. Both fractures are united by bone. 34. A Scapula and a portion of the Humerus, exhibiting the same consequences of dislocation of the head of the humerus as are shown in c. 27. 35. Portion of a Radius, which has been fractured about an inch above its lower end. The fracture has united with a con- siderable overlapping of the ends of the bone, the palmar margin of the upper portion projecting with a sharp edge towards the palm, while its posterior or dorsal margin is driven into the cancellous tissue of the lower portion. The lower portion with the carpal articular surface of the radius is consequently deflected strongly backwards, or towards the dorsal region of the fore arm. 36. The Bones of an Elbow-Joint. The humerus has been fractured obliquely between the condyles, and transversely a little above them. The fractures are firmly united, but the internal condyle is flattened and elongated. The articular surface of the ulna is adapted to this altered form of the humerus. It is uncertain whether the ulna has been broken. 37. The Bones of an Elbow-Joint. The articular surfaces of the humerus and ulna are altered in form ; that of the humerus, being narrower, and that of the ulna, deeper than is natural; but there is no appearance of their having been fractured. The radius was found dislocated from the outer condyle, and lying upon the front of the ulna. . 38. The bones of an Elbow-Joint. A fracture extends in two directions through the internal condyle of the humerus into the elbow-joint. The two portions of the condyle separated by the fracture have not been reunited by bone. . 39. Portions of a Tibia and Fibula. The point of the malleolus internus has been separated by fracture. The fibula is broken two inches above its lower end.153 INJURIES OE BONES AND JOINTS. 40. An Os Innominatum. A fracture has split the acetabulum into four portions which are widely separated. From the acetabulum, as a centre, fractures also extend through the body and ramus of the pubes ; through the ischium between its spine and tuberosity; and through the ilium, vertically to its crest, and obliquely to its anterior spine. 41. An Os Innominatum. Fracture extends in two directions through the acetabulum. The posterior wall of the aceta- bulum being separated, and held in its place by only the cotyloid ligament, permitted the head of the femur to pass upwards upon the dorsum of the ilium. 42. A Pelvis and the lower portion of a Femur, from a Boy fourteen years old. External violence has produced separation of both the sacro-iliac symphyses and of the symphysis pubis. The condyles of the femur have also been separated from the shaft at the line of their epiphytic union. 43. A Skull-Cap, in which a fracture with depression of the left parietal bone occurred many years before death. The fracture comprised a circle of bone, an inch in diameter, which was starred at its centre and surrounded by a nearly circular fissure. The fracture is united, and the depression still remains ; the centre of the depressed portion is nearly half an inch below the level of the contiguous internal sur- face of the skull. 44. A Skull, in which there have been two wounds, each about an inch and a half in length, one in the frontal, and the other in the left parietal, bone. They have both been healed. 45. A Skull-Cap, in which a fracture extending from the middle of the frontal to the posterior part of the right parietal bone has been firmly united. . A Sternum, fractured transversely through its second portion near its union with the first.THIRD SERIES: SUB.-SERIES C. 17. A Sternum, fractured transversely through its second portion near its junction with the third. 48. Sections of a Femur, in which there has been an oblique fracture of the shaft, extending from an inch below the trochanter minor. The fractured ends overlap considerably, the lower end being drawn upwards in front of the upper. A moderately firm union has taken place between the surfaces of bone which are in contact. The bones are very light. Prom a woman sixty-seven years old, who died five weeks after the occur- rence of the injury. 49. Portion of a Femur, in which there has been fracture extend- ing through the base of its neck, and obliquely through the base of the trochanter major. The fractured surfaces have firmly united, but the shaft has been drawn upwards and forwards, so that the head and neck of the femur appear much below their natural situation. In this position a bridge of bone has united the base of the head of the femur to the margin of the posterior inter-trochanteric ridge. 50. Portion of a Femur, exhibiting fracture of its neck of which no union has taken place. The neck of the bone is almost completely absorbed, and the surfaces by which the fractured portions were in contact are rough and hard. Deposits of osseous substance have taken place around the base of the head of the femur. From an old woman, in whom the fracture occurred nineteen years before death. Presented by J. H. B. Williams, Esq. . 51. Sections of a Femur, in which there has been fracture extend- ing through the base of its neck, and through its shaft between the trochanters. There is firm union of the fractured surfaces, with shortening of the neck and an apparent descent of it below its natural situation. The union has taken place with a great accumulation of bone about the lines of fracture. 52. Portion of a Femur, exhibiting fracture of its neck, of whichINJURIES OF BONES AND JOINTS. 15.", there is no union. The surfaces of the head, and of the space between the trochanters, which were in contact, are nearly smooth and very hard. Irregular osseous deposits have taken place around the fractured surface of the neck, and upon the head of the bone. 53. Sections of a Femur, in which, as in c. 49, there has been frac- ture through the base of its neck, and through the trochanter major. There is a firm union of the fractured surfaces, but with the same displacement as in c. 49. 54. Portion of a Femur, in which recent fractures extend through the base of the neck, obliquely downwards through the tro- chanter major, and transversely across the upper part of the shaft just above the trochanter minor. 55. Portion of a Femur, in which there is a fracture extending vertically through the neck, from the upper margin of the head to the middle of the lower margin of the neck. 56. Section of a Femur, in which there has been fracture extend- ing through the base of its neck, and through the base of the trochanter minor. The lower margin of the neck is impacted in the cancellous tissue between the trochanters. There is firm union of the fractured surfaces. 57- Sections of a Femur, in which there has been fracture ex- tending obliquely through the trochanter major and the base of the neck into the posterior part of the shaft. There is a firm union of the fractured surfaces, but the two portions of the trochanter major are separated to some distance from each other. The patient was a woman sixty years old. After a fall on her hip, she had signs which led to the suspicion of dislocation of the head of the femur; for the posterior portion of the fractured trochanter major, being drawn backwards towards the ischiatic notch, felt like the head of the hone. She died about three years after the accident. The case is described by Mr. Stanley, in the Medico-Cliirurgkal Transactions, Vol. xiii. p. 505, London, 1825. Case- Book, Vol.i.p. 74, No. 115. 58. The bones of a Knee-Joint. There has been a transverse156 THIRD SERIES: SUB-SERIES C. fracture through the shaft ol the femur, immediately above the condyles. The upper end of the bone, protruded down- wards into the popliteal space, has, in this position, become firmly and extensively united to the condyles. There is a complete osseous anchylosis of the patella to the femur, and of the condyles of the femur to the head of the tibia. c. 59. A Femur which has been fractured near the junction of its upper and middle thirds. The ends have overlapped, the upper portion uniting to the front of the lower, with a large accumulation of bone at their sides, from which also many pointed processes have arisen. There is a small flat growth of bone on the lower and posterior part of the shaft of the femur. c. 60. Sections of a Femur fractured near the middle of its shaft. The ends of the bone have overlapped, the upper portion uniting to the front of the lower. Strong pointed osseous growths project from the surface of the bone by which the fracture is repaired. The sections show that the bone by which the fracture is united is formed entirely between the adjacent surfaces of the overlapping portions. c. 61. Sections of a Humerus, which has been fractured rather below the middle of its shaft. The ends of the bones have over- lapped, and the lower portion is united by intermediate bone to the anterior surface of the upper one. The exposed me- dullary tube is, in both portions, smoothly covered in by a layer of compact bone. c. 62. A Radius and Ulna. The radius has been fractured at the middle of its shaft. The ends of the bone, projecting for- wards and inwards close to the ulna, have been smoothly united in this position. c. 63. Section of a Femur, which has been fractured near the middle of its shaft. The ends of the bone have overlapped; the upper portion uniting to the inside of the lower. The other section, showing the characters of the uniting medium, is pre- served in Series III. No. 98.INJURIES OF BONES AND JOINTS. Medico-Chvrurgical Transactions, Vol. xvii. p. 58. London, 1832. 64. The Bones of a Hip-Joint. A fracture extends in several directions through the os innominatum. The fracture through the bottom of the acetabulum permitted the head of the femur to sink into the cavity of the pelvis. These injuries were the effects of a fall from a considerable height. 65. The Bones of an Elbow-Joint, exhibiting a recent fracture of the lower part of the olecranon, extending to the interior of the joint. 66. Bones of an Ankle-Joint, exhibiting a double fracture of the internal malleolus, separating it from the tibia, and splitting it into two portions. 67. Portion of a Femur, in which a fracture is believed to have occurred, many years before death, through the base of its neck. The fracture (if one happened) has been completely repaired; for its direction is not indicated by any line in the cancellous texture. Presented by F. Salmon, Esq. 68. A Clavicle, which has been fractured obliquely near the middle of its shaft. The fracture has united, with scarcely any irregularity of the surface of the bone. 69. A Foot, with parts of the Tibia and Fibula, exhibiting the effects of dislocation and fracture ten months before death. The tibia is dislocated inwards, and partially separated from the fibula: the internal malleolus projects an inch on the inner side of the astragalus. The astragalus also is partially separated from the navicular bone. The fibula has been broken into several portions just above the malleolus. These portions are firmly re-united, and there is an accumulation of bone both before and behind the articulation between the tibia and the fibula. The patient was alunatic forty years old. The dislocation wasnotreduced till a month after its occurrence, and the patient's restlessness prevented the tibia from being maintained in its proper place; but he finally regained complete use and power of the foot. The case is described by Mr. Lawrence in theTHIRD SERIES: SUB-SRR1KS C. 70. A Femur, the shaft of which has been fractured very ob- liquely, from before backwards and from above downwards, a little below the trochanter minor. The fracture is firmly united, with the upper portion of the bone projecting back- wards, behind and to the outer side of the lower portion. 71. Portions of a Femur, exhibiting the union of a complicated fracture in the upper part of its shaft. The principal frac- ture appears to have extended obliquely downwards from the trochanter minor. The fracture is firmly united, the upper fragment lying in front of the lower. The cancellous texture of the bone is continuous in the united fragments. 72. Portion of a Skull, in which there has been a fracture extend- ing across the ossa nasi. The fracture has firmly united, but with lateral displacement and overlapping of the lower portions of the bones. 73. A Radius and Ulna, both of which have been fractured about three inches above their carpal ends. The ends of the bones overlapping have united in this position, with a considerable shortening and deflection towards the ulnar side. 74. A Rib which has been fractured in three distinct situations— at the angle, and in the middle of the shaft. The fractured ends are firmly united in nearly exact apposition. 75. Section of a Fibula, in which there has been a comminuted fracture about two inches above its lower end. A fragment of bone, which was separated, is firmly united to the external surface of the upper and lower portions of the shaft. The fractured ends of the shaft are not yet united; but the fragment just mentioned, being united to both, holds them together. The fracture occurred five weeks before death. 76. Portion of a Femur with the Acetabulum, exhibiting a frac- ture of the neck of the femur, which occurred fifteen years before death. The neck of the bone is absorbed. The159 IN.TUK1KS 01' HONKS A NT) JOINTS. opposite surfaces of the head and shaft, which have been in apposition, are covered by a layer of hard osseous substance. There is a considerable deposit of new bone at the bottom of the acetabulum, and upon the head of the femur. The signs of fracture of the neck of the femur were not presented till six weeks after the injury, and two weeks after the patient had begun to walk on crutches. Presented by Thomas Wormald, Esq. 77. The bones of an Elbow-Joint, exhibiting the effects of dis- location and fracture, which occurred many years before death, and which were followed by long-continued inflam- mation of the bones. The head of the radius has been dislocated forwards. The shaft of the ulna has been broken a little below the olecranon. The head of the radius, mis- shapen, elongated, and flattened, appears to have rested and moved obliquely across the front and outer part of the lower end of the shaft of the humerus. A cavity is here formed on the humerus, to which the head of the radius fits; and their opposed surfaces are covered by hard, ivory-like, polished, and perforated bone. The fractured surfaces of the ulna, not uniting, have moved freely upon each other, the upper portion resting in a deep pit on the lower. All the bones are enlarged, and the radius and ulna are united by bone abundantly formed between them and upon their surfaces. Presented by Dr. Hooper. 78. Portion of a Femur, exhibiting a depression and shortening of the neck, with flattening of the head, and formation of bone around its margin. From an aged person. It was believed, from the circumstances of the case, that the neck of the femur had been fractured in a fall; but there are no indications of a fracture having been united. Presented by Thomas Warner, Esq. 79. A Humerus and Scapula, exhibiting dislocation which occurred a considerable time before death. The head of the humerus was displaced upwards and backwards upon the dorsum of the scapula, Its anterior margin rested against the inferior surface and the outer edge of the spine of the scapula, in whichTII1KD SERIES: SUB-SERIES C. situation a hollow and partly polished surface has been formed in adaptation to it. The neck of the humerus moving upon and across the inferior half of the glenoid cavity and the adjacent part of the lower border of the scapula, their oppo- site surfaces are here accurately adapted and highly po- lished : the surface of the scapula is at this part become broad and convex, while that of the humerus is deeply hollowed out. The lower part of the glenoid cavity has disappeared, being comprised in the new joint formed with the neck of the humerus. The head of the humerus is altered in its form by the irregular deposit of bone on its surface: the upper half of the glenoid cavity also is flattened and nodulated. A fracture through the middle of the shaft of the humerus has been firmly united, but with an angle directed outwards. A cast-of this shoulder, hefore the removal of the soft parts, No. 76. 80.

Sections of a Femur, in vvliicli a fracture extends transversely through the shaft immediately below the neck. The lower portion has been drawn upwards and backwards, so that its upper end is on a level with the trochanter major : and in this position it is firmly united by bone to the back of the tro- chanter and of the base of the neck. .86. Portions of a Femur, in which there has been a fracture through the shaft, a little below the neck, with separation of the trochanter minor. The fracture, which is in almost ex- actly the same position and direction as that last described, was united by ligamentous substance which separated in maceration. The two preceding specimens were taken from a man aged thirty-nine. The fracture c. 85. occurred six years before death : the fracture c. 86. nine months before death. 87. Section of the Ossa Pubis of an adult, exhibiting a fracture of one of the descending rami, which has been firmly united, but with displacement of the fragments. 88. Portions of a Tibia and Fibula. Fractures extend in several directions, through the shaft and the articular end of the tibia, into the ankle-joint. The fibula also is fractured through the base of the malleolus. 89. A Scapula, with part of the Humerus, from a young person. Fracture extends through the body of the scapula, and through the base of the coracoid process. There is also a separation of the head from the shaft of the humerus in the line of the epiphytic union. 90. The Foot of a Child, exhibiting a partial dislocation of the astragalus from the os calcis, together with a fracture of the superior and anterior margin of the latter bone. The leg was amputated in consequence of other injuries received, together with this, in the passage of a carriage-wheel over the leg and foot. 91. Sections of a Tibia and Fibula, fractured through the middle of their shafts; the fractures are consolidated. There is alsoTHIRD SERIES: SUB-SERIES C. lateral union of the two bones, and an abundant deposit of new bone above and below the seat of fracture. 92. Parts of a Tibia and Fibula, in which a compound fracture through the middle of their shafts occurred two years before the amputation of the limb. The several portions of bone, displaced and overlapping, are firmly consolidated by osseous substance deposited between their contiguous and lateral surfaces. The small separate portion of the Tibia was found loose in the cavity of the bone by the side of which it is now placed. Besides the fractures in the central parts of the tibia and fibula, there are fractures running transversely and obliquely through the outer malleolus of the fibula, which have been united by bone. 93. Sections of a Tibia and Fibula, from a limb in which com- pound fracture occurred six months before death. The tibia is broken about one third from its upper end; and its two portions, separated to some distance from each other, are held together by new bone abundantly deposited around their external surfaces. The separate fragments of bone were found loose in the osseous cavity between the ends of the fractured portions. A small detached portion of the wall of the tibia has also been driven into the cancellous tissue of the upper part of the shaft, in which it now lies firmly im- bedded. The fibula is fractured two inches below its head; the two portions overlap each other considerably, and are united by a bridge of osseous matter extending obliquely between their lateral surfaces. :. 94. A Skull, in which there has been a comminuted fracture in the squamous portion of the right temporal bone, from which, also, a fracture extends through the meatus auditorius externus and base of the petrous portion to the base of the skull, and nearly as far as the margin of the foramen magnum. The several portions of the squamous bone which were insulated by the fracture, are firmly re-united, but with narrow intervals remaining between them: the fracture through the base is similarly united.INJURIES OP BONES AND JOINTS. ],;;; c. 95.

Portion of a Femur, in which there appears to have been a fracture extending vertically through the base of the neck. The fracture has been completely repaired; but with such a displacement of the head and neck, that they form a right angle with the shaft, and are depressed below the summit of the trochanter major. Presented by H. B. Oakes, Esq. g. 97. A Tibia and Fibula, fractured through the middle of their shafts. The fractures are firmly united, but with displace- ment of the portions, so that in each bone there is a con- siderable angle directed inwards. . 98. Portions of a Tibia, Fibula, Astragalus, and Os Calcis, from a limb in which compound fracture of the lower ends of the tibia and fibula occurred two years previous to am- putation. There is an abundant deposit of osseous substance around the fractured portions of the tibia and fibula. Two portions of bone, one belonging to the articular end of the tibia, the other comprising all that remained of the astragalus, were found loose in the cavity of the ankle-joint, and in a" deep ulcerated cavity in the lower end of the tibia. The small portion of the os calcis which remains, retains but little of the natural form of the bone. 99. An Os Innominatum, in which there appears to have been a fracture of the ramus of the ischium near the tuberosity. New bone is formed around the supposed seat of fracture. 100.

The head of the bone was found resting against the anterior border and concave surface of the scapula, close to the glenoid cavity, and below the coracoid process. A deposit of osseous substance, forming a hollow articular surface, has taken place upon the scapula in this situation. The fracture of the humerus occurred immediately below the base of its head, between it and the tuberosities, and it had been united by fibro-cartilaginous substance, which was removed in maceration. These injuries were the consequence of a fall upon the shoulder, about three months before death.

Ihe fractured surface of the head is adapted to the surface of the short portion of the neck which remains between the trochanters, and to a growth of bone proceeding from it downwards. Both the surfaces thus adapted are very hard, polished, ivory-like, and penetrated by numerous foramina. c. 100. The Bones of a Leg, exhibiting the effects of a compound165 INJURIES OF BONES AND JOINTS. fracture of both of them near the ankle, and of a simple fracture of the tibia near the knee-joint. Near the ankle, the fractured portions are irregularly united at a right angle with each other, the lower portions being turned inwards. In the lower part of the tibia there is a large irregular cavity, communicating both externally and with the joint, in which cavity several loose pieces of bone were contained. The upper part of the shaft of the fibula has not united with the lower part, but the latter is firmly fixed to the tibia. The fractured portions of the head of the tibia are firmly^ but irregularly, united. These injuries were the consequences of an accident which occurred a year before amputation. . 107. The lower extremities of the Tibia and Fibula, with the Foot of an elderly woman, exhibiting the effects of an injury which occurred several years before death. The tibia is dislocated inwards, so that only the outer half of its articular surface is in apposition with the astragalus. There has been a comminuted fracture, extending in various directions through the lower end of the fibula and the adjacent margin of the tibia. The separated portions of bone have been completely re-united. 108. Bones of a Carpus and Metacarpus. The lower head of the metacarpal bone of the thumb has a widely expanded and flattened surface, by which it articulated with a similarly deformed surface on the trapezium. It is probable that these changes were the consequences of a fracture of the metacarpal bone extending into the joint. 109. A Tibia, which was fractured very obliquely through the middle of its shaft. The fractured portions are firmly united, and so exactly, that on the posterior aspect of the bone the line of fracture is not discernible. The shaft in the neigh- bourhood of the injury is thickened, and new bone is deposited on many parts of its surface. 110. A Tibia and Fibula, which were fractured somewhat ob- liquely near the middle of their shafts. The several por-THIRD SERIES': SUB-SEIUES C. tions are firmly united, but with lateral displacement, both the upper fragments being placed on the inner side of the lower ones. The fractured ends are rounded and con- tinuous with the bonds of union. A long narrow process of bone projects from the end of the upper portion of the fibula. 111. The upper part of a Skull, with a depression of a small oval portion of the right side of the frontal bone, from a fracture received a long time before death. Both the surfaces and the margin of the depressed part are smooth; but on the inner surface are traces of a starred fracture of the inner table. 112. The upper part of a Femur, and sections of an Os Innomi- natum. On the upper part of the shaft of the femur there are no remains of the head or neck; but between the tro- chanters is a large and slightly convex surface, increased by broad flat growths of bone from its sides. The cavity of the acetabulum is nearly filled up; there remains only a slight concavity adapted to the surface between the trochanters. The notch of the acetabulum, and the space at which the vessels entered, remain distinct. The form of the osseous substance by which the acetabulum is filled up, makes it probable that it is the head of the femur which was sepa- rated, while it was still in the state of an epiphysis, and was united by bone to the walls of the acetabulum. This supposition is made more probable by the history of the case. The patient was a woman, sixty years of age, who, when she was eight year* old, bad a fall on her hip, and was believed to have fractured her thigh. Her limb was always shortened afterwards; but she had never had abscesses, or any other sign of ulcerative disease of the hip-joint. Presented by Henry James, Esq. ; 113. The upper part of a Femur, fractured at the junction of the head and neck a fortnight before death. The portion of the neck which remains attached to the shaft is much reduced in size, so that it no longer corresponds to the other fractured surface. There was no shortening or eversion of the limb in this case. The eHge of the fractured neck rested against the edge of the acetabulum.167 INJURIES OF BONES AND JOINTS. c. 114. A Femur, which sustained a comminuted fracture just below the trochanters. The fragments are united, with considerable displacement, by several short bridges of bone extending between them. The shaft of the femur is completely everted; the condyles are directed straight outwards; and the upper fractured end of the shaft lies behind the great trochanter. Presented by J. F. Crookes, Esq. .115. Portions of a Femur, which was fractured vertically through the neck, at the base of the head, a few weeks before death. The plane of fracture is irregular and the fragments were locked together : so that the principal indications of fracture were absent. .116. Portions of two Femora. The larger portion, comprising the head, neck, and upper half of the shaft of the left femur, exhibits the effects of two fractures which were produced at different times by very slight forces. The first fracture, which occurred about two inches below the lesser trochanter, is firmly united, but in such a manner that the two portions form an angle of about 75°. The second fracture happened a few days before death ; it passes transversely, but very irregularly, through the shaft of the bone. The smaller portion, consisting of a section of the right femur, exhibits an exactly similar union of a fracture like that which first occurred in the left thigh. The rest of this bone is preserved in the 1st Series, No. 92. The texture of the bones is soft, light, and spongy, and infiltrated with fatty matter. 117. The upper part of a Femur, in which a fracture extends obliquely downwards and inwards, from the middle of the great trochanter through the base of the neck, and ends just above the lesser trochanter. There is no union of the fragments; but they are held together by portions of the periosteum.

The limb directly after theTHIRD SERIES: SUB-SERIES C. fracture was shortened about half an inch, and was inverted, the toe resting on the opposite instep. It was moveable and could be everted, but, of itself, it became again inverted. Presented by Charles Miles, Esq. 118. The Humerus of a Horse, fractured in an oblique plane from one end of the shaft to the other; but, apparently, without implicating either of the articulations. The fracture is firmly united by bone placed between the apposed fractured surfaces.SERIES IV. INJURIES AND DISEASES OF THE SPINE.

Section of a spine, in which there is fracture of a dorsal verte- bra, either the third or the fourth. The front of its body is crushed between the vertebrae above and below it, and the posterior part has been driven backwards into the spinal canal, and has completely divided the chord. The spinous and articular processes of the fractured vertebrae are torn away from those of the vertebra above it, leaving a wide gap at the posterior part of the spinal column.FOURTH SERIES. Portion of a Spine, in which the articular processes of the fifth and sixth cervical vertebrae are dislocated, and the right arti- cular process and body of the sixth are broken. The inter- vertebral ligament between the fifth and sixth vertebrae is also completely torn across. The spinal chord has been divided along its middle, for the purpose of showing the soften- ing and laceration of its substance opposite the injured ver- tebrae, and especially in the line opposite the division of the intervertebral ligament. Portion of a Spine, in which there is dislocation of the articular processes of the fourth and fifth cervical vertebrae, with fracture of the lower edge of the left inferior articular process of the fourth, and a separation of the intervertebral ligaments uniting the bodies of the fourth and fifth, and of the fifth and sixth. Section of a Spine, in which there is fracture of the body of the sixth cervical vertebra. The middle and fore part of the body is crushed between the two adjacent vertebrae; and its posterior part is pressed backwards into the spinal canal, so that the spinal chord must have been nearly divided. The spinous process of the vertebra retains its natural po- sition. Presented by Henry Earle, Esq.

Portion of a Spine, in which there is complete dislocation of the bodies and articular processes of the fifth and sixth cervical vertebrae, without any fracture. 9. Portion of a Spine, in which there is dislocation of the bodies and articular processes of the fourth and fifth cervical vertebras, with fracture of the upper margin of the body, and of the arch, of the fifth. The body of the fourth vertebra projects in front of the fifth, and the membranes of the spinal chord appear tense and compressed beneath it. It is necessary to observe, that the fissures upon the arches of the vertebrae, on each side of the spinous processes, were made by the saw in opening the spinal canal. 10. Portion of a Spine, in which there is dislocation of the bodies and articular processes of the fifth and sixth cervical vertebras, with fracture of the articular processes of the fifth. The articu- lar processes of the fifth are raised up from those of the sixth, but have not passed to the front of them. The posterior part of the intervertebral ligament appears to have been deeply torn. 11. Portion of a Spine, in which there is dislocation of the bodies and articular processes of the fifth and sixth cervical vertebrae, with fracture of the body of the sixth. The right inferior arti- cular process of the fifth has passed to the front of the right superior process of the sixth; the corresponding processes on the left side more nearly retain their places, so that the upper part of the spine is twisted round towards the left side. 12. Sections of a Spine, in which there is a complete dislocation of the bodies and articular processes of the fourth and fifth cervical vertebrae, without any fracture. The fourth vertebra is carried forwards, so that the posterior margin of its body rests on the anterior margin of the body of the fifth, and the apex of its spinous process rests on the base of the spinous process of the fifth.

Portion of a Spine, in which there is a complete dislocation of the articular processes of the sixth and seventh cervical ver- tebrae, and a partial dislocation of their bodies, without any fracture. The right half of the intervertebral substance is torn through ; the left half is nearly entire. The articular pro- cesses of the sixth vertebra were raised up above those of the seventh, but had not passed to the front of them. The patient fell, from a height of ahout sixteen feet, on his head, and his neck was hent hy the weight of his body. He lost all sensibility and power of volun- tary motion in the trunk and limbs, and died on the third day after the fall. 14. Section of a Spine, with Angular Curvature. The disease is situated in the middle of the dorsal region of the spine; and large portions of the bodies of two vertebrae are destroyed by ulceration. A soft caseous matter is deposited around the diseased bone, and is so abundant in front and at the side of the spine, that it elevates the periosteum of the vertebrae and the pleura costalis in the form of a tumour within the chest. A small piece of bone is separated from the rest by ulceration, and is imbedded in the caseous matter behind the ulcerated vertebrae. The medulla spinalis, for the space of an inch and a half, is compressed in the situation of the curvature. The patient was under the care of Mr. Pott, and had paraplegia and other signs of " Pott's disease" of the spine and spinal chord. It was one of the first cases which showed the benefit of issues in the treatment of the disease; for under their influence, the paraplegia and other symptoms were completely re- moved, and the patient recovered so as to walk with ease. He died with phthisis, and a portion of one of his lungs is preserved in Series XIV. No. 6. Case-Book, Vol. i. p. 6, No. 14. 15. Section of a Spine, exhibiting disease in three of the bodies of the lower dorsal vertebrae, which was in progress towards its cure. A large portion of the anterior and lower half of the body of one vertebra has been removed, probably by ulceration like that shown in the preceding specimen. The intervertebral ligaments above and below this have also been removed: the adjacent vertebrae are approximated, so that their anteriorINJURIES AND DISEASES OF THE SPTNE. 17:; margins are nearly in contact and are partially united by bone; and there is considerable angular curvature of the spine. The remains of the body of the vertebra which is principally diseased, and the bodies of the vertebrae above and below it, are denser and harder than is natural, and are of a yellow colour. The spinal chord is curved, in correspondence with the curvature of the spine, but is not compressed. The patient was a lad seventeen years old. After signs of the disease had existed for two years he had paraplegia. Issues were made near the diseased part of the spine, and he recovered sufficiently to pursue his work as a farmer's boy. But, by a fall on his back, acute inflammation of the spinal chord, which appeared to extend to the brain, was excited ; and thus he died. Case-Book, Vol. i. p. 7, No. 15. 16. Section of a Spine, in which the bodies of two of the lower dorsal vertebrae are nearly destroyed by ulceration. Their remains are soft and crumbling, and the intervertebral substance is removed. There is a deposit of caseous matter around the diseased bone, elevating the periosteum of the bodies of the vertebras and the pleura costalis to a considerable extent above and below the chief seat of the disease. 17. Portion of the Spine of a Child, exhibiting the process of cure after such disease as is shown in the three preceding specimens. The bodies of four of the lower dorsal vertebrae are destroyed ; and the anterior parts of the bodies of the vertebrae which were immediately above and below the situation of the disease, are approximated and firmly united by bone. Together with the angular curvature thus produced, there is some lateral dis- placement of the bodies of the vertebrae ; but, by the separation of the arches of the diseased vertebrae, the spinal canal, though changed in form, appears to have retained its natural size. 18. Section of a Spine, exhibiting apparent deficiency of medulla in the cancellous texture of the bodies of three lumbar verte- brae, with ulceration commencing in their internal and posterior parts. The bones are of their natural hardness. All the other vertebrae of this spine were similarly altered. 1!'. Portion of a Spine, in which the bodies of the second and third174 FOURTH SERIES. cervical vertebra? are ulcerated. The remaining bone is softened and yellow. The odontoid process has been com- pletely separated at its base from the body of the second vertebra. 20. Section of a Spine, exhibiting disease in the dorsal and lumbar vertebrae. The disease consists in an alteration of colour in the bone, apparently from morbid secretion into the cancellous texture. Between two of the lower dorsal vertebra?, the inter- vertebral substance is completely destroyed, and the adjacent surfaces of the bodies of those vertebrae are slightly ulcerated. 21. Section of a Spine, in which the adjacent parts of the bodies of two dorsal vertebrae are altered in structure and deeply ulce- rated. A portion of the diseased bone has been separated and protruded forwards. The intervertebral substance be- tween the two diseased vertebrae is completely absorbed. An abscess has formed by the side of the diseased portion of the spine, but it has no communication with the ulcerated bone. 22. Portion of a Spine, exhibiting ulceration in the back parts or arches of the vertebrae. The left halves of the arches of the fifth, sixth, and seventh cervical vertebrae are almost completely destroyed. A portion of the ulcerated bone has become sepa- rated, and has pressed upon the spinal chord. The remain- ing portions of the bones are of their natural texture. 23. Section of a Spine, exhibiting the process of reparation after extensive disease. Twelve spinous processes are shown in the preparation, but the bodies of only four vertebras ; eight bodies, therefore, have been destroyed. The vertebrae above and below these eight have been approximated, and are firmly united by bone with their remains and with one another. An extremely acute angular curvature is thus produced; but the spinal chord has suffered no pressure; it has adapted itself to the alteration in the direction of the spinal canal. 24. Portion of a Spine, exhibiting ulceration of the posterior sur-INJURIES AND DISEASES OF THE SPINE. 17S faces of the bodies of the cervical vertebras, from the second to the fifth, and more superficial ulceration of their anterior surfaces, with deposits of new bone. 25. Portion of a Spine exhibiting ulceration, with deposit of new bone, upon the anterior surfaces of the bodies of the lower lumbar vertebrae,—such disease as often exists with lumbar abscess. 26. Portion of an Occipital Bone, with the three uppermost Cervical Vertebrae. The occipital bone and the anterior half of the atlas are firmly and completely united by bone. The second and third vertebrae are similarly anchylosed at their articular processes. These changes seem to have followed ulcerative disease, by which the odontoid process and the body of the second vertebra were changed in structure, and in part removed. 27. Portion of an Occipital Bone, with the Atlas. The atlas is united to the occipital bone by new bone formed abundantly around their articulations. The atlas is also displaced towards the left side, and its right half projecting within the foramen magnum considerably diminishes the size of the aperture. 28. Second and Third Cervical Vertebras, firmly united by bone which has been, chiefly, formed round their articulations. Part of the odontoid process has been destroyed by ulceration. 29. Second and Third Cervical Vertebrae, exhibiting a complete bony union of their bodies, articular surfaces, and spinous processes, without any displacement or change of structure. 30. A similar specimen. 31. The dorsal and lumbar portions of a Spine, from a young person, exhibiting a nearly complete destruction of the intervertebral ligaments in the whole extent of the column, with ulceration of the bodies of the vertebrae. The bodies of several of the lumbar vertebra) are completely destroyed, and an angle is here17<> FOURTH SEBIES. formed by the approximation of the upper and lower parts of the column and the projection of the spinous processes. In the dorsal vertebrae the ulceration is superficial, though the intervertebral ligaments are very deeply destroyed. The bone in progress of ulceration is not softened or otherwise changed in its apparent texture. 32. The cervical portion of a Spine, in which the second, third, fourth, and fifth vertebrae are united by bone. The bone uniting them forms a broad smooth layer covering the front surface of their bodies. Similar formations of bone are seen upon the front surfaces and margins of the sixth and seventh vertebrae, and these show that the union of each two adjacent vertebrae is effected by the growths of bone from their adja- cent margins extending over the front of the intervertebral substance, and then coalescing; for in these vertebrae the growths from their several margins have met and are adapted, but not united, to each other. 33. Portion of an Occipital Bone, with the first and second cervical vertebrae. There is a nearly complete osseous union of the two vertebrae, and the odontoid process appears to have been superficially ulcerated. The anterior arch of the atlas exhibits a line of fracture; but it does not appear probable that the anchylosis of the vertebrae was the consequence of the fracture. 34. The upper half of a Spine, in which the bodies of the fifth and sixth cervical vertebrae are completely, and those of the fourth and seventh are partially, destroyed by ulceration. The inter- vertebral ligaments between these vertebrae, as well as those between the first four dorsal vertebrae, are completely destroyed, and the bodies of the dorsal vertebrae are superficially ulcerated. There is angular curvature in the lower part of the cervical region, and the remains of one of the bodies of the vertebrae projects far into the spinal canal. From a child ten years old. There was a large collection of matter in front of the spine pressing in the pleura. Presented by J. G. Perry, Esq.INJURIES AND DISEASES OF THE SPINE. 177 35. Part of the dorsal portion of a Spine. The anterior half of the body of the seventh dorsal vertebra is almost entirely destroyed by ulceration, and the body of the sixth is deeply idcerated on its anterior surface. By the approximation and union of the sixth and eighth vertebrae, an angular curvature of the spine has been produced. A small rough process of bone has grown from the most prominent part of the angle into the spinal canal. Opposite to this projection the spinal chord was softened, and reduced in size. See Series VII. No. 7. 36. Section of a part of a Spine, including the last six dorsal and the first three lumbar vertebrae. In consequence of dis- ease, probably such ulceration as is shown in the preceding specimen, there has been a considerable loss of substance in the bodies of the last three dorsal vertebrae, and their remains have united at a very acute angle. The osseous substance in the situation of this union is hard and dense. The interverte- bral cartilages in the same situation are reduced in thickness; that between the eleventh and twelfth dorsal vertebrae is wholly removed, and that between the first and second lumbar vertebrae has yielded, so as to leave a deep gap between the bodies of those bones. The vertebral canal behind the angular curvature is not narrowed, nor is the medulla spinalis in any degree compressed, though drawn close over the angle in the front wall of the canal. From a lad, who died with lumbar abscess. 37. Section of the dorsal portion of a Spine, in which the anterior parts of the bodies of four vertebrae are ulcerated. A large portion of one of the vertebrae, including one of its interverte- bral cartilages, is destroyed, and angular curvature has been produced. The remaining osseous tissue appears healthy. The periosteum, thickened, indurated, and united with the pleura, is separated from the surfaces of the diseased vertebrae. 38. Section of the upper part of the Spine, of the Occipital Bone, and of the spinal chord, of the patient from whom the specimen last described was taken. The connections of the second N178 FOURTH SERIFS. cervical vertebra, with the first, and with the occipital bone, having been destroyed, apparently by ulceration, the anter.or portion of the first vertebra, and the basilar portion of the occipital bone have sunk down, so that the lower margin of the first vertebra is within a line of the upper margin of the inter- vertebral substance between the second and the third; and the whole of the odontoid process of the second projects straight upwards into the cavity of the skull. The medulla oblongata is thus lifted up and stretched over the apex of the odontoid process; and, as the pons holds its connection with the basilar portion of the occipital bone, the axis of the medulla oblongata forms a right angle with the axis of the spinal chord. The displaced bones are held together by the thickened and con- solidated adjacent tissues. Their texture appears indurated, but not otherwise diseased. The patient was a woman thirty-two years old. The most prominent sign of the disease, which was of four years' duration, was a constant acute pamat the back of the neck, just below the occiput. She had some difficulty of swaUowm and used to sit with her chin on her hand, or resting on her sternum. Butshe suffered no loss of sensibility, and was able to walk on the day before her dea h.

Sections of a Spine, in which it is probable that there had180 FOURTH SERIES: SUB-SERIES D, Presented by R. S. Wells, Ebq. been a fracture and dislocation of the first lumbar and the last dorsal vertebrae. The first lumbar vertebra, unchanged in texture, but deprived of the fore part of the upper margin of its body, is thrown backwards, so that its fractured anterior margin is placed under the posterior margin of the body of the twelfth dorsal vertebra. They appear as if the last dorsal vertebra, with the superior portion of the spine, had been pushed forwards and downwards, breaking off and sliding over the upper and anterior margin of the first lumbar. In this position the two vertebrae are firmly fixed by bone deposited in front of the angle formed by their bodies. At the angle thus formed the body of the first lumbar vertebra projects into the spinal canal, reducing it to a fourth of its natural diameter. A distance of an inch intervenes between the spinous processes of the last dorsal and the first lumbar vertebrae. On the right side their corresponding articular surfaces appear to have been sepa- rated and re-united by bone; on the left side the inferior articular process of the last dorsal vertebrae is wanting ; but there are appearances as if it had been united to the posterior part of the body of the displaced first lumbar vertebra: it was probably detached in the dissection. „ 5. Section of a Spine, in which there has been a comminuted fracture of the body of the first lumbar vertebra. A frag- ment of the body has been pushed backwards into the verte- bral canal, completely obliterating it. Some new bone is formed in front of the spine above and below the fracture, and holds the adjacent vertebrae together. The patient, an adult, lived about three months after the mjury. There was no paralysis of the lower limbs. D.6. Part of the Spine of a Horse, in which the bodies of two lumbar vertebra, are united by a strong thick arch of bone, extending like a bridge over the side and front of the inter- vertebral space. The portion of the intervertebral ligament beneath the bridge is absent; but there is no appearance of injury or disease of the adjacent bones. Several years before death, the horse received a severe injury of the back.181 1NJUR1KS AND DISEASES OK THE SPINE. d. 7. The base of a Skull, with the first cervical vertebra. The vertebra, displaced forwards and to the left side, is in every part, except the right half of its posterior arch, united to the occipital bone. Its projection within the foramen mag- num has considerably diminished the size of that aperture. d. 8. A Sacrum and Coccyx, firmly united by bone. The coccyx deviates considerably to the left side. d. 9. Four lower Dorsal Vertebrae, and three Ribs. They are all united by smooth layers of bone extending, like bridges, over the anterior and lateral surfaces of the bodies of the vertebrae, and thence laterally over the heads of the ribs. . 10. Sections of two Lumbar Vertebrae, in the body of one of which is an irregular circumscribed cavity, formerly the seat of abscess, or, possibly, of necrosis. The cavity opens ante- riorly, through the body of the vertebra, and posteriorly, by a wide aperture into the spinal canal. In the neighbourhood of the cavity the adjacent surfaces of the vertebrae are thick- ened, indurated, and in part united by hard new bone. New bone is also abundantly formed on the anterior surfaces of their bodies. .11. Section of a Spine, in which there has been destruction by ulceration of the bodies of six of the dorsal and lumbar ver- tebrae. The vertebrae above and below the seat of the disease have been approximated and firmly united by bone. There is an acute angular curvature of the spine, but the diameter of the canal which contained the medulla spinalis is not lessened; rather, by the extensive destruction of the bodies of the vertebrae, it is increased where the angle is most prominent. 12. Three Dorsal Vertebrae, united by bridge-like portions of bone extending between the anterior and lateral surfaces of their bodies, and forming considerable projections, like exostoses, in front of the intervertebral spaces.FOURTH SERIES: SUB-SERIES D. 13.

A Spine, Thorax, and Pelvis, from an adult woman. All the dorsal and the first two lumbar vertebrae are comprised in a lateral curve, the convexity of which is directed to the right, and backwards. There are slight compensating curves in the cervical and lower lumbar regions of the spine. The bodies of the vertebrae and intervertebral spaces are much deeper in the convexity than in the concavity of the curve; they are also twisted round, so that what were their anterior surfaces are directed outwards, towards the convexity of the curve ; this outward direction being chiefly observed in those vertebrae which are in the middle of the curve, while those at each end of it gradually approach nearer to their natural direction. Connected with this twisting of the bodies of the vertebrae, is a narrowing of the space between the spinous processes and the right transverse processes of the vertebrae, although the spinous processes are directed rather towards the left side, that is, towards the concavity of the curve. The space between the spinous and left transverse processes is somewhat increased in width and depth. The thorax projects obliquely forward, and to the left, and its sides are flattened. The posterior portions of the right ribs are directed downwards, lying nearly in contact with the vertebrae ; and then, bending abruptly round theINJURIES AND DISEASES OF THE SPINE. 183 vertebra, the ribs are directed forwards and to the left, with narrow intercostal spaces. The left ribs, crowded together in the concavity of the curve, are directed almost horizontally, first outwards, and then straight forwards ; only their extreme ends and their cartilages being directed inwards to the sternum. The sternum and anterior walls of the thorax, are arched as much as the lateral walls are in their natural state; while the lateral walls are as flat as the anterior should be. The cavity of the pelvis is of ordinary size, but its antero- posterior axis, in correspondence with the obliquity of the lumbar vertebrae, is directed obliquely, from before back- wards, and from right to left. 17. A Spine, Thorax, and Pelvis. The spine, in its dorsal region, is curved with the convexity backwards and a little to the right. The thorax, projecting very far forwards, is flattened at its sides; its transverse diameter is only five inches ; its antero-posterior diameter is eight inches and a half. The pelvis is of nearly natural form and size ; but its obliquity is somewhat lessened, and its antero-posterior dia- meter is rather diminished, while its transverse diameter is, in an equal degree, increased. 18. The Spine of an aged person, which, in its whole extent, is curved with the convexity backwards, and a little to the right. The bones are all healthy, but light. 19. The Spine and Pelvis of a young person. The spine exhi- bits three slight lateral curves; the first, in the superior dorsal region, is directed to the left; the second, in the middle dorsal region, to the right; and the third, in the inferior dorsal and superior lumbar region, to the left again. The pelvis is remarkably deformed. The internal surfaces of the ilia are unnaturally concave, and their crests are in- curved. The ischia are approximated, so that their spines are only an inch and a quarter, and their tuberosities only half an inch, apart: their ascending rami are directed almost vertically and parallel to each other, with a distance of from half to three quarters of an inch from each other: they areFOURTH SERIES: SUB-SERIES D. 184 also bent and prominent in front of the symphysis pubis. The lower part of the sacrum is abruptly turned forwards, in a horizontal plane. While the inferior aperture of the pelvis is thus narrowed, the superior is of nearly natural dimensions. A section of one of the ilia shows that its tex- ture is light, spongy, and soft. Probably the patient had rickets. d. 20. A Spine, which, in the upper part of its dorsal region, is slightly curved to the right and backwards. New bone is formed on the margins of many of the vertebrae. d. 21. A Spine and Sacrum. The spine presents two lateral curves; one in the dorsal region directed to the right, the other in the inferior dorsal and lumbar region directed to the left. The changes in the form and direction of the vertebrae are similar to those shown in d. 16, but less in degree. d, 22. A Spine and Pelvis. The spine presents two lateral curves, like those in the preceding specimen. The pelvis is of natural size and form. d. 23. A Spine, with portions of the Ribs. The spine presents slight lateral curves in its dorsal region ; the superior curve is directed to the right, the inferior to the left, and they exactly compensate each other, so that the lumbar and cer- vical portions of the spine lie in the same vertical plane. The changes of form and direction of the vertebrae are as in the preceding specimens. d. 24. A Spine and Pelvis, similar to those marked d. 16. There is considerable deposit of bone enlarging and surrounding the articular processes of those vertebras which are com- prised in the concavity of the curve ; a change which may also be observed, in various degrees, in many others of the specimens of lateral curvature. r>. 25. A Spine, Thorax, and Pelvis. The middle of the dorsal region of the spine is strongly curved towards the left andINJURIKS AM* DISEASES OK THE SPINE. 185 backwards, and there are compensating curves to the right and forwards above and below this. The description of n. 16 will almost exactly apply to this specimen, except that in this the principal curve is directed to the left, in that, to the right; and that in this, the thorax is less flattened at its sides. d. 26. A Spine, with portions of the Ribs. The spine presents three lateral curves, of which the principal one is in the lower dorsal region, and is directed to the right and back- wards. The aorta is preserved, to show its adaptation to the altered form of the spine. d. 27. The Dorsal portion of a Spine, with an acute angular cur- vature in consequence of destruction of the bodies of five vertebrae. Together with the angular curvature, there is also lateral displacement, the superior vertebras being united to the left of the inferior. The aorta, upon the altered part of the spine, forms two very acute angles; the first, where it turns to the right, in adaptation to the lateral displacement; the second, where it resumes its downward course. c. 28. The dorsal portion of a Spine, with acute angular curvature, in consequence of destruction of the bodies of three vertebra?. The aorta, upon the altered part of the spine, forms a very acute angle, which is directed backwards, in correspondence with the angle of the spine itself. d. 29. A Spine, with a very acute angular curvature, in consequence of the destruction of the bodies of the six lower dorsal vertebrae. The vertebrae above and below the seat of disease have been firmly united with the remains of the bodies of those that were ulcerated, and with one another. d. 30. A Spine, Thorax, and Pelvis. There has been ulceration of the bodies of the lumbar vertebrae, and of the sacrum in its whole extent. Four of the bodies of the lumbar vertebra; are destroyed, and an angle is formed by the approximation of the vertebrae above and below the situation of the disease ;FOURTH SERIES; STTB-SBBTES D. but their union by bone is incomplete. The thorax is depressed anteriorly, so that a space of only two inches and a half intervenes between the ensiform cartilage and the ossa pubis, and the false ribs nearly touch the crests of the ilia. All the ribs arch upwards ; and the sternum arches forwards. 31. A Sacrum and the Fifth Lumbar Vertebra. Their articular processes are united by layers of bone, extended over their anterior surfaces. 32. A Spine, with two lateral curves in its dorsal region, and one in the lumbar. The principal curve is in the superior dorsal region, and is directed to the right side. The bodies of the vertebree are thinner on the concave, than on the convex side of each curve, and there are thin growths of bone from their edges overlapping the thinner intervertebral ligaments in each of the concavities of the curves. Presented by Thomas Wormald, Esq. . 33. Part of a Spine, with portions of the Ribs. The bodies of nearly all the vertebrae are united by layers of bone de- posited on their anterior surfaces, and projecting with smooth round surfaces in front of the intervertebral spaces. Five of the ribs are similarly united, by their heads and tubercles, to the bodies and transverse processes of the vertebrae. d 34. A Spine and Pelvis. The spine presents an acute angular curvature in its dorsal region, the consequence of the destruc- tion, by ulceration, of the bodies of the last nine dorsal and the first lumbar vertebrae. Two of the ribs are united by bone to the spine. The pelvis is well formed. v. 35. A Sacrum, with the Fifth Lumbar Vertebra. Their corre- sponding articular processes on the left side are united by bone. The canal of the sacrum is open posteriorly in its whole extent. D 36. Portion of a Spine, in which the bodies of four of the lower dorsal vertebrae have been removed by ulceration. 1 heINJURIES AND DISEASES OK THE S1MNE. 187 ordinary process of cure has taken place, the vertebrae above and below the seat of the disease approximating and uniting. But, together with the angular curvature thus produced, there is a lateral deviation of the axis of the spine, the lumbar vertebrae being placed to the left of the lower dorsal. The spinous processes are removed, to show that notwithstand- ing the angle of bone projecting into the vertebral canal, the space for the medulla spinalis is here greater than either above or below. 37. The lowest two Lumbar Vertebras and the upper part of the Sacrum of a woman who died with lumbar abscess, which communicated with the spinal canal. There are deep ulcera- tions of the anterior part of the body of the fourth lumbar vertebra, and of the posterior part of the fifth. A similar ulcerated aperture in the upper part of the sacrum opens into the spinal canal. There are several irregular deposits of new bone on the front of the vertebrae and of the body of the sacrum, some of which form bridges extending from one vertebra to another. 38. Bones of the Trunk of an old woman. The dorsal portion of the spine is deeply curved backwards. The dorsal vertebrae are reduced in size anteriorly, but their texture is not distinctly altered. Between the ninth and tenth, there is a deposit of new bone. The antero-posterior diameter of the chest is augmented, and the sternum is much curved forwards, but the height and width of the chest are diminished ; the ribs anterior to the angles being nearly straight, and some of the lower intercostal spaces being almost obliterated. Several of the ribs on both sides seem to have been fractured and re- united. The left half of the pelvis is atrophied, every part of the os innominatum being reduced in size. The head of the left femur is so closely anchylosed to the acetabulum, that they seem to form one bone. The shaft of the femur, which was turned inwards at a right angle with the trunk, was broken off after death. Its tissue, as well as that of the pelvis and ribs, was soft, light, and fragile.SERIES V. INJURIES AND DISEASES OF MUSCLES, TENDONS, BURS.E, SHEATHS OF TENDONS, AND FASCIA.

Part of a Vastus Internus Femoris Muscle, with the superficial189 INJURIES AND DISEASES OF MUSCLES, &c. and deep femoral arteries. Large portions of the muscle are ossified. The largest portion of bone lies so close to the arteries, that it probably presented during life the characters of a pulsating tumour. 3. The end of the Tail of a Rat, with numerous long slender tendons attached to it, which, it is probable, were pulled out with small pieces of their muscles, in the attempts which the animal made to escape, when its tail had been caught in a trap. 4. The Tendon, with part of the muscular fibres, of the Flexor Longus Pollicis, which were torn out from a man's arm. The patient was a butcher, whose thumb was caught by a meat-hook, on which he remained suspended till the muscle gave way. He recovered quickly from the injury. 5. Parts of the bones of a Middle Finger, with the tendon and some of the muscular fibres of their portion of the extensor muscle, dried. They were torn away from their connections by the explosion of a gun while the patient's hand was resting on the muzzle. Presented by Henry Bateman, Esq. 6. Sections of a Rectus Femoris Muscle, in which are several large lobulated and circumscribed masses of a soft flocculent me- dullary substance. The muscular fasciculi are separated by the morbid growths, but appear of healthy texture. A large medullary tumour from the axilla of the same patient, is preserved in Series XXXV. 7. Portions of a Longissimus Dorsi Muscle, in which are specimens of the Cysticercus Cellulosae (Rudolphi). The cysts are placed in the cellular tissue connecting the muscular fasciculi. In the upper portion of the muscle are two cysts, from which the cysticerci lying loose in the bottle were removed; in the lower portion the cysticercus is attached to the interior of its cyst. These specimens were taken from the body of an old man, in many of whose voluntary muscles similar cntozoa existed.190 FIFTH SERIFS. 8. Portions of Muscle and Liver, from a Pig, in which are numerous cysts, like those in the preceding specimen, and probably, like them, containing cysticerci. 0 9. The upper portion of a Humerus, with part of the long tendon of the Biceps muscle. The tendon has passed out of its groove and is confined to the adjacent part of the humerus by a tough membranous sheath, formed apparently by condensed fibro- cellular tissue. The tendon was attached to the margin of the glenoid cavity in the usual manner. 10. Portion of a Humerus, with the long tendon of the biceps muscle, which, having been separated from its attachment to the scapula, has become fixed to the lesser tuberosity of the humerus. 11. A similar specimen. Both these humeri present indications of having been the seat of chronic rheumatism. 12. A Shoulder-Joint, exhibiting an enlargement of the bursa be- tween the deltoid muscle and the capsule. The lining of the bursa is smooth, like the surface of a mucous membrane. At the bottom of the bottle are numerous flat oval bodies, of moderately firm consistence, which were contained in the enlarged bursa. 13. Two enlarged Bursse, removed with the integuments from over the Patellge of the same person. The walls of both the bursae are thick, tough, and laminated, and cords are attached by one or both extremities to their internal surfaces. 14. A similar Specimen. The cyst is larger than either of the preceding, and was distended by a honey-like fluid. 15. A similar Specimen removed after death with the patella and other parts. The enlarged bursa is laid open from the front, showing its interior traversed by numerous slender tendinous cords, from some of which lobulated growths are suspended.INJURIES AND DISEASES OF MUSCLES, &c. 1.91 16. An enlarged Bursa, removed with the integuments from the front of a Patella. The walls of the bursa are between two and three ljnes in thickness, tough, fibrous and laminated, and its cavity was nearly filled by a substance like fibrine or imperfect false membrane, some of which is still attached to its internal surface. 17. Sections of a diseased Bursa, which was removed from the front of a Patella. In consequence of long standing disease, its walls have become from one to four lines in thick- ness, and very hard, tough, and coarsely fibrous. Its internal surface is irregular, and its cavity was filled by a small quantity of yellow fluid, in which the small white bodies, now lying at the bottom of the bottle, were contained. Most of these bodies are hollow, their walls being formed by a soft white substance. v 18. Two Bursse, which were removed from the anterior surfaces of the Patella of the same person. In each specimen the cavity of the bursa is almost completely obliterated by the formation of a firm fleshy substance in it, thickening its walls. 19. Part of a Hand and Fore-Arm, in which the sheaths of the extensor tendons of the finger and thumb have been greatly enlarged by the accumulation of fluid containing small cysts. The diseased sheaths are laid open; and one of them is shown extending up half the fore-arm. The walls of the sheaths are thickened; their internal surfaces, in many parts, granular, or like mucous membrane. The partitions between some of them appear to have been absorbed, so that several form one cavity. 20. A collection of numerous small, round, and oval Cysts, with soft pale walls, which were found in the diseased sheaths of tendons last described. They floated in an opaque, yellow, and moderately thick fluid. 21. A collection of Cysts, like those last described, but rather larger and with thinner walls, which were removed from the bursaFIFTH SERIES 192 beneath the annular ligament of the fore-arm of a young woman.

Portion of Dura Mater, exhibiting a newly formed membrane upon its internal surface. This membrane lines the whole of the dura mater covering the right hemisphere of the cerebrum ; its thickness is about equal to that of the peritoneum, and it is very vascular throughout: it has been completely separated from the dura mater, except along one edge, where it is still adherent; and it will be observed that this edge is insensibly lost upon the dura mater, so that the internal surface of the new mem- brane, and that of the dura mater, appear to be continuous. The outer surface of the membrane is rust-coloured, like par- tially decolorized blood. Towards its lower part, the new membrane is thicker than above, and it is here divisible into two distinct layers. The patient had been deranged for three years before his death. He had bad no signs of inflammation of the membranes of the brain, but, shortly before Ins death, had hemiplegia of the left side. The arachnoid beneath this layer of mem- brane'was thickened. Case-Book, Vol. i. p. 7, No. 16. 2 Portion of Brain with its Membranes, exhibiting the same changes as the preceding specimen. The new membrane occupies an extent of some inches over the right hemisphere of the cerebrum ; it adheres firmly to the internal surface of the dura mater, and appears vascular. The patient had suffered for many years with disease of the urinary organs. He died with fever attended by pain in the head and delmum. Case-Book, Vol. i. p. 8, No. 17. 3 A Specimen of the same disease as Nos. 1 and 2. The nw membrane is here very thick and compact, and has the same rusty colour as No. 1 : it has been partially separated from the dura mater, to which it was firmly adherent. 4. Portions of Dura Mater and Pia Mater. Blood and lymph areINJURIES AND DISEASES OF THE BRAIN, &c. i95 copiously effused upon the external surface of the dura mater. The pia mater is thickened, opaque, and indurated, both in that part which covers the external surface of the brain, and in that which penetrates between the convolutions. These changes were consequent on external injury. 5. Portion of Dura Mater, thickened and indurated, with deposit of lymph upon its internal surface. The dura mater is from a line to a line and a half in thickness, and has a tough laminated texture. 6. Portion of a Frontal Bone, with the subjacent Dura Mater. A tumour, with a coarsely nodulated surface, proceeding appa- rently from the outer surface of the dura mater, has, by its growth, caused the absorption of the bone, and has protruded through it. A portion of the tumour also is lodged between the skull and the dura mater, and projects inwards upon the anterior and upper part of the brain. 7. Portion of Dura Mater, with recent deposits of lymph upon both its surfaces. 8. Portion of Skull, with the Dura Mater, exhibiting the growth of small, flat, fleshy tumours from both the surfaces of the latter. The tumours arising from the external surface of the dura mater have caused the absorption of the bone in some situations, so that they appear on the outside of the skull The skull is considerably thickened, and the diploe appears consolidated. 9.

The surface of the clot is closely united to the substance of the brain, which also appears more smooth than that immediately surrounding the clots in the preceding spe- cimens. 12. Portions of Cerebrum, in the substance of which are the two parts of a cavity which contained a serous fluid, and which was, probably, formed by the complete removal of an apoplectic effusion, such as is shown in earlier stages in the preceding specimens. The form of the cavity is irregular, but its interior is smooth, and the adjacent substance of the brain appears healthy. The patient was forty years old, and had an apoplectic attack about four months before his death. Case-Book, Vol. i., p. 8, No. 19. 13.

He died with hemorrhage on the twelfth day. Case-Book, Vol. i. p. 10, No. 22. 32. Portions of Brain, Skull, and Cerebral Membranes, exhibiting a Hernia Cerebri. The front of the preparation shows a vertical section of the protrusion and of the part of the brain from which it has arisen. In the centre of the protruded brain, which consists of medullary substance, the vessels have given way and blood is effused in it. The portions of the skull and of the membranes of the brain surrounding the base of the protrusion, were included in the section, for the purpose of showing how the protrusion has taken place through the openings formed by ulceration in the dura mater and pia mater, and through the aperture in the bone. 33. Section of the protruded Brain last described. The deep groove which intervenes between the outer part of the pro- truded mass and the portion of brain from which it has arisen, was occupied by the bone and by the membranes of the brain. The patient, a hoy thirteen years old, had extensive fracture of the frontal bone, and several portions of hone were removed without injury of the dura mater. The protrusion of the brain began on the fifth day after the injury, and increased, without disturbance of the intellect or other remarkable symptoms, till the tenth day, when the protruded mass, consisting of healthy cortical and medullary substance, was cut off. For the next ten days the protrusion was rcstnuned by firm pressure; but, insensibility ensuing, the pressure was discon- tinued : the protrusion at once again made progress, and the patient died on the twenty-seventh day after receiving the injury, with softening of the brain The case is published by Mr. Stanley, in the Medico-Cldrurgkal Tra?isaetions, Vol. vni. p. 22, London, 1817.

Portion of Cerebrum, with a small, conical, bone-like tumour, which, apparently originating in the pia mater, has penetrated between the convolutions into the substance of the brain. 38. A large Clot of Blood adhering to the internal surface of the dura mater, which covered the upper part of one of the hemi- spheres of the cerebrum. The effusion was the consequence of external injury. 39. A large Clot of Blood between the dura mater and the lateral part of a Skull. The blood was effused from the Arteria meningea media, which was ruptured by external violence. 40. Portions of a young person's Brain, in the substance of which there are several masses of firm, yellowish, tuberculous matter. One of these masses occupies the greater part of the interior of the tuber annulare. 41. Portion of Cerebrum, exhibiting the septum lucidum stretched in consequence of the distension of the lateral ventricles with fluid. In the anterior portion of the septum there is a large irregular opening traversed by thin shreds; and the posterior portion of the septum which remains is very thin. 42. A similar specimen, except that the opening is in the posterior201 INJURIES AND DISEASES OF THE BRAIN, &c. portion of the septum lucidum, and has smoother and more even edges. 43. Portion of Cerebrum, with a small tumour which was imbedded between its convolutions. The tumour is nodulated on its surface, and is composed of a firm substance; it was con- nected with the brain only by the pia mater and arachnoid membrane. 44. Portion of Cerebrum, with an aneurism of the middle cerebral artery about an inch from its origin. The sac of the aneurism is filled by dark, firm, laminated coagulum ; its walls appa- rently consist, in the greater part of their extent, of the dilated coats of the artery. The arteries with which the aneurism is connected are larger and thicker than is natural. The patient was a man forty-five years old. About two years before his death, he had an apoplectic attack. After this he had several slighter attacks, and was hemiplegic, though gradually recovering, to the time of his last illness ; in which illness he had obscure signs of gastric disease, then became drowsy, and at last insensible, and died in a state of great exhaustion. The vertebral artery, after death, was found irregularly enlarged into pouches. The canal of the middle cerebral artery was pervious, the aneurismal dilatation affecting chiefly the inferior portion of its walls. Case-Book, Vol. i. p. 37, No. 72. 45. Portion of Dura Mater, exhibiting a newly-formed, thin, and nearly transparent membrane, closely adherent to its internal surface, and consisting of two layers which form a large sac containing coagulated blood. The patient was a young man who had an attack of apoplexy, followed by paralysis of the right side and occasional convulsions, a short time before death. The effusion of blood compressed the right side of the brain. Case-Book Vol. i. p. 39, No. 75. 46. Portion of Dura Mater, exhibiting a mass of bone-like sub- stance, of low conical form, attached to the side of the falx cerebri. The patient, twenty-eight years old, had from boyhood been subject to severe head-aches. A fortnight before he died, he had an acute head-ache, aggravated in paroxysms, with vomiting and slow pulse, which in a few days were succeeded by delirium and fever, and then by partial paralysis and insensibility. Copious effusions of scrum and lymph were found, after death, in the cerebralmembranea and ventricles. Case-Book, Vol. i. p. 21, No. 49. Presented by Herbert Evans, Esq.SIXTH SERIES. •202 17. Portion of Cerebrum, exhibiting an abscess in the upper part of one of its hemispheres, with the dura mater which covered it. The abscess communicates with the lateral ventricle by the aperture through which a bristle is passed. The internal surface of the abscess is rough, and that of the ventricle is lined by lymph. Lymph is also deposited upon the dura mater, and there is an ulcerated aperture in it, which commu- nicated with the cavity of the abscess, and through which a bristle is passed. The patient, a child four years old, had an extensive scalp-wound of the right side, followed hy suppuration, sloughing, and exposure of the cranium. A month after the injury was received, and while all seemed proceeding favourably, the child was seized with convulsions, which were followed by partial paralysis and insensibility. By the trephine, a small quantity of matter was let out from between the skull and dura mater, but without relief; and the child died three days after the convulsions began.

Portion of the posterior and upper part of a Skull, with the-20 I SIXTH SERIES. subjacent Dura Mater. There is a large aperture formed by ulceration through the skull and the dura mater, both above and below the tentorium cerebelli. The edges of the ulcer, both in the bone and in the dura mater, are covered by granu- lations. From a woman fifty years old. The disease commenced with what was regarded as carcinoma of the scalp, which, having passed into the stage of ulce- ration, slowly spread through the skull and dura mater to the brain. Case-Book, Vol. i. p. 176. No. 200. 58. Frontal Bone, with the subjacent Dura Mater. Several soft medullary tumours have been formed on the external surface of the dura mater. Many of them are imbedded in the skull; and one, of large size, having produced the complete absorp- tion of the bone, has passed to the outside of the skull, where it is connected with a similar large mass between the bone and the pericranium. The bone itself is of very dense texture. 59. Two middle Cerebral Arteries, from the same patient. The trunk of that of the right side is partially dilated into a small bilobed aneurismal sac, which is nearly filled by a coagulum of pale fibrine. The trunk of the left artery is ruptured, at a point nearly corresponding to that from which the aneurism has arisen on the opposite side. The rupture, into which a bristle is passed, extends through all the coats of the artery, and in an irregular line round more than half its wall. There are several small deposits of fatty substance in the walls of the arteries. From a woman eighty-four years old, who died twenty-two hours after an attack of apoplexy. A copious effusion of blood had taken place from the rup- tured artery, into the substance and membranes of the base of the brain. Case- Book, Vol. i. p. 178. No. 202. 60. The right half of a Cerebrum. In its centre there is a cavity, in which a large acephalocyst hydatid was contained. The cavity is lined by a thin false membrane. It is much reduced in size by the contraction of the brain : the apertures in it were made after death. The adjacent cerebral substance is healthy.INJURIES AND DISEASES OF THE BRAIN, &c. 205 61. The Acephalocyst Hydatid from the preceding brain. When full, it contained between five and six ounces of fluid. From a girl, five years old, in whom signs of cerebral disease had existed for a year before death. For the last three months of her life, she had partial paralysis of motion on the left side. The substance of the brain around the hydatid, as well as in every other part, was healthy. Case-Book, Vol. i. p. 156. No. 182. 62. Portions of Brain, in which there are small circumscribed Medullary Tumours. The tumours are round, slightly nodu- lar, moderately firm, and, on their cut surfaces, appear granu- lar, with a mixture of a few radiating fibres. One of them is suspended separately. The adjacent cerebral substance appears healthy. There were many similar tumours in different parts of the brain, but chiefly on its surface. The patient was an elderly woman, who had suffered long with obscure cerebral symptoms. 63. A portion of Dura Mater, of which all that part which co- vered the upper surface of the left cerebral hemisphere was thickened. In some situations it is nearly half an inch thick, and its substance throughout is hard, and tough, and appears irregularly laminated. From a man who, eleven years before death, had a violent blow, by which it was supposed that his skull was fractured. The same patient's skull is preserved in Sub-series A. 49; his eye in Series IX. 17, 20 ; and his heart in Series XII. 60. 64. Part of the Brain of a Man twenty-eight years old, who had Hydrocephalus in his infancy, and whose head was enlarged and somewhat deformed in consequence of that disease. The whole of the internal surface of the ventricles is finely granu- lated, and appeared to be indurated. The inferior surface of the edges of the fornix is intimately adherent to the surface of the choroid plexus, and, through its medium, to the upper surface of the optic thalami. The mind of the patient appeared in no degree affected by this disease: he was a very skilful furniture-painter; and died of a disease independent of the state of his brain. 65. A Section of a Cerebellum and Pons, with a clot of blood recently effused in the middle of the Pons. The effusion appeared to be the cause of sudden death in a person who was already hcmiplcgic, from a former attack of apoplexy.206 SIXTH SERIES. 66. The Cyst of a large circumscribed Abscess, removed froin one of the middle lobes of a cerebrum. Its internal surface is smooth, and lined by lymph, of which some has been turned off in a layer; its external surface is covered by shreds and flocculi from the adjacent cerebral substance; its walls are moderately tough and about half a line in thickness. The patient was a middle-aged man, and had had only some slight and ohscure signs of disease of the brain. 67. A left middle Cerebral Artery, with a small aneurism on one side of its trunk. The aneurism lay very deep in the fissura Sylvii, nearly imbedded in the adjacent cerebral convolutions, and it burst into the substance of the brain by the irregular rent which is indicated by the bristle. A part of its cavity is filled by a firm decolorized layer of coagulated blood. 68. A Clot of Blood, weighing between four and five ounces, which was effused from the aneurism last described into the substance of the left hemisphere of the cerebrum. The patient was a footman thirty-eight years old. He had suffered from occa- sional giddiness, ringing in the ears, and other slight signs of disease of the brain ; and had enlargement, with disease of the valves, of the heart; but he had been engaged in his work till the day before his death, when, while leaning over the side of his bed, he suddenly became insensible, and in a few minutes died. There is a drawing of the brain with the clot in its recent state. 69. The Brain of a giddy Sheep, with part of its skull, and an Hydatid (Ccenurus cerebralis) which was contained in the left cerebral hemisphere. The greater part of the substance of the hemisphere has been removed or distended around the hydatid, and the whole thickness of the superjacent portion of the skull is in several places absorbed. 70. An Hydatid (Ccenurus cerebralis) from the Brain of a giddy Sheep. Minute white pearly bodies are attached in groups to many parts of the interior of the cyst. 71. Part of the Parietal Bone of an Infant, with Internal Cephalhe- matoma, i.e. an effusion of blood between the skull and dura mater. This effusion, as well as a similar effusion between the skull and the pericranium, appeared to have proceeded (atINJURIES AND DISEASES OF THE BRAIN, &c. •207 least in part) from a fissure, about an inch long, through the parietal bone, at the margin of the effusion. The blood forms a circumscribed oval layer, about half an inch thick, and is coagulated. Thin plates of porous new bone have been formed in the dura mater around part of the margin elevated by the effused blood, as well as in distinct patches nearer to the centre of the part thus elevated. The bone appears to be formed between the two layers of the dura mater: a portion of the inner layer is reflected from the surface of the new bone over which it lay, and is indicated by a bristle. A small quantity of new bone is also formed on the inner surface of the skull, near the margin of the effused blood : but there is no appear- ance of any being formed beneath the blood. The infant was twenty-five days old, when it died with convulsions, which had commenced two days before its death. Previous to these it had been healthy, with the exception of a slight diarrhoea. The case is related by Dr. West, and the preparation is engraved, in the Medico-Chirurgical Transactions, Vol. xxviii. p. 397, London, 1845. Presented by Dr. West. 72. A Cerebellum, on the upper surface of which an irregularly oval mass of tubercle, rather more than an inch in diameter, is deeply imbedded. The mass was connected with the inferior surface of the tentorium cerebelli, and has been in part detached from the cerebellum, to which it was very loosely attached: it presents a few scattered points of softening.

Skull of a Child about ten years old. The sagittal suture and the middle portions of the coronal and lambdoidal sutures are open. The parietal, and the upper portions of the frontal and occipital, bones are much larger than is natural, and very thin and light; and the inferior occipital fossae bulge out in large rounded prominences. The principal enlargement of the skull is in its posterior part. e. 2. Skull of a Girl eleven years old. The enlargement of the skull in consequence of hydrocephalus is effected by its elon- gation, and by the depression and hollowing of its base. An increase of width appears to have been prevented by the pre- mature and complete closure of the sagittal suture. The coronal suture, and that between the frontal bone and the lesser alee of the sphenoid, are wide open. The superior walls of the orbits are pressed downwards. The bones, generally, are thin and light; and in many parts of the inner table are deep depressions and foramina.SERIES VII.

The tumour consists throughout of a soft whitish me-DISEASES OF THE EYE AND ITS APPENDAGES. 217 dullary substance, with blotches of effused blood. The eye and optic nerve are imbedded in the centre of the tumour, and are themselves so filled with medullary substance, that no portion of the natural structure of the eye, except the sclerotica, can be distinguished. 5. An Eye, from which all the natural structures have disappeared, giving place to a mass of whitish medullary matter. The recti muscles are connected with the upper part of this mass. The skull of the same patient, a young person, is preserved in Series XXXV. 6. Section of a Tumour, which was removed with the Eye of an adult. The tumour consists of a mass of soft, greyish, and, apparently, medullary substance, some of which is within the globe, but the greater part, having protruded through the sclerotica, has enlarged and extended round the exterior of the globe. Portions of the choroid membrane and retina may be discerned, apparently unchanged. The retina is reflected over that part of the tumour which is within the globe, indicating that the tumour grew between the retina and choroid. The woman from whom this specimen was taken, lived for nineteen years after the operation, and the disease did not return. Part of her skull is No. 14 in this Series. ' 7. Sections of a large lobulated Tumour, which was removed from the cavity of the left orbit of an adult; with a portion of Brain, from the same individual. To the upper part of the sections of the tumour is attached the posterior half of the eye-ball: this is filled by a substance similar to that of the tumour, so that it may be assumed that the tumour began to grow within the eye and protruded through its anterior part. The tumour is, throughout, soft and brain-like in its texture; parts of it are nearly white, and parts are intensely black. It appears also to have been very vascular. In the lower part of the bottle is a portion of the tumour which was extracted from the back part of the orbit: it consists of the same substance as that already described. The optic nerves are connected with the portion of brain; the left nerve has some of the medullary and melanotic•218 NINTH SERIES. substance attached to it: it is reduced in size as far as the commissure ; but beyond this, no change is visible in it. Tho patient was an unhealthy man sixty-five years old. The disease had existed about twelve months. He died ten days after the extirpation of the eye : and melanotic disease was found in the liver, sections of which are preserved in Series XVIII. No. 23. The case is related by Mr. Lawrence in his " Treatise on the Diseases of the Eye :" London, 1844, 8vo. p. 720. 8. Sections of an Eye, from an adult. The globe is filled by a soft medullary and melanotic substance, of mingled shades of dusky grey and black, which has also protruded the back part of the sclerotica, forming a nodulated elevation by the side of the optic nerve. The optic nerve is reduced in size, but appears otherwise sound: the lens and iris are pressed against the cornea. The patient was a man thirty years old, and the disease had been about two years in progress : the globe was slightly enlarged by the growth within it. A year after the extirpation of the eye, the patient was in good health. The case is related by Mr. Lawrence in his " Treatise on the Diseases of the Eye :" London, 1844, 8vo. p. 719. 9. A left Eye, in which there is a large ulcerated aperture in the middle of the Cornea. The pupillary margin of the iris was adherent to this aperture, and is thickened, and appears ragged, by the lymph deposited upon it. The patient was forty years old, and had a tumour in the left side of the pons, which compressed the origins of the fifth and facial nerves on the same side. Some signs of this tumour had existed for more than a year. She lost sensation and motion on the left side of the face, and motion in the left arm and leg. The hearing and taste were lost on the left side : she was subject to repeated attacks of erysipelatous inflammation of the same side of the face: the left side of the interior of the nose was very vascular, and often discharged blood; and this ulceration of the cornea ensued, in the course of rapidly destructive disease of the eye. The case is related by Mr. Stanley, in the London Medical Gazette, Vol. i. p. 531, 1828. Case-Book, Vol. i. p. 123, No. 146. 10. Sections of an Eye, from an adult. The retina has disappeared, and its place is occupied by a thick layer of dense osseous substance. 11. A Lachrymal Gland, of natural size and structure, which, pro- truding from the orbit so as to be felt through the eye-lid, was removed by operation.DISEASES OF THE EYE AND ITS APPENDAGES. 21.9 12. Sections of a Tumour, which was removed from the cavity of the orbit, with the eye and the optic nerve. The tumour ad- heres to the back part and sides of the sclerotica; and the optic nerve, elongated, passes through its axis. The tumour is lobulated, firm, and compact, and it was of a light yellow colour. The recti muscles, unaltered, adhere to it externally. The eye was protruded from the orbit. The humours have escaped through an ulcerated aperture in the cornea. The sclerotica is natural. The retina and the choroid membrane are collapsed, and occupy the axis of the eye between the entrance of the optic nerve and the iris. The space thus left between the choroid and the sclerotica is occupied by a firm clot of blood : and blood is effused in the optic nerve. 13. A Mass of flattened oval form, and upwards of an inch in diameter, which was removed from an orbit. It apparently consists of the lachrymal gland enlarged and changed in struc- ture : its texture is firm: its cut surface is granulated, and intersected by white lines. The patient was a gentleman twenty-seven years old. The disease commenced five years before the removal of the disease. In a year and a half from its com- mencement the globe began to be protruded, and in three years, with increased displacement of the globe, the sight became impaired, and was at length totally lost. After the removal of the disease, the eye returned to its position, the patient completely recovered his sight, and remained well. The case is related by Mr. Lawrence, loc. cit. p. 802. 14. Portion of the Skull of the Patient, whose left Eye, extirpated nineteen years before death, is preserved in No. 6. The left orbit has undergone no change in either form or size. 15. Sections of an Eye, with a large mass of soft pale medullary substance which filled the orbit. The eye and the optic nerve have undergone no change of structure, but are compressed by the morbid growth, which is closely attached to the posterior part of the sclerotica, and appears to have been wholly external to the eye. This specimen was removed from an old woman. After the healing of the wound there was a reproduction of the morbid growth. 16. Portion of an Eye, which was removed in a case of Staphyloma.NINTH SERIES. •220 The whole of the substance taken away projected beyond the sclerotica; it consists of a pale firm mass, in the middle of which is the thickened cornea. Upon its internal surface are some remains of the iris with its black pigment. 17. An Eye, which was removed on account of carcinomatous disease, from a middle-aged man. The tissues of the anterior and inferior third of the eye are occupied by an irregular growth of firm and very vascular substance, with a granulated, warty, and vascular surface. The optic nerve, of which a portion is pre- served, is sound. There was no return of disease in the orbit; but the patient died with medullary tumours in the heart, and in some other parts, two years after the extirpation of the eye. His skull is preserved in Sub-series A. No. 49; part of his dura mater in Series VI. No. 63 ; his optic nerve in this Series, No. 20; and his heart in Series XII. No. 60. 18. Sections of an Eye, of which the Globe is almost completely filled by a mass of medullary and melanotic substance. The diseased growth appears to have originated between the choroid membrane and the retina. The former still surrounds it; the latter, entire but pressed to one side of the eye, is exhibited in the upper part of the preparation. The lens is pressed forwards into contact with the inner surface of the cornea ; the iris forms a narrow ring around its margin. At the back of the preparation are seen two considerable staphylomatous projections of the sclerotica, which, before the removal of the eye, were observable at the lower and outer part of the front of the globe. The patient was a girl twenty years old. The disease had existed more than six months, and for three months its progress had been attended by extreme pain. She remained well for three years after the operation. Then, melanotic disease was developed in the liver, heart, and many other parts; but the disease did not return in the orbit. A cast of the liver is preserved : a portion of her heart is in Series XII. No. 41; and her pancreas in Series XXI. No. 4. The case is related by Mr. Lawrence in a Clinical Lecture in the London Medical Gazette, Vol. xxxvi. p. 961, London, 1845. Case-Book, Vol. i. p. 150, No. 174. 19. An Eye, with which a large Brain-like Tumour is connected. The tumour has protruded to a considerable distance through the eye-lids, which it has completely inverted and pushed back into the orbit. Its anterior part is covered with shreds of soft sloughing tissue. The eye is filled with the diseased structure,•2-21 DISEASES OF THE EYE AND ITS APPENDAGES. but the sclerotica is shrivelled and contracted. The optic nerve is sound. The part9 were removed after death. The disease had existed for more than two years, and was associated with similar growths in the scalp and bones of the skull. Case-Book, Vol. i. p. 153, No. 178. Presented by Martin Ware, Esq. 20. The Eye-lids, the remains of the optic nerve, and the other contents of the orbit, from which the Eye No. 17 was removed. The optic nerve terminates by a blunt, but not bulbous, ex- tremity, which is firmly adherent to the surrounding tissues. The eye-lids, muscles, and all the other parts are atrophied and contracted. 21. The Eye-ball of an Ox, in the anterior part of which is a Tumour with hair growing from it. The tumour, which ap- peared to be composed of fat and condensed cellular tissue covered by skin, grew from the outer half of the cornea and sclerotica. The conjunctiva appeared to be lost in the integu- ment which enveloped the tumour. Long hairs, with true bulbs, grew from the skin on the surface of the tumour. The cornea, where not covered by the diseased growth, was trans- parent and of its natural thickness and structure : the iris and lens were likewise healthy. 22. The remains of the Optic Nerve, with some of the surround- ing tissues, from the patient whose eye is described in No. 18. The sheath of the optic nerve is laid open, displaying the nerve contracted within it, pale and shrivelled, and with no bulbous enlargement at its extremity. 23. Sections of an Eye, with its Globe nearly filled by a medullary and melanotic growth, which also protrudes through the upper and anterior part of the sclerotica, and forms, external to the eye, a mass larger than the eye itself. The part of the tumour within the eye is nearly black : that which is external to it is white, variously shaded with grey and black. 24. Part of the Base of the Brain, from the patient from whom the'22'2 NINTH SERIES. eye last described was extirpated. An oval mass of soft, dark- grey, medullary and melanotic substance, (like that external to the eye,) is imbedded on the surface of the brain, and com- presses the optic commissure, the left optic nerve, and the left carotid artery. It is loosely connected with the brain ; and the adjacent cerebral substance appears unchanged. The patient was a woman forty-three years old. The signs of the tumour in the eye had existed ahout two years. The protrusion through the sclerotica had heen increasing for nine months, when the eye was removed. At the time of the operation it was ohserved that the optic nerve, though divided close to its entrance into the orbit, contained scattered melanotic deposits. There was no reproduction of the disease in the orhit; hut the patient died with this tumour at the hase of the hrain six months after the removal of the eye. The case is de- scribed hy Mr. Lawrence, in a Clinical Lecture in the London Medical Gazette, Vol. xxxvi. p. 964, London, 1845. The hrain was presented by S. Freeman, Esq. 25. A Lacrymal Gland, enlarged so as to form an oval mass, an inch in length and more than half an inch in width. It retains its lobular form and glandular appearance; and the disease seems to have consisted in a simple increase of the gland, without change of texture. The patient was a lady forty-five years old. The enlargement of the gland had made progress for several years. She recovered after the removal of the gland.SERIES X. DISEASES OF THE EAR. 1. Section of an Ear, exhibiting a growth of substance, like firm granulations, from the membranous lining of the tympanum. A portion of the growth is firmly adherent to the membrana tympani. 2. A Temporal Bone, in which ulceration has extended from the meatus auditorius externus, through the greater part of the base of the petrous portion of the bone, and has destroyed nearly all the cavity of the internal ear. 3. A Fleshy Excrescence, or Polypus, which was removed from the inside of the meatus auditorius externus. Part of its sur- face is smooth ; the rest is nodular and warty. 4. A similar, but smaller, Specimen. It is suspended by the narrow pedicle which attached it to the lining of the meatus. 5. Portion of the left Temporal Bone of a young man. A section has been made along the meatus auditorius externus, and through the cavity of the tympanum. The membrana tym- pani is very much thickened, and there is an ulcerated aperture near its anterior margin, through which a bristle is passed into the cavity of the tympanum. Another bristle is passed through a passage formed by ulceration, which leads from the tympanumTKNT1I SERIES. •224 to the anterior surface of the petrous portion of the temporal bone, and is thence continued through an aperture in the adja- cent part of the squamous portion. The patient had purulent discharge from the ear for many years. Two days before his death, after having long suffered from intense head-ache, he was suddenly affected by paralysis of the right leg; then of the right hand; and gradually became comatose. Pus was found in the cavity of the cerebral arachnoid; and the longitudinal, lateral, and petrosal sinuses were full of lymph and pus. Case-Book, Vol. i. p. 177, No. 201. 6.

The cuticle is removed to show that the disease is confined to a thickening of that part. The cutis beneath the corn is natural, except that its vascularity is increased, and its surface impressed. 5. A large portion of Skin, removed from a Woman's back. It presents an irregular warty growth, which consists of numerous very densely-set processes, elevated on narrow pedicles. This growth had existed from infancy; it was very vascular, and had the general aspect of a large nrcvus. Case-Book, Vol. i. p. 11, No. 23. 6. A Hand, with part of the Fore-arm, which were removed on account of a growth covering nearly half the surface of the skin. The growth is warty, very vascular, superficially ulcerated, with an everted sinuous margin. It bears a close resemblance to an ulcerated cancer of the scrotum in chimney sweeps. The patient was forty-nine years old. Five years before the amputation of his hand he was employed as a gardener in strewing soot over the ground for several mornings in succession; a warty growth then formed; and it increased and ulcerated in the spring of both the two following years, v&ile he was similarly employed. After this, though he was no longer in contact with soot, the disease increased till it was removed. After the operation he completely recovered. The case is related by Sir James Earle, in his edition of Mr. Pott's Works. London, 1808, Vol. iii. p. 182. 7. A Hand, with part of the Fore-arm, which were removed on account of extensive ulceration of a carcinomatous character, which appears to have commenced in the skin. 8.

A section of the diseased part shows it to consist of a dense fibrous tissue. 23. Portion of Skin removed from the posterior and lower part of the trunk of a middle-aged Woman. A large portion of skin, originally occupied by a nsevus, has undergone the following changes. It presents an irregular warty surface, composed of a multitude of densely set, lobulated, growths, which are for the most part elevated on narrow pedicles. The whole are covered by a thin layer of dark cuticle, detached portions o which fill up in great measure the interspaces between th several growths. About the centre of the portion of skin, there is a pendulous tumour, of the same characters as th others, but of .much larger size. They are all composed o a dense cellular tissue, similar to that of the outer layer o cutis. Presented by William Taylor, Esq.INJURIES AND DISEASES OP THE SKIN, Sec. 229 •2-1.

There is abundant formation of fat on the whole exterior of the heart; on the right ventricle it forms a layer half an inch in thickness. The coronary arteries are not ossified. The aortic and mitral valves are large and thin, but appear of healthy texture. The patient, a man twenty-five years old, attributed the origin of his disease to a fit of passion twelve months before his death. He shortly after observed un- naturally strong pulsations in all his large arteries and at his heart. These con- tinued till his death, all the arteries appearing to be dilated. He had also great dyspnoba aggravated in paroxysms, during which he was in the habit of taking large quantities of digitalis. Case-Book, Vol. i. p. 12, No. 27. 13. A Left Ventricle, in which there are several round and oval portions of fibrine firmly adhering to its internal surface, among the fleshy columns near the apex.

A narrow central aperture alone remains for the communication of the ventricle with the aorta. 16. A Mitral Valve, with portions of the Aorta. On a large portion of the mitral valve and on the arch of the aorta there are abundant deposits of earthy matter. The aortic valves, and the portion of the mitral valve adjacent to them, are but little affected with the same disease. 17. A Heart, exhibiting numerous warty masses of brown firm fibrine on the aortic valves. Behind one of the valves, the aorta is dilated into a pouch, and its inner membrane is here ulcerated. There are but two valves; both are of unusually large size, thick, opaque, and somewhat recurved. From a man, aged twenty-five. 18. A Left Ventricle ruptured at its apex; a quill is introduced into the aperture. Around the aperture, the walls of the ventricle are very thin, and appear to have been dilated into a kind of aneurismal sac, before the rupture took place. The aperture is nearly filled by a round firm clot of blood. 19. Part of a Heart, exhibiting thickening and rigidity of the mitral valve and of its tendinous chords, with extreme contraction of the left auriculo-ventricular opening. The cavity of the left auricle is enlarged; its lining membrane is opaque and thickened ; and a thick layer of dry laminated coagulum is firmly attached to the upper and posterior part of its walls, where it is rather more dilated than elsewhere. 20. Aortic Valves, with numerous firm, pale, warty excrescences or vegetations attached to their free borders, and to part of their adjacent surfaces. 21. Aortic Valves, with numerous similar excrescences attached to their surfaces.

The opening is a mere fissure through the muscular substance, at the junction of the anterior wall with the septum, near the middle of the heart. The walls of the ventricle around the opening are not thinner than in other situations: but the muscular substance is softer than is natural, and of a brown colour. There are numerous small deposits of fatty matter beneath the lining of the aorta, and of the left ventricle ; and the quantity of fat on the exterior of the heart is greater than is natural. 23. Section of a Left Ventricle, showing several small deposits of soft medullary substance between its muscular fibres. From the same person as No. 10 in Series XI. 24. Part of a Heart, exhibiting thickening and opacity of the mitral valve. The left auriculo-ventricular opening is contracted into a narrow crescentic fissure. The cavity of the left auricle is much enlarged, and its walls are thickened. The right ventricle is also dilated; but its walls are not increased in thickness. 25. Part of a Heart, with a small portion of lymph attached to the inside of the right auricle and, apparently, organized. A sec- tion has been made of the lymph, to show that it is so closely united to the lining membrane of the auricle that the boundary between them cannot be discerned. 26. Part of a Heart, exhibiting thickening, opacity, and rigidity of the mitral valve and its tendinous chords. The left auriculo- ventricular opening has the form of a narrow crescentic opening, with the horns of the crescent directed, as usual, towards the aortic valves. 27. A Left Ventricle ruptured about mid-distance between its base and apex, and near the juncture of its anterior wall with the septum. The aperture is of considerable extent; andDISEASES OF THE HEART; &e. 237 around it, the walls of the ventricle are of their natural thick- ness. The muscular substance appears soft, and of a dull brown colour. Earthy matter is deposited in the coats of the aorta. 28. A Left Ventricle and Auricle. In the boundary between the auricle and ventricle the wall of the heart is dilated into a pouch, like an aneurism, which extends round the outer part of the base of the left ventricle, from the anterior to the pos- terior margins of the septum. The mouth of this pouch is just below, and partly covered by, the mitral valve: its cavity is half filled by concentric layers of fibrine. The cavity of the left ventricle is much enlarged ; its walls are thickened; and its lining membrane, near the aneurismal sac, is thick, rough, and has yellow deposits in it. The exterior of the heart is covered by adhesions, which fixed it closely to the inner sur- face of the pericardium. The mitral valve and its tendinous chords are thickened and opaque, especially in those parts which are stretched over the mouth of the aneurismal sac. The patient was a man between forty and fifty years old. He had long suffered -with signs of diseased heart. Case-Book, Vol.i. p. 175, No. 199. 29. A Heart, with numerous small soft tumours beneath the layer of the pericardium covering the heart, and beneath the mem- brane lining its cavities. The case is described as one of " Tuberculated Sarcoma," by Mr. Abernethy, in his Surgical Observations; On Tumours, Vol. ii. p. 53. London, 1810. 30. Section of a Left Ventricle, with a shallow Aneurismal Pouch at its side. The inner surface of the pouch is smooth, and, apparently, formed by the lining of the ventricle partially covered by layers of fibrine. The pericardium is adherent to its outer surface. •31.

The peri- cardium in the rest of its extent was firmly adherent to the heart by false membrane, which had in some parts a hardness equal to that of cartilage. The internal parts of the heart appear sound. 33. A Heart exhibiting changes of structure in several of its internal parts. The lining membrane of the right auricle is thickened and opaque; and that of the left auricle has under- gone the same changes in a much greater degree. The tri- cuspid, mitral, and aortic valves are thickened. The mitral valve is hard and rigid, and earthy matter is deposited along its free margin. The free margins of the aortic valves also are very thick, round, and re-curved. The cavity of the left auricle is enlarged; and upon its internal surface, near the appendix, was a mass of fibrine, on the removal of which the membrane beneath was found rough and otherwise changed. Both the ventricles also are enlarged; but their walls are not proportionately thickened. 34. The Heart of a Child eight months old, with an abundant recent deposit of lymph over the whole free surface of the pericardium. The external portion of the pericardium is thickened. The heart is not enlarged. Case-Book, Vol. i. p. 38, No. 73. 35. Portion of a Heart in which there is a round Tumour growing from the inside of the left auricle, near the fossa ovalis. When recent, the tumour was, in texture, like a gelatinous polypus of the nose, yellowish, but spotted with blood, semi- transparent, uniform, and smooth on its cut surface. On detaching a portion of the tumour from the lining of the auricle, this was left rough and otherwise altered in its texture.

Case-Book, Vol.i. p. 110, No. 137. 37. Heart of an Adult. The cavity of the right auricle is larger than natural, and its membranous lining is thick and opaque. The tricuspid valve is thickened. The cavity of the left ventricle is larger than natural. Its muscular substance is considerably thickened, and its lining is opaque. The aortic valves are a little thickened, and there is soft matter deposited beneath the lining of the aorta just above the valves. The coronary arteries are thickened, and there is earthy matter deposited between their coats. A rupture of the septum between the ventricles has taken place near its union with the posterior wall of the heart, by which a free communication is formed between the ventricles. On the side of the left ven- tricle the opening is about two inches in length and of a semilunar form. On the side of the right ventricle, the open- ing is much smaller and rounded. 38. Aortic Valves, with abundant deposit of earthy matter in their tissue and upon their surfaces. 39. A Heart, exhibiting the effects of inflammation of the pericar- dium, with hypertrophy of its muscular substance, and disease of its valves. The pericardium is thickened; lymph is deposited over its free surface; and, in one situation the pericardium is adherent to the heart. The walls of the left ventricle are considerably increased in thickness, and its cavity is enlarged. The mitral and aortic valves are thickened and opaque. From a hoy twelve years old, who had many attacks of rheumatism. Presented by S. G. Lawrance, Esq. 40. A Heart, exhibiting a collection of Acephalocyst Hydatids between the lining membrane and the muscular substance forming the posterior wall of the right ventricle. The hyda- tids are contained in a distinct cyst, between two and threeTWKU'TII SERIES. 240 inches in diameter, a portion of which is turned downwards. The cyst projects into the lower part of the right ventricle, and gives a rounded form to the apex of the heart. The patient was a woman forty years old. Her health had appeared declining for some years; and about eighteen months before her death she began to have dyspncea on exertion and occasional pain at the heart. Six weeks before death more severe signs of disease of the heart were brought on by an unusual exertion, and these continued and were aggravated till she died. The case is related by Mr. Evans, and the preparation is engraved, in the Medico-Chirurgical Transac- tions, Vol. xvii. p. 507, London, 1832. Case-Book, Vol. i. p. 59, No. 105. Presented by Herbert Evans, Esq. 41. Part of the Heart of the young Woman from whom the melanotic eye in Series IX. No. 18 was extirpated. It presents several small round masses of melanotic substance im- bedded in the muscular substance, and one projecting into the cavity of the left ventricle. 42. Portion of an Aorta, exhibiting a large oval mass of fibrine mixed with earthy matter upon each of its semilunar valves. Below and behind one of the valves there is a small circum- scribed pouch, into which a piece of glass is introduced. It is smoothly lined by a prolongation of the internal lining of the heart. From a girl eighteen years old. Presented by P. C. Delagarde, Esq. 43. A Heart and Pericardium, from a child nine years old. The ex- ternal portion of the pericardium is greatly dilated and thickened, and there is an abundant deposit of lymph upon its internal sur- face, as well as upon that of the pericardium covering the heart. At the lower part of the bottle is a large mass of lymph, which was loose in the pericardium. Besides lymph, the pericardium contained two pints of turbid serous fluid. Presented by Dr. Moore. 44. A Heart, exhibiting thickening, opacity, and rigidity of the tricuspid and mitral valves, with contraction of both the auriculo-ventricular orifices. The cavities of the auricles are dilated, and their membranous linings are thickened. The right auriculo-ventricular orifice would just admit the passageDISEASES OF THE HEART, &c. 241 of the fore finger; the left would hut admit the entrance of the tip of the same finger. 45. A Heart and Pericardium. Lymph is deposited in a thin layer, minutely reticulated, and with some columnar processes attached to it, both upon the inner surface of the external portion of the pericardium and upon the surface of that which covers the heart. The heart is considerably enlarged. 46. Section of a Heart, in every part of which there are minute deposits of melanotic substance. Some of these deposits are beneath the pericardium, others beneath the membrane lining both the auricles and ventricles, and others are imbedded in the muscular substance. Some minute deposits of the me- lanotic substance are seen beneath the lining membrane of a portion of the vena cava superior which is attached to the heart. The other section of this heart is preserved in the Museum of the Koyal College of Surgeons of England. A melanotic tumour from the skin of the same patient is in Series XXXV. and the history of the case is added to its description. Presented hy Dr. Norris. 47. A Heart, in which there is abundant formation of bone-like tissue in the pericardium covering both the auricles and ven- tricles. In some situations there are lines of osseous substance corresponding with the course of the coronary vessels; but, from a careful examination in the recent state, it appeared that the osseous substance had been deposited, not in those vessels, but in the cellular and adipose tissue around them. From a man aged twenty-one years. Presented by E. A. Lloyd, Esq. 48. Coronary Arteries from the heart of a man who had been the subject of Angina Pectoris. Earthy matter is abundantly deposited in the coats of both the arteries, but their canals are free. The alteration was confined to the first divisions of the coronary arteries ; their smaller branches were sound. 49. Portion of the Heart of an adult. The mitral valve and its R->i2 TWELFTH SERIES. tendinous cliords are greatly thickened, opaque, shortened, and nearly rigid. The aortic valves are thickened, and united by their adjacent edges, so that only a very small circular aperture was left between them for the passage of the blood. The walls of the left ventricle are of their natural thickness, but the fleshy columns connected with the mitral valve are hyper- trophied. 50. Section of a Heart, with the corresponding portion of the Pericardium. The pericardial sac was completely filled by lymph, of which this section shows a layer nearly an inch in thickness at one part. 51. Part of a Heart, exhibiting a great dilatation of the left au- ricle, with thickening of its membranous lining, and with thickening, induration, and contraction of the mitral valve and tendinous chords. Portions of fibrine, arranged in concentric layers, adhere to the thickened membranous lining of a part of the auricle which is more dilated than the rest. The patient was a woman forty-one years old, who had heen for some years subject to rheumatism, and had signs of diseased heart for twenty months before her death. Case-Book, Vol. i. p. 158, No. 184. 52. A Heart from a child aged four years. The aortic valves are opaque and thickened, and their free margins are curled back- ward towards the artery. Two of the valves are closely united by their adjacent margins. 53. A Heart, exhibiting a pouch formed by dilatation of a circular portion of the anterior wall of the left ventricle near its base. The pouch was filled by laminated coagulum ; its mouth is round, narrow, and smooth ; and its parietes, apparently, con- sist of the serous covering and inner membrane of the heart, thickened, united, and having small deposits of a soft yellowish substance in and around them. The muscular tissue of this part has entirely disappeared. The coagulum which was within the pouch is at the bottom of the bottle. The patient was a girl nineteen years old. The disease of the heart probably commenced about eighteen months before death ; but its progress was marked byDISEASES OF THE HEART, &c. 243 various and singular attacks of paralysis, erysipelas, and signs of phlebitis. Case- Book, Vol. i. p. 160, No. 186. 54. A Heart and large Vessels, with the Trachea, and a portion of the left Lung, from a child six years old. An irregular rent extends through the whole length and thickness of the posterior wall of the left ventricle and auricle. A similar laceration extends through the upper part of the anterior wall of the left ventricle, and through the adjacent part of the septum. The left bronchus is torn across near the root of the lung. These injuries were the results of the passage of a heavy wheel over the chest of the child. Some of the ribs were fractured, but the pericardium was not torn. General emphysema was produced by the escape of air from the ruptured bronchus. 55. A Heart, in which there are but two pulmonary semilunar Valves, and both of these are covered with thick irregular layers of soft fibrine or lymph, which is deposited in such quantity on the posterior valve, that it forms a layer extending quite across the artery. On the internal wall of the artery there are several small wart-like bodies, which are firmly adherent to it; and be- hind the posterior valve, there is a circumscribed ulceration of the inner membrane. The rest of the heart, its other valves, and the large vessels, are healthy. The patient was a girl twenty-one years old, admitted in a state of ex- treme debility. She had violent palpitation of the heart; and a loud bellows- sound, accompanying the first sound of the heart, was heard most distinctly at the base and m a lmc extending thence upwards and to the left. She died exhausted • with old coagula, filling many of the branches of the pulmonary artery, and with pulmonary apoplexy, of which specimens are preserved in Series XIV No 8 The case is related by Mr. Paget, in the Medm-GHrrngM Transactions', Vol. xxvn. p. 182, London, 1844. 56. A Heart and Pericardium, from a child fifteen months old. Both the layers of pericardium are covered by a thick coatino- of soft lymph. The lymph on the heart has a coarsely reticulat surface; that on the external portion of pericardium is in a thinner and smoother layer; and the two are connected at the base of the heart, by several columns of lymph passing from the one to the other. Presented by Dr. West. R 2244 TWELFTH SERIES 57. A Heart, very much reduced in size, but in which the propor- tions of its several parts are preserved, and its tissue appears healthy. It weighed five ounces and four drachms. It mea- sured a little less than four inches across the base, and five inches and a quarter from the base to the apex. From a man fifty years old, of middle stature, who died with carcinoma of the stomach, in a state of extreme emaciation. 58. A Heart, with a Sac attached to the left side of its left ventricle. The sac is spheroidal in form, and upwards of three inches in its greater diameter. Its walls are composed of the exterior of the ventricle, the pericardium, and a dense tissue by which the opposite surfaces of the pericardium were adherent. It is lined by irregularly laminated coagula: the phrenic nerve runs over its anterior part; it communicates with the cavity of the ventricle by an oval aperture, about a quarter of an inch in diameter, the margins of which are smooth and round. A portion of white glass is passed through this aperture. The muscular substance of the ventricle immediately around the aperture has disappeared, and is replaced by a dense white tissue. The rest of the heart is healthy: but its exterior is covered by false membrane by which it adhered to the pericardium. It may be presumed, that there was in this case a rupture, or an ulceration, through the wall of the left ventricle; that the blood was prevented from being effused into the cavity of the pericardium, by adhesions previously formed between its two surfaces; and that these adhesions, and the pericardium for a considerable distance around the aperture, were stretched by the force of the blood, so as to form the sac, in nearly the same manner as a false aneurism is formed after the destruction of the coats of an artery by the distension of its sheath. From a woman thirty-seven years old, who had had syphilis for many years in its worst form. She had long been under observation at the Penitentiary ; but had presented no distinct sign of disease of the heart. She died with dysentery and slight bronchitis. Presented by Dr. Baly. 59. A Heart, in which, by thickening and contraction of the mitral valves and its tendinous chords, the left auriculorventricular245 DISEASES OF THE HEART, &c. orifice is reduced to an irregular chink, about an inch long, and from one to two lines in width. On the auricular surface of the diseased valves there are also projections of earthy matter, and deposits of layers of fibrine. The lining membrane of the left auricle is thickened and opaque: so also are the tricuspid and pulmonary valves, and, in a much greater degree, the aortic valves. The pericardium was universally adherent, and in several places, especially on the anterior surface of the ventricles, portions of bone have been formed in the adhesions. Some of these have been exposed by dissection. The whole heart is enlarged, all its cavities being dilated and hypertrophied in nearly equal proportions. From a man twenty-seven years old. He could not remember to have been ever free from signs of disease of the heart, but they were greatly aggravated after an attack of acute rheumatism. Case-Book, Vol. i. p. 189, No. 209. 60. Part of a Heart, in which there is a large mass of firm medullary matter in the substance of the apex of the right ventricle, and of the septum. The morbid mass has not altered the external form of the heart, but it projects with a coarsely granular surface into the cavity of the ventricle, and has raised up the tricuspid valve: in its middle, its substance is softened and broken down. The pericardium is in every part closely adhe- rent. The aorta is dilated, and both it and its valves have earthy deposits in them. From the patient, from whom the eye, Series IX. No. 17, was extirpated. He died two years after the operation with this medullary disease of the heart, similar deposits in the lungs, and a large medullary tumour on the lower jaw. 61. Portions of the left Ventricle of a Heart, in the middle of the muscular substance of which there is a small spherical mass of tuberculous matter, about two lines in diameter. The surround- ing tissue is healthy. From a negro, thirty years old, who had tuberculous disease of the lungs, liver, spleen, and intestines. 62. A Mitral Valve, with some of the adjacent parts. The sub- stance of the valve is!generally somewhat thickened; and the middle of its left portion has been distended into a small bilocular pouch, like an aneurism. The pouch projects into the cavity of the left auricle: it is about three-quarters ofTWELFTH SERIFS. 246 an inch high, and half an inch wide: its orifice on the ven- tricular surface of the valve, is about a quarter of an inch in diameter. It has burst by a large irregular rent in one of its lateral walls. The aortic valves have numerous warty growths on their outer surface and borders ; but are otherwise healthy. 63. Part of an exceedingly large Heart. There are only two pulmonary and two aortic valves, but they are all of large size. The tricuspid and pulmonary valves present some opaque thickening of their tissue, but are pliant and free. The mitral valve is thick, opaque, and very tough ; its tendinous chords also are thickened. The aortic valves are thickened, indurated, contracted, and made completely rigid by masses of coarsely granular earthy matter deposited in and upon them. The whole heart is enlarged, but its several parts are increased in nearly proportionate degrees. The pulmonary artery and the aorta also are very large : but both their tissue and that of the heart appear healthy. The patient was thirty years old. He had acute rheumatism fifteen years before death. He had dyspnoea on exertion during the last year of his life, and in the last week he suffered extremely from it; but he had no anasarca except in his last three days. Case-Book, Vol. i. p. 190, No. 210. 64. Part of an Aorta, with only two Valves, both of which, like those in the specimen last described, are made completely rigid, by the thickening and induration of their tissue, and by the abundant deposit of earthy matter. One of the masses of earthy matter is cut open: its interior is dark, soft, and broken down, looking like a cavity in a carious tooth. The aortic orifice is reduced to a narrow crescentic fissure between the two valves. Presented by F. H. Colt, Esq. 65. A Heart, in which there are imbedded, in the middle of the posterior wall of the left ventricle, several small masses of a yellowish firm substance. Some of them are prominent in the cavity of the ventricle; but the largest, which is darker and firmer than the others, projects externally, and is situated at the bottom of a recess in the wall of the heart, like the sac of an aneurism. The muscular substance of the heart is wastedDISEASES OP THE HEART, &c. 247 around this largest mass, and a thin layer or capsule of fibro- cellular tissue invests it. The pericardium was adherent to its surface and to the adjacent part of the surface of the ventricle. The patient was a girl, who, for a long time before her death, had complained of nearly constant pain about the heart, but presented no other sign of cardiac disease. She died suddenly. Presented by Dr. Hue. 66. Part of an Aorta, of which the orifice is small, and the valves thickened, opaque, united at their adjacent edges, and all made nearly rigid by deposits of earthy matter in them and in parts of the arterial walls near their angles. Only a small aperture remains leading from the centre to the wall of the aorta, between the edges of two of the valves. From an elderly gentleman who had cerebral disease, but manifested no distinct signs of disease of the heart. 67. Part of an Aorta, with only two valves, both of which are thickened, and made rigid by deposits of earthy matter, parts of which project in coarsely granular masses on the arterial surface of the valves. Only a very narrow linear fissure remains between the valves. 68. A Heart, greatly enlarged, and with only two pulmonary valves. Both these valves are slightly thickened and opaque, and have large masses of fibrine mixed with earthy matter attached to their free borders. One of these masses, three quarters of an inch in length, hangs into the cavity of the ventricle, and appears, by its weight, to have elongated and drawn out the narrow portion of the edge of the valve to which it is attached. All the other valves are slightly opaque, but thin and pliant. There is a small granular patch of fibrine deposited on the posterior surface of one portion of the mitral valve. 69. Part of the left side of a Heart, with lymph or fibrine deposited on a large portion of both surfaces of the mitral valve, and on the borders and ventricular surface of the aortic valves. The deposits are soft, yellowish, warty, and firmly attached. The valves are opaque and slightly thickened; those of the aorta are also contracted.SERIES XIII.

A Thoracic Aorta, exhibiting an abundant deposit of earthy matter in its coats. The earthy matter forms, in many places, thin, round, and oval plates, some of which lie uncovered on the inner surface of the artery, while beneath others, shallow cavities are shown filled with soft grumous yellowish substance. An Aorta, with an Aneurism of the first portion of its arch, which has burst within the pericardium. The sac, which is of an oval form, has extended across the front of the aorta between it and the pulmonary artery, and has compressed the latter. The mouth of the sac is round and is situated in the front wall of the aorta, just above the aortic valves. A quill is introduced from the sac through the ruptured aperture, above which a portion of the pericardium is reflected from the sac. The internal coat of the aorta is thickened and tuberculated, espe- cially near the margin of the mouth of the aneurismal sac. Lymph is deposited on the inner surface of the pulmonary artery, where it is pressed upon by the sac.

A Popliteal Artery, in which the internal coat is thickened, wrinkled, and the seat of abundant earthy deposit. A portion of it, an inch in length, is obliterated. 5. Part of an Abdominal Aorta, with the right Renal Artery obliterated by deposits of earthy matter filling its cavity. The internal coat of the aorta is thickened. From the same diabetic patient as No. 3 in this Series, and Nos. 16, 26 in Series XVI. The kidney to which this renal artery belonged was of full size, and its pelvis contained urine. Case-Book, Vol. i. p. 21, No. 45. 6. Part of the Aorta of a Dog, exhibiting the effects of a ligature applied twenty-four hours before death. The inner and middle coats of the artery are partially divided, and above the seat of the ligature is a conical coagulum, which appears laminated and is loosely attached to the walls of the artery. 7. Sections of an Aneurismal Sac, which was situated on the Abdo- minal Aorta, immediately below the superior mesenteric artery. The cceliac and superior mesenteric arteries are obliterated at their origins. The sac is completely filled by firm laminated coagulum. The coats of the aorta are thickened and opaque. From a man forty-five years old, who died from rupture of the dilated aorta in No. 9. Case-Book, Vol. i. p. 14, No. 32. 8. The Arch and Thoracic portion of an Aorta uniformly dilated. The coats of the artery are generally thickened and indurated. Earthy matter is deposited in them, and their inner surface is irregularly tuberculated, and appears ulcerated at many points. 9. A Heart, with an Aneurism extending from the commencement to the termination of the arch of the aorta. The sac is of immense size ; its lower part is formed by the dilated aorta ; but at the upper part its walls are apparently formed by con- densed cellular tissue, and exhibit small laminated deposits of fibrine upon their inner surface. The front and upper part of the sac has been turned upwards, with three ribs belonging if) the right side of the chest, and a part of the sternum, closely252 THIRTEENTH SERIES. attached to it. There is a small fissure, in the side of the sac near its upper part, through which blood escaped into the pleura. The heart is healthy; but the pericardium is generally adherent to it. From the same patient as No. 7. 10. The Arch of an Aorta, generally dilated and having a large aneurismal sac, formed by a further dilatation of a portion of its anterior wall. The sac extends forwards through the sternum and costal cartilages, and formed a considerable tumour on the front of the chest. There is an abundant deposit of earthy matter in the walls of the artery, and in part of the aneurismal sac. 11. Section of the Arch of an Aorta, with an Aneurism arising from its upper part. The cavity of the sac is nearly filled by laminated coagulum. The internal membrane of the artery is thickened. The trachea is attached to the sac, and its internal membrane is elevated by the pressure of the sac against it. The sac is also closely adherent to the arteria innominata, and to the right carotid and subclavian arteries. 12. Portion of the Aneurismal Sac last described, removed to show the concentric laminated arrangement of the coagulum contained in it. 13. Portions of the Femoral, Popliteal, Tibial, and Peroneal Arteries, the coats of which, by the abundant deposit of earthy matter in them, form rigid bone-like tubes. The greater part of the de- posit is in the form of narrow rings round the artery. 14. The Arch of an Aorta, with a broad flat aneurism which, arising from its anterior wall just above the valves, has compressed, and burst into, the pulmonary artery. The internal coat of the aorta is irregularly thickened: the mouth of the sac is round and very wide. 15. The Arch of an Aorta, generally and almost uniformly dilatedINJURIES AND DISEASES OE ARTERIES AND VEINS. into a large aneurismal sac. The dilatation begins directly above the valves, and terminates abruptly just beyond the origin of the left subclavian artery. The interior of the sac is very unevenly tuberculated : it contains no coagulum, and has burst into the pulmonary artery. The patient was a man forty-five years old. While apparently in good health, he was seized with pain in the chest, dyspnoea, and intermittent pulse, and died in eighteen hours. Case-Book, Vol. i. p. 125, No. 148. 16. Section of the lower part of an Abdominal Aorta, with an Aneurism formed by the dilatation and growth of a small portion of its posterior wall. A piece of bougie is introduced into an aperture by which the sac burst. The coats of the aorta, except in the dilated part, appear quite healthy: the interior of the sac is coarsely tuberculated. 17. Parts of an Abdominal Aorta, and of the Vena Cava Inferior. Both vessels are imbedded in a mass of enlarged lymphatic glands. The coats of the aorta are thickened, and its cavity is contracted just above its division into the iliac arteries. The vena cava, to the extent of three inches above the iliac veins, is completely filled by concentric layers of fibrine which are ad- herent to its inner surface. 18. Part of the Arch of an Aorta, with its large vessels, exhibiting an Aneurism of the Arteria Innominata pressing upon the trachea. The sac appears to be formed by dilatation of the whole circumference of a part of the artery, and contains laminated coagulum, the deposit of which has extended across the orifice of the right carotid artery, so as completely to close it. The canal of the trachea is slightly narrowed by the pressure of the aneurism. The patient was a girl twenty years old. For a fortnight before her death she was subject to paroxysms of dyspnoea, and in one of these she died. The case is related by Mr. Lawrence, in the Medioo-Chirurgical Transactions, Vol. vi. p. 227, London, 1815. Case-Book, Vol. i. p. 122, No. 145. 19. A Femoral Artery, and Vein, from a Stump. The coats of the vein are generally thickened and indurated. Lymph is de- posited upon the whole of the inner surface of the vein, as highTHIRTEENTH SERIES. up as the junction of the deep femoral vein; and the lymph, mingled with clots of blood, completely fills the cavity of the vein to some distance above the amputated extremity. A conical clot an inch in length fills the end of the cavity of the artery. The patient was a man forty-five years old. The amputation was performed for compound fracture. The cavity remaining within the lymph in the vein was full of pus. Case-Book, Vol. i. p. 15, No. 33. 20. The Arch of an Aorta, from which two large Aneurisms have arisen. The mouths of the sacs are separated by a portion of the whole circumference of the artery about half an inch in width, above which they communicate by an irregular oval aperture, through which one appears to have burst into the other. La- minated coagulum lines both sacs. The internal surface of the aorta is tuberculated, and has irregular deposits of soft matter between its coats. Presented by James Gillman, Esq. 21. The Arch of an Aorta, with the left subclavian and axillary arteries. The left axillary artery is the seat of aneurism, for the cure of which the subclavian artery has been tied. The upper part of the preparation consists of the left subclavian artery and the arch of the aorta. By tracing the subclavian artery downwards, the situation where it has been tied will be recognized. On the side of the ligature nearest to the heart, the artery is pervious and of its ordinary size to its extremity, which was closed by only a small coagulum. Between this coagulum and the sides of the vessel, is an aperture into which a bristle is passed, and through which blood had passed from the artery to the outward wound. At a short distance above the situation of the ligature, several large branches arise. The portion of artery between the situation of the ligature and the aneurismal sac is completely closed by coagulum. The aneu- rismal sac also is in great part filled by laminated coagulum: its exterior is firmly attached to three of the ribs which have undergone partial absorption. Below the sac is the remaining part of the axillary, with the commencement of the brachial, artery. The axillary artery from the point of its connexionINJURIES AND DISEASES OF ARTERIES AND VEINS. with the sac is quite pervious, and a large hranch arises from it which divides into the infra-scapular and circumflex arteries. The axillary vein is connected with the sac, and is pervious. The coats of the subclavian artery above the situation of the ligature were so brittle that they yielded to the slightest force. The patient was a man thirty-eight years old. The aneurism appeared to have existed four months, and was first observed six months after an attack of acute rheumatism. He died after repeated hemorrhages, on the thirteenth day from the application of the ligature. The case is described by Mr. Charles Mayo, in the Medieo-Cldrurgical Transactions, Vol. xii. p. 12. London, 1823. Case-Book, Vol. i. p. 115, No. 141. Presented by Charles Mayo, Esq. 22. Portion of a Femoral Artery, exhibiting the obliteration of its trunk and of the commencement of the Profunda, by the deposit of fibrine in concentric layers forming a firm clot about an inch in length. The arterial coats appear healthy. Prom a young man who died with disease of the aortic valves. Some time before his death, the limb from which this artery was taken became, without any evident cause, pulseless and cold. Case-Book, Vol. i. p. 21, No. 46. 23. A Femoral Artery, upon which a ligature was placed a con- siderable time before death. The canal of the artery above and below the obliterated part is gradually contracted into a conical form as it approaches that part. The upper and lower portions of the vessel are connected by condensed cellular tissue. For some way above and below the obliterated part, the coats of the artery are thickened, and in the upper portion a dry clot of blood is firmly adherent to the walls. 24. A Popliteal Artery, with a diffused Aneurism. There appears to have been a complete rupture of the whole circumference of the artery, so that the sac is formed entirely by the surrounding cellular tissue. Above and below the aneurism, the artery appears to be healthy; its coats terminate abruptly at the boundaries of the sac. The sac is almost filled by laminated coagulum. The popliteal vein is pervious, but flattened by the pressure of the sac. 25. The Arch of an Aorta, with a small Aneurism arising from its256 THIRTEENTH SERIES. termination. The aneurism has protruded and burst into the left bronchus. The aorta is generally thickened and dilated. 26. Iliac and Femoral Arteries, with an Aneurism at the com- mencement of the Femoral Artery, for the cure of which the external Iliac has been tied. The sac is large, nearly globular, and in great part filled by laminated coagulum. Upon its lower part, a portion of skin is left, with the aperture through which it burst externally. The ligature was applied about an inch and a quarter above the sac, and it has completely divided the internal coats of the artery. Between the situation of the ligature and the sac there is a small deposit of lymph. Between the situation of the ligature and the division of the common iliac, the artery is completely filled by lymph and coagulated blood. The coats of the artery are, apparently, healthy. The femoral artery, as it passes out of the lower part of the sac, is impervious. The profunda passes out of the middle of the sac, and is pervious. The femoral vein is open above and below the sac, and is obliterated by the pressure of the sac in the mid-space. The anterior crural nerve is connected with the sac, and is flattened by its pressure. The patient was a man seventy years old. The aneurism had existed two years and a half before it burst through the sloughing integuments. The artery was tied directly after the rupture, and the patient lived fifty-five hours. Case- Boole, Vol. i. p. 16, No. 37. 27. Iliac and Femoral Arteries, with an Aneurism at the com- mencement of the Femoral Artery, for the cure of which the external Iliac has been tied. The ligature was applied about half an inch below the division of the common iliac. The upper end of the artery is closed by a small portion of dry clot; its lower end is closed by a conical clot an inch long and closely adherent to its walls. Between these clots is a sub- stance connecting the extremities of the artery divided by the ligature, which substance appeared, in the recent state, to con- sist of the remains -of the sheath of the artery. From the clot below the situation of the ligature, to within a short distance of the sac, the artery is pervious: and from this pervious pari the epigastric and circumflex branches arise. Within thatINJURIES AND DISEASES OF ARTERIES AND VEINS. part of the artery which is directly above the sac, is a small conical clot completely filling its canal. The coats of the artery appeared healthy throughout. The external iliac vein is pervious to within an inch of the sac; but there it is ob- literated. The interior of the portion of sac which is preserved is irregularly wrinkled and tuberculated, but polished as if lined by a prolongation of the internal coat of the artery. The patient was a man thirty-five years old. The aneurism extended from Poupart's ligament nearly to the knee, and almost surrounded the limb. After the ligature of the artery the limb mortified, and the patient died in the third week with symptoms of tetanus. The case is related by Mr. Hodgson in his " Treatise on Diseases of the Arteries and Veins," p. 198, Case xxxv. Case-Book, Vol. i. p. 14, No. 30. 28. The Arch of an Aorta, with the Arteria Innominata and Right Carotid Artery. There is an aneurism of the carotid artery, about half an inch below its division, for the cure of which a ligature was applied. A section of the aneurismal sac shows its cavity contracted and filled by layers of coagulum. A portion of straw is passed through the narrow opening of communication between the sac and the artery. The place where the artery was tied is marked by a portion of straw, which is introduced into the channel leading to the artery from which the ligature was withdrawn. Below the situation of the ligature, the artery is filled by a large clot of blood extending nearly to the division of the innominata. Above the situation of the ligature the coats of the artery are thickened, and lymph is deposited upon its internal surface ; and these appearances extend upwards to the division of the carotid into the external and internal branches, both of which are pervious. The coats of the aorta are thickened and tuberculated. The patient was a man fifty-two years old. The aneurism had been observed for a month, and appeared to be the consequence of an injury of the neck. He died in the fifth week after the operation, with suppuration in the artery above and in the tissues round, the sac. The ca9e is described by Mr. Vincent, in the Medico-Chirurgical Transactions, Vol. x. p. 212, London, 1819. Case-Book Vol. i. p. Ill, No. 139. 29. A Vena Cava Inferior obliterated. The preparation consists of the remains of the vena cava, the right kidney, and a firm fleshy tumour which has been formed between them. Great part of the kidney is absorbed. The vena cava is s'258 THIRTEENTH SERIES. obliterated from its bifurcation almost to its termination in the auricle. The upper part of the vein is distended by fibrinous substance, which appeared to have been separated from the blood. Below this the vein could not be traced; it appeared to be completely lost in the diseased structure. 30. Portion of an Abdominal Aorta. Earthy matter is deposited in its coats in such quantity that it forms a complete tube, which is in some parts half a line in thickness. 31. A Vena Cava Inferior, with the Common Iliac Veins, oblite- rated by deposits of fibrine in their cavities. From the con- tracted state of the iliac veins and of the lower part of the inferior cava, it was inferred that they had been obliterated for a considerable time. The body from which they were taken was generally anasarcons, and one foot had mortified. Case-Book, Vol. i. p. 25, No. 57. 32. Portion of an Artery, exhibiting the division of its middle and internal coats by three different kinds of ligature, viz. the large round, the small round, and the flat, ligature. The ligatures em- ployed were composed of the same materials as those which are tied round the portion of artery by the side of that on which the experiment was made. The small round ligature, which is in the middle, made the cleanest and most complete division of the coats : the division by the flat ligature is uneven, incom- plete, and attended by partial separation of the adjacent part of the divided coats. The experiment was made on a dead artery. 33. Sections of an Abdominal Aorta, with a small Aneurism. The sac is situated between the coats of the artery ; its cavity extending on every side of the small mouth by which it opens through the inner coat, and projecting very little externally. Its cavity is completely filled by laminated coagulum. Above and below the aneurism, earthy matter is deposited in the coats of the artery, and its walls are generally thickened and indurated. 34. A Femoral Vein, exhibiting an abundant and nearly uniform259 INJURIES AND DISEASES OF ARTERIES AND VEINS. deposit of lymph upon its inner surface. That part of the inner membrane of the vein which is exposed is of a dark red colour. The branches of the vein are filled by firm coagula. These veins were taken from the left lower extremity of a man who had compound fracture of the right thigh. He died a month after the injury, with obscure signs of phlebitis. The remaining cavities of the veins were full of pus; but no other veins were diseased. Case-Book, Vol. i. p. 54, No. 95. 35. Parts of a Femoral Artery and Vein, from a Stump. The extremity of the artery is closed by a conical clot, which extends up the vessel to the origin of the nearest branch. The base of this clot is united to the extremity of the artery. The extremity of the vein is closed by a similar but smaller clot. The coats of the artery and vein are thickened and closely united to the surrounding parts. 36. Parts of a Femoral Artery and Vein, from a Stump. The extremity of the artery is closed by the adhesion of its sides, but there is no clot within it. The extremity of the vein is open, and lymph is deposited upon its internal surface. 37. Parts of a Femoral Artery and Vein, from a Stump. The extremity of the artery is open ; but its canal is filled to some distance by a coagulum, which adhered firmly to its coats. The extremity of the vein is closed, and there is a deposit of lymph upon its inner surface. 38. Parts of a Femoral Artery and Vein, from a Stump. The extremities of both the artery and the vein are closed, and intimately connected with the surrounding tissues. Both of them also have coagula above their closed extremities. 39. Part of an Aorta, with an Aneurism at the commencement of the Arch. The sac has extended forwards through the sternum and ribs on each side, and, elevating the pectoral muscles, has formed a large tumour upon the chest. A portion of skin attached to the front of the tumour indicates, by its white appearance, that the process of sloughing had commenced in Ml centre. The sac, in its progress towards the sternum, has s 2THIRTEENTH SERIES •260 extended itself on each side inlo the lung. A portion of the sac in the right lung is laid open, and is filled by laminated coagulum. On the left side, the ragged surfaces of the sac, and the shreds of coagulum protruding through it, mark the situation in which the aneurism burst into the chest. 40. A Femoral Artery, from a Stump. Its coats are thickened, and earthy matter is abundantly deposited in them. In conse- quence of the occurrence of hemorrhage after the amputation, a second ligature was placed around the artery, about two inches above its extremity. This ligature had separated before death ; and a portion of whalebone is passed into the aperture through which it was withdrawn. The cavity of the artery, above and below the situation of this ligature, is filled by lymph and clots of blood, which extend to a consider- able distance up the vessel. The cut end of the artery is open. 41. The Arch of an Aorta, which is the seat of an Aneurism, by the progress of which the left Subclavian Artery is ob- literated. The walls of the sac appear to be formed entirely by the thickened and dilated coats of the artery. At the back of the preparation is the arteria innominata, with the left carotid artery; in the front and lower part is the left sub- clavian artery, obliterated at its origin by fibrine extending from that which lines a part of the aneurismal sac. There is a wide irregular aperture produced by the rupture of the end of the sac. 42. The commencement of the Aorta, with two small Aneurismal Sacs, just above and behind two of the semilunar valves. The coats of the artery are thickened, and its internal surface is tuberculated. One of the sacs is nearly filled by laminated coagulum. 43. A Carotid Artery, with a large Aneurism at its division. The sac is globular and completely filled by layers of coagulum loosely connected. A portion of straw is passed through the narrow opening of communication between the sac and theINJURIES AND DISEASES OF ARTERIES AND VEINS. 261 artery. Around the opening the coats of the artery are thickened and rough; below it they appear quite healthy, but the canal of the artery is diminished by the pressure of the aneurism. The external and internal carotid arteries are pervious. The pneumogastric nerve is exposed above and below the aneurism ; in the intermediate space it could not be traced on the sac. 44. Portion of a Carotid Artery, with its external and internal branches. Just above the division, the cavity of the internal carotid is slightly dilated, and its internal coat is thickened, opaque, white on its surface, and the seat of an abundant deposit of soft, probably fatty, matter in the deeper part of its thickened substance. 45. Portion of an Abdominal Aorta, in the coats of which there is abundant deposit of fatty and earthy matter, with ulceration over the principal deposits. Between the renal and inferior mesenteric arteries the ulceration has extended through the inner and middle coats of the aorta to its outer coat, which is dilated into a small pouch. 46. Part of a Splenic Artery, with a small Aneurism formed by the dilatation of a portion of its wall. Earthy matter is depo- sited in the coats of the sac. 47. A Popliteal Artery, of which the whole circumference, in about an inch and a half of its length, is dilated into an aneurismal sac. The coats of the artery, both above and below, as well as at the seat of, the aneurismal dilatation, are thickened. 48. Part of an Abdominal Aorta, with a large Aneurism, which has extended from its posterior wall backwards through the verte- brae and ribs, and forms a large sac external to the chest by the side of the spine. 49. An Anterior Tibial Artery, in which a small lacerated aperture,2G2 THIRTEENTH SERIES. completely penetrating its coats, was made by the sharp end of a fragment of bone in a case of compound fracture. Amputation was made necessary by the hemorrhage. Case-Book, Vol.i. p. 19, No. 40. 50. Portion of a Renal Artery, with a small Aneurism. Earthy matter is deposited in the coats of the sac, and the adjacent walls of the artery appear thickened and indurated. 51. Part of the Arch of an Aorta, with an Aneurism immediately above one of the semilunar valves. The sac, which is about the size of a walnut, extended between the pulmonary artery and the aorta, and burst into the pericardium, through the opening into which a quill is introduced. The internal coat of the aorta at the angles of the other valves, as well as around the mouth of the sac, is thickened, opaque white, elevated, and tuberculated. 52. The Arch of an Aorta, with an Aneurism at its upper and posterior part, between the innominata and left carotid arteries. The sac is in great part filled by coagulum. The internal coat of the artery is generally thickened. The sac has com- pressed and burst into the trachea by a transverse rent between two of the cartilaginous rings. 53. A Popliteal Artery, with part of a large Aneurismal Sac. The upper portion of the popliteal artery is pervious to its termi- nation in the sac, into which it opens by a smooth round orifice. The lower portion of the artery is also pervious, and communicates with the sac by an opening of considerable length. The upper portion of the popliteal vein is obliterated ; the lower portion is pervious. 54. The Arch of an Aorta, with a large Aneurism just below the innominata, which has burst into the trachea and oesopha- gus. The sac is nearly filled by layers of coagulum ; and the blood passed between them and the parietes of the sac, in the direction marked by two pieces of whalebone, to the irregular apertures in the trachea and oesophagus by WhichINJURIES AND DISEASES OF ARTERIES AND VEINS. 2G3 the aneurism burst. All the arteries arising from the upper part of the arch of the aorta are compressed by the aneurism. 55. The Arch of an Aorta, from which an Aneurism of the posterior wall below the brachio-cephalic trunks has burst into the oesophagus. The internal coat of the artery is much thickened. The main arterial trunks arise from the front of the sac, and are not compressed. 56. An External Iliac Artery, torn completely and straight across. The torn ends of the artery are an inch apart, and are con- nected by a coagulum of blood. The coats of the artery are not obviously diseased. The rupture was directly under Poupart's ligament. It occurred in an injury by which the lower part of the femur was fractured. 57. A Subclavian and Axillary Artery. The coats of the Artery, especially the inner coat, are thickened; and its cavity is generally dilated. 58. Part of an Aorta, with a large Aneurism of the Thoracic portion. The sac has extended into the bodies of the verte- bras, and has burst by a large sloughing aperture into the oesophagus. The coats of the artery are greatly thickened and generally dilated, and its inner coat is tuberculated with opaque, white, elevated patches. 59. A Femoral Artery and Vein, from a Stump. The coats of the artery are generally thickened. No adhesion of its sides has taken place at the cut extremity ; but for some distance higher up, its cavity is filled by coagulum. The extremity of the vein is closed. 60. The Arch of an Aorta, exhibiting numerous deposits of soft and earthy matter in its coats, and a mass of fibrine, about the size of half a walnut, so closely adherent to the inner surface of the artery as to present the appearance of a growth from it. No other fibrine was deposited in the artery. From a man thirty-eight years old, who died with phthisis. Case-Book, Vol i p. 173, No. 197.264 THIRTEENTH SERIES. CI. A Femoral Artery and Vein, which were exposed and partly destroyed in the progress of a phagedenic ulcer. The coats of the artery, to the extent of about an inch, are completely disorganised; and two small ragged openings are visible in this portion of the vessel. Above this part of the artery, a circular indentation in its walls may be perceived, which was occasioned by a ligature placed around it in consequence of hemorrhage from the openings just mentioned. A portion of the vein is obliterated, and its cavity below the obliterated part is filled by a clot of blood. The disease extended from the labia of a woman, and had destroyed a large portion of the perineum before it reached the groin. G2. The Arch of an Aorta, with the large Arteries proceeding from it, and an Aneurism of the right Carotid Artery. The aneurism involves a portion of the common carotid, with the commence- ment of the external and internal carotid arteries. The sac is filled by firm coagula. About an inch below the sac, a ligature was placed around the artery, and was not separated at the time of death. Between the ligature and the aneurism, as well as between the ligature and the origin of the subclavian artery, the whole cavity of the carotid is filled by coagulum which adheres firmly to its sides. The aorta presents a tuber- culated appearance upon its internal surface from the thickening of its inner coat and the deposit of soft matter in it. Portions of the pneumogastric and sympathetic nerves are firmly united to the aneurismal sac. The external and internal carotid arteries are closed at the point of their communication with the aneurism, but appear of healthy texture. C3. A Subclavian and Axillary Artery, the seat of Aneurism. The aneurism includes nearly three inches of the artery, and appears to be formed by dilatation of its whole circumference. The axillary plexus of nerves is connected with one side of the sac : and portions of the first and second ribs form part of its boundaries. Only half an inch of the artery intervenes between the aneurism and the cluster of branches arising from the first portion of the subclavian. For a short distance both above and below the aneurism, the coats of the artery arc thickened, andLNJURIES AND DISEASES OF ARTERIES AND VEINS. 265 soft, probably fatty, matter, is deposited in them ; but beyond these portions the arterial walls appear healthy. 64. A Femoral Artery, the inner and middle coats of which were lacerated in a case of compound fracture. The laceration ex- tends transversely round two thirds of the artery just above the origin of the profunda. The lower extremity of the artery is closed by a ligature which was placed round it a short time before death, when the limb was amputated for the other in- juries sustained in the compound fracture. 65. A Posterior Tibial Artery and Vein, which were wounded a few days before death. The wound is transverse, and extends through only one side of each vessel. The clot of blood seen in the preparation was found adhering to both vessels: the regularly circumscribed cavity in it was exactly over the division of their coats. 60. A Femoral Artery, the coats of which have abundant earthy deposits in them, and show the effects of a ligature placed round it a few days before death. The ligature was applied at a little distance from the extremity of the artery, and it has divided the inner and middle coats. For two inches above the ligature the artery is filled by coagulum. 67. A Subclavian and Axillary Artery, with part of a very large Aneurismal Sac. The aneurism occupies a part of the sub- clavian and the whole length of the axillary artery to the com- mencement of the brachial; but only a small portion of the sac is preserved connecting the two parts of the artery. Bristles are passed into the apertures of communication between the artery and the sac; both of which apertures are small, and smooth. The interior of the sac is tuberculated and wrinkled, but polished as if lined by a continuation of the internal coat of the artery : the axillary nerves are connected with its exterior. The artery is neither changed in structure nor dilated on either side of the aneurism. 08. The Abdominal Portion of the Aorta, with an Aneurism formed266 THIRTEENTH SERIES. by dilatation of the greater part of its circumference, and extending from the superior mesenteric to the iliac arteries. The walls of the sac and of the adjacent portions of the artery are thick and tuberculated ; there is a small round aperture, through which the front of the aneurism burst into the duodenum by a regular smooth-edged opening. The superior and inferior mesenteric arteries are obliterated at their origins. The aneurism had probably existed more than two years. The rupture occurred four days before death. Case-Book, Vol. i. p. 30, No. 67. Presented by John Thorn, Esq. 69. The Arch of an Aorta, with an Aneurism of its upper part and right side involving the arteria innominata. Very firm and thick laminated coagulum lines the sac, and has closed the origin of the right subclavian artery. A portion of the coagulum was found detached, and almost loose in the cavity of the aorta, as it now appears in the preparation. The trachea is slightly compressed by the sac. The patient, an elderly man, was supposed to have chronic asthma, the signs of which increased to such a degree that the trachea was opened to prevent the suffocation which seemed impending. A largo thyroid vein was opened in the operation, and the patient died. Case-Book, Vol. i. p. 39, No. 76. 70. The Arch of an Aorta, with an Aneurism at its upper part. Part of the sac is formed by the dilated artery, the coats of which terminate with an abrupt margin near the middle of the sac. The remaining part of the sac is formed by condensed cellular tissue, and the sternum. Round, deeply impressed, pits produced by absorption are visible upon the internal surface of the sternum : and one of these penetrates the bone to its external surface, and leads to an ulcerated aperture in the corresponding portions of the integuments. 71. Portion of a Vena Cava Inferior, in which there is a transverse lacerated aperture, about two inches above the iliac veins. From the same person as the ruptured bladder, Series XXIX. No. 21, and the ruptured intestine, Series XVI. No. 51. 72. An Aorta, exhibiting extensive and large circular ulcerations of its inner coat, with deposits of soft and earthy substance in its thickened tissue, and between it and the middle coat.INJURIES AND DISEASES OF ARTERIES AND VEINS. 267 73. Portion of an Abdominal Aorta, with large nodulated and granular masses of earthy matter attached to its internal surface. Around these deposits the inner membrane is thickened and opaque, and the bases of some of them are fixed on thin circular plates of earthy matter. Presented by William Gillard, Esq. 74. Portion of an Abdominal Aorta, dilated and exhibiting deposits of large masses of earthy matter on its internal surface. 7o. The Arch of an Aorta, with the Subclavian and Carotid Arteries. The right subclavian artery exhibits the remains of an aneurism which has been spontaneously cured. The aneurism appears to have been formed by dilatation of the whole circumference of a portion of the artery about two inches long. On each side of the aneurism the artery is contracted and completely closed: above the aneurism its walls appear to have coalesced ; below the aneurism its cavity is filled by lymph to the extent of nearly an inch. The inner coat of the aorta and its branches is thickened; and there are deposits of soft substance be- neath it. 76. A Foot, exhibiting enlargement and tortuosity' of the tarsal and metatarsal branches of the anterior tibial artery, in consequence of obliteration of its trunk near the ankle-joint. 77. Portion of a Vena Saphena and its branches in a varicose state. The veins are generally and uniformly dilated; their coats are thickened and rigid, so that their canal remains open ; and they have a convoluted and very tortuous course. 78. Portion of a Femoral Vein, exhibiting a partial dilatation of its coats in the form of a circumscribed pouch, projecting from one side. The pouch is lined by a continuation of the internal coat of the vein. Immediately above the pouch there are two valves in the vein, which have undergone no change. The coats of the vein are generally thickened. 79. Portion of a Vena Saphena, the walls of which are in severalTHIRTEENTH SERIES. places dilated in the form of pouches. Its coats are thickened, and there are thin chords, apparently the remains of its valves, extending across its cavity. 80. A Femoral Artery, the coats of which are made completely rigid by deposits of earthy substance. The deposits form a nearly uniform tube, in which, however, traces of an annular arrangement may be observed. 81. Portion of an Abdominal Aorta, exhibiting a large Aneurismal Sac, with a wide oval mouth, projecting from one side of the artery, and formed entirely by the dilatation of its coats. A soft white substance is deposited in irregular patches beneath the inner membrane of both the sac and the arterial walls. 82. A left Carotid Artery, with a portion of the Arch of the Aorta. A ligature was placed around the carotid artery, in the middle of its course, six weeks before death, and it had been separated without hemorrhage. A firm cylindrical clot adheres to the inside of the artery, and extends from half an inch below the situation of the ligature downwards to the aorta. A similar clot is continued upwards within the artery, from the situation of the ligature to the origin of a small branch. The extremities of the divided artery from which the ligature separated are soft and pulpy, and there was not in either of them the least adhesion of the opposite sides of the vessel. The artery was tied in the hope of curing epilepsy in an elderly gentleman, who had found that hy compressing his carotids he could avert the epileptic seizure. He died with abscess extending into the mediastinum along the sheath of the carotid and jugular vessels. 83. A Femoral Artery, the seat of Aneurism. The sac, occupying the whole inguinal portion of the artery, extends from the origin of the epigastric and circumflex iliac branches to the profunda. It is formed by a dilatation of about half the circum- ference of a portion of the artery an inch long. The coats of the artery, thickened by deposits of soft substance, opaque, and indurated, may be traced for some way upon the inside of the sac. In the rest of its extent the sac appears to be formed by269 INJURIES AND DISEASES OF ARTERIES AND VEINS. condensed cellular tissue; and its surface, at its upper part, is covered by thick laminated coagulum. Bristles are introduced into the orifices of the epigastric and circumflex iliac arteries. In the lower part of the sac are two distinct orifices, one leading to the femoral artery, the other to the profunda. The femoral vein, to the extent of two inches, is obliterated by the pressure of the aneurism. Below the obliterated part the vein is laid open to show the clots of fibrine filling its cavity. 84. The Arch of an Aorta, exhibiting an aneurism which has burst into the vena cava superior. The aneurism is formed by dilatation of the upper and posterior wall of that portion of the arch which lies between the reflection of the pericardium and the origin of the arteria innominata; its walls comprise all the coats of the artery. On both sides of the aneurismal sac the aorta has its natural size, and its internal coat appears less thickened and tuberculated than where it lines the sac. The vena cava superior is adherent to the exterior of the sac, and there is an aperture of communication between them; imme- diately around which aperture the vein and the sides of the sac are so much attenuated as to be transparent. 85. The Arch of an Aorta, with the Carotid and Subclavian Ar- teries, all generally and almost uniformly dilated, and having earthy and soft matter deposited in their coats. 86. Portion of an Aorta, with the External Iliac, Femoral, and Popliteal Artery. There was an aneurism of the popliteal artery, on account of which the femoral was tied three weeks before death. The popliteal artery is not dilated, but it pre- sents a large aperture in its coats, apparently the result of ulceration in the situation over which the aneurism was seated. A ligature was placed around the femoral artery, an inch and a half below the origin of the profunda, and had separated before death. A firm cylindrical coagulum fills the artery between the situation of the ligature and the orifice of the profunda. The divided ends of the artery are united by dense cellular tissue, but are not closed. Between the ligature and the aperture in the popliteal artery, there are several small deposits of softTHIRTEENTH SERIES. 270 yellow substance in the coats of the artery ; these increase in the lower part of the artery; the whole of its internal coat also is transversely wrinkled. Presented by J. G. Perry, Esq. 87. The Arch of an Aorta, with the Pulmonary Artery. The aorta is considerably and uniformly dilated in the whole extent of the arch. Its coats are thickened and tuberculated; and, just above one of the semilunar valves, there is a small opening which extends through the coats of the aorta into the conti- guous portion of the pulmonary artery. There is no greater dilatation of the aorta in the situation of this opening than in any other part. 88. Portion of a Brachial Artery, which was torn straight across by external violence. The patient, a gentleman sixty-nine years old, fell with his arm stretched out. At first he seemed little injured; hut pulsation was lost in the radial and ulnar arteries. In a few hours the arm hecame enormously swollen and livid, and amputation near the shoulder was performed. The brachial artery sloughed after being tied at the amputation. Case-Book, Vol. i. p. 42, No. 81. Presented by Dr. James Billett. 89. Femoral, Popliteal, and Tibial Arteries, exhibiting abundant deposits of earthy matter in their coats. In some situations, especially in the posterior tibial artery, the earthy matter occupies the whole circumference of the vessel. Its general arrangement is in narrow rings. From an aged man, in whom gangrene of the toes occurred spontaneously a short time before death. 90. A Heart, with the large Vessels attached to it, exhibiting an Aneurism of the Pulmonary Artery with a diseased state of its coats. Beneath the lining membrane of the artery there is a deposit of a white and soft substance, giving to the internal surface of the vessel a tuberculated appearance, which is especially marked in the right branch of the artery. The trunk of the pulmonary artery, from the valves to the bifurca- tion, is uniformly dilated; but its coats appear nearly healthy. Both the right and left pulmonary arteries are dilated ; and in•271 INJURIES AND DISEASES OF ARTERIES AND VEINS. one of the divisions of the left artery, which is more dilated than the rest, there is a deposit of firm fibrine, nearly filling the cavity of the dilated part. One of the divisions of the right pulmonary artery was in a similar state. The cavity of the right ventricle is dilated, and its walls are thickened. Beneath the lining of the aorta is a deposit of the same kind as that in the pulmonary artery, but less abundant. The patient was a woman fifty-three years old. She had emphysema of the lungs, and chronic bronchitis, the signs of which concealed in great measure those of the disease of the pulmonary artery. Case-Book, Vol. i. p. 82, No. 119. An External Iliac, Femoral, and Popliteal Artery, with the Femoral and Popliteal Vein, exhibiting a spontaneous Vari- cose Aneurism of the Femoral Artery and Vein, and part of an Aneurism of the posterior tibial artery. The upper piece of glass in the lower aneurismal sac is passed through the posterior tibial artery. The two lower pieces of glass are passed through the posterior tibial and peroneal arteries, both of which are continued from the lower part of the aneurism. The aneurism of the femoral artery is situated just before its passage through the tendon of the triceps femoris muscle: it is a small globular sac, formed by dilata- tion of the whole circumference of the artery. Earthy matter is deposited in the parietes of this aneurism, and it com- municates directly with the femoral vein. The interior of the vein presents a rounded opening, with thin and smooth edges, about a quarter of an inch in diameter. Around this opening the vein is closely united to the aneurism, and imme- diately below it, the cavity of the vein is obliterated to the extent of half an inch. A ligature had been placed around the femoral artery about a week before death. Immediately above the ligature is a large irregular opening in the artery, from which fatal hemorrhage took place. Around this opening, and both above and below the ligature, the whole length of the artery is uniformly dilated to the size of an abdominal aorta, and its coats are very thin. The patient was a man forty-seven years old. The aneurism of the posterior tibial artery had probably existed more than four years, that of the femoral artery about two years. The most striking sign of the disease was a peculiar purring thrill which was felt along the whole course of the femoral artery both272 THIRTEENTH SERIES. during its pulsations and in the interval" between them, but which could he stopped by pressure on the varicoBC aneurism. Long-continued pressure on this part produced, it was believed, the obliteration of the vein about six months before the patient's death. The ligature was applied to the femoral .-ut' :;, shortly after a sudden increase had taken place in the aneurism of the pos- terior tibial artery. The patient died with hemorrhage on the sixth day after the operation. The case is described by Mr. Perry, in the Medico-Cliirurgical Transactions, Vol. xx. p. 32, London, 1837. f!asc-Book, Vol. i. p. 64, No. 110. Presented by J. G. Perry, Esq. 92. Femoral, Tibial, and Peroneal Arteries, in the coats of which there is an abundant deposit of earthy matter, like that in No. 89. From an aged man, in whom mortification of the toes spontaneously occurred. 93. A long and slender branching piece of Bone, from the liver of a Sheep. It was probably formed in obliterated branches of the portal vein. 94. The Abdominal portion of an Aorta, with the Iliac Arteries, from an aged man. There is abundant deposit of both soft substance and earthy matter in the coats of all the arteries; and in the inner coat there are large irregular patches of ulce- ration. The aorta exhibits a partial dilatation just above the bifurcation. The common iliac and the internal iliac arteries, in addition to the above described alterations in their coats, are dilated into distinct pouches. 95. Femoral Vein from a Stump, amputation of the leg having been performed about three weeks before death. The vein is dilated, thickened, and indurated, and there is a deposit of lymph upon its inner surface. Only one pair of valves remain in the whole extent of the vein from Poupart's ligament down- wards ; the others, it is presumed, disappeared in the course of previous disease of the vein. The superficial veins in the leg were extensively varicose. In the amputation, on account of the hemorrhage from the vein, its extremity was tied. 96. Portion of the Spermatic Vein, from a woman in whom there was extensive medullary disease of the uterus and adjacent parts. The vein is dilated and filled by fibrinous coagulum deposited in concentric layers.INJURIES AND DISEASES OP ARTERIES AND VEINS. 273 97. Portions of a Femoral Artery and Vein. The cavity of the vein is completely filled with dry, grumous, decolorized clots of blood and lymph, inseparably adherent to its coats. Its coats are thickened and indurated. The artery appears healthy. The patient was a young man who died with disease of the spine and phthisis. About six weeks before his death, oedema of the left lower extremities, witli other signs of obliteration of the femoral vein, ensued. 98. A Splenic Artery, exhibiting a deposit of earthy matter between its coats, and a small aneurismal pouch formed by dilatation of about half its circumference. 99. Arteries of a Leg, with portions of the surrounding Muscles, from a man in whom the peroneal artery was penetrated by a knife which passed transversely into the back of the leg from the inner side. The track of the wound into the peroneal artery is shown by the piece of coloured glass. The peroneal artery is unusually large ; the posterior tibial, into which a bristle has been introduced, is very small. The ligature was placed around the posterior tibial in the operation of searching for the wounded peroneal artery. The patient died with delirium tremens a week after the ligature of the pos- terior tibial. The direction of the wound led to the supposition that the posterior tibial artery was wounded; but the knife had passed in front of it and had not injured it. Case-Book, Vol. i. p. 139, No. 163. 100. A Pulmonary Artery, with a portion of the Lung. The right branch of the pulmonary artery is completely filled by a firm coagulum of fibrine, closely adherent to its internal surface. The smaller branches are also filled by similar coagula. The portion of the coagulum in the lower part of the bottle acci- dentally separated in the examination of the body. The patient, a middle-aged lady, died suddenly during apparent convaleseence " r,LrVal °f 1 'T medU,lary tUm°Ur °f the ^ ****** i" Series 2- \ V CaS° T by Mn Paget in the Medico-CMrurgkal Trans- actions, Vol. xxvn. p. 166, London, 1844. A Femoral Artery and Vein, from a man in whom, in advanced life, gangrene of the leg spontaneously arose several months before death, and extended high up the leg. The femoral artery, in its whole extent, is made rigid by the deposit of 101 ITHIRTEENTH SERIES. 274 earthy matter in its coats, and its cavity is filled by a firm, solid, and partially laminated coagulum. The coats of the femoral vein are thickened ; portions of it are filled by firm coagulum. 102. The Arch of an Aorta, with its great branches and the pul- monary Artery. The whole of the arch is somewhat dilated, and soft matter is deposited in its coats. A small hemispherical aneurismal pouch extends from the aorta just above the right semilunar valve, compresses the pulmonary artery, and com- municates with it by an opening, through which a portion of glass is passed. Immediately around this opening the coats of the pulmonary artery are thickened. 103. The Base of a Heart, with the large vessels, the Trachea, and the Bronchial Glands. The whole of the bronchial glands are converted into one large mass of cancer, of very firm con- sistence, and a pale pinkish white colour, irregularly mixed with the ordinary black matter of the bronchial glands. Both the main bronchial tubes pass through this mass; and they are much compressed. It surrounds and compresses the pulmonary arteries and veins, and the vena cava superior. The arteria innominata and both the venae innominatae are also pressed upon by the upper part of the diseased mass. The vena cava superior is so much compressed that its canal would scarcely admit more than the bristle which is passed through it. At the junction of the venae innominatae, the cancerous structure appears to have made its way into the cavity of the vein. Near the junction of the right subclavian and internal jugular veins, beneath the valve, there is a small growth from the interior of the vein, the structure of which appears to resemble that of the large tumour. The patient was a man thirty years old. The disease was of ahout six months standing. Its progress was attended by great dyspnoea, and by enlargement of the cutaneous veins of the face, neck, and trunk, especially of those on the right side of the neck and chest. The venous current in them all ran downwards. Case-Book, Vol. i. p. 166, No. 190. 104. Portions of a Popliteal Artery and Vein. The artery was completely torn across by a wheel passing over the limb,INJURIES AND DISEASES OF ARTERIES AND VEINS. 275 and its divided extremities are separated to a distance of nearly half an inch. They are widely open. In the upper part of the artery a coagulum is formed, which almost fills its cavity: in the lower part there are only some irregularly shaped portions of fibrine. 105. Right External Iliac and Femoral Vein. The coats of the vein are much thickened, and are consolidated with the sur- rounding tissues. Its interior is rough with lymph deposited on its lining membrane. The lower and upper parts of the vein, and all the branches proceeding from it, are filled by firm coagula composed of concentric layers of fibrine. The middle portion of the vein contained only soft fibrine and a fluid resembling pus. From a young man, who died after amputation of the right arm, which was performed m consequence of traumatic gangrene. 106. The Base of a Heart, with the large vessels. Two small aneurisms have formed upon the first portion of the arch of the aorta and project into the pericardium, one above, and the other by the right side, of the trunk of the pulmonary artery Portions of coloured glass are passed from the aorta into both the aneunsmal sacs. The lower and larger of them, which opens into the aorta about half an inch above the valves has been laid open: it is nearly filled by dark laminated fibrinous coagula. The smaller sac is nearly empty. The lining membrane of all the first portion of the aorta, is thickened° uneven, and opaque white: small quantities of fatty matter are deposited in and beneath it. The aortic valves are thickened, opaque, rigid, and reduced in breadth. 107. External Pudic Veins from a Horse. The coats of the vems are sound. Within the cavity of one of them there are firm coagula of blood attached to the inner surface of the vein, by solid round cords, behind some of which bristles are passed. One of these cords extends between two of the coagula, without having any attachment to the inside of the vein. c 108. Two Coagula of Blood, which were found attached to the t 2276 TIIIRTRKNT11 SERIES inside of one of the veins dew ribed in No. 107. The section of one coagulum shows that it consists of regularly arranged layers of fibrine. The other coagulum is enclosed in three distinct cysts; of which the outer two are membranous, and the inner consists chiefly of bone. 109. Portion of an Aorta, with the Cceliac and Mesenteric Arteries, from a Horse. The cceliac artery is obliterated at its origin; it then becomes dilated into a wide pouch filled by layers of firm fibrine, in which there were several worms. (Strongulus armatus). These worms exhibited lively move- ments for a considerable period after their removal from the body. Some of them lie loose at the bottom of the bottle. 110. Part of a Heart, with the Aorta. A transverse rent extends through the inner and middle coats of the whole circumference of the aorta, about half an inch above the angles of the valves. The blood, penetrating between the coats at the tom part, has thence extended and separated the layers of the middle coat through a large portion of the arch and thoracic part of the aorta. Where the coats are thus separated, the trunks of the intercostal arteries are torn across close to their origins. The inner coat of the artery appeared opaque, and, in the thoracic portion, it is tuberculated by deposits of soft matter beneath its surface. The aortic and mitral valves are slightly opaque. The left ventricle of the heart is dilated and hypertrophied. The patient was a woman about forty-five years old. Her pulse was generally strong and full, but sbe was considered perfectly healthy. As she was carrying two pails of water, she suddenly fell down, and almost instantly expired. Two pints of blood were found in the pericardium, which had probably escaped through some aperture in the external coat of the aorta, not shown in the pre- paration. Case-Book, Vol. i. p. 57, No. 100. Presented by H. Page, Esq. 111. The Base of a Heart, with the Arch and Thoracic portions of the Aorta. About half an inch above the valves, there is an oblique rent about an inch long, extending through the inner and part of the middle coat of the aorta. The margins of the rent are soft and ragged. The blood passing through it has extended between the layers of the middle coat of the artery, throughINJURIES AND DISEASES OF ARTERIES AND VEINS. 277 the whole length and the greater portion of the circumference of the aorta, separating them and tearing across the intercostal and other small arteries. Some of the blood, coagulated, remains in the channel which it had formed for itself between the coats of the artery. The inner and middle coats of the aorta were soft, succulent, and very easily torn in any direction ; its internal surface also appears shreddy by the partial detach- ment of little portions of the inner coat. The aortic valves are healthy : but the heart was generally enlarged. The patient was a gentleman forty-five years old, who was subject to occa- sional attacks of rheumatism. While suffering with colic he was seized with syncope, which was shortly followed by signs of internal hemorrhage; and he died on the fourth day. The pulmonary artery was found to be compressed by the blood effused in the coats of the aorta. There was abundant soft deposit in the coats of the coronary arteries and the pericardium was full of blood. Presented by Dr. Theophilus Thompson. 112. The Abdominal Aorta of the same patient, showing the further separation of its coats by the diffused blood. The separation extends to the origin of the renal arteries. The inner coat of the artery is more thickened than in the preceding specimen. 113. Parts of a Heart and Aorta, exhibiting a transverse rent ex- tending round the whole circumference of the inner and middle coats of the aorta, about half an inch above the valves. The characters of this specimen closely resemble those of No. 110. The torn coats are soft, but in other respects they appear healthy. The patient was a man about twenty-five years old. He had delicate health ; but was not supposed to have any disease of the heart. He was suddenly seized while walking, with pain in the chest and faintness, and quickly died. Presented by Dr. Jeaffreson. 114. A Femoral Artery, with a Popliteal Aneurism. The artery was tied by the edge of the sartorius muscle eighteen months before death, and the aneurism was diminishing at the time of the patient's death. The femoral artery is completely ob- literated, from the situation at which the ligature was applied to the origin of the profunda. An inch and a half of the length of this part of the artery is replaced by a solid round cord ofTHIRTEENTH SERIES. •278 tough fibro-cellular tissue. Between the cord and the origin of the profunda is a firm, dry, rust-coloured clot of blood, filling and adhering to the coats of the artery. Below the cord is a similar clot half an inch in length, the lower end of which is continued into a milk-white thin layer, like the buffy coat of a clot of blood, which lines the whole length of the rest of the artery down to the aneurismal sac, and is, in its course, connected with three other decolorized clots closely attached to the arterial walls. Part of this layer has been reflected: the rest was too intimately adherent to the artery to be separated without tearing it: the coats of the part of the artery which it lines appear healthy. The mouth of the aneurismal sac is very long and narrow ; both it and the whole cavity of the sac are filled by firm, dry, laminated coagulum. The walls of the sac are thick and tuberculated: they appear to have been formed by dilatation of about one-third of the circumference of a portion of the artery an inch and a half in length. The patient was a man between fifty and sixty years old. He died with aneurism of the arch of the aorta, and abscess of the lung. 115. The Arch of an Aorta, with portions of the trachea and oesophagus. The coats of the aorta are thickened and tuber- culated ; and there are abundant deposits of fatty matter in them. It is generally dilated, and portions of it are further dilated into two aneurismal sacs. One of these is of large size and situated below, and in front of, the great branches of the arch. The other sac is at the extremity of the arch, on its convex side, just beyond the origin of the left subclavian artery. The last-mentioned sac is of small size, and projects backwards against the sides of the trachea and oesophagus. Its cavity is filled by laminated coagulum, a large portion of which also projects into the canal of the aorta. The posterior part of the sac, which was in contact with the trachea and oesophagus, has been separated from those parts and removed. The exterior of the oesophagus is healthy; but, internally, it is extensively ulcerated where it was compressed, and the ulceration has exposed the rings of the trachea, so that the ends of some of them project into the cavity of the oesophagus.INJURIES AND DISEASES OF ARTERIES AND VEINS. 279 116. A Common Carotid Artery, into which the smaller end of a tobacco-pipe was driven a few days before death. At the upper part of the preparation is shown a portion of a slough- ing cavity, in which the wounded part of the artery is involved and from which the external and internal carotid arteries pro- ceed. Below this part, the canal of the artery is filled by a large dry clot extending from the wound to a ligature placed around the trunk of the common carotid. Below the ligature a similar clot fills the trunk to within half an inch of the division of the arteria innominata. The patient was a young man. The tobacco pipe was accidentally driven through the tonsil into the artery at the angle of its bifurcation. He supposed that he had completely withdrawn it; but a portion of the pipe, an inch long, remained in the wound, closing the orifice which it had made in the artery, and preventing hemorrhage. Extensive suppuration followed, in the course of which hemorrhage ensued. The trunk of the artery was tied seven days after the accident; but hemorrhage recurred twice, and the patient died four days and a half after the application of the ligature. The case is related by Mr. Vincent, in the Medico-CMrurgical Transactions, Vol. xxix. London, 1846. 117. A Femoral Vein, in which, within the length of six inches, there are seven distinct lacerations through its coats. The injury was produced by a cart-wheel passing over the thigh. The femur was not fractured, and there were but slight appearances of external injury. The patient, a middle-aged man, died with other injury received at the same time. SUB-SERIES F.

The portion of the artery between280 THIRTEENTH SERIES: SUB-SERIES P. the situation of the ligature and the axilla is in Series VIII. No. 4. The circulation was maintained chiefly through the enlargement of the supra-scapular and infra-scapnlar arteries. f. 2. A Fore-arm, exhibiting the anastomosis and enlargement of Arteries consequent on division of the radial a little above the wrist. The principal anastomosis is effected by a large artery passing from the interosseous, at the lower edge of the pronator-quadratus muscle, across the front of the radius, to the radial artery about half an inch beyond the point of its division. f. 3. A Limb in which the Femoral Artery was tied in the middle of the thigh, eleven years before death, for the cure of a popliteal aneurism. The portion of artery obliterated by the ligature is about two inches in length, and extends to the origin of the profunda. Below this obliteration the artery was found open, but contracted, to its entrance into the ham where the aneurism was situated. The injection of the ves- sels displays the collateral branches by which the circulation was continued ; these are situated chiefly at the back of the thigh and close upon the femur. f. 4. Part of a Lower Extremity in which the Femoral Artery was tied fifty years before death, for the cure of a popliteal aneurism. The portion of artery obliterated by the ligature and by the aneurism extends from the profunda downwards to the division of the popliteal. A mass of earthy matter occupies the situation of the obliterated artery in the upper part of the ham. The anastomosing vessels, by which the circulation was continued, are chiefly at the back of the thigh. This operation was performed by John Hunter, and it was the fourth case in which he tied the artery at a distance from the aneurism. The case is recorded in the " Transactions of a Society for the Improve- ment of Medical and Surgical Knowledge," Vol. i. p. 138; and in Hunter's Works, Vol.iii. p. 604, London, 1837.

Portion of a Lung, from the surface of which a layer of false membrane formed upon the pleura has been reflected. The substance of the false membrane is compact and firm ; but its free surface is shreddy. The pleura exposed by its reflection is thickened and opaque. 3. Portion of a Lung containing tumours of lobular form, white, obscurely fibrous, and as hard as cartilage. The pulmonary texture adjacent to the tumours appears healthy. The largest tumour projects beyond the surface of the lung, and has some black substance deposited in it. 4. A Right Lung. The pleura covering its upper, posterior, and lower parts is thickened, and converted into a substance re- sembling bone. 5. Portion of the left side of a Chest, with part of the Lung adherent to the heads of the ribs. The ribs are closely approximated, and the lower intercostal spaces are obliterated. Nodulated deposits of bone have been formed in the pleura costalis : some of these form wide layers ; others form irregu- lar masses, fixed to the ribs.DISEASES OF THE LUNGS, &c. 283 6. Section of the Apex of a Lung from a young person, exhibiting the deposit of tuberculous matter in the form of miliary tu- bercles—small, round, pale masses imbedded in the substance of the lung, and projecting from its torn surface. 7. Portion of a Lung, with small tubercles scattered through its substance. The lung is minutely injected, but the injection does not appear to have penetrated the tubercles. 8. Portion of a Lung, in the tissue of which a firm pale substance is deposited in irregular masses. It is believed, from the history of the case, that these are the remains of blood effused in the form of pulmonary apoplexy. Some of the blood retains its ordinary colour around the margins of the deposits; but the rest has completely lost its colour. From the same patient as No. 55 in Series XII. 9. Portion of a Lung, with small masses of tuberculous matter very thickly deposited in its substance. They have an opaque yellowish colour, and many of them exhibit minute cavities at their centres. 10. Portion of a Lung, exhibiting a circumscribed cavity lined by a layer of false membrane with a smooth inner surface. It is uncertain whether the cavity be that of an abscess of the lung, or a cavity formed between the lobes of the lung, the surfaces of which are in other parts united by false membrane. 11. Portion of a Lung, with Tubercles and enlargement of the air- cells. In some parts the air-cells appear simply enlarged; in others, small round cavities are formed by the coalescing of groups of cells. A number of such cavities are situated im- mediately beneath the pleura. 12. Portions of a Lung, in which tuberculous matter has been de- posited. In the upper portion there are numerous miliary tubercles, arranged for the most part in groups ; in the lower, there are several small irregular cavities, surrounded by similarFOURTEENTH SERIES. '284 tubercles and by tuberculous matter diffusely infiltrated in the substance of tbe lung. % ' *' 13. Portion of a Lung, exhibiting medullary substance infiltrated in large portions of its tissue. 14. Bronchial Glands, nearly the whole substance of which is re- placed by earthy matter. 15. Sections of Bronchial Glands, which are greatly enlarged, and in which the place of the natural texture is occupied by a soft medullary substance. In one of them there are large cavities in the medullary substance, which were filled with blood. The right bronchus is compressed by the diseased glands. 16. Bronchial Glands, with the bifurcation of the Trachea and the adjacent parts. The bronchial glands are much enlarged, and tuberculous matter is deposited in them. The vena cava superior is flattened, and its calibre much reduced. Both the main branches of the pulmonary artery are also much com- pressed by the enlarged glands. 17. Bronchial Glands, with the Trachea, Heart, and Large Vessels. The glands are enlarged, and soft medullary matter is exten- sively formed in them. From the same child as No. 19 in Series VI. Case-Book, Vol. i. p. 60, No. 106. 18. Portion of a Lung, in which there is a circumscribed cavity lined by a thin layer of false membrane. The surrounding substance of the lung is indurated and contracted, and contains some other similar cavities of smaller size. The pleura is much thickened and indurated, and its layers between the lobes of the lung are united. It is probable that the cavities were formed in the progress of tuberculous disease. 19. Portions of a Lung, in which masses of a firm, white, cancerous substance are irregularly deposited. Some of the small branches of the pulmonary artery are filled with a similar285 DISEASES OP TIIK LUNGS, &c. substance, which appears in them like fine ramifying lines in the substance of the lung. 20. Sections of a Lung, with large irregular masses of tuberculous matter infiltrated in its tissue. 21. The Right Lung of a child, with several large masses of a soft medullary substance, deposited in both its lobes. From the same child as No. 19, in Scries VI. and No. 17 in this Series. 22. Two Portions of a Lung, in each of which there are round masses of a firm, whitish, and, apparently, medullary substance. The pulmonary tissue surrounding them appears healthy. 23. Portion of a Lung, on which part of the Pleura Pulmonalis is distended into a large transparent sac, by air effused from rup- tured air cells. 24. Portion of a Lung, in which are several large, round, and lobulated masses of a soft, brown, medullary substance. Most of these are situated near, or project from, the surface of the lung. The substance of the lung adjacent to them appears healthy. 25. A similar specimen. 26. A similar specimen. 27. Sections of a Lung, the substance of which is rendered uniformly pale and solid, by lymph effused in acute inflammation. 28. Portion of injected Lung, with groups of miliary tubercles and masses of tuberculous infiltration. None of the injection has penetrated the tubercles. The lung was injected from the pulmonary artery. Presented hy Richard Owen, Esq. 29. Ramified and tubular portions of Lymph, which were expecto- rated. Their form and size indicate that they had been lodged in the bronchial tubes. Presented by Dr. Pardoe.286 FOURTEENTH SERIES. 30. Portion of a Lung, witli effusion of blood in its substance, constituting Pulmonary Apoplexy. The effused blood forms firm hard masses in the lung ; at the borders of which masses, as well as in other parts, the lung appears healthy. 31. Portion of a Lung dried, with a large membranous sac on its surface, the consequence of distension of the pleura, by air effused under it from ruptured air-cells. 32. Portion of a Lung, exhibiting both the Vesicular and the Sub-pleural forms of Pulmonary Emphysema. In every part there is enlargement of the air-cells. The portions in which this change has taken place in the greatest degree, are much paler than the rest of the lung, and have not collapsed. They therefore form considerable projections at the edge and on the surface of the lung. In consequence of the rupture of some of the enlarged air-cells, air has passed beneath the pleura, and has elevated portions of it in the form of round membranous sacs. 33. Section of a Lung, the whole substance of which is made solid by the infiltration of tuberculous matter. The dark spots and lines visible in the yellow tuberculous matter are produced by the small remains of the substance of the lung. There are also numerous small irregular cavities in the lung, the result of softening of the tuberculous matter and ulceration. The boundaries of these cavities are formed by the tubercle softened and broken, and by the remains of the proper substance of the lung. 34. Portion of a Lung, exhibiting an extensive destruction of its substance consequent on the formation and progress of tubercle. The walls of the large cavity which occupies the place of more than half the lung, are composed of the pulmonary tissue, in- durated, and infiltrated with tuberculous matter; and are rendered very irregular by the projection of numerous large branches of the bloodvessels, which have not been involved in the destruction of the adjacent parts. The pleura is thickened and has soft false membrane on its surface.287 DISEASES OF THE LUNGS, &.c. 35. Portion of Lung, in which there are several large tuberculous cavities, with infiltration and induration of the pulmonary tissue remaining between them. Most of the cavities are lined by false membrane in thin and imperfect layers. The pleura is thickened, and false membrane is abundantly formed upon its surface. Presented by Dr. Conquest. 36. A Lung, the lower part of which is in a state of gangrene. The gangrenous portion is pulpy, flocculent, and of brownish colour ; and there are large bloodvessels extending through it, which have resisted the destructive process. Above the gangrenous portion the lung is solid and contracted, so that the entire thick- ness of the organ is here reduced to two-thirds of an inch. Over the seat of the gangrene a large portion of false membrane has formed upon the surface of the lung. 37. Portion of Lung, with melanotic matter diffused through its substance. Presented by Dr. Norris. 38. Portion of Lung, with the Pleura covering it, and the pleura which lined the corresponding part of the chest. Both these layers of pleura are considerably thickened, especially in the lower part; and the sac of the pleura is almost completely ob- literated by the adhesions of their opposite surfaces. The patient was a woman, thirty years old, who, eighteen years before death, coughed up a large quantity of pus, which, it is presumed, had been contained in the cavity of the pleura. The corresponding side of the chest was very much contracted. Case-Book, Vol. i. p. 159, No. 185. 39. A large portion of bone-like substance, which formed in a false membrane uniting the opposite surfaces of the pleura. The patient was an old man, who had long had dyspnoea and was subject to frequent affections of the chest. 40. Apex of a Lung, from a patient who died with Pneumothorax. On the anterior surface of the lung are two oval apertures, into which portions of glass are passed, and which lead into small288 FOURTEENTH SERIES. tuberculous cavities. There is a third aperture near them, of smaller size, and partially closed by false membrane. At the upper part of the lung there is a large cavity ; and all the rest of the pulmonary tissue is occupied by tuberculous disease in different stages. 41. Section of the upper part of a Lung, in which a soft material, resembling mortar, and mixed with particles of calcareous sub- stance, has been deposited in small cavities, which, it may be presumed, were previously occupied by tuberculous matter. Sections of two cavities are seen filled with this substance ; two others have been partially emptied. The surrounding pulmonary tissue is condensed, dry, and of a dark grey colour, from the quantity of black matter deposited in it. The surface of the lung is deeply wrinkled and contracted over the remains of the cavities; and several bands of false membrane are attached to it at the same part. Prom a patient who died of a disease independent of this condition of his lungs, and from whom the specimen of partially healed tuberculous ulceration of the large intestine (Scries XVI. No. 71) was taken. 42. Portion of a Lung, with corresponding portions of pulmonary and costal pleura, from a case of empyema of long standing. The tissue of the lung is compressed. Both portions of pleura are covered by a layer of organized lymph, a line in thickness and coarsely granulated on its inner surface. The space between these layers was full of pus. 43. Portion of a Lung, in which there are several circumscribed deposits of a very firm, white and greyish, carcinomatous sub- stance. Most of the deposits are on the surface of the lung and are flattened by the resistance of the wall of the chest. They are from a quarter to half an inch in diameter and irregular in their forms. The adjacent tissue of the lung is healthy. From the same patient as the fibrous tumours of the breast, Scries XXXA .. and No. 24 in Series XV. Case-Book, Vol. i. p. 151, No. 175. 44. Section of the upper lobe of a Lung, the texture of which has been consolidated and rendered hard, dense, and dry, by chronic inflammation. It has retained almost exactly theDISEASES OF THE LUNGS, &c. 289 character which it had in the recent state: and is throughout of a pale, dirty white colour, mottled with numerous spots of black deposit. On its cut surface it presents the appearance of numerous very minute bodies like white seeds or grains, not more than one-sixth or one-eighth of a line in length, which are thickly scattered throughout the consolidated substance; but the surface of the section has no generally granulated ap- pearance. From a man forty-eight years old. The signs of pneumonia had existed nearly five weeks. Case-Book, Vol. i. p. 190, No. 211. 45. Sections of the upper lobe of the Lung of a child, consolidated by inflammation. The surfaces of the sections are minutely °ra- nular, of a pale dirty yellowish white colour, except in two or three places where there are traces of effused blood, and in those parts in which spots of black matter have been deposited. Some of the branches of the pulmonary arteries are blocked up by fibrine. There are some thin deposits of firm lymph upon the surface of the pleura covering the upper section. 46. Section of a Lung, of which the whole of the lower lobe is of a pale, but rather bright, yellow colour, from the infiltration of pus. The infiltrated tissue was heavy, but soft and easily broken: and the surface of the section has no distinctly gra- nular aspect. 47. Section of a Lung, the tissue of which is solid, heavy, and of a pale yellowish white colour, from uniform infiltration of tuberculous matter. Its pleural surface is covered by a thin layer of tough false membrane with small tubercles scattered m it. 48. Portion of a Lung, in which the main division of the pulmonary artery is nearly filled by a firm, grumous, brown and red clot of blood, slightly adhering to its walls, and having all the cha- racters of a clot formed before death. At its distal end the clot div.des into four portions, which extend into and nearly fill as many branches of the pulmonary artery in which it lies. One of these portions is intimately united to the wall of the arterial branch in which it is contained. u•J90 FOURTEENTH SERIES. •19. Anotlier portion of the same Lung. A bristle is passed beneath a narrow band, formed probably by the further organization of blood coagulated during life, within the branches of the pul- monary artery. One of two such bands is attached only at its ends to the inner surface of the branch of the artery: the other is attached by nearly the whole of one of its surfaces to the angle and adjacent parts of a large branching arterial trunk. The clots are firm and pale pink, and have completely coalesced with the wall of the artery. In some of the smaller branches of the artery there are short round grumous coagula, like those described in the last preparation. The patient, a woman seventy years old, died after suffering with affection of the chest, and oedema of the lower extremities, for five weeks. Two days before her death she began to sink rapidly. The case is related by Mr. Paget, and the specimen No. 48 is figured, in the Medico-Chirurgical Transactions, Vol. xxvii. p. 170, PI. iii. fig. 3. London, 1844. 50. Dried Sections of a Lung, affected with Emphysema in an extreme degree. The lung is greatly enlarged: none of the vesicular structure remains; but in its place are large and irregular spaces with imperfect partitions formed by the re- mains of the thin layers and bands of fibro-cellular tissue which separated the pulmonary lobules. The whole of the right lung was in the same state. The left lung was emphysematous in a less degree. The patient was a middle-aged man, of whose history nothing was known except that he died with diseased liver, after having frequently passed gall- stones. 51. Dried Sections of a Lung affected with a much less degree of Emphysema. The air-cells are regular in their form and arrangement, but larger than is natural. 52. Portion of Lung, with some of the large branches of the Pul- monary Artery laid open and containing firm, dry, and cylin- drical clots of blood, which completely filled their cavities, and had probably been formed several days before death. From a man fifty years old, who, whilo suffering with only slight symptoms 01 pulmonary disease, died suddenly. The case is related by Mr. Paget, in the Medico-Chirurgical Transactions, Vol. xxviii. p. 353. London, 1845.DISEASES OF THE LUNGS, &c. <2W u 2 58. Portion of tlie lower lobe of a Lung, with cavities formed after circumscribed gangrene. The walls of the largest cavity are defined, and bounded by consolidated pulmonary tissue: they are irregular, and many small vessels are prominent on their surface. In the adjacent part of the lung are two similar cavities of smaller size. The pleura is thinly covered by organized false membrane. From a boy fifteen years old, who died a fortnight after receiving a severe com- pound fracture of the skull, which was followed by hernia cerebri. No sign of disease of the chest was observed. He had extensive suppuration between the membranes of the brain. 54. Portion of a Child's Lung, in which many bronchial tubes are dilated. The first portions of the larger tubes are of their natural size, but as they proceed in the substance of the lung, they become gradually wider; till near the surface of the lung they gradually contract, and appear to end in closed extremities! The walls of the dilated portions are thin, smooth, and not marked, as the others are, by the longitudinal elastic fibres projecting on their surface: the adjacent pulmonary tissue appears healthy. 55. Sections of a Lung, with Pulmonary Apoplexy. In some parts the effused and coagulated blood forms hard, dark, circum- scribed masses in the substance and at the borders of the lung: in other and more numerous parts, it appears like close-set, round, and oval spots or blotches of blood, in healthy pulmonary tissue J From a young man, who died with an aneurism of the arch of the aorta the sac of which communicated by threo small apertures with the trachea It' was believed that repeated small hemorrhages into the trachea had occurred during three or four days before death ; and that the blood had flowed down the bronchial tubes into the a r-nnlk oioncniai 56. Portion of Lung, in which there is an irregular oval abscess, with defined walls, smoothly lined by a thin layer of soft false mem- brane. The cavity was filled with thick yellow pus : branches of bloodvessels project upon its walls; and the surrounding substance of the lung is solid and very vascular, but not infiltrated with pus. From a man between fifty and sixty years old, who died with aneurism of the'292 FOURTEENTH SERIES. arch of the aorta. He was not supposed to have disease of the lungs. The cured popliteal aneurism in Series XIII. No. 114, was taken from the same patient. 57. A Child's Heart, with a cluster of bronchial glands greatly enlarged, indurated, infiltrated with tuberculous matter, and compressing the trachea and principal branches of the bronchi and the pulmonary arteries and veins. 58. Portion of a Lung, in which all the bronchial tubes are lined with thin layers of lymph. The adjacent substance of the lung appears ©edematous and heavy.

The ulcer is situated near the lesser arch ; its edges are smooth and abrupt, shelving towards the aperture in the peritoneal coat, which is much smaller than that in the mucous coat. The tissues immediately around the ulcer are thickened and indurated, but the rest of the stomach appears healthy.FIFTEENTH SERIES. '294 2. Portion of a Stomach, exhibiting the changes of structure consti- tuting Gelatiniform Cancer, with ulceration of its coats. There is a large and deep ulcer of circular form, the base and borders of which are formed by a thick, hard, fibrous tissue, containing minute cells filled by a clear jelly. In two situa- tions the ulcer has penetrated all the coats of the stomach. 3. A Stomach, with a large round lobular tumour at the pyloric end, and smaller tumours near it. The largest tumour is attached to the exterior of the pylorus and the adjacent parts of the stomach and duodenum. It consists of a close-textured, broken, medullary substance, intersected by white bands. Some of the other tumours project into the cavity of the pyloric portion of the stomach ; and in the corresponding part of the mucous membrane there is a large ulcer with elevated and everted edges. 4. Portion of a Stomach, exhibiting numerous small ulcers in the mucous membrane. The ulcers are from half a line to a line in diameter, round, oval, and angular in form; and some of them were, in the recent state, black, probably with effused blood. From a woman to whom small doses of arsenic had been administered for a fortnight, on account of a cutaneous affection. The mucous membrane of the stomach and intestines appeared highly vascular. Case-Book, Vol. i. p. 25, No. 58. 5. The half of a Stomach, enlarged, and exhibiting general thick- ening and induration of its coats, with ulcers in the mucous membrane. In the situation of the mucous and sub-mucous coats is a layer of dense, hard, obscurely fibrous white tissue; and the inner surface of the mucous membrane has a peculiar villous or flocculent appearance. The muscular coat exhibits the appearance of vertical and branching white bands intersect- ing a thick layer of greyish firm tissue. The tissues external to the muscular coat are thickened, indurated, and consolidated with the surrounding parts. From the same person as the diseased large intestine, Series XVT. No. 23. 6. Portion of a Stomach, exhibiting a general thickening of its coats,235 INJURIES AND DISEASES OF THE STOMACH. with ulceration. The ulcer is of an oval form; its edges are smooth and abrupt; its hase is hollow, but smooth ; the tissue around it is elevated and deeply wrinkled. 7. The Pyloric portion of a Stomach, in which, immediately beneath the mucous membrane near the pylorus, there is a broad, flat, and firm spongy tumour. The thick layer of tissue, which occupies the place of the muscular coat, between the tumour and the peritoneum, is very hard, and presents the same greyish striated appearance as that in No. 5. The patient was a man thirty-nino years old. Signs of the disease had existed for six months hcforo death. Case-Book, Vol. i. p. 153, No. 176. Presented hy George Mantell, Esq. 8. The Stomach of a Child, presenting the appearances produced by digestion acting after death on the walls of the organ itself. There are four large irregular apertures through the coats at the great end and middle of the stomach. The edges of these apertures are soft and flocculent, and the remaining mucous membrane of the adjacent parts is soft, pale, and almost gelati- nous in its appearance. The child was ten years old, and died, after a short illness, with inflammation of the trachea. 9. The Stomach of a person who died in consequence of having taken Sulphuric Acid. The deep red colour, mottled with black, and extending throughout the interior of the stomach, is occasioned by blood effused from the eroded vessels and acted on by the acid. The greater part of the mucous membrane is destroyed; and the surface exposed is rough and shaggy. In the oesophagus and near the pyloric end of the stomach, portions of the mucous membrane remain, and are red, thick,' and corrugated. The duodenum of the same patient is in the next Scries, No. 45. 10. The Stomach of a person who died in consequence of having taken Oxalic Acid. The greater part of the mucous mem- brane is of a dark brown colour, and very soft. Small vessels full of black blood are in many parts traceable beneath it. In some situations it is so completely disorganized as to have296 FIFTEENTH SERIES. spontaneously separated in loose shreds. Upon the oesopha- gus, the mucous membrane is corrugated. 11. Portion of a Stomach, in which there is an aperture with a dark discoloration of the membrane around it. The discolored portion is very thin, and the aperture in its centre has ragged edges. It is uncertain whether these changes are due to ulceration, or to the action of the secretions of the stomach after death. 12. A Stomach, with a large, probably medullary, tumour grow- ing from its mucous membrane near the pylorus. The tumour is of an oval form, lobed on its surface, and consisting of a firm substance intersected by white lines. The mucous mem- brane immediately around it is thickened and indurated. From a man fifty-two years old. The disease appeared to have been four years in progress. Case-Book, Vol. i. p. 30, No. 66. Presented by William Radnor, Esq. 13. Portion of a Stomach, exhibiting attenuation, with paleness and softening, of a part of its great arch. The dark streaks in the altered portion of the stomach are produced by the blackening of the blood coagulated in its vessels. It is probable that these changes were occasioned by the action of the secretions of the stomach upon its coats after death. 14. Part of a Stomach, with small portions of the Liver and Pan- creas adherent to it. There is a large and deep oval ulcer just below and to the right of the cardiac orifice of the stomach, which has extended into the pancreas, destroying in its progress a portion of the splenic artery. A bristle is introduced into the ulcerated orifice of the artery, from which fatal hemorrhage took place into the cavity of the stomach. 15. A Stomach from a young woman, exhibiting the effects of Sulphuric Acid. There is an aperture with ragged edges, about half an inch in diameter, in the middle of the great arch of the stomach. The mucous membrane around the aperture is thickened, black, and charred by the acid. The stomach is closely contracted.INJURIES AND DISEASES OP THE STOMACH. 297 16. Section of a Stomach of very small size, and exhibiting in- creased thickness with altered structure of the several tissues between its peritoneal and mucous coats. The mucous mem- brane appears healthy; but in the place of the submucous coat is a layer, from one to three lines in thickness, of a hard, white, obscurely fibrous tissue. The place of the muscular coat is occupied by a layer of dense greyish substance, intersected by radiating white lines, and from one to three lines in thickness. The peritoneal coat appears healthy, but the subperitoneal is thickened, hard, and consolidated. From a young man. Presented by John Lawrence, Jun. Esq. 17. A Stomach, exhibiting numerous pendulous and lobulated growths, like polypi, from its mucous membrane. They appa- rently consist of a tissue similar to that of the membrane itself. The intervening parts of the mucous membrane have a peculiar villous appearance, like the interior of small intestine when the villi are distended. 18. Portions of the Stomach and (Esophagus of a middle-aged man who, it was supposed, had attempted to poison himself with laudanum. There is an extensive laceration through all the coats of the stomach a little beyond the entrance of the oesophagus; and other smaller lacerations are visible in the adjacent parts of the mucous and peritoneal coats. A large quantity of blood is effused from the lacerations into the sur- rounded tissues of the stomach. These lacerations were the effects of over-distension, the stomach-pump having been too freely used for the removal of the poison. 19. Portion of the great end of a Stomach, exhibiting a large cancerous ulcer of its coats. The arch of the colon is adherent to the diseased part, and is penetrated by the ulcer extending through it from the stomach. 20. Portion of the great end of a Stomach, exhibiting several distinct ulcers on its mucous membrane. Each ulcer is nearly circular, and has a smooth elevated surface, and a thickened margin.FIFTEENTH SERIES. '2>m The intervening portions of the mucous membrane appear healthy. 21. Portion of a Stomach, with several small oval masses of tubercu- lous matter deposited beneath its peritoneal coat. A section has been made through one of them. From a lad who died with tubercles in his lungs and in many other organs. 22. Portion of a Stomach and Duodenum. There is an irregular aperture, more than an inch in width, extending through all the coats of the stomach near the pylorus. In several other parts the peritoneal coat is irregularly torn. These injuries were produced by the crushing of the abdomen, the stomach at the time being full of food. 23. The Stomach of a young woman who died thirty hours after taking nearly an ounce of sulphuric acid. It is contracted, and, in its interior, deeply corrugated. The mucous membrane is thickened and indurated, and of a deep black and crimson colour from congestion and extravasation of blood. These effects of the acid are most distinct on the summits of the ridges formed by the corrugated mucous membrane. 24. Portion of a Stomach, in the mucous membrane of which there are numerous circular ulcers. They vary from half a line to two lines in diameter, and penetrate the whole thickness of the mucous membrane, which in the intervening spaces appears healthy. Many of them in the recent state contained points of effused blood. From a woman forty-five years old, from whom the fibrous tumours of the breast in Series XXXV. were taken. Case-Book, Vol. i. p. 151, No. 175. 25. The Pyloric portion of a Stomach, with the commencement of the Duodenum. About two inches from the pylorus, in the lesser arch of the stomach, is an ulcer which has penetrated through all the coats. In the peritoneal coat the aperture is oval, abrupt, and sharp-edged ; that in the mucous membrane has similar characters, but is much larger; the base of the ulcer tends smoothly and gradually from the aperture in the mucous, to that in the peritoneal, coat. Around dris ulcer are several ofINJURIES AND DISEASES OF THE STOMACH. 29£) smaller size and irregular in form, which have removed only the mucous memhrane. Their margins are clean and abrupt, and their bases are smooth. The intervening tissue appears healthy. 26. The Cardiac portion of a Stomach, with the lower part of the oesophagus. There are six superficial ulcers of irregular shape, and from two lines to half an inch in width, in the mucous membrane just below the cardiac orifice. Their margins are clearly defined, their bases smooth, and of a deep black colour, from blood effused in and upon them and discoloured by the action of the gastric fluid. All the adjacent textures of the stomach appear healthy. In the lower part of the oesophagus the epithelium has been removed : its bloodvessels are in many parts intensely congested, and the blood in them is deeply blackened. From an elderly man who died with granular disease of the kidneys, dropsy, and enlarged heart, without any probability of haying taken poison, and without having exhibited any remarkable signs of disease of the stomach. 27. The Stomach of a woman who died ten days after taking sulphuric acid. Part of its mucous membrane is soft and of a dirty ash-brown colour, and near its pyloric end a portion be- tween three and four inches in diameter has sloughed, and, except at one margin, has been completely separated. The slough hangs loosely; it is very soft and flocculent at its edges, and of brown and yellow colour. About the cardiac orifice of the stomach, (which is shown at the back of the preparation,) there is a rough and somewhat granulated surface, from which a layer of mucous membrane, after sloughing, completely separated. 28. Part of the (Esophagus of the same patient, exhibiting an extensively and irregularly ulcerated surface, from which a slough of the mucous membrane separated. The destruction has been most extensive in the lower part of the cesophao-us, the ulcerated and granulating surface of which was continuous with that of the cardiac orifice of the stomach, shown in the preceding preparation. Part of the slough, a portion of whichFIFTEENTH SERIES. :siio includes the whole circumference of the lining membrane of the oesophagus, is suspended in the upper part of the bottle. It is uncertain how much sulphuric acid the patient swallowed. She lived ton days, and appeared to have recovered from the effects of the poison, wher. r>he died with bronchitis. 29. Portion of the anterior wall of a Stomach, in which there is an oval ulcer, like that in No. 25. The form of the base of the ulcer indicates that it made progress from the mucous to the peritoneal coat, by several distinct steps or stages. From a girl twenty years old, who, while in apparently good health, was sud- denly attacked by acute peritonitis, and died in twenty hours. Presented by J. F. Harding, Esq.SERIES XVI.

Portion of small Intestine, beneath the peritoneal coat of which there are several round and nodulated masses of a firm pale substance. 3. Portion of small Intestine, with its Mesentery and a part of the Peritoneum from the adjacent wall of the abdomen. The peritoneum is, in every part, thickened and indurated, and its free surface is covered by a large quantity of false membrane. Each of the portions here shown is nearly an eighth of an inch in thickness, and is formed of tough, coarsely laminated tissue. 4. Portion of thickened Peritoneum, from the abdominal walls of the patient from whom the preceding specimen was taken. It is similarly thickened, and its internal surface is lined by lymph recently effused.303 INJURIES AND DISEASES OF INTESTINES, &c. 5. A large mass of Morbid Structure, which occupied the situation of the Mesenteric Glands.

Portion of small Intestine, with thick-set clusters of miliary tubercles in its peritoneal coat. The peritoneum is generally thickened, and many of the convolutions of the intestine are adherent. 7. Portion of Jejunum and two portions of Ileum. In each por- tion of intestine there is a circular constriction by which the canal is almost completely closed. At each of the con- stricted parts a deep irregular ulcer extends in a narrow band round the whole circumference of the mucous membrane. Above each of them, the intestine is widely dilated, its coats are generally thickened, and the muscular coat especially ap- pears hypertrophied. The patient, a woman thirty-seven years old, suffered for three years before death with attacks of constipation and severe pain in the abdomen. The stric- tures were about two feet distant from each other; and there was another besides the three here shown. Case-Book, Vol. i. p. 32, No. 69. Presented by John Bury, Esq. 8.

In the substance of the false membrane, as well as in the peritoneum, there are numerous miliary tubercles. 0. Portion of the Transverse Arch of a Colon, having a large tumour attached to it. The tumour occupies the place of the natural structure of the omentum, and appears to be formed by the agglutination of many small and round masses of a firm texture.304 SIXTEENTH SERIES. 11. Portion of an Ileum, exhibiting two ulcers of the mucous mem- brane. Both the ulcers extend completely round the intestine, and their margins are irregular and shreddy. 12. Portion of a Jejunum, with a tuberculous ulcer of its mucous membrane. The ulcer is of an oval form, and penetrates at one point through the coats of the intestine. There are small tubercles beneath the corresponding portion of the peri- toneum. 13. Portion of the upper part of an Ileum, exhibiting four small, but deep, ulcers in that part of the mucous membrane which is occupied by a patch of Peyer's glands. The rest of the patch is unusually developed. 14. A convolution of Jejunum. An irregular ulcer extends com- pletely through the coats of its two contiguous and adherent portions. • 15. Portion of a Jejunum, the coats of which are generally thickened.

From n patient who died with dysentery. 19. Portion of a Jejunum, with several small, disk-shaped, masses of medullary substance projecting into its canal from the sub- mucous tissue, in which they appear to have their origin. They are covered by mucous membrane. 20. The lower part of an Ileum, exhibiting enlargement and eleva- tion of the patches of Peyer's glands, with sloughing and ulceration of small portions of them. Some of the sloughs, incompletely detached, are infiltrated with faecal matter. The portions of intestine intervening between the patches appear healthy. From a patient who died with typhus fever. 21. Portion of a Colon, in which the mucous membrane is extensively and raggedly ulcerated. Large pieces of its remains hang in shreds in the cavity of the intestine. Many small distinct ulcers, also, may be seen, the result, apparently, of disease of the follicles of the intestine. From a man who died with dysentery of long continuance. The whole of the large intestines were similarly diseased. The small intestines and other ab- dominal organs were healthy. Case-Book, Vol. i. p. 23, No. 52. 22. Portion of an Ileum, exhibiting an ulcerated surface of the mu- cous membrane after the detachment of numerous sloughs like those in No. 20. From a case of typhus fever. 23. Portion of a Colon. In the greater part of its extent, the sub- mucous coat is from one to two lines in thickness, and of close fibrous texture, elevating the mucous membrane into irregular folds. The section of the muscular coat exhibits numerous white bands intersecting a dense greyish structure, the surface of which has a somewhat glistening aspect. From the same patient as No. 5 in Series XV. . Portion of a Colon, exhibiting a general thickening and induration xSIXTEENTH SERIES. 306 of the mucous membrane, with wart-like excrescences, and numerous small ulcers upon its internal surface. From tho same patient as the portion of Jejunum, No. 15, in this Scries. 25. Portion of a Colon, with Medullary Tumours projecting into its cavity. The largest of these growths forms a broad band round the whole interior of the intestine, and must have almost completely obstructed the canal. Its texture is broken and flocculent. The adjacent walls of the intestine are thickened, but their texture does not appear altered. 26. A Caecum, exhibiting a remarkable development of its follicles, the large open orifices of which are seen on every part of the surface of the mucous membrane. From the same diabetic patient as the portion of Small Intestine, No. 16. 27. Portion of a Rectum. At its lower border the mucous mem- brane is raised in folds and lobular tumours, by the hemorrhoidal enlargement of the subjacent veins. 28. A Caecum, with a portion of the abdominal walls from the right inguinal region. The anterior part of the caecum is united to the peritoneum lining the adjacent muscles ; at this part also the mucous membrane of the caecum is removed, and irregular fungous growths occupy its place. A fistulous canal, through which a quill is passed, extends from the cavity of the caecum through the middle of the growths and through the adjacent part of the abdominal walls. The patient was a man thirty-five years old. An abscess in the groin had existed, it was believed, previous to the ulceration through the ca;cum. There was similar ulceration, with fungous growths, in parts of the small intestine. Case-Book, Vol. i. p. 26, No. 59. 29. Portion of a Colon generally thickened, and exhibiting numerous minute ulcers of its mucous membrane. 30. An Appendix Cseci, in which a green-gage stone is lodged. From a child who died with acute peritonitis. The stone became lodged in the cascum four days before death, and the peritonitis commenced shortly after- wards; Case-Book, Vol. i. p. 18, No. 38.:i07 INJURIES AND DISEASES OP INTESTINES, &c. x 2 81. Portion of a Rectum, the cavity of which, at its upper part, is contracted to a quarter of an inch in diameter, without any visible change of structure. The contraction includes about an inch of the length of the intestine : it was probably occasioned by the action of the muscular fibres. 32. Portion of a Rectum, exhibiting a general thickening and indu- ration of its coats, and a very close annular stricture between two and three inches from the anus. Above the stricture the intestine is dilated, and its muscular coat is thick and strong ; below it, there is diffuse superficial ulceration of the mucous membrane. A portion of quill is passed through the strictured part. 33. A Rectum, exhibiting a contraction of its cavity which com- mences two inches above the anus, and is thence continued four or five inches upwards. The coats of the intestine are generally thickened and indurated, and the divided edges exhibit white bands intersecting a very firm substance. The cellular and adi- pose tissue around the rectum is also thickened, and is converted into a hard brawny substance, in which the posterior surfaces of the uterus, vagina, and broad ligaments are involved. 34. Portion of a Rectum. Its coats are generally and greatly thick- ened, indurated, and consolidated with each other and with the surrounding parts. Just above the anus there are numerous ulcerated apertures, with smooth edges, which lead through the walls of the rectum into short fistulous canals in the surround- ing indurated tissue. One of the canals extends beyond this tissue through the coats of the bladder into its cavity. 35. Portion of a Rectum, exhibiting a fistula, which extends from the anus upwards between the fibres of the levator ani muscle and the longitudinal muscular fibres of the intestine. A bristle is passed through the fistulous passage; it does not open into the rectum. m. Portion of a Rectum from a young person. A quill is passed through an aperture in the upper part of the intestine where it308 SIXTEENTH SERIES. is covered by peritoneum ; this aperture was made by the end of a metallic clyster-pipe. The clyster was injected into the peritoneum, and produced fatal peritonitis. 37. A Rectum from a middle-aged woman. Its mucous membrane is completely removed by ulceration, to the extent of several inches above the anus. Abscesses, which formed in the cellular and adipose tissue around the lower part of the intestine, have burst into it by several openings ; and all the adjacent tissues, as well as the coats of the rectum itself, are indurated and consoli- dated. 38. A Rectum, around the lower part of which the veins, dilated into hemorrhoidal tumours, have been filled with wax injected into the inferior mesenteric vein. 39. Soft Substances discharged per anum. Some of them resemble pieces of membrane ; others have a tubular form ; and others resemble pieces of fat. 40. Portion of an Ileum, exhibiting a broad, smooth-based ulcer of its mucous membrane, and a portion of omentum firmly adhe- rent to its exterior in the situation of the ulcer. The ulcer has the characters of one formed in typhus fever and nearly healed. 41. Mesenteric Glands enlarged and filled with a soft tuberculous substance. The superior mesenteric artery and some of its branches are imbedded among them. 42. A Rectum, in which distinct masses of soft, spongy, medullary substance have grown from the mucous membrane for about three inches above the anus. Around these masses its coats are thickened and ulcerated. 43. Portion of a Rectum with Hemorrhoids. The surfaces of the hemorrhoids are formed partly by the mucous membrane of the rectum, and partly by the external integuments thickened and raised in irregular folds around the margin of the anus.INJURIES AND DISEASES OF INTESTINES, &c. 309 44. Soft Substances, like those in No. 39, discharged per anum. 45. A Duodenum, exhibiting the effects of Sulphuric Acid. The mucous membrane is very dark with congested vessels and effused blood ; it is, in some situations, corrugated ; in others, completely destroyed. From the same patient as No. 9 in Series XVI. 46. Portion of a Rectum, with the Anus. Irregular and branched fistulous passages, whose course is indicated by bristles, extend in various directions around the exterior of the rectum, but none of them open into it. They are lined by soft and smooth membrane. The mucous follicles of the intestine are much enlarged. 47- A Rectum, exhibiting a contraction of its canal which commences an inch above the anus and is continued five inches up the intes- tine. The coats of the intestine are generally thickened, and of very dense texture ; the mucous membrane in some situations is tuberculated, and in others ulcerated. The cellular and adipose tissue around the intestine is indurated. A portion of the coats of the bladder has undergone the same change of structure as the coats of the rectum. 48. A Caecum with a portion of the Ileum, exhibiting enlargement and sloughing of the Peyer's and Solitary Glands. Many of the glands are simply enlarged ; others have sloughed with por- tions of the tissue in which they lie ; and in most instances the sloughs appear to have been in process of detachment. There are also several ulcers in the caecum and its ap- pendix. From a case of typhus fever. 49. A similar specimen. 50. Portion of a Rectum, with a Fistula extending for two inches upwards on its exterior, and then suddenly opening into its cavity. The passage is lined by a smooth membrane, like the mucous membrane of the rectum itself.310 SIXTEENTH SERIES. 51. Portion of an Ileum, exhibiting a complete transverse rupture of its coats. A thin shred alone connects its two portions. The injury was the result of external violence in the same person as the rup- tured Vena Cava, in Scries XIII. No. 71 ; and the ruptured Bladder, in Scries XXIX. No. 21. 52. A Rectum, in which there is diffuse superficial ulceration of the mucous membrane. A portion of the mucous membrane is separated from the muscular fibres, which are thickened and increased in firmness. 53. A Portion of small Intestine, in which there are groups of minute, white, and firm tubercles beneath the peritoneal coat. Presented by S. G. Lawrance, Esq. 54. Portion of the Arch of a Colon, and the great Omentum, from the same patient as the preceding specimen. The natural structure of the omentum is entirely removed, and in its place there is a firm white substance nearly an inch in thickness, and apparently consisting of an aggregate of tubercles. Distinct tubercles are, also, formed beneath the peritoneal covering of the intestine. 65. A Duodenum, with part of a Stomach. There are two oval ulcers about half an inch in diameter, and many of smaller size, in the mucous membrane of the duodenum. The two large ulcers have extended beyond the mucous membrane, and penetrated all the coats of the intestine. One of them is closed by the contiguous adherent surface of the pancreas: the other opened into the cavity of the abdomen. From a child about ten years of age, who died suddenly during the progress of recovery from a burn. Case-Book, Vol. i. p. 103, No. 131. 56. A Rectum and Urinary Bladder. Soft medullary tumours, arising from the mucous membranes of the rectum in its whole circumference, project into the cavity of the intestine, from the anus for about four inches upwards. The cellular tissue be- tween the bladder and rectum is thickened and indurated. 57. Portions of Abdominal Muscles, and of a Colon. The pen-INJURIES AND DISEASES OF INTESTINES, &c. 311 toneum lining the muscles is connected with that covering the intestine, by a newly formed membrane of considerable extent, in which many large bloodvessels are displayed by injection. 58. Portions of small Intestine, firmly united by thick layers of organized lymph, in which, as well as in the coats of the intes- tines, there is abundant formation of tuberculous matter. Presented by S. G. Lawrance, Esq. 59. A Rectum, with a portion of the sigmoid flexure of the Colon. The rectum presents an annular contraction with thickening, induration, and superficial ulceration of its coats, in the line of its junction with the colon. The contraction of the rectum was so close and firm that a finger could not be passed through it. The colon is dilated and hypertrophied. Except at the annular contraction the rectum is healthy. 60. Portion of small Intestine, with the mesentery. Numerous soft, very vascular, and flocculent, medullary tumours, of various sizes, arise from the peritoneal surface of the intestine and mesentery. The injection of the tumours shows that they chiefly consist of minute vessels. 61. Portion of a Jejunum, injected and dried. Its opposite peritoneal surfaces are adherent, and miliary tubercles are formed be- tween its coats and in the substance of the false membrane. 62. Sections of Mesenteric Glands, enlarged and nearly filled with tuberculous matter. The injection displays the vascularity of the small portions of the healthy glandular tissue which remain around the morbid deposit; but none of the injected fluid appears to have entered the tuberculous matter. From the same patient as No. 61. 63. Portions of Lymph and Mucus discharged from the intestines. 64. The Rectum of a girl twenty-five years old. Its mucous mem- brane is entirely removed by ulceration for several inchesSIXTEENTH SERIES. 312 above the anus; and above the ulcerated part it is slightly thickened. The muscular and other coats of the intestine are thicker and denser than is natural, but exhibit no morbid alteration of their tissue. 65. A Caecum, with its Appendix. The appendix is dilated and its walls are thickened. In the middle of its course there are two large ulcerated apertures penetrating its coats; which apertures, it is presumed, were the consequence of the lodge- ment of a gall-stone in its cavity. From a man thirty-eight years old. The gall-stone became lodged in the ap- pendix nine days before death : it produced peritonitis, and complete obstruction of the intestines for four days before death. Case-Book, Vol. i. p. 99, No. 129. Presented by H. Bateman, Esq. 66. Portion of small Intestine, in which, over an ulcer of the mucous membrane, tuberculous matter is deposited in small masses in the tissue beneath the peritoneum. The lymphatics proceeding from this part and ramifying between the coats of the intestine are also rilled with tuberculous matter. From a man between twenty and thirty years old. He had disease of the hip- joint of twelve years' standing, and extensive tuberculous disease of the small in- testines and several other organs. 67. Portion of a Duodenum and Stomach, from a young man. A circular ulcer with smooth abrupt margins has completely penetrated the coats of the duodenum close to the pylorus. The patient had a hernia, and the signs of peritonitis, produced by the escape of the contents of the duodenum through the ulcer, so nearly coincided with an ap- parent increase of the protrusion, that it was supposed the hernia had become strangulated. Previous to the perforation of the intestine the patient had been subject to dyspepsia. He died about fourteen hours after the commencement of the peritonitis. Case-Book, Vol. i. p. 165, No. 189. 68. Portion of a Rectum. At a distance of about three inches from the anus, the greater part of the circumference of the intestine is occupied by a firm medullary tumour, growing from beneath its mucous membrane. The mucous membrane is healthy. The tissues around that part of the rectum which is occupied by the morbid structure, are thickened and condensed. SomeINJURIES AND DISEASES OF INTESTINES, &c. 313 lymphatic glands behind the rectum are enlarged, and filled by a substance similar to that of which the tumour is composed. The patient was a woman forty years old. She died extremely emaciated, with medullary tumours in the liver and other parts. She had made no complaint leading to a suspicion of disease of the rectum. Case-Book, Vol. i. p. 170 No 194. 69. A Rectum exhibiting the effects of long continued inflamma- tion in its coats and in the tissues around them. The whole of the mucous membrane, for about nine inches above the anus, is removed, an irregular shreddy surface being exposed. On this surface there are several apertures which lead to fistulous passages in the diseased tissues. Upon the anterior aspect of the rectum there is one aperture higher up than the rest which passes through the walls of the rectum, and which opened directly into the peritoneal cavity. Through this aperture a portion of glass is passed. All the tissues around the rectum are greatly thickened and indurated. The patient, a middle-aged woman, had long suffered with symptoms of disease of the rectum, when peritonitis was excited by the formation of the aperture above described, and speedily proved fatal. The first sign of peritonitis occurred during the act of defecation. 70. A Caecum, with parts of the ascending Colon and of the abdo- minal wall from the right inguinal region. The portion of glass marks the track of a large abscess, which at one extremity communicated by two apertures with the intestine, and at the other end opened by extensive sloughing through the groin and scrotum. The edges of the apertures in the intestine are soft and shreddy: the parts adjacent to them are not thicker or harder than usual: but near the uppermost of them is a circular spot, in which the coats of the intestines are thin and soft; at this part the mucous membrane only remains : its inner surface is smooth and polished. The patient was a man thirty-eight years old. The history of the case, as well as the appearances here shown, make it probable that there was first an abscess m the iliac fossa, which, opening into the cacum, permitted the escape of fa;ces, and the consequent sloughing of the tissue extending from the iliac fossa through the groin into the scrotum. Case-Book, Vol. i. p. 174 No. 198. ' 71. Portion of a Colon, in which a large superficial ulcer has nearlySIXTEENTH SERIES. 314 cicatrized. The healed surface is contracted and irregularly wrinkled; and there are several small oval apertures in it, which have smooth margins and edges. From a patient fifty years old, in wIiobc lungs there were several masses of cal- careous substance, and dry grey tubercles, but who died of a disease independent of the condition of both the lungs and the intestines. Part of the lung is pre- served in Series XIV. No. 41. 72. Portions of a Rectum and Urinary Bladder, between which a wide communication is indicated by a piece of glass. The surface of the rectum, about eight inches from the anus, is extensively and deeply ulcerated; and at one part the ulcera- tion has spread through the thickened and indurated tissue con- necting the bladder and rectum so as to form the communica- tion just mentioned. The mucous membrane around the orifice in the bladder is thickened and covered by soft lymph. From a man, aged eighty-five, who died with asthma. He had not complained of any affection of tbe rectum or bladder till a week before his death, when he first noticed that air occasionally passed through the urethra. During the last week of his life, both air and faeces passed with his urine; the latter chiefly in small masses about as large as peas. Presented by Henry James, Esq. 73. The sigmoid flexure of a Colon, into the cavity of which an abscess opened from without. The abscess was seated in the cellular tissue connecting the outer part of the intestine with the wall of the abdomen, and a part of its cavity, which is very irregular in form, is shown at the back of the preparation. Portions of whalebone are passed through two short fistu- lous canals by which the abscess opened into the intestine. The apertures through the mucous membrane are oval and regular: their borders are sharp and even: and there is no thickening or other morbid change in the adjacent coats of the intestine. The disease was not observed during the life of the patient, who was a man about thirty years old, and died of pulmonary phthisis. The rest of the intestinal canal was healthy. 74. Portion of a Colon, from a patient who died with dysentery at the General Penitentiary, Millbank. Its mucous membrane is generally thickened and indurated: and there are numerous small, but deep, oval ulcers in it, with sharply circumscribed815 INJURIES AND DISEASES OF INTESTINES, &c. borders, which extend down to the muscular coat, and in many instances lead to more widely spread ulceration in the sub- mucous tissue. The muscular and peritoneal coats appear healthy. 75. The last eight inches of an Ileum, in which there are several large circumscribed ulcers of the mucous membrane. The ulcers are nearly circular, and from a quarter to three quarters of an inch in diameter: some have coalesced and formed large and less regular ulcers. The bases of the ulcers are smooth and level, and are formed by the circular muscular fibres of the intestine, which appear healthy ; their borders are bounded, and to a small extent overlapped, by the adjacent mucous mem- brane, which, except in being rather thickened, appears to have preserved its natural texture. It is probable, as well from the history of the case as from the characters of the specimen, that these ulcers were formed in the separation of sloughs of Peyer's glands, in the course of typhus fever, and were in progress of healing. 76. Portion of a Jejunum, in which a tuberculous ulcer has com- pletely perforated the coats, making an aperture nearly half an inch in diameter at the bottom of an ulcer of rather wider ex- tent in the mucous membrane. At the upper part of the intestine there is another ulcer, which has at one part proceeded through the muscular, as well as the mucous, coat. The peri- toneal coat of the intestine is thinly covered by soft lymph. 77. Portion of an Ileum, in which the mucous membrane is swollen and soft, and in the recent state appeared succulent, as if infiltrated with serous fluid. The patches of Peyer's glands and the solitary glands are enlarged and prominent above the surface of the mucous membrane. 78. The lower portion of the Ileum, and part of the Ceecum, from the same patient as the preceding. The ileum exhibits the same state of disease in a more advanced degree, and its mucous membrane appears very superficially ulcerated. The csecum is healthy. The patient, a lad fourteen years old, was affected with diarrhoea during an attack of bronchitis, but appeared convalescent, when, four days before his death,316 SIXTEENTH SERIES. diarrhoea again ensued, attended by severe pain and tenderness of the abdomen, constant vomiting, and fever. Case-Book, Vol. i. p. 194, No. 214. Presented by Dr. Baly. 79. Portion of an Ileum, from a case of typhus fever. Sloughs, in- cluding large portions of two patches of Peyer's glands, have heen separated, and other portions, nearly detached, hang in loose shreds into the cavity of the intestine. The surface, exposed by the separation of the sloughs, is formed by the circular muscular fibres of the intestine, which appear healthy, and is surrounded by a thin overhanging border of apparently healthy mucous membrane. Several small ulcers, remaining after the complete separation of sloughs of the solitary glands, are situated between the two principal ulcers. Presented by Dr. Hue. 80. Portion of a Colon, from a case of dysentery. Small por- tions of the surface of the mucous membrane, of various forms, are removed by ulceration. All the ulcers are situated on the free margins of the transverse folds of the mucous mem- brane, and by the sides of the lines formed by the longitudinal bands of muscular fibres. Their form is generally oval, or elongated in the direction of the transverse folds. 81. Another portion of the same Colon, from its lower part. By the extension of such ulcers as are shown in the preceding specimen, nearly the whole surface of the mucous membrane is removed. Portions of it remain hanging in shreds: and in some places the ulceration has extended to the muscular coat. The coats of the intestine were soft, easily torn, dark, and infil- trated with dirty-coloured fluid. From a patient in the Penitentiary, at Millbank. The whole length of the colon was similarly diseased; the extent of the disease increasing from the upper to the lower part. Presented by Dr. Baly. 82. Portion of a descending Colon, the canal of which is at one part suddenly reduced to a quarter of an inch in diameter. Its walls at this part are slightly thickened and indurated, and a narrow band passes across its canal, dividing into two small apertures the orifice by which the portions above and belowINJURIES AND DISEASES OF INTESTINES, &c. 317 the stricture communicate. The appearances are as if there had been an ulcer of the mucous membrane, the healing of which had been attended by contraction of the surrounding intestinal walls and adhesion of a part of its opposite surfaces. Both above and below the stricture the tissue of the colon appeared healthy: but its canal below was very small, while above it was enormously distended with faeces, and burst about two inches from the stricture. The patient was a lady about thirty years old. She had been for three years subject to occasional attacks of obstinate constipation, which were generally followed by diarrhoea. Four months before her death, the obstruction of the intestines became complete, and after this time she had no faecal evacuation. The cause of obstruction was found to be a cherry-stone which had lodged above the stricture in the colon, and completely closed the canal. Presented by Thomas Wormald, Esq. 83. A Caecum, with part of the Colon. There is a round ulcerated aperture through that wall of the caecum which was connected with the iliac fossa. On the exterior of the wall the margins of the aperture are uneven and ragged; on its interior they are smooth and clean. The portion of tissue which is attached to the exterior of the caecum around the aperture was part of the wall of a large abscess. The rest of the mucous membrane and the other coats of the caecum are healthy. The patient, an elderly man, had undergone the operation of lithotomy a week before death. Suppuration by the sides of the bladder and rectum, and all round the cavity of the pelvis, followed; and, extending into the iliac fossa under the pelvic fascia, some of the pus discharged itself through the fascia into the caecum a short time before death. 84. Portion of an Ileum, the cavity of which is distended by an oval biliary calculus, two inches and a half in length and an inch and a half in diameter. The peritoneal coat of the dis- tended part of the intestine is burst; and the other coats are thin and tense. The patient was a lady sixty-two years old, who had perfectly good health till within five days of her death, when she was affected by vomiting and constipa- tion. These were relieved on the third day, but shortly recurred, and she died tympanitic with complete intestinal obstruction. The calculus here shown had passed through a large ulcerated opening from the gall-bladder into the ileum. The other large calculus which lies loose in the bottle had passed through another ulcerated aperture into the colon, and was found in the caecum. Case-Book, Vol.i.p. 191, No. 212. Presented by John Havers, Esq.SIXTEENTH SERIES. 85. Portion of small Intestine, the peritoneal coat of which is occupied by numerous close-set groups of firm, flat, white medullary tumours. They form an uneven nodulated layer, from one to two lines in thickness. The other coats of the intestine appear healthy. 86. Portions of Stomach, Colon, and Great Omentum, from the same patient as the preceding specimen. The peritoneal coats of the stomach and colon are occupied by a similar layer of medullary substance; and in the place of the omentum is a narrow mass, an inch thick, of hard substance coarsely striated, like a congeries of small, firm, medullary tumours. The patient was a woman forty-four years old. She had abdominal pain for six months, and ascites for seven weeks, before death. Paracentesis of the abdo- men was performed four times ; and on the first occasion the fluid drawn from the abdominal cavity coagulated spontaneously. The case is recorded by Dr. Ormerod, in the Lancet, May 2, 1846, p. 504. 87. The lower portion of an Ileum, with part of a Colon, from a patient who died in an early stage of typhus fever. Patches of Peyer's glands at the end of the ileum, and many of the solitary glands in the colon, are much enlarged, soft, and promi- nent above the surrounding surface of the mucous membrane ; but there is scarcely any appearance of ulceration or sloughing. The mesenteric glands also are enlarged and soft. 88. Portion of an Ileum from a more advanced case of typhus fever. Three patches of Peyer's glands are enlarged, and small por- tions have separated by sloughing from their centres. There is also a general enlargement of the solitary glands, which project like little conical papulae from the surface of the mucous membrane. 89. Portion of a Colon, in which there are several small ulcers of the mucous membrane, remaining after the separation of sloughs in a case of typhus fever. The bases of the ulcers are formed by the circular muscular fibres of the intestine, which appears healthy; their margins are formed by thin portions of mucous membrane overhanging their bases. The intervening mucous membrane and other tissues appear healthy.INJURIES AND DISEASES OF INTESTINES, &c. 319 90. Portion of an Ileum, in which two small ulcers, like those last described, have nearly healed. The muscular coat cannot be seen at their bases; and their margins, which probably were overhanging but have united to their bases, are smooth and shelving. 91. Another portion of the same Ileum, in which are several simi- larly healed small ulcers, and one of larger size in which a further process of ulceration has extended from the middle of the base of the ulcer in the mucous membrane, through the muscular and peritoneal coats, forming an elongated oval opening by which the intestine communicated with the cavity of the abdomen. The five preceding specimens were taken from patients who died with typhus fever at Vienna. Presented hy Charles Moore, Esq. 92. Portion of an Omentum, in which, by the adhesion of two adja- cent points of its surface, an aperture or ring is formed, through which the finger might be passed. 93. The Rectum, Uterus, and Vagina of a child five years old. Ten months before the death of the child, in the endeavour to administer an enema, a clyster-pipe was forced through the adjacent walls of the rectum and vagina. At the part thus in- jured there is a small depression in the wall of the vagina, and a long, pale, and irregular cicatrix in that of the rectum. Near this cicatrix, also, there are traces of small healed ulcers of the mucous membrane of the rectum. Just below the cicatrix, at a distance of about an inch from the margin of the anus, the canal of the rectum is reduced to an eighth of an inch in diameter, and the adjacent tissues are indurated. Above this stricture the intestine is greatly dilated ; below, it is of natural size. 94. The Large Intestine of the same child, enormously distended. It contained a large bucket-full of fluid faecal matter, which had been gradually accumulating from the time of the formation of the stricture in the rectum.

Portion of a Scapula, with the Axillary Nerves and Artery, from a person in whom amputation of the arm at the shoulder-joint had been performed a considerable time before death. The several nerves are firmly united together, and their extremities form hard bulbous swellings, which are adherent in one mass to the cicatrix in the skin. 5. Portion of a Cerebrum, with the Optic Nerves and remains of the Left Eye. The cornea is opaque, and the coats of the eye are collapsed. The left optic nerve is considerably diminished in size between the diseased eye and the optic commissure. Behind the commissure, the nerve on the right side is rather smal er than that on the left; but the thalami appear to be of equal size. 6. Portion of a Cerebrum, with the Optic Nerves and the Eyes.

The extremities of the radial, ulnar, and median nerves form very dense bulb- ike swellings, two of which are closely, and one more distantly, connected with the cicatrix in the skin! 8.

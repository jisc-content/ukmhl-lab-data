INJURIES AND DISEASES OF ARTERIES AND VEINS. 267 73. Portion of an Abdominal Aorta, with large nodulated and granular masses of earthy matter attached to its internal surface. Around these deposits the inner membrane is thickened and opaque, and the bases of some of them are fixed on thin circular plates of earthy matter. Presented by William Gillard, Esq. 74. Portion of an Abdominal Aorta, dilated and exhibiting deposits of large masses of earthy matter on its internal surface. 7o. The Arch of an Aorta, with the Subclavian and Carotid Arteries. The right subclavian artery exhibits the remains of an aneurism which has been spontaneously cured. The aneurism appears to have been formed by dilatation of the whole circumference of a portion of the artery about two inches long. On each side of the aneurism the artery is contracted and completely closed: above the aneurism its walls appear to have coalesced ; below the aneurism its cavity is filled by lymph to the extent of nearly an inch. The inner coat of the aorta and its branches is thickened; and there are deposits of soft substance be- neath it. 76. A Foot, exhibiting enlargement and tortuosity' of the tarsal and metatarsal branches of the anterior tibial artery, in consequence of obliteration of its trunk near the ankle-joint. 77. Portion of a Vena Saphena and its branches in a varicose state. The veins are generally and uniformly dilated; their coats are thickened and rigid, so that their canal remains open ; and they have a convoluted and very tortuous course. 78. Portion of a Femoral Vein, exhibiting a partial dilatation of its coats in the form of a circumscribed pouch, projecting from one side. The pouch is lined by a continuation of the internal coat of the vein. Immediately above the pouch there are two valves in the vein, which have undergone no change. The coats of the vein are generally thickened. 79. Portion of a Vena Saphena, the walls of which are in several

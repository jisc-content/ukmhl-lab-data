156 THIRD SERIES: SUB-SERIES C. fracture through the shaft ol the femur, immediately above the condyles. The upper end of the bone, protruded down- wards into the popliteal space, has, in this position, become firmly and extensively united to the condyles. There is a complete osseous anchylosis of the patella to the femur, and of the condyles of the femur to the head of the tibia. c. 59. A Femur which has been fractured near the junction of its upper and middle thirds. The ends have overlapped, the upper portion uniting to the front of the lower, with a large accumulation of bone at their sides, from which also many pointed processes have arisen. There is a small flat growth of bone on the lower and posterior part of the shaft of the femur. c. 60. Sections of a Femur fractured near the middle of its shaft. The ends of the bone have overlapped, the upper portion uniting to the front of the lower. Strong pointed osseous growths project from the surface of the bone by which the fracture is repaired. The sections show that the bone by which the fracture is united is formed entirely between the adjacent surfaces of the overlapping portions. c. 61. Sections of a Humerus, which has been fractured rather below the middle of its shaft. The ends of the bones have over- lapped, and the lower portion is united by intermediate bone to the anterior surface of the upper one. The exposed me- dullary tube is, in both portions, smoothly covered in by a layer of compact bone. c. 62. A Radius and Ulna. The radius has been fractured at the middle of its shaft. The ends of the bone, projecting for- wards and inwards close to the ulna, have been smoothly united in this position. c. 63. Section of a Femur, which has been fractured near the middle of its shaft. The ends of the bone have overlapped; the upper portion uniting to the inside of the lower. The other section, showing the characters of the uniting medium, is pre- served in Series III. No. 98.

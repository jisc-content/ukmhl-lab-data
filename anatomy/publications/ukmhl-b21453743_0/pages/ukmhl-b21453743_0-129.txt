DISK ASKS OF JOINTS. 1(1!) humeri are flattened and enlarged by growths of bone around their borders ; and the glenoid cavities, enlarged in a cor- responding degree and deepened, extend backwards and inwards to the bases of the spines of the scapulae. The articular surfaces thus enlarged are mutually adapted, and are hardened, perforated, and in some parts polished and ivory-like. The changes of structure are symmetrical, except in that the articular surfaces of the right shoulder- joint are more extensively polished than those of the left. 33. The bones of a Finger. There is osseous anchylosis, with slight lateral displacement, of the bones of the first and second phalanges. 34. The bones of a Carpus, with complete osseous union of their several articular surfaces. 35. The bones of two Toes, exhibiting ulceration of their arti- cular surfaces, and growths of bone around and near their articular borders ; the effects, probably, of gout. 36. The bones of a Carpus, with two of the Metacarpal Bones. There is osseous anchylosis of the metacarpal bones with the carpus, and of the several carpal bones with each other. A fracture of one of the metacarpal bones, which has been united, but with much displacement, probably preceded the disease of the articular surfaces. 37. Portions of a Radius and Ulna. There has been ulceration of the surfaces by which they were articulated. The ulce- rated surfaces, hardened and polished, have become remark- ably grooved and adapted to each other, so that the new joint which they form may have permitted a very free movement of the radius upon the ulna. The surface by which the ulna articulated with the carpus is similarly polished : the carpal surface of the radius is healthy. 38. The Bones of a Hip-Joint, in which there have been superficial ulceration of the head of the femur, and ulceration of the acetabulum penetrating to the cavity of the pelvis.

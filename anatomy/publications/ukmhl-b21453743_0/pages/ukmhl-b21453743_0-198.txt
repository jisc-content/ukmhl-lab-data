178 FOURTH SERIFS. cervical vertebra, with the first, and with the occipital bone, having been destroyed, apparently by ulceration, the anter.or portion of the first vertebra, and the basilar portion of the occipital bone have sunk down, so that the lower margin of the first vertebra is within a line of the upper margin of the inter- vertebral substance between the second and the third; and the whole of the odontoid process of the second projects straight upwards into the cavity of the skull. The medulla oblongata is thus lifted up and stretched over the apex of the odontoid process; and, as the pons holds its connection with the basilar portion of the occipital bone, the axis of the medulla oblongata forms a right angle with the axis of the spinal chord. The displaced bones are held together by the thickened and con- solidated adjacent tissues. Their texture appears indurated, but not otherwise diseased. The patient was a woman thirty-two years old. The most prominent sign of the disease, which was of four years' duration, was a constant acute pamat the back of the neck, just below the occiput. She had some difficulty of swaUowm and used to sit with her chin on her hand, or resting on her sternum. Butshe suffered no loss of sensibility, and was able to walk on the day before her dea h.

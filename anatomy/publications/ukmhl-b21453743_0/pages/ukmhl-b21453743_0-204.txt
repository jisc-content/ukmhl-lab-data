FOURTH SERIES: SUB-SERIES D. 184 also bent and prominent in front of the symphysis pubis. The lower part of the sacrum is abruptly turned forwards, in a horizontal plane. While the inferior aperture of the pelvis is thus narrowed, the superior is of nearly natural dimensions. A section of one of the ilia shows that its tex- ture is light, spongy, and soft. Probably the patient had rickets. d. 20. A Spine, which, in the upper part of its dorsal region, is slightly curved to the right and backwards. New bone is formed on the margins of many of the vertebrae. d. 21. A Spine and Sacrum. The spine presents two lateral curves; one in the dorsal region directed to the right, the other in the inferior dorsal and lumbar region directed to the left. The changes in the form and direction of the vertebrae are similar to those shown in d. 16, but less in degree. d, 22. A Spine and Pelvis. The spine presents two lateral curves, like those in the preceding specimen. The pelvis is of natural size and form. d. 23. A Spine, with portions of the Ribs. The spine presents slight lateral curves in its dorsal region ; the superior curve is directed to the right, the inferior to the left, and they exactly compensate each other, so that the lumbar and cer- vical portions of the spine lie in the same vertical plane. The changes of form and direction of the vertebrae are as in the preceding specimens. d. 24. A Spine and Pelvis, similar to those marked d. 16. There is considerable deposit of bone enlarging and surrounding the articular processes of those vertebras which are com- prised in the concavity of the curve ; a change which may also be observed, in various degrees, in many others of the specimens of lateral curvature. r>. 25. A Spine, Thorax, and Pelvis. The middle of the dorsal region of the spine is strongly curved towards the left and

INJURIES OF BONES AND JOINTS. 51. A Knee-Joint from a young subject, with an oblique frac- ture of the Femur just above the condyles. The upper por- tion of the femur, crossing the lower portion obliquely, has been united by bone to the back part of the outer condyle. About two inches of the extremity of the upper portion of the femur protruding through the skin were sawn off during life. Inflammation extending to the knee-joint has produced absorp- tion of the articular cartilages and adhesion of the opposite parts of the joint. At the bottom of the bottle is the piece of bone which was removed by the saw. 52. A Patella, in which a vertical fracture occurred a short time before death. The tendinous covering of the anterior surface of the bone is entire. Union of the fracture has not yet com- menced. The articular cartilage is in part absorbed; but this had, probably, occurred before the fracture. 53. Shoulder-Joint, exhibiting an incomplete dislocation of the Humerus backwards. The head of the humerus, unaltered in form, rests against the posterior border of the glenoid cavity. The tendons of the supra-spinatus and infra-spinatus are de- tached from the tuberosity of the humerus, but retain their con- nexion with the capsule. The tendon of the biceps is displaced from its groove in the humerus, but retains its attachment to the glenoid cavity. The tendons of the teres minor and sub- scapulars retain their attachments to the humerus. The cap- sule of the joint is thickened. 54. Portion of a Femur, in which a fracture of the neck within the capsule occurred a short time before death. The synovial and periosteal membranes are entire on the posterior half of the neck. 55. A Shoulder-Joint, in which a complete dislocation of the Humerus occurred about a fortnight before death. The head of the humerus was found resting on the subscapular fossa, and im- mediately below the clavicle. The tendon of the biceps retains its attachments to the margin of the glenoid cavity. The

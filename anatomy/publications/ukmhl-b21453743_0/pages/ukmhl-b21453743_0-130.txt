lit) SECOND SERIESâ–  SUB-SERIES H. b. 39. The bones of an Elbow-Joint, exhibiting a complete and smooth osseous anchylosis of their articular surfaces. Tbe bones are sound in texture. b. 40. Portion of a Femur, the head of which is deformed by the flattening of its upper half and the enlargement of its border: the neck, also, is shortened. B. 41. Section of the bones of a Knee-joint, exhibiting osseous anchylosis of their articular surfaces, with displacement of the tibia. The other half of the joint is preserved in the preceding Series, No. 29. b. 42. The bones of a Hip-Joint, exhibiting an irregular, nodulated deposit of osseous substance upon the margins of the head of the femur, and of the acetabulum. The articular surfaces thus enlarged have been deprived of their cartilages, and are hardened, polished, and very irregularly and deeply per- forated. b. 43. The bones of the Hip-Joints of a man aged seventy-one, exhibiting nearly symmetrical changes of structure; the effects, probably, of chronic rheumatism. There is an irregular and very abundant deposit of osseous substance around the margins of the acetabula and upon the borders of the heads and necks of the femora. Both the width and the depth of the acetabula are thus greatly increased; their articular surfaces, as well as those of the femora, are hard and rough, and a portion of the head of one femur is polished and ivory-like. B. 44. A Humerus and a Scapula. There is a deposit of bone upon the end of the acromion, presenting an excavation on its under surface. The great tuberosity of the humerus presents a convex surface, which appears to have been adapted to, and to have moved in, the concavity on the under part of the acromion. Tt is probable, that these changes followed the destruction of the tendon of the biceps muscle, either by disease or by accidental rupture.

SECOND SERIES: SUB-SERIES B. genital, or, as the condition of the heads of the thigh bones may suggest, they may have been the consequence of ulcerative disease of the hip-joints. 49. The Bones of a Leg with the lower end of the Femur. The head of the tibia is fixed by firm osseous anchylosis to the articular surfaces of the femur and fibula. The shafts of the tibia and fibula are curved outwards. The wall of the tibia is irregularly thickened; and on the anterior and upper part, near the knee-joint, there is a rough and porous elevated surface of new bone. Over this surface there had long been an ulcer extending to the bone. . 50. A Scapula and Humerus united by bone. The head of the humerus has disappeared, and the upper part of the shaft is fixed by an irregular growth of bone to the remains of the glenoid cavity and the base of the coracoid process. The spine and inferior costa of the scapula are thickened. 8 51. Bones of a Hip-Joint. The neck of the femur is not more than half an inch long. The head is expanded and flattened into the form of a disk; its margin is very irregular; its articular surface is soft, and perforated by numerous small holes. The acetabulum is wide and shallow, in correspond- ence with the form of the head of the femur, which exactly fitted in it. The notch of the acetabulum is very large, and much of the osseous tissue adjacent to it seems to have been destroyed. B 52. A Scapula and the upper part of a Humerus diseased in the same manner as b. 44. The borders of the acromion are thickened and beset by nodules of new bone. A small portion of its inferior surface, indurated and polished, was adapted to a similar surface on the upper part of the head and the great tubercle of the humerus. Around the head of the humerus and on its tuberosities there are deposits of bone similar to those on the borders of the acromion. b. 53. A Humerus, Radius and Ulna. In consequence of chronic

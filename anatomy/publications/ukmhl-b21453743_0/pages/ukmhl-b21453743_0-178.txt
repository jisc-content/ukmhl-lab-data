THIRD SERIES: SUB-SRR1KS C. 70. A Femur, the shaft of which has been fractured very ob- liquely, from before backwards and from above downwards, a little below the trochanter minor. The fracture is firmly united, with the upper portion of the bone projecting back- wards, behind and to the outer side of the lower portion. 71. Portions of a Femur, exhibiting the union of a complicated fracture in the upper part of its shaft. The principal frac- ture appears to have extended obliquely downwards from the trochanter minor. The fracture is firmly united, the upper fragment lying in front of the lower. The cancellous texture of the bone is continuous in the united fragments. 72. Portion of a Skull, in which there has been a fracture extend- ing across the ossa nasi. The fracture has firmly united, but with lateral displacement and overlapping of the lower portions of the bones. 73. A Radius and Ulna, both of which have been fractured about three inches above their carpal ends. The ends of the bones overlapping have united in this position, with a considerable shortening and deflection towards the ulnar side. 74. A Rib which has been fractured in three distinct situationsâ€” at the angle, and in the middle of the shaft. The fractured ends are firmly united in nearly exact apposition. 75. Section of a Fibula, in which there has been a comminuted fracture about two inches above its lower end. A fragment of bone, which was separated, is firmly united to the external surface of the upper and lower portions of the shaft. The fractured ends of the shaft are not yet united; but the fragment just mentioned, being united to both, holds them together. The fracture occurred five weeks before death. 76. Portion of a Femur with the Acetabulum, exhibiting a frac- ture of the neck of the femur, which occurred fifteen years before death. The neck of the bone is absorbed. The

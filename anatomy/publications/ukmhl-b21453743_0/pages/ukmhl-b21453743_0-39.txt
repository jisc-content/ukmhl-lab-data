DISEASES OF BONE. ration of the integuments, which never perfectly healed. Case Book, vol. i. p. 154, No. 180. 76. Section of the lower part of a Tibia ; the other half of that in No. 75. It exhibits more plainly the fleshy growth from the periosteum, which is seen to retain its close connexion with the bone. 77. Portions of a Sternum and Ribs. There is a large cavity in the sternum filled by tuberculous matter. This cavity was closed in both behind and in front by a membrane, apparently the thickened periosteum, a part of which is now reflected. 78. Portion of a Tibia, exhibiting a peculiar change of structure which extends entirely through the bone. Both its walls and its internal parts are converted into a soft and crumbling sub- stance of a yellowish white colour, as if by the deposit of some morbid material, like tubercle, in softened bone. The morbid alteration does not extend quite to the articular end of the bone. The integuments, in the extent to which they correspond with the diseased bone, are thickened, indurated, and ulcerated. There is a fracture in the upper part of the diseased bone; but how this was produced is uncertain. 79. A large portion of a Skull which exfoliated after trephining. 80. Portion of a Tibia after a compound fracture, illustrating the process of exfoliation. The fractured end of the bone has perished. A deep and irregular groove has been formed round the limits of the dead bone, and a considerable deposit of osseous substance has taken place upon the contiguous living bone. 81. A similar specimen. 82. Sections of the lower part of a Tibia, in the articular end of which is a cavity, probably a chronic abscess, of the form and size of a hen's egg. This cavity is lined by a soft and vascular membrane, a line in thickness, and it contained a serous fluid. c 2

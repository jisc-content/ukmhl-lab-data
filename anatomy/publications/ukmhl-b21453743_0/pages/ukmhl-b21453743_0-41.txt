DISEASES OF BONE. 21 87. Portions of a Tibia and Fibula, which suffered Necrosis after a compound fracture. The fractured ends of both bones have overlapped, and exfoliation of the ends of the tibia has commenced. There is a superficial groove between the dead and the living bone, with an irregular deposit of new bone upon the contiguous surface of the latter. 88. The lower half of a Tibia which, like the last described, suffered Necrosis after a compound fracture. The fractured ends lay at some distance from each other, and have been united by two lateral bridges of bone extended transversely between them. The necrosed end of the upper portion is almost exfoliated, and new bone is abundantly formed on the adjacent living bone. 89. Sections of a Tibia showing the reparative results of inflamma- tion after a compound fracture. The union of the fractured ends of the bone is effected by an irregular and very abundant deposit of hard and heavy new bone ; and for a considerable space above and below the place of union, the medullary tissue is consolidated. The surrounding tissues, thickened and indu- rated, were firmly adherent to the surface of the bone above and below the place of union. A portion of the thickened tissue has been detached and turned downwards. 90. A portion of the Fibula from the same limb as the preceding. Its fractured ends overlap each other and are united by bone formed between them. 91. Sections of the stump of a Humerus, exhibiting the results of Atrophy from long disuse after amputation. Its sawn end tapers to a small cone; the walls of the shaft are less than a line in thickness, light and dry; and nearly all the osseous part of its cancellous tissue being removed, the medullary tube appears, after maceration, like a smooth-walled cavity. 92. Section of a Femur, the shaft of which was fractured about two inches below the lesser trochanter, after atrophy and soft- ening of its texture. The fractured portions have united firmly

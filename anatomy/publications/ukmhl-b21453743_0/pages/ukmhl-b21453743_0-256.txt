TWELFTH SERIES. 386 is of very large size, comprising the extent of two valves in- completely subdivided. 22. A Left Ventricle ruptured. The opening is a mere fissure through the muscular substance, at the junction of the anterior wall with the septum, near the middle of the heart. The walls of the ventricle around the opening are not thinner than in other situations: but the muscular substance is softer than is natural, and of a brown colour. There are numerous small deposits of fatty matter beneath the lining of the aorta, and of the left ventricle ; and the quantity of fat on the exterior of the heart is greater than is natural. 23. Section of a Left Ventricle, showing several small deposits of soft medullary substance between its muscular fibres. From the same person as No. 10 in Series XI. 24. Part of a Heart, exhibiting thickening and opacity of the mitral valve. The left auriculo-ventricular opening is contracted into a narrow crescentic fissure. The cavity of the left auricle is much enlarged, and its walls are thickened. The right ventricle is also dilated; but its walls are not increased in thickness. 25. Part of a Heart, with a small portion of lymph attached to the inside of the right auricle and, apparently, organized. A sec- tion has been made of the lymph, to show that it is so closely united to the lining membrane of the auricle that the boundary between them cannot be discerned. 26. Part of a Heart, exhibiting thickening, opacity, and rigidity of the mitral valve and its tendinous chords. The left auriculo- ventricular opening has the form of a narrow crescentic opening, with the horns of the crescent directed, as usual, towards the aortic valves. 27. A Left Ventricle ruptured about mid-distance between its base and apex, and near the juncture of its anterior wall with the septum. The aperture is of considerable extent; and

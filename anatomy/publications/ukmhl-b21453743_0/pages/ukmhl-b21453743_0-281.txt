INJURIES AND DISEASES OF ARTERIES AND VEINS. 261 artery. Around the opening the coats of the artery are thickened and rough; below it they appear quite healthy, but the canal of the artery is diminished by the pressure of the aneurism. The external and internal carotid arteries are pervious. The pneumogastric nerve is exposed above and below the aneurism ; in the intermediate space it could not be traced on the sac. 44. Portion of a Carotid Artery, with its external and internal branches. Just above the division, the cavity of the internal carotid is slightly dilated, and its internal coat is thickened, opaque, white on its surface, and the seat of an abundant deposit of soft, probably fatty, matter in the deeper part of its thickened substance. 45. Portion of an Abdominal Aorta, in the coats of which there is abundant deposit of fatty and earthy matter, with ulceration over the principal deposits. Between the renal and inferior mesenteric arteries the ulceration has extended through the inner and middle coats of the aorta to its outer coat, which is dilated into a small pouch. 46. Part of a Splenic Artery, with a small Aneurism formed by the dilatation of a portion of its wall. Earthy matter is depo- sited in the coats of the sac. 47. A Popliteal Artery, of which the whole circumference, in about an inch and a half of its length, is dilated into an aneurismal sac. The coats of the artery, both above and below, as well as at the seat of, the aneurismal dilatation, are thickened. 48. Part of an Abdominal Aorta, with a large Aneurism, which has extended from its posterior wall backwards through the verte- brae and ribs, and forms a large sac external to the chest by the side of the spine. 49. An Anterior Tibial Artery, in which a small lacerated aperture,

PREFACE TO THE CATALOGUE OF 1831. In the following description, the Natural and Morbid Pre- parations are arranged in the order of their situation in the Museum; an arrangement originally adopted by Mr. Aber- nethy, in conformity with the plan of his Anatomical and Physiological Lectures. The description of each specimen of Morbid Structure will be found to exhibit only the circumstances which are actually visible in it, except in the instances where the description refers to the recent state of the specimen, when its characters of colour and texture were different from those it may now possess. Whenever it could be safely inferred, from the appearances of the diseased parts, that certain processes were taking place in them at the time of death, these processes are stated. With the description of the specimens of injured and diseased bone, for example, there is an explanation of the processes by which dead bone is exfoliated, and new bone formed in its place.

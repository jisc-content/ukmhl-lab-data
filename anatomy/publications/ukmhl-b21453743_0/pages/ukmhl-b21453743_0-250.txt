â€¢280 ELEVENTH SERIES. 30. Portion of Skin from a Leg. A small circumscribed oval tumour is imbedded in the sub-cutaneous fat, and is fixed to the inferior surface of the cutis. It is composed of a pale, greyish, glistening substance intersected by white lines. The surrounding tissues appear healthy. It was removed from a middle-aged woman, and had been the Beat of very great pain. 3d. A similar specimen. Removed after death, from the leg of a young woman. 32. Portion of Skin, in which a cicatrix formed after a burn. The substance of the cicatrix is indurated and enlarged, so that it forms an oval narrow-based tumour, which projects half an inch above the surface of the skin. 33. A similar enlarged and indurated cicatrix, formed after the healing of a burn on the back of a young girl. A section shows that the cicatrix consists of a very dense tough substance, in which shining white bands are interwoven in a coarse net-work in a greyish tissue, closely resembling the substance of a fibrous tumour.

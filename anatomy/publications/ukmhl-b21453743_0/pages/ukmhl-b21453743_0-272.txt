252 THIRTEENTH SERIES. attached to it. There is a small fissure, in the side of the sac near its upper part, through which blood escaped into the pleura. The heart is healthy; but the pericardium is generally adherent to it. From the same patient as No. 7. 10. The Arch of an Aorta, generally dilated and having a large aneurismal sac, formed by a further dilatation of a portion of its anterior wall. The sac extends forwards through the sternum and costal cartilages, and formed a considerable tumour on the front of the chest. There is an abundant deposit of earthy matter in the walls of the artery, and in part of the aneurismal sac. 11. Section of the Arch of an Aorta, with an Aneurism arising from its upper part. The cavity of the sac is nearly filled by laminated coagulum. The internal membrane of the artery is thickened. The trachea is attached to the sac, and its internal membrane is elevated by the pressure of the sac against it. The sac is also closely adherent to the arteria innominata, and to the right carotid and subclavian arteries. 12. Portion of the Aneurismal Sac last described, removed to show the concentric laminated arrangement of the coagulum contained in it. 13. Portions of the Femoral, Popliteal, Tibial, and Peroneal Arteries, the coats of which, by the abundant deposit of earthy matter in them, form rigid bone-like tubes. The greater part of the de- posit is in the form of narrow rings round the artery. 14. The Arch of an Aorta, with a broad flat aneurism which, arising from its anterior wall just above the valves, has compressed, and burst into, the pulmonary artery. The internal coat of the aorta is irregularly thickened: the mouth of the sac is round and very wide. 15. The Arch of an Aorta, generally and almost uniformly dilated

63 DISEASES OF BONE. much enlarged by the formation of new bone, there are many small round and oval apertures with smooth borders, indi- cating that similar ulcers have been healed. Presented by William Beaumont, Esq. 36. Sections of a Tibia and a Fibula. The shaft of the tibia is generally enlarged and hardened. Upon its external surface there are irregular deposits of bone, sharp-edged and over- hanging. Internally it presents a nearly uniform, closely can- cellated texture, in which there is hardly a distinction between the walls and the medullary cavity. Just above the ankle- joint, in the situation of the medullary canal, there is anirregular elongated cavity communicating externally by a small round aperture, or cloaca, through the walls. It is probable there- fore that there was necrosis of a portion of cancellous tissue at this part. The fibula is thinly covered by new bone. 37. A Skull-Cap, in which there is an irregular increase in the thickness of the diploe, producing large convex elevations of the outer surface about the prominences marking the original centres of ossification of the parietal bones. The diploe is consolidated as well as thickened: the outer table is smooth and healthy; the inner table is deeply impressed by the vascular grooves. The cavity of the skull appears to have been small, especially in the parts beneath the external eleva- tions. 38. Two Tibiae and two Femora, exhibiting a considerable in- crease in the thickness and density of their walls. The sec- tion of one of the femora shows that the thickest part of the wall is composed of nearly uniform compact bone. 39. A Skull-Cap, exhibiting numerous small irregular portions of bone projecting from the internal surface of the frontal bone. The diploe in the situation of these bony projections is con- siderably thickened, and indurated: the inner table, also, in correspondence with the increase of the diploe, is carried inwards, narrowing at this part the capacity of the skull.

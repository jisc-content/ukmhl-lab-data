Case-Book, Vol.i. p. 19, No. 40. 50. Portion of a Renal Artery, with a small Aneurism. Earthy matter is deposited in the coats of the sac, and the adjacent walls of the artery appear thickened and indurated. 51. Part of the Arch of an Aorta, with an Aneurism immediately above one of the semilunar valves. The sac, which is about the size of a walnut, extended between the pulmonary artery and the aorta, and burst into the pericardium, through the opening into which a quill is introduced. The internal coat of the aorta at the angles of the other valves, as well as around the mouth of the sac, is thickened, opaque white, elevated, and tuberculated. 52. The Arch of an Aorta, with an Aneurism at its upper and posterior part, between the innominata and left carotid arteries. The sac is in great part filled by coagulum. The internal coat of the artery is generally thickened. The sac has com- pressed and burst into the trachea by a transverse rent between two of the cartilaginous rings. 53. A Popliteal Artery, with part of a large Aneurismal Sac. The upper portion of the popliteal artery is pervious to its termi- nation in the sac, into which it opens by a smooth round orifice. The lower portion of the artery is also pervious, and communicates with the sac by an opening of considerable length. The upper portion of the popliteal vein is obliterated ; the lower portion is pervious. 54. The Arch of an Aorta, with a large Aneurism just below the innominata, which has burst into the trachea and oesopha- gus. The sac is nearly filled by layers of coagulum ; and the blood passed between them and the parietes of the sac, in the direction marked by two pieces of whalebone, to the irregular apertures in the trachea and oesophagus by Which

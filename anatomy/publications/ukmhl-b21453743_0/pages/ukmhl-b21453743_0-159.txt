139 INJURIES OP BONES AND JOINTS. 101. The other half of the Hip-Joint, described No. 116, after maceration. Presented by Thomas Wormald, Esq. 102. A Hip-Joint, with the head of the Femur, and part of the acetabulum from the opposite joint, of a man who had a dis- location of the femur on the dorsum of the ilium, three years before death. The dislocation was soon reduced, and the only traces of its effects which remain are, that there is a strong band or collar of ligamentous tissue around the base of the neck of the femur at its upper part, and that a slip of the ligamentum teres is attached to the notch of the acetabulum, external to the cotyloid ligament. But with this exception, the ligamentum teres presents no sign of having been torn. Case Book, Vol. L, p. 127, No. 153. 103. Section of a Femur, in which there was an oblique fracture through the shaft near the condyles. The upper portion of the bone projects far down in front and on the inner side of the lower portion; but their adjacent surfaces are firmly united by intermediate new bone. 104. Section of a Humerus, in which a fracture of the shaft at the attachment of the deltoid muscle has been exactly united, so that both the walls and the cancellous tissue are uninterrupt- edly continuous ; and, except by a slight deviation of its axis, and a small external deposit of new bone, the situation of the fracture could hardly be discerned. 105. A Patella which has been fractured transversely, near the attachment of the ligamentum patellae. A part of the line of fracture still remains open; but in another, and smaller part, the two portions are smoothly united by firm and healthy bone. 106. Parts of two Ribs which were fractured a fortnight before death. The extremities of the fractured portions are in close contact, and are surrounded by a broad ring of callus, par-

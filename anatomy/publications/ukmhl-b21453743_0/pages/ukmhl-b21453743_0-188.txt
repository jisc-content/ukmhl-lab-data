THIRD SERIES: SUB-SERIES C. fracture was shortened about half an inch, and was inverted, the toe resting on the opposite instep. It was moveable and could be everted, but, of itself, it became again inverted. Presented by Charles Miles, Esq. 118. The Humerus of a Horse, fractured in an oblique plane from one end of the shaft to the other; but, apparently, without implicating either of the articulations. The fracture is firmly united by bone placed between the apposed fractured surfaces.

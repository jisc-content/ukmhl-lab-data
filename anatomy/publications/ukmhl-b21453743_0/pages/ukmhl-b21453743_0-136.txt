A Shoulder-Joint, exhibiting partial absorption of the head of the humerus and glenoid cavity, with flattening and a great in- crease of the width of their articular surfaces. The surfaces of the scapula and humerus which were brought into contact by the absorption are exactly adapted to each other, and are covered by a substance like cartilage, so as to form a new joint. It is probable that these changes were the consequence of disloca- tion of the humerus. 2. Portion of a Humerus, in the middle of the shaft of which fracture occurred four years before death. The ends of the bone did not unite, but are enlarged, have become accurately adapted to each other, and have acquired a hard polished surface on those portions between which there was friction during the movements of the arm. The use of the arm was so little impaired by the fracture that the patient worked as a sailor to the time of his death. Presented by P. Brendon, Esq.

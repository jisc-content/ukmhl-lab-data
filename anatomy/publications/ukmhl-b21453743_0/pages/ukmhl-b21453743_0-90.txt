FIRST SERIES: SUD-SER1ES A. tensive ulceration through a part of the parietal and tem- poral bones : the effect of strumous disease. 76. Portion of a Tibia exhibiting superficial ulceration, with a porous appearance of the surrounding bone: the result of disease like that shown in a. 50. 77. Portions of a Tibia and Fibula. A large portion of the shaft of each bone has been destroyed by ulceration, in consequence probably of some malignant disease; as in a. 74, the margins of the ulcer are abrupt, sharp, and excavated. 78. A Tibia and Fibula, A large portion of the shaft of the tibia, in its entire thickness, has been removed by malignant ulceration like that in the last-described specimen. The inferior portion of the tibia is united to the fibula by bone. The fibula is greatly thickened ; and a fracture in the middle of its shaft has firmly united. . 79. Portion of the Skull described in Nos. 248, 249, in the pre- ceding Series, upon and within which medullary tumours grew. l. 80. Five Dorsal Vertebrae, exhibiting superficial ulceration on the anterior surfaces of their bodies: the ulceration was connected with psoas abscess. v. 81. Sections of the Skull of a Maniac, with irregular, rocky, and nodulated thickening and induration of the inner table. a. 82. A Skull-Cap, exhibiting extensive tuberculated syphilitic ulcerations of the parietal bones, with thickening and harden- ing of the inner table. a 83. A Skull-Cap, exhibiting ulceration of its outer and inner tables in numerous minute holes, of which many are distinct in close set groups, but more have coalesced. There were fungous excrescences filling these minute excavations in the

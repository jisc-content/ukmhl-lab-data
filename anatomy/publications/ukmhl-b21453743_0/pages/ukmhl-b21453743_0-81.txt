61 DISEASES OE BONE. 23. Sections of a Tibia, exhibiting a circumscribed thickening and induration of its anterior wall; probably the effect of an ulcer in the investing soft parts. 24. Section of a Tibia similarly diseased. 25. A Tibia and Fibula with part of the Tarsus. The tibia and fibula are enlarged, and there are sharp-edged plates and processes of new bone upon their surfaces. The lower part of the interosseous ligament is ossified, and the os calcis, astratrulus, os naviculare, and os cuboides are all united by bone. 26. Section of a Femur, on the surface of which numerous irre- gular plates of new bone are deposited. 27. Section of a Tibia enlarged in its lower third by the external formation of new bone. The new bone is penetrated by some small irregular ulcers, probably of a syphilitic nature. 28. Portions of a Tibia and Fibula thickened in their walls, and with plates of new bone upon their external surfaces. 29. Portions of a Skull-Cap, exhibiting obliteration of many parts of the diploe, with irregular thickening and porosity of its tables, and deepening of the arterial grooves upon the internal table. 30. A Skull-Cap. Both its tables are increased in thickness and density, and its diploe is nearly all consolidated. There are appearances of healed ulcers on the opposite surfaces of the left parietal bone ; and the apertures for vessels penetrating the tables are very numerous. 31. A Skull-Cap, generally thickened and indurated, with circum- scribed deposits of new bone on several parts of its internal surface. 32. A Skull-Cap of natural thickness, but with remarkable deep- ening of the arterial grooves on its internal aspect. See also A. 74.

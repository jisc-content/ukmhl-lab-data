DISEASES OF THE LUNGS, &c. 283 6. Section of the Apex of a Lung from a young person, exhibiting the deposit of tuberculous matter in the form of miliary tu- berclesâ€”small, round, pale masses imbedded in the substance of the lung, and projecting from its torn surface. 7. Portion of a Lung, with small tubercles scattered through its substance. The lung is minutely injected, but the injection does not appear to have penetrated the tubercles. 8. Portion of a Lung, in the tissue of which a firm pale substance is deposited in irregular masses. It is believed, from the history of the case, that these are the remains of blood effused in the form of pulmonary apoplexy. Some of the blood retains its ordinary colour around the margins of the deposits; but the rest has completely lost its colour. From the same patient as No. 55 in Series XII. 9. Portion of a Lung, with small masses of tuberculous matter very thickly deposited in its substance. They have an opaque yellowish colour, and many of them exhibit minute cavities at their centres. 10. Portion of a Lung, exhibiting a circumscribed cavity lined by a layer of false membrane with a smooth inner surface. It is uncertain whether the cavity be that of an abscess of the lung, or a cavity formed between the lobes of the lung, the surfaces of which are in other parts united by false membrane. 11. Portion of a Lung, with Tubercles and enlargement of the air- cells. In some parts the air-cells appear simply enlarged; in others, small round cavities are formed by the coalescing of groups of cells. A number of such cavities are situated im- mediately beneath the pleura. 12. Portions of a Lung, in which tuberculous matter has been de- posited. In the upper portion there are numerous miliary tubercles, arranged for the most part in groups ; in the lower, there are several small irregular cavities, surrounded by similar

DISEASES OF BONE. 69 portion of the outer table of the frontal bone, with thickening of the inner table in the corresponding situation. 69. A Skull-Cap, with general thickening and induration of the frontal bone. Its outer table, like that of a. 67, is slightly tuberculated, and in one situation ulcerated; and all the ad- jacent parts appear to have been unnaturally vascular. 70. A Skull-Cap, exhibiting several distinct roundish ulcers, some of which have penetrated both its tables. They commenced in the outer table and present traces of the same annular primary form as those in a. 63. 71. A Skull-Cap, with superficial ulceration of both its tables. 72. A Skull-Cap, in which a small circumscribed ulcer of the outer table of the frontal bone has healed. There are general thickening and induration of the tables and obliteration of the diploe. 73. Portion of the Base of a Skull, exhibiting syphilitic ulceration of the palate, and the front of the alveolar process. There is also ulceration of the left malar bone, which presents the same characters as the ulceration in A. 34, and others of the preceding specimens. 74. A Skull-Cap, in which are many large ulcerated holes, oc- casioned by tumours originating in the dura mater. As in a. 64, the edges of the holes are abrupt, rough, and sharp, and the loss of substance in the diploe is a little greater than in either of the tables. Ulceration has also in one situation commenced on the exterior of the frontal bone. The grooves for the meningeal arteries, which were doubtless enlarged for the supply of blood to the tumours, are very deep, though the skull is not thickened nor otherwise diseased, except in the parts involved by the tumours. 75. The Base of a Skull, from a young subject, exhibiting ex-

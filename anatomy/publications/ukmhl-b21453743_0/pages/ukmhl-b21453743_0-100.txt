i;o FIRST SERIES: SUB SERIES A. a. 130. Two thin irregular plates of Bone, which were found in the muscles close to the Femur last described. a. 131. A Humerus, with a nodulated Osseous Tumour growing from the front and upper part of its shaft. The tumour is much narrower at the point of its connexion with the shaft than elsewhere. a. 132. A Femur, from the whole circumference of which a Tumour of very large size has arisen. It extends from the condyles to near the upper end of the bone. The small portions of the femur remaining above and below the tumour are sound. The tumour consists of bone, of a light texture and grey colour, in thin lamellae and very fine fibres, groups or masses of which being arranged in nearly parallel lines give the surface of the tumour a fibrous aspect, like pumice-stone. The tumour, probably, is of the Osteoid species, and was covered by some softer substance. 133. Sections of a Femur and an Os Innominatum, from which an Osseous Tumour of large size has arisen. The tumour has arisen principally from the Femur. It consists through- out of a very hard osseous substance with a compact surface and cancellous interior. It is divisible into lobes, and its surface is nodulated. There has been a fracture of the shaft of the femur, a little below the trochanter minor, which has firmly united. This fracture occurred before the growth of the tumour commenced. A much larger part of this tumour consisted principally of cartilaginous substance: a portion of it is preserved in the preceding series, No. 118. Cast of the limb from which the preceding specimen was taken ; No. 3. A 134. Portion of a Femur, with an Osseous Tumour growing with a long pedicle from the inner and front part of its shaft, just above the internal condyle and near the insertion of the triceps.

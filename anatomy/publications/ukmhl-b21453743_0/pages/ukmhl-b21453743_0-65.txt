45 DISEASES OF BONE. tissue of the scapula. The exterior is formed by a layer of cartilage of irregular thickness, and the whole is invested by libro-cellular tissue. Presented by W. Beaumont, Esq. 203. Section of a Tumour occupying parts of the seventh, eighth, and ninth ribs of the left side. The tumour is composed of a highly vascular medullary substance, in which there are some cells that were filled with serous fluid, and a few small masses of coagulated blood. The osseous substance of the ribs ap- peared to be expanded within the tumour, which in several parts presented small points of bone. The cartilage of one of the ribs is completely surrounded by the morbid structure, but is itself unaltered. 204. Portion of the Femur of a Child which separated in conse- quence of Necrosis. The separated portion includes the whole shaft and neck of the femur, with the exception of some small pieces of the outer layers of the shaft. The recovery of the child after the separation was complete ; the thigh was firm and not much shortened. 205. Portion of a Parietal Bone which separated in consequence of Necrosis. 206. Sections of the upper part of a Femur from a very aged woman. Its texture is remarkably soft and light, and contains an abundance of fatty matter which, in maceration, has assumed the appearance of adipocire. The walls of the Femur are at the thickest part not more than a line in thick- ness : the neck is shortened and is rather less oblique than is natural: the head is reduced in size and irregularly flattened. 207. Portions of a Humerus, Radius, and Ulna. The sections of the humerus exhibit thickening of the medullary membrane, which is in some parts upwards of a line in thickness, and presents an uneven velvet-like surface. A portion of can- cellous tissue has separated after necrosis and lies loose in the medullary cavity. A piece of glass is passed through a long

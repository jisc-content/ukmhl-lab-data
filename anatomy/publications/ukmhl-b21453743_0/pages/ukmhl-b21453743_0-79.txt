DISEASES OF BONE. 5. Two Femora, the shafts of which are generally enlarged. 6. Two Femora enlarged like the preceding. They show, as do also some of those already described, the grooves impressed on the surface of the thickened bone by the large transversely- running vessels of the periosteum. Three such grooves lying close together are seen above the inner condyle of the left femur, in one of which an artery, and in the others its asso- ciated veins, were lodged. 7. A Tibia generally enlarged. 8. A Tibia of which the middle of the shaft is enlarged by the formation of new bone on its surface ; a node is formed by an accumulation of the new bone on a part of its anterior surface. The articular portions of the bone in this, as in all the pre- ceding specimens, are healthy. 9. The Tibia of a young person, generally enlarged by the forma- tion of new bone on its surface. 10. A Tibia and Fibula partially enlarged, and presenting several nodes on their subcutaneous surfaces. The nodes consist of new bone deposited on the surface in the form of slight, gradually-rising, convex, oval elevations. 11. A Femur, Tibia, and Fibula, with thin node-like deposits of new bone on their surfaces. 12. A Tibia generally enlarged. Three small ulcerated apertures through its walls above the malleolus make it probable that the enlargement was connected either with necrosis or with syphilitic ulceration. 13. Sections of a Tibia partially enlarged, and with nodes on its anterior surface. The sections of the nodes show that the disease which constitutes them is confined to the wall of the bone. 14. A Tibia and Fibula, with large plates and processes of new

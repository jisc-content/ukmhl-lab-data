SIXTH SERIES. â€¢202 17. Portion of Cerebrum, exhibiting an abscess in the upper part of one of its hemispheres, with the dura mater which covered it. The abscess communicates with the lateral ventricle by the aperture through which a bristle is passed. The internal surface of the abscess is rough, and that of the ventricle is lined by lymph. Lymph is also deposited upon the dura mater, and there is an ulcerated aperture in it, which commu- nicated with the cavity of the abscess, and through which a bristle is passed. The patient, a child four years old, had an extensive scalp-wound of the right side, followed hy suppuration, sloughing, and exposure of the cranium. A month after the injury was received, and while all seemed proceeding favourably, the child was seized with convulsions, which were followed by partial paralysis and insensibility. By the trephine, a small quantity of matter was let out from between the skull and dura mater, but without relief; and the child died three days after the convulsions began.

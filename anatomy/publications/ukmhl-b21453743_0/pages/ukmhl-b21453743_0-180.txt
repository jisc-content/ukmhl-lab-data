TII1KD SERIES: SUB-SERIES C. situation a hollow and partly polished surface has been formed in adaptation to it. The neck of the humerus moving upon and across the inferior half of the glenoid cavity and the adjacent part of the lower border of the scapula, their oppo- site surfaces are here accurately adapted and highly po- lished : the surface of the scapula is at this part become broad and convex, while that of the humerus is deeply hollowed out. The lower part of the glenoid cavity has disappeared, being comprised in the new joint formed with the neck of the humerus. The head of the humerus is altered in its form by the irregular deposit of bone on its surface: the upper half of the glenoid cavity also is flattened and nodulated. A fracture through the middle of the shaft of the humerus has been firmly united, but with an angle directed outwards. A cast-of this shoulder, hefore the removal of the soft parts, No. 76. 80. Portion of a Femur, in which a fracture extends almost ver- tically through the trochanter major and five inches down- wards to the front of the shaft. The portions are firmly united, but with considerable interspaces, and with pro- jection of the upper portion forwards. 81. An Ulna, in which a fracture through the middle of its shaft has been exactly united, but with a small sharp process of bone growing from its outer side. 82. Section of a Clavicle, in which an oblique fracture through the middle of the shaft, has been exactly united. . 83. Section of a Skull, in which there has been a transverse and comminuted fracture of the ossa nasi. The fracture is united, with considerable lateral displacement of the lower portions of the bones. . 84. A Femur, which was fractured through the middle of its shaft. The fracture is firmly and smoothly united, with the upper portion of the bone projecting slightly forwards, and the lower portion rotated outwards.

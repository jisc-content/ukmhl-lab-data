153 INJURIES OE BONES AND JOINTS. 40. An Os Innominatum. A fracture has split the acetabulum into four portions which are widely separated. From the acetabulum, as a centre, fractures also extend through the body and ramus of the pubes ; through the ischium between its spine and tuberosity; and through the ilium, vertically to its crest, and obliquely to its anterior spine. 41. An Os Innominatum. Fracture extends in two directions through the acetabulum. The posterior wall of the aceta- bulum being separated, and held in its place by only the cotyloid ligament, permitted the head of the femur to pass upwards upon the dorsum of the ilium. 42. A Pelvis and the lower portion of a Femur, from a Boy fourteen years old. External violence has produced separation of both the sacro-iliac symphyses and of the symphysis pubis. The condyles of the femur have also been separated from the shaft at the line of their epiphytic union. 43. A Skull-Cap, in which a fracture with depression of the left parietal bone occurred many years before death. The fracture comprised a circle of bone, an inch in diameter, which was starred at its centre and surrounded by a nearly circular fissure. The fracture is united, and the depression still remains ; the centre of the depressed portion is nearly half an inch below the level of the contiguous internal sur- face of the skull. 44. A Skull, in which there have been two wounds, each about an inch and a half in length, one in the frontal, and the other in the left parietal, bone. They have both been healed. 45. A Skull-Cap, in which a fracture extending from the middle of the frontal to the posterior part of the right parietal bone has been firmly united. . A Sternum, fractured transversely through its second portion near its union with the first.

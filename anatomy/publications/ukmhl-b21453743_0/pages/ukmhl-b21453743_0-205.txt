INJURIKS AM* DISEASES OK THE SPINE. 185 backwards, and there are compensating curves to the right and forwards above and below this. The description of n. 16 will almost exactly apply to this specimen, except that in this the principal curve is directed to the left, in that, to the right; and that in this, the thorax is less flattened at its sides. d. 26. A Spine, with portions of the Ribs. The spine presents three lateral curves, of which the principal one is in the lower dorsal region, and is directed to the right and back- wards. The aorta is preserved, to show its adaptation to the altered form of the spine. d. 27. The Dorsal portion of a Spine, with an acute angular cur- vature in consequence of destruction of the bodies of five vertebrae. Together with the angular curvature, there is also lateral displacement, the superior vertebras being united to the left of the inferior. The aorta, upon the altered part of the spine, forms two very acute angles; the first, where it turns to the right, in adaptation to the lateral displacement; the second, where it resumes its downward course. c. 28. The dorsal portion of a Spine, with acute angular curvature, in consequence of destruction of the bodies of three vertebra?. The aorta, upon the altered part of the spine, forms a very acute angle, which is directed backwards, in correspondence with the angle of the spine itself. d. 29. A Spine, with a very acute angular curvature, in consequence of the destruction of the bodies of the six lower dorsal vertebrae. The vertebrae above and below the seat of disease have been firmly united with the remains of the bodies of those that were ulcerated, and with one another. d. 30. A Spine, Thorax, and Pelvis. There has been ulceration of the bodies of the lumbar vertebrae, and of the sacrum in its whole extent. Four of the bodies of the lumbar vertebra; are destroyed, and an angle is formed by the approximation of the vertebrae above and below the situation of the disease ;

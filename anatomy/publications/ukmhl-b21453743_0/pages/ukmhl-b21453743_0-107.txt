DISEASES OF BONE. 87 156. Various Bones from Cows, on all of which there are ex- ternal deposits of light, grey, porous, new bone. The deposits extend, in many cases, over the whole shaft. They are, for the most part, in thin layers, but are in some cases accumulated in thick ridges and knobs. The cows from whom they were taken were fed in meadows near some arsenic-works; and it is presumed that these changes of the hones, which were observed in many of the cows, were the results of the impregnation of the air, or of their food, with arsenic. Presented by Dr. Roupell. 157. A Scapula and part of a Humerus. The arm had been amputated long before death ; and through disuse, the bones are atrophied, but the humerus in a much greater degree than the scapula. The shaft of the humerus has less than half its natural diameter and tapers to a slender cone, at the end of which is some rough new bone. The marks of the attachments of muscles on it are nearly obliterated, and its texture is light and dry. The head of the humerus is flattened and nearly all absorbed, and there is a correspond- ing diminution and change of form in the glenoid cavity. 158. An Os Innominatum and part of a Femur. After amputa- tion through the middle of its shaft, the stump of the femur has been atrophied just as the humerus in the specimen last described: but its head and the acetabulum are unchanged. 159. The Stumps of a Tibia and Fibula after amputation just below the knee. Their medullary cavities are nearly closed by a layer of bone : and they are scarcely reduced in size ; but their texture is very light and greasy. After the amputation the stump healed; but it ulcerated afresh as often as the patient returned to his work: a second amputation was therefore per- formed, and the patient did well.

INJURIES OP BONES AND JOINTS. ],;;; c. 95. Portion of a Femur, in which there has been a fracture ex- tending through the base of the neck, and very obliquely through the trochanter major, which is split into two portions separated to some distance from each other. The fracture is firmly and smoothly united ; but the trochanter is drawn up above the level of the head of the bone. Presented by H. B. Oakes, Esq. c. 96. Portion of a Femur, in which there appears to have been a fracture extending vertically through the base of the neck. The fracture has been completely repaired; but with such a displacement of the head and neck, that they form a right angle with the shaft, and are depressed below the summit of the trochanter major. Presented by H. B. Oakes, Esq. g. 97. A Tibia and Fibula, fractured through the middle of their shafts. The fractures are firmly united, but with displace- ment of the portions, so that in each bone there is a con- siderable angle directed inwards. . 98. Portions of a Tibia, Fibula, Astragalus, and Os Calcis, from a limb in which compound fracture of the lower ends of the tibia and fibula occurred two years previous to am- putation. There is an abundant deposit of osseous substance around the fractured portions of the tibia and fibula. Two portions of bone, one belonging to the articular end of the tibia, the other comprising all that remained of the astragalus, were found loose in the cavity of the ankle-joint, and in a" deep ulcerated cavity in the lower end of the tibia. The small portion of the os calcis which remains, retains but little of the natural form of the bone. 99. An Os Innominatum, in which there appears to have been a fracture of the ramus of the ischium near the tuberosity. New bone is formed around the supposed seat of fracture. 100. Part of a Skull, in which a depression of the zygoma into the Â«emporal fossa appears to indicate that there has ben, m 2

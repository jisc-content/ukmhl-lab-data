FIRST SERIES: SUB-SERIES A. and heavy, though porous: and the adjacent cancellous tissue is nearly consolidated. 100. A Tibia, in which there has been Necrosis of a portion of the shaft and of the cancellous tissue of its lower end. New bone has been formed abundantly about the seat of the necrosis. The lower articular surface of the tibia is nearly all destroyed by ulceration. 101. A Femur, in which it is probable that there has been Necrosis of a portion of the inner wall and cancellous tissue of the lower part of the shaft. There is a large cavity in this part and by its side many smaller ones, around which the wall of the bone is thickened, porous, covered by new bone, and penetrated by an oval aperture like a cloaca. 102. Sections of a Tibia in which there has been Necrosis of a portion of the cancellous texture near its head. A portion of the dead bone was probably removed through the smooth oval aperture in the adjacent thickened wall: the rest of it is not completely separated, but a deep groove bounds it. A 103. Section of a Tibia, exhibiting superficial Necrosis of its walls. A groove has formed around the dead bone, and there is a considerable deposit of new bone upon the sur- rounding living walls. The .other half of this bone is in the preceding Series, No. 188. A 104. A Skull-Cap, in which there has been Necrosis of a large portion of both tables of the frontal and right parietal bones. A groove, beginning in the outer table and gradually deepening, has been formed around the dead bone. Two applications of the trephine were made in the dead bone, with the expectation of finding matter beneath it. The necrosis was produced by a burn. . ,05 A Skull-Cap, exhibiting extensive Necrosis, which, ap- patently, succeeded syphilitic ulceration of the outer table

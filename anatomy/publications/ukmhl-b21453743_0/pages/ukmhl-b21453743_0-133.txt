DISEASES OF JOINTS. 113 disease of the elbow-joint, the fore arm appears to have been for a long time nearly fixed in a position of extreme flexion, with the hand in extreme pronation. The articular surface of the humerus is much deformed; the internal condyle is reduced in size and pointed ; the trochlear cavity is nearly obliterated; the greater part of the articular car- tilage was removed; the external condyle has a part of its surface hardened and polished; and nodules of new bone have been deposited around the borders of the articular surface. The outer division of the greater sigmoid cavity of the ulna is hard, polished, and superficially grooved: the inner division is soft and rough as if it had been deeply ulcerated. The lesser sigmoid cavity is obliterated ; and just below its place, there is a large and deep pit in which the tubercle of the radius rested. The head of the radius is directed back- wards from the shaft. The articular surface has lost its cartilage, and new bone is deposited around a great part of its border. â€¢ The anterior border of the head of the radius, which rested on the front of the external condyle of the humerus, has formed a wide and slightly concave surface, which is covered by hard polished bone, like that on the surface of the condyle itself. The lower ends of the shafts of the radius and ulna are healthy. b. 54. Portions of an Os Innominatum and a Sacrum, exhibiting the effects of inflammation in the sacro-iliac symphysis and the posterior part of the ilium. The surface of the diseased bone is ulcerated, and around it are irregular deposits of new bone. A large circular hole is seen in the ilium, the result of necrosis of a portion of its texture. b. 55. An Os Innominatum and a Sacrum united by a bridge of bone, an inch wide, extending across the front of the right sacro- iliac symphysis. The symphysis itself appears to have been healthy. b. 56. A similar specimen ; but the bridge of bone is much wider,

104 SECOND SERIES : SUB-SERIES B. bulum is filled by bone, which has coalesced with a large arowth of new bone from the lower surface of the neck of the femur. b.2. Sections of the bones of a Hip-Joint, exhibiting complete osseous union of the head of the femur with the acetabulum. Their walls and cancellous tissues have coalesced, and are uninterruptedly continuous. The femur is fixed in extreme flexion. There are traces of healed ulceration through the bottom of the acetabulum into the pelvis. b. 3. The bones of a Hip-Joint, in which the head and neck of the femur and the brim of the acetabulum have been destroyed by ulceration. The ulcerated surfaces have healed, lhe femur was not dislocated: the remains of its neck appear to have rested in the acetabulum, and the trochanter minor m the foramen ovale. The bones are very slender, but their tissue appears healthy. B 4. The bones of a Hip-Joint, in which the head of the femur, after superficial ulceration, has been dislocated on the pos- terior border of the acetabulum, and is there firmly united bv bone. New bone has also been formed on all the adja- cent parts of the os innominatum. The acetabulum was deeply ulcerated. B. 5. The bones of a Hip-Joint, in which the head of the femur rests partly in the acetabulum and partly upon the ilium and in this situation has become firmly and smoothly uni ed by bone. In this, as in the preceding specimen, all the bones are of natural weight and hardness. B 6 The bones of a Hip-Joint, exhibiting an osseous anchylosis of the head of the femur to the ilium, similar to that shown in the preceding specimen. A thin band of bone, half an inch wide, is extended between the trochanter major and the upper part of the tuberosity of the ischium. B. 7. The bones of a Hip-Joint. The depth of the acetabulum is

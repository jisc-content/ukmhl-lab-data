SECOND SERIES: SUB-SERIES B. the femur is united by bone to the inner border of the arti- cular surface of the tibia. The rest of both the articular surfaces appears healthy. The bones are light. 15. The bones of the Knee-Joint of a young person, in which there is necrosis of part of the shaft of the femur, with ulceration of the cancellous texture extending through the epiphysis to the articular surface. 26. The bones of a Knee-Joint, light, spongy, and partially ulce- rated. What remains of the patella is united by bone to the femur, and the condyles of the femur are similarly anchylosed to the head of the tibia. 27. The lower end of a Femur, exhibiting ulceration of its wall, just above the condyles, with thickening of the surrounding bone, and superficial ulceration of the articular surface. 28. The bones of a Knee-Joint, exhibiting superficial ulceration of the articular surfaces of the femur, and very deep ulcera- tion of the head of the tibia. The bones are light, dry, and brittle. . 29. The bones of an Elbow-Joint, in which all the articular sur- faces are united and surrounded by bone. The joint is in the half-bent position. .30. Sections of the bones of an Elbow-Joint, in which there is complete osseous anchylosis between the humerus and ulna. .31. The bones of a Shoulder-Joint, in which the glenoid cavity and head of the humerus have been entirely removed by ulceration. The ulcerated surfaces have smoothly healed ; but, probably, there was no motion at the joint. ,. 32. The bones of both the Shoulder-Joints of an adult. In each joint there has been ulceration, or such absorption as occurs in chronic rheumatism, of the articular surfaces of the head of the humerus and the glenoid cavity. The heads of the

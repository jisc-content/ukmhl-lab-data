93 DISEASES OF JOINTS. head has been destroyed by ulceration. A portion of the head remains, but it is completely detached and is ulcerated on every surface. 17. A Hip-Joint, from an adult, exhibiting the effects of inflamma- tion. The cartilage covering the head of the femur is com- pletely destroyed by ulceration, and the exposed surface of bone is covered by lymph. The ligamentum teres, also, is destroyed. The head of the femur is dislocated from the acetabulum, and is drawn upwards and backwards upon the dorsum of the ilium, where it rests surrounded by a capsule formed, probably, in part by the diseased old capsule, and in part by the surrounding tissues thickened and consolidated. 18. A Hip-Joint from a child, in which, by a further progress of the inflammation shown in the preceding specimens, both the acetabulum and the whole of the head and neck of the femur have been destroyed by ulceration. 19. A Hip-Joint, in which the articular cartilage covering the acetabulum and head of the bone is completely destroyed. The exposed surfaces of bone are ulcerated, and the aceta- bulum is thereby enlarged. The ligamentum teres is also in great part destroyed; but shreds of it remain, and retain the connexion of the bones. The capsule is thickened, and its inner surface is thinly lined by lymph. 20. A Hip-Joint. In consequence, probably, of rheumatic disease, the acetabulum is greatly enlarged and has assumed an oval form. The head of the femur is enlarged and adapted in its form to the acetabulum. All the articular cartilage is removed, and the surfaces of the bones are smooth, hard, and polished. The capsule of the joint is thickened, and upon its internal surface around the neck of the femur there are several groups of slender pendulous growths. 21. A Hip-Joint, in which the head and neck of the femur have been completely absorbed. The margins of the acetabulum,

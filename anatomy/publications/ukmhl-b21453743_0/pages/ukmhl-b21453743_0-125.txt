DISEASES OF JOINTS. 105 increased by absorption of its base, and by ossification of the cotyloid ligament. The articular surface of the femur is in part removed by absorption ; and there is a rough, nodulated formation of new bone around the margin of the head and on the neck of the femur. The surfaces of the acetabulum and of the head of the femur on which absorp- tion has taken place, are rough, hard, and deeply and irregu- larly perforated, like worm-eaten wood : parts of the remains of their articular surfaces are hardened and polished. . 8. The bones of a Hip-Joint, in which there has been ulceration of the acetabulum and of the head and part of the neck of the femur. The ulcerated surfaces appear to have healed, and were closely adapted. Presented by Richard Partridge, Esq. . 9. The bones of a Hip-Joint, in which there has been ulceration of the acetabulum and of the head and neck of the femur. Osseous deposit has taken place around the neck of the femur, and in thick nodvdes upon the posterior and inferior margins of the acetabulum. The remains of the head of the femur were adapted to the surface of new bone formed on the acetabulum ; and the summit of a very large mass of new bone growing up from the upper part of the neck rested on the surface of the new bone formed behind the posterior margin of the acetabulum. 10. The bones of a Hip-Joint, in which there has been extensive ulceration of the acetabulum, and of the head, neck, and parts of the trochanters of the femur. There is necrosis of the tuberosity of the ischium and of a portion of the great trochanter: both the dead pieces of bone are surrounded by grooves of separation. An ulcerated passage extends from the acetabulum through the ischium, just above its spine ; and new bone has been formed upon the shaft of the femur and other parts adjacent to the seats of the necrosis and ulceration. 11. Sections of the bones of a Hip-Joint, in which portions of

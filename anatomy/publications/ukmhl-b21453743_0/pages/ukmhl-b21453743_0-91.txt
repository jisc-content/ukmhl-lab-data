71 DISEASES OF BONE. bones, some of which were attached to the pericranium, and others to the dura mater; but it is uncertain whether they originated in the diploe or in the membranes investing the skull. 84. Portion of a Skull, with syphilitic ulceration of the frontal bone extending into the frontal sinuses and through the inner table of the skull. 85. Portion of a Skull-Cap, in which there has been extensive absorption. In the situation of the absorption of the inner table there were scrofulous tumours upon the dura mater. There were also sores in the scalp at the part where the outer table has been absorbed. 86. Portion of a Tibia with new bone formed round the middle of its shaft, and ulceration extending through part of the new bone to its surface : the effects of syphilis. 87. A Skull with the Lower Jaw. Many distinct portions of the cranium have been removed by ulceration like that conse- quent on the growth of tumours. In some situations, the ab- sorption is confined to the diploe and outer table of the skull; in others, it extends through both tables. There has been disease in one of the articulations of the jaw, producing absorption of the articular cartilage, with a deposit of bone in the circumference, of the glenoid cavity. The corresponding condyle is in part removed by absorption; its surface is rough, except at one point, where it is highly polished, and has an ivory-like texture. In the ramus of the jaw on the same side, disease, apparently commencing in the diploe, has produced absorption of the bone at many separate and minute points. 88. A Skull-Cap, in which there is consolidation of the diploe, with increased hardness of the tables, and ulceration of the frontal and left parietal bones, consequent, probably, on the formation of matter within the diploe.

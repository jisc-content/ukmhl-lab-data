DISEASES OF BONE. 7!) borders of the aperture, as well as the surrounding surface of the bone, are smoothly healed. A necrosed portion of the occipital bone was removed about a month before the patient's death : the aperture remains with ulcerated margins. There are also irregular superficial ulcerations on the external table of both the parietal bones; and on many other parts of the skull are appearances of the bones having been unnaturally vascular. 124. Section of a Skull, exhibiting a small ivory-like Osseous Tumour with a narrow base, growing from the outer table of the frontal bone, just above the external angular process. 125. Section of a Clavicle, the scapular end of which is so en- larged after fracture that it has the appearance of a tumour. 126. The upper part of a Femur, with a bony process of a pyramidal form and about three inches in length, continued from the trochanter minor. To the extremity of this bony process the tendon of the psoas and iliacus muscles is attached. 127. The upper part of a Femur, exhibiting a bony process like that last described, which was connected with the trochanter minor by ligamentous substance. 128. A Humerus, with a broad based and sharp-edged growth of bone from the outer side of its shaft, close by the attach- ment of the deltoid muscle. 129. Sections of a Femur, and of a growth of bone from the outer side of its shaft. The growth has a broad base of attachment, and a smooth convex surface : one of its margins rises gently from the shaft, the other is sharp and over- hanging. The section shows that the growth is almost entirely formed of compact tissue, and is wholly external to the wall of the femur.

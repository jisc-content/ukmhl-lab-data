INJURIES OF BONES AND JOINTS. 149 inches below its upper end. The fracture is firmly united with some displacement of the ends of the bone, and the walls and cancellous tissue of the two portions have coalesced and become continuous. . 17. Portions of a Tibia and Fibula with the Astragalus. Both the tibia and the fibula were fractured about three inches above the malleolus, and the fracture of the tibia extends downwards into the ankle-joint. The fractures are all firmly united, with little displacement, but with much thick- ening and induration of the bones, and with osseous union of the tibia and fibula, and of both of them to the astra- galus. 18. Portions of a Tibia and Fibula, the shafts of which were fractured obliquely about three inches above the ankle. The fractures have been firmly united, but with displace- ment, the lower portion of the tibia having been carried towards the fibula. 19. Section of a Femur, which has been broken about the middle of its shaft. The two portions have overlapped considera- bly, and are united in this position. The bone forming the medium of their union has a cancellous texture, with compact walls. The medullary cavity is closed at both the fractured ends of the bone. 20. A similar specimen. 21. Sections of a Tibia and Fibula. There has been a com- pound fracture of both bones about two inches above the ankle. There is a vacancy in the tibia in the situation of the fracture, from which probably a portion of bone has been removed, and at the bottom of which there is a piece of dead bone not yet separated. A portion of the fibula also has necrosed, and is partially separated. The upper and lower fragments of the tibia have not approximated, but are united by a strong bridge, or splint, of bone behind them, and there is a firm and extensive union of the tibia to

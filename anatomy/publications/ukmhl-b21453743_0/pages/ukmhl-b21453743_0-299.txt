INJURIES AND DISEASES OF ARTERIES AND VEINS. 279 116. A Common Carotid Artery, into which the smaller end of a tobacco-pipe was driven a few days before death. At the upper part of the preparation is shown a portion of a slough- ing cavity, in which the wounded part of the artery is involved and from which the external and internal carotid arteries pro- ceed. Below this part, the canal of the artery is filled by a large dry clot extending from the wound to a ligature placed around the trunk of the common carotid. Below the ligature a similar clot fills the trunk to within half an inch of the division of the arteria innominata. The patient was a young man. The tobacco pipe was accidentally driven through the tonsil into the artery at the angle of its bifurcation. He supposed that he had completely withdrawn it; but a portion of the pipe, an inch long, remained in the wound, closing the orifice which it had made in the artery, and preventing hemorrhage. Extensive suppuration followed, in the course of which hemorrhage ensued. The trunk of the artery was tied seven days after the accident; but hemorrhage recurred twice, and the patient died four days and a half after the application of the ligature. The case is related by Mr. Vincent, in the Medico-CMrurgical Transactions, Vol. xxix. London, 1846. 117. A Femoral Vein, in which, within the length of six inches, there are seven distinct lacerations through its coats. The injury was produced by a cart-wheel passing over the thigh. The femur was not fractured, and there were but slight appearances of external injury. The patient, a middle-aged man, died with other injury received at the same time. SUB-SERIES F.

INJURIES AND DISEASES OF INTESTINES, &c. 311 toneum lining the muscles is connected with that covering the intestine, by a newly formed membrane of considerable extent, in which many large bloodvessels are displayed by injection. 58. Portions of small Intestine, firmly united by thick layers of organized lymph, in which, as well as in the coats of the intes- tines, there is abundant formation of tuberculous matter. Presented by S. G. Lawrance, Esq. 59. A Rectum, with a portion of the sigmoid flexure of the Colon. The rectum presents an annular contraction with thickening, induration, and superficial ulceration of its coats, in the line of its junction with the colon. The contraction of the rectum was so close and firm that a finger could not be passed through it. The colon is dilated and hypertrophied. Except at the annular contraction the rectum is healthy. 60. Portion of small Intestine, with the mesentery. Numerous soft, very vascular, and flocculent, medullary tumours, of various sizes, arise from the peritoneal surface of the intestine and mesentery. The injection of the tumours shows that they chiefly consist of minute vessels. 61. Portion of a Jejunum, injected and dried. Its opposite peritoneal surfaces are adherent, and miliary tubercles are formed be- tween its coats and in the substance of the false membrane. 62. Sections of Mesenteric Glands, enlarged and nearly filled with tuberculous matter. The injection displays the vascularity of the small portions of the healthy glandular tissue which remain around the morbid deposit; but none of the injected fluid appears to have entered the tuberculous matter. From the same patient as No. 61. 63. Portions of Lymph and Mucus discharged from the intestines. 64. The Rectum of a girl twenty-five years old. Its mucous mem- brane is entirely removed by ulceration for several inches

Skull of a Child about ten years old. The sagittal suture and the middle portions of the coronal and lambdoidal sutures are open. The parietal, and the upper portions of the frontal and occipital, bones are much larger than is natural, and very thin and light; and the inferior occipital fossae bulge out in large rounded prominences. The principal enlargement of the skull is in its posterior part. e. 2. Skull of a Girl eleven years old. The enlargement of the skull in consequence of hydrocephalus is effected by its elon- gation, and by the depression and hollowing of its base. An increase of width appears to have been prevented by the pre- mature and complete closure of the sagittal suture. The coronal suture, and that between the frontal bone and the lesser alee of the sphenoid, are wide open. The superior walls of the orbits are pressed downwards. The bones, generally, are thin and light; and in many parts of the inner table are deep depressions and foramina.

TWELFTH SKR1KS. external or reflected portion of the pericardium. The peri- cardium in the rest of its extent was firmly adherent to the heart by false membrane, which had in some parts a hardness equal to that of cartilage. The internal parts of the heart appear sound. 33. A Heart exhibiting changes of structure in several of its internal parts. The lining membrane of the right auricle is thickened and opaque; and that of the left auricle has under- gone the same changes in a much greater degree. The tri- cuspid, mitral, and aortic valves are thickened. The mitral valve is hard and rigid, and earthy matter is deposited along its free margin. The free margins of the aortic valves also are very thick, round, and re-curved. The cavity of the left auricle is enlarged; and upon its internal surface, near the appendix, was a mass of fibrine, on the removal of which the membrane beneath was found rough and otherwise changed. Both the ventricles also are enlarged; but their walls are not proportionately thickened. 34. The Heart of a Child eight months old, with an abundant recent deposit of lymph over the whole free surface of the pericardium. The external portion of the pericardium is thickened. The heart is not enlarged. Case-Book, Vol. i. p. 38, No. 73. 35. Portion of a Heart in which there is a round Tumour growing from the inside of the left auricle, near the fossa ovalis. When recent, the tumour was, in texture, like a gelatinous polypus of the nose, yellowish, but spotted with blood, semi- transparent, uniform, and smooth on its cut surface. On detaching a portion of the tumour from the lining of the auricle, this was left rough and otherwise altered in its texture. From a man thirty years old, who died with fracture of his pelvis received on the day before his death. Case-Book, Vol. i. p. 38, No. 74. 36. A Heart, in which there is a large oval opening in the septum between the auricles. The opening is an inch in diameter, and

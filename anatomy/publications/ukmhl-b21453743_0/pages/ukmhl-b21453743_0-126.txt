SECOND SERIES: SUB-SERIES ft the articular surfaces of the acetabulum and of the head of the femur have become finely polished and of an ivory-like texture. The polished portions are deeply penetrated by numerous minute irregular canals; and there is abundant formation of new bone round the margin of the head and on the neck of the femur, as well as about the brim of the acetabulum. 12. Sections of the bones of a Hip-Joint, in which there has been absorption of the upper part of the head of the femur. The surface of the part thus absorbed, as well as that of the acetabulum with which it was in contact, and on which it probably moved freely, are polished, ivory-like, and per- forated like those in the preceding specimen. 13. Portion of a Femur, exhibiting absorption of the upper part of its head, with a considerable formation of new bone around the margin of the head and on the neck. The bone is very light. 14. The bones of the Hip-Joint of a young person. The brim of the acetabulum, and the head, neck, and part of the shaft of the femur, have been completely removed by ulceration. There are also large ulcerated apertures in the upper and anterior walls of the acetabulum. 15. The bones of a Hip-Joint, in which there has been superficial ulceration of the acetabulum and of the head of the femur. The head of the femur was dislocated, and rested on the surface of some new bone formed on the posterior margin of the acetabulum. 16. Sections of the bones of a Hip-Joint, in which the depth of the acetabulum is increased by the deposit of osseous matter around its margin. Its articular surface, and that of the head of the femur, have been absorbed, and the surfaces exposed are hard, perforated, and in a few parts polished.

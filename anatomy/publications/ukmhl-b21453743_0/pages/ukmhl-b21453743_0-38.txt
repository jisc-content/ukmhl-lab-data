The internal surface of the cavity is very smooth, and lined throughout by a mem- brane, a part of which is still seen. 71. Sections of an Occipital Bone, to the lower part of which an Osseous Tumour, nearly an inch in diameter, is attached by a narrow base. The outer part of this tumour is smooth and very dense : within, it is in part cancellous and in part nearly as dense as ivory; its textures have coalesced with those of the outer table and diploe of the skull. 72. A portion of the Lower Jaw of a Child, containing two Teeth, which separated by exfoliation. 73. Portion of a Radius, in which Necrosis, following a peculiar change of structure, has taken place in a piece of its lower end and articular surface. A groove between the dead and the living part of the bone indicates that a separation of the former wis taking place. There is abundant deposit of new bone on the sound bone immediately around the diseased part. 74 Sections of a Tibia and Fibula. Both bones are greatly thick- ened in every part of their walls. The interosseous ligament is ossified. A portion of the tibia near its lower end has been destroyed by malignant ulceration which has penetrated through almost the entire thickness of the shaft. The ulcer- ated surface of the bone is covered by a thick and tough mem- brane. The cancellous tissue immediately above the ulcerated part is consolidated by osseous deposit. 75 Section of a Tibia. The walls are generally thickened, and the cancellous tissue is consolidated by osseous deposit, except in one part near the upper end of the bone. The periosteum is every where altered in its texture, but especially so at the lower part of the bone, where a thick fleshy growth has taken place from it. . The disease had existed twenty-five years, having commenced m a severe lace-

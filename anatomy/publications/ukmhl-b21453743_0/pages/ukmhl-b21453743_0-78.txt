FIRST SERIES: SUB-SERIES A. 88 Necrosis affecting chiefly the outer layers of the wall of a bone, a. 57, 96,103, 108, 110. chiefly the inner layers, a. 94, 97, 98, 100, 118, 119. the whole thickness of the wall, A. 95. chiefly the cancellous tissue, A. 36, 99, 101,102, 115, 122. the whole thickness of a bone, A. 90, 104, 105, 106, 111, 112, 113, 121. the articular portions, 112, 114. Necrosis of the Skull, A. 90, 104, 105, 106, 107, 108, 110, 111, 112. Vertebra, A. 115. Femur, a. 95, 96, 99,101, 118. Tibia, a. 36, 57, 94, 97,98,100,102,103,113,114, 119, 121, 122. TUMOURS OF BONES. Osseous, a.124, 131, 133,134, 136. Growths of bone resembling osseous tumours, a. lib to IM, IM, I3f, 153, 154. Osteoid, a. 132. Cancerous, A. 79. a. 1. A Femur, Tibia, and Fibula, the shafts of which are generally enlarged. The enlargement is due to thickening of their walls by separation of the lamellae, and to the formation of new bone on their surfaces. In the Femur, the osseous fila- ments and lamellae of the cancellous tissue are thickened. From the same person as the enlarged tibia in the preceding Series, No. 74. A 2 Two Femora, two Tibiae, and two Humeri, parts of the walls of which are thickened, chiefly by addition of new bone to their exterior. The disease affects symmetrically the corre- sponding parts of the opposite bones*. A 3 Two Tibiae, the shafts'of which are gently curved forward, and are generally and symmetrically enlarged. The chief increase is in the anterior wall, which is in some parts an inch thick, and of which the whole texture is heavy, dense, and hard. Compare a. 46. a. 4. A Tibia partially enlarged, chiefly by the formation of new bone round the middle third of its shaft. . Whenever, in this or any other Series, two or more parts are described together, they may be understood to have been taken from the same person.

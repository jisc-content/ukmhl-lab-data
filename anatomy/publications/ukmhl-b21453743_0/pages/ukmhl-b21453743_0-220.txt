Portion of Dura Mater, of which a large portion on each side of the falx cerebri is lined by a thin uniform layer of bone-like substance. 36. Portion of Cerebrum, exhibiting a circumscribed softening, with loss of substance, and effusion of small quantities of blood in its convolutions. The consequence of external injur). 37. Portion of Cerebrum, with a small, conical, bone-like tumour, which, apparently originating in the pia mater, has penetrated between the convolutions into the substance of the brain. 38. A large Clot of Blood adhering to the internal surface of the dura mater, which covered the upper part of one of the hemi- spheres of the cerebrum.

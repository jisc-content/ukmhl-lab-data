â€¢J)t DISEASES OF BONE. tiire. A piece of glass is passed through a fistulous passage extending from the skin covering the front part of the head of the tibia, to the dead bone in its centre. The synovial mem- brane of the knee-joint is very vascular and is covered upon its internal surface by a layer of lymph, into which the injec- tion has freely passed from the vessels of the synovial mem- brane. From a young woman, in whom the amputation of the limb was performed on account of the inflammation in the knee-joint consequent on the necrosis of the head of the tibia. The necrosis had existed many years. 124. Section of a Tibia with a vascular malignant fungus growing out of its cancellous texture, the internal surface of its poste- rior wall, and the surrounding soft parts. 125. The other Section of the Tibia last described, together with the Fibula. The tibia exhibits the destruction of a portion of its shaft, and new bone is thinly deposited upon the surrounding surface of the tibia and fibula. 126. Section of the lower part of a Tibia and of a malignant fungous growth from the integuments, such as probably preceded the destruction of the bone in the preceding specimens. 127. Section of a Tibia, the other half of the specimen, No. 126. The periosteum has been in part separated from the bone for the purpose of showing its altered state, and that the bone is sound. The periosteum is increased in thickness and of a soft flocculent texture ; and the morbid growth, which, as the speci- men No. 126 shows, apparently originated in the skin, is here traced to the periosteum. The principal part of the growth is composed of close-set groups of vascular, leaf-like, and warty prominences bounded by an elevated abrupt margin, beyond which the skin is nearly healthy. 128. Section of a Femur from a young woman, in which a fracture was produced by the action of the surrounding muscles. The walls of the bone are much thinner than natural; but its sub-

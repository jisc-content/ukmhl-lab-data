Phlebolithcs; in Series XXXVII. A Thoracic Aorta, exhibiting an abundant deposit of earthy matter in its coats. The earthy matter forms, in many places, thin, round, and oval plates, some of which lie uncovered on the inner surface of the artery, while beneath others, shallow cavities are shown filled with soft grumous yellowish substance. An Aorta, with an Aneurism of the first portion of its arch, which has burst within the pericardium. The sac, which is of an oval form, has extended across the front of the aorta between it and the pulmonary artery, and has compressed the latter. The mouth of the sac is round and is situated in the front wall of the aorta, just above the aortic valves. A quill is introduced from the sac through the ruptured aperture, above which a portion of the pericardium is reflected from the sac. The internal coat of the aorta is thickened and tuberculated, espe- cially near the margin of the mouth of the aneurismal sac. Lymph is deposited on the inner surface of the pulmonary artery, where it is pressed upon by the sac. From a patient forty years old, who, while apparently in good health, died sud- denly after a full meal. The pericardium was distended with coagulated blood, Case-Book, Vol. i. p. 16, No. 36. , Part of the Arch of an Aorta, in which there is an appearance as if a portion of the internal coat just above the valves were deficient.

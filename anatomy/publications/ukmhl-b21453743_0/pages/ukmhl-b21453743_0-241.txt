â€¢2-21 DISEASES OF THE EYE AND ITS APPENDAGES. but the sclerotica is shrivelled and contracted. The optic nerve is sound. The part9 were removed after death. The disease had existed for more than two years, and was associated with similar growths in the scalp and bones of the skull. Case-Book, Vol. i. p. 153, No. 178. Presented by Martin Ware, Esq. 20. The Eye-lids, the remains of the optic nerve, and the other contents of the orbit, from which the Eye No. 17 was removed. The optic nerve terminates by a blunt, but not bulbous, ex- tremity, which is firmly adherent to the surrounding tissues. The eye-lids, muscles, and all the other parts are atrophied and contracted. 21. The Eye-ball of an Ox, in the anterior part of which is a Tumour with hair growing from it. The tumour, which ap- peared to be composed of fat and condensed cellular tissue covered by skin, grew from the outer half of the cornea and sclerotica. The conjunctiva appeared to be lost in the integu- ment which enveloped the tumour. Long hairs, with true bulbs, grew from the skin on the surface of the tumour. The cornea, where not covered by the diseased growth, was trans- parent and of its natural thickness and structure : the iris and lens were likewise healthy. 22. The remains of the Optic Nerve, with some of the surround- ing tissues, from the patient whose eye is described in No. 18. The sheath of the optic nerve is laid open, displaying the nerve contracted within it, pale and shrivelled, and with no bulbous enlargement at its extremity. 23. Sections of an Eye, with its Globe nearly filled by a medullary and melanotic growth, which also protrudes through the upper and anterior part of the sclerotica, and forms, external to the eye, a mass larger than the eye itself. The part of the tumour within the eye is nearly black : that which is external to it is white, variously shaded with grey and black. 24. Part of the Base of the Brain, from the patient from whom the

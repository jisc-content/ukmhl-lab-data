x PREFACE TO THE PRESENT CATALOGUE, brings numerous additions, such as it would be difficult to insert in appropriate places, in a more minute classification. But tlie advantages of an arrangement founded on Principles of Pathology are sought to be attained by adding tables of reference to the descriptions of each series. By the help of these tables, it will be easy both to find any specimen in the Museum, and to study the Preparations in each series in the order in which they may best serve for illustrations of the diseases of the part to which that series is devoted. The following general Table of References is inserted, in order that certain specimens, dispersed among the numerous divisions of the Museum, may be examined in the same order as if they had been arranged in a separate series, as illustrations of General Pathologyâ€”an arrangement which could not have been adopted, without detracting from the interest which those specimens contribute to the several series of illustrations of Special Pathology, in which they are now placed.

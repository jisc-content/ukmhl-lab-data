INJURIES AND DISEASES OF INTESTINES, &c. 309 44. Soft Substances, like those in No. 39, discharged per anum. 45. A Duodenum, exhibiting the effects of Sulphuric Acid. The mucous membrane is very dark with congested vessels and effused blood ; it is, in some situations, corrugated ; in others, completely destroyed. From the same patient as No. 9 in Series XVI. 46. Portion of a Rectum, with the Anus. Irregular and branched fistulous passages, whose course is indicated by bristles, extend in various directions around the exterior of the rectum, but none of them open into it. They are lined by soft and smooth membrane. The mucous follicles of the intestine are much enlarged. 47- A Rectum, exhibiting a contraction of its canal which commences an inch above the anus and is continued five inches up the intes- tine. The coats of the intestine are generally thickened, and of very dense texture ; the mucous membrane in some situations is tuberculated, and in others ulcerated. The cellular and adipose tissue around the intestine is indurated. A portion of the coats of the bladder has undergone the same change of structure as the coats of the rectum. 48. A Caecum with a portion of the Ileum, exhibiting enlargement and sloughing of the Peyer's and Solitary Glands. Many of the glands are simply enlarged ; others have sloughed with por- tions of the tissue in which they lie ; and in most instances the sloughs appear to have been in process of detachment. There are also several ulcers in the caecum and its ap- pendix. From a case of typhus fever. 49. A similar specimen. 50. Portion of a Rectum, with a Fistula extending for two inches upwards on its exterior, and then suddenly opening into its cavity. The passage is lined by a smooth membrane, like the mucous membrane of the rectum itself.

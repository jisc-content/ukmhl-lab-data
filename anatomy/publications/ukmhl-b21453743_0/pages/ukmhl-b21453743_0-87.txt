67 DISEASES OF BONE. . 58. A Skull-Cap, exhibiting some of the effects of syphilis. In some situations there has been a complete destruction of the bone through both tables of the skull; at the borders of the apertures thus made, the disease seems to have stopped, and the parts appear to have cicatrised, for their edges are thin, smooth, and hard. In other situations, ulceration appears to have been in progress, the bone in these parts exhibiting a rough surface, a porous texture, and many small deeply penetrating holes. The spaces left by the removal of the bone are filled by membrane in which there are several small deposits of new bone: and the outer surfaces of all the portions of the skull which remain between the ulcers, are tuberculated, seamed, and starred, as in a. 34. 59. A Skull-Cap, large portions of which have been de- stroyed by syphilitic ulceration like that in the preceding specimen. The two preceding specimens were taken from patients who died in the venereal wards of the hospital while Mr. Pott was surgeon. 60. Portions of a Skull-Cap, of which the outer table is tubercu- lated and irregularly ulcerated. The diploe and inner table are thickened and consolidated, and the inner table appears to have been very vascular. These changes had their origin in the effects of external violence. 61. A Skull-Cap, exhibiting extensive ulceration of the outer table, and ulceration to a less extent of the inner table. The parts remaining between the ulcers have a tuberculated surface. It i3 presumed these changes were consequent on the formation of matter within the diploe. 62. A Skull-Cap, with numerous minute round holes in both the outer and inner tables. Generally, the absorption of the outer corresponds with that of the inner table. 63. A Skull-Cap, exhibiting extensive syphilitic ulceration of its outer table. The ulcers are distinct, large, and round. f 2

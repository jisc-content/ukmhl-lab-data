181 1NJUR1KS AND DISEASES OK THE SPINE. d. 7. The base of a Skull, with the first cervical vertebra. The vertebra, displaced forwards and to the left side, is in every part, except the right half of its posterior arch, united to the occipital bone. Its projection within the foramen mag- num has considerably diminished the size of that aperture. d. 8. A Sacrum and Coccyx, firmly united by bone. The coccyx deviates considerably to the left side. d. 9. Four lower Dorsal Vertebrae, and three Ribs. They are all united by smooth layers of bone extending, like bridges, over the anterior and lateral surfaces of the bodies of the vertebrae, and thence laterally over the heads of the ribs. . 10. Sections of two Lumbar Vertebrae, in the body of one of which is an irregular circumscribed cavity, formerly the seat of abscess, or, possibly, of necrosis. The cavity opens ante- riorly, through the body of the vertebra, and posteriorly, by a wide aperture into the spinal canal. In the neighbourhood of the cavity the adjacent surfaces of the vertebrae are thick- ened, indurated, and in part united by hard new bone. New bone is also abundantly formed on the anterior surfaces of their bodies. .11. Section of a Spine, in which there has been destruction by ulceration of the bodies of six of the dorsal and lumbar ver- tebrae. The vertebrae above and below the seat of the disease have been approximated and firmly united by bone. There is an acute angular curvature of the spine, but the diameter of the canal which contained the medulla spinalis is not lessened; rather, by the extensive destruction of the bodies of the vertebrae, it is increased where the angle is most prominent. 12. Three Dorsal Vertebrae, united by bridge-like portions of bone extending between the anterior and lateral surfaces of their bodies, and forming considerable projections, like exostoses, in front of the intervertebral spaces.

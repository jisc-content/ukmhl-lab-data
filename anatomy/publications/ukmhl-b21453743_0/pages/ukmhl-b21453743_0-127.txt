DISEASES OF JOINTS. 107 the femur corresponds with that on the margin of the acetabulum. b. 17. Portion of a Femur, exhibiting absorption, hardening, and polishing of the upper and anterior part, with osseous deposit around the margin, of its head. b. 18. An Os Innominatum, in which ulceration has removed the whole surface of the acetabulum, and has formed a large aperture of communication between its cavity and the in- terior of the pelvis. b. 19. Portion of a Femur, of which the head and neck have been removed by ulceration. New bone is formed, in a saccular shape, in front of the trochanter minor. b. 20. Portion of a Femur, in which the upper part of the head has been absorbed, flattened, and increased in width. Part of the surface absorbed is hard, polished, and perforated : new bone is formed on other parts. b. 21. Portion of a Femur, in which the neck of the bone appears to have yielded while in a softened condition, so as to permit the head to be carried backwards nearly into contact with the posterior part of the trochanter major. The bone is ligbt, and parts of it are brittle. b. 22. The bones of a Knee-Joint, in which the patella is united by bone to the space between the condyles of the femur, and the condyles are similarly united to the articular surfaces of the tibia. The disease, probably, commenced in the head of die tibia, this part of the bone being altered in structure, and deeply ulcerated. The tibia is drawn under the femur, and the joint fixed in the half-bent position. b. 23. The bones of a Knee-Joint, exhibiting ulceration of the arti- cular surfaces of the femur and tibia. b. 24. The bones of a Knee-Joint, in which the inner condyle of

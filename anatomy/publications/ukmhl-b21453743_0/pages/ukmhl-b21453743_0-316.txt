Portion of a Stomach, in which there is an aperture with a dark discoloration of the membrane around it. The discolored portion is very thin, and the aperture in its centre has ragged edges. It is uncertain whether these changes are due to ulceration, or to the action of the secretions of the stomach after death. 12. A Stomach, with a large, probably medullary, tumour grow- ing from its mucous membrane near the pylorus. The tumour is of an oval form, lobed on its surface, and consisting of a firm substance intersected by white lines. The mucous mem- brane immediately around it is thickened and indurated. From a man fifty-two years old. The disease appeared to have been four years in progress. Case-Book, Vol. i. p. 30, No. 66. Presented by William Radnor, Esq. 13. Portion of a Stomach, exhibiting attenuation, with paleness and softening, of a part of its great arch. The dark streaks in the altered portion of the stomach are produced by the blackening of the blood coagulated in its vessels. It is probable that these changes were occasioned by the action of the secretions of the stomach upon its coats after death. 14. Part of a Stomach, with small portions of the Liver and Pan- creas adherent to it. There is a large and deep oval ulcer just below and to the right of the cardiac orifice of the stomach, which has extended into the pancreas, destroying in its progress a portion of the splenic artery. A bristle is introduced into the ulcerated orifice of the artery, from which fatal hemorrhage took place into the cavity of the stomach. 15. A Stomach from a young woman, exhibiting the effects of Sulphuric Acid. There is an aperture with ragged edges, about half an inch in diameter, in the middle of the great arch of the stomach. The mucous membrane around the aperture is thickened, black, and charred by the acid. The stomach is closely contracted.

DISEASES OF HONE. iil a. 135. Portion of a Humerus, on which there is a small Osseous growth from its lower and front part, a little above the inner condyle. a. 136. Portion of an Ulna on which a large Osseous Tumour has arisen from the whole of its articular surface between the olecranon and coronoid process. The tumour, compact on its surface and cancellous within, is lobed and irregularly nodulated. a. 137. Sections of a Femur, upon the shaft of which there is an Osseous growth, like a. 129, but with more cancellous texture in its interior. a. 138. A Femur, Tibia, and Fibula, from a child. They are all considerably curved from rickets, but have regained their natural firmness. a. 139. A Femur, Tibia, and Fibula, from an adult. They are considerably curved, but their texture is as hard and heavy as in health. The femur is curved in an arch with its convexity directed forwards; the middle of its shaft is flattened at the sides, and the linea aspera in the same part is very prominent, its edge forming a straight line represent- ing the chord of the arc formed by the most curved part of the shaft. The tibia and fibula are curved inwards, and in the middle of their shafts present an antero-posterior flattening greater than the lateral flattening of the shaft of the femur. a. 140. Portion of the Femur of an adult very strongly curved in its upper third. The curved part of the shaft is so flattened that its anterior surface forms a narrow prominent ridge. A short sharp process of bone has grown from the trochanter minor. a. 141. The upper parts of two Femora. In the softened con- dition of the bone during rickets, the head of each femur o

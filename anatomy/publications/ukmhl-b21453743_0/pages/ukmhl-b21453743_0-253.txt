DISEASES OF THE HEART, &c. whole heart is enlarged. Its vessels are injected, but it is doubtful whether any of the injection has penetrated the lymph. The patient, a woman twenty-five years old, was attacked with signs of peri- carditis, during recovery from acute rheumatism. These were suhdued, and she appeared convalescent, when a second similar attack ensued, and was speedily fatal. Case-Book, Vol. i. p. 11, No. 26. 5. A Heart, with layers of recent lymph over the whole free surface of the Pericardium. A thin and transparent membrane has been formed over the lymph which covers the reflected pericar- dium. The lymph presents a reticulated surface. The heart is slightly enlarged. From a patient who had acute rheumatism. 6. A Heart, on which there is a general and close adhesion of the Pericardium. The adhesions are completely organized. The aortic valves are thickened, contracted and recurved; and there is a warty mass of fibrine on one of them. The lining membrane of the aorta, and that of the heart below the aortic valves, are thickened and opaque. The left ventricle is dilated, and its walls are thickened. 7- A Heart, with a very abundant deposit of lymph over the whole free surface of the Pericardium. The lymph forms fine branching and shreddy processes of considerable length, which hang loosely within the sac of the pericardium. The heart is not materially enlarged. â€¢ 8. A Heart, with Lymph deposited in thick layers, and in a coarsely reticular form, upon the surface of the pericardium. The lymph appears soft, and blood is effused in many parts of it. The heart is much enlarged. 9. A Heart, exhibiting great enlargement of the cavity of the left ventricle, and a proportionate increase of the thickness of its walls. The aortic valves and the internal coat of the aorta are slightly thickened and opaque. 10. A Heart, in which the cavities of both Ventricles are enlarged

Section of a spine, in which there is fracture of a dorsal verte- bra, either the third or the fourth. The front of its body is crushed between the vertebrae above and below it, and the posterior part has been driven backwards into the spinal canal, and has completely divided the chord. The spinous and articular processes of the fractured vertebrae are torn away from those of the vertebra above it, leaving a wide gap at the posterior part of the spinal column.

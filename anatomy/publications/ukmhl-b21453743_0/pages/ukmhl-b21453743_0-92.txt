FIRST SERIES: SUB-SERIES A. 89. A Skull exhibiting the effects of syphilis. The palate septum nasi, and the lateral boundaries of the nose, are destroyed by ulceration extending as high as the middle tur- binated bone. The outer table of nearly all the upper part of the skull is tuberculated and very extensively ulcerated, and in several places the ulceration has penetrated the inner table. 90 The Skull-Cap of a young woman, in which, in the course of syphilis, the greater part of the outer table of the frontal portion of the frontal bone suffered necrosis, and was nearly separated from the adjacent bone. A deep groove has formed round the dead portion, and a large part of its under surface is separated. The inner table has not perished, but beneath the centre of the necrosed portion there are several irregular ulcerated openings in it. There are two small superficial ulcerations of the external table near the sa- gittal suture, on corresponding parts of the two parietal bones. A 91. Sections of a Tibia, in which the osseous part of nearly all the cancellous tissue being absorbed, there is a wide cavity extending completely through the interior of the bone The walls of the bone are a little thicker than natural: and their texture is light and porous; the cavity probably contained purulent matter. A. 92. Sections of a Femur in whieh there is an enlargement of the medullary cavity, with thinning of the walls, and general lightness and dryness of texture. A 93. A Femur, exhibiting a slight enlargement of the lower part of its shaft. The exterior of the bone at this part is smooth and healthy, but in the corresponding situation m the interior there is a cavity from which the osseous part of the medullary tissue has been removed. The rest of the cancellous tissue is very delicate and light. A. 94. Part of a Tibia in which there has been Necrosis of a portion

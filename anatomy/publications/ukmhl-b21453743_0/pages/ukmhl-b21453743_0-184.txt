THIRD SERIES: SUB-SERIES C. fracture near the junction of its malar and temporal portions. 101. Section of a Sacrum, in which there appears to have been a transverse fracture of its lower extremity immediately above the coccyx. A layer of new bone is formed over the sup- posed line of fracture. 102. A Scapula, in which there appears to have been a fracture of the lower margin of the glenoid cavity. 103 A Scapula and Humerus, in which there has been a disloca- tion of the head, with a fracture of the neck, of the humerus. The head of the bone was found resting against the anterior border and concave surface of the scapula, close to the glenoid cavity, and below the coracoid process. A deposit of osseous substance, forming a hollow articular surface, has taken place upon the scapula in this situation. The fracture of the humerus occurred immediately below the base of its head, between it and the tuberosities, and it had been united by fibro-cartilaginous substance, which was removed in maceration. These injuries were the consequence of a fall upon the shoulder, about three months before death. The patient was a man upwards of fifty years of age. c 104 Bones of a Shoulder-Joint, exhibiting a fracture through the shaft of the humerus, just below the tuberosities. c. 105. Portions of a Femur, of which the neck was fractured, near the margin of the head, many years before death. 1 he remains of the neck have been nearly absorbed. Ihe fractured surface of the head is adapted to the surface of the short portion of the neck which remains between the trochanters, and to a growth of bone proceeding from it downwards. Both the surfaces thus adapted are very hard, polished, ivory-like, and penetrated by numerous foramina. c. 100. The Bones of a Leg, exhibiting the effects of a compound

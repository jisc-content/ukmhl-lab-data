The situation of the abscess is pointed out by the deficiency of medulla. The periosteum is not so strongly united to the bone as in the natural state ; it has been partially reflected, to show its vascularity and softened texture opposite to, and for some way above and below, the situation of the abscess. There is a narrow ulcerated aperture in the integuments over the tibia leading to slight superficial ulceration of its outer wall. 2. Section of a Tibia, exhibiting a part of the process of Exfoliation after superficial Necrosis. The dead and exfoliating piece of bone is separated from the living bone in the upper half of its extent, and the space which has been here formed by the ab- sorption of the surface of the living bone is occupied by soft vascular matter, like granulations. Beneath the lower part of the dead piece of bone there is an ulcerated groove, but no granulation. The granulations arising from the parts around the dead bone are large and spongy; and they overlap the mar- gins of the dead bone. b 2

SECOND SERIES, posterior surface, by which the astragalus articulated with the os calcis, is similarly diseased. A similar specimen of ulceration of the cartilages and bones of the Ankle-Joint; but herein the exposed bones are covered thickly with lymph. Sections of the Condyles of a Femur. The articular cartilage is thinned, and its connexion with the bone is so loosened that its separation was readily effected. Portions of the cartilage have been detached and turned downwards, to show that parts of the surface which was connected with the bone are unnaturally rough. The exposed surface of bone is very superficially ulcerated and thinly covered by granu- lations. A Knee-joint, in whieh anchylosis has heen effected by the conization of lymph upon and between the oppos.te surfaces of the synovial membrane. A portion of the adherent synovial membrane is reflected from the front of the jomt The oatella is firmly united to the external coudyle of the Lur, and the tibia and fibula have been drawn backwards under the femur, lengthening and giving a very obhcpte direction to the external lateral ligament. The bones are atrophied. 8. A section of the upper part of a Femur, from a man who had for four years suffered will, rheumatic pams m and about the hip A arge portion of the articular cartilage has been com- pLly remold from the midd.e of tire head of the femur. The bone thus exposed is unnaturally hard; its surface ,s oolished, and the morbid hardness extends for about a toe m den h Of the remaining cartilage, some is softened, tlnck, succulent, and nodulated on its surface, while that round the mlin of the exposed bone is very thin; other parts, again, Tre marked with grooves, like wrinkles, rad.atmg to the outer m Jn of the head-, and others are converted mto a fibrous " sue, which hangs in shreds from the surface of the bone.

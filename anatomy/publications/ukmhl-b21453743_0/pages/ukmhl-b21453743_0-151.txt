131 INJURIES OF BONES AND JOINTS. 69. Section of the Tibia of a Dog, exhibiting the process of union on the tenth day after a transverse fracture through the middle of the shaft. A ring-shaped mass of cartilaginous substance is deposited between the periosteum and bone, around and for some way above and below the line of the fracture. In the centre of this cartilage there are some minute deposits of earthy matter. The line of fracture is distinct: in the medul- lary cavity it is interrupted by a deposit of cartilaginous sub- stance ; but in the walls of the bone it is still open. 70. Section of the Tibia of a Dog; the other half of the specimen No. 69. The periosteum is turned downwards and completely separated from the cartilaginous substance deposited upon the bone around, above, and below, the fracture. 71. Section of the Tibia of a Dog, exhibiting the process of union on the eighteenth day after a similar fracture. The cartilagi- nous substance deposited between the periosteum and bone around, above, and below the fracture, is ossified, except in that part which corresponds with the line of fracture. This line is still open, as in the preceding specimen, in the wall of the bone, but is closed by cartilaginous substance in the me- dullary tube. The experiments by which these specimens were obtained were performed by Mr. Stanley. 72. Two portions of a fractured Patella, which were united by ligamentous substance. The lower portion is much enlarged and altered in form by the deposit of osseous substance upon its borders. 73. Portions of Costal Cartilages. There has been a fracture of the cartilage of one of the false ribs. Its portions overlap, and are firmly united by a ring of bone extending around them. 74. A Shoulder-Joint, exhibiting an ununited fracture of the neck of the humerus, with obliteration of the axillary artery from the pressure of the lower portion of the bone against it. The k 2

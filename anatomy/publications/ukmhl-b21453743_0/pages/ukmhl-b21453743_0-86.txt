36 FIRST SERIES: SUTÂ» SERIES A. a. 50. Portion of a Tibia, on the external surface of which, above the malleolus, new bone has been formed on a circumscribed oval space. A part of the new bone has been destroyed by ulceration, which probably extended into it from an ulcer of the integuments. A 51 A Tibia and Fibula. Ulceration, extending probably from a malignant disease of the integuments, has penetrated the front wall of the tibia, destroyed its medullary tissue, and made small apertures in its posterior wall. A deposit ot bone has taken place upon the fibula, and there is ossifica- tion of the interosseous ligament. A 52. Portion of a Tibia exhibiting superficial ulceration, with node-like thickening of the bone around the ulcerated surface : probably the effects of syphilis. A 53. Portian of a Tibia exhibiting superficial and extensive uleera- tion of its upper half, with new bone about the borders of the ulceration. A fleshy tumour, originating in the sott parts, completely surrounded this part of the bone. A 54. Portion of a Tibia exhibiting deep ulceration of fe* walls, with thickening and induration of the surrounding bone. A 55. Portions of a Tibia and Fibula. Ulceration of the walls of the tibia has penetrated to its medullary cavity. The fibula i enlarged by heavy new bone, and the interosseous ligament is extensively ossified. A 56 An Os Frontis, exhibiting ulceration of its outer table pene- trating to the frontal sinus. The border of the ulcer is surrounded by an unequal ring of new bone. V Section of a Tibia with superficial ulceration, necrosis, and a Considerable deposit of new bone around *e ulceraed surface. The other Section is No. 51, ... the preceding Scries.

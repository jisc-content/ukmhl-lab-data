1.51 INJURIES OK BONES AND JOINTS. in the head of the humerus, forms a kind of new joint be- tween them. 28. A Scapula, in which there has been a transverse fracture of the acromion through the middle. The fracture was not united by bone, but probably by fibrous tissue ; for, though it may be inferred, from the appearance of the bone, that the fracture occurred a considerable time before death, yet the portions do not seem to have moved on each other. 29. A Radius and Ulna, which have been fractured near their upper ends. The fractures are both firmly united, and a large quantity of new bone has been formed around the seats of union. The surfaces of the new bone on the radius and of that on the ulna, meeting in the interosseous space, have been roughly adapted to each other, but have not coalesced. 30. A Radius, which has been fractured near the middle of its shaft. The fracture is united with a little overlapping of the ends of the bone. 31. A Radius and Ulna. The radius has been broken about three quarters of an inch above its lower end. The fracture is united, with the lower portion of bone displaced towards the radial and dorsal aspect of the upper portion. In con- sequence of the shortening of the radius, induced by this displacement, a new articular surface has been formed on the lower end of the ulna, by the growth of a half-ring of bone upwards from the margin of the surface by which it before articulated with the radius. The carpal articular surface of the ulna thus projects far beyond that of the radius. 32. A Clavicle, which has been broken near the middle of its shaft. The fracture is united with the scapular end of the bone beneath its sternal end. 33. A Scapula, which has been broken vertically through its

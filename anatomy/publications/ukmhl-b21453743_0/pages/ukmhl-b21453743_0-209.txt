189 INJURIES AND DISEASES OF MUSCLES, &c. and deep femoral arteries. Large portions of the muscle are ossified. The largest portion of bone lies so close to the arteries, that it probably presented during life the characters of a pulsating tumour. 3. The end of the Tail of a Rat, with numerous long slender tendons attached to it, which, it is probable, were pulled out with small pieces of their muscles, in the attempts which the animal made to escape, when its tail had been caught in a trap. 4. The Tendon, with part of the muscular fibres, of the Flexor Longus Pollicis, which were torn out from a man's arm. The patient was a butcher, whose thumb was caught by a meat-hook, on which he remained suspended till the muscle gave way. He recovered quickly from the injury. 5. Parts of the bones of a Middle Finger, with the tendon and some of the muscular fibres of their portion of the extensor muscle, dried. They were torn away from their connections by the explosion of a gun while the patient's hand was resting on the muzzle. Presented by Henry Bateman, Esq. 6. Sections of a Rectus Femoris Muscle, in which are several large lobulated and circumscribed masses of a soft flocculent me- dullary substance. The muscular fasciculi are separated by the morbid growths, but appear of healthy texture. A large medullary tumour from the axilla of the same patient, is preserved in Series XXXV. 7. Portions of a Longissimus Dorsi Muscle, in which are specimens of the Cysticercus Cellulosae (Rudolphi). The cysts are placed in the cellular tissue connecting the muscular fasciculi. In the upper portion of the muscle are two cysts, from which the cysticerci lying loose in the bottle were removed; in the lower portion the cysticercus is attached to the interior of its cyst. These specimens were taken from the body of an old man, in many of whose voluntary muscles similar cntozoa existed.

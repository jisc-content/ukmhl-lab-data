INJURIES AND DISEASES OF ARTERIES AND VEINS. 2G3 the aneurism burst. All the arteries arising from the upper part of the arch of the aorta are compressed by the aneurism. 55. The Arch of an Aorta, from which an Aneurism of the posterior wall below the brachio-cephalic trunks has burst into the oesophagus. The internal coat of the artery is much thickened. The main arterial trunks arise from the front of the sac, and are not compressed. 56. An External Iliac Artery, torn completely and straight across. The torn ends of the artery are an inch apart, and are con- nected by a coagulum of blood. The coats of the artery are not obviously diseased. The rupture was directly under Poupart's ligament. It occurred in an injury by which the lower part of the femur was fractured. 57. A Subclavian and Axillary Artery. The coats of the Artery, especially the inner coat, are thickened; and its cavity is generally dilated. 58. Part of an Aorta, with a large Aneurism of the Thoracic portion. The sac has extended into the bodies of the verte- bras, and has burst by a large sloughing aperture into the oesophagus. The coats of the artery are greatly thickened and generally dilated, and its inner coat is tuberculated with opaque, white, elevated patches. 59. A Femoral Artery and Vein, from a Stump. The coats of the artery are generally thickened. No adhesion of its sides has taken place at the cut extremity ; but for some distance higher up, its cavity is filled by coagulum. The extremity of the vein is closed. 60. The Arch of an Aorta, exhibiting numerous deposits of soft and earthy matter in its coats, and a mass of fibrine, about the size of half a walnut, so closely adherent to the inner surface of the artery as to present the appearance of a growth from it. No other fibrine was deposited in the artery. From a man thirty-eight years old, who died with phthisis. Case-Book, Vol i p. 173, No. 197.

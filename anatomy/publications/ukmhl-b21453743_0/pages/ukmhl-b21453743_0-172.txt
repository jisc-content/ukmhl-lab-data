THIRD SERIES: SUB-SERIES C. infra-spinous portion, and, apparently, through the acromion. Both fractures are united by bone. 34. A Scapula and a portion of the Humerus, exhibiting the same consequences of dislocation of the head of the humerus as are shown in c. 27. 35. Portion of a Radius, which has been fractured about an inch above its lower end. The fracture has united with a con- siderable overlapping of the ends of the bone, the palmar margin of the upper portion projecting with a sharp edge towards the palm, while its posterior or dorsal margin is driven into the cancellous tissue of the lower portion. The lower portion with the carpal articular surface of the radius is consequently deflected strongly backwards, or towards the dorsal region of the fore arm. 36. The Bones of an Elbow-Joint. The humerus has been fractured obliquely between the condyles, and transversely a little above them. The fractures are firmly united, but the internal condyle is flattened and elongated. The articular surface of the ulna is adapted to this altered form of the humerus. It is uncertain whether the ulna has been broken. 37. The Bones of an Elbow-Joint. The articular surfaces of the humerus and ulna are altered in form ; that of the humerus, being narrower, and that of the ulna, deeper than is natural; but there is no appearance of their having been fractured. The radius was found dislocated from the outer condyle, and lying upon the front of the ulna. . 38. The bones of an Elbow-Joint. A fracture extends in two directions through the internal condyle of the humerus into the elbow-joint. The two portions of the condyle separated by the fracture have not been reunited by bone. . 39. Portions of a Tibia and Fibula. The point of the malleolus internus has been separated by fracture. The fibula is broken two inches above its lower end.

DISEASES OF THE HEART, &c. 235 15. ^ Part of an Aorta, with its valves adherent by their margins, thickened, opaque, and made quite rigid by deposits of earthy matter. A narrow central aperture alone remains for the communication of the ventricle with the aorta. 16. A Mitral Valve, with portions of the Aorta. On a large portion of the mitral valve and on the arch of the aorta there are abundant deposits of earthy matter. The aortic valves, and the portion of the mitral valve adjacent to them, are but little affected with the same disease. 17. A Heart, exhibiting numerous warty masses of brown firm fibrine on the aortic valves. Behind one of the valves, the aorta is dilated into a pouch, and its inner membrane is here ulcerated. There are but two valves; both are of unusually large size, thick, opaque, and somewhat recurved. From a man, aged twenty-five. 18. A Left Ventricle ruptured at its apex; a quill is introduced into the aperture. Around the aperture, the walls of the ventricle are very thin, and appear to have been dilated into a kind of aneurismal sac, before the rupture took place. The aperture is nearly filled by a round firm clot of blood. 19. Part of a Heart, exhibiting thickening and rigidity of the mitral valve and of its tendinous chords, with extreme contraction of the left auriculo-ventricular opening. The cavity of the left auricle is enlarged; its lining membrane is opaque and thickened ; and a thick layer of dry laminated coagulum is firmly attached to the upper and posterior part of its walls, where it is rather more dilated than elsewhere. 20. Aortic Valves, with numerous firm, pale, warty excrescences or vegetations attached to their free borders, and to part of their adjacent surfaces. 21. Aortic Valves, with numerous similar excrescences attached to their surfaces. One of the valves is extensively ulcerated, and

DISEASES OF BONE. 73 of the shaft, and an abundant formation of new bone on all the adjacent part. The dead bone is completely separated, and lies loose in the cavity surrounded by the new bone, but is too large to be removed through any of the aper- tures, or cloacae, in the new bone. 95. Sections of a Femur in which there has been Necrosis of nearly the whole length and thickness of the walls of the shaft. The dead bone is separated, and is completely en- closed in a case of new bone formed around it. There are several round and oval apertures leading through the new bone into the narrow space by which it is separated from the surface of the sequestrum. 96. Portion of a Femur, in which there has been Necrosis of the posterior wall of the lower part of the shaft. The dead bone was separated, but was held by a bridge of new bone formed across it. In the adjacent part of the shaft the walls are thickened, the cancellous tissue is nearly con- solidated, and there is irregular ulceration above and upon the condyles. 97. A Tibia, in which there has been Necrosis of a portion of the wall and cancellous tissue of the upper half of the shaft. The new bone formed around the sequestrum is thick, hard, and very heavy, and there are many apertures leading through it into the cavity in which the sequestrum lies. 93. A Tibia and Fibula. There has been Necrosis of portions of the whole length of the walls of the tibia. The remaining walls with the new bone formed on them are thickened, enlarged, and very heavy. There is extensive ossification of the inter- osseous ligament. 99. Portion of a Femur in which there has been Necrosis of a part of the shaft. The sequestrum has been removed: the walls around the cavity in which it lay are thick, hard,

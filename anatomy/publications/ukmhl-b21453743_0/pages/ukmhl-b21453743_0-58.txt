38 FIRST SERIES. 161. Portions of a Tibia which were separated by exfoliation. From a girl twelve years old. 162. Sections of the lower part of a Femur, enlarged and having a cavity in its interior. The cancelli and the wall of the bone surrounding this cavity exhibit a natural texture. Upon the outer surface of the bone, corresponding with the cavity m its interior, there is a considerable deposit of new bone, apparently the result of irritation of the periosteum. It is not known what the cavity in the femur contained, nor under what cir- cumstances it was formed. 163. Sections of the head and upper part of a Tibia.

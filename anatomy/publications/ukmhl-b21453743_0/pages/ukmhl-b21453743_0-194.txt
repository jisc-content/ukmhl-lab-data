174 FOURTH SERIES. cervical vertebra? are ulcerated. The remaining bone is softened and yellow. The odontoid process has been com- pletely separated at its base from the body of the second vertebra. 20. Section of a Spine, exhibiting disease in the dorsal and lumbar vertebrae. The disease consists in an alteration of colour in the bone, apparently from morbid secretion into the cancellous texture. Between two of the lower dorsal vertebra?, the inter- vertebral substance is completely destroyed, and the adjacent surfaces of the bodies of those vertebrae are slightly ulcerated. 21. Section of a Spine, in which the adjacent parts of the bodies of two dorsal vertebrae are altered in structure and deeply ulce- rated. A portion of the diseased bone has been separated and protruded forwards. The intervertebral substance be- tween the two diseased vertebrae is completely absorbed. An abscess has formed by the side of the diseased portion of the spine, but it has no communication with the ulcerated bone. 22. Portion of a Spine, exhibiting ulceration in the back parts or arches of the vertebrae. The left halves of the arches of the fifth, sixth, and seventh cervical vertebrae are almost completely destroyed. A portion of the ulcerated bone has become sepa- rated, and has pressed upon the spinal chord. The remain- ing portions of the bones are of their natural texture. 23. Section of a Spine, exhibiting the process of reparation after extensive disease. Twelve spinous processes are shown in the preparation, but the bodies of only four vertebras ; eight bodies, therefore, have been destroyed. The vertebrae above and below these eight have been approximated, and are firmly united by bone with their remains and with one another. An extremely acute angular curvature is thus produced; but the spinal chord has suffered no pressure; it has adapted itself to the alteration in the direction of the spinal canal. 24. Portion of a Spine, exhibiting ulceration of the posterior sur-

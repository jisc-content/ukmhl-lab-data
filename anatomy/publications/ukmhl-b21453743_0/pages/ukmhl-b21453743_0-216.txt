1!)G SIXTH SERIES- lorized, is of a much lighter colour, and appears drier, than that in die preceding specimen. The surface of the clot is in close contact with the adjacent substance of the brain. The two preceding specimens were taken from a person who had had two apoplectic attacks at distant periods. Case-Book, Vol. i. p. 8. No. 18. 11. Portion of Cerebrum, in the substance of which there is an Apoplectic clot, from which the red colour has almost entirely disappeared. The surface of the clot is closely united to the substance of the brain, which also appears more smooth than that immediately surrounding the clots in the preceding spe- cimens. 12. Portions of Cerebrum, in the substance of which are the two parts of a cavity which contained a serous fluid, and which was, probably, formed by the complete removal of an apoplectic effusion, such as is shown in earlier stages in the preceding specimens. The form of the cavity is irregular, but its interior is smooth, and the adjacent substance of the brain appears healthy. The patient was forty years old, and had an apoplectic attack about four months before his death. Case-Book, Vol. i., p. 8, No. 19. 13. A similar specimen; but the interior of the cavity is smoother than that in the preceding specimen. 14 Portion of Cerebrum, in the substance of which there is a cavity formed by a recent apoplectic effus.on of blood. The blood has been removed, to show the internal surface of the cavity, which is rough and irregular, and appears to have small effusions of blood in and beneath its walls. 15. Portion of Cerebrum, with an extensive effusion of blood upon its surface beneath the arachnoid membrane. 16 Portion of Skull, with the Dura Mater, exhibiting the growth of a small, oval, firm, fibrous tumour from the internal surface of the dura mater. 17. Portion of Cerebrum, in the substance of which a firm, round

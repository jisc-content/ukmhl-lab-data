viii PREFACE TO THE CATALOGUE OF 1881. In the formation of the Museum, only those Morbid speci- mens have been preserved which might be expected to retain their original characters in a sufficient degree to render them useful as objects of future reference. Without this explana- tion, the experienced pathologist would expect to find in the Collection more numerous specimens of some organs in the human body which are subject to frequent alterations in their structure. It is due to the liberality of Dr. Conquest here to record the gift of his private Collection of Preparations, which have so greatly enriched those departments of the Museum to which they belong. EDWARD STANLEY.

FIRST SERIES: SUB-SERIES A. bone upon their surfaces, and witli ossification of the low., part of the interosseous ligament. 15. A Tibia and Fibula generally enlarged, with ossification of the interosseous ligament. There is a circumscribed oval eleva- tion of new bone on the front and lower part of the tibia, over which it is probable there was an old ulcer of the soft parts. 16 Sections of a Tibia and Fibula. Both bones are thickened, chiefly by expansion of their walls, and there is ossification of the interosseous ligament. 17. Sections of a Humerus. The middle of the shaft is unna- turally curved, and is enlarged, chiefly by the expansion of its walls. A small quantity of new bone is deposited on the surface of the enlarged part. 18. A Femur enlarged by the deposit of new bone on its lower part immediately above the condyles. 19 Section of a Tibia partially enlarged: the other half of it is in the preceding Series, No. 53. The enlargement is caused by the formation of a thick layer of new bone, like a node with a coarsely-nodulated surface, round the middle of the shaft. In the corresponding part of the medullary tissue, the osseous filaments and lamellae are thickened and indu- rated, and have encroached on the medullary spaces till they are nearly obliterated. l. 20. Portion of a Tibia with a node-like enlargement of the middle of its shaft. a. 21. Portion of a Fibula partially enlarged. A 22 Portion of a Tibia partially enlarged. On its front surface there is a circumscribed oval elevation of new bone with an abrupt margin, over which it is probable there was an ulcer of the soft parts.

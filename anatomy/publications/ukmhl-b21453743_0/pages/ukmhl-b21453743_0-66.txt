46 FIRST SERIES. fistulous passage leading from the medullary cavity through the lower end of the humerus into the elbow-joint. The greater part of the articular cartilage is removed from the ends of the bones forming the elbow-joint; and the remains of the synovial membrane are thickened. 208. Portion of a Lower Jaw, comprising one side of the bone from the angle to the symphysis, which was removed by operation from a young woman. A soft medullary growth, originating in the interior of the bone, has caused the expan- sion of its surrounding walls. In the upper half of the section the morbid structure has been separated from the cavity in which it was imbedded. 209. The Metacarpal Bone of a Little Finger. The bone is enlarged, apparently by an expansion of its walls; an osseous tumour growing from this bone had been removed some time previous to the amputation of the finger. 210. Portion of the wall of a Tibia separated by exfoliation. The dead bone, which had been diseased some time before it perished, is porous and rough on its outer surface: it com- prises a part only of the thickness of the wall. The disease was connected with syphilitic periostitis. 211. Sections of the extremity of a Stump after amputation above the knee. The lower end of the bone protrudes nearly an inch beyond the extremity of the granulations upon the soft parts. The protruded portion and that immediately adjacent to it had died, and were in process of exfoliation. On the surface of the section, the line of separation between the dead and the living bone is marked by an arched layer of soft fleshy substance, like a layer of granulations, which extends across the cancellous tissue, and is continued less distinctly through the compact wall. In the upper section, the perios- teum and soft parts have been separated from one side of the bone. The surface of the latter is left rough and irregular, and in the lower part of the periosteum a mass of soft spongy

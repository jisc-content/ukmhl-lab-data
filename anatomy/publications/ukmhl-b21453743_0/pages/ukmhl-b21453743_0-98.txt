FIRST SERIES: SI'B-SERIES A. of the bone, although in this situation its tissue is nearly consolidated. 119. Sections of a Tibia, which is presumed to have belonged to the same person as the femur last described, but from the opposite limb. It is diseased in exactly the same manner. A sequestrum of a large portion of the inner layers of its wall is completely enclosed within the thick and hard layer of new bone formed on and united with the remaining por- tions of the wall. The exterior of this new bone is even smoother than that last described, and there is no aperture leading through it to the cavity containing the sequestrum. The medullary tissue is entire; but partially consolidated. 120. Sections of a Femur, exhibiting an increased thickness and density of the walls of the upper half of its shaft. 121. Part of the Femur of a boy thirteen years old. Almost all the lower half of the shaft has perished in its whole thick- ness, and was in process of separation. Deep grooves have been formed between it and the adjacent living bone, on all parts of which new bone has been deposited. The disease commenced after a blow on the knee, five weeks before the amputation of the limb. . 122. Part of a Tibia, two portions of which, each including both compact and cancellous tissue, have perished and were in process of separation by grooves being formed around them. Previous to the necrosis these portions had been irregularly ulcerated on their surfaces and consolidated in their internal structure by thickening and union of their lamellae. All the parts of the bone intervening between the necrosed portions are thickened and indurated. The patient was a man about fifty years old. The disease had made slow progress for many years before the removal of the limb. v 123. The Upper part of a Skull, exhibiting the effects of syphilitic ulceration and necrosis.. A large portion of the frontal bone exfoliated long before the patient's death ; and the

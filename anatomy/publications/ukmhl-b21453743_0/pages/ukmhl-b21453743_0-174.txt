THIRD SERIES: SUB.-SERIES C. 17. A Sternum, fractured transversely through its second portion near its junction with the third. 48. Sections of a Femur, in which there has been an oblique fracture of the shaft, extending from an inch below the trochanter minor. The fractured ends overlap considerably, the lower end being drawn upwards in front of the upper. A moderately firm union has taken place between the surfaces of bone which are in contact. The bones are very light. Prom a woman sixty-seven years old, who died five weeks after the occur- rence of the injury. 49. Portion of a Femur, in which there has been fracture extend- ing through the base of its neck, and obliquely through the base of the trochanter major. The fractured surfaces have firmly united, but the shaft has been drawn upwards and forwards, so that the head and neck of the femur appear much below their natural situation. In this position a bridge of bone has united the base of the head of the femur to the margin of the posterior inter-trochanteric ridge. 50. Portion of a Femur, exhibiting fracture of its neck of which no union has taken place. The neck of the bone is almost completely absorbed, and the surfaces by which the fractured portions were in contact are rough and hard. Deposits of osseous substance have taken place around the base of the head of the femur. From an old woman, in whom the fracture occurred nineteen years before death. Presented by J. H. B. Williams, Esq. . 51. Sections of a Femur, in which there has been fracture extend- ing through the base of its neck, and through its shaft between the trochanters. There is firm union of the fractured surfaces, with shortening of the neck and an apparent descent of it below its natural situation. The union has taken place with a great accumulation of bone about the lines of fracture. 52. Portion of a Femur, exhibiting fracture of its neck, of which

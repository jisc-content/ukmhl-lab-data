DISEASES OF BONE. 25 osseous texture, and in the rest of its extent of a cancellous texture, the cells of which were filled by an oily fluid. At the bottom of the bottle are portions of the tumour which were separated in the operation. 106. The second Phalanx of a great Toe, near the end of the upper surface of which there is an osseous tumour composed of hard and finely cancellous bone. Presented by Robert Liston, Esq. 107. The second Phalanx of a great Toe, which was removed by operation. The nail is raised and pushed aside by a tumour beneath it. A small portion of the tumour has been removed for the purpose of showing that it consists, like the last described, of hard osseous substance. Presented by Robert Liston, Esq. 108. A Section of the lower half of a Femur, and of an Osteoid Tumour which has formed around it. The tumour consists almost entirely of a solid, uniform, and very dense osseous substance. The medullary tissue of nearly all that part of the bone which is surrounded by the tumour is filled by a similar substance, and about the condyles, the walls of the femur being absorbed, the morbid growths within and without form one mass. A part of the exterior of the tumour is composed of a soft fatty-looking substance. 109. The other Section of the Femur and Osteoid Tumour last described. By maceration, the soft matter of the tumour has been removed, leaving only the hard, dense, and white osseous substance around and within the bone. The outer surface of this portion of the tumour is nodulated, and portions of it have a fibrous texture like that of pumice-stone. In the lower part of the bottle are several of the inguinal and lumbar lymphatic glands from the same side of the body as the tumour. They are converted into an osseous substance similar to that of which the tumour is composed. 110. The Femoral Artery, together with several Bony Tumours

DISEASES OF THE HEART, &c. 241 of the fore finger; the left would hut admit the entrance of the tip of the same finger. 45. A Heart and Pericardium. Lymph is deposited in a thin layer, minutely reticulated, and with some columnar processes attached to it, both upon the inner surface of the external portion of the pericardium and upon the surface of that which covers the heart. The heart is considerably enlarged. 46. Section of a Heart, in every part of which there are minute deposits of melanotic substance. Some of these deposits are beneath the pericardium, others beneath the membrane lining both the auricles and ventricles, and others are imbedded in the muscular substance.

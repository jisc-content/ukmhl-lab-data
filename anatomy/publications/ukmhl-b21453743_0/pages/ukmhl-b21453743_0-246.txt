226 ELEVENTH SERIES. 2. A large mass of Warts, removed from around the margin of the anus. 3. Part of a warty growth on the skin. The cuticle is in part separated and turned downwards, to show that it is greatly increased in thickness. 4. Section of a Foot, upon which a Corn was situated over the ball of the Great Toe. The cuticle is removed to show that the disease is confined to a thickening of that part. The cutis beneath the corn is natural, except that its vascularity is increased, and its surface impressed. 5. A large portion of Skin, removed from a Woman's back. It presents an irregular warty growth, which consists of numerous very densely-set processes, elevated on narrow pedicles. This growth had existed from infancy; it was very vascular, and had the general aspect of a large nrcvus. Case-Book, Vol. i. p. 11, No. 23. 6. A Hand, with part of the Fore-arm, which were removed on account of a growth covering nearly half the surface of the skin. The growth is warty, very vascular, superficially ulcerated, with an everted sinuous margin. It bears a close resemblance to an ulcerated cancer of the scrotum in chimney sweeps. The patient was forty-nine years old. Five years before the amputation of his hand he was employed as a gardener in strewing soot over the ground for several mornings in succession; a warty growth then formed; and it increased and ulcerated in the spring of both the two following years, v&ile he was similarly employed. After this, though he was no longer in contact with soot, the disease increased till it was removed. After the operation he completely recovered. The case is related by Sir James Earle, in his edition of Mr. Pott's Works. London, 1808, Vol. iii. p. 182. 7. A Hand, with part of the Fore-arm, which were removed on account of extensive ulceration of a carcinomatous character, which appears to have commenced in the skin. 8. Portion of Skin, with a large tabulated, dark-coloured growth.

Portion of Pleura Costalis, thickened and indurated, so that it resembles a layer of cartilage. 2. Portion of a Lung, from the surface of which a layer of false membrane formed upon the pleura has been reflected. The substance of the false membrane is compact and firm ; but its free surface is shreddy. The pleura exposed by its reflection is thickened and opaque. 3. Portion of a Lung containing tumours of lobular form, white, obscurely fibrous, and as hard as cartilage. The pulmonary texture adjacent to the tumours appears healthy. The largest tumour projects beyond the surface of the lung, and has some black substance deposited in it. 4. A Right Lung. The pleura covering its upper, posterior, and lower parts is thickened, and converted into a substance re- sembling bone. 5. Portion of the left side of a Chest, with part of the Lung adherent to the heads of the ribs. The ribs are closely approximated, and the lower intercostal spaces are obliterated. Nodulated deposits of bone have been formed in the pleura costalis : some of these form wide layers ; others form irregu- lar masses, fixed to the ribs.

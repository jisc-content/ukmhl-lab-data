1*1 INJURIES OF BON MS AND JOINTS. M . 8.5. Sections of a Femur, in vvliicli a fracture extends transversely through the shaft immediately below the neck. The lower portion has been drawn upwards and backwards, so that its upper end is on a level with the trochanter major : and in this position it is firmly united by bone to the back of the tro- chanter and of the base of the neck. .86. Portions of a Femur, in which there has been a fracture through the shaft, a little below the neck, with separation of the trochanter minor. The fracture, which is in almost ex- actly the same position and direction as that last described, was united by ligamentous substance which separated in maceration. The two preceding specimens were taken from a man aged thirty-nine. The fracture c. 85. occurred six years before death : the fracture c. 86. nine months before death. 87. Section of the Ossa Pubis of an adult, exhibiting a fracture of one of the descending rami, which has been firmly united, but with displacement of the fragments. 88. Portions of a Tibia and Fibula. Fractures extend in several directions, through the shaft and the articular end of the tibia, into the ankle-joint. The fibula also is fractured through the base of the malleolus. 89. A Scapula, with part of the Humerus, from a young person. Fracture extends through the body of the scapula, and through the base of the coracoid process. There is also a separation of the head from the shaft of the humerus in the line of the epiphytic union. 90. The Foot of a Child, exhibiting a partial dislocation of the astragalus from the os calcis, together with a fracture of the superior and anterior margin of the latter bone. The leg was amputated in consequence of other injuries received, together with this, in the passage of a carriage-wheel over the leg and foot. 91. Sections of a Tibia and Fibula, fractured through the middle of their shafts; the fractures are consolidated. There is also

DISEASES OP BONE. 75 110. A Skull-Cap, in which there has been Necrosis of a portion of the frontal bone. A groove has formed around the dead bone, and extends for some distance beneath its edges. There are cicatrices of old ulcers on the parietal bones : and the skull is heavy. 10G. A Skull-Cap, exhibiting extensive Necrosis and Ulceration of the whole thickness of the parietal bones. A groove has been formed around the dead bone ; the increased vas- cularity of the adjoining margin of the living bone is shown by the numerous minute apertures in it. As is usual, no new bone is formed on the outer table around the seques- trum ; but a thin layer of new bone is formed on that portion of the inner table to the margin of which the groove of separation, commencing in the outer table and gradually deepening, has penetrated. 107. A Skull, with syphilitic Necrosis and Ulceration of a portion of the left parietal bone. The dead bone has been in part removed. The frontal bone is tuberculated as in syphilitic disease. 108. A Skull-Cap, exhibiting Necrosis of a portion of the outer table of the frontal bone, with thickening of the inner table to a corresponding extent. The dead bone is black: pre- vious to its necrosis it appears to have been superficially ulcerated. There is a very shallow groove of separation around it. There is ulceration of the outer table of the frontal bone above the right orbit. 109. A Skull-Cap, in which there are several distinct syphilitic ulcers. The ulcers are nearly circular, and affect corre- sponding parts of both tables. Some of them present an annular form, a groove of ulceration extending round a central portion of diseased bone which is gradually removed as the groove widens towards the centre.

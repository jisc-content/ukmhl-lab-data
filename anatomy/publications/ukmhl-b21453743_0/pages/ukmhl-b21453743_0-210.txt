190 FIFTH SERIFS. 8. Portions of Muscle and Liver, from a Pig, in which are numerous cysts, like those in the preceding specimen, and probably, like them, containing cysticerci. 0 9. The upper portion of a Humerus, with part of the long tendon of the Biceps muscle. The tendon has passed out of its groove and is confined to the adjacent part of the humerus by a tough membranous sheath, formed apparently by condensed fibro- cellular tissue. The tendon was attached to the margin of the glenoid cavity in the usual manner. 10. Portion of a Humerus, with the long tendon of the biceps muscle, which, having been separated from its attachment to the scapula, has become fixed to the lesser tuberosity of the humerus. 11. A similar specimen. Both these humeri present indications of having been the seat of chronic rheumatism. 12. A Shoulder-Joint, exhibiting an enlargement of the bursa be- tween the deltoid muscle and the capsule. The lining of the bursa is smooth, like the surface of a mucous membrane. At the bottom of the bottle are numerous flat oval bodies, of moderately firm consistence, which were contained in the enlarged bursa. 13. Two enlarged Bursse, removed with the integuments from over the Patellge of the same person. The walls of both the bursae are thick, tough, and laminated, and cords are attached by one or both extremities to their internal surfaces. 14. A similar Specimen. The cyst is larger than either of the preceding, and was distended by a honey-like fluid. 15. A similar Specimen removed after death with the patella and other parts. The enlarged bursa is laid open from the front, showing its interior traversed by numerous slender tendinous cords, from some of which lobulated growths are suspended.

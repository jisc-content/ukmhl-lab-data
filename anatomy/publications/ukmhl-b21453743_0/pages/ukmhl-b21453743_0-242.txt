'22'2 NINTH SERIES. eye last described was extirpated. An oval mass of soft, dark- grey, medullary and melanotic substance, (like that external to the eye,) is imbedded on the surface of the brain, and com- presses the optic commissure, the left optic nerve, and the left carotid artery. It is loosely connected with the brain ; and the adjacent cerebral substance appears unchanged. The patient was a woman forty-three years old. The signs of the tumour in the eye had existed ahout two years. The protrusion through the sclerotica had heen increasing for nine months, when the eye was removed. At the time of the operation it was ohserved that the optic nerve, though divided close to its entrance into the orbit, contained scattered melanotic deposits. There was no reproduction of the disease in the orhit; hut the patient died with this tumour at the hase of the hrain six months after the removal of the eye. The case is de- scribed hy Mr. Lawrence, in a Clinical Lecture in the London Medical Gazette, Vol. xxxvi. p. 964, London, 1845. The hrain was presented by S. Freeman, Esq. 25. A Lacrymal Gland, enlarged so as to form an oval mass, an inch in length and more than half an inch in width. It retains its lobular form and glandular appearance; and the disease seems to have consisted in a simple increase of the gland, without change of texture. The patient was a lady forty-five years old. The enlargement of the gland had made progress for several years. She recovered after the removal of the gland.

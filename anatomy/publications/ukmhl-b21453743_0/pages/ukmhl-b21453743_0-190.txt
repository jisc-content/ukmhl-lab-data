FOURTH SERIES. Portion of a Spine, in which the articular processes of the fifth and sixth cervical vertebrae are dislocated, and the right arti- cular process and body of the sixth are broken. The inter- vertebral ligament between the fifth and sixth vertebrae is also completely torn across. The spinal chord has been divided along its middle, for the purpose of showing the soften- ing and laceration of its substance opposite the injured ver- tebrae, and especially in the line opposite the division of the intervertebral ligament. Portion of a Spine, in which there is dislocation of the articular processes of the fourth and fifth cervical vertebrae, with fracture of the lower edge of the left inferior articular process of the fourth, and a separation of the intervertebral ligaments uniting the bodies of the fourth and fifth, and of the fifth and sixth. Section of a Spine, in which there is fracture of the body of the sixth cervical vertebra. The middle and fore part of the body is crushed between the two adjacent vertebrae; and its posterior part is pressed backwards into the spinal canal, so that the spinal chord must have been nearly divided. The spinous process of the vertebra retains its natural po- sition. Presented by Henry Earle, Esq. Portion of a Spine, in which there is dislocation, with fracture of the edges of the articular processes, of the sixth and seventh cervical vertebrae. The body of the sixth cervical vertebra is separated from the intervertebral ligament below it, and pro- jects in front of the seventh. Portion of a Spine, in which there is an extensive comminuted fracture of the arches and bodies of the fifth, sixth, and seventh cervical, and first dorsal, vertebrae. Portion of a Spine, in which the right half of the posterior arch of the atlas has been completely detached by fracture.

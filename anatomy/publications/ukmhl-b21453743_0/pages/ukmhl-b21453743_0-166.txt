The tibia has been fractured in its middle, and the fibula near its upper end. Both fractures are firmly united, but with displacement and overlapping of the fractured ends, so that the tibia at the seat of fracture forms an angle directed backwards, and the fibula an angle directed outwards. Both the bones also are atrophied, and very slender. c. 2. A Tibia, Fibula, and Astragalus. The tibia has been frac- tured at the junction of the upper and middle thirds of its shaft. Its two portions, displaced laterally, have been firmly united, and the lower portion is enlarged by abundant external deposits of new bone, in which are two apertures, such as probably led to portions of dead bone. The fibula, in adaptation to the altered form of the tibia, to which also it is united by two bridges of new bone, is bent and flattened as in rickets. The lower end of the tibia is united by bone to the astragalus and to the external malleolus. c. 3. A Tibia and Fibula. The tibia has been fractured about one third from its lower end, and the fibula near its upper end. Both fragments are firmly and smoothly united, but with a slight lateral displacement, the lower fragments converging in the interosseous space.

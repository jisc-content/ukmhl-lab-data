Fibrinous deposits (vegetations) on the surfaces, 6, 17, 20,21, 55, 62, 68, 69. Deposits of earthy matter in and upon the valves, 11, 15, 16, 38, 42. 63, 64, 66, 67, 68. Ulceration, 17,21,62? Aneurism, 62. Diseases of the tricuspid valves, 44, 59. pulmonary, 55, 59, 63, 68. mitral, 4,6,7,16,19,24,26,31, 33, 39, 44, 49, 51, 59,62,63,69. aortic, 6, 7, 11,15, 17, 20, 21, 33, 38, 39, 42, 52,59, 63, 64, 66, 67, 69. Of these diseased valves, Nos. 11, 17, 21, 63, 64, 67 are instances in which there are only two valves in the aorta; and in Nos. 55, 63, and 68, the pulmonary artery has only two valves. Diseases of the Coronary arteries, 12, 37, 48. Permanent openness of the foramen ovale, 36. 1. A Heart, on the surface of which, as well as on the interior of the reflected pericardium, there is an abundant deposit of soft lymph. The outer surface of the lymph is reticulated ; its attached surface is loosely adherent. From a child sixteen months old, who died after afew days' illness. Case-Book, Vol. i. p. 11, No. 24. 2. A Heart, with the sac of the Pericardium. The heart is generally enlarged, and lymph is abundantly deposited on both surfaces of the pericardium. The lymph is firm and closely adherent; part of its surface is regularly reticular; another part forms granular and warty eminences. The reflected pericardium is thickened and indurated. 3. A Heart, on which both layers of the Pericardium were completely adherent. A part of the reflected pericardium has been re- moved to show some apparently recent lymph beneath it. The heart is enlarged. 4. A Heart, with an abundant recent deposit of lymph upon the Pericardium. The lymph is deposited in a moderately firm layer, about a line thick, from the surface of which arise numerous growths, some of which are attached by slender pedicles. The bicuspid and aortic valves are thickened. The

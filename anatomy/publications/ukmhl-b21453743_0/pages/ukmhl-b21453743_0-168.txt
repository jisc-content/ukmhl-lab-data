THIRD SERIES: SUB-SERIES C. extension of the fracture downwards through the lower half of the shaft and through the internal condyle. 10. Portion of a Femur, which has been fractured through the trochanter major and upper part of the shaft. The fracture extends for five inches downwards through the shaft. The two portions of the shaft, though not in contact, have been united by processes of bone extended between the adjacent margins of their walls; and the portions of the trochanter, remaining more nearly in contact, are closely united by bone. 11. Portion of a Femur, which has been fractured about three inches below the trochanter minor. The fracture was a comminuted one, and the portions of bone have been dis- placed, so that a considerable angle, projecting forwards, is formed at their union. ,12. Portion of a Femur, which has been fractured in its lower part. The fracture extends transversely through the shaft, and obliquely between the condyles into the knee-joint. The lower end of the shaft is driven in between the displaced and separated condyles. . 13. Portion of a Femur, fractured in its lower part. The fracture extends in several directions through the lower third of the shaft a little above the condyles, and downwards between the condyles into the knee-joint. Several small portions of bone were completely detached. c. 14. Portion of a Femur, fractured transversely into many small pieces, just above the condyles. From inflammation in the knee-joint, there has been deep and extensive ulceration of the articular surfaces of the condyles of the femur and the head of the tibia. c. 15. Portion of a Femur, fractured in exactly the same manner as c. 13. 16. Sections of a Femur, which has been fractured about four

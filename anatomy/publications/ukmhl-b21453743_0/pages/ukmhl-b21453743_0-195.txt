INJURIES AND DISEASES OF THE SPINE. 17S faces of the bodies of the cervical vertebras, from the second to the fifth, and more superficial ulceration of their anterior surfaces, with deposits of new bone. 25. Portion of a Spine exhibiting ulceration, with deposit of new bone, upon the anterior surfaces of the bodies of the lower lumbar vertebrae,â€”such disease as often exists with lumbar abscess. 26. Portion of an Occipital Bone, with the three uppermost Cervical Vertebrae. The occipital bone and the anterior half of the atlas are firmly and completely united by bone. The second and third vertebrae are similarly anchylosed at their articular processes. These changes seem to have followed ulcerative disease, by which the odontoid process and the body of the second vertebra were changed in structure, and in part removed. 27. Portion of an Occipital Bone, with the Atlas. The atlas is united to the occipital bone by new bone formed abundantly around their articulations. The atlas is also displaced towards the left side, and its right half projecting within the foramen magnum considerably diminishes the size of the aperture. 28. Second and Third Cervical Vertebras, firmly united by bone which has been, chiefly, formed round their articulations. Part of the odontoid process has been destroyed by ulceration. 29. Second and Third Cervical Vertebrae, exhibiting a complete bony union of their bodies, articular surfaces, and spinous processes, without any displacement or change of structure. 30. A similar specimen. 31. The dorsal and lumbar portions of a Spine, from a young person, exhibiting a nearly complete destruction of the intervertebral ligaments in the whole extent of the column, with ulceration of the bodies of the vertebrae. The bodies of several of the lumbar vertebra) are completely destroyed, and an angle is here

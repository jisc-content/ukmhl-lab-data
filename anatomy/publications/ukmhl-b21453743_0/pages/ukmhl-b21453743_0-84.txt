FIRST SERIES: SUB-SERIES A. 40. A Tibia exhibiting an irregular thickening of its walls in the middle and anterior part of its shaft. An ulcer in the soft parts covering the thickened bone had existed many years, and on this account the limb was amputated. Two distinct changes may be here recognized: namely, thickening by separation of the layers of the wall, and deposit of new bone on its exterior. 41. A Skull exhibiting through its whole extent an increased thickness and density of both the outer and inner tables. The increase affects also the bones of the face, but in a some- what less degree. The diploe is very hard and close-textured. . 42. A Tibia, the shaft of which is curved forwards and inwards, and enlarged in its upper half. On its anterior surface there are circumscribed deposits of new bone, such as are found under ulcers of the integuments. The curvature of the tibia is not like that which takes place in rickets, but like that in A. 46, which is due to the tibia becoming elongated at the same'time that it enlarges, and to the separation of its ends from each other as it elongates being prevented by its con- nexion with the fibula. a. 43. Sections of a Skull-Cap diseased like a. 37 ; but in a rather less degree. a 44. A Tibia and Fibula. The shaft of the tibia is generally enlarged by external deposits of new bone. The head of the fibula is united by bone to that of the tibia. A 45. A Skull-Cap exhibiting a great increase of thickness of the diploe, and of portions of the inner table, at its anterior part. The inner surface of this part has an irregular rocky appear- ance from the deposit of hard new bone. The outer surface is smooth and healthy. A 46 Sections of the Tibia of a Lad about eighteen years of age. The left tibia is nearly an inch longer than the right; in its increase of length it has become curved, its ends, confined by

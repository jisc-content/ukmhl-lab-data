28 FIRST SERIES. 118. Section of a Tumour consisting of nodules of cartilage con- nected by fibro-cellular tissue, and having specks of bone dispersed through it. It was connected with an Os Innomi- natum. The remaining part of it, consisting principa lly of bone, is preserved in the next Sub-series, A. 133. 119. Portion of a bony Cyst which was removed from the external and lateral part of a lower jaw. The cyst is lined by a thick and soft membrane which has been in part separated from it. The cavity of the cyst was filled by a glairy fluid, and at the bottom of it a canine tooth of the second set was adherent to the lining membrane. Upon the exterior of the cyst are some branches of the facial nerve which were removed with it. At the bottom of the bottle is the tooth which was contained in the cyst. 119a Part of a bony Cyst formed by expansion of the walls of ' the lower jaw of a sheep. The cyst was full of fluid, and an incisor tooth is loosely attached to its walls. 120. Section of a Tibia from a Stump, exhibiting the reparative chants which have taken place in the sawn end of the bone. The medullary cavity is closed by a thin layer of new bone and other thin osseous deposits are formed around the end of the stump. 121. Portion of a Femur from a Stump. The medullary cavity is completely closed, and there are two pointed processes of bone which extend upwards from the posterior part of the end of the femur and probably afforded attachment to the flexor muscles. 122 Portions of a Tibia and Fibula from a Stump. At the ex- ' tremity of each bone the medullary cavity is completely closed by new bone; and a bridge of new bone extends between the tibia and fibula, uniting them firmly together. 123 A Knee-Joint. A section of the head of the tibia shows a small portion of dead bone in the centre of its cancellous tex-

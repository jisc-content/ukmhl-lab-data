INJURIES AND DISEASES OF THE BRAIN, &c. i95 copiously effused upon the external surface of the dura mater. The pia mater is thickened, opaque, and indurated, both in that part which covers the external surface of the brain, and in that which penetrates between the convolutions. These changes were consequent on external injury. 5. Portion of Dura Mater, thickened and indurated, with deposit of lymph upon its internal surface. The dura mater is from a line to a line and a half in thickness, and has a tough laminated texture. 6. Portion of a Frontal Bone, with the subjacent Dura Mater. A tumour, with a coarsely nodulated surface, proceeding appa- rently from the outer surface of the dura mater, has, by its growth, caused the absorption of the bone, and has protruded through it. A portion of the tumour also is lodged between the skull and the dura mater, and projects inwards upon the anterior and upper part of the brain. 7. Portion of Dura Mater, with recent deposits of lymph upon both its surfaces. 8. Portion of Skull, with the Dura Mater, exhibiting the growth of small, flat, fleshy tumours from both the surfaces of the latter. The tumours arising from the external surface of the dura mater have caused the absorption of the bone in some situations, so that they appear on the outside of the skull The skull is considerably thickened, and the diploe appears consolidated. 9. Portion of Cerebrum, in the substance of which there is a We dark Apoplectic clot of blood, apparently recently effused. I herG [S alsÂ° an effusion of blood upon the surface of the bram beneath the arachnoid membrane. The blood within the bram is loosely connected with the sides of the cavity in which it lies. J 10. Portion of Cerebrum, in the substance of which there is an Apoplect.c clot of longer standing. The blood, partially deco- o 2

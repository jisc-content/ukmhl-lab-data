42 FIRST SERIES. ration affected large portions of the maxillary and malar bones. The separate portions of bone were exfoliated. 186. Sections of a Femur from the surface of which an osseous growth has arisen. The growth is of a flattened, elongated form, attached by a broad base, and with pointed processes directed downwards: it presents a cancellous texture sur- rounded by a thin shell of compact bone. The walls of the femur and its medullary cavity in the situation of the exostosis are perfectly sound. 187. Ring of Bone exfoliated from the end of a Tibia after am- putation. 188. Portion of a Tibia exhibiting a superficial Necrosis of its walls. The formation of the groove between the dead and the living bone has commenced; and there is a deposit of new bone around the dead bone. The other section, macerated, is in the next Sub-series, a. 103. 189 Masses of Osseous substance with small portions of the bones of the Pelvis upon which they had formed. The osseous substance consists of fine filaments loosely cohering together : it formed part of a large tumour. 190. Sections of Lumbar Vertebrae with Melanotic matter deposited in the cancellous texture of their bodies. 191. Sections of a Rib with Melanotic matter deposited in its interior. 192 Portions of a Parietal and a Frontal Bone displaying the deposi- ' tion of Melanotic matter in the diploe. In all these specimens the melanotic matter is deposited in circumscribed spots, like so much black pigment, in the bones. It does not form tumours, nor does the tissue of the bone in which it lies appear at all altered.. The three preceding preparations were taken from a wouum, Iron: whom the tunlo^No. 43 in Lies XXXV, was removed. Melanotic maUer was

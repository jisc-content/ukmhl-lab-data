INJURIES AND DISEASES OF MUSCLES, &c. 1.91 16. An enlarged Bursa, removed with the integuments from the front of a Patella. The walls of the bursa are between two and three ljnes in thickness, tough, fibrous and laminated, and its cavity was nearly filled by a substance like fibrine or imperfect false membrane, some of which is still attached to its internal surface. 17. Sections of a diseased Bursa, which was removed from the front of a Patella. In consequence of long standing disease, its walls have become from one to four lines in thick- ness, and very hard, tough, and coarsely fibrous. Its internal surface is irregular, and its cavity was filled by a small quantity of yellow fluid, in which the small white bodies, now lying at the bottom of the bottle, were contained. Most of these bodies are hollow, their walls being formed by a soft white substance. v 18. Two Bursse, which were removed from the anterior surfaces of the Patella of the same person. In each specimen the cavity of the bursa is almost completely obliterated by the formation of a firm fleshy substance in it, thickening its walls. 19. Part of a Hand and Fore-Arm, in which the sheaths of the extensor tendons of the finger and thumb have been greatly enlarged by the accumulation of fluid containing small cysts. The diseased sheaths are laid open; and one of them is shown extending up half the fore-arm. The walls of the sheaths are thickened; their internal surfaces, in many parts, granular, or like mucous membrane. The partitions between some of them appear to have been absorbed, so that several form one cavity. 20. A collection of numerous small, round, and oval Cysts, with soft pale walls, which were found in the diseased sheaths of tendons last described. They floated in an opaque, yellow, and moderately thick fluid. 21. A collection of Cysts, like those last described, but rather larger and with thinner walls, which were removed from the bursa

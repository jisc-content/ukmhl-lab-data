DISEASES OF BONE. 37 156. Portion of a Spine in which there are several excavations upon the front and sides of the bodies of the eleventh and twelfth dorsal and first lumbar vertebrae. These excavated surfaces formed part of the boundaries of an aneurism of the aorta. Around the excavations there are some deposits of new bone. 157. Sections of the second phalanx of a Great Toe, exhibiting the growth of an osseous exostosis from its extremity. The bony growth was immediately surrounded by a soft and fibrous substance which formed part of an external tumour projecting from beneath the nail. From a man aged thirty. 158. The greater part of the shaft of a young person's Fibula, which was attacked by Necrosis. The death of the bone occurred without obvious cause ; its separation was effected by exfoliation, and new bone was formed in its place. 159. Section of the lower part of a Tibia and of a Tumour con- tained within it. The tumour consists of a brain-like medullary substance, with blotches of blood effused in it, and is almost completely surrounded by a thick osseous cyst which is continuous with the wall of the tibia. It may be presumed that the morbid deposit commenced in the interior of the bone, and that, as it grew, so also the bone grew around it, with internal absorption and external deposit of new bone, and thus formed the osseous cyst. The arteries of the limb are injected; some of their branches pass through the morbid growth. 160. The other half of the Tibia and of the Tumour last de- scribed. A portion of skin is here left, in which there is ulceration with fungous growth originating in the morbid structure. The cavity immediately above the cartilage of the ankle joint was filled by soft medullary substance. The two preceding specimens were presented by Joseph Swan, Esq. The iinib was amputated by Mr. Hey, of Leeds.

DISEASES OF BONE. 77 through the anterior wall by the side of the tubercle of the tibia, and more widely into the knee-joint. The articular surfaces of both femur and tibia are ulcerated; and in the inner condyle of the femur, there is a deep cavity like that of an abscess, corresponding with the cavity in which the sequestrum lies in the head of the tibia. Presented by Thomas Sympson, Esq. 115. Portion of a Spine, exhibiting Necrosis with abscess in the cancellous texture of the body of one of the vertebrae. There is a considerable deposit of new bone upon the vertebra around the necrosed bone. Between two of the bodies, the fibro-cartilage has been removed, and they are united by bone. 116. Two Femora from the same person. There has been necrosis in the lower part of the shaft of one of these bones. The dead bone has been completely separated, and new bone is formed around the cavity in which it lay. The femur which was thus diseased is shortened to the extent of about four inches; and there is a peculiar flattening of the con- dyles, the consequence, probably, of the knee-joint having been immoveably fixed in the position of extension. 117. Portion of a Skull-Cap, exhibiting Necrosis of a previously diseased portion of its outer table. From a patient -who had a suppurating node upon the cranium in the situation and to the extent of the surface of bone which has perished. 118. Sections of a Femur, in which a portion of the whole cir- cumference of the inner layers of its wall, six inches long, has perished, and has been separated from the surrounding bone. New bone has been abundantly formed in and upon the outer layers of the wall, which separated from the se- questrum. There is not in this new bone any aperture, or cloaca, leading into the narrow space around the sequestrum. The tissue of the new bone is compact and heavy, and its surface hard and nearly smooth. It will be observed, also, that the medullary tissue is entire within the perished part

117 INJURIES OF BONES AND JOINTS. 3. Portion of a Humerus, in which fracture of the shaft occurred many years before death. The ends of the bone did not unite : they are somewhat enlarged, and are covered by a substance like fibro-cartilage, and connected by a distinct membranous capsule, which is smooth upon its internal surface, and serves as a kind of capsular ligament to the false joint which is formed between the ununited portions of the bone. From a middle-aged woman : the fracture was produced by a slight muscular effort. 4. Sections of the Cartilage of a Rib, which appears to have been fractured and reunited by new cartilaginous substance placed in the angles between the ends of its overlapping portions. 5. An Elbow-Joint, in which there has been fracture and disloca- tion. The radius and ulna are broken about two inches below the joint: and their fractured ends, not having united by bone, are connected by new capsules which have formed around them. The head of the radius is dislocated upwards and forwards in front of the humerus. 6. An Elbow-Joint, exhibiting a transverse fracture extending through the base of the olecranon into the cavity of the joint. A portion of quill is passed between the ununited fractured surfaces. 7. Portion of a Femur, exhibiting a vertical fracture of recent occurrence through that part of its neck which is covered by synovial membrane. Upon the anterior half of the circumfer- ence of the neck of the bone, the periosteal and synovial cover- ings are torn : upon the posterior half they are entire. 8. A Hip-Joint, exhibiting a vertical fracture of recent occurrence through that part of the neck of the femur which is covered by synovial membrane. The capsule is thickened, and a portion of it, which is detached and turned downwards, has lymph de- posited upon its internal surface. 9. An Os Calcis, fractured transversely through its posterior part.

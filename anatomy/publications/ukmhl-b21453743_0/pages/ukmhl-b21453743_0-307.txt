287 DISEASES OF THE LUNGS, &.c. 35. Portion of Lung, in which there are several large tuberculous cavities, with infiltration and induration of the pulmonary tissue remaining between them. Most of the cavities are lined by false membrane in thin and imperfect layers. The pleura is thickened, and false membrane is abundantly formed upon its surface. Presented by Dr. Conquest. 36. A Lung, the lower part of which is in a state of gangrene. The gangrenous portion is pulpy, flocculent, and of brownish colour ; and there are large bloodvessels extending through it, which have resisted the destructive process. Above the gangrenous portion the lung is solid and contracted, so that the entire thick- ness of the organ is here reduced to two-thirds of an inch. Over the seat of the gangrene a large portion of false membrane has formed upon the surface of the lung. 37. Portion of Lung, with melanotic matter diffused through its substance. Presented by Dr. Norris. 38. Portion of Lung, with the Pleura covering it, and the pleura which lined the corresponding part of the chest. Both these layers of pleura are considerably thickened, especially in the lower part; and the sac of the pleura is almost completely ob- literated by the adhesions of their opposite surfaces. The patient was a woman, thirty years old, who, eighteen years before death, coughed up a large quantity of pus, which, it is presumed, had been contained in the cavity of the pleura. The corresponding side of the chest was very much contracted. Case-Book, Vol. i. p. 159, No. 185. 39. A large portion of bone-like substance, which formed in a false membrane uniting the opposite surfaces of the pleura. The patient was an old man, who had long had dyspnoea and was subject to frequent affections of the chest. 40. Apex of a Lung, from a patient who died with Pneumothorax. On the anterior surface of the lung are two oval apertures, into which portions of glass are passed, and which lead into small

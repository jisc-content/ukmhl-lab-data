FOURTH SERIES; STTB-SBBTES D. but their union by bone is incomplete. The thorax is depressed anteriorly, so that a space of only two inches and a half intervenes between the ensiform cartilage and the ossa pubis, and the false ribs nearly touch the crests of the ilia. All the ribs arch upwards ; and the sternum arches forwards. 31. A Sacrum and the Fifth Lumbar Vertebra. Their articular processes are united by layers of bone, extended over their anterior surfaces. 32. A Spine, with two lateral curves in its dorsal region, and one in the lumbar. The principal curve is in the superior dorsal region, and is directed to the right side. The bodies of the vertebree are thinner on the concave, than on the convex side of each curve, and there are thin growths of bone from their edges overlapping the thinner intervertebral ligaments in each of the concavities of the curves. Presented by Thomas Wormald, Esq. . 33. Part of a Spine, with portions of the Ribs. The bodies of nearly all the vertebrae are united by layers of bone de- posited on their anterior surfaces, and projecting with smooth round surfaces in front of the intervertebral spaces. Five of the ribs are similarly united, by their heads and tubercles, to the bodies and transverse processes of the vertebrae. d 34. A Spine and Pelvis. The spine presents an acute angular curvature in its dorsal region, the consequence of the destruc- tion, by ulceration, of the bodies of the last nine dorsal and the first lumbar vertebrae. Two of the ribs are united by bone to the spine. The pelvis is well formed. v. 35. A Sacrum, with the Fifth Lumbar Vertebra. Their corre- sponding articular processes on the left side are united by bone. The canal of the sacrum is open posteriorly in its whole extent. D 36. Portion of a Spine, in which the bodies of four of the lower dorsal vertebrae have been removed by ulceration. 1 he

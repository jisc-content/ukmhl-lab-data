INJURIES OF BONKS AND JOINTS. J 47 :. 4. A Femur, which has been fractured at the junction of its upper and middle thirds. The fractured ends overlap con- siderably, the upper portion lying across the front of the lower, and the lower being much rotated outwards. In this position they are firmly united by bone formed between them and at their sides, and their medullary cavity, exposed by the fracture, is covered in by smooth thin layers of com- pact bone. . .5. A Femur, which has been fractured in the middle of its shaft. The two portions overlap to the extent of between four and five inches, the upper portion lying directly in front of the lower. They are firmly united by bone formed between them and at their sides, and the greater part of the surface of this bone is continuous with the surfaces of the overlapping frag- ments. A groove along the front of the lower part of the upper portion of the femur marks the healing of a fissure. 6. A Femur, which has been fractured transversely, immediately above the trochanter minor. The upper portion has been drawn forwards and upwards, and is firmly united to the top of the shaft, forming nearly a right angle with it. 7. Sections of a Femur, which has been fractured in the middle of its shaft. The two portions overlap considerably, the upper portion lying on the inner side of the lower. The fracture is firmly united by bone placed between and at the sides of the fragments; and the sections show that this bone is composed of cancellous tissue and compact walls, which have almost completely coalesced with the cancellous tissue and walls of the portions of the femur which it unites. 8. Portions of a Femur, fractured in two places by a wheel passing over the limb. One fracture is about one third from its upper end, and the other at the same distance from its lower end. 9. Portion of a Femur, which has been fractured transversely through the middle of its shaft, and in which there is an l 2

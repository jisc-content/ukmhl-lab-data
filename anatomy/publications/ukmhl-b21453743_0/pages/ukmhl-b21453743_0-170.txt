THIRD SERIES: SUB-SERIES C. the fibula, at and below the seat of fracture. The fracture of the fibula is firmly and smoothly united. 22. Portions of a Tibia and Fibula. There is a comminuted fracture of the tibia about two inches above the ankle, and two lines of fracture extend downwards into the ankle- joint. The fibula is fractured about four inches above the ankle. 23. Two Ribs which have been fractured. In one rib the frac- ture occurred near its middle, and in the other near its angle. There has been very little displacement of the ends of the bones, and the fractures are firmly and smoothly united. 24. A Humerus, which has been fractured in several directions, but chiefly obliquely downwards, just above the condyles. The fractures are firmly united, but an aperture remains in the line of one of them. . 25. Sections of a Humerus, which has been fractured obliquely just above the middle of its shaft, and has been firmly repaired. The shaft is strongly arched backwards, probably from rickets. . 26. Portion of a Humerus, in which there has been fracture of the upper part of the shaft extending to its neck. The portions have been widely .separated, and are firmly, but imperfectly, united by bridges of bone. . 27. A Scapula and Humerus. The head of the humerus appears to have been dislocated forwards, and to have remained long unreduced just beneath the coracoid process, on the anterior surface and neck of the scapula. A concave sur- face has been here formed, on which the head of the humerus rested. The pressure of the posterior part of the head of the humerus against the anterior margin of the glenoid cavity, has caused them both to be partially absorbed; and the remaining edge of the glenoid cavity, fitting in the recess

M FIBST SERIES. 145. Portion of an upper Jaw with two molar teeth, which separated by exfoliation. From a boy aged six years. The necrosis was consequent on a severe blow upon the face. 146. Portion of a lower Jaw containing a bicuspid and two molar teeth, which separated by exfoliation. From a boy aged four years. The necrosis occurred without any apparent cause. The loss of this portion of the jaw was completely repaired. Presented by Alexander Anderson, Esq. 147. Sections of a Tumour with the side of the body of the lower Jaw in which it originated; removed by operation. Part of the mucous membrane of the mouth, unaltered in structure, is extended over the upper surface of the tumour. The disease originated in the cancellous texture of the jaw. The walls of the bone are expanded into a thin case enclosing the tumour, but, in consequence of the absorp- tion of the bone in some situations, this case is incomplete. The morbid growth consists of granules of a peculiar fatty-looking substance, partitioned by fibro-cellular tissue, and having cells dispersed through it, which cells contained a glairy fluid. The boundaries of some of the cells are thin plates of bone, apparently the remains of the original cancellous texture of the jaw. From a man aged twenty-five. 148.

The portion ot the jaw taken away includes one side of it, from the angle to within a short distance of the symphysis. Part of the mucous membrane of the mouth, unaltered in structure, is extended over the tumour. The tumour, originating in the cancellous texture of the jaw, is surrounded by a thin shell of bone, formed by the remains of the walls of the jaw. The tumour consists of a solid and very compact fibrous substance of a greyish colour, irregularly intersected by white fibres. From a female aged Fourteen. 149.

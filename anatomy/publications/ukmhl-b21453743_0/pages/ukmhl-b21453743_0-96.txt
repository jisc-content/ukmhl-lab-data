FIRST SERIES: SUB-SERIES A. of the outer table of the frontal bone. A groove formed round the dead portion shows the progress of this part of the process for the separation of sequestra. There is also ulceration with irregular superficial necrosis of a portion of the left parietal bone. 111. A Skull-Cap, exhibiting extensive Necrosis of the outer table, and, to a small extent, of the inner table, of the frontal bone. The necrosis, as in the similar specimens, A. 105 and 107, occurred in the course of syphilitic ulcera- tion. 112. A Skull, in which, in the course of syphilitic disease there occurred necrosis of several large portions of the frontal and parietal bones. Many of the sequestra were completely separated, and the surface of the diploe and inner table exposed by their removal appears to have healed smoothly but many other portions in which the necrosxs; extends through both tables of the skull, are only partially detached The portions of the skull, which remain between those that have suffered necrosis, appear quite healthy : they were not even increased in vascularity. , 113 The lower end of a Tibia, including nearly the whole of its Idcular surface, which separated by exfoliation m a case of compound fracture. Presented by R. S. Eyles, Esq. A 114 The corresponding ends of a Femur and a Tibia. In a h avy fall, the femur was fractured about threefinches above le Id les. The fragments are firmly united; but he upper one lies in front of the lower, overlapping it. In con- sequence of the same injury, necrosis ensued m a smal portion of the tibia, including part of its articular surface. The sequestrum, when the limb was amputated many years after the injury, was found loose, where it is now fixed, in a large cav ty in the head of the tibia, which cavity opens

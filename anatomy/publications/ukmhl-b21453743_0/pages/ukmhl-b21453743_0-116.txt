,Ki SECOND SERIi-S there is an irregular deposit of new bone in ridges and sharp processes. 31. Bones of a Knee-Joint, exhibiting the effects of inflammation. Parts of the free surface of the cartilage upon each bone have been absorbed. There has also been a more extensive absorp- tion of the deep or attached surface of the cartilage, so that its connexion with the bone was loosened, and it was readily separable from it. Where the absorption of the deep surface ot the cartilage has taken place, granulations have arisen from the h0lnthe recent state the bones were seen to be exceedingly vascular; and it was presumed^inflammation of their articular surfaces preceded the other changes in the joint. 32. The articular portions of a Femur and a Patella exhibiting partial absorption of the articular cartilages, and loosenmg of their connexion with the bones. The cartdage upon the patella has been absorbed in its centre, and separable from the bone, except at its border, where .t stdl Jintains its natural firmness of connexion. Upon the postermr part of the condyles of the femur, the whole th.ckness of the cartilage is absorbed: the exposed surface of the bone ,s rough and very vascular. 33 The articular portions of two Femora and two Patelte from the ^ame individual. A deposit of white earthy matter the effec Tgout, has taken place upon the surface of thetr arttcula. cartilages. 34 Portion of a Knee-joint, with various growths from the internal 3 ^rface of its synovial membrane. Most of sist of fringes of slender and leaf-like processes of a soft fib ous l ure; others are firmer and approach to cartdage m the character and one is a flattened, nodulated growth of bone "by a thin membrane. The other structures of the ,o,n. appear healthy. 35. Portion of a Femur from n young subject. Disease com-

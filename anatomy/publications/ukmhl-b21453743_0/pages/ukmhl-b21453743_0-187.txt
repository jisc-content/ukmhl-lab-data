167 INJURIES OF BONES AND JOINTS. c. 114. A Femur, which sustained a comminuted fracture just below the trochanters. The fragments are united, with considerable displacement, by several short bridges of bone extending between them. The shaft of the femur is completely everted; the condyles are directed straight outwards; and the upper fractured end of the shaft lies behind the great trochanter. Presented by J. F. Crookes, Esq. .115. Portions of a Femur, which was fractured vertically through the neck, at the base of the head, a few weeks before death. The plane of fracture is irregular and the fragments were locked together : so that the principal indications of fracture were absent. .116. Portions of two Femora. The larger portion, comprising the head, neck, and upper half of the shaft of the left femur, exhibits the effects of two fractures which were produced at different times by very slight forces. The first fracture, which occurred about two inches below the lesser trochanter, is firmly united, but in such a manner that the two portions form an angle of about 75Â°. The second fracture happened a few days before death ; it passes transversely, but very irregularly, through the shaft of the bone. The smaller portion, consisting of a section of the right femur, exhibits an exactly similar union of a fracture like that which first occurred in the left thigh. The rest of this bone is preserved in the 1st Series, No. 92. The texture of the bones is soft, light, and spongy, and infiltrated with fatty matter. 117. The upper part of a Femur, in which a fracture extends obliquely downwards and inwards, from the middle of the great trochanter through the base of the neck, and ends just above the lesser trochanter. There is no union of the fragments; but they are held together by portions of the periosteum. From a man eighty-two years old, who died a fortnight after tho injury, which was produced by a fall on the floor. The limb directly after the

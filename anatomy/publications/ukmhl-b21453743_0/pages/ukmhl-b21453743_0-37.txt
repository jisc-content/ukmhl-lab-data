17 DISEASES OP BONE. but of the thickening of their walls. The new bone by which they are increased in thickness is hard, nearly solid, and heavy ; it is almost all formed on their inner surfaces ; only a few small similar growths are elevated on their outer surfaces, and project on the face and into one of the orbits. The septum nasi and spongy bones are similarly thickened, enlarged, and very dense in their texture. 63. A Sternum, in which there is Necrosis of the central part and whole thickness of the bone. The surfaces of the dead bone are ulcerated : those of the surrounding part of the sternum are covered by new bone. 64. A Tibia, exhibiting Necrosis of a portion of its anterior wall. The dead bone, distinguishable by its black colour, was in pro- cess of separation from the living bone, a deep groove being formed between them. Its surface was in part removed by ulceration previous to its death. The walls of the bone, around the exfoliating portion, are thickened and of a porous texture. 65. A Tibia from a young subject, in which there has been Necrosis of nearly the whole Shaft. There are several distinct forma- tions of new bone around the sequestrum, and these are placed opposite to those parts on which its surface is rough in conse- quence of the removal of its outer layers. The lower articular surface is destroyed by ulceration. Presented by A. Sicard, Esq. 66. Bones of Fingers which separated by exfoliation. 67. Portions of a Tibia which separated by exfoliation. 68. Portion of a Tibia which separated by exfoliation. 69. A Tibia, of which a large portion of the shaft suffered Necrosis and is nearly separated. There is abundant formation of new bone around the old and dead bone. 70. A section of the lower end of the Femur of a Child, in which there is a circumscribed abscess, the result, perhaps, of tuber- c

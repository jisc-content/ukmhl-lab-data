THIRTEENTH SERIES â€¢260 extended itself on each side inlo the lung. A portion of the sac in the right lung is laid open, and is filled by laminated coagulum. On the left side, the ragged surfaces of the sac, and the shreds of coagulum protruding through it, mark the situation in which the aneurism burst into the chest. 40. A Femoral Artery, from a Stump. Its coats are thickened, and earthy matter is abundantly deposited in them. In conse- quence of the occurrence of hemorrhage after the amputation, a second ligature was placed around the artery, about two inches above its extremity. This ligature had separated before death ; and a portion of whalebone is passed into the aperture through which it was withdrawn. The cavity of the artery, above and below the situation of this ligature, is filled by lymph and clots of blood, which extend to a consider- able distance up the vessel. The cut end of the artery is open. 41. The Arch of an Aorta, which is the seat of an Aneurism, by the progress of which the left Subclavian Artery is ob- literated. The walls of the sac appear to be formed entirely by the thickened and dilated coats of the artery. At the back of the preparation is the arteria innominata, with the left carotid artery; in the front and lower part is the left sub- clavian artery, obliterated at its origin by fibrine extending from that which lines a part of the aneurismal sac. There is a wide irregular aperture produced by the rupture of the end of the sac. 42. The commencement of the Aorta, with two small Aneurismal Sacs, just above and behind two of the semilunar valves. The coats of the artery are thickened, and its internal surface is tuberculated. One of the sacs is nearly filled by laminated coagulum. 43. A Carotid Artery, with a large Aneurism at its division. The sac is globular and completely filled by layers of coagulum loosely connected. A portion of straw is passed through the narrow opening of communication between the sac and the

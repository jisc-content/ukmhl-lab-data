SERIES X. DISEASES OF THE EAR. 1. Section of an Ear, exhibiting a growth of substance, like firm granulations, from the membranous lining of the tympanum. A portion of the growth is firmly adherent to the membrana tympani. 2. A Temporal Bone, in which ulceration has extended from the meatus auditorius externus, through the greater part of the base of the petrous portion of the bone, and has destroyed nearly all the cavity of the internal ear. 3. A Fleshy Excrescence, or Polypus, which was removed from the inside of the meatus auditorius externus. Part of its sur- face is smooth ; the rest is nodular and warty. 4. A similar, but smaller, Specimen. It is suspended by the narrow pedicle which attached it to the lining of the meatus. 5. Portion of the left Temporal Bone of a young man. A section has been made along the meatus auditorius externus, and through the cavity of the tympanum. The membrana tym- pani is very much thickened, and there is an ulcerated aperture near its anterior margin, through which a bristle is passed into the cavity of the tympanum. Another bristle is passed through a passage formed by ulceration, which leads from the tympanum

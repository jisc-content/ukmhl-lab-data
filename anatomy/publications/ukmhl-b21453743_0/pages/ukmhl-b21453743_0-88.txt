68 FIRST SERIES : SUB-SERIES A. Some of them, especially one on the frontal bone, show that they commenced in an annular form, an ulcerated groove forming round a portion of diseased bone, which portion was subsequently removed by the widening of the groove. The inner table is very vascular and less extensively ulcerated. Parts of the outer table are tuberculated. a 64 A Skull-Cap, in which there are numerous oval, rough-edged ' apertures. Some extend through both tables ; some are in the outer, others in the inner table alone. Inere has also been extensive destruction by ulceration of the frontal bone. The portions of skull between the apertures are healthy. , , .. It is most probable tbat these changes we consequent on the growth ot medullary tumours. a. 65. A Skull-Cap, exhibiting extensive superficial ulceration of the outer table. a 66. Portion of a Skull, in which nearly the whole surface of the outer table is tuberculated and ulcerated. In the greater part of its extent the disease resembles that described in A. 34, 35, and other preceding specimens; but over the occipital bone the ulceration presents the more diffuse rough, jagged form which belongs to that occurring in acute inflammation and suppuration on the surface of a bone. a 67. A Skull-Cap, in which a large portion of the outer table of the frontal bone is rough, grey, porous, and tu- berculated, presenting the same change as has preceded the ulceration in many of the specimens just described. In this case ulceration has commenced in only two or three points about the middle of the diseased surface. The corresponding portion of the inner table is porous, as if it had been more than naturally vascular, but is not otherwise diseased. A. 68. A Skull-Cap, exhibiting ulceration of a small circumscribed

THIRD SERIES. ui fractured surfaces are united by a thick layer of tough fibrous tissue, permitting a slight degree of motion between them. 120. The external Condyle of a Boy's Humerus, which was com- pletely detached in a compound fracture. The fracture was repaired without the supervention of any untoward symp- toms ; and the hoy recovered a free power of rotation, and a limited power of flexion and extension, of the arm. 121. An Astragalus, which was removed by operation from a Foot dislocated ten days previously. The foot was dislocated inwards, and the astragalus, which appeared to be par- tially separated from its connections with the rest of the tarsus, was carried far forwards and outwards. The dislocation, which was a compound one, but with- out fracture of the fibula, was reduced; but extensive suppuration followed, and the astragalus, becoming again displaced and presenting itself at an external wound, was removed. Subsequently, a considerable portion of the ligaments connected with it sloughed ; but, a month after the injury, the case was making favourable progress.

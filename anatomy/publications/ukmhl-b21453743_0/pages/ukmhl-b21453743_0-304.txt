FOURTEENTH SERIES. '284 tubercles and by tuberculous matter diffusely infiltrated in the substance of tbe lung. % ' *' 13. Portion of a Lung, exhibiting medullary substance infiltrated in large portions of its tissue. 14. Bronchial Glands, nearly the whole substance of which is re- placed by earthy matter. 15. Sections of Bronchial Glands, which are greatly enlarged, and in which the place of the natural texture is occupied by a soft medullary substance. In one of them there are large cavities in the medullary substance, which were filled with blood. The right bronchus is compressed by the diseased glands. 16. Bronchial Glands, with the bifurcation of the Trachea and the adjacent parts. The bronchial glands are much enlarged, and tuberculous matter is deposited in them. The vena cava superior is flattened, and its calibre much reduced. Both the main branches of the pulmonary artery are also much com- pressed by the enlarged glands. 17. Bronchial Glands, with the Trachea, Heart, and Large Vessels. The glands are enlarged, and soft medullary matter is exten- sively formed in them. From the same child as No. 19 in Series VI. Case-Book, Vol. i. p. 60, No. 106. 18. Portion of a Lung, in which there is a circumscribed cavity lined by a thin layer of false membrane. The surrounding substance of the lung is indurated and contracted, and contains some other similar cavities of smaller size. The pleura is much thickened and indurated, and its layers between the lobes of the lung are united. It is probable that the cavities were formed in the progress of tuberculous disease. 19. Portions of a Lung, in which masses of a firm, white, cancerous substance are irregularly deposited. Some of the small branches of the pulmonary artery are filled with a similar

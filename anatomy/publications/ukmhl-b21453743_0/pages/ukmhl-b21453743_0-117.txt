97 DISEASES OF JOINTS. mencing in the hip-joint, has in its progress occasioned a separa- tion of the head of the femur in the line in which, as an epi- physis, it was connected with the neck. There is also ulcera- tion of a part of the surface of the head and neck of the bone. 36. Bones of a Knee-Joint, exhibiting the effects of Inflammation, which it was presumed commenced in the synovial membrane. The greater part of the articular surfaces of the tibia and femur is deeply ulcerated; the portions of them which remain, are hardened and polished like ivory. Upon the exterior of each bone, contiguous to its articular surface, there is an irregular deposit of osseous substance. 37. Section of a Femur, exhibiting the effects of inflammation of the cancellous texture and articular surface of one of its con- dyles. The increased vascularity of the bone is evinced by the degree in which its vessels have received injection. The connexion of the articular cartilage with the bone was loosened so that it was readily separated. 38. The Bones of a Great Toe, in which, probably in consequence of gout, the articular surfaces of the metatarsal bone and first phalanx are in part destroyed, and there is an abundant deposit of hard nodulated new bone around their borders. 39. Portion of an Elbow-Joint, in which there are several car- tilaginous growths from the internal surface of the capsule, immediately above the olecranon. Two of these are closely attached to the capsule. A third is attached to it by a round and thin pedicle apparently formed by the synovial membrane. One portion of cartilaginous substance, which was found loose in the joint, is at the bottom of the bottle. 40. A Knee-Joint from a young subject, amputated on account of disease of the synovial membrane (see No. 41). The articular cartilages and bones are unaltered. The lateral ligaments are apparently unaltered in structure, but are considerably elongated, and have permitted displacement of the articular surfaces.

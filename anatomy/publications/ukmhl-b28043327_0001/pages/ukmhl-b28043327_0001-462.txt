440 INNERVATION. [chap. xv. rally inclined backwards. These epithelial processes are more stiff, according as the particles of which they consist approach more nearly to the dense texture of hair; and a few among them actually enclose minute hairs, pointed at the end, and pro- vided in some cases with an extremely fine central canal. One of the largest of these we found of an inch long, and from ~J00 to —-— of an inch thick (fig. 100, 2). The others have an imbricated 3 0 0 0 v . . arrangement of the particles in various degrees, which will be understood without detailed description on reference to figure 100, ,‘j, 4, 5. Many of them may be regarded as soft or uncondensed hairs, and preserve the same thickness for a considerable length. The structure of the secondary papillae, from which these hair-like processes pass off, differs somewhat from that of the simple papillae in the situations previously described. This difference consists in their larger size and more pointed form, as well as in their greater stiffness Fif’. 101. a. Secondary papilla of the conical class, treated with acetic acid : a Its basement membrane b. Its nerve-tube forming a loop c. Its curly elastic tissue. The epithelium in this instance is not abundant; but the vertical arrangement of its particles over the apex of the papilla is well seen, rf, and illustrates the mode of formation of the hair-like processes described in the text.

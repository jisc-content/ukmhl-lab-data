CHAP, i.] 57 OF PROFER SENSATION. which the change excited by the stimulus at one part of the nerve is conveyed throughout its course to the muscle, or to the brain or other nervous centre, with which it may be connected, producing i in them the same or an analogous state. As these phenomena occur in tissues, whose chemical composi- tion is more complex than that of any others in the body, and which are the seat of continual changes, they are subject to many . disturbing causes, and are easily affected by slight modifications in the general state of the system. Many substances quickly exert an influence upon them, as opium, strychnine, and various seda- tives, narcotics, or stimulants. Those properties are therefore en- tirely dependent on the nutrition of their respective tissues ; they quickly vary with the state of that function, and when it ceases, in death, they vanish with it.* * For information upon the subjects treated of in this chapter we refer to the following sources :—Ilenle, Algcmeine Anatomic; Berzelius, Cbimie Organiquo, Fr. edit. 1833; Prout on Stomach and Urinarv Discuses; Liebig’s Animal Chemistry, by Gregory; Graham's Chemistry; Ihuiicll’s Chemistry; Schwann, Mikroskopiscbe Untersuchungen flber die TJebereinstitnnmng in dor Struktnr und dem Wachsthmn der Thiere und 1’Hanzen; Dutroehet, article Endosmosc, in the Cyclopaedia of Anatomy and Physiology.

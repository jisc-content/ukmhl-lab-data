] NERVES. 215 CHAP. VIII Fie. S7- In most situations where vesicular matter is found in the nervous centres, tubular fibres of small though variable size mingle with its elements in greater or less number, and in some places both varieties of fibre are found (figs. 57 & 58). To de- termine the precise connex- ion which these respective elementary parts form with each other is a problem of the deepest interest. No more, however, can be said respecting it at present, than that the relation of nerve-fibres to nerve-vesicles iu the centres is most inti- mate, and that the latter are rarely met with without one J % # a.

Of Nerves.—A bundle of nerve-fibres, surrounded and connected by areolar tissue, constitutes a nerve.

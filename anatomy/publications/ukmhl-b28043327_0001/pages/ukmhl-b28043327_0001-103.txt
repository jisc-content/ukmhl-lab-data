The vessels are thus attcnd- d by fat vesicles, for the manifest pur- poose of protection from the pressure to which they would be exposed in their ppon course, and they throw around each ‘vesicle a capillary loop. Where the fat is in considerable quantity, it is commonly sub- livided into a number of small fragments or lobules, fitted accu- rately to one another and invested with areolar tissue, for the pur- pose, chiefly, of permitting motion between the parts of the mass, >ut, also, for the convenience of the distribution of its blood-vessels.

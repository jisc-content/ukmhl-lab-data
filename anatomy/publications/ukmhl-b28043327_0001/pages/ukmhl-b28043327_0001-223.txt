The function of innervation is effected through the medium of ;he nervous system, which, ramified throughout the body, and connected with and passing between its various organs, serves them as a bond of union with each other, as well as with the sentient principle of the animal. The mind of man influences his 'orporeal organs through the instrumentality of this system, as vhen volition or emotion excites them to action ; and, on the other land, certain changes in the organs or textures of the body may effect the mind through the same channel, as when impressions made • 1*011 them excite mental perceptions. In this way the nervous system becomes the main agent of what has been called the life f relation; for without some channel for the transmission of the landates of the will to the organs of motion, or some provision for he reception of those impressions which external objects are capable f exciting, the mind, thus completely isolated, could hold no com- nmion with the external world. The nervous system, however, can act independently of mental ifluence. A material or physical change in the nervous substance, f neonnected with any affection of the mind, is capable of exciting | <e action of nerves, and consequently of those organs which are ! ibject to their influence. Some kind of molecular change in the * ervous matter is all that is at any time required for the deve- ; ‘pement of its peculiar power; and it is as easy to conceive | *at this alteration may result from some organic cause, as from 1 ental influence. Of this kind, no doubt, are all those nervous ) 'tions with which are associated the functions of (he life of 5 >e individual, or, in the language of Bichat, of organic life ; an ■ -seutial character of which is, that they are completely removed orn the influence of the will. p

But all the osseous tissue with which the human anatomist is eon- eerued is of such hulk as to contain the series of pores and cavities already alluded to for the conveyance of fluid from and to its vas- cular surface. These jwres always advance into the bone from fpen orifices on its surface. They soon arrange themselves in sets, each of which, after anastomosing with neighbouring ones, dis- charges itself into a small cavity or lacuna, in which its individual wores coalesce. From the sides of this feaeuna other pores pass off to similar eavities in the vicinity, and others pro- ceed from its opposite surface to pene- trate still deeper into the tissue. These >our themselves into another lacuna, or Hi vide themselves between two or three, vhich are connected in like manner by ateral channels.

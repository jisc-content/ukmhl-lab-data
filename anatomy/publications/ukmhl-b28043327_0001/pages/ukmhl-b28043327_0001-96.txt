The larger ot these bands are often as wide as ? of an inch ; they branch, or unite with others, Here Fig. 6. Fig. 7. The two elements of Areolar tissue, in their natural relations to one another:—«. The white fibrous element, with cell- nuclei, i, sparingly visible in it. b. The yellow fibrous ele- ment, shewing the branching or anastomosing character of its fibrilhe. c. Fibrillse of the yellow clement, far finer than the rest, but having a similar curly character, d. Nucleolated cell-nuclei, often seen apparently loose.—From the areolar tissue under the pectoral muscle, magnified 320 diameters. Developemcnt of the Areolar tissue (white fibrous element):—v. Nucleated cells, of a roundeii form. f. g. h. The same, elongated in different degrees, and branching. At A, the elongated extre- mities have joined others, and are alrea- dy assuming a distinctly fibrous cha- racter.—After Schwann. and there. The smaller ones are often too minute to be visible, except with a good instrument. These are the white fibrous element. The others are long, single, elastic, branched filaments, with a dark, decided border, and disposed to curl when not put on the stretch. These interlace with the others, but appear to have no continuity of substance with them. They are for the most part about the -^Vo °f an inch in thickness ; but we often see, in the same specimen, others, of much greater density. These form the yeHow fibrous element (fig. (i). These two tissues may be most easily discriminated by the addi- tion of a drop of dilute acetic acid, which at once swells up the former, and renders it transparent, while it produces no change in

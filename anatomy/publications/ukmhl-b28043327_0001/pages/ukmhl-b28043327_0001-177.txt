THE SARCOLEMMA. CHAP. VII.] 1 r ^ 1 00 In fig. 39 is represented the border of some fibres, from which several of the sarcons ele- ments have been removed accidentally by ma- ceration in weak spirit. The remaining ones pro- jject in lateral series, evincing their adhesion to one another in that direction, and the non-exist- < ence of any spiral arrangement. The size of the particles composing the fibre i may be measured in one direction by the trans- verse stripes formed by their union. The following average, deduced from nume- ?rous observations, shews great uniformity in tliis t respect.

It is important to remark, that these measure- ments are taken from uncontracted specimens, since during con- traction the relative diameters of the particles are changed. Of the Sarcolemma.—The striped fibre is enclosed in a tubular "sheath or sorcolemma, adapted to its surface, and adhering to it. Tlii consists of a transparent, very delicate, but tough and elastic membrane, which isolates the fibre from all other tissues. In .general, it has no appearance of any kind of structure; but in the ease of bulky fibres, where it is strong in proportion, faint indica- tions may be detected of a com- * Fig 40 plex interweaving of filaments far too minute to be individually re- ‘cognized. It occasionally has ■Mil.all corpuscles, the remains of cell-nuclei, in contact with it. This membrane may be some- times seen forming a transparent Wi.lw to the fibre beyond the Fig. 39. No of

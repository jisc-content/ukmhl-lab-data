The surface of the section presents at the situation above described a remarkable layer or capsule of gray matter, surrounding in great part an oval space; the gray layer has an undulating dis- position, and is convex towards the surface, but open towards the crus. The precise object of this remarkable structure is not known; hut the microscopic investigation of it shews that in it there is a mingling of the elements of the vesicular and fibrous substances. The central stem, or crus, around which each hemisphere of the cerebellum is developed, is formed by three bundles of fibres, each

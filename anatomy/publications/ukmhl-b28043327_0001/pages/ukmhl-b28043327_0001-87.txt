»•] THAI*. 65 MOTIONS OF SPERMATOZOA. Fif. 3, Wherever the direction of the motion lia-s been ascertained, it is that which would he favourable to such a purpose. In the bron- chial tubes and trachea, the direction of the motion is towards the ’larynx, so that the cilia maybe regarded as agents of expectoration, lin the nose of the rabbit, Dr. Sharpey observed the impulse to be Jdirected forwards, and in the maxillary sinus it appeared to pass s tewards the back part of the cavity, where its opening is situated. In the Fallopian tula*, the direction i- stated by Purkinje and 'Valentin to la; from the fim- Ihriated extremity towards Hike vagina. It seems very ■probable that ciliary motion psxists in the kidney, at the (Marrow neck of each urinifor- ous tube, as it passes off from ithe capsule of the Malpighian ibody. This has not been ac- Uually observed in the human ^subject. It was discovered, j&aud has been frequently seen fin the frog,* and is shewn sin the annexed drawing, I (fig. 3.) The movement is there directed towards the uri- Hiiferous tube, and it doubt- Mess is destined to favour the fifiow of the aqueous portion »of the secretion from the j-capsule to the tube. In the inferior animals the podia seem to answer a simi- par end to that in man. ifEhey exist extensively on ^respiratory surfaces, and in r connexion- with the genera- |tive organs; and also, but to a less degree, with the I organs of digestion. Tbit in i some situations, both in man and in the inferior creatures, it is difficult to determine, what functions the ciliary motion can per- form. Such are. in man, the ventricles of the brain; and, in the * Bowman, Phil. Turn*. 1842. v Un^MWUtubeofPnw » kidney, ari«ir.g from cai«ulr „f Malinfflim o. Caritrof Omtulir. A.

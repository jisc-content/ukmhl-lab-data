In these exam- [ pies, the minute detachment of lithe fibrous tissue may he seen to jppass, and to become attached to |t the truncated extremity of the £fibre. The fibre ends by a per- fect disc, and with the whole Usnrface of this disc the tendon is Reconnected and continuous.

The researches of Valentin and Schwann have shewn that a I muscle consists, in the earliest stage, of a mass of nucleated cells, |vwhich first arrange themselves in a linear series, with more or less rregularity, and then unite to constitute the elementary fibres.

96 LOCOMOTION. [chap. iv. The circumferential fibro-cartilages contain a considerable pre- dominance of fibrous tissue. The non-articular form of fibro-cartilage is found deposited on the surfaces of the grooves in bones, which lodge tendons; as, for example, the groove for the lodgement of the tibialis posticus. In intimate structure it resembles the articular forms. Reparation and reproduction.—Fibro-cartilage heals by a new substance of similar texture. Sometimes the union of bone is effected by a material of this kind, in cases where osseous union cannot be obtained. In addition to the works on General Anatomy mentioned at the end of the last chapter, we refer to Muller’s Physiology, by Baly, p. 390 ; the articles Cartilage and Fibro-cartilage, in the Cyclopaedia of Anatomy ; and Mr. Toynbee’s paper on Non- vascular Tissues, in Phil. Trans. 1841.

So general is the connexion of the two tissues, and so apparently indispensable for the subjection of the muscles to the purposes of the organism of which they con- stitute a part, that we may regard it as constant and necessary. The distribution of the nerves through muscular structures has always been a subject of great interest with those who looked to this line of inquiry for some clue to the explanation, either of that won- derful active connexion subsisting between them, or of the nature of the contractile act itself. But though the anatomical results accruing from this inquiry are of a highly satisfactory kind, considered in themselves alone, yet they cannot be said to have hitherto con- tributed in any great degree to the elucidation of these mysterious questions. The best mode of inspecting the arrangement of the ultimate nervous twigs is, to select a very thin muscle, as one of the abdominal muscles of any small animal, or one of the muscles of the eye of a small bird, to steep it in weak acetic acid, and then to thin it out under the compressorium. The primi- tive tubules of the nerve may then be readily distinguished with a moderately high power. They separate from one another at first in sets, afterwards in twos, threes, or fours; and, if these be followed, they will be found ulti- mately separating from one another, forming arches, and returning either to the same bundle from which they set out, or to some neighbouring one (fig. 48). In this loop-like course they accom- pany to some extent the minute blood- vessels, but do not accurately follow them in their last windings, since their distribution is in a different figure. They pass among the fibres of the muscle, and touch the sarcolemma as they pass; but, as far as present researches have informed us, they are entirely precluded by this structure from all contact with the contractile Fig 48.

The periosteal and medullary layers are also well seen S i the same section, the latter curving inwards to constitute the i alls of the cancelli. These two layers are of very irregular thick- ess, as the Haversian rod- encroach on them unequally (fig. 2o). On a further examination of such a section, with a sufficient mag- ifving power, we observe the lacunae of the periosteal and medul- ry layers facing those surfaces, and their pores opening upon them ; bile the lacunte of each Haversian layer all face the corresponding anal, and their pores radiate from it (fig. 2t>, and the previous fig. i, more highly magnified). The . ■ J i r. . sfi. cume facing the Haversian sur- ce are generally curved conceu- a * ... f , v acidly with it. They are more atnerous, and their pores more eundant, on the side where there most osseous substance, and sherc it consequently extends rthest from the source of nutri- ent, the Haversian vessel.

The outer lacunte belonging to an Haversian canal sometimes ad out pores to anastomose with those of the neighbouring rods ; t this seems to happen chiefly where the contiguous rods have d sprung from a common stock. Occasionally, also, lacuna' of ■cgular shape (as at fig. 2G) lie in the interval of two or more ds, and communicate with lacunte of all of them ; hut, in general, e outermost pores of the extreme lacunae droop hack on all sides ?• 24, b\ (/), and re-enter the penultimate series of their own rod. Owing to this arrangement, there always appears a transparent crval between contiguous rods; the pores and lacunte not existing m‘ intercept the passage of the light (fig. 2<i). This is a

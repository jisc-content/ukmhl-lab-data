ADVERTISEMENT. The following work is intended to furnish the Student and Practitioner in Medicine and Surgery with a plain and accurate view of the intimate structure and functions of the human body, and is accommodated, in its plan and arrangement, to the physi- ological lectures delivered in King's College, London. The authors have had a joint share in its composition, and are equally responsible for all it contains. Incorporated in various parts of the work, the reader will find opinions expressed, relating both to the structure and functions of parts, more or less at variance with those generally received. To these the authors for the most part have been led during their anxious attempts to render their descriptions direct and faithful transcripts from nature. Historical details, conflicting statements, and intricate dis- cussions of doubtful physiological questions, have been almost wholly avoided, as being inconsistent with the end in view. The authors desire to acknowledge their obligations to Mr. Vasey, the able and intelligent artist, by whom the engravings have been executed on wood. They have likewise to express their regret at the delay which has occurred in the progress of their work. When the First Part was published in February, 1813, it was thought that the remainder might appear in two more Parts in the course of the following year. As their labours proceeded, however, it became necessary in some measure to modify the original plan, and to produce the work in two Volumes, of which the First is now complete. The remaining Volume will follow in two Parts at an early period. King't College, London, Afrril, 1845.

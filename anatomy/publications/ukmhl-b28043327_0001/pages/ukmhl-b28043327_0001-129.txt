VESSELS OF BONE. 107 NHAP. V •] Fig. 10. pretty uniformly through the tissue, and inosculate everywhere with ne another. In the long and short bones they follow the same j, eneral direction as the axis of the bone, and Irre joined at intervals by cross branches. ''he meshes thus formed are more or less [Sblong (fig. 19). The deeper ones open ito the contiguous cancelli, with the ca- ufities of which they are continuous. The arteries and veins of bone usually Ifccupy distinct Haversian canals. Of boese the venous are the larger, and com- jponly present, at irregular intervals, and specially where two or more branches meet, pouch-like dilatations, calculated to ferve as reservoirs for the blood, and to belay its escape from the tissue. In many iff the large bones, particularly in the fiat and irregular ones, the veins are exceed- ingly capacious, and occupy a series of ortuous canals of remarkable size and very liharacteristic appearance. These are well ^escribed bv Breschet in his elaborate ai 'ork on the venous system; from which the accompanying figure fig. 20) is taken. These aanals run, for the most part, i the cancellated structure if the bones, and are lined ■yy a more or less complete uyer of compact tissue, which ASelf often contains minute laversian canals. The veins hey contain discharge them- selves separately on the sur- face. The Haversian canals vary :>» diameter from to he 5J5 of an inch, or more, he average being about hv- Their ordinary distance from one another is about rio of n inch. They may be regarded as involutions of the surface of the ■one for (he purpose of allowing vessels to come into contact with in greater abundance.

If the specimen K-ae examined deeper in hhe bone, even at u depth >bf -jV or i of an inch, other appearances are met With. The lamella; of oone enclosing the can- jelli are no longer simply laomogeneous or finely granular in texture, hut iaave acquired more the swapeet of perfect bone. fThcy are also thicker, and include in their substance elongated oval spaces, which, excepting hat they are of a roughly granular nature, exactly resemble the iacurut of bone already described. They are evidently the nucU i if the cells of the temporary cartilage. They are scattered at pretty uniform distances apart, and they all follow ’ lie direction of the lamella; to which they oelong (fig. 32, </, o). The curvilinear out- line of their now ossified cells can often be martially discerned (fig. 32, e). Within the cancelli, only a few cells can lx; Wetectcd, these cavities being chiefly occupied iy a quantity of new substance, consisting of Tyrannies, and resembling a formative blastema w basis, like that out of which all the tissues Mure evolved (fig. 32, /, and fig. 33, i). The s?ells that are met with are in apposition with he wall; and sometimes (asin fig. 32, et) one if them seems half ossified, and its nucleus about to become a lacuna. The nuclei of these cells have now always the same direc- tion as the neighbouring lacuna?. In fig. 33, taken from a little deeper in .he Ixme, we have portions of three cancelli, -. i. together with the osseous material, now considerable thickness, that intervenes be- tween them. In the centre of this last is ?seen a lamella, l, of a peculiar kind, eontain- *"g no luciuue, and quite distinct from the layers, h, /<., between which it lies. These consist of nucleated Another j>ortion from the vant* specimen:—t. i.». Portion of three cancelli, containing blas- tema, and having lietwccn them the wall of bone. The interior of this wall, ly u finely granular, and contains no lacuna*, being the lamina first formrd Ixrtween the row* of cell* in the cartilage.

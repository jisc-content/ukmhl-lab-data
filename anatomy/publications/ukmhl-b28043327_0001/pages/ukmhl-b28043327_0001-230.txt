We are ignorant of the nature of the colouring material of the former. John states that the vesi- cular substance is deficient in white fatty matter, and that its albu- men is less tenacious than that of the fibrous substance. Of the Fibrous Nervous Matter.—Of the two kinds of nervous matter, the fibrous is that which is most extensively diffused throughout the body. It not only forms a large portion of the nervous centres, either alone or mixed with vesicular matter, but it is the principal constituent of the infinite multitude of nerves which connect them with the various tissues and organs. The structure of the fibrous matter should be examined in a piece of nerve, and in a thin section from the white part of a nervous centre, as the brain or spinal cord. These should be torn with needles, so as to separate and isolate as much as possible the elementary parts, and to remove, as far as may be practicable, extraneous tissues. The fibrous nervous matter, wherever it is found, consists of fibres which have a definite arrangement. Two kinds of primitive fibre are present in the nervous system, and these we shall distinguish as the tubular fibre, or the nerve-tube, and the gelatinous fibre. The former are infinitely the more numerous; the latter being found chiefly in the sympathetic system. 1. Of the Tubular Fibre.—When a nerve-tube is perfectly recent, and unaffected by reagents, it presents, if viewed by reflected light, a beautiful pearly lustre, and appears to be quite homogeneous. But if viewed by transmitted light, and with a sufficient magnifying power, a more complicated structure becomes visible in all the largest and best marked specimens (fig 52, a, b, and fig. 53, a). Most externally is the tubular membrane (a, d d), an homogeneous, and probably elastic tissue of extreme delicacy, analogous to the sarcolemma of striped muscle (p. 155), and, according to our obser- vation, not presenting any such distinct, longitudinal, or oblique fibres in its composition as have been described by some writers.

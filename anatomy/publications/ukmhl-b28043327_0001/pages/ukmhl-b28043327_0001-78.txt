highly sensitive. Light, sound, and the sapid and odoriferous qualities of bodies,\ are capable of stimulating certain nerves, and exciting appropriate \ sensations in the mind. The nerves which respond to such stimuli, arc called nerves of proper or special sensation; and this name seems appropriate, because these nerves, when otherwise stimulated, excite only their peculiar sensations. If the optic nerve be me- chanically irritated, a (lash of light is produced; as sometimes { occurs if the retina be touched by the needle in the operation for cataract. If the auditory nerves be stimulated by a galvanic shock, a sound is produced. Volta, who tried the experiment on his own person, perceived a hissing and pulsatory sound, which he compared to that of a viscid substance boiling: and Hitter relates, that, upon closing the circle when both his ears were included in it, he was sensible of the sound of Cl treble ; if but one ear was in the circuit, and the positive pole applied to it, the sound was lower than (I; if the negative pole was applied to the ear, the sound was higher.* These peculiarities of the nerves of proper sensation are due to the fact, that at their periphery they are so organized as to be admirably adapted for receiving the impressions of their special stimuli, and at their centres they are connected with those parts of the brain which take cognizance of these special agents. Thus the optic nerve is admirably disposed in the eye for the reception of luminous impressions, and the auditory nerve is beau- tifully adapted to receive the pulsations of sound, whilst each is connected with a different part of the brain; and what are called subjective phenomena of vision or hearing are often the result of local congestions of blood affecting the respective nerves of these] senses, and producing mechanical irritation of them. In the manifestation of the vital properties, under the influence of appropriate stimuli, it cannot be doubted that an organic mole- cular change is produced in nerve as well as in muscle. 1 his may he considered as a polar state, in which the ultimate particles of the to that which friction or other means can produce in various sub- stances, by which they may he rendered mutually attractive or ■ Midler’s Physiology, translated by Buly.

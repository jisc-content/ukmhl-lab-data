It is not unlikely that many of these so called fibres may he bundles of nerve tubes, but it is also highly probable that many of them are bloodvessels, which pass in great numbers into the central substance of the medulla.

Gray fibres. spinal cord, whatever that may be, will no doubt be found to prevail in the medulla; and as several important nerves emerge from this portion of the encephalon, it seems very likely that their fibres should penetrate to its central part to form a connexion with its gray matter. This question, however, is not to be decided by the use of low powers of the microscope, such as Stilling employs; nor have our trials with higher ones as yet led to any

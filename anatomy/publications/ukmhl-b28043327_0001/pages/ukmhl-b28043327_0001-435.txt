STRUCTURE OF TIIE CUTICLE. CHAP. XIV.] -113 as the soles of the feet and the palms of the hands. In the same parts, too, it varies with the amount of pressure to which it is subjected at different times; whence the hard hands of the artizan, compared with those of persons who have spent their time in gentler occupations. This increase in thickness probably results from the mechanical stimulus applied to the capillaries of the part. But, in whatever manner it may admit of explanation, there is scarcely a more striking instance of that inherent power which the body possesses of adapting itself to varied external cir- cumstances, than this one presented by the human cuticle. This investment is not permeated by either vessels or nerves, but consists solely of a congeries of nucleated particles, ar- ranged in numerous superimposed laminar, and united together by an intervening substance in very small quantity. Those particles that lie deej>est, and rest imme- diately on the cutis, are little more than small granules, scattered in a homogeneous matrix, which serves to unite them toge- ther. Those of the next layers are round ed cells, consisting of a transparent mem- brane, in which similar granules, but some- what larger in size, are visible. In the succeeding layers these cells are more and more compressed as they are nearer to the surface ; and on the surface they SZ are so flattened, that their ophite sur- faces are in contact, and adhere, forming niti<xl 40 mere scales, in which the nucleus remains. The diameter of the deep particles is alxmt *CV5 inch, and of the superficial ones inch. We k now- that the superficial scales are being continually shed in small lamelliform masses, and it is evident that their loss is supplied from below ; hence new particles must be constantly pro- duced in the deepest layers, and must be iu uninterrupted advance, Vertical section of the aole: â€” a.

Each pair of papillae thus occupies a little division of the ridge. In the centre of each cross line, between the pairs of papillae, is observed the orifice of a sweat-duct (shortly to he noticed), which often is so large as to destroy the linear charac- ter of the cross groove. In a square inch of the palm we may generally count rather more than forty rows of papillae, and in each row rather more than sixty pairs of them.

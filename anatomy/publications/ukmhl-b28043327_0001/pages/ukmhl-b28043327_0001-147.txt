125 CHAP. V.J REPARATION OF RONE. glottal, as it is gradually absorbed during the succeeding months, while the permanent callus is being slowly deposited between the contiguous surfaces of the compact tissue. It would appear that new bone is formed more exuberantly in the situations of the provi- sional callus because of their greater vascularity ; just as we may suppose the function of ordinary nutrition to be more active in those parts, than in the compact tissue of the bone. The permanent callus has all the characters of true bone. When the reparative process in bone is interfered with, either by nial-apposition of the fragments, or by constitutional fault, a spuri- ous union may occur bv the medium of a ligamentous substance, or even a dinrthrodial joint may be formed at the seat of fracture. The ends of the bones become altered in form, and adapted to one another; a kind of false capsular ligament is developed, and some- times even an imperfect cartilage, and a lining membrane furnishing a lubricating fluid.* * The following works may be consulted on Hone :—The systems of General Anatomy already quoted (p. 87); Meckel, Anat.

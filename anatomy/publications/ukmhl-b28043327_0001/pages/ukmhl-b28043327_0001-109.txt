USES OF FAT. H-CHAP. III.] 87 ■separation of the oxygen would be doubtless attended by a degree of cooling sufficient to neutralize the heat developed in the forma- tion of carbonic acid. Lastly, fat, being a bad conductor of heat, is useful for retaining .at in the bodies of animals. Hence those animals that have little hair on their skins, have the greatest quantity of subcutaneous fat. THiis is remarkably the case in the seal tribe, which has a large quantity of fat between the skin and its muscle, and is almost (devoid of cutaneous covering; and, in man, the subcutaneous fat, which is so generally met with, even in apparently lean subjects, is doubtless a protection against cold. The following works may be consulted on the subjects discussed in this chapter : —The treatises on General Anatomy bv Bichat, Bfclard, Craigic, and Hcnlc ; llildebrandt’s Anatomic, by Weber; Blainville, Ley ora de Physiologic; Liebig’B 'Organic Chemistry ; Hunter’s remarks on Fat, in the Catalogue of the Huntcriau 'Museum, vol. iii. p. 2.

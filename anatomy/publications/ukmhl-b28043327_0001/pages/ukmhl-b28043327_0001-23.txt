THE PHYSIOLOGICAL ANATOMY AN!> PHYSIOLOGY OF MAN. INTRODUCTION. Thf. aim of all natural knowledge is to ascertain the laws, which control and regulate the phenomena of the universe. So nume- rrous, and so diversified are these phenomena, that a division of labour has been found, not merely convenient, but absolutely neces- sary, for the study of them. The position and movements of the ^planetary system, the crust of the earth, and its various com- fponent strata, the treasures hidden in its womb, the abundant vegetation that grows upon its surface, or beneath its waters, and the numberless hosts of animals that dwell upon the land, or in the rivers, lakes, and seas, form separate branches of scientific investi- gation, between which a sufficiently distinct line of demarcation is established by the nature of the objects of inquiry peculiar to each. But, in all departments of science, the same general rules, for conducting the investigation, prevail, and it is only by a close adherence to these, that we can arrive at safe and satis- factory conclusions. In any scientific inquiry, the first step must be, to form a general notion of the characters and properties of the objects ot investigation. In the next place, it is necessary to observe carefully the phenomena which they naturally present; and, if they be within our reach, to produce such variation in them by artificial means (by experiments), as may serve to throw light upon them. If the phenomena, under observation, be complex, we must analyse them, with a view to ascertain the simpler ones, of which they are composed. By this analysis, and by the elimina- tion ot such as are merely collateral, we arrive at a phenomenon, a

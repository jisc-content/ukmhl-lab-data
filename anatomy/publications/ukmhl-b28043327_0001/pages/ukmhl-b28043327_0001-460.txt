The capillary loops indicate the simple papillae; in one of which, A, the injected matter has been extravasated within the basement membrane of the papilla, the outline of which is thus dis- tinguished. c.

They contain nerve-tubes, having a loop-like arrangement. The compound papilla) of the third variety (fig. 94, d, and figs. 99 and 100) are of the average length of of an inch, and, as their name implies, are more or less conical or filiform in shape. They are distinguished moreover by their whitish tint, derived from the

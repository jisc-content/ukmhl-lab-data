341 THE EYEBALL. of this spot is a depression, the fovea centralis ; about 2,tli inch to the inner side of the yellow spot is a slight elevation, the papilla optica, which marks the disc-like entrance of the optic nerve into the retina; here the fibres of the nerve radiate outwards and forwards to the ora serrata, and branches of the arteria centralis retime accompany then. The retina is highly complex in structure, and consists of nerve fibres and cells, of peripheral end-organs, of con- nective tissue, and of blood-vessels, arranged in several layers. Max Schultze, the chief authority on the sub- ject, recognised ten layers, but included among these the layer of hexagonal pigment cells just described as the inner pigmentary layer of the choroid. If this layer be omitted, nine layers may then be recognised, and, following Schultze, be named from before backwards as follows:â€”1. Mem- brana limitans interna; 2. Layer of optic nerve fibres; 3. Layer of ganglion cells ; 4. Internal granulated (molecular) layer; 5. Internal granule layer; 6. External granulated layer; 7. External granule layer; 8. Membrana limitans externa; 9. Bacillary layer (Fig. 101). The nervous elements of the retina will first be con- sidered. The optic nerve fibres (2), where they pierce the sclerotic, as a rule lose the medullary sheath, and radiate outwards from the optic disc to the ora serrata as non-medul- lated fibres immediately behind and parallel to the mem- brana limitans interna. These fibres vary greatly in size, and are frequently varicose. When any of the optic nerve fibres retain the medullary sheath the retina is there ren- dered opaque. Immediately behind the nerve fibres is the layer of ganglionic nerve cells (3). These cells are either bi- polar or multipolar. In the living eye the cell substance

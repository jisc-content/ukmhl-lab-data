Both the pillar and the tube diminish rapidly in diameter from the base to the apex of the cochlea. The tube is im- perfectly divided into two passages by a plate of bone, the osseous spiral lamina, which, springing from the modiolus, winds spirally around it, and projects into the tube. When the membranous cochlea is in its place the division is completed by a membrane, the membranous spiral lamina, or basilar membrane, which bridges across the interval between the free edge of the osseous spiral lamina, and the outer wall of the tube, to the latter of which it is attached by the spiral cochlear ligament. These passages are called scala tympani and scala vestilndi. But .another membrane also, the membrane of Heissner, arises from a denticulated spiral crest, the limbus or crista spiralis, attached to the vestibular border of the fiee edge of the osseous spiral lamina, and extends to the spiral liga- ment at the outer wall of the tube, on the vestibular aspect Fig. 109.â€”Diagram of the membranous Labyrinth.

ANATOMY. 240 index and middle digits, and radial side of the ring digit. The Lumbar plexus, of large size, is situated at the back of the abdominal cavity in the region of the loins, and is formed by the four upper lumbar nerves, which form a series of loop-like interlacements in front of the transverse processes of the lumbar vertebrae (Fig. 77). It gives origin to communicating, muscular, cutaneous, and mixed branches. The Communicating branches join the four upper lumbar ganglia of the sympathetic system. The Muscular branches supply the quadratus lumborum muscle, and give branches to the psoas. The Cutaneous branches are named—a, Ilio-hypogastric, which arises from the 1st lumbar nerve, gives an iliac branch to the skin of the but- tock, and a hypogastric branch to the skin of the abdomen above the pubic symphysis; b, Ilio-inguinal, also from the 1st lumbar nerve, supplies the skin of the groin; this nerve is by some said to send a branch to the in- ternal oblique muscle; c, External Cutaneous, from the 2d and 3d lumbar nerves, supplies the skin on the outer aspect of the thigh. The Mixed branches are as fol- lows :—a, Genito-crural, chiefly from the 2d lumbar, sup- plies the cremaster muscle, and a cutaneous branch to the skin of the groin, b, Anterior Crural, chiefly from the 3d and 4th lumbar nerves, but partly from the 2d, is a large nerve which enters the thigh by passing behind Poupart’s ligament, and supplies muscular branches to the great ex- tensor muscles of the knee-joint, viz., the rectus femoiis, crurseus, vastus internus, and externus, and also the sar- torius,the psoas-iliacus and the pectiueus, which act as flexors of the hip-joint; it also gives off the following cutaneous

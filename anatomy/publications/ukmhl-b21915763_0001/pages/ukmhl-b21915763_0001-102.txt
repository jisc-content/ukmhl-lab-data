The upper limb is jointed to the trunk at the sterno- clavicular articulation. This is a diarthrodial joint: the bones are retained together by investing ligaments; and a meniscus is interposed between the articular surfaces, so that the joint possesses two synovial membranes. A strong costo-clavicular ligament, which checks too great upward movement, connects the clavicle and first rib, and the inner ends of the clavicles are connected by the inter- clcivicular ligament. The two bones of the shoulder girdle articulate with each other at the diarthrodial acromio- clavicular joint, which possesses a capsular ligament; but, in addition, a strong coraco-clavicular ligament, which checks too great displacement of the bones, passes be- tween the clavicle and coracoid. The movements of the upper limb on the trunk take place at the sterno-clavicular joint, and consist in the elevation, depression, and forward and backward movement of the shoulder. The movements at the acromio-clavicular joint occur when the scapula is rotated on the clavicle in the act of elevating the arm above the head. The muscles which cause these move- ments are inserted into the bones of the shoulder girdle; the trapezius into the clavicle, acromion, and spine of the scapula; the rhomboid, levator anguli scapulas, and serratus magnus into the vertebral border of the scapula; the pec- toralis minor into the coracoid process; and the subclavius into the clavicle.

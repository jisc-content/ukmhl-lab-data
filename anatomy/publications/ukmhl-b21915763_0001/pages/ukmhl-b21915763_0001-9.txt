V PREFACE. This Introduction to Human Anatomy was prepared as the Article “ Anatomy ” for the Ninth Edition of the “ Encyclopsedia Britannica,” now in course of publication. It has no pretence to he an exhaustive treatise on the subject, and in writing it, my object has been to give an exposition of the principles on which the human body is constructed, rather than to put before the reader a detailed description of the several organs. At the suggestion of the publishers it has been reproduced in a separate volume. The illustrations, except when otherwise stated in the text, are original. The figures of the dissected parts are chiefly from drawings by my friend Dr W. M. Banks. The drawings of microscopic struc- tures are, with a few exceptions, by J. C.. Ewart, M.B., and by Mr C. Berjeau, for the most part from specimens prepared expressly for me by my assistant, Mr A. B. Stirling. For the use of the woodcuts, in illustration of Dr Thin’s observations, I am indebted to that gentleman, and to the publishers of the Edinburgh Medical Journal.

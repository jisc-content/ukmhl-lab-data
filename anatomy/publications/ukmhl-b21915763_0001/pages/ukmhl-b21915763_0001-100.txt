ANATOMY. 88 the larynx, from the hyoid bone, lower jaw, and internal pterygoid processes of the sphenoid; whilst the superior pair also spring from the pterygo-maxillary ligaments; their fasciculi curve backwards to the middle line of the posterior wall of the pharynx, to be inserted into a tendinous band which extends longitudinally along this wall of the tube to be attached above to the basi-occipital. The action of the muscles of the mouth, palate, and pharynx may now be considered in connection with the process of deglutition or swallowing. When the food is received into the mouth, it is moistened by the secretion of the salivary and other buccal glands, and is broken down by the grinding action of the molar teeth. The buccinator muscles press it from between the gums and the cheeks, and, along with the movements of the tongue, aid in col- lecting it into a bolus on the surface of that organ. Dur- ing the process of mastication the palato-glossi contract so as to close the fauces. When the bolus is sufficiently tritu- rated and moistened, the palato-glossi relax, the tip of the tongue is pressed against the roof of the mouth, and by a heave backward of that organ the bolus is pressed through the posterior orifice of the mouth into the pharynx, where it is grasped by the superior constrictor muscles, and forced downwards by them and the other constrictor muscles into the oesophagus, and thence into the stomach. As both the nose and larynx open into the pharynx, the one imme- diately above, the other immediately below the orifice of the mouth, it is of great importance that none of the food should enter into these chambers, and obstruct the respira- tory passages. To guard against any accident of this kind, two valvular structures are provided,â€”viz., the soft palate

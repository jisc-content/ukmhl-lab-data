ANATOMY. 340 delicate branches pass to the muscular coat of the choroidal arteries. The ciliary nerves then enter the ciliary muscle, and form plexuses with interspersed nerve cells, from which branches pass to the muscular fibres. Other branches of the ciliary nerves enter the iris, and form plexuses, from which branches proceed to the muscular tissue. THE INNER OR NERVOUS TUNIC. The Retina is the delicate nervous coat of the eyeball which lies immediately internal to the choroid, and extends Fig. 101.—Diagrammatic antero-posterior section through the retina to show the several layers which are numbered as in the text. Ct. the radial fibres of the supporting connective tissue. (Modified from. SchuUze.) from the place of entrance of the optic nerve as far forward as the ciliary processes, where it forms a jagged border, the ora serrata. In the living eye it is translucent and colour- less, but shortly after death it becomes grey : it is soft and so easily torn that it is difficult to display it in a dissection without injury. Its inner or anterior surface, concave forwards, is moulded on the vitreous body, and presents the following appearances :—Almost exactly in the antero- posterior axis of the eyeball is a transversely oval yellow spot, about TjJjjth inch in its long diameter, which amongst mammals is found only in man and apes, though, as Knox and Ilulke have shown, it exists in reptiles; in the centre

ANATOMY. 76 erect position, and they are assisted by small inter-spinal muscles, situated between the spines in the cervical and lumbar regions. The spine is bent forward by the psoas and longi colli muscles; and the straight muscles of the abdomen, inserted into the lower true ribs, assist in this movement. The screwing movements of the spine are effected by a series of muscles arranged in layers, the fibres of which pass obliquely from below upwards and inwards, between the laminae and spines of adjacent verte- brae, and are known as the semispinales, multifidi, and rotatores spinae muscles. The head is balanced on the summit of the spine, and is maintained in a quiescent position without any appre- ciable muscular action, but it can be moved in various directions by the muscles inserted into its bones. The nodding movements of the head on the atlas are due to the posterior recti, the two superior obliques, the two splenii, and the two complexus muscles, inserted into the supra-occipital, which draw the head backwards; and the anterior recti, inserted into the basi-occipital, and sterno- cleido-mastoid muscles, inserted into the mastoid pro- cesses, which draw it forwards. When the right splenius, right greater posterior rectus and inferior oblique act along with the left complexus and sterno-mastoid, the head is rotated to the right shoulder; the opposite rotation being due to the action of the corresponding muscles on the other side of the neck. In the formation of the walls of the abdomen proper, bones and joints play but a small part. The lumbar vertebrae behind, the expanded wings of the iliac bones below, and the false ribs above, are the only bones to be

NERVOUS TISSUE. 195 divided into segments from breaks in its continuity, occur- ring at intervals in the fibre. These breaks have been called the nodes of Ranvier. The axial cylinder is, however, pro- longed across the node from one segment to the other, and is surrounded at the node merely by the primitive membrane. The axial cylinder is a pale, grey, cylindriform band, usually about one-third or one-fourth the diameter of the fibre, which possesses more tenacity than the medullary sheath, and not unfrequently, as in Fig. 63, 2, projects for some distance beyond the broken end of a fibre. Max Schultze showed that it is not homogeneous, but exhibits a very delicate longitudinal fibrillation, and at the ends of the nerves these primitivefiibrillce may separate from each other. Although from its great delicacy the axial cylinder can- not be seen in the living fibre of a cerebro-spinal nerve, yet there are many reasons for regarding it as a structure existing in the living nerve, and not the product of a post mortem change. It is the part of a fibre which first appears in the course of developmentâ€”the medullary sheath and primitive membrane being secondary investing structures, superadded as development proceeds. It forms not un- frequently the only constituent of a nerve fibre at its central and peripheral terminations, and is therefore the part of the fibre which is anatomically continuous with the nerve cell, or with the peripheral end-organ. As it is the sole constituent of many nerve fibres at their terminations, and of all nerve fibres in the earlier stage of development, and as it forms the medium of connection between them and the structures in which they terminate, it is obviously of primary importance, both anatomically and physiologi-

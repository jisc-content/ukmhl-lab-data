ANATOMY. 178 motion. It forms a large proportion of the general mass of the body, is the essential constituent of the muscles or flesh, and enters into the formation of the walls of the hol- low viscera. It consists structurally of threads or fibres, some of which "are distinguished by being marked with transverse stripes or striae; others have no such markings. Hence it is customary to divide the fibres of the muscular tissue into transversely striped fibres and non-striped fibres. As a rule, the striped fibres are collected together to form those muscles which are under the influence of the will, so that both the muscles and the fibres of which they are composed are called voluntary. One important exception to this rule is, however, met with, for the muscular fibres of the heart, though transversely striped, are involuntary ; the will exercises no control over the action of the heart. The non-striped fibres, and the muscles into the construc- tion of which they enter, are in no instance, however, sub- ject to the influence of the will; so that, without exception, they may be named involuntary. The Non-striped or Involuntary fibre, sometimes called pale or smooth muscular fibre, enters into the forma- tion of the walls of the hollow viscera—e.g., stomach, intestines, bladder, uterus—of the walls of the air-tubes, gland-ducts, blood and lymph vessels, of the skin, and various mucous membranes. The fibres are usually col- lected into bundles or fasciculi, which are not aggregated together into such compact red masses as in the voluntary muscles, but are of a paler red colour, and are set farther apart, and often cross and interlace with each other in the walls of the tubes and hollow viscera, in which this form of muscle is found. The fasciculi are separated from each

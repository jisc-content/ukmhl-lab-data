342 ANATOMY. is hyaline and the nucleus transparent, but after death the substance both of the body of the cell and the processes assumes a fibnllated appearance, like the axial cylinder of an optic nerve fibre. One process, the central process, extends into the layer of optic nerve fibres; and another, the peripheral, into the internal granulated layer. The internal granulated layer (4) contains the branching pro- cesses of the nerve cells, some of which apparently become continuous with an arrangement of excessively fine fibrils, probably nervous in their nature. These fibrils are inter- mingled with a delicate plexus of connective tissue. The internal granule layer (5) contains numerous fusiform nucleated enlargements, the so-called internal granules, arranged in superimposed strata; from each fusiform enlargement a fibre proceeds in two directions, one centrally into the internal granulated layer, and one peripherally into the external granulated layer. These fibres possess vari- cosities, and resemble the optic nerve fibres. The external granulated layer (6) is very thin, and consists of an ex- panded network of minute fibres, with nuclei situated at the points of intersection of the fibres. Krause has called it the membrana fenestrata. The external granule layer (7) contains numerous fusiform nucleated enlargements, the so-called external granules, arranged in superimposed strata : from each enlargement a fibre proceeds in two directions, one centrally into the external granulated layer, and one peripherally through the membrana limitans externa to the bacillary layer, where it becomes continuous with the anterior end of either a rod or a cone, as the case may be. Hence these fibres of the external granule layer are called by Schultze rod and cone fibres, and the external

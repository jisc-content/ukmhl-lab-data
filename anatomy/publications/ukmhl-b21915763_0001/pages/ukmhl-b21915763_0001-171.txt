159 CARTILAGINOUS TISSUE. Fig. 50.—Vertical sectio through an encmstin cartilage. B, the bon on which the cartilag rests. the cartilage the cells are flattened, placed parallel to the plane of the surface, and so closely packed together that the proportion of matrix is much reduced. In the intermediate parts of the cartilage the cells he irregu- larly in the matrix, and are rounded in form. It was from the study of the changes which take place in articular cartilage in disease that Goodsir was enabled to establish the production of new cells by the multiplication of the normal pre- existing cells of the cartilage,—an observation which formed the start- ing-point of the modern doctrine of cellular pathology. Fibro-cartilages are divided into white and yellow. White fibro-cartilage may form the connecting medium between the articular surfaces of an amphiarthrodial joint, as in the inter- vertebral discs; or it may form plates in the interior of joints, as in the semi-lunar cartilages of the knee and the menisci in other diarthrodial joints; or it may extend around the margin of the socket of a joint, as in the cotyloid ligament of the hip; or it may. invest the surfaces of bones over which tendons have to play, as where the tendons of the peronei muscles play in the groove on the back of the external malleolus. In the intervertebral discs, which give the best illustrations of the structure of white fibro-cartilage, the cells are ovoid Fig. 51. — White fibro - cartilage of an intervertebral disc.

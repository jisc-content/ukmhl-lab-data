326 ANATOMY. in front of the locus perforatus anticus into the three so- called roots of the olfactory nerve. The external or lemsj root passes outwards across the Sylvian fissure to the gyrus hippocampi, and perhaps also to the insula: a few fibres are continuous with the anterior commissure; but in those mammals, in which the olfactory peduncle forms a good- sized lobe, it receives many fibres from the commissure. The middle or grey root contains white fibres which proceed from the corpus striatum. The internal or short root has been traced into the anterior end of the gyrus fornicatus; hence the inner and outer roots of the olfactory pedunele are connected with the anterior and posterior extremities of the arch-shaped gyrus. The olfactory bulbs rest on the upper surface of the cribri- form plate of the ethmoid, one on each side of the crista galli. Each bulb consists both of grey and white matter, and sometimes retains the central cavity lined by a ciliated epithelium. The grey matter contains fusi- form and pyramidal nerve cells imbedded in neuroglia (the stratum gelatinosum of L. Clarke). Between it and the central cavity is the white matter formed of nerve fibres interspersed with “ granules,” similar to those seen in the rust coloured layer of the cerebellum. Between the grey matter and the surface is the stratum glomerulosum of Meynert, which apparently consists of coils of the olfactory nerve fibres with interspersed “ granules. ” The olfactory nerve fibres form the first pair of cranial nerves or nerves of smell; they leave these glomeruli in from 15 to 25 bundles, and enter the roof of the nose through the holes in the cribriform plate; they lie in grooves in the bones of the olfactory region, and form a network from which

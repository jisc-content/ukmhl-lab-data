173 OSSEOUS TISSUE.' nucleus of each, osteo-blast, and of a small portion of its investing protoplasm, preserves within the hard matrix a certain amount of soft material, which being destroyed when a bone is macerated, leaves the lacunary and cana- licular system already described. The for- mation of successive lamellae, which takes place from the peri- phery towards the centre of the medul- lary spaces, necessarily diminishes the size of the spaces, which then form the Haversian canals. The vascular and cellular contents Fig. 57.â€”Section through a fcetal bone to illustrate its development. B, B, the dense osseous tissue, in which the lacunas, with their soft nucleated contents, may be seen. M, M, the medullary tissue in the medullary spaces. OB, OB, layer of osteo-blastic cells of the medulla, next the osseous tissue, some of which in places are obviously becoming included in it. V,V, trans- versely divided blood-vessels, surrounded by meduilacells, situated in medullary spaces, which are assuming the form of Haversian canals. of these canals are therefore the remains of the contents of the medullary spaces of the foetal cartilage, and are continuous with the deeper layer of the periosteum. So long as any cartilage remains in a foetal or young bone the process of replacement of the cartilaginous tissue by the proper osseous tissue goes on, until none of the cartilage is left, except the thin layer of encrusting cartil- age at each articular extremity. Bones grow in length by an ossification in cartilage ; and a provision for their longitudinal increase is furnished up to, and even beyond the age of puberty, by the plate of cartilage which separ-

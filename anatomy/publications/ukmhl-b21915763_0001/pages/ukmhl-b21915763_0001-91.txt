The muscles which cause these move- ments are as follows:—In each of the spaces between the different ribs a pair of intercostal muscles is situated; these elevate and rotate the ribs, and the movements are assisted by the levatores costarum, and, in the case of the upper and lower ribs, by the scaleni and serrati postici muscles; and by these agents the transverse and antero- posterior diameter of the chest is increased.

253 THE BRAINâ€”PONS. fibres of the white matter pass through the substance of the pons, either in a transverse or a longitudinal direction. The transverse fibres go from one hemisphere of the cerebellum to that of the opposite side j some are situated on the anterior surface of the pons, and form its superficial transverse fibres, whilst others pass through its substance and form the deep transverse fibres. The transverse fibres of the pons constitute, therefore, the commissural or connecting arrangement by which the two hemispheres of the cerebellum become anatomically continuous with each other. The longitudinal fibres of the pons ascend or pass vertically upwards from the medulla oblongata, and consist of the fibres of the anterior pyramids, olivary fasciculi, fasciculi teretes, and posterior pyramids. They leave the pons by emerging from its upper surface as fibres of the two crura cerebri. The pons possesses a median raphe continuous with that of the medulla oblongata, and formed like it by a decussation of fibres in the mesial plane. The grey matter of the pons is scattered irregularly through its substance, and appears on its posterior surface, but not on the anterior surface, which is composed exclu- sively of the superficial transverse fibres. It is traversed both by the longitudinal and deep transverse fibres, which form a well-defined formatio reticularis. To a portion of grey matter, containing nerve cells charged with dark pigment, the name of locus cceruleus is applied. The locus lies on the floor of the 4th ventricle, close to the entrance to the aqueduct of Sylvius, and serves as the origin of the sensory root of the 5th, and perhaps of the posterior root of the 4th cranial nerve. The nerve cells of the pons are multi- polar and stellate. The pons acts as a conductor of

THE EAE. 373 pons Varolii. Traced to its origin its roots wind round the restiform body to the floor of the 4th ventricle, where they form the stria; acousticse, and sink into the grey matter of the floor. Some of the fibres arise from an inner, others from an anterior group of nerve cells, whilst others again are connected with the cells in the restiform body, and probably with the flocculus of the cerebellum. Just as the nerve emerges at the lower border of the pons, as may be well seen in preparations by A. B. Stirling, collections of very vascular grey matter containing groups of multipolar nerve cells lie between the bundles of the nerve, and from their processes re-inforcing fibres are added to the nerve. The auditory nerve passes down the internal meatus, and divides into a vestibular and a cochlear division. The vestibular division enters the vestibule, and divides into five branches for the sacculus, utriculus, and three ampulla; of the membranous semicircular canals. Each branch enters a crista acoustica and forms a plexus, in the meshes of which nerve cells are imbedded. From this plexus fine non-medullated fibres arise, which enter the layer of cells on the surface of the crista, where they anastomose and foim a very delicate plexus, from which fibres spring that in all probability join the central processes of the auditory cells (Fig. 108). The cochlear division enters a canal in the axis of the modiolus, and gives off lateral branches, which pass into the canals situated in the osseous spiral lamina. Here they radiate outwards to the membranous spiral lamina, and have connected with them collections of nerve cells forming the spiral ganglion. Beyond the ganglion they form a flat plexiform expansion, from which delicate nerves pass

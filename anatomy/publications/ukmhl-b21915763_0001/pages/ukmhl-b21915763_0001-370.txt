ANATOMY. 358 The Ear. The Ear, or organ of hearing, is a complex acoustic ap- paratus, situated in connection with the temporal hone. It is divided into three parts, named external, middle, and internal ear. EXTERNAL EAR. The External Ear consists of the pinna or auriele and the external auditory meatus. The auricle is the oblong convoluted body situated at the side of the head. Its incurved outer border is named the helix. Within this lies a curved ridge, the anti-helix, in front of which is a deep hollow, the concha, which leads into the external meatus. The concha is bounded in front by a prominence, the tragus, and behind by a smaller prominence, the anti-tragus ; below the anti-tragus is the lobule, which forms the most depending part of the auricle. The framework of the auricle is formed of yellow elastic fibro-cartilage invested by integument, except the lobule, which consists merely of a fold of integument containing fat. Attached to the car- tilage are not only the three auricular muscles referred to on page 83, but also certain smaller muscles called the proper muscles of the pinna. Thus the greater muscle of the helix is placed on its anterior border; the lesser muscle of the helix is situated where it arises out of the concha; the muscle of the tragus lies on the front of that prominence; the muscle of the anti4ragus is placed on the hack of its prominence; the transverse muscle on the posterior or cranial surface of the auricle. The External Meahis leads from the bottom of the concha

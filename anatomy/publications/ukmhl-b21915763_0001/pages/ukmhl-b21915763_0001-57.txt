APPENDICULAR SKELETON—LOWER LIMB. 45 and an intermediate sliaft subdivided into thigh and leg. Each part has its appropriate skeleton : in the haunch, the pel- vic or innomi- nate bone; in the p thigh, the femur: Fig. 10.—Diagrammatic transverse section to represent in the leg the the relations of the Pelvic Girdle to the Trunk. V, a sacral vertebra; D, the ilium; P, the two pubic bones tibia and fibula meeting in front at the symphysis; F, the femur. (the thigh-bone in man being longer than the leg-bones); in front of the knee, the patella; in the foot, the tarsal and metatarsal bones and phalanges. The bone of the haunch forms an arch or Pelvic Girdle, which articulates behind with the side of the sacrum, and arches forward to articu- late with the opposite haunch-bone at the pubic symphysis. It is the direct medium of connection between the axial skeleton and the shaft and foot, which form a free divergent Appendage. The Os Innominatum, or Haunch-bone, is a large irre- gular plate-like bone, which forms the lateral and anterior boundary of the cavity of the pelvis. In early life it con- sists of three bones—ilium, ischium, and pubis—which unite about the twenty-fifth year into a single bone. These bones converge, and join to form a deep fossa or cup, the acetabulum or cotyloid cavity, on the outer surface of the bone, which lodges the head of the thigh-bone at the hip-joint. One-fifth of this cup is formed by the pubes, and about two-fifths each by the ischium and ilium. At the bottom of the acetabulum is a depression, to the sides of which the interarticular ligament of the hip-joint

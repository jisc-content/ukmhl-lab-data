During growth additions are being made to their length and thickness, and additional lamellae are being formed in the walls of the Haversian canals. At the same time a hollowing out of spaces in their interior is going on, so that an increase in weight commensurate with their growth does not take place. The interstitial absorptive changes, whether occurring during growth or after growth is completed, are due, as Kolliker has shown, to the action of the many-nucleated colossal cells, or osteo-klasts, which line the walls of the spaces where absorption is going on. The development, modelling, and rdtimate configuration of a bone are, therefore, as has been well expressed by Kolliker, the product of the formation of osseous tissue by the agency of the osteo-blasts, and of its absorption or destruction by the action of the osteo-klasts. From the fact that osseous tissue may be produced either in the cartilaginous or in the fibrous tissues, and that all three contribute to the formation of the skeleton, it is evident that these tissues are closely allied. To express this alliance they have all been grouped together under the common term connective substances. Muscular Tissue. The Muscular Tissue is that which is actively concerned either in the movement of parts of the body on each other, or in the movement of the entire body from place to place; it is the active agent, therefore, both in motion and loco- M

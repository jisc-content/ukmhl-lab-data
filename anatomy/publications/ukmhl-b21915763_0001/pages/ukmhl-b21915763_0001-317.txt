ENCEPHALIC NERVES. 305 the superior olivary body, and others again decussate across the median raphe of the pons. An accessory por- tion, called portio intermedia, which is said to arise from the lateral columns of the cord, joins the portio dura. The portio dura enters the internal auditory meatus in the petrous-temporal bone along with the auditory nerve; but at the bottom of the meatus it leaves that nerve and enters the aqueduct of Fallopius, along which it is conducted through the bone to emerge at the stylo-mastoid foramen. When in the aqueduct it forms a knee-shaped bend, and expands into a small ganglion, which is joined by the great, small, and external superficial petrosal nerves. Through the external petrosal it communicates with the sympathetic; through the great petrosal, which subse- quently forms a part of the vidian nerve, it communicates with Meckel’s ganglion on the 3d division of the 5th nerve, and through it supplies the levator palati and azygos uvulae; through the small petrosal it communicates with the otic ganglion and with the tympanic plexus of the glosso-pharyngeal nerve. The portio dura gives off—a, a minute branch to the stapedius muscle ; b, the chorda tympani, which, entering the tympanum, passes across that cavity, emerges through the Glaserian fissure, and joins the lingual branch of the fifth nerve, which it accompanies as far as the submaxillary ganglion; it gives a branch to the ganglion, and one to the lingualis muscle. After the portio dura has passed through the stylo-mastoid foramen it gives off—c, the posterior auricular branch to the occi- pital belly of the occipito-frontalis and to the retrahens aurem muscle, and d, the digastric branch to the posterior belly of the digastric and stylo-hyoid muscles; and then U

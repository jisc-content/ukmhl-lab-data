97 JOINTS AND MUSCLES—UPPER LIMB. are inserted into them; the second phalanges by the super- ficial flexor, also inserted by four tendons, one into each phalanx; these muscles descend from the front of the fore- arm into the palm in front of the wrist, where they are Fig 24. Tendons attached to a finger, a, the extensor tendon; f>, deep flexor; c superficial flexor; d, a lumbrical muscle; e, an interosseous muscle; l tendinous expansion from the lumbrical and interosseous muscles joining the extensor tendon. enclosed in a canal by a strong band, the anterior annular ligament, and their surfaces are invested by a synovial membrane, which facilitates their movements to and fro beneath that ligament; as they pass downwards in front of the fingers they are enclosed in a strong fibrous sheath lined by a synovial membrane, and the tendon of the super- ficial flexor is pierced by the deep flexor, so that the latter may reach the third phalanx into which it is inserted. Four rounded muscles, the lumbricales, arise in the palm from the deep flexor tendons, turn round the radial borders of the first phalanges, and are inserted one into the extensor tendon on the dorsum of each finger; these muscles bend the first phalanges on the metacarpal bones, but from their insertion into the extensor tendons they also extend the second and third phalanges on the first; as they are much used in playing stringed instruments, they have been called “ fiddlers' muscles.” The fingers are extended or straightened by muscles inserted into the back of the second and third G

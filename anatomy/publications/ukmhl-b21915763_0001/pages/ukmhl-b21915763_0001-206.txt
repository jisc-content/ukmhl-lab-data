ANATOMY. 194 tures can be distinguished in it: a (Fig. 63), a delicate trans- parent investing membrane,—the so-called tubular or 'primitive membrane, or neuri- lemma ; c, a delicate thread, extending along the axis of the fibre,—the axial cylinder or central band of Remak ; b, a substance which lies be- tween the primitive mem- brane and the axial cylin- der,—the white substance of Schwann, or the medvUary mitive nicnibrancl'i?the medullary sheath.

Between the second line, liot quite parallel fibres is the interfibrous connective tissue. to the first, and the presence of these two lines gives to the fibre a characteristic double-contoured appearance. The investing membrane is a perfectly pellucid, homogeneous structure, with nuclei arranged at intervals in it. It is believed to be absent from the nerve fibres in the brain and spinal cord, as well as at the peripheral terminations of many nerves. The medullary sheath is a fatty and albuminous sub- stance, which refracts the light strongly. Rot unfre quently it collects into little ball-like masses, and some- times causes irregular bulgings on the fibre, and pro- duces a knotted, varicose appearance; at other times it becomes granular, and makes the fibre opaque. By gentle pressure it can be squeezed out of the broken end of a fibre. Ranvier has described the medullary sheath as,

ANATOMY. 84 respiration is from any cause impeded, the nostrils are always widely dilated. One of these elevator muscles, which also sends a slip down to the upper lip, and is con- sequently called the common elevator, is the muscle by the contraction of which a sneer is expressed. A partial closure of the nostril can be effected by small muscles which depress and compress the alse of the nose : in man these muscles are rudimentary as compared with the seal and other aquatic mammals, in which a powerful sphincter muscle closes the nostrils in the act of diving. The lips can be elevated or depressed so as to close or open the mouth; they can be protruded or retracted, or the corners of the mouth can be drawn to one side or the other, by the action of various muscles which are inserted into these movable folds of the integument. The orbicularis oris is a sphincter muscle, the fibres of which lie both in the upper and lower lips; by its contraction the mouth is closed and the lips pressed against the teeth, as when a firm resolution is intended to be expressed. The mouth is opened by the elevator muscles of the upper and the depressors of the lower lip ; it is transversely elon- gated by the zygomatic and risorius muscles, which pass to its corners, and which are brought iuto action in the acts of smiling and laughing. But the muscles of the lips also play an important part in connection with the reception of food into the mouth, and with the act of articulation. The cavity of the mouth forms the commencement of the alimentary canal, and is lined by a soft mucous mem- brane. In it the teeth and tongue are situated, and into it the secretion called saliva is poured. It opens behind into the pharynx. The side walls of the mouth

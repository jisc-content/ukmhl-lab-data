30 ANATOMY. the bone, called aqueduct of Fallopius, which ends ex- ternally, between the styloid and mastoid processes, in the stylo-mastoid foramen. The styloid process is a slender part of the bone which projects downwards from the tympanic plate, and is connected with the small cornu of the hyoid bone by the stylo-hyoid ligament. It does not unite with the rest of the bone until a comparatively late period. Between the petrous-temporal and ex-occipital is the jugular foramen, which transmits out of the skull the eighth cranial nerve and the internal jugular vein. The fourteen bones of the Face are, as a rule, much smaller than those of the Cranium; some have the form of thin scales, others are more irregular in shape. They are named as follows: â€” Two superior maxillary, two palate, two malar, two nasal, two lachrymal, two inferior turbinal, a vomer, and an inferior maxilla. The Superior Maxillae, or bones of the Upper Jaw (Figs. 6 and 7,) form the skeleton of a large part of the face, and enter into the formation of the walls of the cavities of the nose, mouth, and orbit; around them the other bones of the face are grouped. The facial surface of each bone presents in front a large foramen for the transmission of the infra-orbital branch of the fifth cranial nerve, and behind, several small foramina for the trans- mission of nerves to the teeth in the upper jaw. On the same surface is a rough process for articulation with the malar bone. The orbital surface is smooth, forms the floor of the orbit, and possesses a canal in which the infra- orbital nerve lies. The nasal surface forms a part of the outer wall and floor of the nostril, and presents a hole leading into a large hollow in the substance of the bone,

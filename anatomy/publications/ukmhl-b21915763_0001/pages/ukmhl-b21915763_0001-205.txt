193 NERVOUS TISSUE. these fibres, a portion of a eerebro-spinal nerve may be selected. In the first place, it will be seen to be invested by a sheath of connective tissue, the perineurium, which gives off processes that pass into the nerve, and subdivide it into fasciculi or funiculi. Each fasciculus is in its turn composed of nerve fibres, which are separated from each other by bundles of delicate connective tissue, prolonged from the perineurium, in which the nutrient blood- vessels of the nerve ramify. The perineurial connective tissue investing a fasciculus, presents, when treated with nitrate of silver, polygonal markings, which, as Ranvier showed, are the outlines of a layer of flat endothelial- like cells. The size of a nerve is in relation to the number and size of its fasciculi, and the size of a fasciculus is in relation to the number of its fibres. The fibres and the fasciculi lie parallel to each other in the same nerve; but as nerves branch at intervals, the more external of the fasciculi diverge from the main stem to form the branches. In the white matter of the brain and spinal cord the nerve fibres are not arranged in such definite fasciculi as in a distributory nerve, and the con- nective tissue between the fibres is the soft, delicate form called neuroglia. A medullated nerve fibre is an elongated cylinder, which, when examined in the body of a living animal, or im- mediately after removal from the living body, consists apparently of a soft, homogeneous, or glassy-looking sub- stance enclosed within a limiting membrane. When ex- amined some time after death, or after the addition of re- agents, such as water, spirit, ether, collodion, acetic acid, &c., it loses its homogeneous aspect, and the following struc- N

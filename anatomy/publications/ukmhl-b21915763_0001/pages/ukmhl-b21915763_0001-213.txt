NERVOUS TISSUE. 201 and sides of the pyramid. In the grey matter on the surface of the cerebellum the body of the cell is almost globular ; from that aspect of the cell which is directed towards the white matter a slender central process arises 3 from the opposite or peripheral aspect of the cell two strong, antler- like branching processes extend for a considerable distance (Fig. 82). In the human sympathetic gan- glia, again, the stellate form of cell prevails, and the existence of a cap- sule of connective tissue around the individual cells can be recognised (Fig. 67). The processes which arise from a multi- polar nerve cell, as a rule, divide and sub- j.IG.ggâ€”Multipolar cell from the grey matter divide as they pass away from the body of the cell, continuous with a nerve flbl'e' until at last they give rise to branches of extreme tenuity. These branching processes apparently consist exclusively of cell protoplasm, and have been called protoplasm processes. Gerlach has described the proto- plasm processes of the multipolar nerve cells of the brain and spinal cord as forming an excessively minute network, from which minute medullated nerve fibres arise; and F. Boll conceives that a similar arrangement occurs in the cells of the cerebellum. One, at least, of the processes of a multipolar nerve cell does not branch, but becomes directly

ANATOMY. 122 are not spheres, as the old name blood globules would imply, They are non-nucleated. Single corpuscles have a faint fawn-coloured hue, but collectively they give to the blood its characteristic red colour. This colour is due to the presence in the corpuscles of the substance termed hcemoglobin. It has been estimated by Vierordt and Welcker that 5,000,000 red corpuscles are present in every cubic millimetre of healthy human blood. The red corpuscles in the blood of all mammals, except the tribe of camels, are circular bi-concave discs ; but in these exceptional mammals they have an elliptical outline. In all mammals the red corpuscles are non-nucleated, though appearances of nucleation have been seen in exceptional individual cases; for Iiolleston saw a nucleated appearance in a small proportion of the dried red blood corpuscles of a two-toed sloth; and I have observed in a proportion of the red blood discs of a Hoffmann's sloth an appearance of a central nucleus. In all birds, reptiles, and amphibia the red corpuscles are oval or elliptical, and in each corpuscle an oval pr elliptical nucleus is situated. In all fishes they are nu- cleated and also elliptical in form, except in some of the Cyclostomata, which possess circular discs. In the ellip- tical nucleated corpuscles the surfaces are not biconcave, but have central projections, which correspond in position to the nucleus (2, 4, 5, Fig. 28). The red corpuscles vary materially in size in different vertebrata, and these variations have been especially studied by Gulliver. He has found them to vary in mammals from an average diameter of -j^yth of an inch in the elephant, and -j^g-th in Orycteropus capensis, to y^ l^-j-th in Tragulus javani-

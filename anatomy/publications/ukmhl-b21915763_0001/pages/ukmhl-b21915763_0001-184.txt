172 ANATOMY. Fig. 56—Colossal many- the agency of colossal, many-nucleated cells (myeloplaxes), which he named osteo-Jclasts, and believes to be derived from the osteo-blastic cells of the medulla already described, so that a destruction of the calcified cartilage precedes the for- mation of the proper osseous tissue. As the absorption of the cartilage goes on, an irregular series of medullary spaces communicating more or less freely with each other is produced. But along with the destructive changes in the cartilage the production of the new osseous tissue nucleated osteo-kiast, tapes piace. The osteo-blast cells of the occupying a cavity in i matrix? 5/ETj^ medulla are arranged in layers around llker) the walls of the medullary spaces, and undergo an important change both in composition and shape. They become granular, their protoplasm hardens from the periphery towards the nucleated centre of the cell, so as to give origin to the dense matrix substance of a bone lamella; but the nucleus, and the protoplasm immediately investing it, do not harden,—they form the soft contents of the lacunas and canaliculi. A second layer of osteo-blastic medulla cells then passes through a similar metamorphosis, and a second lamella is formed. By a repetition of this process around the walls of the several medullary spaces, the lamellae of the bone are produced. Hence it would appear that the dense solid matrix of the osseous tissue is produced by a special hardening of the protoplasm of the osteo-blastic cells in the medullary spaces, and as layer after layer of these cells is ossified successive lamellae are produced. The persistence, however, of the

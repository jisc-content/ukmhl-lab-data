The anterior pyramid consists partly of fibres of the anterior column of the cord of the same side, partly of decus- sating fibres of the ante- rior commissure, partly of decussating fibres from the posterior co- lumns and posterior cor- Fig. 78.â€”Diagrammatic dissection of the Me- dulla Oblongata and Pons to show the course of the fibres, a, superficial, adeep transverse fibres of the pons; b, b, anterior pyramids ascending at b' through the pons; c, c, olivary bodies; o', olivary fasciculus in the pons; d, d, anterior columns of cord; e, inner part of the right column joining the anterior pyramid; /, the outer part going to the olivary fasciculus; <7, lateral column of cord; h, the part which decussates at k, the decussa- tion of the pyramids; l, the part which joins the restiform body ; in, that which forms the fasciculus teres; n, arciform fibres. 1 and 2, sensory and motor roots of fifth nerve; 3, sixth nerve; 4, portio dura; 5, portio intermedin; 6, portio mollis of seventh nerve; 7, glosso-pharyngeal; 8, pneumo-gastric; 9, spinal accessory of eighth nerve; 10, hypo- glossal nerve. nu of grey matter, but principally of the decus- sating fibres of the lateral column of the opposite side of the cord. The fibres of the anterior pyramid are prolonged through the pons to the cerebrum. Owing to the decussation of the lateral columns of the cord in the formation of the pyramids, the motor nerve fibres from one-half of the brain are trans- mitted to the opposite side of the cord, so that injuries affecting one side of the brain occasion paralysis of the

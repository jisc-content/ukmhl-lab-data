136 ANATOMY. nerves regulate the size of the blood-vessels, and there- fore the amount of blood which circulates through the gland, and also exercise some direct influence on the activity of the cells. The function of the lymph-vessels is not so well understood, but the researches of Ludwig and of some of his pupils have shown their relation to the secreting structure of several glands. The connective tissue and the membrana propria are merely supporting structures for the cells, vessels, and nerves. All secreting glands have the same general type of structure, though they differ from each other, as will be pointed out when the individual glands are described, in the degree of complexity in which their constituent parts are arranged. The simplest form of gland is a short tube, closed at its deep end, whilst the opposite end has a mouth opening on a free surface, as in the glands of the intestine; but in other cases the tube may branch at its deep end, as in the glands of the stomach â€¢ or it may become greatly elon- gated and rolled into a ball, as in the sweat glands; or it may branch, and the branches may form coils and loops, as in the kidney; or the tube may branch, and the branches may dilate into sac-like expansions, or acini, as in the compound racemose group of glands, of which the salivary glands, the mammae, the lachrymal glands, and the pancreas are good examples. Transitional epithelium is the name applied to epithelial cells, situated on some free surfaces, which possess transi- tional forms either between the columnar and tessellated epithelia, or the columnar and spheroidal, and not unfre- quently have a cubical shape. The epithelium of the mucous lining of the bladder is transitional between the

156 ANATOMY. the immature condition of the body than in the adult, for in early life the skeleton is in a great measure formed of it. As development and growth proceed, a considerable pro- portion of the cartilage becomes converted into bone, and is called, therefore, temporary cartilage, whilst the remain- ing portion continues as cartilage throughout life, and is termed permanent. The following varieties of cartilage, based on modifications in structure and appearance, may be recognised:— Cellular cartilage. Cells with matrix substance. ( * \ Matrix homogeneous. Matrix fibrous. (Hyaline cartilage.) (Fibro-cartilage.) / ' White fibro-cartilage. Yellow fibro-cartilage. The Cellular or Parenchymatous Cartilage does not exist in the adult human body. It occurs, however, in the sabs of the lamprey. appears as development advances, but in the lower vertebrates it persists throughout life as a more or less perfect structure. In the lamprey and myxine it forms a continuous rod in the vertebral region. In fish generally, but more especially in the cartilaginous group, it forms a jelly-like mass, occupying the concavities between the bodies of the vertebrae. The cells lie in con- tact with each other. They are comparatively large in Fig. 47.—Cells of the chorda dor- human embryo, in the embryos of all the vertebrata, and in the larval stage of development of the tunicata, as the slender rod named chorda dorsalis or noto- chord. In all the higher verte- brata the chorda dorsalis dis-

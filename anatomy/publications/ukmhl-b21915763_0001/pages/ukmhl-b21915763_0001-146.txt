134 ANATOMY. Usually this epithelium forms only a single layer of cells. The columnar cells which cover the intestinal villi have a clear space at their broad free ends, which is often streaked with fine parallel lines (Fig. 31, C). Intermingled with the cells of the columnar epithelium of the alimentary canal are small goblet-shaped cells. Ciliated epithelium is situated on the free surface of the nasal mucous membrane, which extends into the air-sinuses within the cranial bones, into the nasal duct and lachry- mal sac, into the Eustachian tube and tympanum; on the free surface of the mucous membrane of the windpipe as far as the terminal branches of the bronchial tubes; on the mucous surface of the uterus and Fallopian tubes; on the mucous lining of the commencement of the vas deferens, and on the lining membrane of the ventricles of the brain and central canal of the spinal cord. It generally consists of columnar cells, which have at their free ends extremely slender, soft, pellucid, hair-like processes, or cilia. These cilia are specially differentiated at the free ends of the epithelium cells from which they project. Beale states that the soft bioplasm (protoplasm) of the body of the cell is prolonged along the Fig. 32.—Ciliated epithelium axis of each cfiium, whilst the peri- cells. ’ 1 phery possesses the firmer consistence of formed or differentiated material. During life these processes move rapidly to and fro in the fluid which moistens the surface of the membrane ou which this form of epithelium is situated. In the human body the cilia are not more than from -j^fftli to j-gVoth length; but iu various marine invertebrata they are both

ANATOMY. 232 the poles of the cells. The roots of the spinal nerves vary in direction and length. Those of the cervical nerves are short, and run almost horizontally outwards to their respective intervertebral foramina; those of the dorsal are longer and more oblique; whilst the roots of the lumbar and sacral nerves, owing to the cord ending much above the foramina through which the nerves proceed, are very long, and form a leash of nerves in the lower part of the spinal canal, which leash surrounds the filum term in ale, and, from its general resemblance in arrangement to the hairs of a horseâ€™s tail, has been named cauda equina. The anterior nerve root joins the posterior immediately outside the ganglion, and by their junction a spinal nerve- trunk is formed. This nerve contains a mixture of both motor and sensory fibres, and is compound therefore in function. Almost immediately after its formation the nerve-trunk separates into two divisions, an anterior and a posterior, and each division, like the nerve itself, con- tains both motor and sensory fibres. The Posterior Primary Divisions of the spinal nerve- trunks, smaller than the anterior, are distributed both to the muscles and skin on the back of the axial part of the body. Their general arrangement is as follows: each division, except the first cervical, two lower sacral, and coccygeal, subdivides into an internal and an external branch. The first cervical or sub-occipital nerve extends backwards, lying on the neural arch of the atlas, and sup- plies the posterior recti, the obliqui, and complexus muscles. The two lower sacral and coccygeal unite in a loop-like manner behind the sacrum, and supply the skin. In the back of the neck and the back of the upper part of the chest,

182 ANATOMY. a muscular fibre has a disposition to split up transversely or longitudinally into smaller particles. The transverse subdivision of the fibre is promoted by digesting a piece of muscle for some hours in dilute hydrochloric acid. If the fibres be then examined, gaps or fissures will be seen to extend transversely into the substance of the fibre; and, if the digestion has been sufficiently pro- longed, the fissures have extended com- pletely across the fibre, and have sub- Fig. go.—a nmscu-(Jjyided it into a multitude of plate or lar fibre cleaving 1 discsVeiSely int0 disc-shaped bodies — the muscular-fibre discs. These discs are the strongly and feebly refracting discs already described, and the trans- verse diameter of each disc corresponds to that of the fibre from which it has been derived. The longitudinal marks in the fibre are best seen by digest- ing a piece of muscle in strong spirit of wine, or in a solution of chromic acid. If a fibre so treated be teased out with needles, and the thin covering glass be smartly tapped, the fibre will split up longitudinally into multitudes of minute, elongated threads—the muscular-fibre fib- rillce.

INTERNAL STRUCTURE OF THE CEREBRUM. 293 longitudinally in that convolution, immediately above the corpus callosum, from its anterior to its posterior ends, and connects different parts of its grey matter together. The longitudinal fibres of the corpus callosum, or nerves of Lancisi, also connect the anterior and posterior ends of the callosal convolution. The longitudinal inferior fasci- culus connects the convolutions of the occipital with those of the temporal lobe. Longitudinal septal fibres lie on the inner surface of the septum lucidum, and extend into the gyrus fornicatus. The corpora quadrigemina are connected with the optic thalami by nervous tracts called brachia, and smaller tracts also connect the thalami with the corpora geniculata. The peduncles of the pineal gland connect that body with the fornix, and are probably continued into the optic thalamus. The taenia semicircularis is also at one end apparently con- nected with the optic thalamus, but its posterior termination is not well ascertained. The great cerebral ganglia and the central masses of grey matter are centres of origin for sensori-motor nerves. The convolutions or hemispherical ganglia, again, are the parts of the brain associated with the intellectual processes. The question has often been put, Are not the individual con- volutions distinct organs, each endowed with special pro- perties 1 and various arguments based on physiological, pathological, and anatomical grounds have been advanced in support of this proposition. In connection with the anatomical branch of the argument it may be stated that the convolutions, not only in man, but in all animals with convoluted brains, have a form, relative position, and arrangement which are characteristic of the species; but

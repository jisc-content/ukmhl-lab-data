The area covered by the parietal bone so far then, from being co-terminous with the parietal lobe of the cerebrum, is trench- ed on anteriorly by the frontal, poste- riorly by the occi- pital, and interiorly by the temporo- sphenoidal lobe. The convolutions of the parietal lobe itself are grouped around the parietal eminence, and in the interval between it and the sagittal suture.

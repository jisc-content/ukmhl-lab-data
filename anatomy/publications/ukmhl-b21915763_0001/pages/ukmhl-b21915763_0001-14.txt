ANATOMY. o various points of views: (a) with reference to the succession of forms which it exhibits at various periods from its first appearance as an embryo to the assumption of its adult characters: this is termed Developmental or Embryo- logical Anatomy; (b) with reference either to its form and structure, or to the investigation of the laws by which these are determined, termed Morphological Anatomy ; (c) with reference to the function, use, or purpose per- formed by a part or structure in an animal, termed Teleological or Physiological Anatomy; (d) with re- ference merely to the relative position of different parts or structures, termed Topographical Anatomy; (e) with reference to the structure and general properties of the tissues or textures which enter into the construction of the parts or organs of animals; to this branch of study ha\ e been applied the terms General Anatomy, Anatomy of Textures, Histology and, from the miscroscope being so largely employed in the examination of the textures, Microscopic or Minute Anatomy; (f) with reference to the changes induced by disease in the organs or tissues, termed Morbid or Pathological Anatomy. From its manifold aspects Anatomy forms the basis of the Biological Sciences. As a knowledge of the laws of motion is essen- tial, and must be constantly recurred to at every step before any true progress can be made in the investigation of the physical sciences, so must the structure of animal bodies be constantly appealed to by the zoologist in all attempts at classification; by the physiologist in all in- quiries into the functions performed by the organs and textures in a state of health, and into the special adapta- tion of parts to particular uses; and by the physician in

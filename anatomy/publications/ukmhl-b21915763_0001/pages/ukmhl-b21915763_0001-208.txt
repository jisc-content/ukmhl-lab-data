Lister and I pointed out, in 1859, that essential differences in chemical composition existed between tbe axial cylinder and tbe medullary sheath ; tbe former being unaffected by chromic acid, though the latter is lendered opaque and brown, and concentrically striated under its influence ; while, on the other hand, the axial cylinder is stained red by an ammoniacal solution of carmine with great facility, although the medullary sheath is unaffected by it. We further showed that these differences in the mode of action of chromic acid and carmine might advantageously be employed in the demonstration of the structure of nerve fibres. Ranke has subsequently stated that the axial cylinder possesses an acid, and the medullary sheath an alkaline reaction. The presence of a layer of flat cells between the primitive membrane and the white medullary substance has recent!} been described by Thin. Medullated nerve fibres vary materially in diameter m different parts of the nervous system. In the brain, for instance, they are sometimes as fine as the -nro-o~oth inch; whilst, in the distributory nerves, fibres of TsV^h an inch in diameter may be seen ; though it should be stated that, even in the nerves of distribution, fibres of great minuteness are often placed in the same bundle with those of the largest size. Nerve fibres do not branch in tlieii course, but only at their central or peripheral terminations, and much more frequently at the latter than the former. Non-medullated Nerve Fibres.â€”These fibres, which are

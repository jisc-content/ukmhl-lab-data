74 ANATOMY. Joints and Muscles of the Axial Skeleton. The Intervertebral Joints are complex in construction. The bodies of the true vertebrae are connected together by an amphiarthrodial joint: the fibro-cartilaginous plate or intervertebral disc is tough and fibrous in its peripheral part, but soft and pulpy within. (Fig. 15.) Remains of the chorda dorsalis are said to occur in the soft pulp, and some- times a distinct cavity, lined by a synovial membrane, is found in the centre of the disc, which in the finner whales is expanded into a large central cavity containing many ounces of synovia. A diarthrodial joint connects the supe- rior and inferior articular processes of adjacent vertebrae on each side. Elastic yellow ligaments, the ligamenta subjlava, pass between their laminae. Inter- and supra-spinous liga- ments connect adjacent spinous processes, and in the neck the supra-spinous ligament forms a broad band, the liga- mentum nuchoe. In those mammals which possess big heads or heavy horns, this ligament of the back of the neck forms a powerful elastic band for the support of the head. The joints between the atlas and axis, and the atlas and occiput, are specially modified in connection with the movements of the head on the top of the spine. The intervertebral discs are absent, and the range of movement either from before backward, as in nodding the head, or from side to side, as in looking over the shoulder, are more extensive than between any of the other true vertebrae The head rotates along with the atlas around the odontoid or pivot process of the axis, which is lodged between the anterior part of the atlas and a strong transverse ligament

334 ANATOMY. cornea first seen by Schlemm have been carefully examined by recent observers. They arise from the ciliary nerves, g and enter tbe margin of tbe cornea in from twenty to forty fasciculi, which run from the circumfer- ence to the centre and to the anterior surface of the cornea, and give off nu- merous branches. Thin states that the nerves lie free in the lymph spaces and canals, and that be- tween them and the flat cells fining the canals is Fig. 100.â€”Cornea trented with nitrate of the fluid-filled Space in silver and chloride of gold; 2, anastomosis between two cornea corpuscles; k, stellate WHICH tile migrating COF- cornea corpuscle; g, nerve fibre lying in a lymphatic canaL (From Thin.) pilSCleS Can Wander. Tile nerve fibres soon lose their medullary sheath, and branch; adjacent branches then communicate, and form plexuses which possess nuclei at the points of intersection of the nerves. From these plexuses delicate branches again arise, some of which penetrate between the cells of the anterior epithelium, whilst others end in the proper tissue of the cornea. Kiihne stated that the terminal fibres ended in the cornea corpuscles, but this statement has not been confirmed.

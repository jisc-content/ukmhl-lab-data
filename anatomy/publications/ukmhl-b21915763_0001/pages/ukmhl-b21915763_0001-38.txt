ANATOMY. 26 called internal and external, project downwards, and the internal process ends in a slender hook termed the hamular process. The ali-sphenoid is pierced by foramina called rotundum, ovale, and spinosum, the two former of which transmit the second and third divisions of the fifth cranial nerve, the last the middle meningeal artery to the mem- branes of the brain; between the orbito- and ali-sphenoids is the sphenoidal fissure which transmits the third, fourth, sixth nerves, and first division of the fifth cranial nerve into the orbit; and at the root of the pterygoid processes is the vidian canal, for the transmission of a nerve of the same name. The Ethmoid, or Sieve-like bone (Eig. 7), is situated between the two orbital plates of the frontal, and in front of the body of the sphenoid. It is cuboidal in shape, and is composed of a central portion and two lateral masses, which are connected together by a thin horizontal plate pierced with holes like a sieve, and called cribrifo) in. This cribriform plate forms a part of the floor of the cranial cavity; on it rest the two olfactory bulbs, and the branches of the nerves of smell, called olfactory or first cranial nerves, pass from the bulbs through the holes in this plate into the nose. The central portion of the bone (mes-etliimid) is a mesial perpendicular plate; it forms a part of the nasal sep- tum and the process above the cribriform plate named crista galli. Each lateral mass consists of an external smooth plate, os planum, which assists in forming the inner wall of the orbit; and an internal convoluted part, called superior and middle spongy bones or turbinals, which enter into the formation of the outer wall of the nostril. These turbinals are associated with the distribution of the nerves of smell;

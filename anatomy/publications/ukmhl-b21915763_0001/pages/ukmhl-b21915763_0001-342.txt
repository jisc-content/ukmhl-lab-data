330 ANATOMY. the optic nerve, where the nerve pierces it; and in front from the tendons of the recti and obliqui muscles, which are inserted into it. In the cetacea the sclerotic possesses extra- ordinary thickness. In fish and amphibia it consists largely of cartilage, and in birds a ring of bone is developed around its anterior margin. It is the protecting coat of the eyeball. The Cornea forms the translucent anterior ^th of the outer coat of the eyeball. It is almost circular in form, and is blended at its circumference^'with the anterior border of the sclerotic. Its anterior surface is convex, and covered by the conjunctival epithelium. The forward projection of the cornea is always greater in young than in aged persons. Its posterior surface is concave, and bounds the chamber in which the aqueous humour is contained: if the chamber be punctured, and the humour evacuated, the cornea loses its translucency, tension, and forward con- vexity, and becomes flaccid and opaque. It has considerable thickness, and can be readily split up into laminae. When antero-posterior sections are made through it and the epithelium on its anterior and posterior surfaces, four distinct series of structures may be seen, viz., the anterior epithelium, the proper tissue of the cornea, the posterior elastic lamina, and the posterior epithelium. The anterior epithelium of the cornea, often called the con- junctival epithelium, is stratified. The deepest layer, which lies next the cornea, is formed of elongated cells, placed vertically to the plane of the surface of the cornea. The more superficial layers are squamous cells, often w ith ilutcd surfaces and serrated or spinous edges. The intermediate layers are irregular in shape, and often possess, as Cleland

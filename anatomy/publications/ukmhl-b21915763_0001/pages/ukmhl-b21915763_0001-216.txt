204 ANATOMY. described peculiar bodies, called motorial end-plates, at the extremity of these nerves. These end-plates consist of a clump of richly nucleated protoplasm, somewhat oval or perhaps irregular in form, into which the axial cylinder of the nerve fibre penetrates. The exact position of these end-plates in relation to the muscular fibres is difficult to determine. Krause holds that they lie outside the sarco- lemma, but adherent to it; whilst Kiihne, Margo, and Rouget maintain that the end-plate lies within the sarco- lemma, and that the nerve fibre has to pierce that mem- brane before it can enter the end-plate. After the axial cylinder has entered the end-plate it subdivides into very minute branches. Each muscular fibre has apparently only a single end-plate, and consequently only a single nerve axial cylinder in connection with it. In the non-striped muscles the nerves are distributed in the connective tissue which separates the fasciculi from each other. Here they form plexuses, which, as was shown by Beale, in the coats of the arteries, in the myenteric plexus of Auerbach, in the muscular coat of the intestines, in the muscular coat of the bladder and elsewhere, have collections of nerve cells, forming microscopic ganglia lying in them. From these plexuses fibres arise which subdivide into delicate non-medullated fibres possessing nuclei. These delicate fibres form still finer plexuses, which in their turn give origin to minute fibres, which pass between the muscular fibre cells to form a still more minute intra- muscular network. Frankenhauser maintains that the delicate nerve fibrils which arise from this terminal nctv ork penetrate the muscular fibre cells, enter the nucleus, and terminate in the nucleolus; but Arnold considers that, after

163 OSSEOUS TISSUE. compact tissue. The interior of a bone is much less firm, and is made up of thin delicate plates or bars, or trabecles, which intersect each other at various angles, and form a lattice-like arrangement, technically called the spongy or cancellated tissue. The plates and bars of the spongy tissue are continuous with the inner surface of the compact tissue. In the long bones the interior of the shaft is hol- lowed into a canal, named the medullary canal, the walls of which are formed by the compact tissue, and the can- cellated tissue is found only at the articular ends of these bones; the thickness of the compact tissue in a long bone is always greater at the centre of the shaft than at or near the articular ends. If the outer surface of the compact tissue of a long bone and the wall of the medullary canal be examined with a pocket lens, they will be seen to be riddled by multitudes of minute orifices, which are the mouths of minute tubular passages or canals that traverse the compact tissue. These passages are named Havej'sian canals, and their arrange- ment may be studied by making thin sections through the compact tissue, and submitting these to microscopic examination, when they will be seen to pass longitudinally or very obliquely through its substance, so as to terminate by rounded orifices either on its outer surface, or on the inner surface, which forms the wall of the medullary canal. These canals are connected together at intervals by short transverse or oblique canals. Owing to these communica- tions the dense osseous tissue is permeated by an anasto- mosing network of canals, which, as they contain blood- vessels, may be named vascular canals. These canals are cir- cular in transverse section, and vary in diameter from about

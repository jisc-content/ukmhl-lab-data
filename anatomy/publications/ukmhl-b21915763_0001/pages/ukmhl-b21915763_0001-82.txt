The belly is the fleshy part of the muscle, and possesses a deep-red characteristic colour; it is the active contractile structure, the source of motor power. The two extremities are called the tendons of the muscle, or sinews; the tendons are bluish- white in colour, possess no power of contractility, and are merely, as it were, the ropes by which the belly of the muscle is attached to the bone □ or other structure which is moved by its contraction. The term tendon of origin, applied to one extremity of the muscle, signifies the fixed end of the muscle, that to which it draws during its contraction; as a rule this is the end nearest the trunk, the proximal end. The term tendon of insertion is _p applied to the end which is moved by the contraction; as a rule this is the end most removed from the trunk, the distal end.

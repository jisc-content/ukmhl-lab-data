ANATOMY. 3G0 MIDDLE EAT?.. The Tympanum, or Drum, or Middle Ear, is a chamber irregularly cuboidal in form, situated in the temporal bone between the bottom of the meatus and the internal ear (Fig. 107). The outer wall is formed of the membrani tympani, which inclines obliquely downwards and inwards at the bottom of the external meatus, at an angle of 55° to the axis of the meatus, whilst the membranes in the two ears form with each other an obtuse angle of 130° to 135°. The tym- panic membrane is attached to a groove at the bottom of the meatus, and is concave on its outer, convex on its inner surface. It consists of three layers : an external tegumen- tary, continuous with the skin of the meatus, which con- tains no hairs or glands; an internal mucous, continuous with the mucous lining of the tympanum; and an inter- mediate membrana propria, which consists of unyielding fibres arranged both radially and circularly. The radial fibres radiate from the point of attachment of the handle of the malleus. The membrana propria is usually said to be destitute both of nerves and vessels, but Ivessel states that nerves, blood, and lymph vessels exist in it as well as in the mucous and tegumentary layers Immediately in front of the membrana tympani is the Glaserian fissure. The inner wall separates the tympanum from the labyrinth, and presents the f ollowing appearances: a rounded elevation or jyromontory caused by the first turn of the cochlea, on the surface of which promontory are grooves for the lodgment of the tympanic plexus of nerves • above the promontory is an oval opening closed in by a membrane, the fenestra ovalis, which corresponds with the vestibule ;

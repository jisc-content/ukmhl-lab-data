191 NERVOUS SYSTEM. functional activity of a part is arrested or diminished, are called inhibitory nerves. Of the periphero-central nerves, those which arise in the end-organs in the skin, terminate in a nerve centre, and induce in it the molecular changes which give rise to the sensation of touch, are nerves of common sensation; those which arise in the end-organs in the eye, ear, nose, and tongue, and induce in their appro- priate nerve centres the sensations of sight, sound, smell, and taste, are nerves of special sense; whilst nerves which conduct impulses from peripheral end-organs to a nerve centre, and, instead of inducing in the latter a sensation, have the impulses reflected to other nerves, are reflex nerves. When the impulses are reflected to motor nerves, they are excito-motory; to secretory nerves, excito-secretory; to inhibitory nerves, excito-inhibitory. In some fishes which possess electrical organs, nerves, named electric nerves, conduct impulses to, and set in activity the batteries from which electrical shocks are discharged. The nerve centres, nerves, and peripheral end-organs are arranged in two groups or systemsâ€”a Cerebro-spinal and a Sympathetic. The Cerebro-spinal nervous system con- sists of the brain and spinal cord, the nerves which arise from or terminate in these large centres, the small ganglia connected with these nerves, and the end-organs at their peripheral terminations. The Sympathetic nervous system consists of the sympathetic ganglia, with their nerves and end-organs.

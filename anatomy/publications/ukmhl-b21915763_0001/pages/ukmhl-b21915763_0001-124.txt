ANATOMY. 112 of each tissue and organ—into the special part which each plays in the animal economy—but the consideration of their properties as living structures. It would be out of place in this work to enter into a discussion of the mean- ing of the term Life, or Living, or to attempt an analysis of the various definitions of the term which have been suggested from time to time by different philosophers. It will suffice for our present purpose to adopt the old Aristotelian definition, and to speak of Life as the faculties of self-nourishment, self-growth, and self-decay. All the tissues, over and above the special properties which they possess, have the power of growing, and of maintaining themselves in full structural perfection and functional activity for a given period of time. After a time they begin to exhibit signs of diminished perfection and activity, they degenerate or decay ■ ultimately they die, and the entire organism of which they form the constituent parts is resolved by the putrefactive process into more simple forms of matter. r General Considerations on Cells. The simplest form of organic matter capable of ex- hibiting the phenomena of life is called Cyto-blastema or Protoplasm. It possesses a viscous or jelly-like con- sistency. Under the highest powers of the microscope it seems to be homogeneous, or dimly granulated, like a sheet of ground glass. Not only can it assimilate nutri- ment and increase in size, but it possesses the power of spontaneous movement and contractility. It enters in a very important manner into the structure of the bodies

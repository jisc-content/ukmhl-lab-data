MEMBRANES OF BRAIN AND SPINAL CORD.. 217 the cerebrum from the cerebellum, and, as it forms a tent- like covering for the latter, is named tentorium cerebelli. Along certain lines the cranial dura mater splits into two layers, to form tubular passages for the transmission of venous blood. These passages are named- the venous blood sinuses of the dura mater, and they are lodged in the grooves on the inner surface of the skull referred to in the descrip- tion of the cranial bones. Opening into these sinuses are Fig. 72,â€”Dura mater and cranial sinuses. 1, Falx cerebri; 2, tentorium; 3, 3 superior longitudinal sinus; 4, lateral sinus; 5, internal jugular vein ; 6, occi- pital sinus; 6', torcular Herophili; 7, inferior longitudinal sinus; 8, veins of Galen; 9 and 10, superior and inferior petrosal sinus; 11, cavernous sinus ; 12, circular sinus, which connects the two cavernous sinuses together; 13 ophthal- mic vein, from 15, the eyeball; 14, crista galli of ethmoid bone. numerous veins, which convey from the brain the blood that has been circulating through it; and two of these sinuses, called cavernous, which lie at the sides of the body of the sphenoid bone, receive the ophthalmic veins from the eyeballs situated in the orbital cavities. These blood

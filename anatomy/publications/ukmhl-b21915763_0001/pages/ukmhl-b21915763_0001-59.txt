APPENDICULAR SKELETONâ€”LOWER LIMB. 47 aids in forming the acetabulum, while the upper end forms the iliac crest, which, in man, in conformity with the general expansion of the bone, is elongated into the sinuous crest of the ilium. This crest is of great importance, for it affords attachment to the broad muscles which form the wall of the abdominal cavity. One surface of the ilium is external, and marked by three curved lines which subdivide it into areas for the origin of the muscles of the buttock; another sur- face is anterior, and hollowed out to give origin to the iliacus muscle ; the third, or internal, surface articulates posteriorly with the sacrum, whilst anteriorly it forms a part of the wall of the true pelvis. The external is sepa- rated from the anterior surface by a border which joins the anterior end of the crest, where it forms a process, the anterior superior spine. About the middle of this border is the anterior inferior spine. Between the external and inter- nal surfaces is a border on which are found the posterior superior and inf erior spines ; between the anterior and internal surfaces is the pectineal border, which forms part of the line of separation between the true and false pelvis. The Pubis (Fig. 11) is also a three-sided, prismatic, rod- like bone, the fundamental form of which is obscured by the modification in shape of its inner end. In human anatomy it is customary to regard it as consisting of a body and of two branches, a horizontal and a descending rarrnus. The body and horizontal ramus form the funda- mental prismatic rod, and the descending ramus is merely a special offshoot from the inner end of the rod. The outer end of the rod takes a part in the formation of the acetabulum; the inner end is expanded into the body of the pubis, and has a broad margin, or symphysis, for

Like an Amoeba, also, a white corpuscle can by these movements include within its substance minute particles of solid matter which it may come in Fig. 29.—1, red corpuscles of healthy human hlood; 2, red corpuscles beginning to form rouleaux; 3, mesh-lilce arrangement in healthy blood; 4, mesh-like arrangement in huffy blood, where the meshes are larger than in healthy- blood. contact with in its path.

376 ANATOMY. end unites with the part of the brain from which it derives its roots, and at a later stage its peripheral end extends into the epiblast in which the terminal auditory apparatus arises. The Tongue. The Tongue, situated on the floor of the cavity of the mouth, is the chief organ provided for the excitation of the special sense of taste, but the under surface of the soft palate is said to participate to some extent in this'property. The tongue is also highly endowed with the sense of touch. The structures concerned in the excitation of taste and touch are situated in-the mucous membrane which envelopes the tongue. The tongue is also a muscular organ, and plays an important part in articulation, mastication, and deglutition. Its shape is flattened from above downwards, so that it presents an upper surface or dorsum, and a lower surface. Its posterior part is broad, forms the base or root of the organ, and is attached to the hyoid bone. Its ante- rior extremity or tip is more or less pointed, and its lateral margins or sides are rounded. The muscles connected with the tongue are arranged in pairs, and form three distinct groups, viz., accessory, extrin- sic, and intrinsic muscles. The accessory muscles are the stylo-hyoid, digastric, mylo-hyoid, genio-hyoid, omo-hyoid, sterno-hyoid, and thyro-hyoid, already referred to on page 89, which act upon the hyoid bone, and thus indirectly arc concerned in the movements of the tongue. The extrinsic muscles pass from adjacent parts into the substance of the tongue, and are as follows :â€”The stylo-glossus arises from

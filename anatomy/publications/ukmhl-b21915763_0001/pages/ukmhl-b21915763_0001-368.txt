356 ANATOMY. conveyed away by two slender tubes, the lachrymal canals, which open by minute orifices, the puncta lachrymalia, one at the inner end of the free border of each eye-lid. These tubes open at their opposite ends into a small reservoir, the lachrymal sac, situated in a hollow in the lachrymal bone. From this sac a duct, the nasal or lachrymal duct, proceeds which opens into the inferior meatus of the nose, and here the tears mingle with the mucous secretion of that cavity.

Muscles of the Eyeball.—The sclerotic coat of the eyeball has six muscles inserted into it. Four of the muscles are called recti, and are situated, one superior, one inferior, one external, another internal to the globe. They all arise from the rim of bone which bounds the optic foramen; the

ANATOMY. 320 of tlie spinal nerves establish a connection between them and the cerebro-spinal nervous axis. By recent experi- ments, the tract of transmission of the vaso-motor fibres has been traced along with the anterior roots of the spinal nerves, through the lateral columns of the cord to the medulla oblongata, in which the vaso-motor nerve centre lies a little to one side of the mesial plane, above the calamus scriptorius.1 In the distribution of the sympa- thetic to the glandular viscera, not only is it important to attend to their terminations in the muscular coat of the blood-vessels of the glands, but the termination of the nerves in connection with the secreting cells them- selves must be taken into consideration. The communi- cations between the cerebro-spinal and sympathetic systems, not only through the spinal nerves, but also through the pneumogastric, are to be kept in mind in considering the effects produced by varying mental conditions on the secretions of the glands. i C. Dittmar, by carefully devised experiments performed on rabbits, has localised the vaso-motor centre in the medulla oblongata in a spot about 3 millimetres above the point of the calamus scrip- torius, 1 to 1J mm. ('04 to '06 inch) below the lower margin of the tuberculum laterale. Yulpian, however, from his experiments con- siders that the vaso-motor centre is not limited to the medulla oblon- gata, but that numerous centra are seated in the grey substance of the spinal cord.

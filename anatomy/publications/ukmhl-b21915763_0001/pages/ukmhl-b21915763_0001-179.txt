OSSEOUS TISSUE. 167 invests all the exterior of a bone, except where the encrust- ing cartilage is continuous with its articular end. It is subdivided into two layers: a firm external fibrous layer (Fig. 54, S P), consisting of bundles of connective tissue, which decussate with each other in various directions, and amidst which a network of small blood-vessels is freely distributed prior to their pas- sage into the Haversian canals; a softer internal layer (DP), which is especially well marked Fig. 54._Section through thc peri. in von Tiff ffrowinff bnnpq This! osteum and compact tissue of a in young growing uones. mis y0Ung bone.

Processes of the soft inner layer are prolonged into the Haversian canals, in which, as Goodsir pointed out, a layer of cellular sub- stance lies between the wall of the canal and its contained blood-vessel, so that these canals are not, as in macerated bones, empty passages, but are filled up by the blood- vessels and the cellular layer. the -wide Haversian canals; V, a vessel of the periosteum entering a canaL The Marrow occupies the medullary canal of a long bone and the spaces in the cancellated tissue of bones generally. It occurs in two forms, red and yellow marrow. Red marrow is found in the bones of the foetus generally, and in the cancelli of the plate-like, short, and irregular bones at a more advanced period. It consists

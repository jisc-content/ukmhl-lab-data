246 ANATOMY. To the side of the pyramid, and separated from it by a faint fissure, is the projecting oval-shaped olivary body, with the olivary fasciculus. Behind the olive, and separated from it by a faint groove, is the strong tract named restiform body; as it ascends from the funiculus cuneatus of the cord it diverges from its fellow in the opposite half of the medulla oblongata. By this divergence the central part of the medulla is opened up, and the lower half of the cavity of the 4th ventricle is formed. Internal to the restiform body is the posterior pyramid or funiculus gracilis, which is con- tinuous with the postero-median column, and bounds the postero-median fissure. Where the restiform bodies diverge from each other, there also the posterior pyramids diverge outwards from the sides of the postero-median fissure. At the upper part of the floor of the 4th ventricle a longitudinal tract of nerve fibres, the fasciculus teres, ascends on each side of its median furrow (Fig. 83). Slender tracts of nerve fibres, the ardform fibres, arch across the side of the medulla immediately below the olive, from the anterior column of the cord to the restiform body; and white slender tracts emerge from the median furrow of the 4th ventricle, pass outwards across its floor, and form the stria? medullares or acousticce, the roots of origin of the auditory nerve(Fig. 83). The medulla oblongata, like the spinal cord, with which it is continuous, consists both of grey and white matter. But the exterior of the medulla is not so exclusively formed of white matter as is the outer part of the cord, for the divergence from each other of the restiform bodies and posterior pyramids of opposite sides opens out the central part of the medulla, and allows the grey matter to become superficial on the floor of the 4th ventricle.

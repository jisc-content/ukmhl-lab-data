INTERNAL STRUCTURE OF THE CEREBRUM. 289 The White Matter of the cerebrum consists of tracts or fasciculi of nerve fibres, of whichâ€”a, some connect the cere- brum with the lower divisions of the encephalon; h, others connect the two hemispheres together; c, others connect different structures in the same hemisphere; d, others serve as roots of origin for the more anterior encephalic nerves. a, The tracts of fibres which connect the cerebrum with the lower divisions of the encephalon are called p>eduncular fibres. The largest of these peduncles are the two crura cerebri or cerebral 'peduncles. Continuous below with the longitudinal fibres of the pons they ascend into the optic thalami and corpora striata, and their fibres are named the peduncular fibres. From the corpora striata and optic thalami fibres radiate into the convolutions of the lobes of the hemisphere and form the corona radiata. To some extent the fibres of the corona are directly continuous with those of the cerebral peduncles, but there can be no doubt that a large portion of the peduncular fibres terminate in the grey matter of the ganglia of the base of the cerebrum, and that a still larger number arise from their nerve cells to aid in the formation of the corona radiata. The direct continuity, therefore, of many of the peduncular fibres with those of the corona is broken or interrupted by the inter- position of the ganglia of the base of the cerebrum, which Meynert has named ganglia of interruption. The pedun- cular fibres and those of the corona constitute the cerebral portion of theprojection system of fibres of Meynert, a term devised to express that they conduct upwards to the grey cortex of the hemispheres sensory impulses derived from the external world, the image of which is projected upon the cortex. But it should also not be forgotten that many of the T

SPINAL NEKVES. 233 the external branches of the posterior primary divisions supply the deep muscles of the back; the internal branches pierce the muscles close to the spines of the vertebrae, and end in the skin; the internal branch of the second nerve, called great occipital, and that of the third cervical, pass to the skin over the occipital bone. In the back of the lower part of the chest and of the loins, the internal branches supply the deep muscles of the back, the external branches pass to the skin, those of the upper lumbar nerves extend- ing as far as the skin of the buttock. The Anterior Primary Divisions are not so uniform either in arrangement or distribution as are the pos- terior. They supply the front and sides of the axial part of the neck and trunk, and the extremities. The anterior divisions of the twelve thoracic nerves have the most simple arrange- ment. Each nerve, called from its position an inter- costal nerve, runs out- wards, immediately below the lower border of a rib, and gives origin to three series of branches, named communicating, muscular, and cutaneous. By the Communicating branch each in- tercostal nerve is connected with an adjacent ganglion on the thoracic portion of the sympathetic system. By the Muscular or motor branches these nerves supply Fig. 75.â€”Diagram of the arrangement of a pair of thoracic spinal nerves.

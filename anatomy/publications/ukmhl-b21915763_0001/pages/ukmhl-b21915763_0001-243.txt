SPINAL NERVES. 231 Origin, Arrangement, and Distribution of the Spinae Nerves. The spinal cord gives origin to thirty-one pairs of Spinal nerves, which pass out of the spinal canal through the intervertebral foramina. These nerves are arranged in groups, according to the region of the spine through the foramina in which they proceed. There are eight pairs of cervical nerves; the first or sub-occipital emerges between the occipital bone and the atlas; the eighth between the seventh cervical and first dorsal vertebras. Twelve dorsal or thoracic nerves pass out on each side in relation to the dorsal vertebras: five pairs of lumbar nerves in the region of the loins; five pairs of sacral nerves through the sacral and sacro-coccygeal foramina; and one pair of coccygeal nerves through the lowest openings in the spinal canal. Each spinal nerve-trunk arises by two roots, an anterior and a posterior, from the side of the cord. These roots are distinguished from each other both anatomically and physiologically. The posterior root has a swelling or ganglion on it, whilst no ganglion exists on the anterior root. The posterior root consists of sensory nerve fibres, i.e., of fibres which conduct impulses from the periphery into the nerve centre; whilst the anterior root is composed of motor nerve fibres, i.e., of fibres which conduct im- pulses from the centre to the periphery. The ganglion on the posterior root is situated, as a rule, in the interverte- bral foramen; but the lower sacral nerves have the ganglia on their posterior roots in the spinal canal. These ganglia contain bipolar nerve cells, and the nerve fibres, as they pass through each ganglion, are apparently continuous with

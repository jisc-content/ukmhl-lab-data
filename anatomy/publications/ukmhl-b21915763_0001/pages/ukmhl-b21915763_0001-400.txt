ANATOMY. 388 ' papilla, tlie hair papilla. The wall of the hair follicle is formed of the constituent structures of the skin ; the outer part of the wall belongs to the cutis, and has been described as arranged in three layers, the external, middle, and inner layer of the hair follicle. The external and middle layers are formed of connective tissue, with blood-vessels ; whilst the inner, sometimes called the vitreous layer, is transparent and homogeneous, and continuous with the so-called base- ment membrane of the cutis. The inner part of the wall of the hair follicle, or the root-sheath, belongs to the cuticle, and consists of two layers, the outer and inner root-sheaths. The outer root-sheath is continuous with the rete Malpighii, and consists of cells similar to those of that stratum. The inner root-sheath is continuous with the horny stratum of the cuticle, and consists of elongated scale-like translucent cells in which no nuclei can be seen. A hair possesses a root, a shaft, and a tip; the root is imbedded in the hair follicle, whilst the shaft and tip form the free projecting part of the hair. In the human hair the substance of the hair is composed of a y?6?'o>Â«-looking horny material, which by the action of strong sulphuric acid is resolved into elongated, closely compacted, fusiform cells, which in coloured hairs contain pigment granules. In the thicker hairs the cells in the axis of the hair are polygonal, contain air, and form a central pith or medulla. The hail is invested , by imbricated scale-like cells, which form the hair cuticle. In different animals the size and relative pro- portion of the cells of the cuticle, medulla, and fibrous part of the hair present many modifications. The wool of the sheep has its cuticle scales, with well-defined serrated margins, so that the hair of this animal is well adapted for

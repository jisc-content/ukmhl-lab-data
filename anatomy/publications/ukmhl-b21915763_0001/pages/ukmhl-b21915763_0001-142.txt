130 ANATOMY. the cells are arranged in one or in several layers. But it has recently been suggested by His that the cells lining the inner surface of the wall of the vascular and serous canals and cavities should be termed Endothelium, whilst the cells covering the mucous surfaces should form the Epithelium properly so-called. The cells situated on the free surface of the skin, though usually termed the epidermis or cuticle, may also be referred to the epithelial structures. Speak- ing generally, one may say that by the term Epithelium is meant the cells situated on free surfaces which are exposed either directly or indirectly to the air; whilst by the term Endothelium is meant the cells situated on free surfaces which are not exposed either directly or indirectly to the air. Epithelium. The free surfaces covered by an epithelium are the mem- branes, named, from the character of their secretion, the mucous membranes, and the skin. The Mucous Membranes line internal passages and canals, and are continuous at certain orifices with the skin,—e.g., the mucous membrane of the alimentary canal opens on the surface at the mouth and anus; the mucous membrane of the respiratory passage opens on the surface at the nostrils, and is continuous in the pharynx with the alimentary mucous membrane—it is also prolonged through the Eusta- chian tube into the tympanum, and is continuous through the nasal duct with the conjunctiva; the genito-urinary mucous membrane opens on the surface at the orifice of the urethra and vagina. Mucous membranes also line the ducts of the various glands which open on the surface either of the skin

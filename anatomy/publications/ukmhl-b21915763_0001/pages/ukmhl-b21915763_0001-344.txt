The intercellular matrix of the cornea consists of a laminated substance, the lamellae being arranged parallel to the surfaces of the cornea. The lamellae consist of extremely delicate filaments, collected into bundles, which are invested, according to Thin, by flattened cells, like the cellular investment c of the bundles of a tendon. Im- mediately under the anterior epithelium the fasciculi decus- sate with each other, and at the circum- ference of the cor- nea the fasciculi run into the connective tissue of the sclero- tic.

(From Thin.) doubtful if this layer exists as a constant arrangement. Bowman and other observers have injected tubular spaces in the cornea which are apparently situated between the lamellae. The exact nature of these spaces is somewhat doubtful, but

The smooth free surfaces of the serous membranes are moistened by a limpid fluid, or serum, which facilitates their move- ment on each other, just as the free smooth surfaces of the synovial membranes are lubricated by the viscid synovia which they secrete. The endothelium of the Serous Membranes consists of a layer of irregular squamous cells, the edges of which may be smooth or slightly serrated. The cells are closely adapted to each other by their edges, so as to form a continuous smooth layer, which forms the free surface of the serous membrane. Scattered irre- gularly over this surface are the minute orifices, or stomata, which open into lymphatic vessels. The cells which sur.

The endothelium lining the Lymphatic Vessels consists of a layer of flattened cells, which, instead of having an irregular shape, are elongated and slightly sinuous in out- line. The endothelium of the lymphatics is continuous with that of the serous membranes through the stomata, so that the cavities of the serous membranes are now re- garded as great lymph-sacs. The endothelial lining of the Blood-Vessels corresponds

GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS ON CELLS. 117 book. Now, as protoplasm, whether it occurs along with a nucleus in the form of a cell, or in independent clumps or cytodes, exhibits not merely the property of contrac- tility, but the power of growing and maintaining itself, it is regarded as the functionally active constituent of the cell. And thus our conceptions as to the part of the cell in which its functional activity resides have passed through three phases. In the first, the cell wall; in the second, the nucleus; in the third, the protoplasm cell contents, or cell substance, has been looked upon as the active constituent, not only as regards its nutrition, but the reproduction cf young cells. But though the protoplasm can of itself perform these offices, yet there can be no doubt, as Barry and Goodsir were the first to show, that the nucleus of the cell plays a part not unfrequently in the multiplication of cells by self-division. One of the most characteristic cells is the mammalian ovum. In it a cell wall exists, known as the zona pellucida or vitelline membrane ; within this envelope is the granular yelk or cell contents, in the midst of which is imbedded the nucleus ox germinal vesicle, which in its turn contains the nucleolus Flw,zonf pX or germinal spot. The granules of ydk ? Vfkdieusf “"Ver- ,, n • , . , minal vesicle; IVY, nucleolus, the yelk are a special metamorphosis or germinal spot. of the protoplasm cell substance. Schwann made the important generalisation that the tissues of the animal body are composed of cells, or of materials derived from cells, “ that there is one universal principle of development for the elementary part of

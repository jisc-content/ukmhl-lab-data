ANATOMY. The course of the fibres in the cord and their relations to the nerve cells should now be considered. There can be no doubt that of the longitudinal fibres some ascend from below upwards, and conduct either excito-motory impulses to the regions of the spinal cord itself, or sen- sory impulses to the brain. Other longitudinal fibres again descend from the brain and higher regions of the cord to the lower, and conduct motor and vaso-motor impulses from above downwards. The horizontal and oblique fibres of an anterior or motor nerve root enter the grey matter of the anterior cornu, and seem to have the following arrangement: some become directly continuous with the axial cylindrical processes of the nerve cells; others pass into the anterior commissure; others extend as far as the grey matter of the posterior horn. The nerve cells of the anterior cornu give origin, therefore, directly to nerve fibres by their un- branched processes. Gerlachâ€™s observations show that the branched processes of these cells become continuous with the network of extremely minute fibres already described in the grey matter; from this network medullated fibres appear to arise which leave the grey matter; some enter the lateral column, and ascend as the fibres of this structure; others pass as fibres of the anterior commissure to the opposite side of the cord, and ascend as the anterior column of that side. The anterior and lateral columns, therefore, are constantly receiving accessions of fibres from the enclosed grey matter. The fibres of a posterior or sensory nerve root on entering the cord subdivide into two bundles; one does not enter the grey matter, but applies itself to the posterior column, of

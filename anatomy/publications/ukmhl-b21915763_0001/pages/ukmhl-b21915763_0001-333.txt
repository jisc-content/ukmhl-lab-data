CHAPTER VI. ORGANS OF SENSE. The organs of sense are the organs through the interme- diation of which the mind becomes cognisant of the appear- ance and properties of the various objects in the external world. These organs are severally named nose, eye, ear, tongue, and skin. For the excitation and perception of a sensation three sets of structures are necessary: a, a peripheral end-organ â€¢ b, a sensory nerve; c, a central organ. The peripheral end-organ is the part of the appa- ratus to which the stimulus necessary for the production of the sensation is applied. This stimulus causes nervous impulses to be propagated from the end-organ along the fibres of the sensory nerve to the central organ, in which that nerve terminates at its central extremity. These ner- vous impulses occasion molecular changes in the nerve cells of the bram, and the mind becomes conscious of a sensation. The shape and construction of each organ of sense is adapted to the application of the stimulus required for the produc tion of the particular sensation to which the organ is sub- servient. Each organ of sense possesses its own character- istic form of end-organ. The touch corpuscles of the skin, the end bulbs found in several mucous membranes, and the. Pacinian corpuscles, are the end-organs occurring in their several localities; the peripheral ends of the sen- X

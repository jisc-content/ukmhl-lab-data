CHAPTER I. SKELETON. Osseous System—Osteology—Skeleton.—The word Skeleton (from o-kcAAg), to dry) signifies literally the dry or hard parts of the body. When used in a limited sense it is applied merely to the bones, but when used in a wider and more philosophic sense it comprises not only the bones or osseous skeleton, but the cartilages and fibrous mem- branes which complete the framework of the body. The first evidence of a skeleton in the embryo is the appear- ance of membranes in many parts of which cartilage is developed, and in course of time this cartilage is converted into bone. In some animals, however, as in the cartila- ginous fish, the osseous conversion does not take place, and the skeleton remains permanently cartilaginous; and in the very remarkable fish called Lancelet, or Ainphi- oxus, the skeleton consists almost entirely of fibrous mem- brane. The skeleton serves as a basis of support for the soft parts, as affording surfaces of attachment for muscles and as a protection for many delicate organs. In the verte. brata the osseous skeleton is clothed by the muscles and skin, and is technically called an endo-skeleton. In inverte- brate the skeleton is not unfrequently on the surface of the

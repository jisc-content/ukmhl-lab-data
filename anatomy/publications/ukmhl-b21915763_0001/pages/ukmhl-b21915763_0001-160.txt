148 ANATOMY. tissue, from its elasticity, make up the mass of the liga- menturn nuchse, the ligamenta sub-Hava, and the yellow elastic coat of the arteries. They are also found mingled with the white fibres, in the fibrous membranes, the skin, the mucous and serous membranes, the areolar tissue, in ten- dons, and some ligaments. In the liga- menta sub-flava and nuchas the yellow fibres are arranged in bundles, the in- dividual fibres of which are comparatively broad, with a distinct dark outline. They branch, and their branches readily break across, and the broken end then curls upon itself. Their diameter is about __u_th inch. In the coats of the arteries Fig. 42.â€”Fasciculus the elastic fibres form an anastomosing elasticCtissue^'frorri network. When mingled with the white ligamentum nuchse. , ,. fibres they are much finer, and sometimes do not exceed 5T|T7th inch in diameter. They possess, however, a distinct and definite outline; they branch and occasionally anastomose; and the individual fibres, possess- ing a ring-like, spiral, or twisted course, are wound around the bundles of the white fibres. The white fibres yield gelatine on boiling, but the elastic fibres do not. The white fibres swell up and become so transparent under the action of acetic acid as to be no longer recognisable. The yellow fibres, again, are not affected by that reagent. Quekett pointed out that the elastic fibres of the liga- mentum nuchce of the giraffe were marked by transverse strice, and M. Watson has seen a similar appearance in the elastic pericardiac ligament of the elephant. These transverse stria: are apparently cracks in the fibre; and, as

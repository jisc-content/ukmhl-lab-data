ANATOMY. 292 gemina, and are for the most part prolonged upwards below it into the tegmentum, and into the optic thalamus. b, The fibres which connect together the two hemispheres are called commissural fibres. The largest of these com- missures is the corpus callosum, which, as has already been described, connects corresponding convolutions in the opposite hemispheres. As its fibres lie on a plane superior to those of the corona radiata, the two systems of fibres intersect with each other on their way to the convolutions. The anterior commissure, though often described as con- necting the two corpora striata, yet, as Spurzheim pointed out half a century ago, passes through these bodies to the convolutions around the Sylvian fissure, and gives a root of origin to the olfactory nerve. The posterior' commissure passes into the optic thalami. The course of its fibres has recently been studied by Pawlowsky, who states that they proceed from the pineal body, the frontal and temporal lobes, and probably also from the thalamus, and then cross over to the tegmentum of the opposite crus cerebri. c, The tracts which connect different convolutions in the same hemisphere are named arcuate fibres, or fibrce proprice. The arcuate fibres are situated immediately beneath the inner surface of the cortex of the hemispheres, and connect together the grey matter of adjacent convolutions. In some localities', they are strongly marked, and^ave received special names. The fasciculus undnatus passes across the Sylvian fissure, traverses the claustrum and amygdala, and connects the convolutions of the frontal with those of the temporo- sphenoidal lobe. The fillet of the gyrus fornicatus extends

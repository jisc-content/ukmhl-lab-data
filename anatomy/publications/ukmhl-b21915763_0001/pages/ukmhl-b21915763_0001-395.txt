383 THE SKIN. coveting of tlie skin, and protects the cutis. It is a laminated structure, and consists of numerous layers of cells superimposed on each other. As these cells cover a free surface exposed to the air, they belong to the group of epithelial tissues. The thickness of the cuticle varies in different localities from -^th to ^i^th inch ; where the skin is frequently exposed to pressure, as in the soles of the feet, the cuticle is the thickest and hardest; and the hands of those accustomed to manual labour have a hard and horny cuticle. The increase in thickness in these localities is for the purpose of protecting the highly sensi- tive cutis from injury. The outer surface of the cuticle in many parts of the body, especially the palm of the hand and the fingers, is marked by ridges and furrows ; the ridges indicate the position and arrangement of the papilla: of the cutis, whilst the furrows are due to the sinking of the cuticle into the spaces between the rows of papillae. The mouths of the sweat glands open on the surface of these ridges. The cuticle is divided into two strata. The super- ficialâ€™ horny stratum consists of layers of flat, polygonal scales like a tessellated epithelium; the cells in the superimposed layers firmly adhere to each other by their surfaces, and in vertical sections this stratum presents a fibrous appearance ; but the cells may be readily isolated by digestion in a caustic alkali. The deeper or mucous stratum, or rete Malpighii, lies next the cutis, and closely follows the undulations of its papillary surface. The cells forming the layer next the cutis are columnar in shape, those in the layers immediately succeeding are rounded or cubical, whilst those next in order are polygonal, and not unfrequently possess pointed processes or prickles projecting from them, hence the

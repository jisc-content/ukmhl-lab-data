THE BLOOD. 127 and others into the subject have anew directed attention to them. It is now generally admitted that the migration of these corpuscles from the blood through the wall of the capillaries into the tissues does take place, and that they may then “ wander ” to and fro, owing to the mobility of their contractile protoplasm. These migrated corpuscles are also believed to play an important part in many physiological and pathological processes. But the blood contains, in addition to the red and white corpuscles, still more minute particles, which are, however, inconstant in number. Minute globules have been de- scribed by Beale and Max Schultze, which are probably detached fragments of protoplasm budded off from the white corpuscles; and Zimmermann has described, as elementary corpuscles, minute particles, which are appar- ently derived from broken-up red corpuscles. In the very young embryo the blood corpuscles, like the capillary blood-vessels themselves, are formed by special differentiation of the mesoblast cells of the vascular area, the nuclei of which multiply by fission and form the em- bryonic blood corpuscles, which at first are colourless, but afterwards assume a red colour. In mammals the earliest red blood corpuscles are nucleated and larger than the future red discs, but as development goes on, non-nucleated red corpuscles appear, and as their number increases, both absolutely and relatively with the progress of the foetus, in course of time all the nucleated red corpuscles have dis- appeared, and are replaced by the non-nucleated discs. In adults the red corpuscles are believed to be derived from the white corpuscles, though the exact process of meta- morphosis has not been satisfactorily ascertained. It is

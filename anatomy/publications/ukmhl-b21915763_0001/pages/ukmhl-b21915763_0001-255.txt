243 SPINAL NERVES. the external organs of generation; muscular branches to their muscles; a long dorsal branch to the dorsum penis, which ends in the sensitive surface of the glans, and in- ferior hcemorrhoidal branches to the skin about the anus. b, Small Sciatic, which supplies not only muscular branches to the lower fibres of the glutseus maximus muscle, but cutaneous branches to the skin of the buttock, the back of the thigh, of the popliteal space, and of the leg; it also gives a long pudendal branch to the skin of the perineum. c, Great Sciatic, the largest nerve in the body, leaves the pelvis through the great sciatic foramen, and passes down the back of the thigh, when it divides into external and internal popliteal branches. Before dividing it supplies articular branches to the hip-joint and muscular branches to the three hamstring muscles, and to the adductor magnus. The external popliteal branch gives articular branches to the knee-joint, passes down the outer side of the leg, gives off the communicans peronei branch to the skin of the outer side of the back of the leg, and divides into the musculo- cutaneous and anterior tibial nerves. The musculo-cutaneous nerve supplies muscular branches to the peronei longus and brevis, and cutaneous branches to the dorsum of the foot and the dorsal surfaces of all the toes, except the outer side of the little and the adjacent sides of the great and second toes. The anterior tibial passes to the front of the leg, supplies muscular branches to the tibialis anticus, peroneus tertius, long and short extensor muscles of the toes, and ter- minates as the cutaneous digital nerve for the adjacent sides of the great and second toes. The internal popliteal branch gives articular branches to the knee-joint, and supplies the communicans tibiahs nerve, which joins the communicans

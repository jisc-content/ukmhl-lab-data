ANATOMY. 22 frontal, which forms the forehead, and closes in the front of the cranial box; forming the vault and side walls are the two parietal bones; completing the side walls, and extending for a short distance along the side of the floor, are the two temporal bones; the vertex of the skull is at the junction of the two parietal bones with each other. Fig 7 â€”Section through the skull immediately to the right of the mesial plane. The lettering as in Fig. 6, with, in addition, BO, basi-occipital; EO, ex-occipital; PT, petrous-temporal; BS, basi-sphenoid; PS, pre-sphenoid (the letters are placed in the sphenoidal sinus); OS, orbito-sphenoid; ME, mes-ethmoid; SC, septal cartilage of nose; V, vomer; PI, palate; Pt, pterygoid of sphenoid; /$, frontal sinus; *Pf, pituitary fossa; /m, foramen magnum; a, angle; and s, symphysis of lower jaw. The fourteen bones of the face, which are situated below and in front of the cranium, enter into the formation of the walls of cavities which open on the front of the face; thus they complete, along with the frontal, sphenoid, and ethmoid, the walls of the two orbits in which the eye-balls are lodged; along with the ethmoid and sphenoid, the walls of

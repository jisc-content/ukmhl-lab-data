SPINAL NERVES. 239 Musculo-Cutaneous branch of the outer cord of the plexus supplies the biceps, brachialis anticus, and coraco-brachialis muscles, and ends in an external cutaneous branch, which supplies the skin of the outer side of the forearm, both in front and behind, d, The Ulnar nerve arises from the inner cord, passes through the upper arm, and enters the forearm between the inner condyle and olecranon, where it supplies an articular branch to the elbow joint. Here it may easily be compressed, when a pricking sensation is experienced in the course of its distribution. In this spot it is popularly called the “ funny bone.” In the forearm the ulnar nerve supplies the flexor carpi ulnaris and inner part of the flexor profundus digitorum muscles. In the hand it supplies the palmaris brevis, the muscles of the ball of the little finger, the two inner lumbricales, the inter- ossei muscles, and the adductor and deep part of the short flexor of the thumb. It also supplies a dorsal cutaneous branch to the back of _the hand, and the back of the little and of the ulnar side of the ring digits. Palmar cutaneous branches are also given to the palm and to the palmar aspects of the same digits, e, The Median nerve arises by two roots, ■ one fr°m the inner, the other from the outer cord of the plexus. It enters the forearm in front of the elbow joint, between the two heads of the pronator radii teres, sup- plies, either directly or through its anterior interosseous branch, all the flexors and pronators, except those supplied by the ulnar; is continued to the hand, where it supplies the abductor, opponens, and superficial part of the short flexor of the thumb, and the two outer iumbrical muscles. It also supplies a palmar cutaneous branch to the skin of the palm, and gives digital cutaneous branches to the thumb,

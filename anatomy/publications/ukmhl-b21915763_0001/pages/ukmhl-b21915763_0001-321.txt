309 ENCEPHALIC NERVES. by the foramen rotundum, passes across the spheno-maxillary fissure, then lies in the canal in the floor of the orbit, from which it emerges on the face through the infra-orbital foramen as the infra-orbital nerve. It gives off—a, a small orbital branch which divides into a temporal branch for a small part of the skin of the temple, and a malar branch for the skin over the cheek bone; b, dental branches to the teeth in the upper jaw; c, palpebral branches to the skin and conjunctiva of the lower eye-lid; d, nasal branches to the skin and mucous membrane of the nose; e, labial branches to the skin and mucous membrane of the upper lip. It also gives off, when in the spheno-maxillary fossa—/, spheno- palatine branches, which form the sensory root of the spheno-palatine or Meckel's ganglion. This ganglion receives a motor root through the great petrosal nerve from the knee-shaped bend of the portio dura, and a sympathetic root from the carotid plexus, which runs along with the great petrosal, and forms with it the vidian nerve. The ganglion gives origin to—a, an orbital branch, which supplies a layer of non-striped muscular fibres, described by H. Muller and myself as developed in connection with the periosteum of the orbit, where it covers the spheno-maxillary fissure ; b, upper nasal and naso-palatine branches to the mucous membrane of the nose and hard palate; c, descend- ing palatine branches to the mucous membrane of the hard and soft palate, and to the levator palati and azygos uvulas; d, pterygo-palatine to the mucous membrane of the upper part of the pharnyx. The 3d or Inferior Maxillary division passes out of the skull through the foramen ovale, and as it does so is joined by the motor root of the 5th. By the junction a mixed

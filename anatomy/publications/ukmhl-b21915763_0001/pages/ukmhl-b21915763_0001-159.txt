147 CONNECTIVE TISSUE. thelial-like cells are obviously a special differentiation of the formative cells of tlie connective tissue at the surface of the bundles. The wide diffusion of the connective tissue throughout the body, and the great importance of its cellular elements, have been especially dwelt on by Virchow as sources of origin of the new cell forms which arise in various patho- logical processes. The intercellular substance or matrix consists of fibres, which are not uniform in shape, and are divided into the two groups of white and yellow fibres. The white fibres of connective tissue constitute the most common form, and make up the great bulk of most ligaments, tendons, and fibrous membranes. They consist of excessively delicate filaments, varying from ^^th to ^ooth inch in thickness, which are united together in bundles or fasciculi of variable size. The bundles, as well as the filaments of which they are composed, have a wavy course, and the filaments in each bundle he almost parallel to each other. The bundles also in some cases are parallel, though in others they cross at various angles. Not only the FVwMteâ€œ'fibres filaments in each bundle, but the bundles tLue?0Dnectlve themselves, are cemented together; the firmness of the adhesion varies in the different modifications of the fibrous connective tissue, being much more decided in the tendons, ligaments, and fasciae, than in the lax areolar tissue. ., The yellow fibres of connective tissue, named elastic

ANATOMY. 352 screw of the camera; through its attachment to the ciliary processes and their relation to the suspensory ligament of the lens, it is able to act upon the lens and modify the curvature of its anterior surface j for when the eye is to be accommodated to the vision of near objects the anterior surface of the lens becomes more convex than when distant objects are being examined. It has already been stated on p. 213 that the retina is the expanded distal part of the primary optic vesicle, which grows forwards towards the superficial epiblast covering of the embryo head. By the thickening and involution of the epiblast superficial to the vesicle a hollow is produced in the front of the vesicle, which gradually deepening forms a cup or pocket, the secondary optic vesicle, in which the involuted part of the epiblast is lodged. This pocket has double walls, an anterior and a posterior, the former of which becomes the retina, the latter the layer of hexagonal choroidal pigment. The cavity between these walls, origin- ally continuous through the canal in the optic nerve â€¢with the cavity in the hemisphere, becomes obliterated, so that the retina and choroidal pigment come into contact with each other. The part of the epiblast lodged in the pocket severs its connection with the superficial epiblast, and forms the crystalline lens. It becomes closed in in front by a growth superficial to it, both of mesoblast and epiblast; the mesoblast layer forms the cornea, whilst the superficial epiblast layer forms the anterior epithelium of the cornea, or conjunctival epithelium. Through a want of uniformity in the growth of the wall of the secondary optic vesicle, a fissure, called the choroidal fissure, exists on its under surface, through which the mesoblast passes

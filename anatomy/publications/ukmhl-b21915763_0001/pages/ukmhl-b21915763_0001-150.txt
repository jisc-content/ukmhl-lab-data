138 ANATOMY. nection with the outer surface of the body, yet they are originally continuous with the layer of epiblast, and only become discontinuous with it when from the great develop- ment of the adjacent part of the mesoblast, required for the formation of the bony walls which enclose the laby- rinth and cerebro-spinal nervous axis, the original connec- tion is severed. Endothelium. The free surfaces covered by an endothelium are the serous membranes, the inner surface of the walls of the lymph and blood vessels and of the heart, the synovial membranes of joints, of synovial sheaths and bursae. The tubes, canals, and cavities lined by an endothelium are shut off from all communication with the external atmo- sphere. The cells of the endothelium are arranged so as to give perfect smoothness to the surface which they cover. In the blood and lymph vessels this smoothness of surfacq is in order to facilitate the flow of the blood and lymph in the course of the circulation. The serous and synovial membranes are found covering the surfaces of parts which move on each other, and the smoothness of their respective surfaces, by permitting freedom of movement, diminishes the friction. Endothelial cells form only a single layer, and are, as a rule, flattened scale-like cells, arranged after the manner of a tessellated epithelium. Endothelium, like epithelium, is non-vascular, and, so far as is known, non-nervous. The endothelial cells rest upon a sub-endothelial tissue, consisting of the fibrous variety of connective tissue.

ANATOMY. 308 fibres of the pons ; c, by ascending fibres which apparently arise from the grey tubercle of Rolando; d, probably by fibres which traverse and embrace the superior peduncle of the cerebellum. As the large sensory root of the fifth lies on the petrous bone it expands into the Gasserian ganglion, which resembles in structure the ganglion on the posterior root of a spinal nerve. From this ganglion three large branches arise, named respectively the 1st, 2d, and 3d divisions of the ganglion (Fig. 95). The lsi or Ophthalmic division is the upper sensory nerve of the face, it lies in the outer wall of the cavernous sinus and divides into three branches, which pass out of the cra- nial cavity through the sphenoidal fissure, a, Its lachrymal branch supplies the lachrymal gland, and the outer part of the skin and conjunctiva of the upper eyelid, b, Its frontal branch divides into the supra-trochlear and supra-orbital; the supra-trochlear supplies the inner part of the skin and conjunctiva of the upper eyelid and eyebrow; the supra- orbital supplies the skin of the forehead and scalp as far back as the vertex, c, Its oculo-nasal branch gives long ciliary nerves to the eyeball, a nasal nerve to the mucous mem- brane of the nose, and to the skin of the side of the nose, and an infra-trochlear nerve to the conjunctiva and inte- gument of the eyelids. From the oculo-nasal nerve arises the long or sensory root of the small ciliary ganglion., which lies in the cavity of the orbit, and which receives also a motor root from the third nerve, and a root from the sympathetic. This ganglion gives origin to the short ciliary nerves for the eyeball. The 2d or Superior Maxillary division is the sensory nerve for the middle part of the face. It leaves the skull

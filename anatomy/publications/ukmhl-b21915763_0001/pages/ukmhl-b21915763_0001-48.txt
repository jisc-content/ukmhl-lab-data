36' • ANATOMY. ridges corresponding to them, have not formed. In the adult the face is about half the size of the head, and its vertical diameter is greatly elongated, from the growth of the antrum, the nose, and the dental borders of the jaws; and the angle of the lower jaw is almost a right angle. In old age the teeth fall out, the jaws shrink in, their dental borders become absorbed, the angle of the lower jaw, as in infancy, is obtuse; the vertex and floor of the skull also become flattened, and the sides bulge outwards,—changes due to gravitation and the subsidence of the bones by their own weight. The skull of a woman is smaller and lighter, with the muscular ridges and projections due to the air-sinuses less strongly marked than in a man, but with the eminences or centres of ossification more prominent. The more feeble air-sinuses imply a more restricted respiratory activity and a less active mode of life than in a man. The internal capacity is about 10 per cent, less than that of the male. The face is smaller in proportion to the cranium;- the cranium is more flattened at the vertex, and the height is consequently not so great in proportion to the length as in the man. In the adult female skull, therefore, the infantile characters are less departed from than is the case hi the male. Appendicular Skeleton. UPPER LIMB. Turning now to the Appendicular Skeleton, we shall consider first that of the Superior or Thoracic, or Pectoral Extremity, or Upper Iamb. The Upper Limb may be subdivided into a proximal part or shoulder, a

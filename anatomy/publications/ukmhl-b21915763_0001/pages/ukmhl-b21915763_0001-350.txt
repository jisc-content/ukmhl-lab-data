ANATOMY. 338 liave on their inner surface a black pigmentary layer of cells continuous with that of the choroid. The vitreous layer is also present, but according to H. Muller is no longer smooth but reticulated. The stroma does not con- tain so large a proportion of stellate pigment cells as in the choroid. The arteries have been carefully studied by Leber; they are the long posterior ciliary branches of the ophthalmic, and the anterior ciliary branches of the muscu- lar branches of the ophthalmic. They pierce the sclerotic, run forwards, and at the anterior border of the ciliary muscle form by their anastomoses the circuhis arteriosus, which gives origin to the arteries for the ciliary processes and the iris. The arteries for the ciliary processes are short, and divide into tortuous branches, which frequently anastomose, and form highly complex vascular plexuses, from which arise veins that join the venae vorticosae. Before the long ciliary arteries contribute to the formation of the arterial circle they send branches to the ciliary muscle, and recurrent branches to the anterior part of the proper choroid coat. The iris has its anterior surface covered by a layer of cells continuous with the epithelium of the aqueous humour. This layer is continuous at the pupillary border with a thick layer of cells filled with black pigment granules, the uvea, which covers the posterior surface of the iris, and at its ciliary border is continuous with the pigmentary layer of the ciliary processes. The connective tissue stroma ot the iris also contains stellate pigment cells. The variations in colour of the iris in different eyes depend upon the dis- tribution and amount of the pigment in the uvea and the stellate cells: in dark-coloured eyes, both are filled with

145 CONNECTIVE TISSUE. Under some pathological conditions, this form of tissue increases largely in quantity in some parts of the body, and forms a kind of tumour named Myxoma. d. Fibrous connective tissue presents four modifications in appearance. It may be soft and delicate, with the fibres short and but faintly marked, as in the sub-epithelial tissue of the sldn and mucous membranes. It may be loose, flocculent, and filamentous, and may contain small spaces or areolae (when it is called areolar tissue), as is well seen in the subcutaneous tissue of the adult, and in the omenta. It may be expanded in the form of a fibrous membrane, as in the fasciae or aponeuroses, and the threads or fibres, strong and well marked, sometimes run parallel, sometimes cross each other at various angles. It may be collected into rounded or flattened bands, as in tendons and ligaments, where it forms the tendinous and ligamentous tissues. Here also the threads or fibres may be distinctly recognised and seen to run in parallel bundles, so as to connect together the two structures between which the tendon or ligament passes. In the fibrous form of connective tissue, both cells and intercellular substance, the latter of which is differentiated into fibres, may be recognised. The cells are, as a rule, either elongated, or fusiform, or caudate, or stellate branched cells, and are familiarly known as the connective tissue corpuscles. In these cells the nucleus is round or oval, and usually well marked. It is surrounded by granular proto- plasm, but it is very doubtful if the protoplasm is invested by a cell wall. 1STot unfrequently, more especially where the cells are stellate, the delicate branched protoplasm processes of adjacent cells appear to blend at their extremities with K

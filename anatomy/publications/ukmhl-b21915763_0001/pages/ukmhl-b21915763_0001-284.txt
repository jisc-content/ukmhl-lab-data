ANATOMY. 272 great transverse fissure of the cerebrum. The hippocampal fissure is continuous round the posterior end of the corpus callosum with the callosal fissure, and at the bottom of the hippocampal fissure the grey matter of the gyrus hippo- campi terminates in a well-defined dentated border (fascia dentata). The hippocampal fissure on this surface of the hemisphere marks the position of an eminence in the de- scending cornu of the ventricle called hippocampus rmajor. The gyrus hippocampi is separated posteriorly from the Fig. 88.â€”Convolutions of tlie inner and tentorial surfaces of the left hemi- sphere. i, i, i, calloso-marginal fissure; l, l, calcarine fissure; m, m, hippo- campal fissure; ft, ft, collateral fissure; PO, parieto-occipital fissure; 17,17, marginal convolution; 18, 18, gyrus fomicatus; 18', quadrilateral lobule; 19, hippocampal gyrus; 19', its recurved end; 25, occipital lobule; 9, 9, infe- rior temporo-sphenoidal convolution. adjacent temporo-sphenoidal convolution by a fissure, named collateral, which marks the position on this surface of the hemisphere of the collateral eminence in the interior of the ventricle. From the lower end of the parieto-occipital fissure an offshoot, called the calcarine fissure, passes almost horizontally backwards in the occipital lobe, which fissure marks on this surface of the hemisphere the eminence named calcar avis, or hippocampus minor, in the posterior cornu of the ventricle.

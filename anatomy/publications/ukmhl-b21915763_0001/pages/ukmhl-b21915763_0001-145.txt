133 EPITHELIUM. vestment of tlie skin. Its cells are nucleated, flattened scales, varying in diameter from g^-pth to -rg10-5-tli inch. Those in the same layer, being in contact by their edges, form a tessellated, pavement-like arrangement, whilst the cells in adjacent layers have their flattened surfaces in con- tact with each other. Sometimes the cells have jagged, prickle-like edges, or fluted surfaces, and usually they con- tain scattered granular particles. In the formation of this epithelium a morphological differentiation of the protoplasm of the rounded cells of the deeper strata into flattened scales, and at the same time a chemical differentiation of their soft contents into a horny material, have occurred. Columnar or cylindrical epithelium is situated on the free surface of the mucous lining of the alimentary canal from the oesophageal orifice of the stomach to the anus ; it is prolonged into the ducts of variorrs glands which open on the alimentary mucous membrane; it covers the mucous linina: of the urethra and the mucous membrane of the O gall bladder. Its cells are elongated, cylindrical columns, about -g-g-g-th inch long, placed side by side like a row of palisades, and with their long axes perpendicular to the surface on which the cells rest.

The nuclei are distinct, and the cell contents are finely granular.

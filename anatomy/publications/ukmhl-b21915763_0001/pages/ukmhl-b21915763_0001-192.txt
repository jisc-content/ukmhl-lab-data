180 ANATOMY. The Transversely Striped fibre is the characteristic tissue of the voluntary muscular system, and is found wherever energetic movements are to be performed. In these muscles the fibres are collected together in fasciculi, which bundles usually lie parallel to each other, and extend from the tendon of origin to the tendon of insertion. Each muscle is invested by a membranous sheath formed of connective tissue, the perimysium externum, which sheath gives off processes that dip into the substance of the muscle, so as to form delicate partitions between the fasciculi, aud from these partitions still more slender prolongations of connec- tive tissue, named perimysium internum, pass between the fibres. The bundles of the perimysium are described by Thin as invested by a layer of flat cells. The number and size of the fasciculi vary with the size and texture of the muscle; in some, as the deltoid and gluteus maximus, the fasciculi are large and coarse ] whilst in others, as the gracilis and omo-hyoid, they are much finer. The number of fibres in a fasciculus varies with its length and thickness, and the fibres which are adjacent to each other in a fasciculus lie parallel. The striped fibres are cylindrical or laterally com- pressed] they usually taper off at their extremities, and apparently do not, even in muscles with long fasciculi, exceed 1Â£ inch in length. The transverse diameter of the striped fibres varies, in different localities in the human body, from jfoth to ^^th inch, according to the measure- ments of Kolliker. Much wider differences in diameter are found in the animal series, in insects the fibres being of extreme minuteness, whilst in cold-blooded animals they are much larger than in man and mammals.

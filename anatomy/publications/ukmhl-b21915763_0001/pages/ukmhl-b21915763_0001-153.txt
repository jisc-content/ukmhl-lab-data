141 ENDOTHELIUM. in general characters with that of the lymphatics. In the small bloocl capillaries the cells are fusiform â€¢ in those of larger size, more irregular : in the veins they are broader, more irregular, and less distinctly fusiform than in the arteries. The endothelial covering of the endocardial lining of the heart consists of a layer of flattened cells with irregular outlines. The endothelial lining of the blood-vascular system is continuous with that of the lymph-vascular system, where the thoracic duct and other large lymph-vessels open into the great veins, and thus a continuity of surface is established between the serous membranes and the lining membrane of the blood-vascular system through the lymphatics. The endothelium of the Synovial Membranes forms a layer of polygonal, tessellated cells, on the inner surface of the vascular connective tissue of the synovial capsules. The existence of a continuous layer of such cells, though denied by Hiiter and Reyher, has been established by Till- manns. Villous processes of the sub-endothelial vascular connective tissue called synovial fringes, covered by endo- thelium, project into the cavities of joints and synovial bursas, and contribute to the formation of the synovia which lubricates the surfaces of a synovial membrane. Endothelium is developed exclusively from the cells of the mesoblast, from which cells also, by histological dif- ferentiation, are formed the organs to which the endothelium serves as a lining. Between the endothelium and the con- nective tissue a close genetic co-relationship obviously exists, and the flattened endothelial cells are apparently specially differentiated on the surface of the bundles of connective tissue.

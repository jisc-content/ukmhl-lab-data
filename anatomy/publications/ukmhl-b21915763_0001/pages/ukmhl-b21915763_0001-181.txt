OSSEOUS TISSUE. 169 cancellated tissue they are large, and leave the interior of the bone partly through foramina situated near the articular ends, and partly by a vein which accompanies the artery that traverses the nutrient canal. In the plate-like bones of the skull the veins lie in distinct channels in the diploe, and in the bodies of the vertebrae the veins pass out through large holes in the posterior surface. Bones possess lymph- vessels, but their exact mode of arrangement has not yet been ascertained. Fine nerves accompanying the arteries which enter the nutrient and Haversian canals have been traced into bones, and nerves end also in the periosteum. It is clear, therefore, that a bone, hard and dense though its texture seems to be, is yet hollowed out by spaces, passages, and canals which, under the several names of medullary canal, cancellated spaces, nutrient canal, Haversian canals, Haversian spaces, lacunse, and canaliculi, are occupied by blood-vessels or other soft tis- sues. By the penetration of blood-vessels into the bone, blood is conveyed not only to the medulla, but into the very substance even of the compact tissue; and there cab be no doubt that the nucleated masses of protoplasm which occupy the lacunae and canaliculi, and line the Haversian canals, are, as Goodsir long ago pointed out, centres con- cerned in the nutrition of the matrix substance of the bone in their immediate neighbourhood. These cells, together with the periosteum, the medulla, and their blood- vessels, are active agents in the development, growth, and nutrition of the osseous tissue. In the description of the development of the skeleton, it is stated that the bones are formed by ossification in cartilage and fibrous membrane, so that bones are pro-

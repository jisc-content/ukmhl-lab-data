GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS ON CELLS. 113 of tlie lower animals. The elongated processes, or pseudo- podia, to which Dujardin applied the name of sarcode, which the Rhizopoda can project from their surface into the surrounding medium, and again with- draw into their substance, consist of protoplasm, and may be cited as fur- nishing excellent examples of its motive and contractile power. From the recent researches of Haeckel it would appear that protoplasm is capable of forming, without the super- addition of any other structure, inde- pendent organisms, which stand at pldsm' the lowest grade of organisation, and from their extreme simplicity are named by him Monera (Fig. 25). To the group Monera belong the genera Protamceba, Protogenes, and Bathybius. Of these, Bathybius is that which has attracted most attention. It has been regarded as a layer of soft slimy undifferentiated protoplasm covering the bottom of the deep sea, and capable of exhibiting the phenomena of contractility, growth, assimilation of food, and reproduction. Doubts, however, have been expressed regarding the nature of this Bathybius, so that it can- not now be cited as so definite an organism as the freely-swimming Protamoeba and Protogenes. Haeckel has referred these simple organisms to a sub-kingdom of Protista, which he considers to lie on the confines of both the animal and vegetable kingdoms. To a mass of protoplasm, whether it forms, as in one of these Protista, an independent organism, or is merely a portion of the substance of the body of a higher organism, Haeckel has H

The structure of tendons has been recently examined with great care by Ranvier, Spina, and Thin with reference to the arrangement of their cellular constituents, and in addi- tion to the fusiform and stellate branched cells, which had long been recognised, rows of cells situ- ated between and parallel to the fibrous bundles have been described. In young tendons these cells are polygonal, but in adult tendons they are more flattened. Thin states that they form a continuous Fig. 39.—Flat cells on surface of tendo Achillis of layer of flat cells in a frog.

(From Thin.) Key and Retzius have recently described the bundles of sub arachnoid connective tissue as surrounded by a layer of flattened cells, and a similar arrangement has been recorded by Mihalkovics around the bundles of the connective tissue stroma of the testicle. These flat endo-

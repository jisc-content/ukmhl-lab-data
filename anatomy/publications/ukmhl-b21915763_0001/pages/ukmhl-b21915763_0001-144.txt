The recent observations of H. Watney, indeed, show that, in the mucous membrane of the alimentary canal, a delicate reticulum of connective tissue is prolonged between the epithelial cells. The corium is also the seat of numerous glands, with their blood and lymph vessels and nerves; and the epithelial lining of the glands is continuous at their orifices with the epithelial in- vestment of the corium. The surface both of the mucous membianes and skin is usually more or less undulated sometimes it is thrown into strong folds or rugae, at others it is elevated into minute, frequently conical, processes, named in some localities papillae, in others villi; but in all these cases the epithelium is prolonged as a continuous cover- ing ovei the undulating free surface. The free surface of all mucous membranes is kept moist by the secretion or mucus which lubricates it. under the special name of the horny layer of the cuticle or epidermis, the superficial in- Fig. 30.â€”Scaly epithelium from the mucous membrane of the mouth.

83 MUSCLES OF EXPRESSION. eyebrows : they draw the eyebrows downwards and in- wards, wrinkle the skin of the forehead longitudinally, and contract with great vigour in the act of frowning. The auricle of the external ear has three small muscles inserted into it, one behind, the posterior auricular muscle, one above, the superior, one in front, the anterior : in man, as a rule, these muscles are feeble, and have little action ; but in many mammals they are large, and by them the animal pricks its ears to detect the faintest sound of danger. The eyelids are drawn together, so as to close the eye as in the act of sleep, by the orbicularis palpebrarum, the fibres of which lie in the eyelids and on the borders of the orbit, and surround the fissure between the eyelids. This muscle is a characteristic specimen of the group of sphincter muscles, i.e., muscles which surround orifices, and by their contraction close them. When the upper fibres of the muscle alone contract, the upper eyelid is depressed,— a movement which takes place almost involuntarily and with great frecpiency during our waking hours, so as to wash the tears over the exposed part of the eyeball and keep it moist. In expressing a “ knowing wink,” the lower fibres alone of the orbicularis contract, and the lower lid is elevated. The elevation of the upper lid, as in opening the eye, is due to the levator palpebrse superioris, which, arising within the orbit, is inserted into the upper eyelid. Muscles are inserted into the cartilaginous frame- work of the nostrils so as to increase or diminish the size of their orifices, and thus to promote or impede the passage of air into the nose. The size of the orifice is increased by two elevator muscles inserted into the ala, or side of the nostril; and when viole nt exercise is being performed, or

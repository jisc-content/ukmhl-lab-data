227 SPINAL COED. Horizontal fibres can also be traced from the grey matter of the anterior cornu into the anterior and lateral columns, and fibres may also be traced from the posterior cornu into the posterior part of the lateral column. The grey crescentic portion of the cord contains con- nective tissue, blood-vessels, nerve fibres, and nerve cells. The nerve fibres in the grey matter are numerous; and whilst some possess a medullary sheath, others consist only of the axial cylinder â–  they divide and subdivide, and, as Gerlach has shown, form a narrow - meshed network of extremely minute fibres. The nerve cells are multipolar, and are chiefly collected in the anterior and posterior horns of each crescent. The cells of the an- terior cornu are large, distinct, and stellate, and form well-defined groups of nerve cells (Fig. 68). Those of the posterior cornu are, as a rule, much smaller in size, more elongated in shape, but with stellate branched processes. They are not so distinct as in the anterior horn, owing to the connective tissue with its corpuscles being so abundant; this tissue is best marked at the tip of the posterior horn, where it forms the substantia gelatinosa of Rolando. Groups of larger stellate branched cells may, however, be seen in well-prepared sections at a short distance from the tip of the posterior cornu. Sometimes also isolated nerve cells may be seen in the white columns immediately out- side the grey matter of this cornu. Lockhart Clarke has described an intermedio-lateral group of nerve cells situ- ated at the outer side of the grey matter, about midway between the anterior and posterior horns, in the upper part of the cervical portion of the cord, and in the thoracic part between the brachial and crural enlargements.

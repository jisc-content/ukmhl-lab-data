INTERNAL STRUCTURE OP THE CEREBRUM. 283 midal cells lie in the third and fourth layers. L. Clarke stated that the^ cells of all the layers of the posterior or occipital lobe were small and of nearly uniform size, whilst in the convolutions anterior to it numerous cells of a much larger kind were found; but though it is undoubtedly true that large pyramidal cells are found in the fronfal lobe in considerable numb.ers, and that the greater nifmber of the cells of the occipital lobe are small and nearly uniform in size,\ there is no difficulty in recognising in the occipital lobe a small proportion of cells, quite equal in magnitude to the n j r , . Fig. 92.—Vertical section through the 3d largest ceils ot the frontal and 4th layers of grey matter of the n i ■ , , , superior frontal convolution. Large lobe, interspersed amongst and small-sized pyramidal nerve cells; ,t n the neuroglia, with its corpuscles and tne smaller pyramidal ceils. some capillary blood-vessels, are repre- sented. The nerve fibres which as- cend into the grey matter from the white core of the con- volution radiate into its several layers, and are apparently continuous with the basal axial cylinder processes of the nerve cells. According to Clelaud, the elongated apices of the cells, which are directed to the surface of the convolu- tion, are continuous with the nerve fibres situated in the superficial layer of horizontal fibres.

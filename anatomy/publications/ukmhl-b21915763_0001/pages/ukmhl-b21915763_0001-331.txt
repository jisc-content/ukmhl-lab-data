319 SYMPATHETIC NERVOUS SYSTEM. surrounding the abdominal aorta.. It divides into two parts, which lie one on each side of the rectum, and are' called the pelvic plexuses ; these plexuses are joined by branches from the sacral ganglia of the sympathetic, and from the 3d and 4th sacral spinal nerves, and contain small gangliform collections of nerve cells. From the pelvic plexuses numerous plexiform nerves arise, which accompany the internal iliac artery and its branches to the walls and viscera of the pelvis, and are named after them. These nerves not only supply the vaso-motor nerves for these blood-vessels, but also the muscular coat and mucous membrane of the bladder, rectum, and urethra, besides the prostate gland in the male, and the uterus and vagina, and in part the ovary, in the female; in connection with their distribution to these viscera, minute ganglia are found lying amidst the nerves, the nerve cells in which act undoubtedly as centres of reinforcement for the origin of additional nerve fibres. From the distribution of the branches of the gangliated cord of the sympathetic, and of the gangliated prevertebral plexuses, it will be seen that this nerve is especially asso- ciated with the blood-vessels and the thoracic and abdo- minal viscera. As the cerebro-spinal system is engaged in the supply of nerves to the voluntary muscles, the sympa- thetic is the medium of supply for the involuntary mus- cular apparatus, both in the coats of the vessels and in the walls of the hollow viscera. But though the vaso-motor nerves branch off from the sympathetic ganglia, it must not be supposed that they have no connection with the cerebro-spinal system. The communicating branches be- tween the sympathetic ganglia and the anterior divisions

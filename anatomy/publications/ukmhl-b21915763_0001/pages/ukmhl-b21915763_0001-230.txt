218 ANATOMY. sinuses pass usually from before backwards: a superior longitudinal along tbe upper border of tbe falx cerebri, fiom the crista galli to the internal occipital protuberance; an inferior longitudinal along its lower border as far as the tento- rium, where it joins the straight sinus, which passes back as far as the same protuberance. One or two small occipital sinuses, which lie in the falx cerebelli, also pass to join the straight and longitudinal sinuses opposite this protuberance; several currents of blood meet, therefore, at this spot, and as Herophilus supposed that a sort of whirlpool was formed in the blood, the name torcular Herophih has been used to express the meeting of these sinuses. Fiom the torcular the blood is drained away by two laige sinuses, named lateral, which curve forwards and down- wards to the jugular foramina to terminate in the internal jugular veins. In its course each lateral sinus receives two petroscd sinuses, a superior and an inferior, which pass from the cavernous sinus backwards along the upper and lower borders of the petrous part of the temporal bone. The spinal part of the dura mater hangs loosely in the spinal canal, and forms a tubular investment for the spinal cord. It does not serve as a periosteum for the vertebra;, which possess a distinct periosteal covering, between which and the dura mater loose fat and a plexus of veins are situated. It gives off no bands from its inner surface, and it does not split into two layers for the lodgment of venous blood sinuses.- The spinal dura mater forms a tubular enve- lope for the spinal cord and the origins of the spinal nerves. It extends from the foramen magnum, where it is con- tinuous with the cranial dura mater, to the lower end of the sacral canal, ends below in a funnel-shaped prolongation, and

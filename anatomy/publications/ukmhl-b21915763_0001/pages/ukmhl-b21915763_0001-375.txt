363 THE EAR. manner, and the intervals between them are occupied by fluid ; the joint seems, therefore, a modified amphiarthrosis. The bones are moved on each other at these joints by small muscles. The tensor tympani arises from the apex of the petrous temporal, and the cartilage of the Eustachian tube, enters the tympanum at its anterior wall, and is in- serted into the handle of malleus near its root. The Ictxa- tor tympani muscle arises from the spine of the sphenoid, and the cartilage of the Eustachian tube enters the tym- panum through the Glaserian fissure, and is inserted into the neck of the malleus. The stapedius arises within the pyramid, enters the tympanum through the hole at its apex, and is inserted into the neck of the stapes. The tympanum is lined by a mucous membrane continuous with that of the Eustachian tube, which invests the tympanic ossicles, liga- ments, and muscles, and is prolonged backwards so as to line the mastoid air-sinuses. The epithelium covering this mem- brane, where it lines the floor and the adjacent part of the anterior, posterior, and internal walls, consists of ciliated columnar cells; but the epithelium covering the roof, the promontory, the membrani tympani, and the tympanic ossicles, is tessellated. In the sub-epithelial connective tissue the blood and lymph vessels and nerves of the tympanum ramify. Kessel has recently described in it certain peculiar bodies, which consist of a central axial band with a series of capsules, possessing a fibrillar struc- ture, arranged concentrically around the axis ; the function of these bodies is not known. The formation of the auricle and external meatus is well adapted for collecting and transmitting sound-vibrations inwards to the middle ear and labyrinth. These vibrations

31 AXIAL SKELETONâ€”HEAD. called the antrum, or superior maxillary air-sinus. The nasal surface articulates with the inferior turbinal and palate bones. The nasal and facial surfaces become con- tinuous with each other at the anterior aperture of the nose, and from them a strong process ascends to join the frontal bone close to the glabella; this process also articu- lates with the lachrymal and nasal bones. The palatal surface forms a part of the bony roof of the mouth, and presents in front a small hole (the incisive foramen) which communicates with the nose. In the sheep and many other mammals this hole is of large size; the palatal surface is bounded externally by a thick elevated border, in which are the sockets, or alveoli, for the lodgment of the fangs of the teeth; internally this surface articulates by a narrow border with the other superior maxilla and with the vomer, and, posteriorly, with the palate-bone. The Palate-bone (Fig. 7) lies in contact with the inner surface and posterior border of the superior maxilla, and separates it from the sphenoid. It is in shape not unlike the capital letter L, the horizontal limb forming the hinder part of the bony roof of the mouth by its lower surface, and the back part of the floor of the nose by its upper. The ascending limb assists in forming the outer wall of the nose, and subdivides into an anterior, or orbital, and a posterior, or sphenoidal, pro- cess. At the junction of the two limbs is the pyramidal process, which articulates with the lower ends of the pterygoid processes of the sphenoid. The Vomer (Fig. 7), shaped like a ploughshare, lies vertically in the mesial plane of the nose, and forms a large part of the partition which separates one nostril from

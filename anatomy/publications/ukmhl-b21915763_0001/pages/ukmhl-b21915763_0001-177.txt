OSSEOUS TISSUE. 165 Jorating -fibres of Sharpey may be drawn out of the holes or sockets in which they are lodged. When thin sections through a macerated and dried bone are examined under the higher powers of the microscope, the lamellated matrix is seen to exhibit a very peculiar appearance, which is characteristic of the osseous tissue. Between the surfaces of adjacent lamellae irregularly elongated spaces, called lacunae, are to be seen in con- siderable numbers; these lacunae, like the lamellae be- tween which they are situated, have a concentric arrange- ment around the Haversian canals. The lacunae, the lamellae, and the Haver- sian canal which they surround, are sometimes named a Haversian sys- tem. From the ends and sides of any one of these lacunae very minute „ „ _ . ,, , J Fig. 52.—Transverse section through the com- branching canals, termed Pact tlsauo of t}1® shaft of a long bone.

The lacunae average in length inch, and their transverse diameter is about inr o o o ^h suVo^1 inch ; the canaliculi vary from -^i^-th to inch in diameter. When examined in a dried bone by transmitted light, the lacunae look like solid, black bodies, and the canaliculi seem to be processes branching off from them, hence they were erroneously called by the earlier

In it the two articular surfaces are each covered by a plate of encrusting cartilage, the free surface of which is smooth and polished ; between these surfaces is a cavity containing a glairy fluid, the synovia, for lubricating the smooth surfaces of the cartil- age and facilitating the movements of the joint.

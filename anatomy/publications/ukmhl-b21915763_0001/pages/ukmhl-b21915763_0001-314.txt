ANATOMY. 302 trochlear, the nerve for the superior oblique muscle; c, abducent, the nerve for the external rectus ; d, portio dura, the nerve for the facial muscles of expression; e, spinal accessory, the nerve which gives a motor root to the pneumogastric, and supplies the sterno-mastoid and tra- pezius muscles; /, hypoglossal, the nerve for the muscles of the tongue. Third group.—Mixed nerves : a, trifacial, distributed to the muscles of mastication, the skin of the face, various mucous membranes, and to the anterior and lateral surfaces of the tongue, where it may play the part of a nerve of the special sense of taste; b, glosso-pharyngeal, distributed to the mucous membrane of the pharynx, to certain palato- pharyngeal muscles, and to the mucous membrane of the back of the tongue, where it acts as a nerve of the special sense of taste; c, the pneumogastric, conjoined with the internal division of the spinal accessory, is distributed to several muscles, mucous membranes, and internal organs. The consideration of the 1st group of cranial nerves may appropriately be deferred until the organs of sense, in which they terminate, are described. The anatomy of the Motor Nerves is as follows:— The Oculo-motor or third nerve springs out of the inner surface of the crus cerebri. When its fibres are traced into the crus, some are seen to pass to the nerve cells of the locus niger, whilst others sink into the corpora quadri- gemina, and extend as far as the Sylvian group of nerve cells. The nerve, after it has emerged from the crus, runs forwards in the outer wall of the cavernous sinus, and enters the orbit through the sphenoidal fissure. It supplies the levator palpebras superioris, the superior, in-

NERVOUS TISSUE. 197 characterised by the absence of a medullary sheath, are chiefly found in the sympathetic nervous system, but they occur also in the cerebro-spinal system. The fibres of the olfactory nerve are non-medullated, so also are the peri- pheral terminations of the cerebro-spinal nerves, and indeed all nerve fibres in the first stage of their development. In Petromyzon it has been stated that all the nerve fibres are distinguished by the absence of a medullary sheath. This form of nerve fibre consists of pale grey, translucent, flattened bands, the ggVffth to ¥oVoth ^nc^L diameter. They usually appear as if homo- geneous or faintly granular; but Schultze showed that, when carefully examined, they present a delicate fibrillated appearance, like that seen in the axial cylinder of a medullated nerve; hence, like that cylinder, they are supposed to be composed of multitudes of extremely delicate primitive fibrilke imbedded in a finely granulated material. Sometimes these fibres consist solely of this fibrillated material, at other times they are invested by Fig. 64. — Koit- a sheath similar to the primitive membrane medullated nerve fibres of a medullated fibre. Nuclei are also found from the sym- pathetic sys- both in the substance of the fibre and in tem- relation with the primitive membrane. The presence of multitudes of fibres in the sympathetic nervous system, formed either entirely, or almost entirely, of a material precisely similar in structure to the axial cylinder of a medullated fibre, and by which the proper function of the fibre can alone, therefore, be exercised, is, of course, an additional argument to those previously advanced, in

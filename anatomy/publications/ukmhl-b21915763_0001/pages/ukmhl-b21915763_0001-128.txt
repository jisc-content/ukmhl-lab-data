116 ANATOMY. which was thus the source of successive broods of young cells. They gave to the nucleus, therefore, an importance in the economy of the cell greater than had previously been assigned to it. As the investigations into cell structure became more extended, it was ascertained that a cell wall was by no means always present; that in many of the cells in which it had been supposed to exist it could not satisfactorily be demonstrated, and that in others, more especially in young actively-growing cells, no trace of an investing envelope could be observed. Hence the importance of the cell wall as an essential component of a cell was still further diminished: and Leydig then defined a cell to be a little mass composed of a soft substance enclosing a central nucleus. But a most important advance in our conceptions of the essential structure of a cell was made when Briicke pointed out that the contents of cells not unfre- quently possessed the property of spontaneous move- ment and contractility, and when Max Schultze deter- mined that the contractile substance termed sarcode, which forms so large a part of the bodies of the lower animals, was analogous and apparently homologous with the contents of young actively-growing animal and vege- table cells, before a differentiation of these contents into special secretions or other materials had taken place. As the term “ protoplasm” had been introduced by Von .Mohl to express the contents of the vegetable cell, which under- goes changes in the process of growth, it was adopted by the animal histologist; and Max Schultze suggested that a cell should be defined to be a nucleated mass of protoplasm,—a definition which is adopted in this

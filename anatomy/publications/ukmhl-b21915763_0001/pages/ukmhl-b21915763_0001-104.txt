A combination of abduction, movement forwards, adduction, and movement backwards, produces the movement of circumduction. Certain move- ments of the upper limb, however, take place not only at the shoulder joint, but between the two bones of the shoulder girdle; for in elevating the arm, whilst the supra- spinatus and deltoid initiate the movement at the shoulder joint, the farther elevation, as in raising the arm above the head, takes place by the trapezius and serratus, which rotate the scapula and draw its inferior angle forward. The free range of movement of the human shoulder is one of its most striking characters, so that the arm can be moved in every direction through space, and its efficiency as an instrument of prehension is thus greatly increased.

(After Goocisir.) the scapula, is characteristi- cally human, and a distinct articular area is provided on the head of the humerus for this movement. The Elboio Joint is the articulation between the humerus, radius, and ulna: the great sigmoid cavity of the ulna is adapted to the trochlea of the humerus, and the cup of the radius to the capitellum. The joint is enclosed by a capsular ligament lined by a synovial membrane, which is

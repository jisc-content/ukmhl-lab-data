ANATOMY. 160 in form and distinctly nucleated. Sometimes two or three are grouped together, but not unfrecjuently they occur singly. They are separated from each other by short fibres like those of connective tissue. In these discs the fibrous matrix is always stronger and more distinct in the peripheral than in the central part. White fibro-cartilage is transitional between true hyaline cartilage and connec- tive tissue, i.e., the cells possess the characters of cartilage cells, whilst the matrix, instead of being hyaline, is fibrous, like the matrix of the connective tissue. The yellow elastic fibro-cartilages are the epiglottis, the cornicula laryngis, the cartilaginous framework of the auricle of the human ear, and the ears of mammalia generally, and the petrous end of the cartilaginous wall of the Eustachian tube. The cells are rounded or ovoid, distinctly nucleated, and usually arranged singly or in pairs. The matrix is dis- tinctly fibrous; the fibres, which form a close intersecting network, branch and sometimes anastomose. They resist the action of acetic acid like the yellow fibres of connective tissue; and Donders has described a continuity between them and the elastic fibres of the connective tissue, which forms the investing perichondrium of this form of cartilage. The yellow fibro-cartilage has no tendency to ossify. The bars and plates of cartilage—except the encrusting hyaline cartilages, and the interarticular, marginal, and in- vesting white fibro-cartilages—are surrounded by a fibrous membrane or perichondrium. In the achdt human body cartilage is not penetrated by blood-vessels, but is nourished by the vessels which ramify in its investing perichondrium. In the foetus, however, and in the large masses of cartilage which are found in the skeletons of the cetacea and of the

THE TONGUE. 379' have become cornified and elongated into dense, imbricated brush-like processes. In the carnivora the epithelium is so hardened as to form sharp spines, with the points turned backwards, which give to the tongues of these animals a rough prickly character. In the fungiform and circumvallate papillae the inequalities between the pro- jecting secondary papillae are filled up by tessellated epi- thelium, so that the surface of the compound papillae has a smooth appearance. Both the simple and compound papillae are highly vascular; the lingual artery not only supplies the muscular substance of the tongue, but gives off fine branches to the mucous membrane. These branches end in capillaries, which form simple loops in the simple papillae, but in the compound papillae the capillaries are so multiplied that each secondary papilla â€˜has a capillary loop within it. The tongue is provided with several nerves. The hypo-glossal nerve supplies its muscular structure, but the inferior lingualis is said by some anatomists to receive a branch from the chorda tympani of the facial. The lingual branch of the fifth is distributed to the mucous membrane of the anterior two-thirds of the tongue: it breaks up into minute branches, which enter the fungi- form and filiform papillae, but their exact mode of termi- nation has not been precisely ascertained, though end- bulbs and gustatory bodies are said to have been seen in connection with some of the terminal branches. The glossal branch of the glosso-pharyngeal is distributed to the mucous membrane of the root of the tongue and of the circumvallate papillae In connection with its terminal branches peculiar flask-shaped organs, called gustatory bulbs or bodies, have recently been described by Loven, Schwalbe,

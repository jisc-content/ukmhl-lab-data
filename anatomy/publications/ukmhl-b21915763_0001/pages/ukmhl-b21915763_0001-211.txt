These cells usually possess a globular body, though sometimes it maybe elongated; and from, opposite points of the surface of the body a strong process is given off, which is directly continued into a nerve fibre. The axial cylinder of the fibre is con- tinuous with the cell substance, and Schultze has shown that both exhibit a delicate fibrillated structure. The medul- Fig 65. — Mpoia r 1-ary sheath and the primitive membrane nerve fibres con- , . , tinuous with it, from axe also usually continued from tne nbre the spinal ganglion ,, i • i of a skate, over the nerve cell Hence these bipolar cells seem to be, as Schultze expressed it, nucleated enlargements of the axial cylinder. A remarkable modification of the bipolar nerve cell, carefully studied and described by Lionel Beale, is found in the sympathetic ganglia of the frog. The cells are pear-shaped, and from the narrow end of the pear two nerve fibres arise, one of which, called the straight fibre, forms, as it were, the stalk of the pear; whilst the other, or spiral fibre, winds spirally round the straight fibre, and then passes away from the cell in the opposite direction. Both fibres are nucleated, and at their origin consist, apparently, of axial cylinder substance only; but in their course they may acquire both a medullary sheath and a primitive membrane. The straight fibre passes into the interior of the cell substance, and Arnold and Courvoisier

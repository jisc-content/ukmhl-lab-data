TEE EAR. 371 arranged in two groups, an inner and an outer. Tlie cells of the inner group rest by a broad foot on the inner part of the basilar membrane, close to its attachment to the spiral lamina, project obliquely forwards and outwards, and expand into a dilated head : the cells of the outer group also rest by a broad foot on the same membrane, incline forwards and inwards, and fit into a depression in the head of the cells of the inner group : these two groups of cells form the rods or pillars of Corti, and by their juxtaposition arch over an excessively minute canal enclosed between them and the basilar membrane, which may be named the canal of Corti. The inner rods are, however, more numerous than the outer, and Pritchard has shown that the rods increase in length from the base to the apex of the cochlea. Immediately internal and almost parallel to the inner group of these rods, and adjacent therefore to the crista spiralis, is a row of compressed conical cells, which possess at their anterior ends short stiff hair-like processes; they are the inner hair cells of Deiters. Immediately external and almost parallel to the outer group of rods are four or five rows of hair cells, the outer hair cells, which are attached by their bases to the basilar membrane, whilst from the opposite extremity a brush of hairs projects through the reticular membrane. The outer hair cells are, according to Waldeyer, relatively of large size in man. The reticular membrane of Kolliker is a delicate framework perforated by rounded holes. It extends parallel to the basilar mem- brane from the inner rods of Corti to the external row of outer hair cells, and through the holes in it the hairs of the outer hair cells project. It obviously acts as a support for the anterior ends of these cells, and binds together these

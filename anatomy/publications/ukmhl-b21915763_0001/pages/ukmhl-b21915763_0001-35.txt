The outer surface of each bone assists in forming the exterior of the cranium, and not unfrequently is marked by ridges or processes for the attachment of muscles. The inner surface, again, is smooth, and pitted with depressions, in which the convolutions of the brain are lodged, and also marked by grooves for the lodgment of dilated veins called blood sinuses, and of arteries termed meningeal. The two surfaces of a cranial bone, dense in structure, are called its tables, outer and inner, and are separated from each other by bone, looser and more spongy in its texture, called the diploe. In some localities, more especially in certain of the bones which form the walls of the nostrils, the diploe disappears, and comparatively wide interspaces separate the two tables, which contain air and are called air-sinuses. The margins of the bones are denticulated, and it is by the interlocking of the denticula- tions of adjacent bones that they are jointed together, the joints being named sutures. The bones are pierced by holes or foramina, and similar holes exist between the adjacent margins of some of the bones. These, foramina are mostly situated in the floor of the skull; they transmit arteries into the cranial cavity to supply the brain and the inner table with blood, and veins and nerves out of the cavity. The largest of these holes is called foramen mayyium. It lies in the occipital bone, immediately above the ring of the atlas; through it the spinal marrow becomes continuous with the brain, and the vertebral arteries pass to supply the brain with blood.

99 JOINTS AND MUSCLESâ€”LOWER LIMB. Joints and Muscles oe the Lower Limb. The innominate bones are connected to the spinal column by the sacro-iliac joints and the sacro-sciatic ligaments. The Sacro-iliac Joint is between the side of the sacrum and the internal surface of the ilium, the articular surfaces of which bones are covered by cartilage, and connected together by short, strong sacro-iliac ligaments. The Sacro-Sciatic ligaments stretch from the side of the sacrum and coccyx to the spine and tuberosity of the ischium. The two innominate bones are also connected together at the pubic symphysis, which is an amphiarthrodial joint. The sacro- iliac joints and pubic symphysis permit only slight move- ment; that at the former is about an imaginary axis, drawn transversely through the second sacral vertebra, which allows the base of the sacrum to be thrown forward and its apex backward in the stooping position of the body; but too great movement backward of the apex is checked by the sacro-sciatic ligaments. As the weight of the trunk, or of what may be carried in the arms or on the back, is transmitted through the hannch-bones to the lower limbs, the sacro-iliac ligaments require to be of great strength, because the sacrum, and with it the entire trunk, are sus- pended by them on the two innominate bones. The Hip Joint is a ball-and-socket joint; the ball is the head of the femur, and the socket the cup-shaped acetabu- lum in the haunch bone, the depth of the cup being in- creased by a ligament which is attached around the brim. A large capsular ligament, which is especially strengthened in front by an ilio-femoral band, encloses the articular sur-

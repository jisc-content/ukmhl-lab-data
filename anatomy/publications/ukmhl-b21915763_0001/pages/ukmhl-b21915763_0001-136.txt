ANATOMY. 124 disease the proportion is so very materially increased that they appear to be almost as numerous as the red. They are rounded in form, finely granulated or mulberry-like in appearance, and nucleatedâ€”the nucleus becoming more distinct after the addition of acetic acid; moreover, they are larger than the red corpuscles, their average diameter being from ^^-g-th to 3-oV'oth of an inch. Corpuscles of a similar form are found in the blood of all vertebrata. They do not vary so much in size in different animals as do the red corpuscles. In Triton, according to Gul- liver, their average diameter is 2 0*0 0th, whilst in Ilerpestes griseus they are not more than inch. The white blood corpuscles are minute nucleated clumps of proto- plasm ; they are therefore minute cells. It is very doubt- ful if they possess a cell wall, the evidence being against rather than in favour of its presence. The red blood corpuscles in all vertebrata, except the mammalia, are nucleated clumps of protoplasm; they are therefore minute cells. In mammals, owing to the ab- sence of a nucleus, they do not accord with the definition of a cell given on p. 116, and they are not therefore morphologically identical with the red corpuscles in other vertebrates. What their precise homology may be is some- what difficult to say, owing to the obscurity which prevails as to their exact origin. If they are merely clumps of specially modified protoplasm, budded off from the white corpuscles, then they are cytodes. If, as some have sup- posed, they are the nuclei of the white corpuscles, specially modified in composition, then they are free nuclei. If, again, they are the white corpuscles, the cell substance of which has undergone a special differentiation, and the

ANATOMY. 378 The mucous membrane of the tongue forms a part of the general mucous lining of the mouth; it covers the dorsum, tip, sides, and under surface; is reflected from the under surface to the floor of the mouth, where it forms thefraenum. or bridle of the tongue, and is reflected also from the base to the epiglottis as the frcenci of the epiglottis, as well as over the tonsils and anterior palatine pillars. This mem- brane has its free surface elevated into multitudes of fine processes, called the papillae of the tongue, some of which are simple, others compound. The simple papillae are situated on the back part of the dorsum and the under sur- face of the mucous membrane, as well as scattered between the compound papillae; they are simple conical elevations of the membrane. The compound teapillcB are arranged in three groups, named filiform, fungiform, and circumvallate papillae. The filiform papillae, elongated and thread-like, are the smallest and most numerous, and cover the dorsum in front of the circumvallate papillae. The fungiform or club-shaped papillae are scattered over the anterior and middle parts of the dorsum, and at the tip and sides. The circumvallate pap>illae, seven to twelve in number, form a V-shaped figure on the dorsum towards its base ; a depres- sion in the mucous membrane, called foramen caecum, marks the apex of the V. These are the largest papillse ; each is sunk in a vallum or trench-like depression of the mucous membrane, which isolates it from the surrounding surface. The compound character of these papillae is due to each having projecting from it numerous small secondary papillse. The epithelial covering of the filiform papillae is characterised by the peculiar modification which the tessel- lated epithelium of the mouth has undergone; the cells

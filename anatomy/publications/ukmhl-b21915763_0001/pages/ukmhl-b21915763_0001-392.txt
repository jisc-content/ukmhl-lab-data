When sections are made through one of these folds, or through a circumval- late papilla and the trench which surrounds it, numerous flask-shaped gustatory bulbs may be seen in the epithelium, which covers the side of the papilla and the opposite side of the trench. The bottom of each flask is next the sub-epithelial tissue, whilst its short neck opens on the surface by a mouth, the gustatory pore ; similar bodies, F10.113.—j, superficial though in much smaller numbers, have Gustatory bulb; g, also been seen in the fungiform papillfe. gustatory cell, with . « р, its peripheral, and Each gustatory body consists ot two cline- с, its central process. 0 1-77 rent forms of cells, named covering cells and gustatory cells.

In the cartilaginous fishes the cones are entirely absent; so also, as Schultze has shown, in the bat, hedge-hog, and mole; whilst in Fig. 102.—Cones of the retina of a hen. a, inner seg- ment of a cone; b, external grannie, containing a vari- cose librilla, which is pro- longed into the inner seg- ment; c, lenticular body at junction of the outer and inner segment; 8, mem- brana limitans externa. (From Ewart.) reptiles the bacillary layer is exclu- sively composed of cones. In all the vertebrata, except the mammalia, the twin or double cones described by Hannover probably exist. In the amphibia and some birds (Fig. 102), lens-shaped bodies have been described in the inner seg- ments of the cones. The rods and cones are the peripheral end-organs in connection with the fibres of the optic nerve, and their apparent relation to these fibres is as follows :— The optic nerve fibres are continuous with the central pro- cesses of the ganglion cells of the retina, the peripheral branching processes of which pass into the internal granu- lated layer, where they may possibly become continuous with the central processes of the inner granular layer. The peri- pheral processes of the inner granular layer enter the external granulated layer, but it is difficult to say whether or not they become continuous with the central processes of that layer. There can, however, be no doubt that the peripheral processes of this layer are directly continuous with the rods and cones of the bacillary layer. The entire arrangement is sometimes called the radial nervous fibres of the retina. In addition to the nervous structures just described, the retina contains a delicate supporting connective tissue like

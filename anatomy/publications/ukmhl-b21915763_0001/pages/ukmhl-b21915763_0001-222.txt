ANATOMY. 210 Descriptive Anatomy of the Cerebro-spinal Nervous System. In this section the anatomy of the Brain and Spinal Cord, and of the numerous distributory Nerves which arise from them, will be described. The brain and spinal cord are the largest and most important of all the nerve centres. They occupy the cranial cavity and spinal canal, and are continuous with each other through the foramen magnum in the occipital bone. As the arrangement of the struc- tures which compose the brain and spinal cord is extremely complex, and as the names applied to the several parts are numerous and often very arbitrary, it may be well, before commencing a detailed description, to make a few general observations on their mode of development. Development of the Cerebro-Spinal Nervous Axis.—In order to comprehend the development of the cerebro-spinal nervous axis, it will he necessary to say a few words on the arrangement of, and early changes in the germinal membrane or blastoderm in the ovum of the vertebrata. This membrane con- sists of three layers of cells, the outer, middle, and inner germinal layers of Remak and many other German em- ' bryologists, or the Fig. 70. — Transverseverticnl section through the epiblast, mesoblast, blastoderm of a chick at the end of the second day. hypoblast of E, epiblast; M, mesoblast; II, hypoblast.

This depression gradually deepens and forms a groove, the dorsal, neural, or cerebro-spinal groove, the sides and bottom of which are lined by the layers of cells (Fig. 70)

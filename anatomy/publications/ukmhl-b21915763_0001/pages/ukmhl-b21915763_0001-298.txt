286 ANATOMY. dum, though included between the corpus callosum and fornix, is yet in the same plane as the grey matter of the cortex of the inner surface of the hemispheres, but is cut off from it by the development of the transverse fibres of the corpus callosum. The grey matter of the locus per- forates anticus contains clusters of minute granules and a compact arrangement of small nerve cells. b, The great ganglia of the base of the cerebrum are the corpora striata, the optic thalami, the corpora geniculata, the corpora quadrigemina, and the locus niger in each crus cerebri. The corpus striatum cerebri consists of two masses of grey matter separated from each other by numerous striae of white fibres, which ascend from below upwards through its substance. The upper mass of grey matter projects into the lateral ventricle, and is called the intra-ventricular portion or nucleus caudatus. The lower extra-ventricular portion or nucleus lenticularis forms the outer and lower part of the corpus striatum, and is separated by the claustrum from the island of Reil. Multipolar nerve cells are found in both the caudate and lenticular masses, and in the latter cells of large size have been seen. The optic thalamus forms an almost continuous mass of grey matter traversed by nerve fibres, which are not, how- ever, collected into definite striae. The nerve cells in the grey matter are both multipolar and fusiform. The exter- nal corpus geniculatum consists of alternate layers of grey and white matter, due to the zig-zag folding of the grey matter; the nerve cells are multipolar, and contain pig- ment. In the internal corpus geniculatum the cells are smaller in size and fusiform.

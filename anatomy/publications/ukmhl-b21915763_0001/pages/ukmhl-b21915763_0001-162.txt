ANATOMY. 150 These corpuscles are believed to move about in the juice canals already referred to, and it is possible that they may have migrated into the tissue through the walls of its nutrient blood-vessels. The vascularity of the connective tissue varies in differ- ent localities. The perios- teum and perichondrium are very vascular; but their nume- rous vessels are concerned in the nutrition not merely of these fibrous membranes, but of the bone and cartilage Fig. 43. â€” Connective tissue of the which they invest.

As a rule, it may be stated that the fibrous connective tissues are not highly vascular, and that the nutritive changes which take place in them after their growth is completed are not very active. Connective tissue is sparingly supplied with nerves, and their mode of ter- mination in it has not been ascertained. The mode of development of the connective tissue has been much discussed by anatomists, and various views have been advanced as to the changes which lead to its pro- duction. It is now, however, generally admitted that, except perhaps the neuroglia, it arises from the cells of the mesoblast layer of the embryo, by a special morphological and chemical differentiation of their protoplasm, but the degree to which this differentiation may proceed varies with the particular form of tho texture. The neuroglia apparently

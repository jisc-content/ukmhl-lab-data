ANATOMY. 310 nerve is formed, which is the sensory nerve for the lower part of the face, and the skin of the temple, and the motor nerve for the muscles of mastication. Immediately after passing through the foramen this nerve divides into a small and large division, in each of which motor and sensory fibres are found. The small division supplies motor masticatory branches to the masseter, temporal, external and internal pterygoid muscles; but further it gives off a long buccal branch, which, though often described as the motor nerve for the buccinator muscle, is really a sensory nerve for the skin and mucous membrane of the cheek. The sensory nature of this nerve is proved, not only by physiological and pathological experiments, but by tracing its fibres through the buccinator muscle to the mucous membrane. I have also observed two cases in which the long buccal nerve arose as a branch of the sensory superior maxillary nerve. The large division separates into three branchesâ€”a, auriculo-temporal, which ascends to supply the parotid gland, the skin of the auricle, external meatus, and temple, and the temporo-maxillary joint; b, in- ferior dental, which enters the dental canal in the lower jaw, supplies the lower set of teeth, and, emerging through the mental foramen, supplies the skin and mucous membrane of the lower lip; the inferior dental also gives off a mylo-hyoid branch to the mylo-hyoid and anterior belly of the digas- tric muscle; c, lingual or gustatory, which runs forward along the side of the tongue to end in the filiform and fungiform papillae of its mucous membrane. The lingual branches are sensory nerves of touch, and many physiolo- gists believe that they are also nerves of taste. Connected with the branches of the inferior maxillary division are

ARTICULATORY AND MUSCULAR SYSTEMS. 67 articular surfaces of diarthrodial joints are retained in apposition with each other, some- times by investing ligaments, at some, as the carpal and tarsal joints, the surfaces are almost flat, so that they glide on each other; the move- ment is comparatively slight, and about an axis perpen- dicular to the moving surfaces : these are called plane- surfaced joints. In other joints the articular surfaces may be regarded as produced by the rotation of a straight or curved line about an axis lying in the same plane; these are called rotation joints, and they present various modifica- tions according to the direction and relation of the rotat- ing line to the axis. One form of a rotation joint is the pivot joint, in which the movement takes place about the axis of one of the bones, which is the axis of rotation of the joint; examples of this joint are found in the joint between the atlas and odontoid process of the axis and the radio-ulnar joint. Another form is the ginglymus or hinge joint, in which the axis of rotation of the joint is perpendicular to the axes of the two bones; the move- ments of the hinge are called flexion when the angle tendons; at others by atmospheric ? others by surrounding muscles and pressure, aided by the adhesive character of the interposed synovia. The form of the articular or mov- able surfaces varies very materi- ally in different examples of these

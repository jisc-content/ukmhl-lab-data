131 EPITHELIUM. or the several mucous canals. The epithelial cells are as a rule arranged in layers or strata, and the shape of the cells is by no means uniform in the different layers. The cells of the deeper strata are usually smaller, softer, more rounded, and more recently formed than those of the super- ficial strata, though sometimes, as in the bladder, conjunc- tiva, and some other mucous surfaces, they may be irregular in form and size, or even elongated into short columns. The cells next the free surface have a tendency to be shed, and their place is then taken by the cells of the deeper layers, which become modified in form as they approach the surface. The form of the cells of the superficial layer varies in different localities, which has led to a division of epithelium into groups bearing appropriate names. Epithe- lium is distinguished further by being devoid of blood- vessels, i.e., it is non-vascular; and also, with some excep- tions, devoid of nerves, i.e., non-sensitive. The epithelial cells, whether arranged in one or several strata, rest upon a subjacent tissue, which, from its rela- tion to the cells, may be called sub-epithelial. The sub- epithelial tissue is a form of the fibrous variety of connec- tive tissue, to be subsequently described, and in it lie the nerves, the blood and lymph vessels, and the involuntary muscular tissue of the skin and mucous membranes; hence it is sometimes described as a fibro-vascular tissue or corium. It was for a long time believed that, between the deeper sur- face of the epithelium and the corium, a definite, homo- geneous, continuous membrane, named by Bowman a base- ment membrane, intervened, which formed a sharp line of demarcation between the epithelial and the sub-epithelial tissue. Bowman, however, himself admitted that in some

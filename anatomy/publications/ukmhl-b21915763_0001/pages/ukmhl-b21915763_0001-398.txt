ANATOMY 386 of certain of the cranial nerves, the origin and distribution of which have already been described. They run through the subcutaneous tissue, and enter the deep surface of the cutis, where they divide into branches. As these pass towards the papillae they unite to form a nerve plexus, from which smaller branches arise to enter the papillse, and terminate, more especially in the skin of the palm of the hand, fingers, and sole, which are the surfaces most sensi- tive to touch impressions, in the tactile or touch coi'puscles. The touch corpuscles discovered by Wagner and Meissner are the peripheral end-organs of the nerves of touch (Fig. 114). They may be single or compound; are usually ovoid inform, not unlike a minute fir cone; and are transversely marked, from the transverse direction of the nuclei of the fusiform cells which form an investing capsule. Each single corpuscle and each division of a compound corpuscle is penetrated by one, and, according to Thin, by never more than one, medullated nerve fibre, but the exact mode of termination of the axial cylinder of the fibre has not been ascertained. Virchow and other German observers have stated that the papillse which contain capillaries do not contain nerves or touch cbrpuscles, and vice versa ; but Dalzell and Thin have shown that certainly the majority of papillse that contain nerve fibres and touch corpuscles are also vascular papillae. Non-medullated nerve fibres ascend to the surface of the cutis, and, according to Lan gerhans, pass into the rete Malpighii between the cells of the mucous layer.

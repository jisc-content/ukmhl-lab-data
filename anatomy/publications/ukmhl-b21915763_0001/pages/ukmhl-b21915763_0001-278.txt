ANATOMY. 266 transverse external part of the parieto-occipital fissure ■ the depth and extent of this fissure vary in different brains in Fig. 86.—Side view of the Brain in the skull.1 1 The above view of the brain in situ, shows the relations of the sur-. face convolutions to the regions of the skull. B, fissure of Bolando, which separates the frontal from the parietal lobe. PO, parieto-occi- pital fissure between the parietal and occipital lobes. SS, fissure of Sylvius, which separates the temporo-sphenoidal from the frontal and parietal lobes. The frontal area lies in front of the coronal suture. SF, MF, IF, the supero-, mid-, and infero-frontal subdivisions of the frontal area of the skull; the letters are placed on the superior, middle, and inferior frontal convolutions; the inferior frontal region is separated from the middle frontal by the frontal [part of the curved line of the temporal ridge; the mid- from the supero-frontal by a line drawn backwards from the upper margin of the orbit through the frontal eminence. SAP, the supero-antero-parietal area of the skull; S is placed on the ascending parietal convolution, AP on the ascending frontal convolution. IAP, the infero-antero-parietal area of the skull; I is placed on the ascending parietal, AP on the ascending frontal con- volution. SPP, the supero-postero-parietal area of the skull; the letters are placed on the angular convolution. IPP, the infero-

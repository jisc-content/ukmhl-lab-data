ANATOMY. 168 principally of colossal many-nucleated cells, the myeloid cells (myeloplaxes) of Robin, lying in a very delicate areo- lar tissue, and supplied by a network of capillary blood- vessels. It contains little or no fat. Yellow marrow, again, is composed of fat cells lying in a delicate areolar tissue -with accompanying blood-vessels. The areolar tissue, which supports the marrow cells, lines the medullary canal and cancelli, and is named the medullary membrane, or the endosteum. In the fresh bone the lacunae are not empty spaces as in the macerated bone. They are filled up by nucleated clumps of protoplasm, and are therefore, as Goodsir was the first to show, the seats of little masses of nucleated cells, which cells are the true bone-corpuscles. The protoplasm of these cells is apparently prolonged into the cana- liculi. Hence the hard part of the osseous texture has within it a system of nucleated cells, some of which occupy the lacunas and canaliculi, while others form a lining to the Haversian canals. The blood-vessels of a bone are abund- ant. It receives its arteries partly from the small arteries which ramify in the Fig. 55.— Nucleated branched cells oc- periosteum, the fine branches of which cupying the lacunie and canaliculi ot a enter the Haversian canals, and form bone. ■within them an anastomosing network of capillaries; partly through a special artery which enters the nutrient canal in the bone, to be distributed chiefly to the marrow; partly through small arteries which enter openings in the compact tissue near the articular extre- mities. The veins of bones are also abundant. In the

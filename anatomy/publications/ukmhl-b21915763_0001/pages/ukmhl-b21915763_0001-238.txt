226 ANATOMY. into the cord, the fibres of these roots pass horizontally or obliquely in their course inwards to the grey matter. The fibres of the anterior and posterior commissures have also a horizontal course. Those of the anterior commis- sure pass from the anterior cornu of grey matter on one side, across the bottom of the anterior median fissure, where they decussate with the corresponding fibres from the opposite side, and enter the anterior column of the opposite side, though some of the fibres bend back in the grey matter towards the posterior cornu. The fibres of the posterior commissure, more delicate than those of the anterior, not only lie at the bottom of the posterior median 7, Transverse section through the central canal, C, of the cord, and its snr- nerve colls; V, a pair of transversely divided blood-vessels, probab } \ fissure, but traverse the neuroglia surrounding the central canal, and enter the posterior cornua and posterior columns.

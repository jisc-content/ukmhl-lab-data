ANATOMY. 296 with a large proportion of nerve cells, the foldings of the surface are tortuous, the sulci are numerous and deep, and the grey matter possesses relatively considerable thickness. As regards the convolutions in opposite hemispheres of the same brain, it should be stated that a want of sym- metry is by no means uncommon. Mass and Weight op the Brain.—The human brain is absolutely bigger and heavier than the brain of any animal, except the elephant and the larger whales. The brain of the elephant is said to weigh from 8 to 10 lbs., and that of a large finner whale between 5 and 6 lbs. The human brain is also heavier relatively to the bulk and weight of the body than are the brains of the lower animals, except in some small birds and mammals. Considerable variations, however, exist in the size and weight of the human brain, not only in the different races of mankind, but in individuals of the same race and in the two sexes. The heaviest brains occur in the white races. The average weight of the adult European male brain is 49 to 50 oz. (about 3 lbs.), that, of the adult female 44 to 45 oz.; so that the brain of a man is on the average fully 10 per cent, heavier than that of a woman. The greater weight of the brain in man as compared with woman is not in relation merely to his greater bulk, but is a fundamental sexual distinction; for, whilst there is a difference of 10 per cent, in the brain weight, the average stature of women is, according to Thurnam’s calculations, only 8 per cent, less than that of men. Dr Boyd states that the average weight of the brain in the newly born male infant is 11*67 oz.; in the female only 10 oz. The exact age at which the brain reaches its maximum size has been variously placed at from

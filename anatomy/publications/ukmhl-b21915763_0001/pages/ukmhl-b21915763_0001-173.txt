CARTILAGINOUS TISSUE. 161 cartilaginous fishes, the cartilage is permeated by canals in which blood-vessels ramify. The encrusting cartilages are nourished by the blood-vessels of the synovial membrane of the joint, which form a vascular ring around the margin of the cartilage; and, both in them and in the forms of white fibro-cartilage that do not possess a perichondrium, the vessels of the bone, to which these cartilages are as a rule attached assist in conveying nourishment to the attached surface of the cartilage. In the movable joints, after the child has begun to use its limbs, the synovial membrane is not continued over the free surface of the articular cartilage, but stops at its margin along the line of the vascular ring. In the foetus, however, it has been stated that both blood-vessels and synovial membrane are prolonged over the free surface of the articular cartilage. The termination of nerves in cartilage has not been ascer- tained. In the development of hyaline cartilage the contents of the embryonic mesoblast cells where the cartilage is to be produced, become clear, and a cell wall differentiates around the exterior of the cell. The nuclei in the cells divide and subdivide, so that a multiplication of the cells by endo- genous reproduction takes place. Hyaline matrix sub- stance then appears between the cells, and is concentrically arranged around them; it is believed to be formed by a special conversion of successive layers of the cell proto- plasm into a substance which yields chondrine on boiling. The fibro-cartilages, both white and yellow, but especially the latter, yield but little chondrine on boiling, for the fibrous matrix of the white fibro-cartilage is a gelatine yielding substance, like the white fibres of connective

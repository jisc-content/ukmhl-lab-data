ANATOMY. 186 correct, spaces in tlie interior of the muscular fibres are continuous with the lymphatic system. The vascularity of the fleshy belly is much greater than that of the terminal tendons of attachment, and the nutritive changes are much more active in it than in them. The mode of termination of nerves in muscle will be considered in the section on nervous tissue. The contractile fibro-cells of the non-striped muscular fibre are formed by the gradual elongation of the rounded cells of the middle germinal layer, or mesoblast, of the embryo into spindle-shaped cells, the oval nuclei at the same time becoming elongated, so as to assume a rod- shaped form. Usually the spindle cells which lie in the same linear series become cemented together into the smooth fibres of this form of muscle. The mode of development of the striped fibre from the mesoblast cells is more difficult to follow out, and various statements have been made as to the successive stages of its formation. Schwann believed that a fibre was built up of the embryonic cells of the part, which arranged themselves in linear series, coalescing with each other at their surfaces of contact; that the contents of the cells then became transversely striated, and that the cell walls formed the sarcolemma. Savory and Lockhart Clarke maintained that a formation of blastema took place around free nuclei, and that this blastema gradually assumed the striated character. Remak, Ivolliker, \\ ilson Fox, and Frey have, however, by studying the earliest stages of development in the very young embryo, estab- lished the fact that the striped fibres are developed from the cells of the embryo, though not in the manner described

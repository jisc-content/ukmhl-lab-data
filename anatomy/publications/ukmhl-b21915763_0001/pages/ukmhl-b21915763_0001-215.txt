NERVOUS TISSUE. 203 nection with the ultimate cell elements of the secreting glands. The end-organs, connected with the terminations of the nerves in these textures, possess certain structural peculiarities, which are by no means uniform in the different parts, so that the end-body connected with the peripheral termination of a nerve is distinctive of the organ in which it is situated. It will be a matter of convenience to defer the consideration of the peripheral end-bodies in the skin, organs of special sense, and the several glands, until these parts are described. In this chapter the mode of termination of the motor nerves in the voluntary and involuntary muscles, of the sensory nerves in the mucous membranes, and of the ending of the nerves in the remark- able bodies named Pacinian corpuscles, will alone be examined. After a nerve has entered a voluntary muscle it ramifies in the connective tissue, which lies between the fasciculi, and at the same time divides and subdivides into smaller branches. These branches interlace with each other and form plexuses, from which slender nervous twigs, often consisting of only a single medullated nerve fibre, pro- ceed, which ramify in the connective tissue, separating the individual muscular fibres from each other. The single nerve fibres in their turn branch, accompanied by a splitting of the axial cylinder, and these branches usually lose the medullated character. The mode of termination of these very delicate branches has been a subject of much dispute. Beale described them as forming a minute net- work, situated on the exterior of the sarcolemma, but in contact with it, and the fibres of this nervous network were distinctly nucleated. Other observers have, however,

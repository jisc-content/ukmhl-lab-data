THE BRAINâ€”CEREBRUM. 271 connects the two hemispheres, and with certain fissures situated on these surfaces of the hemisphere. The small convolutions which lie behind the internal part of the parieto-occipital fissure form the inner convolutions of the occipital lobe, or the occipital lobule (Fig. 88). Those which lie immediately in front of the same fissure belong to the inner face of the parietal lobe, and form the quadrilateral lobule. It is customary, however, to name the convolution which extends forwards from the parieto-occipital fissure along the margin of the longitudinal fissure to the anterior end of ther hemisphere, and which then turns back to the locus perforatus anticus, as the marginal convolution. This is separated by a fissure called calloso-marginal, from the callosal convolution or gyrus fornicatus, which, commencing at the locus perforatus anticus, turns round the anterior end of the corpus callosum, extends parallel to its upper surface, and then turns round its posterior end. It is separated from the corpus callosum by the callosal fissure, at the bottom of which the grey matter of the gyrus forni- catus terminates in a well-defined edge. The callosal convolution (Fig. 88) encloses the corpus callosum within the concavity of its arch, and from its direction is appropriately called fornicatus (arch-shaped). The posterior end of the callosal convolution curves downwards and then forwards, under the name of gyrus hippocampi, to the tip of the inner surface of the temporo- sphenoidal lobe. This gyrus is separated anteriorly by a narrow curved fissure called hippocampal or dentate fissure, from a white band, the tcenia hippocampi, which band possesses a free curved border, round which the pia mater and choroidal artery enter the lateral ventricle through the

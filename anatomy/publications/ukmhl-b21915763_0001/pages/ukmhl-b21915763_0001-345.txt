THE EYEBALL. 333 Thin believes them to be lymph-vessels traversing its substance, for he has seen a lining of flat cells similar to the endothelial cells lining the lymphatics (Fig. 99). It is probable that these spaces serve as the chan- nels for the migrating corpuscles to wander through. Thin also describes the proper cornea corpuscles as lying in lacunae, lined by flat cells, which communicate with each other and with the lymph-vessels. The 'posterior elastic lamina forms a distinct, translucent, structureless layer adherent to the back of the proper tissue of the cornea, from which it may be stripped off without much difficulty. When torn across, the edges curl inwards towards the corneal tissue. It is from -^-qVo 3uVtt th inch thick, and resists the action of various reagents. This lamina thins off at its circumference and splits into fibres, which become continuous with the pectinate ligament of the iris. The posterior epithelium of the cornea, also called the epithelium of the aqueous humour, forms a single layer of polygonal cells on the back of the posterior elastic lamina. It is continuous with the epithelial covering of the pectinate ligament and of the anterior surface of the iris. The cornea is not in the adult traversed by blood-vessels, though in the fcetus a layer of capillaries lies near its anterior surface. In the adult, however, the margin of the cornea is penetrated by a zone of capillary loops derived from the arteries of the conjunctiva ; these loops, according to Lightbody, are invested by perivascular lymph spaces. The venous canal of Schlemm runs round the circumference of the cornea, at the junction of its deeper layers with the sclerotic. Leber states that it is not a simple canal, but a plexiform arrangement of veins. The nerves of the

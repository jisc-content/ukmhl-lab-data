INTERNAL STRUCTURE OF THE CEREBRUM. 291 jority enter the optic thalami, in the grey matter of which many evidently terminate, though some may pass through into the cortex of the hemispheres as fibres of the corona radiata. But the grey matter of the thalamus gives origin to numerous radiating fibres : those which arise in its posterior part radiate into the occipital and temporal lobes, whilst those proceeding out of its anterior part radiate into the frontal, parietal, and temporal lobes, and the insula. In the optic thalamus the fornix arises. Its fibres emerge from the under surface of each thalamus, form the corpus albicans, and then pass backwards forming the upper boundary of the great transverse fissure to end as the taenia hippocampi in the gyrus hippocampi; hence this convolu- tion has a special connection with the optic thalamus through the fornix. In the corpus albicans the fibres of the fornix are arranged in loops, in the concavities of which nerve cells are situated. The optic thalamus also gives origin to the middle root of the optic tract. Owing to the connections of the locus niger, nucleus caudatus, and nucleus lenticularis with the crusta, Meynert has named them the ganglia of the crusta ; whilst the optic thalami, corpora quadrigemina, and geniculata are the gan- glia of the tegmentum. The comparison of the human brain with those of different mammals has shown that the development of the hemispheres bears a direct relation to the size of the crusta and its ganglia, whilst the develop- ment of the hemispheres is in inverse relation to the size of the tegmentum and its ganglia. The superior peduncles of the cerebellum connect that organ with the cerebrum. They arise in the grey matter of the veimiform process, ascend to the â– corpora quadri-

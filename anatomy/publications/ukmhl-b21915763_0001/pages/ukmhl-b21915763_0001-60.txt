48 ANATOMY. articulation with the corresponding bone on the opposite side of the pelvis. The three surfaces areâ€”a superior, for the origin of the pectineus muscle; a posterior, which enters into the wall of the true pelvis; and an inferior, which forms the upper boundary of the obturator foramen. The descending ramus is merely a downward prolongation of the inner end of the bone which joins the ischium, and aids in forming the side of the pubic arch. The junction of the outer end of the pubis with the ilium is marked by the pectineal eminence. The superior and posterior sur- faces are separated by the sharp pectineal line, which, starting from the spine of the pubis, runs outwards to aid in forming the brim of the true pelvis. The Ischium (Tig. 11), bke the ilium and pubis, has the fundamental form of a three-sided prismatic rod. One extremity (the upper) completes the acetabulum, whilst the lower forms the large prominence, or tuber ischii. The surfaces of the bone are internal or pelvic, external, and anterior. The pelvic and external surfaces are separated from each other by a sharp border, on which is seen the ischial spine. The pelvic and anterior surfaces are sepa- rated by a border, which forms a part of the boundary o the obturator foramen; but the border between the external and anterior surfaces is feebly marked. The tuberosity, a thick, rough, and strong process, gives origin to several powerful muscles: on -it the body rests in the sitting posture; an offshoot, or ramus, ascends from it to join the descending ramus of the pubis, and com- pletes both the pubic arch and the margin of the obturator foramen. . , By the articulation of the two innominate bones wi

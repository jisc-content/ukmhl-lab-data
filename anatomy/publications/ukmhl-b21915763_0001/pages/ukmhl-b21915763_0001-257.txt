THE BRAINâ€”MEDULLA OBLONGATA. 245 The Brain or Encephalon. By the term Brain or Encephalon is meant all that part of the central nervous axis which is contained within the cavity of the skull. It is divided into several parts, named medulla oblongata, pons, cerebellum, and cerebrum. The medulla oblongata is directly continuous with the spinal cord through the foramen magnum. The cerebel- lum lies above, and immediately behind the medulla ob- longata, with which it is directly continuous. The pons lies above and in front of the medulla, with which it is directly continuous. The cerebrum is the highest division, and lies above both pons and cerebellum, with both of which it is directly continuous. MEDULLA OBLONGATA. The Medulla Oblongata rests upon the basi-occipital. It is somewhat pyramidal in form, about 1J inch long, and 1 ineh broad in its widest: part. It is a bilateral organ, and is divided into a right and a left half by shallow anterior and posterior median fissures, continuous with the corre- sponding fissures in the 6pinal cord; the posterior fissure ends above in the 4th ventricle. Each half is subdivided into elongated tracts of nervous matter. Next to, and parallel with the anterior fissure is the anterior pyramid. This pyramid is continuous below with the cord, and the place of continuity is marked by the passage across the fissure of three or four bundles of nerve fibres, from each half of the cord to the opposite anterior pyramid; this cross- ing is called the decussation of the pyramids (Figs. 78, 70b

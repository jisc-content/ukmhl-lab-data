In amphibia the largest corpuscles, accord- ing to Gulliver, are about inch in length in Proteus and Siren, though Riddell states that in Amphiuma tridactylum they are id larger ; whilst the smallest, as in the common frog, average in length ? inch. In cartilaginous fish the corpuscles are larger than in osseous. In Lamna cor- nubica Gulliver found their long diameter to be inch ; while in the Salmonidse, which have the largest blood discs among osseous fish, the long diameter in the salmon and common trout is only about xst'B inch. The white or colourless corpuscles are comparatively few in number in the healthy human blood. Welcker has estimated the normal relative number as one white to 335 red; in pregnant and menstruating women the pro- portion is increased to about 1 to 280.

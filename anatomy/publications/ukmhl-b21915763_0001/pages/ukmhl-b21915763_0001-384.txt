ANATOMY. 372 important elements of tlie organ of Corti. Tire interval between the outer hair cells and the spiral ligament is occupied by cells of a more or less columnar form, the supporting cells of Hensen. Covering over the organ of Corti, and separating it from the endolymph of the ductus cochlearis, is the membrana tectoria, which springs from the crista spiralis close to the attachment of the membrane of Rcissner, passes outwards superficial to the membrana Fio 111 —Vertical transverse section through the'basilar membrane and organ of Corti. bm, cs, si, &c„ as in fig. 109; i, inner hair cell; tr, inner and or, outer rod of Corti; o, outer hair cells; sp, supporting cells; cn, cochlear nen e; re, canal of Corti; TO, reticular membrane; ml, membrana tectoria, torn thiough at its outer end.

The origin, course, and distribution of the auditory nerve in the labyrinth will now be considered. The auditory nerve is the portio mollis of the seventh cranial nerve. It appears at the base of the brain at the lower border of the

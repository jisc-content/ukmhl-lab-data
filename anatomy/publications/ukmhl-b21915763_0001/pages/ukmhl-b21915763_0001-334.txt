322 ANATOMY. sory nerves pass into their substance, and the axial cylin- der of the nerve fibre ends in tbeir interior. Tbe rods and cones of tbe retina, tbe rods of Corti in the cochlea, tbe olfactory cells of tbe nose, and tbe gustatory bodies in tbe tongue, are tbe end-organs belonging to tbeir several organs of sense; tbe sensory nerve fibres which termi- nate in relation with them have not yet, however, been traced into actual continuity with tbeir substance. A stimulus, whatever may be its nature, applied to any organ of sense can excite only that kind of sensation for tbe production of which tbe organ is subservient. Thus a stimulus applied to tbe eye, whether it be tbe natural stimulus of tbe waves of light, tbe mechanical stimulus of a blow, or an electric stimulus, can only excite tbe sensation of light. Stimuli applied to tbe ear can only excite tbe sensation of sound, and in like manner with tbe other senses. In studying tbe anatomy of tbe organs of sense tbe arrangement of numerous accessory structures, which assist either in conducting stimuli or in modifying tbeir effects, tbe arrangement and structure of tbe peripheral end-organs, and tbe origin, course, and distribution of tbe sensory nerves, will have to be considered. The Nose. Tbe Nose or organ of smell is a large cavity situated in tbe face, between tbe orbits, above tbe mouth, and below tbe cribriform plate of tbe ethmoid bone. It communicates by tbe anterior nares, or nostrils, with tbe external atmos- phere, by tbe posterior nares with tbe pharynx, and through it with the larynx, trachea, and lungs. It is the proper

139 ENDOTHELIUM. Here, as in tlie surfaces covered by epithelium, a base- ment membrane was at one time supposed to intervene between the cells and the connective tissue ; but it is now believed that the cells are in direct contact, by their deeper surface, with the connective tissue itself, which serves as the framework of support for the blood and lymph vessels and the nerves of the part. In the serous membranes and in the coats of the larger blood-vessels elastic fibres are present in considerable numbers in the sub-endothelial tissue. In the serous membranes the lymph- vessels are very abundant in the sub-epithelial tissue, where they form a layer parallel to the free surface of the mem- brane, from which short vessels pass vertically to open by minute orifices into the serous cavity. The serous mem- branes are attached by the sub-endothelial connective tissue to the organs which they invest. Each Serous Membrane consists of a portion which invests the viscus or organ, named the visceral layer, and a portion which lines the walls of the cavity in which the organ is situated, named the 'parietal layer. Between these two layers is the so-called serous cavity, the wall of which is formed by the smooth surfaces of both the parietal and the visceral layers. The serous membranes are as follows:â€”The two pleurae situated in the cavity of the chest, one invest- ing each lung, and lining the interior of that part of the thoracic cavity in which the lung is situated; the pericar- dium, which invests the heart, and lines the bag in which the heart is contained; the peritoneum, which invests the abdominal viscera, and lines the abdominal cavity; and the arachnoid membrane, which invests the brain and spinal cord, and is regarded by many as lining the dura mater, the

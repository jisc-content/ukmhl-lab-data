370 ANATOMY. upper passage, also widest at tlie base, communicates \\ ltli the cavity of the osseous vestibule. At the apex of the cochlea these two scalse communicate with each other through a small hole, the helicotrema. As the scala vestibuli opens into the osseous vestibule, the perilymph is continued into it, and through the helicotrema into the. scala tympani. The ductus cochlearis is the membranous cochlea, and its walls are formed of the basilar membrane next the scala tympani, of the membrane of Reissner next the scala vestibuli, and of the spiral ligament next the wall of the cochlea, which connects the two membranes together. It follows the spiral windings of the cochlea, terminates at the apex of the spiral in a closed end, whilst at the base it communicates with the sacculus of the membranous vesti- bule by a slender tube, the ccmalis reunion* ; hence the membranous cochlea contains endolymph. The tei ruina- tion of the cochlear branches of the auditory nerve and the arrangement of the peripheral end-organs in relation to them are to be looked for in the basilar membrane. These parts have been repeatedly investigated and described in elaborate monographs, the titles of which are given in Waldeyer’s article on the cochlea in Strieker’s Handbuch der Lehre von den Geweben. The general results only of these investigations will be given here, and the original memoirs may be referred to for further details. On the surface of the basilar membrane directed to the ductus cochlearis a remarkable arrangement of cells exists, which presents ail appearance that has been compared with the key-board of a pianoforte, and has been named the organ ofCorti ; it consists of the following parts:-Some of these cells, distinguished by their elongated curved form, are

It is therefore a depart- ment of the science of Biology. It resolves itself into two great divisions—Animal Anatomy or Zootomy, the object of which is to investigate the structure of animals; and Vegetable Anatomy or Phytotomy, the object of which is to elucidate the structure of plants. Animal Ana- tomy, again, naturally resolves itself into two divisions: one in which the construction, form, and structure of two or more animals are compared with each other, so as to bring out their features of resemblance or dissimilarity,—this is called Comparative Anatomy; the other, in which the construction, form, and structure of parts in a single ani- mal are considered, which is termed Special Anatomy. The special anatomy of an animal may be studied from A

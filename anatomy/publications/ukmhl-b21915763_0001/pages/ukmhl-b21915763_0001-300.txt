ANATOMY. 288 relation that the cells in the ganglion on the posterior root of a spinal nerve have to the nerve fibres. The central grey matter, which lies in relation to the third ven- tricle, forms the middle or soft commissure, and the well- defined grey layer which covers the inner wall of each optic thalamus. The grey masses situated at the base of the brain between and in front of the crura cerebri, viz., the pons Fig. 93.â€”Vertical transverse section through the Corpora Quadrigemina. A. aqueduct of Sylvius; p, peripheral mass of grey matter; c, central mass of grey matter; z, large nerve cells arranged as a zone around the circumference of the central mass; 0, 0, crus cerebelli transversely divided. At the right lower comer two cells of the zonular region are represented, highly magnified. Tarini, tuber cinereum, lamina cinerea, infundibulum, and the grey matter of the pituitary body, belong to the central grey matter. By some anatomists the grey matter of the pineal body is referred to the same category, but Arnold has pointed out that it is separated by its peduncle from the soft commissure ; and Meynert is disposed to regard it as a ganglion of origin of the tegmentum. Both the pituitary and pineal bodies contain, besides the nervous matter, structures of the type of the glands without ducts.

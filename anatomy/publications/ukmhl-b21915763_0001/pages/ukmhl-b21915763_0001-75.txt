CHAPTER II. JOINTS AND MUSCLES. h General Observations on the Articulatory and Muscular Systems. A Joint or Articulation is the junction or union of any two adjacent parts of the body. Most usually the term is employed to signify the connection established between contiguous bones. It is by the joints that the various bones are knit together to form the skeleton. Joints may be either immovable or movable. The immovable joints are divided into the synchondroses and the sutures. A synchondrosis is the junction of two bones by the interposition of an intermediate plate of cartilage; the fibrous membrane or periosteum which invests the bones being prolonged from one bone to the other over the surface of the cartilage. A suture is the connection of two bones by the interlock- ing of adjacent toothed margins; the peri- osteal fibrous membrane is prolonged from one bone to the other, and is also inter-fig. 12.—Vertical sec- posed between their adjacent margins.

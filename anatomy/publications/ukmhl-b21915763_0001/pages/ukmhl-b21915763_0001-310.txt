ANATOMY. 298 weights being 56 and 55 oz. in two cases of mania. The size and weight of the brain do not therefore, per se, give an exact method of estimating the intellectual power of the individual, and a high brain weight and great intellectual capacity are not necessarily correlated with each other. It seems certain, if the adult human brain, even amongst the most uncultivated peoples, falls below 30 oz., that this low weight is not merely incompatible with intellectual power and activity, but is invariably associated with idiocy or imbecility; so that the human brain has a minimum weight below which intellectual action is impossible. Amongst the more cultivated races the minimum weight-limit of intelli- gence is, however, in all probability higher than 30 oz. It has been placed by Broca at 32 oz. for the female, and 37 oz. for the male brain; and Thurnam’s numbers are almost the same. To how low a weight the brain in the microcepha- lous idiot may fall is well shown in a case recorded by Theile, where it weighed only 10'6 oz., in Gore’s case of 10 oz. 5 grs., and in Marshall’s case, 8J oz. But instances are not wanting in which the brains of idiots have exceeded even 50 oz. Langdon Down observed the brain of a male idiot aged 22, which weighed 59^ oz.; and J. B. Tuke has recently met with a brain of 60 oz. in a male idiot aged 37, the capacity of whose cranium was 110J cubic inches.- In the West Riding Asylum tables the brain weights in 10 idiots were not less than 34 oz., and in 5 cases exceeded 40 oz. As yet the opportunities of weighing the brain in the coloured races of men have been but scanty. But from a very extensive series of observations made by Barnard Davis, not on the brains themselves, but on the cubic capacities of crania, from which an approximate estimate of the brain

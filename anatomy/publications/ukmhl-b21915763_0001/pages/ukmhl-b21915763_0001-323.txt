311 ENCEPHALIC NEEVES. two small ganglia, which, like the ciliary and spheno-pala- tine ganglia, are of a greyish colour, contain nerve cells, and receive roots from motor, sensory, and sympathetic nerves. The submaxillary ganglion lies under cover of the mylo-hyoid muscle, and receives a root from the motor chorda tympani nerve, a root from the sensory lingual, and a sympathetic root. It gives branches to the sub-maxillary and sublingual salivary glands. The otic ganglion lies close to the Eustachian tube, and receives a root from the mus- cular nerve to the internal pterygoid, a root from the sensory auriculo-temporal, and a sympathetic root. It also receives the small petrosal nerve, by which it is connected to the knee-shaped bend of the portio dura and to the glosso-pharyngeal nerve. It supplies the tensor tympani and tensor palati muscles. The branches of the three divi- sions of the fifth cranial nerve, which pass to the skin of the temple, forehead, and face, freely communicate with the branches of the portio dura, which supply the muscles situated in those regions. The Glossopharyngeal or uppermost division of the eighth nerve springs out of the side of the medulla oblongata between the olivary and restiform bodies; its roots arise from two small masses or nuclei of grey matter in the floor of the 4th ventricle (Fig. 80). The nerve passes out of the skull through the jugular foramen, where it possesses two small ganglia, named jugular and petrous. It then passes across the side of the neck and gives off carotid branches, which run along the internal carotid artery; pharyngeal branches to the mucous membrane of the phaiynx; tonsil- itic branches to the tonsil and soft palate; glossal branches to the base of the tongue and the circumvallate

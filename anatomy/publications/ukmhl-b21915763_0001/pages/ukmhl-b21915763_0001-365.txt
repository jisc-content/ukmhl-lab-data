ACCESSORY PARTS TO THE EYEBALL. 353 between the lens and the retina, and forms the vitreous humour, and perhaps the capsule of the lens. This fissure then closes up so that the connection between the vitreous humour and the surrounding mesoblast is severed. The mesoblast immediately surrounding the optic vesicle then differentiates into the vascular and connective tissue structures of the choroid and ciliary processes; into the tissues of the iris and ciliary muscle, and into the sclerotic coat. The sclerotic is continuous in front with the meso- blast, out of which the cornea is formed, so as to complete the external tunic of the eyeball. Accessory Parts to the Eyeball. In relation to the eyeball several accessory parts are found. The Eye-Brows are projections of the integument, from which short, stiff hairs grow. The Eye-Lids, or palpebrce, are two movable curtains, an upper and a lower, which protect the front of the globe. Between each pair of lids is a horizontal fissure, the palpe- bral fissure. From the free margins of the two lids project short hairs, the eye-lashes or cilia; the upper set curve downwards and forwards, the lower set upwards and for- wards ; they also protect the front of the globe. Each eye- lid consists externally of skin, immediately beneath which are the fibres of the orbicidar sphincter muscle; a thin plate of fibro-cartilage, the tarsal cartilage, lies beneath the sphincter; to the inner end of this cartilage a fibrous band, the tendo palpebrarum, is attached, which springs from the ascending process of the superior maxilla; into the Z

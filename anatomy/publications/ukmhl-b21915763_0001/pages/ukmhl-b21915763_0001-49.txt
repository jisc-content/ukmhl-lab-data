APPENDICULAR SKELETON—UPPER LIMB. 37, distal part or hand, and an intermediate shaft, which con- sists of an upper arm or brachium, and a fore-arm or anti- braehium. In each of these subdivisions certain bones are found: in the shoulder, the clavicle and scapula; in the upper arm, the humerus ; in the fore-arm, the radius and ulna, the bone of the upper arm in man being longer than the bones of the fore-arm; in the hand, the carpal and metacarpal bones and the phalanges. The scapula and clavicle together form an imperfect bony arch, the Scapular Arch or Shoulder Girdle; the shaft and hand form a free divergent Appendage. The shoulder girdle is the direct medium of connection between the axial skeleton and the divergent part of the limb; its anterior segment, the clavicle, articulates with the upper end of the sternum, whilst its posterior segment, the scapula, approaches, but does not reach, the dorsal spines.

V, a Dorsal Vertebra; C, a Rib; St, the Sternum; Sc, the Scapula; Cr, the Coracoid; Cl, the Clavicle; M, the Meniscus at its sternal end; H, the Humerus. The Clavicle, or Collar Bone (Fig. 9), is an elongated bone which extends from the upper end of the sternum horizontally outwards, to articulate with the acromion process of the scapula. It presents a strong sigmoidal curve, which is associated with the transverse and horizontal direction of the axis of the human shoulder. It is slender v St M

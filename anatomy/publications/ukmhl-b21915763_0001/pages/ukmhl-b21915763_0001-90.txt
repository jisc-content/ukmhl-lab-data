78 ANATOMY. Costo-vertebral Joints are situated between the head of a rib and the body of one or more usually two adjacent vertebrae: in the latter case, an interarticular ligament passes from the head of the rib to the intervertebral disc and subdivides the joint into two parts. Except in the floating ribs, Costo-transverse joints exist between the tubercle of the rib and the transverse process of the vertebra. The joints are diarthrodial, and completed by ligaments and synovial membrane. The Costo-sternal Joints are also diar- throdial (except the first costal cartilage, which is directly united to the prae-sternum), a capsular ligament, lined by a synovial membrane, connecting the cartilages of the true ribs to the sternum. The cartilages of the sixth to the ninth ribs are also united together by ligamentous fibres. The movements of the ribs and sternum at the costo- vertebral and costo-sternal joints are of the utmost import- ance in the process of breathing. Breathing or respiration consists of two acts with intermediate pauses—breathing in, or inspiration, and breathing out, or expiration. During inspiration, the air rushes through the nose or mouth down the windpipe, and dilates the air-cells of the lungs; together with the expansion of the lungs the walls of the chest rise, so that the capacity both of lungs and chest at the end of a full inspiration is nearly doubled. During inspiration the following changes occur in the walls of the chest: the ribs are elevated and rotated outwards, the lower borders of their shafts are everted, while their surfaces are at the same time rendered more oblique, and the width of the intercostal spaces is thereby in- creased ■ the elevation and rotation of the ribs throw the sternum upwards and forwards, and make the thoracic

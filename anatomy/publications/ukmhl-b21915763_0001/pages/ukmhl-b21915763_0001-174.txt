ANATOMY. 162 tissue, whilst the fibres of the yellow fibro-cartilage partake of the nature of elastic tissue. The fibro-cartilages, there- fore, form a group which links together the connective and cartilaginous tissues. Osseous Tissue. The Osseous Tissue, or Bone, is that which constitutes the hard framework of the skeleton. Each bone consists of a hard, more or less dense, tough, and but slightly elastic mate- rial. The elasticity of the bones is more marked in young than in adult and aged persons. From differences in their external configuration, bones are divided into long or cylin- drical, e.g., femur; short, e.g., carpal or tarsal bones; flat or plate-like, e.g., scapula; irregular bones, e.g., vertebrae. These variations in shape do not, however, involve differ- ences either in composition or minute structure. Bone con- sists chemically of an earthy and an animal substance inti- mately blended together. The earthy matter forms about two-thirds, and consists chiefly of phosphate of lime, which, from its abundance in bone, is frequently called “bone earth.” Carbonate of lime and a small proportion of soda and magnesia salts are also present. The hardness of bone is due to the presence of the earthy matter. The animal matter forms the remaining third, and yields gelatine on boiling; it imparts elasticity and toughness to the bone, and binds together the particles of earthy matter. Bone presents two different structural characters to the naked eye. The outer part of a bone is its hardest part, and forms a dense external shell, technically called the.

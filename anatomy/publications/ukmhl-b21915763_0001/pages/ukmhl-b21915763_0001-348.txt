ANATOMY. 336 the inner side of, its centre by a circular aperture, the pupil, the size of which is regulated by the contraction or relaxation of the muscular tissue of the iris. The structure of the several divisions of the middle coat will now be considered. The Choroid coat has its inner or anterior surface formed by a distinct pigmentary layer of hexagonal pigment cells (Fig. 45). In the eyes of Albinos, though the cells are present, they contain no pigment. In many mammals also, the pigment is absent from the inner surface, so that the choroid possesses a beautiful iridescent lustre, the tapetum lucidum. In ruminant animals and in the horse the irides- cence is due to the reflection of the light by the bundles of the connective tissue stroma, but in cats and other carnivora the prismatic colours are due to the reflection of the light from polygonal nucleated cells, which Schultze states con- tain double refracting crystals. Next the inner pigmen- tary layer is the lamina vitrea, the elastic layer of Kolliker. It forms a translucent membrane, described by some as structureless, but by Kolliker as faintly fibrous, which is intimately connected with the stroma of the choroid. The stroma consists of a plexiform arrangement of bundles of connective tissue, in the intervals between which nume- rous stellate pigment cells are situated, which give to the entire thickness of the choroid its black appearance. This stroma connects the outer surface of the choroid with the inner surface of the sclerotic, and forms the lamina fusca. Ramifying in the stroma are the blood-vessels and nerves. The vessels of the choroid are arranged in two layers. Next the lamina vitrea is a plexiform capillary layer, the meshes of which are so minute, and the vessels so compacted to-

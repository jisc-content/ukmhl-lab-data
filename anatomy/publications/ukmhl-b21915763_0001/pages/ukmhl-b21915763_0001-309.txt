WEIGHT OF THE BRAIN. 297 the 3d to the 8th years by different authors; but it con- tinues to increase in weight to 25 or 30, or even 40. After 60 the brain begins to diminish in weight; in aged males the average weight is about 45 oz., in females about 41 oz. In some cases the adult brain considerably exceeds the average weight. The brains of several men distinguished for their intellectual attainments have been weighed : the brain of Cuvier weighed 64J oz.; of Dr Abercrombie, 63 oz.; of ‘Professor Goodsir, 57J oz.; of Spurzheim, 55 oz.; of Sir J. Y. Simpson, 54 oz.; of Agassiz, 53‘4 oz.; and of Dr Chalmers, 53 oz. But high brain weights have also been found where there was no evidence of great intellectual capacity. Peacock weighed four male brains which ranged from 62-75 to 61 oz.; Boyd, a specimen of 60‘75 oz.; and I have in my possession one of a boy aged fifteen which weighed 60 oz. In the brains of the insane high brain weights have also been observed. Bucknill met with a brain in a male epileptic which weighed 64J oz.; Thurnam, one which weighed 62 oz.; and in the West Biding Asylum, out of 375 males examined, the weight of the brain in 30 cases was 55 oz. or upwards, and the highest weights were 61 oz. in a case of senile dementia, 60 £ oz. in a case of dementia, and 60 oz. in one of melancholia. No case has as yet been recorded of the weightlof the brain in a woman of great intellectual attainments; but Boyd met with a woman’s brain as high as 55-25 oz., and many instances of upwards of 50 oz. in women where there was no evidence of high mental endowment. Skae, in a female monomaniac, observed a brain which weighed 61J oz.; and of 300 females examined in the West Riding Asylum the weight of the brain in 26 cases was 50 oz. or upwards, the highest

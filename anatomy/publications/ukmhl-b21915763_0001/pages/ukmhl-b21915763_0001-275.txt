Passing obliquely along the outer face of the hemi- sphere from before, upwards and backwards, is the well- marked Sylvian fissure, which is the first to appear in the development of the hemisphere. Below it lies the tem- poro-sphenoidal lobe, and above and in front of it, the parietal and frontal lobes. The frontal lobe is separated from the parietal by the fissure of Rolando, which extends on the outer face of the hemisphere from the longitudinal fissure obliquely downwards and forwards towards the Sylvian fissure. About two inches from the hinder end of the hemisphere is the parieto-occipital fissure, which, commencing at the longitudinal fissure, passes down the inner surface of the hemisphere, and also transversely out- wards for a short distance on the outer surface of the hemi- sphere; it separates the parietal and occipital lobes from each other. The Temporo-sphenoidal Lobe (Pigs. 84, 86) presents on the outer surface of the hemisphere three convolutions, arranged in parallel tiers from above downwards, and named superior, middle, and inferior temporo-sphenoidal convolutions. The fissure which separates the superior and middle of these convolutions is called the parallel fissure. The Occipital Lobe also consists from above downwards of three parallel convolutions, named superior, middle, and inferior occipital. The Frontal Lobe is more complex; immediately in front of the fissure of Rolando, and forming indeed its anterior boundary, is a convo- lution named ascending frontal, which ascends obliquely backwards and upwards from the Sylvian to the longi- tudinal fissure. Springing from the front of this con-

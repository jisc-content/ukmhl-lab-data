SYMPATHETIC NERVOUS SYSTEM. 313 branch, which traversing a small canal in the petrous tempo- ral bone, is distributed to the skin of the back of the auricle. The lower ganglion ' gives origin to—a, the pharyngeal branch, which forms a plexus with the glosso-pharyngeal and sympathetic nerves, from which the muscles of the pharynx are supplied; h, the superior laryngeal, which divides into an external branch to supply the crico-thyroid muscle, and an internal, which pierces the thyro-hyoid mem- brane, and supplies the mucous lining of the larynx and the mucous covering of the epiglottis. The trunk of the nerve gives origin to—a, the recurrent laryngeal branch, which on the right side turns round the subclavian artery, and on the left round the arch of the aorta, and ascends to the larynx to supply its intrinsic muscles except the crico-thyroid; b, cardiac branches, which arise from the nerve partly in the neck and partly in the chest, and join the great cardiac plexus for the heart; c, pulmonary branches, which arise in the chest, pass into the substance of the lungs, and form along with the sympathetic an anterior pulmonary plexus in front of, and a posterior pulmonary plexus behind the root of the lung; d, oesophageal branches, which supply the coats of the oesophagus; e, gastric branches, which supply the coats of the stomach, and give important off- shoots to the great solar plexus of the sympathetic situated at the pit of the stomach. Descriptive Anatomy of the Sympathetic Nervous System. The Sympathetic Nervous System consists of a pair of gangliated cords, situated one on each side of the spinal

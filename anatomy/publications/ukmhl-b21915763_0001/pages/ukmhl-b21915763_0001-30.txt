ANATOMY. 18 THORAX. The Thorax, Pectus, or Chest is a cavity or enclosure the walls of which are in part formed of hone and cartilage. Its skeleton consists of the sternum in front, the twelve dorsal vertebrae behind, and the twelve ribs, with their corresponding cartilages, on each side. The Sternum or Breast Bone is an elongated bone which inclines downwards and forwards in the front wall of the chest. It consists of three parts—an upper, called manubrium or prse-sternum • a middle, the body or meso- sternum; and a lower, the ensiform process or xiphi- sternum. Its anterior and posterior surfaces are marked by transverse lines, which indicate not only the subdivision of the entire bone into three parts, but that of the meso- sternum into four originally distinct segments. Each lateral border of the bone is marked by seven depressed surfaces for articulation with the seven upper ribs : at each side of the upper border of the prae-sternum is a sinuous depression, where the clavicle, a bone of the upper limb, articulates with this bone of the axial skeleton. . The xiphi-sternum remains cartilaginous up to a late period o life, and from its pointed form has been named the ensi- form cartilage. The Ribs or Cost®, twenty-four in number, twelve on each side of the thorax, consist not only of the bony ribs, but of a bar of cartilage continuous .with the anterior end of each bone, called a costal cartilage, so that they farms examples of a cartilaginous skeleton in the adult human body; in aged persons these cartilages usua y ecome converted into bone. The upper seven ribs are connected

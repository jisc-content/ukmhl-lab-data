THE BRAINâ€”CEREBRUM. 273 If a horizontal slice be removed from the upper part of each hemisphere, the peripheral grey matter of the convo- lutions will be seen to follow their various windings, whilst the core of each convolution consists of white matter con- tinuous with a mass of white matter in the interior of the hemisphere. If a deeper slice be now made down to the plane of the corpus callosum, the white matter of that structure will be seen to be continuous with the white centre of each hemisphere. The corpus callosum does not equal the hemispheres in length, but approaches nearer to their anterior than their posterior ends (Fig. 89). It terminates behind in a free rounded end, whilst in front it forms a knee-shaped bend, and passes downwards and backwards as far as the lamina cinerea. It is thicker behind than in front, whilst the middle part is the thinnest. If the dissection be performed on a brain which has been hardened in spirit, the corpus callosum is seen to consist of bundles of nerve fibres, almost the whole of which pass transversely across the mesial plane between the two hemispheres ] these fibres may be traced into the white cores and grey matter of the convolutions, and apparently connect the corresponding convolutions in the opposite hemispheres. Hence the corpus callosum is a connecting or commissural structure, which brings the convolutions of the two hemispheres into anatomical and physiological relation with each other. On the surface of the corpus callosum a few fibres, the stride longitudinales, run in the antero-posterior or longitudinal direction. If the corpus callosum be now cut through on each side of its mesial line, the large cavity or lateral ventricle in each hemisphere will be opened into. The lateral ventricle (Fig. 89) is subdivided into a central S

ANATOMY. 234 the intercostal muscles, the levatores costaram, and the triangulares sterni, whilst the lower intercostal nerves run forwards and downwards into the wall of the abdo- men, and supply the oblique, the transverse, the recti, and pyramidales muscles. The skin of the sides of the thorax and abdomen receives its nervous supply from the Lateral Cutaneous branches, whilst the skin on the front of the trunk is supplied by the Anterior Cutaneous terminations of these nerves. The lateral cutaneous branches of the second and third intercostal nerves are comparatively large in size, and assist in the supply of the skin of the inner side of the upper arm; hence they are called intercosto-humeral nerves. The first thoracic, usually called the first dorsal nerve, for the most part ascends into the neck, to aid in forming the brachial plexus; only a small branch, ex- tending along the intercostal space as the first intercostal nerve (Fig. 76, 1). The twelfth thoracic, usually called the twelfth dorsal nerve, runs along the lower border of the twelfth rib. In the regions of the neck, loins, and pelvis, the anterior divisions of the spinal nerves do not pass simply outwards to their distribution. In each region adjacent nerves in- terlace with each other, and form what is technically called a nervous plexus. When a branch arises from a thoracic nerve, it contains fibres derived from that nerve only} but when a branch arises from a plexus, it may contain fibres, not of one only, but of two or more of the nerves which, by their interlacement, form the plexus. Hence the parts which are supplied by these branches are brought into con- nection with a greater number of nerves, and consequently with a greater extent of the spinal cord oi uei\c centre,

ANATOMY. 256 'posterior medullary velum, whilst the layer of grey matter stretching between the uvula and tonsil on each side is called the furrowed band. The whole outer surface of the cerebellum possesses a characteristic foliated or laminated appearance, due to its subdivision into multitudes of thin plates or lamellae by numerous fissures. The cerebellum consists both of grey and white matter. The grey matter forms the exterior or cortex of the lamellae, and passes from one to the other across the bottom of the several fissures. The white matter lies in the interior of the organ, and extends into the core of each lamella. When a vertical section is made through the organ, the prolongations of white matter branching off into the interior of the several lamellae give to the section an arborescent appearance, known by the fanciful name of arbor vitce (Fig. 83). Independent masses of grey matter are, however, found in the interior of the cerebellum. If the hemisphere be cut through a little to the outer side of the median lobe, a zig-zag arrange- ment of grey matter, similar in appearance and structure to the nucleus of the olivary body in the medulla oblongata, and known as the corpus dentatum of the cerebellum, is seen; it lies in the midst of the white core of the hemi- sphere, and encloses white fibres, which leave the interior of the corpus at its inner and lower side. Stilling has de- scribed, in connection with the anterior end of the in- ferior vermiform process, which projects forwards into the valve of Vieussens, and aids in the formation of the roof of the 4th ventricle, two grey masses, named roof nuclei. They possess flask-shaped nerve cells like those of the corpus dentatum.

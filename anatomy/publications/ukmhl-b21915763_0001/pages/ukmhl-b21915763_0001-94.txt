82 ANATOMY. hyoid bone and larynx must be considered, for the digastrics, the genio- and mylo-hyoids, which, when their fixed ends are at the hyoid, depress the lower jaw, act, when their mandibular ends are fixed, along with the stylo-hyoid muscles in elevating the hyoid bone and larynx. These structures are depressed or drawn downwards by the action of the sterno-hyoids, sterno-thyroids, thyro-hyoids, and omo-hyoids. The elevation of the hyoid, when drawn down by its depressor muscles, is also effected by the elastic stylo-hyoid ligaments attached to its small cornua, which, by their recoil when the depressor muscles have ceased to contract, draw the bone up to its former position. Numerous muscles are situated immediately beneath the skin of the scalp and face. They are not of so deep red a colour as the muscles of the trunk and limbs, and whilst they arise from one or other of the bones of the head, they are inserted into the deep surface of the skin itself. Hence when they contract they move the skin of the scalp and face, and as they are the instruments through which the various passions and emotions are expressed, they are grouped together as the Muscles of Expression. The occipito- frontalis, or great muscle of the scalp, passes fiom the occipital bone over the vertex to the forehead; vhen it contracts, the skin of the forehead is wrinkled trans- versely, the eyebrows are elevated, and an expression of amazement or surprise is produced. Some persons have a greater power over this muscle than others, and by the altei - nate contraction of its occipital and frontal portions can move the hairy scalp to and fro with great rapidity. A paii of muscles, the corrugatores supercilii, arises from the supra- ciliary ridges, on the frontal bone, to be inserted into the

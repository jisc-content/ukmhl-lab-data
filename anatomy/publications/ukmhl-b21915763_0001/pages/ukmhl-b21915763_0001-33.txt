AXIAL SKELETON—HEAD. 21 The 8 bones of the cranium are so united together by their edges as to form the walls of a box or cavity, the cranial cavity, in which the brain is lodged. The box of the cranium possesses a base or floor, a vault or roof, an anterior, a posterior, and two lateral walls. The posterior wall is formed by the occipital bone, which also extends for some distance forwards along the middle of the base; in front of the basal part of the occipital is the sphenoid, which also sends a process upwards on each side of the Fig. 6—Profile of the skull.

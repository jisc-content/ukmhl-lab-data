ANATOMY. 64 which prevails in the bones of the head. In old persons the sutures become obliterated by the ossification of the intermediate fibrous membrane, and the bones are per- manently fused together. The cranial sutures may conveniently be arranged in three groups : Fig. 13.—Vertical section through Median longitudinal, COnsist- bo“! oppose tte iuture ™ °f th<3 fr0ntal Suture> which p?he Connects the two halves of the two bones, which plays the part j. . 1 r -i 1 of a ligament, and wuich is frontal bone, and the sagittal continuous with the interposed , , . ,, . . , fibrous membrane. suture, between the two parietal each consisting, on bones; b, Lateral longitudinal, side of the head, of the fronto-nasal, fronto-maxilla.ry, fronto-lachrymal, fronto-ethmoidal, fronto-malar, fronto- sphenoidal, parieto-sphenoidal, parieto-squamous, parieto- mastoid sutures; c, Vertical transverse, consisting of the coronal or fronto-parietal, the lambdoidal or parieto-occi- pital, the sphenoido-malar, sphenoido-squamous and occi- pito-mastoid sutures (fig. 6). As the skull grows by ossifica- tion of the cartilage of the base and the membranous vault, the direction of growth is perpendicular to the margins of the bones and the sutures and synchondroses which connect them together. The growth of the skull in length is per- pendicular, therefore, to the basi-cranial synchondrosis and the vertical transverse group of sutures; its growth, in breadth, to the median longitudinal group, and in height to the lateral longitudinal group. So long as any of the cartilage or membrane between the margins of the bones remains unossified, bone may continue to form, and the skull may increase in size. It sometimes happens that the cartilage or membrane is prematurely ossified in

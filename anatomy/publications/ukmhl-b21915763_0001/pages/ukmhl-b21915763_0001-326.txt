314 ANATOMY. column â–  of three great gangliated prevertebral plexuses situated in the thoracic and abdominal cavities ; of nume- rous smaller ganglia lying more especially in relation with the thoracic and abdominal viscera ; of multitudes of fine communicating and distributory nerves. Each Gangliated Cord of the sympathetic extends along the side of the spine from the base of the skull to the coccyx. In the neck it lies in front of the transverse processes of the vertebrae; in the thorax, in front of the heads of the ribs; in the abdomen, on the sides of the verte- bral bodies; and as it descends in front of the sacrum it approaches its fellow, so that in front of the coccyx the two are united in a single ganglion, the ganglion impar (Fig. 77/c). Each cord consists of a number of ganglia united into a continuous cord by intermediate nerves. As a rule, the ganglia equal in number the vertebrae of the region. Thus, in the sacral region there are five ganglia, in the lumbar five, and in the thorax twelve; but in the neck there are only three, named superior, middle, and inferior; of these the superior is very large, and represents without doubt several smaller ganglia. From the superior cervical ganglion the cord is prolonged upwards by an ascending or cranial offshoot through the carotid canal into the cranial cavity, and forms a plexus around the internal carotid artery,both in the carotid canal, named the carotid plexus, and in the inner wall of the cavernous sinus, named the cavernous plexus. Through branches derived either directly or indirectly from these plexuses the sympathetic roots for the ciliary and spheno-palatine ganglia, described in connection with the fifth nerve, are derived. From the gangliated cord and its ascending or cranial

AXIAL SKELETONâ€”HEAD. 27 in the toothed whales, where there are no olfactory nerves, the turbinals are absent, whilst in some mammals, as the crested seal, they assume a highly convoluted form. The lateral masses are hollowed out into air-sinuses, called eth- moidal cells, which communicate with the nostrils and with corresponding sinuses in the sphenoid and frontal bones. The Frontal, or bone of the Forehead (Figs. 6 and 7), consists originally of a right and left lateral half, united by the frontal suture in the middle line of the forehead. As a rule, this suture disappears in early life, and a single greatly curved bone is formed. The bone is convex for- wards, to form the rounded forehead, and presents two eminences, the centres of ossification of the bone ; at the root of the nose is an elevation called glabella, extending outwards, from which, on each side, is the supra-ciliary ridge, corresponding to the position of the eyebrow. In the crania of some races, e.g., the Australian, the forward projection of the glabella and supra-ciliary ridges is con- siderable ; and in the well-known skull from the valley of the Neander it has reached a remarkable size. These ridges and the glabella mark the position of the air-sinuses in the frontal bone. The upper border of each orbit, which ends internally and externally in a process of bone called angular, forms the lower boundary of the forehead. The cerebral surface of the bone is deeply concave, for the reception of the frontal lobes of the brain ; the concavity is deepened by the backward projection of two thin plates of bone which form the roofs of the orbits, which plates are separated from each other by the deep notch in which the ethmoid bone is lodged ; along the margins of this notch may be seen the openings into the frontal air-sinuses.

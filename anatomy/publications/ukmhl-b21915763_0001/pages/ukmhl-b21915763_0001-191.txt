179 MUSCULAR TISSUE. other by a delicate, areolar connective tissue, or perimysium. The size of the fasciculi varies in different localities; in the hollow viscera they are so large that their arrangement can be observed with the naked eye; but in the skin, the walls of gland- ducts, &c., they can only be seen with the aid of the microscope. If a fasciculus be carefully torn up with needles it can be resolved into its constituent fibres, and the number of the fibres varies with the size of the fasciculus. The non-striped fibres are pale and almost colourless, with soft, ill-defined outlines, from g-gU^th to Woo111 inch in diameter; they are rounded Fl& 5g_A( afasci_ in form or laterally compressed, and are so musc^aTflbre-PBd easily flattened by artificial pressure, that far fibreceil more they have erroneously been regarded as flat hlghly maenifled- or ribbon-shaped fibres. When digested for a few hours in dilute nitric or hydrochloric acid, and sometimes even without any reagent, the fibres may be resolved into elon- gated fusiform cells—the contractile fibro-cells of Kolliker —which vary in length from ^th to ^tli inch, and which taper off usually into attenuated ends. In the middle of each cell is a characteristically elongated, rod- shaped nucleus, and sometimes the substance of the cell is finely granular, or even faintly longitudinally striped. No cell wall or sarcolemma can be distinguished. In some localities, as was pointed out by Lister in the minute arteries in the web of the frog’s foot, isolated contractile fibro-cells are wound spirally around the wall of the vessel. The cell substance refracts light doubly. i

354 ANATOMY. cartilage in tlie upper eye-lid the tendon of the levator palpebrse superioris is inserted. Lining the inner surface of the eye-lid is the conjunctiva. Between the conjunctiva and the tarsal cartilage is a layer of glands, the Meibomian glands; each gland consists of a short duct, which expands at its sides into small sacculi. The sacculi contain short columnar cells; these secrete a sebaceous material, which escapes through the orifice of the duct at the border of the eye-lid, and by greasing the edge of the eye-lid prevents the overflow of the tears, except when lachrymation is profuse. The Conjunctiva is a mucous membrane, which forms the posterior layer of the eye-lid, and is reflected on to the anterior part of the sclerotic. At the inner angle of junc- tion of the eye-lids is a soft reddish elevation of the conjunctiva, the caruncula laclirymalis, and immediately external to it is a vertical fold, the plica semilunaris, the rudiment of the third eye-lid, or membrana nictitans, so well developed in birds. The palpebral conjunctiva has small papilhe scattered over its surface; its epithelium is stratified, with scaly cells on the free surface and elongated cells in the deepest layer. In the sub-epithelial tissue are small branched mucous glands, which are numerous in the caruncula. Little masses of adenoid tissue (p. 144) with lymphatic vessels are also found in it, and the conjunctiva of the front of the eyeball is thinner than the palpebral part. It is not glandular, and its nerves terminate in end-bulbs (p. 205). The palpebral conjunctiva, and in part that of the eyeball, receive their blood-vessels from those of the eye-lids, but the portion of the conjunctiva next the cornea is supplied by the arteries of the sclerotic coat. The Lachrymal Apparatus is engaged in the secretion

158 ANATOMY. irregularly grouped together. The cell contents are dimly granular, with a well-defined nucleus containing a nucleo- lus. Not unfrequently two or more nuclei are present in a cell; and in old cartilage the contents are often coarsely granular, or even infiltrated with drops of oil. Heidenhain has shown that powerful induction shocks cause contraction of the protoplasm of the cells towards the central nucleus. The cells lie in cavities in the matrix substance, and the part of the matrix which forms the immediate wall of the hollow is named the capsule of the cell. Two or more cells may sometimes lie in the same hollow. The matrix of hyaline cartilage is usually homogeneous. In some animals the matrix appears to have a concentric arrangement around the cells; and Rollett has stated that by the use of dilute sulphuric acid or chromic acid the matrix may be made to split up into concentric layers. Sometimes the matrix appears granulated, a change which is very apt to occur in sections of cartilage which ha\e been removed for some tune from the body. In the costal cartilages of old persons the matrix becomes fibrous; and it is by no means uncommon to find in advanced age these bars of cartilage converted into bone. In the articular or encrustiug cartilages the arrangement of the cells is quite distinctive. If a vertical section be made through a plate of this cartilage, the cells next the bone are seen to be arranged in parallel rows perpendicular to the surface of the bone on which the cartilage rests; the cells are smaller than those of the costal caitilage, oblong in form, and the adjacent rows are separated by intermediate hyaline matrix.

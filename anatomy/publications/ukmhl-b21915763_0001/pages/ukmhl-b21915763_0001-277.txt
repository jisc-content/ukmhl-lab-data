THE. BRAIN—CEREBRUM. 265 ' Fig. 85. Figs. 84 and 85.—Profile and vertex Hews of Cerebrum. Fr, the frontal lobe; Par, parietal; Oc, occipital; Ts, temporo-sphenoidal lobe; SS, Sylvian fissure; P.R, fissnre.of Eolando; PO, parieto-occipital fissure; IP, intra-parietal fissure; PP, -Parallel fissure; SF and IF, supero-and infero-frontal fissures; 1, 1, 1, inferior, 2, 2, 2, middle, and 3, 3, 3, superior frontal convolutions; 4,’ 4’ ascending frontal convolution; 5, 5, 5, ascending parietal, 5', postero-parietal! and 6, 6, angular convolutions; A, supra-marginal, or convolution of the parietal eminence; 7, 7, superior, 8, 8, 8, middle, and 9, 9, 9, inferior temporo- sphenoidal convolutions; 10, superior, 11, middle, and 12, inferior occipital convolutions; a, (3, y, 8, four annectent convolutions. Continuous with, the convolution of the parietal eminence is the angular convolution, which bends round the posterior extremity of the Sylvian fissure. Lying in the parietal lobe is the intra-parietal fissure, which separates the convolution of the parietal eminence from the postero-parietal con- volution. The occipital is connected with the parietal lobe by two annectent or bridging gyri, which bridge across the

32 ANATOMY. the other. It articulates above with the under surface of the body of the sphenoid and the mes-ethmoid; below with the palatal processes of the superior maxillae and palate-bones ; in front with the septal cartilage of the nose, whilst the posterior border is free, and forms the hinder edge of the nasal septum. The Inferior Turbinated is a slightly convoluted bone situated on the outer wall of the nose, where it articulates with the superior maxilla and palate a little below the middle turbinal of the ethmoid. The Lachrymal (Fig. 6) is a small scale-like bone, in shape not unlike a finger-nail, placed at the inner wall of the orbit, and fitting between the ethmoid, superior maxilla, and frontal bones. It has a groove on the outer surface, in which is lodged the lachrymal sac. The Nasal (Fig. 6) is a thin, somewhat elongated bone, which, articulating with its fellow in the middle line, forms with it the bony bridge of the nose; above, it articulates with the frontal, and by its outer border with the ascending process of the superior maxilla. The Malar bone (Fig. 6), irregular in shape, forms the prominence of the cheek, and completes the outer wall of the orbit. It rests upon the superior maxilla; by its orbital plate it articulates with the great wing of the sphenoid; by its ascending process with the external angular process of the frontal; by its posterior process with the zygomatic process of the temporal, so as to complete the zygomatic arch. The Inferior Maxilla, Lower Jaw, or Mandible (Figs. C> and 7), is a large horse-shoe shaped bone, which has the distinction of being the only movable bone of the

This Introduction to Human Anatomy was prepared as the Article “ Anatomy ” for the Ninth Edition of the “ Encyclopsedia Britannica,” now in course of publication. It has no pretence to he an exhaustive treatise on the subject, and in writing it, my object has been to give an exposition of the principles on which the human body is constructed, rather than to put before the reader a detailed description of the several organs. At the suggestion of the publishers it has been reproduced in a separate volume. The illustrations, except when otherwise stated in the text, are original. The figures of the dissected parts are chiefly from drawings by my friend Dr W. M. Banks. The drawings of microscopic struc- tures are, with a few exceptions, by J. C.. Ewart, M.B., and by Mr C. Berjeau, for the most part from specimens prepared expressly for me by my assistant, Mr A. B. Stirling. For the use of the woodcuts, in illustration of Dr Thin’s observations, I am indebted to that gentleman, and to the publishers of the Edinburgh Medical Journal.Digitized by the Internet Archive in 2016 https://archive.org/details/b21915763_0001CONTENTS.

Anatomy (’Avaro/j-rj) means in its literal sense the dis- section or separation of parts by cutting, but in its usual acceptation it is employed to denote the science the province of which is to determine the construction, the form, and the structure of organised bodies, i.e., of bodies which either are or have been living. It is therefore a depart- ment of the science of Biology. It resolves itself into two great divisions—Animal Anatomy or Zootomy, the object of which is to investigate the structure of animals; and Vegetable Anatomy or Phytotomy, the object of which is to elucidate the structure of plants. Animal Ana- tomy, again, naturally resolves itself into two divisions: one in which the construction, form, and structure of two or more animals are compared with each other, so as to bring out their features of resemblance or dissimilarity,—this is called Comparative Anatomy; the other, in which the construction, form, and structure of parts in a single ani- mal are considered, which is termed Special Anatomy. The special anatomy of an animal may be studied from AANATOMY. o various points of views: (a) with reference to the succession of forms which it exhibits at various periods from its first appearance as an embryo to the assumption of its adult characters: this is termed Developmental or Embryo- logical Anatomy; (b) with reference either to its form and structure, or to the investigation of the laws by which these are determined, termed Morphological Anatomy ; (c) with reference to the function, use, or purpose per- formed by a part or structure in an animal, termed Teleological or Physiological Anatomy; (d) with re- ference merely to the relative position of different parts or structures, termed Topographical Anatomy; (e) with reference to the structure and general properties of the tissues or textures which enter into the construction of the parts or organs of animals; to this branch of study ha\ e been applied the terms General Anatomy, Anatomy of Textures, Histology and, from the miscroscope being so largely employed in the examination of the textures, Microscopic or Minute Anatomy; (f) with reference to the changes induced by disease in the organs or tissues, termed Morbid or Pathological Anatomy. From its manifold aspects Anatomy forms the basis of the Biological Sciences. As a knowledge of the laws of motion is essen- tial, and must be constantly recurred to at every step before any true progress can be made in the investigation of the physical sciences, so must the structure of animal bodies be constantly appealed to by the zoologist in all attempts at classification; by the physiologist in all in- quiries into the functions performed by the organs and textures in a state of health, and into the special adapta- tion of parts to particular uses; and by the physician inINTRODUCTION. 3 considering the alterations or disturbance of the functions of parts in the course of disease. To describe the anatomy of the multitudinous forms of animal life from these dif- ferent points of view would require, mot one, but several voluminous treatises, and would much exceed the compass of this volume, which is intended to be devoted more particularly to the description of the Special Anatomy of the Human Body in a state of health; in other words, to be a short treatise on Human Anatomy or Anturopotomy. As forming a department of the general science of Com- parative Anatomy, the anatomy of Man is interesting not only to men of science generally, but, from its intimate con- nection with the several divisions of the art of healing, and with the study of the functions of the human body, possesses the highest importance to the physician, surgeon, and physiologist. .'•j 1 • SPECIAL ANATOMY OP THE HUMAN BODY. Man, zoologically speaking, belongs to the Mammalian class of the Vertebrate sub-kingdom, i.e., his young are brought forth alive, and nourished during infancy on milk secreted in mammary or milk-forming glands. In common with all vertebrate organisms, he possesses a spine or verte- bral column and a skull, in which are contained the brain and the spinal marrow, and on the ventral surface of the spinal column are situated the several subdivisions of the alimentary canal. But man possesses certain special or distinctive anatomi- cal characters. The most noticeable, as seen on an external inspection of his body, is his erect position. He is,ANATOMY. 4 'indeed, the only living creature that can walk or stand erect, i.e., with the axis of the spine vertical; with the hip and knee joints capable of being fully extended, so that the leg is brought into line with the thigh; with the foot so planted on the ground that it rests on the heel behind and on the roots of the toes in front; with the upper limbs so arranged as to act, not as instruments of progression, but of prehension; and with the head so balanced on the top of the spine that the face and eyes look directly to the front. His bones, joints, and muscles are constructed and arranged so as to enable him to preserve the erect attitude without fatigue. In other vertebrata the axis of the spine is oblique or horizontal, the hip and knee joints are perma- nently bent at a more or less acute angle, the limbs, corresponding to the human upper extremities, are, in the F,5»TS;”r,™ form of legs, wings, or fins, instrn- £S “3 .‘S3a.,Moments of progression, and the head is articulated with the spine at or the uactt.n'TUc'niai3cnt- nea the hinder end of the skull. rrS’SCSKS Owing to the oblique or horizontal aotied line v re]iresems attitude of the body in the vertebiata the vertical axis of the „ • trunk. generally, and its erect position in man, the terms which are employed m describing the5 INTRODUCTION. relative position of different parts are not used in the same sense by the human and comparative anatomist. Thus, parts which are superior, or above other parts, the human body, are an- terior, or in front, in other vertebrata; and parts which are pos- terior, Or behind Other FlG' ?ulline diaSrnm of a quadruped; the • ?XIt 0f * . sPine is almost at right angles parts in man, are superior t0 vert‘ca* dotted line. (After Goodsir.) to them in other vertebrata. To obviate the confusion which must necessarily arise when comparing the human body with that of other vertebrates, certain descriptive line. (After' Goodsir.) Fig. 4.—Outline diagram of a monkey in the semi - erect position. The axis of the spine lies obliquely to the vertical dotted line. (After Goodsir.) terms have been recommended which may be employed whether the position of the body be erect or non-erect. Thus, the aspect of parts directed towards the regionANATOMY. ■where the atlas of first vertebra is situated is atlantal, that directed towards the sacrum is sacral, that towards the back is dorsal, that towards the front is ventral or hcemal. Quite recently the term prce-axial has been introduced as equivalent to atlantal, and post-axial to sacral. The body may be considered as divided by an imaginary plane, the mesial plane, into two lateral- and similar halves, a right and left, so that it exhibits a bilateral symmetry; and the constituent parts are described as being external or internal to each other, according to their relative position to this plane. For descriptive purposes, also, we may subdivide the body into Axial and Appendicular portions. The Axial part is the stock or stem of the body, and consists of the Head, the Neck, and the Trunk. The trunk is again subdivided into the chest or Thorax, and the belly or Abdomen; and the abdomen is again sub- divided into the abdomen proper and the Pelvis. The axial part contains the organs essential to the preservation of life. In the head is lodged the brain, from which the spinal marrow is prolonged down the spinal canal. At the sides of the head are the ears, and opening on to the face are the eyes, nostrils, and mouth. Prolonged down the neck are the gullet and windpipe, with the latter of which is associated the organ, of voice. Within the chest lie the heart, lungs, and gullet; and in the abdomen are contained the stomach, intestine, liver, spleen, pancreas, kidneys, an other organs concerned in the urinary and generative functions. The Appendicular part forms the limbs, wine do not contain organs essential to life. In man the hmbs are called Upper and Lower—the former are instruments of prehension, the latter of progression. The subdivisions7 INTRODUCTION. of the body are not homogeneous in structure, but are built up of several systems of organs, each system being charac- terised not only by peculiarities in form, appearance, and structure, but by possessing special functions and uses. Thus the bones collectively form the Osseous system; the joints the Articulatory system; the muscles, which move the bones at the joints, the Muscular system; and these several systems collectively constitute the! organs of Locomotion. The brain, spinal marrow, sympathetic ganglia, and nerves, form the Nervous system, with which is intimately asso- ciated the organs of Sense; the blood and lymph vessels, the Vascular system; the lungs and windpipe, the Respira- tory system; the alimentary canal, with the glands opening into it, the Digestive system; the kidneys, bladder, and urethra, the Urinary system; the testicles, spermatic ducts, and penis in the male, with the ovaries, uterus, and clitoris in the female, the Generative or Reproductive system; the skin, with the hair and nails, the Tegumentary system- These various systems are so arranged with reference to each other as to form an organic whole. « . • f c* . The Organs of Locomotion will first attract our attention.CHAPTER I. SKELETON. Osseous System—Osteology—Skeleton.—The word Skeleton (from o-kcAAg), to dry) signifies literally the dry or hard parts of the body. When used in a limited sense it is applied merely to the bones, but when used in a wider and more philosophic sense it comprises not only the bones or osseous skeleton, but the cartilages and fibrous mem- branes which complete the framework of the body. The first evidence of a skeleton in the embryo is the appear- ance of membranes in many parts of which cartilage is developed, and in course of time this cartilage is converted into bone. In some animals, however, as in the cartila- ginous fish, the osseous conversion does not take place, and the skeleton remains permanently cartilaginous; and in the very remarkable fish called Lancelet, or Ainphi- oxus, the skeleton consists almost entirely of fibrous mem- brane. The skeleton serves as a basis of support for the soft parts, as affording surfaces of attachment for muscles and as a protection for many delicate organs. In the verte. brata the osseous skeleton is clothed by the muscles and skin, and is technically called an endo-skeleton. In inverte- brate the skeleton is not unfrequently on the surface of theSKELETON. ' 9 body, and is termed an exo- or dermo-skeleton. In some vertebrates (e.g., the armadillo, tortoise, and sturgeon), in addition to the proper endo-skeleton, skeletal plates are developed in connection with the integument, so that they possess a dermo-skeleton likewise. In some vertebrates, also, a partial skeleton is formed within the substance of some of the viscera—e.g., in ruminant animals a bone is situated in the heart; in the walrus and other carnivora, in rodents, bats, and some monkeys, a bone lies in the penisand in the leopard, jackal, and other carnivora, a cartilaginous style lies in the middle of the tongue. These parts form a splanchno- or visceral skeleton. By some anatomists the teeth, which are unquestionably hard parts of the body, are also referred to the splanchno-skeleton, though they are special modifications of the mucous mem- brane of the gum. In man, the teeth being escluded, there is neither exo- nor splanchno-skeleton, but only an endo-skeleton. In each of the great subdivisions of the body an endo- skeleton exists, so that we may speak of an Axial Skeleton and an Appendicular Skeleton. The Axial Skeleton con- sists of the bones of the spine and head, the ribs, and the breastbone; the Appendicular Skeleton, of the bones of the limbs. The number of bones in the skeleton varies at different periods of life. In the adult there are about 200, but in the child they are more numerous; for in the pro- cess of consolidation of the skeleton certain bones originally distinct become fused together.ao . ANATOMY. Axial Skeleton. spine. We shall commence the description of the Axial Skele- ton by giving an account of the bones of the spine. The Spine, Spinal or Vertebral Column, chine, or backbone, consists of a number of superimposed bones which are named Verte- brae, because they can move or turn somewhat on each other. It lies in the middle of the back of the neck and trunk ; has the cranium at its summit; the ribs at its sides, which in their turn support the upper limbs) whilst the pelvis, with the lower limbs, is jointed to its lower end. The spine consists in an adult of twenty- six bones, in a young child of thirty-three, certain of the bones in the spine of the child becoming ankylosed Fio. 6.—The Axial skeleton. cr, the 0r blended with each other cervical vertebra:; D„, the dorsal; . lilpnded L the lumbar; S5, the sacral; Coc«, ln the adult. lliese Dienaeu the coccygeal; CC, the series of twelve _ , » .i», j ribsonone side; Ps, theprrc-stcrmim; pones lose their mobility, ana Ms. the meso-sternum; Xs, the xipni- ^ sternum.

In the vertebrata the bones of the spine are arranged in groups, which may be named from their position—vertebrae of the neck or cervical; of, the chest, dorsal or thoracic; of the loins, lumbar; of the pelvis, sacral; and of the tail, coccygeal or caudal; and the number of vertebrae in each group may be expressed in a formula. In man the formula is as follows:— C7Di2L5S5Coc4 = 33 bones, as seen in the child; but the five sacral vertebrae fuse together into a single bone—the sacrum—and the four coccygeal into the single coccyx. Hence the sacrum and coccyx of the adult are the false, whilst the lumbar, dorsal, and cervical are the true vertebrae. The vertebrae are irregularly-shaped bones, but as a rule have certain characters in common. Each possesses a body and an arch, which enclose a ring, with certain pro- cesses and notches. The Body, or Centrum, is a short Cylinder, which by its upper and lower surfaces is con- nected by means of fibro-cartilage with the bodies of the vertebrae immediately above and below. The collective series of vertebral bodies forms the great column of the spine. The Arch, also called Neural Arch, because it en- closes the spinal marrow or nervous axis, springs from the back of the body, and consists of two symmetrical halves united behind in the middle line. Each half consists of an anterior part or pedicle, and a posterior part or lamina. The Rings collectively form the spinal canal. The Pro* cesses usually spring from the arch. The spinous process projects backwards from the junction of the two laminae, and the collective series of these processes gives to the12 ANATOMY. entire column the spiny character from which has arisen the term Spine, applied to it. The transverse processes project outwards, one from each side of the arch. The articular processes project, two upwards and two downwards, and are for connecting adjacent vertebrae together. The Notches, situated on the upper and lower borders of the pedicles, form in the articulated spine the intervertebral foramina through which the nerves pass out of the spinal canal. The vertebrae in each group have characters which specially distinguish them. In man and all mammals, with few exceptions, whatever be the length of the neck, the Cervical Vertebrae are seven in number. The excep- tions are the three-toed sloth, which has nine, and Hoff- mann’s sloth and the manatee, in which there are only six. In many whales the seven cervicals are fused in the adult into a single bone. In man the body of a cervical vertebra is comparatively small, and its upper surface is transversely concave; the arch has long and obliquely sloping laminae; the x’ing is large and triangular; the spine is short, bifid, and horizontal; the transverse process consists of two bars of bone, the anterior springing from the side of the body, the posterior from the arch, and uniting externally to enclose a foramen, through which, as a rule, the vertebral artery passes; the articular processes are flat and oblique, and the upper pair of notches are deeper than the lower. The first, second, and seventh cervical vertebrae have characters:which specially distinguish them. The first, or Atlas, has no body or spine : its ring is very large, and on each side of the ring is a thick mass of bone, the lateral mass, by which it articulates with the occipital bone above13 AXIAL SKELETON—SPINE. and the second vertebra below. The second vertebra, Axis, or Vertebra dentata, has its body surmounted by a thick tooth-like odontoid process, which is regarded as the body of the atlas displaced from its proper vertebra and fused with the axis. This process forms a pivot round which the atlas and head move in turning the head from one side to the other; the spine is large, thick, and deeply bifid. The seventh, called Vertebra prominens, is distinguished by its long prominent spine, which is not bifid, and by the small size of the foramen at the root of the transverse process. In the human spine the distinguishing character of all the cervical vertebrae is the foramen at the root of the transverse process, but amongst mammals this is not an invariable character, for in the cetacea the transverse process of the atlas is imperforate, and in the horse, ruminants, and many quadrumana, the seventh cervical vertebra has no foramen at the root of its transverse process. The Dorsal Vertebrae, more appropriately called costal or thoracic, are twelve in number in the human spine; but amongst mammals they range from eleven in the arma- dillo to twenty-two in the Cape hyrax and Hoffmann’s sloth. They are intermediate in size and position to the cervical and lumbar vertebrae, and are all distinguished by having one or two smooth surfaces on each side of the body for articulation with the head of one or two ribs. The arch is short and with imbricated laminae; the ring is nearly circular; the spine is oblique, elongated, and bayonet-shaped ; the transverse processes are directed back and out, not bifid, and with an articular surface in front for the tubercle of a rib; and the articular processes14 ANATOMY. are flat and nearly vertical. The first, twelfth, eleventh, tenth, and sometimes the ninth, dorsal vertebrae are dis- tinguished from the rest. The first is in shape like the seventh cervical, but has no foramen at the root of the transverse process, and has two articular facets on each side of the body ; the ninth has sometimes only one facet at the side of the body; the tenth, eleventh, and twelfth have invariably only a single facet on the side of the body, but the eleventh and twelfth have stunted transverse processes, and the twelfth has its lower articular processes shaped like those of a lumbar vertebra. The Lumbar Vertebrae in man are five in number, but amongst mammals they range from two in the platypus to eight in the hyrax or agouti. They are the lowest of the true vertebrae, and also the largest, especially in the body. The arch has short and deep laminae; the ring is triangular; the spine is massive and hatchet-shaped; the transverse processes are long and pointed; the articular are thick and strong, the superior pair concave, the inferior con- vex ; the inferior notches, as in the dorsal vertebrae, are deeper than the superior. In the lumbar vertebrae and in the lower dorsal an accessory process projects from the base of each transverse process, and a mammillary tubercle from each superior articular process. In man these are small and rudimentary; but in some mammals, as the kangaroo, armadillo, and scaly ant-eater, the mammillary tubercles are large, and in the baboon, dog, cat, and beaier, the accessory processes are well developed. The fifth lumbar vertebra has its body much thicker in front than behind; its spine is less massive, and its lower articular processes are fiat.15 AXIAL SKELETON—SPINE. The Sacrum is composed of fivO originally separate vertebrae fused into a single bone. In the bandicoot it consists of a single vertebra, whilst it has as many as eight in the armadillo. The relative size and completeness of the sacrum are associated with the development of the haunch bones and of the lower limbs. In whales, where the pelvic bones are rudimentary and there are ho hind limbs, there is no sacrum. The sacrum forms the posterior wall of the pelvis, is triangular in form, and possesses two surfaces, two borders, a base, and an apex. The anterior or pelvic surface is concave, and is marked by four transverse lines, which indicate its original subdivision into five bones, and by four pairs of foramina, through which are transmitted the anterior sacral nerves. Its posterior surface is convex; in the middle line are tubercles or rudimentary spines, and on each side of these are two rows of tubercles, the inner of which are the conjoined articular and mammillary pro- cesses, the outer the transverse processes of the originally distinct vertebrae ; in addition, four pairs of foramina are found which transmit the posterior sacral nerves from the sacral canal, which extends through the bone from base to apex, and forms the lower end of the spinal canal. By its borders the sacrum is articulated with the haunch-bones— by its base with the last lumbar vertebra, by its apex with the coccyx. The human sacrum is broader in proportion to its length than in other mammals; this great breadth gives solidity to the lower part of the spine, and, conjoined with the size of the lateral articular surfaces, it permits a more perfect junction with the haunch-bones, and is correlated with the erect position. Owing to the need in woman for a wide pelvis, the sacrum is broader than in man.ANATOMY. 16 The Coccyx consists of only four vertebrae in the human spine. It is the rudimentary tail, but instead of projecting back, as in mammals generally, is curved forwards, and is not visible externally, an arrangement which is also found in the anthropoid apes and in Hoffmann’s sloth. In the spider monkeys as many as thirty-three vertebrae are found in the tail, and in the long-tailed pangolin the number reaches forty-six. Not only is the tail itself rudimentary in man, but the vertebrae of which it is composed are small, and represent merely the bodies of the true vertebrae. As there are no arches, the ring is not formed, and the spinal canal does not extend, therefore, beyond the apex of the sacrum. The first coccygeal vertebra, in addition to a body, possesses two processes or horns, which are jointed with two corresponding processes from the last sacral vertebra. The Human Spine is more uniform in length in persons of the same race than might be supposed from the indi- vidual differences in stature, the variation m the height of the body in adults being due chiefly to differences in the length of the lower limbs. The average length of the spine is 28 inches; its widest part is at the base of the sacrum, from which it tapers down to the tip of the coccyx. It diminishes also in breadth from the base of the sacrum upwards to the region of the neck. Owing to the pro- jection of the spines behind and the transverse processes on each side, it presents an irregular outline on those aspects; but in front it is more uniformly rounded, owing to the convex form of the antero-lateral surfaces of the bodies of its respective vertebra. In its general contour two series of curves may be seen, an antero-postenor andAXIAL SKELETON—SPINE. 17 a lateral. The antero-posterior is the more important. In the infant at the time of birth the sacro-coccygeal part of the spine is concave forwards, but the rest of the spine, except a slight forward concavity in the series of dorsal vertebrae, is almost straight. When the infant begins to sit up in the arms of its nurse, a convexity for- wards in the region of the neck appears, and subsequently, as the child learns to walk, a convexity forwards in the region of the loins. Hence in the adult spine a series of convexo-concave curves are found, which are alternate and mutually dependent, and are associated with the erect attitude of man. In the human spine alone are the lumbar vertebrae convex forward. A lateral curve, convex to the right, opposite the third, fourth, and fifth dorsal vertebrae, with compensatory curve convex to the left immediately above and below, is due apparently to the much greater use of the muscles of the right arm over those of the left, drawing the spine in that region some- what to the right. In disease of the spine its natural curvatures are much increased, and the deformity known as humpback is produced. As the spine forms the central part of the axial skeleton, .it acts as a column to support not only the weight of the body, but of all that can be carried on the head, back, and in the upper limbs : by its transverse and spinous processes it serves also to give attachment to numerous muscles, and the transverse pro- cesses of its dorsal vertebra are also for articulation with the ribs. BANATOMY. 18 THORAX. The Thorax, Pectus, or Chest is a cavity or enclosure the walls of which are in part formed of hone and cartilage. Its skeleton consists of the sternum in front, the twelve dorsal vertebrae behind, and the twelve ribs, with their corresponding cartilages, on each side. The Sternum or Breast Bone is an elongated bone which inclines downwards and forwards in the front wall of the chest. It consists of three parts—an upper, called manubrium or prse-sternum • a middle, the body or meso- sternum; and a lower, the ensiform process or xiphi- sternum. Its anterior and posterior surfaces are marked by transverse lines, which indicate not only the subdivision of the entire bone into three parts, but that of the meso- sternum into four originally distinct segments. Each lateral border of the bone is marked by seven depressed surfaces for articulation with the seven upper ribs : at each side of the upper border of the prae-sternum is a sinuous depression, where the clavicle, a bone of the upper limb, articulates with this bone of the axial skeleton. . The xiphi-sternum remains cartilaginous up to a late period o life, and from its pointed form has been named the ensi- form cartilage. The Ribs or Cost®, twenty-four in number, twelve on each side of the thorax, consist not only of the bony ribs, but of a bar of cartilage continuous .with the anterior end of each bone, called a costal cartilage, so that they farms examples of a cartilaginous skeleton in the adult human body; in aged persons these cartilages usua y ecome converted into bone. The upper seven ribs are connected19 AXIAL SKELETON—THORAX. by their costal cartilages to the side of the sternum, and are called sternal or true ribs; the lower five do not reach the sternum, and are named a-sterndl or false, and of these the two lowest, from being unattached in front, are called free or floating. All the ribs are articulated behind to the dorsal vertebrae, and as they are sym- metrical on the two sides of the body, the ribs in any given animal are always twice as numerous as the dorsal vertebrae in that animal. They form a series of osseo- cartilaginous arches, which extend more or less perfectly around the sides of the chest. A rib is an elongated bone, and as a rule possesses a head, a neck, a tubercle, and a shaft. The head usually possesses two articular surfaces, and is connected to the side of the body of two adjacent dorsal vertebrae; the neck is a constricted part of the bone, uniting the head to the shaft; the tubercle, close to the junction of the shaft and neck, is the part which articu- lates with the transverse process of the vertebra. The shaft is compressed, possesses an inner and outer surface, and an upper and lower border, but from the shaft being somewhat twisted on itself, the direction of the surfaces and borders is not uniform throughout the length of the bone. The ribs slope from their attachments to the spine, at first outwards, downwards, and backwards, then down- wards and forwards, and where the curve changes from the backward to the forward direction an angle is formed on the rib. The first, tenth, eleventh, and twelfth ribs articulate each with only a single vertebra, so that only a single surface exists on the head: the surfaces of the shaft of the first rib are almost horizontal; those of the second v ery oblique, the eleventh and twelfth ribs are rudi-ANATOMY. 20 mentary, have neither neck nor tubercle, and are pointed anteriorly. The ribs are by no means uniform in length : they increase from the first to the seventh or eighth, and then diminish to the twelfth; the first and twelfth are therefore the shortest ribs. The first and second costal cartilages are almost horizontal, but the others are directed upwards and inwards. In its general form the chest may be likened to a trun- cated cone. It is rounded at the sides and flattened in front and behind, so that a man can lie either on his back or his belly. Its truncated apex slopes downwards and forwards, is small in size, and allows of the passage of the windpipe, gullet, large veins, and nerves into the chest, and of several large arteries out of the chest into the neck. The base or lower boundary of the cavity is much larger than the apex, slopes downwards and backwards, and is occupied by the diaphragm, a muscle which separates the chest from the cavity of the abdomen. The transverse diameter is greater than the antero-posterior, and the antero- posterior is greater laterally, where the lungs are lodged, than in the mesial plane, which is occupied by the heart. HEAD. The Head forms the summit of the axial part of the body. It consists of two portions—the Cranium and the Face. The Skull, or skeleton of the head, is composed of 22 bones, 8 of which form the skeleton of the cranium, 14 that of the face. Except the lower jaw, which is move- able, the bones are all firmly united by immovable joints.AXIAL SKELETON—HEAD. 21 The 8 bones of the cranium are so united together by their edges as to form the walls of a box or cavity, the cranial cavity, in which the brain is lodged. The box of the cranium possesses a base or floor, a vault or roof, an anterior, a posterior, and two lateral walls. The posterior wall is formed by the occipital bone, which also extends for some distance forwards along the middle of the base; in front of the basal part of the occipital is the sphenoid, which also sends a process upwards on each side of the Fig. 6—Profile of the skull.

The fourteen bones of the face, which are situated below and in front of the cranium, enter into the formation of the walls of cavities which open on the front of the face; thus they complete, along with the frontal, sphenoid, and ethmoid, the walls of the two orbits in which the eye-balls are lodged; along with the ethmoid and sphenoid, the walls of23 AXIAL SKELETON—HEAD. the nostrils; and they form the osseous walls of the mouth. As a general rule, the cranial bones are expanded, and plate- like in form. The outer surface of each bone assists in forming the exterior of the cranium, and not unfrequently is marked by ridges or processes for the attachment of muscles. The inner surface, again, is smooth, and pitted with depressions, in which the convolutions of the brain are lodged, and also marked by grooves for the lodgment of dilated veins called blood sinuses, and of arteries termed meningeal. The two surfaces of a cranial bone, dense in structure, are called its tables, outer and inner, and are separated from each other by bone, looser and more spongy in its texture, called the diploe. In some localities, more especially in certain of the bones which form the walls of the nostrils, the diploe disappears, and comparatively wide interspaces separate the two tables, which contain air and are called air-sinuses. The margins of the bones are denticulated, and it is by the interlocking of the denticula- tions of adjacent bones that they are jointed together, the joints being named sutures. The bones are pierced by holes or foramina, and similar holes exist between the adjacent margins of some of the bones. These, foramina are mostly situated in the floor of the skull; they transmit arteries into the cranial cavity to supply the brain and the inner table with blood, and veins and nerves out of the cavity. The largest of these holes is called foramen mayyium. It lies in the occipital bone, immediately above the ring of the atlas; through it the spinal marrow becomes continuous with the brain, and the vertebral arteries pass to supply the brain with blood. The Occipital, or bone of the Back of the Head (Figs. 6ANATOMY. 24 and 7), consists of four originally distinct pieces fused into a curved plate-like bone. Its subdivisions are arranged around the foramen magnum — the basilar part, basi- occipital, in front ; the condyloid parts, ex-occipitals, one on each side; and the tabular part, or supra-occipital, behind. The anterior surface of the supra-occipital is sub-divided into four fossae, in the two upper of which are lodged the occipital lobes of the cerebrum, in the two lower the cere- bellum; the upper and lower pairs of fossae are separated by a transverse groove for the lodgment of the lateral venous sinus. The posterior surface is marked by a pro- tuberance and by two curved lines for the attachment of muscles; by its margin the supra-occipital articulates with the parietal and temporal bones. Each ex-occipital has on its under surface a smooth condyle for articulation with the atlas; in front of the condyle is a foramen which transmits the last or ninth cranial nerve, called hypoglossal, and behind it a foramen for the transmission of a vein sometimes exists. The basi-occipital articulates and, in the adult skull, is fused with the body of the sphenoid (Fig. 7). The upper surface of the basi-occipital is grooved for the lodgment of the medulla oblongata. Sometimes the part of the supra-occipital situated above the protuberance and upper curved line ossifies as an inde- pendent bone, called interparietal. In some mammals, as the sheep, the existence of an interparietal in the young skull is the rule and not the exception. The Sphenoid or Wedge-shaped bone (Fig. t) lies at the base of the skull; it articulates behind with the occipital; in front it is jointed to the ethmoid and frontal, and by its lateral processes or wings to the frontal, parietal,AXIAL SKELETON—HEAD. 25 and temporal bones. From its position, therefore, it binds together all the bones of the cranium, and, moreover, articulates with many of those of the face. For con- structive purposes it is the most important bone of the head. It consists of a centrum or body, with which four pairs of processes are connected. The body has a deep depression on its upper surface, compared in shape to a Turkish saddle, in which is lodged the pituitary body; hence it is called pituitary fossa. In front of this fossa is a ridge which marks the place of union of the pre- and post-sphenoidal subdivisions of the body of this bone; the body is grooved laterally for the internal carotid artery and the cavernous blood sinuses, and it is hollowed out in its interior to form the sphenoidal air-sinuses: these air- sinuses are partially closed in front by a pair of small bony plates called sphenoidal spongy bones, or bones of Bertin. Behind the pituitary fossa is a pair of processes called posterior clinoid, from which the bone slopes back to the basi-occipital; this slope is called the dorsum sellas, and on it rests the pons Varolii. From the posterior part of each side of the body the great wings, or ali-sphenoids, pass outwards and upwards to the sides of the skull, and each sends off a plate-like process to enter into the formation of the outer wall of the orbit. From the anterior part of each side of the body the lesser wings, orbito-sphenoids, pass outwards, and assist in forming the roof of each orbit; each orbito-sphenoid ends internally in a knob-like process called anterior clinoid, and at its root is a foramen called optic, which transmits the second nerve, or nerve of sight, into the orbit. From the great wings on each side, close to its junction with the body, a pair of pterygoid processes,ANATOMY. 26 called internal and external, project downwards, and the internal process ends in a slender hook termed the hamular process. The ali-sphenoid is pierced by foramina called rotundum, ovale, and spinosum, the two former of which transmit the second and third divisions of the fifth cranial nerve, the last the middle meningeal artery to the mem- branes of the brain; between the orbito- and ali-sphenoids is the sphenoidal fissure which transmits the third, fourth, sixth nerves, and first division of the fifth cranial nerve into the orbit; and at the root of the pterygoid processes is the vidian canal, for the transmission of a nerve of the same name. The Ethmoid, or Sieve-like bone (Eig. 7), is situated between the two orbital plates of the frontal, and in front of the body of the sphenoid. It is cuboidal in shape, and is composed of a central portion and two lateral masses, which are connected together by a thin horizontal plate pierced with holes like a sieve, and called cribrifo) in. This cribriform plate forms a part of the floor of the cranial cavity; on it rest the two olfactory bulbs, and the branches of the nerves of smell, called olfactory or first cranial nerves, pass from the bulbs through the holes in this plate into the nose. The central portion of the bone (mes-etliimid) is a mesial perpendicular plate; it forms a part of the nasal sep- tum and the process above the cribriform plate named crista galli. Each lateral mass consists of an external smooth plate, os planum, which assists in forming the inner wall of the orbit; and an internal convoluted part, called superior and middle spongy bones or turbinals, which enter into the formation of the outer wall of the nostril. These turbinals are associated with the distribution of the nerves of smell;AXIAL SKELETON—HEAD. 27 in the toothed whales, where there are no olfactory nerves, the turbinals are absent, whilst in some mammals, as the crested seal, they assume a highly convoluted form. The lateral masses are hollowed out into air-sinuses, called eth- moidal cells, which communicate with the nostrils and with corresponding sinuses in the sphenoid and frontal bones. The Frontal, or bone of the Forehead (Figs. 6 and 7), consists originally of a right and left lateral half, united by the frontal suture in the middle line of the forehead. As a rule, this suture disappears in early life, and a single greatly curved bone is formed. The bone is convex for- wards, to form the rounded forehead, and presents two eminences, the centres of ossification of the bone ; at the root of the nose is an elevation called glabella, extending outwards, from which, on each side, is the supra-ciliary ridge, corresponding to the position of the eyebrow. In the crania of some races, e.g., the Australian, the forward projection of the glabella and supra-ciliary ridges is con- siderable ; and in the well-known skull from the valley of the Neander it has reached a remarkable size. These ridges and the glabella mark the position of the air-sinuses in the frontal bone. The upper border of each orbit, which ends internally and externally in a process of bone called angular, forms the lower boundary of the forehead. The cerebral surface of the bone is deeply concave, for the reception of the frontal lobes of the brain ; the concavity is deepened by the backward projection of two thin plates of bone which form the roofs of the orbits, which plates are separated from each other by the deep notch in which the ethmoid bone is lodged ; along the margins of this notch may be seen the openings into the frontal air-sinuses.28 ANATOMY. The Parietal bones, two in number (Figs. 6 and 7), form the greater part of the side wall of the skull, and mount upwards to the vertex, where they unite together along the line of the sagittal suture. Each bone possesses about the centre of its outer surface an eminence, the centre of ossification of the bone, with which a hollow on the cerebral surface, lodging a convolution of the parietal lobe of the brain, corresponds. The bone is quadrilateral in form. Three of its margins are strongly denticulated, for junction with the occipital, frontal, and corresponding parietal; the fourth is scale-like, for union with the tem- poral, and forms the squamous suture; near the upper margin on the cerebral surface is a groove for the lodgment of the superior longitudinal venous sinus. The anterior inferior angle articulates with the ali-sphenoid, and is marked by a groove for the middle meningeal artery; the posterior inferior is grooved for the lateral venous sinus, and articulates with the mastoid of the temporal. The Temporal bones, two in number (Figs. 6 and 7), are placed at the side and base of the skull, and are remarkable for containing in their interior the organs of hearing. Each bone consists originally of four sub- divisions—a squamoso-zygomatic, a tympanic, a petro- mastoid, and a styloid—which in course of time fuse together to form an irregular-shaped bone. The squamous part of the squamoso-zygomatic is a thin plate which forms that part of the side of the skull familiarly known as the “ temple.” The zygoma extends horizontally forwards'as a distinct arched process, to join the malar or cheek-bone. At the root of the zygoma is a smooth fossa, called glenoid, which receives the condyle of the lower jaw, and assists inAXIAL SKELETON—HEAD. 29 forming the temporo-maxillary joint. The tympanic portion forms in the foetus a ring, which enlarges subsequently into a curved plate that forms the wall of the external auditory meatus, or passage into the tympanum or middle ear. The tympanic and squamoso-zygomatic parts of the bone fuse together; but a fissure, called Glaserian, situated behind the glenoid fossa, marks their original separation; in this fissure the slender process of the malleus (one of the bones of the tympanum) is lodged. The petro-mastoid or periotic part of the temporal contains the organ of hearing, and is complicated in its internal anatomy. It extends forwards and inwards along the floor of the skull, and forms on the exterior of the skull the large nipple-shaped mastoid pro- cess. This process is rough on its outer surface, for the attachment of muscles, and is hollowed out internally into the mastoid cells or air-sinuses, which communicate with the tympanum or middle ear. The petrous-temporal is distinguished by its stony hardness, and has the form of a three-sided pyramid. Its apex lies in relation to the side of the body of the sphenoid; its base corresponds to the tympanic cavity and external meatus ; its under surface is rough, and forms a part of the under surface of the skull; its anterior and posterior surfaces are smooth and in rela- tion to certain parts of the brain. The petrous part of the bone is traversed by a canal which transmits the internal carotid artery and sympathetic nerve into the cranial cavity, in its posterior surface is a passage, vnternal meatus, down which the seventh cranial nerve proceeds • at the bottom of the meatus the auditory part of that nerve enters the internal ear, whilst the part of the nerve which goes to the muscles of the face traverses a canal in30 ANATOMY. the bone, called aqueduct of Fallopius, which ends ex- ternally, between the styloid and mastoid processes, in the stylo-mastoid foramen. The styloid process is a slender part of the bone which projects downwards from the tympanic plate, and is connected with the small cornu of the hyoid bone by the stylo-hyoid ligament. It does not unite with the rest of the bone until a comparatively late period. Between the petrous-temporal and ex-occipital is the jugular foramen, which transmits out of the skull the eighth cranial nerve and the internal jugular vein. The fourteen bones of the Face are, as a rule, much smaller than those of the Cranium; some have the form of thin scales, others are more irregular in shape. They are named as follows: — Two superior maxillary, two palate, two malar, two nasal, two lachrymal, two inferior turbinal, a vomer, and an inferior maxilla. The Superior Maxillae, or bones of the Upper Jaw (Figs. 6 and 7,) form the skeleton of a large part of the face, and enter into the formation of the walls of the cavities of the nose, mouth, and orbit; around them the other bones of the face are grouped. The facial surface of each bone presents in front a large foramen for the transmission of the infra-orbital branch of the fifth cranial nerve, and behind, several small foramina for the trans- mission of nerves to the teeth in the upper jaw. On the same surface is a rough process for articulation with the malar bone. The orbital surface is smooth, forms the floor of the orbit, and possesses a canal in which the infra- orbital nerve lies. The nasal surface forms a part of the outer wall and floor of the nostril, and presents a hole leading into a large hollow in the substance of the bone,31 AXIAL SKELETON—HEAD. called the antrum, or superior maxillary air-sinus. The nasal surface articulates with the inferior turbinal and palate bones. The nasal and facial surfaces become con- tinuous with each other at the anterior aperture of the nose, and from them a strong process ascends to join the frontal bone close to the glabella; this process also articu- lates with the lachrymal and nasal bones. The palatal surface forms a part of the bony roof of the mouth, and presents in front a small hole (the incisive foramen) which communicates with the nose. In the sheep and many other mammals this hole is of large size; the palatal surface is bounded externally by a thick elevated border, in which are the sockets, or alveoli, for the lodgment of the fangs of the teeth; internally this surface articulates by a narrow border with the other superior maxilla and with the vomer, and, posteriorly, with the palate-bone. The Palate-bone (Fig. 7) lies in contact with the inner surface and posterior border of the superior maxilla, and separates it from the sphenoid. It is in shape not unlike the capital letter L, the horizontal limb forming the hinder part of the bony roof of the mouth by its lower surface, and the back part of the floor of the nose by its upper. The ascending limb assists in forming the outer wall of the nose, and subdivides into an anterior, or orbital, and a posterior, or sphenoidal, pro- cess. At the junction of the two limbs is the pyramidal process, which articulates with the lower ends of the pterygoid processes of the sphenoid. The Vomer (Fig. 7), shaped like a ploughshare, lies vertically in the mesial plane of the nose, and forms a large part of the partition which separates one nostril from32 ANATOMY. the other. It articulates above with the under surface of the body of the sphenoid and the mes-ethmoid; below with the palatal processes of the superior maxillae and palate-bones ; in front with the septal cartilage of the nose, whilst the posterior border is free, and forms the hinder edge of the nasal septum. The Inferior Turbinated is a slightly convoluted bone situated on the outer wall of the nose, where it articulates with the superior maxilla and palate a little below the middle turbinal of the ethmoid. The Lachrymal (Fig. 6) is a small scale-like bone, in shape not unlike a finger-nail, placed at the inner wall of the orbit, and fitting between the ethmoid, superior maxilla, and frontal bones. It has a groove on the outer surface, in which is lodged the lachrymal sac. The Nasal (Fig. 6) is a thin, somewhat elongated bone, which, articulating with its fellow in the middle line, forms with it the bony bridge of the nose; above, it articulates with the frontal, and by its outer border with the ascending process of the superior maxilla. The Malar bone (Fig. 6), irregular in shape, forms the prominence of the cheek, and completes the outer wall of the orbit. It rests upon the superior maxilla; by its orbital plate it articulates with the great wing of the sphenoid; by its ascending process with the external angular process of the frontal; by its posterior process with the zygomatic process of the temporal, so as to complete the zygomatic arch. The Inferior Maxilla, Lower Jaw, or Mandible (Figs. C> and 7), is a large horse-shoe shaped bone, which has the distinction of being the only movable bone of theAXIAL SKELETON—HEAD. 33 head. It consists originally of two separate halves, which unite during the first year of life into a single bone at the symphysis or chin. A characteristic feature of the human lower jaw is the forward slope of the bone at the chin, for in other mammals the symphysis inclines backwards. In the upper border of this bone are the sockets for the lower series of teeth. At the posterior end of the horse-shoe curve on each side the bone ascends almost vertically, and terminates in two processes—an anterior, or coronoid, which is for the insertion of the temporal muscle, and a posterior, or condyle, which is for articulation with the glen- oid fossa of the temporal bone. Where the ascending and horizontal limbs of the bone are continuous, it forms the angle, which is almost a right angle. On the inner surface of the ascending limb is a large foramen, communicating with a canal which traverses the bone below the sockets for the teeth. In this canal are lodged the nerves and blood-vessels for these teeth. The Hyoid bone lies in the neck, a little below the lower border of the inferior maxilla (Figs. 6 and 7). It is shaped like the letter U, and consists of a body, or basi- hyal, from which two long horns, or stylo-hycds, project backwards. At the junction of the body and horns two smaller cornua, or cerato-hyals, project upwards, and are connected with the styloid processes of the temporal bones, or stylo-hycds, by the stylo-hyoid ligaments, or epi-hyals. The hyoid is the bone from which the muscles of the tongue arise, and it is situated immediately above the thyroid cartilage of the larynx, to which it is attached by ligaments. In its general form the Skull is ovoid, with the long axis extending antero-posteriorly, the frontal and occipital c34 anatomy. ends rounded, and the sides somewhat flattened. Its average length in the people of the British Islands is a little more than 7 inches; its greatest breadth about 5| inches; and its height, from the plane of the foramen magnum to the vertex, about inches. Its greatest circumference is about 21 inches. The breadth of the face across the zygomatic arches is about 5 inches.^ The average capacity of the brain cavity is 92 cubic inches. The British skull is dolico-cephalic and orthognathic. The lateral regions of the skull are called the temporal fossa, and give origin to the temporal muscles. Under cover of each zygomatic arch is the zygomatic fossa. At the bottom of this is a hollow between the superior maxilla and sphenoid, called sphenomaxillary fossa, from which the pterygo-maxiUary fissure extends downwards between the pterygoid and superior maxillary; and the spheno- maxillary fissure extends upwards into the orbit. . The orbit is a four-walled pyramidal cavity, wit e base directed forward to the face, and the apex backward to the brain cavity. At the apex are the foramina in the sphenoid, through which the nerve of sight and other nerves pass from the brain to the eyeball, muscles, and other sofl tc+-pnr>+.nrp.s within the oibit. opening pass down almost vertical! are not rounded off as in the ape s _r fleerav ci iikm nrocess. the nc ie ape’s skull; from the centre „ the nasal spine of the superior a, and forms a characteristic ’ Attached to the sides of the35 AXIAL SKELETON—HEAD. opening are the lateral cartilages of the nose, which form the wings of the nostrils, and so modify the position of their openings that in the face they look downwards. The nostrils are separated from each other by a vertical mesial partition composed of the mes-ethmoid, vomer, and triangular nasal cartilage, the last-named of which projects forward beyond the anterior surface of the upper jaw, and con- tributes materially to the prominence of the nose. The outer wall of each nostril presents the convoluted turbinals, which are separated from each other by horizontal passages extending antero-posteriorly; the superior passage or meatus lies between the superior and middle turbinals of the ethmoid, and is continued into the sphenoidal and posterior ethmoidal air-sinuses; the middle meatus lies between the middle and inferior turbinals, and is continued into the frontal, anterior ethmoidal, and maxillary air- sinuses. These sinuses are therefore extensions of the nasal chamber or respiratory passage, and correspond with the air cavities which exist in so many of the bones of birds; the inferior meatus lies between the inferior turbinal and floor of the nose; into its anterior part opens the nasal duct which conveys the tears from the front of the eyeball. The posterior openings of the nose are separated from each other by the hinder edge of the vomer, and are placed between the internal pterygoid plates of the sphenoid. The skull varies in appearance at different periods of life. In infancy the face is small, about ^th of the size of the entire head, for the teeth are still rudimentary and the jaws are feeble; the centres of ossification of the cranial bones are prominent; the forehead projects; the skull is widest at the parietal eminences ; the air-sinuses, and bony36' • ANATOMY. ridges corresponding to them, have not formed. In the adult the face is about half the size of the head, and its vertical diameter is greatly elongated, from the growth of the antrum, the nose, and the dental borders of the jaws; and the angle of the lower jaw is almost a right angle. In old age the teeth fall out, the jaws shrink in, their dental borders become absorbed, the angle of the lower jaw, as in infancy, is obtuse; the vertex and floor of the skull also become flattened, and the sides bulge outwards,—changes due to gravitation and the subsidence of the bones by their own weight. The skull of a woman is smaller and lighter, with the muscular ridges and projections due to the air-sinuses less strongly marked than in a man, but with the eminences or centres of ossification more prominent. The more feeble air-sinuses imply a more restricted respiratory activity and a less active mode of life than in a man. The internal capacity is about 10 per cent, less than that of the male. The face is smaller in proportion to the cranium;- the cranium is more flattened at the vertex, and the height is consequently not so great in proportion to the length as in the man. In the adult female skull, therefore, the infantile characters are less departed from than is the case hi the male. Appendicular Skeleton. UPPER LIMB. Turning now to the Appendicular Skeleton, we shall consider first that of the Superior or Thoracic, or Pectoral Extremity, or Upper Iamb. The Upper Limb may be subdivided into a proximal part or shoulder, aAPPENDICULAR SKELETON—UPPER LIMB. 37, distal part or hand, and an intermediate shaft, which con- sists of an upper arm or brachium, and a fore-arm or anti- braehium. In each of these subdivisions certain bones are found: in the shoulder, the clavicle and scapula; in the upper arm, the humerus ; in the fore-arm, the radius and ulna, the bone of the upper arm in man being longer than the bones of the fore-arm; in the hand, the carpal and metacarpal bones and the phalanges. The scapula and clavicle together form an imperfect bony arch, the Scapular Arch or Shoulder Girdle; the shaft and hand form a free divergent Appendage. The shoulder girdle is the direct medium of connection between the axial skeleton and the divergent part of the limb; its anterior segment, the clavicle, articulates with the upper end of the sternum, whilst its posterior segment, the scapula, approaches, but does not reach, the dorsal spines. Fig. 8.—Diagrammatic transverse section to represent the relations of the shoulder girdle to the trunk. V, a Dorsal Vertebra; C, a Rib; St, the Sternum; Sc, the Scapula; Cr, the Coracoid; Cl, the Clavicle; M, the Meniscus at its sternal end; H, the Humerus. The Clavicle, or Collar Bone (Fig. 9), is an elongated bone which extends from the upper end of the sternum horizontally outwards, to articulate with the acromion process of the scapula. It presents a strong sigmoidal curve, which is associated with the transverse and horizontal direction of the axis of the human shoulder. It is slender v St MANATOMY. 38 in the female, but powerful in muscular males ; its sternal end is thick and somewhat triangular; its acromial end, flattened from above downwards, has an oval articular surface for the acromion. Its shaft has four surfaces for the attachment of muscles; and a strong ligament, con- necting it with the coracoid, is attached to the under surface, near the outer end, whilst near the inner a strong ligament passes between it and the first rib. The clavicle is absent in the hoofed quadrupeds, in the seals and whales, and is feeble in the carnivora; but is well formed, not only in man, but in apes, bats, and in many rodents and insectivora. The Scapula, or Shoulder Blade (Fig. 9), is the most important bone of the shoulder girdle, and is present in all mammals. It lies at the upper and back part of the wall of the chest, reaching from the second to the seventh rib. Its form is plate-like and triangular, with three surfaces, three borders, and three angles. The funda- mental form of the scapula, as seen in the mole, is that o. a three-sided prismatic rod, and its assumption of the plate or blade-like character in man is in connection with the great development of the muscles which rotate the humerus at the shoulder joint. Its costal or ventral surface is in relation to the ribs, from which it is separated by certain muscles: one, called subscapularis, arises from the surface itself, which is often termed subscapular fossa. The dorsum or back of the scapula is traversed from behind forwards by a prominent spine, which lies in the proper axis of the scapula, and subdivides this aspect of the bone into a surface above the spine, the supra- or pr(B-spinous fossa, and one below the spine, the infra- or post-spinous fossa.APPENDICULAR SKELETON—UPPER LIMB. 39 The spine] arches forwards, to end in a broad flattened process, the acromion, which has an oval articular surface for the clavicle; both spine and acromion are largely developed in the human scapula in correlation with the great size of the trapezius and deltoid muscles, which are con- cerned in the elevation and ab- duction of the upper limb. The borders of the scapula, directed upwards, backwards, and down- wards, give attachment to several muscles. The angles are inferior, supero-posterior, and supero-an- terior. The supero-anterior is the most important; it is truncated, and presents a large, shallow, oval, smooth surface, the glenoid fossa, for articulation with the humerus, to form the shoulder joint. Over- hanging the glenoid fossa is a curved beak-like process, the coracoid, which is of importance as corresponding with the separate coracoid bone of birds and reptiles. The line of demarcation between it and the scapula proper is marked on the upper border of the scapula by the supra-scapular notch. Fig. 9.—The Appendicular Skele- ton of the Left Upper Limb.

The upper extremity of this bone possesses a convex spheroidal smooth surface, the head, for articulation with the glenoid fossa of the scapula; it is surrounded by a nar- row constricted neck, and where the neck and shaft become continuous with each other, two processes or tuberosities are found, to which are attached the rotator muscles arising from the scapular fossae. Between the tuberosities is a groove in which the long tendon of the biceps rests. A line drawn through the head of the humerus perpendicular to the middle of its articular surface, forms with the axis of the shaft of the bone an angle of 40°. The shaft of the humerus is cylindriform above, but flattened and expanded below; about midway down the outer surface is a rough ridge for the insertion of the deltoid muscle, and on the inner surface another rough mark for the insertion of the coraco-brachialis. The demarcation between the cylindri- form and expanded parts of the shaft is marked by a shallow groove winding round the back of the bone, in which the musculo-spiral nerve is lodged. The lower extremity of the humerus consists of an articular and a non-articular portion. The articular presents a small head or capitellum for the radius, and a pulley or trochlea for the movements of the ulna in flexion and extension of the limb. The non-articular part consists of two condyloid eminences, internal and external. From the external, or epi- condyle, a ridge passes for some distance along the outer border of the bone ; it gives origin to the supinator and extensor muscles in the fore-arm. From the internal emi- nence, or epi-trochlea, a ridge passes up the inner border ofAPPENDICULAR SKELETON—UPPER LIMB. 41 the shaft of the bone; this eminence gives origin to the pronator and flexor muscles in the fore-arm. In neai’ly two per cent of the bodies examined in the anatomy-rooms in the University of Edinburgh, a hooked process has been seen projecting from the shaft of the bone, about 2 inches above the epi-trochlea; this process is connected to the epi-trochlea by a fibrous band, so as to form a foramen, which has been called supra-condyloid. In these cases the median nerve invariably passes through the foramen, and not unfrequently is accompanied by the brachial artery. In the feline carnivora and some other mammals a foramen constantly occurs in this part of the humerus, through which, as a rule, both nerve and artery proceed, though in the common seal it transmits only the nerve. Before describing the two bones of the fore-arm, the anatomist should note the range of movement which can take place between them. In one position, which is called supine, they lie parallel to each other, the radius being the more external bone, and the palm of the hand being directed forwards; in the other or prone position the radius crosses obliquely in front of the ulna, and the palm of the hand is directed backwards. Not only the bones of the fore-arm, but those of the hand are supposed to be in the supine position when they are described. The Radius (Fig. 9) is the outer bone of the Fore-arm, and like all long bones possesses a shaft and two extremities. The upper extremity or head has a shallow, smooth cup for moving on the capitellum of the humerus; the outer margin of the cup is also smooth, for articulation with the ulna and annular ligament; below the cup is a constricted neck, and immediately below the neck a tuberosity for theANATOMY. 42 insertion of the biceps. The shaft of the bone possesses three surfaces for the attachment of muscles, and a sharp inner border for the interosseous membrane. The lower end of the bone is much broader than the upper, and is marked posteriorly by grooves for the lodgment of tendons passing to the back of the hand : from its outer border a pointed styloid process projects downwards; its inner border has a smooth shallow fossa for articulation with the ulna, and its broad lower surface is smooth and concave, for articula- tion with the scaphoid and semilunar bones of the wrist. The Ulna (Fig. 9) is also a long bone. Its upper end is subdivided into two strong processes by a deep fossa, the greater sigmoid cavity, which possesses a smooth surface for articulation with the trochlea of the humerus. The anterior or coronoid process is marked by an oblique ridge for the insertion of the brachialis anticus, whilst the pos- terior or olecranon process .gives insertion to the large triceps muscle of the upper arm. Immediately below the outer border of the great sigmoid cavity is the small sigmoid cavity for articulation with the side of the head of the radius. The shaft of the bone possesses three surfaces for the attachment of muscles, and a sharp outer border for the interosseous membrane. The lower end, much smaller than the upper, has a pointed styloid process and a smooth articular surface, the outer portion of vhich is for the lower end of the radius, the lower part for moving on a cartilage of the wrist joint called the triangular fibro- cartilage. The Hand consists of the Carpus or wrist, of the Meta- carpus or palm, and of the free Digits, the thumb and four fingers. Anatomists describe it with the palm turned toAPPENDICULAR SKELETON—UPPER LIMB. 43 the front, and with its axis in line with the axis of the fore-arm. The Carpal or Wrist bones (Fig. 9) are eight in number and small in size: they are arranged in two rows, a \proximal,—i.e. a row next the fore-arm,—consisting of the scaphoid, semilunar, cuneiform, and pisiform; and a distal, —i.e., a row next the bones of the palm,—consisting of a trapezium, trapezoid, os magnum, and unciform; the bones in each row being named in the order they are met with, from the radial or outer to the ulnar or inner side of the wrist. It is unnecessary to give a separate description of each bone. Except the pisiform or pea-shaped bone, which articulates with the front of the cuneiform, each carpal bone is short and irregularly cuboidal in shape; its anterior (or palmar) surface and its posterior (or dorsal) being rough, for the attachment of ligaments; its superior and inferior surfaces being invariably smooth, for articulation with adjacent bones; whilst the inner and outer surfaces are also smooth, for articulation, except the outer surfaces of the scaphoid and trapezium (the two external bones of the carpus), and the inner surfaces of the cuneiform and unciform (the two internal bones). Occasionally a ninth or supernumerary bone may arise from the subdivision of the scaphoid, semilunar, or trapezoid, into two pieces; more rarely a distinct bone is found in the human wrist inter- calated between the trapezoid, os magnum, semilunar, and scaphoid, which corresponds in position to the os inter- medium, found constantly in the wrist of the orang, gibbon, the tailed apes, and many rodents and insectivora. The Metacarpal bones, or bones of the Palm of the Hand, are five in number (Fig. 9). They are miniature long£4 ANATOMY. bones, and each possesses a shaft and two extremities. The metacarpal of the thumb is the shortest, and diverges outwards from the rest: its carpal extremity is saddle- shaped, for articulation with the trapezium; its shaft is somewhat compressed, and its phalangeal end is smooth and rounded, for the first phalanx of the thumb. The four other metacarpal bones belong to the four fingers: they are almost parallel to each other, and diminish in size from the second to the fifth. Their carpal ends articulate with the trapezoid, os magnum, and unciform : their shafts are three-sided : their phalangeal ends articulate with the first phalanges of the fingers. The number of Digits in the hand is five, which is the highest number found in the mammalia. They are dis- tinguished by the names of pollex or thumb, and index, middle, ring, and little fingers. Their skeleton consists of fourteen bones, named phalanges, of which the thumb possesses two, and each of the four fingers three. The phalanx next the metacarpal bone is the first, that which carries the nail is the terminal or ungual phalanx, whilst the intermediate bone is the second phalanx. Each is a miniature long bone, with two articular extremities and an intermediate shaft, except the terminal phalanges, which have an articular surface only at their proximal ends, the distal end being rounded and rough, to afford a surface for the lodgment of the nail. LOWER LIMB. The Inferior or Pelvic Extremity, or Lower Limb, consists of a proximal part or haunch, a distal part or foot,APPENDICULAR SKELETON—LOWER LIMB. 45 and an intermediate sliaft subdivided into thigh and leg. Each part has its appropriate skeleton : in the haunch, the pel- vic or innomi- nate bone; in the p thigh, the femur: Fig. 10.—Diagrammatic transverse section to represent in the leg the the relations of the Pelvic Girdle to the Trunk. V, a sacral vertebra; D, the ilium; P, the two pubic bones tibia and fibula meeting in front at the symphysis; F, the femur. (the thigh-bone in man being longer than the leg-bones); in front of the knee, the patella; in the foot, the tarsal and metatarsal bones and phalanges. The bone of the haunch forms an arch or Pelvic Girdle, which articulates behind with the side of the sacrum, and arches forward to articu- late with the opposite haunch-bone at the pubic symphysis. It is the direct medium of connection between the axial skeleton and the shaft and foot, which form a free divergent Appendage. The Os Innominatum, or Haunch-bone, is a large irre- gular plate-like bone, which forms the lateral and anterior boundary of the cavity of the pelvis. In early life it con- sists of three bones—ilium, ischium, and pubis—which unite about the twenty-fifth year into a single bone. These bones converge, and join to form a deep fossa or cup, the acetabulum or cotyloid cavity, on the outer surface of the bone, which lodges the head of the thigh-bone at the hip-joint. One-fifth of this cup is formed by the pubes, and about two-fifths each by the ischium and ilium. At the bottom of the acetabulum is a depression, to the sides of which the interarticular ligament of the hip-jointANATOMY. 46 is attached. From the aceta- bulum the ilium extends up- wards and backwards, the ischium downwards and back- wards, the pubis forwards and H inwards. In front of the aceta- bulum is a large hole, the obturator or thyroid foramen, which is bounded by the ischium and pubes; behind the acetabulum is the deep sciatic notch, which is bounded by the ischium and ilium. The Ilium (Fig. 10) in man is a broad plate - like bone. In its most simple form, as in the kangaroo, it is a three- sided, prismatic, rod-like bone, one end of which enters into the formation of the acetabu- lum, whilst the other is free, and forms the iliac crest. In man, notwithstanding its ex- panded form, three surfaces may also be recognised, cor- responding to the surfaces in the ilium of the kangaroo; and, as in that animal, the lower end forming prom nence of heel v. flfth or little toe.

This crest is of great importance, for it affords attachment to the broad muscles which form the wall of the abdominal cavity. One surface of the ilium is external, and marked by three curved lines which subdivide it into areas for the origin of the muscles of the buttock; another sur- face is anterior, and hollowed out to give origin to the iliacus muscle ; the third, or internal, surface articulates posteriorly with the sacrum, whilst anteriorly it forms a part of the wall of the true pelvis. The external is sepa- rated from the anterior surface by a border which joins the anterior end of the crest, where it forms a process, the anterior superior spine. About the middle of this border is the anterior inferior spine. Between the external and inter- nal surfaces is a border on which are found the posterior superior and inf erior spines ; between the anterior and internal surfaces is the pectineal border, which forms part of the line of separation between the true and false pelvis. The Pubis (Fig. 11) is also a three-sided, prismatic, rod- like bone, the fundamental form of which is obscured by the modification in shape of its inner end. In human anatomy it is customary to regard it as consisting of a body and of two branches, a horizontal and a descending rarrnus. The body and horizontal ramus form the funda- mental prismatic rod, and the descending ramus is merely a special offshoot from the inner end of the rod. The outer end of the rod takes a part in the formation of the acetabulum; the inner end is expanded into the body of the pubis, and has a broad margin, or symphysis, for48 ANATOMY. articulation with the corresponding bone on the opposite side of the pelvis. The three surfaces are—a superior, for the origin of the pectineus muscle; a posterior, which enters into the wall of the true pelvis; and an inferior, which forms the upper boundary of the obturator foramen. The descending ramus is merely a downward prolongation of the inner end of the bone which joins the ischium, and aids in forming the side of the pubic arch. The junction of the outer end of the pubis with the ilium is marked by the pectineal eminence. The superior and posterior sur- faces are separated by the sharp pectineal line, which, starting from the spine of the pubis, runs outwards to aid in forming the brim of the true pelvis. The Ischium (Tig. 11), bke the ilium and pubis, has the fundamental form of a three-sided prismatic rod. One extremity (the upper) completes the acetabulum, whilst the lower forms the large prominence, or tuber ischii. The surfaces of the bone are internal or pelvic, external, and anterior. The pelvic and external surfaces are separated from each other by a sharp border, on which is seen the ischial spine. The pelvic and anterior surfaces are sepa- rated by a border, which forms a part of the boundary o the obturator foramen; but the border between the external and anterior surfaces is feebly marked. The tuberosity, a thick, rough, and strong process, gives origin to several powerful muscles: on -it the body rests in the sitting posture; an offshoot, or ramus, ascends from it to join the descending ramus of the pubis, and com- pletes both the pubic arch and the margin of the obturator foramen. . , By the articulation of the two innominate bones wi49 APPENDICULAR SKELETON—LOWER LIMB. each other in front at the pubic symphysis, and with the sides of the sacrum behind, the osseous walls of the cavity of the Pelvis are formed. This cavity is subdivided into a false and a true pelvis. The false pelvis lies between the expanded wing-like portions of the two ilia. The true pelvis lies below the two pectineal lines and the base of the sacrum, which bound its upper orifice, and form the brim of the true pelvis, or pelvic inlet; whilst its lower orifice or outlet is bounded behind by the coccyx, laterally by the ischial tuberosities, and in front by the pubic arch. In the erect attitude the pelvis is so inclined that the plane of the brim forms with the horizontal plane an angle of from 60° to 65°. The axis of the cavity is curved, and is represented by a line drawn perpendicularly to the planes of the brim, the cavity, and the outlet; at the brim it is directed upwards and forwards, at the outlet downwards and a little forwards. Owing to the inclination of the pelvis, the base of the sacrum is nearly 4 inches higher than the upper border of the pubic symphysis. The female pelvis is distinguished from the male by certain sexual characters. The bones are more slender, the ridges and processes for muscular attachment more feeble, the breadth and capacity greater, the depth less, the ilia more expanded, giving the greater breadth to the hips of a woman than a man; the inlet more nearly circular, the pubic arch wider, the distance between the tuberosities greater, and the obturator foramen more triangular in the female than in the male. The greater capacity of the woman’s than the man’s pelvis is to afford greater room for the expansion of the uterus during pregnancy, and for the expulsion of the child at the time of birth. D50 ANATOMY. The Femur or Thigh-bone (Fig. 11) is the longest bone in the body, and consists of a shaft and two extremities. The upper extremity or head possesses a smooth convex surface, in which an oval roughened fossa, for the attachment of the inter-articular ligament of the hip, is found; from the head a strong elongated neck passes downwards and out- wards to join the upper end of the shaft; the place of junction is marked by two processes or trochanters: the external is of large size, and to it are attached many muscles; the internal is much smaller, and gives attachment to the psoas and iliacus muscles. A line drawn through the axis of the head and neck forms with a vertical line drawn through the shaft an angle of 30°; in a woman this angle is less obtuse than in a man, and the obliquity of the shaft of the femur is greater in the former than in the latter. The shaft is almost cylindrical about its centre, but expanded above and below; its front and sides give origin to the extensor muscles of the leg; behind there is a rough ridge, which, though called linea aspera, is really a narrow surface and not a line; it gives attachment to several muscles. The lower end of the bone presents a large smooth articular surface for the knee-joint, the anterior portion of which forms a trochlea or pulley for the movements of the patella, whilst the lower and posterioi part is subdivided into two convex condyles by a deep fossa which gives attachment to the crucial ligaments of the knee. The inner and outer surfaces of this end of the bone are rough, for the attachment of muscles and the lateral ligaments of the knee. The Patella or Knee-pan (Fig. 11) is a small triangular flattened bone developed in the tendon of the great extensor51 APPENDICULAR SKELETON—LOWER LIMB. muscles of the leg. Its anterior surface and sides are rough, for the attachment of the fibres of that tendon, its posterior surface is smooth, and enters into the formation of the knee-joint. Between the two bones of the leg there are no move- ments of pronation and supination as between the two bones of the fore-arm. The tibia and fibula are fixed in position; the fibula is always external, the tibia internal. The Tibia or Shin-bone (Fig. 11) is the larger and more important of the two bones of the leg; the femur moves and rests upon its upper end, and down it the weight of the body in the erect position is transmitted to the foot. Except the femur, it is the longest bone of the skeleton, and consists of a shaft and two extremities. The upper extremity is broad, and is expanded into two tuber- osities, the external of which has a small articular facet inferiorly, for the head of the fibula; superiorly, the tuber- osities have two smooth surfaces, for articulation with the condyles of the femur; they are separated by an intermediate rough surface, from which a short spine projects, which gives attachments to the inter-articular crucial ligaments and semilunar cartilages of the knee, and lies opposite the inter- condyloid fossa of the femur. The shape of the bone is three-sided; its inner surface is subcutaneous, and forms the shin; its outer and posterior surfaces are for the origin of muscles; the anterior border forms the sharp ridge of the shin, and terminates superiorly in a tubercle for the inser- tion of the extensor tendon of the leg; the outer border of the bone gives attachment to the inter-osseous membrane of the leg. The lower end of the bone, smaller than the upper, is prolonged into a broad process, internal malleolus,52 ANATOMY. which forms the inner prominence of the ankle: its under surface is smooth for articulation with the astragalus; exter- nally it articulates with the lower end of the fibula. The Fibula, or Splint-bone of the leg (Fig. 11), is a slender long bone with a shaft and two extremities. The upper end or head articulates with the outer tuberosity of the tibia. The shaft is three-sided, and roughened for the origins of muscles; along the inner surface is a slender ridge for the attachment of the interosseous membrane. The lower end has a strong process (external malleolus) pro- jecting downwards to form the outer prominence of the ankle, and possesses a smooth inner surface for articulation with the astragalus, above which is a rough surface for the attach- ment of ligaments which bind together the tibia and fibula. The Foot consists of the Tarsus, the Metatarsus, and the five free Digits or Toes, which is the maximum number found in mammals. The human foot is placed in the prone position, with the sole or plantar surface in relation to the ground; the dorsum or back of the foot directed upwards; the axis of the foot at about a right angle to the axis of the leg; and the great toe or hallux, which is the corresponding digit to the thumb, at the inner border of the foot. The human foot, therefore, is a pentadactylous, plantigrade foot. The bones of the Tarsus, or Ankle (Fig. 11, Tr), are seven in number, and are arranged in two transverse rows, a proximal, next the bones of the leg, consisting of the astragalus, os calcis, and scaphoid; a distal, next the metatarsus, consisting of the cuboid, ecto-, rneso-, and ento-cuneiform. If the tarsal bones be looked at along with those of the metatarsus and toes, the bones of the foot may be arranged in two longitudinal columns,—anAPPENDICULAR SKELETON—LOWER LIMB. 53 outer, consisting of tlie os calcis, cuboid, and the metatarsal bones and phalanges of the fourth and fifth toes, an inner column consisting of the astragalus, scaphoid, three cunei- form, and the metatarsal bones and phalanges of the first, second, and third toes. The tarsal, like the carpal bones, are short and irregularly cuboidal; the dorsal arid plantar surfaces are as a rule rough for ligaments, but as the astragalus is locked in between the bones of the leg and the os calcis, its dorsal and plantar surfaces, as well as the dorsum of the os calcis, are smooth for articu- lation; similarly, its lateral surfaces are smooth for articulation with the two malleoli. The posterior surface of the os calcis projects backwards to form the prominence of the heeL With this exception, the bones have their anterior and posterior surfaces smooth for articulation. Their lateral surfaces are also articular, except the outer surface of the os calcis and cuboid, which form the outer border; and the inner surface of the os calcis, scaphoid, and ento-cuneiform, which form the inner border of the tarsus. A supernumerary bone is sometimes found in the human tarsus, from a subdivision of either the ento-cunei- form, astragalus, os calcis, or cuboid into two parts. In some rodents and other mammals eight is the normal number of bones in the tarsus. The Metatarsal bones and the Phalanges of the toes agree in number and general form with the metacarpal bones and the phalanges in the hand. The bones of the great toe or hallux are more massive than those of the other digits, and this digit, unlike the thumb or pollex, does not diverge from the other digits, but lies almost parallel to them.ANATOMY. 54 Development and Homologies of the Skeleton. It will now be advisable to consider briefly the mode of develop- ment of the skeleton, and along with the study of its genesis to compare its several parts with each other, in order to ascertain if correspondences in their arrangement and mode of origin exist, even if they differ in the function or office which they perform. When two or more parts or organs correspond with each other in structure, relative position, and mode of origin, we say they are homologous parts, or homologues; whilst parts which have the same function, but do not correspond in structure, relative position, and mode of origin, are analogous parts, or analogues. Homologous parts have therefore a morphological identity with each other, whilst analogous parts have a physiological agreement. The same parts may be both homologous and analogous, as the fore-limbs of a bat and a bird, both of which, with the same fundamental type of structure, are subservient to flight. In other cases analogous parts are not homologues, as is illustrated by the wing of the insect, which, though subservient to flight, is fundamentally different in structure from the wing of the bat or bird. In the germinal area of the fertilised vertebrate ovum a longitudi- nal groove appears which marks the beginning of the Cranial Cavity and Spinal Canal of the young embryo. At the bottom of this cranio- spinal groove a slender rod is formed, called chorda dorsalis or noto- chord. Each side of the groove then becomes elevated as a thin mem- brane, to meet.behind to enclose a canal in which the brain and spinal marrow are developed. Small dark masses, the primordial or proto- vcrtebrce, next form on each side of the chorda dorsalis. In these proto-vertebrae, about the sixth or seventh week of intra-uterine life of the human ovum, little masses of cartilage appear, which correspond in number and position to the future spinal vertebrae. The part of the cartilage which forms the body of the future vertebra is developed around the chorda dorsalis, which it encloses in its substance, whilst the cartilaginous neural arch forms in the mem- brane which closes in the spinal canal. The formation of these cartilaginous vertebrae is completed in the human embryo about the fourth month of intra-uterine life. The bodies of the cartilaginous vertebrae are connected together by plates or discs of intervening fibro-cartilage, which are also developed around the chorda dorsalis. After the enclosure of the rod-like chorda by the cartilaginous vertebrae and the inter-vertebral discs it disappears, no remains55 development of the skeleton. being found in the adult human body, or in that of the higher vertebrates, except perhaps some slight traces in the soft pulpy centres of the inter-vertebral discs ; although in the cartilaginous fash it remains as a more or less complete structure throughout life. In each of the cartilaginous vertebral bone begins to form and to spread beyond its original point of formation, which is calle a centre or nucleus of ossification; the greater part of the body is formed from one of these centres, and each half of the neural arch from another; whilst small ossific centres arise for the tips of the spinous, transverse, and mammillary processes, and a special plate appears for both the upper and lower surfaces of the body ; the fusion of the various centres together to form a complete vertebra takes place between the twentieth and twenty-fifth year. The atlas has a separate centre for each lateral mass and one for the anterior boundary of the ring. The axis, in addition to the ossific centres found in the vertebrae generally, has one or two for the odontoid process. The seventh cervical vertebra has the anterior bar of its transverse process developed from a separate centre. Each coccygeal vertebra possesses only a single centre, which represents the body of the bone. At the time when the cranio-spinal canal is being closed in by the development of its membranous walls, the germinal layers of the young embryo grow towards its anterior or ventral surface, and meet in the ventral mesial line, so as to enclose the cavities in which the thoracic and abdominal viscera are developed. In the membranous wall on each side of the thoracic cavity twelve cartilaginous rods, the future ribs, are developed; and, connected with the anterior ends of the seven pairs of upper ribs, the cartilaginous sternum is formed. Each rib ossifies from one centre for its shaft, and one each for the head and tubercle. The sternum ossifies in transverse segments,— one for the prse-stemum, one or sometimes two for each1 of the four subdivisions of the meso-sternum, and one for the xiphi-sternum. The complete ossification and fusion of the different parts of the sternum into a single bone does not take place until an advanced age. The Axial part of the skeleton, formed by the vertebrae, ribs, and sternum, is built up of a series of thirty-three transverse segments, equal in number, therefore, to the bones of the spine; so that each vertebra, according as it is, or is not, articulated with a pair of ribs and a segment of the sternum, constitutes a complete or incomplete transverse segment. These several segments are serially homologous with each other, but the homology is not so complete in some of the segments as in the others. In the coccygeal, sacral,56 ANATOMY. and lumbar regions of man and most vertebrates, only tbe verte- bral portion of each skeletal segment is represented, though in the abdominal wall of the crocodiles abdominal ribs and a sternum are developed. In the thoracic region the five lowest dorsal vertebrae have five pairs of ribs developed in connection with them; whilst the seven highest vertebrae have not only their corresponding pairs of ribs, but also a sternum, which bone, however, has only six trans- verse segments. In the cervical region seven vertebrae are found, but the anterior bar of the transverse process, although fused with the vertebral body, is homologous with a rib, for in man it some- times develops as a distinct movable rib in connection with the seventh cervical; and in the crocodiles small movable ribs are regularly developed in connection with the different cervical verte- bras. The bodies and neural arches of the vertebra are serially homologous with each other; as a rule this is also the case with their processes, but the articular processes of the atlas and the superior pair of the axis, although functionally analogous, are not homologous with the articular processes of the other vertebra, but with the articular surfaces for the ribs on the bodies of the dorsal vertebra, for they lie in front of, and not behind, the vertebral notches through which the spinal nerves are transmitted. The development of the odontoid process of the axis shows it to be the body of the atlas displaced from its proper bone and fused with the body of the axis. The development and homology of the Skull is a much more difficult problem to solve than that of the spine. The chorda dorsalis extends along the floor of the skull as far forward as the posterior wall of the pituitary fossa. Cartilage is formed around it, without, however, the previous production of proto-vertebra, and this cartilage is prolonged forward on each side of the fossa, forming two bars, the trabeculce cranii; these bars then unite, and form the mes-ethmoid cartilage; at the same time the cartilage grows out- wards for some distance in the membranous wall of the skull, but it does not mount upwards so as to close it in superiorly, so that the cartilage is limited to the floor of the skull; moreover, the cartilage is not segmented. The roof, side walls, and anterior wall of the cranium retain for a time their primordial membranous Struc- ture. This membrane is prolonged downwards into the face proper, where it forms a pair of maxillary lobes or processes, which pass forwards beneath the eyes to form the side parts of the face, and a mid- or frontal-nasal process, into which the cartilaginous mes- ethmoid extends. Immediately below each maxillary lobe fourDEVELOPMENT OF THE SKELETON. 57 arches, caUed branchial or visceral, arise in the ventral aspect of the head, and in each of the three first of these arches a rod of cartilage is formed. The arches on opposite sides unite with each othei in the ventral mesial line, but those on the same side are separated from each other by intermediate branchial clefts; these clefts all close up in course of time, except the upper part of the first, which remains as the external meatus of the ear, the tympanum, and the Eustachian tube; whilst the interval between the first visceral arch and the maxillary lobes forms the cavity of the mouth. The con- version of the primordial cartilaginous and membranous cranium into the bones of the head takes place by the formation in it of numerous centres of ossification. The basi-, ex-, and so much of the supra-occipital as lies below the superior curved line, are formed from distinct centres in the cartilaginous floor of the skull; whilst the part of the supra-occipital above the curved line arises from independent centres in the membranous cranium, the whole ulti- mately fusing together to form the occipital hone. The basi- or post-sphenoid, the pre- with the orbito-sphenoids, the ali-sphenoid with the external pteiygoid and the internal pterygoid, also arise in the cartilaginous floor, and they, together with the sphenoidal spongy hones which are formed in the membranous cranium, fuse into the sphenoid hone. The palate is apparently formed by ossifica- tion of cartilage continuous with the bar in which the internal pterygoid arises. The central plate and each lateral mass of the ethmoid also arise in the cartilage by distinct centres. The inferior tnrhinal has also a distinct origin in cartilage. The petro-mastoid part of the temporal arises in cartilage from at least three centres, peri-, pro-, and opisth-otic, and soon blends with the squamous and tympanic elements which arise in the membranous cranium; subsequently the styloid process, which is ossified in the rod of cartilage in the second visceral arch, joins the temporal. The lower end of this same rod forms the lesser cornu of the hyoid; the upper end forms two small bones, the stapes and incus, situated within the cavity of the tympanum. The cartilage of the third visceral arch forms the great cornu and body of the hyoid hone. The name of Meckel’s cartilage is applied to the rod found in the first visceral arch; its upper end is ossified into the malleus, a small hone situated in the tympanic cavity; whilst in the membrane sur- rounding the rest of the cartilage the lower jaw-bone is formed. The parietal and frontal bones arise altogether in the membranous vault; and the nasal, lachrymal, malar, and superior maxilbe arise in connection with the membranous lobes which form the face; the58 ANATOMY. vomer is developed in the membrane investing the mes-ethmoid cartilage. The human superior maxilla represents not only the superior maxilla of other vertebrates, but the pre-maxillary bone also; but the two bones become fused together at so very early a period that it is difficult to recognise their original independence. In the deformity of hare-lip and cleft palate, they are not unfre- quently separated by a distinct fissure. Since the time when Oken and Goethe propounded the theory that the skull was built up of several vertebra;, the Vertebral Struc- ture of the skull has led to much discussion amongst anatomists. Every one admits that the skull is in series with the spine, that the cranial cavity is continuous with the spinal canal, and that the cranial vault is formed in the wall of the embryonic cerebro-spinal canal. The skull also, like the spine, is transversely segmented, but whether we regard these segments as vertebra or not will depend upon the conception we entertain of the meaning of the term vertebra. If with Owen we define a vertebra to be “one of those segments of the endo-skeleton which constitute the axis of the body and the protective canals of the nervous and vascular trunks,” then we may support the vertebral nature of the cranial segments on the following grounds:—ls£, The presence of a series of bones extending forwards from the foramen magnum along the basis cranii, in series with the bodies of the spinal vertebra;,—e.g., the basi-occipital, basi-sphenoid, pre-sphenoid, mes-ethmoid (Fig. 7); 2d, The presence of a series of neural arches which enclose and complete the wall of the cranial cavity, and lie in series with the neural arches of the spinal vertebrae,—e.g., the ex- and supra-occi- pitals, which form the neural arches of the basi-occipital segment; the ali-sphenoids and parietals, which form the neural arches of the basi-sphenoid segment; the orbito-sphenoids and frontal, which form the neural arches of the pre-sphenoid segment ; the lateral ethmoid and nasal, which form the neural arches of the ethmoid- nasal segment; 3d, The presence of a series of visceral arches of which the mandibular and hyoidean enclose the alimentary and vas- cular canals, just as the ribs enclose them in the thorax ; and Uh, The presence of foramina between the cranial segments like the inter- vertebral foramina between the spinal vertebra; for the transmission of nerves,—e.g, the sphenoidal fissure and the jugular foramen. But if we are to regard a vertebra as a segment of the axial skeleton, which in course of its formation passes through a definite series of developmental changes, then the cranial segments cannot be regarded as vertebra; in the same sense as the spinal segments,DEVELOPMENT OF THE SKELETON. 59 for, ls<, The chorda dorsalis is not co-equal in length with the basis cranii, as it is with the bodies of the spinal vertebra;, so that if the basi-occipital and basi-sphenoid segments, the bodies of which are developed around it, were to he regarded as cranial vertebra;, the pre-sphenoidal and ethmoido-nasal would not he morphologically the same, as they are formed in front of the anterior end of the chorda. 2d, Proto-vertebra are formed in the spine, but not in the basis cranii. 3d, The spine is transversely segmented in its cartilaginous stage of development, but the skull is not. 4th, The transverse segmentation of the skull only appears when the bones are foimed, but the individuality of the segments becomes again concealed by the fusion of the pre- and basi-sphenoids and the basi-occipital into a continuous bar of bone, a condition which is not found in the spine except in the sacro-coccygeal region. 5th, The neural arches in the spine are, like the bodies, ossified in cartilage, but in the cranium they are for the most part ossified in membrane. These differences in the mode of development of the spine and basis cianii may be summarised as below:— Spine. ls< Stage, 2d Stage, 3d Stage, Unsegmented Proto-vertebra. Segmented chorda. cartilage. Basis Cranii. 1st Stage, 2d Stage, 3 d Stage, Unsegmented Unsegmented Segmented chorda in part. cartilage. bones. ith Stage, Segmented bones. 4 th Stage, Unsegmented bones. It is evident, therefore, that, although both skull and spine are developed in the walls of the cerebro-spinal groove, yet, to quote the words of Huxley, “though they are identical in general plan of construction, the two begin to diverge as soon as the one puts on the special character of a skull and the other that of a vertebral column; the skull is no more a modified vertebral column than the vertebral column is a modified skull.” The Limbs, at their first appearance, sprout like little buds or lappets from the sides of the trunk ; cartilage forms within them, which assumes the shape of the future bones, and as the limbs grow outwards, manifestations of joints appear, and the subdivision of each limb into its several segments takes place. The shaft of the clavicle, however, which ossifies before any of the other bones, begins to form in fibrous membrane; and at a much later period the ends ofANATOMY. 60 the bone, which are formed in cartilage, unite with the intermediate shaft. The scapula ossifies from one centre for its expanded plate and spine, two small centres each for the acromion and vertebral border, and one for the coracoid. In many vertebrates, more espe- cially birds and reptiles, the coracoid is a distinct bone from the scapula, but they articulate with each other to form the glenoid fossa. Each of the three rod-like bones of which the innominate bone is composed ossifies from one centre for the shaft of the bone, and one for each extremity; in the ilium these terminal centres are situated at the crest and acetabulum ; in the ischium, at the tuber and acetabulum ; and in the pubis, at the symphysis and acetabu- lum. Each of the long bones of the shafts of the limbs ossifies from a single centre for the shaft, and one or more centres for each articular extremity. Each carpal and tarsal bone ossifies from a single centre, except the os calcis, which possesses an independent centre for its posterior surface. The metacarpal and metatarsal bones and the phalanges ossify each from two centres, one for the shaft and one for one of the extremities. In the metacarpal bones of the fingers and the four outer metatarsals, the distal end is that which ossifies independently; in the metacarpal of the thumb, in the meta- tarsal of the great toe, and in all the phalanges, the proximal end is that which ossifies independently. As the method of ossification of the first metacarpal and first metatarsal corresponds with that of the phalanges, some anatomists hold that these bones are really the first phalanges of their respective digits, and that the bone which is absent in these digits, when compared with the other digits, is not a phalanx, but a meta-carpal or meta-tarsal bone. When the extremity of a bone ossifies from a centre distinct from the centre from which the shaft arises, it is called an epiphysis. The epiphysis is united to the shaft of the growing bone by an intermediate plate of cartilage, and so long as any of this cartilage remains unossified the bone can continue to grow in length. The ossification is not completed in the different bones until from the twentieth to the twenty-fifth year. In the case of the long bones, the epiphysis situated at the end of the bone, towards which the canal in the shaft which trans- mits the nutrient artery is directed, ossifies to the shaft before the epiphysis at the other end. In the humerus, tibia, and fibula, where the canal is directed downwards, the epiphyses at the lower ends of the bones first unite with the shaft; whilst in the femur, radius, and ulna, where the canal is directed upwards, the ossifica- tion first takes place between the upper epiphysis and the shaft. All anatomists hold that the bones of the shaft and distal part ofDEVELOPMENT OE THE SKELETON. 61 a limb belong to the appendicular part of the skeleton, but there is a difference of opinion as to the place in the skeleton to which the bones of the shoulder girdle and haunch are to be referred. Owen considers that the scapular and pelvic arches belong to the axial skeleton, and are homologous with the ribs; the scapula and coracoid as the visceral or rib-arch of the occipital vertebra, the clavicle of the atlas, and the innominate bone of the upper sacral vertebra. Goodsir objected to this conclusion of Owen’s on the ground that the shoulder girdle was not in series with the visceral arches, but was developed outside the visceral wall, at the junction of the cervical and thoracic regions, from which region the upper limb receives its nerves, and not from the occipito-atlantal region, whence they would have proceeded had it been an appendage of the rib-arches of those segments. Owen’s chief argument for regarding the scapula and coracoid as the costal arch of the occi- pital vertebra is because in fish the scapula is attached to the occipital bone by a bone which Cuvier called the supra-scapula, and which he believed to be homologous with the supra-scapular cartilage of many other vertebrates. Parker, however, has recently pointed out that the so-called supra-scapula of a fish is not homolo- gous with the supra-scapula of a reptile or mammal, that it is not a cartilage bone, but is a splint or scale-like bone, developed as a part of the dermo-skeleton. Between the scapula and coracoid and the innominate bone, anatomists have long recognised homologies to exist j the scapula is generally admitted to be the homotype of the ilium and the coracoid of the ischium, so that if these elements of the shoulder girdle be not a costal arch, neither can those of the pelvic girdle. The clavicle has by some been regarded as the homotype of the pubis; but in all probability the pubis is homo- logous with the procoracoid bone which is found in the amphibia and some reptiles, but is absent in crocodiles, birds, and mammals j whilst the shaft of the clavicle is represented in the pelvic girdle, not by a bone, but by a fibrous band called Poupart’s ligament. Between the bones of the shafts of the limbs homologies exist : the humerus is the homotype of the femur, the radius of the tibia, the ulna of the fibula ; whilst the patella has no representative in the human upper limb. The scaphoid and semilunar bones in the carpus are homotypes of the astragalus in the tarsus, the cunei- form is the homotype of the os calcis, the cuboid of the unciform; the trapezium of the ento-cuneiform, the trapezoid of the meso-, and the os magnum of the ecto-cuneiform. The tarsal scaphoid is not, as a rule, represented in the human carpus, but its homotypeANATOMY. 62 is the os intermedium, found in many mammals. The carpal pisiform is a sesamoid hone developed in the tendon of a muscle. The metacarpal hones and phalanges are homologous with the metatarsal hones and phalanges ; the thumb with the great toe, and the fingers with the four outer toes. During the growth of the limbs outward, and their change from the simple lappet-like form to their elongated condition, a rotation of the proximal segment of the shaft takes place—that of the upper limb a quarter of a circle backward, that of the lower limb a quarter of a circle forward—to produce in the former case a supine position of the fore-arm and hand, with the thumb as the outermost digit; in the latter case, a prone condition of the leg and foot, with the great toe as the inner- most digit. The range of movement at the radio-ulnar joints enables us, however, to pronate the hand and fore-arm by throwing the radius across the ulna, so as to make the thumb the innermost digit. In many quadrupeds the fore-leg is fixed in this position, so that these animals walk on the soles of both the fore and hind feet.CHAPTER II. JOINTS AND MUSCLES. h General Observations on the Articulatory and Muscular Systems. A Joint or Articulation is the junction or union of any two adjacent parts of the body. Most usually the term is employed to signify the connection established between contiguous bones. It is by the joints that the various bones are knit together to form the skeleton. Joints may be either immovable or movable. The immovable joints are divided into the synchondroses and the sutures. A synchondrosis is the junction of two bones by the interposition of an intermediate plate of cartilage; the fibrous membrane or periosteum which invests the bones being prolonged from one bone to the other over the surface of the cartilage. A suture is the connection of two bones by the interlock- ing of adjacent toothed margins; the peri- osteal fibrous membrane is prolonged from one bone to the other, and is also inter-fig. 12.—Vertical sec- posed between their adjacent margins.

In old persons the sutures become obliterated by the ossification of the intermediate fibrous membrane, and the bones are per- manently fused together. The cranial sutures may conveniently be arranged in three groups : Fig. 13.—Vertical section through Median longitudinal, COnsist- bo“! oppose tte iuture ™ °f th<3 fr0ntal Suture> which p?he Connects the two halves of the two bones, which plays the part j. . 1 r -i 1 of a ligament, and wuich is frontal bone, and the sagittal continuous with the interposed , , . ,, . . , fibrous membrane. suture, between the two parietal each consisting, on bones; b, Lateral longitudinal, side of the head, of the fronto-nasal, fronto-maxilla.ry, fronto-lachrymal, fronto-ethmoidal, fronto-malar, fronto- sphenoidal, parieto-sphenoidal, parieto-squamous, parieto- mastoid sutures; c, Vertical transverse, consisting of the coronal or fronto-parietal, the lambdoidal or parieto-occi- pital, the sphenoido-malar, sphenoido-squamous and occi- pito-mastoid sutures (fig. 6). As the skull grows by ossifica- tion of the cartilage of the base and the membranous vault, the direction of growth is perpendicular to the margins of the bones and the sutures and synchondroses which connect them together. The growth of the skull in length is per- pendicular, therefore, to the basi-cranial synchondrosis and the vertical transverse group of sutures; its growth, in breadth, to the median longitudinal group, and in height to the lateral longitudinal group. So long as any of the cartilage or membrane between the margins of the bones remains unossified, bone may continue to form, and the skull may increase in size. It sometimes happens that the cartilage or membrane is prematurely ossified inARTICULATORY AND MUSCULAR SYSTEMS. 65 a particular locality, and the further growth of the skull put a stop to in that region ; if the brain is still growing, the skull must increase in other directions to allow the necessary expansion of the cranial cavity, and deformities of the skull are thereby occasioned. One of the most usual of these deformities is due to premature closure of the sagittal suture, causing stop- page of the growth of the skull in breadth, and, by way of compensation, Fl<*. 14.—Vertex view of a boat-shaped or scapho- cephalie skull, showing the complete disappear- great increase in its ance of the sagittal suture. length, so as to produce a very elongated and somewhat boat-shaped cranium. The movable joints are divided into the amphiartlirodial and the diarthrodial joints. An amphiarthrosis or half- joint has only a feeble range of movement. It consists of two bones, each of which has its articular surface covered by a plate of cartilage, and which plates are firmly connected together by an intermediate disc of fibro-cartilage. The centre of this disc is soft, or may E66 ANATOMY. even be hollowed out into a cavity, lined by a smooth synovial membrane, and contain- ing a little fluid.

In it the two articular surfaces are each covered by a plate of encrusting cartilage, the free surface of which is smooth and polished ; between these surfaces is a cavity containing a glairy fluid, the synovia, for lubricating the smooth surfaces of the cartil- age and facilitating the movements of the joint.

TheARTICULATORY AND MUSCULAR SYSTEMS. 67 articular surfaces of diarthrodial joints are retained in apposition with each other, some- times by investing ligaments, at some, as the carpal and tarsal joints, the surfaces are almost flat, so that they glide on each other; the move- ment is comparatively slight, and about an axis perpen- dicular to the moving surfaces : these are called plane- surfaced joints. In other joints the articular surfaces may be regarded as produced by the rotation of a straight or curved line about an axis lying in the same plane; these are called rotation joints, and they present various modifica- tions according to the direction and relation of the rotat- ing line to the axis. One form of a rotation joint is the pivot joint, in which the movement takes place about the axis of one of the bones, which is the axis of rotation of the joint; examples of this joint are found in the joint between the atlas and odontoid process of the axis and the radio-ulnar joint. Another form is the ginglymus or hinge joint, in which the axis of rotation of the joint is perpendicular to the axes of the two bones; the move- ments of the hinge are called flexion when the angle tendons; at others by atmospheric ? others by surrounding muscles and pressure, aided by the adhesive character of the interposed synovia. The form of the articular or mov- able surfaces varies very materi- ally in different examples of these68 ANATOMY. between the two bones is diminished, and extension when the angle is increased. An important modification of the ginglymus is the screwed-surfaced joint, examples of which are found in the elbow and ankle; here the plane of flexion is not perpendicular, but oblique to the axis of the joint. The saddle-shaped and oblong joints are also modi- fied hinges, but allow motion about two axes; in the oblong both axes are on the same side of the joint; but in the saddle-shaped there is an axis of rotation on each side of the joint. The best example of the saddle-shaped is found between the metacarpal bone of the thumb and the trape- zium ; of the oblong between the fore-arm and the carpus. In the ball-and-socket joint a spheroidal head fits into a cup, and rotation takes place about any diameter of the sphere; the joint therefore is multi-axial; the hip and shoulder joints are the best examples. Some joints, in which the forms of the articular surfaces are more complex, are called composite; in them the movements of a hinge and of a ball-and-socket joint may be combined; the knee may be cited as an example of this form of articulation. In a large number of movable joints only portions of the opposite articular surfaces are in contact with each other at a given time ; but, as the joint describes its path of movement, different parts of the surfaces come into contact with each other successively, and it is not unusual to find the articular surface both of the cartilage and the sub- jacent bone mapped out into distinct areas or facets, which are adapted to corresponding facets on the opposite arti- cular surface in particular positions of the joint. When the corresponding facets on opposite articular surfaces break contact with each other, the space between becomesARTICULATORY AND MUSCULAR SYSTEMS. 69 occupied by synovia, or in some joints, more especially the knee, by folds of synovial membrane enclosing clumps of fat, which have been called synovial pads. In the simple hinge, in that with screwed surfaces, in the oblong and composite joints, the principal ligaments are situated at the sides of the joint, and are called lateral; they not only prevent lateral displacement of the bones, but, by a tightening of their fibres, check excessive movement for- wards or backwards during flexion and extension. In the saddle-shaped and ball-and-socket joints, the joint is in- cluded within a bag-like ligament called capsular. In the pivot joints the cavity in which the pivot fits is completed by a transverse or a ring-shaped ligament. The Muscles are the organs which, by their contraction or shortening, move the bones on each other at the joints. The muscles constitute the flesh of the body. They are so arranged as to be capable not only of moving the various bones on each other, but the entire body from place to place. Hence the muscles are organs both of motion and locomotion. As they can be brought into action at the ivill of the individual, they are called voluntary muscles. Some of the muscles are engaged in the movement of other structures than the bones, such as the eye-ball, tongue, cartilages of the larynx, &c. About 400 muscles are usually enumerated, and the names applied to them express either their position, or relative size, or shape, or direction, or attachments, or mode of action. The word muscle is itself derived from the Latin musculus, a little mouse, from a fancied resemblance between that animal and some of the most simply formed muscles. It is customary to dis- tinguish in a muscle a central part, or belly, and two ex-70 ANATOMY. ,-to t tremities, one of which is the head or the origin, the other i the insertion. The belly is the fleshy part of the muscle, and possesses a deep-red characteristic colour; it is the active contractile structure, the source of motor power. The two extremities are called the tendons of the muscle, or sinews; the tendons are bluish- white in colour, possess no power of contractility, and are merely, as it were, the ropes by which the belly of the muscle is attached to the bone □ or other structure which is moved by its contraction. The term tendon of origin, applied to one extremity of the muscle, signifies the fixed end of the muscle, that to which it draws during its contraction; as a rule this is the end nearest the trunk, the proximal end. The term tendon of insertion is _p applied to the end which is moved by the contraction; as a rule this is the end most removed from the trunk, the distal end. Entering the sub- stance of each muscle is at least one artery, which conveys blood for its Fio is.—The rectus muscle nutrition; this artery ends in a net- muscie3*”1 rC"tiuJ11'acshy work of capillary blood-vessels, from g?nf tendon°nf°inser- which a vein arises and conveys the U,°artery “of 0sapplyblood out of the muscle again; an- r:ith:cVaytc»ra,:atiCVC3SCl; other small vessel, called a lymphatic,71 ARTICULATORY AND MUSCULAR SYSTEMS. also arises within the muscle, and conveys the fluid lymph out of the muscle. Each muscle also is pene- trated by a nerve, by which it is brought into connection with the brain, and along which the nervous impulse, started by the Will, is conveyed. The Will is the natural stimulus for exciting muscular action, which action is m many cases so rapid that scarcely an appreciable interval of time intervenes between willing and doing the action. The bones form a series of rod-like levers, and, in study- ing the mode of action of the muscles, the place of inser- tion of the muscle into the bone—that is to say, the point of application of the power which causes the movement— and its relations to the joint, or fulcrum, or centre of motion, and to the weight or resistance which is to be overcome, have to be kept in view. The relative positions of ful- crum, point of application of power, and resistance, are not the same in all the bony levers. As a rule, the muscles are inserted into bones between the fulcrum and the mov- able point of resistance, and nearer the fulcrum than the movable point, as may be seen in the muscles which bend the fore-arm at the elbow-joint. Although from the weight- arm of the lever being in these cases much longer than the power-arm, the muscles, as regards the application of the power, act at a disadvantage, yet the movement gains in velocity. Sometimes the muscle is inserted, as is the case in the great muscle which straightens or extends the fore-arm, at one end of the lever, and the fulcrum or joint is placed between it and the movable point. At other times, as in the case of the chief depressor muscle of the lower jaw, whilst the muscle is attached to one end of the lever, the fulcrum is at the opposite end. When aANATOMY. 72 muscle is so placed that its tendon of insertion is perpen- dicular to the bone to -which it is attached, it acts to great advantage; when placed obliquely or nearly parallel, a loss of power occurs. Many muscles at the commencement of contraction lie obliquely to the bones which they move, but as contraction goes on they become more nearly per- pendicular, so that they act with more advantage near the close than at the commencement of contraction. If a muscle passes over only one joint, it acts on that joint only; but if it passes over two or more joints, it acts on them in succession, beginning with the joint next the point of insertion. A given movement may be performed by the contraction of a single muscle, but as a rule two or more muscles are associated together, and they are not unfre- quently so arranged that one muscle initiates the move- ment, which is then kept up and completed by the rest. Muscles producing movement in one direction have opposed to them muscles which by their contraction effect the opposite movement; when both groups act simultaneously and with equal force, they antagonise each other, and no motion is produced; when a muscle is paralysed or divided, its antagonistic muscle draws and permanently retains the part to its own side. The rapidity of action of a muscle is proportioned to the length of its fasciculi, its power of contraction to their number. Each muscle is invested by a sheath, the perimysium, formed of connective tissue. In the limbs and in the neck not only has each muscle a sheath, but a strong fibrous membrane envelopes the whole of the muscles, and assists materially in giving form and compactness to the region. This membrane is called generally a fascia or muscularARTICULATORY AND MUSCULAR SYSTEMS. 73 aponeurosis, but special descriptive names are given to it in tbe different regions—e. g., cervical fascia, brachial aponeurosis, fascia lata, or fascia of the thigh. In some localities muscles arise from the fascia, and in others they are inserted into it. The fascia is separated from the skin by a layer of subcutaneous fatty tissue, the superficial fascia, and in this layer muscles are in some localities de- veloped. In the fat of the inner border of the palm of the hand a small muscle, the palmaris brevis, is found, which is inserted into the skin covering the ball of the little finger; at each side of the neck, also, lies a thin muscle called platysma myoides, and the muscles on the face and scalp which move the skin of the face and head belong to the same category. These muscles belong to the group of sub-cutaneous or dermal muscles, which, except in the locali- ties above referred to, is not represented in the human body, but is well known in the bodies of the mammalia generally as the panniculus carnosus. In arranging the muscles for descriptive purposes, either a morphological, a topographical, or a physiological method may be pursued. The morphological arrangement is to be preferred when the object is to compare the muscular system in man with that in different animals, and the basis of the arrangement should be into muscles of the axial, the appendicular, and the axi-appendicular skeletons, and sub-cutaneous muscles; a topographical arrangement is most suitable for the purposes of the practical surgeon; a physio- logical arrangement, when the object is to study the action of the muscles in connection with the movements of the joints.74 ANATOMY. Joints and Muscles of the Axial Skeleton. The Intervertebral Joints are complex in construction. The bodies of the true vertebrae are connected together by an amphiarthrodial joint: the fibro-cartilaginous plate or intervertebral disc is tough and fibrous in its peripheral part, but soft and pulpy within. (Fig. 15.) Remains of the chorda dorsalis are said to occur in the soft pulp, and some- times a distinct cavity, lined by a synovial membrane, is found in the centre of the disc, which in the finner whales is expanded into a large central cavity containing many ounces of synovia. A diarthrodial joint connects the supe- rior and inferior articular processes of adjacent vertebrae on each side. Elastic yellow ligaments, the ligamenta subjlava, pass between their laminae. Inter- and supra-spinous liga- ments connect adjacent spinous processes, and in the neck the supra-spinous ligament forms a broad band, the liga- mentum nuchoe. In those mammals which possess big heads or heavy horns, this ligament of the back of the neck forms a powerful elastic band for the support of the head. The joints between the atlas and axis, and the atlas and occiput, are specially modified in connection with the movements of the head on the top of the spine. The intervertebral discs are absent, and the range of movement either from before backward, as in nodding the head, or from side to side, as in looking over the shoulder, are more extensive than between any of the other true vertebrae The head rotates along with the atlas around the odontoid or pivot process of the axis, which is lodged between the anterior part of the atlas and a strong transverse ligament75 JOINTS AND MUSCLES. which lies behind the odontoid. Too great movement to one side or the other is prevented by the check ligaments, which pass from the top of the odontoid to the occipital bone, in front of the foramen magnum. The nodding movements take place between the occiput and atlas, and are permitted by the size and shape of the occipital condyles and hollow upper articular surfaces of the atlas. These joints are all diarthrodial. The spine is flexible and elastic; except in the joints above referred to, the range of movement between any two true vertebrae is very small, but the sum of the movement in the entire spine, owing to the number of bones, is considerable. The elasticity of the spine is partly due to the numerous diarthrodial joints between its articular processes, but more especially to the discs of fibro-cartilage interposed between the bodies of the vertebrae, which act like elastic pads or buffers to pre- vent shock. The spine and trunk may be bent either forwards or backwards, or to the right and left side; or without being bent, the spine may be screwed to the right or to the left, the screwing movement being permitted by the oblique direction of the articular processes. The muscles which move the vertebrae on each other are principally situated on the back of the trunk. In the hollow on each side of the spinal column is the great erector spin* muscle, with its several subdivisions, the fibres of which pass longitudinally upwards, to be inserted into the vertebral spines and transverse processes and the angles of the ribs. When both muscles act together, the entire spine is bent back; but when the muscle of one side only contracts, then the spine is bent to that side. These muscles also act in raising the spine from the bent to theANATOMY. 76 erect position, and they are assisted by small inter-spinal muscles, situated between the spines in the cervical and lumbar regions. The spine is bent forward by the psoas and longi colli muscles; and the straight muscles of the abdomen, inserted into the lower true ribs, assist in this movement. The screwing movements of the spine are effected by a series of muscles arranged in layers, the fibres of which pass obliquely from below upwards and inwards, between the laminae and spines of adjacent verte- brae, and are known as the semispinales, multifidi, and rotatores spinae muscles. The head is balanced on the summit of the spine, and is maintained in a quiescent position without any appre- ciable muscular action, but it can be moved in various directions by the muscles inserted into its bones. The nodding movements of the head on the atlas are due to the posterior recti, the two superior obliques, the two splenii, and the two complexus muscles, inserted into the supra-occipital, which draw the head backwards; and the anterior recti, inserted into the basi-occipital, and sterno- cleido-mastoid muscles, inserted into the mastoid pro- cesses, which draw it forwards. When the right splenius, right greater posterior rectus and inferior oblique act along with the left complexus and sterno-mastoid, the head is rotated to the right shoulder; the opposite rotation being due to the action of the corresponding muscles on the other side of the neck. In the formation of the walls of the abdomen proper, bones and joints play but a small part. The lumbar vertebrae behind, the expanded wings of the iliac bones below, and the false ribs above, are the only bones to beJOINTS AND MUSCLES. 77 considered. Three pairs of greatly expanded muscles— the external oblique, internal oblique, and transverse—lie at the sides and in front; and two pairs of muscles—the recti and pyramidales—are situated wholly in front. The internal oblique and the transverse muscles are attached above to the ribs, behind to the lumbar spine, below to the iliac crest and to a strong band, Poupart’s ligament, extend- ing from the crest of the ilium to the pubic spine; the ex- ternal oblique has similar connections above and below, but is not attached behind to the lumbar spine. The muscles all terminate in front in strong expanded tendons, called the anterior abdominal aponeuroses, which blend together in the middle line anteriorly to form the band called linea alba, which stretches longitudinally from the xiphi-sternum to the pubic symphysis. These expanded tendons enclose the recti muscles, which pass from the pubic crest upwards to the cartilages of the three lower true ribs; and the pyramidal muscles, which pass from the body of the pubis to be inserted into the linea alba. The entire arrangement is admirably adapted for completing the walls of the great abdominal chamber, and for enabling the muscles to com- press the abdominal viscera, an action which takes place when the contents of the bowels and bladder are being expelled during defalcation and micturition. Bones and joints play a more important part in the formation of the walls of the thoracic than of the abdo- minal cavity. Not only are there twelve thoracic vertebrae behind, and the sternum in front, but the twelve ribs on each side arch more or less completely forward from the spine; and the seven upper ribs, through their costal cartilages, articulate with the sternum.78 ANATOMY. Costo-vertebral Joints are situated between the head of a rib and the body of one or more usually two adjacent vertebrae: in the latter case, an interarticular ligament passes from the head of the rib to the intervertebral disc and subdivides the joint into two parts. Except in the floating ribs, Costo-transverse joints exist between the tubercle of the rib and the transverse process of the vertebra. The joints are diarthrodial, and completed by ligaments and synovial membrane. The Costo-sternal Joints are also diar- throdial (except the first costal cartilage, which is directly united to the prae-sternum), a capsular ligament, lined by a synovial membrane, connecting the cartilages of the true ribs to the sternum. The cartilages of the sixth to the ninth ribs are also united together by ligamentous fibres. The movements of the ribs and sternum at the costo- vertebral and costo-sternal joints are of the utmost import- ance in the process of breathing. Breathing or respiration consists of two acts with intermediate pauses—breathing in, or inspiration, and breathing out, or expiration. During inspiration, the air rushes through the nose or mouth down the windpipe, and dilates the air-cells of the lungs; together with the expansion of the lungs the walls of the chest rise, so that the capacity both of lungs and chest at the end of a full inspiration is nearly doubled. During inspiration the following changes occur in the walls of the chest: the ribs are elevated and rotated outwards, the lower borders of their shafts are everted, while their surfaces are at the same time rendered more oblique, and the width of the intercostal spaces is thereby in- creased ■ the elevation and rotation of the ribs throw the sternum upwards and forwards, and make the thoracic79 JOINTS AND -MUSCLES. part of the spinal column straighter; the diaphragm is depressed, and the antero-lateral walls of the abdomen are thrown forward. The muscles which cause these move- ments are as follows:—In each of the spaces between the different ribs a pair of intercostal muscles is situated; these elevate and rotate the ribs, and the movements are assisted by the levatores costarum, and, in the case of the upper and lower ribs, by the scaleni and serrati postici muscles; and by these agents the transverse and antero- posterior diameter of the chest is increased. The increase Flo. 19.—The concave abdominal surface of the diaphragm, a, 4th lumbar vertebra; b, c, 12th and 11th- ribs; d, xiphi-stemum ; e,/, crura of diaphragm ; g, h, arcuate tendons of origin of diaphragm; k, aorta; l, oesophagus; m, inferior vena cava; n, psoas; o, quadratus muscle; qqq, central tendon of diaphragm, into which the muscular fibres are inserted. in its vertical diameter is due to the action of the dia- phragm or midriff, the great muscle which, arising by itsANATOMY. 80 circumference from tlie xiphi-sternum, cartilages of six lower ribs, arcuate ligaments, and by its two crura from the bodies of the four upper lumbar vertebras, forms the floor of the thoracic and the roof of the abdominal cavity. It con- stitutes a great arch, with its convexity directed to the cavity of the chest. By the contraction of its fibres, which are inserted into a trefoil-shaped central tendon, the arch is rendered less convex, and the floor of the chest is thereby depressed. Under circumstances which require more powerful efforts of inspiration, the muscles which pass from the walls of the chest to the upper limbs may, by taking their fixed points at the limbs, Act as elevators of the ribs. During expiration the ribs are depressed, their lower borders inverted, the width of the intercostal spaces diminished, the sternum depressed, the spine more curved, and the diaphragm more convex. These move- ments are principally due to the recoil of the elastic tissue of the lungs previously rendered tense by the inflation of the air-cells, and to the untwisting of the ribs when the inspiratory muscles cease to elevate and rotate them. Muscular action plays but a small part in quiet expiration, but the expulsion of the air from the lungs may be facili- tated by contracting the abdominal muscles, which, by pressing the abdominal viscera against the under surface of the diaphragm, force that muscle upwards. The Temporo-maxillary Joints are the only diarthrodial articulations in the head. The condyle of the lower jaw on each side is received into the glenoid fossa of the temporal bone j each joint is enclosed by a capsular ligament, and between the articular surfaces is a meniscus, which sub- divides the interior of the joint into two cavities, each lined81 MUSCLES OF MASTICATION. by a synovial membrane. The movements of the lower jaw take place simultaneously at both its articulations during mastication and speech, through the action of the several muscles which are inserted into it. This bone is elevated by the temporal muscles, inserted into the coronoid processes; by the masseterics, inserted into the outer surface of the ascending rami and angles, and the internal pterygoids, one into the inner surface of each angle. It is depressed partly by its own weight and partly by the action of the digastrics and genio-hyoids, inserted close to the symphysis; by the platysma, inserted into the outer surface of each horizontal ramus; and the mylo- hyoids, into their inner surfaces. The elevators of the jaw are much more powerful than the depressors, for they not only have to overcome the weight of the bone, but during mastication have to exercise force sufficient to cut or break down the food between the teeth. In carnivorous animals, more especially those which, like the tiger or hyaena, crack the bones of their prey, these muscles attain a great size. The lower jaw can be projected in front of the upper by the external pterygoid muscles, inserted into the neck of the bone and the interarticular meniscus on each side; but excessive movement forward is checked by the action of the stylo-maxillary ligaments, which pass from the styloid processes to the angles of the bone : when projected forward, the jaw is drawn back by the posterior fibres of the temporal muscles. When the elevator, depressor, protractor, and retractor muscles are successively brought into action, the lateral or grinding movements of the bone, so important in mastication, are produced. Along with the movements of the lower jaw those of the F82 ANATOMY. hyoid bone and larynx must be considered, for the digastrics, the genio- and mylo-hyoids, which, when their fixed ends are at the hyoid, depress the lower jaw, act, when their mandibular ends are fixed, along with the stylo-hyoid muscles in elevating the hyoid bone and larynx. These structures are depressed or drawn downwards by the action of the sterno-hyoids, sterno-thyroids, thyro-hyoids, and omo-hyoids. The elevation of the hyoid, when drawn down by its depressor muscles, is also effected by the elastic stylo-hyoid ligaments attached to its small cornua, which, by their recoil when the depressor muscles have ceased to contract, draw the bone up to its former position. Numerous muscles are situated immediately beneath the skin of the scalp and face. They are not of so deep red a colour as the muscles of the trunk and limbs, and whilst they arise from one or other of the bones of the head, they are inserted into the deep surface of the skin itself. Hence when they contract they move the skin of the scalp and face, and as they are the instruments through which the various passions and emotions are expressed, they are grouped together as the Muscles of Expression. The occipito- frontalis, or great muscle of the scalp, passes fiom the occipital bone over the vertex to the forehead; vhen it contracts, the skin of the forehead is wrinkled trans- versely, the eyebrows are elevated, and an expression of amazement or surprise is produced. Some persons have a greater power over this muscle than others, and by the altei - nate contraction of its occipital and frontal portions can move the hairy scalp to and fro with great rapidity. A paii of muscles, the corrugatores supercilii, arises from the supra- ciliary ridges, on the frontal bone, to be inserted into the83 MUSCLES OF EXPRESSION. eyebrows : they draw the eyebrows downwards and in- wards, wrinkle the skin of the forehead longitudinally, and contract with great vigour in the act of frowning. The auricle of the external ear has three small muscles inserted into it, one behind, the posterior auricular muscle, one above, the superior, one in front, the anterior : in man, as a rule, these muscles are feeble, and have little action ; but in many mammals they are large, and by them the animal pricks its ears to detect the faintest sound of danger. The eyelids are drawn together, so as to close the eye as in the act of sleep, by the orbicularis palpebrarum, the fibres of which lie in the eyelids and on the borders of the orbit, and surround the fissure between the eyelids. This muscle is a characteristic specimen of the group of sphincter muscles, i.e., muscles which surround orifices, and by their contraction close them. When the upper fibres of the muscle alone contract, the upper eyelid is depressed,— a movement which takes place almost involuntarily and with great frecpiency during our waking hours, so as to wash the tears over the exposed part of the eyeball and keep it moist. In expressing a “ knowing wink,” the lower fibres alone of the orbicularis contract, and the lower lid is elevated. The elevation of the upper lid, as in opening the eye, is due to the levator palpebrse superioris, which, arising within the orbit, is inserted into the upper eyelid. Muscles are inserted into the cartilaginous frame- work of the nostrils so as to increase or diminish the size of their orifices, and thus to promote or impede the passage of air into the nose. The size of the orifice is increased by two elevator muscles inserted into the ala, or side of the nostril; and when viole nt exercise is being performed, orANATOMY. 84 respiration is from any cause impeded, the nostrils are always widely dilated. One of these elevator muscles, which also sends a slip down to the upper lip, and is con- sequently called the common elevator, is the muscle by the contraction of which a sneer is expressed. A partial closure of the nostril can be effected by small muscles which depress and compress the alse of the nose : in man these muscles are rudimentary as compared with the seal and other aquatic mammals, in which a powerful sphincter muscle closes the nostrils in the act of diving. The lips can be elevated or depressed so as to close or open the mouth; they can be protruded or retracted, or the corners of the mouth can be drawn to one side or the other, by the action of various muscles which are inserted into these movable folds of the integument. The orbicularis oris is a sphincter muscle, the fibres of which lie both in the upper and lower lips; by its contraction the mouth is closed and the lips pressed against the teeth, as when a firm resolution is intended to be expressed. The mouth is opened by the elevator muscles of the upper and the depressors of the lower lip ; it is transversely elon- gated by the zygomatic and risorius muscles, which pass to its corners, and which are brought iuto action in the acts of smiling and laughing. But the muscles of the lips also play an important part in connection with the reception of food into the mouth, and with the act of articulation. The cavity of the mouth forms the commencement of the alimentary canal, and is lined by a soft mucous mem- brane. In it the teeth and tongue are situated, and into it the secretion called saliva is poured. It opens behind into the pharynx. The side walls of the mouth85 MUSCLES OF MOUTH. are called the cheeks, and into the formation of each cheek a flattened quadrilateral muscle, the buccinator (Fig. 20, a), enters. This muscle is attached above and below to Fig. 20.—Profile of cheek and pharynx, a, buccinator; b, tensor; c, levator palati; d, e,/, superior, middle, and inferior constrictors; g, thyro-hyoid; h, hyo-glossus; 1, mylo-hyoid; m, crico-thyroid; n, stylo-pharyngeus; o, stylo-glossus; q, fibrous band which gives origin to buccinator and superior constrictor; 1, glosso-pharyngeal nerve; 2, superior laryngeal artery; 3, superior laiyngeal nerve; 4, its branch to crico-thyroid muscle; 5, inferior laryngeal nerve and artery. the upper and lower jaw-bones, behind to the pterygo- maxillary ligament, to which the upper constrictor muscle (d) is also connected, so that the walls of the mouth and86 ANATOMY. pharynx are continuous with each other, whilst in front the buccinator blends with the structures in the lips. It compresses the cheeks, and drives the ah’ out of the cavity of the mouth as in playing a wind instrument; hence the name, “ trumpeter’s muscle.” The aperture of communication between the mouth and pharynx is named the isthmus of the f auces. It is bounded below by the root of the tongue, on each side by the tonsils, and above by the soft palate. The soft palate is a structure which hangs pendulous from the posterior edge of the hard bony palate. From its centre depends an elongated body, the iiviila, and from each of its sides two folds extend, one downwards and forwards to the tongue, the other down- wards and backwards to the pharynx. These folds are called the anterior and posterior pillars of the fauces or palate. Between the anterior and posterior pillar, on each side, the tonsil is seated. The soft palate and its pillars are invested by the mucous lining of the mouth and pharynx, and contain small but important muscles. The muscles of the soft palate and uvula, termed the elevators and tensors, raise and make them tense during the process of deglutition. The muscles of the posterior pillars, or palato-pharyngei, by their contraction, approximate the walls of the pharynx to the soft palate and uvula, whilst the muscles of the anterior pillars, or palato-glossi, diminish the size of the fauces. The pharynx is a tube with muscular walls, lined by a mucous membrane, which communicates above and in fiont with the cavities of the nose, mouth, and larynx, whilst below it is continuous with the oesophagus or gullet. It serves as the chamber or passage down which the food goes from the mouth to the oesophagus in the act of87 MUSCLES OE PHARYNX. swallowing, and through, which the air is transmitted from the nose or mouth to the larynx in the act of breathing. It lies immediately behind the nose, mouth, and larynx, and in front of the five upper cervical vertebras. Its length is from 4J to 51, inches; its widest part is opposite Fig. 21.—Interior of the pharynx, seen hy opening its posterior wall, a, a, Eustachian tube; 6,6, tensor; c, levator palati; d, levator uvulae; e, e, palato- pliaryngeus, cut through on the right side to show l, the tonsil; /, palato- glossus ; g, h, k, the three constrictors. the back of the mouth. The principal muscles in its walls are called the constrictors, and are named, from above downwards, superior, middle, and inferior (Fig. 20, 21). They are arranged in pairs, and arise from the cartilages ofANATOMY. 88 the larynx, from the hyoid bone, lower jaw, and internal pterygoid processes of the sphenoid; whilst the superior pair also spring from the pterygo-maxillary ligaments; their fasciculi curve backwards to the middle line of the posterior wall of the pharynx, to be inserted into a tendinous band which extends longitudinally along this wall of the tube to be attached above to the basi-occipital. The action of the muscles of the mouth, palate, and pharynx may now be considered in connection with the process of deglutition or swallowing. When the food is received into the mouth, it is moistened by the secretion of the salivary and other buccal glands, and is broken down by the grinding action of the molar teeth. The buccinator muscles press it from between the gums and the cheeks, and, along with the movements of the tongue, aid in col- lecting it into a bolus on the surface of that organ. Dur- ing the process of mastication the palato-glossi contract so as to close the fauces. When the bolus is sufficiently tritu- rated and moistened, the palato-glossi relax, the tip of the tongue is pressed against the roof of the mouth, and by a heave backward of that organ the bolus is pressed through the posterior orifice of the mouth into the pharynx, where it is grasped by the superior constrictor muscles, and forced downwards by them and the other constrictor muscles into the oesophagus, and thence into the stomach. As both the nose and larynx open into the pharynx, the one imme- diately above, the other immediately below the orifice of the mouth, it is of great importance that none of the food should enter into these chambers, and obstruct the respira- tory passages. To guard against any accident of this kind, two valvular structures are provided,—viz., the soft palate89 DEGLUTITION. and the epiglottis—which, whilst leaving the orifices into their respective chambers open during breathing, may effectually close them when deglutition is being performed. As the bolus is being projected through the fauces into the pharynx, the soft palate and uvula are elevated and made tense, and at the same time the wall of the pharynx is brought in contact with it by the contraction of the palato- pharyngei; the part of the pharynx into which the nose opens is thus temporarily shut off from that into which the mouth opens. If laughter, however, be excited at this time, the tension of the soft palate is destroyed, and part of the food may find its way upwards into the nose. The closure of the larynx by the epiglottis is due partly to the depression of that valve and partly to the elevation of the larynx. The backward heave of the tongue relaxes the glosso- and hyo-epiglottidean ligaments which connect the front of the epiglottis to that organ, and enables the small aryteno- epiglottidean muscles to depress the valve. The eleva- tion of the hyoid and larynx is due to the action of the mylo-hyoid, digastric, and genio-hyoid muscles, which pass from the lower jaw to the hyoid, and of the thyro- hyoids, which pass from the hyoid to the thyroid cartilage of the larynx; preliminary to their action, the lower jaw must be fixed, which is done by the closure of the mouth prior to the act of swallowing. The aperture of the larynx is thus brought into contact with the depressed epiglottis, which is adapted more exactly to the opening by a change in its form due to the projection of a cushion-like pad from its posterior surface. By these ingenious arrange- ments the nose and larynx are temporarily shut off from the buccal part of the pharynx, and the adaptation of a90 ANATOMY. single chamber to the very different functions of breathing and swallowing is effectively provided for. Joints and Muscles of the Upper Limb. The upper limb is jointed to the trunk at the sterno- clavicular articulation. This is a diarthrodial joint: the bones are retained together by investing ligaments; and a meniscus is interposed between the articular surfaces, so that the joint possesses two synovial membranes. A strong costo-clavicular ligament, which checks too great upward movement, connects the clavicle and first rib, and the inner ends of the clavicles are connected by the inter- clcivicular ligament. The two bones of the shoulder girdle articulate with each other at the diarthrodial acromio- clavicular joint, which possesses a capsular ligament; but, in addition, a strong coraco-clavicular ligament, which checks too great displacement of the bones, passes be- tween the clavicle and coracoid. The movements of the upper limb on the trunk take place at the sterno-clavicular joint, and consist in the elevation, depression, and forward and backward movement of the shoulder. The movements at the acromio-clavicular joint occur when the scapula is rotated on the clavicle in the act of elevating the arm above the head. The muscles which cause these move- ments are inserted into the bones of the shoulder girdle; the trapezius into the clavicle, acromion, and spine of the scapula; the rhomboid, levator anguli scapulas, and serratus magnus into the vertebral border of the scapula; the pec- toralis minor into the coracoid process; and the subclavius into the clavicle. Elevation of the entire shoulder, as inJOINTS AND MUSCLES—UPPEK LIMB. 91 shrugging the shoulders, is due to the contraction of the trapezius, levator scapulas, and rhomboideus; depression partly to the weight of the limb and partly to the action of the subclavius and pectoralis minor; movement forward to the serratus and pectoralis; and backward to the trapezius and rhomboid. In rotation of the scapula on the clavicle, the inferior angle of the scapula is drawn forward by the serratus and lower fibres of trapezius, and backward by the levator scapulae, rhomboid, and lesser pectoral. The Shoulder Joint is a ball-and-socket joint, the ball being the head of the humerus, the socket the glenoid fossa of the scapula. A large capsular ligament, which is pierced by the long tendon of the biceps muscle, and lined by a synovial membrane, encloses the articular ends of the two bones, and is so loose as to permit a lange of movement greater than takes place in any othei joint in the body. The muscles which cause these movements are inserted into the humerus; the supra-spinatus, infra- spinatus, and teres minor into the great tuberosity; the sub-scapularis into the small tuberosity; the latissimus dorsi and teres major into the bottom of the bicipital groove; the pectoralis major into its anterior border, the coraco-brachialis into the inner aspect of the shaft, and the deltoid, which forms the fleshy prominence of the shoulder, into the outer aspect of the shaft. Abduction and elevation, or extension of the arm outwards at the shoulder joint, are due to the supra-spinatus and deltoid; adduction or depression, to the coraco-brachialis, latissi- mus, and teres major, assisted by the weight of the limb; movement forwards and elevation, to the anterior fibres of the deltoid, pectoralis, and subscapularis; back-92 ANATOMY. ward movement to the latissimus and teres major; rota- tion outwards to the infra-spinatus and teres minor; rotation inwards to the subscapularis, pectoralis, latissi- mus, and teres major. A combination of abduction, movement forwards, adduction, and movement backwards, produces the movement of circumduction. Certain move- ments of the upper limb, however, take place not only at the shoulder joint, but between the two bones of the shoulder girdle; for in elevating the arm, whilst the supra- spinatus and deltoid initiate the movement at the shoulder joint, the farther elevation, as in raising the arm above the head, takes place by the trapezius and serratus, which rotate the scapula and draw its inferior angle forward. The free range of movement of the human shoulder is one of its most striking characters, so that the arm can be moved in every direction through space, and its efficiency as an instrument of prehension is thus greatly increased. The movement of abduction, or extension, which elevates the Fig. 22.—Outline sketch of human hu- . .. . , , • e meins. The articular area for com- arm ill line Wltll tile axis 01 plete extension lies to the right of the . . . dotted line. (After Goocisir.) the scapula, is characteristi- cally human, and a distinct articular area is provided on the head of the humerus for this movement. The Elboio Joint is the articulation between the humerus, radius, and ulna: the great sigmoid cavity of the ulna is adapted to the trochlea of the humerus, and the cup of the radius to the capitellum. The joint is enclosed by a capsular ligament lined by a synovial membrane, which is93 JOINTS AND MUSCLES—UPPER LIMB. subdivided into anterior, posterior, internal, and ex- ternal bands of fibres. Flexion and extension are the two movements of the joint, and the range of movement is limited by the locking at the end of flexion of the coronoid process into the coronoid fossa of the humerus, and at the end of extension of the olecranon process into the olecranoid fossa. The elbow joint is a hinge with screwed surfaces; the path described by the hand and fore-arm is a spiral, so that during flexion they are thrown forwards and inwards. The muscles which cause the movements are inserted into the bones of the fore-arm. The flexors are the brachialis anticus, inserted into the coronoid of the ulna, the biceps, which forms the fleshy mass on the front of the upper arm, into the tuberosity of the radius ; the supinator longus into the styloid process of the radius. The only extensor is the triceps-anconeus, which forms the fleshy mass on the back of the upper arm, and is inserted into the olecranon. The Radio-ulnar Joints are found between the two bones of the fore-arm. The head of the radius rolls in the lesser sigmoid cavity of the ulna, and is retained in position by a ring-like ligament which surrounds it the shafts of the two bones are connected together by the interosseous membrane, their lower ends by a capsular ligament and a triangular fibro-cartilage or meniscus. The radius rotates about an axis drawn through the centre of its head and the styloid process of the ulna; rotation of the fore-arm and hand forward is called pronation,—rotation backwards, supination. The supinator and pronator muscles are all inserted into the radius : the supinators are the supinator longus, supinator brevis, and the biceps; the pronators are the pronator teres and pronator quadratus. WhenANATOMY. 94 delicate manipulation is required the fore-arm is semi- flexed on the upper arm, for the cup-shaped head of the radius is then brought into contact with the capitellum of the humerus, and the rotatory movements of the bone can be performed with greater precision. The Wrist or Radio-carpcd Joint is formed above by the lower end of the radius and the triangular meniscus, below by the upper articular surfaces of the scaphoid, semi-lunar, and cuneiform bones. An investing ligament, lined by a synovial membrane, and subdivided into anterior, posterior, internal, and external bands of fibres, encloses the joint. It is the oblong form of hinge-joint, and possesses two axes, a long and a short; about the long axis movements occur which bend the hand forwards, or bring it in line with the fore-arm, or bend it backwards ; about the short axis the hand may be moved towards the radial or ulnar margins of the fore-arm. The flexors forward are the palmaris longus, inserted into the palmar fascia; the flexor carpi radialis into the metacarpal bone of the index; the flexor carpi ulnaris into the pisiform bone; the extensors and flexors backwards are the longer and shorter radial extensors inserted into the metacarpal bones of the index and middle fingers, and the ulnar extensor into the meta- carpal bone of the little finger; the flexors and extensors of the fingers have also a secondary action on the wrist joint. The ulnar flexor and ulnar extensor of the wrist draw the hand to the ulnar side, and the radial flexor and longer extensor, together with the extensors of the thumb, draw the hand towards the radial border of the fore-arm. The Carpal and Carpo-metacarpal Joints are constructed thus :—The articular surfaces are retained in contact by95 JOINTS AND MUSCLES—UPPER LIMB. dorsal ligaments passing between tlie dorsal surfaces of adjacent bones, by palmar between their palmar surfaces, and by interosseous ligaments between the semi-lunar and cuneiform, semi-lunar and scaphoid, os magnum and unci- form, os magnum and trapezoid; lateral ligaments also attach the scaphoid to the trapezium, and the cuneiform to the unciform. Similarly, the trapezoid, os magnum, and unciform are connected to the metacarpal bones of the fingers by dorsal, palmar, and interosseous ligaments, and the metacarpal bones of the fingers have a like mode of union at their carpal ends; further, a transverse ligament extends between the distal ends of the metacarpal bones of the fingers, and checks too great lateral displacement. The range of movement at any one of these carpal joints is very slight, but the multiplicity of joints in this locality con- tributes to the mobility of the wrist, and gives elasticity to the junction between the hand and fore-arm. The metacarpal bone of the thumb is not jointed to the index, and has a distinct saddle-shaped articulation with the trapezium, invested by a capsular ligament, so that its range of movement is extensive. The Metacarpophalangeal and Inter phalangeal Joints are connected by lateral ligaments passing between the bones, and by an arrangement of fibres on their dorsal and palmar surfaces. In studying the muscles which move the digits, it will be advisable, on account of the freedom and importance of the movements of the thumb, to examine its muscles inde- pendently. These muscles either pass from the fore-arm to the thumb, or are grouped together at the outer part of the palm, and form the elevation known as the ball of the96 ANATOMY. thumb; they are inserted into either its metacarpal bone or phalanges. The thumb is extended and abducted, Fig. 23.—Deep muscles of the palm of the hand. 1, abductov pollicis cut short; 2, opponens; 3 and 4, sub- divisions of flexor brevis; S, ad- ductor ; 6, 6', tendon of long flexor of thumb ; 7, abductor of the little finger; 8, short flexor; 9, opponens; 10, tendon of flexor carpi ulnaris; 11, tendon of long supinator; ft transverse metacarpal ligament. i.e., drawn away from the index, by three extensor muscles descending from the back of the fore-arm, and inserted one into the proximal end of each of its three bones, and a small muscle, specially named abductor pollicis, in- serted into the radial side of the base of the first phalanx : its bones are bent on each other by a long and short flexor muscle; the long is inserted into the base of the second, the short into the base of the first phalanx; it is drawn back to the index by an adductor muscle inserted into the ulnar side of the base of the first phalanx; and the entire thumb is thrown across the surface of the palm by the opponens pollicis, which is inserted into the shaft of the metacarpal bone. The four fingers can be either bent, or extended, or drawn asunder, i.e., abducted; or drawn together, i.e., adducted. The ungual phalanges can be bent by the action of the deep flexor muscle, the four tendons of which97 JOINTS AND MUSCLES—UPPER LIMB. are inserted into them; the second phalanges by the super- ficial flexor, also inserted by four tendons, one into each phalanx; these muscles descend from the front of the fore- arm into the palm in front of the wrist, where they are Fig 24. Tendons attached to a finger, a, the extensor tendon; f>, deep flexor; c superficial flexor; d, a lumbrical muscle; e, an interosseous muscle; l tendinous expansion from the lumbrical and interosseous muscles joining the extensor tendon. enclosed in a canal by a strong band, the anterior annular ligament, and their surfaces are invested by a synovial membrane, which facilitates their movements to and fro beneath that ligament; as they pass downwards in front of the fingers they are enclosed in a strong fibrous sheath lined by a synovial membrane, and the tendon of the super- ficial flexor is pierced by the deep flexor, so that the latter may reach the third phalanx into which it is inserted. Four rounded muscles, the lumbricales, arise in the palm from the deep flexor tendons, turn round the radial borders of the first phalanges, and are inserted one into the extensor tendon on the dorsum of each finger; these muscles bend the first phalanges on the metacarpal bones, but from their insertion into the extensor tendons they also extend the second and third phalanges on the first; as they are much used in playing stringed instruments, they have been called “ fiddlers' muscles.” The fingers are extended or straightened by muscles inserted into the back of the second and third GANATOMY. 98 phalanges ; the extensor muscles descend from the back of the fore-arm,—one, the common extensor, subdivides into four tendons, one for each finger, but in addition the index and little have each a separate extensor muscle, the tendon of which joins that of the common extensor passing to the same finger. The index finger possesses more indepen- dent movement than the other digits—hence its more frequent use as a “ pointer;” the extensor tendons of the little and ring fingers are usually united together, so that these digits are associated in their movements. Abduction and adduction of the fingers are caused by seven small muscles situated in the intervals between the metacarpal bones,—hence called interossei; four of these lie on the back of the hand, three on its palmar surface; they are inserted into the sides of the first phalanges, and either pull the fingers away from a line drawn through the middle finger or approximate them to that line. Too great abduction is checked by the trans- verse metacarpal ligament. The human hand is a perfect in- strument of prehension; not only can the individual fingers be bent into hooks, but the thumb can be thrown across the front of the palm, so that it can be opposed to the several fingers, and objects can therefore be grasped between it and them; but further, this power of opposing the thumb permits objects to be held in the palm of the hand, which may be hollowed into a cup or made to grasp a sphere. The movements of the joints are indicated on the surface of the palm by tegumentary folds,—an oblique fold for the thumb, and two oblique folds for the metacarpo-phalangeal joints of the fingers; the joints of the second and third phalanges are also marked on the surface by folds.99 JOINTS AND MUSCLES—LOWER LIMB. Joints and Muscles oe the Lower Limb. The innominate bones are connected to the spinal column by the sacro-iliac joints and the sacro-sciatic ligaments. The Sacro-iliac Joint is between the side of the sacrum and the internal surface of the ilium, the articular surfaces of which bones are covered by cartilage, and connected together by short, strong sacro-iliac ligaments. The Sacro-Sciatic ligaments stretch from the side of the sacrum and coccyx to the spine and tuberosity of the ischium. The two innominate bones are also connected together at the pubic symphysis, which is an amphiarthrodial joint. The sacro- iliac joints and pubic symphysis permit only slight move- ment; that at the former is about an imaginary axis, drawn transversely through the second sacral vertebra, which allows the base of the sacrum to be thrown forward and its apex backward in the stooping position of the body; but too great movement backward of the apex is checked by the sacro-sciatic ligaments. As the weight of the trunk, or of what may be carried in the arms or on the back, is transmitted through the hannch-bones to the lower limbs, the sacro-iliac ligaments require to be of great strength, because the sacrum, and with it the entire trunk, are sus- pended by them on the two innominate bones. The Hip Joint is a ball-and-socket joint; the ball is the head of the femur, and the socket the cup-shaped acetabu- lum in the haunch bone, the depth of the cup being in- creased by a ligament which is attached around the brim. A large capsular ligament, which is especially strengthened in front by an ilio-femoral band, encloses the articular sur-ANATOMY. 100 faces. The ligament is lined by a synovial membrane, which also invests the neck of the thigh bone. Within the joint is the round or suspensory ligament attached to the head of the thigh bone and to the sides of the depression at the bottom of the acetabulum. Whilst the hip joint possesses considerable mobility, it has much more stability than the shoulder, owing to the aceta- bulum being deeper than the glenoid fossa, and the greater strength and tension of the fibres of its capsular ligament. The muscles which move the thigh at the hip joint are situated either behind the joint, where they form the fleshy mass of the buttock, or at the front and the inner side of the thigh. They are inserted either into the femur or fascia lata, and the great and small trochanters and linea asp era serve as their principal surfaces of attach- ment. The thigh can be bent on the abdomen by the action of the psoas, iliacus, and pectineus, which lie in front of the joint; it can be extended or drawn into line with the trunk by the glutasus maximus and medius it can be abducted or drawn away from the opposite thigh by the glutasus maximus, medius, and minimus, which muscles are of large size, and form the fleshy mass of the buttocks. It can be adducted or drawn to touch its fellow, or, if slightly bent, drawn in front of its fellow, by the adductor longus, brevis, and magnus, which muscles are inserted into the linea aspera, and form the fleshy mass on the inner side of the thigh; and by the pectineus and quad- ratus femoris. It can be rotated outwards by the obturator and gemelli muscles, the glutseus maximus, pyriformis, and quadratus femoris; and rotated inwards by the glutseus medius, minimus, and tensor fasciae femoris. In standing101 JOINTS AND MUSCLES—LOWER LIMB. erect the hip joints are fully extended, and the mechanical arrangements in and around these articulations are such as to enable them to be retained in the extended position with but a small expenditure of muscular power. As the weight of the body in the erect attitude falls behind the joints, the strong anterior fibres of their capsular liga- ments are made tense, and the extended position of the joints is preserved. So long as the centre of gravity falls within the basis of support of the body, i.e., the space between the two feet when standing on both legs, the body will not fall. If the body is made to lean forward, then the capsular ligament is no longer tense, and the gluteal muscles are put in action to re-extend the trunk on the thigh, and prevent it from falling forward ; if the body is made to lean to one side or the other, the round ligament is made tense, or the strong ilio-tibial band of the fascia lata of the thigh, which stretches from the ilium to the tibia, is put on the stretch, and falling sideways is pre- vented. When, in standing erect either on one or both feet, the balance of the body is disturbed, then various muscles both of the trunk and lower limb are brought into action to assist in preserving the erect position. In the erect position the weight of the trunk is transmitted through the acetabula to the heads of the thigh-bones, but the position and connections of the round ligament enable it to suspend that portion of the trunk the weight of which is thrown upon it, and to distribute the weight over the head of the femur. The Knee is the largest and most complicated joint in the body. It consists of the femur, tibia, and patella. The patella moves up and down the trochlear surface of102 ANATOMY. the femur, whilst the condyles of the femur roll upon the semilunar cartilages and articular surfaces of the tibia. A powerful investing ligament, which is subdivided into bands, encloses the articular surfaces. One band lies on each side of the joint, viz., the internal and external lateral ligaments; one behind, a posterior; and one in front, an anterior ligament. The anterior extends from the patella to the anterior tubercle of the tibia, and serves both as a ligament and as the tendon of insertion of the extensor muscles of the leg. Within the investing ligament two interarticular or crucial ligaments pass from the inter- condyloid fossa to the upper surface of the tibia; and interposed between the tibia and femoral condyles are two menisci, which from their shape are called the semi- lunar cartilages. The synovial membrane not only lines the investing ligaments, but covers the front of the femur for some distance above the trochlea, and forms folds or pads within the joint itself, which in certain movements are interposed between the articular surfaces of the bones. The movements at this joint are those of flexion and exten- sion. The flexors are the three great muscles on the back of the thigh, called the ham-strings; they all arise from the ischial tuberosity, and are inserted—the biceps into the head of the fibula, the semi-tendinosus and semi-mem- branosus into the upper end of the tibia. The extensors form the fleshy mass on the front and outer side of the thigh; one muscle, the rectus, arises from the ilium—the others, the vasti, from the shaft of the femur; and they are all inserted by a powerful tendon into the patella, and through the anterior ligament of the knee into the tibia. . The patella is indeed a sesamoid bone, developed in theJOINTS AND MUSCLES—LOWER LIMB. 1U5 tendon of these mnscles (Fig. 18). The knee can be bent so that the calf can touch the back of the thigh, and in this position the patella is drawn down in front of the joint, as in kneeling. The articular surface of the patella is divided into seven areas or facets, and in passing from the bent to the extended position of the joint, these facets come successively into contact with the articular surface of the femur, until, when the leg is fully extended on the thigh, the whole of the patella is raised above the femoral trochlea, except the lowest pair of narrow facets. It is in order to provide a smooth surface for the patella in this position that the synovial membrane of the joint covers the front of the lower end of the femur, and the membrane is drawn upwards by the action of the small sub-crurseus muscle. At the commencement of flexion a slight rotation inwards of the leg and foot takes place through the action of the sartorius, gracilis, and semi-tendinosus, which are inserted close together into the inner surface of the shaft of the tibia; whilst the extensor muscles cause, at the com- pletion of extension, a slight rotation outwards of the leg and foot. The movements of flexion and extension are not simply in the antero-posterior plane, but along oblique paths, which are determined by the screwed configuration of the femoral condyles. In complete extension of the leg the joint is “screwed home;” and as this position is necessary for the preservation of the erect attitude, the lateral, the posterior, and the anterior crucial ligaments are then all tense, to prevent displacement of the bo res. The muscles which rotate the leg and foot inwards initiate the act of flexion by unlocking the joint. The Tibio-fibular Joints between the upper aud lower104: ANATOMY. ' ends of the bones possess investing ligaments lined by synovial membrane, and a strong interosseous ligament binds together the lower ends of the tibia and fibula. An interosseous membrane fills up the interval between their shafts. The movement between the two bones is almost inappreciable. The Ankle Joint is formed by the convex upper and the lateral surfaces of the astragalus fitting into the concavity formed by the lower end of the tibia and the two malleoli. An investing ligament, lined by synovial membrane, encloses the joint; the lateral portions of this ligament form distinct bands, and are much stronger than the anterior and posterior fibres. A diarthrodial joint also exists between the astragalus and os calcis, between which bones a powerful interosseous ligament passes. Between the astragalus and scaphoid, and the os calcis and cuboid, important diarthrodial joints are found, which are enclosed by ligamentous bands. The astragalo-scaphoid joint is completed below by the strong inferior calcaneo-scaphoid ligament, on which the head of the astragalus rests. The remaining tarsal bones are connected together usually by dorsal, plantar, and interosseous ligaments, and a similar mode of union is found between the distal row of tarsal bones and the metatarsals, except between the great toe and ento-cuneiform, where there is no interosseous ligament. The four outer metatarsals are also connected at their proximal ends by distal, plantar, and interosseous liga- ments; and further, a transverse metatarsal ligament passes between the distal ends of all the metatarsal bones. The metatarsal bones articulate with the pha- langes, and the phalanges with each other, in a similarJOINTS AND -MUSCLES—LOWEK LIMB. 105 manner to that described in the corresponding bones of the hand. At the ankle joint movements of flexion and extension take place. The dorsum of the foot is bent towards the front of the leg by the direct action of the muscles on the front of the legj more especially the tibialis anticus, inserted into the ento-cuneiform and metatarsal of great toe, and the peroneus tertius, inserted into the metatarsal of little toe. The opposite movement, the so-called extension of the foot, is due to the action of the gastrocnemius and soleus, the great muscles of the calf of the leg, which are inserted by the Tendo Achillis into the posterior prominence of the os calcis or heel. This movement is made at every step in walking or running, and the great size of the calf-muscles is in relation to their use in the act of progression. The foot cannot, however, be drawn so far back as to be brought into direct line with the leg. In standing erect the foot is at right angles to the axis of the leg, the astragalus is locked in between the two malleoli, and the fibres of the lateral ligaments are tense, so as to check movement forwards or backwards, and prevent displacement. Between the several bones of the tarsus a certain amount of gliding is permitted, more especially between the os calcis and cuboid and the astragalus and scaphoid, so that it is possible to invert or evert the foot, i.e., to raise its inner or outer borders from the ground. The inversion is performed by the tibialis anticus and by the tibialis posticus, which latter is inserted into the scaphoid bone ; the eversion by the peroneus longus and brevis muscles, situated on the outer side of the leg, the tendons of which pass behind the outer malleolus,—the brevis to be insertedANATOMY. 106 into the metatarsal bone of the little toe, the longus into the plantar surface of the metatarsal bone of the great toe. The individual toes are bent on the sole by the action of the flexor muscles inserted into the plantar surface of the phalanges, and they are straightened by the extensor muscles inserted into their dorsal surfaces; the toes also can be drawn asunder or abducted, and drawn together or adducted, chiefly by the action of the interossei muscles. The hallux or great toe is the most im- portant digit; a line prolonged backwards through it to the heel forms the proper axis of the foot, and the sole chiefly rests upon the pads of integument situated beneath its metatarso-phalangeal joint and the heel. The hallux is much more restricted in its movements than the thumb: the configuration of its tarso-metatarsal joint and the attach- ment to it of the transverse metatarsal ligament prevent the great toe from being thrown across the surface of the sole as the thumb is thrown across the palm in the move- ment of oppositionj an object can, however, be grasped between the hallux and second toe by the action of its adductor muscles, and persons can be trained to write with a pen or pencil held in this position. The act of walking consists in the movement forwards of the trank by the alternate advancement of the lower limbs. Suppose a person to be standing erect, with one leg a little in advance of the other; the body, being inclined slightly forwards, is pushed in advance by the extension of the hindmost limb, so that the weight falls more and more upon the advanced leg, which at the same time is shortened by bending the knee and ankle. The heel of the hindmost limb being then raised by the action107 JOINTS AND MUSCLES—LOWER LIMB. of the muscles of the calf, the toes press against the ground so as to push the trunk so far in front of the advanced limb as to be no longer safely supported by it; the hind- most limb is then raised from the ground by muscular action, and allowed to swing forward by its own weight, but guided by the muscles, until the toes touch the ground in front of the opposite limb. A step has now been made, and the limbs are in a corresponding but opposite position from that in which they were when the step commenced: a repetition of the act constitutes another step, and so the alternate action continues. At one moment in each step both feet touch the ground at the same time, L.e., when the hind foot presses against the earth. The act of running consists in a repetition of the movements of walking per- formed with so much greater rapidity that the feet never touch the ground at the same moment; the heels also are never brought to the ground. The propulsive action is also greatly increased by the extension of the hip and knee joints, so that a succession of small leaps on to alternate feet takes place. In leaping from the standing position the joints of both lower limbs, previously flexed, are suddenly and simultaneously extended, and the body is projected forwards with a rapid impulse. Development and Homologies of the Voluntary Muscular System. The voluntary muscles, like the hones and joints with which they are so intimately associated, are developed out of the middle of the three layers—the meso-blast—into which the germinal area or blastoderm of the young emhryo is divided. The muscles of the axial skeleton are capable of subdivision into a group situated outside the endo-skeleton, i.e., between it and the integument— which muscles have recently been called epi-skeletal—and a group lying on the ventral surface of the vertebral bodies and within the-108 ANATOMY. rib arches, which have been termed the haemal or hypo-skeletal muscles. The epi-skeletal muscles, like the vertebrae themselves, are developed within the proto-vertebrce, but it is not known if the hypo-skeletal group have the same origin. In fishes the epi- skeletal muscles preserve their fundamental arrangement with but little modification. They are disposed in transverse segments or myotonies, which equal in number the vertebrae. These myotomes are separated from each other by bands of fibrous tissue, the inter- muscular septa. In man and the higher vertebrates the simple transversely segmented arrangement is to a large extent lost. Traces are preserved, however, in the interspinales and intertransversales muscles, situated in the intervals between the spines and transverse processes of some of the vertebral segments ; in the external inter- costals and in the recti abdominis muscles, in the last-named of which tendinous bands subdivide the muscle into several transverse segments. More usually, the intermuscular septa either are not formed or disappear, and adjacent myotomes become blended into a continuous mass of muscle. In some instances the fibres of this muscle run longitudinally, and the entire mass subdivides longi- tudinally into separate and distinct parallel muscles, as is seen in the subdivision of the great erector spinal into the sacro-lumbalis, musculus acQessorius, cervicalis ascendens, longissimus dorsi, trans- versalis cervicis, trachelo-mastoid, and spinalis dorsi muscles. In other instances the muscles run obliquely ; some on the back of the body pass obliquely from below upwards and outwards, as the splenius and obliquus inferior; others obliquely from below, up- wards and inwards, as the complexus, obliquus superior, senn- spinalis, multifidus and rotatores spin®; others again, as the external and internal oblique muscles of the abdomen, extend obliquely from behind forwards to the ventral mesial line. _ Of the hypo-skeletal group of muscles, the internal intercostals dis- play the transverse segmentation. As a rule, however, the muscles of this group extend longitudinally, andform the pra-vertebral group, named anterior recti, longi colli, and psoce ; though the diaphragm, triangulares sterni, transversi abdominis, and levatores am, which lie in relation to the inner surfaces of the ribs and visceral cavities, are not longitudinal, but are specially modified in arrangement for functional reasons. The plane of demarcation between the hypo- and epi-skeletal groups of muscles, where they forml th' walls of the great visceral chambers,-the thorax and abdomen,- is marked off by the position and course of the intercostal series spinal nerves.109 JOINTS AND MUSCLES. The muscles attached to the appendicular skeleton are either limited to the limbs (purely appendicular, therefore), or pass from the axial part of the body to the limb (axi-appendicular). The axi-appen- dicular group are undoubtedly prolongations of the axial system .of muscles. They are in the upper limb derived from the epi-skeletal subdivision, and form the trapezius, rhomboid, levator anguli scapulas, latissimus dorsi, subclavius, serratus magnus, and greater and smaller pectoral muscles. In the lower limb they are in part derived from the hypo-skeletal subdivision, and foim the psoas and pyriformis; and in part, as the gluteus maximus, from the epi- skeletal subdivision. It is not improbable that the purely appen- dicular muscles are also prolongations of the axial system, and that as the limbs, in their development from their fundamental bud- like lappets, undergo both a transverse and a longitudinal seg- mentation, so the muscular mass, prolonged into them, differen- tiates both transversely and longitudinally into a motor apparatus, fitted for the performance of the special functions of each extremity.CHAPTER III. ANATOMY OF THE TEXTURES OR TISSUES. Introductory. Before proceeding to tlie description of the other organic systems of which the human body is built up, it may be well to enter into the consideration of the minute or microscopic structure of its constituent parts. These parts may primarily be divided into fluids and solids. The fluids are the blood, the lymph, the chyle, the secretions of the various glands, and of the serous and synovial membranes. The solids form the framework of the several organic systems, and assume different appearances in different localities. Sometimes they are arranged in compact solid masses, as in cartilage; at others they are elongated into fine threads or fibres, as in muscle, tendon, nerve; at others they are expanded into thin membranes, as in the fasciae or aponeuroses, the serous, synovial, and mucous membranes; at others they are hollowed out into distinct tubes for the conveyance of fluids, as in the blood-vessels, the lymph and chyle vessels, and the ducts of glands. To the solids of the body, whatever their form may be, the general name of Tissues or Textures is applied. Each organic system may be regarded as in the main composed of a tissue or texture pecub'ar to and characteristic of it-ANATOMY OF THE TEXTUEES OR TISSUES. lit self. Thus, the bones are essentially composed of the osseous tissue, the muscles of the muscular tissue, the nervous system of the nervous tissue, fibrous membranes of the fibrous or connective tissue, &c. But though the essential constituent of each organic system is a tissue peculiar to that system, yet in most localities certain other tissues are mingled with that which is to be regarded as the characteristic texture of the part. In a muscle, for example, not only is the muscular tissue present, but mingled with it are connective tissue, nerve tissue, blood- vessels, and lymph-vessels. A gland also not only consists of its proper tissue, the secreting cells, but of more or less connective tissue, nerves, blood and lymph vessels, and gland ducts. Indeed, there are few localities in which, along with the proper tissue of the part, blood and lymph vessels, nerves and connective tissue, are not found] and to a part built up of two or more tissues the name of an Organ is applied. Thus the muscular system consists of the series of organs which we call the muscles, the gland- ular system of the several organs called glands, and so on. Each tissue and each organ, into the construction of which that tissue enters as the characteristic texture, possesses not only distinctive structural, but also distinctive functional properties. Thus the muscular tissue is characterised by the property of contractility, and the muscles, of which it forms the essential texture, are organs of motion or locomotion • the osseous tissue is characterised by its hardness and strength, and the bones, of which it forms the essential texture, are organs of protection and support. But the study of the textures embraces an inquiry not only into the special, structural, and functional propertiesANATOMY. 112 of each tissue and organ—into the special part which each plays in the animal economy—but the consideration of their properties as living structures. It would be out of place in this work to enter into a discussion of the mean- ing of the term Life, or Living, or to attempt an analysis of the various definitions of the term which have been suggested from time to time by different philosophers. It will suffice for our present purpose to adopt the old Aristotelian definition, and to speak of Life as the faculties of self-nourishment, self-growth, and self-decay. All the tissues, over and above the special properties which they possess, have the power of growing, and of maintaining themselves in full structural perfection and functional activity for a given period of time. After a time they begin to exhibit signs of diminished perfection and activity, they degenerate or decay ■ ultimately they die, and the entire organism of which they form the constituent parts is resolved by the putrefactive process into more simple forms of matter. r General Considerations on Cells. The simplest form of organic matter capable of ex- hibiting the phenomena of life is called Cyto-blastema or Protoplasm. It possesses a viscous or jelly-like con- sistency. Under the highest powers of the microscope it seems to be homogeneous, or dimly granulated, like a sheet of ground glass. Not only can it assimilate nutri- ment and increase in size, but it possesses the power of spontaneous movement and contractility. It enters in a very important manner into the structure of the bodiesGENERAL CONSIDERATIONS ON CELLS. 113 of tlie lower animals. The elongated processes, or pseudo- podia, to which Dujardin applied the name of sarcode, which the Rhizopoda can project from their surface into the surrounding medium, and again with- draw into their substance, consist of protoplasm, and may be cited as fur- nishing excellent examples of its motive and contractile power. From the recent researches of Haeckel it would appear that protoplasm is capable of forming, without the super- addition of any other structure, inde- pendent organisms, which stand at pldsm' the lowest grade of organisation, and from their extreme simplicity are named by him Monera (Fig. 25). To the group Monera belong the genera Protamceba, Protogenes, and Bathybius. Of these, Bathybius is that which has attracted most attention. It has been regarded as a layer of soft slimy undifferentiated protoplasm covering the bottom of the deep sea, and capable of exhibiting the phenomena of contractility, growth, assimilation of food, and reproduction. Doubts, however, have been expressed regarding the nature of this Bathybius, so that it can- not now be cited as so definite an organism as the freely-swimming Protamoeba and Protogenes. Haeckel has referred these simple organisms to a sub-kingdom of Protista, which he considers to lie on the confines of both the animal and vegetable kingdoms. To a mass of protoplasm, whether it forms, as in one of these Protista, an independent organism, or is merely a portion of the substance of the body of a higher organism, Haeckel has H114 ANATOMY. given the general name of a Cytode. Sometimes a cytode is a naked clump of soft protoplasm, ■without a trace of differentiation either on its surface or in its substance, as in the freely-moving Monera ; at others the peripheral part of the cytode hardens, and differentiates into a more or less perfect envelope, as in the genera Protomonas and Protomyxa. So far back as 1861, Lionel Beale had de- scribed, under the name of germinal matter (Bioplasm), minute living particles of vegetable protoplasm, and in 1863 he demonstrated the presence of extremely minute particles of living matter in the blood. More recently Strieker has also called attention, in the bodies of the higher animals, to minute detached clumps of protoplasm which exhibited the phenomena of life. As a rule, however, in both vegetable and animal organisms the specks or clumps of protoplasm assume definite shapes, and show evidence of an internal differentiation. In the midst of a minute clump of this substance a sharply- defined body called a nucleus is found, which differs from the surrounding proto- plasm in not being contractile; and some- times a minute speck, or nucleolus, exists within the nucleus. When a definite clump fig. 2g.—a simple 0f protoplasm contains a nucleus in its in- form of mi- 1 1 cleated cell, p, terjor whether a nucleolus be present or protoplasm cell- ? nucieus-Af nu- not> ^ is called a Nucleated Cell (Fig. ciuoius. ’ 26). Cells ’are definite anatomical and physiological units, and exhibit all the phenomena of life. Some of the lowest organisms consist merely of a single cell, others of two or more cells united together,GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS ON CELLS. 115 and. these are called uni- or multi-cellular organisms. Cells also enter in the most material manner into the constitution of the textures of all the higher forms of plants and animals. Not unfrequently the peripheral part of the protoplasm of the cell differentiates into a distinct investing envelope, technically named a cell wall or cell membrane, In the earlier periods of investigation into the minute structure of cells it was believed that a cell wall was con- stantly present, and that each cell was a minute micro- scopic vesicle or bladder, which in its typical shape was globular or ovoid, but capable of undergoing various modi- fications both in form and chemical composition. The material enclosed by the cell wall was termed the cell con- tents, and either in the midst of these contents or in con- tact with the cell wall was the nucleus, which might or might not contain a nucleolus. Schwann believed that the cell wall was the most active constituent of the cell, i.e., pos- sessed the power not only of producing chemical and physical changes in its own substance and in the cell contents, but of separating materials from the surrounding media,—of secreting them, as it were, into the interior of the cell. In this manner he accounted for the formation in some cells of fat, in others of pigment, in others of the characteristic secretion of glands, and so on. It was then maintained by John Goodsir that the nucleus was the part of a cell which in all probability was concerned in separating and preparing its characteristic cell contents, and in its nutrition. Martin Barry and Goodsir also contended that the reproduction and multi- plication of cells were due to self-division of the nucleus,116 ANATOMY. which was thus the source of successive broods of young cells. They gave to the nucleus, therefore, an importance in the economy of the cell greater than had previously been assigned to it. As the investigations into cell structure became more extended, it was ascertained that a cell wall was by no means always present; that in many of the cells in which it had been supposed to exist it could not satisfactorily be demonstrated, and that in others, more especially in young actively-growing cells, no trace of an investing envelope could be observed. Hence the importance of the cell wall as an essential component of a cell was still further diminished: and Leydig then defined a cell to be a little mass composed of a soft substance enclosing a central nucleus. But a most important advance in our conceptions of the essential structure of a cell was made when Briicke pointed out that the contents of cells not unfre- quently possessed the property of spontaneous move- ment and contractility, and when Max Schultze deter- mined that the contractile substance termed sarcode, which forms so large a part of the bodies of the lower animals, was analogous and apparently homologous with the contents of young actively-growing animal and vege- table cells, before a differentiation of these contents into special secretions or other materials had taken place. As the term “ protoplasm” had been introduced by Von .Mohl to express the contents of the vegetable cell, which under- goes changes in the process of growth, it was adopted by the animal histologist; and Max Schultze suggested that a cell should be defined to be a nucleated mass of protoplasm,—a definition which is adopted in thisGENERAL CONSIDERATIONS ON CELLS. 117 book. Now, as protoplasm, whether it occurs along with a nucleus in the form of a cell, or in independent clumps or cytodes, exhibits not merely the property of contrac- tility, but the power of growing and maintaining itself, it is regarded as the functionally active constituent of the cell. And thus our conceptions as to the part of the cell in which its functional activity resides have passed through three phases. In the first, the cell wall; in the second, the nucleus; in the third, the protoplasm cell contents, or cell substance, has been looked upon as the active constituent, not only as regards its nutrition, but the reproduction cf young cells. But though the protoplasm can of itself perform these offices, yet there can be no doubt, as Barry and Goodsir were the first to show, that the nucleus of the cell plays a part not unfrequently in the multiplication of cells by self-division. One of the most characteristic cells is the mammalian ovum. In it a cell wall exists, known as the zona pellucida or vitelline membrane ; within this envelope is the granular yelk or cell contents, in the midst of which is imbedded the nucleus ox germinal vesicle, which in its turn contains the nucleolus Flw,zonf pX or germinal spot. The granules of ydk ? Vfkdieusf “"Ver- ,, n • , . , minal vesicle; IVY, nucleolus, the yelk are a special metamorphosis or germinal spot. of the protoplasm cell substance. Schwann made the important generalisation that the tissues of the animal body are composed of cells, or of materials derived from cells, “ that there is one universal principle of development for the elementary part ofANATOMY. 118 organisms, however different, and that this principle is the formation of cells.” The ovum is the primordial or fundamental cell, or germ-cell, from which, after being fertilised by the male sperm, the tissues and organs of the animal body are derived. Within the fertilised ovum multiplication of cells takes place with great rapidity. It is as yet an unsettled question how far the original nucleus of the ovum participates in this process of multiplication; but there can be no doubt that the protoplasm cell contents divide, first into two, then four, then eight, then sixteen segments, and so on in multiple proportion. Each of these segments of protoplasm con- tains a nucleus—is, in short, a nucleated cell, and the protoplasm of these cells exhibits the property of con- tractility. The ovum or germ-cell is therefore the imme- diate parent of all the new cells which are formed within it, and mediately it is the parent of all the cells which, in the subsequent processes of development and growth, are descended from those produced by the segmentation of the yelk. The process of development of young cells within a parent cell, whether it occurs in the ovum or in a cell derived by descent from the ovum, is called the endogenous reproduction of cells. But cells may multiply by a process of fission—i.e., a constriction, gradually deep- ening, may take place in a cell until it is subdivided into two; the nucleus at the same tune participating in the constriction and subdivision. A third mode of multipli- cation of cells is by budding: little clumps of protoplasm bud out from the protoplasm of the parent cell, become detached, and assume an independent vitality. If a nucleus differentiates in the interior of such a clump, itGENERAL CONSIDERATIONS ON CELLS. 119 becomes a cell; if it remains as a mere clump of proto- plasm, it is a cytode. These various methods of multiplication are all con- firmatory of Schwann’s generalisation of the descent or derivation of cells from pre-existing cells. But as the nucleated cell, either with or without a cell wall, is not, in the present state of science, regarded as the simplest and most elementary unit capable of exhibiting vital pheno mena, and as these phenomena can be displayed by indi vidual clumps of protoplasm, without the presence of a nucleus, some modification of the doctrine, as regards the formation of the tissues from nucleated cells, seems to be necessary. For, although there can be no doubt that all the tissues are mediately derived from the ovum or funda- mental cell, and that most of the tissues are derived directly from nucleated cells, yet there is reason to think that a differentiation of a cytode clump of protoplasm into tissue may take place, so that the direct formation of such a tissue would be, not from a nucleated cell, but from the more simple cytode. Hence a more comprehensive gene- ralisation, to which observers have gradually been led from the consideration of numerous facts, has now been arrived at,—that the tissues and organs of the body, what- ever may be their form and composition, are formed of protoplasm, or produced by its differentiation ; and that the protoplasm itself is derived by descent from the proto- plasm substance of the primordial germ-cell. Some, in- deed, have contended that protoplasm, cells, and their derivatives can arise by a process of precipitation or aggregation of minute particles or molecules in an or- ganic infusion, and that living matter may be thus spon-120 ANATOMY. taneously generated. But tlie evidence which has been advanced in support of this hypothesis is by no means satisfactory or conclusive, whilst the correctness of the theory of the direct descent of protoplasm from pre-existing living protoplasm is supported by thou- sands of observations made by the most competent in- quirers. In the process of conversion of protoplasm into the several tissues, a differentiation of form and structure (i.e., a morphological or histological differentiation), and of composition (i.e., a chemical differentiation) takes place, the result of which is a physiological differentiation, and the tissues and organs become adapted to the performance of special functions. Hence arise the several forms of tissue which occur in the human body and in the higher animals. Many of the tissues consist exclusively of cells, which present in different parts of the body characteristic modifications in external configuration, in composition, and in properties, as may be seen in the fatty tissue, pig- mentary tissue, and epithelium. Other tissues, again, consist partly of cells, and partly of an intermediate material which separates the constituent cells from each other. Here also the cells present various modifications; and the intermediate material, termed the matrix or intercellular substance, varies in structure, in composi- tion, and in properties in the different textures, as is seen in the connective, cartilaginous, osseous, and muscu- lar tissues. It is not an easy matter to devise a classification of the tissues, based on their structural characters, whicli shall be in all respects logically perfect; but a con-GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS ON CELLS.

Cells Suspended in Fluids. The fluids of the body which have cells or other minute solid particles suspended in them are the blood, the lymph, and the chyle. Sometimes cells are found floating in the secretions of glands. The Blood. The blood is the well-known red fluid which circulates throughout the blood-vascular system. As its general composition and properties have to be considered in physiological rather than anatomical works, the solid particles only, which are suspended in the liquor sanguinis, will be described here. If a drop of human blood be examined under the microscope, crowds of minute bodies, the blood corpuscles, or blood globules, may be seen in it. These present two different appearances, and are dis- tinguished by the names of red and white blood corpuscles. The red corpuscles, which are by far the more numerous, are minute circular discs, slightly concave on both surfaces. Their average diameter is about ^^-j-th of an inch, and their thickness about jth of that measurement; hence theyANATOMY. 122 are not spheres, as the old name blood globules would imply, They are non-nucleated. Single corpuscles have a faint fawn-coloured hue, but collectively they give to the blood its characteristic red colour. This colour is due to the presence in the corpuscles of the substance termed hcemoglobin. It has been estimated by Vierordt and Welcker that 5,000,000 red corpuscles are present in every cubic millimetre of healthy human blood. The red corpuscles in the blood of all mammals, except the tribe of camels, are circular bi-concave discs ; but in these exceptional mammals they have an elliptical outline. In all mammals the red corpuscles are non-nucleated, though appearances of nucleation have been seen in exceptional individual cases; for Iiolleston saw a nucleated appearance in a small proportion of the dried red blood corpuscles of a two-toed sloth; and I have observed in a proportion of the red blood discs of a Hoffmann's sloth an appearance of a central nucleus. In all birds, reptiles, and amphibia the red corpuscles are oval or elliptical, and in each corpuscle an oval pr elliptical nucleus is situated. In all fishes they are nu- cleated and also elliptical in form, except in some of the Cyclostomata, which possess circular discs. In the ellip- tical nucleated corpuscles the surfaces are not biconcave, but have central projections, which correspond in position to the nucleus (2, 4, 5, Fig. 28). The red corpuscles vary materially in size in different vertebrata, and these variations have been especially studied by Gulliver. He has found them to vary in mammals from an average diameter of -j^yth of an inch in the elephant, and -j^g-th in Orycteropus capensis, to y^ l^-j-th in Tragulus javani-123 THE BLOOD. cus, and lie concludes that the smallest blood discs occur in the small species of an order or family, the largest in the large species. and vary in length Fig. 28.—1, red corpuscles of human blood ; 2, red corpuscles of blood of common fowl, seen on from an average of the surface and edgeways; 3, red corpuscles of frnrr.

In amphibia the largest corpuscles, accord- ing to Gulliver, are about inch in length in Proteus and Siren, though Riddell states that in Amphiuma tridactylum they are id larger ; whilst the smallest, as in the common frog, average in length ? inch. In cartilaginous fish the corpuscles are larger than in osseous. In Lamna cor- nubica Gulliver found their long diameter to be inch ; while in the Salmonidse, which have the largest blood discs among osseous fish, the long diameter in the salmon and common trout is only about xst'B inch. The white or colourless corpuscles are comparatively few in number in the healthy human blood. Welcker has estimated the normal relative number as one white to 335 red; in pregnant and menstruating women the pro- portion is increased to about 1 to 280. Tn some forms of In birds they are larger than in mam- mals, and vary in length from an ave- rage of inch in Casuarius javanicus to -g-jlj-g-th in Linaria minor. In reptiles they are still larger, 1 2 3 5 6 frog; 4, of Sgualus squatina; 5, of LopliinsANATOMY. 124 disease the proportion is so very materially increased that they appear to be almost as numerous as the red. They are rounded in form, finely granulated or mulberry-like in appearance, and nucleated—the nucleus becoming more distinct after the addition of acetic acid; moreover, they are larger than the red corpuscles, their average diameter being from ^^-g-th to 3-oV'oth of an inch. Corpuscles of a similar form are found in the blood of all vertebrata. They do not vary so much in size in different animals as do the red corpuscles. In Triton, according to Gul- liver, their average diameter is 2 0*0 0th, whilst in Ilerpestes griseus they are not more than inch. The white blood corpuscles are minute nucleated clumps of proto- plasm ; they are therefore minute cells. It is very doubt- ful if they possess a cell wall, the evidence being against rather than in favour of its presence. The red blood corpuscles in all vertebrata, except the mammalia, are nucleated clumps of protoplasm; they are therefore minute cells. In mammals, owing to the ab- sence of a nucleus, they do not accord with the definition of a cell given on p. 116, and they are not therefore morphologically identical with the red corpuscles in other vertebrates. What their precise homology may be is some- what difficult to say, owing to the obscurity which prevails as to their exact origin. If they are merely clumps of specially modified protoplasm, budded off from the white corpuscles, then they are cytodes. If, as some have sup- posed, they are the nuclei of the white corpuscles, specially modified in composition, then they are free nuclei. If, again, they are the white corpuscles, the cell substance of which has undergone a special differentiation, and the125 THE BLOOD. nucleus has disappeared, then they are potentially cells, though no nucleus is visible. Whatever may be their exact homology, there can be no doubt that the non-nucleated mammalian red corpuscle, and the substance of the nu- cleated red corpuscle which lies outside the nucleus, aie functionally identical with each other; the protoplasm hav- ing undergone a special chemical differentiation into hsemo- globin, a proximate principle characterised by containing iron as its essential constituent. The action of water, spirit, acids, alkalies, various gases, heat, cold, and electri- cal currents, on the red corpuscles has been studied by several observers, and the conclusion has been reached that the corpuscles consist of a “ stroma,” with which the colouring matter is blended, but from which it may be separated without the stroma affording any evidence of the presence of an investing envelope or membrane. When blood is drawn from the vessels the red corpuscles, in about half a minute, run together into piles, like rouleaux of coins (Fig. 29), which arrange themselves into irregular meshes. In inflammatory diseases, and in the blood of pregnant women, the piles of corpuscles form more readily, and at the same time sink rapidly below the surface of the fluid, so as to cause the “buffy coat” seen in the blood coagulum. In the healthy blood of horses a buffy coat is formed as a natural condition of the coagulation. One of the most curious properties possessed by the living white blood corpuscle is that of protruding delicate processes from its circumference, which processes may change their shape, or be again withdrawn into the sub- stance of the corpuscle, which then resumes its former circular outline. These processes resemble the sarcode126 .ANATOMY. prolongations wliicli Amoeba and other Rhizopods can pro- ject from various parts of their circumference (Fig. 25); and as a white blood corpuscle, like an Amoeba, can by the movements of the processes change its position, the term “amoeboid movements” has been applied to the pheno- mena in question. Like an Amoeba, also, a white corpuscle can by these movements include within its substance minute particles of solid matter which it may come in Fig. 29.—1, red corpuscles of healthy human hlood; 2, red corpuscles beginning to form rouleaux; 3, mesh-lilce arrangement in healthy blood; 4, mesh-like arrangement in huffy blood, where the meshes are larger than in healthy- blood. contact with in its path. Thirty years ago W. Addison stated that the white blood corpuscles could pass through the walls of the blood-vessels into the surrounding tissue, where they formed mucus corpuscles, and, under certain pathological conditions, the corpuscles of pus or inflam- matory lymph. The passage of white blood corpuscles through the wall of the capillaries was seen in 1846 by A. Waller; and though for many years his observations were ignored, yet the more recent inquiries of CohnheimTHE BLOOD. 127 and others into the subject have anew directed attention to them. It is now generally admitted that the migration of these corpuscles from the blood through the wall of the capillaries into the tissues does take place, and that they may then “ wander ” to and fro, owing to the mobility of their contractile protoplasm. These migrated corpuscles are also believed to play an important part in many physiological and pathological processes. But the blood contains, in addition to the red and white corpuscles, still more minute particles, which are, however, inconstant in number. Minute globules have been de- scribed by Beale and Max Schultze, which are probably detached fragments of protoplasm budded off from the white corpuscles; and Zimmermann has described, as elementary corpuscles, minute particles, which are appar- ently derived from broken-up red corpuscles. In the very young embryo the blood corpuscles, like the capillary blood-vessels themselves, are formed by special differentiation of the mesoblast cells of the vascular area, the nuclei of which multiply by fission and form the em- bryonic blood corpuscles, which at first are colourless, but afterwards assume a red colour. In mammals the earliest red blood corpuscles are nucleated and larger than the future red discs, but as development goes on, non-nucleated red corpuscles appear, and as their number increases, both absolutely and relatively with the progress of the foetus, in course of time all the nucleated red corpuscles have dis- appeared, and are replaced by the non-nucleated discs. In adults the red corpuscles are believed to be derived from the white corpuscles, though the exact process of meta- morphosis has not been satisfactorily ascertained. It is128 ANATOMY. also believed that red corpuscles may be new-formed in the spleen, and Neumann has recently stated that the cells of the red marrow of the bones may serve as a centre of origin for the red blood corpuscles. In the foetus the liver apparently serves as a centre of origin for the white corpuscles, but its blood corpuscle forming function ceases at the time of birth. Throughout extra-uterine life the spleen and the lymphatic glands are without doubt organs of formation of the colourless corpuscles,—those produced in the lymph- atic glands, under the name of lymph corpuscles, being mingled with the blood-stream where the fluid lymph flow's into the venous system. When mixed with the blood, the lymph corpuscles become the white blood corpuscles. Corpuscles are also found in the blood of the inverte- brata. They are as a rule colourless, but R. Wagner pointed out that in the Cephalopods they are coloured. They are sometimes round, at others oval or fusiform, and in worms and insects have even branched processes. They are always nucleated. The Lymph and Chyle. The lymph is the fluid found in a subdivision of the vascular system named the lymph vascular system. It is transparent and colourless, and contains numerous cor- puscles floating in it, which correspond, in appearance, structure, and the possession of the property of amoeboid movements, to the white corpuscles of the blood. The lymph corpuscles are formed in the glands situated in the course of the lymph vessels, and are carried away from the glands by the stream of lymph which flows through them.129 CELLS PLACED ON FREE SURFACES. The chyle is a milky fluid found during the period of digestion in the delicate lacteal vessels which pass from the walls of the intestine. The lacteals join the lymphatics at the back of the abdomen to form the thoracic duct in which the lymph and chyle become mingled together. The chyle contains corpuscles similar to the lymph corpuscles, which are apparently derived from the lymph glands in the mesentery, through wdiich the chyle flows on its way to the thoracic duct. The fluid of the lymph, the chyle, and the blood, in which the corpuscles are suspended, is some- times described as a fluid intercellular substance. Cor- puscles possessing the type of structure of the lymph corpuscles, are named lymphoid cells or leucocytes. Cells are also met with floating free in the secretions formed in the interior of some of the glands. They are more particularly found in the secretion of mucus from the mucous glands, and of saliva from the salivary glands (fig. 33, B). They are round, colourless, nucleated cor- puscles, and are not unlike the white corpuscles of the blood. SECOND GROUP OF TISSUES. Cells placed on Free Surfaces. By the term Free Surface is meant a surface which is not blended with or attached to adjacent structures, but is free or separable from them without dissection. Every free surface is covered by one or more layers of cells. It has been customary to name these cells Epithelium, and to speak of a simple or a stratified epithelium, according as I130 ANATOMY. the cells are arranged in one or in several layers. But it has recently been suggested by His that the cells lining the inner surface of the wall of the vascular and serous canals and cavities should be termed Endothelium, whilst the cells covering the mucous surfaces should form the Epithelium properly so-called. The cells situated on the free surface of the skin, though usually termed the epidermis or cuticle, may also be referred to the epithelial structures. Speak- ing generally, one may say that by the term Epithelium is meant the cells situated on free surfaces which are exposed either directly or indirectly to the air; whilst by the term Endothelium is meant the cells situated on free surfaces which are not exposed either directly or indirectly to the air. Epithelium. The free surfaces covered by an epithelium are the mem- branes, named, from the character of their secretion, the mucous membranes, and the skin. The Mucous Membranes line internal passages and canals, and are continuous at certain orifices with the skin,—e.g., the mucous membrane of the alimentary canal opens on the surface at the mouth and anus; the mucous membrane of the respiratory passage opens on the surface at the nostrils, and is continuous in the pharynx with the alimentary mucous membrane—it is also prolonged through the Eusta- chian tube into the tympanum, and is continuous through the nasal duct with the conjunctiva; the genito-urinary mucous membrane opens on the surface at the orifice of the urethra and vagina. Mucous membranes also line the ducts of the various glands which open on the surface either of the skin131 EPITHELIUM. or the several mucous canals. The epithelial cells are as a rule arranged in layers or strata, and the shape of the cells is by no means uniform in the different layers. The cells of the deeper strata are usually smaller, softer, more rounded, and more recently formed than those of the super- ficial strata, though sometimes, as in the bladder, conjunc- tiva, and some other mucous surfaces, they may be irregular in form and size, or even elongated into short columns. The cells next the free surface have a tendency to be shed, and their place is then taken by the cells of the deeper layers, which become modified in form as they approach the surface. The form of the cells of the superficial layer varies in different localities, which has led to a division of epithelium into groups bearing appropriate names. Epithe- lium is distinguished further by being devoid of blood- vessels, i.e., it is non-vascular; and also, with some excep- tions, devoid of nerves, i.e., non-sensitive. The epithelial cells, whether arranged in one or several strata, rest upon a subjacent tissue, which, from its rela- tion to the cells, may be called sub-epithelial. The sub- epithelial tissue is a form of the fibrous variety of connec- tive tissue, to be subsequently described, and in it lie the nerves, the blood and lymph vessels, and the involuntary muscular tissue of the skin and mucous membranes; hence it is sometimes described as a fibro-vascular tissue or corium. It was for a long time believed that, between the deeper sur- face of the epithelium and the corium, a definite, homo- geneous, continuous membrane, named by Bowman a base- ment membrane, intervened, which formed a sharp line of demarcation between the epithelial and the sub-epithelial tissue. Bowman, however, himself admitted that in some132 ANATOMY. of the localities where this membrane was theoretically sup- posed to exist it could not satisfactorily be demonstrated; and it is probable that the tissue on which the epithelium rests is only a somewhat condensed form of the sub-epithe- lial connective tissue, which assumes in some localities a membrane-like appearance. The recent observations of H. Watney, indeed, show that, in the mucous membrane of the alimentary canal, a delicate reticulum of connective tissue is prolonged between the epithelial cells. The corium is also the seat of numerous glands, with their blood and lymph vessels and nerves; and the epithelial lining of the glands is continuous at their orifices with the epithelial in- vestment of the corium. The surface both of the mucous membianes and skin is usually more or less undulated sometimes it is thrown into strong folds or rugae, at others it is elevated into minute, frequently conical, processes, named in some localities papillae, in others villi; but in all these cases the epithelium is prolonged as a continuous cover- ing ovei the undulating free surface. The free surface of all mucous membranes is kept moist by the secretion or mucus which lubricates it. under the special name of the horny layer of the cuticle or epidermis, the superficial in- Fig. 30.—Scaly epithelium from the mucous membrane of the mouth. Tessellated, pavement, scaly, or squamous epithelium is situ- ated on the free surface of the mucous lining of the mouth, pharynx, oesophagus, vestibular entrance to the nose, ocular conjunctiva, and entrance to the urethra and vagina. It forms133 EPITHELIUM. vestment of tlie skin. Its cells are nucleated, flattened scales, varying in diameter from g^-pth to -rg10-5-tli inch. Those in the same layer, being in contact by their edges, form a tessellated, pavement-like arrangement, whilst the cells in adjacent layers have their flattened surfaces in con- tact with each other. Sometimes the cells have jagged, prickle-like edges, or fluted surfaces, and usually they con- tain scattered granular particles. In the formation of this epithelium a morphological differentiation of the protoplasm of the rounded cells of the deeper strata into flattened scales, and at the same time a chemical differentiation of their soft contents into a horny material, have occurred. Columnar or cylindrical epithelium is situated on the free surface of the mucous lining of the alimentary canal from the oesophageal orifice of the stomach to the anus ; it is prolonged into the ducts of variorrs glands which open on the alimentary mucous membrane; it covers the mucous linina: of the urethra and the mucous membrane of the O gall bladder. Its cells are elongated, cylindrical columns, about -g-g-g-th inch long, placed side by side like a row of palisades, and with their long axes perpendicular to the surface on which the cells rest. Some- n . Fig. 31.—Columnar epithelium. A, side view times the cells are uni- of a group of cells; B, larger free end of a group of cells; C, a striated columnar cell formly cylindrical ; at from intestinal villus. other times they are compressed at the sides; at others they vary in circumference,—the broader end, lying next the surface, being rounded or polygonal; the deeper or at- tached end being narrower and more pointed. The nuclei are distinct, and the cell contents are finely granular.134 ANATOMY. Usually this epithelium forms only a single layer of cells. The columnar cells which cover the intestinal villi have a clear space at their broad free ends, which is often streaked with fine parallel lines (Fig. 31, C). Intermingled with the cells of the columnar epithelium of the alimentary canal are small goblet-shaped cells. Ciliated epithelium is situated on the free surface of the nasal mucous membrane, which extends into the air-sinuses within the cranial bones, into the nasal duct and lachry- mal sac, into the Eustachian tube and tympanum; on the free surface of the mucous membrane of the windpipe as far as the terminal branches of the bronchial tubes; on the mucous surface of the uterus and Fallopian tubes; on the mucous lining of the commencement of the vas deferens, and on the lining membrane of the ventricles of the brain and central canal of the spinal cord. It generally consists of columnar cells, which have at their free ends extremely slender, soft, pellucid, hair-like processes, or cilia. These cilia are specially differentiated at the free ends of the epithelium cells from which they project. Beale states that the soft bioplasm (protoplasm) of the body of the cell is prolonged along the Fig. 32.—Ciliated epithelium axis of each cfiium, whilst the peri- cells. ’ 1 phery possesses the firmer consistence of formed or differentiated material. During life these processes move rapidly to and fro in the fluid which moistens the surface of the membrane ou which this form of epithelium is situated. In the human body the cilia are not more than from -j^fftli to j-gVoth length; but iu various marine invertebrata they are bothEPITHELIUM. 135 longer and stronger. Sometimes, as in the lining mem- brane of the cerebral ventricles and central canal of the spinal cord, the cells carrying the cilia are either spheroidal or cylindrical. Cilia occasion currents in the fluid in which they move, and play an important part in the economy of many animals; in some of the invertebrata they serve as organs of locomotion, in others they propel currents over respiratory surfaces, and in others aid in bringing food within the animal’s reach. Spheroidal or glandular epithelium is situated on the free surface of the follicles or ultimate secreting apparatus of glands, and the commencement of gland ducts. The cells are often spheroidal in form, though not unfrequently they are polyhedral. Their contents are specially differentiated into the secretion of the particular gland in which they are situated. The epithelial cells of a Secreting Gland rest upon a sub- epithelial tissue. Not unfrequently this tissue has the appearance of a membrane; it represents, indeed, the basement membrane of Bowman, and is called memhrana propria. Deeper Fig. 33.—A, polyhedral gland cells from than this apparent mem- the liver; B, spheroidal gland cells from 1x _ the saliva. brane is a delicate con- nective tissue in which the blood and lymph vessels and the nerves of the gland ramify. The anatomical struc- tures necessary for secretion are cells, blood-vessels, lymph- vessels, and nerves. The blood-vessels convey the blood from which the secretion has to be derived; the cells, as Goodsir showed by a variety of proofs, are the active agents in separating the secretion from the blood; the136 ANATOMY. nerves regulate the size of the blood-vessels, and there- fore the amount of blood which circulates through the gland, and also exercise some direct influence on the activity of the cells. The function of the lymph-vessels is not so well understood, but the researches of Ludwig and of some of his pupils have shown their relation to the secreting structure of several glands. The connective tissue and the membrana propria are merely supporting structures for the cells, vessels, and nerves. All secreting glands have the same general type of structure, though they differ from each other, as will be pointed out when the individual glands are described, in the degree of complexity in which their constituent parts are arranged. The simplest form of gland is a short tube, closed at its deep end, whilst the opposite end has a mouth opening on a free surface, as in the glands of the intestine; but in other cases the tube may branch at its deep end, as in the glands of the stomach • or it may become greatly elon- gated and rolled into a ball, as in the sweat glands; or it may branch, and the branches may form coils and loops, as in the kidney; or the tube may branch, and the branches may dilate into sac-like expansions, or acini, as in the compound racemose group of glands, of which the salivary glands, the mammae, the lachrymal glands, and the pancreas are good examples. Transitional epithelium is the name applied to epithelial cells, situated on some free surfaces, which possess transi- tional forms either between the columnar and tessellated epithelia, or the columnar and spheroidal, and not unfre- quently have a cubical shape. The epithelium of the mucous lining of the bladder is transitional between theEPITHELIUM. 137 columnar and scaly varieties; and in many glands the continuity of the epithelial layer from the spheroidal epi- thelium of the gland-follicles to the columnar epithelium of the gland-ducts is preserved by the interposition of inter- mediate transitional forms of cells. The epithelial surfaces of the upper part of the mucous lining of the nose and of the back of the tongue are specially modified in connection with the senses of smell and taste localised in those regions, as will afterwards be considered when their anatomy is described. Both the upper germinal layer, or epiblast, and the under, or hypoblast layer of the embryo serve as surfaces of origin for epithelial cells, and it is believed that the epithelial covering of the genito-urinary mucous membrane is derived from a differentiation of certain of the cells of the middle germinal layer or mesoblast. The cells of the hypoblast give origin to the epithelium of the alimentary canal below the mouth, and to the epithelium of the various glands which open into this part of the digestive tract; also to the epithelial fining of the windpipe and air cells. The cells of the epiblast give origin to the epidermal covering of the skin, the epithelial lining of the sweat glands, seba- ceous glands, and mammse, which open on the surface of the skin; also to the epithelial fining of the mouth and the salivary glands opening into it; also to the epithelial lining of the nose and of the glands connected with its mucous membrane. But, further, the epithelial cells fining the cerebral ventricles, the central canal of the spinal cord, and the membranous labyrinth, are primarily derived from the cells of the epiblast. For though these canals and spaces are, when development is completed, shut off from all con-138 ANATOMY. nection with the outer surface of the body, yet they are originally continuous with the layer of epiblast, and only become discontinuous with it when from the great develop- ment of the adjacent part of the mesoblast, required for the formation of the bony walls which enclose the laby- rinth and cerebro-spinal nervous axis, the original connec- tion is severed. Endothelium. The free surfaces covered by an endothelium are the serous membranes, the inner surface of the walls of the lymph and blood vessels and of the heart, the synovial membranes of joints, of synovial sheaths and bursae. The tubes, canals, and cavities lined by an endothelium are shut off from all communication with the external atmo- sphere. The cells of the endothelium are arranged so as to give perfect smoothness to the surface which they cover. In the blood and lymph vessels this smoothness of surfacq is in order to facilitate the flow of the blood and lymph in the course of the circulation. The serous and synovial membranes are found covering the surfaces of parts which move on each other, and the smoothness of their respective surfaces, by permitting freedom of movement, diminishes the friction. Endothelial cells form only a single layer, and are, as a rule, flattened scale-like cells, arranged after the manner of a tessellated epithelium. Endothelium, like epithelium, is non-vascular, and, so far as is known, non-nervous. The endothelial cells rest upon a sub-endothelial tissue, consisting of the fibrous variety of connective tissue.139 ENDOTHELIUM. Here, as in tlie surfaces covered by epithelium, a base- ment membrane was at one time supposed to intervene between the cells and the connective tissue ; but it is now believed that the cells are in direct contact, by their deeper surface, with the connective tissue itself, which serves as the framework of support for the blood and lymph vessels and the nerves of the part. In the serous membranes and in the coats of the larger blood-vessels elastic fibres are present in considerable numbers in the sub-endothelial tissue. In the serous membranes the lymph- vessels are very abundant in the sub-epithelial tissue, where they form a layer parallel to the free surface of the mem- brane, from which short vessels pass vertically to open by minute orifices into the serous cavity. The serous mem- branes are attached by the sub-endothelial connective tissue to the organs which they invest. Each Serous Membrane consists of a portion which invests the viscus or organ, named the visceral layer, and a portion which lines the walls of the cavity in which the organ is situated, named the 'parietal layer. Between these two layers is the so-called serous cavity, the wall of which is formed by the smooth surfaces of both the parietal and the visceral layers. The serous membranes are as follows:—The two pleurae situated in the cavity of the chest, one invest- ing each lung, and lining the interior of that part of the thoracic cavity in which the lung is situated; the pericar- dium, which invests the heart, and lines the bag in which the heart is contained; the peritoneum, which invests the abdominal viscera, and lines the abdominal cavity; and the arachnoid membrane, which invests the brain and spinal cord, and is regarded by many as lining the dura mater, the140 ANATOMY. membrane which encloses these important organs. The smooth free surfaces of the serous membranes are moistened by a limpid fluid, or serum, which facilitates their move- ment on each other, just as the free smooth surfaces of the synovial membranes are lubricated by the viscid synovia which they secrete. The endothelium of the Serous Membranes consists of a layer of irregular squamous cells, the edges of which may be smooth or slightly serrated. The cells are closely adapted to each other by their edges, so as to form a continuous smooth layer, which forms the free surface of the serous membrane. Scattered irre- gularly over this surface are the minute orifices, or stomata, which open into lymphatic vessels. The cells which sur.

The light band ,, marks the position of a vertical lym- tne ordinary endothehum ; phatic vessel. (After Klein.) .. . they are smaller, and are polyhedral, their contents are granular, and the nucleus is more distinct. The endothelium lining the Lymphatic Vessels consists of a layer of flattened cells, which, instead of having an irregular shape, are elongated and slightly sinuous in out- line. The endothelium of the lymphatics is continuous with that of the serous membranes through the stomata, so that the cavities of the serous membranes are now re- garded as great lymph-sacs. The endothelial lining of the Blood-Vessels corresponds141 ENDOTHELIUM. in general characters with that of the lymphatics. In the small bloocl capillaries the cells are fusiform • in those of larger size, more irregular : in the veins they are broader, more irregular, and less distinctly fusiform than in the arteries. The endothelial covering of the endocardial lining of the heart consists of a layer of flattened cells with irregular outlines. The endothelial lining of the blood-vascular system is continuous with that of the lymph-vascular system, where the thoracic duct and other large lymph-vessels open into the great veins, and thus a continuity of surface is established between the serous membranes and the lining membrane of the blood-vascular system through the lymphatics. The endothelium of the Synovial Membranes forms a layer of polygonal, tessellated cells, on the inner surface of the vascular connective tissue of the synovial capsules. The existence of a continuous layer of such cells, though denied by Hiiter and Reyher, has been established by Till- manns. Villous processes of the sub-endothelial vascular connective tissue called synovial fringes, covered by endo- thelium, project into the cavities of joints and synovial bursas, and contribute to the formation of the synovia which lubricates the surfaces of a synovial membrane. Endothelium is developed exclusively from the cells of the mesoblast, from which cells also, by histological dif- ferentiation, are formed the organs to which the endothelium serves as a lining. Between the endothelium and the con- nective tissue a close genetic co-relationship obviously exists, and the flattened endothelial cells are apparently specially differentiated on the surface of the bundles of connective tissue.142 ANATOMY. THIRD GROUP. Cells imbedded in Solid Tissues. The cells which are imbedded in the solid tissues are either grouped together in considerable masses, or, as not unfrequently happens, are more or less separated by an intermediate matrix, or intercellular substance. The matrix substance varies in its character in different tissues, and sometimes is so abundant as to obscure the cells. The textures which are constructed on this plan are of great importance, and constitute by far the larger propor- tion of the tissues not only of the human body, but of the bodies of animals generally. Sometimes these tissues are elongated into delicate threads or fibres, at other times they are expanded into thin membranes, at others they form solid masses of considerable thickness. Connective Tissue. By the term Connective Tissue is meant a group of tissues which, though the members of the group differ in various respects from each other, both in naked eye and microscopic characters, yet agree in the property of bind- ing or connecting together other tissues or parts of the body, and in serving as a supporting framework for more delicate tissues. This group of tissues is the most exten- sively diffused of all the textures, for there is no organ in the body which does not contain one or other of its forms. The following varieties, based on modifications in their appearance and structure, may be recognised.CONNECTIVE TISSUE. 143 a. Neuroglia. This name, which means nerve glue, has been applied by Virchow to the delicate tissue in the cen- tral organs of the nervous system, and of the retina, which supports the nerve cells, nerve fibres, and blood-vessels of those parts.

A form of tumour, named Glioma, is some- times produced by the excessive growth in the brain or retina of this variety of connective tissue. b. Retiform connective tissue constitutes the stroma or supporting framework of the lym- phatic and other glands which possess the adenoid type of tissue. It consists of stellate branching cells, the branches of which blend with each other, Fig. 36,_Retiforn/ and form a delicate anastomosing tl3Sue fTOm a lymphatic slan'ti. network or reticulum. In the lymph glands, the colour- less lymph corpuscles are set in the meshes of this network. In the solitary and Peyer’s glands of the alimentary canal, in the tonsils, at the back of the tongue, in the posterior wall of the nasal part of the pharynx, the palpebral conjunctiva, the thymus gland, the pulp and Malpighian bodies of the spleen, colourless lymph-like connective144 ANATOMY. corpuscles are also included in the meshes of a reticulum. The name adenoid or lymph- oid tissue is sometimes em- ployed in describing this type of structure, and in some forms of disease the tissue increases in certain localities so largely in quan- tity as to form well-defined lymphoid tumours. c.

Under some pathological conditions, this form of tissue increases largely in quantity in some parts of the body, and forms a kind of tumour named Myxoma. d. Fibrous connective tissue presents four modifications in appearance. It may be soft and delicate, with the fibres short and but faintly marked, as in the sub-epithelial tissue of the sldn and mucous membranes. It may be loose, flocculent, and filamentous, and may contain small spaces or areolae (when it is called areolar tissue), as is well seen in the subcutaneous tissue of the adult, and in the omenta. It may be expanded in the form of a fibrous membrane, as in the fasciae or aponeuroses, and the threads or fibres, strong and well marked, sometimes run parallel, sometimes cross each other at various angles. It may be collected into rounded or flattened bands, as in tendons and ligaments, where it forms the tendinous and ligamentous tissues. Here also the threads or fibres may be distinctly recognised and seen to run in parallel bundles, so as to connect together the two structures between which the tendon or ligament passes. In the fibrous form of connective tissue, both cells and intercellular substance, the latter of which is differentiated into fibres, may be recognised. The cells are, as a rule, either elongated, or fusiform, or caudate, or stellate branched cells, and are familiarly known as the connective tissue corpuscles. In these cells the nucleus is round or oval, and usually well marked. It is surrounded by granular proto- plasm, but it is very doubtful if the protoplasm is invested by a cell wall. 1STot unfrequently, more especially where the cells are stellate, the delicate branched protoplasm processes of adjacent cells appear to blend at their extremities with K146 ANATOMY. each other, and form an anastomosing network. The structure of tendons has been recently examined with great care by Ranvier, Spina, and Thin with reference to the arrangement of their cellular constituents, and in addi- tion to the fusiform and stellate branched cells, which had long been recognised, rows of cells situ- ated between and parallel to the fibrous bundles have been described. In young tendons these cells are polygonal, but in adult tendons they are more flattened. Thin states that they form a continuous Fig. 39.—Flat cells on surface of tendo Achillis of layer of flat cells in a frog. (From Thin.) vesting not only the individual bundles of which a tendon is composed, but the surface of the tendon itself. Fio 40.—Cells investing the primary bundles of tendo Achillis of a sheep. (From Thin.) Key and Retzius have recently described the bundles of sub arachnoid connective tissue as surrounded by a layer of flattened cells, and a similar arrangement has been recorded by Mihalkovics around the bundles of the connective tissue stroma of the testicle. These flat endo-147 CONNECTIVE TISSUE. thelial-like cells are obviously a special differentiation of the formative cells of tlie connective tissue at the surface of the bundles. The wide diffusion of the connective tissue throughout the body, and the great importance of its cellular elements, have been especially dwelt on by Virchow as sources of origin of the new cell forms which arise in various patho- logical processes. The intercellular substance or matrix consists of fibres, which are not uniform in shape, and are divided into the two groups of white and yellow fibres. The white fibres of connective tissue constitute the most common form, and make up the great bulk of most ligaments, tendons, and fibrous membranes. They consist of excessively delicate filaments, varying from ^^th to ^ooth inch in thickness, which are united together in bundles or fasciculi of variable size. The bundles, as well as the filaments of which they are composed, have a wavy course, and the filaments in each bundle he almost parallel to each other. The bundles also in some cases are parallel, though in others they cross at various angles. Not only the FVwMte“'fibres filaments in each bundle, but the bundles tLue?0Dnectlve themselves, are cemented together; the firmness of the adhesion varies in the different modifications of the fibrous connective tissue, being much more decided in the tendons, ligaments, and fasciae, than in the lax areolar tissue. ., The yellow fibres of connective tissue, named elastic148 ANATOMY. tissue, from its elasticity, make up the mass of the liga- menturn nuchse, the ligamenta sub-Hava, and the yellow elastic coat of the arteries. They are also found mingled with the white fibres, in the fibrous membranes, the skin, the mucous and serous membranes, the areolar tissue, in ten- dons, and some ligaments. In the liga- menta sub-flava and nuchas the yellow fibres are arranged in bundles, the in- dividual fibres of which are comparatively broad, with a distinct dark outline. They branch, and their branches readily break across, and the broken end then curls upon itself. Their diameter is about __u_th inch. In the coats of the arteries Fig. 42.—Fasciculus the elastic fibres form an anastomosing elasticCtissue^'frorri network. When mingled with the white ligamentum nuchse. , ,. fibres they are much finer, and sometimes do not exceed 5T|T7th inch in diameter. They possess, however, a distinct and definite outline; they branch and occasionally anastomose; and the individual fibres, possess- ing a ring-like, spiral, or twisted course, are wound around the bundles of the white fibres. The white fibres yield gelatine on boiling, but the elastic fibres do not. The white fibres swell up and become so transparent under the action of acetic acid as to be no longer recognisable. The yellow fibres, again, are not affected by that reagent. Quekett pointed out that the elastic fibres of the liga- mentum nuchce of the giraffe were marked by transverse strice, and M. Watson has seen a similar appearance in the elastic pericardiac ligament of the elephant. These transverse stria: are apparently cracks in the fibre; and, asCONNECTIVE TISSUE. 149 Beale has shown, are not unfrequently seen in the elastic fibres in beef and mutton which have passed through the alimentary canal. Bearing on the mode of nutrition of the tendons, and other fibrous forms of connective tissues, minute plasma or juice spaces and canals have been described, along which, not blood, but the liquor sanguinis is supposed to flow. Virchow conceived that the connective tissue cor- puscles formed an anastomosing network for this purpose. Briicke believed that delicate channels or lacunas existed between the bundles of connective tissue, whilst Reckling- hausen maintained that the canaliculi were situated in the homogeneous substance which connects the fibrous fasciculi and lamellae of the connective tissue with each other. These lacunae or canaliculi are, in all probability, the root- lets of origin of the lymphatic system of vessels, and Mihalkovics and Thin maintain that their walls are formed by the flat endothelial-like cells which invest the bundles of connective tissue. Ranvier even suggests that the spaces between the connective tissue bundles, walled in by these cells, form a close system analogous to the serous cavities. There can indeed be no doubt, as the recent injections of Ludwig and Schweigger-Seidel have shown, that tendons and fasciae are well provided with lymph vessels, for they have injected in them a minute network, consisting in part of polygonal meshes, and in part of vessels running longi- tudinally and parallel to the connective tissue bundles, and the walls of these vessels were formed of endothelial cells. Recklinghausen and others have recently described cor- puscles in the connective tissue which resemble in size and appearance the white corpuscles of the blood and lymph.ANATOMY. 150 These corpuscles are believed to move about in the juice canals already referred to, and it is possible that they may have migrated into the tissue through the walls of its nutrient blood-vessels. The vascularity of the connective tissue varies in differ- ent localities. The perios- teum and perichondrium are very vascular; but their nume- rous vessels are concerned in the nutrition not merely of these fibrous membranes, but of the bone and cartilage Fig. 43. — Connective tissue of the which they invest. The sheath omentum of the foetus, showing the . . .... characteristic fusiform corpuscles, of connective tlSSUe WfllCJl 1H- A capillary hlood-vessel crosses the figure, and outside it are several vests a tendon IS more Vas- blood corpuscles which have pro- bahly migrated from the vessel. cillar than the substance ot the tendon itself. As a rule, it may be stated that the fibrous connective tissues are not highly vascular, and that the nutritive changes which take place in them after their growth is completed are not very active. Connective tissue is sparingly supplied with nerves, and their mode of ter- mination in it has not been ascertained. The mode of development of the connective tissue has been much discussed by anatomists, and various views have been advanced as to the changes which lead to its pro- duction. It is now, however, generally admitted that, except perhaps the neuroglia, it arises from the cells of the mesoblast layer of the embryo, by a special morphological and chemical differentiation of their protoplasm, but the degree to which this differentiation may proceed varies with the particular form of tho texture. The neuroglia apparently151 CONNECTIVE TISSUE. arises along with, the central nervous axis from the cells of the epiblast; and its tissue remains mostly as a granular nucleated protoplasm, though a delicate fibrillation may sometimes be seen in it. In the' retiform connective tissue the cells have assumed a stellate shape, and their branches anastomose. In the gelatinous and fibrous form an intercellular matrix is extensively produced, and exhi- bits a differentiation into fibres. In these last-named forms, which are the most characteristic varieties of the tissue, the cells of the mesoblast change their form, and assume a fusiform, caudate, or stellate shape; and, sub- sequently a delicate fibrillated structure appears between them, which assumes the characters of the bundles of white fibrous tissue, and by separating the cells from each other forms the fibrous intercellular matrix. It has been much disputed whether these white fibres take their rise immediately from the peripheral portion of the cells by a direct differentiation of their protoplasm, or whether this protoplasm is not in the first instance converted into a homogeneous matrix in which the fibrous differentiation then occurs. There can be no doubt that the fibres are • formed by a metamorphosis of the protoplasm of the cells; whether the metamorphosis takes place directly, or through the intermediate stage of a homogeneous matrix, is a secondary question, and in all probability both modes of conversion take place at different times and in different localities. As the differentiation into fibres progresses, the tissue becomes firmer and tougher, and the propor- tion of the cellular to the fibrous element diminishes. Hence, say in a young tendon, the rows of connective tissue cells are not only closer together, but are muchANATOMY. 152 more readily seen than in an adult tendon, in which the increased production of fibres obscures the cellular element. The mode of origin of the yellow elastic fibres has also been much discussed. At one time it was believed that they were derived from nuclei, and on this supposition they were named nuclear fibres. But from more recent observa- tions there is reason to believe that they are produced, like the white fibres, by a special differentiation of the proto- plasm of the embryonic cells, or of a homogeneous matrix derived from that protoplasm. In such localities as the ligamentum nuchse, where the fibres are both large and numerous, the whole of the cell protoplasm appears to become converted into elastic tissue. In tendons, and those parts where these fibres are slender and scanty, and coil round the bundles of white fibrous tissue, they apparently arise from a differentiation of the protoplasm on the sur- face only of the formative embryonic cells. Adipose Tissue. The Adipose or Fatty tissue varies in its amount in different individuals. It is especially found in the mar- row of the bones; as a layer beneath the skin, differing in thickness in different individuals; and collected in the cavity of the abdomen in the folds of peritoneum, known as the mesentery and omenta, in which, and indeed in the other localities where it occurs, it is intimately asso- dated with the connective tissue. It consists of cells, which vary in size from ^oth to ^"ovrth inch, usually ovoid or spherical in form, though when collected into153 ADIPOSE TISSUE. masses they may be laterally compressed. These cells are sometimes isolated, though most usually arranged in rows or clusters to form lobules of fat. The number of cells in a given lobule varies with the size of the lobule. The distinctive contents of these cells is a minute drop of oil, which, when examined by transmitted light, presents a bright appearance; but when seen by reflected light, looks, as Monro primus described it long ago, like a cluster of pearls. Each fat cell possesses a distinct fig. 44.—Fat ceils and wall, as can be readily demonstrated by aieoLu tiss,uc- digesting these cells in ether, when the oil is dissolved out and the membranous wall remains. The nucleus of the fat cell is more difficult to demonstrate, and when seen is found attached to the inner surface of the cell wall In the fat of old persons, and in specimens of this tissue which have been removed from the body for a length of time, a stellate group of acicular crystals is not unfrequently to be seen in the interior of the cell, which consist either of margarin or margaric acid, one of the constituents of human fat. The lobules of fat cells are included between bundles of the areolar variety of connective tissue, which form their supporting framework. But in addition, they are more or less per- fectly surrounded by a network of capillary vessels, which not only serves to convey to them blood for their nutrition, but aids in retaining them in position. The close anatomical relation between the adipose and the connective tissue points to a genetic relationship between154 ANATOMY. them. It has now been ascertained that the first stage in the formation of a fat cell consists in the appearance of extremely minute drops of oil in the protoplasm of the con- nective tissue corpuscles of the part; as these run together larger drops are produced, a cell wall at the same time differentiates from the peripheral part of the protoplasm, and as the cell becomes distended with oil, by the conver- sion into fat of its substance, it swells out into a spherical or ovoid cell. Klein has recently shown that the fatty tissue of the omentum and mesentery is formed by the production of oil drops within the branched cells, which form the reticular tissue that supports the lymphoid cells found so abundantly between these folds of peritoneum. In a lymphoid tumour of the mesentery, which I recently examined, where fatty degeneration had made considerable progress, I found that not only the branched cells) but the lymphoid cells also, had undergone the fatty change. Pigmentary Tissue. In some parts of the body a yellow, brown, or black pigment is found in the interior of cells, which gives to the tissue and organ a characteristic colour. In the coloured races of mankind, and in certain parts of the body of the white races, pigment is pro- ... , duced in the cells of the cuticle Fig. 46.—Group of 6-sided chor- oidai pigment cells. or epidennis, more especially m the cells of the deeper strata or rete Malpighi. In the connective tissue corpuscles, also, more especially in the dermis of fish, amphibia, and reptiles, pigment is found mCARTILAGINOUS TISSUE. 155 considerable abundance. The choroid coat of the eyeball owes its dark brown or black colour to the presence of pigment in the interior of the cells. The pigment cells of the choroid are usually polyhedrons, 5 or 6-sided, and are arranged to form a mosaic pattern. In the centre is a nucleus, and the cell substance is occupied by numbers of minute brown granules. In the connective tissue on the outer surface of the choroid, the pig- ment is contained in stellate cells. In fig. 46.—.stellate pig- ment cells from the the skin of fishes and amphibia, the skin of a codfish, stellate pigment cells branch and subdivide so as to form highly complex patterns, and the cells are crowded with brown or yellow granules. The production of pigment, either in the interior of epidermal cells, in the poly- hedral cells of the choroid, or in the stellate connective tissue corpuscles, is owing to a special metamorphosis or differentiation of the protoplasm substance of these cells. Cartilaginous Tissue. By the term Cartilage, or cartilaginous tissue, is meant a group of tissues which, though usually found in the form of plates or bars, yet differ in various respects from each other, both in naked eye and microscopic characters. They agree, however, in forming solid textures, opaque when seen in mass, but translucent, pearly, or bluish white, in thin slices, firm in consistence, but easily cut with a knife, endowed with considerable elasticity, and yielding chondrine on boil- ing. Cartilage is of greater importance in the foetus, and in156 ANATOMY. the immature condition of the body than in the adult, for in early life the skeleton is in a great measure formed of it. As development and growth proceed, a considerable pro- portion of the cartilage becomes converted into bone, and is called, therefore, temporary cartilage, whilst the remain- ing portion continues as cartilage throughout life, and is termed permanent. The following varieties of cartilage, based on modifications in structure and appearance, may be recognised:— Cellular cartilage. Cells with matrix substance. ( * \ Matrix homogeneous. Matrix fibrous. (Hyaline cartilage.) (Fibro-cartilage.) / ' White fibro-cartilage. Yellow fibro-cartilage. The Cellular or Parenchymatous Cartilage does not exist in the adult human body. It occurs, however, in the sabs of the lamprey. appears as development advances, but in the lower vertebrates it persists throughout life as a more or less perfect structure. In the lamprey and myxine it forms a continuous rod in the vertebral region. In fish generally, but more especially in the cartilaginous group, it forms a jelly-like mass, occupying the concavities between the bodies of the vertebrae. The cells lie in con- tact with each other. They are comparatively large in Fig. 47.—Cells of the chorda dor- human embryo, in the embryos of all the vertebrata, and in the larval stage of development of the tunicata, as the slender rod named chorda dorsalis or noto- chord. In all the higher verte- brata the chorda dorsalis dis-CARTILAGINOUS TISSUE. 157 size, are sometimes rounded, but more usually compressed laterally. Tile nucleus is often very distinct, though, at other times more difficult to detect, and the cell wall is well marked. Sometimes a little intercellular substance is found. By some anatomists the chorda dorsalis is regarded as a variety of connective tissue, and not of cartilage. The cartilaginous framework of the ear of some small mammals—as the mouse, the bat, and the rat—is formed of cellular cartilage, the cells of which are smaller in size than those of the chorda dorsalis, irregularly poly- gonal, and closely packed together so as to form a solid tissue. The Hyaline Cartilage consists of cells imbedded in a pellucid or Fig. 48.—Ceils of the cartilagi- nous framework of the ear hyaline matrix, which, under some of thc mouse, conditions, however, may assume a dimly granulated ap- pearance. The xiphoid and costal cartilages, the encrusting cartilages at the articular ends of the bones, the car- tilages of . the nose, those of the windpipe, except the epiglottis and cornicula la- ryngis, belong to this variety, as also the temporary car- tilages. In hyaline cartilage Fig. 49.- mI -Hyaline costal cartilage. the cells are ovoid or polygonal, or even fusiform, and sometimes flattened, the flattened form of cell being found next the surface of the cartilage. They lie singly, or in groups of two, or three, or four; sometimes they are arranged in linear series, at other times they are158 ANATOMY. irregularly grouped together. The cell contents are dimly granular, with a well-defined nucleus containing a nucleo- lus. Not unfrequently two or more nuclei are present in a cell; and in old cartilage the contents are often coarsely granular, or even infiltrated with drops of oil. Heidenhain has shown that powerful induction shocks cause contraction of the protoplasm of the cells towards the central nucleus. The cells lie in cavities in the matrix substance, and the part of the matrix which forms the immediate wall of the hollow is named the capsule of the cell. Two or more cells may sometimes lie in the same hollow. The matrix of hyaline cartilage is usually homogeneous. In some animals the matrix appears to have a concentric arrangement around the cells; and Rollett has stated that by the use of dilute sulphuric acid or chromic acid the matrix may be made to split up into concentric layers. Sometimes the matrix appears granulated, a change which is very apt to occur in sections of cartilage which ha\e been removed for some tune from the body. In the costal cartilages of old persons the matrix becomes fibrous; and it is by no means uncommon to find in advanced age these bars of cartilage converted into bone. In the articular or encrustiug cartilages the arrangement of the cells is quite distinctive. If a vertical section be made through a plate of this cartilage, the cells next the bone are seen to be arranged in parallel rows perpendicular to the surface of the bone on which the cartilage rests; the cells are smaller than those of the costal caitilage, oblong in form, and the adjacent rows are separated by intermediate hyaline matrix. Near the free surface of159 CARTILAGINOUS TISSUE. Fig. 50.—Vertical sectio through an encmstin cartilage. B, the bon on which the cartilag rests. the cartilage the cells are flattened, placed parallel to the plane of the surface, and so closely packed together that the proportion of matrix is much reduced. In the intermediate parts of the cartilage the cells he irregu- larly in the matrix, and are rounded in form. It was from the study of the changes which take place in articular cartilage in disease that Goodsir was enabled to establish the production of new cells by the multiplication of the normal pre- existing cells of the cartilage,—an observation which formed the start- ing-point of the modern doctrine of cellular pathology. Fibro-cartilages are divided into white and yellow. White fibro-cartilage may form the connecting medium between the articular surfaces of an amphiarthrodial joint, as in the inter- vertebral discs; or it may form plates in the interior of joints, as in the semi-lunar cartilages of the knee and the menisci in other diarthrodial joints; or it may extend around the margin of the socket of a joint, as in the cotyloid ligament of the hip; or it may. invest the surfaces of bones over which tendons have to play, as where the tendons of the peronei muscles play in the groove on the back of the external malleolus. In the intervertebral discs, which give the best illustrations of the structure of white fibro-cartilage, the cells are ovoid Fig. 51. — White fibro - cartilage of an intervertebral disc.ANATOMY. 160 in form and distinctly nucleated. Sometimes two or three are grouped together, but not unfrecjuently they occur singly. They are separated from each other by short fibres like those of connective tissue. In these discs the fibrous matrix is always stronger and more distinct in the peripheral than in the central part. White fibro-cartilage is transitional between true hyaline cartilage and connec- tive tissue, i.e., the cells possess the characters of cartilage cells, whilst the matrix, instead of being hyaline, is fibrous, like the matrix of the connective tissue. The yellow elastic fibro-cartilages are the epiglottis, the cornicula laryngis, the cartilaginous framework of the auricle of the human ear, and the ears of mammalia generally, and the petrous end of the cartilaginous wall of the Eustachian tube. The cells are rounded or ovoid, distinctly nucleated, and usually arranged singly or in pairs. The matrix is dis- tinctly fibrous; the fibres, which form a close intersecting network, branch and sometimes anastomose. They resist the action of acetic acid like the yellow fibres of connective tissue; and Donders has described a continuity between them and the elastic fibres of the connective tissue, which forms the investing perichondrium of this form of cartilage. The yellow fibro-cartilage has no tendency to ossify. The bars and plates of cartilage—except the encrusting hyaline cartilages, and the interarticular, marginal, and in- vesting white fibro-cartilages—are surrounded by a fibrous membrane or perichondrium. In the achdt human body cartilage is not penetrated by blood-vessels, but is nourished by the vessels which ramify in its investing perichondrium. In the foetus, however, and in the large masses of cartilage which are found in the skeletons of the cetacea and of theCARTILAGINOUS TISSUE. 161 cartilaginous fishes, the cartilage is permeated by canals in which blood-vessels ramify. The encrusting cartilages are nourished by the blood-vessels of the synovial membrane of the joint, which form a vascular ring around the margin of the cartilage; and, both in them and in the forms of white fibro-cartilage that do not possess a perichondrium, the vessels of the bone, to which these cartilages are as a rule attached assist in conveying nourishment to the attached surface of the cartilage. In the movable joints, after the child has begun to use its limbs, the synovial membrane is not continued over the free surface of the articular cartilage, but stops at its margin along the line of the vascular ring. In the foetus, however, it has been stated that both blood-vessels and synovial membrane are prolonged over the free surface of the articular cartilage. The termination of nerves in cartilage has not been ascer- tained. In the development of hyaline cartilage the contents of the embryonic mesoblast cells where the cartilage is to be produced, become clear, and a cell wall differentiates around the exterior of the cell. The nuclei in the cells divide and subdivide, so that a multiplication of the cells by endo- genous reproduction takes place. Hyaline matrix sub- stance then appears between the cells, and is concentrically arranged around them; it is believed to be formed by a special conversion of successive layers of the cell proto- plasm into a substance which yields chondrine on boiling. The fibro-cartilages, both white and yellow, but especially the latter, yield but little chondrine on boiling, for the fibrous matrix of the white fibro-cartilage is a gelatine yielding substance, like the white fibres of connectiveANATOMY. 162 tissue, whilst the fibres of the yellow fibro-cartilage partake of the nature of elastic tissue. The fibro-cartilages, there- fore, form a group which links together the connective and cartilaginous tissues. Osseous Tissue. The Osseous Tissue, or Bone, is that which constitutes the hard framework of the skeleton. Each bone consists of a hard, more or less dense, tough, and but slightly elastic mate- rial. The elasticity of the bones is more marked in young than in adult and aged persons. From differences in their external configuration, bones are divided into long or cylin- drical, e.g., femur; short, e.g., carpal or tarsal bones; flat or plate-like, e.g., scapula; irregular bones, e.g., vertebrae. These variations in shape do not, however, involve differ- ences either in composition or minute structure. Bone con- sists chemically of an earthy and an animal substance inti- mately blended together. The earthy matter forms about two-thirds, and consists chiefly of phosphate of lime, which, from its abundance in bone, is frequently called “bone earth.” Carbonate of lime and a small proportion of soda and magnesia salts are also present. The hardness of bone is due to the presence of the earthy matter. The animal matter forms the remaining third, and yields gelatine on boiling; it imparts elasticity and toughness to the bone, and binds together the particles of earthy matter. Bone presents two different structural characters to the naked eye. The outer part of a bone is its hardest part, and forms a dense external shell, technically called the.163 OSSEOUS TISSUE. compact tissue. The interior of a bone is much less firm, and is made up of thin delicate plates or bars, or trabecles, which intersect each other at various angles, and form a lattice-like arrangement, technically called the spongy or cancellated tissue. The plates and bars of the spongy tissue are continuous with the inner surface of the compact tissue. In the long bones the interior of the shaft is hol- lowed into a canal, named the medullary canal, the walls of which are formed by the compact tissue, and the can- cellated tissue is found only at the articular ends of these bones; the thickness of the compact tissue in a long bone is always greater at the centre of the shaft than at or near the articular ends. If the outer surface of the compact tissue of a long bone and the wall of the medullary canal be examined with a pocket lens, they will be seen to be riddled by multitudes of minute orifices, which are the mouths of minute tubular passages or canals that traverse the compact tissue. These passages are named Havej'sian canals, and their arrange- ment may be studied by making thin sections through the compact tissue, and submitting these to microscopic examination, when they will be seen to pass longitudinally or very obliquely through its substance, so as to terminate by rounded orifices either on its outer surface, or on the inner surface, which forms the wall of the medullary canal. These canals are connected together at intervals by short transverse or oblique canals. Owing to these communica- tions the dense osseous tissue is permeated by an anasto- mosing network of canals, which, as they contain blood- vessels, may be named vascular canals. These canals are cir- cular in transverse section, and vary in diameter from aboutANATOMY. 164 ^--jy-g-th to 1(310-otli inch. They not un frequently are dilated at the inner end, where they open into the spaces of the cancellated tissue. The compact tissue of all bones possesses a system of canals similar to those found in the long bones, but when bone occurs in the form of very thin plates the canals may be absent. In addition to the Haversian canals, irregular spaces, named Haversian spaces by Tomes and De Morgan, may also be seen in sections through the com- pact tissue. They are met with not only in young but in adult bones, and are regarded as produced by absorption of the bone in those particular localities. In thin sections through bone, more especially when the Haversian canals are transversely divided, the dense tissue or matrix of the bone which surrounds the canals is seen to be arranged in concentric rings, as if it were built up of a series of lamellce superimposed on each other. These lamellae do not at all times form complete circles, and the number which sur- round a canal may vary from two or three to half a dozen; they are sometimes called the Haversian lamellae. Other lamellae lie in relation to the periosteal surface of the bone, and are called peripheral lamellae ; whilst others again are, as it were, intercalated between adjacent Haversian systems of lamellae, and are named intermediate or interstitial. It has been pointed out by Sharpey that a bone lamella, alter the earthy matter has been dissolved out by the action of an acid, is made up of multitudes of fine trans- parent fibres, which intersect each other and form a net- work. But he has further shown that the lamellae are perforated by fibres, or bundles of fibres, which pass through them either perpendicularly or obliquely, so as to bolt adjacent lamellce together. With a little care, the per-OSSEOUS TISSUE. 165 Jorating -fibres of Sharpey may be drawn out of the holes or sockets in which they are lodged. When thin sections through a macerated and dried bone are examined under the higher powers of the microscope, the lamellated matrix is seen to exhibit a very peculiar appearance, which is characteristic of the osseous tissue. Between the surfaces of adjacent lamellae irregularly elongated spaces, called lacunae, are to be seen in con- siderable numbers; these lacunae, like the lamellae be- tween which they are situated, have a concentric arrange- ment around the Haversian canals. The lacunae, the lamellae, and the Haver- sian canal which they surround, are sometimes named a Haversian sys- tem. From the ends and sides of any one of these lacunae very minute „ „ _ . ,, , J Fig. 52.—Transverse section through the com- branching canals, termed Pact tlsauo of t}1® shaft of a long bone.

The lacunae average in length inch, and their transverse diameter is about inr o o o ^h suVo^1 inch ; the canaliculi vary from -^i^-th to inch in diameter. When examined in a dried bone by transmitted light, the lacunae look like solid, black bodies, and the canaliculi seem to be processes branching off from them, hence they were erroneously called by the earlier166 ANATOMY. observers bone-corpuscles. But if a little turpentine be added to the 'section, the fluid displaces the air which the lacunae and canaliculi contain in the dried bone, renders the part more transparent, and affords a satisfac- tory demonstration that they are, in a macerated and dry bone, not solid bodies, but a minute system of spaces and anastomosing little canals - and that all those which lie in the same Haversian system not only freely communicate with each other, but, either directly or indirectly, with the Haversian canal which they surround. But a macerated and dried bone, such as one sees in museums and in articulated skeletons, and the structure of which has just been described, is a bone which has been deprived of several soft tissues by the pro- cess of putrefaction, which tis- sues are of the utmost importance h in the economy of the bone in the Fig. 53. — Longitudinal section liyinS animal- A Hvillg bone is ^rbon^toTow4 thf passage a complex organ, andamacerated of blood-vessels from the peri- 1 • _ i xi i , , n ostenm P, into the Haversian bone is Only the skeleton of a canals H H. .... T. . ... living bone, it is essential, therefore, in studying the structure of bone, that the attention should not be limited to the appearances pre- sented by the macerated bone, but that the arrangement and structure of its soft tissues should be considered. The soft tissues of a bone are the periosteum and its prolonga- tions, the marrow, the minute masses of nucleated pro- toplasm which occupy the lacunae of the bone, the blood and lymph vessels, and the nerves. The Periosteum is a strong fibrous membrane whichOSSEOUS TISSUE. 167 invests all the exterior of a bone, except where the encrust- ing cartilage is continuous with its articular end. It is subdivided into two layers: a firm external fibrous layer (Fig. 54, S P), consisting of bundles of connective tissue, which decussate with each other in various directions, and amidst which a network of small blood-vessels is freely distributed prior to their pas- sage into the Haversian canals; a softer internal layer (DP), which is especially well marked Fig. 54._Section through thc peri. in von Tiff ffrowinff bnnpq This! osteum and compact tissue of a in young growing uones. mis y0Ung bone.

Processes of the soft inner layer are prolonged into the Haversian canals, in which, as Goodsir pointed out, a layer of cellular sub- stance lies between the wall of the canal and its contained blood-vessel, so that these canals are not, as in macerated bones, empty passages, but are filled up by the blood- vessels and the cellular layer. the -wide Haversian canals; V, a vessel of the periosteum entering a canaL The Marrow occupies the medullary canal of a long bone and the spaces in the cancellated tissue of bones generally. It occurs in two forms, red and yellow marrow. Red marrow is found in the bones of the foetus generally, and in the cancelli of the plate-like, short, and irregular bones at a more advanced period. It consistsANATOMY. 168 principally of colossal many-nucleated cells, the myeloid cells (myeloplaxes) of Robin, lying in a very delicate areo- lar tissue, and supplied by a network of capillary blood- vessels. It contains little or no fat. Yellow marrow, again, is composed of fat cells lying in a delicate areolar tissue -with accompanying blood-vessels. The areolar tissue, which supports the marrow cells, lines the medullary canal and cancelli, and is named the medullary membrane, or the endosteum. In the fresh bone the lacunae are not empty spaces as in the macerated bone. They are filled up by nucleated clumps of protoplasm, and are therefore, as Goodsir was the first to show, the seats of little masses of nucleated cells, which cells are the true bone-corpuscles. The protoplasm of these cells is apparently prolonged into the cana- liculi. Hence the hard part of the osseous texture has within it a system of nucleated cells, some of which occupy the lacunas and canaliculi, while others form a lining to the Haversian canals. The blood-vessels of a bone are abund- ant. It receives its arteries partly from the small arteries which ramify in the Fig. 55.— Nucleated branched cells oc- periosteum, the fine branches of which cupying the lacunie and canaliculi ot a enter the Haversian canals, and form bone. ■within them an anastomosing network of capillaries; partly through a special artery which enters the nutrient canal in the bone, to be distributed chiefly to the marrow; partly through small arteries which enter openings in the compact tissue near the articular extre- mities. The veins of bones are also abundant. In theOSSEOUS TISSUE. 169 cancellated tissue they are large, and leave the interior of the bone partly through foramina situated near the articular ends, and partly by a vein which accompanies the artery that traverses the nutrient canal. In the plate-like bones of the skull the veins lie in distinct channels in the diploe, and in the bodies of the vertebrae the veins pass out through large holes in the posterior surface. Bones possess lymph- vessels, but their exact mode of arrangement has not yet been ascertained. Fine nerves accompanying the arteries which enter the nutrient and Haversian canals have been traced into bones, and nerves end also in the periosteum. It is clear, therefore, that a bone, hard and dense though its texture seems to be, is yet hollowed out by spaces, passages, and canals which, under the several names of medullary canal, cancellated spaces, nutrient canal, Haversian canals, Haversian spaces, lacunse, and canaliculi, are occupied by blood-vessels or other soft tis- sues. By the penetration of blood-vessels into the bone, blood is conveyed not only to the medulla, but into the very substance even of the compact tissue; and there cab be no doubt that the nucleated masses of protoplasm which occupy the lacunae and canaliculi, and line the Haversian canals, are, as Goodsir long ago pointed out, centres con- cerned in the nutrition of the matrix substance of the bone in their immediate neighbourhood. These cells, together with the periosteum, the medulla, and their blood- vessels, are active agents in the development, growth, and nutrition of the osseous tissue. In the description of the development of the skeleton, it is stated that the bones are formed by ossification in cartilage and fibrous membrane, so that bones are pro-ANATOMY. 170 ducecl by secondary changes in a pre-existing material. The mode of production of the osseous tissue in the car- tilaginous and fibrous tissues will now be considered, and it should be clearly understood at the outset that, in normal ossification, bone is not formed by a mere calcification of the matrix of the pre-existing tissue, and a direct conver- sion of the cartilage or connective tissue corpuscles into bone corpuscles; but, as the researches of Sharpey, Bruch, H. Muller, Loven, and Gegenbaur have made known, is due to a development of new corpuscles, which Gegenbaur has named osteo-blcists, accompanied by an abundant forma- tion of blood-vessels. When the process of ossification in temporary cartilage begins, a change takes place in the arrangement of its cells at the centre, or point, or nucleus of ossification. The cells, instead of preserving their irregularly scattered arrange- ment in the matrix, are now collected into longitudinal parallel rows, not unlike what was described in a previous section, in the deeper cells of encrusting cartilage. In each i’ow the cells lie with their long axes transverse, and apparently multiply by a process of fission. The cells at the end of the rows which lie nearest the centre of ossific change swell out and become more rounded. Calcification of the matrix substance, which separates not only the parallel rows of cells, but also the cells in the same row, from each other, then takes place, which calcification in- cludes also the capsules of the cartilage cells. A general opacity of the cartilage is the result of this calcification, and the further progress of ossification is rendered obscure. It is necessary, therefore, to dissolve out by an acid the calcareous matter, in order to follow the steps of the process.171 OSSEOUS TISSUE. Spaces or canals now form in the ossifying cartilage, into which blood-vessels, continuous with the vessels of the perichondrium, are prolonged. These spaces are lined by concentric layers of small rounded cells, not unlike lym- phoid cells in size and appearance, and form the medullary spaces of foetal cartilage, whilst the cells and blood-vessels form the medulla. Respecting the source of origin of the cells of this medulla, there have been difficulties in arriving at a correct conclusion. Some have believed them to be descended from the cartilage cells, though no demonstration of their derivation from this source has ever been obtained. Henke conceived that they might be blood corpuscles migrated from the blood-vessels within the spaces. But the recent observations of Stieda seem satisfactorily to show that the layers of medulla cells are continuous with similar layers beneath the perichondrium, which layers are prolonged along with the blood-vessels into the medullary spaces as they form in the ossifying cartil- age. But, whatever be their derivation, there can be no doubt that these cells undergo certain modifications which are of the utmost importance in the further stages of the ossific process. A few become elongated into fusiform or stellate corpuscles, like those of connective tissue; others have oil drops forming in their interior, and become the cells of yellow marrow; others become the many-nucleated cells of red marrow ; others, again, which form the osteo- blasts properly so-called, are the direct agents in the pro- duction of the osseous tissue itself. The formation of the medullary spaces in cartilage is owing to an absorption of the calcified cartilaginous tissue. Ivolliker points out that the absorption is effected through172 ANATOMY. Fig. 56—Colossal many- the agency of colossal, many-nucleated cells (myeloplaxes), which he named osteo-Jclasts, and believes to be derived from the osteo-blastic cells of the medulla already described, so that a destruction of the calcified cartilage precedes the for- mation of the proper osseous tissue. As the absorption of the cartilage goes on, an irregular series of medullary spaces communicating more or less freely with each other is produced. But along with the destructive changes in the cartilage the production of the new osseous tissue nucleated osteo-kiast, tapes piace. The osteo-blast cells of the occupying a cavity in i matrix? 5/ETj^ medulla are arranged in layers around llker) the walls of the medullary spaces, and undergo an important change both in composition and shape. They become granular, their protoplasm hardens from the periphery towards the nucleated centre of the cell, so as to give origin to the dense matrix substance of a bone lamella; but the nucleus, and the protoplasm immediately investing it, do not harden,—they form the soft contents of the lacunas and canaliculi. A second layer of osteo-blastic medulla cells then passes through a similar metamorphosis, and a second lamella is formed. By a repetition of this process around the walls of the several medullary spaces, the lamellae of the bone are produced. Hence it would appear that the dense solid matrix of the osseous tissue is produced by a special hardening of the protoplasm of the osteo-blastic cells in the medullary spaces, and as layer after layer of these cells is ossified successive lamellae are produced. The persistence, however, of the173 OSSEOUS TISSUE.' nucleus of each, osteo-blast, and of a small portion of its investing protoplasm, preserves within the hard matrix a certain amount of soft material, which being destroyed when a bone is macerated, leaves the lacunary and cana- licular system already described. The for- mation of successive lamellae, which takes place from the peri- phery towards the centre of the medul- lary spaces, necessarily diminishes the size of the spaces, which then form the Haversian canals. The vascular and cellular contents Fig. 57.—Section through a fcetal bone to illustrate its development.

So long as any cartilage remains in a foetal or young bone the process of replacement of the cartilaginous tissue by the proper osseous tissue goes on, until none of the cartilage is left, except the thin layer of encrusting cartil- age at each articular extremity. Bones grow in length by an ossification in cartilage ; and a provision for their longitudinal increase is furnished up to, and even beyond the age of puberty, by the plate of cartilage which separ-174 ANATOMY. ates tlie epiphysis from the shaft of a bone. The ossifica- tion of this plate of cartilage marks the period when growth ceases in the long axis of the bone. But bones also grow in thickness, and this addition to their girth takes place by an ossification of material situated at their circumference. It has already been pointed out that a bone is invested by a fibrous membrane, the periosteum, which fulfils for it the same purpose as does the peri- chondrium for the cartilage. On the deeper surface of the periosteum, i.e., next the bone itself, are osteo-blastic cells, similar to those which lie in the medullary spaces of the foetal cartilage. These cells pass through a similar series of changes, and produce successive layers of new bone at the periphery. The importance of the periosteum as a centre of origin of new bone has, indeed, long been recog- nised by both surgeons and pathologists. The parts of this membrane in which the special bone-producing power resides is the deep layer of ’osteo-blastic cells, whilst the blood-vessels furnish the pabulum for their nutrition. If strips of periosteum be removed, along with the cells of the deeper osteo-blastic layer, from a bone, and transplanted to other parts of the living body, bone will continue to be produced by their agency. The intra-membranous ossification of bone was first recognised by Nesbitt, and has been worked out in most of its details by Sharpey, Kolliker, and Gegeubaur. The tabular bones of the skull offer the best illustration of this mode of ossification. Sharpey has pointed out that a network of minute spicula of bone forms in the fibrous mem- brane, and extends in radiating lines from the centre of ossi- fication towards the circumference of the bone. The ossify-OSSEOUS TISSUE. 175 ing tissue consists of fibres, of multitudes of granular cor- puscles*or osteo-blasts, and of blood-vessels. The osteo-blasts invest tbe fibres, but as the investing osteo-blastic cells calcify, from the periphery towards the nucleus, they assume a stellate configuration, and pass through a series of changes similar to those described in the intra-cartilaginous mode of ossification. The fibres, which are in the first instance soft, also calcify and contribute to the formation of the bone. Here, however, as in the intra-cartilaginous ossifica- tion, the active agents in the ossific process are the osteo- blastic cells. The lamellated structure is due to ossifica- tion of successive layers of these cells, and the formation of the lacunae and canaliculi is owing to the persistence of their nuclei with a small proportion of unossified investing protoplasm. The increase in thickness of a membrane bone, like that of a cartilage bone, takes place through ossification in a deep periosteal layer of osteo-blasts. Hence it follows that, though the tissue which precedes the appear- ance of bone in the skeleton is not uniformly the same, in some cases being fibrous membrane, in others cartilage, there is an identity in the ossific process in the two forms of pre-existing tissue, in both of which the osteo-blast cells are the active agents in ossification. The chemical differentiation which takes place in the protoplasm of the osteo-blasts during bone-formation is not merely a calcifica- tion, but a coincident production of a gelatine-yielding substance, within which the minute calcareous particles are deposited. Stress has been laid by some anatomists, in discussing the homologies of the several bones of the skeleton, on the differences met with in the place of their formation. Thus,176 ANATOMY. I it has been supposed that a bone originally developed in car- tilage cannot be homologous with one originally developed in fibrous membrane, and that a fundamental morpho- logical distinction should be drawn between cartilage bones and membrane bones. But when it is considered that, though the place of formation may vary, the method of formation is the same in all localities, it does not appear that so much importance should be attached to the distinc- tion between cartilage and membrane bones as it has some- times received. Moreover, the differences between these two varieties of bones are, during the growth of the bone, still further diminished, for in both cases increase in thick- ness takes place in the same kind of pre-existing tissue, and in the same way, viz., by ossification of the deep periosteal layer of osteo-blasts. In the description of the development of bone in the foetus and young person, the formation of medullary spaces was referred to. But the production of spaces in bone is by no means limited to its early stages of growth. The medullary canal in a long bone can scarcely be said to exist in the bones of an infant’s limbs. The hollowing out of the shaft of a long bone into a large canal, and the enlargement of the spaces of the cancellated tissue, goes on not only up to the period of adult life, but even to ad- vanced years; so that in an old person the relative size of this canal is greater than in the prime of life. The Haver- sian spaces also, as Tomes and De Morgan pointed out, are produced by the absorption of the lamella of the osseous tissue surrounding the Haversian canals, and the production of these spaces is constantly going on during the life of the bone. The air-sinuses in the cranial bones177 MUSCULAR TISSUE. are also formed by the absorption of the diploe, and con- sequent separation of the two tables of the skull. Bones, therefore, are organs which are continually undergoing change. During growth additions are being made to their length and thickness, and additional lamellae are being formed in the walls of the Haversian canals. At the same time a hollowing out of spaces in their interior is going on, so that an increase in weight commensurate with their growth does not take place. The interstitial absorptive changes, whether occurring during growth or after growth is completed, are due, as Kolliker has shown, to the action of the many-nucleated colossal cells, or osteo-klasts, which line the walls of the spaces where absorption is going on. The development, modelling, and rdtimate configuration of a bone are, therefore, as has been well expressed by Kolliker, the product of the formation of osseous tissue by the agency of the osteo-blasts, and of its absorption or destruction by the action of the osteo-klasts. From the fact that osseous tissue may be produced either in the cartilaginous or in the fibrous tissues, and that all three contribute to the formation of the skeleton, it is evident that these tissues are closely allied. To express this alliance they have all been grouped together under the common term connective substances. Muscular Tissue. The Muscular Tissue is that which is actively concerned either in the movement of parts of the body on each other, or in the movement of the entire body from place to place; it is the active agent, therefore, both in motion and loco- MANATOMY. 178 motion. It forms a large proportion of the general mass of the body, is the essential constituent of the muscles or flesh, and enters into the formation of the walls of the hol- low viscera. It consists structurally of threads or fibres, some of which "are distinguished by being marked with transverse stripes or striae; others have no such markings. Hence it is customary to divide the fibres of the muscular tissue into transversely striped fibres and non-striped fibres. As a rule, the striped fibres are collected together to form those muscles which are under the influence of the will, so that both the muscles and the fibres of which they are composed are called voluntary. One important exception to this rule is, however, met with, for the muscular fibres of the heart, though transversely striped, are involuntary ; the will exercises no control over the action of the heart. The non-striped fibres, and the muscles into the construc- tion of which they enter, are in no instance, however, sub- ject to the influence of the will; so that, without exception, they may be named involuntary. The Non-striped or Involuntary fibre, sometimes called pale or smooth muscular fibre, enters into the forma- tion of the walls of the hollow viscera—e.g., stomach, intestines, bladder, uterus—of the walls of the air-tubes, gland-ducts, blood and lymph vessels, of the skin, and various mucous membranes. The fibres are usually col- lected into bundles or fasciculi, which are not aggregated together into such compact red masses as in the voluntary muscles, but are of a paler red colour, and are set farther apart, and often cross and interlace with each other in the walls of the tubes and hollow viscera, in which this form of muscle is found. The fasciculi are separated from each179 MUSCULAR TISSUE. other by a delicate, areolar connective tissue, or perimysium. The size of the fasciculi varies in different localities; in the hollow viscera they are so large that their arrangement can be observed with the naked eye; but in the skin, the walls of gland- ducts, &c., they can only be seen with the aid of the microscope. If a fasciculus be carefully torn up with needles it can be resolved into its constituent fibres, and the number of the fibres varies with the size of the fasciculus. The non-striped fibres are pale and almost colourless, with soft, ill-defined outlines, from g-gU^th to Woo111 inch in diameter; they are rounded Fl& 5g_A( afasci_ in form or laterally compressed, and are so musc^aTflbre-PBd easily flattened by artificial pressure, that far fibreceil more they have erroneously been regarded as flat hlghly maenifled- or ribbon-shaped fibres. When digested for a few hours in dilute nitric or hydrochloric acid, and sometimes even without any reagent, the fibres may be resolved into elon- gated fusiform cells—the contractile fibro-cells of Kolliker —which vary in length from ^th to ^tli inch, and which taper off usually into attenuated ends. In the middle of each cell is a characteristically elongated, rod- shaped nucleus, and sometimes the substance of the cell is finely granular, or even faintly longitudinally striped. No cell wall or sarcolemma can be distinguished. In some localities, as was pointed out by Lister in the minute arteries in the web of the frog’s foot, isolated contractile fibro-cells are wound spirally around the wall of the vessel. The cell substance refracts light doubly. i180 ANATOMY. The Transversely Striped fibre is the characteristic tissue of the voluntary muscular system, and is found wherever energetic movements are to be performed. In these muscles the fibres are collected together in fasciculi, which bundles usually lie parallel to each other, and extend from the tendon of origin to the tendon of insertion. Each muscle is invested by a membranous sheath formed of connective tissue, the perimysium externum, which sheath gives off processes that dip into the substance of the muscle, so as to form delicate partitions between the fasciculi, aud from these partitions still more slender prolongations of connec- tive tissue, named perimysium internum, pass between the fibres. The bundles of the perimysium are described by Thin as invested by a layer of flat cells. The number and size of the fasciculi vary with the size and texture of the muscle; in some, as the deltoid and gluteus maximus, the fasciculi are large and coarse ] whilst in others, as the gracilis and omo-hyoid, they are much finer. The number of fibres in a fasciculus varies with its length and thickness, and the fibres which are adjacent to each other in a fasciculus lie parallel. The striped fibres are cylindrical or laterally com- pressed] they usually taper off at their extremities, and apparently do not, even in muscles with long fasciculi, exceed 1£ inch in length. The transverse diameter of the striped fibres varies, in different localities in the human body, from jfoth to ^^th inch, according to the measure- ments of Kolliker. Much wider differences in diameter are found in the animal series, in insects the fibres being of extreme minuteness, whilst in cold-blooded animals they are much larger than in man and mammals.181 MUSCULAR TISSUE. If a fibre be carefully separated from a fasciculus, and examined microscopically by transmitted light, transverse stripes may be readily seen to extend across it from side to side. These transverse strife are not mere surface marks, but, as Bowman pointed out, pass through its entire thickness, and lie parallel to each other. The stria- tion is due to the structure of the fibre, which consists, as was shown by Dobie in 1848, of two kinds of sarcous matter, of dark and light bands or discs, alternately dark and light. The discs differ, according to Briicke, in optical properties, the light discs refracting the light singly are isotropic; whilst the dark discs refract light doubly, and consist of an anisotropic substance. Dobie described in 1848 a dark line passing across the light disc, so as to subdivide it into two halves, which line Busk and Huxley showed to be dotted; and this appearance has also been figured by Sharpey, Krause, and others. It is believed to be due to the presence of a strongly refracting stripe in the middle of the feebly refracting light disc. Dobie, and more recently Hensen, have directed attention to a slender, feebly refracting stripe passing transversely across the strongly refracting dark disc, so as to subdivide it also into two halves. In addition to the transverse strife, the fibres not unfrequently show markings which extendF versei^A6tripned longitudinally, but these are irregular in masculai flbre- position, do not correspond to the whole length of the fibre, or necessarily pass through its entire thickness. The transverse and longitudinal markings indicate that182 ANATOMY. a muscular fibre has a disposition to split up transversely or longitudinally into smaller particles. The transverse subdivision of the fibre is promoted by digesting a piece of muscle for some hours in dilute hydrochloric acid. If the fibres be then examined, gaps or fissures will be seen to extend transversely into the substance of the fibre; and, if the digestion has been sufficiently pro- longed, the fissures have extended com- pletely across the fibre, and have sub- Fig. go.—a nmscu-(Jjyided it into a multitude of plate or lar fibre cleaving 1 discsVeiSely int0 disc-shaped bodies — the muscular-fibre discs. These discs are the strongly and feebly refracting discs already described, and the trans- verse diameter of each disc corresponds to that of the fibre from which it has been derived. The longitudinal marks in the fibre are best seen by digest- ing a piece of muscle in strong spirit of wine, or in a solution of chromic acid. If a fibre so treated be teased out with needles, and the thin covering glass be smartly tapped, the fibre will split up longitudinally into multitudes of minute, elongated threads—the muscular-fibre fib- rillce. A fibrilla may be regarded as eemailing in length the fibre of which it Fig. 61.—A mnscu- 1 ° lav fibre cleaving formed a part, and Idee the fibre is trans- longitudinally into 1 _ . fibrillin. versely striped; but its breadth is not definite, and depends upon the minuteness with which the fibre has been split up in the longitudinal direction.MUSCULAR TISSUE. 183 If in the same fibre the processes of transverse and longitudinal splitting were to go on simultaneously, then the fibre would be resolved into an immense multitude of rectangular particles—the sarcous elements of Bow- man. If these particles be regarded as the ultimate sub- divisions of the fibre, then the discs may be conceived to be built up of a number of these particles, possessing similar optical properties, arranged side by side, so as to occupy the entire diameter of the fibre in any transverse plane: whilst the fibrillse are built up of the particles arranged end to end, so as to correspond to the entire length of the fibre; but in this longitudinal arrangement, particles with different optical properties, the one singly refracting, the other doubly refracting, alternate with each other with the utmost regularity. Thin describes the fibrillse as collected into parallel bundles, which are separated from adjacent bundles by spaces lined by flat cells. These spaces he believes to be continuous through holes in the sarcolemma, which admit the nerves, with lymph spaces outside the sarcolemma, which lie between it and the perimysium. Another view of the structure of muscular fibre, based on observations on the fibres of the water-beetle, has just been advanced by E. A. Schafer. He describes the dark, or, as seen in a living fibre, the “ dim discs,” as traversed by multitudes of excessively fine, dark, rod-shaped particles parallel in their direction to the fibre itself, which extend into the contiguous bright discs, near the middle of which each muscle rod ends in a knob-like extremity, and the series of knobs form a line of minute dark dots, passing transversely across each bright disc. The muscle rods areANATOMY. 184 imbedded in a “ground-substance,” that forms the alter- nating dim and bright discs, which substance he believes to be anisotropous, whilst the muscle rods are isotropous. He regards the ground-substance as the true contractile part of the fibre. Each transversely striped fibre is invested by a homo- geneous membrane, the sarcolemma or myolemma, which is so transparent as to allow the characteristic transverse strife to be distinctly seen through it. The sarcolemma is so closely incorporated with the periphery of the fibre, that its isolation and demonstration as a distinct membrane in the fibres of the mammalia are attended with some difficulty; but when water is added to the living fibre of frogs and fish, it is absorbed, and elevates the sarcolemma from the sarcous contractile particles. Thin describes the sarcolemma as covered by a layer of flat cells. If acetic acid be added to a muscular fibre the transverse strife become less distinct, and a number of oval bodies come into view. These are especially to be seen next the periphery of the fibre in relation to the inner surface of the sarcolemma, though some apparently lie deeper in the substance of the fibre. These bodies have long been known as the nuclei of the striped fibre. More recent investigations have, how- ever, shown that each nucleus lies in a little finely-dotted protoplasm, which often extends in a fusiform manner beyond the ends of the nucleus. These nuclei, with their investing protoplasm, have the anatomical characters of nucleated cells, and are called the muscle corpuscles. Some peculiar modifications of the striped muscular fibre are met with in cei’tain localities. As a rule, this form of fibre does not branch • but in the muscles of the tongue185 MUSCULAR TISSUE. and lip, and other muscles of the face, these fibres usually branch prior to their insertion, and the branches taper off to finely attenuated ends. In the heart also the fibres branch; and the branches of adjacent fibres anastomose, so that the muscular wall of this organ consists of a compact network of fibres; the individual fibres are smaller than those of the volun- tary muscles, the transverse striation is much less distinct, and it is doubtful if an investing sarcolemma be present. Some difficulty has been experienced in determining the exact mode of connection of the fibres of the belly of a muscle with those of its terminal tendons. By some it has been supposed that the fibres of the muscle are directly continued into the con- nective tissue bundles of the tendon; whilst Flof theTundies of Weismann has described the muscular fibre as terminating in a sharply-defined, rounded, or pointed extremity, to which the fibres of the tendons are closely apposed. Both the striped and non-striped forms of muscle are well provided with blood-vessels, which ramify in the sub- stance of the muscle lying in the areolar connective tissue, or perimysium, that separates the fasciculi and fibres from each other. The capillaries form an elongated network, the principal strands of which lie parallel to the muscular fibres, but never penetrate the sarcolemma. Hence, though the belly of a muscle is a highly vascular organ, its individual fibres are extra-vascular. But if Thin’s observations be fibrillte of the muscular fibre of the mouse with the bundles of the tendon. (From Thin.)ANATOMY. 186 correct, spaces in tlie interior of the muscular fibres are continuous with the lymphatic system. The vascularity of the fleshy belly is much greater than that of the terminal tendons of attachment, and the nutritive changes are much more active in it than in them. The mode of termination of nerves in muscle will be considered in the section on nervous tissue. The contractile fibro-cells of the non-striped muscular fibre are formed by the gradual elongation of the rounded cells of the middle germinal layer, or mesoblast, of the embryo into spindle-shaped cells, the oval nuclei at the same time becoming elongated, so as to assume a rod- shaped form. Usually the spindle cells which lie in the same linear series become cemented together into the smooth fibres of this form of muscle. The mode of development of the striped fibre from the mesoblast cells is more difficult to follow out, and various statements have been made as to the successive stages of its formation. Schwann believed that a fibre was built up of the embryonic cells of the part, which arranged themselves in linear series, coalescing with each other at their surfaces of contact; that the contents of the cells then became transversely striated, and that the cell walls formed the sarcolemma. Savory and Lockhart Clarke maintained that a formation of blastema took place around free nuclei, and that this blastema gradually assumed the striated character. Remak, Ivolliker, \\ ilson Fox, and Frey have, however, by studying the earliest stages of development in the very young embryo, estab- lished the fact that the striped fibres are developed from the cells of the embryo, though not in the manner describedMUSCULAR TISSUE. 187 by Schwann. The process, briefly stated, is as follows : The embryonic cells elongate, the nucleus may remain single, but more usually it divides and subdivides, so that many nuclei appear in the interior of the elongated cell. The nuclei he in linear series, and may either be separated from each other, or two or more may be in contact, and they may he either near the periphery of the elongated ceh, or in its axis. With this multiplication of the nuclei, the cell increases in length and assumes the form of a fibre. The ceh protoplasm, both in the single and many-nucleated fibres, then differentiates into the sarcous particles of the transverse striae, and as this progresses the fibre assumes its characteristic striped appearance. The whole amount of the protoplasm does not, however, assume the transversely striped appearance, for a small quantity remains around each nucleus and forms with it a muscle corpuscle. The differentiation of the protoplasm occasions an anatomical and chemico-physical change in the fibre, and confers on it the property of energetic contractility. W. Engelmann has endeavoured to show that the opaque anisotropic discs of the fibre are those in which the power of contractility resides, and that the clear isotropic discs possess only elastic properties. The mode of development of the sarcolemma is still somewhat obscure. By some it is regarded as the wall of the embryonic cells, which have become metamorphosed into muscular fibres j by others it is regarded as a special differentiation of the protoplasm at the periphery of the fibre taking place at the time when the transverse strife are being formed; whilst by others it is considered to be a special modification of connective tissue formed around the fibre. In the development of the muscular fibres of188 ANATOMY. the heart, the cells of the embryo heart branch and anasto- mose, and the nuclei multiply. By the transverse striation of the protoplasm of these cells the branched muscular fibres of the heart are produced. In the growth of a muscle the individual fibres increase in size, so that they are bigger in the adult than at the time of birth. The observations of Budge, Weismann, and Beale show that new fibres may also form in a muscle. Weismann believes that this increase may be due to a longitudinal splitting of a pre-existing fibre; but Beale maintains that the new fibres are produced in the muscle in the same manner as the original fibres of the part. The Nervous Tissue and the tissues which form the Blood and Lymph Vessels will be described in the chapters on the Nervous and Vascular systems.CHAPTER V. NERVOUS SYSTEM. The Nervous System consists of a number of organs which are named respectively Nerve Centres, Nerves, and Peripheral End-organs. The largest and most important Nerve Centres are the brain and spinal cord, which together constitute the cerebro-spinal nervous axis, and are lodged in the cranial cavity and spinal canal. But, in addition, numerous small bodies, usually oval in form, technically called ganglia, are situated in other localities, and form smaller nerve centres. The Nerves are white cords or threads which traverse the different regions of the body, both axial and appendicular, for a greater or less distance, for the purpose of connecting together the other sub-divisions of the nervous system. The Peripheral End-organs are minute structures connected with the peripheral extrem- ities of the nerves. These end-organs are situated in the skin and other organs of sense, in the glands, blood-vessels, and muscles. The nerves establish communications and con- duct nervous impulses, either between different nerve centres, or between nerve centres and peripheral end-organs, so as to associate together in their action parts of the nervous system often widely separated from each other. Nerves, therefore, are internuncial structures. When a nerve con- nects two nerve centres together it is intercentral. When190 ANATOMY. a nerve connects a nerve centre with a peripheral end- organ, and conducts impulses from the centre to the end-organ, it is a centro-peripheral or centrifugal nerve. When a nerve connects a peripheral end-organ with a centre, and conducts impulses from the end-organ to the centre, it is a periphero-central or centripetal nerve. Owing to the different directions in which impulses are con- ducted by nerves, the varying nature of their end-organs, and the structural and functional differentiation of the nerve centres, of portions of the nerve centres in which their central extremities terminate, nerves vary so in their functions, that a classification of the nerves, based upon their functional properties, has been proposed. Of the centro-peripheral nerves, those which end in, and conduct impulses to the muscles are motor nerves; those which end in, and conduct impulses to the muscular coat of the blood-vessels are vaso-motor nerves ; those which terminate in connection with, and conduct impulses to the secreting cells of a gland, are secretory nerves; whilst some physio- logists have named nerves which they believe to terminate in the tissues and to conduct impulses for the regulation of their nutrition, trophic nerves. It should be stated, how- ever, that it is not yet absolutely determined that the cell elements of the tissues have special nerves terminating in connection with them for the purpose of exercising a direct influence over their nutrition. Should these special nerves be non-existent, then the nutritive functions would be influenced solely by the vaso-motor nerves, which regulate the size of the blood-vessels and the amount of blood which flows through a part in a given time. Certain nerves which conduct impulses, by virtue of which the191 NERVOUS SYSTEM. functional activity of a part is arrested or diminished, are called inhibitory nerves. Of the periphero-central nerves, those which arise in the end-organs in the skin, terminate in a nerve centre, and induce in it the molecular changes which give rise to the sensation of touch, are nerves of common sensation; those which arise in the end-organs in the eye, ear, nose, and tongue, and induce in their appro- priate nerve centres the sensations of sight, sound, smell, and taste, are nerves of special sense; whilst nerves which conduct impulses from peripheral end-organs to a nerve centre, and, instead of inducing in the latter a sensation, have the impulses reflected to other nerves, are reflex nerves. When the impulses are reflected to motor nerves, they are excito-motory; to secretory nerves, excito-secretory; to inhibitory nerves, excito-inhibitory. In some fishes which possess electrical organs, nerves, named electric nerves, conduct impulses to, and set in activity the batteries from which electrical shocks are discharged. The nerve centres, nerves, and peripheral end-organs are arranged in two groups or systems—a Cerebro-spinal and a Sympathetic. The Cerebro-spinal nervous system con- sists of the brain and spinal cord, the nerves which arise from or terminate in these large centres, the small ganglia connected with these nerves, and the end-organs at their peripheral terminations. The Sympathetic nervous system consists of the sympathetic ganglia, with their nerves and end-organs.ANATOMY. 192 Nervous Tissue. The several parts of the nervous system are not uniform in colour, some being white, others grey. The nerves, at least those of the cerebro-spinal system, are invariably white, and white masses, variable in size, are met with in the brain and spinal cord; they constitute the white matter of the nervous system. In the nerve centres, both of the cerebro-spinal and sympathetic systems, grey matter is found, sometimes in considerable quantities. This grey colour is so characteristic, that it may be regarded as marking the position of a nerve centre. The nervous system possesses a characteristic form of tissue—the nervous tissue—which in part consists of fibres (Nerve Fibres),and in part of cells (Nerve Cells). The nerve cells are found in the grey matter—that is, in the nerve centres—and sometimes also in the peripheral end-organs. The nerve fibres constitute the nerves, enter into the nerve centres, and pass into the peripheral end-organs; they form the white matter. But in addition to the characteristic nervous tissue, the nervous system also contains a con- siderable quantity of connective tissue, numerous blood- vessels, and some lymph vessels. Nerve Fibres.—Nerve fibres are of two kinds: a, the white, medullated, or dark-bordered fibres, which are the characteristic fibres of the cerebro-spinal nervous system, though they do also sparingly occur in the sympathetic system; b, the pale, non-medullated, or gelatinous nerve fibres, which are the characteristic fibres of the sympa- thetic nervous system. Medullated Nerve Fibres.—To examine the structure of193 NERVOUS TISSUE. these fibres, a portion of a eerebro-spinal nerve may be selected. In the first place, it will be seen to be invested by a sheath of connective tissue, the perineurium, which gives off processes that pass into the nerve, and subdivide it into fasciculi or funiculi. Each fasciculus is in its turn composed of nerve fibres, which are separated from each other by bundles of delicate connective tissue, prolonged from the perineurium, in which the nutrient blood- vessels of the nerve ramify. The perineurial connective tissue investing a fasciculus, presents, when treated with nitrate of silver, polygonal markings, which, as Ranvier showed, are the outlines of a layer of flat endothelial- like cells. The size of a nerve is in relation to the number and size of its fasciculi, and the size of a fasciculus is in relation to the number of its fibres. The fibres and the fasciculi lie parallel to each other in the same nerve; but as nerves branch at intervals, the more external of the fasciculi diverge from the main stem to form the branches. In the white matter of the brain and spinal cord the nerve fibres are not arranged in such definite fasciculi as in a distributory nerve, and the con- nective tissue between the fibres is the soft, delicate form called neuroglia. A medullated nerve fibre is an elongated cylinder, which, when examined in the body of a living animal, or im- mediately after removal from the living body, consists apparently of a soft, homogeneous, or glassy-looking sub- stance enclosed within a limiting membrane. When ex- amined some time after death, or after the addition of re- agents, such as water, spirit, ether, collodion, acetic acid, &c., it loses its homogeneous aspect, and the following struc- NANATOMY. 194 tures can be distinguished in it: a (Fig. 63), a delicate trans- parent investing membrane,—the so-called tubular or 'primitive membrane, or neuri- lemma ; c, a delicate thread, extending along the axis of the fibre,—the axial cylinder or central band of Remak ; b, a substance which lies be- tween the primitive mem- brane and the axial cylin- der,—the white substance of Schwann, or the medvUary mitive nicnibrancl'i?the medullary sheath. Within the external trading beyondathe1 broken end of outline of the fibre, formed by the fibre. 3. Transverse section . through the meduiiated fibres of a the investing membrane, is a nerve, showing the axial cylinder in n i the centre of each fibre. Between the second line, liot quite parallel fibres is the interfibrous connective tissue. to the first, and the presence of these two lines gives to the fibre a characteristic double-contoured appearance. The investing membrane is a perfectly pellucid, homogeneous structure, with nuclei arranged at intervals in it. It is believed to be absent from the nerve fibres in the brain and spinal cord, as well as at the peripheral terminations of many nerves. The medullary sheath is a fatty and albuminous sub- stance, which refracts the light strongly. Rot unfre quently it collects into little ball-like masses, and some- times causes irregular bulgings on the fibre, and pro- duces a knotted, varicose appearance; at other times it becomes granular, and makes the fibre opaque. By gentle pressure it can be squeezed out of the broken end of a fibre. Ranvier has described the medullary sheath as,NERVOUS TISSUE. 195 divided into segments from breaks in its continuity, occur- ring at intervals in the fibre. These breaks have been called the nodes of Ranvier. The axial cylinder is, however, pro- longed across the node from one segment to the other, and is surrounded at the node merely by the primitive membrane. The axial cylinder is a pale, grey, cylindriform band, usually about one-third or one-fourth the diameter of the fibre, which possesses more tenacity than the medullary sheath, and not unfrequently, as in Fig. 63, 2, projects for some distance beyond the broken end of a fibre. Max Schultze showed that it is not homogeneous, but exhibits a very delicate longitudinal fibrillation, and at the ends of the nerves these primitivefiibrillce may separate from each other. Although from its great delicacy the axial cylinder can- not be seen in the living fibre of a cerebro-spinal nerve, yet there are many reasons for regarding it as a structure existing in the living nerve, and not the product of a post mortem change. It is the part of a fibre which first appears in the course of development—the medullary sheath and primitive membrane being secondary investing structures, superadded as development proceeds. It forms not un- frequently the only constituent of a nerve fibre at its central and peripheral terminations, and is therefore the part of the fibre which is anatomically continuous with the nerve cell, or with the peripheral end-organ. As it is the sole constituent of many nerve fibres at their terminations, and of all nerve fibres in the earlier stage of development, and as it forms the medium of connection between them and the structures in which they terminate, it is obviously of primary importance, both anatomically and physiologi-196 ANATOMY. cally, and is believed to bo tbe part of the fibre directly concerned in tbe conduction of nervous impulses; whilst tbe investing structures serve tbe purpose of insulating mate- rials. Lister and I pointed out, in 1859, that essential differences in chemical composition existed between tbe axial cylinder and tbe medullary sheath ; tbe former being unaffected by chromic acid, though the latter is lendered opaque and brown, and concentrically striated under its influence ; while, on the other hand, the axial cylinder is stained red by an ammoniacal solution of carmine with great facility, although the medullary sheath is unaffected by it. We further showed that these differences in the mode of action of chromic acid and carmine might advantageously be employed in the demonstration of the structure of nerve fibres. Ranke has subsequently stated that the axial cylinder possesses an acid, and the medullary sheath an alkaline reaction. The presence of a layer of flat cells between the primitive membrane and the white medullary substance has recent!} been described by Thin. Medullated nerve fibres vary materially in diameter m different parts of the nervous system. In the brain, for instance, they are sometimes as fine as the -nro-o~oth inch; whilst, in the distributory nerves, fibres of TsV^h an inch in diameter may be seen ; though it should be stated that, even in the nerves of distribution, fibres of great minuteness are often placed in the same bundle with those of the largest size. Nerve fibres do not branch in tlieii course, but only at their central or peripheral terminations, and much more frequently at the latter than the former. Non-medullated Nerve Fibres.—These fibres, which areNERVOUS TISSUE. 197 characterised by the absence of a medullary sheath, are chiefly found in the sympathetic nervous system, but they occur also in the cerebro-spinal system. The fibres of the olfactory nerve are non-medullated, so also are the peri- pheral terminations of the cerebro-spinal nerves, and indeed all nerve fibres in the first stage of their development. In Petromyzon it has been stated that all the nerve fibres are distinguished by the absence of a medullary sheath. This form of nerve fibre consists of pale grey, translucent, flattened bands, the ggVffth to ¥oVoth ^nc^L diameter. They usually appear as if homo- geneous or faintly granular; but Schultze showed that, when carefully examined, they present a delicate fibrillated appearance, like that seen in the axial cylinder of a medullated nerve; hence, like that cylinder, they are supposed to be composed of multitudes of extremely delicate primitive fibrilke imbedded in a finely granulated material. Sometimes these fibres consist solely of this fibrillated material, at other times they are invested by Fig. 64. — Koit- a sheath similar to the primitive membrane medullated nerve fibres of a medullated fibre. Nuclei are also found from the sym- pathetic sys- both in the substance of the fibre and in tem- relation with the primitive membrane. The presence of multitudes of fibres in the sympathetic nervous system, formed either entirely, or almost entirely, of a material precisely similar in structure to the axial cylinder of a medullated fibre, and by which the proper function of the fibre can alone, therefore, be exercised, is, of course, an additional argument to those previously advanced, inANATOMY. 198 favour of the existence of the axial cylinder as a normal constituent of the fibre, and of its functional importance. Nerve Cells.—Nerve cells constitute an important division of the nervous tissue. They are the characteristic structures in the nerve centres, are susceptible to impressions, or nervous impulses, and are the texture in which the molecular changes occur that produce or disengage the special form of energy named nerve energy, the evolution of which is the distinc- tive mark of a nerve centre. The central extremities of the nerve fibres lie in relation to, and are often directly con- tinous with, the nerve cells. It was at one time thought that nerve cells were globular in form; but it is now gene- rally understood that, though the body of the cell is not unfrequently globular, two or more processes or poles project from it, and are continuous with its substance. Nerve cells are distinctly nucleated; the nuclei are usually large, and contain one, and often two nucleoli. The cell substance is granular and fibrillated, and not unfrequently brown or yellow pigment is collected around the nucleus. A cell wall is sometimes apparently present, though at others it cannot be demonstrated. The nerve cells in the grey matter of the brain and spinal cord are imbedded in the neuroglia. In the smaller nerve centres, as the sympathetic ganglia and the ganglia on the posterior roots of the spinal nerves, the nerve cells are surrounded by a capsule of connective tissue. Frantzel, Kolliker, and others, ha\e described this capsule as lined by an endothelium formed of flattened cells. Nerve cells from which two poles or processes proceed are called bipolar. Characteristic specimens of these cells, as was first pointed out by Robin and R. Wagner, may be199 NERVOUS TISSUE. recognised without difficulty in the ganglia on the posterior roots of the spinal nerves of fishes, and it is probable that similar cells exist in the corresponding centres in other vertebrates. These cells usually possess a globular body, though sometimes it maybe elongated; and from, opposite points of the surface of the body a strong process is given off, which is directly continued into a nerve fibre. The axial cylinder of the fibre is con- tinuous with the cell substance, and Schultze has shown that both exhibit a delicate fibrillated structure. The medul- Fig 65. — Mpoia r 1-ary sheath and the primitive membrane nerve fibres con- , . , tinuous with it, from axe also usually continued from tne nbre the spinal ganglion ,, i • i of a skate, over the nerve cell Hence these bipolar cells seem to be, as Schultze expressed it, nucleated enlargements of the axial cylinder. A remarkable modification of the bipolar nerve cell, carefully studied and described by Lionel Beale, is found in the sympathetic ganglia of the frog. The cells are pear-shaped, and from the narrow end of the pear two nerve fibres arise, one of which, called the straight fibre, forms, as it were, the stalk of the pear; whilst the other, or spiral fibre, winds spirally round the straight fibre, and then passes away from the cell in the opposite direction. Both fibres are nucleated, and at their origin consist, apparently, of axial cylinder substance only; but in their course they may acquire both a medullary sheath and a primitive membrane. The straight fibre passes into the interior of the cell substance, and Arnold and Courvoisier200 ANATOMY. believe that they have traced it into the nucleus ■ but the spiral fibre apparently arises nearer the periphery of the cell. The pyriform cells are invested by a distinct capsule of connective tissue. The nerve fibres of these pyriform cells, although they both arise close together from one end of the cell, represent its poles. Should one of the poles, either in this, or in the bipolar form of nerve cell described in the preceding paragraph, be from any cause removed or not de- veloped, then the cell would be unipolar ; and if both poles were absent it would be apolar.

Cells of this kind are called multipolar, and in many localities they pre- sent characteristic forms. In the grey matter of the spinal cord, more especially in its anterior horn, they give rise to numerous processes, and have a stellate or radiate form (Fig. 68). In the grey matter on the surface of the convolutions of the F7rom’human'sympa- cerebrum they are pyramidal in shape; capsule811^1'connect the apex is directed to the surface of the tive tissue.

In the grey matter on the surface of the cerebellum the body of the cell is almost globular ; from that aspect of the cell which is directed towards the white matter a slender central process arises 3 from the opposite or peripheral aspect of the cell two strong, antler- like branching processes extend for a considerable distance (Fig. 82). In the human sympathetic gan- glia, again, the stellate form of cell prevails, and the existence of a cap- sule of connective tissue around the individual cells can be recognised (Fig. 67). The processes which arise from a multi- polar nerve cell, as a rule, divide and sub- j.IG.gg—Multipolar cell from the grey matter divide as they pass away from the body of the cell, continuous with a nerve flbl'e' until at last they give rise to branches of extreme tenuity. These branching processes apparently consist exclusively of cell protoplasm, and have been called protoplasm processes. Gerlach has described the proto- plasm processes of the multipolar nerve cells of the brain and spinal cord as forming an excessively minute network, from which minute medullated nerve fibres arise; and F. Boll conceives that a similar arrangement occurs in the cells of the cerebellum. One, at least, of the processes of a multipolar nerve cell does not branch, but becomes directlyANATOMY. 202 continuous with a nerve fibre, and has been named the axial- cylinder process (Fig. 68). This process was first recog- nised by Deiters in the cells of the spinal cord; but Hadlich and Koschennikoff have since described the central process of the cells of the cerebellum as continuous with a medullated nerve fibre; and the latter observer has pointed out, that from the base of a pyramidal nerve cell in a cerebral con- volution a process may be traced directly into a nerve fibre. Hence it would appear that the multipolar nerve cells may have two modes of union with nerve fibres—one directly through the passage of the non-branched axial-cylinder pro- cess into a fibre, the other through the origin of fibres from the minute network in which the branched protoplasm processes terminate. The branched processes of adjacent nerve cells may also blend with each other, so as to form an anastomosing cell network, though these anastomoses are, in all probability, not so frequent as was at one time supposed. Schultze has pointed out that not only .the protoplasm substance of the body of a multipolar nerve cell, but both the non-branched and branched processes, possess a fibrillated structure similar to that described by him in the axial cylinder of the nerve fibres. Peripheral End-Organs or End Bodies. Neive fibies at their peripheral extremities terminate in connection with peculiar structures, named end-bodies, terminal bodies, or peri- pheral end-organs, which are situated in the several organs of the body. The motor nerves end in the voluntary and in- voluntary muscles; the vaso-motor nerves end in the mus- cular coat of the blood-vessels; the sensory nerves end in the skin, mucous membranes, and organs of special sense; and it is probable that secretory nerves terminate in con-NERVOUS TISSUE. 203 nection with the ultimate cell elements of the secreting glands. The end-organs, connected with the terminations of the nerves in these textures, possess certain structural peculiarities, which are by no means uniform in the different parts, so that the end-body connected with the peripheral termination of a nerve is distinctive of the organ in which it is situated. It will be a matter of convenience to defer the consideration of the peripheral end-bodies in the skin, organs of special sense, and the several glands, until these parts are described. In this chapter the mode of termination of the motor nerves in the voluntary and involuntary muscles, of the sensory nerves in the mucous membranes, and of the ending of the nerves in the remark- able bodies named Pacinian corpuscles, will alone be examined. After a nerve has entered a voluntary muscle it ramifies in the connective tissue, which lies between the fasciculi, and at the same time divides and subdivides into smaller branches. These branches interlace with each other and form plexuses, from which slender nervous twigs, often consisting of only a single medullated nerve fibre, pro- ceed, which ramify in the connective tissue, separating the individual muscular fibres from each other. The single nerve fibres in their turn branch, accompanied by a splitting of the axial cylinder, and these branches usually lose the medullated character. The mode of termination of these very delicate branches has been a subject of much dispute. Beale described them as forming a minute net- work, situated on the exterior of the sarcolemma, but in contact with it, and the fibres of this nervous network were distinctly nucleated. Other observers have, however,204 ANATOMY. described peculiar bodies, called motorial end-plates, at the extremity of these nerves. These end-plates consist of a clump of richly nucleated protoplasm, somewhat oval or perhaps irregular in form, into which the axial cylinder of the nerve fibre penetrates. The exact position of these end-plates in relation to the muscular fibres is difficult to determine. Krause holds that they lie outside the sarco- lemma, but adherent to it; whilst Kiihne, Margo, and Rouget maintain that the end-plate lies within the sarco- lemma, and that the nerve fibre has to pierce that mem- brane before it can enter the end-plate. After the axial cylinder has entered the end-plate it subdivides into very minute branches. Each muscular fibre has apparently only a single end-plate, and consequently only a single nerve axial cylinder in connection with it. In the non-striped muscles the nerves are distributed in the connective tissue which separates the fasciculi from each other. Here they form plexuses, which, as was shown by Beale, in the coats of the arteries, in the myenteric plexus of Auerbach, in the muscular coat of the intestines, in the muscular coat of the bladder and elsewhere, have collections of nerve cells, forming microscopic ganglia lying in them. From these plexuses fibres arise which subdivide into delicate non-medullated fibres possessing nuclei. These delicate fibres form still finer plexuses, which in their turn give origin to minute fibres, which pass between the muscular fibre cells to form a still more minute intra- muscular network. Frankenhauser maintains that the delicate nerve fibrils which arise from this terminal nctv ork penetrate the muscular fibre cells, enter the nucleus, and terminate in the nucleolus; but Arnold considers that, afterNERVOUS TISSUE. 205 having entered the nucleus, the fibril again gives off a filament, which passes out of the cell to join the intra- muscular plexus) the ending of the nerve, therefore, within the nucleus is only apparent, and is rather to be regarded as the nodal point of a fine intra-nuclear plexus. The termination of the sensory nerves in the mucous mem- branes has been especially studied in the conjunctiva, the mucous membrane of the soft palate, and the glans of the penis and clitoris. In these parts Krause discovered oval or globular end-bodies, which consisted of a soft, homogeneous substance invested by a nucleated capsule of connective tissue. A nerve fibre pierces the capsule and terminates in the interior of the end-body, which forms a bulbous enlarge- ment at the end of the nerve, and is called the end-bulb. After the nerve has entered the end-bulb, it may consist only of the axial cylinder and terminate in a pointed extremity, or it may twist upon itself and form a coil within the end-bulb. When the structure of the skin is described, it will be seen that the ending of the nerves in the cutaneous papillse bears a general resemblance to their termination in the end-bulbs of a mucous membrane. In certain of the mucous membranes delicate nerves have been traced into the layer of epithelium, situated on the free surface of the membrane. Petermoller described nerve fibres continuous with the nerves of the cornea pass- ing into the layer of conjunctival epithelium on the front of the cornea. Klein recognised an intra-epithelial nervous network in the same locality. Chrschtschonovitsch traced non - medullated nerve fibres proceeding from a sub- epithelial network into the deeper epithelial layers of the vaginal mucous membrane, and similar nerve fibres have206 ANATOMY. been seen by Elin to end in tbe epithelial investment of the mucous membrane of the mouth. Connected with the sensory nerves in some localities are the remarkable bodies named the Corpuscles of Pacini, which were the first terminal organs discovered in connec- tion with the peripheral distribution of the nerves. These corpuscles have been found attached to the nerves which pass to the skin of the fingers and toes, to the nerves which supply the skin of the neck and arm, to the inter- costal nerves, to the nerves of the joints, to the nerves of the periosteum, to the nerves of the genital organs, and to the mesenteric nerves. In cats they are often extremely abundant both in the mesentery and omenta. A Pacinian corpuscle can be seen by the naked eye, and looks like a minute grain from y-gth to y-gtk inch long. It is elliptical in form, and may either be sessile or attached to the nerve stem by a slender stalk. Examined microscopically, it is seen to consist of numerous layers of connective tissue concentrically arranged, which form its capsule, and surround a central core of transparent homogeneous proto- plasm. Numerous connective tissue corpuscles may be seen in the concentric layers, and Hoyer has recently shown that an appearance of flat endothelial-like cells exists on the inner surface of the layers of the capsule. Entering one pole of the corpuscle is a nerve fibre which extends along the axial core for a considerable distance, and usually termi- nates in a slight bulbous enlargement. The nerve fibre parts with its perineurial sheath after it enters the Pacinian corpuscle; and as it lies in the core it loses its medullary sub- stance, so that its terminal part consists only of the axial cylinder. Sometimes the nerve fibre dividesintotwobranchesNERVOUS TISSUE. 207 Fig. 69.—1.

The mode of origin of the nervous tissue in the course of development of the embryo is still involved in some obscurity. It has, however, been ascertained that the cells, both of the epiblast and mesoblast, participate in its formation. The nerve cells of the brain and spinal cord, and the nerve fibres also, either altogether or in great part, are derived from the cells of the epiblast, whilst the distributory nerves, both cranial and spinal (except the olfactory bulb and peduncle and the optic nerve), the ganglia situated on these nerves, and the ganglia and distributory nerve fibres of the sympathetic system, are differentiations of the cells of the mesoblast. The embryo cells multiply by division, and possess at first a rounded form. They then assume characteristically granular and finely fibrillated contents, and processes or poles appear at the periphery of the cells, which, according to the observations of Beale, connect adjacent cells together. As the growth of the part goes on, the cells are more widely separated from each other, and the anastomosing processes in consequence become considerably elongated, and form the axial cylinder of the nerve fibre. In the course of time the medullary sheath and the primitive membrane may form around this axial cylinder so as to insulate it. The exact mode of formation of the medullary sheath is not properly understood; but it is believed that the primi- tive membrane, and the perineurial connective tissue, are derived from those surrounding embryonic cells which differentiate into connective tissue. Of tlie two originall} contiguous cells from which the nerve fibre is, as it were,209 NERVOUS TISSUE. spun out, one, according to Hensen, may form a cell in a nerve centre, the other may differentiate into a peripheral end-organ. In the tail of the tadpole the formation and growth of nerve fibres have been studied by Kolliker, and it has been seen that the terminal part of a fibre may have fusiform or tri-radiate cells connected with it, the processes of which cells gradually differentiate into nerve fibres. Others again maintain that elongation of the embryonic cells, destined to become nerve fibres, takes place, that these elongated cells join end to end, and that in this manner the fibres are built up. The young cerebro- spinal nerve fibres are distinctly nucleated, and correspond in appearance and structural characters to the non- medullated nerve fibres of the adult. If in a young or adult person a nerve be cut across, its conducting power is destroyed; but after a time it reunites, and its function is restored. The part of the nerve which lies between the place of section and its peripheral extremity, undergoes, as Waller pointed out, degenerative changes. To how great an extent the de- generation affects the various constituents of each fibre, it is difficult to determine; for whilst some experiments would seem to show that only the medullary sheath broke up into granular particles and was absorbed, in others both it and the axial cylinder disappeared. In process of time however, these parts may be reproduced, and the nerve then recovers its functional activity. 0ANATOMY. 210 Descriptive Anatomy of the Cerebro-spinal Nervous System. In this section the anatomy of the Brain and Spinal Cord, and of the numerous distributory Nerves which arise from them, will be described. The brain and spinal cord are the largest and most important of all the nerve centres. They occupy the cranial cavity and spinal canal, and are continuous with each other through the foramen magnum in the occipital bone. As the arrangement of the struc- tures which compose the brain and spinal cord is extremely complex, and as the names applied to the several parts are numerous and often very arbitrary, it may be well, before commencing a detailed description, to make a few general observations on their mode of development. Development of the Cerebro-Spinal Nervous Axis.—In order to comprehend the development of the cerebro-spinal nervous axis, it will he necessary to say a few words on the arrangement of, and early changes in the germinal membrane or blastoderm in the ovum of the vertebrata. This membrane con- sists of three layers of cells, the outer, middle, and inner germinal layers of Remak and many other German em- ' bryologists, or the Fig. 70. — Transverseverticnl section through the epiblast, mesoblast, blastoderm of a chick at the end of the second day. hypoblast of E, epiblast; M, mesoblast; II, hypoblast.

This depression gradually deepens and forms a groove, the dorsal, neural, or cerebro-spinal groove, the sides and bottom of which are lined by the layers of cells (Fig. 70)CEREBROSPINAL NERVOUS SYSTEM. 211 continuous with, and derived from the cells of the epiblast. The cells of the mesoblast below and at the sides of this groove then undergo changes. Those immediately below the groove dif- ferentiate into the rod-like chorda dorsalis. Those situated at the sides greatly increase in numbers, and cause the sides of the groove to he elevated into the dorsal or neural laminae. By the continued production and growth of the mesoblast cells, placed at the sides of the groove, which subsequently differentiate into the primordial vertebrae, the two dorsal laminte come in contact, the neural groove is converted into a neural, or axial, or central canal, and the epiblast cells lining it become cut off from their original con- tinuity with the other cells of the epiblast (Fig. 71), which remain as the outer layer or covering of the em- bryo, and give origin to the epidermis. The included epiblast cells form the walls of a cylindriform cerebro - spinal tube (C S). The axial canal becomes the central canal of the cerebro- spinal nervous axis; the layer of epiblast Fig.71.—Transverse vertical section through theblasto- cells next the canal derm of Bufo cinereus.

(After Schenk.) layers of epiblast cells situated peripherally to the epithelial layer dif- ferentiate into the greater part, if not the whole, of the nervous tissues of the brain and spinal cord. In the part which becomes the Spinal Cord the central canal persists as the central canal of the spinal cord and is lined by a layer of ciliated cylindrical epithelium. Out- side this layer is formed a mass of grey matter containing nerve cells, which are undoubtedly derived from the epiblast cells, and this grey matter subsequently divides into two lateral crescent-shaped masses. Outside the grey matter white matter is produced, which ultimately becomes arranged in the form of longitudinal columns of nerve fibres; it is as yet doubtful if the columns are derived from a differentiation of the epiblast, or from those mesoblast cells which immediately surround the cerebro-spinal tube. With the formation and growth of these columns and of the internal grey matter, a longi-ANATOMY. 212 tudinal mesial fissure appears on the anterior, and another on the posterior surface of the cord, which gradually increase in depth until the cord is almost completely divided into two lateral halves. At the bottom of the anterior median fissure the nerve fibres of the anterior commissure are developed, and at the bottom of the posterior median fissure those of the posterior commisswre. These commissures unite the two halves of the cord together. The upper or cerebral end of the cerebro-spinal tube becomes the Encephalon, or Brain, which organ is therefore derived from the epiblast. At first the cerebral part of the tube is uniform in appearance with the spinal part, but it soon expands into three vesicular dilatations—the primary cerebral vesicles. These vesicle's, named (from before backwards) anterior, middle, and posterior, are separated from each other hv constrictions, and as the development progresses the vesicles bend on each other and on the upper end of the spinal cord. As each vesicle is an expan- sion of the cerebro-spinal tube, it is necessarily hollow, and the space in its interior is continuous with the central canal of the. spinal cord. In the walls of the vesicles the nervous structures are produced, which form the several subdivisions of the encephalon. The posterior cerebral vesicle bends first forwards from the upper end of the spinal cord, and then backwards; the part which bends forward becomes the medulla oblongata; that which bends backward the cerebellum, whilst the pons is developed at the angle where these two parts are continuous with each other; the central hollow forms the central canal of the medulla oblongata and the dilated space called the fourth ventricle. In the medulla oblongata shallow anterior and posterior median furrows then appear continuous with those in the cord, and each lateral half differen- tiates into grey matter and into a longitudinal arrangement of nerve fibres continuous with the corresponding structures in the cord. A large proportion of these fibres is continued upwards through the pons as its longitudinal fibres. The cerebellum consists at first of a central lobe, and in the lower vertebrates its development does not proceed beyond this stage; but in mammals, including man, a lateral lobe or hemisphere is superadded on each side, and with the growth of these lateral lobes numerous transverse fibres, which connect the two hemispheres together, are developed in the pons. The cerebellum is also connected below with the medulla oblongata by the pair of restiform bodies, or inferior peduncles, and above with the corpora quadrigemina by the pair of superior peduncles. The middle cerebral vesicle bends forwards from the posteriorCEREBROSPINAL NERVOUS SYSTEM. 213 vesicle. In its roof the optic lobes are formed.; in its floor the crura cerebri; whilst the central hollow becomes the aqueduct of Sylvius. At first the optic lobes form a single structure, but about the sixth month of embryo life a median furrow divides this struc- ture into two lateral halves (the corpora bigemina), and in the lower vertebrates the development does not proceed beyond this stage; but in the seventh month of embryo life of the human fcetus each lateral half is subdivided into two by a transverse fissure, so that four bodies (the corpora quadrigemina) are produced. The crura cerebri form the two cerebral peduncles, which, diverging from each other, pass upwards to the hemisphere of the cerebrum. They consist almost entirely of nerve fibres continuous with the longitudinal fibres of the pons, a few of which go to the corpora quadrigemina, but the greater number ascend to the cerebral hemi- spheres. The anterior cerebral vesicle bends downwards from the middle vesicle. The posterior part of this vesicle is at first a simple hollow sac, but subsequently the two optic thalami form in its wall, one on each side of the central hollow, which hollow becomes the third ventricle. This ventricle is prolonged downwards into a funnel-shaped process, the infundibulum, which is connected with the pituitary body, or hypophysis cerebri, in the pituitary fossa in the sphenoid bone, whilst posteriorly the ventricle is continuous with the aqueduct of Sylvius. In its upper and posterior wall the pineal body, or epiphysis cerebri, is developed, and from this body two white peduncles run forwards on the sides of the optic thalami. Immediately below these peduncles the transverse fibres of the posterior commissure are developed, which pass between the two optic thalami. The anterior wall of this ventricle is closed in by the lamina cinerea or lamina terminalis, and behind it are formed the transverse nerve fibres of the anterior commissure, and the vertical fibres of the anterior pillars of the fornix. These fornix fibres pass to the base of the brain, and form the corpora albicantia, prior to entering the optic thalami. The posterior part of the anterior vesicle gives off from eaeh side a flask-shaped prolongation, the primary optic vesicle. The stem of the prolongation, at first hollow, becomes solid, and forms the optic nerve and tract, whilst the expanded distal end forms the nervous elements of the retina. The antero-lateral part of the anterior cerebral vesicle is prolonged forward as two hollow processes, the hemisphere vesicles, which become the cerebral hemispheres, and are separated from each other by a median longitudinal fissure; whilst the hollow in the interior214 ANATOMY. of each forms the lateral ventricle. In the floor of each hemisphere- vesicle is developed a large grey mass, striated with bundles of nerve fibres, the corpus striatum, which lies immediately! in front and to the outer side of the optic thalamus; a curved band, the taenia serrdcircularis, is formed along the junction of the thalamus with the corpus striatum, and at the inner and anterior end of this band, immediately behind the anterior pillars of the fomix, the two lateral ventricles become continuous with each other and with the third ventricle through th& foramen of Monro. The roof and side walls of each hemisphere vesicle form a grey expansion or mantle, which is at first smooth, but subsequently becomes divided into lobes and convolutions, separated from each other by fissures. A deep gap or fissure now appears on the inner wall of each hemi- sphere vesicle, and is bounded above by a longitudinal band of fibres, which, continuous anteriorly with the anterior pillar of the fornix, joins its fellow in the middle line to form the body of the fornix, and then again diverging from its fellow passes backwards, downwards, and forwards as the posterior pillar of the fornix or the taenia hippocampi. A transverse arrangement of fibres then forms in each hemisphere vesicle, above the plane of the fornix, which, reaching the mesial plane, joins its fellow, connects the two hemi- spheres together, and foims the corpus callosum. In the hirfder part this corpus rests upon the upper surface of the fornix, but more anteriorly it lies some distance above the fornix, and then bends down in front of it. Hence there is enclosed between the fornix and the antero-inferior part of the corpus callosum two thin layers of grey matter, one belonging to the inner surface of each hemisphere vesicle, and called the septum lucidum. Between these two layers is a narrow space, the fifth ventricle, which, unlike the other ventricles, is not derived from the cerebro-spiual tube, but is merely a portion of the longitudinal median fissure shut in by the develop- ment of the corpus callosum and fornix. Each hemisphere vesicle also gives olf from its anterior part a hollow process, which expands in front into a bulbous dilatation, named the olfactory bulb, from which the nerves of smell arise, whilst the stalk of the bulb solidifies and forms the olfactory peduncle. Owing to the great development of the mantle of the hemisphere vesicles in the human brain, and the size and complexity of the convolutions, these parts of the hemispheres grow forward so as to overlap the olfactory bulbs and peduncles, and backward, so as to conceal not only the corpora striata and optic thalami, but also the corpora quadrigemina, crura cerebri, cerebellum, pons, and medulla215 CEREBROSPINAL NERVOUS SYSTEM. oblongata, so that when the human brain is looked at from above, none of these structures can be seen. It is only when the brain is turned over and its base exposed that the medulla, pons, cerebellum, and crura are visible; and before the corpora quadi'igemina, optic thalami, and corpora striata can he exposed, portions of the hemi- sphere substance must he removed. The great growth of each hemi- sphere vesicle leads also to a great expansion of its central hollow or lateral ventricle, which is prolonged forwards, backwards, and downwards as the anterior, posterior, and descending cornua. In the descending cornu is a projection, the hippocampus major, along which the taenia hippocampi of the fornix runs; in the posterior cornu is a smaller eminence, the hippocampus minor; and at the junction of these two cornua is a third elevation, the eminentia collateralis. Immediately investing the spinal cord and encephalon a vascular membrane, the pia mater, is developed, processes from which dip into the fissures between the two halves of the cord and between the cerebral convolutions. A broad band, the velmiinterpositum, which possesses two marginal fringes, the choroid plexuses, is admitted into the lateral ventricle through the gap or fissure in the inner wall of each hemisphere vesicle. This fissure is bounded above by the arch-shaped fornix, with its taenia hippocampi. When the two hemispheres are in situ, and the two halves of the fornix are joined together to form the body of that structure, the fissure, with its contained velum interpositum, passes across the mesial plane from one hemisphere to the other, having the fornix and teniae for its roof, and the optic thalami and corpora quadrigemina for its floor; it is known as the great transverse fissure of the cerebrum. The mesoblast cells which constitute the proto-vertebrae dif- ferentiate, not only into the structures which form the spinal column and the muscle plates, from which the epi-skeletal muscles are derived, but into the roots of the spinal nerves, the series of ganglia on the posterior roots, and the spinal nerve-trunks formed by the junction of the anterior and posterior roots. As the walls of the body and the limbs acquire a definite shape, certain of their mesoblast cells differentiate into nerve fibres, which become con- tinuous with the spinal nerve-trunks, and form the spinal dis- tributory nerves. The cranial nerves, except the olfactory bulb and peduncle and the optic nerve, arise from the cells of the meso- blast situated at the sides of the upper or cerebral end of the cerebro- spinal tube.ANATOMY. 216 Membranes of Brain and Spinae Cord. The brain and spinal cord are invested by three mem- branes or meninges, which lie between them and the bones that form the walls of the cranial cavity and spinal canal. The membranes are named dura mater, arachnoid mater, and pia mater. Dura mater.—The most external membrane, named dura from its firmness, consists of a cranial and a spinal division. The cranial part is in contact with the inner table of the cranial bones, and is adherent along the lines of the sutures and to the margins of the foramina, which transmit the nerves, more especially to the foramen mag- num. It forms, therefore, for these bones an internal periosteum, and the meningeal arteries which ramify in it are the nutrient arteries of the inner table. As the growth of bone is more active in infancy and youth than in the adult, the adhesion between the dura mater and the cranial bones is greater in early life than at maturity. From the inner surface of the dura mater strong flattened bands pass into the cranial cavity, and form partitions between certain of the divisions of the brain. A vertical longitudinal mesial band, named, from its sickle shape, falx cerebri, dips between the two hemispheres of the cerebrum. A smaller sickle- shaped vertical mesial band, the falx cerebelli, attached to the internal occipital crest, passes between the two hemi- spheres of the cerebellum. A large band arches forward in the horizontal plane of the cavity, from the transverse groove in the occipital bone to the clinoid processes of the sphenoid, and is attached laterally to the upper border of the petrous part of each temporal bone. It separatesMEMBRANES OF BRAIN AND SPINAL CORD.. 217 the cerebrum from the cerebellum, and, as it forms a tent- like covering for the latter, is named tentorium cerebelli. Along certain lines the cranial dura mater splits into two layers, to form tubular passages for the transmission of venous blood. These passages are named- the venous blood sinuses of the dura mater, and they are lodged in the grooves on the inner surface of the skull referred to in the descrip- tion of the cranial bones. Opening into these sinuses are Fig. 72,—Dura mater and cranial sinuses. 1, Falx cerebri; 2, tentorium; 3, 3 superior longitudinal sinus; 4, lateral sinus; 5, internal jugular vein ; 6, occi- pital sinus; 6', torcular Herophili; 7, inferior longitudinal sinus; 8, veins of Galen; 9 and 10, superior and inferior petrosal sinus; 11, cavernous sinus ; 12, circular sinus, which connects the two cavernous sinuses together; 13 ophthal- mic vein, from 15, the eyeball; 14, crista galli of ethmoid bone. numerous veins, which convey from the brain the blood that has been circulating through it; and two of these sinuses, called cavernous, which lie at the sides of the body of the sphenoid bone, receive the ophthalmic veins from the eyeballs situated in the orbital cavities. These blood218 ANATOMY. sinuses pass usually from before backwards: a superior longitudinal along tbe upper border of tbe falx cerebri, fiom the crista galli to the internal occipital protuberance; an inferior longitudinal along its lower border as far as the tento- rium, where it joins the straight sinus, which passes back as far as the same protuberance. One or two small occipital sinuses, which lie in the falx cerebelli, also pass to join the straight and longitudinal sinuses opposite this protuberance; several currents of blood meet, therefore, at this spot, and as Herophilus supposed that a sort of whirlpool was formed in the blood, the name torcular Herophih has been used to express the meeting of these sinuses. Fiom the torcular the blood is drained away by two laige sinuses, named lateral, which curve forwards and down- wards to the jugular foramina to terminate in the internal jugular veins. In its course each lateral sinus receives two petroscd sinuses, a superior and an inferior, which pass from the cavernous sinus backwards along the upper and lower borders of the petrous part of the temporal bone. The spinal part of the dura mater hangs loosely in the spinal canal, and forms a tubular investment for the spinal cord. It does not serve as a periosteum for the vertebra;, which possess a distinct periosteal covering, between which and the dura mater loose fat and a plexus of veins are situated. It gives off no bands from its inner surface, and it does not split into two layers for the lodgment of venous blood sinuses.- The spinal dura mater forms a tubular enve- lope for the spinal cord and the origins of the spinal nerves. It extends from the foramen magnum, where it is con- tinuous with the cranial dura mater, to the lower end of the sacral canal, ends below in a funnel-shaped prolongation, andMEMBRANES OF BRAIN AND SPINAL CORD. 219 is pierced laterally by tlie roots of tlie several spinal nerves in tbeir passage outwards to the intervertebral foramina. Both the cranial and the spinal parts of the dura mater consist of a tough, fibrous membrane containing numerous elastic fibres; somewhat flocculent externally, but smooth, glistening, and free on its inner surface. The inner sur- face has the appearance of a serous membrane, and when examined microscopically is seen to be covered by a layer of squamous endothelial cells, similar to those drawn in fig. 34. Hence the dura mater is sometimes called a fibro- serous membrane. The dura mater is well provided with lymph vessels, which in all probability open by stomata on the free inner surface. Nerves have been traced to the cranial dura mater both from the fifth cranial nerve and the sympathetic. Between the dura mater and the arach- noid membrane is a fine space containing a minute quan- tity of limpid serum, which moistens the smooth inner surface of the dura and the corresponding smooth outer surface of the arachnoid. It is regarded as equivalent to the cavity of a serous membrane, and is named the arachnoid cavity, or, more appropriately, the sub-dural space. Arachnoid mater.—The arachnoid is a membrane of great delicacy and transparency,' which envelopes both the brain and spinal cord. It is separated from these organs by the pia mater; but between it and the latter membrane is a distinct space, called sub-arachnoid. The sub-arachnoid space is more distinctly marked beneath the spinal than beneath the cerebral parts of the arachnoid, which membrane forms a looser investment for the cord than for the brain. At the base of the brain, and oppo-220 anatomy. site the fissures between the convolutions of the cerebrum, the interval between the arachnoid and the pia matter can, however, always be seen, for the arachnoid does not, like the pia mater, clothe the sides of the fissures, but passes directly across between the summits of adjacent convolu- tions. The sub-arachnoid space is divided into numerous freely-communicating loculi by fasciculi of delicate areolar tissue, which bundles are invested, as Key and Retzins have shown, by a layer of fiat endothelial-like cells. Beneath the layers of flat cells fibres, resembling those of elastic tissue, are rolled in an angular or spiral manner around the fasciculi. The space contains a limpid cerebro-spinal fluid, which varies in quantity from 2 drachms to 2 ounces. The fluid is alkaline, of sp. gr. 1-005, contains a little albumen, and a substance which, as I pointed out some years ago, reduces blue oxide of copper to the state of yellow sub-oxide. The arachnoid membrane is made up of delicate connective tissue. The free surface next the sub-dural space is smooth, like a serous membrane, and covered by a layer of squamous endothelium. This laj er is reflected on to the roots of the spinal and cranial nerves, and, when they pierce the dura mater, it becomes con- tinuous with the endothelial lining of that membrane. As the arrangement and structure so closely correspond with what is seen in the serous membranes, many anato- mists regard the arachnoid as the visceral layer of a seious membrane, and the endothelial lining of the dura mater as the parietal layer, whilst the sub-dural space is the inter- mediate cavity. When the skull cap is removed, clusters of granular bodies are usually to be seen imbedded in the dura materMEMBRANES OF BRAIN AND SPINAL CORD. 221 on each side of the superior longitudinal sinus; these are named the Pacchionian bodies. When traced through the dura mater they are found to spring from the visceral or proper cerebral arachnoid. The observations of Luschka and Cleland have proved that villous processes invariably grow from the free surface of that membrane, and that when these villi greatly increase in size they form the bodies in question. Sometimes the Pacchionian bodies greatly hypertrophy, occasion absorption of the bones of the cranial vault, and depressions on the upper surface of the brain. Pia mater.—This tender membrane closely invests the whole outer surface of the brain. It dips into the fissures between the convolutions, and a wide prolongation, named velum interpositum, passes into the interior of the cerebrum. With a little care it can be stripped off the brain without causing injury to its substance. The pia mater invests the spinal cord, and is more intimately attached to it than to the brain, for not only does it send prolongations into the anterior and posterior fissures of the cord, but numerous slender bands pass from its inner surface into the columns of the cord. Hence it cannot be stripped off the cord without causing injury to its sub- stance. The pia matter is prolonged on to the roots both of the cranial and spinal nerves, and on to the filum terminale. This membrane consists of a delicate connective tissue, in which the arteries of the brain and spinal cord ramify and subdivide into small branches before they penetrate the nervous substance, and in which the veins conveying the blood from the nerve centres lie before they open into the blood sinuses of the cranial dura mater, and into the extra- dural venous plexus of the spinal canal. The arteriesANATOMY. 222 which, pass from the pia mater into the brain and spinal cord are invested by a loose funnel-shaped sheath, which has been described as forming the wall of a peri-vascular lymphatic vessel; but Key and Retzius consider that the space between the blood-vessel and the sheath opens into the sub-arachnoid space, and contains cerebro-spinal fluid. They believe that they have proved that the sub- arachnoid cerebro-spinal spaces are in free communication with the serous and lymphatic spaces of the organs of sense, and that through the entire peripheral nervous system, even to its furthest ramifications, a serous system exists, which along the nerve roots is in free communica- tion with the central sub-arachnoid spaces. They also describe the ventricles of the brain as in communication with the sub-arachnoid spaces. A network of lymph vessels ramifies freely in the pia mater. It is also well provided with nerves, which arise from the posterior roots of the spinal nerves, from some of the cranial nerves, and from the carotid and vertebral plexuses of the sympathetic. The epi-cerebral and epi-spinal spaces described by His as existing between the pia mater and the brain and spinal cord are in all probability artificial productions. In the spinal canal a slender fibrous band projects from the.pia mater covering the side of the cord, and, pushing the arachnoid membrane in front of it, is attached by about twenty-two pairs of denticulated processes to the inner surface of the dura mater. It is named ligamentim denticulatum, and its teeth alternate with the successive pairs of spinal nerves.223 SPINAL COED. Spinal Coed. The Medulla Spinalis, or Spinal Coed, occupies the spinal canal, and extends from the foramen magnum to opposite the body of the first lumbar vertebra. In the early foetus it equals in length the canal itself; but as the spinal column grows at a greater proportional rate than the cord, the latter, when growth has ceased, is several inches shorter than the column. The cord is continuous above with the medulla oblongata, whilst it tapers off below into a slender thread, the filum terminate, which lies in the axis of the sacral canal, and is attached below to the back of the coccyx, or to the fibrous mem- brane which closes in below the sacral canal. The length of the cord is from 15 to 18 inches. It approaches a cylinder in shape, but is flattened on its anterior and pos- terior surfaces, and presents two enlargements which have a greater girth than the rest of the cord. The upper, called the cervical or brachial enlargement, extends from opposite the third cervical to the first dorsal vertebra, and from it arise the nerves which supply the upper limbs; the lower, called the crural or lumbar enlargement, is opposite the last dorsal vertebra, and supplies with nerves the lower limbs. The cord is almost completely divided into right and left lateral halves by two fissures, named respectively anterior and 'posterior median fissures, which do not quite reach the centre of the cord, for at the bottom of the anterior fissure are the transverse fibres of the anterior white commissure, and at the bottom of the posterior fissure the fibres of the posterior grey commissure. By these com-224 ANATOMY. missures the two halves of the cord are united together. The fibres of the posterior commissure surround a canal, called the central canal, which extends along the whole length of the cord, and even passes into the upper end of the filum terminate. This canal is fined by a ciliated columnar epithelium, and expands superiorly into the cavity of the fourth ventricle. The attached ends of these columnar cells are elongated, and project into the neuroglia of the posterior commissure which surrounds the canal. Each lateral half of the cord is subdivided into three columns by two depressions, which mark the points of emergence of the roots of the spinal nerves. The an- terior nerve roots pass through the antero - lateral de- pression or fissure, and between it and the antero-median fissure is the an- Fig. 73.—Transverse section through the spinal cord.

In the cervical region, the part of the posterior column which lies next the postero-median fissun225 SPINAL CORD. is separated by a fissure into the small internal 'postero- median column, or band of Goll and the funiculus cuneatus. The subdivision of each lateral half of the cord into the columns, and the arrangement of its nervous tissues, are well seen in transverse sections through its sub- stance (Fig. 72). The cord is composed of white and grey matter. The white matter is external, and forms the columns of the cord. The grey matter is surrounded by the white, and has in each lateral half of the cord a crescentic shape. The horns of the crescent are directed towards the fissures of emergence of the nerve roots; the anterior horn is rounded; the posterior long and narrow. The proportion of grey matter to the white varies in dif- ferent parts of the cord. At the commencement of the filum terminate there is scarcely any white matter; but the white matter increases in amount from below up- wards, so that its absolute quantity is greatest in the cervi- cal part of the cord. The grey crescents are thicker in the upper and lower enlargements than in the intermediate part. The cord contains both nerve fibres and nerve cells. The external, columnar, white part of the cord consists of nerve fibres, with a supporting reticular framework of connective tissue and blood-vessels derived from the pia mater. Well- formed stellate connective tissue corpuscles lie in this sup- porting framework. The nerve fibres of the various columns extend longitudinally, and lie parallel to each other, so that in transverse sections through the columns the fibres are transversely divided. The individual fibres vary much in diameter, but in all the axial cylinder and medullary sheath can be distinctly seen. Wherever the nerve roots enter P226 ANATOMY. into the cord, the fibres of these roots pass horizontally or obliquely in their course inwards to the grey matter. The fibres of the anterior and posterior commissures have also a horizontal course. Those of the anterior commis- sure pass from the anterior cornu of grey matter on one side, across the bottom of the anterior median fissure, where they decussate with the corresponding fibres from the opposite side, and enter the anterior column of the opposite side, though some of the fibres bend back in the grey matter towards the posterior cornu. The fibres of the posterior commissure, more delicate than those of the anterior, not only lie at the bottom of the posterior median 7, Transverse section through the central canal, C, of the cord, and its snr- nerve colls; V, a pair of transversely divided blood-vessels, probab } \ fissure, but traverse the neuroglia surrounding the central canal, and enter the posterior cornua and posterior columns.227 SPINAL COED. Horizontal fibres can also be traced from the grey matter of the anterior cornu into the anterior and lateral columns, and fibres may also be traced from the posterior cornu into the posterior part of the lateral column. The grey crescentic portion of the cord contains con- nective tissue, blood-vessels, nerve fibres, and nerve cells. The nerve fibres in the grey matter are numerous; and whilst some possess a medullary sheath, others consist only of the axial cylinder ■ they divide and subdivide, and, as Gerlach has shown, form a narrow - meshed network of extremely minute fibres. The nerve cells are multipolar, and are chiefly collected in the anterior and posterior horns of each crescent. The cells of the an- terior cornu are large, distinct, and stellate, and form well-defined groups of nerve cells (Fig. 68). Those of the posterior cornu are, as a rule, much smaller in size, more elongated in shape, but with stellate branched processes. They are not so distinct as in the anterior horn, owing to the connective tissue with its corpuscles being so abundant; this tissue is best marked at the tip of the posterior horn, where it forms the substantia gelatinosa of Rolando. Groups of larger stellate branched cells may, however, be seen in well-prepared sections at a short distance from the tip of the posterior cornu. Sometimes also isolated nerve cells may be seen in the white columns immediately out- side the grey matter of this cornu. Lockhart Clarke has described an intermedio-lateral group of nerve cells situ- ated at the outer side of the grey matter, about midway between the anterior and posterior horns, in the upper part of the cervical portion of the cord, and in the thoracic part between the brachial and crural enlargements.ANATOMY. The course of the fibres in the cord and their relations to the nerve cells should now be considered. There can be no doubt that of the longitudinal fibres some ascend from below upwards, and conduct either excito-motory impulses to the regions of the spinal cord itself, or sen- sory impulses to the brain. Other longitudinal fibres again descend from the brain and higher regions of the cord to the lower, and conduct motor and vaso-motor impulses from above downwards. The horizontal and oblique fibres of an anterior or motor nerve root enter the grey matter of the anterior cornu, and seem to have the following arrangement: some become directly continuous with the axial cylindrical processes of the nerve cells; others pass into the anterior commissure; others extend as far as the grey matter of the posterior horn. The nerve cells of the anterior cornu give origin, therefore, directly to nerve fibres by their un- branched processes. Gerlach’s observations show that the branched processes of these cells become continuous with the network of extremely minute fibres already described in the grey matter; from this network medullated fibres appear to arise which leave the grey matter; some enter the lateral column, and ascend as the fibres of this structure; others pass as fibres of the anterior commissure to the opposite side of the cord, and ascend as the anterior column of that side. The anterior and lateral columns, therefore, are constantly receiving accessions of fibres from the enclosed grey matter. The fibres of a posterior or sensory nerve root on entering the cord subdivide into two bundles; one does not enter the grey matter, but applies itself to the posterior column, ofSPINAL COED. 229 which it forms some of the vertical fibres. These fibies may ascend to the brain, or they may at some liighei point in the cord enter the grey matter of the posterior horn. The other bundle of posterior root fibres at once enters the posterior horn of grey matter. The connections and ulti- mate arrangement of these fibres in the grey matter have not been satisfactorily made out. Gerlach states that, as they frequently subdivide on entering the grey matter, it is possible they may form the fine nerve fibre plexus of the grey substance; but a direct continuity between them and the axial cylinder processes of the ceds of the posterior horn does not seem to have been observed. From the plexus, formed by the much subdivided processes of these cells, fibres arise, which, forming the fibres of the pos- terior commissure, pass both in front of and behind the central canal to the opposite side, where they ascend towards the brain, “ partly in the vertical fasciculi of the posterior cornua and partly in the posterior columns.” The structure of the spinal cord shows it to be both a nerve centre and a conductor of nervous impulses. The nerve cells in its grey matter give rise either directly, or through the delicate plexus formed by their branching processes, to nerve fibres, which may either pass out of the cord as the anterior and posterior roots of the spinal nerves, or may ascend to the brain as the columns of the cord. Hence the cord is anatomically continuous, on the one hand, through the nerves which arise from it, with the peripheral end-organs in the skin, and muscular system in which those nerves terminate; and, on the other hand, it is continuous with the brain. It serves, therefore, to conduct the impulses of touch-sensation from the skin upwards230 ANATOMY. to the brain, and the motor impulses from the brain downwards to the muscles. But further, the cord is the great nerve centre concerned in reflex excito-motory actions. It must, also, be remembered that the two halves of the cord are anatomically continuous with each other through the nerve fibres of the commissures, so that it acts as a single organ, and not as two organs. Experiments have shown that sensory impulses are conducted upwards through the cord, not by that half from which the nerves arise that have been excited, but by the opposite half of the cord, which is obviously due to the crossing of the fibres of the posterior commissure. Motor impressions are, however, conducted downwards by that half of the cord from which the nerves arise that pass to supply the muscles to be moved. The spinal cord is well supplied with blood by numerous arteries, which ramify not only in the pia mater investing its periphery, but in the processes which dip into the median fissures, more especially the anterior. Small arteries enter the longitudinal columns perpendicular to their free surfaces, ramify in the connective tissue frame- work, and end in a capillary plexus for the supply of the 'nerve fibres. Other vessels, somewhat larger in size, pass through the columns into the grey matter, where they also are connected with a capillary plexus. The capillaries are much more numerous in the grey matter of the cord than in the white columns. In transverse sections through the cord a pair of small vessels may often be seen imbedded in the neuroglia of the posterior commissure; these vessels lie parallel to and at the sides of the central canal (Fig. 11).SPINAL NERVES. 231 Origin, Arrangement, and Distribution of the Spinae Nerves. The spinal cord gives origin to thirty-one pairs of Spinal nerves, which pass out of the spinal canal through the intervertebral foramina. These nerves are arranged in groups, according to the region of the spine through the foramina in which they proceed. There are eight pairs of cervical nerves; the first or sub-occipital emerges between the occipital bone and the atlas; the eighth between the seventh cervical and first dorsal vertebras. Twelve dorsal or thoracic nerves pass out on each side in relation to the dorsal vertebras: five pairs of lumbar nerves in the region of the loins; five pairs of sacral nerves through the sacral and sacro-coccygeal foramina; and one pair of coccygeal nerves through the lowest openings in the spinal canal. Each spinal nerve-trunk arises by two roots, an anterior and a posterior, from the side of the cord. These roots are distinguished from each other both anatomically and physiologically. The posterior root has a swelling or ganglion on it, whilst no ganglion exists on the anterior root. The posterior root consists of sensory nerve fibres, i.e., of fibres which conduct impulses from the periphery into the nerve centre; whilst the anterior root is composed of motor nerve fibres, i.e., of fibres which conduct im- pulses from the centre to the periphery. The ganglion on the posterior root is situated, as a rule, in the interverte- bral foramen; but the lower sacral nerves have the ganglia on their posterior roots in the spinal canal. These ganglia contain bipolar nerve cells, and the nerve fibres, as they pass through each ganglion, are apparently continuous withANATOMY. 232 the poles of the cells. The roots of the spinal nerves vary in direction and length. Those of the cervical nerves are short, and run almost horizontally outwards to their respective intervertebral foramina; those of the dorsal are longer and more oblique; whilst the roots of the lumbar and sacral nerves, owing to the cord ending much above the foramina through which the nerves proceed, are very long, and form a leash of nerves in the lower part of the spinal canal, which leash surrounds the filum term in ale, and, from its general resemblance in arrangement to the hairs of a horse’s tail, has been named cauda equina. The anterior nerve root joins the posterior immediately outside the ganglion, and by their junction a spinal nerve- trunk is formed. This nerve contains a mixture of both motor and sensory fibres, and is compound therefore in function. Almost immediately after its formation the nerve-trunk separates into two divisions, an anterior and a posterior, and each division, like the nerve itself, con- tains both motor and sensory fibres. The Posterior Primary Divisions of the spinal nerve- trunks, smaller than the anterior, are distributed both to the muscles and skin on the back of the axial part of the body. Their general arrangement is as follows: each division, except the first cervical, two lower sacral, and coccygeal, subdivides into an internal and an external branch. The first cervical or sub-occipital nerve extends backwards, lying on the neural arch of the atlas, and sup- plies the posterior recti, the obliqui, and complexus muscles. The two lower sacral and coccygeal unite in a loop-like manner behind the sacrum, and supply the skin. In the back of the neck and the back of the upper part of the chest,SPINAL NEKVES. 233 the external branches of the posterior primary divisions supply the deep muscles of the back; the internal branches pierce the muscles close to the spines of the vertebrae, and end in the skin; the internal branch of the second nerve, called great occipital, and that of the third cervical, pass to the skin over the occipital bone. In the back of the lower part of the chest and of the loins, the internal branches supply the deep muscles of the back, the external branches pass to the skin, those of the upper lumbar nerves extend- ing as far as the skin of the buttock. The Anterior Primary Divisions are not so uniform either in arrangement or distribution as are the pos- terior. They supply the front and sides of the axial part of the neck and trunk, and the extremities. The anterior divisions of the twelve thoracic nerves have the most simple arrange- ment. Each nerve, called from its position an inter- costal nerve, runs out- wards, immediately below the lower border of a rib, and gives origin to three series of branches, named communicating, muscular, and cutaneous. By the Communicating branch each in- tercostal nerve is connected with an adjacent ganglion on the thoracic portion of the sympathetic system. By the Muscular or motor branches these nerves supply Fig. 75.—Diagram of the arrangement of a pair of thoracic spinal nerves. SC, spinal cord; AR, anterior nerve root; PR, pos- terior root, with its ganglion; PD, pos- terior primary division; AD, anterior primary division, or intercostal nerve; SG, sympathetic ganglion, with the com- municating branches between it and the anterior division; M, muscles, with the motor branches entering them; LC, lateral cutaneous, and AC, anterior cutaneous branches.ANATOMY. 234 the intercostal muscles, the levatores costaram, and the triangulares sterni, whilst the lower intercostal nerves run forwards and downwards into the wall of the abdo- men, and supply the oblique, the transverse, the recti, and pyramidales muscles. The skin of the sides of the thorax and abdomen receives its nervous supply from the Lateral Cutaneous branches, whilst the skin on the front of the trunk is supplied by the Anterior Cutaneous terminations of these nerves. The lateral cutaneous branches of the second and third intercostal nerves are comparatively large in size, and assist in the supply of the skin of the inner side of the upper arm; hence they are called intercosto-humeral nerves. The first thoracic, usually called the first dorsal nerve, for the most part ascends into the neck, to aid in forming the brachial plexus; only a small branch, ex- tending along the intercostal space as the first intercostal nerve (Fig. 76, 1). The twelfth thoracic, usually called the twelfth dorsal nerve, runs along the lower border of the twelfth rib. In the regions of the neck, loins, and pelvis, the anterior divisions of the spinal nerves do not pass simply outwards to their distribution. In each region adjacent nerves in- terlace with each other, and form what is technically called a nervous plexus. When a branch arises from a thoracic nerve, it contains fibres derived from that nerve only} but when a branch arises from a plexus, it may contain fibres, not of one only, but of two or more of the nerves which, by their interlacement, form the plexus. Hence the parts which are supplied by these branches are brought into con- nection with a greater number of nerves, and consequently with a greater extent of the spinal cord oi uei\c centre,SPINAL NERVES. 235 than are the parts which receive branches from a single nerve only. These plexuses are especially found in con- nection with the nerves which supply the extremities, where, owing to the complexity of the muscular move- ments, the co-ordination of these movements through the nervous system is rendered necessary. The anterior divisions of the eight cervical nerves are arranged in two plexuses, named cervical and brachial. The Cervical plexus is formed of the four upper cervical nerves, which make, by interlacement with each other, a series of loops in front of the transverse processes of the cervical vertebrae (Fig. 76). Arising either directly from these nerves, or from the plexus which they form, are com- municating, muscular, and cutaneous branches. The Com- municating branches connect these nerves with the large superior cervical ganglion of the sympathetic system, also with the vagus, accessory, and hypoglossal cranial nerves, and with the descending branch of the hypoglossal, these last being especially called communicahtes noni. The Mus- cular branches supply the anterior recti muscles of the neck, the levator scapulae, the posterior scalenus, the diaphragm, and in part the sterno-mastoid and trapezius. The branch to the diaphragm, or the phrenic nerve, is the most impor- tant ;- it springs from the third, fourth, and fifth cervical, and passes down the lower part of the neck, and through the thorax, to supply its own half of the diaphragm; Luschka has described twigs proceeding from the phrenic to the pleura, pericardium and peritoneum. The Cutaneous branches are as follows:—the occipitalis minor, a branch of the 2d cervical goes to the skin of the occiput; the auriculo-parotidean, a branch of the 2d and 3d cervical,ANATOMY. 236 to tlie skin over the parotid gland and the adjacent part of the auricle; the transversalis colli, also from the 2d and 3d cervical, to the skin of the front of. the side of the neck; the supra-clavicular nerves, from the 3d and 4th cervical, to the skin of the lower part of the side of the neck, and upper part of the chest. The Brachial plexus is formed of the four lower cervical nerves, and of the larger portion of the first thoracic, called also first dorsal nerve (Fig. 76). It is of large size, and is principally for the supply of the upper limb. Its exact mode of arrangement presents many variations, but the following is not unfrequently found:—The fifth and sixth nerves join to form a large nerve, which, after a short course, is joined by the seventh; in this manner the upper cord of the plexus is formed. The eighth cervical and the first dorsal then join, to form the loiver cord of the plexus. The cords then pass behind the clavicle and subclavius muscle into the axilla, where they become modified in arrangement. From each a large branch arises, and these two branches then join to form a third cord. The three cords have special relations to the axillary artery : the one which lies to its outer side is named the outer cord ; that to the inner, the inner cord; that behind, the posterior cord. These nerves and the cords formed by them give origin to communicating, muscular, cutaneous, and mixed branches. The Communicating branches join the middle and in- ferior cervical and first thoracic ganglia of the sympathetic system. The Muscular branches supply the scaleni, longus colli, rhomboid, and subclavius muscles; also the supra and infra-spinatus muscles, through a branch called supra- scapular, which arises from the cord formed by the 5thSPINAL NERVES. 237 Fig. 76-—Diagram of Cervical and Brachial Plexuses.

The Cutaneous branches arise from the inner cord, and are the lesser internal cutaneous, which ends in the skin of the inner side of the upper arm, and joins the intercosto- humeral; and the internal cutaneous, which not only sends branches to the skin of the upper arm, but supplies the skin of the inner side of the forearm, both on its anterior and posterior surfaces. The Mixed branches are large and very important:—a, The Circumflex, from the posterior cord, supplies muscular branches to the deltoid and teres minor muscles, a cutaneous branch to the skin over the del- toid, and an articular branch to the shoulder joint, b, The Musculo-Spiral, which, as it were, continues downwards the posterior cord, supplies muscular branches to the triceps and anconeus, to the supinator longus and extensor carpi radialis longior muscles; by its internal cutaneous branch the skin of the back of the upper arm, and by its external cutaneous branch, the skin of the outer side of the back of the forearm. It then divides into the radial and posterior interosseous branches. The radial passes down the forearm to the hand, and supplies the skin on the back of the thumb, index and middle digits, and radial side of the ring digit. The posterior interosseous pierces the supin- ator radii brevis, supplies the muscles on the back of the forearm and the articulations of the carpal joints, c, TheSPINAL NERVES. 239 Musculo-Cutaneous branch of the outer cord of the plexus supplies the biceps, brachialis anticus, and coraco-brachialis muscles, and ends in an external cutaneous branch, which supplies the skin of the outer side of the forearm, both in front and behind, d, The Ulnar nerve arises from the inner cord, passes through the upper arm, and enters the forearm between the inner condyle and olecranon, where it supplies an articular branch to the elbow joint. Here it may easily be compressed, when a pricking sensation is experienced in the course of its distribution. In this spot it is popularly called the “ funny bone.” In the forearm the ulnar nerve supplies the flexor carpi ulnaris and inner part of the flexor profundus digitorum muscles. In the hand it supplies the palmaris brevis, the muscles of the ball of the little finger, the two inner lumbricales, the inter- ossei muscles, and the adductor and deep part of the short flexor of the thumb. It also supplies a dorsal cutaneous branch to the back of _the hand, and the back of the little and of the ulnar side of the ring digits. Palmar cutaneous branches are also given to the palm and to the palmar aspects of the same digits, e, The Median nerve arises by two roots, ■ one fr°m the inner, the other from the outer cord of the plexus. It enters the forearm in front of the elbow joint, between the two heads of the pronator radii teres, sup- plies, either directly or through its anterior interosseous branch, all the flexors and pronators, except those supplied by the ulnar; is continued to the hand, where it supplies the abductor, opponens, and superficial part of the short flexor of the thumb, and the two outer iumbrical muscles. It also supplies a palmar cutaneous branch to the skin of the palm, and gives digital cutaneous branches to the thumb,ANATOMY. 240 index and middle digits, and radial side of the ring digit. The Lumbar plexus, of large size, is situated at the back of the abdominal cavity in the region of the loins, and is formed by the four upper lumbar nerves, which form a series of loop-like interlacements in front of the transverse processes of the lumbar vertebrae (Fig. 77). It gives origin to communicating, muscular, cutaneous, and mixed branches. The Communicating branches join the four upper lumbar ganglia of the sympathetic system. The Muscular branches supply the quadratus lumborum muscle, and give branches to the psoas. The Cutaneous branches are named—a, Ilio-hypogastric, which arises from the 1st lumbar nerve, gives an iliac branch to the skin of the but- tock, and a hypogastric branch to the skin of the abdomen above the pubic symphysis; b, Ilio-inguinal, also from the 1st lumbar nerve, supplies the skin of the groin; this nerve is by some said to send a branch to the in- ternal oblique muscle; c, External Cutaneous, from the 2d and 3d lumbar nerves, supplies the skin on the outer aspect of the thigh. The Mixed branches are as fol- lows :—a, Genito-crural, chiefly from the 2d lumbar, sup- plies the cremaster muscle, and a cutaneous branch to the skin of the groin, b, Anterior Crural, chiefly from the 3d and 4th lumbar nerves, but partly from the 2d, is a large nerve which enters the thigh by passing behind Poupart’s ligament, and supplies muscular branches to the great ex- tensor muscles of the knee-joint, viz., the rectus femoiis, crurseus, vastus internus, and externus, and also the sar- torius,the psoas-iliacus and the pectiueus, which act as flexors of the hip-joint; it also gives off the following cutaneous241 SPINAL NERVES. branches :—An internal cutaneous to the skin of the inner side of the thigh, a middle cutaneous to the skin of the middle of the front of the thigh, and the long saphenous nerve, which supplies the skin of the inner side of the knee- joint, the inner side of the leg and the foot, c, Obturator, also from the 3d and 4th lumbar nerves, leaves the pelvis through the obturator foramen, and supplies muscular branches to the obturator externus, gracilis, three adductor muscles of the thigh, and the pectineus; it also supplies articular branches to the hip and knee joints, and not unfrequently gives a cutaneous branch to the skin of the lower part of the inner side of the thigh, d, An Accessory Obturator nerve, also from the 3d and 4th lumbar, is sometimes present, which goes to the pectineus, to the hip-joint, and also joins the obturator nerve. The Lumho-sacral Cord is formed of the fifth lumbar nerve and of a branch from the fourth lumbar (Fig. 77). It joins the sacral plexus. Before the junction it gives origin to a communicating and a muscular branch. The Communi- cating joins the fifth lumbar ganglion of the sympathetic. The Muscular branch, or superior glutceal nerve, supplies the glutseus medius, minimus, and tensor fascise femoris muscles. The Sacral plexus lies in the cavity of the pelvis, and is the largest of all the plexuses. It is formed by the junction of the lumbo-sacral cord, the first, second, third, and part of the fourth sacral nerves, and appears as a flattened mass in front of the sacrum (Fig. 77). It gives origin to com- municating, muscular, and mixed branches. The Com- municating branches join the upper sacral ganglia of the sympathetic system. The Muscular branches supply the Q242 ANATOMY. upper fibres of the glutseus maximus, tlie pyriformis, gemelli, quaclratus femoris, and obturator internus Fig. 77.—Lumbar, Sacral,,a"d.S|^ o?the hmiharplexus; V, nerve of the intercostal senes, ' , j . cr jy sacral nerves going the W lumbar, with 8, the lumtio-sacial cwA, H to nr, sacrm . ^ to form the sacral plexus, ^ an pnimminicating branches with ganglia of the 8ympathctic sy8tem, sho d B caUed coccygeal ganglion, or the spinal nerves c, the last.or ri 8 8 i mo-hypogastric nerve; 2, ilio “«**—**61 obturator; 7, superior glutieal. muscles. The Mixed nerves are as follows which supplies superficial perineal branches to the skin ot243 SPINAL NERVES. the external organs of generation; muscular branches to their muscles; a long dorsal branch to the dorsum penis, which ends in the sensitive surface of the glans, and in- ferior hcemorrhoidal branches to the skin about the anus. b, Small Sciatic, which supplies not only muscular branches to the lower fibres of the glutseus maximus muscle, but cutaneous branches to the skin of the buttock, the back of the thigh, of the popliteal space, and of the leg; it also gives a long pudendal branch to the skin of the perineum. c, Great Sciatic, the largest nerve in the body, leaves the pelvis through the great sciatic foramen, and passes down the back of the thigh, when it divides into external and internal popliteal branches. Before dividing it supplies articular branches to the hip-joint and muscular branches to the three hamstring muscles, and to the adductor magnus. The external popliteal branch gives articular branches to the knee-joint, passes down the outer side of the leg, gives off the communicans peronei branch to the skin of the outer side of the back of the leg, and divides into the musculo- cutaneous and anterior tibial nerves. The musculo-cutaneous nerve supplies muscular branches to the peronei longus and brevis, and cutaneous branches to the dorsum of the foot and the dorsal surfaces of all the toes, except the outer side of the little and the adjacent sides of the great and second toes. The anterior tibial passes to the front of the leg, supplies muscular branches to the tibialis anticus, peroneus tertius, long and short extensor muscles of the toes, and ter- minates as the cutaneous digital nerve for the adjacent sides of the great and second toes. The internal popliteal branch gives articular branches to the knee-joint, and supplies the communicans tibiahs nerve, which joins the communicansANATOMY. 244 peronei, and forms with it the external saphenous nerve that passes to the outer side of the foot and little toe. The internal popliteal also supplies the muscles of the calf and the popliteus muscle, and ends as the posterior tibial nerve. The posterior tibial nerve passes down the back of the leg, supplies muscular branches to the tibialis posticus and long flexors of the toes, gives off a cutaneous branch to the skin of the heel, and terminates by dividing into the internal and external plantar nerves. The internal plantar nerve supplies the skin of the sole and sends digital branches to the skin of the great, second, third, and tibial side of the fourth toes; it also supplies muscular branches to the abductor pollicis, flexor brevis digitorum, flexor brevis pollicis, and two inner lumbrical muscles. The external plantar nerve supplies digital branches to the skin of the little toe and fibular side of the fourth toe, and muscular branches to all the muscles of the sole of the foot which are not supplied by the internal plantar nerve. The Sacro-Goccygeal plexus is the smallest belonging to the anterior divisions of the spinal nerves. It is formed by a part of the fourth sacral, the fifth sacral, and the coccygeal nerves. It lies in front of the last sacral and the first coccy- geal vertebrae, and gives origin to communicating, visceral, muscular, and cutaneous branches. The Communicating branches join the lower sacral and the coccygeal ganglia of the sympathetic system; the Visceral pass to the pelvic plexus of the sympathetic, and through it to the bladder and rectum; the Muscular to the levator ani, coccygeus, and sphincter ani externus muscles; the Cutaneous to the skin about the anus and tip of the coccyx.THE BRAIN—MEDULLA OBLONGATA. 245 The Brain or Encephalon. By the term Brain or Encephalon is meant all that part of the central nervous axis which is contained within the cavity of the skull. It is divided into several parts, named medulla oblongata, pons, cerebellum, and cerebrum. The medulla oblongata is directly continuous with the spinal cord through the foramen magnum. The cerebel- lum lies above, and immediately behind the medulla ob- longata, with which it is directly continuous. The pons lies above and in front of the medulla, with which it is directly continuous. The cerebrum is the highest division, and lies above both pons and cerebellum, with both of which it is directly continuous. MEDULLA OBLONGATA. The Medulla Oblongata rests upon the basi-occipital. It is somewhat pyramidal in form, about 1J inch long, and 1 ineh broad in its widest: part. It is a bilateral organ, and is divided into a right and a left half by shallow anterior and posterior median fissures, continuous with the corre- sponding fissures in the 6pinal cord; the posterior fissure ends above in the 4th ventricle. Each half is subdivided into elongated tracts of nervous matter. Next to, and parallel with the anterior fissure is the anterior pyramid. This pyramid is continuous below with the cord, and the place of continuity is marked by the passage across the fissure of three or four bundles of nerve fibres, from each half of the cord to the opposite anterior pyramid; this cross- ing is called the decussation of the pyramids (Figs. 78, 70b246 ANATOMY. To the side of the pyramid, and separated from it by a faint fissure, is the projecting oval-shaped olivary body, with the olivary fasciculus. Behind the olive, and separated from it by a faint groove, is the strong tract named restiform body; as it ascends from the funiculus cuneatus of the cord it diverges from its fellow in the opposite half of the medulla oblongata. By this divergence the central part of the medulla is opened up, and the lower half of the cavity of the 4th ventricle is formed. Internal to the restiform body is the posterior pyramid or funiculus gracilis, which is con- tinuous with the postero-median column, and bounds the postero-median fissure. Where the restiform bodies diverge from each other, there also the posterior pyramids diverge outwards from the sides of the postero-median fissure. At the upper part of the floor of the 4th ventricle a longitudinal tract of nerve fibres, the fasciculus teres, ascends on each side of its median furrow (Fig. 83). Slender tracts of nerve fibres, the ardform fibres, arch across the side of the medulla immediately below the olive, from the anterior column of the cord to the restiform body; and white slender tracts emerge from the median furrow of the 4th ventricle, pass outwards across its floor, and form the stria? medullares or acousticce, the roots of origin of the auditory nerve(Fig. 83). The medulla oblongata, like the spinal cord, with which it is continuous, consists both of grey and white matter. But the exterior of the medulla is not so exclusively formed of white matter as is the outer part of the cord, for the divergence from each other of the restiform bodies and posterior pyramids of opposite sides opens out the central part of the medulla, and allows the grey matter to become superficial on the floor of the 4th ventricle. The nerveTHE BRAIN—MEDULLA OBLONGATA. 247 fibres, which, enter into the formation of the pyramids and the other tracts just described, are partly continuous below with the columns of the spinal cord, and are prolonged upwards either to the pons and cerebrum, or to the cere- bellum, or they partly take their rise in the medulla oblongata itself from the cells of its grey matter. As the medulla is a bilateral organ, its two halves are united together by commissural fibres, which cross obliquely its mesial plane from one side to the other, and as they decus- sate in that plane, they form a well-marked mesial septum or raphe. Further, the medulla is a centre of origin for several pairs of the more posterior encephalic nerves, and for the vaso-motor nerves. In the passage upwards through the medulla of the columns of the cord, a re-arrangement of their fibres takes place , just as in a great central railway station, the lines of rails, which enter it in one direction, intersect and are rearranged before they emerge from it in the opposite direction. The fibres of the posterior median column of the cord are prolonged upwards as the posterior pyramid. The fibres of the funiculus cuneatus of the pos- terior column of the cord are for the most part prolonged upwards into the restiform body, though some fibres pass to the front of the medulla to participate in the decussation of the anterior pyramids. The lateral column of the cord divides into three parts : a, the greater number of its fibres pass inwards across the anterior median fissure, to assist in forming the anterior pyramid of the opposite side, so as to produce the decussation already referred to; b, others, which form the deep cerebellar fibres of Solly, join the restiform body; c, others form the fasciculus teres situated on the floor of the 4th ventricle.

The anterior pyramid consists partly of fibres of the anterior column of the cord of the same side, partly of decus- sating fibres of the ante- rior commissure, partly of decussating fibres from the posterior co- lumns and posterior cor- Fig. 78.—Diagrammatic dissection of the Me- dulla Oblongata and Pons to show the course of the fibres, a, superficial, adeep transverse fibres of the pons; b, b, anterior pyramids ascending at b' through the pons; c, c, olivary bodies; o', olivary fasciculus in the pons; d, d, anterior columns of cord; e, inner part of the right column joining the anterior pyramid; /, the outer part going to the olivary fasciculus; <7, lateral column of cord; h, the part which decussates at k, the decussa- tion of the pyramids; l, the part which joins the restiform body ; in, that which forms the fasciculus teres; n, arciform fibres. 1 and 2, sensory and motor roots of fifth nerve; 3, sixth nerve; 4, portio dura; 5, portio intermedin; 6, portio mollis of seventh nerve; 7, glosso-pharyngeal; 8, pneumo-gastric; 9, spinal accessory of eighth nerve; 10, hypo- glossal nerve. nu of grey matter, but principally of the decus- sating fibres of the lateral column of the opposite side of the cord. The fibres of the anterior pyramid are prolonged through the pons to the cerebrum. Owing to the decussation of the lateral columns of the cord in the formation of the pyramids, the motor nerve fibres from one-half of the brain are trans- mitted to the opposite side of the cord, so that injuries affecting one side of the brain occasion paralysis of theTHE BRAIN—MEDULLA OBLONGATA. 249 motor nerves arising from the opposite half of the cord, and consequent paralysis of the muscles supplied by those nerves. . The olivary fasciculus is formed partly of fibres of the’ anterior column of the same side, and partly of fibres arising from the grey matter of the olive. It is continued upwards through the pons to the cerebrum. The restiform body is formed principally of fibres of the funiculus cuneatus of the posterior column of the same side, but partly of fibres of the lateral column, and also of the arciform fibres from the anterior column, and from the grey matter of the superior and inferior olives. As the restiform body is continued upwards to the cerebellum, and forms its inferior peduncles, the arciform fibres have been called by Solly the superficial cerebellar fibres of the anterior columns. Through the restiform body the cerebellum is connected with the pos- terior, lateral, and anterior columns of the cord as well as with the olivary nuclei in the grey matter of the medulla oblongata. The posterior pyramid consists of the posterior median column of the cord, and is prolonged through the pons to the cerebrum. The fasciculus teres is formed of a small part of the lateral column of the cord, and is also prolonged through the pons to the cerebrum. The grey matter of the medulla oblongata, which contains numerous multipolar nerve cells, is in part continuous with the grey matter of the spinal cord, and in part consists of in- dependent masses. As the grey matter of the cord enters the medulla it loses its crescentic arrangement. The posterior cornua are thrown outwards towards the surface, lose their pointed form, and dilate into rounded masses named the grey tubercles of Rolando (Fig. 79), whilst portions are pro- longed into both the posterior pyramid and the restiform250 ANATOMY.

The grey matter of the anterior cornua and of the inter- medio-lateral tracts loses its continuity, and becomes subdivided into numerous small masses, owing to being traversed by bundles of nerve fibres, which give rise to a network termed formatio reticularis, in the meshes of which the groups of nerve cells are contained. In the lower part of the medulla a central canal continuous with that of the cord exists, but when the restiform bodies and posterior pyramids on the opposite sides of the medulla diverge from each other, the central canal loses its posterior boundary, and dilates into the cavity of the 4th ventricle. The grey matter in the interior of the medulla appears, therefore, on the floor of the ventricle; that which corresponds to the anterior cornua being situated immediately on each side of the median furrow, whilst that which is continuous with the grey tubercles of Rolando and the posterior cornua is some distance external to it. This grey matter contains collections of nerve cells, which are the centres of origin of the more posterior encephalic nerves. Of the independent masses of grey matter of the medulla, that which forms the corpus dentatum within the olivary body is the most important, and constitutes the nucleus of the inferior olive (Fig. 80). It is folded on itself in a zig-zag or denticulated manner, and forms a sort of capsule open on the inner aspect, through which openings a bundle of nerve fibres from the interior of the capsule proceeds. These fibres aid in the formation of the olivary fasciculus, and as Deiters and Meynert have pointed out, in part arch across the mesial plane and join the restiform body on the opposite side, whilst some apparently join the posterior pyramid. TheANATOMY. 252 nerve cells of the olive are multipolar and flask-shaped, and in all probability give origin to the nerve fibres proceeding from the interior of the capsule. Separated from the inner part of the olive by a layer of reticular substance is a smaller grey mass, called by Stilling the nucleus of the accessory olive.. Crossing the anterior surface of the medulla oblongata, immediately below the pons, in the majority of mammals is a transverse arrangement of fibres forming the trapezium, which contains a grey nucleus, named by Van der Kolk the superior olive. In the human brain the trapezium is included within the lower transverse fibres of the pons, but when sections are made through it, as L. Clarke pointed out, the grey matter of the superior olive can be seen. Meynert states that its nerve cells give origin to some fibres, which run straight backwards to the restiform body of the same side, and to others which pass across the mesial plane to the opposite corpus restiforme. PONS. The Pons Yarolii or Bridge (Figs. 78, 94), is cuboidal in form: its anterior surface rests upon the dorsum sellse of the sphenoid bone, and is marked by a median longitudinal groove; its inferior surface receives the pyra- midal and olivary tracts of the medulla oblongata; at its superior surface are the two crura cerebri; each lateral surface is in relation to a hemisphere of the cerebellum, and a peduncle passes from the pons into the interior of each hemisphere; the posterior surface forms in part the upper portion of the floor of the 4th ventricle, and in part is in contact with the coi’pora quadrigemina. The pons consists of white and grey matter. The nerve253 THE BRAIN—PONS. fibres of the white matter pass through the substance of the pons, either in a transverse or a longitudinal direction. The transverse fibres go from one hemisphere of the cerebellum to that of the opposite side j some are situated on the anterior surface of the pons, and form its superficial transverse fibres, whilst others pass through its substance and form the deep transverse fibres. The transverse fibres of the pons constitute, therefore, the commissural or connecting arrangement by which the two hemispheres of the cerebellum become anatomically continuous with each other. The longitudinal fibres of the pons ascend or pass vertically upwards from the medulla oblongata, and consist of the fibres of the anterior pyramids, olivary fasciculi, fasciculi teretes, and posterior pyramids. They leave the pons by emerging from its upper surface as fibres of the two crura cerebri. The pons possesses a median raphe continuous with that of the medulla oblongata, and formed like it by a decussation of fibres in the mesial plane. The grey matter of the pons is scattered irregularly through its substance, and appears on its posterior surface, but not on the anterior surface, which is composed exclu- sively of the superficial transverse fibres. It is traversed both by the longitudinal and deep transverse fibres, which form a well-defined formatio reticularis. To a portion of grey matter, containing nerve cells charged with dark pigment, the name of locus cceruleus is applied. The locus lies on the floor of the 4th ventricle, close to the entrance to the aqueduct of Sylvius, and serves as the origin of the sensory root of the 5th, and perhaps of the posterior root of the 4th cranial nerve. The nerve cells of the pons are multi- polar and stellate. The pons acts as a conductor of254 ANATOMY. impressions through its nerve fibres, and as a centre of origin of nerve fibres from nerve cells. Meynert states that some of the fibres of the crura cerebri end in the nerve cells of the pons, which cells again give origin to fibres that pass outwards to the cerebellum. CEREBELLUM. The Cerebellum, Little Brain, or Aeter Brain (Figs. 81, 91), occupies the inferior pair of occipital fossae, and, along with, the pons and medulla oblongata, lies below the plane of the tentorium cerebelli. It consists of two hemi- spheres or lateral lobes, and of a median or central lobe, which in human anatomy is called the vermiform process. It is connected belowwith the medulla oblongata by the two resti- form bodies which form its inferior peduncles, and above to the corpora quadrigemina of the cerebrum by two bands, which form its superior peduncles; whilst the two hemi- spheres are connected together by the transverse fibres of the pons, which form the middle peduncles of the cerebellum. On the superior or tentorial surface of the cerebellum the median or vermiform lobe is a mere elevation (Fig. 91 v), but on its inferior or occipital surface this lobe forms a well-defined inferior vermiform process, which lies at the bottom of a deep fossa or vallecula (Fig. 81); this fossa is prolonged to the posterior border of the cerebellum, and forms there a deep notch which separates the two hemi- spheres from each other j in this notch the falx cerebelli is lodged. Extending horizontally backwards from the middle cerebral peduncle, along the outer border of each hemisphere is the great horizontal fissure, which divides255 THE BRAIN—CEREBELLUM. the cerebellum into its tentorial and occipital surfaces. The tentorial surface is subdivided by fissures into two smaller lobes, named superior anterior and superior pos- terior. The occipital surface is also subdivided. In each hemisphere may be seen from behind forwards the posterior Fig. 81.—Occipital surface of Cerebellum, a, vallecula; b, pyramid; c, uvula! d, nodule; e, e, margin of tentorial surface; ff great horizontal fissure; g, g, posterior inferior lobes; h, h, slender lobes; k, k. biventral lobes; l, tonsil; m, flocculus; n, posterior medullary velum; o, cut surface from which the left tonsil has been detached. inferior lobe, the slender lobe, the biventral lobe, and the flocculus, which last named is situated immediately behind the middle peduncle of the cerebellum. Immediately internal to the biventral lobe is the amygdala or tonsil, which forms the lateral boundary of the anterior part of the valle- cula. The inferior vermiform process is subdivided into a posterior part or pyramid ; an elevation or uvula, situated between the two tonsils; and an anterior pointed process or nodule. Stretching between the two flocculi, and attached midway to the sides of the nodule, is a thin, white, semilunar-shaped plate of nervous matter, called theANATOMY. 256 'posterior medullary velum, whilst the layer of grey matter stretching between the uvula and tonsil on each side is called the furrowed band. The whole outer surface of the cerebellum possesses a characteristic foliated or laminated appearance, due to its subdivision into multitudes of thin plates or lamellae by numerous fissures. The cerebellum consists both of grey and white matter. The grey matter forms the exterior or cortex of the lamellae, and passes from one to the other across the bottom of the several fissures. The white matter lies in the interior of the organ, and extends into the core of each lamella. When a vertical section is made through the organ, the prolongations of white matter branching off into the interior of the several lamellae give to the section an arborescent appearance, known by the fanciful name of arbor vitce (Fig. 83). Independent masses of grey matter are, however, found in the interior of the cerebellum. If the hemisphere be cut through a little to the outer side of the median lobe, a zig-zag arrange- ment of grey matter, similar in appearance and structure to the nucleus of the olivary body in the medulla oblongata, and known as the corpus dentatum of the cerebellum, is seen; it lies in the midst of the white core of the hemi- sphere, and encloses white fibres, which leave the interior of the corpus at its inner and lower side. Stilling has de- scribed, in connection with the anterior end of the in- ferior vermiform process, which projects forwards into the valve of Vieussens, and aids in the formation of the roof of the 4th ventricle, two grey masses, named roof nuclei. They possess flask-shaped nerve cells like those of the corpus dentatum.THE BRAIN—CEREBELLUM. 257 The white matter is more abundant in the hemispheres than in the median lobe, and is for the most part directly continuous with the fibres of the peduncles of the cere- bellum. Thus the restiform or inferior peduncles pass from below upwards through the white core, to end in the grey matter of the tentorial surface of the cerebellum, more especially in that of the median lobe; on their way they are connected with the grey matter both of the corpus dentatum and of the roof nuclei. The superior peduncles, which descend from the corpora quadrigemina of the cerebrum, reach the grey cortical matter, more especially on the inferior surface of the cerebellum, though they also form connections with the corpus dentatum. The middle peduncles form a large proportion of the white core, and their fibres terminate in the grey matter of the foliated cortex of the hemispheres. But, in addition to these peduncular fibres, which connect the cerebellum to other subdivisions of the encephalon, its white matter contains fibres proper to the cerebellum itself. The fihroe proprice have been especially described by Stilling; some, which he has termed the median fasciculi, lie near the mesial plane, and connect the grey matter on the tentorial aspect of the middle lobe with that of the inferior vermiform process, whilst others cross directly the mesial plane to unite opposite and symmetrical regions of the hemispheres. Further, the auditory nerve was said by Foville to derive some of its fibres of origin from the cerebellum ; the connection of this nerve with the cerebellum has been strongly insisted on by Meynert, and this anatomist has also ascribed a cerebellar origin to a portion of the sensory root of the 5th cranial nerve. R258 ANATOMY. Tlie grey matter of the cortex is divided into two well- defined layers, an external grey or cellular layer, and an inner rust coloured layer of about equal thickness. The rust coloured layer is distinguished by containing multi- tudes of so called “granules,” the well-defined nucleus in which, as described by Strachan, is invested by a small Fig. 82.—Vertical section through a folium of the Cerebellum. 0, outer layer of grey matter, in which are the corpuscles of Purlcinje; I, inner or rust-coloured layer; F, fibres of the white core; V, V, vessels in the pia mater.

These “ granules ” are, therefore, minute stellate cells. The rust coloured layer is at least twice as thick in that part of each cerebellar leaflet which lies next the surface, as opposite the bottom of a fissure between adjacent leaflets (Fig. 82). The characteristic nerve cells of the cerebellum, named the259 THE BRAIN—CEREBELLUM. corpuscles of Purkinje, are situated in the grey cellular layer. The body of each cell lies close to the junction of the cellular and rust coloured layers with each other, and the slender central process arising from each cell enters the rust coloured layer, and, as the observations of Hadlich and Koschennikoff show, becomes’ continuous with the axial cylinder of a medullated nerve fibre; for the nerve fibres of the white core enter this layer, divide into minute fibres, and ramify amidst the granules. From the oppo- site aspect of each cell two peripheral processes arise, and ramify in an antler-like manner in the external grey layer. Obersteiner. and Hadlich maintain that the finer branches of these processes curve back towards the rust coloured layer, where, according to Boll, they form a net- work of extreme minuteness, from which it is believed that nerve fibres may arise. The substratum of the grey layer, in which the branched processes of the cells of Purkinje lie, consists of a very delicate neuroglia, in which scattered corpuscles are imbedded; but, in the outer part of this layer, delicate supporting connective tissue-like fibres are also met with. The blood-vessels of the invest- ing pia- mater pass into the cellular layer of grey matter and form in it a rich capillary plexus. Some pass through the cellular into the rust coloured layer, where they also form a rich capillary network, and from them smaller vessels are prolonged into the white core, the vascularity of which is comparatively feeble. The Fourth Ventricle is the dilated upper end of the cen- tral canal of the medulla oblongata. Its shape is like an heraldic lozenge. Its floor is formed by the grey matter of the posterior surfaces of the medulla oblongata and pons;260 ANATOMY. its roof partly by the inferior vermiform process of the cere- bellum, the nodule of which projects into its cavity, and partly by a thin layer, called valve of Viemsens, or anterior medullary velum; its lower lateral boundaries, by the diver- gent restiform bodies and posterior pyramids; its upper lateral boundaries, by the superior peduncles of the cere- bellum; the reflection of the arachnoid membrane from the Fig. 83.—Floor of the Fourth Ventricle and adjacent structures. 1, pineal gland; 2, the nates, and 3, the testes of the corpora quadrigemina; 4, 4, middle peduncles, 5, 5, superior peduncles, 9, 9, inferior peduncles of _ the cerebellum or restiform bodies; 6, 6, valve of Vieussens divided; 7, 7, fasciculi teretes; 8, 8, roots of the auditory nerves; 9', corpus dentatum; 10, 10, pos- terior pyramids; 11, calamus scriptorius. back of the medulla to the inferior vermiform process closes it in below; above, it communicates with the aqueduct of Sylvius, which is tunnelled through the substance of the corpora quadrigemina. Along the centre of the floor is the median furrow, which terminates below in a pen-shaped form, the so-called calamus scriptorvus. Situated on its floor are the fasciculi teretes, strise acoustics, and deposits261 THE BRAIN—CEREBRUM. of grey matter described in connection with, the medulla oblongata. Its epithelial lining is continuous with that of the central canal. Magendie many years ago pointed out that the cavity of the 4th ventricle communicated below through a small orifice with the sub-arachnoid space. Key and Ketzius have recently described two additional com- munications, one on each side of the anterior part of the floor of the ventricle. Through these openings vascular folds of the pia mater, named the choroid plexuses of the 4th ventricle, enter its cavity. CEREBRUM. The Cerebrum or Great Brain lies above the plane of the tentorium, and forms much the largest division of the encephalon. It is customary in human anatomy to include under the name of cerebrum, not only the convo- lutions, the corpora striata, and the optic thalami, developed in the anterior cerebral vesicle, but also the corpora quadri- gemina and crura cerebri developed in the middle cerebral vesicle. The cerebrum is ovoid in shape, and presents superiorly, anteriorly, and posteriorly a deep median longitu- dinal fissure, which subdivides it into two hemispheres. Inferiorly there is a continuity of structure between the two hemispheres across the mesial plane, and if the two hemispheres be drawn asunder by opening out the longi- tudinal fissure, a broad white band, the corpus callosum, may be seen at the bottom of that fissure passing across the mesial plane from one hemisphere to the other. The outer surface of each hemisphere is convex, and adapted in shape to the concavity of the inner table of the cranial bones.262 ANATOMY. Its inner surface, which forms the sides of the longitudinal fissure, is flat and is separated from the opposite hemi- sphere by the falx cerebri. Its under surface, where it rests on the tentorium, is concave, and is separated by that membrane from the cerebellum and pons. From the front of the pons two strong white bands, the crura cerebri or cere- bral 'peduncles, pass forwards and upwards to enter the optic thalami in their respective hemispheres. Winding round the outer side of each crus is a flat white band, the optic tract. These tracts converge in front, and join to form the optic commissure, from which the two optic nerves arise. The crura cerebri, optic tracts, and optic commissure enclose a lozenge-shaped space, which includes from behind for- wards—a, a grey layer, called pons Tarini, which, from being perforated by several small arteries, is often called locus perforatus posticus; b, two white mammillae, the cor- pora albicantia; c, a grey nodule, the tuber cinereum, from which, d, the infundibulum projects to join the pituitary body. Immediately in front of the optic commissure is a grey layer, the lamina cinerea or lamina terminalis of the 3d ventricle; and between the optic commissure and the inner end of each Sylvian fissure is a grey spot perforated by small arteries, the locus perforatus anticus. The peripheral part of each hemisphere, which consists of grey matter, exhibits a characteristic folded appearance, known as the convolutions or gym of the cerebrum. These convolutions are separated from each other by fissures or sulci, some of which are considered to subdivide the hemi- sphere into lobes, whilst others separate the convolutions in each lobe from each other. In each hemisphere of the human brain five lobes are recognised: the temporo-sphe-263 THE BRAIN—CEREBRUM. noidal, frontal, parietal, occipital, and the central lobe or insula. Passing obliquely along the outer face of the hemi- sphere from before, upwards and backwards, is the well- marked Sylvian fissure, which is the first to appear in the development of the hemisphere. Below it lies the tem- poro-sphenoidal lobe, and above and in front of it, the parietal and frontal lobes. The frontal lobe is separated from the parietal by the fissure of Rolando, which extends on the outer face of the hemisphere from the longitudinal fissure obliquely downwards and forwards towards the Sylvian fissure. About two inches from the hinder end of the hemisphere is the parieto-occipital fissure, which, commencing at the longitudinal fissure, passes down the inner surface of the hemisphere, and also transversely out- wards for a short distance on the outer surface of the hemi- sphere; it separates the parietal and occipital lobes from each other. The Temporo-sphenoidal Lobe (Pigs. 84, 86) presents on the outer surface of the hemisphere three convolutions, arranged in parallel tiers from above downwards, and named superior, middle, and inferior temporo-sphenoidal convolutions. The fissure which separates the superior and middle of these convolutions is called the parallel fissure. The Occipital Lobe also consists from above downwards of three parallel convolutions, named superior, middle, and inferior occipital. The Frontal Lobe is more complex; immediately in front of the fissure of Rolando, and forming indeed its anterior boundary, is a convo- lution named ascending frontal, which ascends obliquely backwards and upwards from the Sylvian to the longi- tudinal fissure. Springing from the front of this con-■ 264 ANATOMY. volution, and passing forwards to the-anterior end of .the cerebrum, are three convolutions,, arranged in parallel tiers from above downwards, and named superior, middle, and inferior frontal convolutions, which are also prolonged on to the orbital face of the frontal lobe, which rests on the orbital plate of the frontal bone. The Parietal Lobe is also complex; its most anterior convolution, named ascending parietal, ascends -parallel to and immediately behind the fissure of Rolando. Springing from the upper end of the back of this convolution is the postero-parietal convolution^hich., forming the boundary of the longitudinal fissure, extends as far back as the parieto-occipital fissure; springing from the lower end of the back of this convo- lution is the supra-marginal convolution, which forms the upper boundary of the hinder part of the Sylvian fissure ; as this gyrus occupies the hollow in the parietal bone, which corresponds to the parietal eminence, it may appro- priately be named the convolution of the parietal eminence.THE.

These lobes of the cerebrum, though named after the bones which form the vault of the skull, are not exactly co-terminous with them (Fig. 86).

The Central Lobe of the hemisphere, more usually called the insula ox island of Beil (Fig. 87, C), does not come to the surface of the hemisphere, but lies deeply within the Sylvian fissure, the convolutions forming the margin of which con- ceal it. It consists of four or five short convolutions, which radiate from the locus perforatus anticus, situated at the inner end of the fissure. This lobe is almost entirely sur- rounded by a deep sulcus, which insulates it from the adja- cent convolutions. It lies opposite the upper part of the alisphenoid, where it articulates with the parietal and squa- mous-temporal. If the convolutions on the outer face of the hemisphere be now examined, not so much with reference to their disposition in the individual lobes as to their general arrangement, and the fissure of Rolando be taken as the starting line, it will be seen that a well-defined convolu- tion extends in the vertical transverse direction immediately in front of, and a second immediately behind, that fissure, from the margin of the longitudinal fissure downwards and outwards to that of Sylvius. These are the ascending frontal and parietal gyri. From the anterior of these gyri the convolutions extend in the postero-anterior direction to the anterior end of the cerebrum, and form the three tiers (more or less distinct in different individuals) of the frontal gyri. From the posterior of these gyri, also, con- volutions extend in the antero-posterior direction as far as the posterior end of the cerebrum, but their separation into tiers is not so clearly marked as in the anterior group. Still we may regard the postero-parietal lobule, the first270 ANATOMY. annectent, gyrus, and the superior occipital convolution, which are continuous with each other, as forming collec- tively a superior tier. The supra-marginal convolution, the angular gyrus, the second annectent, and middle occipital gyri, may be looked upon as members of a second or in- ferior tier, though their foldings are often so complex as to add materially to the difficulty of determining their continuity. The gyri of the temporo-sphenoidal lobe, again, are characterised by their correspondence in direc- tion with the horizontal limb of the Sylvian fissure, below which they lie. By their upper ends they blend with the middle and inferior occipital gyri, and with the angular gyrus of the parietal lobe, and thus, as it were, continue the posterior convolutions of the inferior tier downwards and forwards to the tip of the temporo-sphenoidal lobe. In this manner the convolutions just referred to are so associated together as to be grouped around, and form, if one may so express it, a cap or hood, which encloses the convolutions of the central lobe or island .of Beil; and this in so effectual a manner, that it is rare to find any of that structure exposed. It is by the great development of the inferior frontal gyrus, the lower ends of the two ascending convolutions, the supra-marginal convolution, the angular and inferior temporo-sphenoidal gyri, that the lips of the Sylvian fissure are so closely approximated, that the island is completely concealed within it. Convolutions also exist on the inner surface of the hemisphere, and on the under surface which rests on the tentorium, but these have no relation to the bones of the cranial vault. They may be studied in connection with the corpus callosum or great transverse commissure, whichTHE BRAIN—CEREBRUM. 271 connects the two hemispheres, and with certain fissures situated on these surfaces of the hemisphere. The small convolutions which lie behind the internal part of the parieto-occipital fissure form the inner convolutions of the occipital lobe, or the occipital lobule (Fig. 88). Those which lie immediately in front of the same fissure belong to the inner face of the parietal lobe, and form the quadrilateral lobule. It is customary, however, to name the convolution which extends forwards from the parieto-occipital fissure along the margin of the longitudinal fissure to the anterior end of ther hemisphere, and which then turns back to the locus perforatus anticus, as the marginal convolution. This is separated by a fissure called calloso-marginal, from the callosal convolution or gyrus fornicatus, which, commencing at the locus perforatus anticus, turns round the anterior end of the corpus callosum, extends parallel to its upper surface, and then turns round its posterior end. It is separated from the corpus callosum by the callosal fissure, at the bottom of which the grey matter of the gyrus forni- catus terminates in a well-defined edge. The callosal convolution (Fig. 88) encloses the corpus callosum within the concavity of its arch, and from its direction is appropriately called fornicatus (arch-shaped). The posterior end of the callosal convolution curves downwards and then forwards, under the name of gyrus hippocampi, to the tip of the inner surface of the temporo- sphenoidal lobe. This gyrus is separated anteriorly by a narrow curved fissure called hippocampal or dentate fissure, from a white band, the tcenia hippocampi, which band possesses a free curved border, round which the pia mater and choroidal artery enter the lateral ventricle through theANATOMY. 272 great transverse fissure of the cerebrum. The hippocampal fissure is continuous round the posterior end of the corpus callosum with the callosal fissure, and at the bottom of the hippocampal fissure the grey matter of the gyrus hippo- campi terminates in a well-defined dentated border (fascia dentata). The hippocampal fissure on this surface of the hemisphere marks the position of an eminence in the de- scending cornu of the ventricle called hippocampus rmajor. The gyrus hippocampi is separated posteriorly from the Fig. 88.—Convolutions of tlie inner and tentorial surfaces of the left hemi- sphere. i, i, i, calloso-marginal fissure; l, l, calcarine fissure; m, m, hippo- campal fissure; ft, ft, collateral fissure; PO, parieto-occipital fissure; 17,17, marginal convolution; 18, 18, gyrus fomicatus; 18', quadrilateral lobule; 19, hippocampal gyrus; 19', its recurved end; 25, occipital lobule; 9, 9, infe- rior temporo-sphenoidal convolution. adjacent temporo-sphenoidal convolution by a fissure, named collateral, which marks the position on this surface of the hemisphere of the collateral eminence in the interior of the ventricle. From the lower end of the parieto-occipital fissure an offshoot, called the calcarine fissure, passes almost horizontally backwards in the occipital lobe, which fissure marks on this surface of the hemisphere the eminence named calcar avis, or hippocampus minor, in the posterior cornu of the ventricle.THE BRAIN—CEREBRUM. 273 If a horizontal slice be removed from the upper part of each hemisphere, the peripheral grey matter of the convo- lutions will be seen to follow their various windings, whilst the core of each convolution consists of white matter con- tinuous with a mass of white matter in the interior of the hemisphere. If a deeper slice be now made down to the plane of the corpus callosum, the white matter of that structure will be seen to be continuous with the white centre of each hemisphere. The corpus callosum does not equal the hemispheres in length, but approaches nearer to their anterior than their posterior ends (Fig. 89). It terminates behind in a free rounded end, whilst in front it forms a knee-shaped bend, and passes downwards and backwards as far as the lamina cinerea. It is thicker behind than in front, whilst the middle part is the thinnest. If the dissection be performed on a brain which has been hardened in spirit, the corpus callosum is seen to consist of bundles of nerve fibres, almost the whole of which pass transversely across the mesial plane between the two hemispheres ] these fibres may be traced into the white cores and grey matter of the convolutions, and apparently connect the corresponding convolutions in the opposite hemispheres. Hence the corpus callosum is a connecting or commissural structure, which brings the convolutions of the two hemispheres into anatomical and physiological relation with each other. On the surface of the corpus callosum a few fibres, the stride longitudinales, run in the antero-posterior or longitudinal direction. If the corpus callosum be now cut through on each side of its mesial line, the large cavity or lateral ventricle in each hemisphere will be opened into. The lateral ventricle (Fig. 89) is subdivided into a central S274 ANATOMY. space or body, and three bent prolongations or cornua; the anterior cornu extends forwards and outwards into the frontal lobe; the posterior cornu curves backwards, Fig. 89.—To show the right ventricle and the left half of the Corpus Callosum. a. transverse fibres, and 6, longitudinal fibres of corpus callosum; c, anterior, and d, posterior cornua of lateral ventricle; e, septum lucidum; /, corpus striatum; g, tainia semicircularis; ft, optic thalamus; ft, choroid plexus; ft tamia hippocampi; in, hippocampus major; n, hippocampus minor; o, emmentia col- laterals. outwards, and inwards into the occipital lobe; the de- scending cornu curves backwards, outwards, downwards, forwards, and inwards, behind and below the optic that lamus into the temporo-sphenoidal lobe. On the floor of275 THE BRAIN—CEREBRUM. tlie central space may be seen from before backwards the grey upper surface of the pear-shaped corpus striatum, and to its inner and posterior part a small portion of the optic thalamus, whilst between the two is the curved flat band; the taenia semicircularis. Resting on the upper surface of the thalamus is the vascular fringe of the velum interposi- tum, named choroid plexus, and immediately internal to this fringe is the free edge of the white posterior pillar oj the fornix. The anterior cornu has the anterior end of the corpus striatum projecting into it. The posterior cornu has an elevation on its floor, the hippocampus minor, and between this cornu and the descending cornu is the eleva- tion called eminentia collateralis. Extending down the descending cornu and following its curvature is the hippocampus major, which terminates below in a nodular end, the pes hippocampi ; on its inner border is the white tcenia hippocampi, continuous above with the posterior pillar of the fornix. If the tamia be drawn on one side the hippocampal fissure is exposed, at the bottom of which the grey matter of the gyms hippo- campi may be seen to form a well-defined dentated border (the so-called fascia dentata). The choroid plexus of the pia mater turns round the gyrus hippocampi, and enters the descending cornu through the great transverse fissure be- tween the trenia hippocampi and optic thalamus. The lateral ventricle is lined by a cylindrical epithelium, which is in many parts ciliated, and which rests on a layer of neuroglia. This lining is continuous through the fora- men of Monro with that of the third ventricle, which again is continuous with the lining of the fourth ventricle through the aqueduct of Sylvius. A little fluid is con-276 ANATOMY, tained in tlie cerebral ventricles, which, under some patho- logical conditions, may increase greatly in quantity, so as to occasion considerable dilatation of the ventricular cavities.

If tlie anterior half of the corpus callosum be now turned forward, the grey partition, or septum lucidum, between the two lateral ventri- cles is exposed. This septum fits into the interval between the under surface of the corpus callosum and the upper surface of the anterior part of the fornix. It consists of two layers of grey matter, between which is a narrow ver- tical mesial space, the fifth ventricle. If the septum be now removed, the anterior part of the fornix is brought into view. The fornix or arch is an arch-shaped band of nerve fibres extending in the antero-posterior direction. Its ante- rior end forms the anterior piers or pillars of the arch, its posterior end the posterior piers ox pillars, whilst the inter- mediate body of the fornix forms the summit or crown of the arch. It consists of two lateral halves, one belonging to each hemisphere. At the summit of the arch the two lateral halves are conjoined to form the body; but in front of the body the two halves separate from each other, and form two anterior pillars, which descend in front of the third ventricle to the base of the cerebrum, where they form the corpora albicantia, and then enter the substance of the optic thalamus. Behind the body the two halves diverge much more from each other, and form the posterior pillars; each of which curves downwards and outwards into the descending cornu of the ventricle, and, under the name of tcenia hippocampi, forms the free border of the hippocampus major. If the body of the fornix be now divided by a transverse incision, its anterior part thrown forwards, and its posterior part backwards, the great trans- verse fissure of the cerebrum is opened into, and the velum interpositum lying in that fissure is exposed (Fig. 90).ANATOMY. 278 The velum interpositum is an expanded fold of pia mater, which passes into the interior of the hemispheres through the great transverse fissure. It is triangular in shape; its base is in a line with the posterior end of the corpus callosum, where it is continuous with the pia mater investing the convolutions; its lateral margins are fringed by the choroid plexuses, which are seen in the bodies and descending cornua of the lateral ventricles, where they are invested by the epithelial lining of those cavities. Its apex, where the two choroid plexuses blend with each other, lies just behind the anterior pillars of the fornix. The interval between the apex and these pillars is the aperture of communication between the two lateral ventricles and the third, already referred to as the foramen of Monro. The choroid plexuses contain the small choroidal arteries, which supply the cor- pora striata, optic thalami, and corpora quadrigemina; and the blood from these bodies is returned by small veins, which join to form the veins of Galen (Fig. 90). These veins pass along the centre of the velum, and, as is shown in Fig. 7 2, open into the straight sinus. If the velum interpositum be now carefully raised from before backwards, the optic thalami, third ventricle, pineal gland, and corpora quadri- gemina are exposed. The optic thalamus is a large, somewhat ovoid body situ- ated behind and to the inner side of the corpus striatum, and above the crus cerebri (Fig. 91). Its upper surface is partly seen in the floor of the body of the lateral ventricle, but is for the most part covered by the fornix and velum interpositum. Its postero-inferior surface forms the roof of the descending cornu of the ventricle, whilst its inner surface forms the side wall of the third ventricle.

The third ventricle is a cavity situated in the mesial plane between the two optic thalami. Its roof is formed by the280 • ANATOMY. velum interpositum and the body of the fornix; its floor, by the pons Tarini, corpora albicantia, tuber cinereum, infundibulum, and optic commissure; its anterior bound- ary* by tbe anterior pillars of the fornix, anterior commis- sure, and lamina cinerea; its posterior boundary, by the corpora quadrigemina and posterior commissure. The cavity of this ventricle is of small size in the living head, for the inner surfaces of the two thalami are connected together by intermediate grey matter, named the middle or soft commissure; but in taking the brain out of the cranial cavity this commissure is usually more or less torn through, and the cavity is consequently enlarged. Imme- diately in front of the corpora quadrigemina, the white fibres of the 'posterior commissure pass across between the two optic thalami. If the anterior pillars of the fornix be separated from each other, the white fibres of the anterior commissure may be seen entering the two corpora striata. The pineal body is a reddish cone-shaped body, enveloped by the velum interpositum, and situated upon the more anterior pair of the corpora quadrigemina. From its broad anterior end two white bands, the peduncles of the pineal body, pass forwards, one on the inner side of each optic thalamus. Each peduncle joins, along with the trenia semicircularis, the anterior pillar of the fornix of its own side. In its structure this body consists of a vascular stroma of connective tissue, in the meshes of which lymphoid cells are contained. Branched corpuscles which are regarded as nerve cells are also found. Amylaceous and gritty calcareous particles, constituting the brain sand, are also found in it. Usually it is hollowed out into two or more small cavities. The function of the pineal body is notINTERNAL STRUCTURE OE THE CEREBRUM. 281 understood, but both it and tbe pituitary body, which possess a certain structural correspondence, are usually referred to the type of the ductless glands. The corpora quadrigemina or optic lobes are situated behind and between the two optic thalami, and rest upon the posterior surface of the crura cerebri. The division into two lateral halves is marked by a shallow longitu- dinal fissure, and the subdivision of each half into an an- terior and a posterior eminence, by a shallow transverse fissure. The anterior pair of eminences are called nates; the posterior, testes. From each testis a strong white band, the superior peduncle of the cerebellum, passes back- wards to the cerebellum, and stretching between the pair of peduncles is the valve of Vieussens or anterior medullary velum. The corpora quadrigemina are tunnelled in the antero-posterior direction by the aqueduct of Sylvius, which opens anteriorly into the third ventricle immediately below the posterior commissure, and posteriorly into the fourth ventricle under cover of the valve of Vieussens; it is lined by a cylindrical ciliated epithelium. Internal Structure of the Cerebrum. The cerebrum is composed both of grey and white matter; the general relations of these two forms of nerve matter to each other may be seen by making sections through the cerebrum. The determination, however, of their minute structure, and of the relations and connections of the nerve fibres to the nerve cells is, owing to the deli- cacy of the organ, one of the most difficult departments of anatomical study. Several anatomists have endeavouredANATOMY. 282 to trace out the course of the nerve fibres in the organ, and though our knowledge is by no means complete, yet many important facts have undoubtedly been ascertained. These facts have been summarised, and numerous additions made to them by Meynert in a recent elaborate memoir pub- lished in Strieker’s Handbuch der Gewebelehre. The Grey Matter of the cerebrum is disposed in three great groups : a, The grey matter of the cortex of the hemi- spheres ; b, the grey matter of the great ganglia of the base of the cerebrum; c, the central grey matter which forms the wall of the cerebral end of the cerebro-spinal tube. a, The grey matter of the cortex of the hemisphere forms the superficial part of the convolutions, and is known as the great hemispherical ganglion, but in some localities, as at the loci perforati antici and the; septum lucidum, it has received distinctive names. When a convolution is divided vertically the grey matter is seen to be confined to the surface and to enclose a white core. The grey matter presents a laminated appearance, and as a rule consists of five or six layers, which are composed of the characteristic pyramidal nerve cells of the cortex of the cerebrum, of nerve fibres, of matrix or neuroglia, and of blood-vessels. The most superficial layer consists of neuroglia, in which nerve fibres extend parallel to the surface of the convolutions. In the deeper layers are found the pyramidal nerve cells, which lie with their long axes vertical to the surface of the convolutions, and which contain well-marked nuclei. From the observations of Lockhart Clarke, Arndt, Cleland, and Meynert, there can be no doubt that the pyramidal nerve cells vary in relative size and in numbers in the different layers of the grey cortex, and that the largest sized pyra-INTERNAL STRUCTURE OP THE CEREBRUM. 283 midal cells lie in the third and fourth layers. L. Clarke stated that the^ cells of all the layers of the posterior or occipital lobe were small and of nearly uniform size, whilst in the convolutions anterior to it numerous cells of a much larger kind were found; but though it is undoubtedly true that large pyramidal cells are found in the fronfal lobe in considerable numb.ers, and that the greater nifmber of the cells of the occipital lobe are small and nearly uniform in size,\ there is no difficulty in recognising in the occipital lobe a small proportion of cells, quite equal in magnitude to the n j r , .

Large lobe, interspersed amongst and small-sized pyramidal nerve cells; ,t n the neuroglia, with its corpuscles and tne smaller pyramidal ceils. some capillary blood-vessels, are repre- sented. The nerve fibres which as- cend into the grey matter from the white core of the con- volution radiate into its several layers, and are apparently continuous with the basal axial cylinder processes of the nerve cells. According to Clelaud, the elongated apices of the cells, which are directed to the surface of the convolu- tion, are continuous with the nerve fibres situated in the superficial layer of horizontal fibres. Immediately subjacentANATOMY. 284 to the large pyramidal cells numerous small, irregularly shaped nerve corpuscles, like those of the internal granule layer of the retina, form the so-called grannie layer (A the grey matter. Fusiform cells, which give off lateral processes, are found in the deepest layer of the grey matter, and form the claustral layer of Meynert. Gerlach has described here, as in the spinal cord, a network of extremely minute nerve fibies, with which the branched lateral processes of the nerve cells are apparently continuous. The neuroglia con- tains multitudes of small rounded corpuscles. • In it also are found small stellate cells, provided with minute branched processes, which cells, as Meynert states, are so pellucid, that in the healthy brain they seem to be only free nuclei; it is difficult to say whether these cells belong to the neuroglia, or are nerve cell elements. The grey cortex of the cerebrum is about five times as vascular as the white matter. The arteries derived from the pia mater pass ver- tically into the grey matter. Some terminate in a rich capillary plexus within the grey matter. Other vessels of larger size, after giving off small branches, which join the capillary plexus of the grey matter, pass into the white matter, where they are continuous with a much more scanty capillary plexus than is found in the grey matter. In the grey matter of the cortex of the occipital lobe eight layers have been described by Clarke and Meynert. The increase in number is due to the intercalation of two additional granule layers, which coalesce and form a dis- tinct white band in the grey matter, owing, as Meynert states, to the absence of pigment in the cells of the granule layers. The grey matter of the cortex of the island of Reil andINTERNAL STRUCTURE OF THE CEREBRUM. 285 of tlie convolutions bounding tlie Sylvian fissure contains a very large proportion of fusiform cells. They form the chief constituent of the grey claustrum, situated deeper than the grey matter of the island, and separated from the outer part of the corpus striatum by a thin layer of white matter. Fusiform cells also occur abundantly in the nucleus amyg- dalae, a grey mass situated below the corpus striatum, which in some sections seems as if isolated, but in reality is continuous with the grey matter of the inferior temporo- sphenoidal convolution. The grey matter of the cortex of the gyrus hippocampi has its superficial layer formed of nerve fibres, with small and scattered corpuscles, and has been named the nuclear lamina. Next this lamina lies the stratum reticulare, in which the apices of the numerous pyramidal cells, which form the third layer, branch and again unite to form a delicate net- work. This layer of nerve cells is prolonged into the hippocampus major, in which it is rolled on itself in a con- voluted manner. The free surface of the hippocampus, seen in the descending horn of the ventricle, is formed of nerve fibres continuous with the fibres of the taenia hippo- campi. Deeper than the pyramidal nerve cells of the hippocampus is a well-marked layer, prolonged also into the fascia dentata, which Meynert has termed the stratum of compressed nerve corpuscles. This layer, however, as was recognised by A. B. Stirling some years ago, resembles the “granules” of the rust coloured layer of the cerebel- lum, and may more appropriately be called the rust-coloured layer of the hippocampus ; each granule consists of a well- defined nucleus invested by delicate branched protoplasm. , The grey matter of the two layers of the septum luci-286 ANATOMY. dum, though included between the corpus callosum and fornix, is yet in the same plane as the grey matter of the cortex of the inner surface of the hemispheres, but is cut off from it by the development of the transverse fibres of the corpus callosum. The grey matter of the locus per- forates anticus contains clusters of minute granules and a compact arrangement of small nerve cells. b, The great ganglia of the base of the cerebrum are the corpora striata, the optic thalami, the corpora geniculata, the corpora quadrigemina, and the locus niger in each crus cerebri. The corpus striatum cerebri consists of two masses of grey matter separated from each other by numerous striae of white fibres, which ascend from below upwards through its substance. The upper mass of grey matter projects into the lateral ventricle, and is called the intra-ventricular portion or nucleus caudatus. The lower extra-ventricular portion or nucleus lenticularis forms the outer and lower part of the corpus striatum, and is separated by the claustrum from the island of Reil. Multipolar nerve cells are found in both the caudate and lenticular masses, and in the latter cells of large size have been seen. The optic thalamus forms an almost continuous mass of grey matter traversed by nerve fibres, which are not, how- ever, collected into definite striae. The nerve cells in the grey matter are both multipolar and fusiform. The exter- nal corpus geniculatum consists of alternate layers of grey and white matter, due to the zig-zag folding of the grey matter; the nerve cells are multipolar, and contain pig- ment. In the internal corpus geniculatum the cells are smaller in size and fusiform.INTERNAL STRUCTURE OF THE CEREBRUM. 287 The grey matter of the corpora quadrigemina consists of two distinct masses. One, the peripheral layer, lies near the surface, and contains numerous small multipolar nerve cells; the other, the Sylvian or central layer, surrounds the Sylvian fissure and belongs to the grey matter of the wall of the cerebro-spinal tube, and serves as a centre of origin for the roots of both the 3d and 4th cranial nerves. The grey matter of the crus cerebri occupies the centre of the cerebral peduncle. Its cells are multipolar, and con- tain dark brown or black pigment, so that the name locus niger is applied to this collection of nerve cells. c, The central grey matter of the cerebrum is in series with the grey matter of the floor of the 4th ventricle and the grey matter of the spinal cord. It is situated around the Sylvian aqueduct, and at the sides and floor of the third ventricle, which form the cerebral portion of the cerebro- spinal tube. That which surrounds the aqueduct of Sylvius forms the Sylvian or central layer in the corpora quad- rigemina, above referred to. It contains numerous well- marked multipolar nerve cells, which are largest and most distinct below the aqueduct, where they form well-defined groups. But further, a remarkable zone-like arrangement of nerve cells lies at the circumference of the sides and upper part of the central mass of grey matter (Fig. 93). In vertical transverse sections these cells may be seen to lie some- times singly, but more usually in groups of two or three, or up to six cells. The cells are twice, or even three times as large as the multipolar nerve cells of the central mass. The body of the cell is often globular in form, and from it one or two processes arise. The cells lie in a tract of well- defined nerve fibres, to- which they have apparently the sameANATOMY. 288 relation that the cells in the ganglion on the posterior root of a spinal nerve have to the nerve fibres. The central grey matter, which lies in relation to the third ven- tricle, forms the middle or soft commissure, and the well- defined grey layer which covers the inner wall of each optic thalamus.

At the right lower comer two cells of the zonular region are represented, highly magnified. Tarini, tuber cinereum, lamina cinerea, infundibulum, and the grey matter of the pituitary body, belong to the central grey matter. By some anatomists the grey matter of the pineal body is referred to the same category, but Arnold has pointed out that it is separated by its peduncle from the soft commissure ; and Meynert is disposed to regard it as a ganglion of origin of the tegmentum. Both the pituitary and pineal bodies contain, besides the nervous matter, structures of the type of the glands without ducts.INTERNAL STRUCTURE OF THE CEREBRUM. 289 The White Matter of the cerebrum consists of tracts or fasciculi of nerve fibres, of which—a, some connect the cere- brum with the lower divisions of the encephalon; h, others connect the two hemispheres together; c, others connect different structures in the same hemisphere; d, others serve as roots of origin for the more anterior encephalic nerves. a, The tracts of fibres which connect the cerebrum with the lower divisions of the encephalon are called p>eduncular fibres. The largest of these peduncles are the two crura cerebri or cerebral 'peduncles. Continuous below with the longitudinal fibres of the pons they ascend into the optic thalami and corpora striata, and their fibres are named the peduncular fibres. From the corpora striata and optic thalami fibres radiate into the convolutions of the lobes of the hemisphere and form the corona radiata. To some extent the fibres of the corona are directly continuous with those of the cerebral peduncles, but there can be no doubt that a large portion of the peduncular fibres terminate in the grey matter of the ganglia of the base of the cerebrum, and that a still larger number arise from their nerve cells to aid in the formation of the corona radiata. The direct continuity, therefore, of many of the peduncular fibres with those of the corona is broken or interrupted by the inter- position of the ganglia of the base of the cerebrum, which Meynert has named ganglia of interruption. The pedun- cular fibres and those of the corona constitute the cerebral portion of theprojection system of fibres of Meynert, a term devised to express that they conduct upwards to the grey cortex of the hemispheres sensory impulses derived from the external world, the image of which is projected upon the cortex. But it should also not be forgotten that many of the T290 ANATOMY. fibres of this system conduct motor impulses downwards to be propagated along the motor cranial and spinal nerves. The peduncular fibres of the crura cerebri are arranged in two groups, named respectively crusta and tegmentum, which are separated from each other by the nerve cells of the locus niger. The crusta forms the superficial or anterior part of the crus. Its fibres are in greater part continuous with the longitudinal fibres of the pons derived from the anterior pyramids of the medulla; but it receives additional fibres from the grey matter of the locus niger, and from the cells of the Sylvian layer in the corpora quadrigemina. Some of the fibres of the crusta pass directly upwards as radiating fibres to the grey cortex of the occipital and temporal lobes, but the larger number terminate in the nucleus caudatus and nucleus lenticularis of the corpus striatum. From these nuclei a great mass of fibres radiates into the cortex of the fronto-parietal lobes, more especially the frontal, but a few also, bearing the special name of stria cornea, pass to the grey matter of the apex of the temporal lobe ; fibres also enter the convolutions of the insula. In addition to the radiating fibres, the grey matter of the corpus striatum gives origin to fibres of the middle root of the olfactory peduncle, and to connecting fibres with the grey matter of the septum lucidum. The tegmentum forms the posterior or deeper part of the crus cerebri. Its fibres are continuous ■with the longi- tudinal fibres of the pons derived from the olivary fasciculi, fasciculi teretes, and posterior pyramids of the medulla. A. few of the fibres of the tegmentum enter the corpora quadrigemina and corpora geniculata, but the great ma-INTERNAL STRUCTURE OF THE CEREBRUM. 291 jority enter the optic thalami, in the grey matter of which many evidently terminate, though some may pass through into the cortex of the hemispheres as fibres of the corona radiata. But the grey matter of the thalamus gives origin to numerous radiating fibres : those which arise in its posterior part radiate into the occipital and temporal lobes, whilst those proceeding out of its anterior part radiate into the frontal, parietal, and temporal lobes, and the insula. In the optic thalamus the fornix arises. Its fibres emerge from the under surface of each thalamus, form the corpus albicans, and then pass backwards forming the upper boundary of the great transverse fissure to end as the taenia hippocampi in the gyrus hippocampi; hence this convolu- tion has a special connection with the optic thalamus through the fornix. In the corpus albicans the fibres of the fornix are arranged in loops, in the concavities of which nerve cells are situated. The optic thalamus also gives origin to the middle root of the optic tract. Owing to the connections of the locus niger, nucleus caudatus, and nucleus lenticularis with the crusta, Meynert has named them the ganglia of the crusta ; whilst the optic thalami, corpora quadrigemina, and geniculata are the gan- glia of the tegmentum. The comparison of the human brain with those of different mammals has shown that the development of the hemispheres bears a direct relation to the size of the crusta and its ganglia, whilst the develop- ment of the hemispheres is in inverse relation to the size of the tegmentum and its ganglia. The superior peduncles of the cerebellum connect that organ with the cerebrum. They arise in the grey matter of the veimiform process, ascend to the ■corpora quadri-ANATOMY. 292 gemina, and are for the most part prolonged upwards below it into the tegmentum, and into the optic thalamus. b, The fibres which connect together the two hemispheres are called commissural fibres. The largest of these com- missures is the corpus callosum, which, as has already been described, connects corresponding convolutions in the opposite hemispheres. As its fibres lie on a plane superior to those of the corona radiata, the two systems of fibres intersect with each other on their way to the convolutions. The anterior commissure, though often described as con- necting the two corpora striata, yet, as Spurzheim pointed out half a century ago, passes through these bodies to the convolutions around the Sylvian fissure, and gives a root of origin to the olfactory nerve. The posterior' commissure passes into the optic thalami. The course of its fibres has recently been studied by Pawlowsky, who states that they proceed from the pineal body, the frontal and temporal lobes, and probably also from the thalamus, and then cross over to the tegmentum of the opposite crus cerebri. c, The tracts which connect different convolutions in the same hemisphere are named arcuate fibres, or fibrce proprice. The arcuate fibres are situated immediately beneath the inner surface of the cortex of the hemispheres, and connect together the grey matter of adjacent convolutions. In some localities', they are strongly marked, and^ave received special names. The fasciculus undnatus passes across the Sylvian fissure, traverses the claustrum and amygdala, and connects the convolutions of the frontal with those of the temporo- sphenoidal lobe. The fillet of the gyrus fornicatus extendsINTERNAL STRUCTURE OF THE CEREBRUM. 293 longitudinally in that convolution, immediately above the corpus callosum, from its anterior to its posterior ends, and connects different parts of its grey matter together. The longitudinal fibres of the corpus callosum, or nerves of Lancisi, also connect the anterior and posterior ends of the callosal convolution. The longitudinal inferior fasci- culus connects the convolutions of the occipital with those of the temporal lobe. Longitudinal septal fibres lie on the inner surface of the septum lucidum, and extend into the gyrus fornicatus. The corpora quadrigemina are connected with the optic thalami by nervous tracts called brachia, and smaller tracts also connect the thalami with the corpora geniculata. The peduncles of the pineal gland connect that body with the fornix, and are probably continued into the optic thalamus. The taenia semicircularis is also at one end apparently con- nected with the optic thalamus, but its posterior termination is not well ascertained. The great cerebral ganglia and the central masses of grey matter are centres of origin for sensori-motor nerves. The convolutions or hemispherical ganglia, again, are the parts of the brain associated with the intellectual processes. The question has often been put, Are not the individual con- volutions distinct organs, each endowed with special pro- perties 1 and various arguments based on physiological, pathological, and anatomical grounds have been advanced in support of this proposition. In connection with the anatomical branch of the argument it may be stated that the convolutions, not only in man, but in all animals with convoluted brains, have a form, relative position, and arrangement which are characteristic of the species; butANATOMY. 294 specialisation of form, position, and arrangement are not in themselves a sufficient test of specialisation of function. Again, though the convolutions have definite forms they are not disconnected from each other, for the grey matter forms a continuous layer over the whole surface of the hemisphere. Hence a group of cerebral convolutions differs from a group of muscles, each member of which is un- doubtedly a distinct organ, for each muscle is isolated from those around it by a definite investing sheath. As regards internal structure, evidence has already been given that all the convolutions are not constructed on precisely the same plan, and it has also been pointed out that the con- volutions are not all connected in the same way with the great cerebral ganglia. These structural modifications un- questionably point to functional differences in the several parts in which they are found. But further, special connections through the arcuate fibres are established between certain convolutions and not between others, and it is possible not only that particular combinations of convolutions through an interchange of internuncial fibres may condition a particular state of intellectual activity, but that these combinations associate various convolutions together in the performance of a given intellectual act, just as in the muscular system several muscles are as a rule associated together for the performance of a given move- ment. A clue to the special functions of the convolutions will doubtless be obtained by studying their connections with each other and with other parts of the encephalon, just as the action of the members of a group of muscles is ascertained by examining the direction of their fibres and the attachment of their terminal tendons.INTERNAL STRUCTURE OE THE CEREBRUM. 295 Variations within certain limits in the degree of com- plexity of arrangement of the convolutions are found in the human hrain. The observations of Gratiolet and Marshall on the brains of women of the Bush race have shown that in them a greater simplicity of arrangement, due to the foldings of the surface being less numerous, prevails than in the average European brain. Again, the observations of Rudolph and Hermann Wagner on the brains of Gauss and Dirichlet, the eminent mathematicians, show that the convoluted surface was much more tortuous, and the superficial area of the convolutions was consider- ably greater than in the average European brain. From these and other data, it is evident that a complex arrange- ment of the convolutions may co-exist with high intellectual powers. But it must also be admitted that men of un- doubted intellectual ability have been found to possess brains in which the convolutions had no unusually com- plex arrangement. In endeavouring to form an estimate of the comparative value of the convolutions in different individuals, not only should the degree of tortuosity of the surface be inquired into, but the depth of the sulci, the thickness of the grey matter, and the quality of the tissue of which the convolutions are composed. A brain with deep sulci, conjoined with a thick layer of grey matter, but with comparatively simple gyri, might present as large a hemispherical ganglion as one the convolutions of which were more tortuous but less deep. Presumably that grey matter is the most active which contains the greatest proportion of nerve cells in a given area. From the structural point of view, one may say that those convolu- tions present the most complex organisation in which,ANATOMY. 296 with a large proportion of nerve cells, the foldings of the surface are tortuous, the sulci are numerous and deep, and the grey matter possesses relatively considerable thickness. As regards the convolutions in opposite hemispheres of the same brain, it should be stated that a want of sym- metry is by no means uncommon. Mass and Weight op the Brain.—The human brain is absolutely bigger and heavier than the brain of any animal, except the elephant and the larger whales. The brain of the elephant is said to weigh from 8 to 10 lbs., and that of a large finner whale between 5 and 6 lbs. The human brain is also heavier relatively to the bulk and weight of the body than are the brains of the lower animals, except in some small birds and mammals. Considerable variations, however, exist in the size and weight of the human brain, not only in the different races of mankind, but in individuals of the same race and in the two sexes. The heaviest brains occur in the white races. The average weight of the adult European male brain is 49 to 50 oz. (about 3 lbs.), that, of the adult female 44 to 45 oz.; so that the brain of a man is on the average fully 10 per cent, heavier than that of a woman. The greater weight of the brain in man as compared with woman is not in relation merely to his greater bulk, but is a fundamental sexual distinction; for, whilst there is a difference of 10 per cent, in the brain weight, the average stature of women is, according to Thurnam’s calculations, only 8 per cent, less than that of men. Dr Boyd states that the average weight of the brain in the newly born male infant is 11*67 oz.; in the female only 10 oz. The exact age at which the brain reaches its maximum size has been variously placed at fromWEIGHT OF THE BRAIN. 297 the 3d to the 8th years by different authors; but it con- tinues to increase in weight to 25 or 30, or even 40. After 60 the brain begins to diminish in weight; in aged males the average weight is about 45 oz., in females about 41 oz. In some cases the adult brain considerably exceeds the average weight. The brains of several men distinguished for their intellectual attainments have been weighed : the brain of Cuvier weighed 64J oz.; of Dr Abercrombie, 63 oz.; of ‘Professor Goodsir, 57J oz.; of Spurzheim, 55 oz.; of Sir J. Y. Simpson, 54 oz.; of Agassiz, 53‘4 oz.; and of Dr Chalmers, 53 oz. But high brain weights have also been found where there was no evidence of great intellectual capacity. Peacock weighed four male brains which ranged from 62-75 to 61 oz.; Boyd, a specimen of 60‘75 oz.; and I have in my possession one of a boy aged fifteen which weighed 60 oz. In the brains of the insane high brain weights have also been observed. Bucknill met with a brain in a male epileptic which weighed 64J oz.; Thurnam, one which weighed 62 oz.; and in the West Biding Asylum, out of 375 males examined, the weight of the brain in 30 cases was 55 oz. or upwards, and the highest weights were 61 oz. in a case of senile dementia, 60 £ oz. in a case of dementia, and 60 oz. in one of melancholia. No case has as yet been recorded of the weightlof the brain in a woman of great intellectual attainments; but Boyd met with a woman’s brain as high as 55-25 oz., and many instances of upwards of 50 oz. in women where there was no evidence of high mental endowment. Skae, in a female monomaniac, observed a brain which weighed 61J oz.; and of 300 females examined in the West Riding Asylum the weight of the brain in 26 cases was 50 oz. or upwards, the highestANATOMY. 298 weights being 56 and 55 oz. in two cases of mania. The size and weight of the brain do not therefore, per se, give an exact method of estimating the intellectual power of the individual, and a high brain weight and great intellectual capacity are not necessarily correlated with each other. It seems certain, if the adult human brain, even amongst the most uncultivated peoples, falls below 30 oz., that this low weight is not merely incompatible with intellectual power and activity, but is invariably associated with idiocy or imbecility; so that the human brain has a minimum weight below which intellectual action is impossible. Amongst the more cultivated races the minimum weight-limit of intelli- gence is, however, in all probability higher than 30 oz. It has been placed by Broca at 32 oz. for the female, and 37 oz. for the male brain; and Thurnam’s numbers are almost the same. To how low a weight the brain in the microcepha- lous idiot may fall is well shown in a case recorded by Theile, where it weighed only 10'6 oz., in Gore’s case of 10 oz. 5 grs., and in Marshall’s case, 8J oz. But instances are not wanting in which the brains of idiots have exceeded even 50 oz. Langdon Down observed the brain of a male idiot aged 22, which weighed 59^ oz.; and J. B. Tuke has recently met with a brain of 60 oz. in a male idiot aged 37, the capacity of whose cranium was 110J cubic inches.- In the West Riding Asylum tables the brain weights in 10 idiots were not less than 34 oz., and in 5 cases exceeded 40 oz. As yet the opportunities of weighing the brain in the coloured races of men have been but scanty. But from a very extensive series of observations made by Barnard Davis, not on the brains themselves, but on the cubic capacities of crania, from which an approximate estimate of the brainWEIGHT OF THE BRAIN. 299 weight may be obtained with a fair measure of accuracy, the following facts are derived:—The average weight of the male brain in the African races is 45'6 oz.; of the female brain, 42-7 oz. : the average weight of the male brain in the Australian races is 42-8 oz.; of the female brain, 39'2 oz.: the average weight of the male brain in the Oceanic races, 46’5 oz. ; of the female brain, 43 oz. The conclusions which may legitimately be drawn from an analysis of Barnard Davis’s observations are as follows :— 1st, That the average brain weight is considerably higher in the civilised European than in the savage races; 2d, That the range of variation is much greater in the former than in the latter; 3d, That there is an absence, almost complete, of specimens heavier than 54 oz. in the exotic races, so that the higher terms of the series are not repre- sented ; 4th, That though the male brains are heavier than the female, there is not the same amount of difference in the average brain weight between the two sexes in the uncultivated as in the cultivated peoples. No reliable determinations have as yet been made of the exact proportion, as regards bulk and weight, which the convolutions bear to the corpora striata, optic thalami, and corpora quadrigemina, but data are obtainable of the rela- tive weight of the pons, cerebellum, and medulla to the entire encephalon. Between the ages of 20 and 70 the ratio of weight of the pons, cerebellum; and medulla, to the entire brain, is as 1 to 7'9, or about 13 to 100, and this relative weight is virtually the same in both sexes. From Peacock’s observations the ratio of weight of the cerebel- lum alone to the entire encephalon is as 1 to 9, or about 11 to 100.ANATOMY. 300 Origin, Arrangement, and Distribution of the Encephalic Nerves. Several pairs of nerves, called Cranial or Encephalic, arise from the under surface or base of the encephalon and pass outwards through foramina situated in the floor of the cranial cavity. Continental anatomists usually enumerate twelve pairs of cranial nerves; but because in one locality two of these nerves lie together and pass through the same foramen, and in another spot three of these nerves emerge together from the skull, British anatomists have restricted the number to nine pairs. These nerves are numbered from before backwards, in the order in which they are seen at the base of the brain. The names applied to the individual nerves, and their numerical designations, according to both the Continental and British methods, are given in the following table :— Continental. British.

Third group.—Mixed nerves : a, trifacial, distributed to the muscles of mastication, the skin of the face, various mucous membranes, and to the anterior and lateral surfaces of the tongue, where it may play the part of a nerve of the special sense of taste; b, glosso-pharyngeal, distributed to the mucous membrane of the pharynx, to certain palato- pharyngeal muscles, and to the mucous membrane of the back of the tongue, where it acts as a nerve of the special sense of taste; c, the pneumogastric, conjoined with the internal division of the spinal accessory, is distributed to several muscles, mucous membranes, and internal organs. The consideration of the 1st group of cranial nerves may appropriately be deferred until the organs of sense, in which they terminate, are described. The anatomy of the Motor Nerves is as follows:— The Oculo-motor or third nerve springs out of the inner surface of the crus cerebri. When its fibres are traced into the crus, some are seen to pass to the nerve cells of the locus niger, whilst others sink into the corpora quadri- gemina, and extend as far as the Sylvian group of nerve cells. The nerve, after it has emerged from the crus, runs forwards in the outer wall of the cavernous sinus, and enters the orbit through the sphenoidal fissure. It supplies the levator palpebras superioris, the superior, in-THE ENCEPHALIC NERVES. 303 ferior, and internal recti muscles, and the inferior oblique. It contributes the short or motor root to the ciliary ganglion, and through it influences the iris and ciliary muscles within Fig. 95.—Floor of the cavity of the skull to show the places of exit of the nerves. 1 to 6, first to sixth cranial nerves ; 7, portio dura; 8, portio mollis; 9, glosso- pharyngeal; 10, pneumogastric; 11, spinal accessory; 12, hypo-glossal; 13, 14, 15, first, second, and third divisions of fifth nerve; 16, knee-shaped ganglion of portio dura; 17 and 18, great and small superficial petrosal nerves; a, occi- pital sinus; 6, superior longitudinal; c, torcular Herophili; d, lateral sinus; e, superior, and /, inferior petrosal sinus; g, transverse sinus; ft, cavernous sinus; i, circular sinus; l, pituitary body; m, middle meningeal artery; n,n, bones of the ear; o, o, internal carotid artery. the eyeball. It also communicates with the cavernous plexus of the sympathetic. The Trochlearis or fourth, the smallest cranial nerve,ANATOMY. 304 lies at the outer side of the crus cerebri and winds back- wards round the side of the superior peduncle of the cere- bellum. When traced to its origin it is seen to sink into the valve of Vieussens, where its fibres divide into three roots: one decussates across the valve with a root of the corresponding nerve on the opposite side; another passes backwards to the locus cseruleus; the third sinks into the corpora quadrigemina and reaches the Sylvian group of nerve cells, from which the third nerve also arises. The fourth nerve runs forward in the outer wall of the caver- nous sinus, passes into the orbit through the sphenoidal fissure, and enters the orbital surface of the superior oblique muscle. It also communicates with the cavernous plexus of the sympathetic. The Abducent or sixth nerve springs out of the groove between the lower border of the pons and the anterior pyramid of the medulla oblongata. Its roots sink deeply into the pons, and arise from a nucleus of grey matter at the floor of the fourth ventricle, common to it and the portio dura. The sixth nerve runs forward in the inner wall of the cavernous sinus in contact with the internal carotid artery, enters the orbit through the sphenoidal fissure, and ends in the external rectus muscle. It communicates with the carotid plexus of the sympathetic. The Portio dura or motor facial portion of the seventh nerve springs out of the groove between the lower border of the pons and the restiform body. Its roots sink deeply into the pons, and whilst some of its fibres arise from a grey nucleus, at the floor of the fourth ventricle, common to it and the sixth nerve, others ascend from a nucleus which, according to Meynert, lies just on the outer side ofENCEPHALIC NERVES. 305 the superior olivary body, and others again decussate across the median raphe of the pons. An accessory por- tion, called portio intermedia, which is said to arise from the lateral columns of the cord, joins the portio dura. The portio dura enters the internal auditory meatus in the petrous-temporal bone along with the auditory nerve; but at the bottom of the meatus it leaves that nerve and enters the aqueduct of Fallopius, along which it is conducted through the bone to emerge at the stylo-mastoid foramen. When in the aqueduct it forms a knee-shaped bend, and expands into a small ganglion, which is joined by the great, small, and external superficial petrosal nerves. Through the external petrosal it communicates with the sympathetic; through the great petrosal, which subse- quently forms a part of the vidian nerve, it communicates with Meckel’s ganglion on the 3d division of the 5th nerve, and through it supplies the levator palati and azygos uvulae; through the small petrosal it communicates with the otic ganglion and with the tympanic plexus of the glosso-pharyngeal nerve. The portio dura gives off—a, a minute branch to the stapedius muscle ; b, the chorda tympani, which, entering the tympanum, passes across that cavity, emerges through the Glaserian fissure, and joins the lingual branch of the fifth nerve, which it accompanies as far as the submaxillary ganglion; it gives a branch to the ganglion, and one to the lingualis muscle. After the portio dura has passed through the stylo-mastoid foramen it gives off—c, the posterior auricular branch to the occi- pital belly of the occipito-frontalis and to the retrahens aurem muscle, and d, the digastric branch to the posterior belly of the digastric and stylo-hyoid muscles; and then UANATOMY. 306 runs forwards through, the parotid gland to the face, where it divides into (e) temporo-facial and (/) cervico-facial branches to supply the facial muscles of expression, i.e., the muscles of the scalp and external ear, the orbiculai muscles of the eyelids, the muscles. which dilate and com- press the nostrils, the muscles which approximate and separate the lips, including the buccinator muscle, and also the platysma myoides. The facial is also the secretory nerve for the salivary glands. Through the chorda tym- pani it influences the secretion of the submaxillary and sublingual glands, and through the connection between its small petrosal nerve and the auriculo-temporal in the otic ganglion it influences the parotid gland. The Spinal Accessory is the lowest division of the eighth nerve. It springs out of the side of the medulla oblongata, and from the lateral column of the cervical part of the spinal cord as low as the fifth cervical nerve: its roots arise from the intermedio-lateral group of nerve cells in the cord, and from a nucleus of grey matter in the floor of the fourth ventricle. The spinal fibres of origin enter the skull through the foramen magnum, join the fibres from the medulla, and leave the cranial cavity through the jugular foramen. This nerve, purely motor in function, is sub- divided into two parts, an internal.and an external. The external passes obliquely outwards across the side of the neck, pierces the sterno-mastoid, forms a plexus of commu- nication with the third and fourth cervical nerves, and ends in the trapezius, both of which muscles it supplies. The internal joins the upper ganglion of the pneumogastnc nerve, of which it forms the motor or accessory root, and is distributed along with it.ENCEPHALIC NERVES. 307 The Hypoglossal or ninth nerve springs out of the groove between the anterior pyramid and olivary body of the medulla oblongata, in series with the anterior roots of the spinal nerves. Its roots pass through the medulla to the floor of the fourth ventricle, to arise from the nerve cells in two nuclei of grey matter situated close to the median furrow (fig. 80). This grey matter is in series with the anterior cornu of grey matter in the spinal cord. The nerve passes out of the skull through the anterior condyloid foramen, and arches across the side of the neck to the tongue, to end in glossal branches for the supply of the intrinsic and extrinsic muscles of the tongue. It also gives off—a, the descendens noni branch, which, after been joined by the communicantes noni from the cervical plexus, sup- plies the omo-hyoid, sterno-hyoid, and sterno-thyroid muscles; b, the thyro-hyoid branch to the thyro-hyoid muscle; c, the genio-hyoid branch to the genio-hyoid muscle. It communicates in the neck with the sympathetic, vagus, lingual branch of the fifth, and cervical plexus. The group of Mixed Nerves will now be considered. The Trifacial or fifth is the largest cranial nerve. It springs by two distinct roots out of the side of the pons. The smaller or motor root arises from the nerve cells of a nucleus of grey matter situated in the back of the pons, near the floor of the upper part of the fourth ventricle.5 The larger or sensory root has, according to Meynert, a complex origin—a, from a nucleus of grey matter in the pons to the outer side of the origin of the motor root; b, by descending fibres which arise from nerve cells in the substance of the corpora quadrigemina, from the grey matter of the locus cseruleus, and from the longitudinal /ANATOMY. 308 fibres of the pons ; c, by ascending fibres which apparently arise from the grey tubercle of Rolando; d, probably by fibres which traverse and embrace the superior peduncle of the cerebellum. As the large sensory root of the fifth lies on the petrous bone it expands into the Gasserian ganglion, which resembles in structure the ganglion on the posterior root of a spinal nerve. From this ganglion three large branches arise, named respectively the 1st, 2d, and 3d divisions of the ganglion (Fig. 95). The lsi or Ophthalmic division is the upper sensory nerve of the face, it lies in the outer wall of the cavernous sinus and divides into three branches, which pass out of the cra- nial cavity through the sphenoidal fissure, a, Its lachrymal branch supplies the lachrymal gland, and the outer part of the skin and conjunctiva of the upper eyelid, b, Its frontal branch divides into the supra-trochlear and supra-orbital; the supra-trochlear supplies the inner part of the skin and conjunctiva of the upper eyelid and eyebrow; the supra- orbital supplies the skin of the forehead and scalp as far back as the vertex, c, Its oculo-nasal branch gives long ciliary nerves to the eyeball, a nasal nerve to the mucous mem- brane of the nose, and to the skin of the side of the nose, and an infra-trochlear nerve to the conjunctiva and inte- gument of the eyelids. From the oculo-nasal nerve arises the long or sensory root of the small ciliary ganglion., which lies in the cavity of the orbit, and which receives also a motor root from the third nerve, and a root from the sympathetic. This ganglion gives origin to the short ciliary nerves for the eyeball. The 2d or Superior Maxillary division is the sensory nerve for the middle part of the face. It leaves the skull309 ENCEPHALIC NERVES. by the foramen rotundum, passes across the spheno-maxillary fissure, then lies in the canal in the floor of the orbit, from which it emerges on the face through the infra-orbital foramen as the infra-orbital nerve. It gives off—a, a small orbital branch which divides into a temporal branch for a small part of the skin of the temple, and a malar branch for the skin over the cheek bone; b, dental branches to the teeth in the upper jaw; c, palpebral branches to the skin and conjunctiva of the lower eye-lid; d, nasal branches to the skin and mucous membrane of the nose; e, labial branches to the skin and mucous membrane of the upper lip. It also gives off, when in the spheno-maxillary fossa—/, spheno- palatine branches, which form the sensory root of the spheno-palatine or Meckel's ganglion. This ganglion receives a motor root through the great petrosal nerve from the knee-shaped bend of the portio dura, and a sympathetic root from the carotid plexus, which runs along with the great petrosal, and forms with it the vidian nerve. The ganglion gives origin to—a, an orbital branch, which supplies a layer of non-striped muscular fibres, described by H. Muller and myself as developed in connection with the periosteum of the orbit, where it covers the spheno-maxillary fissure ; b, upper nasal and naso-palatine branches to the mucous membrane of the nose and hard palate; c, descend- ing palatine branches to the mucous membrane of the hard and soft palate, and to the levator palati and azygos uvulas; d, pterygo-palatine to the mucous membrane of the upper part of the pharnyx. The 3d or Inferior Maxillary division passes out of the skull through the foramen ovale, and as it does so is joined by the motor root of the 5th. By the junction a mixedANATOMY. 310 nerve is formed, which is the sensory nerve for the lower part of the face, and the skin of the temple, and the motor nerve for the muscles of mastication. Immediately after passing through the foramen this nerve divides into a small and large division, in each of which motor and sensory fibres are found. The small division supplies motor masticatory branches to the masseter, temporal, external and internal pterygoid muscles; but further it gives off a long buccal branch, which, though often described as the motor nerve for the buccinator muscle, is really a sensory nerve for the skin and mucous membrane of the cheek. The sensory nature of this nerve is proved, not only by physiological and pathological experiments, but by tracing its fibres through the buccinator muscle to the mucous membrane. I have also observed two cases in which the long buccal nerve arose as a branch of the sensory superior maxillary nerve. The large division separates into three branches—a, auriculo-temporal, which ascends to supply the parotid gland, the skin of the auricle, external meatus, and temple, and the temporo-maxillary joint; b, in- ferior dental, which enters the dental canal in the lower jaw, supplies the lower set of teeth, and, emerging through the mental foramen, supplies the skin and mucous membrane of the lower lip; the inferior dental also gives off a mylo-hyoid branch to the mylo-hyoid and anterior belly of the digas- tric muscle; c, lingual or gustatory, which runs forward along the side of the tongue to end in the filiform and fungiform papillae of its mucous membrane. The lingual branches are sensory nerves of touch, and many physiolo- gists believe that they are also nerves of taste. Connected with the branches of the inferior maxillary division are311 ENCEPHALIC NEEVES. two small ganglia, which, like the ciliary and spheno-pala- tine ganglia, are of a greyish colour, contain nerve cells, and receive roots from motor, sensory, and sympathetic nerves. The submaxillary ganglion lies under cover of the mylo-hyoid muscle, and receives a root from the motor chorda tympani nerve, a root from the sensory lingual, and a sympathetic root. It gives branches to the sub-maxillary and sublingual salivary glands. The otic ganglion lies close to the Eustachian tube, and receives a root from the mus- cular nerve to the internal pterygoid, a root from the sensory auriculo-temporal, and a sympathetic root. It also receives the small petrosal nerve, by which it is connected to the knee-shaped bend of the portio dura and to the glosso-pharyngeal nerve. It supplies the tensor tympani and tensor palati muscles. The branches of the three divi- sions of the fifth cranial nerve, which pass to the skin of the temple, forehead, and face, freely communicate with the branches of the portio dura, which supply the muscles situated in those regions. The Glossopharyngeal or uppermost division of the eighth nerve springs out of the side of the medulla oblongata between the olivary and restiform bodies; its roots arise from two small masses or nuclei of grey matter in the floor of the 4th ventricle (Fig. 80). The nerve passes out of the skull through the jugular foramen, where it possesses two small ganglia, named jugular and petrous. It then passes across the side of the neck and gives off carotid branches, which run along the internal carotid artery; pharyngeal branches to the mucous membrane of the phaiynx; tonsil- itic branches to the tonsil and soft palate; glossal branches to the base of the tongue and the circumvallate312 , ANATOMY. papillae, which branches are unquestionably nerves of the special sense of taste; muscular branches to the stylo- pliaryngeus and perhaps the constrictor muscles. Through the jugular and petrous ganglia the nerve communicates with the vagus and sympathetic. The petrous ganglion gives off the tympanic branch or nerve of Jacobson, which enters the tympanic cavity, supplies its mucous membrane, and gives off three communicating branches—one to the sympathetic; a second to the great petrosal, and through it to the knee-shaped bend of the facial; a third to the small petrosal, and through it to the otic ganglion. The Pneumogastric or Vagus, the middle division of the eighth cranial nerve, springs out of the side of the medulla oblongata, between the olivary and restiform bodies; its roots arise from a nucleus of grey matter in the floor of the 4th ventricle, which nucleus, along with these for the glesso-pharyngeal nerve, is in series with the posterior cornu of grey matter in the spinal cord. It goes through the jugular foramen, is joined by the inner divi- sion of the spinal accessory which is its motor root, then passes down the side of the neck, enters the thorax, inclines behind the root of the lung, reaches the outer wall of the oesophagus, accompanies that tube through the diaphragm, and terminates in the wall of the stomach. The left nerve lies on a plane anterior to the right: it crosses in front of the arch of the aorta, and is dis- tributed to the anterior wall of the stomach, whilst the right nerve supplies the posterior wall. Each nerve possesses high in the neck two enlargements, named upper and lower ganglia. The branches of the vagus are numerous and im- portant. The upper ganglion gives origin to the auricularSYMPATHETIC NERVOUS SYSTEM. 313 branch, which traversing a small canal in the petrous tempo- ral bone, is distributed to the skin of the back of the auricle. The lower ganglion ' gives origin to—a, the pharyngeal branch, which forms a plexus with the glosso-pharyngeal and sympathetic nerves, from which the muscles of the pharynx are supplied; h, the superior laryngeal, which divides into an external branch to supply the crico-thyroid muscle, and an internal, which pierces the thyro-hyoid mem- brane, and supplies the mucous lining of the larynx and the mucous covering of the epiglottis. The trunk of the nerve gives origin to—a, the recurrent laryngeal branch, which on the right side turns round the subclavian artery, and on the left round the arch of the aorta, and ascends to the larynx to supply its intrinsic muscles except the crico-thyroid; b, cardiac branches, which arise from the nerve partly in the neck and partly in the chest, and join the great cardiac plexus for the heart; c, pulmonary branches, which arise in the chest, pass into the substance of the lungs, and form along with the sympathetic an anterior pulmonary plexus in front of, and a posterior pulmonary plexus behind the root of the lung; d, oesophageal branches, which supply the coats of the oesophagus; e, gastric branches, which supply the coats of the stomach, and give important off- shoots to the great solar plexus of the sympathetic situated at the pit of the stomach. Descriptive Anatomy of the Sympathetic Nervous System. The Sympathetic Nervous System consists of a pair of gangliated cords, situated one on each side of the spinal314 ANATOMY. column ■ of three great gangliated prevertebral plexuses situated in the thoracic and abdominal cavities ; of nume- rous smaller ganglia lying more especially in relation with the thoracic and abdominal viscera ; of multitudes of fine communicating and distributory nerves. Each Gangliated Cord of the sympathetic extends along the side of the spine from the base of the skull to the coccyx. In the neck it lies in front of the transverse processes of the vertebrae; in the thorax, in front of the heads of the ribs; in the abdomen, on the sides of the verte- bral bodies; and as it descends in front of the sacrum it approaches its fellow, so that in front of the coccyx the two are united in a single ganglion, the ganglion impar (Fig. 77/c). Each cord consists of a number of ganglia united into a continuous cord by intermediate nerves. As a rule, the ganglia equal in number the vertebrae of the region. Thus, in the sacral region there are five ganglia, in the lumbar five, and in the thorax twelve; but in the neck there are only three, named superior, middle, and inferior; of these the superior is very large, and represents without doubt several smaller ganglia. From the superior cervical ganglion the cord is prolonged upwards by an ascending or cranial offshoot through the carotid canal into the cranial cavity, and forms a plexus around the internal carotid artery,both in the carotid canal, named the carotid plexus, and in the inner wall of the cavernous sinus, named the cavernous plexus. Through branches derived either directly or indirectly from these plexuses the sympathetic roots for the ciliary and spheno-palatine ganglia, described in connection with the fifth nerve, are derived. From the gangliated cord and its ascending or cranialSYMPATHETIC NERVOUS SYSTEM. 315 prolongation a communicating and a distributary series of branches are derived. By the Communicating branches this portion of the sympathetic is connected with most of the cranial and with the anterior divisions of all the spinal nerves, so as to bring the cerebro-spinal and sympathetic systems into close anatomical and physiological relation with each other. It is important also to observe that each communicating branch contains not only non-medullated nerve fibres from the sympathetic system to the cerebro-spinal nerves, but medullated fibres from the cerebro-spinal to the sympa- thetic, so that a double interchange takes place between the two systems. The superior cervical ganglion and its cranial prolongation communicate with the 3d and 4th nerves, with the Gasserian ganglion of the 5th, the 6th, the portio dura of the 7th, the glosso pharyngeal and pneumo- gastric of the 8th, with the 9th cranial nerve, and with the anterior divisions of the four upper cervical spinal nerves. The middle cervical ganglion communicates with the 5 th and 6th cervical nerves : the inferior cervical gan- glion with the 7th and 8th cervical nerves : the twelve thoracic ganglia with the series of intercostal nerves : the five lumbar ganglia with the series of lumbar spinal nerves : the sacral and coccygeal ganglia with the sacral nerves and the coccygeal nerve. The Distributory branches of the gangliated cord are as follows:—a, Pharyngeal branches from the superior cervical ganglion, which join the pharyngeal branches of the glosso- pharyngeal and pneumogastric nerves, to form the 'pharyn- geal plexus, which supplies the muscles and mucous membrane of the pharynx, b, Articular branches from the316 ANATOMY. upper thoracic and the lumbar ganglia to the articulations between the adjacent vertebrae, c, Pulmonary branches from the 3d or 4th thoracic ganglia, which join the posterior pulmonary plexus, d, Vaso-motor branches or nervi molles, which supply the muscular coat of the arteries : those which arise from the cranial prolongation of the superior cervical ganglion supply the internal carotid artery and its branches to the brain and eyeball: those which arise from the superior cervical ganglion itself supply the external carotid artery and its branches; from the branch accompanying the facial artery the submaxilliary ganglion derives its sympathetic root; from that accompanying the middle meningeal artery the otic ganglion derives its sympathetic root : the vaso-motor nerves which arise from the middle cervical ganglion supply the inferior thyroid artery, and pass to the thyroid gland: the vaso-motor branches of the inferior cervical ganglion supply the vertebral and basilar arteries and their several branches, which pass to the spinal cord and the hinder part of the encephalon. Yaso-motor nerves also arise from the thoracic ganglia, which pass to the thoracic aorta, from the lumbar ganglia to the abdominal aorta, and from the sacral ganglia to the middle sacral artery; the ganglion impar gives branches to a peculiar vascular struc- ture, named the coccygeal body, developed in connection with the end of the middle sacral artery ; a body of similar structure, called intercarotic body, situated in the angle of bifurcation of the common carotid artery, receives branches from the superior cervical ganglion, e, Cardiac branches from the superior, middle, and inferior cervical and the 1st thoracic ganglia, which pass into the thorax to join the pre- vertebral cardiac plexus. /, Splanchnic branches as follows:SYMPATHETIC NERVOUS SYSTEM. 317 great splanchnic nerve, .by the union of branches from the thoracic ganglia, the 3d to the 10th inclusive; it pierces the crus of the diaphragm, and passes to the prevertebral solar plexus; small splanchnic nerve, also to the solar plexus from the 10th or 11th thoracic ganglia • smallest splanchnic nerve, from the 12th thoracic ganglion to the renal plexus. g, Hypogastric branches, from the lumbar and sacral ganglia to the prevertebral hypogastric plexus. The Prevertebral Cardiac plexus is situated at the base of the heart, and is divided into a superficial part, which lies in the concavity of the arch of the aorta, and a deep part between the aorta and trachea. It receives the cardiac branches of the pneumogastric and the cervical ganglia of the sympathetic. It contains collections of nerve cells and a dense plexiform arrangement of nerve fibres. It gives off branches to the heart, which wind around the surface of that organ and penetrate its muscular substance: on these branches minute ganglia are found which regulate its rhythmical movements. Through these branches and the cardiac plexus the heart is brought into connection with both the cerebro-spinal and sympathetic systems of nerves. The sympathetic apparently regulates its contraction, for when this nerve is stimulated the action of the heart is accelerated. The pneumogastric again exer- cises an inhibitory or restraining influence on the contrac- tions of the organ, for when this nerve is irritated the activity of contraction is diminished, but when divided it is greatly increased. The cardiac plexus also sends offsets to the anterior and posterior pulmonary plexuses for the supply of nerves to the lungs. The Prevertebral Solar or Epigastric plexus is situated atANATOMY. 318 the pit of the stomach around the coeliac axis, a branch of the abdominal aorta. It receives the great and small splanchnic nerves from the thoracic ganglia of the sympa- thetic, and some of the terminal branches of the pneumo- gastric nerve. It contains large collections of nerve cells, which form the two semilunar ganglia, and a dense plexi- form arrangement of nerve fibres. It gives origin, either directly or indirectly, to numerous plexiform branches, which accompany, and are named after, the abdominal aorta and its various branches given off to the walls and viscera of the abdomen proper. In this manner, not only do the arteries which supply the abdominal viscera receive their vaso-motor nerves, but the muscular and mucous coats of the stomach, intestines, gall bladder, bile ducts, ureters, and seminal ducts, and the glandular structures of the liver, pancreas, kidneys, spleen, testes, and supra-renal capsules. It is important also to observe that these plexuses of distribution not unfrequently contain small ganglia, and the branches which supply the muscular coat of the stomach and intestines have minute microscopic ganglia, with stellate nerve cells lying amidst them. The distribu- tion of the pneumogastric nerve to the stomach, and its connection with the solar plexus, enables that nerve to stimulate its peristaltic contraction, and, according to some experimenters, that of the small intestine also; but the precise action of the sympathetic on these organs is still a disputed question, though some physiologists hold that it is the inhibitory nerve for those organs. The Prevertebral Hypogastric plexus is situated in front of the last lumbar vertebra. It receives branches from the lumbar ganglia of the sympathetic, and from the plexus319 SYMPATHETIC NERVOUS SYSTEM. surrounding the abdominal aorta.. It divides into two parts, which lie one on each side of the rectum, and are' called the pelvic plexuses ; these plexuses are joined by branches from the sacral ganglia of the sympathetic, and from the 3d and 4th sacral spinal nerves, and contain small gangliform collections of nerve cells. From the pelvic plexuses numerous plexiform nerves arise, which accompany the internal iliac artery and its branches to the walls and viscera of the pelvis, and are named after them. These nerves not only supply the vaso-motor nerves for these blood-vessels, but also the muscular coat and mucous membrane of the bladder, rectum, and urethra, besides the prostate gland in the male, and the uterus and vagina, and in part the ovary, in the female; in connection with their distribution to these viscera, minute ganglia are found lying amidst the nerves, the nerve cells in which act undoubtedly as centres of reinforcement for the origin of additional nerve fibres. From the distribution of the branches of the gangliated cord of the sympathetic, and of the gangliated prevertebral plexuses, it will be seen that this nerve is especially asso- ciated with the blood-vessels and the thoracic and abdo- minal viscera. As the cerebro-spinal system is engaged in the supply of nerves to the voluntary muscles, the sympa- thetic is the medium of supply for the involuntary mus- cular apparatus, both in the coats of the vessels and in the walls of the hollow viscera. But though the vaso-motor nerves branch off from the sympathetic ganglia, it must not be supposed that they have no connection with the cerebro-spinal system. The communicating branches be- tween the sympathetic ganglia and the anterior divisionsANATOMY. 320 of tlie spinal nerves establish a connection between them and the cerebro-spinal nervous axis. By recent experi- ments, the tract of transmission of the vaso-motor fibres has been traced along with the anterior roots of the spinal nerves, through the lateral columns of the cord to the medulla oblongata, in which the vaso-motor nerve centre lies a little to one side of the mesial plane, above the calamus scriptorius.1 In the distribution of the sympa- thetic to the glandular viscera, not only is it important to attend to their terminations in the muscular coat of the blood-vessels of the glands, but the termination of the nerves in connection with the secreting cells them- selves must be taken into consideration. The communi- cations between the cerebro-spinal and sympathetic systems, not only through the spinal nerves, but also through the pneumogastric, are to be kept in mind in considering the effects produced by varying mental conditions on the secretions of the glands. i C. Dittmar, by carefully devised experiments performed on rabbits, has localised the vaso-motor centre in the medulla oblongata in a spot about 3 millimetres above the point of the calamus scrip- torius, 1 to 1J mm. ('04 to '06 inch) below the lower margin of the tuberculum laterale. Yulpian, however, from his experiments con- siders that the vaso-motor centre is not limited to the medulla oblon- gata, but that numerous centra are seated in the grey substance of the spinal cord.CHAPTER VI. ORGANS OF SENSE. The organs of sense are the organs through the interme- diation of which the mind becomes cognisant of the appear- ance and properties of the various objects in the external world. These organs are severally named nose, eye, ear, tongue, and skin. For the excitation and perception of a sensation three sets of structures are necessary: a, a peripheral end-organ • b, a sensory nerve; c, a central organ. The peripheral end-organ is the part of the appa- ratus to which the stimulus necessary for the production of the sensation is applied. This stimulus causes nervous impulses to be propagated from the end-organ along the fibres of the sensory nerve to the central organ, in which that nerve terminates at its central extremity. These ner- vous impulses occasion molecular changes in the nerve cells of the bram, and the mind becomes conscious of a sensation. The shape and construction of each organ of sense is adapted to the application of the stimulus required for the produc tion of the particular sensation to which the organ is sub- servient. Each organ of sense possesses its own character- istic form of end-organ. The touch corpuscles of the skin, the end bulbs found in several mucous membranes, and the. Pacinian corpuscles, are the end-organs occurring in their several localities; the peripheral ends of the sen- X322 ANATOMY. sory nerves pass into their substance, and the axial cylin- der of the nerve fibre ends in tbeir interior. Tbe rods and cones of tbe retina, tbe rods of Corti in the cochlea, tbe olfactory cells of tbe nose, and tbe gustatory bodies in tbe tongue, are tbe end-organs belonging to tbeir several organs of sense; tbe sensory nerve fibres which termi- nate in relation with them have not yet, however, been traced into actual continuity with tbeir substance. A stimulus, whatever may be its nature, applied to any organ of sense can excite only that kind of sensation for tbe production of which tbe organ is subservient. Thus a stimulus applied to tbe eye, whether it be tbe natural stimulus of tbe waves of light, tbe mechanical stimulus of a blow, or an electric stimulus, can only excite tbe sensation of light. Stimuli applied to tbe ear can only excite tbe sensation of sound, and in like manner with tbe other senses. In studying tbe anatomy of tbe organs of sense tbe arrangement of numerous accessory structures, which assist either in conducting stimuli or in modifying tbeir effects, tbe arrangement and structure of tbe peripheral end-organs, and tbe origin, course, and distribution of tbe sensory nerves, will have to be considered. The Nose. Tbe Nose or organ of smell is a large cavity situated in tbe face, between tbe orbits, above tbe mouth, and below tbe cribriform plate of tbe ethmoid bone. It communicates by tbe anterior nares, or nostrils, with tbe external atmos- phere, by tbe posterior nares with tbe pharynx, and through it with the larynx, trachea, and lungs. It is the proper323 THE NOSE. entrance to the respiratory passage, is accessory to the pro- duction of the voice, aids in the sense of taste, and forms one of the most important features of the face. It is sub- divided into a right and a left chamber by a vertical mesial partition, the septum nasi, so that the nose is a double organ in the same sense as the eyes or ears are double. The walls of the cavity of the nose are formed partly of bone and partly of cartilage. The osseous walls are referred to on page 34. The cartilages form the point, the alse, and a part of the septum nasi. The mesial or septal cartilage is triangular in shape, and fits into the interval between the vomer, the mesial plate of the ethmoid, and the nasal spine of the superior maxilla (Fig. 7). Anteriorly and interiorly its border is free, projects on to the face, and forms the columna of the nose. The lateral cartilages form the tip and alse. On each side is ap upper lateral cartilage attached by its outer margin to the free edge of the nasal bone and superior maxilla, whilst by its inner it is continuous with the anterior border of the septal cartilage. The lower lateral cartilage curves inwards upon itself, touches its fellow in the mesial plane at the tip, and forms the anterior and lateral boundary of the orifice of the nostril. It is con- nected by fibrous membrane above to the upper lateral cartilage, and behind to the anterior edge of the superior maxilla. In this membrane two to five small cartilaginous plates, called the epactal cartilages, are often found imbedded. The skin of the nose which covers the lower lateral cartilages contains numerous sebaceous follicles, which open by comparatively large orifices on the surface! It is closely connected to these cartilages, and to the muscles of the al*. The lower lateral cartilage forms theANATOMY. 324 wall of the vestibule or entrance to the nasal chamber, and the vestibule is lined by a prolongation of the integument, which is studded with numerous short hairs or vibrissoe. Each nasal chamber is lined by a mucous membrane called the pituitary or Schneiderian membrane, which is pro- longed into the meatuses and the air sinuses opening into them; posteriorly it is continuous with the mucous lining of the pharynx, and anteriorly it blends with the cutaneous lining of the vestibule. The pituitary membrane is thick and soft, and diminishes the size of the meatuses and the openings of the air sinuses as seen in the skeleton. The mucous membrane is divided into a respiratory and an olfactory region. The respiratory region corresponds to the floor of the nose, to the inferior turbinated bone, and to the lower third of the nasal septum. It is covered by a ciliated columnar epithelium, and contains numerous race- mose glands for the secretion of mucus or pituita. It is also vascular, and the veins which ramify in it have a plexiform arrangement. The mucous lining of the air sinuses is also ciliated, but almost devoid of glands, except in the antrum, in which region the glands sometimes dilate into cystic tumours. The olfactory region is the seat of distribution of the olfactory nerve and of its peripheral end-organs. It corre- sponds to the roof of the nose, to the superior and middle turbinals, and the upper grds of the septum. The mucous membrane is thick, soft, easily destroyed, of a yellowish brown colour, and blended with the periosteum. IV hen vertical sections through this membrane are examined microscopically the tubular glands discovered by Bowman may be seen in its vascular connective tissue layer. These325 THE NOSE. 1 glands contain roundish, secreting cells with yellowish- brown pigment-stained contents. The epithelium is cylin- drical, but not usually ciliated, though patches of ciliated epithelium cells are said to occur c I ' | K in man. Long, slender, and even branched processes proceed from the deeper end of each cell towards or even into the sub-epi- thelial connective tissue. The cells usually contain pigment granules. Between the epithe- lium cells the characteristic olfactory cells of Schultze are situated. Each olfactory cell (Fig. 96) consists of a globular or fusiform body, from which two long processes arise : one, the 'peripheral process, passes vertically between the adjacent cylindrical epithelium cells to the free surface of the mucous membrane: in amphibia, reptiles, and birds it projects beyond the plane through the f ,i -,r I- , , . ... olfactory mu- ot tne epithelium as a simple hair-hke struc- cous mem- brane. e, epi- ture, or subdivided into several slender “ olfac- theiium ceil; , , J o, olfactory tory hairs;” in fish and mammals, man in- ceil; c, its peri- pheral ; and p, elusive, it ends, without forming a hair-hke its central va- ° ncose process prolongation, on the general plane of the (After Schullze- mucous surface. The second or central process of the olfac- tory cell extends towards the sub-epithelial connective tissue : it is finer than the peripheral process, and has not unfrequently a varicose appearance like a nerve fibre. In the description of the development of the brain (p. 214), the origin of the olfactory bulb and peduncle from the hemisphere vesicle was referred to. In the adult brain the olfactory peduncle is in contact with the under surface of the frontal lobe (Fig. 94). It is a white band, which divides326 ANATOMY. in front of the locus perforatus anticus into the three so- called roots of the olfactory nerve. The external or lemsj root passes outwards across the Sylvian fissure to the gyrus hippocampi, and perhaps also to the insula: a few fibres are continuous with the anterior commissure; but in those mammals, in which the olfactory peduncle forms a good- sized lobe, it receives many fibres from the commissure. The middle or grey root contains white fibres which proceed from the corpus striatum. The internal or short root has been traced into the anterior end of the gyrus fornicatus; hence the inner and outer roots of the olfactory pedunele are connected with the anterior and posterior extremities of the arch-shaped gyrus. The olfactory bulbs rest on the upper surface of the cribri- form plate of the ethmoid, one on each side of the crista galli. Each bulb consists both of grey and white matter, and sometimes retains the central cavity lined by a ciliated epithelium. The grey matter contains fusi- form and pyramidal nerve cells imbedded in neuroglia (the stratum gelatinosum of L. Clarke). Between it and the central cavity is the white matter formed of nerve fibres interspersed with “ granules,” similar to those seen in the rust coloured layer of the cerebellum. Between the grey matter and the surface is the stratum glomerulosum of Meynert, which apparently consists of coils of the olfactory nerve fibres with interspersed “ granules. ” The olfactory nerve fibres form the first pair of cranial nerves or nerves of smell; they leave these glomeruli in from 15 to 25 bundles, and enter the roof of the nose through the holes in the cribriform plate; they lie in grooves in the bones of the olfactory region, and form a network from which327 THE NOSE. bundles of fine non-medullated fibres arise that enter the raucous membrane and run between the glands into the epithelial layer. These nerves have a varicose appearance, and though their terminations have not been precisely ascertained, it is believed that they are connected with the varicose central processes of the olfactory cells, which cells are therefore regarded as the peripheral end-organs of the olfactory nerve fibres. The mucous membrane of the nose also receives branches from the 1st and 2d divisions of the 5th cranial nerve. Their mode of termination in that membrane is not known, but they are associated with the sense of touch, and not with the special sense of smell. The nose appears on the face of the embryo in the form of two little depressions in the epiblast, the nasal pits, one on each side of the mesial plane. Each pit is superficial to the olfactory bulb prolonged forward from the corre- sponding hemisphere vesicle, and lies between the fronto- nasal process and the maxillary process in the embryo head. At first the rudimentary nasal chambers freely communicate with the cavity of the mouth; but by the growth inwards to the mesial line of the palate of the palatal processes of the superior maxillary lobes, the cavity of the mouth is shut off from the nose, except where the incisive canals remain pervious in the anterior part of the upper jaw bones. As the nasal pits are lined by an involution of the epiblast, the epithelial lining of the nose, including the olfactory cells, is derived from the epiblast cells. The osseo-cartilaginous framework of the nose is produced by a differentiation of the mesoblast, and in all probability the olfactory nerve fibres distributed to the mucous membrane are also derived from the mesoblast.ANATOMY. 328 The Eyeball. The Eyeball, globe or apple of the eye, or organ of % ision, is a complex optical apparatus situated, in the cavity of the orbit, imbedded to a large extent in loose fat, and with several muscles attached to it. Its form.approximates to the spheroidal, but it actually, .'consists of segments of two spheres, the posterior of which is the larger. The eyeball consists of three coats or tunics, which enclose three translucent refracting media.

Piercing the sclerotic coat is the optic nerve, which enters the globe about -j|th inch to the nasal or inner side of its antero- posterior axis. The second or middle coat, or tunica vasculosa, consists of a posterior part or choroid, the area of which corresponds almost exactly with the sclerotic; this coat possesses anteriorly numerous folds, the ciliary processes, which are continuous with the iris, a structure which lies behind the cornea. The third or internal or nervous coat is named the retina, and in it the optic nerve terminates. The enclosed refracting media occupy the axis of the globe, and are named from before backwards the aqueous humour, crystalline lens, and vitreous body. THE EXTERNAL OR FIBROUS TUNIC. The Sclerotic coat, called from its white appearance the white of the eye, is a firm, unyielding fibrous membrane, which forms the posterior fths of the outer coat of the eyeball. It is thicker behind than in front, and where pierced by the optic nerve it has a cribriform structure, as the bundles of nerve fibres do not pass through one large, but several small openings. The sclerotic consists of the white fibrous form of connective tissue, intermingled with a small proportion of elastic fibres. The bundles of white fibres lie in two directions; some pass in the meridian of the globe from the optic nerve towards the cornea, others lie parallel to its equator. The sclerotic is joined by accessory fibres behind, derived from the perineurium of330 ANATOMY. the optic nerve, where the nerve pierces it; and in front from the tendons of the recti and obliqui muscles, which are inserted into it. In the cetacea the sclerotic possesses extra- ordinary thickness. In fish and amphibia it consists largely of cartilage, and in birds a ring of bone is developed around its anterior margin. It is the protecting coat of the eyeball. The Cornea forms the translucent anterior ^th of the outer coat of the eyeball. It is almost circular in form, and is blended at its circumference^'with the anterior border of the sclerotic. Its anterior surface is convex, and covered by the conjunctival epithelium. The forward projection of the cornea is always greater in young than in aged persons. Its posterior surface is concave, and bounds the chamber in which the aqueous humour is contained: if the chamber be punctured, and the humour evacuated, the cornea loses its translucency, tension, and forward con- vexity, and becomes flaccid and opaque. It has considerable thickness, and can be readily split up into laminae. When antero-posterior sections are made through it and the epithelium on its anterior and posterior surfaces, four distinct series of structures may be seen, viz., the anterior epithelium, the proper tissue of the cornea, the posterior elastic lamina, and the posterior epithelium. The anterior epithelium of the cornea, often called the con- junctival epithelium, is stratified. The deepest layer, which lies next the cornea, is formed of elongated cells, placed vertically to the plane of the surface of the cornea. The more superficial layers are squamous cells, often w ith ilutcd surfaces and serrated or spinous edges. The intermediate layers are irregular in shape, and often possess, as ClelandTHE EYEBALL. 331 pointed out, long digitate processes, which interlock witn those of the adjacent cells. The proper tissue of the cornea is a modified form of connective tissue. When examined fresh it appears as if perfectly homogeneous, but after a time, and more espe- cially if hardened in alcohol, chloride of gold, and other reagents, it is seen to consist of cells and an intercellular matrix. The cells consist of two kinds, — those which belong to the cornea, and those Fig. 98.—Stellate cell from the centre of the which have migrated cornea of an ox. (From Thin}) into it. The proper cornea cells or cornea corpuscles were first seen by Toynbee, and have been carefully studied by numerous subsequent observers. They are large stellate, flattened cells, and lie with their surfaces parallel to the sur- faces of the cornea; they possess branching thread-like pro- cesses, and the processes of adjacent cells anastomose to form a cell network (Fig. 98). They consist of nucleated masses of protoplasm, which Kiihne showed to be contractile, and are apparently destitute of a cell wall. In vertical sections through the cornea the corpuscles seem as if shaped like elongated spindles. The migrating cells of the cornea were first seen by von Recklinghausen. They resemble white blood corpuscles, and possess active amoeboid movements, so that they can wander through the corneal tissue. In a healthy cornea they have migrated out of the marginal blood-vessels; but in an inflamed cornea, where their num- ber is greatly increased, they are in part white corpuscles332 ANATOMY. derived from the blood, and in part produced by prolifera- tion of the proper cornea corpuscles. The intercellular matrix of the cornea consists of a laminated substance, the lamellae being arranged parallel to the surfaces of the cornea. The lamellae consist of extremely delicate filaments, collected into bundles, which are invested, according to Thin, by flattened cells, like the cellular investment c of the bundles of a tendon. Im- mediately under the anterior epithelium the fasciculi decus- sate with each other, and at the circum- ference of the cor- nea the fasciculi run into the connective tissue of the sclero- tic.

(From Thin.) doubtful if this layer exists as a constant arrangement. Bowman and other observers have injected tubular spaces in the cornea which are apparently situated between the lamellae. The exact nature of these spaces is somewhat doubtful, butTHE EYEBALL. 333 Thin believes them to be lymph-vessels traversing its substance, for he has seen a lining of flat cells similar to the endothelial cells lining the lymphatics (Fig. 99). It is probable that these spaces serve as the chan- nels for the migrating corpuscles to wander through. Thin also describes the proper cornea corpuscles as lying in lacunae, lined by flat cells, which communicate with each other and with the lymph-vessels. The 'posterior elastic lamina forms a distinct, translucent, structureless layer adherent to the back of the proper tissue of the cornea, from which it may be stripped off without much difficulty. When torn across, the edges curl inwards towards the corneal tissue. It is from -^-qVo 3uVtt th inch thick, and resists the action of various reagents. This lamina thins off at its circumference and splits into fibres, which become continuous with the pectinate ligament of the iris. The posterior epithelium of the cornea, also called the epithelium of the aqueous humour, forms a single layer of polygonal cells on the back of the posterior elastic lamina. It is continuous with the epithelial covering of the pectinate ligament and of the anterior surface of the iris. The cornea is not in the adult traversed by blood-vessels, though in the fcetus a layer of capillaries lies near its anterior surface. In the adult, however, the margin of the cornea is penetrated by a zone of capillary loops derived from the arteries of the conjunctiva ; these loops, according to Lightbody, are invested by perivascular lymph spaces. The venous canal of Schlemm runs round the circumference of the cornea, at the junction of its deeper layers with the sclerotic. Leber states that it is not a simple canal, but a plexiform arrangement of veins. The nerves of the334 ANATOMY. cornea first seen by Schlemm have been carefully examined by recent observers. They arise from the ciliary nerves, g and enter tbe margin of tbe cornea in from twenty to forty fasciculi, which run from the circumfer- ence to the centre and to the anterior surface of the cornea, and give off nu- merous branches. Thin states that the nerves lie free in the lymph spaces and canals, and that be- tween them and the flat cells fining the canals is Fig. 100.—Cornea trented with nitrate of the fluid-filled Space in silver and chloride of gold; 2, anastomosis between two cornea corpuscles; k, stellate WHICH tile migrating COF- cornea corpuscle; g, nerve fibre lying in a lymphatic canaL (From Thin.) pilSCleS Can Wander. Tile nerve fibres soon lose their medullary sheath, and branch; adjacent branches then communicate, and form plexuses which possess nuclei at the points of intersection of the nerves. From these plexuses delicate branches again arise, some of which penetrate between the cells of the anterior epithelium, whilst others end in the proper tissue of the cornea. Kiihne stated that the terminal fibres ended in the cornea corpuscles, but this statement has not been confirmed.335 THE EYEBALL. THE MIDDLE OH VASCULAR TUNIC. The Choroid coat forms the largest portion of the middle coat of the eyeball. It lies immediately internal to the sclerotic, and extends as far forward as the corpus ciliare, or annulus albidus, where it forms the ciliary processes; it is pierced posteriorly by the optic nerve. It has a deep black colour, from the numerous pigment cells it contains, and is abundantly provided with blood-vessels and nerves. The Corpus ciliare, or annulus albidus, is a greyish-white ring which surrounds the anterior border of the choroid close to the junction of the sclerotic and cornea. It consists of two portions—an external, the ciliary muscle, which lies next the sclerotic, and an internal, the ciliary processes. The ciliary processes, about 80 in number, are folds of the middle tunic separated from each other by furrows which extend forwards in the meridional direction as far as the iris, and form collectively a zone-like plated frill around the circumference of the iris. On the one hand, they are continuous with the vasculo-pigmentary structures of the choroid; on the other, with the vasculo-pigmentary struc- tures of the iris. The Iris is a circular, flattened disc-shaped diaphragm, situated behind the cornea, in front of the crystalline lens, and bathed by the aqueous humour. By its circumference or ciliary border the iris is not only continuous with the ciliary processes, but is connected by fibres, termed ligamentum pectinatum, with the posterior elastic lamina of the cornea. The iris is the structure which gives the characteristic colour to the eye—blue, grey, brown, hazel, as the case may be. It is perforated at, or immediately toANATOMY. 336 the inner side of, its centre by a circular aperture, the pupil, the size of which is regulated by the contraction or relaxation of the muscular tissue of the iris. The structure of the several divisions of the middle coat will now be considered. The Choroid coat has its inner or anterior surface formed by a distinct pigmentary layer of hexagonal pigment cells (Fig. 45). In the eyes of Albinos, though the cells are present, they contain no pigment. In many mammals also, the pigment is absent from the inner surface, so that the choroid possesses a beautiful iridescent lustre, the tapetum lucidum. In ruminant animals and in the horse the irides- cence is due to the reflection of the light by the bundles of the connective tissue stroma, but in cats and other carnivora the prismatic colours are due to the reflection of the light from polygonal nucleated cells, which Schultze states con- tain double refracting crystals. Next the inner pigmen- tary layer is the lamina vitrea, the elastic layer of Kolliker. It forms a translucent membrane, described by some as structureless, but by Kolliker as faintly fibrous, which is intimately connected with the stroma of the choroid. The stroma consists of a plexiform arrangement of bundles of connective tissue, in the intervals between which nume- rous stellate pigment cells are situated, which give to the entire thickness of the choroid its black appearance. This stroma connects the outer surface of the choroid with the inner surface of the sclerotic, and forms the lamina fusca. Ramifying in the stroma are the blood-vessels and nerves. The vessels of the choroid are arranged in two layers. Next the lamina vitrea is a plexiform capillary layer, the meshes of which are so minute, and the vessels so compacted to-THE EYEBALL. 337 gether,as to give the appearance of avascular membrane, long known as the membrana Ruyscliiana. The capillaries radi- ate like minute stars from the terminal twigs of the choroidal arteries and veins. The choroidal arteries and veins form a layer external to the capillaries, i.e., next the lamina fusca. The arteries are the short posterior ciliary branches of the ophthalmic artery, which pierce the sclerotic close to the entrance of the optic nerve, and, running forwards in a tor- tuous manner, divide dichotomously before ending in the capillaries. The veins of the choroid are arranged in a series of remarkable whorls, named the venae vorticosce, which receive the blood not only from the capillaries of the choroid proper, but from those of the iris and ciliary body j they discharge their blood by means of from 4 to 6 veins into the ophthalmic vein. The ciliary muscle is the greyish white structure which forms the outer part of the ciliary body. It was at one time called the ciliary ligament, but its muscular nature was discovered almost simultaneously by Bowman and Briicke. It consists of smooth involuntary muscle, the fibres of which are arranged in two layers. The outer and thicker part of the muscle consists of fasci- culi, which arise close to the canal of Schlemm, i.e., opposite the junction of the sclerotic and cornea, and radiate from before backwards in the meridian of the eyeball, between the ciliary processes and the sclerotic. The inner part of the muscle forms a ring-like arrangement of fasciculi close to the circumference of the iris, and is often called the annular muscle of Muller. Iwanoff has shown that in long-sighted persons (hypermetropic) the annular muscle is strongly developed; whilst in short-sighted (myopic) eyes its fasciculi are very feeble. The Ciliary Processes YANATOMY. 338 liave on their inner surface a black pigmentary layer of cells continuous with that of the choroid. The vitreous layer is also present, but according to H. Muller is no longer smooth but reticulated. The stroma does not con- tain so large a proportion of stellate pigment cells as in the choroid. The arteries have been carefully studied by Leber; they are the long posterior ciliary branches of the ophthalmic, and the anterior ciliary branches of the muscu- lar branches of the ophthalmic. They pierce the sclerotic, run forwards, and at the anterior border of the ciliary muscle form by their anastomoses the circuhis arteriosus, which gives origin to the arteries for the ciliary processes and the iris. The arteries for the ciliary processes are short, and divide into tortuous branches, which frequently anastomose, and form highly complex vascular plexuses, from which arise veins that join the venae vorticosae. Before the long ciliary arteries contribute to the formation of the arterial circle they send branches to the ciliary muscle, and recurrent branches to the anterior part of the proper choroid coat. The iris has its anterior surface covered by a layer of cells continuous with the epithelium of the aqueous humour. This layer is continuous at the pupillary border with a thick layer of cells filled with black pigment granules, the uvea, which covers the posterior surface of the iris, and at its ciliary border is continuous with the pigmentary layer of the ciliary processes. The connective tissue stroma ot the iris also contains stellate pigment cells. The variations in colour of the iris in different eyes depend upon the dis- tribution and amount of the pigment in the uvea and the stellate cells: in dark-coloured eyes, both are filled withTHE EYEBALL. 339 dark pigment granules; whilst in light-coloured eyes the stellate cells of the stroma are either devoid of pigment or only faintly coloured. The iris contains numerous fasciculi of involuntary or non-striped muscular fibre arranged in two directions. Circularly arranged fibres surround the aperture of the pupil, and form the sphincter muscle, by the contraction of which the size of the pupil is diminished. Smooth muscular fibres also radiate from the pupillary to the ciliary border of the iris and form the dilatator muscle. The muscular nature of these fibres in the human iris was long disputed, but was satisfactorily demonstrated in 1852 by Lister. Jeropheef has also described circular fasciculi surrounding the ciliary border. In birds and reptiles the muscular tissue of the iris consists of transversely striped fibres. The arteries of the iris arise from the circulus arteriosus, and run radially forwards towards the pupil, where they anastomose and form the circulus iridis minor. They possess relatively thick external and muscular coats. The capillaries form a plexus not so compact as that of the choroid coat. The veins of the iris end in the venas vorti- cose. In the foetus the pupil is closed in by a delicate membrane, membrana pupillaris, into which the blood- vessels of the iris are prolonged. This membrane disap- pears by absorption during the later months of embryo life. The nerves of the middle coat of the eyeball are the long ciliary branches of the ophthalmic division of the 5th and the short ciliary branches of the ciliary ganglion. They pierce the sclerotic near the optic nerve, and run forward in the lamina fusca of the choroid. They give off branches to the choroid which form in it a plexus in which H. Miiller found nerve cells. From this plexusANATOMY. 340 delicate branches pass to the muscular coat of the choroidal arteries. The ciliary nerves then enter the ciliary muscle, and form plexuses with interspersed nerve cells, from which branches pass to the muscular fibres. Other branches of the ciliary nerves enter the iris, and form plexuses, from which branches proceed to the muscular tissue. THE INNER OR NERVOUS TUNIC. The Retina is the delicate nervous coat of the eyeball which lies immediately internal to the choroid, and extends Fig. 101.—Diagrammatic antero-posterior section through the retina to show the several layers which are numbered as in the text. Ct. the radial fibres of the supporting connective tissue. (Modified from. SchuUze.) from the place of entrance of the optic nerve as far forward as the ciliary processes, where it forms a jagged border, the ora serrata. In the living eye it is translucent and colour- less, but shortly after death it becomes grey : it is soft and so easily torn that it is difficult to display it in a dissection without injury. Its inner or anterior surface, concave forwards, is moulded on the vitreous body, and presents the following appearances :—Almost exactly in the antero- posterior axis of the eyeball is a transversely oval yellow spot, about TjJjjth inch in its long diameter, which amongst mammals is found only in man and apes, though, as Knox and Ilulke have shown, it exists in reptiles; in the centre341 THE EYEBALL. of this spot is a depression, the fovea centralis ; about 2,tli inch to the inner side of the yellow spot is a slight elevation, the papilla optica, which marks the disc-like entrance of the optic nerve into the retina; here the fibres of the nerve radiate outwards and forwards to the ora serrata, and branches of the arteria centralis retime accompany then. The retina is highly complex in structure, and consists of nerve fibres and cells, of peripheral end-organs, of con- nective tissue, and of blood-vessels, arranged in several layers. Max Schultze, the chief authority on the sub- ject, recognised ten layers, but included among these the layer of hexagonal pigment cells just described as the inner pigmentary layer of the choroid. If this layer be omitted, nine layers may then be recognised, and, following Schultze, be named from before backwards as follows:—1. Mem- brana limitans interna; 2. Layer of optic nerve fibres; 3. Layer of ganglion cells ; 4. Internal granulated (molecular) layer; 5. Internal granule layer; 6. External granulated layer; 7. External granule layer; 8. Membrana limitans externa; 9. Bacillary layer (Fig. 101). The nervous elements of the retina will first be con- sidered. The optic nerve fibres (2), where they pierce the sclerotic, as a rule lose the medullary sheath, and radiate outwards from the optic disc to the ora serrata as non-medul- lated fibres immediately behind and parallel to the mem- brana limitans interna. These fibres vary greatly in size, and are frequently varicose. When any of the optic nerve fibres retain the medullary sheath the retina is there ren- dered opaque. Immediately behind the nerve fibres is the layer of ganglionic nerve cells (3). These cells are either bi- polar or multipolar. In the living eye the cell substance342 ANATOMY. is hyaline and the nucleus transparent, but after death the substance both of the body of the cell and the processes assumes a fibnllated appearance, like the axial cylinder of an optic nerve fibre. One process, the central process, extends into the layer of optic nerve fibres; and another, the peripheral, into the internal granulated layer. The internal granulated layer (4) contains the branching pro- cesses of the nerve cells, some of which apparently become continuous with an arrangement of excessively fine fibrils, probably nervous in their nature. These fibrils are inter- mingled with a delicate plexus of connective tissue. The internal granule layer (5) contains numerous fusiform nucleated enlargements, the so-called internal granules, arranged in superimposed strata; from each fusiform enlargement a fibre proceeds in two directions, one centrally into the internal granulated layer, and one peripherally into the external granulated layer. These fibres possess vari- cosities, and resemble the optic nerve fibres. The external granulated layer (6) is very thin, and consists of an ex- panded network of minute fibres, with nuclei situated at the points of intersection of the fibres. Krause has called it the membrana fenestrata. The external granule layer (7) contains numerous fusiform nucleated enlargements, the so-called external granules, arranged in superimposed strata : from each enlargement a fibre proceeds in two directions, one centrally into the external granulated layer, and one peripherally through the membrana limitans externa to the bacillary layer, where it becomes continuous with the anterior end of either a rod or a cone, as the case may be. Hence these fibres of the external granule layer are called by Schultze rod and cone fibres, and the externalTHE EYEBALL. 343 granules are nucleated enlargements of these fibres. These fibres possess varicosities like those of the internal granule layer. The bacillary layer (9) or membrane of Jacob consists of multitudes of elongated bodies arranged side by side like rows of palisades, and vertically to the surfaces of the retina. Some of these bodies are cylindrical, and are named the rods of the retina; others are flask-shaped, and named the cones of the retina : the rods equal in length the entire thickness of the bacillary layer; the cones are shorter than the rods, and are interspersed at regular intervals between them ; the apex of each cone is directed towards, but does not reach, the plane of the posterior or choroidal surface of the retina. The posterior or outer end of each rod rests against the pigmentary layer of the choroid. The anterior or inner ends of both rods and cones are con- tinuous with the rod and cone fibres of the external granule layer, as already described. Each rod and cone is sub- divided into an outer strongly refractile and an inner feebly refractile segment. By the action of various reagents the outer segments both of the rods and cones exhibit a trans- verse striation, and ultimately break up into discs. Hensen has described a longitudinal striation in the outer segments, and Bitter has stated that both in the outer and inner segments of the rods an axial fibre exists. Max Schultz© has also seen the inner segments of both rods and cones longitudinally striped on the surface. Ewart has traced a varicose fibrilla, which he believes to be nervous, from the external granule layer into the inner segment of a cone (Fig, 102). Modifications in the relative numbers and appear- ances of the rods and cones have been seen in the eyes of344 ANATOMY. various vertebrata. In birds, for example, the cones are much more numerous than the rods, whilst the 8 reverse is the case in mammals gene- rally. In the cartilaginous fishes the cones are entirely absent; so also, as Schultze has shown, in the bat, hedge-hog, and mole; whilst in Fig. 102.—Cones of the retina of a hen. a, inner seg- ment of a cone; b, external grannie, containing a vari- cose librilla, which is pro- longed into the inner seg- ment; c, lenticular body at junction of the outer and inner segment; 8, mem- brana limitans externa. (From Ewart.) reptiles the bacillary layer is exclu- sively composed of cones. In all the vertebrata, except the mammalia, the twin or double cones described by Hannover probably exist. In the amphibia and some birds (Fig. 102), lens-shaped bodies have been described in the inner seg- ments of the cones. The rods and cones are the peripheral end-organs in connection with the fibres of the optic nerve, and their apparent relation to these fibres is as follows :— The optic nerve fibres are continuous with the central pro- cesses of the ganglion cells of the retina, the peripheral branching processes of which pass into the internal granu- lated layer, where they may possibly become continuous with the central processes of the inner granular layer. The peri- pheral processes of the inner granular layer enter the external granulated layer, but it is difficult to say whether or not they become continuous with the central processes of that layer. There can, however, be no doubt that the peripheral processes of this layer are directly continuous with the rods and cones of the bacillary layer. The entire arrangement is sometimes called the radial nervous fibres of the retina. In addition to the nervous structures just described, the retina contains a delicate supporting connective tissue like345 THE EYEBALL. tlie neuroglia of the brain and spinal cord. Not only does it lie between the fibres, cells, and so-called granules in the several nervous layers, and form in them a radial arrange- ment of supporting fibres, but it constitutes the two limitary membranes of the retina. The membrana limitans externa (8) is excessively thin, and appears in vertical sections through the retina as a mere line between the bacillary and external granular layers, continuous on the one hand with the connective tissue which passes for a short distance be- tween the rods and cones, and on the other with the connec- tive tissue framework of the external granule layer (Fig. 101). The membrana limitans interna (1) covers the anterior surface of the retina, and lies next the vitreous body; its posterior surface blends with the radial arrangement of connective tissue between the optic nerve fibres, but its anterior or hyaloid ’ J Fig. 103.—Flat cells on the surface, as J. C. Ewart has recently anterior surface of the 7 J retina of tne sheep. shown, possesses a mosaic appearance, V'rom Ewart.) due to the presence of a layer of flat epithelial cells. The yellow spot exhibits some structural differences from the rest of the retina. It owes its colour to the presence of yellow pigment deposited in the more anterior layers of the retina. Except at its central depression, the fovea centralis, it is thicker than the surrounding parts of the retina; but it is much softer, a condition which is due to the almost complete absence of the layer of optic nerve fibres, and a diminution in the amount of the supporting con- nective tissue j the membrana limitans interna is, however, relatively stronger. In the fovea centralis itself the rods of the bacillary layer have entirely disappeared, and are346 ANATOMY. replaced by cones which are distinguished by their close arrangement, and the more slender form and increased length, especially of their outer segments. The external granule layer is well marked, and the central fibres belong- ing to it, instead of passing vertically forwards, incline very obliquely or almost horizontally outwards to the internal granule layer, which, together with the layers anterior to it, is so thin as almost to have disappeared. In the yellow spot surrounding the fovea, the bacillary layer is also composed of cones which are not, however, so slender or so long as at the fovea itself. The layer of nerve cells and the inner part of the external granule layer are thicker than in the rest of the retina. The yellow spot is the part of the retina most sensitive to light. At the ora serrata or anterior border of the retina the nervous layers, including the rods and cones, cease to exist. The radial connective tissue and internal limiting membrana are present; from the radial tissue a layer of cells is prolonged forward in contact with the deep surface of the ciliary processes as the pars ciliaris retinae. The retina is supplied with blood by the arteria centralis, which, traversing the axis of the optic nerve, reaches the retina at the optic disc. In the retina it branches dicho- tomously in the nerve fibre layer, avoiding however the yellow spot, and its terminal twigs reach the ora serrata.. The capillaries form in the more anterior layers of the retina a distinct network, which does not enter the external granule and bacillary layers, but penetrates the yellow spot, though not the fovea centralis. The blood is conveyed from the retina by the central vein which accompanies the artery in the optic nerve, and opens either into the347' THE EYEBALL. ophthalmic vein or directly into the cavernous sinus. The veins and capillaries of the retina have been described by His as completely invested by perivascular lymphatic sheaths, whilst the arteries only possess such sheaths for a limited part of their course. These lymphatics leave the eyeball along with the bundles of the optic nerve through the lamina cribrosa in the sclerotic. The Optic Nerve itself passes from the orbit through the optic foramen into the cranial cavity, where it arises from the optic commissure. This commissure is a flattened band fotrned by the junction of the two optic tracts. Each tract winds backwards at the outer side of the tuber cinereum and crus cerebri to arise from the optic thalamus, corpora quad- rigemina and geniculata; some observers also state that it derives fibres from the tuber cinereum and lamina cinerea. In the commissure an interchange takes place between the fibres of opposite nerves and tracts, so that not only does an optic nerve contain fibres derived from the tract on its own side, but from the opposite tract, and it has even been stated that fibres pass across the commissure from one optic nerve to the other, and from one optic tract to the other. THE REFRACTING MEDIA. The Aqueous Humour is a limpid watery fluid, containing a little common salt in solution, which occupies the space between the cornea and the front of the crystalline lens In this space the iris lies, and imperfectly divides it into two chambers, an anterior and a posterior, which commu- nicate with each other through the pupil. The anterior chamber, of some size, is situated between the iris and348 ANATOMY. cornea ; but as the iris is in contact with the front of the lens, the posterior chamber is reduced to a mere chink between the circumference of the iris and that of the lens. The Crystalline Lens is situated behind the iris and pupil, and in front of the vitreous body. It is a trans- parent bi-convex lens, with its antero-posterior diameter £d less than the transverse, its posterior surface more convex than the anterior, and with its circumference rounded. It consists of a capsule, which encloses the body of the lens. The lens capsule is a transparent, smooth, structureless, and very elastic membrane, about twice as thick on the anterior as on the posterior surface of the lens. It is non-vascular in the adult, though in the foetus a branch of the central artery of the retina, which traverses the vitreous humour, ramifies in its posterior portion. A single layer of polygonal cells lies between the body of the lens and the anterior portion of the capsule. The lens body is softer at its periphery than in its centre. It is built up of concentric layers, and on both the anterior and posterior surfaces lines are to be seen radiating from the central pole of each surface towards the circumference of the body. The radiated pattern varies in different animals. In the human foetus there are usually three lines, but in the adult they are more numerous. The lines on one surface do not lie immediately opposite those on the other, but are inter- mediate. By the action of strong spirit and other reagents the body of the lens can be split up from the periphery towards the centre in the direction of these lines, so that they mark the edges of apposition of its concentric laminae. Each lamina consists of numerous hexagonal fibres about xtVcfth inch wide, which extend from one surface to theTHE EYEBALL. 349 other over the circumference of the lens, so that a fibre which begins at the polar end of a radius on the one surface terminates at the circumferential end of a radius on the opposite. The edges of the fibres are sinuous in man, but denticulated in many animals, especially fishes, so that the fibres, not only in the same, but in superimposed layers, are closely interlocked. The lens fibres are nucleated, a structural fact which gives a clue to their true nature, and they are now regarded as peculiarly modified elongated cells. Babuchin states that he can trace the transition from the cells of the layer between the lens-body and capsule to the proper lens fibres. The lens-body is non-vascular and non-nervous. The surfaces of the lens become more flattened in old age, and its substance hardens and is less transparent. The Vitreous Body is much the largest of the refracting media, and occupies the largest part of the space enclosed by the tunics. Anteriorly it is hollowed out to receive the posterior convexity of the lens, but posteriorly it is convex, and the retina is moulded on it. It is as trans- lucent as glass, jelly-like in consistency, and when punctured a watery fluid drains out. Its minute structure is difficult to ascertain, but as it, like the subcutaneous tissue of the embryo, contains rounded, stellate, and fusiform cells, it is customary to refer it to the gelatinous form of connective tissue; concentric lamellae, and even a radiated arrangement of fibres, have also been described. By some observers the vitreous humour has been considered to be invested by a delicate structureless membrane, the hyaloid membrane; but by others this membrane is regarded as belonging to the retina, where it forms the membrana limitans interna.350 ANATOMY. Husckke and others have described a layer of epithelial cells as present on the surface of the hyaloid membrane. i ^mos^ °PP°site the ora serrata a mem- brane springs from the vitreous body, passes forwards for some distance in ' relation to the deep surface of the ciliary Processes, but separated from ^ them by the pars ciliaris retinae, and Fig. 104.—The larger flat ,1 r cells in this figure are tJlen inclines inwards to become attached lrom the surface of (he , hyaloid membrane. The to the anterior surface of the cansillp smaller cells are from „ _ “ the substance of the vit-ot the lens close to its circumference reous humour. {From Ewart) It is so closely connected at its origin with the membrana limitans that it is difficult to recognise it as a distinct membrane. It is named the suspensory ligament of the lens, or zonule of Zinn, and contains fibres, which run m the meridional direction. Where it leaves the vitreous body a narrow space is enclosed between it and that body, which space surrounds the circumference of the lens, and is called the canal of Petit. From the relation of the suspensory ligament to the ciliary processes it has a plicated surface, and when these processes are torn away from it a portion of the pigment of the processes is often left behind, so that the zonule is sometimes named the ciliary processes 6f the vitreous body. In addition to the lymphatics of the cornea and retina already described, the recent researches of Schwalbe have shown that spaces exist within the eyeball which com- municate with the lymphatic system. The slit-like in- terval between the sclerotic and choroid, or perichoroidal space, is regarded as a receptacle for lymph lined by an endothelium; from] it lymphatics arise, which pierce theTHE EYEBALL. 351 sclerotic alongside the veins, and communicate with the space of Tenon which lies between the exterior of the eye- ball and its investing tunic of fascia. The lymph formed in the iris and ciliary processes is believed to be poured into the anterior chamber, and from it into the canal of Schlemm; also into the anterior chamber the canal of Petit, which is believed to be a lymph-space, opens by a series of fissures in the zonule of Zinn. The Eyeball is an optical instrument, constructed on the plan of the camera obscura. The sclerotic forms the wall of the chamber. The choroid represents the black lining for absorbing the surplus rays of light. The cornea, aqueous humour, lens, and vitreous body are the translucent refracting media which, like the glass lens of the camera obscura, bring the rays of light to a focus. The retina is the sensitive plate on which the optical picture is thrown. In considering the relation of the retina to the visual rays, it must be kept in mind that the place of entrance of the optic nerve is insensible to light, and that the most sensitive part of the retina is the yellow spot, with its fovea centralis, where the optic nerve fibres are absent, but where the bacillary layer reaches its maximum size. It is clear, therefore, that the rods and cones of this layer, and not the optic nerve fibres, are the structures in the retina which are stimulated by the light; and it is probable, as was suggested many years ago by Goodsir, that these rods and cones are impressed by the light, not as it enters the eye directly, but as it is reflected backwards from the choroid coat along their axes. The iris is the diaphragm which, by opening or closing the pupil, admits or cuts off the rays of light. The ciliary muscle represents the adjustingANATOMY. 352 screw of the camera; through its attachment to the ciliary processes and their relation to the suspensory ligament of the lens, it is able to act upon the lens and modify the curvature of its anterior surface j for when the eye is to be accommodated to the vision of near objects the anterior surface of the lens becomes more convex than when distant objects are being examined. It has already been stated on p. 213 that the retina is the expanded distal part of the primary optic vesicle, which grows forwards towards the superficial epiblast covering of the embryo head. By the thickening and involution of the epiblast superficial to the vesicle a hollow is produced in the front of the vesicle, which gradually deepening forms a cup or pocket, the secondary optic vesicle, in which the involuted part of the epiblast is lodged. This pocket has double walls, an anterior and a posterior, the former of which becomes the retina, the latter the layer of hexagonal choroidal pigment. The cavity between these walls, origin- ally continuous through the canal in the optic nerve •with the cavity in the hemisphere, becomes obliterated, so that the retina and choroidal pigment come into contact with each other. The part of the epiblast lodged in the pocket severs its connection with the superficial epiblast, and forms the crystalline lens. It becomes closed in in front by a growth superficial to it, both of mesoblast and epiblast; the mesoblast layer forms the cornea, whilst the superficial epiblast layer forms the anterior epithelium of the cornea, or conjunctival epithelium. Through a want of uniformity in the growth of the wall of the secondary optic vesicle, a fissure, called the choroidal fissure, exists on its under surface, through which the mesoblast passesACCESSORY PARTS TO THE EYEBALL. 353 between the lens and the retina, and forms the vitreous humour, and perhaps the capsule of the lens. This fissure then closes up so that the connection between the vitreous humour and the surrounding mesoblast is severed. The mesoblast immediately surrounding the optic vesicle then differentiates into the vascular and connective tissue structures of the choroid and ciliary processes; into the tissues of the iris and ciliary muscle, and into the sclerotic coat. The sclerotic is continuous in front with the meso- blast, out of which the cornea is formed, so as to complete the external tunic of the eyeball. Accessory Parts to the Eyeball. In relation to the eyeball several accessory parts are found. The Eye-Brows are projections of the integument, from which short, stiff hairs grow. The Eye-Lids, or palpebrce, are two movable curtains, an upper and a lower, which protect the front of the globe. Between each pair of lids is a horizontal fissure, the palpe- bral fissure. From the free margins of the two lids project short hairs, the eye-lashes or cilia; the upper set curve downwards and forwards, the lower set upwards and for- wards ; they also protect the front of the globe. Each eye- lid consists externally of skin, immediately beneath which are the fibres of the orbicidar sphincter muscle; a thin plate of fibro-cartilage, the tarsal cartilage, lies beneath the sphincter; to the inner end of this cartilage a fibrous band, the tendo palpebrarum, is attached, which springs from the ascending process of the superior maxilla; into the Z354 ANATOMY. cartilage in tlie upper eye-lid the tendon of the levator palpebrse superioris is inserted. Lining the inner surface of the eye-lid is the conjunctiva. Between the conjunctiva and the tarsal cartilage is a layer of glands, the Meibomian glands; each gland consists of a short duct, which expands at its sides into small sacculi. The sacculi contain short columnar cells; these secrete a sebaceous material, which escapes through the orifice of the duct at the border of the eye-lid, and by greasing the edge of the eye-lid prevents the overflow of the tears, except when lachrymation is profuse. The Conjunctiva is a mucous membrane, which forms the posterior layer of the eye-lid, and is reflected on to the anterior part of the sclerotic. At the inner angle of junc- tion of the eye-lids is a soft reddish elevation of the conjunctiva, the caruncula laclirymalis, and immediately external to it is a vertical fold, the plica semilunaris, the rudiment of the third eye-lid, or membrana nictitans, so well developed in birds. The palpebral conjunctiva has small papilhe scattered over its surface; its epithelium is stratified, with scaly cells on the free surface and elongated cells in the deepest layer. In the sub-epithelial tissue are small branched mucous glands, which are numerous in the caruncula. Little masses of adenoid tissue (p. 144) with lymphatic vessels are also found in it, and the conjunctiva of the front of the eyeball is thinner than the palpebral part. It is not glandular, and its nerves terminate in end-bulbs (p. 205). The palpebral conjunctiva, and in part that of the eyeball, receive their blood-vessels from those of the eye-lids, but the portion of the conjunctiva next the cornea is supplied by the arteries of the sclerotic coat. The Lachrymal Apparatus is engaged in the secretion355 ACCESSORY PARTS TO THE EYEBALL. of tlie tears, and in conveying them away from the front of the globe. The lachrymal gland occupies a depres- sion in the outer part of the roof of the orbit. It is smaller than an almond, is sub- divided into lob- ules, and belongs to the group of compound race- mose glands. It consists of the ramifications of short ducts, which terminate in rlim Fro- 105. — Lachrymal canals and duct. 1, orbicular 111 C1US muscle; 2 and 3, lachrymal canals; 4, carancula; 5, ters of Small sac- lacllrymal sac; 6, lachrymal duct; 7, angular artery. culi. The wall of each sacculus consists of a delicate membrana propria, and the cavity contains the polyhedral secreting cells. Outside the membrana propria is a capillary network derived from the lachrymal artery, but Giannuzzi and Boll have recently described a space between this network and the membrana propria which they believe to be continuous with the lymphatic system. Pfliiger has described nerves as terminating in connection with the secreting cells. The excretory ducts of the gland are from six to eight in number, and open on the back of the upper eye-lid, and the tears are washed over the surface of the globe by the involuntary winking of this lid. When the secre- tion is increased in quantity, in the act of crying, the tears flow over the cheek, but in ordinary circumstances they are356 ANATOMY. conveyed away by two slender tubes, the lachrymal canals, which open by minute orifices, the puncta lachrymalia, one at the inner end of the free border of each eye-lid. These tubes open at their opposite ends into a small reservoir, the lachrymal sac, situated in a hollow in the lachrymal bone. From this sac a duct, the nasal or lachrymal duct, proceeds which opens into the inferior meatus of the nose, and here the tears mingle with the mucous secretion of that cavity.

Muscles of the Eyeball.—The sclerotic coat of the eyeball has six muscles inserted into it. Four of the muscles are called recti, and are situated, one superior, one inferior, one external, another internal to the globe. They all arise from the rim of bone which bounds the optic foramen; the357 ACCESSORY PARTS TO THE EYEBALL. external and internal muscles are inserted vertically into tlie sides of the sclerotic, but the superior and inferior recti have oblique insertions into its upper and lower aspects. The other two muscles are called obliqui. The superior oblique arises along with the recti, passes to the inner end of the upper border of the orbit, where its tendon goes through a pulley, and is directed backwards and out- wards, to be inserted, between the superior and external recti, obliquely into the upper and outer part of the sclerotic. The inferior oblique arises from the lower border of the orbit, passes outwards and upwards to be inserted, close to the superior oblique, obliquely into the sclerotic. These muscles roll the eyeball in the orbit, and, without entering into a minute analysis of their actions, their office may be stated generally as follows :—The internal rectus rolls it inwards, the external outwards, about its vertical axis; the superior rectus rolls it upwards, the inferior downwards, about its transverse horizontal axis, though from the obliquity of their insertions they give it at the same time a slight inward or outward movement as the case may be ; the superior and inferior oblique roll the globe about its antero-posterior or sagittal axis, the superior upwards and outwards, the inferior downwards and outwards. Periosteal Muscle of the Orbit.—The periosteum of the orbit contains, as H. Muller and I have described, a layer of non-striped muscular fibre in the part which covers over the spheno-maxillary fissure. In man it is rudimen- tary, but in the sheep, deer, elephant, &c., where the osseous wall of the orbit is deficient, this muscle forms a well-defined structure. It has been suggested that it acts as a protractor muscle of the globe.ANATOMY. 358 The Ear. The Ear, or organ of hearing, is a complex acoustic ap- paratus, situated in connection with the temporal hone. It is divided into three parts, named external, middle, and internal ear. EXTERNAL EAR. The External Ear consists of the pinna or auriele and the external auditory meatus. The auricle is the oblong convoluted body situated at the side of the head. Its incurved outer border is named the helix. Within this lies a curved ridge, the anti-helix, in front of which is a deep hollow, the concha, which leads into the external meatus. The concha is bounded in front by a prominence, the tragus, and behind by a smaller prominence, the anti-tragus ; below the anti-tragus is the lobule, which forms the most depending part of the auricle. The framework of the auricle is formed of yellow elastic fibro-cartilage invested by integument, except the lobule, which consists merely of a fold of integument containing fat. Attached to the car- tilage are not only the three auricular muscles referred to on page 83, but also certain smaller muscles called the proper muscles of the pinna. Thus the greater muscle of the helix is placed on its anterior border; the lesser muscle of the helix is situated where it arises out of the concha; the muscle of the tragus lies on the front of that prominence; the muscle of the anti4ragus is placed on the hack of its prominence; the transverse muscle on the posterior or cranial surface of the auricle. The External Meahis leads from the bottom of the conchaTHE EAR. 359 into the temporal bone, and is separated from the tympanum or middle ear by the membrana tympani. It is a crooked passage one and a quarter inch long, inclined at first forwards and upwards, then downwards and inwards. The wall of the outer end of the passage is formed of fibro-cartilage continuous with the cartilage of the auricle, whilst that of Fig. 107,—The Ear as-seen tn-serthyn. helix; 6, anti-tragus; c, anti-helix; d, concha; e, lobule; /, mastoid process; g, porfcio dura; h, styloid process; k, internal carotid artery; L, Eustachian tube; m, tip of petrous process; «, exter- nal auditory meatus; o, membrani tympani; p, tympanum; 1, points to mal- leus; 2, to incus; 3, to stapes; 4, to cochlea; 5, 6, 7, the three semicircular canals; 8 and 9, portio dura and portio mollis. (After Arnold) the deeper end is formed of the plate-like tympanic part of the temporal bone. The passage is lined with integu- ment continuous with the skin of the auricle, in which are situated numerous hairs, together with ceruminous glands which secrete the well-known yellow “ wax."ANATOMY. 3G0 MIDDLE EAT?.. The Tympanum, or Drum, or Middle Ear, is a chamber irregularly cuboidal in form, situated in the temporal bone between the bottom of the meatus and the internal ear (Fig. 107). The outer wall is formed of the membrani tympani, which inclines obliquely downwards and inwards at the bottom of the external meatus, at an angle of 55° to the axis of the meatus, whilst the membranes in the two ears form with each other an obtuse angle of 130° to 135°. The tym- panic membrane is attached to a groove at the bottom of the meatus, and is concave on its outer, convex on its inner surface. It consists of three layers : an external tegumen- tary, continuous with the skin of the meatus, which con- tains no hairs or glands; an internal mucous, continuous with the mucous lining of the tympanum; and an inter- mediate membrana propria, which consists of unyielding fibres arranged both radially and circularly. The radial fibres radiate from the point of attachment of the handle of the malleus. The membrana propria is usually said to be destitute both of nerves and vessels, but Ivessel states that nerves, blood, and lymph vessels exist in it as well as in the mucous and tegumentary layers Immediately in front of the membrana tympani is the Glaserian fissure. The inner wall separates the tympanum from the labyrinth, and presents the f ollowing appearances: a rounded elevation or jyromontory caused by the first turn of the cochlea, on the surface of which promontory are grooves for the lodgment of the tympanic plexus of nerves • above the promontory is an oval opening closed in by a membrane, the fenestra ovalis, which corresponds with the vestibule ;361 THE EAE. behind and below the promontory is a round opening closed in by a membrane, the fenestra rotunda, which corresponds with the tympanic passage in the cochlea. The floor of the tympanum is a narrow chink between the inner and outer walls; and the roof is formed by the anterior surface of the petrous-temporal bone. At its anterior wall the tympanum opens into the Eustachian tube, a canal which communicates with the nasal compartment of the pharynx immediately behind the inferior turbinal. The wall of the tympanic end of this tube is formed of bone, that of the pharyngeal end of a curved plate of hyaline cartilage, which is connected to the bone by fibro-cartilage; its pharyngeal orifice is dilated into a trumpet-shaped mouth ; through this tube the ciliated mucous membrane of the nasal part of the pharynx is prolonged into the tympanum. The cartilaginous wall of the tube does not completely surround it, but is completed by a fibrous membrane, and a layer of voluntary muscle, named by Riidinger the dila- tator tubas. Above the tympanic orifice of the Eustachian tube is a fine canal, through which the tensor tympani muscle enters the tympanum. At its posterior wall the tympanum communicates with the air-sinuses in the mastoid temporal; here also is found a small hollow eminence, th a pyramid, through a hole at the apex of which the ten- don of the stapedius muscle passes ; and a foramen which transmits the chorda tympani nerve. The tympanic cavity contains three small bones, named malleus, incus, and stapes, arranged so as to form an irregular chain, stretching across the cavity from the outer to the inner wall. The Malleus or hammer is the most external bone. In362 ANATOMY. it may be recognised a bead separated by a constricted neck from an elongated handle. Close to the junction of the neck and handle a long slender process projects downwards and forwards to be inserted into the Glaserian fissure, and near the root of the long process a short process projects outwards. By its handle the malleus is intimately con- nected with the centre of the membrana tympani ; by its head it articulates with the incus; whilst ligamentous fibres pass from it upwards, forwards, outwards, and backwards to the tympanic walls. The Incus, or anvil-shaped bone, possesses a body and two processes; on the anterior surface of the body is a saddle-shaped hollow in which the head of the malleus fits; • the short process projects almost horizontally backwards, and is attached by a ligament to the posterior wall of the tympanum; the long process extends at first down- wards and then inwards, to end in a rounded projection, named os orbiculare, through which it articulates with the stapes. The Stapes, or stirrup-shaped bone, possesses a head and neck, a base and two crura; the head articulates with the os orbiculare of the incus; from the constricted neck the two crura curve inwards to the base, which is attached to the fenestra ovalis. The joint between the malleus and incus is diarthrodial and saddle-shaped, and the articular surfaces are enclosed by a capsular ligament. The joint between the incus and stapes is also diarthrodial, and pos- sesses an investing capsular ligament. Toynbee and Iliid- inger have described the base of the stapes and the margin of the fenestra ovalis as each invested by hyaline cartilage. Between these plates elastic fibres extend in a plexiform363 THE EAR. manner, and the intervals between them are occupied by fluid ; the joint seems, therefore, a modified amphiarthrosis. The bones are moved on each other at these joints by small muscles. The tensor tympani arises from the apex of the petrous temporal, and the cartilage of the Eustachian tube, enters the tympanum at its anterior wall, and is in- serted into the handle of malleus near its root. The Ictxa- tor tympani muscle arises from the spine of the sphenoid, and the cartilage of the Eustachian tube enters the tym- panum through the Glaserian fissure, and is inserted into the neck of the malleus. The stapedius arises within the pyramid, enters the tympanum through the hole at its apex, and is inserted into the neck of the stapes. The tympanum is lined by a mucous membrane continuous with that of the Eustachian tube, which invests the tympanic ossicles, liga- ments, and muscles, and is prolonged backwards so as to line the mastoid air-sinuses. The epithelium covering this mem- brane, where it lines the floor and the adjacent part of the anterior, posterior, and internal walls, consists of ciliated columnar cells; but the epithelium covering the roof, the promontory, the membrani tympani, and the tympanic ossicles, is tessellated. In the sub-epithelial connective tissue the blood and lymph vessels and nerves of the tympanum ramify. Kessel has recently described in it certain peculiar bodies, which consist of a central axial band with a series of capsules, possessing a fibrillar struc- ture, arranged concentrically around the axis ; the function of these bodies is not known. The formation of the auricle and external meatus is well adapted for collecting and transmitting sound-vibrations inwards to the middle ear and labyrinth. These vibrations364 ANATOMY. strike the membrana tympani, and are propagated by the chain of bones across the tympanic cavity to the labyrinth. The pressure of the vibrations on the tympanic membrane forces that membrane inwards, so that its inner surface presses on the handle of the malleus, the effect of which is to rotate the hammer about its axis; but by the ligamentous attachment of the malleus to the tympanic walls and to the incus, and, as Helmholtz has shown, by the interlocking of cog-like processes connected with the articular surfaces of the two bones, the range of movement is so limited that the pressure on the malleus is transmitted through the incus upon the stapes, which presses, therefore, on the mem- brane of the fenestra ovalis, so that the movements of the membrana tympani are thus transmitted to fluid within the labyrinth. The tensor tympani muscle tightens the tympanic membrane by drawing the handle of the malleus inwards, and still further adapts the structures for the transmission of sound-vibrations. The laxator tympani is considered to be the antagonistic muscle to the tensor tympani. There is some difficulty in determining the action of the stapedius, but if, as is probable, it draws the stapes from the fenestra ovalis, it will diminish the pres- sure of the chain of bones on that membrane. INTERNAL EAR. The Internal Ear, named the Labyrinth, from its com- plex construction, is the part of the auditory apparatus in which the nerve of hearing is distributed, and where the peripheral end-organs are situated. It is enclosed within the petrous bone, and is divided into three parts, viz.,TIIE EjtE. 365 vestibule, semicircular canals, and cochlea, each of which consists of an osseous and a membranous portion. The Vestibule lies immediately internal to the tympanum, between it and the bottom of the internal auditory meatus; behind the vestibule are the semicircular canals, and in front is situated the cochlea. It is the part of the labyrinth which first appears in animals, and is therefore the most constant part of the organ. In the myxinoid fishes a single semicircu- lar canal is superadded to the vestibule, in the lamprey two canals, but in other fishes and in the higher vertebrates three canals exist. In amphibia, reptiles, and birds the cochlea is small and rudimentary in comparison with its develop- ment in mammals. The osseous vestibule is an ovoid chamber about -g-th inch in diameter. In its outer or tympanic wall is the fenestra ovalis ; in its inner are small auditory foramina, which transmit from the internal meatus the vestibular branches of the auditory nerve ■ behind these holes is the opening of a minute canal, the aquedudus vestibuli; its anterior wall communicates with the scala vestibuli of the cochlea, and into its posterior wall open the five orifices of the three semicircular canals. The Semicircular Canals are named superior, posterior, and external. The superior and posterior are sometimes called the vertical canals, and the external the horizontal canal, but, as Crum Brown has shown, the superior and posterior lie in planes nearly equally inclined to the mesial plane of the head, and the external is in a plane at right angles to the mesial plane. Further, the canals in the two ears have definite relations to each other 3 for whilst the superior canal of each ear is nearly parallel to the posterior canal of the other, the external canals in both ears lie366 ANATOMY. nearly in the same plane. The canals are bent, forming nearly -|ds of a circle, and would have had six openings into the vestibule had not the contiguous ends of the superior and posterior blended together to open by a common orifice. The opposite end of each of these canals and the outer end of the external canal dilate close to the vestibule to twice their usual diameter, and form an ampulla. The osseous vestibule and semicircular canals are lined by a periosteum invested by a tessellated epithelium, and con- tain a little fluid, the perilymph. In this fluid the membranous labyrinth is suspended. The membranous vestibule is formed of two small sac-like dila- tations, the walls of which are directly continuous with each other, though the cavities are separated by an intermediate partition. The upper and posterior dilatation, named utriculus, is larger than the lower and anterior, named sacculus. The sacculus is continu- ous with the ductus cochlearis of the membranous cochlea, and both sacculus and utriculus communicate by slender tubes with a short diverticulum lodged in the aqueductus vestibuli, to which the name of ductus vestibuli may be given (Fig. 109). The membranous semicircular canals are about Jd the diameter of the osseous. Their walls are continuous with that of the Fig. 108.—Ending of the Vesti- bular nerve, cl, columnar cells covering the crista acoustica; p, peripheral, and c, central processes of audi- tory cells; n, nerve fibres. (After Riidingcr.)367 THE EAR. utriculus, and they open by five orifices into it. Each has an ampulla within the ampulla of the osseous canal. Both the sacculus and utriculus are in places attached to the periosteal lining of the osseous vestibule, and delicate ligamentous bands connect the membranous semicircular canals to the periosteal lining of the tubes in which they are contained. The wall of the membranous vestibule and canals consists of a delicate fibrous membrane lined by a tessellated epithelium. The inner part of this mem- brane has a vitreous or hyaline lustre, and gives origin in the canals to short papillae which project into the lumen. The membranous vestibule and canals are distended with the fluid endolymph. The sacculus, utriculus, and ampullae are specially modified in connection with the peripheral termination of the vestibular branches of the auditory nerve. The membranous wall forms in each of these dilatations a projecting ridge, the crista acoustica, to which calcareous particles, the otoliths, which may be either amorphous or crystalline, are adherent. The epithelial investment of the crista is elongated into columnar cells, and intercalated between them are fusiform cells, the audi- tory cells, each of which, as Schultze and other observers have described, possesses a peripheral and a central process. The peripheral process projects beyond the plane of the free surface of the endothelium into the endolymph as the auditory hair, whilst the central process extends into the sub-epithelial tissue, where the nerve plexus belonging to the terminal branches of the auditory nerve ramifies, and with which it is probably continuous (Fig. 108). These auditory cells are, therefore, the peripheral end-organs of the vesti- bular branches of the auditoiy nerve, and their general368 ANATOMY. arrangement is not unlike that of the olfactory cells of the nose. The Cochlea is by far the most complex part of the and a half times round a central pillar or modiolus. Both the pillar and the tube diminish rapidly in diameter from the base to the apex of the cochlea. The tube is im- perfectly divided into two passages by a plate of bone, the osseous spiral lamina, which, springing from the modiolus, winds spirally around it, and projects into the tube. When the membranous cochlea is in its place the division is completed by a membrane, the membranous spiral lamina, or basilar membrane, which bridges across the interval between the free edge of the osseous spiral lamina, and the outer wall of the tube, to the latter of which it is attached by the spiral cochlear ligament. These passages are called scala tympani and scala vestilndi. But .another membrane also, the membrane of Heissner, arises from a denticulated spiral crest, the limbus or crista spiralis, attached to the vestibular border of the fiee edge of the osseous spiral lamina, and extends to the spiral liga- ment at the outer wall of the tube, on the vestibular aspect Fig. 109.—Diagram of the membranous Labyrinth.

It is about -jth inch long, and shaped like the shell of a common snail; its base lies near the internal meatus, and its apex is directed j outwards. The osse- ous cochlea is a tube wound spirally two369 THE EAB. of the basilar membrane, so as to enclose a passage between it and the basilar membrane, called scctla intermedia or ductus cochlearis. The membrane of Reissner is formed of delicate vascular connective tissue, with an epithelial layer on each of its two surfaces.

The scala vestibuli or 2 A370 ANATOMY. upper passage, also widest at tlie base, communicates \\ ltli the cavity of the osseous vestibule. At the apex of the cochlea these two scalse communicate with each other through a small hole, the helicotrema. As the scala vestibuli opens into the osseous vestibule, the perilymph is continued into it, and through the helicotrema into the. scala tympani. The ductus cochlearis is the membranous cochlea, and its walls are formed of the basilar membrane next the scala tympani, of the membrane of Reissner next the scala vestibuli, and of the spiral ligament next the wall of the cochlea, which connects the two membranes together. It follows the spiral windings of the cochlea, terminates at the apex of the spiral in a closed end, whilst at the base it communicates with the sacculus of the membranous vesti- bule by a slender tube, the ccmalis reunion* ; hence the membranous cochlea contains endolymph. The tei ruina- tion of the cochlear branches of the auditory nerve and the arrangement of the peripheral end-organs in relation to them are to be looked for in the basilar membrane. These parts have been repeatedly investigated and described in elaborate monographs, the titles of which are given in Waldeyer’s article on the cochlea in Strieker’s Handbuch der Lehre von den Geweben. The general results only of these investigations will be given here, and the original memoirs may be referred to for further details. On the surface of the basilar membrane directed to the ductus cochlearis a remarkable arrangement of cells exists, which presents ail appearance that has been compared with the key-board of a pianoforte, and has been named the organ ofCorti ; it consists of the following parts:-Some of these cells, distinguished by their elongated curved form, areTEE EAR. 371 arranged in two groups, an inner and an outer. Tlie cells of the inner group rest by a broad foot on the inner part of the basilar membrane, close to its attachment to the spiral lamina, project obliquely forwards and outwards, and expand into a dilated head : the cells of the outer group also rest by a broad foot on the same membrane, incline forwards and inwards, and fit into a depression in the head of the cells of the inner group : these two groups of cells form the rods or pillars of Corti, and by their juxtaposition arch over an excessively minute canal enclosed between them and the basilar membrane, which may be named the canal of Corti. The inner rods are, however, more numerous than the outer, and Pritchard has shown that the rods increase in length from the base to the apex of the cochlea. Immediately internal and almost parallel to the inner group of these rods, and adjacent therefore to the crista spiralis, is a row of compressed conical cells, which possess at their anterior ends short stiff hair-like processes; they are the inner hair cells of Deiters. Immediately external and almost parallel to the outer group of rods are four or five rows of hair cells, the outer hair cells, which are attached by their bases to the basilar membrane, whilst from the opposite extremity a brush of hairs projects through the reticular membrane. The outer hair cells are, according to Waldeyer, relatively of large size in man. The reticular membrane of Kolliker is a delicate framework perforated by rounded holes. It extends parallel to the basilar mem- brane from the inner rods of Corti to the external row of outer hair cells, and through the holes in it the hairs of the outer hair cells project. It obviously acts as a support for the anterior ends of these cells, and binds together theseANATOMY. 372 important elements of tlie organ of Corti. Tire interval between the outer hair cells and the spiral ligament is occupied by cells of a more or less columnar form, the supporting cells of Hensen. Covering over the organ of Corti, and separating it from the endolymph of the ductus cochlearis, is the membrana tectoria, which springs from the crista spiralis close to the attachment of the membrane of Rcissner, passes outwards superficial to the membrana Fio 111 —Vertical transverse section through the'basilar membrane and organ of Corti. bm, cs, si, &c„ as in fig. 109; i, inner hair cell; tr, inner and or, outer rod of Corti; o, outer hair cells; sp, supporting cells; cn, cochlear nen e; re, canal of Corti; TO, reticular membrane; ml, membrana tectoria, torn thiough at its outer end. (Adapted from Waldeyer.) reticularis, and apparently blends at its outer border with the spiral ligament. The origin, course, and distribution of the auditory nerve in the labyrinth will now be considered. The auditory nerve is the portio mollis of the seventh cranial nerve. It appears at the base of the brain at the lower border of theTHE EAE. 373 pons Varolii. Traced to its origin its roots wind round the restiform body to the floor of the 4th ventricle, where they form the stria; acousticse, and sink into the grey matter of the floor. Some of the fibres arise from an inner, others from an anterior group of nerve cells, whilst others again are connected with the cells in the restiform body, and probably with the flocculus of the cerebellum. Just as the nerve emerges at the lower border of the pons, as may be well seen in preparations by A. B. Stirling, collections of very vascular grey matter containing groups of multipolar nerve cells lie between the bundles of the nerve, and from their processes re-inforcing fibres are added to the nerve. The auditory nerve passes down the internal meatus, and divides into a vestibular and a cochlear division. The vestibular division enters the vestibule, and divides into five branches for the sacculus, utriculus, and three ampulla; of the membranous semicircular canals. Each branch enters a crista acoustica and forms a plexus, in the meshes of which nerve cells are imbedded. From this plexus fine non-medullated fibres arise, which enter the layer of cells on the surface of the crista, where they anastomose and foim a very delicate plexus, from which fibres spring that in all probability join the central processes of the auditory cells (Fig. 108). The cochlear division enters a canal in the axis of the modiolus, and gives off lateral branches, which pass into the canals situated in the osseous spiral lamina. Here they radiate outwards to the membranous spiral lamina, and have connected with them collections of nerve cells forming the spiral ganglion. Beyond the ganglion they form a flat plexiform expansion, from which delicate nerves passANATOMY. 374 through, a gap in the edge of the osseous lamina into the organ of Corti. In this organ the nerves, as Gottstein and Waldeyer have described, are arranged in two groups of fibres; the inner group become continuous with the deep end of the inner hair cells; the outer group pass across the canal of Corti and end in the outer hair cells (Fig. 111). Hence these cells are the peripheral end-organs of the cochlear branch of the auditory nerve, and may be called the auditory cells of the cochlea. The perilymph of the labyrinth is set in vibration by the movements of the tympanic ossicles and the fenestra ovalis; motion is thus communicated to the membranous labyrinth and the endolymph which it contains. The auditory hairs and cells would thus be set in motion, and the vestibular branches of the auditory nerve would be stimulated to con- duct sound-impulses to the brain. The movements of the perilymph in the scala tympani and of the endolymph in the ductus cochlear is would set in vibration the basilar mem- brane, and the auditory cells resting on it, by which the cochlear branches of the auditory nerve would be stimulated to conduct sound-impulses to the brain. It has been custom- ary for physiologists to regard the vestibule as the part of the labyrinth by which sound or mere noise is determined; the cochlea, as the part which determines variations and degrees of sound, as musical notes or harmony; the semi- circular canals, as determining the directions from which sound proceeds. But within the last two years experiments and arguments have been advanced almost simultaneously by Breuer, Mach, and Crum Brown, in favour of the view that the semicircular canals act as peripheral end-organs for the sense of rotation, by which sense the axis about which375 THE EAR. rotation of the head takes place, the direction of that rota- tion, and its rate, are determined. In the account of the development of the skeleton, p. 57, it was stated that the external meatus, tympanum, and Eustachian tube are the remains of the first branchial cleft of the embryo, that the tympanic ossicles are formed in the first and second visceral arches, and that the petrous bone is ossified in the cartilaginous basis cranii. The membranous labyrinth arises as an invagination of the epi- blast into the mesoblast, near the upper end of the second branchial cleft, and the invaginated fold then closes in, by the growth of the surrounding mesoblast, to form a shut sac, the primary auditory vesicle. The cavity of this vesicle enlarges, thickening of its walls takes place, and in this manner arise modifications in its form, from the con- dition of a simple closed sac, until the membranous vesti- bule, the semicircular canals, and the cochlea are produced. From the epiblast lining of the vesicle, the organ of Corti, and the special apparatus connected with the termination of the auditory nerve in the vestibule and semicircular canals, together with the general epithelial lining of the membranous labyrinth, are derived. The fibro-membranous wall of the labyrinth, and the periotic cartilage which subsequently ossifies into the petrous bone, are produced by a differentiation of the mesoblast surrounding the auditory vesicle. The space filled by perilymph, between the membranous and osseous labyrinth, is apparently due to a splitting of this surrounding mesoblast. The auditory nerve is not, like the optic, a prolongation of the brain, but is developed in the mesoblast lying between the brain and the auditory vesicle. In the course of time its central376 ANATOMY. end unites with the part of the brain from which it derives its roots, and at a later stage its peripheral end extends into the epiblast in which the terminal auditory apparatus arises. The Tongue. The Tongue, situated on the floor of the cavity of the mouth, is the chief organ provided for the excitation of the special sense of taste, but the under surface of the soft palate is said to participate to some extent in this'property. The tongue is also highly endowed with the sense of touch. The structures concerned in the excitation of taste and touch are situated in-the mucous membrane which envelopes the tongue. The tongue is also a muscular organ, and plays an important part in articulation, mastication, and deglutition. Its shape is flattened from above downwards, so that it presents an upper surface or dorsum, and a lower surface. Its posterior part is broad, forms the base or root of the organ, and is attached to the hyoid bone. Its ante- rior extremity or tip is more or less pointed, and its lateral margins or sides are rounded. The muscles connected with the tongue are arranged in pairs, and form three distinct groups, viz., accessory, extrin- sic, and intrinsic muscles. The accessory muscles are the stylo-hyoid, digastric, mylo-hyoid, genio-hyoid, omo-hyoid, sterno-hyoid, and thyro-hyoid, already referred to on page 89, which act upon the hyoid bone, and thus indirectly arc concerned in the movements of the tongue. The extrinsic muscles pass from adjacent parts into the substance of the tongue, and are as follows :—The stylo-glossus arises from377 THE TONGUE. the tip of the styloid process and the stylo-maxillary liga- ment ; it runs forwards along the side of the tongue to the tip. The hyo-glossus is divided into three parts : a, basi- glossus, which arises from the body of the hyoid; b, cerato- glossus, from the great cornu of the hyoid ; c, chondro- glossus, from the small cornu of the hyoid. The fibres from these origins ascend into the side of the tongue. The genio-hyo-glossus arises from the upper tubercle of the symphysis of the lower jaw, its fibres radiate into the sub- stance of the tongue along its whole length from base to tip; this muscle is separated from the corresponding muscle of the opposite half of the tongue by a mesial septum of fibrous tissue. The palato-glossus arises in the substance of the soft palate, and descends to the tongue in the anterior pillar of the fauces. The intrinsic muscles lie in the sub- stance of the tongue itself, and are as follows :—The lingua- lis superior (noto-glossus), consisting of longitudinal fibres, which extend from the base to the tip beneath the mucous membrane of the dorsum ; the lingualis inferior, consisting of longitudinal fibres, which extend from the base to the tip along the under surface between the hyo-glossus and genio- hyo-glossus; transverse muscular fibres, which spring from the mesial fibrous septum and curve outwards and upwards to the sides of the tongue; vertical fibres, which pass through the substance of the tongue from the dorsum to the under surface. The extrinsic and intrinsic muscles can not only move the entire tongue within the cavity of the mouth, protrude it between the lips, and again retract it, but can modify its form; thus the dorsum can be flattened, made convex or concave, the margins can be raised or depressed, and the tip elevated or depressed.ANATOMY. 378 The mucous membrane of the tongue forms a part of the general mucous lining of the mouth; it covers the dorsum, tip, sides, and under surface; is reflected from the under surface to the floor of the mouth, where it forms thefraenum. or bridle of the tongue, and is reflected also from the base to the epiglottis as the frcenci of the epiglottis, as well as over the tonsils and anterior palatine pillars. This mem- brane has its free surface elevated into multitudes of fine processes, called the papillae of the tongue, some of which are simple, others compound. The simple papillae are situated on the back part of the dorsum and the under sur- face of the mucous membrane, as well as scattered between the compound papillae; they are simple conical elevations of the membrane. The compound teapillcB are arranged in three groups, named filiform, fungiform, and circumvallate papillae. The filiform papillae, elongated and thread-like, are the smallest and most numerous, and cover the dorsum in front of the circumvallate papillae. The fungiform or club-shaped papillae are scattered over the anterior and middle parts of the dorsum, and at the tip and sides. The circumvallate pap>illae, seven to twelve in number, form a V-shaped figure on the dorsum towards its base ; a depres- sion in the mucous membrane, called foramen caecum, marks the apex of the V. These are the largest papillse ; each is sunk in a vallum or trench-like depression of the mucous membrane, which isolates it from the surrounding surface. The compound character of these papillae is due to each having projecting from it numerous small secondary papillse. The epithelial covering of the filiform papillae is characterised by the peculiar modification which the tessel- lated epithelium of the mouth has undergone; the cellsTHE TONGUE. 379' have become cornified and elongated into dense, imbricated brush-like processes. In the carnivora the epithelium is so hardened as to form sharp spines, with the points turned backwards, which give to the tongues of these animals a rough prickly character. In the fungiform and circumvallate papillae the inequalities between the pro- jecting secondary papillae are filled up by tessellated epi- thelium, so that the surface of the compound papillae has a smooth appearance. Both the simple and compound papillae are highly vascular; the lingual artery not only supplies the muscular substance of the tongue, but gives off fine branches to the mucous membrane. These branches end in capillaries, which form simple loops in the simple papillae, but in the compound papillae the capillaries are so multiplied that each secondary papilla ‘has a capillary loop within it. The tongue is provided with several nerves. The hypo-glossal nerve supplies its muscular structure, but the inferior lingualis is said by some anatomists to receive a branch from the chorda tympani of the facial. The lingual branch of the fifth is distributed to the mucous membrane of the anterior two-thirds of the tongue: it breaks up into minute branches, which enter the fungi- form and filiform papillae, but their exact mode of termi- nation has not been precisely ascertained, though end- bulbs and gustatory bodies are said to have been seen in connection with some of the terminal branches. The glossal branch of the glosso-pharyngeal is distributed to the mucous membrane of the root of the tongue and of the circumvallate papillae In connection with its terminal branches peculiar flask-shaped organs, called gustatory bulbs or bodies, have recently been described by Loven, Schwalbe,ANATOMY. 380 and Engelmann, in tlie sides of the circumvallate papillae. These bulbs have been found in large numbers in lamellated folds of the mucous membrane of the posterior part of the Fig. 112.—Section through a Gustatory lamella of the rabbit’s tongue.

When sections are made through one of these folds, or through a circumval- late papilla and the trench which surrounds it, numerous flask-shaped gustatory bulbs may be seen in the epithelium, which covers the side of the papilla and the opposite side of the trench. The bottom of each flask is next the sub-epithelial tissue, whilst its short neck opens on the surface by a mouth, the gustatory pore ; similar bodies, F10.113.—j, superficial though in much smaller numbers, have Gustatory bulb; g, also been seen in the fungiform papillfe. gustatory cell, with . « р, its peripheral, and Each gustatory body consists ot two cline- с, its central process. 0 1-77 rent forms of cells, named covering cells and gustatory cells. The covering cells are elongated, nu-THE TONGUE. 381 cleated spindles, which, arranged in layers, form the enve- lope of each gustatory bulb, and reach from the bottom to the mouth of the flask; they enclose the gustatory cells. The gustatory cells are attenuated, homogeneous, and highly refractile cells, which possess an elliptical nucleated body with two processes, a central and peripheral. These cells occupy the axis of the gustatory bulb. The peri- pheral process, broader than the central, sometimes ends in a short hair-like tip, which almost reaches the gus- tatory pore; the central process extends to the base of the flask, and often divides into small branches. This process is varicose, and not unlike the axial cylinder of a nerve fibre. The branches of the glosso-pharyngeal nerve, which are distributed to the back of the tongue, enter the circumvallate papillae, and form a minute plexus, with groups of nerve cells interspersed in it, from which bundles both of medullated and non-medullated fibres pass to the basis of the gustatory bulbs; and it is believed that the finest non-medullated fibres are continuous with the peripheral processes of the gustatory cells, which are there- fore regarded as the peripheral end-organs of the nerve of taste, and by the excitation of these bodies gustative or taste sensations are produced. As the glosso-pharyngeal is the nerve distributed to the circumvallate papillae, where these gustatory bulbs are especially found, it is therefore the special nerve of taste ; but as these bulbs have also been sparingly seen in the other papillae, where the lingual nerve is distributed, that nerve probably acts in a minor degree as a nerve of taste, though its special function is undoubtedly that of a nerve of touch. The gustatory bulbs are not penetrated by blood-vessels, but, as Fig. 112ANATOMY. 382 shows, the vascular sub-epithelial tissue is prolonged upwards along the sides of the bulbs almost as far as the plane of the gustatory pore. Key, Beale, and other observers have described special modifications of the epithelium in connection with the terminations of the gusta- tory nerves in the frog. The mucous membrane of the tongue contains numerous small tubular or branched glands, more especially on the dorsum near its root, which secrete mucus. Depressions also occur in this part of the mucous membrane, around the walls of which groups of lymphoid cells are collected in the sub-epithelial connective tissue, which have an arrangement closely resembling the structure of the adjacent tonsils, and form an example of adenoid tissue. The tongue arises as a bud-like process on the floor of the mouth of the embryo. It consists of mesoblast covered by the epiblast layer which lines the buccal chamber. From the epiblast is produced the epithelial covering, and in all probability the gustatory bulbs, whilst the mesoblast gives rise to the muscular, fibrous, vascular, and nervous structures. The Skin. The Skin, or Integument, invests the entire outer surface of the body, and contains structures by the excitation of which the properties of things are determined by the sense of touch. The skin also contains accessory structures, as the nails, hairs, sebaceous glands, and sweat glands. I he skin consists of a non-vascular cuticle or epidermis, and of a vascular and sensitive corium, or cutis vera. The Cuticle, Epidermis, or scarf skin, forms the outer383 THE SKIN. coveting of tlie skin, and protects the cutis. It is a laminated structure, and consists of numerous layers of cells superimposed on each other. As these cells cover a free surface exposed to the air, they belong to the group of epithelial tissues. The thickness of the cuticle varies in different localities from -^th to ^i^th inch ; where the skin is frequently exposed to pressure, as in the soles of the feet, the cuticle is the thickest and hardest; and the hands of those accustomed to manual labour have a hard and horny cuticle. The increase in thickness in these localities is for the purpose of protecting the highly sensi- tive cutis from injury. The outer surface of the cuticle in many parts of the body, especially the palm of the hand and the fingers, is marked by ridges and furrows ; the ridges indicate the position and arrangement of the papilla: of the cutis, whilst the furrows are due to the sinking of the cuticle into the spaces between the rows of papillae. The mouths of the sweat glands open on the surface of these ridges. The cuticle is divided into two strata. The super- ficial’ horny stratum consists of layers of flat, polygonal scales like a tessellated epithelium; the cells in the superimposed layers firmly adhere to each other by their surfaces, and in vertical sections this stratum presents a fibrous appearance ; but the cells may be readily isolated by digestion in a caustic alkali. The deeper or mucous stratum, or rete Malpighii, lies next the cutis, and closely follows the undulations of its papillary surface. The cells forming the layer next the cutis are columnar in shape, those in the layers immediately succeeding are rounded or cubical, whilst those next in order are polygonal, and not unfrequently possess pointed processes or prickles projecting from them, hence the384 ANATOMY. name, prickle cells, employed by Schultze. The cells which lie next the horny stratum assume the scale-like form. It is in the. cells of the mucous stratum that the colouring matter of the skin is found, which in the fair races of men forms the isolated coloured spots called frecldes and moles, but in the dark races the pigment granules are uniformly distributed through the cells of this stratum. The super- ficial cells of the horny stratum of the cuticle are continually being shed, so that the cells of the deeper layers gradually approach the surface, and new cells are continually being formed in the deeper part of the rete Malpighii. The cuticle is closely adherent to the cutis in the healthy living skin, but on the application of a blister, or when putrefac- tion sets in after death, they separate from each other. The Cutis vera.—When the cuticle is removed the surface of the cutis is seen to be studded with multitudes of minute elevations, the papillae of the skin. These papillae are either simple conical structures, or compound with two or three branches. They are largest in the palm and sole, being from to ^th of an inch high, and are arranged in ridges, but more usually they are much shorter and irregularly distributed. The cutis is formed of connec- tive3 tissue, in which stellate connective tissue corpuscles and elastic fibres are abundant. The deeper surface of the connective tissue of the cutis is reticulated, and is continu- ous with the bundles of connective tissue that form the areolar subcutaneous tissue. In the papillae themselves the fibres of the connective tissue are not so well marked, and the surface of the papillae possesses more of a homoge- neous aspect, which gives rise to the appearance described as a basement membrane. Ihe cutis is highly \aseu385 THE SKIN. lar; the small arteries which go to the skin give off branches to the lobules of fat in the subcutaneous tissue, then pene- trate the cutis, and form a plexus from which capillaries arise, which enter the papillae, and form vascular loops within them.

The nerves of the skin are the cutaneous branches both of the spinal and 2 BANATOMY 386 of certain of the cranial nerves, the origin and distribution of which have already been described. They run through the subcutaneous tissue, and enter the deep surface of the cutis, where they divide into branches. As these pass towards the papillae they unite to form a nerve plexus, from which smaller branches arise to enter the papillse, and terminate, more especially in the skin of the palm of the hand, fingers, and sole, which are the surfaces most sensi- tive to touch impressions, in the tactile or touch coi'puscles. The touch corpuscles discovered by Wagner and Meissner are the peripheral end-organs of the nerves of touch (Fig. 114). They may be single or compound; are usually ovoid inform, not unlike a minute fir cone; and are transversely marked, from the transverse direction of the nuclei of the fusiform cells which form an investing capsule. Each single corpuscle and each division of a compound corpuscle is penetrated by one, and, according to Thin, by never more than one, medullated nerve fibre, but the exact mode of termination of the axial cylinder of the fibre has not been ascertained. Virchow and other German observers have stated that the papillse which contain capillaries do not contain nerves or touch cbrpuscles, and vice versa ; but Dalzell and Thin have shown that certainly the majority of papillse that contain nerve fibres and touch corpuscles are also vascular papillae. Non-medullated nerve fibres ascend to the surface of the cutis, and, according to Lan gerhans, pass into the rete Malpighii between the cells of the mucous layer. Nails.—On the back of the last phalanx of each thumb, finger, and toe is situated a firm horny curved plate, the nail. Each nail rests on a bed, the surface of u Inch is387 THE SKIN. formed of the cutis, which also overlaps the side and root of the nail; thus the nail fits into a groove formed of the cutis something after the manner in which a watch-glass fits into its rim. A nail is merely a special modifica- tion of the cuticle, the cells of the superficial stratum of which are more horny, harder, and more firmly adherent to each other than is the case in the cuticle proper. Deeper than the horny stratum is the rete Malpighii of the nail, the cells of which are soft, as in the cuticle itself. The cutis forming the bed of the nail is studded with papillae, which are arranged in almost parallel rows, and are highly vascular. Nails grow both in length and thickness : the increase in thickness is due to the formation of nerve cells on the bed of the nail; the increase in length takes place through the formation of nail cells at its root, and as the nail is thus slowly pushed forward it requires to be cut at intervals. At the root, sides, and below the free border of the nail the cuticle is continuous with the substance of the nail itself. Hair.—Projecting from the surface of the skin are multi- tudes of elongated cylindrical horny structures, the hairs. In the skin of the scalp, the armpits, and the pubis, they are long and numerous; but in the eye-brows, eye-lashes, vibrissse of the nostrils, and surface of the body generally, they are short. They are stronger and thicker in the skin of man than of woman, more especially on the cheeks, lips, and chin. Hairs do not grow from the skin of the palms and soles, the back of the ungual phalanges, and the surface of the upper eye-lids. Each hair is partially im- bedded in a depression of the skin, called a hair follicle. The deeper end of the follicle is somewhat dilated, and has in it aANATOMY. 388 ' papilla, tlie hair papilla. The wall of the hair follicle is formed of the constituent structures of the skin ; the outer part of the wall belongs to the cutis, and has been described as arranged in three layers, the external, middle, and inner layer of the hair follicle. The external and middle layers are formed of connective tissue, with blood-vessels ; whilst the inner, sometimes called the vitreous layer, is transparent and homogeneous, and continuous with the so-called base- ment membrane of the cutis. The inner part of the wall of the hair follicle, or the root-sheath, belongs to the cuticle, and consists of two layers, the outer and inner root-sheaths. The outer root-sheath is continuous with the rete Malpighii, and consists of cells similar to those of that stratum. The inner root-sheath is continuous with the horny stratum of the cuticle, and consists of elongated scale-like translucent cells in which no nuclei can be seen. A hair possesses a root, a shaft, and a tip; the root is imbedded in the hair follicle, whilst the shaft and tip form the free projecting part of the hair. In the human hair the substance of the hair is composed of a y?6?'o>«-looking horny material, which by the action of strong sulphuric acid is resolved into elongated, closely compacted, fusiform cells, which in coloured hairs contain pigment granules. In the thicker hairs the cells in the axis of the hair are polygonal, contain air, and form a central pith or medulla. The hail is invested , by imbricated scale-like cells, which form the hair cuticle. In different animals the size and relative pro- portion of the cells of the cuticle, medulla, and fibrous part of the hair present many modifications. The wool of the sheep has its cuticle scales, with well-defined serrated margins, so that the hair of this animal is well adapted forTHE SKIN. • :■ • 389 felting into cloth ; in the bat, also, the cuticle cells are large and strongly serrated. The bristles Qf the-pig, again, have the fibrous part of the hair largely- developed. In the deer tribe the hair consists of polygonal medulla-like cells, which contain air. The root of the hair dilates at its deeper end into a bulb which embraces the hair papilla. It-is softer in texture than the shaft, so that the cellular structure of the hair is more easily demonstrated. Next the papilla the cells are like those of the rete Malpighii, but when traced onwards to the shaft they are seen to become differentiated, both in structure and composition, into the proper hair cells. The root is enveloped in a special sheath, termed the sheath of Huxley, composed of nucleated cells, which sheath, in the more superficial part of the follicle, blends with the internal root-sheath. The hair papilla bears to the hair the same relation as a papilla of the cutis has to its investing cuticle, so that a hair is to be regarded as a specially modified cuticular structure. The human hair-papilla is vascular, but no nerves have been traced into it. In the tactile hairs of the mammalia, how- ever, nerves have been traced into their papillae. The bristles, feathers, claws, hoofs, the horny envelope of the horn coi'es in the hollow horned ruminants, and various tegumentary spines and scales, present in many animals, are, like hairs and nails, special modifications of the tegumentary system. Each hair follicle has opening into it the excretory duct of .a small gland, named a sebaceous gland. This gland consists of the excretory duct, and of from two to twenty grape-like saccular expansions which open into the duct, ike wall of the sacculi and of the duct is continuous with390 ANATOMY. the vitreous layer of the outer wall of the hair follicle. Capillary blood-vessels are distributed on the outer wall of the sacculi. The sacculi are almost entirely filled with polygonal cells containing drops of fat, which cells are continuous with the epithelial lining of the gland duct and the cells of the outer root-sheath. These glands secrete a fatty material, which lubricates the surface of the hair. Sometimes a small parasite, called Acarus folliculorum, is found in a sebaceous gland. Some years ago Kolliker described one or two bundles of smooth muscular fibres extending from the wall of the hair follicle to the deep surface of the cutis; these muscles, named arrectores pili, by their contraction erect the hairs, that is, cause them to become more prominent, and produce the condition of skin, called cutis cinserina or goose skin, well known to occur when cold is applied to the surface of the body. Hairs are developed about the 4th month of emoryo life, within depressions in the cutis, which form the future hair follicles, filled with cells similar to, and continuous with the epiblast cells of the rete MalpighiL A papilla forms at the bottom of this depression, around which the cells Decome arranged in a bulbous expansion. The cells, in line with the bulb, elongate and harden, and group themselves so as to form the shaft of the young hair, which at this stage is completely buried within the follicle. A rapid production of new cells takes place at the bulb, the hair consequently increases in length, and is pushed outwards through the superficial horny stratum of the cuticle, which had closed in the mouth of the depression or follicle in which the hair is produced. At the same time, the more external cells391 THE SKIN. within the follicle are pushed outwards towards its wall, and form the cells of the root-sheath. When a hair is pulled out of its follicle the cells of the root-sheath are drawn out along with it. A new hair will be developed at the bottom of a follicle from which the hair has been shed as long as cells continue to be formed around the papilla. When the growth of cells ceases within the hair follicles then permanent baldness is the result. The sebaceous glands are developed as bud-like offshoots from the hair follicles, filled, like the follicles themselves, with cells continuous with the epiblast cells of the rete Malpighii. Instead ;of the cells in these buds differentiat- ing into a hair, they become filled with fatty particles, and the wall of the bud assumes the characteristic sacculated form of the gland. SuiecU Glands, or sudoriparous glands, are found generally distributed throughout the skin, but are most abundant in the palms and soles, where they number 2500 to 3000 in each square inch. In the skin of the back, again, there are only between 400 and 500 in the square inch. Each gland consists of a ball-like body lying in the subcutaneous tissue, from which a tubular duct proceeds through the ekin to open on its free surface. The ball is composed of a convoluted tube continuous with the tubular duct, and terminating in a blind end. The wall of the gland’tube consists of a delicate nucleated membrane fined by columnar secreting cells. It is surrounded by connective tissue containing capillary blood-vessels. As the gland-duct pierces the cutis it passes between the papilla- in its course through the cuticle it pursues a spiral direction, and has its walls formed, not of a distinct membrane, but of the cuticleANATOMY. ■> 392 cells themselves. The epithelial lining of the duct ls continuous with the cells of the rete Malpighii of the cuticle. In the axilla and groin the sweat glands are much larger than in the skin generally. The sweat glands arise as flask-shaped pouches of the rete Malpighii projecting into the cutis, which in course of time become elongated into tubes, and the cells contained in which become the secreting cells of the gland. The cutis, with its vascular and nervous structures, is produced by a differentiation of the cells of the meso- blast. The two layers of the epidermis, with the cellular prolongations into the hair follicles, sebaceous glands, and sweat glands, are differentiations of the cells of the epiblast.f 4 r

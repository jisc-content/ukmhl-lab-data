Continuation of Note, -page 5. The great objeft, however, fhould be, to eradicate en- tirely all rabid infection. The human fpecies, happily, does not communicate the difeafe like rabid animals; but he will carry infe&ion in his habit much longer than them, before it exhibit its dreadful effeffs. Within twelve months, I have known two perfons die hydrophobic, about eleven months after the bite of the animal: Some Authors mention years; but, in general, the fymptoms fhew themfelves within a few weeks* of the accident. Dogs, I believe, never exceed fix weeks, and rarely as many days. In order, therefore, to eradicate the difeafe out of the kingdom for ever, nothing more feems requi- fite, than, at any period of the year mofl convenient to dog-owners, to fhut up every dog in the kingdom for feven weeks ; in which time, every one having received rabid matter, would evince it, and of courfe be killed. The infection being thus annihilated, to prevent its en- trance into the kingdom, in future, every fhip having a dog on board, upon entering any Britifh harbour, mufl fubmit to the fame reffraint, of fubjefting the dog to feven weeks quarantine. Thus, perhaps, at an expence under fifty pounds, Canine Madnefs might for ever be ^excluded from this maritime kingdom. If Cats could be confined to the fame quarantine, it would be advife- able ; but, probably, this animal receives the infeÂ£lion only from the dog. The above plan was fuggefted to me, I think, by my friend Dr. Bardfley, #

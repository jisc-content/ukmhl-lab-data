In confequence of this matter refembling fperma ceti recently found in the church yard of the Innocents at Paris, M. Fourcroy has given an analyfis of it, in the eighth volume of the Annales de Chemie, Memoir the fecond. The method of effefling this change with facility, is fince defcribed by Mr. Gibbes, in the Philofophical Tranfaftions of London. In June he buried a cow, in a place where, from the riling of a river to fupply a mill twice a day, it was fubmitted to the aflion ot running water.

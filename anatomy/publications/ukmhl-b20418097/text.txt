Call No. wel^^OrnecEDITOR'S PEBFACE This Treatise on Human Anatomy is designed for the use of Students preparing for the Conjoint Board of the Royal Colleges of Physicians and Surgeons, for the Fellowship of the Eoyal College of Surgeons, and for the Examinations in Anatomy at the various Universities. It aims at being a complete and systematic description of every part and organ of the human body so far as it is studied in the dissecting room. Histology and development—except the mode and dates of development of the bones, and in a few other instances—are not included, as it is felt that these subjects are more appropriately dealt with in books on Physiology than they can conveniently be in works on Anatomy. The different sections have been written by separate Authors who are known to have devoted special attention to the subjects allotted to them. To these gentlemen my best thanks are due for their generous assistance and able co-operation. Whilst each Author is alone responsible for the subject-matter of the article which follows his name, the proof-sheets of other articles besides his own have in certain cases been submitted to him, so that several of the articles may be considered to have received the approval and endorsement of two, three, or more Authors. This has been particularly the case with the sections on Osteology, Arthrology, Myology, and Neurology. There is, therefore, reason to believe that such important points as the attachments of ligaments and of muscles, and the nerve-supply of muscles, etc., will be found to be in perfect accord in the various sections in which they are referred to or described. In the illustrations of the bones, the origins of muscles are indicated by red lines, the insertions by blue lines, and the attachments of ligaments by dotted black lines. A feature of the work which, it is confidently hoped, will facilitate the work of students, is the mode of describing the illustrations.vi PBEFACE This plan was decided upon at a conference of all the Authors and one of the artists. It consists in printing the descriptions in different types at the end of the pointers. Thus it will be found that muscles, fasciae, and ligaments are in one kind of type ; arteries, veins, and lymphatics in another ; bones in a third; and nerve-structures in a fourth. The names of special organs—such as the liver, lungs, etc.—are printed in the same type as the bones, so as to avoid too great a variety of lettering. Several of the illustrations are repeated in different parts of the book, with the object of sparing the reader the trouble of referring from one section to another when reference is made in the letterpress to such figures. As much uniformity as possible has been observed in the size and gen- eral style of the drawings; but exceptions will be found in the section on Surgical and Topographical Anatomy, for which many of the illustrations have been borrowed from another work published by Messrs. J. and A. Churchill, namely, Bellamy's ' Surgical Anatomy.' I have to acknowledge with grateful thanks the assistance I have received from Mr. Goedon Brodie, who made several dissections from which drawings were taken ; from Mr. J. Bland Sutton and Mr. Frank Steele in reading over proof-sheets; from Mr. Burghard for the care with which he has drawn up the Index and Tables of Contents ; and from all the artists named on the title-page. Mr. Berjeau and Mr. Balcomb have drawn a very large proportion of the figures ; and, with Mr. Smit and Mr. Parker, have shown a degree of interest in, and given an amount of time and trouble to the illustrations for which they merit the fullest recognition. The beautiful anatomical dissections in the Hunterian Museum which have been, by permission, copied for this Treatise, are from the hand of Mr. William Pearson, to whose great skill in dissecting I have much pleasure in referring. Too much praise ca^nnot be given to all engaged in the actual printing of the book for the painstaking care they have devoted to it; especially to the difficult and precise work of properly * registering' and printing the coloured illustrations. I need only say, in conclusion, that I shall not consider my prolonged and laborious task has been in vain if it be found that the Treatise adequately meets the requirements of Students, for whom it is written.

ASSISTANT-SURGEON TO THE MIDDLESEX HOSPITAL, LONDON THE SKELETON THE skeleton contains 206 distinct bones. They are arranged by anatomists in two sets :—the bones of the trunk and the bones of the limbs. The skeleton of the trunk is made up of the skull, which contains twenty-nine bones exclusive of the teeth; the vertebral column consisting of twenty-six separate bones; twenty-four ribs, and the sternum. The skeleton of the upper limbs comprises sixty-four bones ; and that of the lower limb, including the patella, sixty-two. Several of the skull bones are compound, that is, in the immature skeleton they consist of separate elements which ultimately unite to form a single bone. In order to comprehend the nature of such bones, it is necessary to examine them in the various stages through which they pass in the embryo and child. Thus the student, anxious to convince himself of Man's place in nature, studies carefully the development and ossification of bones, and compares them with the bones of other Vertebrata. He then finds that many elements which make a compound bone are osteological units for the Comparative Anatomist. Comparisons of this nature constitute the science of Morphology, one of the most fascinating departments of Biology. It is the duty of the student to follow the descriptions with the actual bones in his hand. He should also remember that many variations occur in the outlines and markings of bones. Hence the various types described and figured represent the average of a large number of bones examined. It is very rare to meet with bones which accurately correspond to the description in every detail. In order to appreciate the morphology of the skeleton, the osteogenesis or mode of development of bones must be studied as well as their topography or position. Some bones arise by ossification in membrane, others in cartilage. In the early embryo, many portions of the skeleton are represented by cartilage which becomes infiltrated by lime salts—calcification. This earthy material is taken up and redeposited in a regular manner—ossification. Portions of the original cartilage persist at the articular ends of bones, and, in young bones, at the epiphysial lines. Long bones increase in length at the epiphysial cartilages, and increase in thickness by ossification of the deeper layers of the investing membrane or periosteum. These processes—intercartilaginous and intermembranous ossifica- tion—proceed concurrently in the limb-bones of a young and growing mammal. There is no bone in the human skeleton which, though pre-formed in cartilage, is perfected in this tissue. The ossification is completed in membrane. On the BTHE SKELETON 2 other hand, there are numerous instances in the skull, of hones the ossification of which hegins in, and is perfected hy, the intermemhranous method. Ossification in a few instances commences in membrane, hut later invades tracts of cartilage ; occasionally the process begins in perichondrium and remains restricted to it, never invading the underlying cartilage, which gradually disappears as the result of continued pressure exerted upon it by the growing bone. The vomer and nasal bones are the best examples of this mode of development. A Classified List of the Bones to show theie Mode of Development 1. All the limb-bones and those of the vertebral column are pre-formed in carti- lage and perfected in membrane, with the exception of the clavicles. These begin in membrane, proceed in cartilage, and are finally perfected in membrane. 2. The Skull. Parietals. Frontal. Squamosals. Maxillae. Malar s. Palates. Nasals.

Hyoid. Malars. Ethmoid. Sphenoid. Mandible. The details of the development and ossification of each bone are added to the description. The limb-bones differ in several important particulars from those of the skull. Some of the long bones have many centres of ossification, but the centres are of very different morphological value to those of the skull. Speaking generally, it is only the primary nuclei that have any especial value for the morphologist. The primary nucleus of a long bone appears before birth. In only three instances does a secondary centre appear before birth ; e.g. the condyles of the femur, the head of the tibia, and occasionally in the head of the humerus. Many primary ossific nuclei appear after birth; for example, those for the carpal bones, the cuneiform and scaphoid bones of the foot, the coracoid, and the third, fourth and fifth pieces of the sternum. When a bone ossifies from one nucleus only, this nucleus may appear before or after birth. Examples : the astragalus at the seventh month of embryonic life, and the trapezoid at the eighth year. When a bone possesses one or more3 OSSIFICATION—BULES OF EPIPHYSES secondary centres, the primary nucleus, as a rule, appears early. Examples: the femur, humerus, phalanges, and the calcaneum. Secondary centres which remain for a time distinct from the main portion of a bone are termed epiphyses. An epiphysis may arise from a single nucleus, as is the case with the lower end of the femur; or from several, as at the upper end of the humerus. Prominences about the ends of long bones may be capped by separate epiphyses, as is the case at the upper end of the femur. Epiphyses, though of no morphological value, seem to follow certain rules, thus :— Fig. 1.—The Tibia and Fibula in section to show the Epiphyses. 1. Those epiphyses which appear last are the first to unite with the shaft. Exception.—The distal epiphysis of the fibula is visible three years before the proximal, but fuses with the shaft much earlier than it. It should be remembered that the proximal end of the fibula in man and many mammals is vestigial. 2. The epiphysis towards which the nutrient artery is directed unites first with the shaft. b2 14 THE SKELETON I 3. When a bone has only one epiphysis, the nutrient artery is directed towards the extremity which has no epiphysis. 4. The centres of ossification appear earhest for those epiphyses which bear the largest relative proportion to the shafts of the bones to which they belong. 5. When an epiphysis ossifies from more than one centre, the various nuclei coalesce before the shaft and epiphysis consolidate. On section the shaft of a foetal long bone is found occupied with red marrow lodged in bony cells which do not present any definite arrangement. In an adult, the central portion of the shaft of a long bone is filled with fat, or marrow, held together by a delicate reticulum of connective tissue ; the space containing the marrow is the medullary cavity. The expanded ends of the bone contain a network of cancellous tissue, the spaces being filled with red marroiu. This cancellous tissue differs from that of the foetal bone in that it is arranged in a definite manner according to the direction of pressure and tension exerted by muscles. Pressure lines are well shown in the vertebra. In a vertical section through the centrum of a vertebra the fibres of the cancellous tissue are seen to be arranged vertically and horizontally ; the vertical fibres are curved with their concavities directed towards the centre of the bone. The horizontal fibres are slightly curved parallel with the Fig. 2.—A Vertebral Centrum in section to show the Pressure Curves. upper and lower surfaces, with their convexities towards the centre of the bone. They are not so defined as the vertical set. (Wagstaffe.) The arrangement of the cancelli in individual bones is a consequence of the mechanical conditions to which the bone is subject. This is well illustrated in the femur. In the upper end of this bone the cancellous tissue is arranged in divergent curves. One set springs from the inner wall and spreads into the greater trochanter; a second series of curves crosses this and forms a set of Gothic arches, and is continued into the neck and head ; a third set springs from the lower thick wall of the neck and spreads into the upper part of the head, and ends perpen- dicularly in the articular surface mainly along the lines of greatest pressure. A nearly vertical plane of compact tissue projects into the neck of the bone from the inferior cervical tubercle towards the great trochanter. This is placed in the line through which the weight of the body falls, and adds to the stabihty of the neck of the bone : it is said to be liable to absorption in old age. In the lower end of the bone the vertical and horizontal fibres are so disposed as to form a rectangular meshwork. The plan of construction exhibited by the femur is the most complex in the skeleton, but the principles involved are the same in all bones. An interesting disposition of these curves is exhibited in the head of the humerus. The pressure curves radiate in two directions : one set at right angles to the articular surface of the head of the bone ; the other at right angles to the greater tuberosity. The last set, like those in the trochanter, are the result of tension exerted by the muscles attached to these prominences. The shafts of long bones at the time of birth are mainly cylindrical and free from ridges. The majority of the lines and ridges so conspicuous on the shafts of5 THE SPINE long bones in adults are due to the ossification of muscle-attachments. The more developed the muscles, the larger the ridges become. The surfaces of bones are variously modified by environing conditions. Pressure at the extremities causes enlargement, and movement renders them smooth. The two causes combined produce an articular surface. When rounded and supported Fig. 3.—A Diagram to show the Fig. 4.—A Diagram showing Pressure and Tension Curves of Pressure and Tension Curves THE Femur. (After Wagstaffe.) in the Head of the Humerus. (After Wagstaffe.) upon a constricted portion of bone, an articular surface is termed a head, sometimes a condyle; when depressed, a glenoid fossa. Blunt, non-articular processes are called tuberosities ; smaller ones, tubercles ; sharp projections, spines. Slightly elevated ridges of bones are crests; when narrow and pronounced, lines and borders. A shallow depression is a fossa; when narrow and deep, a g^roove ; a perforation is usually called a foramen. The majority of terms—such as canal, spine, notch, sulcus, and the like—are so obvious as to render explanation needless. THE SPINE The spine (vertebral column) consists of thirty-three superimposed bones termed vertebrae. Of these the upper twenty-four remain separate throughout life and form three groups. The first seven are called cervical, the succeeding twelve thoracic (dorsal), and the last five lumbar. In adult life the last nine vertebras ankylose to form two composite bones named the sacrum and the coccyx. The sacrum is formed by the fusion of five vertebraB from the twenty-fifth to the twenty-ninth inclusive ; the four terminal are vestigial, and form the coccyx. In order to gain a general notion of the characters of a vertebra, it is desirable to select a bone from the middle of the thoracic series.THE SKELETON c A vertebra presents the following parts : The body or centrum is a solid disc of bone slightly concave on its superior and inferior aspects, and wider transversely than antero-posteriorly. The upper and loAver surfaces are rough for intervertebral discs, and the margins are slightly lipped. The circumference of the body is, in front, concave vertically, but convex from side to side ; posteriorly it is excavated, and presents foramina for the escape of veins from the cancellous tissue. On the Fig. 5.—A Thoracic Vertebra. (Side view.) DEMI-FACET FOR HEAD OF RIB SUPERIOR ARTICULAR PROCESS' FACET FOR TUBERCLE OF R TRANSVERSE PROCESS sides of the body, at the upper and lovvW angles, there are four demi-facets ; when two vertebra are superimposed, the adjacent demi-facets form a complete articular facet for the head of a rib. The pedicles are two constricted short piers of bone projecting horizontally backw^ards from the upper angles of the posterior surface. The lower border of Fig. 6.—A Thoracic Vertebra. FACET FOR TUBERCLE OF RIB DEMI-FACET FOR HEAD OF RIB each pedicle is deeply notched ; hence, when two vertebrae are in position the notches are converted into intervertebral foramina for the transmission of spinal nerves and vessels. The laminae are broad plates of bone continuous with the pedicles ; eachTHE CEBVICAL VEBTEBB^ 7 « lamina meets its fellow dorsally to complete the neural arch, and conjointly form the spinous process. The superior borders of the lamina are rough for the insertion of ligamenta subflava. The anterior surface, in its upper part, is smooth where it bounds the neural canal. The lower part is rough for the origin of the ligamenta subflava. This rough surface is continuous with the inferior border of the spinous process. The spinous process projects backwards and downwards from the confluent laminaB. To its upper and lower borders the interspinous ligaments are attached ; its tip is rounded for the supraspinous ligament. It is mainly a muscular process. The articular processes are four in number : two are superior and have the articular facets directed backwards with a slight outward tendency ; their ante- rior surfaces complete the intervertebral foramina; posteriorly their margins give attachment to capsular ligaments. The inferior articular processes are slightly concave oval facets on the lower and outer angles of the anterior surface of the laminae. They are directed forwards and slightly inwards. The transverse processes are two in number, and jut outwards from the lamina between the superior and inferior articular processes. The tip presents an oval facet for articulation with the tubercle of the rib. When the rib is in situ its neck forms with the process a costo-transverse foramen. The transverse processes, in addition to supporting the ribs, afford powerful leverage to muscles. THE CERVICAL VEETEBE^ A typical cervical vertebra (from the third to sixth inclusive) presents the following characters. The centrum is smaller than in other regions of the column, and is of oval shape, the major axis being transverse. The upper surface has its lateral margins raised into prominent lips, whilst the lower surface is somewhat concave, its anterior margin being lipped so as to slightly overlap the anterior Fig. 7.—A Cervical Vertebra.

The inferior lateral margins are rounded, and come into relation with the raised edges of the centrum next below. The pedicles are directed obliquely outwards, and the intervertebral notch is narrower above than below. The laminae are long and narrow. The spinous pro- cess is short, and bifid at the extremity. The superior articular processes look backwards and upwards ; the inferior are directed forwards and downwards. The transverse process presents near its base the costo-transverse foramen for the transmission of the vertebral artery, vein, and a plexus of sympathetic nerves.8 THE SKELETON The process behind the foramen has a shallow groove for the corresponding spinal nerve. The extremity of the transverse process is bifid; each arm is terminated by a tubercle referred to as anterior and posterior. The costo-transverse foramen is very characteristic of a cervical vertebra. It is bounded posteriorly by the pedicle, externally by the rudimentary transverse process, and anteriorly by a narrow bar of bone springing from the centrum posterior to the neuro-central suture. This thin bar is a vestigial rib, and will be referred to as the costal process. The spinal foramen of all the cervical vertebrae is large, and somewhat triangular in form. Peculiar cervical vertebrse.— The various cervical vertebrae possess distinguish- ing features. The first, second, and seventh have characters so different from their fellows as to render them peculiar. The Atlas This vertebra has neither body nor spinous process ; it is an irregular ring of bone with two thicker portions, the lateral masses, united anteriorly by a bridge, the anterior arch, which constitutes one-fifth of the entire circumference. This arch presents a tubercle on its anterior face for the anterior vertebral ligament and the longiis colli muscle ; its posterior surface has a circular facet for the odontoid process of the axis. The upper and lower borders are for ligaments. The lateral masses are united posteriorly by a larger arch of bone, forming two-fifths of the circumference. Posteriorly this arch has a tubercle, representing a rudimentary spinous process. The upper and under surfaces of the arch afford Fig. 8.—The First Cervical Vertebra or Atlas, anterior tubercle superior articular process- costal process costo-transverse foramen transverse process groove for vertebral artery POSTERIOR TUBERCLE attachment to ligaments. At the junction of the arch with the lateral masses there is, on the upper surface, a deep groove which lodges the vertebral artery and the suboccipital (first spinal) nerve. A. bridge of bone sometimes con- verts this into a foramen. A similar, but much shallower, notch is present on the under surface ; this, with the axis, forms an intervertebral foramen for the second nerve. The atlas and axis are peculiar in that the first and second spinal nerves issue behind the articular processes, whereas the remaining spinal nerves emerge in front of the articular facets of the vertebrae. Each lateral mass has, on its upper surface, an elongated, deeply concave articular fossa or cup. These articular cups converge anteriorly. Occasionally each presents two oval facets united by an isthmus. These cups receive the occipital condyles and permit nodding movements of the head. The inferior articular processes are circular and almost flat; they are directed downwards, with an inclination inwards, and rest upon the axis, and permit rotatory movements of the head. Between the upperEXCEPTIONAL GEBVIGAL VEBTEBB^ 9 and lower articular surfaces on the inside of the ring two tubercles exist for the transverse ligament. This ligament divides the space within the ring into an anterior smaller segment for the odontoid process of the axis, and a larger portion —the spinal foramen of other vertebra—for the spinal cord and its membranes. The transverse processes are large, to serve for the attachment of muscles which help to rotate the head. The costo-transverse foramina are large, but the costal processes are slender. The Axis The Axis is easily recognised by the large rounded odontoid process which surmounts its upper surface. The centrum has a more prominent lip than the other cervical vertebrae, and the anterior surface has a median ridge separating two lateral depressions. The odontoid process is an irregularly rounded peg of bone. The anterior surface has an oval facet for the anterior arch of the atlas. Posteriorly it presents a deeply cut smooth groove for the transverse ligament. To the apex a thin narrow Fig. 9.—The Axis. JFERIOR ARTICULAR PROCESS FACET FOR ATLAS SUPERIOR ARTICULAR PROCESS COSTO-TRANSVERSE FORAMEN DY COSTAL PROCESS fibrous band (the suspensory ligament) is attached. On each side of the apex there is an oblique facet for the check ligaments which connect it with the occipital bone. The pedicles are stout and broad ; they support the oval, upwardly directed, articular surfaces for the atlas. The inferior articular surfaces do not differ from the cervical type. The transverse are smaller than the costal processes. The spinous process is stout and strong, deeply concave on its under aspect, and affords firm attachment for muscles, especially those which help to rotate the head. The Seventh Cekvical Veetebea This vertebra has a longer spinous process than any other cervical vertebra, hence it is sometimes called vertebra prominens. The extremity of this process is not bifid, but has two small lateral tubercles which give attachment to the liga- mentum nuch^e. The transverse processes are of large size ; the costal processes are very small; and the costo-transverse foramina are the smallest of the series. Very frequently the costal process is segmented off, and constitutes a cervical rib, sometimes of large size. Occasionally a demi-facet exists on each side of the lower border of the centrum for the head of the first rib. When this demi-facet is present, there is usually a well-developed cervical rib. The cervical vertebrfe also exhibit great variation in regard to the extremitiesTHE SKELETON 10 of their spinous processes. As a rule among Europeans, the second, third, fourth, and fifth vertebrae possess bifid spines. The sixth and seventh exhibit a tendency to bifurcate, their tips presenting two small lateral tubercles ; sometimes the sixth has a bifid spine, and more rarely the seventh presents the same condition. Occasionally all the cervical spines, with the exception of the second, are non-bifid, and even in the axis the bifurcation is not extensive. In the lower races of men the cervical spines are relatively shorter and more stunted than in Europeans generally, and, as a rule, are simple.

The laminc^ of the lower cervical vertebrae frequently present over the inferior articular processes distinct tubercles from which fascicuH of the multifidus spince muscle arise. They are usually confined to the sixth and seventh vertebrae, but are fandy frequent on the fifth, and are occasionally seen on the fourth.

Their most distinguishing features are the Fig. 12.—Peculiar Thoracic Vertebrae. (Modified from Gray.) AN ENTIRE FACET ABOVE; A DEMI- FACET BELOW.

Peculiar thoracic vertebrae.—Several vertebrae in this series differ from the type form. The exceptional are—the first, ninth, tenth, eleventh, and twelfth.LUMBAR VEBTEBB^ 13 The first has a body resembling a cervical vertebra, the upper surface being concave and lipped laterally; it has two entire facets above for the first pair, and two demi-facets below for the second pair of ribs. The spinous process is thick, strong, almost horizontal, and more prominent than the vertebra prominens. Occasionally the transverse process is perforated near its root. The ninth has demi-facets above, and usually none below; when the inferior demi-facets are present, this vertebra is not exceptional. The tenth usually has an entire costal facet at its upper border, on each side, but occasionally only demi-facets. It has no lower demi-facets, and the facets on the transverse processes are usually small. The eleventh has a large body resembling a lumbar vertebra. The rib facets are on the pedicles ; they are complete and of large size. The transverse processes are short and have no facets for the tubercles of the eleventh pair of ribs. In many mammals the spines of the anterior vertebrae are directed backwards, and those of the posterior directed forwards ; in the centre of the column there is usually one spine vertical. This is called the anti-clinal vertebra. It is at this point that the thoracic begin to assume the characters of lumbar vertebrae. In man, the eleventh thoracic is the anti-clinal vertebra. The twelfth resembles in general characters the eleventh, but may be distin- guished from it in having the inferior articular processes convex and turned outwards as in the lumbar vertebrae. It also resembles a lumbar vertebra by possessing well-marked mammillary and accessory tubercles. These tubercles are occasionally present on the tenth and eleventh vertebrae. A peculiarity, more frequent in the thoracic and lumbar than in the cervical and sacral regions of the column, is the existence of a half-vertebra. Such speci- mens have a wedge-shaped half-centrum, to which are attached a lamina, a transverse, superior and inferior articular, and half a spinous process. As a rule, a half-vertebra is ankylosed to the vertebrae above and below. The distinguishing features of lumbar vertebrae are their large size; the margins of the centrum are prominent; the pedicles are stout and strong ; the LUMBAE VEETEBRiE Fig. 13.—A Lumbar Vertebra. (Side view.) SUPERIOR ARTICULAR PROCESS -ACCESSORY PROCESS inferior intervertebral notches are deep, and the laminae are thick and strong. The superior articular processes have concave facets directed backwards andTHE SKELETON 14 inwards, and their posterior borders are surmounted by rounded mammillary processes or tubercles. The inferior articular processes have facets which look forwards and outwards. The transverse processes are long, slender, and each presents near the base, on the posterior aspect, a small accessory tubercle. The spinous processes are thick, broad, and project horizontally backward. Fig. 14.—A Lumbar Vertebra. (Showinf? the compound nature of the transverse process. Upper view.) Fig. 15.—Variation in the Fifth Lumbar Vertebra. (After Turner.) The transverse processes of the lumbar vertebrae are more complex than they at first appear. Each is compounded of a f TcinsveTse and a costalptocess. The accessoTy pTocess represents the tip of the partially suppressed transverse process, and the part in front is an undifferentiated rib. Between the transverse and costal elements some large vascular foramina are usually present, representing the costo-transverse foramina of other vertebrae. Occasionally the costal element differentiates and becomes a well-developed lumbar rib.LUMBAB VEBTEBB^ 15 A glance at the spine will show that the accessory tubercles are in line with the thoracic transverse processes, and the costal elements are in series with the ribs (see also fig'. 29). The fifth lumbar vertebra has several distinguishing features. The centrum is much thicker in front than behind. The inferior articular processes are widely separated to articulate with the first sacral vertebra. The transverse processes are of large size, and the spinous process is small. Fig. 16. —a Variation in the Fifth Lumbar Vertebra. (After Turner.) The pedicles of this vertebra are liable to a remarkable deviation from the conditions found in other parts of the spine. The peculiarity consists of a complete solution in the continuity of ihe arch immediately behind the superior articular processes. In such specimens the anterior part consists of the body carrying the pedicles, transverse and superior articular processes ; whilst the posterior segment is composed of the laminae, spine, and mferior articular processes. The posterior segment of the ring of this vertebra may even consist of two pieces. There is reason to believe that this abnormality of the fifth lumbar vertebra occurs in five per cent, of all subjects examined. Sir William Turner, in his report on the human skeletons in the ' Challenger ' Eeports, found seven examples among thirty skeletons examined. The skeletons in which this occurred were : a Mala,y, an Andamanese, a Chinese, two Bushmen, an Esquimaux, and a Negro. Turner has also seen it in the skeleton of a Sandwich Islander. THE SACRAL AND COCCYGEAL VERTEBRA In the adult skeleton, the five vertebrae succeeding the lumbar series are firmly ankylosed to form a single bone, the sacrum : the com^Donents of the sacrum are termed sacral vertebrse. Beyond the fifth sacral, four, and occasionally five, other rudimentary vertebrae to w^hich the adjective coccygeal is applied, are ankylosed in adult life, to form a single piece, the coccyx. In advanced life the coccyx unites with the sacrum. THE SACRUM is a large triangular-shaped bone, firmly wedged between the innominate bones. It forms the posterior boundary of the true pelvic cavity. The sacrum is curved upon itself with the concavity looking forw^ards. The upper end of the curve forms, with the body of the fifth lumbar vertebra, an anterior projection known as the promontory. The middle portion of the anterior face of the sacrum exhibits four transverse ridges corresponding to the intervertebral spaces. The intervening portions are the bodies of the vertebra. The upper two sacral vertebrae are almost equal in size to those of the lumbar series, but the three lower rapidly diminish in size from above downwards. The ridges terminate laterallyTHE SKELETON 16 in the anterior sacral foramina, four pairs in all, which are the intervertebral foramina of the sacral vertebras, and transmit the anterior divisions of the first four sacral nerves. The upper two are also traversed by the lateral sacral arteries. The bone immediately outside the foramina corresponds to the costal processes, and the portion formed by the second, third, and fourth sacral vertebrae gives origin to the injriformis muscle. The lateral part of the fifth sacral vertebra gives partial insertion to the coceygeus. The posterior surface is strongly convex and rough. The middle line is occupied by four tubercles representing the suppressed spinous processes. Of these the first is the largest, the second and third may be confluent, and the fourth is often absent. The bone on each side of the spines is formed by the ankylosed laminae. In the fourth sometimes, but always in the fifth, the lamina fail to meet in the middle line, and this leaves a gap, the hiatus sacralis. The median borders of this hiatus are prolonged downAvards as rounded processes, the sacral cornua, to which the posterior sacro-coccygeal ligaments are attached. External to the laminae is a second series of small prominences : these are the articular processes. The first pair are large for the last lumbar vertebra, the second and third are small, and the fourth and fifth are inconspicuous. Immediately external to the articular processes are the posterior sacral foramina, four on each side; they are smaller than the anterior, and give exit to the posterior divisions of the first four sacral nerves. External to the foramina there are five eminences on each side, representing the transverse processes. The first pair are large and conspicuous ; the second form part of the articular surface Fig. 17.—The Sacrum and Coccyx. (Anterior view.)THE SAC BUM 17 for the ilium ; the third, fourth and fifth give attachment to ligaments and muscles. The furrow formed by the laminae, and bounded on the median aspect by the spinous, and externally by the articular processes, is known as the sacral groove, and lodges the erector s]^in(B muscle. Fig. 18.—The Sacrum. (Posterior view.) The upper surface, or base, of the sacrum resembles the corresponding aspect of a lumbar vertebra, and its articular processes have well-marked mammillary Fig. 19.—Base of Sacrum. ARTICULAR PR SACRAL tubercles. The conjoint transverse and costal processes form on each side a broad surface, the wing or ala. From its margin the iliacus has a small point of origin. The apex is directed downwards and forwards, and is formed by the inferior aspect of the body of the fifth sacral vertebra ; it articulates by means of an inter- C18 THE SKELETON vertebral disc with the coccyx. In advanced life the coccyx and sacrum ankylose at this spot. The lateral surface presents in the upper two-thirds a broad irregular tract called the auricular process, which is rough and, in the recent state, covered with fibro-cartilage for union with the ilium. The margins are rough for ligaments. Below the auricular surface the lateral borders are sharp and give attachment to the greater and lesser sacro-sciatic ligaments. Near the extremity it presents a notch which is converted into a foramen by articulation with the coccyx. Through the space thus enclosed the anterior branch of the fifth sacral nerve issues. Some- times the foramen is represented by a notch even when the sacrum and coccyx are articulated. The middle of the sacrum is occupied by a continuation of the spinal canal. It is triangular in form at the base, and flattened towards the apex. It lodges the terminal branches of the cauda equina, the filum terminale, and the lower extremity of the dura mater. The sacrum exhibits sexual differences. In the female it is usually wider, much less curved, and is directed more obliquely backwards, than in the male. Muscles.—The following muscles are attached to the sacrum :—Pyriformis, coccygeus, iliacus, latissimus dorsi, multifidus spinse, erector spinse, gluteus maximus ; and the occasional muscles, namely, curvator coccygis, extensor coccygis, and the agitator caud?e. Ligaments.—Anterior and posterior common ligaments of the spine ; anterior and posterior sacro-coccygeal; greater and lesser sacro-sciatic, anterior and posterior sacro-iliac, two capsular, ligamenta subflava, and the supraspinous. THE COCCYX The coccyx in the adult is made up of four and occasionally five vestigial vertebrae ankylosed to one another. Earely the number of segments is reduced to three. The first two segments contain, in addition to the body of a vertebra, traces of articular and transverse processes: the rest are mere nodules of bone, represent- ing centra. The anterior surface gives attachment to the anterior sacro-coccygeal ligament ; and near its tip to the levator ani; it is in relation with the lower end of the rectum. The posterior surface is convex, and along its margin affords attachment to the gluteus maximus muscle. The lateral borders are thin : they receive parts of the greater sacro-sciatic ligaments and of the coccygeals muscle. The base has an oval facet for the fifth sacral vertebra, and presents the two long coccygeal cornua for the posterior sacro- coccygeal Hgament. The junction of the coccyx and sacrum completes the foramen of exit for the fifth sacral nerve. In many skeletons the foramen is incomplete externally. The apex is rounded and gives attachment to the sphincter ani, and in front to the levator ani muscles. THE SPINAL COLUMN IN GENERAL When the various vertebra3 are in their relative positions, the whole is termed the spinal column. It occupies the median line of the posterior aspect of the trunk. Superiorly it supports the head; laterally it gives attachment to ribs; these in their turn receive the weight of the upper hmbs. Inferiorly, the sacrum affords attachment to the innominate bones, by which the weight of the trunk is trans- mitted to the lower Hmbs. The spinal column is the axis of the skeleton. It varies in length in different persons, but on an average it measures, from the19 THE SPINAL COLUMNTHE SKELETON 20 atlas to the tip of the coccyx, followmg the curve, 70 cm. (28'0. Of this the cervical spine measures 12-5 cm. (5''), the thoracic 27-5 cm. (11"), the lumbar 17*5 cm. (7"), and the sacro-coccygeal portion 12*5 cm. (5")- Viewed in profile, the column presents four curves : the first, or cervical, is convex anteriorly ; the thoracic is much larger and longer, with its concavity for- ward ; the lumhar curve has its convexity directed anteriorly, and ends somewhat abruptly at the sacro-vertebral angle ; anel to this succeeds the pelvic curve, which corresponds to the hollow of the sacrum. In addition to these, the whole column has a slight lateral curve with the convexity to the right, probably due to muscular action. Viewed from the front, the superimposed bodies present three pyramids. The first is formed by the cervical vertebrae from the second to the seventh. The bodies of the lumbar and thoracic vertebrae form a much longer pyramid. The third is inverted, and formed by the sacrum and coccyx. Posteriorly, the column presents a median and two lateral rows of processes. The median row is formed by the spinous processes. In the cervical spine, with the exception of the first and the seventh, they are bifid. In the thoracic set they end in rounded tubercles, are long, and for the most part directed obliquely downwards, but in the lower part they become more horizontal until the eleventh is reached. The spine of the eleventh thoracic vertebra is small and almost horizontal; this is the anti-clinal vertebra. In the lumbar region the spinous processes are short, stout plates of bone, with their borders set vertically; in the sacrum they are vestigial, and in the coccyx completely suppressed. The lateral rows are formed by the transverse processes, which are most marked in the thoracic region, where they are rib-bearers. In the cervioal spine they are in the same plane as the ribs. The articular processes in the cervical region are in series with the transverse processes of the thoracic vertebrae. Between the ridges formed by the spinous and transverse processes we recognise the vertebral grooves in which muscles are lodged. The floor of each groove is formed by the laminae and articular processes, with their mammillary tubercles in the lumbar and lower thoracic regions. Similar tubercles are present on the infe- rior articular processes of the three lower cervical vertebrae. The intervertebral foramina, oval in shape, are small in the cervical, but gradually increase in size in the thoracic, and are largest in the lumbar region. Ossification.—The various ossific centres for the vertebrae are deposited in the cartilage which, very early in embryonic life, surrounds the notochord and gradually encloses the spinal cord. Fig. 21.—a Divided Thoracic Vertebra. (After Turner.)THE VEBTEBB^ 21 A typical vertebra arises from three primary and numerous secondary centres. The primary centres appear during the sixth week of embryonic Ufe. In the thoracic region the nucleus for the body is first seen, but in the cervical region the lateral centres make their appearance somewhat earlier. The nucleus for the body is deposited around the centre, and quickly becomes bilobed. This bilobed, or dumb-bell, shape is often so pronounced as to give rise to the appearance of two distinct nuclei. Sometimes the nucleus is double, and remains separate throughout life, the vertebra being divided by a vertical fissure (fig. 21). The bifid character of the nucleus of the vertebral body is further emphasised by the occasional Fig. 22.—a Vertebra at Birth. LATERAL MASS NEURO-CENTRAL SUTURE CENTRUM OR BODY occurrence of half-vertebrae. The lateral centres are deposited near the bases of the superior articular processes, and give rise to the pedicles, laminae, articular processes, and a large part of the transverse and spinous processes. At birth a vertebra consists of three parts—a body and two lateral masses connected by hyaline cartilage. The line of union of the lateral masses with the bodies is known as the neuro-central suture (fig. 22), and this is not obliterated for several years after birth. An examination of a thoracic vertebra at the fifth year will show that a portion of the body of each vertebra is derived from the lateral masses, and that the demi-facets for the rib-heads are situated behind the neuro- central suture, and therefore belong to the pedicles. During the early years growth progresses rapidly, and at puberty the secondary Fig. 23.—Lumbar Vertebra at the Eighteenth Year with Secondary Centres, epiphysial plate or disc mammillary tubercle transverse process spinous process centres make their appearance in the cartilaginous tips of the transverse and spinous processes. During the seventeenth year a meniscus of bone forms around the margins of the superior and inferior surfaces of the centra. These are the epiphysial discs ; they are thickest at the periphery, and gradually become thin towards the central perforation. By the twenty-fifth year the various secondary nuclei have coalesced with the main bone, and the vertebra is then complete. In several vertebrae the mode of ossification deviates from the account given above, and requires separate consideration. The atlas.—This bone has three primary centres—one for each lateral massTHE SKELETON 22 (neural arch) appearing in the sixth week of embryonic life. The third appears a few months after birth for the anterior arch. The lateral portions coalesce posteriorly about the third year; the union with the anterior nucleus is delayed until the sixth year. An additional centre occasionally appears for the posterior segment. Fig. 24.—Immature Atlas. (Third year.) The axis.—This is the most exceptional of all the vertebrae. It has the usual three primary nuclei—one for the body, and one on each side for the neural arch. The centre for the body appears in the embryo about the fifth month, and a few weeks later two laterally disposed nuclei are seen for the base of the odontoid Fig. 25.—Development of the Atlas. process ; these fuse together in the middle line, and by the third year ankylose peripherally to the centrum of the axis. The line of union between the body of the axis and the odontoid process is indicated even in advanced life by a persistent Fig. 26.—The Axis (from an Adult) in Section. ODOI CARTILAGE F THE INTERVEI BETWEEN Th PROCESS AN OF THE AXIS lenticular-shaped cartilage. During the second year a nucleus appears at the tip of the odontoid process. An epiphysial meniscus for the inferior and superior surfaces of the centrum of the axis appears about the seventeenth year. As a rule, the superior meniscus is represented by a few earthy granules.23 THE VEETEBBJE The sixth and seventh vertebrse.—In the cervical vertebrae the pedicles, or anterior extremities of the neural arches, take a much larger share in forming the centrum than is the case with the remaining vertebrae. The sixth, seventh, and possibly other cervicaJ vertebrae present an additional centre on each side of the neural arch for the costal process ; it appears before birth. The costal processes of the seventh cervical not infrequently fail to ankylose with the vertebra; when this is the case, the processes become cervical ribs. Sometimes these ribs are of large size. The lumbar vertebrae.—In the lumbar vertebrae two additional centres make their appearance, about puberty, namely, for the mammillary tubercles on the posterior aspect of each superior articular process. Fig. 27.—An Immature Cervical Vertebra. NEURO-CENTRAL SUTURE The fiftli lumbar occasionally differs in the mode of ossification of its arch ; in many skeletons this arch is derived from four nuclei. There is a nucleus on each side for the pedicle, the transverse process, and the superior articular process ; and one on each side for the lamina, inferior articular process, and the lateral half of the spinous process (fig. 28). The pedicles may fail to join the laminae ; more rarely the laminae fail to fuse (fig. 16). Fig. 28.—Ossification of the Fifth Lumbar Vertebra. LAMINA SUTURE PEDICLE NEURO-CENTRAL SUTURE CENTRUM The sacral vertebrae.—In addition to the three primary vertebral centres, the three upper sacral vertebrae have each an extra pair corresponding to the costal processes of the seventh cervical vertebra. These processes are very large in the first sacral, smaller in the second, and very small in the third. Although the various primary centres of the sacral vertebrae appear much later than in other regions of the column, yet they are all visible at birth. The centrum of each sacral vertebra develops a superior and inferior epiphysial meniscus, and eventually the five vertebrae fuse to form a single bone, the sacrum. Even in advanced life the intervertebral discs between the sacral vertebrae persist in the centre of the bone. The ear-shaped lateral articular facet on the side of the sacrum arises from two additional centres on each side, about the eighteenth year. The total number of ossific centres for the sacrum is thirty-five.THE SKELETON 24 The coccygeal vertebrge.—These are cartilaginous at birth. A few months later the first segment ossifies.

CERVICAL VERTEBRA COSTAL PROCESS TRANSVERSE PROCESS COSTO-TRANSVERSE FORAMEN NEURO-CENTRAL SUTURE CERVICAL RIB before the fifteenth year. By the twentieth year the first three have usually coalesced. The fourth fuses with them later, and the coccyx ankyloses with the sacrum, as a rule, late in life.25 THE VEBTEBB^ The Serial Morphology of the Vertehrce Although at first sight many of the vertebrae exhibit peculiarities, nevertheless a study of the mode by which they develop, and their variations, indicates the serial homology of the constituent parts of the vertebrae in each region of the column. The centrum, or body of the vertebra, is that part which immediately surrounds the notochord. This part is present in all the vertebrae of man, but the centnun of the atlas is dissociated from its neural arch, and ankylosed to the body of the axis. The reasons for regarding the odontoid process as the body of the atlas are these : In the embryo the notochord passes through it on its way to the base of the cranium. Between the odontoid process and the body of the axis there is a swelling of the notochord in the early embryo as in other intervertebral regions. This swelling is later indicated hy a small inter- vertebral disc hidden in the bone, but persistent even in old age. The odontoid process arises from primary centres, and in chelonians it remains as a separate ossicle throughout life ; in Ornithorhynchus it remains distinct for a long time, and it has been found separate even in an adult man. Lastly, in man and man}- mammals, an epiphysial plate develops between it and the true body of the axis. The anterior segment of the atlas is in no sense homologous with a centrum, and is most probably an enlarged hypajjojjhysis or subvertebral wedge-bone, M hich, in lizards, exists on the ventral aspect of the column between individual centra. fSimilar ossicles occur in the lumbar region of the mole. The neural arches and spinous ijrocesses are easily recognised throughout the various parts of the column in which complete vertebne are present. The articular processes are of no morphological value, and do not require consideration here. The transverse iwocesscs offer more difticulty. They present themselves in the simplest form in the thoracic series. Here they articulate with the tubercles of the ribs. The transverse process and the neck of the rib enclose an arterial foramen, the costo- transverse. In the cervical region this rib, or costal element, and the transverse process are fused together, but the conjoint process thus formed is pierced by the costo-transverse foramen. The compound nature of the process is indicated by tlie fact that the anterior or costal processes in the lower cervical vertebrae arise from additional centres and occasionally retain their independence as cervical ribs. These processes in Sauropsida (birds and reptiles) are represented by free ribs. In the lumbar region the compomid nature of the transverse process is further marked. The true transverse process is greatly suppressed, and its extremity is indicated by the accessory tubercle. Anterior to this in the adult vertebra a group of holes represent the costo-transverse foramen, and the portion in front of this is the costal element. Occasionally it will persist as an independent ossicle, the lumbar rib. In the sacral series the costal elements are peculiarly modified in the first three vertebrae to form piers of bone for articulation with the ilium. The costo-transverse foramina are completely obscured. In rare instances the first sacral vertebra v;ill articulate with the ilium on one side, but remain free on the other. Under such conditions the free process exactly resembles the elongated transverse process of a lumbar vertebra. The first three sacral vertebrae which develop a costal process (rib) for articulation with the ilium are true sacral vertebrae. Those ankylosecl below these are pseudo-sacral. A glance at fig. 29 will show the homology of the various parts of a vertebra fi^om the cervical, thoracic, lumbar and sacral regions. The mammillary processes are vestiges of the greatly elongated articular processes of such mammals as the dog, armadillo, kc.26 THE SKELETON THE BONES OF THE SKULL The skeleton of the head is called the skull: it contains, in the adult, twenty- nine separate bones. For descriptive purposes they are divided in two groups : those of the skull proper, and the appendicular elements. I. The Skull I Occipital. [a) Basilar Bones-j Sphenoid. I Temporals.

These, in the adult, fuse together and form a single bone, which ankyloses with the sphenoid. The four parts of the occipital are—the squamo-occipital, two ex-occipitals, and a basi-occipital. The lines of union of these parts are easily distinguished even in the oldest skull. The squamo-occipital is saucer-shaped, deeply concave on its cerebral, but convex on its external aspect. It consists of two parts which have different modes of origin. The posterior surface is divided by a ridge, the superior nuchal line, into a lozenge-shaped superior portion with a smooth surface and an inferior rough portion. The upper is the interparietal, and the lower the supra-occipital segment. The interparietal portion not infrequently persists as an independent ossicle (fig. 35). The supra-occipital is divided into two lateral halves by a median vertical ridge—the external occipital crest—which ascends from the middle of the posterior margin of the foramen magnum, to terminate at the external occipital protuber- ance, or inion, near the middle of the squamo-occipital. The protuberance and crest give attachment to the ligamentum nuchse. Each lateral half of the supra-occipital presents three pairs of transverse ridges, the nuchal lines. Of these the superior is usually the least cons|)icuous, but most curved; frequently it is absent; beginning at the external occipital pro- tuberance, it curves outwards to the lateral angle. It affords attachment to the epicranial aponeurosis and to few fibres of the occiijito-frontalis muscle. The middle nuchal line (sometimes called the superior curved line) commences a little distance below the protuberance, and curves outwards to end below the27 THE OCCIPITAL lateral angle. In some cases the superior and middle nuchal lines are confluent in their outer thirds, and form a prominent ridge for the insertion of the sterno- mastoid and s])lenius cajntis muscles. When these muscles are well developed, there is a fairly wide interval between the lines. The inferior nuchal line begins near the middle of the crest and curves downwards to the jugular process. Of the spaces deliminated by these lines, that between the superior and middle is occupied by the trapezius, and frequently by the sterno-mastoid and splenius capitis muscles. The space between the middle and inferior receives the complexus, and the space between the inferior line and the foramen magnum is occupied by the rectus capitis posticus minor, rectus capitis posticus major, and the superior oblique muscles. The cerebral surface is deeply concave, and divided by crucial ridges into four fossae, of which the upper two accommodate the occipital lobes of the cerebrum, the lower pair the cerebellar hemispheres. The ridges intersect each other, and Fig. 30.—The Occipital. (External view.) Trapezius INION OR EXTERNAL-OCCIPITAL PROTUBERANCE at the point where they cross an eminence, the internal occipital protuberance, is seen. The vertical ridge runs upwards to the superior angle of the bone and furnishes attachment for the falx cerebri; the portion of the ridge below the protuberance, the internal occipital crest, is for the falx cerebelli. As it nears the foramen magnum this ridge divides, becoming lost upon its margins. The angle of divergence is often occupied by a shallow fossa for the extremity of the vermiform process of the cerebellum, and is called the vermiform fossa. The horizontal ridge is deeply grooved ; to the edges of the groove the tentorium cerebelli is attached, the grooves lodge the greater part of the lateral sinuses. To one side of the internal occipital protuberance, usually the right, the furrow for the sinus is deeper and frequently forms a circular fossa which receives the torcular. This fossa is sometimes exactly in the middle line. The squamo-occipital has three angles and four borders. The superior angle fits into the space formed by the union of the two parietals. The lateral angles mark the external limits of the middle nuchal lines, and occupy the angle formed28 THE SKELETON Fig. 32.—Cerebral Surface of the Occipital, showing an Occasional Disposition of the Channels. TORCULAR VERMIFORM FOSSA POSTERIOR CONDYLOID FORAMEN ANTERIOR CONDYLOID FORAMENFOB AMEN MAGNUM 2D by the parietal and mastoid portion of the petrosal on each side. The ridge between the superior and lateral angles is the superior border; it is serrated deeply, and articulates with the posterior border of the parietal to form the lambdoid suture. The inferior border extends from the lateral angle to the jugular process ; it articulates with the mastoid portion of the petrosal. The ex-occipitals form the lateral boundaries of the foramen magnum, and extend from the ridge immediately behind the groove for the termination of the lateral sinus to the tubercle in front of the anterior condyloid foramen. The lateral surface of each ex-occipital is extended outwards to form a quadrilateral buttress of bone, the jugular process. This has an outer rough surface for articu- lation with the jugular surface of the petrosal. Its anterior border is deeply notched to form the posterior boundary of the jugular foramen, and is directly continuous with a groove which lodges the termination of the lateral sinus. Its under surface gives attachment to the rectus cajjitis lateralis and the oblique occipito-atlantal ligament. The pneumatic mastoid cells occasionally extend into this process. Rarely a process of bone extends from its under surface and Fig. 83.—The Foramen Magnum at the Sixth Year. represents the imr-occiintal lyrocess present in many mammals. The rest of the ex-occipitals enter into the formation of the condyles, and will be separately described. The basi-occipital is a quadrilateral plate of bone. Its superior surface is concave for the medulla oblongata. Inferiorly it is rough, and presents the pharyngeal tubercle, to Avhich the median portion of the fibrous bag of the pharynx is attached. The rectus capitis anticus major and minor muscles are inserted into this surface. Anteriorly the basi-occipital is, in the adult, ankylosed to the basi- sphenoid. Posteriorly it has a smooth, rounded, narrow, concave border forming the anterior boundary of the foramen magnum. The extremities of this border enlarge to join the ex-occipitals, and form the anterior extremities of the condyles. The lateral borders are rough, and articulate with the inferior border of the petrosals. The foramen magnum is oval in shape, with its major axis in the long axis of the skull. Near the middle it is encroached upon by the condyles. It is bounded posteriorly by the supra-occipital, anteriorly by the basi-occipital, and laterally by the ex-occipitals. Sometimes a facet exists at the anterior margin for articulation with the odontoid process. This is the tertiary occipital condyle. The margin30 THE SKELETON of the foramen gives attachment behind the condyles to the posterior occipito- atlantal hgament. The condyles are two oval ■ processes of bone, with smooth articular surfaces, covered in the recent state with cartilage. They are received into the superior articular cups of the atlas. The condyles converge anteriorly but diverge posteriorly. Their margins give attachment to capsular ligaments, and a prominent tubercle in the middle of the median border of each condyle is for the check ligament. A foramen, the anterior condyloid, traverses the upper part of each condyle ; it transmits the hypoglossal nerve, and a twig of the ascending pharyngeal artery with its venffi comites. Frequently the foramen is divided by a dehcate spicule of bone. Posterior to each condyle is a depression, posterior condyloid fossa, which receives the hinder edge of the articular cavity of the atlas when the head is extended ; the floor of this depression is occasionally perforated by the posterior condyloid foramen, which transmits a vein from the lateral sinus. Articulations.—The occipital bone is connected by suture with the two parietals, the two temporals, and the sphenoid ; by means of the condyles it articulates with the atlas ; and under the exceptional condition of a tertiary occipital condyle, with the odontoid process of the axis.

Blood-supply.—The occipital bone receives branches from the occipital,* X^osterior auricular, middle meningeal, vertebral and ascending pharyngeal arteries. Development.—The interparietal portion of the occipital is a membrane bone, and arises by two or more centres about the twelfth week ; these nuclei rapidly become confluent and fuse with the supra-occipital portion about the fifteenth week. Occasionally this fusion fails. The centres for the rest of the bone are deposited in cartilage. The nucleus for the basi-occipital appears in the tenth week, and is quickly followed by a nucleus for each ex-occipital; the supra-occipital ossifies from two laterally disposed nuclei, which quickly coalesce and fuse with the inter- parietal portion near the situation of the future occipital protuberance. For many weeks two deep lateral fissures separate the interparietal and supra-occipital por- tions, and a membranous space, extending from the centre of the squamo-occipital to the foramen magnum, partially separates the lateral portions of the supra- occipital. This space becomes occupied by a spicule of bone, and is of interest, because through it hernia of the brain and its membranes, known as meningo- cele or encephalocele, occurs. At birth the occipital consists of four parts: the squamo-occipital, two ■ex-occipitals, and the basi-occipital, united by strips of cartilage. The ex-occipitals31 THE OCCIPITAL and squamo-occipital fuse together about the fifth year, and unite with the basi- occipital before the seventh year. The posterior two-thirds of each occipital condyle belongs to the ex-occipitals, and the anterior third to.the basi-occipital (fig. 33). Fig. 84.—The Occipital at Birth. (Anterior view.) INTERPARIETAL PORTION (DEVELOPS IN MEMBRANE) Not infrequently the interparietal portion remains separate throughout life, and may even be represented by numerous detached ossicles or Wormian bones. By the twenty-fifth year the basi-occipital is firmly ankylosed to the sphenoid.THE SKELETON 32 THE SPHENOID The sphenoid forms a large part of the base of the skull in the region of the anterior and middle fossae. It is very irregular in shape, and is best described as consisting of a body, two pairs of wings, and two pairs of processes. The body is irregularly cuboidal in shape. The superior surface presents the fol- lowing points for examination. In front, there is a prominent spine, which is received between the diverging al^e of the crista gaUi, and known as the ethmoidal spine. The surface behind this is smooth, and is formed by the lesser or orbital wings ; it frequently presents two parallel longitudinal grooves for the olfactory nerves. This smooth surface is terminated by the optic groove, which lodges the optic chiasma, and leads on each side into the optic foramen. The groove is bounded posteriorly by the olivary eminence, a ridge of bone indicating the line of union of the pre- and post-sphenoid. Behind this ridge the bone presents a deep hollow, the pituitary fossa, in which the pituitary body is lodged. The floor of this fossa presents numerous foramina for blood-vessels, and at birth the superior orifice of a narrow passage termed the cranio-pharyngeal canal. The pituitary fossa presents on each side, slightly posterior to the olivary eminence, a tubercle Fig. 36.—^The Sphenoid. (Viewed from above.) of variable size, the middle clinoid process. This is occasionally prolonged to meet the anterior clinoid process on the orbital wing. The posterior boundary is formed by a quadrilateral plate of bone, the dorsum ephippii. The superior angles of this plate are surmounted by the posterior clinoid processes, which give attachment to the tentorium cerebelli. A little below the clinoid process, on each side of the dorsum ephippii, there is a deep notch, converted into a fora- men by the dura mater, for the passage of the sixth cranial nerve. The dorsum is slightly concave posteriorly, and supports the basilar artery and the pons Varolii. The inferior surface of the body has a prominent median ridge, the rostrum, which is received between the alse of the vomer. The rest of the surface is rough, and Covered by the mucous membrane belonging to the roof of the pharynx. The anterior surface presents in the middle line a vertical ridge of bone, the sphenoidal crest, which articulates with the perpendicular plate of the ethmoid. On each side of the crest, a more or less circular orifice leads into the sphenoidal sinuses. These sinuses are irregularly shaped, unsymmetrical cavities, separated from each other by a thin vertical septum; in adult bones they may extend into the roots of the pterygoid processes, and even into the base of the occipitalTHE SPHENOID 3B bone. The sinuses communicate with the nasal fossa of their respective sides. The lateral margins of the anterior surface are serrated for articulation with the posterior border of the os planum on each side of the ethmoid. The superior margin articulates with the cribriform plate of the ethmoid. The posterior surface is, in the adult, ankylosed to the basi-occipital. The two bones are separated by a disc of hyaline cartilage until the eighteenth year ; by the twenty-fifth year ankylosis is complete. On each side of the body there is the broad sinuous cavernous groove, which lodges the internal carotid artery and the cavernous sinus. The process of bone over which this artery turns is the lingula ; it constitutes a flying buttress for the support of the greater wings. The lesser or orbital wings (orbito-sphenoids) are thin, triangular, horizontal plates of bone resting upon that portion of the sphenoid anterior to the olivary ridge (pre-sphenoid). The superior surface of each wing is smooth and slightly concave, and forms the posterior part of the anterior fossa of the skull; the under surfaces constitute a portion of the roof of each orbit, and bound superiorly the sphenoidal fissures. The anterior border is serrated for articulation with the horizontal plate of the frontal bone. (The orbital wings meet over the pre-sphenoid Fig. 37.—The Left Half of the Sphenoid. ANTERIOR CLINOID PROCESS, MIDDLE CLINOID PROCESS. POSTERIOR CLINOID PROCESS' and almost exclude it from the cranial cavity.) The posterior border, smooth and rounded, is received into the Sylvian fissure of the cerebrum. The inner extremity is prolonged to form the anterior clinoid process to which the tentorium cerebelli is attached. Each lesser wing is connected to the body of the bone by two processes or roots ; of these, the upper is thin and flat, the lower one is thicker, and presents near its junction with the body a small tubercle for the attachment of the common tendon of three ocular muscles. The space between the roots is the optic foramen, and transmits the optic nerve and ophthalmic artery. The greater wings (ali-sphenoids) are two large plates of bone ankylosed to the body by means of the lingulse. Each wing has three surfaces. The superior or cerebral surface is concave and smooth; it receives the temporo-sphenoidal lobe of the cerebrum, and presents several foramina. At the anterior and internal part is the foramen rotundum for the second division of the fifth nerve; behind and external to this is the foramen ovale, for the motor root and the third division of the fifth nerve, the small petrosal nerve, and the small meningeal artery. Behind and external to the foramen ovale is the small circular foramen spinosum, for the middle meningeal artery and its venae comites. To the inner side of the foramen ovale a small opening, the foramen Vesalii, is occasionally present; it transmits a vein. A foramen may exist near the foramen ovale for the small superficial D34 THE SKELETON petrosal nerve. The external surface is divided by the prominent malar crest into an orbital and a temporo-zygomatic portion. The orbital surface forms the chief part of the outer wall of the orbit; its internal segment forms part of the spheno-maxillary fossa, and presents the anterior orifice of the foramen rotundmn. Near the middle of the upper border there is a small tubercle for the origin of the outer head of the external rectus muscle; and at the highest part of this surface Fig. 38.—The Sphenoid. (Anterior view.) one or more foramina are often present, for the transmission of twigs from the middle meningeal artery to the orbit and the lachrymal gland. The malar crest is serrated for articulation with the malar bone; its lower angle, in many bones, articulates with the maxilla. A foramen exists in the suture between the sphenoid and malar, for the temporal twig of the orbital nerve. The surface of bone outside this ridge is subdivided by a low crest, the pterygoid ridge. The surface above the ridge forms part of the temporal fossa, and affords attachment to the temporal Fig. o9.—Eight Half of Sphenoid. (Anterior view.) muscle; the part behind the crest belongs to the zygomatic fossa, it furnishes attachment to the external pterygoid muscle, and is continuous with the outer surface of the external pterygoid plate; it contains the inferior orifices of the foramina spinosum, ovale, and Vesalii. The circumference of the great wing, commencing at its anterior attachment to the body, is at first smooth, and forms the lower boundary of the sphenoidal35 THE SPHENOID fissure ; this serves for the passage of the third, fourth, first division (ophthahnic) of the fifth, and the sixth nerves, with the ophthahnic vein. External to this, the margin is broad and serrated for the frontal bone; quite at the tip it is bevelled on its inner aspect for the anterior inferior angle of the parietal; behind this, the edge, at first thin and bevelled, becomes gradually broader, and deeply serrated for the squamosal, and runs into the prominent alar spine of the sphenoid, to which the spheno-mandibular ligament is attached. That portion of the circumference extending from the spine to the body of the sphenoid articulates by the outer third with the petrosal, but the inner two-thirds forms the anterior boundary of the foramen lacerum medium, and contains the posterior orifice of the Vidian canal. Projecting at right angles from the greater wing, near its junction with the lingulae, are the pterygoid processes. Of these, the external, broad and thin, forms by its outer surface the inner wall of the zygomatic fossa, and affords attachment to the external ijterycjoid muscle. From its inner surface the internal pterygoid takes origin. The internal pterygoid plate is narrower and longer than the external. Its inner surface forms part of the outer boundary of the nasal fossa, and by a thin ledge of bone, called the vaginal process, extends to the under surface of the basi- sphenoid to articulate with the ala of the vomer, and anteriorly with the sphenoidal process of the palate bone. Immediately above this ledge of bone is the pterygo- palatine groove (converted into a canal by the sphenoidal process of the palate bone), for an artery and nerve of the same name. At the point where the internal pterygoid plate comes into relation with the great wing and the lingula, there is the Vidian canal. This canal is 3 cm. long, and transmits the Vidian nerve and artery. The outer surface of the internal pterygoid plate forms the inner boundary of the pterygoid fossa ; its posterior border is prolonged into a hamular process, smooth on its under aspect, for the bursa between it and the tensor (circumflexus) palati. From the lower third of the posterior border and the hamular process the su2)erior constrictor of the pharynx takes origin. The anterior borders of these processes diverge below, and have rough edges for articulation with the tuberosity of the palate bone ; the gap between them is the pterygoid notch. Above, the pterygoid processes form a triangular surface, which constitutes the posterior boundary of the spheno-maxillary fossa, and presents above the anterior orifice of the Vidian, and more internally the commencement of the pterygo-palatine canals. The anterior border of the internal pterygoid plate articulates with the posterior border of the vertical plate of the palate bone. The recess between the two pterygoid plates posteriorly is subdivided. The upper, smaller and shallower depression is the scaphoid fossa; it gives origin to the tensor (circumflexus) palati. The lower, deeper and larger, is the pterygoid fossa; it lodges the internal pterygoid and tensor palati muscles. The fossa is completed by the tuberosity of the palate bone. Articulations.—The sphenoid articulates with the following bones : ethmoid, frontal, parietal, temporal, epipteric, palate, vomer, occipital, malar, sphenoidal turbinals, and occasionally with the maxilla. Muscles.—It gives origin to the following muscles :— Temporal. External rectus of the eyeball. Internal pterygoid. Internal rectus ,, ,, External pterygoid. Superior rectus ,, ,, Tensor tympani. Superior oblique „ „ Tensor palati. LcA^ator palpebrje. Ligaments.—The sphenoid has numerous intrinsic ligaments which occasionally ossify and produce adventitious foramina. Of these, the more important are :— D 2THE SKELETON 36 Inter-clinoid—This passes from the anterior to the posterior chnoid processes. Carotico-clinoid.—From the anterior to the middle chnoid process. The ossifi- cation of this hgament gives rise to a ring of hone through which the internal carotid artery passes. PterygO'Spinous.—This is attached to the spine of the sphenoid and the external pterygoid plate near the upper third. The spheno-mandibular hgament (long internal lateral hgament of the jaw). Several other insignificant bands have received names, but they are of no importance. Fig. 40.—The Under Surface of Pee-Sphenoid at the Sixth Year. FORAMEN Blood-supply.—The sphenoid is supplied by branches of the middle and small meningeal arteries ; also the anterior deep temporal and other branches of the internal maxillary, such as the Vidian, pterygo-palatine and spheno-palatine. The body of the bone also receives twigs from the internal carotid. Ossification.—The sphenoid is ossified in cartilage from twelve ossific nuclei which appear in pairs. The nuclei are divisible into two sets,—those for the pre- sphenoid, and those for the post-sphenoid. The post-sphenoid centres consist of four pairs disposed as follows :—One for each ali-sphenoid (great wing). A pair of median nuclei for the basi-sphenoid, Fig. 41.—The Sphenoid at Birth. VIDIAN CANAL LINGULA and a nucleus for each lingula (sphenotic nucleus), and one for each internal pterygoid. The external pterygoid is an outgrowth from the great wing. The pre-sphenoid centres consist of a nucleus for each orbito-sphenoid (lesser wings), and a median pair for the body of the pre-sphenoid. These nuclei appear at intervals from the eighth week to the end of the third month in the following order: ah-sphenoid, basi-sphenoid, hnguLT, internal pterygoids, orbito-sphenoid, and pre-sphenoid. The various earthy spots fuse together, so as to form at birth three pieces. The median piece consists of the basi-sphenoid and lingula, con- joined with the pre-sphenoid carrying the lingulae ; the two lateral pieces are theTHE SPHENOID 37 ali-sphenoids (greater wings) carrying the internal pterygoid plates. The greater wings are joined to the lingnlffi by cartilage. The dorsum ephippii is cartilaginous at birth. In the course of the first year the orbito-sphenoids fuse in the middle Fig. 42.—The Jugum Sphenoidale. line to form the jugum sphenoidale, which excludes the anterior part of the pre- sphenoid from the cranial cavity. The greater wings fuse with the lingul* in the course of the first year. THE TEMPORAL BONES The adult temporal bone consists of three parts, so firmly united as to afford little trace of its complex origin. At birth the three parts are easily separable as the squamosal, petrosal, and tympanic (fig. 103). The squamosal resembles a large scale; it is attached at right angles to the petrosal, and forms part of the side wall of the skull. It is thin, and in places translucent. The outer surface is smooth and forms part of the temporal fossa ; it presents one, and occasionally two nearly vertical grooves for the deep temporal Fig. 43.—The Left Temporal Bone. (Outer view.) TEMPORAL FOSSA POST-GLENOID TUBERCLE AUDITORY MEATUS AURICULAR FISSURE arteries. A ridge of bone, the supra-mastoid crest, runs immediately above the external auditory meatus, and is continued onwards to the zygoma. The zygoma is a narrow projecting bar of bone, jutting forwards and lying parallel with the squamosal. It has two surfaces and two borders. The outer surface is subcutaneous; the inner looks towards the temporal fossa. The inner surface and lower border give origin to the masseter muscle. The upper border receives the temporal fascia. The tip of the zygoma is serrated for articulation38 THE SKELETON with the malar. Posteriorly the lower border ends in a tubercle, which is the meeting point of two ridges ; of these, the anterior passes inwards at right angles to the zygoma, and expands into the articular eminence which serves as an articular facet for the condyle of the mandible when the month is opened. The second ridge runs backwards and forms the upper boundary of the glenoid fossa, and cur\-ing downwards ends in a tubercle, the post-glenoid tubercle, immediately anterior to the Glaserian fissure. The oval deep depression between these ridges is the glenoid fossa, which receives the condyle of the mandible. This fossa is limited posteriorly by the Glaserian fissure. The inner surface of the squamosal presents furrows for the convolutions of the brain and grooves for the middle meningeal arteries. The line of union between the squamosal and petrosal is sometimes indicated by a persistent petrc-squamosal suture. Rarely the two ])ortioris reiiuiin permanently separate. The superior border of the squamosal is thin, and bevelled on the cerebral surface where it overlaps the parietal; anteriorly it is serrated for the posterior border of the greater wing of the sphenoid. Posteriorly it joins the rough serrated margin of the petrosal to form the parietal notch. The petrosal element is a four-sided pyramid of very dense bone ; its base is Fig. 44.—The Left Temporal Bone. (Inner view.) formed by the mastoid process ; the apex is rough and forms part of the boundary of the foramen lacerum medium. Two sides of the pyramid x)roject into the cranial cavity, of which one forms the posterior boundary of the middle fossa, and the other the anterior boundary of the posterior fossa of the cranium. Of the two remaining surfaces, one appears on the under surface of the skull, and the fourth constitutes the inner wall of the recess called the tympanum. The posterior surface is bounded above by the superior border, which serves for the attachment of the tentorium cerebelh, and is grooved for the superior petrosal sinus ; near the apex, this border presents the trigeminal notch (converted into a foramen by the tentorium) for the transmission of the trigeminal nerve. This border in old skulls sometimes terminates in a spiculum of bone—the petro-sphe- noidal process—and extends to the dorsum ephippii, and completes a foramen (petro-sphenoidal) which transmits the sixth nerve. Near the middle of the posterior surface is an oblique inlet, the internal auditory meatus, which receives the auditory and facial nerves and the auditory artery. The meatus is about 10 mm. deep, and to be properly examined the surface of the bone should be cut away, or the parts studied in the petrosal of a foetus at or near the ninth month, for it is at this date relatively large and shallow.THE TEMPOBAL BONES 39 The fundus of the meatus is divided by a transverse ridge of bone, the falciform crest, into a superior and inferior fossa. Of these, the superior is the smaller, and presents anteriorly the beginning of the aqueduct of Fallopius ; this transmits the seventh nerve. The rest of the surface above the crest is dotted with small foramina (the superior cribriform area) which transmit nerve-twigs to the fovea hemielliptica and the ampullae of the superior and external semicircular canals. Below the crest there are two depressions and an opening. Of these, an anterior curled tract (the spiral cribriform tract) with a central foramen (foramen centrale cochleare) marks the base of the cochlea; the central foramen indicates the orifice of the canal of the modiolus, and the smaller foramina transmit the cochlear twigs of the auditory nerve. The posterior opening (foramen singulare) is for the nerve to the ampulla of the posterior semicircular canal. The middle depression (middle cribriform area) is dotted with minute foramina for the nerve-twigs to the saccule, which is lodged in the fovea hemispherica. The inferior fossa is subdivided by a low vertical crest. The fossa in front of the crest is the fossula cochlearis, and the recess behmd it is the fossula vestibularis. Behind the meatus is a small slit (large in the foetus) which formerly lodged the aqueductus vestibuli (ductus endolymphaticus); in the adult it is occupied by a small arteriole and venule and a process of dura mater. Occasionally a bristle can be passed along this passage into the vestibule. Above, and anterior to this, is a second slit also lodging a process of the dura mater. This is a remnant of the Fig. 45.—The Foramina in the Fundus of the Left Internal Auditory Meatus OF A Child at Birth (Diagrammatic.)

Posteriorly, this surface has a deep groove for the lateral sinus. The anterior face of the pyramid is separated from the squamosal by the petro-sq[uamous suture, w^hich may persist throughout life. It presents the following points of interest: near the apex it has a shallow depression for the Gasserian ganglion, and the recess of dura mater (Meckel's cave) in which it lies ; below this is the termination of the carotid canal. Behind these are two small foramina, overshadowed by a thin osseous hp. Of these, the larger and more internal is the hiatus Fallopii, which transmits a small artery from the middle meningeal and the greater petrosal nerve. The smaller and external foramen is for the lesser petrosal nerve. Still more externally there is a thin translucent plate of bone, the tegmen tympani. Behind, and slightly internal to this, there is a ridge formed by the superior semicircular canal. The inferior or basilar surface is very irregular, and has the following points of interest. At the apex is a quadrilateral smooth space for the tensor tymimni and levator imlati muscles. Behind this is the large circular orifice of the carotid canal, for the transmission of the carotid artery and a plexus of sympathetic nerves. Internal to this, near the inner border of the bone, is the orifice of the ac^ueductus cochleae (ductus perilymphaticus). In the adult it transmits a small vein from the cochlea to the internal jugular. Posteriorly is the elliptical jugular fossa with smooth walls for the ampulla which receives the lateral and in- ferior petrosal sinuses, and forms the commencement of the internal jugular vein.THE SKELETON 40 In the riclge of bone between the fossa and the carotid canal there is a small fora- men, the tympanic canaliculus, for the tympanic branch of the giosso-pharyngeal nerve. On the inner wall of the fossa a similar minute foramen, the auricular canaliculus, permits the passage inwards of the auricular branch of the vagus nerve. Behind the fossa is the rough jugular surface, which receives the jugular process of the occipital. Firmly ankylosed to the inner surface of the tympanic plate is the styloid process, varying in length from one to five cm. At its base is the stylo- mastoid foramen, from which issues the facial nerve ; the stylo-mastoid artery enters the Fallopian canal through this opening. Kunning backwards from this foramen are two grooves ; the outer is the digastric groove, from which the digastric muscle arises. The inner is narrower and shallower; it lodges the occipital artery. Of the outer surface, the only part which appears externally is the mastoid process ; the rest is occupied by a recess known as the tympanum. The mastoid process is a nipple-shaped prominence of bone, formed partly by the squamosal, but mainly by the petrosal. Its upper limit is the supra-mastoid crest. Below the crest an irregular furrow crosses the surface of the process from the parietal notch downwards, to the middle of the meatus. This furrow (squamo-mastoid) is often dotted with holes, and represents the line of union of squamosal and petrosal. The mastoid process gives attachment to the sterno-mastoid, sjUenius cajntisy trachelo-mastoid, occipito-frontalis, and retrahens aurem muscles. The tympanum is hidden by the tympanic folate, which extends downwards from the Glaserian fissure to form the vaginal process. Anteriorly it extends forwards and ankyloses with the outer wall of the carotid canal. The Glaserian fissure separates it from the squamosal. This fissure transmits the tympanic branch of the internal maxillary artery, and lodges the slend^ process of the malleus. A narrow subdivision of this fissure, canal of Huguier, is traversed by the chorda tympani nerve. The tympanic plate forms the anterior, low^er, and part of the posterior walls of the external auditory meatus. It is limited posteriorly by the auricular fissure, through which the auricular twig of the vagus nerve issues. The external auditory meatus assumes the form of an elliptical bony tube. Its outer margin is rough and gives attachment to the cartilaginous portion of the pinna. Between the posterior edge of the meatus and the mastoid process is the auricularTHE TEMPORAL BONES 41 fissure. The tympanic orifice of the meatus is smooth, and presents a well-marked groove for the tympanic membrane. This is veiy conspicuous in young bones. The direction of the meatus is somewhat oblique. In children, and occasionally in adults, a circular opening exists in ihe anterior wall of the meatus (fig. 53). Fig. 47.—Temporal Bone with Muscle Attachments.

Ligament of incus. The blood-supply.—Arteries supplying the temporal bone are derived from various sources. The chief are :— Stylo-mastoid from posterior auricular : it enters the stylo-mastoid foramen. Tympanic from internal maxillary : it passes through the Glaserian fissure. Petrosal from middle meningeal: transmitted by the hiatus Fallopii. Tympanic from internal carotid whilst in the carotid canal. Auditory from the basilar : it enters the internal auditory meatus, and is distri- buted to the cochlea, vestibule, &c. Other less important twigs are furnished by the middle meningeal, the menin- geal branches of the occipital, and by the ascending pharyngeal artery. The squamosal is supplied on its internal face by the middle meningeal, and externally by the branches of the deep temporal from the internal maxillary. THE TYMPANUM The tympanum is an irregular cavity in the temporal bone. At birth it is a recess in the outer wall of the petrosal, partially closed externally by the squamosal. When the various elements of the temporal bone coalesce, and the tympanic plate becomes fully developed, then the cavity is completely surrounded by bony walls, except where it communicates with the external auditory meatus. The roof, or tegmen tympani, is a translucent plate of bone belonging to the petrosal; it separates the tympanum from the middle fossa of the skull. The floor is the plate of bone which forms the roof of the jugular fossa. The inner wall is formed by the external surface of the petrosal bone, and presents the following points for study :—Li the angle between it and the roof is a horizontal ridge which extends backwards as far as the posterior wall, and then turns down- wards in the angle betvveen the inner and posterior wall. This is the Fallopian canal; it is occupied by the facial nerve (seventh). Near the roof, but below the Fallopian canal, is the fenestra ovalis, which leads into the vestibule : this fenestra receives the base of the stapes. Below the fenestra ovalis is the promontory, which contains the commencement of the first turn of the cochlea. In the lower and posterior part of the promontory is the fenestra rotunda; this, in the recent state, is closed by the secondary membrane of the tympanum. In the macerated bone it leads into the spiral canal of the cochlea. The promontory is also furrowed by some delicate channels (sometimes canals) for the tympanic branch of the glosso-pharyngeal nerve, which enters the tympanum through the tympanic canaliculus. The posterior Avail of the tympanum is formed by the mastoid process. At the superior and internal angle of this wall an opening leads into the mastoid antrum. Immediately below this opening there is a small hollow cone, the posterior pyramid; its cavity is continuous with the descending limb of the Fallopian canal. One or more bony spiculae often connect the apex of the pyramid with the promontory. The cavity of this cone is occupied by the stajjedius and the tendon of the muscle emerges at the apex. The roof and floor converge toAvards the anterior extremity of the tympanum, which is, in consequence, very narrow, and occupied by two canals : the lower for the Eustachian tube, the upper for the tensor tympani muscle. These grooves are43 THE TYMPANUM sometimes described together as the canalis musculo-tubarius. In carefully prepared bones the upper canal is a small horizontal hollow cone (anterior pyramid), 12 mm. in length, which lodges the tensor tympani muscle ; the apex is just in front of the fenestra ovalis, and is perforated to permit the passage of the tendon of the muscle. As a rule the thin walls of the canal are damaged, and represented merely by a thin ridge of bone. The posterior portion of this ridge projects into the tympanum, and is known as the processus cochleariformis. The thin septum between the canal for the tensor tympani and the tube is pierced by a narrow canal which is traversed by the small deep petrosal nerve. The outer wall is occupied mainly by the external auditory meatus. This opening is closed in the recent state by the tympanic membrane. The rim of bone to which the membrane is attached is incomplete above; the defect is known as the notch of Rivinus. Anterior to this notch, in the angle between the squamosal and the tympanic plate, is the Glaserian fissure, and the small passage which transmits the chorda tympani nerve sometimes called the canal of Huguier. The tympanic cavity may be divided into three parts. The part below the level of the superior margin of the external auditory meatus is the tympanum proper; Fig. 48.—The Inner AVall of Tympanum. ILAR the portion above this level is the attic of the tympanum ; it receives the head of the malleus, the body of the incus, and leads posteriorly into a recess known as the mastoid antrum. The mastoid antrum.—This is quite distinct from the mastoid cells. It is an air-chamber communicating with the attic of the tympanum. It is separated from the middle cranial fossa by the posterior portion of the tegmen tympani; the floor is formed by the mastoid portion of the petrosal; it communicates with the mastoid cells. The outer wall is formed by the squamosal below the supra-mastoid crest. In children the outer wall is exceedingly thin, but in the adult it is of considerable thickness. The external semicircular canal projects into the antrum on its inner wall, and is very conspicuous in the foetus. A canal occasionally leads from the mastoid antrmii through the petrous bone to open in the recess which indicates the position of the floccular fossa ; it is termed the petro- mastoid canal. (G-ruber.) The Fallopian canal.—This canal begins at the anterior angle of the superior fossa of the internal auditory meatus, and passes directly outwards to the hiatus Fallopii ; it then turns abruptly backwards and forms a horizontal ridge on the inner wall of the tympanum lying in the angle between it and the tegmen tympani. It passes immediately above the fenestra ovahs, and extends as far backwards as the entrance to the mastoid antrum ; here it comes into contact withTHE SKELETON 44 the inferior aspect of the projection formed by the external semicircular canal. It then tm-ns vertically downwards, running in the angle between the internal and posterior w^all of the tympanum to terminate at the stylo-mastoid foramen. The canal is traversed by the facial (seventh) nerve. Numerous openings exist in the walls of this passage. At the hiatus the greater and smaller superficial petrosal nerves escape from, and a branch from the middle meningeal artery enters, the canal. In the vertical part of its course the cavity of the posterior pyramid opens into it. There is also a small orifice by which the auricular branch of the vagus joins the facial, and near its termination the iter chordae posterius for the chorda tympani nerve leads from it into the tympanum. The vestibule.—This is an oval chamber situated between the base of the internal auditory meatus and the inner wall of the tympanum, with which it communicates by way of the fenestra ovalis. Anteriorly the vestibule leads into the cochlea, and posteriorly it receives the extremities of the semicircular canals. It measures about 3 mm. transversely, and is somewhat longer antero-posteriorly. Its inner wall presents at the anterior part a circular depression, the fovea hemispherica, which is finely perforated for the passage of nerve-twigs. This fovea is separated by a vertical ridge (the crista vestibuli) from the vestibular orifice of the aqueductus vestibuli (ductus endolymphaticus), which passes obliquely backwards to open on the posterior surface of the petrosal bone.

SUPERIOR SEMICIRCULAR CANAL EXTERNAL SEMICIRCULAR CANAL POSTERIOR SEMICIRCULAR CANAL FENESTRA ROTUNDA OR COCHLE/E FENESTRA OVALIS OR VESTIBULI The roof contains an oval depression—the fovea hemielliptica. Anteriorly the vestibule leads into the cochlea. Posteriorly it receives the five openings of the semicircular canals. The semicircular canals are three in number. Each forms about two-thirds of a circle ; they lie in different planes. One extremity of each canal is dilated to form an ampulla. The superior canal lies transversely to the long axis of the petrosal, and is nearly vertical; its highest limb makes a projection on the anterior surface of the bone. The ampulla is at the outer end; the inner end opens into the vestibule conjointly with the superior limb of the posterior canal. The posterior canal is nearly vertical and lies antero-posteriorly. It is the longest of the three ; its upper extremity joins the inner limb of the superior canal, and opens in common with it into the vestibule. The lower is the ampul- lated end. The external canal is placed horizontally and arches outwards ; its external limb forms a prominence in the mastoid antrum. This canal is the shortest ; its ampulla is at the outer end near the fenestra ovalis. The cochlea.—This is a cone-shaped cavity lying with its base upon the internal auditory meatus, and the apex directed outwards. It measures about five millimetres in length, and the diameter of its base is about the same. The centre of this cavity is occupied by a column of bone—the modiolus—around which a delicate bony lamella appears to be wound. This lamella is the osseous spiral lamina,THE TYMPANUM 45 which gives attachment to the structures which form collectively the membranous cochlea. The lamina makes two and a half turns in all. The first turn is the largest, and forms a bulging, the promontory, on the inner wall of the tympanum. The lamina terminates at the apex of the cochlea in a hooldike process—the hamulus. The modiolus is traversed by a central canal, and presents many canaliculi for the transmission of the twigs of the cochlear division of the auditory nerve. There Fig. 50.—The Cochlea in Saggital Section. (After Henle.) INTERNAL AUDITORY MEATUS -THE SPIRAL CANAL is also a canal which winds round the modiolus at the base of the spiral lamina, known as the spiral canal of the modiolus. The portion of the cochlea above the lamina is the scala vestibuli; the part below, that is, on the basal aspect of the lamina, is the scala tympani ; it opens into the tympanum by way of the fenestra rotunda. Near the commencement of the scala tympani, and close to the fenestra rotunda, is the cochlear orifice of the aqueductus cochleae (ductus perilymphaticus). In the adult this opens on the inferior surface of the petrosal near the apex, and transmits a small vein from the cochlea to the jugular fossa.

The Ossification of the Temjporal Bone At birth the temporal bone consists of three parts easily separable in the macerated j skull: they are the petrosal, squaQuosal, and the tympanic. (The styloid process is car- j tilaginous with the exception of its basal element, the tympano-hyal, which, with the I ear-bones, will be described with the appendicular elements of the cranium. I The squamosal and tympanic bones develop in membrane. The squamosal is formed from one centre, which appears as early as the eighth week. Ossification extends into the zygoma, which grows concurrently with the sfjuamosal. At first the tympanic border is46 THE SKELETON nearly straif,'ht, but soon assinnes its characteristic horseshoe shape. At birth the post- glenoid tubercle is conspicuous, and at the hinder end of the squamosal there is a recess where it conies into relation with the mastoid antrum. The centre appears for the tympanic bone about the twelfth week. At birth it is a horseshoe-shaped ossicle slightly Fig. 51.—Tiih Ti-mi'OI'.al Bone at Birth. (Outer view.)

Up to the middle of the tifth month the periotic capsule is cartilaginous; it thenTHE TYMPANUM 47 ossifies so rapidly that by the end of the sixth month its cliief portion is converted into porous bone. The ossific material is deposited in fom" centres, or groups of centres, named according to their relation to the ear-capsule in its embryonic position. The nuclei are deposited in the following order :— 1. The opisthotic appears at the end of the fifth month. The osseous material is seen first on the promontory, and it quickly surrounds the fenestra rotunda from above down- wards, and forms the floor of the vestibule, the lower part of the fenestra ovalis, and the internal auditory meatus, it also invests the cochlea. Subsequently a plate of bone arises from it to surround the internal carotid artery and form the floor of the tympanum. Fig. 54.—The Mastoid Antrum at the Third Year. (After Symington.) 2. The pro-otic nucleus is deposited behind the internal auditory meatus near the inner limb of the superior semicircular canal. It covers in a part of the cochlea, the vestibule, and the internal auditory meatus, completes the fenestra ovalis, and invests the superior semicircular canal. 3. The pterotic nucleus ossifies the tegmen tympani and covers in the external semi- circular canal; the ossific matter is first deposited over the outer limb of this canal. 4. The epiotic is the last to appear, and is first seen at the most posterior part of the posterior semicircular canal; often it is double. This centre gives rise to the mastoid process. Fig. 55.—The Mastoid Antrum at the Ninth Year. (After Symington.) At birth the bone is of loose and open texture, resembling biscuit orunglazed porcelain, thus offering a striking contrast to the dense and ivory-like petrosal of the adult. It also differs from the adult bone in several other particulars. The floccular fossa is widely open and conspicuous. Voltolini has pointed out that a small canal leads from the floor of the floccular fossa and opens posteriorly on the mastoid surface of the bone: it may open in the mastoid antrum. The hiatus Fallopii is unclosed, and the tympanic recess is filled with gelatinous connective tissue. The mastoid process is not developed, and the jugular fossa is a shallow depression. After birth the parts grow rapidly. The tympanum becomes permeated with air ; the48 THE SKELETON various elements fuse ; and the tympanic annnlus o^ro^\'s rapidly and forms the tympanic plate. Growth in the tympanic bone takes place most rapidly from the tubercles at its upper extrenhties, and in conse(]uence of the slow growth of the lower segment a deep notch is formed ; gradually tlie tubercles coalesce, leaving a foramen in the anterior part of the bony meatus which persists until puberty, and even in the adult. In most skulls a cleft capable of receiving the nail remains between the tympanic element and the mastoid process ; this is the auricular fissure. The anterior portion of the tympanic plate forms with the inferior border of the squamosal a cleft known as the Glaserian fi.ssure, which is subsequently encroached upon by the growth of the petrosal. As the tympanic plate increases in size it joins the outer wall of the carotid canal and presents a prominent lower edge, known as the vaginal process. Fig. 56.—The Mastoid Antrum of an Adult. (After Symington.) MASTOID ANTRUM SEMICIRCULAR CANALS LATERAL SINUS AIR CELLS OF MASTOID The mastoid process becomes distinct about the first year, coincident with the ob- literation of the petro-squamous suture. It increases in thickness by deposit from the periosteum. Towards puberty, rarely earlier, the process becomes pneumatic, the air- cells being lined by delicate mucous membrane. In old skulls the air-cells may extend into the jugular process of the occipital bone. At birth the mastoid antrum is relatively large and bounded externally by a thin plate of bone belonging to the squamosal. As the mastoid increases in thickness the antrum comes to lie at a greater depth from the surface and becomes relatively smaller. The size of the antrum and the variations in thickness of its outer wall at the age of three years, nine years, and in the adult, are shown in figs. 54, 55 and 56. In each case the sections were made slightly posterior to the external auditory meatus. In 20 per cent, of skulls there are no air-cells in the mastoid process. THE PAEIETAL The t^vo parietals form a large portion of the vault and sides of the skull; they are interposed between the frontal anteriorly and the occipital posteriorly. Each parietal presents two surfaces, four borders, and four angles. The external surface is convex and smooth : the convexity, best marked in young bones, is greatest near the centre, wdiich is termed the parietal emmence. Crossing the middle of the bone are the t^vo temporal ridges; the lower is the better marked, and limits the origin of the temporal muscle. The upper ridge is less constant, and it gives attachment to the temporal fascia. The internal surface is concave and marked with depressions corresponding to the cerebral convolutions. Numerous vertical deep furrows for the branches of the middle meningeal artery radiate from the anterior inferior angle and lower border of the bone. Along the superior margin of the bone there is a groove ^vhich, ^vhen articulated with the opposite bone, forms a furrow which receives the superior longitudinal sinus. In adult bones49 THE PABIETALS Fig. 57.—The Left Parietal. (Outer surface.) SUPERIOR BORDER PARIETAL FORAMEN Fig. 58.—The Left Parietal. (Inner surface.) PARIETAL FORAMEN GROOVE FOR SUPERIOR LONGITUDINAL SINUS DEPRESSIONS FOR PACCHIONIAN BODIES GROOVE FOR LATERAL SINUS GROOVES FOR MIDDLE MENINGEAL ARTERY E50 THE SKELETON numerous deep circular depressions for Pacchionian bodies are found near this groove. The superior border is deeply serrated for the opposite parietal, the union with which forms the sagittal suture. The anterior and posterior borders are deeply serrated: the anterior articulates with the frontal to form the coronal, and the posterior with the squamo-occipital to form the lambdoid sutures. The inferior border is bevelled and overlapped by the squamosal to form the squamous suture. Of the angles, the anterior inferior is prolonged downwards and articulates with the summit of the greater wing of the sphenoid. The posterior inferior angle articulates with the mastoid portion of the petrosal; on its inner surface it has a horizontal groove for lodging a portion of the lateral sinus. The superior angles present nothing worthy of note. Articulations.—The parietal articulates with its fellow, the occipital, squamosal, frontal, sphenoid, and epipteric bones. Occasionally the squamosal and epipteric may exclude the parietal from union with the greater wing of the sphenoid. Blood-supply.—From the middle meningeal, occipital, and supraorbital arteries. Ossification.—The parietal ossifies from an earthy spot deposited in the outer layer of the dura mater about the seventh week. This bone is sometimes divided by a horizontal suture. THE FEONTAL This bone bears much the same relation to the anterior part of the skull that the occipital bears to the posterior. It has, not inaptly, been compared to a cockle shell. The inner or posterior surface is concave, forming a deep fossa for the reception of the frontal lobes of the cerebrum. There is a gap in the lower part of the bone known as the ethmoidal notch, which overlaps by its thin edges the cribriform plate of the ethmoid and forms, with that bone, the internal orifices, of the anterior and posterior ethmoidal canals. The anterior part of this notch articulates with the crista galli, and the small hole in the line of suture is the foramen caecum. Prolonged vertically upwards from the point of union with the crista is a ridge of bone, which gradually opens out to form a furrow for the reception of the superior longitudinal sinus ; the ridge serves for the attachment of the anterior part of the falx cerebri. The thin laminae of bone on each side of the ethmoidal notch are termed orbital plates, because they form the greater part of the roof of each orbit. As a rule, they present deep depressions for the convolutions on the orbital surface of the cerebrum. The rest of the cerebral surface of the frontal is fairly smooth, and presents a few furrows for meningeal arteries, and, near the median groove, pits for Pacchionian bodies. The external surface is convex and smooth, often divided by an imperfect fissure, the remains of the metopic suture, which indicates the line of union of the two bones representing the frontal in early life. On each side of this suture a little below the centre is the frontal eminence. Below the eminences, separated by shallow grooves, are the two converging superciliary ridges, which approach each other in the median line to form the nasal eminence. The smooth space bounded by the converging superciliary ridges is the glabella. Below these ridges the bone presents the sharp supraorbital ridges which end internally at the internal angular, and externally at the external angular processes. Each ridge has a narrow, deep supraorbital notch (sometimes a complete foramen) at its inner third. At the bottom of this notch or foramen a small opening communicates with the diploe. The external angular processes are prominent and articulate with the malar bones ; from each process a ridge extends upwards and backwards, marking off the lateral aspect of the bone, where it assists in the formation of the temporal ridge and fossa. The internal angular processes articulate with the lachrymal.51 THE FBONTAL bones, and are separated by a serrated interval, the nasai notch, which receives the upper borders of the nasal bones, and outside these the nasal processes of the maxillse. The notch has in the middle a long pointed process, the nasal spine, which lies between the upper part of the nasal bones and the mesetlinioid. On each side of the spine an opening leads into the large frontal sinuses. Fig. 59.—The Frontal. (Anterior view.) The under surfaces of the orbital plates are smooth and concave ; they form the roofs of the orbits. Each is sharply limited anteriorly by the supraorbital ridge, and presents at the outer angle the lachrymal fossa for the reception of the Fig. 60.—The Frontal Bone. (Inferior view.) NASAL SPINE OF SPHENOID lachrymal gland. Near the internal angle there is the small shallow supra- trochlear fossa for the pulley of the superior oblique muscle. A sharp ridge runs backwards from the internal angular process, and articulates successively with the lachrymal and the os planum of the ethmoid. It has two notches, which are converted into the anterior and posterior ethmoidal canals by articulation with the E 2THE SKELETON 52 OS planum. The posterior border of each orbital plate articulates with the lesser wing of the sphenoid (orbito-splienoid), and is continuous with a rough triangular surface for the greater wing (ali-sphenoid). This triangular surface is continuous anteriorly with the serrated malar ridge of the sphenoid, and, laterally, with that border of the bone which articulates with the parietals to form the coronal suture. Between the ethmoidal notch and the inner margin of the orbital surface there is an irregular surface which forms the roofs of the ethmoidal cells. Articulations.—The frontal articulates with the parietal, sphenoid, ethmoid, lachrymal, malar, maxilla, and nasal bones. With the epipterics when present, and occasionally (as explained on page 41) with the squamosal, and with the sphenoidal turbinal when it creeps into the orbit. It has the following onuscles attached to it:— The blood-supply.—Arterial twigs derived from the middle and small meningeal arteries enter it on the cerebral, and branches from the frontal and supraorbital arteries on the outer surface. The horizontal plate derives twigs from the ethmoidal and other branches of the ophthalmic artery. Ossification.—The frontal develops from two earthy spots deposited in the outer layer of the dura mater, in the situations ultimately known as the frontal emin- ences. These nuclei appear about the eighth week, and quickly spread through the membrane. At birth the bones are quite distinct. Subsequently they articulate with each other in the median line to form the metopic suture. In a few cases the bones remain distinct throughout life. In the majority of cases the suture is obliterated; ankylosis commences about the sixth year. In adult skulls, traces of the metopic suture may often be seen in the region of the glabella. After the two halves of the bone have united, osseous material is deposited at the lower end of the metopic suture to form the nasal spine, which is one of the distinguishing features of the human frontal bone. The spine appears about the twelfth year, and soon consolidates with the bone above. Accessory nuclei are sometimes seen between this bone and the lachrymal ; they may persist as Wormian ossicles. The frontal sinuses appear about the seventh year as prolongations from the anterior ethmoidal cells. Occasionally they invade the horizontal plate, and extend over the roof of the orbit.

Fig. 61.—The Frontal Bone at Birth.THE ETHMOID 53 THE EPIPTERIC AND WORMIAN BONES These are bones of variable size which occupy the anterior lateral fontanelles, regions indicated in the adult skull by the name pterion. Each epipteric bone is wedged between the squamosal, frontal, greater wing of sphenoid, and the parietal, and is present in most skulls between the second and fifteenth year. After that date it may persist as a separate ossicle, or unite with the frontal or the squamosal. In this case it will cause a fronto-squamosal suture, and exclude the parietal from the sphenoid. More commonly the epipteric joins the sphenoid. In some skulls it is scarcely as large as a split pea, in others it is as broad as the thumb- nail. The epipteric bone is pre-formed in membrane, and appears in the course of the first year. The Wormian bones are small, irregular-shaped ossicles, often found in the sutures of the skull, especially those in relation with the parietal bones. Wormian bones sometimes occur in great number; as many as a hundred have been counted in one skull. They are rarely present in the facial sutures. THE ETHMOID The ethmoid is a bone of delicate texture, situated at the anterior part of the skull-base ; it is roughly cuboidal in shape, and its delicacy is due to the fact that it is honeycombed by air-cells. The bone consists of four parts : the horizontal or cribriform plate, two lateral masses, and a perpendicular plate. The cribriform plate forms part of the anterior cerebral fossa, and is received Fig. 62.—Section through the Nasal Fossa to show the Mesethmoid. SPII NASAL SPINE OF FRONTAL CREST OF MAXILLA into the ethmoidal notch of the frontal bone. Standing vertically upon this plate is the crista galli. To the posterior border of the crista the falx cerebri is attached ; this border divides posteriorly to enclose the ethmoidal spine of the sphenoid. The anterior aspect of the base of the crista constitutes the anterior border of the cribriform plate ; it is rough for articulation with the frontal. In the suture between the two bones there is an opening, the foramen caecum, which trans- mits a small vein. On each side of the crista galli the cribriform plate lodges theTHE SKELETON 54 olfactory bulb, and is perforated for the transmission of the filaments of the olfactory nerves. On each side, near the anterior part of the crista, there is a narrow longitudinal slit for the nasal branch of the fifth nerve. The perpendicular plate (mesethmoid) is directly continuous with the crista on the under aspect of the cribriform plate. It is a lamella of bone, trapezoid in shape, which forms the upper part of the nasal septum ; usually it is laterally deflected. Its anterior border articulates with the nasal spine of the frontal, and the crest of the nasal bones. The inferior border has the triangular cartilage attached to it. The posterior border is subdivided : the upper half articulates with the crest of the sphenoid, and the lower articulates with the vomer. The surfaces of this plate present, especially in their upper parts, numerous foramina for vessels, and grooves for filaments of the olfactory nerves. The lateral mass, or labyrinth, of the ethmoid consists of two scroll-like pieces of bone, the superior and inferior turbinals (ethmo-turbinals) ; a smooth, quadrilateral plate of bone, the OS planum, and a number of air-cells. The OS planum is on the outer side of the lateral mass, and forms a large por- FiG. G3.—The Ethmoid. (Side view.) ilDAL Hon of the inner wall of the orbit. By the anterior border it articulates Avith the lachrymal, by the posterior border with the sphenoid and the orbital process of the palate bone; the inferior border articulates with the inner margin of the orbital plate of the maxilla, and by the superior border with the horizontal plate of the frontal. Two notches in the superior border lead into grooves running horizontally across the lateral masses to the cribriform plate. These ethmoidal grooves are converted into canals by the frontal bone. The anterior canal transmits the anterior ethmoidal artery and nasal nerve; the posterior is for the posterior ethmoidal artery. The turbinals project on the inner aspect of the lateral mass; they coalesce anteriorly, but are separated posteriorly by a space, termed the superior meatus. Each turbinal has an attached upper, and a free, slightly convoluted, lower border. In the recent state they are covered with mucous membrane, and present numerous foramina for blood-vessels, and grooves for twigs of the olfactory nerves. On the under surface of each lateral mass, near the anterior corner of the os I)lanum, an irregular lamina of bone projects downwards and backwards. This is the unciform process : it articulates with the ethmoidal process of the inferior turbinal, and forms a small part of the inner wall of the antrum.THE ETHMOID 55 The ethmoidal cells occupy the space between the os planum and the turbinals; they are divided by a thin septum into an anterior and posterior set. The cells are imperfect in the ethmoid, they require the juxtaposition of other bones to make them complete. Above, they are closed by the horizontal plate of the frontal, posteriorly by the sphenoidal turbinal and the orbital process of the palate, inferiorly by the maxilla, and anteriorly by the lachrymal. The anterior set communicate with the frontal cells above, whilst below they open into the middle meatus of the nose by a sinuous canal, the infundibulum. The posterior cells open into the superior meatus, and occasionally communicate with the sphenoidal cells. The cells are sometimes divided into groups, according to the bone which hes in immediate juxtaposition. Those along the superior edge are the fronto- ethmoidal; those beneath the lachrymal, lachrymo-ethmoidal, usually two in number. Those along the lower edge are the maxillo-ethmoidal; and posteriorly there are the spheno-ethmoidal, completed by the sphenoidal-turbinals, and a palato-ethmoidal cell. Articulations.—The ethmoid articulates with the frontal, sphenoid, two palate Tig. 64.— Section through the Nasal Fossa to show the Lateral Mass OF the Ethmoid. SPHENO- bones, two nasals, vomer, two inferior turbinals, the sphenoidal turbinals, two maxillse, and two lachrymal bones. The hinder surface of each lateral mass comes into relation with the sphenoid on each side of the crest and rostrum, and helps to close in the sphenoidal sinus. Blood-supply.—The anterior and posterior ethmoidal, and from the nasal or spheno-palatine branch of the internal maxillary. Ossification.—The ethmoid has three centres of ossification. Of these, a nucleus appears in the fourth month of intra-uterine life in each lateral cartilage. At birth this bone is represented by two scroll-like bones, very delicate, and covered with irregular depressions, which give it a worm-eaten appearance. Six months afterbirth a nucleus appears in the ethmo-vomerine plate for-the mesethmoid. This gradually extends into the crista galli. During the third year the lateral masses and the mesethmoid (perpendicular plate) ankylose. The cribriform plate is derived from the lateral masses. The ethmoidal cells do not make their appearance before the third year, and they gradually produce attenuation of the lateral masses. In many places there is56 THE SKELETON so much absorption of bone that the cells perforate the ethmoid in situations where it is overlapped by other bones. Along the lower border of the bone, near its articula- tion with the maxilla, the absorption leads to the partial detachment of a narrow strip known as the uncinate or unciform process. Sometimes a second but smaller hook-like process is formed, above and anterior to the large one. This process is so very fragile that it is difficult to preserve it in disarticulated bones. The relations of the uncinate process are best studied by removing the outer wall of the antrum. THE SPHENOIDAL TUKBINAL These bones (often referred to as the bones of Bertin) are two hollow cones^ flattened externally in three planes. They may be obtained as distinct ossicles about the fifth year. At this date they are wedged in between the under surface of the pre-sphenoid and the orbital and sphenoidal processes of the palate bone. The apex of the cone is directed backwards, and appears near the vaginal process of the sphenoid. Of its three surfaces, the outer one is in relation with the spheno-maxillary fossa, and occasionally extends upwards between the sphenoid Fig. 65.—The Sphenoidal Turbinal at the Sixth Year. and the os planum of the ethmoid to appear on the inner wall of the orbit (fig. 67). The inferior surface forms the upper boundary of the spheno-palatine foramen, and enters into the formation of the posterior part of the roof of the nasal fossa. The superior surface lies flattened against the under surface of the pre-sphenoid. The base of the cone is in contact with the posterior surface of the lateral mass of the ethmoid. At birth these bones are visible as small triangular ossifications in the peri- chondrium of the ethmo-vomerine plate near its junction with the pre-sphenoid. Fig. 66.—The Sphenoidal Turbinals from an Old Skull. SPHENOIDAL TURBINAL ROSTRUM OF SPHENOID By the third year they have become hollow cones, the circular orifice representing the base eventually becoming the orifice of the sphenoidal sinus. As the cavity enlarges, the median wall atrophies so that the inner wall of the sinus is formed by the pre-sphenoid. As the turbinal enlarges it ankyloses with adjacent bones. In many skulls it joins the lateral mass of the ethmoid ; more frequently it fuses with the pre-sphenoid ; less frequently with the palate. After the twelfth year they can rarely be separated from the skull without damage. In many disarticulated skulls57 THE INFEBIOB TUBBINAL they are so broken up that a portion is found on the sphenoid, fragments on the palate bones, and the remainder attached to the ethmoid. Sometimes, even in very old skulls, they are represented by a triangular plate of extreme tenuity on each side of the rostrum of the sphenoid (fig. 66). THE INFERIOE TURBINAL These are a pair of delicate, scroll-like bones, and may be regarded as dis- memberments of the lateral masses of the ethmoid, with which they are closely •related. Each bone presents two surfaces, two borders, and tw^o extremities. The outer surface is concave, and overhung by the auricular or maxillary- process. The inner surface is convex and pitted with depressions. The superior border presents from before backwards three processes : the first is called the lachrymal process, because it articulates with the turbinal process of the lachrymal bone. The margin of bone at the base of this process comes into relation with the nasal process of the maxilla. The second vertical spiculum is the ethmoidal process, which joins the uncinate process of the ethmoid. The third or maxillary process is a thin lamella of bone, turned doAvnwards; it overhangs the orifice of Fig. 67.—The Inferior Turbinal, Adult Sphenoidal, Turbinal AND Lachrymal Bones. THE CREST OF LACHRYMAL Tensor tarsi THE ORBITAL SURFACE LACHRYMAL GROOVE HAMULAR PROCESS TURBINAL PROCESS THE LACHRYMAL PROCESS THE ETHMOIDAL PROCESS THE MAXILLARY PROCESS the maxillary sinus, and serves to fix the bone firmly to the outer wall of the nasal fossa. The margin posterior to the maxillary process comes into relation with the inferior turbinal crest of the palate bone. The inferior border is rounded and free. It is the thickest part of the bone. The extremities are narrow, the posterior being the more pointed. Articulations.—The inferior turbinal articulates with the maxilla, lachrymal, palate, and ethmoid. The inferior turbinal is ossified from a single nucleus which appears about the fifth month of intra-uterine life. At birth it is a relatively large bone, and fills up the lower part of the nasal fossa.58 THE SKELETON THE LACHEYMAL The lachrymal hones are extremely thin and delicate, quadrilateral in shape, and situated at the anterior part of the inner wall of the orbit. They are the smallest of the facial hones. The outer or orbital surface is divided by a vertical ridge into two unequal portions. The anterior smaller portion is deeply grooved to form the lachrymal sulcus, which lodges the lachrymal sac and forms the commencement of the lachrymal duct. The portion behind the ridge is smooth, and forms part of the inner wall of the orbit. The ridge gives origin to the tensor tarsi muscle, and terminates inferiorly in a hook-like process, the hamulus, which curves forward to articulate with the lachrymal tubercle of the maxilla and completes the superior orifice of the lachrymal canal. The inner surface is in relation with the two anterior cells of the ethmoid (lachrymo-ethmoid), and forms part of the infundi- bulum. The superior border is short, and articulates with the internal angular process of the frontal. The lower border posterior to the crest joins the inner edge of the orbital plate of the maxilla. The narrow piece, anterior to the ridge, is prolonged downwards to join the lachrymal spine of the inferior turbinal, and is called the turbinal process. The anterior border comes into relation with the posterior border of the nasal process of the maxilla. The posterior border articulates with the os planum of the ethmoid. . Articulations.—The lachrymal articulates with the ethmoid, maxilla, frontal and inferior turbinal bones. Blood-supply.—Its arteries are derived from the infraorbital, the nasal branch of the ophthalmic, and the anterior ethmoidal. Ossification.—This bone arises in the membrane overlying the cartilage of the fronto-nasal plate. Its mode of ossification is very variable. As a rule it is described as coming from one nucleus. Not infrequently the hamulus is a separate element. Sometimes the bone is divided horizontally, and a process of the os planum projects between the two halves to join the nasal process of the maxilla. More rarely the bone is represented by a group of detached ossicles resembling Wormian bones. THE VOMER The vomer is an irregular four-sided plate of bone constituting the lower portion of the nasal septum. It is usually described as resembhng a ploughshare in shape. Each lateral surface is covered with the thick mucous membrane of the nasal sinus, Fig. 68.—The Vomer. (Side view.) ANTERIOR BORDER — GROOVE FOR NASO-PALATINE NERVE GROOVE FOR SEPTAL CARTILAGE—1 INFERIOR BORDER — and is traversed by a narrow but well-marked groove, which lodges the naso- palatine nerve from the spheno-palatine ganglion ; hence it is sometimes called the naso-jxilatine groove. The superior border of the bone is expanded laterally into two alee. The grooveTHE VOMEB 59 between them lodges the rostrum of the sphenoid, whilst the margin of each ala comes into contact with the sphenoidal process of the palate bone. Between the alae and the sphenoid a canal exists on each side of the rostrmn for blood-vessels. The inferior border is uneven, and is received into the groove formed by the crests of the opposed maxillae and the palatine bones of each side. The anterior border joins posteriorly the mesethmoid, and in front the triangular (median) nasal cartilage. The posterior border, smooth, rounded, and covered with mucous membrane, serves to separate the posterior nares. The anterior and inferior borders meet each other at the apex of the bone. Articulations.—The vomer articulates with the sphenoid, palates, ethmoid, and maxillae, and with the triangular cartilage. Fig. 69.—The Vomer at Birth. Blood-supply.—Its arteries are derived from the anterior and posterior ethmoidal, the naso-palatine, and the pterygo-palatine arteries, and twigs from the posterior palatines through Stenson's canals. Ossification.—The vomer is a membrane bone, and arises from a single centre deposited in the lower border of the perichondrium of the ethmo-vomerine plate as early as the eighth week. From this single centre a lamina of bone extends on each side of the cartilage plate. For many weeks the vomer is a shallow bony trough. Gradually it presses upon and induces absorption of the enclosed cartilage, and by degrees the laminEe fuse, and form a rectangular plate of bone. At birth the vomer presents an expanded lower border, especially in cases of cleft palate. THE NASAL These are two oblong bones situated in the middle line at the upper part of the face, and forming the bridge of the nose. Each bone has two surfaces and four borders. The facial surface is concave from above downwards, but convex from side to side. Near its centre is a foramen for the transmission of a small tributary to the facial vein. The posterior or nasal surface is concave laterally, and traversed by a longitudinal groove for the nasal branch of the ophthalmic nerve. In life this surface has a covering of mucous membrane. The short superior border is thick and serrated for articulation with the nasal notch of the frontal. The inferior border is thin, and serves for the attachment of the lateral nasal cartilages. Each bone articulates with its fellow by the median border, which is prolonged backwards to form a crest ; this crest comes into relation with the nasal spine of the frontal and the anterior border of the mesethmoid. The outer border articulates with the nasal process of the maxilla.THE SKELETON 60 Articulations.—The nasal bone articulates with its fellow, the frontal, maxilla, and ethmoid. Blood-supply.—Twigs to this bone are furnished by the nasal branch of the ophthalmic, the frontal, the angular, and the anterior ethmoidal arteries. Ossification.—Each nasal bone is developed from a single earthy nucleus in the Fig. 70.—The Left Nasal Bone. superior border median border outer border inferior border membrane overlying the fronto-nasal cartilage. The nucleus is easily seen in the eighth ^veek. The bone by its pressure soon produces absorption of the underlying cartilage. At birth tlie nasal bones are nearly as wide as they are long, whereas in the adult the length of the bones is three times greater than the width. THE MAXILLA The maxillffi are two hollow irregular cuboidal bones with two prominent processes. They form a large portion of the facial skeleton. This bone is occupied by a large cavity, the antrum. The body presents four surfaces. Of these the facial surface looks forwards and outwards and presents the following points of interest :—The socket for the canine tooth causes a low elevation, the canine eminence, having to its inner side the incisive fossa, from which the dejrressor alcd nasi arises. On the outer side of the eminence is the canine fossa, which gives origin to the levator angnU oris. Above this fossa is the infraorbital foramen, through which the terminal branches of the infra- orbital nerve and artery emerge. From the ridge above this foramen the levator lab a supcrioris arises. A ridge of bone extending upwards from the socket of the second molar tooth separates the facial from the zygomatic surface. Near the middle of the zygomatic surface are the orifices of the canals for the posterior dental nerves and vessels. The posterior inferior angle of this surface is termed the tuberosity; from it a few fibres of the internal pterygoid muscle arise. This tuberosity is most prominent after eruption of the wdsdom tooth; the rough surface along its inner border is for the tuberosity of the palate bone ; the smooth surface immediately above forms the anterior boundary of the spheno-maxillary fossa, and enters into the formation of the descending palatine canal. The orbital surface is irregularly triangular and forms the floor of the orbit. Anteriorly it is rounded and forms part of the circumference of the orbit; externally it is rough for suture with the malar bone ; the rough surface ends in a backwardly projecting spine which occasionally joins the sphenoid and forms the anterior limit of the spheno-maxillary fissure. The posterior margin, smooth and rounded, forms the inferior limit of the spheno-maxillary fissure. The internal border is nearly straight ; quite at the posterior part is a gap for the orbital process of the palate bone ; anteriorly it articulates with the os planum of the ethmoid; beyond this it receives the lachrymal bone, and in the anterior angle it is smooth and MEDIAN BORDER GROOVE FOR NASAL NERVE61 THE MAXILLA rounded, forming jjart of the circumference of the orbital orifice of the lachrymal duct. The orbital surface is traversed by the infraorbital groove, which, commen- cing at the posterior border, deepens as it passes forwards and enters the infra- orbital canal. This groove receives the second division of the fifth nerve and the infraorbital artery. The infraorbital canal runs under the margin of the orbit Fig. 71.—The Left Maxilla. (Outer view.)

It transmits the infraorbital artery and nerve. At the termination of the groove a smaller canal tunnels the anterior wall of the antrum, and conveys the anterior dental nerves and vessels to the upper incisor, canine, and bicuspid teeth. External to the commencement of the lachrymal duct there is a shallow depression from which the inferior oblique takes origin. The internal or nasal surface forms the outer w^all of the nasal fossa, and is Fig. 72.—The Left Maxilla. (Inner view.)

The posterior half of this surface is deficient, and leads by a large irregular aperture into the antrum ; below and behind this opening the bone is rough for articulation with the vertical ]Dlate of the palate bone. The extreme posterior border receives the tuberosity of the palate bone; the groove in front of it forms part of the posterior palatine canal. Anterior to this surface the bone becomes suddenly smooth ; between the smoothTHE SKELETON 62 and rough portions is the maxillary fissure for the reception of the thin maxillary process on the anterior border of the vertical plate of the palate bone. In the angle between this surface and the nasal process is a deep groove converted by the lachrymal and inferior turbinal into the nasal duct. Running backwards from the anterior margin is the inferior turbinated crest vhich articulates with the lowest turbinal bone. The surface above the crest forms part of the middle meatus, and the surface below belongs to the inferior meatus of the nose, and is directly continuous with the superior surface of the palatine process. Near its anterior border is the orifice of the anterior palatine canal. The inferior or palatine surface is formed by the palatine process and the alveolar border. The palatine process forms the anterior part of the roof of the mouth. It is concave, rough, and pitted with foramina for vessels. Where it joins the alveolar border a groove (sometimes a canal) exists for the anterior palatine nerve and posterior palatine vessels. When the bones of opposite sides are placed in apposition the palatine fossa is formed ; running outwards from this to the space between the second incisor and canine tooth, the maxillo-premaxillary suture can be detected in young bones. The posterior border articulates with the horizontal process of the palate bone, whilst the median border joins its fellow to form, above, a prominent crest upon which the vomer is received. The anterior palatine fossa is situated in the meso-palatine suture near its anterior termination. In its typical form the fossa contains four passages : two are small and disposed one behind the other exactly in the suture ; these are the foramina of Scarpa for the naso-palatine nerves, the left nerve emerging from the anterior foramen. The lateral and larger orifices diverge to open on each side of the crest. They are called Stenson's canals, and lodge recesses of the nasal mucous membrane and remnants of Jacobson's organs. The alveolar ridge forms the outer limit of this surface ; it is crescentic in shape, spongy in texture, and presents cavities in which teeth are lodged. When the teeth are complete in number, eight cavities are present; of these the pit for the canine tooth is the deepest, those for the molars are the widest and present subdivisions. Along the outer aspect of the alveolar border the buccinator arises, as far forward as the first molar tooth. The nasal process is somewhat triangular, standing vertically from the nasal angle of the maxilla. Its outer surface gives attachment to the orbicularis 'palpebrarum, the tendo octdi, and the levator labii supeiioris alceque nasi. The internal surface forms one of the lateral boundaries of the nasal fossa. Superiorly it articulates with the frontal; below this is the superior turbinated crest for articulation with the middle turbinal. The space between this and the inferior turbinated crest forms part of the middle meatus. The anterior border articulates with the nasal bone; the posterior is thick and vertically grooved to form part of the nasal duct. The inner margin of this groove articulates with the lachrymal ]>one. The point where the outer margin of the groove joins the orbital plate is indicated by the lachrymal tubercle. The malar process is rough and triangular, and forms the summit of the ridge of bone separating the facial and zygomatic surfaces. It articulates with the malar bone, and from its inferior angle a few fibres of the masseter take origin. The antrum or maxillary sinus, as the air-chamber occupying the body of the bone is called, is somewhat pyramidal in shape ; the base being represented by the nasal or internal surface, and the apex corresponding to the malar process. In addition to these it has four walls : the superior is formed by the orbital plate, and the inferior by the alveolar ridge. The anterior wall corresponds to the facial surface of the maxilla, and the posterior is formed by the zygomatic surface. The inner boundary or base presents a very irregular orifice at its posterior part; this is partially filled in by the vertical plate of the palate bone, the uncinate process of6B THE MAXILLA the ethmoid, the maxillary process of the inferior turbinal, and a small portion of the lachrymal bone. Even when these bones are m situ, the nasal orifice is very irregular in shape, and requires the mucous membrane to form the definite rounded aperture (or apertures, for they are often niultiple) known as the opening of the antrum. The cavity of the antrum varies considerably in size and shape. In the young it is small and the walls are thick : as life advances, the antrum enlarges at the expense of its walls, and in old age they are often of extreme tenuity ; occasionally the cavity extends into the substance of the malar bone. The floor of the antrum is, as a rule, very uneven, due to prominences corresponding to the roots of the molar teeth. In most cases the bone separating the teeth from the antrum is very thin, and not rarely the roots project uncovered into it. The teeth which come into closest relationship with the antrum are the first and second molars, but the sockets of any of the teeth lodged in the maxilla may, under diseased conditions, communicate with it. Although, as a rule, the cavity of the antrum is single, yet specimens occasionally come to hand in which it is divided by bony septa into chambers, and it is far from uncommon to find it divided into recesses by bony processes. In many maxillae, the roof of the antrum presents near its anterior aspect what appears to be a thick rib of bone ; this is hollow and corresponds to the infraorbital canal. The most satisfactory method of studying the relation of the bones closing in the base of the antrum is to cut away the outer wall of the cavity (see fig. 84). Articulations.—The maxilla articulates with its fellow, and with the frontal, nasal, lachrymal, ethmoid, palate, vomer, malar and inferior turbinal bones. Occa- FiG. 73.—Ossification of the Maxilla. PRE-MAXILLARY PORTION Outer view. Inferior view. Inner view. sionally it articulates with the greater wing, and less frequently with the pterygoid process of the sphenoid bone. The muscles attached to it are mainly those known as muscles of expression : — Compressor naris. Levator anguli oris. Orbicularis palpebrarum. Inferior oblique. Orbicularis oris. Depressor al^e nasi. Levator labii superior proprius. Buccinator. Levator labii superioris alseque nasi. Internal pterygoid. Masseter. Blood-supply.—The maxilla is a very vascular bone, and its arteries are nume- rous and large. They are derived from the infraorbital, alveolar, descending palatine, naso-palatine, ethmoidal, frontal, nasal, and facial branches. Ossification.—The maxilla arises from four centres which are deposited in membrane. The various centres may be termed pre-maxillary, maxillary, malar, andTHE SKELETON 64 pre*palatine. They arise about the eighth week of embryonic life, and fuse very rapidly. {a) The pre-maxillary nucleus gives rise to that portion of the bone which lodges the incisor teeth. It sends a narrow process upwards which forms part of the outer boundary of the anterior narial aperture. On the palatine aspect it furnishes a spiculum which surrounds the anterior and mesial aspect of Stenson's canal. The posterior limit is indicated up to the end of the first dentition by the maxillo-premaxillary suture. The greater part of this centre is formed in membrane, but the inner part subsequently invades the ethmo-vomerine cartilage. {h) The maxillary nucleus forms the nasal process, and the greater part of the body of the maxilla. (c) The malar centre gives origin to that portion of the bone lying external to the infraorbital groove. (d) The pre-palatine centre gives rise to the nasal surface of the maxilla and the palatine process posterior to Stenson's canal. This portion is in shape similar to the palate bone. THE PALATE BONE The palate bone is rectangular in shape, and wedged between the maxilla and the pterygoid processes of the sphenoid. It has a horizontal and a vertical plate, a tuberosity, and two processes. The horizontal plate is smaller than the vertical; it is quadrilateral in shape. The upper surface forms the floor of the nasal fossa ; the inferior surface completes the hard palate posteriorly, and presents near its posterior border a transverse ridge, which gives attachment to the tensor ijcdati muscle. The anterior border is rough for articulation with the palatine process of the maxilla. The posterior border is free, curved, and sharp; it gives attachment to the soft palate. The inner border is broad, and rough for articulation with its fellow. When the palate bones are in apposition, these borders form a ridge continuing the crest formed by the palatine processes of the maxillae ; this crest receives the inferior border of the vomer. The posterior extremity of the crest forms the posterior nasal spine, from which the azygos uvulce arises. The vertical plate is thin ; of its two surfaces, the outer is rough for articula- tion with the maxilla, except a small portion near the middle close to the anterior border where it looks into the antrum, and a small triangular surface at the upper end where it forms part of the spheno-maxillary fossa. Towards the posterior border there is a vertical groove, which forms with the maxilla the posterior palatine canal; it transmits the descending palatine nerves and vessels. The canal may be more or less complete in the palate bone. The internal surface has two transverse ridges separating three shallow depressions. Of these depressions the lower forms part of the inferior meatus of the nose, and the limiting ridge or crest articulates Avith the inferior turbinal. Above this is the depression for part of the middle meatus ; the ridge above is for the second turbinal. The upper groove is narrower and deeper than the lower two, and forms a large part of the superior meatus. The ridges are known as the turbinated crests. The borders of the vertical plate are terminated by irregular prominences, which enter into complex union with surrounding bones. The posterior border is vertical, and comes into relation with the anterior border of the internal pterygoid process; below, it terminates in a prominent tuberosity. This presents three grooves or flutes : the inner receives the internal pterygoid, the outer the external pterygoid process, while the middle groove com- pletes the pterygoid fossa, and affords attachment to a few fibres of the internal 'pterygoid muscle; the superior constrictor of the ptharynx also arises from this process. The tuberosity is tunnelled by canals : to the nasal side are the accessory65 THE PALATE BONE palatine canals; near its junction with the horizontal plate is the orifice of the posterior palatine canal; and outside this occasionally may be found the minute external palatine canals (fig. 85). The sphenoidal process, which is a process of variable shape, surmounts the posterior border; it has three surfaces and two borders. The superior surface comes into apposition with the sphenoidal turbinal bone, and forms part of the Fig. 74.—Palate (Left) Bone. (Inner view.) CREST pterygo-palatine canal. The internal surface forms part of the outer wall of the nasal fossa, and is prolonged on to the roof, and comes in contact with the ala of the vomer. The outer surface is subdivided by a thin lip into an anterior smooth portion for the spheno-maxillary fossa, and a posterior rough part for the base of the internal pterygoid plate. Of the borders, the posterior is thin and articulates with the internal pterygoid plate ; the anterior border forms the posterior boundary of the spheno-palatine foramen. Fig. 75.—Palate Bone. (Posterior view.) The anterior border of the vertical plate is thin, sharp, and presents near the middle the maxillary process, which is received into the maxillary fissure of the maxilla near the lower border of the opening of the antrum. Superiorly this border is terminated by the orbital process. This process presents five surfaces ; of these, three are articular. The posterior surface joins the walls of the sphenoidal turbinal bone, its air-cells extending occasionally into this part of the F66 THE SKELETON palate bone. In the same way the posterior ethmoidal cells extend into the inner sm-face of the orbital process, where they articulate with the lateral mass. The anterior surface is a continuation of the outer aspect of the vertical plate, and rests upon the maxilla. Of the two non-articular surfaces, the one directed upwards and outwards is slightly concave, and forms part of the floor of the orbit at its junction with the inner wall. The outer smooth surface looks directly into the zygomatic fossa, and extends into the spheno-maxillary fossa, and forms the anterior boundary of the spheno-palatine foramen. These surfaces are often conveniently named according to the bones with which they articu- late, or the fosste which they help to form : thus, the anterior or maxillary ; internal or ethmoidal; posterior or sphenoidal; superior or orbital; external or zygomatic. Between the orbital and sphenoidal processes is the spheno-palatine notch, which i is converted by the sphenoid turbinal bone into a complete foramen. Occasionally j it is complete in the palate bone. It transmits the spheno-palatine nerve and | artery ; the foramen opens into the back part of the nasal fossa, close to its roof, j When the spheno-palatine foramen is complete in the palate bone, it is often due to ankylosis between the palate and the sphenoidal turbinal; the latter, being | extremely fragile, easily breaks during the process of disarticulation. \ Articulations.—The palate bone articulates with its fellow the sphenoid, maxilla, vomer, sphenoidal turbinal, inferior turbinal, and ethmoid bones. As the surfaces and lines of union of the orbital and sphenoidal processes are somewhat intricate, the student should, w^hen studying this bone, refer to the following figures. The orbital and zygomatic surfaces are shown in fig. 84. The relation of the sphenoidal process to the nasal fossa in fig. 64. The relations of the pterygoid processes to the tuberosity of the palate are shown in fig. 85. With the help of these drawings the student will be able to understand the position of this bone, which assists in forming the boundary of the following cavities : viz. the nasal, orbital, spheno-maxillary, antral, and the ethmoidal cells. The muscles attached to it are :— Internal pterygoid. Tensor palati. Azygos uvulae. Superior constrictor of pharynx. Blood-supply.—Its arteries are derived from the descending palatine, the spheno-palatine, and pterygo-palatine. Ossification.—The palate bone arises from one nucleus, which is deposited in membrane, and appears about the eighth week of embryonic life. The spot where the earthy matter is first seen ultimately becomes the angle where the vertical and horizontal plates join. At birth the two plates are nearly equal, but as the nasal sinuses increase in height the vertical plate is lengthened, until it becomes twice the length of the horizontal plate. THE MALAE The malar bone, somewhat quadrilateral in shape, is situated at the outer and upper side of the face, and forms the prominence known as the cheek. Each bone has a convex external surface, presenting near the centre one or two minute orifices for the transmission of the malar nerves and arteries. This surface is largely covered by the orbicularis ;[)ali)ehrcirum, and gives origin to the zygomatici major and minor. The internal surface is concave, and abruptly excluded from the orbit by a prominent ledge of bone, the orbital process, which forms the anterior boundary ofTHE MALAB BONES 67 the temporal fossa. A large part of this surface is rough for articulation with the malar process of the maxilla. The orbital process of the malar is at right angles with the external surface, and presents the orbital orifice of the malar canal; this canal is usually single, but it may bifurcate as it traverses the bone, one branch emerging on the external, the other on the internal surface. The thin edge of this process articulates inferioiiy with the orbital plate of the maxilla, and ends in a i point known as the maxillary process. The superior portion articulates with the malar crest on the external surface of the greater wing of the sphenoid ; in the suture between these bones a notch (sometimes a foramen) exists for the temporal branch of the fifth nerve. When the orbital surface is large, it excludes the sphenoidal wing from articulation with the maxilla at the anterior extremity of the spheno-maxillary fissure. When this is the case, the border presents near its middle a short non-serrated margin. The malar bone presents superiorly the frontal process, which articulates with the external angular process of the frontal bone. The maxillary process articulates Fig. 76.—The Left Malar Bone, frontal process orbital border malar canal maxillary process anterior border NOTCH ■ORBITAL PROCESS MALAR CANAL MAXILLARY PROCESS MAXILLARY SURFACE with the maxilla, and occasionally forms the superior segment of the infraorbital foramen. The zygomatic process is directed backwards, and is serrated mainly on its inner aspect for articulation with the zygoma. Of the four borders, the orbital is the longest, and extends from the frontal to the maxillary process. It is thick, rounded, and forms the outer and a large portion of the inferior circumference of the orbit. The inferior is continuous with the zygoma, and gives origin to the anterior fibres of the masseter. The anterior border is in relation with the maxilla, and near the margin of the orbit gives origin to a portion of the levator lahii superiorisiwoprius. The posterior border extends from the frontal to the zygomatic process, and presents a double curve ; it gives attach- ment to the temporal fascia. This border is directly continuous below with the upper border of the zygoma, and above with the temporal ridge. Articulations.—The malar articulates with the maxilla, frontal, sphenoid, and temporal bones. Blood-supply.—The arteries of the malar are derived from the infraorbital, F 268 THE SKELETON lachrymal branches of the ophthalmic, transverse facial, and deep temporal arteries. The muscles connected with it are : — Zygomaticns major. Zygomaticns minor. Masseter. Ossification.—The malar is a membrane-bone, and arises from two and occa- sionally three centres, which appear in the eighth week of embryonic hfe, and grow with astonishing rapidity: the bone quickly attains a relatively large size. Occasionally the two primary nuclei fail to coalesce, and the bone is represented in the adult by two portions separated by a horizontal suture. Such bipartite malars have been observed in skulls obtained from at least a dozen different races of men. Bipartite malars have been seen with the suture vertical. That the bone may arise from three centres is shown by the fact that tripartite malars have been observed. At birth the maxillary process reaches as far forwards as the outer border of' the infraorbital canal; subsequently it may send a process over the canal. THE APPENDICULAE ELEMENTS OF THE SKULL The bones which form this group are the mandible (lower jaw), malleus, incus, stapes, hyoid, the styloid process of the temporal bone, and the internal pterygoid process of the sphenoid. THE MANDIBLE OR LOWER JAW The mandible (loiocr jaw or inferior maxilla) is in shape like a horseshoe ; it consists of a horizontal portion or body, and two vertical portions or rami. The body consists of a right and a left half, meeting in the middle line to form the symphysis. Each half presents two surfaces and two borders. The external surface is smooth and generally convex, and presents the following points of interest:—The symphysis ends inferiorly in a triangular surface which forms the chin. Near the symphysis is the incisive fossa, from which the levator menti arises ; external to this is the mental foramen through which the mental nerve and artery issue. This foramen is in a line with the second bicuspid tooth. Extending backwards and upwards from the mental protuberance, so as to become continuous with the anterior border of the coronoid process, is the external oblique line ; along its upper border the depressor lahii inferior is and dejjressor angtoli oris arise ; the 2'^^(^iysma is attached to its lower edge. The internal surface presents, at a point corresponding to the symphysis, two pairs of genial tubercles. The upper pair give origin to the genio-hyo-glossi, and the lower pair afford insertion to the genio-hijoid muscles. The tubercles occasionally form a single, median, irregularly shaped eminence. By the side of the genial tubercles there is a shallow smooth depression, the subling-ual fossa ; below this is the digastric fossa for the insertion of the anterior belly of the digastric muscle. Posterior to the genial tubercles, the internal oblique line (mylo-hyoid ridge) commences and extends backwards, becoming more and more prominent as it approaches the alveolar border. The mylo-hyoid muscle is inserted along the whole69 THE MANDIBLE length of this ridge. At the posterior part the suijerior constrictor takes origin, and the pterygo-maxillary ligament is attached to its posterior extremity. Below the internal oblique line is the submaxillary fossa, which is in relation with the submaxillary gland. The inferior border of the body of the mandible is smooth and rounded ; near its junction with the ramus there is a groove for the facial artery. The superior border is composed of spongy bone, and is named the alveolus; it presents sockets for eight teeth. From the outer edge of the alveolus, as far forward as the first molar tooth, the buccinator muscle takes origin. The ramus is quadrilateral in shape. It has two surfaces, four borders, and two processes. The external surface is for the insertion of the masseter muscle. The internal surface presents near its middle the mandibular (inferior dental) foramen which leads into the mandibular (inferior dental) canal which , traverses Fig. 77,— The Mandible. (Outer view.)

This canal presents a series of fine apertures above, through which filaments of the mandibular nerve and artery pass to the teeth. In its posterior two-thirds the canal is nearer the internal, in its outer third it is nearer the external surface of the mandible. The posterior orifice of the canal is surmounted by the mandibular spine to which the spheno-mandibular ligament is attached. Eunning obliquely downwards behind this spine is the mylo-hyoid groove, which lodges the mylo-hyoid nerve and artery. In the embryo, Meckel's cartilage also occupies the groove. The triangular rough space behind this groove is for the insertion of the internal loterygoid muscle. The inferior border of the ramus is thick, rounded, and continuous with the lower border of the body of the bone. The posterior border is rounded ; to its lower part the stylo-maxillary ligament is attached. This border is surmounted by the condyle, which is connected with the ramus by a somewhat constricted portion, the neck. The condyle is oval in shape, with its long axis transverse to the upper borderTHE SKELETON 70 of the ramus, but oblique with regard to the median axis of the skull, so that the outer is more anterior than the inner angle, and presents the condyloid tubercle for the external lateral ligament of the temporo-mandibular articulation. The convex surface of the condyle is covered with cartilage and rests in the glenoid fossa ; the. neck is flattened in front and presents a pit, for the insertion of a portion of the external j^terygoid muscle. The superior border of the ramus is knoAvn as the sigmoid notch; it is terminated anteriorly by the coronoid process. This is a pointed process with two borders and two surfaces ; the inner surface presents a ridge, commencing at the tip, and becoming continuous with the inner edge of the alveolus. To this ridge, to the area of bone in front of it and the tip of the coronoid process, the temjjoird muscle is inserted; its outer surface affords attachment to the masseter and a few fibres of the temjjoral. The anterior border of the ramus is continuous with the external oblique line on the body of the bone. Blood-supply.—The mandible is very vascular, and receives a large supply from Fig. 78.—The Mandible. (Inner view.)

Ossification.—The mandible has six points of ossification for each lateral half. All these, with the exception of one, are deposited in membrane. The nuclei are deposited very early (between the sixth and eighth week), and fuse so rapidly that observations on the development of this bone are unusually difficult.THE MANDIBLE 71 Its six centres are mainly named according to their position. The mento-Meckelian. —This is deposited in the distal end of Meckel's (mandi- bular) cartilage, and gives rise to that portion of the bone between the symphysis and the mental foramen. Fict. 79.—The Mandible at Birth. The dentary.—This forms the lower border and outer plate, and supports the teeth, hence its name. The coronoid.—This gives rise to the process of that name. Fig. 80.—The Skull of an Old Woman Eighty-three Years old, to show THE Changes in the Mandible, and Maxilla. The condyloid.—This forms the condyle and adjacent portion of the neck of the bone. The angular.—This gives rise to the angle of the bone. The splenial.—This centre appears three weeks later than the portions already72 THE SKELETON mentioned. It forms the inner plate of the mandible from near the symphysis to the mandibular foramen. The mandibular spine represents the posterior extremity of the splenial. Its line of junction with the dentary is indicated in the adult bone by the mylo-hyoid groove. At birth the mandible is represented by two nearly horizontal troughs of bone lodging unerupted teeth. Each half is joined at the symphysis by fibrous tissue. The upper edge of the symphysis and the condyles are nearly on a level. The mandibular nerve lies in a shallov/ groove between the dentary and splenial plates. During the first year the two halves ankylose, union taking place from below upwards, but the ankylosis is not complete until the second year. After the first dentition, the ramus forms with the body of the mandible an angle of about 140°, and the mental foramen is situated midway between the upper and lower borders of the bone opposite the second milk-molar. In the adult, the angle formed by the ramus and body is nearly a right angle, and the mental foramen is opposite the second bicuspid, so that its relative position remains unaltered after the first dentition. In old age, after the fall of the teeth, the alveolar margin is absorbed, the angle formed by the ramus and body becomes obtuse, and the mental foramen approaches to the alveolar margin. In a young and vigorous adult the mandible is, with the exception of the petrosal, the densest bone in the skeleton, and resists decay longest; in old age it becomes exceedingly porous, and often so soft that it may be broken easily. THE HYOID, THE STYLOID PEOCESS, AND THE EAR BONES The hyoid or lingual bone consists of a body and four processes. The body (basi-hyal) forms the central portion of the bone ; it is somewhat oblong in shape. Its anterior aspect is convex and divided by a longitudinal ridge into a superior and an inferior portion. Frequently it presents a median vertical ridge, and at the point where the horizontal and vertical ridges intersect, a tubercle, sometimes measuring four millimetres in length, is formed. The whole of the anterior surface is crowded with the origin and insertions of muscles. The posterior surface is deeply concave, and frequently presents several small depressions near the middle line which lodge accessory thyroid bodies. The inferior border is free, the superior gives attachment to the thyro-hyoid membrane. Between this membrane and the concavity of the hyoid a large bursa is occasionally found. The lateral borders are in relation with the greater cornua, but remain separated from them until late.in life. Fig. 81.—The Hyoid.73 HYOID BONE AND STYLOID PBOCESS The greater corniia (thyro-hyals) project backwards and upwards. Their upper and lower borders and anterior surfaces are occupied with muscles. Each corner terminates posteriorly in a rounded tubercle, to which the thyro-hyoid ligament is attached. The lesser cornua (cerato-hyals) are small conical pieces of bone occupying the upper part of the suture between the body and the greater cornua. Their tips are continuous with the stylo-hyoid ligaments. Muscles attached to the hyoid bone :— Lingualis. Digastric. Mylo-hyoid. Genio-hyo-glossus. Grenio-hyoid. Hyo-glossus. Middle constrictor. Thyro-hyoid. Hyo-epigiottideus Sterno-hyoid. Omo-hyoid. (when present). Ligaments:— Thyro-hyoid. Stylo-hyoid ; and the thyro-hyoid membrane. Blood-supply.—The hyoid receives twigs from the arteries supplying the muscles attached to it, in addition to direct supply from the superior thyroid and lingual arteries. Ossification.—At the third month the hyoid consists of hyaline cartilage ; it is directly continuous with the styloid process. In the fourth month a nucleus appears on each side of the middle line ; they become quickly confluent to form the body of the bone. In the fifth month each greater cornu has a conspicuous nucleus. The centres for the lesser cornua are delayed until the second year. The greater cornua remain separate from the body until after middle life. The lesser cornua rarely ankylose with the body of the bone. As a rule, they are small and inconspicuous ; occasionally they are very long, and are sometimes continuous with the styloid process of their respective sides. The styloid process is a thin cylindrical spike of bone wedged in between the tympanic plate and the petrosal immediately anterior to the stylo-mastoid foramen. It consists of two parts : a tympano-hyal segment which in the adult is hidden behind the tympanic plate, and a free projecting portion of variable length. As a rule it varies from five to fifty millimetres. When short it is hidden by the vaginal process, but it may reach to the hyoid bone. Its base forms the anterior boundary of the stylo-mastoid foramen. The free portion gives origin to the following muscles : The stylo-pharyngeus arises from the base posteriorly ; the stylo-hyoid from the outer aspect near the middle; and the stylo-glossus from the front near the tip. The extremity of the process is continuous with the stylo-hyoid ligament. A band of fibrous tissue—the stylo-mandibular ligament—passes from the process below the origin of the stylo-glossus to the angle of the mandible. Muscles attached to the styloid process :— Ligaments:— Stylo-glossus. Stylo-hyoid. Stylo-hyoid. Stylo-mandibular. Stylo-pharyngeus. The morphology and development of this process are described on page 98. The malleus.—This is the most external of the auditory ossicles, and comes in relation with the tympanic membrane. Its upper portion, or head, is lodged in the attic of the tympanum. It is of rounded shape, and presents posteriorly an elliptical depression for articulation with the incus. Below the head is a constricted portion or neck. From beneath the neck three processes diverge. The largest is the handle or manubrium, which is slightly twisted and flattened. It forms an obtuse angle with the head of the bone, and lies between the membrana tympani and the mucous membrane covering its inner surface.74 THE SKELETON The tensor tympani tendon is inserted into the manubrium near its junction with the neck on tlie inner side. The slender process (gracihs or Fohan) is a long, slender, delicate spiculum of bone (rarely seen of full length except in the foetus), projecting nearly at right angles to the anterior aspect of the neck, and extending obliquely downwards. It lies in the Glaserian fissure, and in the adult usually becomes converted into connective tissue, except a small basal stump. The short process is a conical projection from the outer aspect of the base of the manubrium. Its apex is connected to the upper part of the tympanic membrane, and its base Fig. 82.—The Ear Bones. (Modified from Henle.) LEFT MALLEUS FOSSA FOR INCUS SHORT PROCESS- ANTERIOR CRUS POSTERIOR CRUS" HEAD OF MALLEUS SHORT PROCESS SLENDER PROCESS HANDLE OR MANUBRIUM ARTICULAR SURFACE FOR MALLEUS LONG PROCESS ORBICULAR TUBERCLE BASE OF STAPES receives the external ligament of the malleus. The malleus also gives attachment to the suspensory ligament, and to the long anterior ligament of the malleus which was formerly described as the laxator tijnipani muscle. The incus.—This bone is situated between the malleus externally, and the stapes internally. It presents for examination a body and two processes. The body is deeply excavated anteriorly for the reception of the head of the malleus.75 THE EAB BONES The short process projects backwards, and is connected by means of ligamentous fibres to the posterior wall of the tympanum, near the entrance to the mastoid antrum. The long^ process is slender, and directed downwards and inwards ; it lies parallel with the handle of the malleus. On the inner aspect of the distal extremity of this process is the orbicular tubercle, connected with the process by a narrow neck. Its free surface articulates with the head of the stapes. The orbicular tubercle is separate in early life. The stapes is the innermost ossicle. It has a head directed horizontally out- wards, capped at its outer extremity by a disc resembling the head of the radius. The cup-shaped depression receives the orbicular tubercle of the incus. The base occupies the the fenestra ovalis, and like this opening the inferior border is straight, and the superior curved. The base is connected with the head by means of two crura, and a narrow piece of bone called the neck. Of the two crura, the anterior is the shorter and straighter. The crura with the base form a stirrup- shaped arch, of which the inner margin presents a groove for the reception of the membrane which is stretched across the hollow of the stapes. In the early embryo this hollow is traversed by the stapedial artery. The neck is very short, and receives on its posterior border the tendon of the stajjedms muscle. THE EXTEEIOR OF THE SKULL The skull, lohen vieioedfrom above, presents an oval outline ; the posterior part is broader than the anterior. The bones seen in this view are the frontal, parietals, and the interparietal portion of the occipital. In a skull of average width the zygomata come into view, but in very broad skulls they are obscured. The sutures of the vertex are :— The metopic, which is, in most skulls, merely a median fissure in the frontal bone just above the glabella ; occasionally it involves the whole length of the bone. It is due to the persistence of the fissure normally separating the two halves of the bone in the infant. The sagittal is situated between the two parietals, and extends from the bregma to the lambda. The coronal lies between the frontal and parietals, and extends from pterion to pterion. The lambdoid is formed by the ]Darietals and interparietal portion of the occipital. It extends from asterion to asterion. The occipital suture is only present when the interparietal exists as a separate element (fig. 35). The more important regions are :— The bregma, which indicates the situation of the anterior fontanelle, and marks the confluence of the coronal, sagittal and, when present, the metopic sutures. The lambda, where the sagittal enters the lambdoid suture ; it marks the situation of the posterior fontanelle. The obelion, a little anterior to the lambda, is usually indicated by a median or two lateral foramina. It indicates the spot where the sagittal suture first suffers obliteration. Vieioed from behind, the skull appears irregularly globular ; the inferior part of its circumference being somewhat flattened. The limits of the flattened portion are indicated by the mastoid processes. The centre is occupied by the occipital protuberance ; this, with the occipital crest and the three pairs of nuchal lines, give to the lower half a rough and uneven appearance. The -sutures in this view are the terminations of the sagittal, lambdoidal and, when present, the occipital suture.76 THE SEELETOX The occipital point (fig. 04) is the most posterior part of the skull, and is exactly opposite the ophryon. The inion corresponds to the external occipital protuberance. The lateral aspect of the skull is very uneven; it presents three recesses or fossfe. Its irregularity is increased by the zygoma. The temporal fossa, semilunar in shape, is limited above by the superior temporal ridge, and below by the zygoma. The temporal ridge begins at the external angular process of the frontal bone, and curves upwards and backwards to cross the frontal and parietal bones ; it then Fig. 83.—The Skull. (Norma lateralis.) descends along the mastoid portion of the temporal bone to become continuous with the upper border of the zygoma. In many skulls this ridge is double. The lower ridge gives origin to the temjwml muscle. The upper is the least constant; it diverges from the lower ridge as it approaches the coronal suture. At the middle of the parietal bone the two ridges are often ten milhmetres apart. This ridge gives attachment to tlie temporal fascia. The fossa is almost entirely occupied by the temjxjral muscle. The zygomatic fossa is limited anteriorly by the zygomatic surface of the maxilla ; internally by the external pter^'goid plate; externally by the zygomatic arch and the ramus of the mandible ; and posteriorly by a line drawn from the foramen spinosum to the zygomatic tubercle. The outer surface of the greater77 THE SPHENO-MAXILLABY FOSSA wing of the sphenoid behind the pterygoid ridge and a small piece of the squamosal form part of the upper boundary of the fossa. The chief objects of interest in this region are :—The spheno-maxillary and pterygo-maxillary fissures, the pteryg^oid ridge on the sphenoidal wing, the fora- men ovale, foramen spinosum, and the articular eminence of the squamosal. The spheno-maxillary fissure is horizontal in position, and lies between the orbital border of the maxilla and the greater wing of the sphenoid; externally it is completed usually by the malar ; frequently the sphenoid will join the maxilla and exclude the malar bone from the fissure; internally it is terminated by the zygomatic surface of the orbital process of the palate bone. Through this fissure the orbital, spheno-maxillary, and zygomatic fossae communicate. The zygomatic fossa lodges the temporal, external pterygoid, and internal p)terygoicl muscles. The pterygo-maxillary fissure forms a right angle with the preceding. It is situated between the maxilla and the anterior border of the external pterygoid process. At its lower angle the external pterygoid plate occasionally articulates Fig. 84.—A Section of the Skull, showing the Inner Wall of the Orbit, the Base of the Antrum, and the Spheno-maxillary Fossa. NASAL with the maxilla. The pterygo-maxillary fissure leads from the zygomatic fossa directly into the spheno-maxillary fossa, a small space shaped like an inverted pyramid, situated between the maxilla and the roots of the pterygoid processes. The roof of this fossa is formed by the under surface of the greater wing of the sphenoid. The anterior boundaries are a small portion of the zygomatic surface of the maxilla and the orbital process of the palate ; posteriorly it has the roots of the pterygoid pro- cesses, and the low^er part of the orbital surface of the greater wing of the sphenoid ; and internally the vertical plate of the palate bone. The apex of the pyramid leads into the posterior palatine canal. The inner wall presents the spheno-palatine foramen which leads into the nasal fossa. The posterior wall has three openings in the following order, from without inwards, and from above downwards: the foramen rotundum, Vidian canal, and pterygo-paiatine canal. Anteriorly it com- municates with the orbit by the spheno-maxillary fissure; and externally the pterygo-maxillary fissure leads into the zygomatic fossa. This fossa is mainly of interest on account of its relation to the spheno-palatine (Meckel's) ganglion. The various foramina and canals connected with the fossaTHE SKELETON 78 serve for the transmission of the nerves connected with this ganglion and the M terminal branches of the internal maxillary artery. In addition to the fossae, the lateral region presents the glenoid fossa with its articular eminence, the external auditory meatus, the mastoid and styloid processes, and the following sutures :— The spheno-parietal, which lies between the greater wing of the sphenoid and the anterior inferior angle of the parietal. The squamous is formed by the squamosal overlapping the lower border of the parietal. The parieto-mastoid, which lies between the posterior inferior angle of the parietal and the mastoid portion of the petrosal. The zygomatic suture is formed by the union of the zygoma with the malar bone. The squamo-spheiioidal is situated between the anterior border of the squamosal and the greater wing of the sphenoid. The spheno-malar suture is formed by the orbital process of the malar and the malar ridge on the greater wing of the sphenoid. Near its middle the suture is perforated by the spheno-malar foramen, which allows the temporal branch of the Fig. 85.—Hard Palate of a Child Five Years old. PALATE BONE orbital nerve and a branch of the lachrymal artery to escape from the orbit. This foramen in some adult skulls is complete in the malar. The fronto-squamosal is an occasional suture ; when it is present, the anterior \ inferior angle of the parietal is excluded from the greater wing of the sphenoid. The more important regions are :— The pterion, which marks the situation of the anterior lateral fontanelle, is the meeting-place of the coronal, squamous, spheno-parietal, squamo-sphenoidal, and the fronto-squamosal sutures. Frequently it is occupied in the adult by the epipteric ossicle. The asterion indicates the situation of the posterior lateral fontanelle and marks the confluence of the squamosal, parieto-mastoid, lambdoid, the occipito- mastoid, and occasionally the occipital sutures. Sometimes it is occupied by a Wormian bone. The stephanion is the spot where the superior temporal ridge cuts the coronal suture. The auricular point is the centre of the external auditory meatus. The base of the skull is very irregular, and extends from the incisor teeth to the occipital protuberance. Laterally it is limited by the zygomatic arches. Anteriorly ITHE BASE OF THE SKULL 79 it presents the hard palate. "When the skull is inverted the hard palate stands at a higher level than the rest; it is bounded anteriorly and laterally by the alveolar ridges containing the teeth. The bones appearing in the intermediate space are the pre-maxillary and palatine portions of the maxillae, and the horizontal plates of the palate bones. The bone is rough for the attachment of the muco- periosteum. The following points are readily recognised (fig. 85.) :— The meso-palatine suture commences at the alveolar point, traverses the anterior palatine fossa, and terminates at the posterior nasal spine. The transverse palatine suture between the palate bones and palatine processes of the maxillfe. In young skulls the maxillo-premaxillary sutures, and behind the incisor teeth four small openings known as the gubernacular canals. The anterior palatine fossa containing the termination of four canals : two small orifices, foramina of Scarpa, situated one behind the other in the meso- palatine suture; and two larger openings, the foramina of Stenson. Scarpa's jforamina transmit the naso-palatine nerves ; Stenson's are in relation with Jacob- son's organs. At the posterior angles of the hard palate are the posterior palatine foramina, through which the posterior palatine vessels and the anterior palatine nerves emerge on to the palate ; a thin lip of bone separates them from the accessory palatine foramina for the posterior palatine nerves. The accessory foramina are in the tuberosity of the palate bone. The hamular process of the internal pterygoid plate is the most posterior limit of the hard palate. At the posterior extremity of each alveolar ridge is the tuberosity of the maxilla. Between the tuberosities of the maxilla and the palate bone are a few minute foramina (variable in number and not always present), the external palatine canals for the external palatine nerves. Behind the hard palate are the posterior nares, separated from each other by the vomer. Each is bounded externally by the internal pterygoid plate ; below by the horizontal plate of the palate bone ; above by the under surface of the body of the sphenoid, with the ala of the vomer and a portion of the sphenoidal process of the palate bone. External to the nares there is on each side a vertical fossa lying between the pterygoid plates. It extends upwards to the under surface of the greater wings of the sphenoid; it is completed anteriorly by the coalescence of the pterygoid plates, and below by the tuberosity of the palate bone. It contains the follov/ing points of interest:— An elongated furrow, the scaphoid fossa, for the tensor 2^alati muscle. The general cavity of the pterygoid fossa which lodges the tensor palati and internal pterygoid muscles. Frequently there is a notch in the external pterygoid plate close beside the foramen ovale. The posterior termination of the Vidian canal. If a line be drawn across the skull base from one zygomatic tubercle to the other, it will fall immediately behind the external pterygoid plate and bisect the foramen spinosum on each side. A second transverse line, drawn across the opisthion or posterior margin of the foramen magnum, will fall behind the mastoid processes. The space between these imaginary lines may be called the suh-cranial region ; that behind the second line the sub-occipital region. In addition to these there is a lateral space anterior to the first line known as the zygomatic region. Each will require separate consideration. The suh-cranial region is formed by the following bones:—In the centre, the under surface of the bodies of the sphenoid and occipital bones. Laterally, theTHE SKELETON 80 Fig. 86.—The Skui-l.

The stylo-mastoid foramen for the stylo-mastoid artery and the exit of the facial nerve. The mastoid process with the digastric and occipital grooves. The suh-occiintal region presents chiefly muscular ridges. They are the superior, middle, and inferior nuchal lines, with the external occipital protuberance and the external occipital crest. Behind the mastoid process is an opening of variable size, the mastoid foramen ; a branch of the occipital artery enters, and a vein from the lateral sinus issues from this foramen. The anterior asi)ect of the skull is oval in outline, but presents a very irregular surface. Its upper portion, or forehead, presents the frontal eminences and super- ciliary ridges. In the middle line is the prominence formed by the nasal bones, with a deep pyramidal recess, the orbits, on each side. Below the nasal bones are the entrances to the nasal sinuses and the various recesses connected with them. The teeth form a conspicuous feature in this view of the skull, the outline of which is completed by the mandible. The bones visible in this view of the skull are: the frontal, nasals, lachrymals^ orbital surfaces of the lesser and the greater wings, and a portion of the body of the sphenoid, the ossa plana of ethmoid, and the orbital processes of the palate bones, the malars, maxillae, inferior turbinals, and the mandible. The foramina are : the supraorbital, infraorbital, optic, temporal, and mental; the lachrymal duct; the malar and ethmoidal canals ; and the spheno-maxillary and sphenoidal fissures. The orbits are two cavities of j^yramidal shape, which lodge the eyeball and its associated muscles, nerves, and vessels. The apex of each orbit corresponds ta the optic foramen, a circular orifice which transmits the optic nerve and ophthalmic artery. The base looks forwards and outwards. It is formed by the frontal bone above, the nasal process of the maxilla on the inner side, the malar bone externally, and below by the malar and body of the maxilla. The following points are seen around the base :—The suture between the external angular process of the frontal bone and the malar; the supraorbital notch (sometimes a complete foramen) ; and the suture between the frontal bone and the nasal process of the maxilla; and in the inferior segment of the circumference is the malo-maxillary suture. Occasionally, the infraorbital foramen opens by a narrow fissure into the orbit. The roof of the orbit is formed mainly by the orbital plate of the frontal bone, and completed posteriorly by the lesser wing of the sphenoid. At the outer angle it presents the lachrymal fossa for the lachrymal gland, and at the inner angle a depression for the pulley of the su])erior oblique muscle. The floor is formed by the orbital plate of the maxilla, the orbital process of the malar, and the orbital process of the palate bone. At its inner angle it presents the lachrymal canal, and near this a depression for the origin of the inferior oblique muscle. The floor has a furrow for the infraorbital artery and the superior maxillary di\usion of the fifth nerve. The furrow terminates anteriorly in the infraorbital canal, through which the infraorbital nerve and artery emerge on the face. Near the commencement of the canal a narrow passage, the anterior dental canal, runs forwards and downwards in the anterior wall of the antrum ; it conducts nerves to the incisor and canine teeth. The outer wall is very oblique ; it is formed by the orbital surface of the greater wing of the sphenoid, and the malar. Between it and the roof, near the apex, is the sphenoidal fissure, by means of vdiich the third, fourth, ophthalmic division of the fifth, and sixth nerves enter the orbit from the cranial cavity. The lower85 THE OBBITS margin of the fissure presents near the middle a small tubercle, from which one head of the external rectus muscle arises. Between the outer wall and the floor, . near the apex, is the spheno-maxillary fissure, which allows the superior maxillary nerve to enter the infraorbital groove from the spheno-maxillary fossa. At the anterior margin of the fissure, the sphenoidal wing occasionally articulates with the maxilla, but frequently it is excluded by the malar. In front of the anterior extremity of this fissure is the orbital orifice of the malar canal. Near the outer extremity of the sphenoidal fissure a few small foramina may be seen, especially in old skulls, which allow branches of the middle meningeal artery to creep into the orbit. A vertical fissure, the spheno-malar, traverses the outer wall. It contains a very small foramen (the spheno-malar), which allows the temporal branch of the orbital nerve to escape from the orbit. This foramen is sometimes confined to the malar bone. The inner wall, narrow and straight, is formed by the lachrymal, os planum of the ethmoid, and a part of the body of the sphenoid. The ethmoid section of 'the transverse suture contains the orifices of the anterior and posterior ethmoidal Fig. 90.—The Inner Wall of the Orbit. canals : the former transmits the nasal nerve and anterior ethmoidal artery ; the latter the posterior ethmoidal artery. Anteriorly is the lachrymal groove, and behind this the crest which gives origin to the tensor tarsi. This wall has three vertical sutures : one between the nasal process of the maxilla and the lachrymal, the ethmo-lachrymal, and one between the os planum and body of the sphenoid. Occasionally the sphenoidal turbinal bone appears in the orbit between the os planum of the ethmoid and the body of the sphenoid (fig. 67). The orbit communicates with the cranial cavity by the optic foramen and sphenoidal fissure; with the nasal fossa by means of the lachrymal duct ; with the zygomatic and spheno-maxillary fossae by way of the spheno-maxillary fissure. In addition to these large openings, the orbit has six other foramina— the infra- orbital, malar, spheno-malar, anterior and posterior ethmoidal canals, and the anterior dental canal—opening into it or leading from it. In old skulls the frontal sinuses occasionally extend into that portion of the horizontal plate of the frontal bone which forms the roof of the orbit.86 THE SKELETON The following muscles arise within the orbit:—the four recti, the superior oblique, and levator paljjebrcB superioris, near the apex ; the inferior oblique on the floor of the orbit external to the lachrymal canal; and the tensor tarsi from the lachrymal crest. The margins of the spheno-maxillary fissm^e give attachment to the orbitalis muscle. The nasal fossae or sinuses are two irregular cavities situated on each side of a median vertical septum, extending from the anterior part of the skull-base to the superior surface of the hard palate. They are somewhat oblong in section, but are narrower above than below. Each fossa presents a roof, floor, inner and outer wall, and opens in front by the anterior naris, and communicates behind with the pharynx by the posterior naris. The roof resembles that of a house with two sloping edges and an intermediate level portion. The anterior slope is formed by the posterior surface of the nasal bone and the nasal spine of the frontal. The horizontal portion corresponds to the cribriform plate of the ethmoid and the sphenoidal turbinal. The posterior Fig. 91.—Section through the Nasal Fossa to show the Septum. CRE SPI NASAL SPINE OF FRONTAL - CREST OF MAXILLA slope is formed by the inferior surface of the body of the sphenoid, an ala of th vomer, and a small portion of the sphenoidal process of each palate bone. The floor is wider than the roof, concave from side to side, and has a sligh backward slope. It is formed mainly by the palatine process of the maxilla and completed posteriorly by the horizontal plate of the palate bone. Near it anterior part, close beside the septum, is the anterior palatine canal. The septum, or inner wall, is formed by the crest of the sphenoid, the crest of the nasal bones, nasal spine of frontal, the mesethmoid, vomer, and the median crest formed by the apposition of the palatine plates of the maxillae and the hori- zontal plates of the palate bones. The anterior border has a triangular outline,, limited above by the mesethmoid, and below by the vomer. This receives the triangular cartilage of the nose. The posterior border is formed by the pharyngeal edge of the vomer. The septum is usually deflected to one side, and is occasionally perforated. Sometimes a strip of cartilage, continuous with the triangular cartilage, persists between the vomer and mesethmoid. The outer wall is formed by the nasal process and inner wall of the maxilla, the lachrymal, the ethmoidal and inferior turbinals, the vertical plate of the palate87 THE NASAL FOSS^ bone, and the inner surface of the internal pterygoid plate. The outer wall presents three recesses or meatuses. The superior meatus is situated between the superior and middle turbinal; it opens posteriorly; three orifices are in relation with it, namely, the orifice of the posterior ethmoidal cells, the spheno-palatine foramen, and the opening of the sphenoidal sinus. The middle meatus lies between the middle and inferior turbinals. It opens anteriorly and posteriorly. This meatus has two orifices communicating with it—the opening of the antrum (which is of very irregular shape) and the termination of the infundibulum. The inferior meatus is situated between the inferior turbinal and the floor of the fossa; it presents near its anterior part, under cover of the turbinal, the terminal orifice of the nasal duct. This is the largest meatus, and, like the middle, opens anteriorly and posteriorly. The anterior narial orifices are bounded above by the lower border of the nasal bones, laterally by the maxillae, and inferiorly by the premaxillary portions of the maxillge. In the recent state they are separated by the triangular cartilage ; in the dried skull the most anterior inferior limit is the anterior nasal spine. Fig. 92.—Section through the Nasal Fossa to show the Outer Wall WITH THE Meatuses. BODY OF SPHENOID SPHENOIDAL SINUS SPHENO-PALATINE FORAMEN MIDDLE MEATUS INTERNAL PTERYGOID PLATE PALATE BONE 'INE FORAMEN The posterior narial orifices are bounded above by the alae of the vomer, the sphenoidal process of the palate bones, and the under surface of the sphenoid ; externally by the internal pterygoid plates ; and inferiorly by the posterior border of the horizontal plates of the palate bones. They are divided by the posterior border of the vomer and the posterior nasal spine. The nasal fossae communicate with all the more important foss^ and sinuses of the skull. By means of the foramina in the roof they are in connection with the cranial cavity. The infundibulum brings each fossa in communication with the frontal and anterior ethmoidal cells. The posterior ethmoidal and the sphenoidal cells open into the superior meatuses. The spheno-palatine foramina connect them with the spheno-maxillary fossae, and an irregular orifice in each outer wall causes them to communicate with the antra. The nasal ducts connect them with the orbits, and the anterior palatine canals with the buccal cavity. The sutures visible in an anterior view of the skull are numerous, and for the most part unimportant:— The transverse suture extends from one external angular process to the other.88 THE SKELETON The upper part of the suture is formed by the frontal bone ; below are the malar, greater and lesser wing of the sphenoid, os planum, lachrymal, maxillary, and nasal bones. A portion of this complex suture, lying between the sphenoid and frontal bones, appears in the anterior cranial fossa. Other and less important fissures are the internasal, naso-maxillary, inter- maxillary, and malo-maxillary. The small sutures visible in the orbit have been already mentioned in describing that cavity. Fig. 93.—The Posterior Nares. VIDIAN CANAL PTERYGO-PALATINE CANALS SPINE OF PALATE OR POSTERIOR NASAL SPINE The following points are seen in an anterior view of the cranium :— The glabella, a smooth space between the converging superciliary ridges. The ophryon is the most anterior point of the metopic suture. The nasion is the central point of the transverse suture. The subnasal point is the middle of the inferior border of the anterior nasal aperture at the base of the nasal spine. The alveolar point is the centre of the anterior margin of the upper alveolar arch. THE INTEEIOE OF THE SKULL In order to study the interior of the skull it is necessary to make sections in three directions,—sagittal, coronal, and horizontal. This enables the student to examine the various points with facihty, and displays the great proportion the brain cavity bears to the rest of the skull. The sagittal section should be made slightly to one side of the median line in order to preserve the nasal septum. The black line (fig. 94) drawn from the basion (anterior margin of the foramen magnum) to the gonion (the anterior extremity of the sphenoid) represents the basi-cranial axis; whilst the line drawn from the gonion to the subnasal point lies in the basi-facial axis. These two axes form an angle termed the cranio-facial, which is useful in making comparative measurements of crania. A line prolonged vertically upwards from the basion will strike the bregma. This is the basi- bregmatic axis, and gives the greatest height of the cranial cavity. A line drawn from the ophryon to the occipital point indicates the greatest length of the cranium. Near its middle, the cranial cavity is encroached upon by the petrosal; theINTEBIOB OF THE SKULL 89 walls are channelled vertically by narrow grooves for the middle and small meningeal arteries, and towards the base broader furrows are found for the venous sinuses. The coronal section is most instructive when made in the basi-bregmatic axis. The section will pass through the petrosal in such a way as to traverse the two external auditory passages and expose the tympanum and vestibule, and will also partially traverse the internal auditory meatuses. Such a section wdll divide the ' parietal bones slightly posterior to the parietal eminences, and a line drawn transversely across the section at the mid-point will give the greatest transverse measurement of the cranial cavity. A skull divided in this way facilitates the examination of the parts about the posterior nares. The horizontal section of the skull should be made through a line extending j from the ophryon to the occipital point, passing laterally a few millimetres above I the pterion on each side. It is of great advantage to study the various parts on Fig. 94.—The Skull in Sagittal Section. BREGMA I the floor of the cranial cavity in a second skull having the dura mater and its various processes in situ. The floor of the cranial cavity presents three irregular depressions termed the anterior, middle, and posterior foss^. I The anterior fossa.'—The floor of this fossa is on a higher level than the rest of the cranial floor. It is formed by the horizontal plate of the frontal bone, the I cribriform plate of the ethmoid, and the lesser wings of the sphenoid, which meet each other and exclude the pre-sphenoid from the anterior fossa. The free margins of the lesser wings and the optic groove mark the limits of this fossa posteriorly. The central portion of the fossa is depressed on each side of the crista galli, the depressions forming a part of the roofs of the nasal sinuses ; laterally, the floor of this fossa is convex where it corresponds to the roof of the orbits, and is marked by irregular furrows. It supports the frontal lobes of the cerebrum. The sutures traversing the floor of the fossa are the fronto-ethmoidal, forming three sides of a j rectangle, that portion of the transverse facial suture which traverses the roof ofTHE SKELETON 90INTEBIOB OF THE SKULLTHE SKELETON 92 the orbit, and the ethmoido-sphenoidal suture, the centre of which corresponds to the gonion. The points of interest in the fossa are :— A groove for the superior longitudinal sinus. The foramen csecum which transmits a small vein. The crista galli. The ethmoidal fissure for the nasal branch of the fifth nerve. The cranial orifice of the anterior ethmoidal canal, transmitting the nasal branch of the fifth and a meningeal branch of the anterior ethmoidal artery. Ethmoidal foramina for the olfactory filaments. Cranial orifice of the posterior ethmoidal canal, transmitting a meningeal branch of the posterior ethmoidal artery. The ethmoidal spine of the sphenoid. Furrows for meningeal arteries. The middle cranial fossa presents a central isthmus and two lateral depressed portions. It is limited anteriorly by the posterior border of the lesser wings of the sphenoid and the anterior margin of the optic groove. The posterior limits are the | dorsum ephippii and the superior border of the petrosals. Laterally it is bounded j by the squamosals and the parietal bones. The floor is formed by the body i and greater wings of the sphenoid, and the anterior surface of the petrosal. It | contains the following sutures : spheno-parietal, petro-sphenoid, squamo-sphenoidal, squamous, and a portion of the transverse suture. The central portion or isthmus of the middle fossa possesses the following points from before backwards: — The optic groove, which lodges the optic chiasma. The optic foramina, transmitting the optic nerve and ophthalmic artery. The olivary process, indicating the line of ankylosis between pre- and post- sphenoid. The anterior clinoid processes. The pituitary fossa, with the middle clinoid processes, and grooves for the internal carotid arteries. The dorsum ephippii, with the posterior clinoid processes, and notches for the third pair of cranial nerves. This central depression is in direct relation with the parts of the brain sur- rounding the circle of Willis. The lateral deiwessions receive the temporo-sphenoidal lobes of the brain, and are marked by numerous furrows roughly corresponding to the convolutions of the cerebrum. Numerous narrow^ diverging channels pass upwards from the fossa towards the vertex; these lodge the ramifications of the middle and small meningeal arteries. The following openings occur on each side of this fossa :— The sphenoidal fissure, leading into the orbit and transmitting the third, fourth, ophthalmic division of the fifth, the sixth nerve, and ophthalmic vein. In the greater wing of the sphenoid near its uilion with the frontal bone there are small openings allowing twigs of the middle meningeal artery to enter the orbit. The foramen rotundum, which conducts the second division of the fifth nerve into the spheno-maxillary fossa. The foramen ovale : this transmits the third division of the fifth with its motor root, the small meningeal artery, and the small superficial petrosal nerve. The foramen Vesalii (not always present) for a small vein. The foramen spinosum, for the middle meningeal artery and its vense comites. The sphenotic foramen (middle lacerated foramen), which transmits at its inner angle the internal carotid artery, with the carotid plexus of nerves. On the posterior wall of this fossa the objects of interest are :— A depression which lodges the Gasserian ganglion. The hiatus Fallopii, for the great superficial petrosal nerve, and a twig from the middle meningeal artery.INTERIOR OF THE SKULL 93 A foramen for the small superficial petrosal nerve. An eminence formed by the superior semicircular canal. Anterior and slightly external to the ridge formed by the superior semicircular canal, the bone is exceedingly thin and translucent. This is the roof of the tympanum (tegmen tympani). When the dura mater is in situ, the depression lodging the Gasserian ganglion is converted into a foramen, traversed by the fifth nerve. The notch in the side of the dorsum ephippii for the third nerve is also a foramen when the dura mater is present. In many skulls the middle clinoid process is pro- longed to meet the anterior clinoid process, and thus forms a foramen for the internal carotid artery. The grooves for the middle meningeal arteries are some- times canals or tunnels in a part of their course, especially in old skulls. The grooves radiate from the foramen spinosum and extend to the vault. The bones most deeply marked are the squamosal, the greater wing of the sphenoid, and the parietal. The posterior cranial fossa is the deepest portion of the cavity. It is bounded by the dorsum ephippii and the superior borders of the petrosals, the mastoid portion of the petrosals, the posterior inferior angle of the parietals, and the squamo- occipital below the level of the crest (supra-occipital). The upper limits are indicated by the grooves for the lateral sinuses. It is marked by the following- sutures :—the petro-occipital, occipito-mastoid, parieto-mastoid, and, in young skulls, the basilar suture. The ridges limiting this fossa give attachment to the tentorium cerebelli, and the fossa lodges the cerebellum with the pons and medulla. It communicates with the general cranial cavity by means of the foramen of Pacchionius when the tentorium is in situ. It has the following objects of interest:— The clivus, extending from the dorsum ephippii to the anterior margin of th'e foramen magnum. This is in relation with the basilar artery, the pons, and medulla. The notch for the sixth nerve on each side of the dorsum ephippii. This is sometimes a foramen, termed the petro-sphenoid. The foramen magnum, presenting on each side a tubercle for the check ligaments ; and the anterior condyloid foramen (sometimes subdivided by a spiculum of bone) for the hypoglossal nerve. Behind the foramen there is a vertical ridge of bone, the internal occipital crest, for the falx cerebelli. This sometimes presents a depression known as the vermiform fossa. The anterior boundaries of the fossa present:— A notch for the passage of the fifth nerve. This is a foramen when the tentorium is present. The internal auditory meatus, for the facial and auditory nerves, and the auditory branch of the basilar artery. The jugular foramen, which transmits the glosso-pharyngeal, vagus, and spinal accessory nerves, the internal jugular vein, and the meningeal branch of the ascending pharyngeal artery. The termination of the groove for the lateral sinus, with the internal orifice of the mastoid foramen. The cranium of an average European has a capacity of 1450 cc. The circum- ference, taken in a plane passing through the ophryon anteriorly, the occipital point posteriorly, and the pterion laterally, is 52 cm. The length from the ophryon to the occipital point is 17 cm. ; the loidth between the parietals at the level of the zygomata is 12"5 cm. ; and the height from the basion to the bregma is nearly the same. The cranio-facial angle is about 96°.THE SKELETON 94 THE TEETH An adult individual with perfect dentition possesses thirty-two teeth, equally distributed to the maxiha and mandible. The four central teeth in each dental arch are termed incisors ; the tooth next these on each side is the canine ; behind these are two pre-molars or bicuspids ; and lastly, three molars. This relation of teeth is expressed by means of a formula :— Each tooth has a portion coated with enamel exposed above the gum—named the crown; and a portion coated with cementum embedded in bone—this is the root. The hne of union of the crown and root is termed the neck. Fig. 97.—The Teeth of an Adult. INCISORS CANINE BICUSPIDS MOLARS WISDOM TOOTH The surface of the tooth directed towards the lips and cheek is called labial, and that towards the tongue lingual. It is also necessary to apply definite terms to the opposed surfaces of teeth, hence the surface directed towards the middle line of the mouth if the alveolar arch were straightened out is median, and the opposite side is distal. Each tooth has distinguishing features. The incisors.—The central upper incisors are very much larger than the lateral, the crown is somewhat oblong in outline, its length exceeding the breadth. The median is longer than the distal border. The labial surface is convex, the lingual concave, and terminates near the gum in a low eminence, the basal ridge or cingulum. In recently erupted teeth, the cutting edge is elevated into three small cusps ; these soon Avear down and leave a straight edge. The root is long, single, and flattened laterally. The upper lateral incisors are much smaller than the centrals, which they resemble in the general contour of the crown. The distal angle of the crown is more rounded than in the central incisors, and the cingulum is more pronounced. The root is single. The lower central incisors are much narrower than those of the upper set, and less than half their width in the cutting edges, and the crown becomes contractedTHE TEETH 95 towards the neck. The cingukim is scarcely marked, and the root single. The lower lateral incisors are distinctly larger than the lower centrals in every direction. The distal angle of the crown is rounded off; the root is single and frequently presents on each side a longitudinal groove. The canines.—These differ from the incisors in possessing larger crowns, and thick long roots. The crown ends in a blunt point, and the cutting edge slopes away on each side. The slope toward the bicuspid is the longer, and causes the crown to be asymmetrical. The lingual surface presents a median and two lateral ridges ; they converge towards the well-marked cingulum, which is often produced into a distinct cusp. The lower canines have not such pronounced features as the upper; the point is blunter, and the median ridge is absent from the lingual surface. Premolars or bicuspids.—The crown of the first upper premolar has a grinding surface which is somewhat quadrilateral in outline ; the labial is, however, longer than the lingual border. It has two cusps, of which the labial is much the larger. The cusps are separated by a pit, but are connected by a narrow ridge along the median and distal borders. The median border is nearly straight, the distal is convex. The root may be single, or marked by a longitudinal depression, or be double throughout the greater part of its length ; it may in some specimens have three distinct roots like a molar. Fig. 98.—A Molar Tooth in section, and a Canine Tooth. The second bicuspid differs from the first in having its cusps nearly equal in size. Its root is double. The lower bicuspids are smaller than the upper and differ from them in shape. The labial cusp is larger than the lingual; the cusps are connected by a low ridge, the grinding surface presents two small pits. The root is single, rounded, and tapering. The second lower bicuspid is larger than the first. The inner cusp is higher and stouter,, and the distal border is much more pronounced. Its root is also single and tapering. The upper molars.—The first and second resemble each other so closely that one description will serve for the two. The grinding surface is quadrilateral but with rounded angles. It has four cusps, tw^o labial and two lingual. Of these, the anterior lingual is the largest, and is connected with the posterior labial by a ridge of enamel. The groove separating the labial and lingual cusps extends on to the sides of the crown and is lost near the neck. The median and distal borders usually present a slight ridge. The roots are three in number, two on the labial, and one on the lingual aspect; this last is usually referred to as the palatine root, and often diverges from the crown at a considerable angle. The lower molars.—The first is the most constant in form. It has five cusps on the grinding surface. Four occupy the angles and are separated by a crucial fissure. The fifth cusp is situated at the posterior extremity of the longitudinal ridge. It has two roots, placed one in front of the other ; they are inclined somewhat96 THE SKELETON baclnvards, and present a vertical groove which is sometimes so deep as to divide each root, producing four roots. One root only may divide in this way. The second molar differs from the first in the frequent absence of the fifth cusp ; when present it is feebly developed. The roots have a tendency to become confluent. The third molars {wisdom teeth).—The upper third molar resembles in its grinding surface the adjacent molars. The two lingual tubercles are usually blended, and the roots coalesce and taper to a cone. The apex is often bent. The characters of this tooth are very variable. The third lower molar has a larger crown than the corresponding tooth in the upper set; it resembles the adjacent molars and has usually five cusps. It has two roots which may be confluent. The Belations of the Crowns of the Upper and Loioer Teeth to each other.— In a normal condition the upper teeth form a larger arch than the lower. The upper incisors and canines close in front of the loAver ; occasionally they fall upon, but rarely fall behind them. The labial tubercles of the bicuspids and molars Fig. 99 —The Temporary Teeth. INCISORS CANINE MILK MOLARS of the lovv^er jaw are received in the depressions between the labial and lingual tubercles of the upper set of teeth ; hence the labial tubercles of the upper overlap the corresponding tubercles in the lower teeth. In consequence of the difference in width of the crowns of the upper and lower incisors, it happens that in closure of the mouth each tooth impinges upon two teeth. The milk teeth.—These are smaller in number and size than the teeth of the permanent set. The formula is :— l|cl,.| = 20. The temporary teeth are smaller than their successors ; the enamel of the crown terminates in a thick edge ; and the tubercles on the crowns of the molars are less regular and pronounced. The incisors are similar to those of the permanent set, but the canines have shorter and broader crowns than their successors.97 THE SKULL THE MORPHOLOGY OF THE SKULL In Man the skull during development passes through three stages. At first the brain vesicles are enclosed in a sac of indifferent tissue which ultimately becomes tough and fibrous. This, the membranous cranium, is represented in the adult by the dura mater. Gradually the sides and base of the membranous cranium become cartilaginous: in due course osseous tissue appears in the membranous tracts, and later in the cartilage. Eventually an osseous box is formed, consisting of membrane-bones and cartilage-bones intricately interwoven. A study of the skull in the chondral stage is very instructive. It consists of two parts : (1) The skull proper; and (2) the appendicular elements. The skuU proper consists of three regions :— The basi-cranial or notochordal region, which ultimately gives rise to the chief parts of the occipital bone. Anterior to this is the trabecular region, from which the sphenoid is subsequently developed. The most anterior portion is the ethmo-vomerine region, from which the nasal septum and its associated cartilages arise. Wedged in on each side between the basi-cranial and trabecular regions is the complicated periotic capsule. The appendicular elements of the cranium are a number of cartilaginous rods, which Fig. 100.—The Chondro-Cranium. undergo a remarkable metamorphosis, and, in the adult, are represented by the ear-bones, 1 the styloid process, and the hyoid. The cbondro-cranium at the third month presents the following parts. Seen from above, the cartilage extends from the cranial base to a spot midway between the base and the vertex, shading oft' indefinitely on the dura mater. The conspicuous oval masses on each side are the periotic cartilages, in which the floccular fossae are conspicuous objects. Each periotic [cartilage is joined to the sphenoid by a strip, termed the sphenotic cartilage, which usually j persists in the adult skull. At this date the cartilage for the orbito-sphenoid (the so-called lesser wing) is co-extensive with the ali-sphenoid, and forms part of the lateral wall of the skuU. The snout-like appearance of the anterior part of the skull is caused by the fronto- nasal plate. On each side of the ethmo-vomerine plate near its anterior termination there are two small concave pieces of cartilage for Jacobson's organ. They are sometimes j referred to as the ploughshare cartilages owing to their shape. j The Metamorphosis of the Branchial Bars These rods of cartilage are named, from before backwards, the mandibular, byoid, and thyroid bars. They may with care be easily dissected in the foetus between the third and fourth months. Their metamorphosis is as follows :— The two extremities of the mandibular bar ossify ; the distal end ultimately forms that H98 THE SKELETON portion of the mandible adjacent to the symph^^sis; the proximal end ossifies as thej malleus. The intermediate portion disappears ; the only vestige which remains is a bandj of fibrous tissue, the spheno-mandibular ligament, extending from the spine of the sphenoid | to the spine of the mandible. [ The hyoid bar fuses distally with the th3^roid bar, and is represented by the hyoid bone, i Its proximal end becomes the incus, tympano-hyal, and styloid process ; the intervening strip i is represented in the adult by the stylo-hyoid ligament. i The styloid process has two centres of ossifica.tion. A nucleus appears anterior to the} st^do-mastoid foramen, and is known as the tympano-hyal. At bhth the true styloid: process is cartilaginous. In the second year it ossifies, and subsequently becomes firmly ankylosed to the tympano-hyal. Occasionally the h3"oid bar may ossif}^ throughout. When this is the case the styloid process reaches to the hyoid and replaces the stylo-hyoid ligament. i The stapes originates in a piece of cartilage which is traversed by the temporary | stapedial artery. Its centres of ossification require investigation. The internal pterygoid plate arises in a piece of cartilage which rej)resents the palato-quadrate of lower vertebrates. The internal pterygoid plate is an appendicular element engrafted on to the sphenoid.. In many mammals it is a separate bone throughout life. In the same way the styloid; process is an appendicular element ankylosed to the petrosal and the tympanic plate ; inj many mammals it remains separate throughout life. The skull at birth presents, when compared with the adult skull, several important audi interesting features. Its peculiarities may be considered under three headings :—The; peculiarities of the fcetal skull as a whole ; the condition of individual bones; thej remnants of the chondral skull. ! The general characters of the foetal skull.—The most striking features of the skuU a birth are, its relatively large size in comparison with the body, and the predominance o the cerebral over the facial portion of the skull; the latter is, in fact, very small. The frontal and parietal eminences are large and conspicuous; the sutures are absent. the adjacent margins of the bones of the vault are separated by septa of fibrous tissue! continuous with the dura mater internally and the pericranium externally; hence it isj difficult to separate the roof bones from the underlying dura mater, each bone being lodged as it were in a dense membranous sac. The bones of the vault consist of a single layeij The Skull at Birth Fig. 101.—The Cranium at Birth.MOBPHOLOGY OF THE SKULL 99 i| without any diploe, and their cranial surfaces present no digital impressions. Six mem- lii branous spaces exist, named fontanelles : two are median, named anterior and posterior; ii' and two exist on each side, termed anterior and posterior lateral fontanelles. Each angle of the parietal bones is in relation with a fontanelle. The anterior fontanelle is lozenge- t,.i, shaped, the posterior triangular. The lateral fontanelles are irregular in outline. Fig. 102.—The Cranium at Birth. Fig. 103.—The Cranium at Birth in Sagittal Section. Turning to the base of the skull, the most striking points are the absence of the mastoid processes and the large angle which the pterygoid plates form with the skull base, whereas m the adult the angle is almost a right one. The base of the skull is relatively short, and the lower border of the mental symphysis is on a level with the occipital condyles. H 2100 THE SKELETON The facial skeleton is relatively small in consequence of the small size of the nasal fossae ; these are as wide as they are high, and are almost filled with the turbinals. The Peculiarities of Individual Bones at Birth. The occipital consists of four distinct parts : the basi-occipital, two ex-occipitals, and the squamo-occipital; these four parts are united by hyaline cartilage. Compared with the adult bone, the following are the most important points of distinction:—There is no Fig. 104.—The Occipital at Birth. TH pharnygeal tubercle or jugular process; the squamo-occipital presents two deep fissures separating the interparietal from the supraoccipital portion, and extending nearly as far inwards as the occipital protuberance. The grooves for the lateral sinus are absent. The sphenoid in a macerated foetal skull falls into three pieces. The main portion consists of the united pre- and post-sphenoid with the orhito-sphenoids and lingulae. The Fig. 105.—The Sphenoid at Birth. VIDIAN CANAL LINGULA pre-sphenoid is quite solid and connected with the ethmo-vomerine cartilage, and presents no traces of the air sinuses which occupy this part in the adult skull. The pre-sphenoid by its upper surface forms part of the anterior cranial fossa, from which it is subsequently excluded by the orbito-sphenoids. The optic foramina are large and triangular in shape.MOBPHOLOGY OF THE SKULL 101 The lingulae stand out from the basi-sphenoid as two lateral buttresses, and the floor of the sella turcica presents the cranio-pharyngeal canal, which in a recent bone is occupied by fibrous tissue. The dorsum ephippii is yet cartilaginous. The ali-sphenoids with the pterygoid processes are separated from the rest of the bone by cartilage. The foramen rotundum is complete, but the future foramen ovale is merely a deep notch in its posterior border, and there is no foramen spinosum. The pterygoid processes are short, and each internal pterygoid plate presents a broad surface for articulation with the lingulae. The Vidian canal is a groove between the internal pterygoid plate, the lingula, and greater wing. Fig. 106.—The Temporal Bone at Birth. The temporal bone at birth consists of three parts (excluding the ear-bones): the petrosal, squamosal, and tympanic. The petrosal presents a large and conspicuous floccular fossa ; the hiatus Fallopii is a shallow bay lodging the geniculate ganglion of the facial nerve. There is a relatively large mastoid antrum, but no mastoid process. The styloid process is unossified, but the tympano-hyal may be detected as a minute rounded nodule of bone near the stylo-mastoid foramen. The squamosal has a very shallow glenoid fossa and a relatively large post-glenoid tubercle. The posterior part of the inferior border is prolonged downwards into an micinate process to close externally the mastoid antrum. Fig. 107.—The Temporal Bone at Birth. (Outer view.) POST-GLENOID TUBERCLE GLASERIAN FISSURE TYMPANIC ANNULUS PETRC-SQUAMOUS SUTURE PETROSAL STYLO-MASTOID FORAMEN TYMPANO-HYAL CAROTID CANAL The tympanic bone or annulus is a delicate horseshoe-shaped ossicle, attached by its anterior and posterior horns to the inferior border of the squamosal. The ear-bones are chiefly of interest from their size, for they are as large at birth as in the adult. The processus gracilis (Folian process) may be 2 cm. in length. The frontal consists of two bones separated by a median vertical (metopic) suture. The frontal eminence is very conspicuous, but the superciliary ridges and frontal sinuses are wanting. The nasal spine, which later becomes one of the most conspicuous features of this bone, is absent. There is no temporal ridge. The parietal is simply a quadrilateral lamina of bone, concave on its inner andTHE SKELETON 102 convex on the outer siu-face. The parietal emmence, which indicates the spot in which the ossification of the bone commenced, is large and conspicuous. The grooves for blood- sinuses, as in other cranial bones, are absent. Each angle of the parietal is in relation with a fontanelle. As in the adult, the anterior inferior angle of the bone is prolonged downwards towards the ali-sphenoid. The ethmoid consists of two lateral portions separated by the still cartilaginous ethmo- vomerine plate. The ethmoid cells are represented by shallow depressions, and the uncinate process is undeveloped. Fig. 108.—Temporal Bone at Birth. (Inner view.) The sphenoidal turbinals are two small triangular pieces of bone lying in the peri- chondrium on each side of the ethmo-vomerine plate near its jimction with the pre- sphenoid. (Indicated by the * in fig. 103.) The maxilla presents the following characters :—The maxillo-premaxillary suture is visible on the palatine aspect of the bone. The alveolar border presents five sockets for teeth. The infraorbital foramen communicates with the floor of the orbit by a deep fissure ; this fissure sometimes persists in the adult. The antrum is a shallow groove. The mandible at birth consists of two halves united by fibrous tissue in the line of the future symphysis. Each half is a bony trough lodging teeth. The trough is divided by thin osseous partitions into five compartments : of these, the fifth is the largest, and is often subdivided by a ridge of bone. The floor is traversed by a furrow as far forward Fig. 109.—The Frontal at Birth. as the fourth socket (that for the first milk molar), where it timis outwards at the mental foramen. This furrow lodges the mandibular (inferior dental) nerve and artery, which enter by the large mandibular foramen. The condyle is on a level with the mental extremity of the bone. The palate bones differ mainly fi^om the adult bone in that the vertical and horizontal plates are of the same length; thus the nasal foss£e in the foetus are as wide as they are high, whereas in the adult the height of each nasal fossa greatly exceeds the width.MOBPHOLOGY OF THE SKULL 103 Concerning the remaining bones little need be said. The vomer is a delicate trough of bone for the reception of the inferior border of the ethmo-vomerine plate ; its inferior border, that which rests upon the palate, is broad, and the bone presents quite a different appearance to the adult vomer. The nasal bones are short but broad; the malar and inferior turbinals are relatively very large; and the lachrymals are thin, frail, and delicate lamellfe. The hyoid consists of its usual five parts. There is a median nucleus for the basi- hyal, and one on each side for the greater cornua (thyro-hyals). The lesser cornua are cartilaginous. Fig. 110.—The Maxilla at Birth. PRE-MAXILLARY PORTION Outer view. Inferior view. Inner view. Remnants of the cartilaginous cranium.—It has already been pointed out that at an early date the base of the skull and the face are represented by hyaline cartilage, which for the most part is rej^laced by bone before birth. Even at birth remnants of this primitive chon- dral skull are abundant. In the cranium, cartilaginous tracts exist between the various j portions of the occipital bone, as well as at the line of junction of the occipital with the petrosal and sphenoid. The dorsum ephippii is entirely cartilaginous at birth, and the last portion of this cartilage disappears with the ankylosis of the basi-occipital and basi-sphenoid about the twenty-fifth year. A similar strip of cartilage lying between the jugular process and the jugular surface of the petrosal persists until late in life. A strip Fig. 111.—The Mandible at Birth. of cartilage unites the ali-sphenoids with the lingulas, and for at least a year after birth this cartilage is continuous with that which throughout life occupies the sphenotic (middle lacerated) foramen. A strip of cartilage exists along the posterior border of the orbito- sphenoid, and not infrequently extends outwards to the pterion. In the adult skull it is replaced by ligamentous tissue. The ethmo-vomerine plate is entirely cartilaginous, and near the end of the nose sup- ports the lateral nasal cartilages, remnants of the fronto-nasal plate. The fate of the ethmo-vomerine plate is instructive. The upper part is ossified to form the mesethmoid; the lower part atrophies from the pressure exerted by the vomer ; the tip remains as the104 THE SKELETON triangular cartilage. The lateral snout-like extremities of the fronto-nasal plate persist as the lateral cartilages of the nose. Among the appendicular elements of the skull, the styloid process and a large portion of the hyoid are cartilaginous at birth. The Nerve-foramina of the Skull The various foramina and canals in the skull which give passage to nerve? may be arranged in two groups, primary and secondary. Primary foramina indicate the spots where the nerves quit the general cavity of the dura mater, and as this membrane indi- cates the limit of the primitive cranium, a cranial nerve, in a morphological sense, becomes extra-cranial at the point where it pierces this membrane. In consequence of the com- plicated and extraordinary modifications the vertebrate skull has undergone, many nerves traverse, in the adult skull, bony tunnels and canals which are not represented in the less complex skulls of low vertebrates such as sharks, rays, &c. To such foramina and canals the terms secondary or adventitious may be applied. Nerve-foramina are further interesting in that they occupy sutures, or indicate the points of union of two or more ossific centres. To this rule the foramen rotundum is the only exception in the human skull. The Primary Foramina 1. Foramen magnum.—This is bounded by four distinct centres, the supra-, basi-, and two ex-GCcipitals. It transmits the spinal accessory nerve, the vertebral artery and its anterior and posterior spinal branches, the spinal cord and its membranes. 2. The anterior condyloid.—At birth this is a deep notch in the anterior extremity of the ex-occipital, and becomes a complete foramen when the basi- and ex-occipitals fuse. Occasionally it may be complete in the ex-occipital, but it indicates accurately the' line of union of these two elements of the occipital bone. It transmits the hypoglossal nerve, the meningeal branch of the ascending pharyngeal artery, and its vense comites. 3. Jugular foramen.—This occupies the petro-occipital suture, and is formed by the basi- and ex-occipital in conjunction with the petrosal. It transmits the glosso-pharyngeal, pneumogastric, and spinal accessory nerves, a meningeal branch of the ascending pharyn- geal artery, and receives the lateral and inferior petrosal sinuses. 4. Auditory.—This marks the point of confluence of the groups of centres termed pro- otic and opisthotic. It transmits the facial and auditory nerves with the auditory twig of the basilar artery. 5. Trigeminal.—This is only a foramen when the dura mater is present in the skull. It is a notch at the apex of the petrosal converted into a foramen by the tentorium. The main trunk of the trigeminal nerve with the small motor root traverses it to enter the Meckelian cave. 6. Petro-sphenoidal.—^This is a notch between the side of the dorsum ephippii and apex of the petrosal which becomes converted into a foramen by dura mater. Sometimes this ossifies, as in fig. 96. 7. Optic.—This foramen is formed by the confluence of the orbito- and pre-sphenoidal centres. It opens into the orbit and transmits the optic nerve and ophthalmic arter}'. The Secondary Nerve-foramina Foramina transmitting the various subdivisions of the fifth nerve.—The primary foramen of exit for the trigeminal nerve is formed partly of bone and partly of membrane at the apex of the petrosal. The three divisions of the nerve issue through secondary foramina. («) The sphenoidal fissure is an elongated chink, bounded above by the orbital wing and below by the greater wing of the sphenoid, internally by the body of the sphenoid, and externally by the frontal. It opens into the orbit, and transmits the third, fourth, first (ophthalmic) division of the fifth, and sixth nerves, also the ophthalmic vein. (6) The foramen rotundum is the only exception to the rule relating to the formation of nerve-foramina : it is probably a segment of the sphenoidal fissure. The foramen is really a canal running from the middle cranial fossa to the spheno-maxillary fossa, and transmits the second or maxillary division of the trigeminal. (c) Foramen ovale.—This at Ijirth is a gap in the hinder border of the greater wing (ali-sphenoid) of the sphenoid, and is converted into a foramen by the petrosal; sub- sequently it becomes complete in the sphenoid. It transmits the third (inferior maxillary) division of the trigeminal and the small or motor root, the small superficial petrosal nerve which occasionally passes through a separate foramen), and the small meningeal artery with its venge comites. The ethmoidal canals.—These commence in the suture between the os planum and the frontal bone, and traverse the space between the upper surface of the lateral massMOBPHOLOGY OF THE SKULL 105 of the ethmoid and the horizontal plate of the frontal, to emerge on the cribriform plate; they are situated outside the dura mater. The anterior foramen transmits the nasal branch of the ophthalmic, which subsequently gains the nasal cavity by passing through the nasal slit (ethmoidal fissure) beside the crista galli. The infraorbital canal indicates the line of confluence of the maxillary and malar centres of the superior maxilla; occasionally it is completed by the malar ; rarely it is incomplete above, and communicates by a narrow fissure with the orbit. It lodges the infraorbital nerve and artery. The spheno-malar foramen is situated in the suture between the malar and the greater I wing of the sphenoid (ali-sphenoid): it transmits the temporal branch of the orbital nerve I and a branch of the lachrymal artery. In the adult this foramen may be wholly confined I to the malar bone. The malar canals traverse the malar bone, and indicate the line of confluence of the j two chief centres for this bone. The malar twigs of the orbital nerve issue from them j accompanied by arterial twigs. The spheno-palatine foramen is a deep groove between the orbital and sphenoidal processes of the palate bone, converted into a foramen by the sphenoidal turbinal. It is traversed by the naso-palatine nerve and artery as they enter the nasal from the spheno- j maxillar}' fossa. I Scarpa's foramina are two minute openings in the meso-palatine suture where it is in I relation with the anterior j)alatine fossa. They are traversed by the naso-j)alatine nerves. The pterygo-palatine foramen is situated between the sphenoidal process of the palate bone, the internal pterygoid plate of the sphenoid, and the sphenoidal turbinal. The pterygo-palatine nerve and artery pass through it. The Vidian canal is trumpet-shaped : the narrower end is situated in the sphenotic foramen; the broader orifice opens on the posterior wall of the spheno-maxillary fossa. The canal is 10 mm. long; in the foetal skull it is a chink between the base of the interna j pterygoid plate, the ali-sphenoid, and the lingula of the sphenoid. The canal is traversed by the Vidian branch of the spheno-palatine ganglion and the Vidian artery. The posterior palatine canal is a passage left between the maxilla, the vertical plate and tuberosity of the palate bone, and the internal pterygoid plate ; it commences on the hard palate by the posterior palatine foramen. The descending palatine nerve and artery traverse this canal. Several foramina open from it. In the suture between the vertical plate of the palate bone and the maxilla, two small openings allow minute nerves to issue for the middle and inferior turbinals. In the fissures between the tuberosities of the palate and maxillee, and the pterygoid plates, the middle and external palatine nerves issue. These foramina are sometimes called accessory and external palatine canals. The mandibular or inferior dental canal runs between the dentar^y and splenial elements of the mandible. The posterior orifice of the canal is the mandibular (inferior dental) foramen ; the anterior orifice, the mental foramen, indicates the line of union of the mento-Meckelian and dentary centres. The mandibular nerve and artery enter the canal [ at its posterior orifice ; the mental foramen allows the mental nerve to escape from the canal accompanied by the mental arter3^ I Foramina transmitting the facial nerve and its branches.—The main trunk of the facial enters the internal auditory meatus and traverses the Fallopian canal. In the early i embryo the nerve lies on the petrosal, and is not covered in with bone until the fifth I month of foital life. The terminal orifice, the stylo-mastoid foramen, is situated between the tympanic, tympano-liyal, and epiotic elements of the complex temporal bone. The ' iter chordee posterius' is a chink between the squamosal and the tympanic elements, and allows the chorda tympani nerve to enter the tympanum. The fissure of exit for this nerve is the subdivision of the Glaserian fissure termed the canal of Huguier, or ' iter chordse anterius.' The Glaserian fissure lies between the tympanic plate and the squamosal. It transmits the tympanic branch of the internal maxillary artery, and lodges the slender process of the malleus. The spheno-maxillary fissure is situated between the posterior border of the orbital plate of the maxilla and a smooth ridge on the orbital surface of the greater wing of the sphenoid. It transmits the superior maxillary division (second) of the fifth nerve.106 THE SKELETON THE RIBS AND STERNUM The Ribs.—These form a series of narrow flattened bones, twenty-four in number, arranged in twelve pairs, extending from the sides of the thoracic vertebrae towards the median hne on the anterior aspect of the trunk. The first seven pairs are termed true ribs, because their anterior ends are connected by means of cartilage with the sides of the sternum. The lower five— false ribs—are subdivided into two sets : the eighth, ninth, and tenth are con- nected together by their costal cartilages ; the eleventh and twelfth have their anterior extremities free, and are called in consequence floating ribs. Thus the first seven are, vertebro-sternal; the eighth, ninth, and tenth, vertebro-chondral; the eleventh and twelfth, vertebral ribs. The ribs increase in length from the first to the seventh, and then decrease from this rib to the twelfth. In breadth they increase from behind forwards ; the greatest breadth of a rib is at its junction with the costal cartilage. The two or three upper ribs form nearly a right angle with the spine, but the succeeding set curve obliquely downwards. The obliquity is greatest at the ninth, and then decreases in the ribs below. Typical characters of a rib.—The seventh is regarded as the most typical rib. It presents a vertebral extremity or head; a narrow portion or neck ; a sternal end ; and an intermediate portion, the shaft. The head has two facets divided by a horizontal crest. The crest is connected by an interosseous ligament with an intervertebral disc ; the facets articulate with the demi-facets on the sides of the bodies of two vertebrae. As a rule, the lower facet is the larger, and articulates with the thoracic vertebra, to which the rib corresponds in number. This is the primary facet, and is the one represented in those ribs which possess only a single facet on the rib-head. The anterior margin is lipped for the costo-vertebral (stellate) ligament. The neck is that portion of the rib extending from the head to the tubercle. The posterior surface of the neck is in relation with the transverse process of the lower vertebra with which the head articulates ; it forms the anterior boundary of the costo-transverse foramen, and is rough where it gives attach- ment to the middle costo-vertebral ligament. The superior border of the neck is continuous with the corresponding border of the shaft, and at the point where the neck ends this border is produced so as to form a crest {crista colli superior) for the anterior costo-transverse ligament. The inferior border of the neck is continuous with the ridge of the subcostal groove. This difference in the relation of the neck to the upper and lower borders of the rib shaft is useful in deter- mining to which side a rib belongs. The tubercle consists of an upper part, rough for the posterior costo-transverse (rhomboid) ligament, and a lower faceted portion for articulation with the tip of the transverse process. The tubercle projects below the lower edge of the rib to form a crest {crista colli inferior), marking the beginning of the subcostal groove. The shaft has two surfaces and two borders. It is strongly curved. At first the curve is in the same plane as the neck, but it quickly turns forwards at a spot on the posterior surface of the shaft known as the angle, where it gives attach- ment to the sacro-lumhalis muscle and some of its subdivisions. The rib has also a second or upward curve beginning at the angle. These curves are expressed by describing the main curve as disposed around a vertical, and the second or upward curve around a transverse axis.THE BIBS 107 When a rib, except the first and twelfth, is laid with its lower edge upon the table, the rib-head rises and the rib touches the table at two places, viz. at the sternal end, and in the neighbourhood of the angle. The external surface of the rib is convex, and gives attachment to muscles. Fig. 112.—The Seventh Kib of the Left Side. (Seen from below.) Near its anterior extremity it forms a somewhat abrupt curve, indicated by a ridge on the bone, which gives attachment to the serratus magnus muscle, and is some- times called the anterior angle. The internal surface is concave and presents the subcostal groove near its108 THE SKELETON inferior border. The groove is best marked near the angle, and lodges the intercostal vessels and nerves. The ridge limiting the groove above is continuous with the inferior border of the neck of the rib ; it gives attachment to the internal intercostal muscles. The superior border is rounded, and affords attachment to the internal and external intercostal muscles. The inferior border commences abruptly near the angle, and gives attachment to the external intercostal muscles. The sternal end of the shaft is cupped for the reception of the costal cartilage. The seventh rib and its costal cartilage give attachment to the following muscles:— Internal intercostals (sixth and seventh). External intercostals (sixth and seventh). Levatores costarum (sixth and seventh). Infracostal (when present). Diaphragm. Transversalis. External oblique abdominis. Rectus abdominis (costal cartilage). Triangularis sterni (costal cartilage). Pectoralis major (costal cartilage). Serratus magnus. Ilio-costalis, or sacro-lumbalis. Musculus accessorius. Longissimus dorsi. It gives attachment to the following lig^aments :— Anterior costo-vertebral (stellate). Anterior costo-transverse. Middle costo-vertebral (interosseous). Posterior costo-transverse (rhomboid). Interosseous of rib-head. Blood-supply.—The ribs are very vascular and derive numerous branches from the intercostal arteries. The branches in the shaft run towards the rib-head. Those of the head and neck take a contrary direction, and run, as a rule, towards the shaft. In the neighbourhood of the tuberosity the vessels seem to run in any direction. Peculiar ribs.—Several of the ribs differ in many particulars from this general description. They are the first, second, tenth, eleventh, and twelfth. The first rib is the broadest and most sharply curved. The head is small, and, as a rule, is furnished with the only one' articular facet. The tubercle is large and prominent, the neck narrow. The shaft is broad, has no angle, and is curved around a vertical axis only. The anterior surface presents two shallow grooves separated near the superior border by a rough surface (Lisfranc's tubercle) for the scalenus anticus muscle. The groove in front of this surface is for the subclavian vein, the groove behind it is for the subclavian artery. Between the groove for the artery and the tubercle there is a rough surface for the scalenus meclkis muscle ; anterior to this rough surface and close beside the groove is an area from v.^hich the first digitation of the serratus magnus takes origin. The under surface is smooth and lacks a groove. The inferior border is thick, and rounded for the internal and external intercostal muscles. The costal cartilage of this rib fuses with the manubrium of the sternum; occasionally the sternal extremity and costal cartilage of this rib are replaced by fibrous tissue. When a well-developed cervical rib is present, the head of the first may present two facets as in a typical rib. The first rib, with its costal cartilage, gives attachment to the following muscles:— Internal intercostal. Subclavius (costal cartilage). External intercostal. Sterno-hyoid (costal cartilage). Levator costas. Pectorahs major (costal cartilage). Scalenus anticus. Serratus magnus. Scalenus medius. Musculus accessorius.109 THE BIBS Fig. 114.—The Vertebral Ends of Tenth, Eleventh, and Twelfth Eibs. ANGLE INGLE FACET. (SOME- TIMESTWO FACETS ARE PRESENT) X SINGLE FACET.

(THIS RIB HAS NEITHER TUBEROSITY, ANGLE, NOR NECK) .110 THE SKELETON Blood-supply.—This is derived mainly from the superior intercostal branch of the subclavian artery. The second rib, like the first, is strongly curved ; its posterior angle is faintly marked ; and the shaft, like that of the first, can lie flat on the table. It has a prominent anterior angle for the serratus magnus. It gives attachment to the following muscles :— Internal intercostals (first and second). Serratus magnus. External intercostals (first and second). Serratus posticus superior. Levator costse. Scalenus posticus. Pectoralis major (costal cartilage). Musculus accessorius. Blood-supply.—Superior intercostal branch of the subclavian artery, and the first aortic intercostal. The tenth rib has usually a single facet on its head. Occasionally a second is present. When this is the case, the ninth thoracic vertebra is not exceptional, and p resents two demi-f acets. The eleventh rib has a single facet on the head. The angle is feebly marked, and the subcostal groove shallow. It lacks a neck and tubercle. The twelfth rib has a large head furnished with one facet. The shaft is narrow, and its length extremely variable. It may be as short as 3 cm., or attain a length of 20 cm. (8''). The twelfth rib gives attachment to the following muscles :— The costal cartilages are bars of hyaline cartilage attached to the anterior extremities of the ribs ; they represent unossified epiphyses. Like the shaft of a rib, each has an outer and inner surface ; the outer surfaces give origin and insertion to large muscles ; and the inner surfaces, from the second to the seventh inclusive, are in relation with the triangularis sterni. The upper and lower borders serve for the attachment of the internal intercostal muscles. The upper seven cartilages, and occasionally the eighth, are connected with the sternum. The first fuses with the manubrium; the remaining six are received in small articular concavities, and retained by means of ligaments. The cartilages of the vertebro- chondral ribs are united to each other and to the seventh costal cartilage by ligaments (sometimes by short vertical bars of cartilage), and those of the vertebral ribs end freely. The inner surfaces of the lower six afford attachment to the diavhixigm and the transversalis muscle. The second, third, fourth, and fifth costal cartilages articulate Avith the sides of the sternum, at a spot corresponding to the junction of two sternebrcne. The sixth and seventh (and eighth when this reaches the sternum) are arranged irregularly. As a rule the sixth lies in a recess in the side of the fifth sternebra ; the seventh corresponds to the line of junction of the meso- and metasternum; and the eighth articulates with the metasternum. (See fig. 116.) Blood-supply.—The twigs for the costal cartilages are derived from the terminal twigs of the aortic intercostals, and from the internal mammary arteries. Development.—At the eighth week of intra-uterine life the ribs are cartila- ginous. About this date an earthy spot appears near the angle of each rib, and Internal intercostal. External intercostal. Levator costae. Diaphragm. Transversalis abdominis. External oblique. Internal oblique. Serratus posticus inferior. Musculus accessorius. Sacro-lumbalis or ilio-costalis. Erector spinas.

Whilst the ribs are in a cartilaginous condition, eight of them reach the sternum ; even after ossification has taken place, the costal cartilage of the eighth rib, in many instances, articulates with the sternum as late as the eighth month (fig. 116). This relationship may Fig, 115.—Eib at Puberty. epiphysis for the head. appears at epiphysis for tubercle. appears at fifteen; fuses at twenty-three fifteen; fuses at twenty-three persist through life, but usually the cartilage retrogresses, and is replaced by ligamentous tissue. About the fifteenth year a secondary centre appears for the head of each rib, and a little later one makes its appearance for the tubercle, except in the tenth, eleventh, and twelfth ribs. The secondary centres fuse with the ribs about the twenty-third year. The costal cartilage stands in relation to the rib-shafts as unossified epiphyses; the rib-shaft increases in length mainly at its line of junction with the costal cartilage. Variations in the Number and Shape of the Bibs The ribs may be increased in number by addition either at the cervical or lumbar end of the series, but it is extremely rare to find an additional rib or pair of ribs in both the cervical and lumbar region in the same subject. Cervical ribs are fairly common; as a rule they are of small size and rarely extend more than a few millimetres beyond the extremity of the transverse process. Occasion- ally they exceed such insignificant proportions and reach as far as the sternum : between these two extremes many varieties occur. As a rule, tha existence of a cervical rib is not detected until the skeleton is macerated ; hence we know little of the correlated arrange- ment of soft parts. In one fortunate case Turner was able to make a thorough dissection112 THE SKELETON of a specimen in which a complete cervical rib existed. Its head articulated with the body of the seventh cervical vertebra and had a stellate lio^ament. The tubercle was well developed, and articulated with the transverse process. The costal cartilage blended with that of the first thoracic rib, and gave attachment to the costo-clavicular ligament. Between it and the first thoracic rib there was a well-marked intercostal space occupied by mtercostal muscles. It received the attachment of the scalenus anticus and viedius muscles, and it was crossed by the subclavian artery and vein. The nerves of the inter- costal space were supplied in part by the eighth cervical and first dorsal. The artery of the space was derived from the deep cervical, which, with the superior intercostal, arose from the root of the vertebral. The head of the first thoracic rib in this specimen articulated with the seventh cervical, as well as with the first thoracic vertebrae. An interesting fact is also recorded in the careful account of this specimen :—There was no movable twelfth thoracic rib on the same side as this w^ell-developed cervical rib, and the twelfth thoracic vertebra had mammillary and accessory processes, and a strong elongated costal process, and was in Imear series with the lumbar transverse processes. Gruber and Turner from a careful and elaborate study of this question summarise the variations in the cervical rib thus :—It ina,y be very short and possess only a head, neck, and tubercle. When it extends beyond the transverse process, its shaft may end freely or join the first thoracic rib : this union may be effected either by bone, cartilage, or ligament. In very rare instances it may have a costal cartilage and join the manubrium of the sternum. Not infrequently a process, or eminence, exists on the first thoracic rib at the spot when it articulates with a cervical rib. Lumbar ribs are of less significance than cervical ribs and rarely attain a great length. Their presence is easily accounted for, as they are the differentiated costal elements of the transverse processes. They are never so complete as in cervical ribs, and articulate only with the transverse processes; the head never reaches as far as the body of the vertebra, and there is no neck or tubercle. An extra levator costce nmscle is associated with a lumbar rib. Not the least interesting variation of a rib is that known as the bicipital rib. This condition is seen exclusively in connection with the first tlioracic rib. The vertebral end consists of two limbs which lie in different transverse planes. These bicipital ribs have been especially studied in whales and man. This abnormality is due to the fusion of two ribs, either of a cervical rib with the shaft of the first thoracic; or the more common form, the fusion of the first and second true ribs. Among unusual variations of ribs should be mentioned the replacement of the costal cartilage and a portion of the rib-shaft by fibrous tissue, a process which occurs as a normal event, during development, in the eighth rib. Sometimes the shafts of two or more ribs may become miited by small quadrilateral plates of bone extending across the intercostal spaces. The sternum is a thin flat bone situated in the anterior Avail of the thorax. In the young subject it consists of six pieces, or sternebrae. Of these, the four middle fuse together to form the gladiolus (mesosternum); the superior remains distinct Fig. 116.—The Thorax at the Eighth Month. (On the left side eight cartilages reach the sternum.)113 THE STEBNUM throughout life as the manubrium (pre-sternum) ; and the lower segment, also distinct until very advanced life, is the xiphoid (metasternum). The anterior surface of the adult sternum is convex, and gives origin to the pectoralis major muscle of each side ; near its superior angle the sterno-mastoid muscle arises. This surface is traversed by five lines, indicating the former segmentation of this bone. The posterior surface is concave, and traversed by five lines correspond- ing to those on the anterior surface. At the upper part it gives origin to the sterno-hyoid and sterno-thyroid muscles. The posterior surface of the lower four segments gives origin to the triangularis sterni. The xiphoid is usually perforated ; a branch of each internal mammary artery traverses the foramen; and on each side of it a portion of the diaphragm is attached. Occasionally the xiphoid is bifid. The superior border presents the interclavicular notch, to which the fibres of the interclavicular ligament are attached; this border terminates at each end in an articular notch for the sternal end of the clavicle. The margins of the notch give attachment to the sternq-clavicular ligaments. The lateral borders of the sternum present a series of depressions, which receive the sternal extremities of the costal cartilages of the first seven ribs, and occasionally that of the eighth (see fig. 116). The borders intervening between these depressions or notches are in relation with the internal intercostal muscles. In order to appreciate the nature of these notches, it is advantageous to study the sternum in a young subject. Each typical sternebra presents four angles ; each angle presents a demi-facet. Between each sternebra there is an inter-sternebral disc ; when two sternebra are in position, each notch for a costal cartilage is formed by a sternebra above and below with an intersternebral disc in the middle, thus repeating the relation of the rib-head to the vertebral centra. Later in life these fuse more or less together, except in the case of the first and second sternebrge, which usually remain separate to the end of life. The first (pre-sternum) is the most modified of all the sternebra, and differs from them in the fact that the costal cartilage of the first rib is continuous with it, and in the fact that it supports the clavicles. Occasionally a rounded pisiform bone is seen on each side, immediately internal to the articular notch for the clavicle; these are the episternal bones. The last sternebra, or xiphoid, is the least developed and, though calcified in old age, rarely ossifies. Its tip is directly continuous with the linea alba, and the base gives slight attachment to the rectus abdominis muscle. The following muscles are attached to the sternum :— Pectoralis major. Triangularis sterni. Sterno-cleido mastoid. Transversalis. Internal intercostals. Diaphragm. Kectus abdominis. Sterno-hyoid. Sterno-thyroid. Ligaments.—In addition to the ligaments proper to the costal cartilages, the following require enumeration :— Interclavicular. Posterior sterno-clavicular. Anterior sterno-clavicular. Interarticular fibro-cartilage. Linea alba. Blood-supply.—The arteries of the sternum are derived mainly from the internal mammary arteries by direct branches termed sternal: many twigs are furnished by the perforating branches of the internal mammary, and also from the terminal twigs of the aortic intercostals. Development.—The sternum results from the fusion of the ventral ends of the cartilaginous bars which in the early embryo represent the ribs. At first these bars fuse together laterally, and for some time the sternum is represented by two I114 THE SKELETON I strips of cartilage separated by a median fissure. Very early this gap is bridge( over anteriorly. Nine costal cartilages are in relation with the sternum at thii stage. Gradually the lateral strips unite with each other to form the meso sternum. The ninth costal cartilage divides : one part remains attached to thi Fig. 117.—The Sternum. (Anterior view.)

The eighth cartilage may retain ts sternal attachment permanently. At first the sternum and costal cartilages are continuous ; a joint soon forms )etween the pre-sternum and metasternum. Gradually joints arise between Fig. 118.—The Sternum. (Posterior view.) FOR FIRST COSTAL CARTILAGE Diaphragm the costal cartilages and the sternum (except in the case of the first). The division of the metasternum into sternebrae is a still later process, and arises during the process of ossification. I 2THE SKELETON 116 Ossification.—The transformation of the sternum into bone is a slow andi irregular process. The pre-sternum (manubrium) has a mesial nucleus about the sixth month of intra-uterine life ; later, several smaller accessory centres may; appear. The mesosternum usually ossifies from seven centres. The second sternebra ossifies from a single median nucleus about the eighth month. Below this, three pairs of ossific nuclei appear, and they may remain long separate. Of these, two pairs for the third and fourth sternebrse are visible at birth. The pair for the fifth sternebra make their appearance towards the end of the first year. The various lateral centres unite in pairs, and at the sixth year the sternum consists of six sternebrae, the lowest (metasternum) being cartilaginous. Gradually the four pieces representing the mesosternum fuse with each other, and at twenty-five they form a single piece, but exhibit, even in advanced life, traces of their original separation. Fig. 119.—Two Stages in the Formation of the Cartilaginous Sternum. (After Enge.) A B The metasternum is always imperfectly ossified, and does not ankylose with the mesosternum till after middle life. The pre-sternum and mesosternum rarely fuse. The dates given above for the various nuclei are merely approximations, for they are extremely variable, not only in appearing, but in their number. The same remark applies also to the age at which the various segments ankylose ; hence the sternum affords very uncertain data as to age. Abnormalities of the Sternum.—The mode of development of the sternum as described above is of importance in connection with some deviations to which it i& occasionally subject. At an early period it consists of two lateral halves ; in some rare instances these have failed to unite, and thus give rise to the anomaly of a completely cleft sternum. The union of the two halves may occur in the region of the manubrium, but fail below this point; in some instances the upper and lower segments have duly coalesced with the opposite side, but union has failed in the middle segments. The clefts resulting from these failures of coalescence are in many instances so small as not to be of any moment, and not even recognised until the skeleton has been prepared. In a few individuals they have been so extensive as to allow the pulsation of the heart to be perceptible to the hand, and even to the eye, through the skin covering the defect in the bone. A common variation in the sternum is asymmetry of the costal cartilages. Instead of corresponding, the cartilages may articulate with the sternum in an alternating manner. The cause of this asymmetry is not very obvious.THE THORAX 111 THE THORAX j The thorax is a bony basket of conical shape, formed by the thoracic vertebrae, the ribs with their costal cartilages, and the sternum. The thorax is compressed antero-posteriorly so that it measures less in the sagittal than in the transverse axis : it is also deeper posteriorly than anteriorly. Its posterior boundaries are formed by the thoracic vertebrae and the ribs as far outward as their angles ; the backward Fig. 120.—The Thorax. (Front view.) curve of the ribs produces on each side of the vertebrae a deep furrow, the costo- vertebral groove, in which the erector sijince muscle and its subdivisions are lodged. The anterior boundary is formed by the sternum and costal cartilages. This surface is slightly convex, and has a slight inclination forwards in its lower part. The lateral boundaries are formed by the ribs from their angles to the costal cartilages. The top of the thorax presents an elliptical aperture, the thoracic inlet, which measures, on an average, 12-5 cm. (5'') transversely, and 6-2 cm. (2J") in its sagittal axis. The lower opening of the thorax is very irregular, and forms two curved lines ascending upwards from the last rib to the lower border of the gladiolus (mesosternum). These two borders form the sub-costal angle, and the xiphoid (metasternum) projects into the middle of it. The intervals between the ribs are the intercostal spaces, and are eleven in number on each side.THE SKELETON 118 TEE CLAVICLE The clavicle is a rod of bone passing from the top of the sternum to the acromion process of the scapula. It presents two curves: an inner, with the convexity directed forwards ; and an outer, the smaller, with the convexity directed backwards. The Fig. 121.—The Left Clavicle. (Superior surface, Anteeioe Peetoralis major Trapezius Posterior Sterno-mastoid clavicle consists, for descriptive purposes, of an outer flattened, and an inner prismatic portion. The outer third has two surfaces and two borders. The superior surface looks directly upwards, and a£fords attachment to the trcqjeziiis muscle posteriorly, and Fig. 122.—The Left Clavicle.

The inferior surface is rough, and at its most posterior part presents the tuberosity of the cla\icle; it overhangs the coracoid process and gives attachment to the conoid ligament. From the tuberosity a ridge, the oblique line, runs outwards and forwards ; to it the trapezoid ligament is attached. The anterior border is thin ; presents often a small prominence, the deltoid tubercle, and gives origin to the deltoid muscle. The posterior border is thick and rounded ; to it the trai^ezius is inserted. The inner two-thirds is prismatic in form; it has three surfaces and three borders. Of these, the anterior surface is convex and presents near the sternal end a rough surface for the sternal portion of the peetoralis major, and a rough surface above for the sterno-cleido-mastoid. Near the middle of the shaft it is smooth and covered by the thin platysma myoides; sometimes a small canal passes119 THE CLAVICLE it right angles through this surface of the clavicle ; it is traversed by a clavicular branch of the cervical plexus. The posterior surface is concave, and forms an arch over the brachial plexus and subclavian artery. The inferior surface com- mences externally as a groove for the suhclavius, the floor of the groove being continuous with the inferior surface of the outer third of the clavicle, and frequently presents the orifice of the nutrient foramen. Internally, this groove becomes very narrow, and runs on to the rough surface for the rhomboid ligament. On the sternal side of the rhomboid impression there is often a facet where the clavicle plays on the first costal cartilage. Close beside this facet the sterno-hyoid finds an attachment, and occasionally the sterno-thyroid. Of the three borders, the superior separates the anterior and posterior surfaces ; it is faintly marked towards the sternal end ; externally, it becomes continuous with the posterior border of the outer third. The anterior border separates the anterior and inferior surfaces : it is continuous with the anterior border of the flattened portion. The posterior border separates the inferior and posterior surfaces, and forms the posterior lip of the groove for the suhclavius ; it begins at the conoid tubercle, and ends at the rhomboid depression. The inner or sternal end of the clavicle is broad and expanded ; it plays upon a fibro-cartilage interposed between it and the clavicular facet of the manubrium of the sternum, and its borders are rough for the attach- ment of the sterno-clavicular and interclavicular ligaments. The acromial, or outer end, presents a smooth articular facet, directed slightly downwards for the acromion ; its edges, especially the superior, are rough for the acromio-clavicular ligaments. The following muscles are attached to the clavicle:— Sterho-cleido-mastoid. Deltoid. Pectoralis major. Trapezius. Platysma myoides. Sterno-hyoid. Suhclavius. Sterno-thyroid (occasionally). Ligaments:— Interclavicular. Interarticular (acromio-clavicular). Interarticular (sternal). Conoid. Capsular (sterno-clavicular). Trapezoid. Rhomboid or costo-clavicular. Costo-coracoid membrane. Capsular (acromio-clavicular). Deep cervical fascia. Blood-supply.—The nutrient artery is a branch of the suprascapular ; it enters the bone on the under surface of the shaft near the middle of the subclavian groove. It is directed towards the acromial end. The acromial end of the clavicle receives numerous branches from the acromio-thoracic artery, and twigs from the arteries in the muscles attached to it. Ossification.—"the clavicle is ossified from two centres. The primary nucleus appears in the sixth week of embryonic life in the tissue immediately overlying the cartilaginous pre-coracoid bar (see p. 124). The clavicle begins as a membrane bone, but the ossification quickly extends into the underlying cartilage; it is therefore a dermal splint engrafted on cartilage. About the seventeenth year a secondary nucleus appears at the sternal end. Consolidation is complete by the twentieth year.120 THE SKELETON THE SCAPULA The scapula is a large flat bone, triangular in shape, situated on the posterior aspect of the thorax, and resting on the ribs from the second to the seventh. Of its two surfaces the anterior is deeply concave, forming the subscapular fossa, which • Fig. 123.—The Left Scapula. (Dorsal surface.) Coraeo-aeromial Peetoralis ligament minor Omo-hyoid and the transverse ligament is marked by several ridges commencing at the posterior border of the bone and passing transversely; these ridges divide this surface into several shallow grooves from which the subscapular muscle takes origin : the highest groove is the deepest. The outer third of this surface is smooth, and overlapped by the subscapiclar muscle : the superior and inferior angles are somewhat triangular, and connected by a narrow ridge of bone along the posterior border. This ridge and its terminal surfaces serve for the insertion of the serratus magnus. The posterior surface, or dorsum, is generally convex ; it is unequally dividedTHE SCAPULA 121 by a prominent lip of bone, the spine. The part above the spine is the supra- spinous fossa, a,ncl lodges the swpra-sijinatus muscle. The hollow below the spine is the infraspinous fossa; it is larger than the supraspinous fossa, and is limited inferiorly by a ridge which runs from the glenoid fossa backwards to join the \ posterior border a short distance above the inferior angle. To this oblique ridge the stout aponeurosis is attached which separates the teres major and teres minor muscles from the infra-spmatus muscle. The infraspinatus arises from the inner two-thirds of the infraspinous fossa, and overlaps the outer third. The supra- and infra-spinous fossae communicate with each other round the outer end of the spine ; this part corresponds to the neck of the scapula, and the groove is the scapular notch; it transmits the suprascapular nerve and artery from one fossa to the other. The surface of bone below the oblique ridge presents two, and occasion- ally three, facets for muscles: the long narrow outer one is for the origin of the teres minor; this is crossed near its middle by a groove for the dorsal artery of the scapula. The second facet is broader, and gives attachment to the teres major muscle. In bones from a muscular subject the third facet, quite at the inferior angle, is for a few fibres of the latissimus dorsi.122 THE SKELETON The spine commences at the posterior border of the scapula by a broad triangular surf ace ; it then crosses the dorsal surface obliquely to the glenoid fossa, becoming more prominent as it passes outwards till it reaches the neck of the scapula; from this point it forms the overhanging acromion process. The spine presents a superior surface which gives origin to the supra-sjpinatus muscle, and an inferior surface which affords origin to the infra-sinnatus muscle. It has a prominent crest, which is continuous posteriorly with the vertebral border, and, at its commencement, is smooth for a bursa between it and the tra^jezius. The crest is subcutaneous, and presents two lips—a superior for the insertion of the trapezius, and an inferior lip for the origin of the deltoid. The crest is continued into the acromion process. The acromion process forms the summit of the shoulder, and presents two surfaces, two borders, and a tip. The upper surface affords origin at its posterior part to a portion of the deltoid. The under surface is concave and smooth. Its inner border, a continuation of the superior lip of the crest^ receives the trapezius^ and presents near the tip a small articular facet for the outer end of the clavicle; the edges of the facet are rough for the acromio-clavicular ligaments. The outer border is continuous with the inferior lip of the crest, with which it forms an angle ; it gives origin to the deltoid. The tip of the acromion affords attachment to the coraco-acromial ligament. Of the three borders presented by the scapula, the external, or axillary, is the thickest, and extends from the posterior inferior angle to the lower margin of the glenoid cavity. Near its junction with the glenoid cavity there is a rough surface, from which the long head of the ti^iceps arises ; below this is the groove for the dorsal artery of the scapula. The suhscapularis muscle encroaches on this border from the anterior surface, and the teretes from the posterior aspect. The posterior, or vertebral, border, sometimes called the base, is the longest; it extends from the posterior superior to the posterior inferior angle. It is very narrow, but affords attachment to three muscles : namely, the levator angidi scapulce, above the spine ; the rhomboideus minor on a level with the spine ; and the rhomboideus major, through the intervention of a fibrous arch from the spine to the inferior angle. The superior border is the shortest and thinnest, ending externally in the cora- coid process. At the base of the coracoid is the suprascapular notch, to the edges of Avhich the transverse ligament is attached. Not infrequently the notch is replaced by a suprascapular foramen. This notch or foramen transmits the suprascapular nerve, and occasionally the suprascapular artery, but as a rule the artery passes over the ligament. From the adjacent borders of the notch and from the ligament, the omo-hyoid takes origin. The anterior angle of the scapula is formed by the glenoid cavity. This cavity is shallow and pyriform, with its major axis vertical; the lower end is the broader ; the upper end or apex gives origin to the long tendon of the biceps. The margins are raised, and afford attachment to the glenoid ligament. In the recent state, the cavity is covered with hyaline cartilage, and forms an articular fossa for the head of the humerus. The margin is somewhat defective where it is overarched by the acromion. The circumference is rough for the attachment of the capsular ligament. Beyond this is a narrow constricted portion, called the neck of the scapula. Projecting upwards from the neck is the coracoid process, a prominence of bone anterior to, but parallel with, the acromion. The tip of the coracoid gives origin to the sho7'-t tendon of the biceps, the coraco-brachialis muscle, and the costo^ coracoid ligament. The superior surface affords attachment to thepectoralis minor muscle, and to the coraco-clavicular ligaments (conoid and trapezoid). The outer border has attached to it the coraco-acromial ligament.THE SCAPULA 123 Muscles.—The following are attached to the scapula Supra-spinatus. Infra-spinatus. Subscapularis. Teres major. Teres minor. Omo-hyoid. Pectoralis minor. Serratus magnus. Deltoid. Ligaments :— Conoid. Trapezoid. Costo-coracoid membrane. Costo-coracoid ligament. Capsular (acromio-clavicular). Coraco-acromial.

Coraco-humeral. Gleno-humeral. Glenoid. Ehomboid loop. Spino-glenoid. Inferior transverse. Blood-supply.—The scapula is supplied by the following arteries :—Twigs from the subscapular artery and from the subscapular branch of the suprascapular enter the bone on the anterior surface. The dorsal artery of the scapula distributes branches in the infraspinous, whilst the suprascajpular artery supplies the supra- spinous fossa, the spine, the glenoid fossa, and sends branches into the infraspinous fossa. The acromion is supplied by branches of the acromio-thoracic artery. Fig. 125.—Ossification of the Scapula. The Scapula at the thu-d year, showing the coracoid element. (Anterior view.) The Scapula at birth. (Anterior view.) Ossification.—^The scapula is ossified from seven centres. Two may be con- sidered as primary, and the remainder as secondary nuclei. The centre for the body appears in a plate of cartilage near the neck of the scapula about the eighth week of intra-uterine life, and quickly forms a triangular plate of bone, from which the spine appears as a slight ridge about the middle of the third month. At birth the glenoid fossa and part of the scapular neck, the acromion, coracoid, and vertebral border are cartilaginous. During the first year a nucleus appears for the coracoid.THE SKELETON 124 and extends into the glenoid fossa, and along the upper border as far as the suprascapular notch. During the fifteenth year the coracoid is ankylosed to the scapula, and the secondary centres appear. Two nuclei are deposited in the acromial cartilage, and fuse to form the acromion, and join the spine at the twentieth year. This union of the acromion and spine may be fibrous, hence the acromion is often found separate in macerated specimens. The cartilage along the vertebral border ossifies from two centres : one in the middle, and one at the posterior inferior angle. A thin scale may occasionally be detected at the tip of the glenoid fossa. Morphology.—It is impossible to comprehend the significance of the scapular nuclei without considering briefly the morphology of the shoulder (pectoral) girdle. In its most generalised form the shoulder girdle consists of cartilage, which is disposed in three parts. Of these, a dorsal segment represents the scapula and a ventral bar, reaching to the sternum, represents the coracoid. The meeting place of the coracoid and scapula is the glenoid fossa. Anterior to the coracoid there is a third piece, more or less parallel with the coracoid, named the pre-coracoid. The human shoulder girdle is modified from the type form, mainly in the suppression of the pre-coracoid and, in part, of the coracoid. The suppression is brought about by the clavicle, which commences to ossify in the membrane overlying the pre-coracoid ; it then invades and replaces the cartilage. The scapular end of the coracoid ossifies and becomes the coracoid process of the scapula; the ventral end degenerates to form the costo-coracoid ligament, which lies in the free border of the membrane of that name. The dorsal cartilage ossifies and becomes the scapula ; the large tract of cartilage on the vertebral border of the young scapula represents the large suprascapular cartilage of batrachians. The suprascapular notch indicates the line of union of scapular and coracoid elements. In the embryo the notch is bridged over with cartilage, which may ossify or become ligament. THE HUMERUS The humerus is the longest bone of the upper limb. Its upper extremity presents a hemispherical surface covered with cartilage, and known as the head. The head articulates with the glenoid cavity of the scapula, and is directed upwards, inwards, and backwards. BeloAv the articular surface the bone is rough and con- stricted, constituting the anatomical neck. To the outer side of the head are two tuberosities, separated by the bicipital groove. The greater tuberosity is the higher and more posterior ; it is marked by three facets for muscles : an upper one for the supra-spinatus, a middle for the infra-spinatus, and an inferior for the teres minor. The lesser tuberosity is the more prominent; it serves for the insertion of the sub- scapular is. The furrow between the tuberosities lodges the long tendon of the biceps, extends downwards in the axis of the humeral shaft, and, gradually becoming shallower, ends near the junction of the upper and middle third of the shaft. The margins of this, the bicipital groove, are called lips, and afford attachment to muscles. The pectoralis major occupies the whole length of the outer lip. The inner lip receives, below, the teres major, and above, the latissimus dorsi; the tendon of the latter muscle is also attached to the floor of the groove. Between the tuberosities, the transverse humeral ligament converts the groove into a canal. In addition to the long tendon of the biceps and its tube of synovial125 THE HUME BUS membrane, the groove transmits a branch of the anterior circmnflex artery. The constriction immediately below the tuberosities is the surgical neck. The shaft is prismatic in its upper third, but flattened below. Three borders and three surfaces may be recognised. The anterior border commences at the Fig. 126.—The Left Humerus. (Anterior view.) Subscapularis Latissiimis dorsi Teres major Coraco-braehialis Supraspiiiatus BICIPITAL GROOVE Peetoralis major Deltoid greater tuberosity, as the anterior or outer lip of the bicipital groove, and, passing downwards, skirts the radial side of the coronoid fossa, to become continuous with the ridge separating the capitellum and trochlea. The radial or outer border extends from the posterior border of the greater tuberosity to the radial condyle.126 THE SKELETON This border is not well marked in the upper part of the shaft; near the middle it is interrupted by the musculo-spiral groove ; the lower half is termed the external condylar ridg^e, and affords attachment to the sicpinator longus and extensor carpi radialis longior muscles, and the external intermuscular septum.

This is the supracondyloid ridge;THE SKELETON 128 it is occasionally replaced by a prominent spine of bone, the supracondyloid! process (fig. 128), from which a band of fibrous tissue extends to the iilnai condyle, forming a ring, transmitting the median nerve and the brachial artery The nerve is not always accompanied by the artery; in some instances of highi division of the brachial the foramen transmits the interosseous artery.

The posterior surface lies between the ulnar and radial borders. It is obliquely divided by the musculo-spiral groove. The surface above the groove serves for the origin of the external head the part below for the internal head of the triceps.THE HUMERUS 129 The lower extremity of the humerus is flattened, and presents from the ulnar to the radial side the following parts :—a prominent process, the ulnar (internal) condyle, from which the pronator radii teres arises, and to the lower part of which the internal lateral ligament is attached. From this ligament the flexor carpi radialis, palmaris longus, flexor suhlimis digitorum, and flexor carpi ulnaris muscles arise. Posteriorly the condyle forms with the trochlea a groove traversed by the ulnar nerve. External to the condyle there is the inferior articular surface, subdivided by a low ridge into the trochlea and the capitellum. The trochlea is, in shape, like the section of a pulley wheel; the ulnar extends much lower than the radial edge ; the articular surface is sharply indicated anteriorly and posteriorly. The trochlea fits into the greater sigmoid cavity of the ulna. Above the trochlea on the anterior surface is the rounded coronoid fossa, which receives the coronoid process of the ulna when the forearm is flexed. On the posterior aspect there is the olecranon fossa, for the reception of the anterior edge of the olecranon in extension of the forearm. These fossse in most humeri are separated by a thin translucent disc of bone, sometimes merely by fibrous tissue, so that in macerated bones a perforation, the supratrochlear foramen, exists. The radial head or capitellum is received by the depression on the summit of the radius ; it is limited to the anterior and lower surface of the humerus. Above, it terminates in a shallow fossa, which receives the edge of the radius in flexion. The ridge between the trochlea and the capitellum corresponds to the interval between the ulna and radius; the shallow groove on the outer side of the ridge receives the inner margin of the head of the radius. External to the capitellum is the external or radial condyle. It is less prominent than the ulnar condyle, and gives attachment to the external lateral ligament of the elbow, and to a tendon frpm which five extensor muscles arise—viz. extensores oarpi radialis brevior, digitorum communis, minimi digiti, carpi ulnaris, and the stqnnator brevis. On the posterior aspect this condyle extends to the edge of the trochlea, and gives origin to the anconeus. Muscles.—The humerus affords attachment for the following muscles :— Supraspinatus. Flexor carpi radialis. Infraspinatus. Palmaris longus. Teres major. Flexor sublimis digitorum. Teres minor. Flexor carpi ulnaris. Subscapularis. • Supinator longus. Deltoid. Extensor carpi radialis longior. Pectoralis major. Extensor carpi radialis brevior. Coraco-brachialis. Extensor digitorum communis. Latissimus dorsi. Extensor minimi digiti. Biceps (occasionally). Extensor carpi ulnaris. Brachialis anticus. Supinator brevis. Triceps. Anconeus. Pronator radii teres. Ligaments.—To the upper extremity of the humerus the following ligaments are attached :— Capsular. Gleno-humeral. Coraco-humeral. Transverse humeral. To the lower extremity :— Internal lateral ligament ] External lateral ligament Anterior ligament Posterior ligament of the elbow joint. K130 THE SKELETON Arteries.—The blood-supply of the humerus is derived from the suprascapular, and the anterior and posterior circumflex arteries. Branches from these arteries enter the foramina which cluster around the circumference of the head and tuberosities. At the top of the bicipital groove there is a large nutrient foramen, which transmits a branch from the anterior circumflex artery. The nutrient artery of the shaft is derived from a muscular branch of the brachial; it enters the bone near the middle of the inner border immediately beloAV the insertion of the coraco-brachialis, and is directed to the distal end. The lower extremity is nourished by numerous twigs derived from the anastomotic, the superior and inferior profunda, and the recurrent branches of the radial, ulnar, and interosseous arteries. Ossification.—The humerus ossifies from one primary and six secondary nuclei. The centre for the shaft appears about the eighth week of intra-uterine life, and extends very rapidly. At birth the bone presents two cartilaginous extremities, which ossify in the following manner :—A nucleus for the head appears early in the first year ; it is not infrequently present at birth (Spencer). The nucleus for the greater tuberosity appears in the third year. In the fifth year a centre may be deposited for the lesser tuberosity, but this is not constant. The three nuclei coalesce to form a disc of bone, which unites with the shaft about the twentieth year. The inferior extremity ossifies from four centres : the centre for the capitellum Fig. 130.—The Head of the Humerus at the Sixth Year. (In section.) THE CENTRE FOR THE HEAD APPEARS DURING appears in the third year, and those for the inner (ulnar) condyle, the trochlea^ and external (radial) condyle at the fifth, tenth, and fourteenth year respectively. The nuclei for the capitellum, trochlea, and radial condyle coalesce before uniting with the shaft, which they do in the seventeenth year. The ulnar condyle joins the shaft somewhat later. A study of the upper end of the humeral shaft before its union with the epiphysis is of interest in relation to what is known as the neck of the humerus. The term neck is applied to three parts of this bone. The anatomical neck is the constriction to which the capsular ligament is attached. This is accurately indicated by the constriction which lies internal to the tuberosities ; the upper extremity of the humeral shaft before its union with the epiphysis terminates in a low three-sided pyramid, the surfaces of which are separated from each other by ridges. The inner of these three surfaces underlies the head of the bone, and the two outer surfaces underlie the tuberosities. The axis of the inner, isolated portion forms with the shaft an angle of 130° ; it constitutes the morphological neck of the humerus, and is of the same nature as the neck of the femur. The surgical neck is an indefinite area below the tuberosities where the bone is liable to fracture. THE FIRST year: IT IS SOMETIMES PRESENT^- AT BIRTH THE CENTRE FOR THE GREATER TUBEROSITY — APPEARS IN THE THIRD YEARTHE ULNA 131 THE ULNA The ulna is the inner bone of the forearm : it hes parallel with, but is longer than, the radius. The upper extremity is the thickest and strongest part of the ulna, and is of irregular shape. The superior articular surface is called the :greater sig^moid cavity, and receives the trochlea of the humerus ; it is transversely iconstricted near its middle. The prominence above the constriction is termed the olecranon, the part below the coronoid process. The olecranon process is the highest part of the ulna ; to its upper surface the itriceps is inserted, and the anterior margin of this surface affords attachment to Fig. 131.—Upper End of Left Ulna.

The anterior surface of the olecranon is articular, and forms the upper and back part of the greater sigmoid cavity, and its margins give attachment to ligaments. The posterior surface of this process is triangular, and separated from the skin merely by a bursa. On the inner side there is a tubercle for the origin of the flexor carpi ulnaris ; and below this a fasciculus of the internal lateral ligament of the elbow is inserted. The coronoid process forms the lower lip of the greater sigmoid cavity: its upper surface is articular and forms nearly a right angle with the olecranon portion. The anterior edge of the coronoid process is sometimes called the apex. The inferior aspect is rough for the insertion of the brachialis anticus muscle, and the lower outer angle has a tubercle to which the oblique ligament is attached. The inner edge has a smooth tubercle from which the flexor suhlimis digitorum arises ; the ridge of bone immediately beloAV this tubercle gives origin to the lesser K 2132 THE SKELETON head of the ptonator radii teres, and below this again the rounded accessor] bundle of the flexor longus pollicis arises.

The posterior border extends from the tubercle, near the tip of the olecranon, to the back part of the styloid process. The upper three-fourths gives attachment to134 THE SKELETON an aponeurosis, from which flexor and extensor carpi ulnaris and the flexor \ ■profundus digitoriim muscles arise. Of the three surfaces, the anterior hes between the anterior and interosseous borders ; it is concave for the greater part of its extent. The upper three-fourths gives origin to the flexor profundus digitormn, the lower fourth to iYiQ pronator quadratics ; the upper limit of the surface for the pronator is sometimes indicated by a transverse ridge. The internal surface is bounded by the anterior and posterior borders. The upper three-fourths is occupied by the flexor profundus digitorum the remainder is subcutaneous. The posterior surface lies between the interosseous and posterior borders. Its upper fourth is marked off by an oblique ridge running from the lesser sigmoid cavity to the posterior border. The surface above the line receives the insertion of the anconeus ; from the line itself a few fibres of supinator brevis arise. The surface below the oblique line is subdivided by a vertical ridge the portion lying between this ridge and the posterior border is in relation with the extensor carpi ulnaris. Between this line and the interosseous border the: following muscles arise in order from above downwards : extensor-ossis metacarpi poinds, the extensor secundi internodii poUicis, and the extensor indicis. The lower extremity of the ulna is of small size and consists of two parts, a head and styloid process, separated from each other, on the under surface, by a groove into which an interarticular cartilage is inserted. That part of the head adjacent to the groove is semilunar in shape and plays upon the interarticular cartilage which excludes it from the wrist-joint. The margin of the head is also semilunar, and is received into the sigmoid cavity of the radius. The styloid process projects from the inner and back part of the bone, and appears as a continuation of the posterior border. To its extremity the internal lateral ligament is attached, and its posterior surface is grooved for the passage of the tendon of the extensor carpi ulnaris. Muscles.—The following are attached to the ulna : — Triceps. Anconeus. Brachialis anticus. Pronator quadratus. Flexor sublimis digitorum. Flexor profundus digitorum. Flexor longus poUicis. Ligaments :— Internal lateral of elbow. Anterior of elbow. Posterior of elbow. Orbicular. Oblique. Flexor carpi ulnaris. Extensor ossis metacarpi pollicis. Extensor secundi internodii pollicis. Extensor indicis. Pronator radii teres. Supinator brevis. Extensor carpi ulnaris. Interosseous membrane. Anterior radio-ulnar. Posterior radio-ulnar. Internal lateral of wrist-joint. Interarticular fibro-cartilage. Blood-supply.—The nutrient vessel enters the shaft near the middle of the anterior surface ; it is derived from the anterior interosseous trunk, and is directed towards the proximal end. The upper extremity receives branches from the anterior and posterior ulnar recurrent and from the interosseous recurrent. The lower end receives twigs from the anterior and posterior interosseous arteries. Ossification.—The ulna is ossified from three centres. The primary nucleus appears near the middle of the shaft in the eighth week of embryonic life. At birth the greater portion of the olecranon process is cartilaginous. During the fourth year a nucleus appears for the distal epiphysis. The cartilaginous olecranon is mainly ossified from the shaft, and in the course of the tenth year a scale-like epiphysis appears at its summit. This unites during the sixteenth year. The distal epiphysis consolidates about the eighteenth year.135 THE BADIUS j THE RADIUS The radius is shorter than the ulna and hes parallel with it. The upper end, l)r head, is surmounted by a circular disc, of which the superior surface is depressed l;or the reception of the capitellum of the humerus, especially in flexion of the ■orearm. The margin of the head is also articular; it is deeper on the ulnar jispect, where it is received by the lesser sigmoid cavity of the ulna; the rest of I: Fig. 134.—Articular Facets on the Lower End of Left Kadius and Ulna. [ Posterior RADIUS ULNA I [ STYLOID PROCESS OF ULNA HEAD OF ULNA: IT ARTICULATES WITH THE INTERARTICULAR FIBRO-CARTILAGE OF THE WRIST JOINT Anterior the circumference is embraced by the orbicular ligament. Below the cartilage- covered surface of the bone there is a constricted portion, or neck, which is in relation by its outer side w^ith the suijinator brevis. Beneath the neck, on the anterior aspect of the bone, there is an oval eminence, the bicipital tuberosity, divided longitudinally into a rough posterior portion for the biceps tendon, and a smooth anterior surface in relation with the bursa which is situated between the tendon and the tuberosity.

Of the three borders the interosseous is the best marked. Commencing at the posterior edge of the bicipital tuberosity, it extends as a sharp ridge until it approaches the distal extremity of the bone; it then divides to become continuous with the anterior and posterior margins of the sigmoid cavity. It affords attachment to the interosseous mem- brane. The anterior border starts from the bicipital tuberosity, crosses obliquelyTHE SKELETON 13G to the outer side of the bone, and descends to the anterior border of the styloid process. The upper third of this border is called the oblique line, and limits the insertion of the siqnnator brcvis and the origin of the flexor longus 2)ollicis, and affords attachment to the flexor suhlimis digitorum. The posterior border, com- mencing at the back of the neck of the radius, is very indistinct at first, but becomes more marked near the middle of the bone ; it terminates at the back part of the styloid process. The anterior surface is bounded by the anterior and interosseous borders. The upper two-thirds is occupied by the flexor longus i^ollicis, and a little less than the lower third by the i:)ronator quadrahis. The external surface lies between the anterior and posterior borders. The upper third affords insertion to the suijinator hrevis ; at its centre there is a rough, low, vertical ridge for the pronator radii teres ; below this, the bone is smooth and overlapped by the tendons of the extensores carpi radialis longior and brevior, and crossed by the extensor ossis metacarpi p)ollicis and extensor yrimi internodii pollicis. The posterior surface lies between the interosseous and posterior borders. The upper third is covered by the supinator hrevis ; the middle third gives origin to the extensor ossis metacarpi and extensor primi internodii pollicis ; and the lower third is covered by tendons. The lower extremity of the radius is quadrilateral; its carpal surface is articular and divided by a ridge into an inner quadrilateral portion, concave for articulation with the semilunar bone ; and an outer triangular portion, extending on to the Fig. 136.—Ossification of the Eadius and Ulna. -APPEARS AT THE TENTH YEAR; FUSES AT THE SIXTEENTH YEAR APPEARS AT THE FIFTH YEAR; FUSES AT THE SEVENTEENTH YEAR APPEARS AT THE FOURTH YEAR; FUSES AT THE EIGHTEENTH YEAR APPEARS AT THE SECOND YEAR ; FUSES AT THE' TWENTIETH YEARTHE BADIUS 137 styloid process : this is concave to receive the superior surface of the scaphoid bone. The inner side of the lower end presents the sigmoid cavity for the recep- tion of the rounded margin of the head of the ulna. The anterior surface is a raised ridge to which the anterior ligament of the wrist-joint is attached. The outer surface is represented by the styloid process ; to its base the supinator longus is inserted, and the tip serves for the attachment of the external lateral ligament of the wrist. It is also marked by a shallow furrow for the tendons of the extensor ossis metacarin and extensor iwimi internocUi ijollicis. The posterior surface is convex, and marked by two prominent ridges separating three furrows. The posterior annular ligament is attached to these ridges, to the styloid process, and to the inner margin, thus forming with the bone a series of tunnels. The outermost is broad, shallow, and frequently subdivided by a low ridge. The outer subdivision is for the extensor carin raclialis longior, the inner for the extensor carpi radialis hrevior. The middle groove is narrow and deep for the tendon of the extensor secundi internodii pollicis. The innermost is shallow and transmits the extensor indicis and the extensor communis digitoru7n which, overlies the indicis. When the radius and ulna are articulated, an additional groove is formed for the extensor minimi digiti. Muscles.—The following muscles are attached to the radius :— Biceps. Pronator quadratus. Supinator brevis. Extensor ossis metacarpi pollicis. Supinator longus. Extensor primi internodii polhcis. Pronator radii teres. Flexor longus pollicis. Flexor sublimis digitorum. Ligaments:— Oblique ligament. Posterior annular. Interosseous membrane. External lateral of wrist. Anterior radio-ulnar. Interarticular fibro-cartilage of wrist. Posterior radio-ulnar. Anterior radio-carpal. Posterior radio-carpal. Blood-supply.—The nutrient artery is derived from the anterior interosseous trunk ; it enters the shaft near the middle of the anterior surface, and runs towards the proximal end of the bone. The head of the bone is supplied by the radial recur- rent and interosseous recurrent arteries. The lower end is supplied by the anterior and posterior interosseous arteries and numerous twigs from the carpal arches. Ossification.—The radius is ossified by one primary and two secondary centres. The shaft begins to ossify at the eighth week of embryonic life. The nucleus for the lower end appears in the second year, whilst that for the upper end is deposited in the fifth year. The head ankyloses with the shaft at the seventeenth year, but consolidation is delayed at the lower end until the twentieth year. THE HAND The skeleton of the hand consists of three parts—the carpus, metacarpus, and phalanges. THE CARPUS The carpus contains eight bones, arranged in two rows, four bones in each ! row. Enumerated from the radial to the ulnar side, the bones of the proximal row i are, the scaphoid, semilunar, cuneiform, and pisiform ; those of the distal row, the ' trapezium, trapezoid, magnum, and unciform.THE SKELETON The Scaphoid This is the largest bone of the proximal row. Its superior surface is some- what triangular and convex for articulation with the lower end and styloid process of the radius. Its inferior surface has tw^o facets : a large one for the trapezium, and a small one for the trapezoid. The dorsal surface is occupied by a long, deep groove for ligaments. The palmar surface is rough and concave above; below, Fig. 137.—The Left Hand. (Dorsal surface.) SEMILUNAR it has a prominent tuberosity for the attachment of the anterior annular ligament and the ahchictor i)ollicis muscle. The outer (radial) surface is rough for liga- ments. The inner (ulnar) surface is occupied by two articular facets, of which the upper one is crescentic in shape for the semilunar bone, whilst the lower is deeply concave for the reception of the head of the magnum. Articulations.—With radius, trapezium, trapezoid, magnum, and semilunar.THE CARPUS 139 The Semilunar 1^1 The semilunar has a convex superior surface for articulation with the lower XtiH end of the radius and the fibro-cartilage of the wrist. Its inferior surface is deeply concave for the head of the magnum. The ulnar ridge of the inferior articular surface, is faceted for the unciform. The outer (radial) surface has a narrow semilunar facet for the scaphoid, whilst the inner (ulnar) aspect of the bone Fig. 138.—The Left Hand. (Palmar sm-face.)

The palmar and dorsal surfaces are rough and non-articular. Of these, the palmar is usually the more extensive ; in the remaining carpal bones the dorsal surface is the broader. Articulations.—With the radius, scaphoid, cuneiform, magnum, and unciform.140 THE SKELETON The Cuneifoem The cuneiform (or pyramidal bone) rests by its base on the ulnar side of the semilunar ; its apex is directed downwards and to the ulnar side, and serves for : the attachment of the internal lateral ligament of the wrist. The base presents ja ; Fig. 139.—The Left Scaphoid. facet for the semilunar. The inferior surface has a sinuous articular surface for the unciform bone. The superior surface has a convex smooth portion, where it plays upon the interarticular cartilage which intervenes between it and the lower Fig. 141.—The Left Cuneiform. Fig. 142.—The Left Pisiform. FOR CUNEIFORM end of the ulna; the remainder of this surface is rough for ligaments. The palmar surface has a conspicuous facet for the pisiform bone, and the dorsal surface is rough for ligaments. Articulations.—Pisiform, semilunar, and unciform. The Pisipoem : The pisiform resembles closely a split pea. Its dorsal aspect, corresponding to I the cut surface of the pea, articulates with the facet on the palmar surface of the i cuneiform. The rest of this bone is rough for the anterior annular ligament and the tendon of the flexor car pi ulnaris.141 THE CABPUS The Trapezium The trapezium is the first bone of the distal row ; it is very irregular in shape. The inferior surface is saddle-shaped, and articulates with the base of the first metacarpal bone. The superior surface has a facet for the scaphoid. The inner (ulnar) surface has two facets ; the lower and smaller is for the base of the second metacarpal, the upper and larger for the trapezoid. The radial and Fig. 143.—The Left Trapezium. the ridge groove for flexor carpi radialis for first metacarpal dorsal surfaces are rough for ligaments. The palmar surface presents a prominent ridge, which has to its ulnar side a deep groove which transmits the tendon of the flexor carpi radialis. To the ridge of the trapezium the anterior annular ligament Fig. 144.—The Left Trapezoid. palmar surface for trapezium for second metacarpal FOR SCAPHOID - FOR TRAPEZOID " FOR SECOND METACARPAL is attached. The palmar surface affords attachment to the abductor, flexor ossis, flexor brevis, and sometimes a portion of the extensor ossis metacarjjl j^ollicis. Articulations.—With the scaphoid, trapezoid, and the first and second meta- carpal bones. The Trapezoid The trapezoid is also very irregular in shape, and much smaller than the trapezium. It has a broad dorsal surface; the narrow palmar surface gives origin to a few fibres of the inner head of the flexor brevis pollicis. The portion Fig. 145.^—The Left Magnum. FOR SEMILUNAR- FOR SCAPHOID THE RADIAL OR OUTER SIDE FOR TRAPEZOID FOR SECOND METACARPAL FOR THIRD METACARPAL FOR SEMILUNAR FOR UNCIFORM THE ULNAR OR INNER SIDE FOR FOURTH METACARPAL of bone between these surfaces is constricted and mapped out into articular facets; of these, the inferior is most conspicuous ; it is saddle-shaped for the base of the second metacarpal. The radial surface has a facet for the trapezium ; the ulnar surface is articular for the magnum ; and the superior surface has a facet for the scaphoid. Articulations.—With the trapezium, magnum, scaphoid, second metacarpal.142 THE SKELETON The Magnum The magnum is the largest carpal bone, and occupies the centre of the wrist, The superior surface is globular, and sometimes called the head. It is received into the cup formed by the semilunar and scaphoid. The articular surface of the head extends some distance on to the dorsal aspect of the bone. The inferior surface has three facets. The middle is the largest for the base of the third meta- carpal. The ulnar facet is for the fourth, and the small radial facet is for the second metacarpal. The outer (radial) surface articulates with the trapezoid, and presents above this small facet a deep groove for an interosseous ligament. The inner (ulnar) surface of the bone has a long articular surface for the unciform (sometimes the lower part of this surface forms a detached facet), but is rough near its anterior part for ligaments. The palmar surface is convex and rough, and affords origin to the inner head of \hQ flexor brevis poUicis. The rough dorsal i surface is broad, and has a deep concavity, which serves to make the head of the; bone more prominent, and gives rise to the appearance of a neck. Articulations.—Trapezoid, unciform, semilunar, scaphoid, and second, third, and fourth metacarpals. ■ . The Uncifoem The unciform is the most readily recognised of all the carpals, as its palmar^T surface presents a prominent hook-like process; this, the unciform process, has its concavity directed towards the radial side, and forms part of the inner boundary of the passage for the flexor tendons ; to the apex of the process the anterior annular ligament gains an attachment. It also affords origin to the flexor brevis minimi and opponens minimi digiti muscles. The dorsal surface is rough for ligaments. Fig. 146.—The Left Unciform. The inferior surface has two facets "for the bases of fourth and fifth metacarpals. The superior surface forms the apex of a wedge, and is smooth and rounded for articulating with a narrow facet on the ulnar side of the semilunar. The ulnar surface is mainly articular for the cuneiform, whilst the radial surface is faceted for the magnum. Articulations.—With the cuneiform, semilunar, magnum, and the fourth and fifth metacarpals. The central is an occasional element of the carpus. It is situated on the dorsal aspect of the carpus, between the scaphoid, magnum, and trapezoid. This bone is a normal element of the carpus in many mammals, even in the orang and gibbon. It is represented in the carpus of the human embryo, but in most individuals it undergoes suppression or coalesces with the scaphoid. Blood-supply.—The arterial twigs to the carpal bones are derived from the anterior and posterior carpal branches of the radial and ulnar arteries. A large branch from the anterior interosseous is also distributed to the carpus, and twigs are furnished to it from the posterior interosseous artery. Ossification.—At birth the carpal elements are cartilaginous, and the nucleus for each bone appears in the following order :—143 THE METACARPUS Magnum, first year. Trapezium, fifth year. Scaphoid, sixth year. Trapezoid, eighth year. Pisiform, twelfth year. Unciform, second year. Cuneiform, third year. Semilunar, fourth year. THE METACAEPUS The metacarpus consists of five bones. Each metacarpal bone has a shaft, a rounded distal end termed the head, and a square-shaped proximal extremity ramed the base. The shaft is prismatic ; two surfaces of the prism are lateral, and he third dorsal. The lateral surfaces afford attachment to the interosseous muscles : on the palmar aspect of the shaft these surfaces approach each other, and for some distance are only separated by a prominent ridge. The dorsal surface is smooth and covered in the recent state by the tendons of the extensor muscles of the fingers. Near the base this surface is divided by a median ridge; as this [ridge passes to the distal end of the shaft, it divides and forms two ridges which terminate in a prominent tubercle on each side of the head of the bone. The smooth surface on each side of the median ridge on the dorsal aspect, near the base, is for a dorsal interosseous muscle. The base is quadrilateral; its palmar and dorsal surfaces are rough for ligaments ; the upper end articulates with the carpus, and its lateral aspects have facets for adjacent metacarpals. The head i has a semilunar articular surface for the base of the first phalanx, and is more extensive on the palmar than the dorsal aspect. On its palmar surface the head is grooved for flexor tendons, each corner of the groove being surmounted by a tubercle. The sides of the head are compressed, and each side is occupied by a well-marked fossa. The several metacarpals present distinctive characters. The fiest is the most peculiar; it is the shortest, and its shaft resembles that of a phalanx. It has a concave palmar surface, and the dorsal surface lacks the bifurcated ridge. The base has a saddle-shaped articular surface for the trapezium, and at its outer (radial) corner presents a tubercle for the insertion of the extensor ossis metacarin ijollicis. The head of the bone presents on its palmar aspect two shallow grooves for the sesamoids in the flexor brevis imllicis. Muscles:— Extensor ossis metacarpi poUicis. First dorsal interosseous. Opponens pollicis. Interosseus primus volaris. Blood-supply.—The nutrient vessel is derived from the princeps pollicis artery : it enters on the ulnar side, and is directed towards the head of the bone. Fig. 147.—The First (Left) Metacarpal. RADIAL SIDE ULNAR SIDETHE SKELETON 141 The Second Metacarpal is the longest, and is easily recognised by its large irregular base. The dorsal surface affords attachment to the tendon of the extensor carpi raclialis longior and a part of the extensor carpi radialis brevior; to the palmar Fig. 148.—^The Second (Left) METAeARPAL. RADIAL SIDE FOR TRAPEZIUM ULNAR SIDE FOR THIRD METACARPAL — FOR MAGNUM surface the tendon of the flexor carpi radialis is inserted. The remaining surfaces present four articular facets. The end of the bone is occupied by a deep groove for the trapezoid ; the ulnar ridge of this concavity is smooth for the magnum, and is directly continuous with a long narrow facet for the third metacarpal. The radial surface of the base has a small, somewhat quadrangular facet for the trapezium.145 THE METACABPUS Muscles:— Flexor carpi radialis. First and second dorsal interosseous. Extensor carpi radialis longior. First palmar interosseous. Extensor carpi radialis brevior. Flexor brevis pollicis. Blood-supply.—The nutrient artery is derived from the first palmar inter- osseous. It enters on the ulnar side, and is directed towards the proximal end or jbase of the bone. [ The Thied Metacarpal is easily recognised by the prominent styloid process which projects from the radial corner of the dorsal surface of the base. A little below this process the extensor carjpi radialis brevior finds insertion. The carpal jsurface of the base is nearly plane for the magnum. The radial surface has a long 'narrow facet for the second metacarpal. On the ulnar side, two rounded facets are usually seen for the fourth metacarpal. Not infrequently one of them is absent. I Muscles:— ' Extensor carpi radialis brevior. Second and third dorsal interosseous. Adductor pollicis. Fig. 150.—The Fourth (Left) Metacarpal. FOR THI ULNAR SIDE FOR FIFTH METACARPAL Blood-supply.—The nutrient artery is derived from the interosseous : it enters, as a rule, on the radial side, and is directed towards the base. The Fourth Metacarpal has a very small base. By its carpal surface it arti- culates with the unciform. The radial surface has two rounded facets for the third metacarpal; there is a small facet for the magnum at the posterior radial corner. The ulnar side has a narrow articular surface for the fifth metacarpal. Muscles :— The third dorsal interosseous. The fourth dorsal interosseous. The third palmar interosseous. Blood-supply.—The nutrient artery is furnished by the second interosseous ; it enters on the radial side of the shaft, and is directed towards the proximal end. The Fifth Metacarpal is readily distinguished. The carpal facet is convex for the unciform. The ulnar aspect of the base forms a rounded tubercle for the extensor carjn ulnaris, whilst the radial side has a semilunar facet for the fourth L146 THE SKELETON metacarpal bone. The radial border of the dorsal surface of the shaft often has a promment lip for the fourth dorsal interosseous muscle. Muscles:— Flexor carpi ulnaris. Fourth dorsal interosseous. Extensor carpi ulnaris. Third palmar interosseous. Opponens minimi digiti. Blood-supply.—The nutrient artery is derived from the third interosseous. It enters the shaft on the radial side, and is directed towards the proximal end. Ossification.—Each metacarpal is ossified from two centres. The nucleus for the shaft appears about the eighth week of embryonic life. At birth the shafts are Fig. 151.—The Fifth (Left) Metacarpal. ^ FOUl ULNAR SIDE well ossified, but each end is capped by a piece of cartilage. In the case of the first metacarpal, a centre for the epiphysis appears at the proximal end in the course of the third year. The bases of the remaining metacarpals are ossified from the shaft, but an epiphysis forms for the head of each bone in the third year The bones are usually consolidated by the twentieth year. In many cases the first metacarpal has t^vo epiphyses, one at the base and an additional one at the head ; the latter is never so large as in the other metacarpal bones. The third metacarpal occasionally has an additional nucleus for the prominent styloid process which constitutes such a distinguishing feature of this bone. The styloid process sometimes remains distinct, and is then known as the styloid "bone. Occasionally it fuses with the trapezoid or magnum. THE PHALANGES The phalanges are the bones of the fingers. They number in all fourteen : the thumb has two, the other fingers three each. Each phalanx has a shaft, which is broad and slightly concave on the palmar, rounded and smooth on the dorsal aspect. The sides of the palmar surface are raised where they give attachment to the sheaths of the flexor tendons. The bases of the phalanges of the first row present glenoid fossae which play upon the convex heads of the metacarpals. Their distal ends are surmounted by miniature condyles.THE PHALANGES 147 Fig. 152.—The Phalanges of the Third Digit of the Hand. (Dorsal view.) THIRD TERMINAL OR UNGUAL PHALANX SECOND PHALANX148 THE SKELETON The phalanges of the second row are shorter than those of the first row Then- bases present two shallow pits, separated by a ridge. The terminal, third, or ungual phalanges have an expanded shaft for th support of the nail. The bases are identical in shape with those of the second rcw Ossification.—Each phalanx ossifies from two centres : one for the shaft which is deposited between the eighth and tenth week ; and a nucleus for th epiphysis at the proximal end, which appears betw^een the third and fifth years Consolidation begins at the seventeenth, and is complete by the eighteenth year. The ossification of the terminal phalanx is peculiar. Like the other phalange it has a nucleus for the shaft and a secondary nucleus for the epiphysis ; but tb centre for the shaft appears at the tip of the phalanx ; whereas in the othe phalanges the earthy matter is deposited in the middle of the shaft. THE HIP-BONE The hip-bone (innominate bone) is of irregular shape, resembling someivhat th blade of a screw propeller. It consists of three parts, which, though separate ii early life, are, in the adult, firmly ankylosed. The three parts meet together a the cotyloid cavity or acetabulum. They are named ilium, ischium, and pubes. The ilium is the upper expanded portion ; it articulates with the sacrum, an( forms the upper two-fifths of the acetabulum. The ischium is the lowest part of th bone ; it forms the posterior and inferior two-fifths of the acetabulum, and assist the pubes to form the obturator foramen. The pubes forms the anterior one-fift of the acetabulum, completes the obturator foramen, and stretches towards th median line to meet with the opposite pubes to form a symphysis. Each par requires separate consideration. The ilium has two surfaces : the external surface, or dorsum, is convex in it, general contour. It is limited superiorly by the semicircular crest, and is crossec by the three gluteal ridges. The superior gluteal ridge commences at the cres about 5 cm. (2'^) from its posterior termination, and passes downwards to th middle of the greater sciatic (ilio-sciatic) notch. The space included between thi ridge and the crest gives origin to the gluteus maximus, and at its lower part to a h^v fibres of iYiQinjiiformis. The middle gluteal ridge extends from the crest 2*5 cm. (1" behind its anterior extremity, and passes across the dorsum to terminate near th(, posterior end of the superior gluteal ridge, at the greater sciatic notch. The surface^ of bone between this ridge and the crest is for the origin of the gluteus medius. Th(, inferior gluteal ridge begins in the notch separating the anterior iliac spines, anc terminates posteriorly in the middle of the greater sciatic notch. The space betweei the middle and inferior ridges gives origin to the gluteus minimus, except a smal j area adjacent to the anterior superior iliac spine for the tensor vagince femoris- The bone between the inferior gluteal ridge and the margin of the acetabulun affords attachment to the capsule of the hip-joint. Towards its anterior part then, is a rough surface for the reflected tendon of the rectus. The internal surface of the ilium consists of an anterior concave portion, termeCj the iliac fossa; it lodges the iliacus muscle. The fossa is limited below by th(j ilio-jjectmeal line ; this line receives, at its anterior part, the insertion of the psoai] parvus. A small portion of the ilium extends below the ilio-pectineal line to meet the ischium. The surface posterior to the fossa is divided into an auricular surfacei for articulation with the lateral aspect of the upper portion of the sacrum, and si superior rough surface—the tuberosity—for the posterior sacro-iliac and ilio-lumbai149 THE HIP-BONE gaments. The crest extends from the anterior superior ihac to the posterior I'lperior ihac spine. It is thickest at its extremities. The prominent edges, or 'ps, are for the attachment of muscles and fasciae. The outer hp affords attachment to the gkiteal portion of the fascia lata. The eternal oblique is inserted into the anterior, and the latissimus dorsi arises from 16 posterior half of this lip of the crest. The anterior two-thirds of the inter- lediate space gives origin to the internal oblique. The inner lip, by its anterior u'ee-fourths, gives attachment to the transversalis ; behind this is a small surface )r the quadratus lumbormn, and the remainder is occupied by the erector siyincB. 'he extreme inner margin of the lip serves for the attachment of the iliac fascia. The anterior border of the ilium extends from the anterior su|)erior spine to lie margin of the acetabulum. The anterior superior spine gives attachment to 'onpart's ligament, and the sartorius which also arises from the upper half of the uperior iliac notch. This notch is terminated inferiorly by the anterior inferior jpine: it is smaller, less prominent than the superior, and gives origin to the 'traight head of the rectus femoris and the main limb of the ilio-femoral band of he capsule of the hip-joint. Beneath the inferior iliac spine is the inferior iliac lotch ; it is broad, but shallow, and limited by an eminence, the ilio-pubal ridge, • yhich indicates the line of ankylosis of the pubes and the ilium. A few fibres of the liacus arise from this notch. I The posterior border of the ilium presents above the posterior superior spine, ivliich gives attachment to the greater sacro-sciatic ligament and the miiUifidus 'jjincB, and a portion of the oblique sacro-iliac ligament. Below this is a shallow ■lotch terminating below in the posterior inferior spine, corresponding to the pos- terior border of the auricular surface. This spine receives a portion of the greater sacro-sciatic ligament. Below the spine the posterior border of the ilium forms ilie upper segment of the greater sciatic notch. The ischium consists of a thick solid body, a prominent tuberosity, and a ramus. The body is triangular ; its outer surface forms the posterior and inferior section ,)f the acetabulum. The inner surface forms part of the true pelvis, and meets the [lium a little distance below the ilio-pectineal line. It also forms the floor, or Jion-articular portion, of the acetabulum, and meets the pubes anteriorly ; the line bf junction is frequently indicated in adult bones by a rough line extending from jhe ilio-pubal ridge to the margin of the obturator foramen. The free border of jhis surface forms the posterior boundary of the obturator foramen. The inner surface of the ischium gives origin to the obturator internus. The posterior surface pf the ischium lies between the posterior rim of the acetabulum and the greater sciatic notch. Inferiorly this surface is limited by the obturator groove, which receives the posterior fleshy border of the obturator externus when the thigh is flexed. The capsule of the hip-joint is attached to the outer part of the posterior [surface. The pyriformis, the greater and lesser sciatic nerves, the sciatic artery, 'and the nerve to the qiiadratus femoris, cross it. The inner border assists the ilium to complete the greater sciatic notch, which is terminated inferiorly by the prominent ischiatic spine, which gives attachment to the lesser sacro-sciatic ligament, the levator ani, and coccygeus. From the base of the spine, posteriorly, |the gemellus suijerior arises ; and the internal pudic vessels and nerve, with the juerve to the obturator internus, cross it. The recess below the ischiatic spine is !the lesser sciatic notch; in the recent state it is covered with cartilage, and 'presents two, three, or four grooves for the tendinous under surface of the obturator internus muscle. The tuberosity is that portion of the ischium which supports the body in the 'sitting posture. It has an inner and an outer lip, and an intermediate space which 'presents two rough surfaces ; of these, the upper and outer is for the origin of the \semi-membranosus, and the lower and inner surface for the conjoint origin of the IITHE SKELETON 150 biceps and semitendinosns. Above the surface for the semimembranosus, the tuberosity gives origin to the gemellus inferior. Its inner edge, or lip, is pro- minent, and gives attaclmient to the falciform edge of the greater sacro-sciati( ligament. The surface of the tuberosity above this lip is in relation with the internal pudic vessels and nerves. The outer lip is occupied by the quadratui Fig. 154.—The Left Hip-bone. (Internal surface.)

The posterior surface of the descending ramus gives origin to the com- pressor urethrcB and a part of the erector penis, the crus penis, and the obturatorTHE SKELETON 152 internus. The inner border is rough and covered with fibro-cartilage, which unites it with the opposite bone to form the imhic syinijliysis. The outer border forms part of the obturator foramen. The inner border of the descending ramus forms with the ramus of the ischium the pubic arch. The upper surface or crest of the pubes is hmited externally by the pubic spine, which gives attachment to the outer (inferior) pillar of the external abdominal ring and Poupart's ligament. The inner extremity of the crest is the angle of the pubes. Between it and the spine the following structures are attached :—the linea Fig. 157.—The Pelvis of a Fcetus at Birth, to show the Three Portions OF THE Innominate Bones. alba, the rectus ahdominis, the xnjramidalis, and the conjoined tendon. The hori- zontal ramus extends from the body of the pubes to the ihum, forming by its outer extremity the anterior one-fifth of the articular surface of the acetabulum. ItsTHE HIP-BONE 153 line of junction with the ihum forms the ilio-pubal ridge. Stretching from this ridge to the pubic spine there is a raised edge continuing the iho-pectineal hne. The [surface of bone in front of the hne is the pectineal surface ; it gives origin to the \pectineus muscle, and is limited below by the obturator crest, which extends from I the pubic spine to the cotyloid notch. The under surface of the horizontal ramus forms the upper boundary of the obturator foramen, and presents a deep groove for the passage of the obturator vessels and nerve. The acetabulum is a circular depression in which the head of the femur is ilodged. It consists of an articular and a non-articular portion. The articular portion is circumferential and horseshoe-shaped; the deficiency is in the lower segment. The pubes forms one-fifth of the acetabulum, and the ischium two- fifths ; the rest is formed by the ilium. In rare instances the pubes may be excluded by a fourth element, the cotyloid bone. The non-articular portion is formed mainly by the ischium, and is continuous below with the margin of the j obturator foramen. The articular portion presents an outer rim to which the I cotyloid ligament is attached, and an inner margin to which the synovial membrane is connected which excludes the ligamentum teres from the synovial cavity. The opposite angles of the horseshoe-shaped margin ^yhich limit the cotyloid notch are united by the transverse ligament, and through the cotyloid foramen thus formed a nerve and vessel enter the joint. The obturator (thyroid) foramen is situated between the ischium and pubes ■Itsmargins are thin, and serve for the attachment of the obturator membrane. At the upper and posterior angle it is deeply grooved for the passage of the obturator I vessels and nerve. j Muscles attached to the hip-bone are :— Gluteus maximus. Gluteus medius. Gluteus minimus.

Triangular. Anterior sacro-iliac. Posterior sacro-iliac.THE SKELETON 154 Blood-supply.—The ilium receives on its anterior surface twigs from the iho- lumbar, deep circumflex iliac, and obturator arteries. On the dorsum, arteries enter it from the gluteal and sciatic trunks. The ischium is supplied by the obturator, internal, and external circumflex. The pubes receives twigs from the obturator, internal and external circumflex, deep epigastric, and the pubic branches of the common femoral artery. Development.—The cartilaginous representative of the hip-bone consists at first of an ilio-ischiatic and a pubic segment. These quickly fuse and form a continuous plate (Rosenberg). Early in the third month a nucleus appears above the acetabulum for the ilium, and one appears a little later below the ca^dty for the ischium. In the fourth month a nucleus is seen in the pubic portion of the cartilage. At birth these three nuclei are of considerable size, but surrounded by relatively wide tracts of Fig. 158.—Hip-bone, showing Secondary Centres. cartilage. In the sixth year the Y-shaped piece of cartilage in the acetabulum ossifies, and, uniting with the three surrounding elements, causes their consolidation, usually about the sixteenth year. When this nucleus is large, it may remain separate until after the twentieth year. This is the acetabular nucleus, and is regarded by some morphologists as the representative of the cotyloid or acetabitlar bone constantly present in a few mammals, and is of sufficient size to excludes the pubes from the cotyloid cavity. During the eighth year the rami of the ischium and pubes coalesce. About the fifteenth year two secondary nuclei appear in the iliac cartilage to form the crest and the anterior inferior spine. An accessory nucleus appears for the ischial tuberosity, and subsequently one for the pubic crest. These fuse with the main bone about the twentieth year. The fibrous tissue connected with the pubic spine represents the epipubic bone of marsupial mammals.155 THE FELVIS THE PELVIS The pelvis is composed of four bones : the two hip-bones, the sacrum, and coccyx. The hip-bones form the lateral and anterior boundaries, meeting each other to form the pubic symphysis ; posteriorly they are separated by the sacrum. The hollow of the pelvis is divided into the false and true pelvic cavity. The false pelvis is that part of the cavity which lies above the ilio-pectineal lines ; this part is in relation with the hypogastric and inguinal regions. The true pelvis is situated below the ilio-pectineal lines. The upper circum- ference, called also the inlet of the pelvis, is bounded anteriorly by the spine and crest of the pubes, posteriorly by the base of the sacrum, and laterally by the ilio- pectineal lines. The inlet in normal pelves is cordate, being obtusely pointed in front ; posteriorly it is encroached upon by the promontory of the sacrum. It has three principal diameters : of these, the antero-posterior, called the conjugate diameter, is measured from the sacro-vertebral angle to the symphysis. The trans- FiG. 159.—The Pelvis (Male). verse diameter represents the greatest width of the pelvic cavity. The oblique is measured from the sacro-iliac synchondrosis to the ilio-pubal ridge. The cavity of the true pelvis is bounded in front by the symphysis pubis, behind by the sacrum and coccyx, and laterally by a smooth wall of bone formed in part by the ilium, in part by the ischium ; it corresponds to the acetabulum. The cavity is shallow in front, where it is formed by the pubes, and is deepest posteriorly. The lower circumference, or outlet, of the pelvis is very irregular, and encroached upon by three bony processes : the posterior process is the coccyx, and the two lateral processes the ischial tuberosities. They separate three notches. The anterior is the pubic arch, and is bounded on each side by the conjoined rami of the pubes and ischium on each side. The two remaining gaps correspond to the greater and lesser sciatic notches ; they are bounded by the ischium anteriorly, the sacrum and coccyx posteriorly, and the ilium above. These are converted into foramina by the greater and lesser sacro-sciatic ligaments.THE SKELETON 156 The position of the pelvis.—In the erect position of the skeleton, the plane of the pelvic inlet forms an angle with the horizontal, which varies in individuals from 50° to 60°. The base of the sacrum in an average pelvis lies nearly 10 cm. {i") above the upper margin of the symphysis pubis. The axis of the pelvis.—This is an imaginary line drawn at right angles to the planes of the brim, cavity, and outlet, through their centres. The average measurements of the diameters of the pelvis in the three planes are given below (after Lusk) :— Diameters At the brim At the outlet Conjugate . . . • inches 3| inches Transverse . . . . 5] ,, 4^ „ Oblique . . . . 5 ,, 4^ „ Sex differences.—In the male the pelvis is deeper, the ridges for muscles more marked, and the bones thicker, than in the female. In the male, the obturator foramen is described as vertically ovate, the pubic symphysis is deep, and the pubic arch small. In the female, the bones are thinner, lighter, and the iliac al^e more expanded than in the male. The symphysis is narrow, the pubic arch wider, and the ischial tuberosities more expanded than in the male. The obturator foramen is described as triangular. The pelvic cavity is larger in most of its measurements. The sacrum is wider, less curved as a rule, and has a less projecting promontory than in the male. THE FEMUR This bone is the largest and longest in the skeleton. The upper extremity is surmounted by a hemispherical cartilage-covered articular portion called the head, which is directed upwards and inwards, to be received in the acetabulum of the hip-bone. A little below the centre of the head is a small rough depression to which the ligamentum teres is attached. The head is connected to the shaft by the neck, a stout rectangular process of bone which forms with the femoral shaft, in the adult, an angle of 125°. Its anterior surface is in the same plane with the front aspect of the shaft, but it is marked off from it by a ridge to which the capsule of the hip-joint is attached. This ridge commences at the greater trochanter in a small prominence, the superior cervical tubercle, and extends obliquely downwards to the inferior cervical tubercle, and, winding to the back of the femur, becomes continuous with the inner lip of the linea aspera. The Avhole of this ridge is called the spiral line, but the part between the cervical tubercles is often called the anterior intertrochanteric line. The superior and inferior tubercles receive the limbs of the ilio-femoral or Y-shaped thickening in the capsule of the hip-joint. The posterior surface of the neck is smooth and concave, its inner half is enclosed in the capsule of the hip-joint. The superior surface is narrow, and pitted with nutrient foramina ; it runs downward to the greater trochanter. The inferior surface, concave in outline, terminates at the lesser trochanter. The trochanters are prominences which afford attachment to muscles which rotate the thigh; they are two in number, the greater and the lesser. The greater trochanter is quadrilateral, and surmounts the junction of the neck with the shaft. Of its two surfaces, the external is the broader ; it is bisected diagonally by a ridge running from the posterior superior to the anterior inferiorTHE FEMUB 157 angle. The gluteus medius is inserted into this ridge ; a bursa occasionally inter- poses between the tendon and the bone. The inner surface presents a deep pit, the trochanteric fossa, which receives the tendon of the obturator extemus. The upper border, called the tip, gives attachment from before backwards to the tendons of the obturator internus with the gevielU, and the jjyriformis. The anterior border receives the gluteus minimus. The posterior border is thick, rounded, and con- tinuous with the posterior intertrochanteric line, which runs downwards to terminate at the lesser trochanter, a conical prominence on the posterior aspect of the femur to which the i^soas is inserted. Eunning downwards from the lesser trochanter to meet the spiral line is a slender ridge, to which the iliacus is inserted. The surface of bone slightly posterior to this ridge is occupied by the pcctineus. This part of the femur presents several converging ridges, which will be most con- veniently considered with the linea aspera. The shaft of the femur is cylindrical in shape, and presents, in the middle I third of its posterior aspect, a prominent vertical ridge of bone, the linea aspera, I for the origin and insertion of muscles. In the middle of the shaft the linea aspera presents an inner lip, an outer lip, and an intervening space. Towards the upper third of the shaft these three parts diverge : the outer lip becomes continuous with I the gluteal ridge, and ends at the base of the greater trochanter. When very prominent the gluteal ridge is termed the third trochanter. It affords attachment to the gluteus maximus. The inner lip curves inwards below the lesser trochanter^ I and becomes the spiral line. The middle portion of the linea aspera bifurcates, the I inner portion as it runs on to the lesser trochanter receives the iliacus ; the outer ! passes upwards to the centre of the posterior intertrochanteric line ; it receives j the quadratus femoris, and is called the linea quadrati. The upper limit of this line is often indicated by a rounded tubercle. Towards the lower third of the shaft, the inner and outer lips of the linea aspera diverge to become continuous with the condylar ridges. Several muscles are connected with the linea aspera. The vastus internus arises from the whole length of the inner lip, and the vastus externus from the outer lip. The adductor magnus is inserted into the upper half of the outer lip, and the lower half of the inner lip. The adductor long us and brevis are inserted into the intervening space ; the adductor longus takes rather more than the middle third, and overlaps the lower part of the adductor brevis, which takes rather more than the upper third. The outer lip in its lower two-thirds gives origin to the shorter head of the biceps. The condylar lines are two in number; the outer is continuous with the outer lip of the linea aspera and terminates inferiorly on the outer edge of the external condyle. From the upper half of this line a part of the short head of the biceps arises. Near its termination the line expands to give origin to the plantaris and the outer head of the gastrocnemius. The inner I condylar line is not so prominent as the outer ; it is continuous with the inner lip of the linea aspera, and terminates at the adductor tubercle. The adductor magnus is inserted into the whole length of the line and to the tubercle. Near the middle of the line there is an interruption where the femoral artery passes through the^ opening in the tendon of the adductor magnus. The inner head of the gastro- cnemius arises from the femur immediately above the internal condyle. The space enclosed between these diverging lines forms part of the anterior boundary of the- popliteal space, and is in close relation with the popliteal vessels. The shaft of the^ femur is overlapped on the inner side by the vastus internus, and on the outer side- by the vastus externus. The greater part of the anterior surface of the femoraL shaft affords origin to the crureus. The lower extremity presents two cartilage-covered condyles, separated by a. deep notch. The external condyle is more prominent anteriorly and wider than its fellow. The internal is more prominent posteriorly, and narrower; it is also longer, to compensate for the olliquity of the shaft.

Posteriorly the condyles are separated by a deep pit or notch ; anteriorly they are united by an articular surface, over which the patella glides. The inner surface of the internal condyle has, near its posterior border, a rough surface for the internal lateral ligament of the knee joint ; above this is the adductor tubercle. The surface of this condyle, which bounds the inter condyloid notch, affords attachment^ Fig. 162.—The Femur at Birth. APPEARS EARLY IN THE NINTH MONTH OF INTRA-UTERINE LIFE near the anterior border, to the posterior crucial ligament. The surface of the external condyle which bounds the notch gives attachment, at its posterior part, to the anterior crucial hgament. The outer surface of the external condyle presents near the lower and posterior margin a deep groove, which receives the tendon of the popliteus muscle when the leg is flexed. The groove is sur- mounted by a tubercle for the external lateral ligament of the knee. The patellar facet is trochlear in shape; its outer portion is more extensive than the inner, corresponding to the disposition of the articular facets on the posterior surface of the patella.161 THE FEMUB Muscles attached to the femur : — Pyriformis.

Blood-supply.—The head and neck of the femur receive branches from the sciatic, obturator, and circumflex arteries. The trochanter receives twigs from the circumflex arteries. The nutrient vessel for the shaft is derived from the second MTHE SKELETON 162 perforating ; it enters near the middle of the hnea aspera, and is directed towards the head of the bone. The condyles are nourished by articular branches froni the popliteal and the anastomotic of the femoral. Ossification.—The shaft of the femur begins to ossify in the seventh week oi intra-uterine life. Early in the ninth month a nucleus appears for the condyles. During the first year the nucleus for the head of the bone is visible, and one for the greater trochanter in the fourth year. The centre for the lesser trochanter is visible about the thirteenth or fourteenth year. The lesser trochanter joins the shaft at the eighteenth, the greater trochanter at the nineteenth, the head about the twentieth, and the condyles at the twenty-first year. The neck of the femur is an apoijliysis, or outgrowth from the shaft. The line of fusion of the condyloid epiphysis lies below the adductor tubercle, so that the tubercle with the spaces from which the gastrocnemius and plantaris arise, belong to the shaft, and not to the epiphysis. The morphological relation of the patellar facet to the articular portions of the condyles is worth notice. In a few^ mammals, such as the ox, this facet remains separated from the condyles by a furrow of rough bone. In the human femur it is faintly marked off by a shallow groove in the cartilage, best seen in a recently opened knee-joint. Some anatomists attribute these grooves in the cartilage to the pressure of the semilunar fibro-cartilages. The angle which the neck of the femur forms with the shaft measures at birth, on an average, 160°. In the adult it varies from 110° to 140° ; hence the angle decreases greatly during the period of growth. When once growth is completed, the angle, as a rule, remains fixed. (Humphry.) The patella is a sesamoid bone, somewhat triangular in shape, situated in] front of the knee-joint. Its anterior surface is slightly convex, and pitted with THE PATELLA Fig. 164.—The Left Patella. Anterior surface Posterior surface EXTERNAL ARTICULAR FACET small openings, which transmit nutrient vessels to the interior of the bone. This surface is subcutaneous ; a bursa intervenes between it and the skin. The posterior surface is concave, and in great part cartilage-covered, forming a compound163 THE PATELLA irticular surface for gliding upon the femoral condyles. A slightly marked vertical :idge divides this surface into an outer larger portion for the external condyle, and m inner portion for the internal condyle. A slender articular facet close to the .nner edge is sometimes marked off by a faint vertical ridge ; this facet comes .n contact with the internal condyle in extreme flexion of the leg. The lower oart of the bone is produced to a blunt point, which is embedded in the patellar igament, especially on the posterior aspect. The upper two-thirds of the circum- ierence receives directly the fibres of the vastus interims and exterims, the bmreics and rectus femoris muscles. Blood-supply.—The patella receives twigs from the superficial branch of the mastomotica, anterior tibial recurrent, and the inferior articular of the popliteal. I Ossification.—The cartilage for the patella appears in the fourth month of intra-uterine life. The ossific nucleus is visible in the third year. THE TIBIA The tibia is the larger bone of the leg ; it is situated on the inner side of, and aearly parallel with, the fibula. The upper extremity, or head, consists of two i'ateral eminences, or tuberosities. The superior surfaces of the tuberosities receive the condyles of the femur, the articular surfaces being separated by a non-articular ridge, to which ligaments are attached. The internal articular surface is oval in shape and concave for the internal condyle of the femur. The external articular surface is smaller, somewhat circular in shape, and presents an almost plane surface for the external condyle. The peripheral portion of each articular surface is overlaid by a fibro-cartilage of semilunar shape, connected with the margins of the tuberosities by bands of fibrous tissue, termed coronary ligaments. Each semilunar fibro-cartilage is attached firmly to the rough tract sepa- rating the articular surfaces. This intermediate space is broad and depressed in front, where it affords attachment to the anterior limb of the internal and external semilunar cartilages and the anterior crucial ligament. Standing upwards from the middle of this surface is the spine of the tibia. The posterior aspect of the base of the spine affords attachment to the posterior limb of the external and internal semilunar fibro-cartilages, and limits a deep notch inclined towards the inner tuberosity; this notch gives origin to the posterior crucial ligament. Anteriorly, the two tuberosities are confluent, and form a somewhat flattened surface of triangular outline ; its apex forms the tubercle of the tibia. The liga- mentum patellae is inserted into the lower part of the tubercle; the upper part is smooth and separated from the ligament by a bursa. Laterally the inner tuber- osity is less prominent, though more extensive than the outer; near the posterior part of its circumference there is a deep horizontal groove for the central portion |of the semimembranosus tendon. The margins of this groove and the surface of bone below give attachment to the internal lateral ligament of the knee. At a corresponding point of the outer tuberosity there is a rounded articular facet for the head of the fibula ; the circumference of the facet is rough for ligaments, i The shaft is prismatic, and very thick near the head ; towards the lower third it jis thinner and tapering, and gradually expands towards the lower end. It has three [borders: the anterior is very prominent, and known as the crest of the tibia: Icommencing on the outer edge of the tubercle, it runs downwards and curves ;inwards, to terminate at the anterior margin of the malleolus. This border gives attachment to the deep fascia of the leg. The internal border starts from the M 2164 THE SKELETON Fig. 165.—The Left Tibia and Fibula. (Anterior view.)

The internal lateral ligament is attached to its upper 7*5 cm. (3"), and the middle third gives origin to the soleus. The interosseous border extends from the fibular facet on the outer tuberosity to the lower end of the bone ; towards its termination the border bifurcates to enclose a triangular space for the attachment of the inter- osseous ligament between the tibia and fibula. The part above the bifurcation is connected with the interosseous membrane. These borders limit three surfaces. The internal surface is bounded by the internal border and the crest; it is broad above, where it receives the insertion of the sartorms, gracilis, and semitendinosus ; the rest of the surface is convex and subcutaneous. The external surface lies between the crest of the tibia and the interosseous border. The upper two-thirds presents a hollow for the origin of the tibialis anticns ; the rest of the surface is overlaid by the extensor tendons and the anterior tibial vessels. The posterior surface is limited by the interosseous ridge and the internal border. The upper part presents a rough oblique ridge, extending from the fibular facet on the outer tuberosity to the internal border, a little above the middle of the bone. This oblique ridge gives origin to the soktis and attachment to the popliteal fascia; the surface above is for the insertion of the 20opliteus. An indefinite vertical ridge commences near the middle of the oblique line, and marks off a semilunar space, limited externally by the mterosseous border. This is for the tibialis posticus; it extends as low as the junction of the middle and lower thirds. The portion of bone outside this vertical line is for the flexor longus digitorum. The lower third of the posterior surface is covered by flexor tendons. The inferior extremity is somcAvhat quadrilateral, and resembles the distal end of the radius. Its inferior surface is articular for the upper surface of the astragalus and is continuous with the external surface of the malleolus, which articulates with the facet on the inner side of the astragalus. The outer surface has a triangular rough area for the lower end of the shaft of the fibula, its margins being rough for ligaments. The anterior border is slightly convex, and by its margin gives attachment to the anterior ligament of the ankle. The posterior surface has two grooves: the one which encroaches on the malleolus is for the tendons of tibialis posticus and flexor longus digitorum, and an outer shallow groove for the tendon of flexor longus hallucis. The inner surface is prolonged downwards to form the malleolus; from its tip and margins the internal lateral (deltoid) ligament of the ankle joint arises. The inner surface of the malleolus is convex and subcutaneous; the outer, as already stated, has a facet for the inner surface of the astragalus.

The nutrient artery for the jhaft is furnished by the posterior tibial; it enters the bone near the interosseous Fig. 167.—The Tibia and Fibula at the Sixteenth Year. APPEARS AT BIRTH; UNITES AT TWENTY- ONE; BUT IS SOMEriMES DELAYED TO TWENTY-FIVE APPEARS AT THE FIFTH YEAR ; UNITES AT TWENTY-TWO border at the junction of the upper and middle thirds, and is directed downwards. The head of the bone receives numerous branches from the inferior articular arteries of the popliteal, and the recurrent branches of the anterior and posterior tibial arteries. The lower extremity receives twigs from the posterior and anterior tibial, the anterior peroneal, and internal malleolar arteries. Ossification.—The centre for the shaft of the tibia appears in the eighth week of intra-uterine Hfe. Towards the end of the ninth month, a small earthy nucleus168 THE SKELETON appears in the cartilaginous head of the tibia. The nucleus for the lower ex- tremity appears in the second year, and unites with the shaft at eighteen. The ' epiphysis for the head of the bone is one of the last to unite with its shaft; thisj ' e /ent usually occurs about the twenty-first year, but may be delayed until twenty- ] five. The tubercle of the tibia is usually ossified from the epiphysis ; occasionally ] it has an independent nucleus. fte ^ fie THE FIBULA in This is a long and slender bone, lying to the outer side of, and nearly parallel with the tibia; the middle of the shaft is somewhat posterior to that of the tibia. The upper extremity, or head, is of irregular form, and presents an oblique facet on its inner aspect for articulation with the outer tuberosity of the tibia ; the adjacent surfaces afford attachment to the superior tibio-fibular ligaments. The outer border ||e of the head is prolonged into the styloid process, and gives attachment to the external lateral ligament of the knee ; the base of the process receives the biceps tendon. Near this point a portion of the iMroneus longus arises ; and posteriorly the head of the bone gives origin to the upper fibres of the soleus. The lower extremity, or external malleolus, is a thick, pyramidal process of bone. Its inner surface presents anteriorly a triangular facet for articulation with the fibular facet on the outer side of the body of the astragalus. Posterior to this facet is the malleolar fossa, for the reception of the posterior fasciculus of the external lateral ligament of the ankle when the foot is extended. This fasciculus of the ligament arises from the margin of the fossa. Above the facet, the bone; is rough for the inferior tibio-fibular ligaments. The outer surface is subcutaneous, The anterior surface gives attachment to the anterior fasciculus of the external lateral ligament of the ankle. The posterior surface has a shallow groove foi^ the passage of the tendons of the ]jeroneus longus and brevis. The tip of the malleolus gives attachment to the middle fasciculus of the external lateral ligament of the ankle. In the adult the fibular malleolus projects lower, and is! more prominent than the tibial malleolus. The shaft is very variable in contour, and it is extremely difficult to find two fibula alike. It has a well-marked anterior border, which, beginning in front of the head of the bone, divides in the lower third of the shaft, to enclose a triangular subcutaneous surface continuous with the outer surface of the malleolus. This border gives attachment to the anterior tibial fascia. The shaft on the outer side of this border is usually deeply concave for a part of its extent, and gives origin to the peroneus longus and brevis, and may be called the peroneal (or outer) surface Commencing at the head of the bone, in common with the anterior margin, and then gently diverging from it, is the ridge to which the interosseous ligament is attached. In the middle of the shaft the interosseous ridge is usually well marked, and separated by 5 mm. from the anterior border. From the very narrow surface limited by these ridges, the extensor longus digitoriim, peroneus tertius, and extensor longus hallucis arise. This is the extensor (or anterior) surface. The remainder of the shaft is the flexor (or posterior) surface, and possesses three sub divisions. One in the middle of its posterior aspect (in the midst of which is the orifice for the nutrient artery) gives origin to the flexor longus hallucis. This is limited above by the oblique line for the fibular origin of the soleus. Between these subdivisions and the interosseous ridge is the surface for the fibular origin of the tibialis posticus.169 THE FIBULA The muscles arismg from the fibula are :— Soleus. Peroneus tertius. j Tibialis posticus. Flexor longus hallucis. j Peroneus longus. Extensor longus digitorum. Peroneus brevis. Extensor proprius hallucis. I } The fibula affords insertion to the biceps. The following ligaments are connected with it:— External lateral of the knee. Transverse. Anterior tibio-fibular. Anterior tibio-fibular (inferior). Posterior tibio-fibular. Posterior tibio-fibular. Interosseous membrane. External annular. External lateral ligament of ankle. Anterior annular (vertical). Blood-supply.—The fibula receives the nutrient artery of its shaft from the peroneal branch of the posterior tibial. The head is nourished by branches from the inferior external articular branch of the popliteal artery, and the malleolus is supplied mainly by the peroneal, anterior peroneal, and external malleolar arteries. Development.—The shaft of the fibula commences to ossify in the eighth week of intra-uterine life. A nucleus appears for the lower in the second year, and one in the fifth year for the upper extremity. The lower extremity fuses with the shaft about twenty, but the upper one remains separate until the twenty-second year. The human fibula differs from all others in the excessive length of its malleolus ; in no other vertebrate does this process descend below the level of the tibial malle- olus. In the majority of mammals the tibial descends to a lower level than the fibular malleolus. In the human embryo of the fourth month, the outer (fibular) is very much smaller than the inner (tibial) malleolus. At the seventh month they are equal in length ; at birth, the fibular malleolus is the longer ; and by the second year it assumes its adult proportion. (Gegenbaur.) The fibula is a vestigial bone in man, and survives mainly on account of the excessive development of its malleolus. This accounts for the fact that the lower epiphysis, though appearing first, unites with the shaft before the upper epiphysis. In birds, the head of the bone is large, and enters into the formation of the knee-joint, whilst the lower end atrophies. THE FOOT The bones comprised in the skeleton of the foot are arranged in three groups :— tarsus, metatarsus, and phalanges. The tarsus consists of seven bones :—The astragalus, os calcis or calcaneum, scaphoid, cuboid, and three cuneiform bones. THE ASTEAGALUS This bone may, for descriptive purposes, be divided into a body, neck, and head. The body is quadrilateral. Its upper aspect resembles a segment of the wheel of a pulley ; hence it is called the trochlear surface. It is broader in front than behind. a,nd articulates with the lower end of the tibia.THE SKELETON 170 The inferior surface is occnpiecl by an elongated concave facet for articulatior with the calcaneum. The internal surface presents a pyriform facet, broad in front, and continuoui Fig. 168.—The Left Foot. (Dorsal surface.)

The neck is the constricted portion of the bone, and is continuous posteriorly with the body of the astragalus. Superiorly, the neck is rough, and has numerous foramina for blood-vessels. Inferiorly, it presents a deep groove, directed from behind forwards and outwards. When the astragalus is articulated with the calcaneum, this furrow is converted into a canal in which is lodged the calcaneo- astragaloid (interosseous) ligament. The inner edge of this furrow is limitedl by an articular facet, which runs forward to become continuous with the facet on| the head of the bone, and, like the articular surface of the sustentaculum tali of the calcaneum on which it glides, is sometimes divided. The head of the astragalus is furnished anteriorly with an ovoid facet, whichl is received by the posterior surface of the scaphoid. On the inner and lower part, at the spot where the sustentacular facet becomes confluent with that on the head, there is a smaller facet separated by a ridge : this plays upon the calcaneo-scaphoid or spring ligament. Fig. 170.—The Left Astragalus. (Plantar view.) HEAD GROOVE FOR THE FLEXOR LONGUS HALLUCIS FOR CALCANEUM FOR THE SUSTENTACULUM TALI FOR THE CALCANEO-ASTRAGALOID (OR THE SPRING) LIGAMENT, FOR SCAPHOID The OS trigonum.—Occasionally the small portion of the astragalus posterio to the trochlear surface containing the groove which lodges the flexor longu. hallucis tendon is separate from the rest of the astragalus, and is known as thi OS trigonum, or secondary astragalus (fig. 171). Articulations.—The astragalus articulates with four bones, the tibia, fibula scaphoid, and calcaneum ; and presents seven articular facets ; and when the face: for the sustentaculum tali is divided, as is so often the case, the articular surface; are increased to eight. Sometimes it presents a facet on the outer margin of it; head for the cuboid, thus increasing the articular surfaces to nine. i Ligaments:— Internal lateral ligament (deltoid). External lateral ligament. Astragalo-scaphoid. Calcaneo-astragaloid (interosseous).! External calcaneo-astragaloid.

Ossification.—The astragalus is ossified from one, occasionally from two, nucle The principal centre for this bone appears in the middle of the cartilaginous astra173 THE ASTBAGALUS rains at the seventh month of embryonic hfe. The additional centre is deposited n the posterior portion of the bone, and forms tliat part of the astragahis which, tvhen it remains separate from the rest of the bone, is known as the os trigonum. A.t birth, the astragahis presents some important pecuharities in the disposition of she articular facet on the tibial side of its body, and in the obliquity of its neck. If, in the adult astragalus, a line be drawn through the middle of the trochlear surface parallel with its inner border, and a second line be drawn along the outer ide of the neck of the bone so as to intersect the first, the angle formed by these wo lines will express the obliquity of the neck of the bone. This in the adult varies Fig. 171.—An Astragalus with the Os Teigonum. OS TRIGONUM greatly, but the average may be taken as 10°. In the foetus at birth the angle averages 35°, whilst in a young orang it measures 45°. In the normal adult astra- galus the articular surface on the tibial side is limited to the body of the bone. In the foetal astragalus it extends for some distance on to the neck, and some- times reaches almost as far forward as the scaphoid facet on the head of the bone. This disposition of the inner malleolar facet is a characteristic feature of the astragalus in the chimpanzee and the orang. It is related to the inverted position of the foot which is found in the human embryo to near the period of birth, and is of interest to the surgeon in connection with some varieties of club-foot. (Shattock and Parker.) THE CALCANEUM The calcaneum, or os calcis, is the largest tarsal bone. It is cuboidal in shape, and presents, for examination, six surfaces. The superior surface has in its middle a large, oval, convex, articular facet for the under aspect of the body of the astralagus ; behind the facet, the bone is rough and convex laterally. In front of the facet the bone presents a deep depres- sion, the floor of which is rough for the attachment of ligaments, especially the calcaneo-astragaloid, and the origin of the extensor hrevis digitorum muscle; when the calcaneum and astragalus are articulated, this portion of the bone forms a floor to a cavity sometimes called the sinus pedis. Internally, this upper surface of the bone presents a well-marked lip, the sustentaculum tali, furnished with an elon- gated concave facet, occasionally divided into two, for articulation with the neck of the astragalus.THE SKELETON 174 The inferior surface is narrow and rough ; it ends posteriorly in two tubercles : the inner is the larger and broader, the outer is narrower but prominent. The inner tubercle affords origin to the abductor haUiccis, the flexor brevis digitorum, and the abductor minimi digiti; the last muscle also arises from the inner tubercle, and the ridge of bone connecting the tubercles. The outer tubercle affords Fig. 172.—The Left Calcaneum. (Dorsal view.)

The rough surface in front of the tubercles gives attachment to the long plantar ligament (calcaneo-cuboid) and the outer head of the flexor accessorius. Near its anterior end this surface forms a rounded eminence, the anterior tubercle, from Avhich (and the shallow groove in front) the short plantar (calcaneo-cuboid) ligament arises. The external surface is rough and slightly convex. Near the middle of this. Fig. 173.—The Calcaneum at the Fifteenth Yeae, showing the Epiphysis. APPEARS AT THE TENTH, AND UNITES AT THE SIXTEENTH YEAR surface there is a small tubercle for the middle fasciculus of the external lateral ligament of the ankle joint. Anteriorly, we notice the two shallow peroneal grooves,, separated by a tubercle, which is sometimes very prominent. The upper groove is for the tendon of the i)eroneus brevis, and the lower lodges the tendon of tha Ijeroneus longus.THE CALCANEUM 175 The inner surface is deeply concave, the hollow being increased by the over- hanging sustentaculum tali in front and above, and the prominent inner tubercle posteriorly. The under aspect of the sustentaculum is deeply grooved for the tendon of the flexor longus hallucis, whilst the hollow below receives the plantar vessels and nerves. Its lower border serves for the attachment of the inner head of the flexor accessorius. The margin of the sustentaculum has attached to it a 'part of the deltoid ligament. The anterior surface is a concave articular facet for the posterior surface of j the cuboid. Its outer and superior angle is somewhat prominent. The posterior surface is roughly rounded, and at the lower part serves for the attachment of the tendo Achillis. At its upper part it is smooth, and is in relation with a bursa. Articulations.—The calcaneum articulates with the cuboid, the astragalus, and with the OS trigonum when it exists as a separate element. Muscles attached to the calcaneum:— Extensor brevis digitorum. Abductor ossis metatarsi quinti. Abductor hallucis. Accessorius. Flexor brevis digitorum. Tendo Achillis. ! Abductor minimi digiti. Plantaris. And a slip from the tibialis posticus. Ligaments :— i Internal lateral of ankle. ' Anterior annular. j External lateral of ankle. Calcaneo-astragaloid (interosseous). Superior calcaneo-cuboid ligaments. External calcaneo-astragaloid. Inferior calcaneo-cuboid ligaments. Posterior calcaneo-astragaloid. Internal annular. Superior calcaneo-scaphoid. External annular. Inferior calcaneo-scaphoid. i Blood-supply.—The calcaneum is a vascular bone, and derives its blood from the posterior tibial, and the internal and external malleolar arteries. I Ossification.—^The primary nucleus for this bone is deposited in the sixth month j of embryonic life. In the tenth year a nucleus appears for the epiphysis at the ! heel, and unites with the body of the bone at the sixteenth year. The inner and I outer tubercles are formed by the epiphysis. THE CUBOID This bone is situated on the outer side of the tarsus; its posterior surface is reniform in shape and articular for the anterior face of the calcaneum. The anterior surface is smaller, and divided by a low vertical ridge; the inner facet Fig. 174.—The Left Cuboid. (Inner view.)

The upper (dorsal) surface is rough and non-articular. The inferior (plantar) surface is divided by a prominent ridge, which limits a deep furrow directed176 THE SKELETON from without forwards and inwards. This, the peroneal groove, lodges th( tendon of the peroneus long-us. The corner of the ridge on the narrow outer (fibular) border of the bone usually faceted for a sesamoid bone frequently found in the tendon of the peroneuf longus. The margin of the ridge and the surface of bone behind it afford attach ment to the long and short plantar (calcaneo-cuboid) ligaments. The flexor brevi hallucis muscle has a small attachment to this part of the cuboid. The internal surface presents near its middle and upper part an oval facet foi articulation with the external cuneiform bone ; behind this, a second facet for th( scaphoid is frequently seen. Occasionally the two facets are confluent and form ar elliptical surface. The remainder of the internal surface is rough, and has strong interosseous ligaments attached to it. Jutting from the inferior internal angle of the posterior surface is a process oj bone (calcanean process of cuboid), which projects beneath the sustentaculum tah Fig. 175.—The Left Cuboid.

Ossification.—The cuboid is ossified from a single centre which appears a fe^ days after birth. Occasionally the nucleus is visible as a minute earthy spot the middle of the cartilage at birth. THE SCAPHOID The scaphoid (navicular) bone receives in the hollow of its posterior surface| the head of the astragalus. Anteriorly it is convex, and divided by two vertical ridges into three facets, for the internal, middle, and external cuneiform bones.j Occasionally a fourth facet, extremely variable in size, is seen at the outer inferior] angle for the cuboid. The upper (dorsal) surface is rough and broad; the inferior (plantar) surface is| nothing more than a ridge. The outer surface is rough for ligaments ; whilst the' inner forms a large and prominent eminence, the scaphoid tuberosity, which affords an important attachment for the tibialis loosticus tendon.

THE CUNEIFORM BONES The cuneiform bones, three in number, are named from within outwards— internal, middle, and external. They are wedge-shaped. The INTERNAL CUNEIFORM is distinguished by its large size, and from the ) fact that, when articulated, the base of the wedge is directed downwards, and the i sharp border upwards. The posterior surface is concave and pyriform for articu- lating with the inner facet of the scaphoid. The anterior surface is a reniform articular facet for the base of the first metatarsal. The internal surface is rough, and presents an oblique groove for the tendon of the tibialis anticus : this groove I is limited inferiorly by an oval facet into which a portion of the tendon is inserted. The external surface is concave and rough, except along the posterior and superior borders. Near the anterior extremity of the superior border there exists a distinct circular facet for the inner side of the base of the second metatarsal. In front of the facet a few fibres of the first dorsal interosseous muscle arise. The remaining sinuous articular facet is for the inner surface of the middle cuneiform.

Muscles.—The flexor brevis hallucis and a slip from the tibiahs posticus. Ossification.—A single nucleus appears in the course of the first year. The three cuneiform bones rest posteriorly against the scaphoid ; and as they are of unequal length, the middle being the smallest, it follows that when the bones are placed in their natural positions a deep gap or recess is formed in front. Into this recess the base of the second metatarsal is received, thus explaining the small facets at the anterior superior angles of the internal and external cuneiforms. THE METATABSUS The metatarsus consists of five bones, numbered one to five, beginning at the hallux. Each metatarsal presents a proximal portion termed the base, and a distal end or head. The shaft of each bone, with the exception of the first, is prismatic ; the base of the prism is directed upwards, and the narrow edge downwards. The shaft tapers gradually from the base to the head and is slightly bowed, the concavity being on the plantar aspect. • The base is prismatic : its terminal surface is faceted for articulation with the tarsus, and the adjacent borders of the base present small facets, in most cases for adjacent metatarsals. The head is semicircular, forming a convex articular surface for the base of the first phalanx. The compressed sides of the head present near their centres a depression surmounted by a prominent tubercle. The plantar surface is deeply N 2THE SKELETON 180 grooved for the passage of flexor tendons. To the sides of the head the latera ligaments of the metatarso-phalangeal joints are attached. The FIRST METATARSAL is the most modified ; it is shorter, but much thicke: than its fellows. The base presents a reniform, slightly concave facet for thi Fig. 184.—The First (Left) Metatarsal.

On the outer (fibular) side of the base, near its lowe: angle, there is a tubercle into which the peroneus longus is inserted. A little above this, there is frequently a shallow but easily recognised facet where it comes into contact with the base of the second metatarsal.THE METATABSUS 181 The head of the bone has two deep grooves on the plantar surface for the samoids developed in the flexor hrevis hallucis muscle.

Its base is prolonged backwards to occupy the space between the internal and external cuneiform bones ; this leads to the formation of a small facet at the superior angle on the tibial side where it articulates with the internal cuneiform. It occasionally presents a smallTHE SKELETON 182 facet for the first metatarsal. The outer (fibular) side of the base has two facets! each subdivided in well-marked bones. The dorsal facet is long and narrow ; th(! posterior section articulates with the external cuneiform; the anterior is for tb; third metatarsal. The lower facet is somewhat circular : its posterior section is fo:| the external cuneiform, the anterior for the third metatarsal. The terminal facet ori the base is for the middle cuneiform : thus the second metatarsal articulates witl three cuneiform bones. i Muscles.—-Adductor hallucis ; first and second dorsal interosseous. ! Blood-supply.—The nutrient artery enters on the fibular side near the middl(! of the shaft, and is directed towards the base of the bone. , The THIRD METATARSAL articulates by its base with the external cuneiform' It has on the inner (tibial) side two facets : one below the other for the secondl metatarsal, and a large facet on the fibular side for the fourth metatarsal.

Blood-supply.—The nutrient artery enters on the inner (tibial) side of the shaft near its middle : it is directed towards the base. The FOURTH METATARSAL has a somewhat quadrilateral terminal facet for the cuboid bone. On its inner (tibial) side it has a large facet for the third metatarsal: the posterior part of this is occasionally marked off for the external cuneiform, but this is far from constant. When this cuneiform facet is present, the facet extends to the base of the bone. When absent, the surface is rough for ligament. The outer (fibular) side has a single facet for the fifth metatarsal. Muscles.—Adductor hallucis ; second plantar interosseous ; third and fourth dorsal interosseous. | Blood-supply.—The nutrient artery of the shaft enters on the inner (tibials side I and runs towards the base. The FIFTH METATARSAL has on the fibular side of its base a large nipple- ^ shaped tuberosity, to which the tendon of the peroneiis brevis is inserted. Its j oblique terminal facet articulates with the cuboid, and on the tibial side it has aTHE METATABSUS 183 arge facet for the fourth metatarsal. The plantar aspect of the base has a jhallow groove which lodges the abductor minimi digiti. I Muscles:— Third plantar interosseous. Peroneus tertius. Fourth dorsal interosseous. Abductor ossis metatarsi quinti. Peroneus brevis. Flexor brevis minimi digiti. Blood-supply.—The nutrient artery enters on the tibial side of the shaft and s towards the base. Ossification.—Each metatarsal ossifies from two centres. The primary nucleus or the diaphysis appears in the eighth week of embryonic life in the middle of the [cartilaginous metatarsal. At birth, each extremity is represented by cartilage, and that at the proximal end is ossified by extension from the primary nucleus, except in the case of the first metatarsal. For this, a nucleus appears in the third year. The distal ends of the four outer metatarsals are ossified by secondary nuclei I which make their appearance about the third year. Very frequently an epiphysis lis found at the distal end of the first metatarsal as well as at its base. The shafts J and epiphyses consolidate at the twentieth year. The sesamoids belonging to the \ flexor brevis hallucis begin to ossify about the fifth year. THE PHALANGES There are fourteen phalanges to each foot. The hallux has two, and the remaining toes three each. They are usually distinguished as first, second, and third. The last are sometimes called the ungual phalanges, because they support the nail. Fig. 189.—The Phalanges of the Middle Toe. THIRD, TERMINAL OR UNGUAL PHALANX SECOND PHALANX FIRST PHALANX The phalanges of the first row have narrow laterally compressed shafts, rounded on the dorsal and concave on the plantar aspects. The bases have deep glenoid fossae for the convex heads of the metatarsals with which they articulate ; whilst the heads have trochlear surfaces for the bases of the second phalanges. The phalanges of the second row are stunted, insignificant bones. Their184 THE SKELETON shafts are flatter than those of the first row, besides being much shorter. The bases have two depressions, separated by a vertical ridge. The heads present trochlear surfaces for the ungual phalanges. The third, terminal, or ung-ual phalanges are easily recognised. The bases articulate with the second phalanges ; the shafts are expanded to support the nails, and their palmar surfaces are rough where they come into relation with the pulp of the digit.

SURGEON TO AND LECTURER ON SURGERY, FORMERLY LECTURER ON ANATOMY AT THE MIDDLESEX HOSPITAL ; LATE EXAMINER IN ANATOMY IN THE UNIVERSITY OF DURHAM ; FOR THE CONJOINT BOARD OP THE ROYAL COLLEGES OF PHYSICIANS AND SURGEONS ; AND FOR THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE ROYAL COLLEGE OF SURGEONS. THE section devoted to the Articulations or Joints deals with the union of the various and dissimilar parts of the human skeleton. The following structures enter into the formation of joints. Bones constitute the basis of most joints. The articular ends are expanded, and are composed of cancellous tissue, surrounded by a dense and strong shell of compact tissue. This shell has no Haversian canals (the vessels of the cancellous tissue turn back and do not perforate it), or large lacunae, and no canaliculi, and are thus well adapted to bear pressure. The long bones articulate by their ends, the flat by their edges, and the short at various parts on their surfaces. The cartilage which covers the articular ends of the bones is called articular, and is of the hyaline variety. It is firmly implanted on the bone by one surface, while the other is smooth, polished, and free, thus reducing friction to a minimum, while its slight elasticity tends to break jars. It ends abruptly at the edge of the articulation, and is thickest over the areas of greatest pressure. Another form of cartilage, the white fibrous, is also found in joints :— (i) As interarticular cartilage in diarthrodial joints —viz., the knee, temporo- mandibular, sterno-clavicular, radio-carpal, and occasionally in the acromio- clavicular. It is interposed between the ends of the bones, partially or completely dividing the synovial cavity into two. It serves to adjust dissimilar bony surfaces, adding to the security of, while it increases the extent of motion at, the joint, and also acts as a buffer to break shocks. (ii) As circumferential or marginal fibro-cartilages, they serve to deepen the sockets for the reception of the heads of bones—e.g. the glenoid and cotyloid; ligaments of the shoulder and knee. Another form of marginal plate is seen in' the glenoid ligaments of the fingers and toes, which deepen the articulations of the phalanges and adds to their security. (iii) As connecting fibro-cartilage. The more pliant and elastic is the more cellular form, and is found in the intervertebral discs ; while the less yielding andi more fibrous form is seen in the sacro-iliac and pubic articulations, where there is little or no movement. The ligaments which bind the bones together are strong bands of white fibrous tissue, forming a more or less perfect capsule, round the articulation. They are pliant but inextensile, varying in shape, strength, and thickness according to the187 VABIOUS ARTICULATIONS likind of articulation into which they enter. They are closely connected with the llperiostenm of the bones they unite. In some cases—as the ligamenta subflava llwhich unite parts not in contact—they are formed of yellow elastic tissue. Il The synovial membrane, lines the interior of the fibrous ligaments, thus llexcluding them, as well as the cushions or pads of fatty tissue situate within land the tendons which perforate the fibrous capsule, from the articular cavity, pt is a thin delicate membrane, frequently forming folds and fringes which [project into the cavity of the joint; or, as in the knee, stretches across the cavity, forming a so-called synovial ligament. In these folds are often pads of fatty tissue, which fill up interstices, and form soft cushions between the contiguous bones. Sometimes these fringes become villous and pedunculated, and cause pain in move- ments of the joints. They contain fibro-fatty tissue, with an isolated cartilage cell lor two. The synovial membrane is well supplied with blood, especially near the margins of the articular cartilages and in the fringes. It secretes a thick glairy fluid like white of egg, called synovia, which lubricates the joint. Another variety of synovial membrane is seen in the bursae, which are interposed between various moving surfaces. In some instances bursae in the neighbourhood of a joint may communicate with the synovial cavity of that joint. THE VARIOUS KINDS OF ARTICULATIONS I There are three chief varieties of joints—viz., synarthrodial, or immovable ; I amphiarthrodial, or yielding ; and diarthrodial, or movable joints. I Synarthrosis is the term applied to all immovable joints in which the apposed I surfaces or edges of the bones are in direct contact, as in the face bones, except the mandible, and all those of the skull; or where bone and cartilage are in I immediate union, as in the case of the first rib and the sternum, and the costal cartilages and the ribs. The unions of the bones of the skull and face are usually called sutures, of which there are three chief varieties True sutures, where the edges of bones are firmly implanted into one another by means of projecting processes, as in the sagittal, lambdoid, and coronal sutures. False sutures, where the rough edges of the bones are in simple contact Avithout interlocking, as in the intermaxillary suture ; or where they overlap one another, as in the squamous suture. Grooved sutures, where the edge or plate of one bone is received into a cor- ; responding groove in the other, as in the rostrum of the sphenoid and vomer, or vomer and palatine processes of the maxillae, and the horizontal plates of the palate bones. Amphiarthrosis is the term applied to mixed joints which permit of slight movements, the opposed bony surfaces being firmly united by a plate or disc of fibro-cartilage. There is sometimes a partial synovial membrane. Examples are seen in the spine, sacro-iliac, and pubic joints. Diarthrosis is the term applied to all movable joints in which the bones have smooth cartilage-covered surfaces, lubricated by synovia, and bound together by more or less perfect capsules. This class is subdivided into the following varieties :— 1. Arthrodia.—A simple gliding joint formed by the apposition of two plane, or nearly plane, surfaces, which allow motion in one or more directions. The articular processes of the vertebra, the joints of the carpus and tarsus, carpo-metacarpal, tarso-metatarsal, and intermetacarpal and intermetatarsal joints are good examples.THE ARTICULATIONS 188 2. Ginglymus, or hinge-joint, where the ends of the bones are so adapted to each other as to allow motion in two directions, namely flexion and extension; the most perfect of them are the elbow and ankle. The knee has some gliding and rotatory motion, and is not a perfect hinge-joint, but ginglymo-arthrodial. 3. Enarthrodia, or ball-and-socket joint, where the enlarged head of one bone is received into a socket adapted to it on the other, as in the hip and shoulder joints. They are the most movable of all the joints, combining movements in all directions with axial rotation. 4. Trochoides, or pulley joints : this term is applied where either a pivot revolves in a ring, as in the superior radio-ulnar ; or the ring revolves about a pivot, as in the central atlanto-axoidean joint.

THE VAEIOUS MOVEMENTS OF JOINTS The movements which may take place at a joint are either gliding, angular, rotatory, or circumductory. The gliding motion is the simplest, and is common to all diarthrodial joints : it consists of a simple sliding of the apposed surfaces of the bones upon one another, without angular or rotatory motion. It is the only kind of motion permitted in the carpal and tarsal joints, and in those between the articular processes of the vertebrae. The angular motion is more elaborate, and increases or diminishes the angle between different parts. There are four varieties, viz.: flexion mid extension, which189 MOVEMENTS OF JOINTS bend or straighten the various joints, and take place in a forward and backward I direction (in a perfect hinge-joint this is the only motion permitted) ; and adduc- tion and abduction, which, except in the case of the fingers and toes, signifies an approach to, or deviation from, the centre line of the body. In the case of the hand, the line to or from which adduction and abduction are made is drawn through the middle finger, while in the foot it is through the second toe. Rotation is the revolution of a bone about its own axis without much change of position. It is only seen in enarthrodial and trochoidal joints. The knee permits of slight rotation, also, in certain positions, vdiich is a distinctive feature of this articulation. Circumduction is the movement compounded of the four angular movements in quick succession, by which the moving bone describes a cone, the proximal end of the bone forming the apex, while the distal end describes the base of the cone. It is seen in the hip and shoulder, as well as in the carpo-metacarpal joint of the thumb, which thus approximates to the ball-and-socket joint. In some situations where a variety of motion is required, strength, security, and celerity are obtained by the combination of two or more joints, each allowing a different class of action, as in the case of the wrist, the ankle, and the head with the spine. Many of the long muscles, which pass over two or more joints, act on all, so tending to co-ordinate their movements and enabling them to be produced with the least expenditure of power. Muscles also act as elastic ligaments to the joints ; and when acting as such, are diffusers and combiners, not producers of movement ; the short muscles producing the movement, the long diffusing it, and thus allowing the short muscles to act on more than one joint. Muscles are so disposed at their attachments near the joints as never to strain the ligaments by tending to pull the bones apart, but, on the contrary, they add to the security of the joint by bracing the bones firmly together during their action. The articulations may be divided for convenience of description into those : 1. of the Skull ; 2. of the Tbunk ; 3. of the Upper Limb ; and 4. of the Lower Limb. 1. THE ARTICULATIONS OF THE SKULL The articulations of the skull comprise (1) the temporo - mandibular; and (2) those betw^een the skull and first two vertebrae: namely (a) between the occiput and atlas; (b) between the atlas and axis ; and (c) the ligaments which connect the occiput and axis. The union of the atlas and axis is described in this section because, firstly, there is often a direct communication between the synovial cavity of the transverse axoidean and the occipito-atlantal joints ; secondly, the rotatory movements of the head take place around the odontoid process ; and, thirdly, important ligaments from the odontoid process pass over the atlas to the occiput. (1) THE TEMPOKO-MANDIBULAR AETICULATION Class.—Diarthrosis. Subdivision.—Ginglymo-Arthrodia. The parts entering into the formation of this joint are :—the anterior portion of the glenoid fossa and glenoid ridge (eminentia articularis) of the temporal bone above, and the condyle of the lower jaw below. Both are covered with articular cartilage,THE ARTICULATIONS 190 which is also extended over the front of the glenoid ridge to facilitate the play of ^,he interarticular cartilage. The ligaments which unite the bones are :— The capsular ligament is often described as consisting of four portions, which are, however, continuous with one another around the articulation. 1. The anterior portion consists of a few stray fibres connected with the anterior margin of the fibro-cartilage, and attached below to the anterior edge of the condyle, and above to the front of the glenoid ridge. Some fibres of insertion of the external pterygoid pass between them to be inserted into the margin of the fibro-cartilage. 2. The posterior portion is attached above, just in front of the Glaserian fissure, and is inserted into the back of the jaw just below its neck. 3. The external portion or external lateral ligament (fig. 192) is the strongest part of the capsule. It is broader above, w^here it is attached to the lower edge of the zygoma in nearly its whole length, as w^ell as to the tubercle at the point where the two roots of the zygoma meet. It is inclined downwards and backwards, to be inserted into the outer side of the neck of the condyle. Its fibres diminish! in obliquity and strength from before baclavards, those coming from the tubercle' being short and nearly straight. 4. The internal portion or short internal lateral ligament (fig. 193) consists of well-defined fibres, having a broad attachment, above to the outer side of the alar spine of the sphenoid and inner edge of the glenoid fossa; and below, a narrow insertion to the inner side of the neck of the condyle. Fatty and cellular tissue j separate it from the spheno-mandibular ligament which is internal to it. j The interarticular cartilage (fig. 194) is an oval plate interposed between and adapted to the two articular surfaces. It is thinner at the centre than at the circumference, and is thicker behind where it covers the thin bone at the bottom | of the glenoid fossa which separates it from the dura mater, than in front where it covers the glenoid ridge. Its inferior surface is concave and fits on to the condyle of the lower jaw ; while its superior surface is concavo-convex from before j backwards, and is in contact with the articular surface of the temporal bone. It j divides the joint into two separate synovial cavities, but is occasionally perforated! in the centre, and thus allows them to communicate. It is connected to the capsular ligament at the margins, and has some fibres of the external pterygoid muscle inserted into its anterior margin. There are usually two synovial membranes (fig. 194), the superior being the larger and looser, passing down from the margin of the articular surface above, to the upper surface of the interarticular cartilage below ; the lower and smaller one passes from the interarticular cartilage above to the condyle of the jaw below, extending somewhat further down behind than in front. When the interarticular cartilage is perforated, the two sacs communicate. The spheno-mandibular ligament (long internal lateral) (fig. 193) is a thin, loose band, situated some little distance from the joint. It is attached above to the alar spine of the sphenoid and contiguous part of the temporal bone, and is inserted into the mandibular spine of the low^er jaw. It covers the upper end of the mylo-hyoid groove, and is here pierced by the mylo-hyoid nerve. Its origin is a little internal to, and behind, but close to the origin of the short internaL lateral ligament. It is separated from the joint and ramus of the jaw by the external pterygoid muscle, internal maxillary artery and vein, the mandibular nerve and artery, and the middle meningeal artery. It is really the fibrous remnant of a part of the mandibular (Meckelian) bar. The stylo-mandibular ligament (stylo-maxillary) (figs. 192 and 193) is a process 1. Capsular. 2.

It separates the parotid from the submaxillary gland, land gives origin to some fibres of the stylo-glossus muscle.

I The nerves are derived from the masseteric and auriculo-temporal. I Movements.—The chief movement of this joint is of (i) a ginglymoid or hinge character, accompanied by a slight gliding action, as in opening or shutting theTHE ARTICULATIONS 192 mouth. In the opening movement the condyle turns hke a hinge on the fibro- cartilage, while at the same time the fibro-cartilage, together with the condyle, glides forward so as to rise upon the eminentia articularis ; the fibro-cartilage reaching as far as the anterior edge of the eminence, which is coated with articular cartilage to I receive it; but the condyle never reaches quite so far as the summit of the eminence. Should the condyle, however, by excessive movement (as in a convulsive yawn), glide over the summit, it slips into the zygomatic fossa, the mandible is dislocated, and the posterior portion of the capsule is torn. In the shutting movement the condyle revolves back again, and the fibro-cartilage glides back, carrying the condyle withi it. This combination of the hinge and gliding motions gives a tearing as well as' a cutting action to the incisor teeth, without any extra muscular exertion. ■ There is (ii) a horizontal gliding action in an antero-posterior direction, by^ which the lower teeth are thrust forwards and drawn back again : this takes place almost entirely in the upper compartment, because of the closer connection of thel Fig. 194.—Vertical Section through the Condyle of Jaw to show the Two Synovial Sacs and the Interarticular Fibro-cartilage. SECTION TH fibro-cartilage to the condyle than to the squamosal bone, and also because of the insertion of the external i^terygoid into both bone and cartilage. In these two sets' of movements the joints of both sides are simultaneously and similarly engaged. The third form of movement is called (iii) the oblique rotatory, and is that by which the grinding and chewing actions are performed. It consists in a rotation' of the condyle about the vertical axis of its neck in the lower compartment, whilei the cartilage glides obliquely forwards and inwards on one side, and backwards! and inwards on the other, upon the articular surface of the squamosal bones,' each side acting alternately. If the symphysis be simply moved from the centre to one side and back again, and not from side to side as in grinding, the condyle of that side moves round the vertical axis of its neck, and the opposite condyle and cartilage glide forwards and inwards upon the glenoid fossa. But in the^ ordinary grinding movement, one condyle advances and the other recedes, and then the first recedes while the other advances, slight rotation taking place in each; joint meanwhile. \ATLAS WITH OCCIPUT 103 0 2) THE LIGAMENTS AND JOINTS BETWEEN THE SKULL AND ■ SPINAL COLUMN, AND BETWEEN THE ATLAS AND AXIS (a) The Articulation of the Atlas with the Occiput Class.—Diarthrosis. Subdivision.—Ginglymo-Artliroclia. This articulation consists of a pair of joints symmetrically situated on either side of the middle line. The parts entering into their formation are the cup- shaped superior articular processes of the atlas, and the condyles of the occipital bone. They are united by the following ligaments :— The anterior occipito-atlantal ligament (fig. 195) is less than an inch (about 2 cm.) wide, and is composed of densely woven fibres, most of which radiate slightly outwards as they ascend from the front surface and upper margin of the rianterior arch of the atlas, to the anterior border of the foramen magnum ; it is continuous laterally with the capsular ligaments, the fibres of which overlap its : edges, and take an opposite direction inwards and upwards. The central fibres take a vertical course as they ascend from the anterior tubercle of the atlas to the pharyngeal tubercle on the occipital bone ; they are thicker than the lateral fibres, and are continuous below with the superficial part of the anterior atlanto-axoidean ligament, and through it with the anterior common ligament of the vertebral column. It is in relation, in front, with the recti capitis antici minores ; and behind, with the central odontoid or suspensory ligament. The posterior occipito-atlantal ligament (fig. 196) is broader, more membranous, and not so strong as the anterior. It extends from the posterior surface and upper border of the posterior arch of the atlas to the posterior margin of the foramen magnum from condyle to condyle ; being incomplete on either side for the passage of the vertebral artery into, and suhoccipital nerve out of, the canal. It is somewhat thickened in the middle line by fibres, which pass from the posterior I tubercle of the atlas to the lower end of the occipital crest. It is not tightly stretched between the bones, nor does it limit their movements ; it corresponds with the position of the ligamenta subflava, but has no elastic tissue in its composition. It is in relation in front with the dura mater, which is firmly attached to it; and behind with the recti caintis ])ostici minores, and enters into the floor of the suboccipital triangle. The capsular ligaments (figs. 195, 196) are very distinct and strongly marked, ; except on the inner side, where they are thin and formed only of short membranous fibres. They are lax, and do not add inuch to the security of the joint. In front, the I capsule descends upon the atlas, to be attached, some distance below the articular [ margin, to the front surface of the lateral mass, and to the base of the transverse I process ; these fibres take an oblique course upwards and inwards, overlapping the j anterior occipito-atlantal. At the sides and behind, the capsule is attached above [ to the margins of the occipital condyles; below, it skirts the inner edge of the I foramen for the vertebral artery, and behind is attached to the prominent tubercle I overhanging the groove for that vessel; these latter fibres are strengthened by a I band running obliquely upwards and inwards to the posterior margin of the foramen magnum. 1.

Two anterior oblique.THE ARTICULATIONS 194 The anterior oblique or lateral oceipito-atlantal ligament (fig. 195) is aiij accessory band which strengthens the capsule on the outer side. It is an oblique, thick band of fibres, sometimes quite separate and distinct from the rest, passing upwards and inwards from the upper surface of the transverse process beyond thel costo-vertebral foramen to the jugular process of the occipital bone. I The synovial membrane of these joints occasionally communicates with the| synovial sac between the odontoid process and the transverse ligament. | The arterial supply is derived from twigs of the vertebral, and occasionallj/j from twigs from the meningeal branches of the ascending pharyngeal. ! The nerve-supply comes from the anterior division of the suboccipital nerve. I Fig. 195.—x^nterior View of the Upper End of the Spine.

Almost the only movement permitted at these joints is of a gingiymoid character, producing flexion and extension upon a transverse axis drawn across the condyles at their slightly constricted parts. In flexion, the forehead and chin drop, and what is called the nodding move- ment is made ; in extension, the chin is thrown up and the forehead recedes. There is also a slight amount of gliding movement, either directly lateral, the outer edge of one condyle sinking a little within the outer edge of the socket of the195 ATLAS WITH OCCIPUT ,las and that of the opposite condyle projecting to a corresponding degree. The 3ad is thus tilted to one side, and it is even possible that the weight of the skull ay be borne almost entirely on one joint, the articular surfaces of the other being irown out of contact. Or the movement may be obliquely lateral, when the lower side of the head ill be a trifle in advance of the elevated side.

The bones that enter mto the formation of the lateral jomts are the mferioi articular processes of the atlas and the superior of the axis ; the central joint i> formed by the odontoid process articulating in front with the atlas, and behiiK with the transverse ligament. The ligaments which unite the axis and atlas are :— 1. The anterior atlanto-axoidean. 3. Two capsular (for lateral joints). 2. The posterior atlanto-axoidean. 4. The transverse ligament. 5. The atlanto-odontoid capsular ligament. The anterior atlanto-axoidean ligament (figs. 195, 196) is a narrow but strong membrane filling up the interval between the lateral joints. It is attached, above; to the front surface and lower border of the anterior arch of the atlas, and beW) to the transverse ridge on the front of the body of the axis. Its fibres are verticalj and are thickened in the median line by a dense band which is a continuatioil upwards of the anterior common ligament of the spine. i This prolongation is fixed above to the anterior tubercle of the atlas, where r becomes continuous with the central part of the anterior occipito-atlantal (fig 195); it is sometimes separated by an interval from the deeper ligament, and if often described as the superficial atlanto-axoidean ligament. It is in relation witl; the longus colli muscle. The posterior atlanto-axoidean ligament (fig. 195) is a deeper, but thinne] and looser membrane than the anterior. It extends from the posterior root of th( transverse process of one side to that of the other, projecting outwards beyond the posterior part of the capsules which are connected with it. It is attached abovi to the posterior surface and lower edge of the posterior arch of the atlas, and below to the superior edge of the laminje of the axis on their dorsal aspect. I is denser and stronger in the median line, and has a layer of elastic tissue orj its anterior surface like the ligamenta subflava, to which it corresponds ii' position. It is connected in front with the dura mater ; behind, it is in relatior with the inferior oblique muscles, and is perforated at each side by the secom cervical nerve. 1. The Lateral Atlanto-axoidean Joints are provided with short, liga mentous fibres, forming capsular ligaments (fig. 195), which completely sur, round the lateral articular facets. Outside the canal, they are attached som(j little distance from the articular margins, extending along the roots of th(| transverse processes of the axis nearly as far as the tips, but between the roots the;j skirt the inner edge of the costo-vertebral foramina. They are strengthened in froni and behind by the atlanto-axoidean ligaments. Internally each capsule is thinnerj and attached close to the articular margins, being strengthened behind by i strong band of slightly oblique fibres passing upwards along the outer edge of tbl cervico-basilar ligament from the body of the axis to the lateral mass of thJ atlas behind the transverse ligament; some of these fibres pass on, thickenin^i and blending with the occipito-atlantal capsule, getting inserted into the margin the foramen magnum. This band is sometimes called the accessory band (fig. 199)1 There is a synovial sac for each joint.BETWEEN ATLAS AND AXIS 197 2. The Centeal Atlanto-axoidean Joint, although usually described as one, composed of two articulations, which are quite separate from one another: an 'iterior between the odontoid process and the arch of the atlas, and a posterior ptween the odontoid process and the transverse ligament. The transverse ligament (figs. 196, 197, and 199) is one of the most important ructures in the body, for on its integrity our lives depend. It is a thick and 3ry strong band, as dense and closely woven as fibro-cartilage, about a quarter : an inch (6 mm.) deep at the sides, and somewhat more in the middle line, ttached at each end to a tubercle on the inner side of the lateral mass of the atlas, crosses the ring of this bone in a curved manner, so as to have the concavity )rward; thus dividing the ring into a smaller anterior portion for the odontoid recess, and a larger posterior part for the spinal cord and its membranes, and the 3inal accessory nerves. It is flattened from before backwards, being smooth in ■ont, and covered by synovial membrane to allow it to glide freely over the osterior facet of the odontoid process. Where it is attached to the atlas it is iiooth and well rounded off to provide an easy floor of communication between le transverso-odontoid and occipito-atlantal joints. Fig. 197.—Horizontal Section through the Lateral Masses of the Atlas AND the Top of the Odontoid Process. To its posterior surface is added, in the middle line, a strong fasciculus of vertical bres, passing upwards from the root of the odontoid process to the basilar border f the foramen magnum on its cranial aspect. Some of these fibres are derived :om the transverse portion. It gives the ligament a cruciform appearance ; hence is name, the crucial ligament (figs. 196, 199). The atlanto-odontoid capsular ligament (fig. 197) is a tough, loose membrane, 3mpletely surrounding the apposed articular surfaces of the atlas and odontoid rocess. At the odontoid process it blends above with the front of the check and antral occipito-odontoid ligaments, and arises also along the sides of the articular icet as far as the neck of the process ; the fibres are thick, and blend with the ipsules of the lateral joint. At the atlas they are attached to the non-articular art of the anterior arch in front of the tubercles for the transverse ligament, lending, above and below the borders of the bone, with the anterior occipito- tlantal and atlanto-axoidean ligaments, as well as with the inner portion of the Eipsular ligaments. It holds the axis to the anterior arch of the atlas after all le other ligaments have been divided. The synovial membranes (figs. 196, 197) are two in number:—one for the 3int between the odontoid process and atlas ; and another (transverso-odontoid) 3r that between the transverse ligament and the odontoid ; this last often com- lunicates with the occipito-atlantal. It is closed in by membranous tissueTHE ARTICULATIONS 198 between the borders of the transverse hgament and the margin of the facet oiij the odontoid, and is separated from the front sac by the atlanto-odontoid capsulaii Hgament. The arterial supply is from the vertebral artery, and the nerve-supply from the loop between the first and second cervical nerves. Movements.—The chief and characteristic movement at these joints is th( rotation, in a nearly horizontal plane, of the collar formed by the atlas and trans verse ligament, round the odontoid process as a pivot, which is extensive enougl to allow of an all-round view without twisting the trunk. Partly on account o; its ligamentous attachments, and partly on account of the shape of the articulai surfaces, the cranium must be carried with the atlas in these movements. Th( rotation is checked by the ligaments passing from the axis to the occiput (checl; ligaments), and also by the atlanto-axoidean. Owing to the fact that the facets of both atlas and axis, which enter into the formation of the lateral atlanto axoidean articulations, are convex from before backwards, and have the articulai cartilage thicker in the centre than at the circumference, the motion is not quitt horizontal but slightly curvilinear. In the erect position, with the face lookini directly forward, the most convex portions of the articular surfaces are alone ii contact, there being a considerable interval between the edges ; during rotation therefore, the prominent portions of the condyles of the atlas descend upon those of the axis, diminishing the space between the bones, slackening the ligaments and thus increasing the amount of rotation, without sacrificing the security of tb joint in the central position. Besides rotation, forward and backward movements and some lateral flexioi are permitted between the atlas and axis, even to a greater extent than in most o the other vertebral joints. (c) The Ligaments uniting the Occiput and Axis ' The following ligaments unite bones not in contact, and are to be seen from thj interior of the canal after removing the posterior arches of axis and atlas am; posterior ring of the foramen magnum :— j The occipito-cervical or cervico-basilar ligament (figs. 197,198 and 199) consist; of a very strong band of fibres, connected below to the upper part of the body oi the third vertebra and lower part of the body of the axis as far as the root of th odontoid process. It is narrow below, but widens out as it ascends, to be fastenei; to the basilar groove of the occiput. Laterally, it is connected with the accessoFi fibres of the atlanto-axoidean capsule. It is really only the upward prolongatio]i of the posterior common ligament, some of the fibres of which run on to th; occipital bone without touching the axis, thus giving rise to two strata. It is ii! relation in front with the crucial ligament. \ The crucial ligament has been already described (see page 197). | The lateral occipito-odontoid or check ligaments (fig. 196 and 199) are tw< strong rounded cords, which extend from the sides of the apex of the odontoi(; process, transversely outwards to the inner edge of the anterior portion of th'i occipital condyles. They are to be seen immediately above the upper border of th^ transverse ligament, which they cross obliquely owing to its forward curve at it attachments to the atlas. Some of their fibres occasionally run across the middLl line from one check ligament to the other. At the odontoid process they art 1. The occipito-cervical. 2. The crucial. 3.

The central odontoid or suspensory ligament (fig. 196 and 199) consists of a slender band of fibres ascending from the summit of the odontoid process to the j under surface of the occipital bone, close to the foramen magnum. It is best seen ! from the front, after removing the anterior occipito-atlantal ligament, or from behind by drawing aside the crucial ligament. The suspensory ligament is tightened by extension and relaxed by flexion or ' nodding ; the lateral odontoids not only limit the rotatory movements of the head | and atlas upon the axis, but by binding the occiput to the pivot, round which rotation occurs, they steady the head and prevent its undue lateral inclination upon the spine. By experiments, it has been proved that the head, when placed so that the orbits look a little upwards, is poised upon the occipital condyles in a line drawn a little in front of their middle ; the amount of elevation varies slightly in different i cases, but the balance is always to be obtained in the human body—it is one of ^ the characteristics of the human figure. It serves to maintain the head erect without undue muscular effort, or a strong ligamentum nuchas and prominent dorsal spines such as are seen in the lower animals. Disturb this balance, and let the muscles cease to act, the head will either drop forwards or backwards according as the centre of the gravity is in front or behind the balance line. The ligaments which pass over the odontoid process to the occiput are not quite tight when the head is erect, and only become so when the head is flexed ; if this w^ere not so, no flexion would be allowed; thus, muscular action, and not ligamentous tension, is employed to steady the head in the erect position. It is through the combination of the joints of the atlas and axis, and occiput and atlas (consisting of two pairs of joints placed symmetrically on either side of the median line, while through the median line there passes a pivot, also with a pair of joints) that the head enjoys such freedom and celerity of action, remarkable strength, and almost absolute security against violence, which could only be obtained by a ball-and-socket joint; but the ordinary ball-and-socket joints are too prone to dislocations by even moderate twists to be reliable enough when the life of the individual depends on the | perfection of the articulation : hence the importance of this combination of joints.

THE ARTICULATIONS OF THE VEETEBRAL COLUMN There are two distinct sets of articulations in the vertebral column :— {a) Those between the bodies and intervertebral discs which form amphi- arthrodial joints. [h] Those between the articular processes which form arthrodial joints. The ligaments which unite the various parts may also be divided into two jets, viz.—immediate, or those that bind together parts which are in contact; and ntermediate, or those that bind together parts which are not in contact.

The ligaments which unite the bodies of the vertebras are :— Intervertebral discs. Anterior common. Short lateral ligaments. Posterior common. Fig. 200.—Horizontal Section through an Intervertebral Disc AND THE corresponding EiBS, The intervertebral substances (figs. 196 and 200) are tough, but elastic and compressible discs of composite structure, which serve as the chief bond of union between the vertebrae. They are twenty-three in number, and are interposed between the bodies of all the vertebrge from the axis to the sacrum. Similar substances are found between the segments of the sacrum and coccyx, but they202 THE ABTICULATIONS undergo ossification at their surfaces and often throughout their whole extent. (See figs. 196 and 203.) | Each disc is composed of two portions—a circumferential laminar, and a' central pulpy portion ; the former tightly surrounds and braces in the latter, and forms somewhat more than half the disc. The laminar portion consists of alter-1 nating layers of fibrous tissue and fibro-cartilage ; the component fibres of which'] are firmly connected with two vertebrae, and pass obliquely down and to the right in one layer, and down and to the left in the next, making an X-shaped arrange- ment of the alternate layers. A few of the superficial lamellje project beyond the edges of the bodies, their fibres being connected with the edges of the anterior and lateral surfaces ; and some do not completely surround the rest, but terminate at the intervertebral foramina, so that on horizontal section the circumferential portion is seen to be thinner posteriorly. The more central lamellae are incomplete, Fig. 201. -The Anterior Common Ligament of the Spine, the Stellate, and THE Superior Costo-transverse Ligaments. The interartievilar ligament TJtie superior or anterior costo-transverse ligaments The stellate ligament less firm, and not so distinct as the rest ; and as they near the pulp they gradually! assume its characters, becoming more fibro-cartilaginous and less fibrous, and have cartilage cells in their structure. The central portion is situated somewhat behind the centre of the disc, forming a ball of very elastic and tightly compressed material, which bulges freely when the confining pressure of the laminar portion is removed by either horizontal or vertical section. Thus, it has a constant tendency to spring out of its confinement in the direction of least resistance, and thus constitutes a pivot round which the bodies of the vertebrae can twist, tilt, or inchne. It is yellowish in colour, and is composed of a fine fibrous matrix containing cartilage cells and fluid in its meshes. Together with the most central laminae, it is separated from immediate contact with the bone by a thin plate of articular cartilage. The central pulp of the inter- vertebral substance is the persistent part of the notochord. The intervertebral substances vary in shape with the bodies of the vertebra203 OF VEBTEBBAL COLUMN they unite, and are widest in area and also thickest in the lumbar region. In the cervical and lumbar regions they are thicker in front than behind, and cause the convexity forwards of the cervical, and increase that in the lumbar ; the curve in the thoracic region being almost entirely due to the shape of the bodies, is, however, somewhat increased by the discs. Without the discs the column loses a quarter of its length, and assumes a curve with the concavity forward, most marked a little below the mid-thoracic region. Such is the curve of old age, which is due to the shrinking and drying up of the intervertebral substances. The disc between the axis and third cervical is the thinnest of all; that between the fifth lumbar and sacrum is the thickest, and is much thicker in front than behind. The intervertebral discs are in relation, in front with the anterior common ligament; behind, with the Fig. 202.—Posterior Common Ligament of the Spine. (Thoracic region.) (Pedicles cut through, and posterior arches of vertebrae removed.) posterior ; laterally, with the short lateral; and in the thoracic region with the inter- articular and stellate ligaments. The anterior common ligament (figs. 195 and 201) commences as a narrow band attached to the under surface of the occipital bone in the median line, just in front of the occipito-atlantal ligament, of which it forms the thickened central portion. Attached firmly to the tubercle of the atlas, it passes down as the central portion of the atlanto-axoidean ligament, in the mid-line, to the front of the body of the axis. It now begins to widen out as it descends, until it is nearly two inches (5 cm.) wide in the lumbar region. Below, it is fixed to the upper segment of the sacrum, becoming lost in periosteum about the middle of that bone; but is again distinguishable in front of the sacro-coccygeal joint, as the anterior sacro-coccygeal ligament. Its structure is bright, pearly-white, and glistening with well-defined borders best marked in the thoracic region. It isTHE ARTICULATIONS 204 thickest in the thoracic region, and thicker in the lumbar than the cervical. It is firmly connected with the bodies of the vertebrae, and is composed of longitudinal fibres, of which the superficial extend over several, while the deeper pass over only two or three vertebrae. It is connected with the tendinous expansion of the prevertebral muscles in the cervical, and the crura of the diaphragm are closely attached to it in the lumbar region. The posterior common ligament (figs. 199, 202, 203, and 209) extends from the occipital bone to the coccyx. It is wider above than below, and commences by a broad attachment to the cranial surface of the basi-occipital. In the cervical region it is of nearly uniform width, and extends completely across the bodies of the vertebrae, upon which it rests quite flat. It does, how^ever, extend slightly further outwards on each side opposite the intervertebral discs. In the thoracic and lumbar regions it is distinctly dentated, being broader over the intervertebral Fig. 203.—Posterior Common Ligament. (Lumbar region.) -Median band -Expanded lateral portion substances and the edges of the bones, than over the middle of the bodies, where it is a narrow band stretched over the bones without resting on them, some areolar tissue and blood-vessels being interposed. The narrow median portion consists of longitudinal fibres, some of which are superficial and pass over several vertebrae ; and others are deeper, and extend only from one vertebra to the next but one below. The dentated or broader portions (fig. 203) are formed by oblique fibres which, springing from the bodies near the intervertebral foramina, take a curved course downwards and backwards over an intervertebral substance, and reach the narrow portion of the ligament on the centre of the vertebra next below; they then diverge to pass over another intervertebral disc to end on the body of the vertebra beyond, near the intervertebral notch. They thus pass over two discs and threeOF VERTEBBAL COLUMN 205 vertebrae. Deeper still are other fibres thickening these expansions of the common ligament, and extending from one bone to the next. The last well-marked expansion is situated between the first two segments of the sacrmn : below this, the ligament becomes a delicate central band with rudi- mentary expansions, being more pronounced again over the sacro-coccygeal joint, and losing itself in the ligamentous tissue at the back of the coccyx. The dura mater is tightly attached to it at the occipital bone and margin of the foramen magnum, but is separated from it in the rest of its extent by loose cellular tissue. The filum terminale becomes blended with it at the lower part of the sacrum and back of the coccyx. The lateral or short vertebral ligaments (fig. 201) consist of numerous short fibres situated between the anterior and posterior common ligaments, and passing from one vertebra over the intervertebral disc, to which it is firmly adherent, to the next vertebra below. The more superficial fibres are more or less vertical, but the deeper decussate and have a crucial arrangement. They are connected with the deep surface of the anterior common ligament, and so tie it to the edges of the bodies of the vertebrae and to the intervertebral discs. They blend behind with the expansions of the posterior common ligament, and so complete the casing round each amphiarthrodial joint. In the thoracic region they overlie the stellate ligament, and in the lumbar they radiate towards the transverse processes. In the cervical region they are less well marked. [h) The Ligaments connecting the Aeticulak Processes Class.—Diarthrosis. Subdivision.—Arthrodia. The capsular ligaments (fig. 195) w^hich unite these processes are com- posed partly of yellow elastic tissue, and partly of white fibrous tissue. In the cervical region only the inner side of the capsule is formed by the ligamenta subflava, which in the thoracic and lumbar regions, however, extend anteriorly to the margins of the intervertebral foramina. The part formed of white fibrous tissue consists of short, well-marked fibres, which in the cervical region pass obliquely downwards and forwards over the joint, between the articular processes and the posterior roots of the transverse processes of two contiguous vertebra. In the thoracic region the fibres are shorter, and vertical in direction, and are attached to the bases of the transverse processes ; in the lumbar, they are obliquely transverse. The capsular ligaments in the cervical region are the most lax, those in the lumbar region are rather tighter, and those in the thoracic region are the tightest. There is one synovial membrane to each capsule. (c) The Ligaments uniting the Lamina The ligamenta subflava (fig. 204) are shallow plates of closely-woven yellow elastic tissue, interposed between the laminse of two adjacent vertebrae. The first connects the axis with the third cervical, and the last the fifth lumbar with the sacrum. Each ligament extends from the inner and posterior edge of the inter- vertebral foramen on one side to a corresponding point on the other; above, it is attached close to the inner margin of the inferior articular process and to a well- marked ridge on the inner surface of the laminae as far as the root of the spine; below, it is fixed close to the inner margin of the superior articular process and to the dorsal aspect of the upper edge of the laminae. Each thus, besides filling up the interlaminar space, enters into the formation of two capsular ligaments ; they do so to a greater extent in the thoracic and lumbar regions than in the cervical, where the articular processes are placed wider apart. They are concave from side to206 THE ABTICULATIONS side, but convex from above downwards in front, making a more decided transverse curve than the arches between which they are placed. This concavity is more marked in the thoracic, and still more in the lumbar region than in the cervical, as the ligamenta subflava in the former region extend a short distance between the roots of the spinous process, blending with the interspinous ligament, and making Fig. 204.—Ligamenta Subflava in the Lumbar Eegion. a median sulcus when seen from the front; there is, however, no separation between the two parts. In the cervical region, where the spines are bifid, there is a median fissure which is filled up by fibro-areolar tissue. The ligaments are thickest and strongest in the lumbar region ; narrow but strong in the thoracic; thinner, broader, and more membranous in the cervical region. (d) The Ligaments connecting the Spinous Processes with one anothee (e) The Ligaments connecting the Transverse Processes with ONE another Supras])inous.—Intcrsinnous.—Intertransverse. The supraspinous ligament (fig. 205) extends all along the tips of the spines as a well-marked band of longitudinal fibres, from the spine of the seventh cervical vertebra to the coccyx, where it blends with the fibrous tissue on the back of that bone, covering in the lower end of the spinal canal, and adding to the security of the sacro-coccygeal joint. It is continuous at the sides with the aponeurotic structures of the back, and above with the ligamentum nuchse, beneath which a thin tendinous continuation of the supraspinous ligament is attached along the spines of the cervical vertebrae. It is thicker in the lumbar region than in the thoracic. Its deeper fibres pass over adjacent spines only, while the superficial overlie several.OF VEBTEBBAL COLUMN 207 The interspinous ligaments (fig. 205) are thin membranous structures which ixtend between the spines, and are connected with the hgamenta subflava in front, imd the supraspinous hgament behind. The fibres pass obhquely from the root )f one spine to the tip of the next; they thus decussate. They are best marked in he lumbar region, and are replaced by the well-developed intersjnnales muscles in ;he cervical region. The intertransverse ligaments are barely worth the name; in the thoracic •egion they form small rounded bundles, and in the lumbar they are thin mem- branous bands, quite incapable of action as bonds of union. They consist of fibres Dassing between the apices of the transverse processes. In the cervical region ihey are replaced by the iiitertransversales muscles. The arterial supply for the column comes from twigs of the vertebral, ascending pharyngeal, ascending cervical, superior and aortic intercostals, lumbar, ilio-lumbar, md lateral sacral. Fig. 205.—The Interspinous and Supraspinous Ligaments in the Lumbar Eegion. [ I The nerve-supply comes from the spinal nerves of each region. Movements.—The spinal column is so formed of a number of bones and inter- vertebral discs as to serve many purposes. It is the axis of the skeleton; upon 1 it the skull is supported ; and with it the cavities of the trunk, and the limbs are connected. As a fixed column it is capable of bearing great weight; and, [through the elastic intervertebral substances, of resisting and breaking the trans- mission of shocks. Moreover, it is flexible, and therefore capable of movement. Now, the range of movements of the column as a whole is very considerable; but the movements between any two vertebrje are slight, so that motions of the spine may take place without any change in the shape of the column, and without any marked disturbance in the relative positions of the vertebrae. It is about the pulpy ipart of the intervertebral discs, which form a central elastic pivot or ball, upon which the middle of the vertebrae rest, that these movements take place. The amount of motion is everywhere limited by the common vertebral The supraspinous ligament The interspinous ligament; I 1208 THE ABTICULATIONS ligaments, but it depends partly upon the width of the bodies of the vertebras, and partly upon the depth of the discs, so that in the loins, where the bodies are large and wide, and the discs very thick, free motion is permitted ; while, though the discs are thinner in the cervical region, yet, as the bodies are smaller, almost equally free motion is allowed. As the ball-like pulpy part of the intervertebral disc is the centre of movement of each vertebra, it is obvious that the motion would be of a rolling character in any direction but for the articular processes, which serve also to give steadiness to the column and to assist in bearing the superincumbent weight. Were it not for these processes, the column, instead of being a stationary one, endowed with the capacity of movement by muscular agency, would be a tottering one, requiring muscles to steady it. The influence of the articular processes in limiting the direction of inclination will appear from a study of the movements in the three regions of the spine. In the neck, the obliquity of the processes permits all movements, but is especially favourable for extension. Flexion is less free here than in the lumbar region, while extension is more so. Lateral fiexion is more free in the neck than in any other region. Rotatory movements are also free in the neck, especially' in the lower part. There is but slight movement of any sort between the axis and third cervical vertebra, owing to the shallow intervertebral disc and the great i prolongation of the anterior lip of the inferior surface of the body of the axis, ■ which checks forward flexion considerably. In the thoracic region, especially near its middle, antero-posterior flexion and extension are very slight; and, as the concavity of the curve here is forwards, the flat and nearly vertical surfaces of the articular processes prevent anything like sliding in a curvilinear manner of the one set of processes over the sharp upper edges of the other, which would be necessary for forward flexion. A fair amount i of lateral flexion would be permitted but for the impediment offered by the ribs;; while the slightly outward inclination of the superior process, and inward inclina-i tion of the inferior, allow a little rotation, which is freer in the upper than in the I lower part of the thoracic region. I In the lumbar region, extension and flexion are very free, especially between j the third and fourth, and fourth and fifth vertebrae, where the lumbar curve is j sharpest ; lateral inclination is also very free between these same vertebrae. It | has been stated that the shape and position of the articular processes of the lumbar: and the lower two or three dorsal are such as to prevent any rotation in these i regions; but, owing to the fact that the inferior articular processes are not tightly embraced by the superior, so that the two sets of articular processes are not in contact on both sides of the bodies at the same time, there is always some space in j which horizontal motion can occur round an axis drawn through the central part i of the bodies and intervertebral discs. Thus, the motions are most free in those i regions of the column which have a convex curve forwards, due to the shape of the \ intervertebral discs, where there are no bony walls surrounding solid viscera, where' the spinal canal is largest and its contents are less firmly attached, and where the i pedicles and articular processes are more nearly on a transverse level with the j backs of the bodies of the vertebrae ; Nor must the uses of the ligamenta subflava be forgotten : these useful little structures (1) complete the roofing-in of the spinal canal, and yet at the same time l permit an ever-changing variation in the width of the interlaminar spaces in flexion and extension; (2) they also restore the articulating surfaces to their normal posi-1 tion with regard to each other after movements of the column ; (3) and by forming ! the inner portion of each capsular ligament they take the place of muscle, in pre-] venting it from being nipped between the articular surfaces during movement.OF PELVIS WITH THE SPINE 209 j 2. THE ARTICULATIONS OF THE PELVIS WITH THE SPINE ' As in the intervertebral articulations, so in the union of the first portion of the acrum with the last lumbar vertebra, there are two sets of joints—viz. an amphi- lirthroclial one, between the bodies and intervertebral disc ; and a pair of arthrodial oints, between the articular processes. The union is effected by the following igaments, which are common to the spinal column :—(i) anterior, and (ii) posterior, iommon ; (iii) lateral or short vertebral; (iv) capsular ; (v) ligamentum subflavum ; vi) supra- and (vii) interspinous, ligaments ; and two special accessory ligaments )n either side, viz. (viii) sacro-lumbar ; and (ix) ilio-lumbar. The sacro-lumbar lig-ament (fig. 206) is strong, and triangular in shape. Its jipex is above and internal, being attached to the whole of the lower border and ' rent surface of the transverse process of the fifth lumbar vertebra, as well as to the ledicle and body. It is intimately blended with the ilio-lumbar ligame7it. Below, t has a wide fan-shaped attachment, extending from the edge of the ilio-lumbar igament forwards to the brim of the true pelvis ; blending with the periosteum on lihe base of the sacrum and in the iliac fossa, and with the superior sacro-iliac igament. By its sharp internal border it limits externally the foramen for the '.ast lumbar nerve. It is pierced by two large foramina, which transmit arteries to |jhe sacro-iliac synchrondrosis. The ilio-lumbar ligament (fig. 206) is a strong, dense, triangular ligament, which springs from the front surface of the transverse process of the fifth lumbar |\^ertebra as far as the body, by a strong fasciculus from the posterior surface of the process near the tip, and also from the front surface and lower edge of the transverse iprocess and pedicle of the fourth lumbar vertebra, as far inwards as the body. (Between these two vertebrae it is inseparable from the intertransverse ligament. |At its origin from the transverse process of the fifth lumbar vertebra, it is closely interwoven with the sacro-lumbar ligament, and some of its fibres spread down- > Iwards on to the body of the fifth vertebra, while others ascend to the disc above. At the pelvis it is attached to the inner lip of the crest of the ilium for about two inches (5 cm.). The highest fibres at the spine form the upper edge of the ligament at the pelvis, those which come from the posterior portion of the transverse process of the fifth lumbar vertebra forming the lower, while the fibres from the front of the same process pass nearly horizontally outwards. Near the spine the surfaces look directly backwards and forwards, but at the jilium, the ligament gets somewhat twisted, so that the posterior surface looks a little upwards, and the anterior looks a little downwards. 3 The anterior surface forms part of the posterior boundary of the false pelvis, [and overlies the upper part of the posterior sacro-iliac ligament; the posterior surface forms part of the floor of the spinal groove, and gives origin to the multifidus spiiice muscle. Of the borders, the upper is oblique, has the anterior lamella of the lumbar fascia attached to it, and gives origin to the quadratics lumborum ; the lower jis horizontal, and is adjacent to the upper edge of the sacro-lumbar ligament; while the inner is crescentic, and forms the outer boundary of a foramen through which ithe fourth lumbar nerve passes. j The arterial supply is very free, and comes from the last lumbar, ilio-lumbar, I and lateral sacral. The nerve-supply is from the sympathetic, as well as from twigs from the fourth and fifth lumbar nerves. Movements.—The angle formed by the sacrum with the spinal column is called Ithe sacro-vertebral angle. The pelvic inclination does not depend entirely upon ithis angle, but in great part upon the obliquity of the innominate bones to the I P210 ! THE ARTICULATIONS sacrum, so that in males in whom the average pelvic obliquity is a little greater, the average sacro-vertebral angle is considerably less than in females. The sacro-vertebral angle in the male shows that there is a greater and more sudden change in direction at the sacro-vertebral union than in the female. Apart of this change in direction is due to the greater thickness in the anterior part of the intervertebral substance between the last lumbar vertebra and the sacrum. Owing to the greater thickness of the intervertebral disc here than elsewhere, the movements permitted at this joint are very free, being freer than those between any two lumbar vertebrae. As the diameter of the two contiguous bones is less antero-posteriorly than laterally, the forward and backward motions are much freer than the lateral ones. The backward and forward motions take place Fig. 206.—Anterior View of the Pelvis. every time the sitting is exchanged for the standing position, and the standing for the sitting posture; in rising, the back is extended on the sacrum at the sacro- lumbar union ; in sitting down it is flexed. The articular processes provide for the gliding movement incidental to the extension, flexion, and lateral movements ; they also allow some horizontal move- ment, necessary for the rotation of the spine on the pelvis, or pelvis on the spine. The inferior articular processes of the fifth differ considerably from the inferioi processes in the rest of the lumbar vertebrae, and in direction they resemble some- what those of the cervical vertebra ; while the superior articular processes oi the sacrum differ in a similar degree from the superior processes of the lumbal vertebrae. This difference allows for the freer rotation which occurs at this joint.^1 OF THE PELVIS 211 The sacro-vertebral angle averages 117° in the male, and 130° in the female ; ^hile the pelvic inclination averages 155° in the male, and 150° in the female. 3. THE ARTICULATIONS OF THE PELVIS This group may again be subdivided into— {a) The sacro-iliac. (h) The sacro-coccygeal. (c) The intercoccy^eal. [d) The symphysis pubis. {a) The Sacro-iliac Synchrondrosis and Sacro-sciatic Ligaments Class.—AmpMar thro sis. Like the symphysis pubis, the sacro-iliac synchondrosis is an amphiarthrodial joint, but it differs from it in having an interosseous ligament as well as an interosseous, or symphysial, cartilage. The bones which enter into the joint are the sacrum and ilium, and they are bound together by the following ligaments :—- Anterior sacro-iliac. Superior sacro-iliac. Posterior sacro-iliac. Inferior sacro-iliac. Interosseous. The anterior sacro-iliac ligament (figs. 206, 207) consists of Avell-marked ghstening fibres which pass above into the superior, and below into the inferior, ligaments. It extends from the first three bones of the sEicrum to the ilium between the brim of the true pelvis and the great sacro-sciatic notch, blending with the periosteum of the sacrum and ilium as it passes away from the united edges of the bones. The superior sacro-iliac ligament (figs. 206, 207) extends across the upper margins of the joint, from the base of the sacrum to the iliac fossa, being well [marked along the brim of the pelvis, where it is thickened by some closely-packed fibres. Behind, it is far stronger, especially beneath the transverse process of the fifth lumbar vertebra. This ligament is connected with the strong sacro-lumbar ligament, which spreads outwards and forwards over the joint to reach the iliac fossa and ilio-pectineal line. The posterior sacro-iliac ligament is of very great strength, extending between the back of the sacrum and the posterior two inches of the iliac crest, including the posterior superior spine. Strengthening the upper and back part of this fibrous expansion are some strong bundles of ligamentous fibres, which extend more or less transversely from the inner surface of the iliac crest: (i) to the articular process of I the first sacral vertebra ; (ii) to the bone between the articular process and the first I sacral foramen; and (iii) to the articular tubercle of the second sacral vertebra, forming a ridge over the second sacral foramen under which the nerve passes ; an I oblique band often connects this last fasciculus with the articular process of the I first sacral vertebra. Below this, the fibres pass downwards and inwards from the I last inch of the iliac crest to the side of the sacrum external to the second and j third posterior sacral foramina. To the outer edge of this ligament is attached the j fascia covering the erector spinse muscle. The inferior sacro-iliac ligament (fig. 207) is covered behind by the upper end [ of the great sacro-sciatic ligament; it consists of strong fibres extending from the lateral border of the sacrum below the articular facet, to the posterior iliac spines ;THE ABTICULATIONS 212 some of the fibres are attached to the deep surface of the ihum and join the inter- osseous hgament. The interosseous ligament is the strongest of all, and consists of fibres of different lengths passing in various directions between the two bones. Immediately! above the interspinous notch of the ilium the fibres of this ligament are very strong, and form an open network, in the interstices of which is a quantity of fat in which the articular vessels ramify. The ear-shaped cartilaginous plate, which unites the bones firmly, is accuratelyj applied to the auricular surfaces of the sacrum and ilium. It is about one-twelfth of an| inch (2 mm.) thick in the centre, but becomes thinner towards the edges. Though closely adherent to the bones, it tears away from one entirely, or partially from both, on the application of violence, sometimes breaking irregularly so that the greater portion remains connected with one bone, leaving the other bone rough and bare. Fig. 207.—Vertical Antero-posterior Section of the Pelvis. It is really one mass, and is only occasionally formed of two plates with a synovia cavity between them : when this is the case the joint becomes an arthrodial one. The great or posterior sacro-sciatic ligament (figs. 206, 207 and 208) is attachec above to the posterior extremity of the crest of the ilium and the external aspect o the posterior ihac spines. From this attachment some of its fibres pass down wards and backwards to be attached to the outer borders and posterior surfaces o the lower three sacral vertebrae and upper two segments of the coccyx ; while others after passing for a certain distance backwards, curve forwards and downward: to the ischium forming the anterior free margin of the ligament v^here it limit! posteriorly the sacro-sciatic foramina. These fibres are joined by others which aris* from the posterior surface of the lower three sacral vertebrae and upper pieces of th( coccyx. At the ischium it is fixed to the inner border of the great tuberosity, an( sends a thin sharp process upwards along the ramus of the ischium which is calle(OF THE PELVIS 213 'le falciform process (fig. 208), and is a prolongation of the posterior edge of the gament. A great many fibres pass on directly into the tendon of the biceps luscle, so that traction on this muscle braces up the whole ligament, and the loccyx is thus made to move on the sacrum. The ligament may not unfairly be escribed as a tendinous expansion of the muscle, whereby its action is extended nd a more advantageous leverage given. It is thin and flat at its attached ends, ut narrow and thicker in the centre, looking like two triangular expansions joined ly a flat band, the larger triangle being at the ilium, and the smaller at the 5chium. The fibres of the ligament are twisted upon its axis at the narrow part, 0 that some of the superior fibres pass to the lower border. The posterior surface gives origin to the glutetis maximiis muscle, and on it amify the loops from the posterior branches of the sacral nerves ; its anterior surface 3 closely connected at its origin with the small sacro-sciatic ligament, and some Fig. 208.—Sacro-sciatic Ligaments. (Posterior view.) ■pbres of the j^yriformis muscle arise from it; below, the obturator internus passes out of the pelvis under its cover, and the internal pudic vessels and nerve pass in. At the .lium, its posterior edge is continuous with the vertebral aponeurosis ; while to the interior edge is attached the thick fascia covering the gluteus medius. The obturator fascia is attached to its falciform edge. It is pierced by the coccygeal branches of ihe sciatic, and a branch from the fourth sacral nerve. \ The small sacro-sciatic ligament (figs. 206, 207 and 208) is triangular and thin, springing by a broad base from the lateral border of the sacrum and coccyx, from the front of the sacrum both above and below the level of the fourth sacral foramen, iMid from the coccyx nearly as far as its tip. By its apex it is attached to the front surface and the borders of the ischial spine as far outw^ards as its base. Its fibres jdecussate so that the lower ones at the coccyx become the highest at the ischial spine; muscular fibres are often seen intermingled with the ligamentous. It is situated in front of the great sacro-sciatic ligament, with which it is closely214 THE ABTICULATIONS connected at the sacrum, and separates the greater from the lesser sacro-sciatic foramen. Its front surface gives attachment to the coccygeus muscle, which overlies it. Behind, it is connected with, and hidden by, the great sacro-sciatic ligament, so that only the outer inch (2 cm.) and a small part of its attachment to the coccyx, can be seen ; the internal ptidic nerve also passes over the posterior surface. The arterial supply comes from the gluteal, ilio-lumbar, and lateral sacral. The nerve-supply is from the superior gluteal, sacral plexus, and external twigs of the posterior divisions of the first and second sacral nerves. The movements.—It is quite clear, from the nature of the osseous surfaces, from the wedge-shape of the sacrum, and the manner in which it is locked in between the hip bones, as well as from the amphiarthrodial character of the articulation that there can be no movement at the sacro-iliac joint. While the joint serves the useful purpose of breaking shocks, the cartilage is too thin and too firmly fixed to the bones to allow even of appreciable yielding, such as occurs upon the inter vertebral discs. The double wedge-shape of the sacrum, with its broader surface at the base and in front, prevents dislocation from forces acting from above downwards, and from before backwards. The sinuous character of the opposed surfaces of the sacrum and ilium, the forward and inward direction of the fibres of the posterior sacro-sciatic ligament which pass from ilium to sacrum, as well as the ilio-lumbar and sacro-lumbar ligaments, prevent forward displacement of the base of the sacrum ; while the sacro-sciatic ligaments prevent the tilting backwards of its apex. Thus rotation forwards is entirely prevented. The shape of the sacrum prevents its downward displacement, while the weight of the spine and the ligaments, which fasten the sacrum to the ilium, are sufficient to check its upward displacement. The anterior and downward displacements of the sacrum are prevented by the interosseous and posterior sacro-sciatic ligaments, which pass from the ilia to the sacrum, and suspend the latter, acting somew^hat in the same manner as the chains of a suspension bridge. They also bind the two bones more tightly together : th greater the pressure, the tighter the union. The suspension bridge arrangement o the sacro-iliac synchondrosis is admirably adapted to give strength to the pelvis. (b) The Sacko-coccygeal Articulation Class.—Amphiar thro sis. The last piece of the sacrum and first piece of the coccyx enter into this union and are bound together by the following ligaments :— Anterior sacro-coccygeal. Supracornual. Posterior sacro-coccygeal. Intertransverse. Intervertebral substance. The intervertebral substance is a small oval disc, three-quarters of an inc (about 2 cm.) wide, and a little less from before backwards, closely connected with the surrounding ligaments. It resembles the other discs in structure, but; is softer and more jelly-like, though the laminse of the fibrous portion are well marked. The anterior sacro-coccygeal ligament is a prolongation of the glistening fibrous structure on the front of the sacrum. It is really the lower extremity of the anterior common ligament, which is thicker over this joint than over the central, part of either of the bones.215 OF THE SACRUM AND COCCYX The posterior sacro-coccygeal ligament (fig. 209) is a direct continuation of the Dstei'ior common ligament of the column, consisting of a narrow band of closely icked fibres, which become blended at the lower border of the first segment of the )ccyx with the filum terminale and supracornual ligament. The supracornual ligament (fig. 209) is the prolongation of the supraspinous, hich becomes inseparably blended with the aponeurosis of the erector spincB opposite 16 lamina of the third sacral vertebra, and is thus prolonged downwards upon the ack of the coccyx, passing over and roofing in the lower end of the spinal canal >here the laminae are deficient. The median fibres (the supraspinous ligament) xtend over the back of the coccyx to its tip, blending with the posterior sacro- occygeal ligament and filum terminale; the deeper fibres run across from the Fig. 209.—Ligaments connecting Sacrum and Coccyx posteriorly. luperfieial part of tne supraspinous r ligament, turned up Deep part of the supraspinous liga- ment, turned up Intertransverse ligament Lower end of the posterior com- mon ligament Supracornual ligament connecting the eornua of the sacrum and coccyx, cut and turned down stunted laminse on one side to the next below on the opposite side, and from the sacral eornua on one side to the coccygeal on the opposite, some passing between the two eornua of the same side, and bridging the aperture through which the fifth sacral nerve passes. Its posterior surface gives origin to the gluteus maxirims muscle. The intertransverse ligament (fig. 209) is merely a quantity of fibrous tissue I which passes from the transverse process of the coccyx to the laterhl edge of the sacrum below its angle. It is connected with the sacro-sciatic ligaments at their attachments, and the fifth sacral nerve escapes behind it. It is perforated by twigs from the lateral sacral artery and the coccygeal nerve. The arterial supply is from the lateral sacral and sacro-median arteries. The nerves come from the fourth and fifth sacral and coccygeal nerves. The movements permitted at this joint are of a simple forward and backward, or hinge-like character. In the act of defecation, the bone is pushed back by the216 THE ABTIGULATIONS faecal mass, and, in parturition, by the foetus ; but this backward movement is controlled by the upward and forward pull of the leA^ator ani and coccygeus. The external sphincter also tends to pull it forward. (c) Inteecoccygeal Joints The several segments of the coccyx are held together by the anterior and posterior common ligaments, which completely cover the bony nodules on their anterior and posterior aspects. Laterally, the sacro-sciatic ligaments, being attached to nearly the whole length of the coccyx, serve to connect them. Between the first and second pieces of the coccyx there is a very perfect amphiarthrodial joint, with a well-marked intervertebral substance. i {d) The Symphysis Pubis ' Class.—Amphiarthrosis. The bones entering into this joint are the pubic portions of the hip bones* This joint is shorter and broader in the female than in the male. The ligaments, which completely surround the articulation, are :— Superior. Anterior. i Inferior. Posterior. f Interosseous cartilage. The superior ligament (figs. 210 and 211) is a well-marked stratum of yellowish fibres which extends outwards along the crest of the pubes on each side, blending in the middle line with the interosseous cartilage. It is continuous in front with the deep transverse fibres of the anterior ligament, and behind with the posterior ligament. It gives origin to the rectus abdominis tendon. Fig. 210.—Anterior View of the Symphysis Pubis (Male), showing the Decussation OF THE Fibres of the Anterior Ligament. Superior pubie ligamen Inferior pubie ligament The posterior ligament (fig. 212) is slight, and, excepting above and below,! consists of little more than thickened periosteum. Near the upper part is a bandi of strong fibres, reaching the whole width of the pubic bones, and continuous withj the thickened periosteal fibres along the ilio-pectineal line. Below, many of thej upper and superficial fibres of the infrapubic ligament ascend over the back of the( joint, and interlace across the median line with fibres from the opposite side nearly j as high as the middle of the symphysis. •217 THE SYMPHYSIS PUBIS The anterior ligament (figs. 210 and 211) is thick and strong, and is closely connected with the fascial covering of the muscles arising from the body of the ipubes. It consists of several strata of thick decussating fibres of different degrees of obliquity, the superficial being the most oblique, and extending lowest over the joint. The most superficial descending fibres extend from the upper border of the pubis, cross others from the opposite side about the middle of the symphysis, and 1 Fig. 211.—Anterior View of the Symphysis Pubis (Female showing greater Width between the Bones). Superior pubie ligament are attached to the ramus of the opposite bone. The most superficial ascending fibres come from the infrapubic ligament, arch upwards, and decussate with other fibres across the middle line, and are lost on the opposite side beneath the descending set. There is another deeper set of descending fibres which arise below the angle, but do not descend so far as the superficial; and a deeper set of ascend- ing, which decussate, and reach higher than the superficial set, and are connected Fig. 212.—Posterior View of the Symphysis Pubis, showing the Backward Projection or the Symphysial Substance and the Decussation of the Fibres from the Inferior Pubic Ligament. with the infrapubic ligament. Some few transverse fibres pass from side to side, especially above and below the points of decussation. ! The inferior or infrapubic ligament (figs. 210, 211 and 212) is a thick, arch-like ' band of closely packed fibres which fills up the angle between the pubic rami, and forms a smooth, rounded summit to the pubic arch. On section, it is yellowish in colour and three-eighths of an inch (1 cm.) thick in the middle line ; it is i i218 THE ARTICULATIONS j j inseparably connected with the interosseous cartilage. Both on the front and back aspects of the joint it gives off decussating fibres, which, by their interlacement over the anterior and posterior ligaments of the symphysis, add very materially to its security. In fact, the ligament may be said to split superiorly into two layers, one passing over the front, and the other over the back of the articulation. It is sometimes known as the ligamentum arcuatum. The interosseous cartilage varies in thickness in different subjects, but is thicker in the female than in the male. It is thicker in front than behind, and projects beyond the edges of the bones, especially posteriorly (see fig. 212), blending intimately with the ligaments at its margins. It is sometimes uninterruptedly woven throughout, but at others has an elongated narrow fissure, partially dividing the cartilage into two plates, with a little fluid in the interspace (fig. 213). This is situated towards the upper and posterior aspects, but does not reach to either, and usually extends about half the length of the cartilage. The interosseous cartilage is intimately adherent to the rough osseous surface of the bone, which is ridged to give it a firmer attachment; and, on forcing the bones apart, it does not usually split into two plates, but is torn from the bone on one side or the other. Fig. 213.—Section op Symphysis to show the Synovial Cavity. The arterial supply is from twigs of the internal pudic, pubic branches of the obturator and epigastric, and ascending branches of the internal circumflex and superficial external pudic. The nerve-supply has not been satisfactorily made out. The movements amount only to a slight yielding of the cartilage; neither muscular force nor extrinsic forces produce any appreciable movement in the ordinary condition. Occasionally, as the result of child-bearing, the joint becomes unnaturally loose, and then walking and standing are painfully unsteady. It is known that, during pregnancy and parturition, the symphysial cartilage becomes softer and more vascular, so as to permit the temporary enlargement of the pelvis; but it must be remembered that the fibres of the oblique muscles decussate, and thus, during labour, while they force the head of the foetus down, they strengthen the joint by bracing the bones more tightly together. 4. THE ARTICULATIONS OF THE RIBS WITH THE VERTEBRAE These consist of two sets, viz.:— {a) The eosto-central: i.e. the articulation of the head of the rib with the vertebrae. {h) The costo-transverse, or the articulation of the tubercle (of each of theOF THE BIBS WITH VEBTEBBjE 219 irst ten ribs) with the transverse process of the lower of the two vertebrae, with A^hich the head of the rib articulates : i.e. the one bearing its own number, as )he first rib with the first thoracic vertebra, the second rib with tlie second jhoracic vertebra, and so on. [a) The Costo-centbal Aeticulation Class.—Diartlirosis. Subdivision.—Ginglymo-Arthrodia. It is a very perfect joint, into tire formation of which the head of the rib and Itwo vertebra, with the intervertebral disc between them, enter. In the case of the first, tenth, eleventh, and twelfth ribs, it is formed by the head of the rib articulating with a single vertebra. The ligaments are :— Capsular. Interarticular. Stellate or anterior costo-central. The capsular ligament (fig. 214) consists of short, strong, woolly fibres, com- pletely surrounding the joint, which are attached to the bones and intervertebral substances, a little beyond their articular margins. At its upper part it reaches through the intervertebral foramen towards the back of the bodies of the vertebrae, Fig. 214.—The Capsular Ligaments of the Costo-vertebral Joints. Spinous process of seventh, cervical vertebra Capsular ligament of the first costo- transverse joint Capsular ligament of first costo-eentral joint FIRST RIB being strengthened here by fibres which at intervals connect the anterior with the posterior common ligaments. The lower fibres extend downwards nearly to the demi-facet of the rib below; behind, it is continuous with the middle costo- transverse ligament, and in front is overlaid by the stellate. The interarticular ligament (fig. 215) consists of short, strong fibres, closely interwoven with the outermost ring of the intervertebral disc, and attached to the transverse ridge separating the articular facets on the head of the rib. It com- pletely divides the articulations into two parts, but does not brace the rib tightly to the spine, being loose enough to allow a moderate amount of rotation on its own axis. There is no interarticular ligament in the costo-vertebral joints of the first, tenth, eleventh, and twelfth ribs. The anterior costo-central or stellate ligament (figs. 215 and 216) is the most striking of all, and consists of bright, pearly-white fibres attached to the anterior220 THE ABTIGULATIONS surface, and upper and lower borders of the neck of the rib, a Httle way beyond the articular facet ; from this they radiate upwards, forwards, and downwards, so as to form a continuous layer of distinct and sharply defined fibres. The Fig. 215.—Showing the Anterior Common Ligament of the Spine, and the Connection of the Kibs with the Vertebra. Fig. 216.—Horizontal Section through the Intervertebral Disc and Eibs. middle fibres run straight forward to be attached to the intervertebral disc; th upper ascend to the lower half of the lateral surface of the vertebra above, an the lower descend to the upper half of the vertebra below.221 OF THE BIBS WITH VEBTEBB^ The stellate ligament is overlapped at the spine by the short vertebral ligaments. In the case of the first, tenth, eleventh, and twelfth ribs, which articulate with i)ne vertebra, the ligament is not quite so distinctly stellate, but even in these the 'ascending fibres reach the vertebra above that with which the rib articulates. The synovial membranes (fig. 216) consist of two closed sacs which do not jommunicate : one above, and the other below the interarticular ligament. In ,he case of the first, tenth, eleventh, and twelfth articulations, there is but one Synovial membrane, as these joints have no interarticular ligament. The arterial supply is from the intercostal arteries, the twigs piercing the ;tellate and capsular ligaments. The nerve-supply comes from the anterior primary branches of the intercostal lerves. The movements are ginglymoid in character, and limited to a slight degree of elevation and depression around an obliquely horizontal axis corresponding with tjhe interarticular ligament; there is also a slight amount of forward and backward sliding, and occasionally a slight degree of screwing or rotatory movement. There IS a considerable difference in the degree of mobility of the different ribs, for while the first rib is almost immobile except in a very deep inspiration, the mobility of 'the others increases from the second to the last; the two floating ribs being the Qiost mobile of all. The head of the rib is the most fixed point of the costal arch, md upon it the whole arch rotates ; the interarticular ligament allows only a very limited amount of flexion and extension (i.e. elevation and depression), and of gliding. Gliding is checked by the stellate ligament. In inspiration, the rib is elevated, and glides forwards in its socket, too great elevation being checked not only by the ligaments, but also by the overhanging upper edge of the cavity itself. In expiration, the rib is depressed, and glides back in its cavity. {h) The Costo-transveese Articulation Class.—Diarthrosis. Subdivision.—Arthrodia. This joint is formed by the tubercle of the rib articulating with the anterior part of the tip of the transverse process. The eleventh and twelfth ribs are devoid of these joints, for the tubercles of these ribs are absent, and the transverse iprocesses of the eleventh and twelfth thoracic vertebrae are rudimentary. I The ligaments of the union are :—■ Capsular. Superior costo-transverse. Middle costo-transverse. Posterior costo-transverse. \\ The capsular ligament (figs. 214 and 216) forms a thin, loose, fibrous 'envelope to the synovial membrane. Its fibres are attached to the bones just beyond the articular margins, and are thickest below, where they are not strengthened i by any other structure. They are connected on the inner side with the middle, above with the superior, and on the outer side with the posterior costo-transverse [ligaments. The eleventh and twelfth ribs are unprovided with a capsule. The middle costo-transverse, or interosseous ligament (fig. 216), consists of short fibres passing between the back of the neck of the rib and front of the transverse process, with which the tubercle articulates. It extends from the capsule of the central costo-vertebral joint to that of the costo-transverse. It is best seen on horizontal section through the bones. In the eleventh and twelfth ribs this ligament is rudimentary. The posterior costo-transverse ligament (fig. 216) is a short but thick, strong, and broad ligament, which extends outwards and upwards from the extremity, ofTHE ABTICULATIONS 222 the transverse process to the non-articular surface of the tubercle of the correspond- ^ ing rib. The eleventh and twelfth ribs have no posterior ligament. ! The superior costo-transverse ligament (fig. 215) is a strong, broad band of| fibres which ascends outwards from the crest on the upper border of the neck of I the rib, to the lower border of the transverse process above. .A few scattered' posterior fibres pass upwards and inwards from the neck to the transverse process. It is best seen from the front. Its inner border bounds the foramen through which the posterior branches of the intercostal vessels and nerves pass. To the external border is attached the thin aponeurosis covering the external inter- \ costals. Its anterior surface is in relation with the intercostal "vessels and nerve;! the posterior with the longissimus dorsi. The first rib has no superior costo-! transverse ligament. The synovial membrane (fig. 216) is a single sac. ' The arterial and nerve supplies come from the posterior branches of the inter- i costal arteries and nerves. The movements which take place at these joints are limited to a gliding of the tubercle of the rib upon the transverse process. The exact position of the facet on' the transverse process varies slightly from above dowuAvards, being placed higher on the processes of the lower vertebra. The plane of movement in most of the costo-transverse joints is inclined upwards and backwards in inspiration, and downwards and forwards in expiration. The point round which these movements occur is the head of the rib, so that the tubercle of the rib glides upon the transverse process in the circumference of a circle, the centre of which is at the costo-central joint. 5. THE ARTICULATIONS AT THE FRONT OF THE THORAX These may be divided into four sets, viz. :— {a) The chondro-sternal articulations, or the junction of the costal cartilages with the sternum. (h) The costo-chondral joints, or the union of the ribs with their costal cartilages. (c) The intersternal joints, or the union of the several parts of the sternum with one another. [d] The interchondral joints, or the union of five costal cartilages (sixth, seventh, eighth, ninth, and tenth) with one another. {a) The Chondeo-steenal Aeticulations Class.—Diarthrosis, Subdivision.—(rm^Z^/wms. | These articulations are between the lateral borders of the sternum and the ends of the costal cartilages. The union of the first rib with the sternum is synar thro dial, and therefore forms an exception to the others. From the second to the seventh inclusive, the articulations have the following ligaments,, which together form a complete capsule:— Anterior chondro-sternal. Superior chondro-sternal. Posterior chondro-sternal. Inferior chondro-sternal. The anterior chondro-sternal ligament (fig. 217) is a triangular band of strong fibres which cover the inner half-inch of the front of the costal cartilage, and radiate upwards and downwards upon the front of the sternum. Some of the fibres decussate across the middle line with fibres of the opposite ligament.223 OF THE STERNUM At its upper and lower borders it is in contact with the superior and inferior I ligaments respectively. I The posterior chondro-sternal ligament consists of little more than a thickening (of the fibrous envelopes of the bone and cartilage, the joint being completed behind by a continuity of perichondrium with periosteum. i Fig. 217.—The Sternum. (Left side, showing ligaments; right side, the synovial cavities.) The superiof and inferior ligaments are strong, well-marked bands, which pass from the upper and lower borders of the costal cartilage to the lateral edges of the sternum respectively. The sixth and seventh cartilages are so close that the superior ligament of the seventh is blended with the inferior of the sixth rib.THE ABTICULATIONS 224 Deeper than the fibres of these Hgaments are short fibres passmg from the margins of the sternal facets to the edges of the facets on the cartilages ; they are most distmct m the front and lower part of the joint, and may encroach so much upon the synovial cavity as to reduce it to a very small size, or almost obliterate it. This occurs mostly in the case of the sixth and seventh joints, especially the latter. The interarticular ligament (fig. 217) is by no means constant, but is usually present in the second joint on one, if not on both sides of the same subject. It consists of a strong transverse bundle of fibres passing from the ridge on the facet on the cartilage to the symphysial substance between the manubrium and body ; sometimes the upper part of the synovial cavity is partially or entirely obliterated by short, fine, ligamentous fibres. The chondro-xiphoid lig^ament (fig. 217) is a strong flat band of fibres passing obliquely upwards and outwards from the front surface of the xiphoid cartilage to the anterior surface of the sternal end of the seventh costal cartilage, and most frequently to that of the sixth also. Synovial membranes.—The union of the first cartilage with the sternum being synarthrodial, it has no synovial membrane ; the second has usually two, separated by the interarticular ligament. The rest usually have one synovial membrane, which may occasionally be subdivided into two (fig. 217). The arterial supply is derived from perforating branches of the internal mammary ; and the nerves come from the anterior branches of the intercostals. Movements.—Excepting the first, the chondro-sternal joints are ginglymoid, but the motion of which they are capable is very limited. It consists of a hinge- like action in two directions : first, there is a small amount of elevation and depression which takes place round a transverse axis; and, secondly, there is some forward and backward movement round an obliquely vertical axis. In inspira- tion the cartilage is elevated, and the lowest part of its articular facet is pressed into the sternal socket, and the sternum is thrust forwards so that the upper and front edges of the articular cartilages separate a little ; in expiration the reverse movement takes place. Thus the two extremities of the costal arches move in their respective sockets in opposite directions. This difterence results necessarily from the fact that the costal arch moves upon the vertebral column, and, having been elevated, it in its turn elevates the sternum by pushing it upwards and forwards. AVere this not the case, the sternum would be depressed by the elevation of the costal arches. The chondro-xiphoid ligament tends to prevent the xiphoid cartilage being drawn backwards by the action of the diaphragm. (h) The Costo-chondeal Joints Class.—Synarthros is. The extremity of the costal cartilage is received into a cup-shaped depression at the end of the rib, which is somewhat larger than the cartilage. The two are joined together by the continuity of the investing membranes, the periosteum of the rib being continuous with the perichondrium of the cartilage, much in the same way as the epiphyses of the bones are joined to their shafts. (c) The Union of the Segments of the Steenum with one anothee The union of the manubrium with the gladiolus may be either an amphi- arthrodial or diarthrodial joint. In a certain number of cases there is a true amphiarthrodial joint, with true fibro-cartilage (fig. 217) between the bones. In other cases each segment of bone is tipped with cartilage as in diarthrodial joints.i OF THE STEBNUM 225 The ligaments which connect them are really periosteum thickened by longi- jLidinal fibres, and also the radiating fibres from the chondro-sternal ligaments. ]he anterior is much stronger than the posterior. The gladiolus is joined to the xiphoid cartilage by a thick investing membrane, y anterior and posterior longitudinal fibres, and by radiating fibres of the sixth nd seventh chondro - sternal ligaments. The chondro - xiphoid ligament also pnnects the xiphoid with the anterior surface of the sixth and seventh costal . artilages, and thus indirectly with the gladiolus; and some fine fibro-areolar issue also connects the xiphoid with the back of the seventh costal cartilage. I The junction of the xiphoid with the sternum is on a level somewhat posterior p the junction of the seventh costal cartilage with the sternum. The union is hjnarthrodial. (d) The Inteechondbal Articulations Class.—Diarthrosis. Subdivision.—Arthrodia. \ A little in front of the point where the costal cartilages bend upwards towards me median line, the sixth is united with the seventh, the seventh with the eighth, phe eighth with the ninth, and the ninth with the tenth. At this point, each of the cartilages from the sixth to the ninth inclusive is ieeper than elsewhere, owing to the projection downwards from its lower edge of a jbroad blunt process, which comes into contact with the cartilage next below. lEach of the apposed surfaces is smooth, and they are connected at their margins iby ligamentous tissue, which forms a complete capsule for the articulation, and is jlined by a synovial membrane. The largest of these cavities is between the seventh and eighth; those between the eighth and ninth, and ninth and tenth, are smaller, and are not free to play upon each other in the whole of their extent, being held together by ligamentous tissue at their anterior margins. Sometimes this fibrous tissue completely obliterates the synovial cavity. I The arteries are derived from the musculo-phrenic, and the nerves from the • intercostals. i Movements.—By means of the costal cartilages and interchondral joints, strength with elasticity is given to the wall of the trunk at a part where the cartilages are the only firm structures in its composition ; while a slight gliding movement is permitted between the costal cartilages themselves, which takes place round an axis corresponding to the long axes of the cartilages. By this means, the outward projection of the lower part of the thoracic wall is increased iby deep inspiration. MOVEMENTS OF THE THOEAX AS A "WHOLE Before describing these movements as a whole, it^must be premised that there I are some few modifications in the movements of certain ribs resulting from their jshape. Thus the first rib (and to a less extent the second also), which is flat on I its upper and under surfaces, revolves on a transverse axis drawn through the costo-vertebral and costotransverse joints. During inspiration and expiration, the [anterior extremities of the first pair of costal arches play up and down, the tubercles and the heads of the ribs acting in a hinge-like manner, the latter having also a slight screwing motion. By this movement the anterior ends of the costal arches are simply raised or depressed, and the sternum pushed a little for- : wards: it may be likened to the movement of a pump-handle, as in fig. 218, a, b. ' I The movements of the other ribs, particularly in the mid-region of the thorax, are more complex, for, besides the elevation of the anterior extremities, the bodies Q226 THE ABTICULATIONS and angles of the ribs rise nearly as mucti as the extremities themselves. In this movement the tubercles of the ribs glide upwards and backwards in inspiration, and downwards and forwards in expiration ; and the movement may be likened to that of a bucket handle, as in fig. 218, A, B. During inspiration, the cavity of the thorax is increased in every direction,! The antero-posterior diameter is increased by the thrusting forwards of the sternum, caused by the elevation of the costal cartilages and fore part of the ribs; whereby they are brought to nearly the same level as the heads of the ribs. The transverse diameter is increased : (i) Behind, by the elevation of the middle part oi the ribs ; for when at rest the mid-part of the rib is on a lower level than eithei the costo-vertebral or chondro-sternal articulations. Owing to this obliquity th( transverse diameter is increased when the rib is raised, and the increase k proportionate to the degree of obliquity, (ii) By the eversion of the lower bordei of the costal arch, which rolls outwards as the arch is raised, (iii) The transversa diameter is increased in front by the abduction of the anterior extremity of tht rib at the same time as it is elevated and thrust forwards. The increase in the vertical diameter of the thorax is due to the elevation o| the ribs, especially the upper ones, and the consequent widening of the intercostal spaces ; but the chief increase in this direction is due to the descent of tht; diaphragm. ■ The greatest increase both in the antero-posterior and transverse diameter^ takes place where the ribs are longest, most oblique, and most curved at theii angles, and where the bulkiest part of the lung is enclosed. This is on a level witl! the sixth, seventh, and eighth ribs. ; At the lower part of the thorax, where the ribs have no relation to the lungfi and do not affect respiration directly by their movements, it is important thaj the costal arches should be thrown well outwards in order to counteract th, compression of the abdominal viscera by the contraction of the diaphragm. | By widening the lower part of the thorax during inspiration, the origin of th' muscular fibres of the diaphragm is widened, and their power is increased.

The sterno-clavicular. 2. The scapulo-clavicular union. 3. The shoulder joint. I 4. The elbow joint. 5. The radio-ulnar union. I 6. The radio-carpal or wrist joint. 7. The carpal joints. 8. The carpo-metacarpal joints, j 9. The intermetacarpal joints. 10. The metacarpo-phalang^eal joints. 11. The interphalangeal joints. 1. THE STEKNO-CLAVICULAE ARTICULATION Class.—Diarthrosis. Subdivision.—Arthrodia. At this joint the large inner end of the clavicle is united to the superior angle if the manubrium sterni, the first costal cartilage also assisting to support the lavicle. It is the only joint between the upper extremity and the trunk, and takes )art in all the movements of the upper limb. Looking at the bones, one would ay that they were in no way adapted to articulate with one another, and yet they .ssist in constructing a joint of great security, strength, and importance. The )ones are nowhere in actual contact, being completely separated by an inter- zticular cartilage. The interval between the joints of the two sides varies from me inch to an inch and a half (2-5-4 cm.). The ligaments of this joint are :— (1) Capsular. (3) Interarticular fibro-cartilage. (2) Interclavicular. (4) Rhomboid or costo-clavicular. The capsular ligament (figs. 219-220) consists of fibres, having varying direc- :ions and being of various strength and thickness, which completely surround the articulation, and are firmly connected with the edges of the interarticular fibro- iartilage. The fibres at the back of the joint, sometimes styled the posterior terno-clavicular ligament, are stronger than those in front or below, and consist if two sets : a superficial, passing upwards and outwards from the manubrium iterni, to the projecting posterior edge of the inner end of the clavicle, a few being Drolonged onwards upon the posterior surface of the bone. A deeper set of ibres, especially thick and numerous below the clavicle, which connect the inter- ^brticular cartilage with the clavicle and with the sternum, but do not extend from )ne bone to the other. The fibres in front, the anterior sterno-clavicular ligament, bre well marked, but more lax and less tough than the posterior, and are overlaid )y the tendinous sternal origin of the sterno-mastoid, the fibres of which run ;)arallel to those of the ligament. They extend obliquely upwards and outwards irom the margin of the sternal facet to the anterior surface of the clavicle some ittle distance from the articular margin. The fibres which cover in the joint )elow are short, woolly, and consist more of fibro-areolar tissue than true fibrous tissue; they extend from the upper border of the first costal cartilage to the lower )order of the clavicle just external to the articular margin, and fill up the gap petween it and the rhomboid ligament. The superior portion consists of short i i230 THE ABTICULATIONS occur between the clavicle and the fibro-cartilage; during elevation of the arm, the upper edge of the clavicle with its attached fibro-cartilage is pressed into the sternal socket, and the lower edge glides away from the cartilage; during de- pression of the limb, the lower edge of the clavicle presses on to the cartilage, while the rest of the articular surface of the clavicle inclines outwards, bringing with it to a slight degree the upper edge of the fibro-cartilage. These movements occur on an antero-posterior axis drawn through the outer compartment of the joint. The forward and backward motions take place between the cartilage and sternum, the clavicle with the cartilage rolling backwards upon the sternum when the shoulder is brought forwards, and forwards when the shoulder is forced back- wards ; these movements occur round an axis drawn nearly vertically through the sternal socket. The interarticular cartilage serves materially to bind the bones together, and to prevent the inward and upward displacements of the clavicle. It also forms an' elastic buffer which tends to break shocks. The capsule, by being moderately! tight, tends to limit movements in all directions, while the interclavicular ligamentj is a safeguard against upward displacement during depression of the arm. The! rhomboid ligament prevents dislocation upwards during elevation of the arm, and! resists displacements backwards. | 2. THE SCAPULO-CLAVICULAR UNION The scapula is connected with the clavicle by a synovial joint with ita ligaments ; and also by a set of ligaments passing between the coracoid processj and the clavicle. So that we have to consider— (a) The acromio-clavicular articulation. (h) The coraco-clavicular ligaments. 1 (c) The proper scapular ligaments are also best described in this section—viz.! the coraco-acromial and transverse. {a) The Aceomio-claviculae Joint Class.—Diarthrosis. Subdivision.—Arthrodia. The acromio-clavicular joint frequently contains an interarticular fibro-carti'^ lage, and is surrounded by a capsular ligament. ; The capsular ligament (figs. 223 and 226) completely surrounds the articular margins, and is composed of strong, coarse fibres arranged in parallel fasciculi, of fairly uniform thickness, which are attached to the borders as well as the surfaces oi the bones. It is somewhat lax in all positions of the joint, so that the clavicle is not tightly braced to the acromion. The fibres extend three-quarters of an inch (2 cm.) along the clavicle posteriorly, but only a quarter of an inch (6 mm.) anteriorly. Superiorly, they are attached to an oblique line joining these two points, while inferiorly the}^ reach to the ridge for the trapezoid ligament with' which they blend. At the acromion they extend half way across the upper and lower surfaces, but at the anterior and posterior borders of that process they arei attached close to the articular facet. The anterior fibres become blended withl the insertion of the coraco-acromial ligament. The fibres are strengthened abovej by the aponeuroses of the trapezius and deltoid muscles; and all run from the' acromion to the clavicle inwards and backwards. The interarticular fibro-cartilage is occasionally present, but is usually im-,, perfect, only occupying the upper part of the joint; it may completely divide the] joint into two cavities, or be perforated in the centre. It is usually thicker at the231 THE SCAPULO-CLAVICULAB 3dge than at the centre, and some of the fibres of the capsular ligament are blended vvith its edges. The synovial membrane lining the joint is occasionally either partially or jntirely divided into two by an interarticular fibro-cartilage. {h) The Coraco-claviculae Union The coraco-clavieular ligament (figs. 222, 223, 226) consists of two parts, the conoid and trapezoid ligaments. The conoid ligament is the internal and posterior portion, and passes upwards and outwards from the coracoid process to the clavicle. It is a very strong and coarsely fasciculated band of triangular shape, the apex being fixed to the inner Fig. 222.—Anterior View of Shoulder, showing also Coraco-clavicular and coraco-acromial ligaments. Conoid ligament and posterior edge of the root of the coracoid process just in front of the supra- scapular notch, some fibres joining the transverse ligament. Its base is at the clavicle, where it widens out, to be attached to the posterior edge of the under surface, as well as to the conoid tubercle. It is easily separated from the trapezoid without being absolutely distinct. A small bursa often exists between it and the coracoid process; internally, some of the fibres of the suhclavius muscle are often attached to it. The trapezoid ligament is the anterior and outer portion. It is a strong, flat, quadrilateral plane of closely-woven fibres, the surfaces of which look upwards and inwards towards the clavicle, and downwards and outwards over the upper surface of the coracoid process. At the coracoid it is attached for about an inch (2*5 cm.) to a rough ridge which runs forwards from the angle, along the anterior border of the process. At the clavicle, it is attached to the oblique ridge which runs282 THE ARTICULATIONS \ 1^ outwards and forwards from the conoid tubercle, reaching as far as, and blending with the inferior part of the acromio-clavicular ligament. Its anterior edge is free, and overlies the coraco-acromial ligament ; the posterior edge is shorter than the anterior, and is in contact with the posterior and outer portion of the conoid ligament. The arterial supply is derived from the suprascapular, acromial branches of the acromio-thoracic, and the anterior circumflex. The nerve-supply is derived from the suprascapular and circumflex nerves. Movements.—In the movements of the shoulder girdle, the scapula moves upon! the outer end of the clavicle, and the clavicle, in turn, carried by the uniting ligaments, moves upon the sternum ; so that the entire scapula moves in the arc of a circle whose centre is at the sterno-clavicular joint, and whose radius is thej clavicle. The scapula, in moving upon the clavicle, also moves upon the thorax] forwards and backwards, upwards and downwards, and also in a rotatory direction! upon an axis drawn at right angles to the centre of the bone. Throughout these| movements the lower angle and base of the scapula are kept in contact with thei ribs by the latissimus dor si which straps down the former, and the rhomboids andi serratus magnus which brace down the latter. The glenoid cavity could noti have preserved its obliquely forward direction had there been no acromio-clavicular joint, but would have shifted round a vertical axis, and thus the shoulder wouldj have pointed inwards when the scapula was advanced, and outwards when it was drawn backwards. By means of the acromio-clavicular joint, the scapula can be forcibly advanced upon the thorax, the glenoid cavity all the time keeping its face duly forwards. Thus the muscles of the shoulder and forearm can be with advantage combined, as, for example, in giving a direct blow. The acromio- clavicular joint also permits the lower angle of the scapula to be retained in contact with the chest wall during the rising and falling of the shoulder, the scapula turning in a hinge-like manner round the horizontal axis of the joint. There are no actions in which the scapula moves on a fixed clavicle, or the clavicle on a fixed scapula ; the two bones, bound together by their connecting ligament, must move in unison. I' (c) The Proper Scapular Ligaments • 'v There are three proper ligaments of the scapula, which pass between different portions of the bone, viz.— Coraco-acromial. Transverse. ':, Inferior transverse. The coraco-acromial ligament (figs. 222, 226) is a flat, triangular band with a broad base, attached to the outer border of the coracoid process, and a blunt apex which is fixed to the tip of the acromion. It is made up of two broad marginal bands, and a smaller and thinner intervening portion. The anterior band, which arises from the anterior portion of the coracoid process, is the stronger, and some of its marginal fibres can often be traced into the short head of the biceps, which can then make tense this edge of the ligament. The posterior band, coming from the posterior part of the coracoid process, is also strong. The intermediate part, of variable extent, is thin and membranous, containing but few ligamentous fibres; ; it is often incomplete near the coracoid process, leaving a small gap. The superior ; surface of the ligament looks upwards and a little forwards, and is covered by the! deltoid muscle ; the inferior looks downwards and a little backwards, and is separated from the capsule of the shoulder-joint by a bursa. At the coracoid process it overlies the coraco-humeral ligament. It is barely one-third of an inch233 THE SCAPULO-CLAVICULAB I '8 mm.) above the capsule of tlie shoulder, and in the undissected state there is tcarcely a quarter of an inch (G mm.) interval. The outer edge projects over the centre of the head of the humerus, and is continued into a tough fascia under the ieltoid ; the inner edge is continuous with the fascia over the supra-spinatus nuscle. It binds the two processes firmly together, and so strengthens each; t holds the deltoid off the capsule of the shoulder, and protects the joint from flight injuries directed downwards and backwards against it. The transverse, coracoid, or suprascapular ligament (figs. 222, 223, 224) is a Ismail triangular band of fibrous tissue, the surfaces of which look forwards and backwards ; and its edges, which are thin and sharp, are turned upwards and down- wards. It continues the superior border of the scapula, bridging over the supra- ' scapular notch. It is broader internally, where it springs from the upper border of the scapula on its dorsal surface ; and narrow externally, where it is attached to the base of the coracoid process ; some of its fibres are inserted under the edge of the trapezoid ligament, and others pass upwards with the conoid to reach the clavicle. The sujn^asccqmlar artery passes over it, and the suprascapular 7ierve beneath it. Internally, some fibres of the omo-hyoid muscle arise from it. } The inferior transverse or spino-glenoid ligament (fig. 223) reaches from the [external border of the spine to the margin of the glenoid cavity, and so forms a ! foramen under which the suprascapular vessels and nerve gain the infraspinous fossa. It is usually a weak membranous structure with but few ligamentous f fibres.234 THE ARTICULATIONS 3. THE SHOULDER JOINT Class.—Diarthrosis. Subdivision.—Enarthrodia. The shoulder is one of the most perfect, and most movable of joints, the large upper end of the humerus playing upon the shallow glenoid cavity. Like the hip, it is a ball-and-socket joint. It is retained in position much less by ligaments than by muscles and the effects of atmospheric pressure ; and, owing to the looseness of its capsule, as well as to all the other conditions of its construction and position, it is exceedingly liable to be displaced ; on the other hand, it is sheltered from violence by the two projecting processes—the acromion and coracoid. The ligaments of the shoulder joint are :— Capsular. Coraco-humeral. Gleno-humeral. Glenoid. The capsular ligament (figs. 222, 223 and 224) is a loose sac, insufficient in itself to maintain the bones in contact. It consists of fairly distinct but not coarse fibres, closely woven together, and directed, some straight, others obliquely, between the two bones, a few circular ones being interwoven amongst them. At the scapula, it is fixed on the dorsal aspect to the prominent rough surface of the glenoid process, reaching as far as the neck of the bone. Above, it is attached to the root of the coracoid process : in front, to the ventral surface of the glenoid process, at a variable distance from the articular margin, often reaching half an inch (12 mm.) upon the neck of the bone, and thus allowing the formation of a pouch ; it may not, however, extend for more than a quarter of an inch (6 mm.) beyond the articular margin : below, it blends with the origin of the long head of the triceps. At the humerus, the upper half is fixed to the anatomical neck, sending a prolongation downwards between the two tuberosities which attenuates235 THE SHOULDER JOINT las it descends, and covers the transverse humeral hgament. The lower half of the capsule descends upon the humerus further from the articular margin, some of the deeper fibres being reflected upwards so as to be attached close to the articular edge, thus forming a kind of fibrous investment for the neck of the humerus. This ligament is more uniform in thickness than that of the hip. 1 Gleno-humeral bands of the capsule (figs. 224 and 225).—There are three accessory bands which strengthen the capsule, two of which are seen superficially, land consist of a few strengthening fibres, one on the inner aspect reaching from I the glenoid cavity to the lower border of the lesser tuberosity along the lower border [of the subscapularis tendon ; and the inferior reaching from the under part of the I glenoid cavity to the under part of the neck of the humerus. The third, the superior band, is known as the gleno-humeral ligament, and can only be seen after opening the capsule. It runs from the edge of the glenoid cavity at the root of the coracoid, just internal to the origin of the long tendon of the biceps, and, passing inwards and downwards at an acute angle to the tendon, for which it forms a slight groove I or sulcus, is fixed to the lesser tuberosity of the humerus. It is a thin, ribbon- like band, of which the upper surface is attached to the capsule, while the other Fig. 225.— Fcetal Shoulder Joint, showing the Gleno-humeral Ligament, AND ALSO the ShORT HeAD OF THE BiCEPS, BEING CONTINUOUS WITH THE CORACO-ACROMIAL LiGAMENT. is free and turned towards the joint. In the foetus it is often, and in the adult occasionally, quite free from the capsule, and may be as thick as the long tendon of the biceps (fig. 225). The tendons of the sujyra- and infra-siyinatus, teres minor, and suhscaimlaris muscles strengthen and support the capsule, especially near their points of insertion, and can be with difficulty dissected off from it. The long head of the triceps supports and strengthens the capsule below. The capsule also receives an upward slip from the ijectoralis major. The supra-sinnatus often sends a slip into the capsule from its upper edge. The coraco-humeral ligament (fig. 226) is a strong broad band, which is attached above to the outer edge of the root and horizontal limb of the coracoid nearly as far as the tip. From this origin it is directed backwards to blend with the capsule along the line of the biceps tendon, and is inserted into the greater tuberosity of the humerus. Seen from the back, it looks like an uninterrupted continuation of the capsule, while from the front it looks like a fan-shaped prolongation over- lying the rest of the ligament. At its origin there is sometimes a bursa between it and the capsule. The glenoid ligament (figs. 224 and 227) is a narrow rim of dense fibro-cartilage, which surrounds the edge of and deepens the glenoid socket. It is about a quarterTHE ABTIGULATIONS 236 of an inch (6 mm.) wide above and below, but less at the sides. Its outer edge is inseparably welded, near the bone, with the capsular ligament. In some places, especially at the inner side and above, it often overlaps the cartilage and forms a fringe ; at others, it may be separated by a very narrow interval, covered by loosely woven fibro-cartilage. Its structure is almost entirely fibrous, with but few cartilage cells intermixed. At the upper part of the fossa the biceps tendon is prolonged into the glenoid ligament, the tendon usually dividing and sending fibres into both sides of the ligament, which may wind round nearly the whole circumference of the socket. It may, however, send fibres into one side only, usually into the outer. The articular cartilage covering the glenoid fossa is thicker at the circum- ference than at the centre, thus tending to deepen the cavity. It is usually thickest at the lower part of the fossa ; over the head of the humerus the cartilage is thickest at and below the centre. Fig. 226.—Outer View of the Shoulder Joint, showing the Coraco-humeral AND Transverse Humeral Ligaments. Trapezoid ligament- Tendon of subscapularis muscle- The synovial membrane lines the glenoid ligament, and is then reflected over the capsule as far as its attachment to the humerus, from which it ascends as far as the edge of the articular cartilage. The tendon of the biceps receives a long tubular sheath, which is continuous with the synovial membrane, both at its attached extremity and at the bicipital groove, but is free in the rest of its extent. The synovial cavity sometimes communicates with the bursa under the subscapu- laris, and less frequently with one under the infraspinatus muscle. It also sends a pouch-like prolongation beneath the coracoid process when the fibrous capsule is attached wide of the margin of the glenoid fossa. A few fringes are seen near the edge of the glenoid cavity, and there is often one which runs down the inner edge of the biceps tendon, extending slightly below it, and so making a slight groove for the tendon to lie in.THE SHOULDER JOINT 237 The transverse humeral ligament (fig. 226) is so closely connected with the capsule of the shoulder that, although it is a proper ligament of the humerus, it jimay well be described here. It is a strong band of fibrous tissue, which extends between the two tuberosities, roofing in the bicipital canal. It is covered by a thin [expansion of the capsule. It is limited to the portion of the bone above the Une of the epiphysis. (C. Gordon Brodie, Journ. Anat. xxiv. 247.) The following muscles are in relation with the capsular ligament: above, the suprasjnnatus ; externally, the infraspinatus and teres minor ; below, the long head of the triceps ; internally, the tendon of the subscapular is. The deltoid covers the outer and upper surfaces of the joint, but is separated from the capsule by a bursa, and the tendons of the short rotator muscles. An upward slip from the pectoralis major joins the capsule below. Internally are the long tendon of the hice^js and the gieno-humeral ligament.

I Flexion is the swinging forwards, extension the swinging backwards, of the , humerus; abduction is the raising of the arm from, and adduction depression of I the arm to, the side. In flexion and extension the head of the humerus moves upon the centre of the glenoid fossa round an oblique line corresponding to the axis of the head and neck of the humerus, flexion being more free than extension, and in j extreme flexion the scapula follows the head of the humerus, so as to keep the i articular surfaces in apposition. In extension the scapula moves much less, if at all. j In abduction and adduction the scapula is fixed, and the humerus rolls up and I down upon the glenoid fossa ; during abduction the head descends until it projects [ beyond the lower edge of the glenoid cavity, and the great tuberosity impinges I against the arch of the acromion ; during adduction, the head of the humerus238 THE ABTICULATIONS ascends in its socket, the arm at length reaches the side, and the capsule is com- pletely relaxed. In circumduction, the humerus, by passing quickly through these movements, describes a cone, whose apex is at the shoulder joint, and the base at the distal extremity of the bone or limb. Eotation takes place round a vertical axis drawn through the extremities of the humerus from the centre of the head to the inner condyle ; in rotation forwards (that is, inwards) the head of the bone rolls back in the socket as the great tuberosity ; and shaft are turned forwards ; in rotation backwards (that is, outwards) the head i of the bone glides forwards, and the tuberosity and shaft of the humerus are turned ' backwards, i.e. outwards. Great freedom of movement is permitted at the shoulder, and this is increased by the mobility of the scapula. Eestraint is scarcely exercised at all upon the movements of the shoulder by the ligaments, but chiefly by the muscles of the joint. In abduction, the lower part of the capsule is somewhat, and in extreme abduction considerably, tightened; and in rotation inwards and outwards, the upper part of the capsule is made tense, as is also, in the latter movement, the coraco-humeral ligament. The movements of abduction and extension have a most decided and definite resistance offered to them other than by muscles and ligaments, for the great tuberosity of the humerus, by striking against the acromion process and coraco- acromial ligament, stops short any further advance of the bone in these directions, and thus abduction ceases altogether as soon as the arm is raised to a right angle with the trunk, and extension shortly after the humerus passes the line of the trunk. Further elevation of the arm beyond the right angle is effected by the rotation of the scapula round its own axis by the action of the trapezius and serratus magnus muscles upon the sterno-clavicular and acromio-clavicular joints. The acromion and coracoid processes, together with the coraco-acromial ligament, form an arch, which is separated by a bursa and the tendon of the supra-spmatus from the capsule of the shoulder. Beneath this arch the movements of the joint take place, and against it the head and tuberosities are pressed when the weight of the trunk is supported by the arms ; the greater tuberosity and the upper part of the shaft impinge upon it when abduction and extension are carried to their fullest extent. No description of the shoulder joint would be complete without a short notice of the peculiar relation which the biceps tendon bears to the joint. It passes over the head of the humerus a little to the inner side of its summit, and lies free within the capsule, surrounded only by a tubular process of synovial membrane. It is flat, with the surfaces looking upwards and downwards, until it reaches the bicipital groove, when it assumes a rounded form. It strengthens the articulation along the same course as the coraco-humeral ligament, and tends to prevent the head of the humerus being pulled upwards too forcibly against the under surface of the acromion. It also serves the purpose of a ligament by steadying the head of the humerus in various movements of the arm and forearm, and to this end is let into a groove at the upper end of the bone, from which it cannot escape on account of the abutting tuberosities and the strong transverse humeral ligament which binds it down. Further, it acts like the four shoulder muscles, which pass over the capsule to keep the head of the humerus against the glenoid socket ; and, more- over, it resists the tendency of the pectoralis major and latissimus dorsi muscles, in certain actions when the arm is away from the side of the body, to pull the head of the humerus below the lower edge of the cavity.239 THE ELBOW JOINT 4. THE ELBOW JOINT Class. —Diar thro sis. Subdivision.—Ging lymus. The elbow is a complete hinge, and, unlike the knee, depends for its security ind strength upon the configuration of its bones rather than on the number, strength, or arrangement of its ligaments. The bones composing it are the lower 3nd of the humerus above, and the upper ends of the radius and ulna below ; the irticular surface of the humerus being received partly within the great sigmoid jsavity of the ulna, and partly upon the cup-shaped surface of the radius. The ligaments form one large and capacious capsule, which, by blending with the orbicular ligament, and then passing on to be attached to the neck of the radius, smbraces the elbow and the superior radio-ulnar joints, uniting them into one. Laterally, it is considerably strengthened by superadded fibres arising from the sondyles of the humerus and inseparably connected with the capsule. For con- v^enience of description it will be spoken of as consisting of four portions :— The anterior portion (fig. 228) is attached to the front of the humerus above the articular surface and coronoid fossa, in an inverted V-shaped manner, to two very faintly marked ridges which start from the front of the internal and external condyles, and meet at a variable distance above the coronoid fossa. Below, it is fixed, just beyond the articular margin, to the front of the coronoid process ; it is intimately blended with the front of the orbicular ligament, a few fibres passing on to the neck of the radius. It varies in strength and thickness, being some- jtimes so thin as barely to cover the synovial membrane ; at others, thick and strong, and formed of coarse decussating fibres, the majority of which descend from the :inner side outwards to the radius. The posterior portion (fig. 229), thin and membranous, is attached superiorly jto the humerus, in much the same inverted V-shaped w^ay as the anterior; I ascending from the internal condyle, along the inner side of the olecranon fossa I nearly to the top ; then, crossing the bottom of the fossa, it descends on the outer i side, skirting the outer margin of the trochlear surface, and turns outwards along the posterior edge of the capitellum. Inferiorly, it is attached to a slight groove I along the superior and external surfaces of the olecranon, and the rough surface of the ulna just beyond the lesser sigmoid notch, and with the orbicular ligament, a few fibres passing on to the neck of the radius. It is composed of decussating fibres, most of which pass vertically or obliquely downwards, a few taking a ! transverse course at the summit of the olecranon fossa where the ligament is 1 usually thinnest. The internal portion (fig. 228) is thicker, stronger, and denser than either the anterior or posterior portions. It is triangular in form, its apex being attached to the anterior and under aspect of the internal condyle, and to the condyloid edge of 1 the groove between the trochlea and the condyle. The fibres radiate downwards from this attachment, the anterior passing forwards to be fixed to the rough over- i hanging inner edge of the coronoid process ; the middle descend less obliquely to a i ridge running between the coronoid and olecranon processes, while the posterior ; pass obliquely backwards to the inner edge of the olecranon just beyond the : articular margin. The anterior fibres are the thickest, strongest, and most pronounced. I The external portion (fig. 229) is attached above to the lower part of the external condyle, and from this the fibres radiate to their attachment into the outer side of the orbicular ligament, a few fibres being prolonged to reach the Anterior. Posterior. Internal. External.THE ARTICULATIONS 240 neck of the radius. The anterior fibres reach further forwards than the posterior do behind. Tt is strong and well-marked, but less so than the internal portion. The synovial membrane lines the whole of the capsule, and extends into the superior radio-ulnar joint, lining the orbicular ligament. Outside the synovial membrane, but inside the capsule, are often seen some pads of fatty tissue; one is Fig. 228.—Internal View of the Elbow Joint. Internal lateral ligament Oblique ligament Upoer edge of inter- osseous membrane Fig.' 229.—External View of the Elbow Joint. Orbicular ligament External lateral ligament Posterior ligament situated on the inner side at the base of the olecranon, another is seen on th outside projecting into the cavity between the radius and ulna ; this latter, with a fold of synovial membrane opposite the front of the outer lip of the trochlea, suggests the division of the joint into two parts—one internally for the ulna, and another externally for the radius. There are also pads of fatty tissue at the botto of the olecranon and coronoid fossae, and at the tip of the olecranon process.THE ELBOW JOINT 241 The arterial supply is derived from each of the vessels forming the free mastomosis romid the elbow, and there is also a special branch to the front and )uter side of the joint from the brachial artery, and the arterial branch to the hrachialis anticus also feeds the front of the joint. I The nerve-supply comes from the musculo-cutaneous chiefly ; the ulna, median, knd musculo-spiral also give filaments to the joint. ! The movements permitted at the elbow are those of a true hinge joint, viz. jlexion and extension. These movements are oblique, so that the forearm is I nclined inwards in flexion, and outwards in extension ; they are limited by the iontact respectively of the coronoid and olecranon processes of the ulna with their 3orresponding fossae on the humerus, and their extent is determined by the relative proportion between the length of the processes and depth of the foss« which I receive them, rather than by the tension of the ligaments, or the bulk of the soft barts over them. The anterior and posterior portions of the capsule, together with |;he corresponding portions of the lateral ligament, are not put on stretch during lexion and extension ; but, although they may assist in checking the velocity, and ihus prevent undue force of impact, they do not control or determine the extent of ihese movements. The limit of extension is reached when the ulna is nearly in a straight line with the humerus ; and the limit of flexion when the ulna describes an angle of from 30° to 40° with the humerus. The obliquity of these movements is due to the outward inclination of the iipper and back part of the trochlear surface, and the greater prominence of the inner lip of the trochlea below ; thus the plane of motion is directed from behind inwards and forwards, and carries the hand towards the middle third of the 3lavicle. The obliquity of the joint, the inward twist of the shaft of the humerus, ind the backward direction of its head, all tend to bring the hand towards the mid line, under the immediate observation of the eye, either for defence, employ- jment, or nourishment. This is in striking contrast to the lower limb, where the I Idirection of the foot diverges from the median axis of the trunk, thus preventing awkwardness in locomotion. In flexion and extension, the cup-like depression of the radial head glides upon the capitellum, and the inner margin of the radial head travels in the groove between the capitellum and the trochlea. This allows the radius to rotate upon the humerus while following the ulna in all its movements. In full extension and supination, the head of the radius is barely In contact with the inferior surface of the capitellum, and projects so much back- 'vards that its posterior margin can be felt as a prominence at the back of the elbow. In full flexion the anterior edge of the radial head is received into, and (jhecked against, the depression above the capitellum ; while in mid-flexion the cup-like depression is fairly received upon the capitellum, and in this position, the radius being more completely steadied by the humerus than in any other, pronation and supination take place most perfectly. j 5. THE UNION OF THE RADIUS WITH THE ULNA The radius is firmly united to the ulna by two joints, and an intermediate fibrous union, viz.— I {a) The superior radio-ulnar,—whereat the head of the radius rotates within |the lesser sigmoid cavity and orbicular ligament. I (h) The union of the shafts,—the mid radio-ulnar union. ! (c) The inferior radio-ulnar,—whereat the lower end of the radius rolls round 'the head of the ulna. RTHE ABTICULATIONS 242 (a) The Superioe Eadio-ulnae Joint Class.—Diarthrosis. Subdivision.—Troclioidcs. The bones which enter into this joint are, the uhia by its lesser sigmoid ca-vit^ and the radius by the smooth vertical border or rim on its head. There is but on ligament special to the joint, viz.:— Orbicular. The orbicular ligament consists of bands of strong fibres, somewhat thicke than the capsule of the elbow-joint, which encircle the head of the radius retaining it against the side of the ulna. The bulk of these fibres forms aboii three-fourths of a circle, and they are attached to the anterior and posterio margins of the lesser sigmoid cavity; some few are continued round below tb lesser sigmoid cavity, and form a complete ligamentous circle. The ligament i inseparably connected along its upper edge and external (i.e. its non-articulai surface with the anterior, posterior, and external portions of the capsule of ih elbow, a few of the fibres of these portions, especially of the external, descendin< to be attached to the neck of the radius. The lower part of the articulatioi is covered in by a thin independent membranous layer, which passes from tbi lower edge of the orbicular ligament to the neck of the radius, strengthened oi the outer side by those fibres passing down from the capsule. They are loos- enough to allow the bone to rotate upon its own axis (fig. 230). The synovial membrane is the same as that of the elbow, and, after Hning th^ orbicular ligament, passes on to the neck of the radius, and thence up to th^ articular cartilage. The arterial and nerve-supply are the same as those to the outer part of thi elbow joint. [h) The Mid Radio-ulxar Union There are two interosseous ligaments which pass between the shafts of th bones and unite them firmly together, viz. : — Obhque ligament. Interosseous membrane.OF THE BADIUS WITH THE ULNA 243 The oblique ligament (fig. 228) is a fairly strong, narrow band, which passes n the lower end of the rough outer border of the coronoid process, downwards [ outwards to be attached to the posterior edge of the lower end of the pital tuberosity of the radius and the vertical ridge running from it to the er border of the bone. Borne of its fibres blend with the fibres of insertion of biceps tendon ; behind, it is in close contact with the sujnnator brevis ; below, lin membrane passes off from it to the upper edge of the interosseous mem- ae; the posterior interosseous vessels pass in the sjoace between it and the irosseous membrane. The interosseous membrane (fig. 228) is attached to the ulna at the lowest t of the ridge in front of the depression for the supinator brevis, and along whole length of the interosseous border as far as the inferior radio-ulnar culation, approaching the front of the bone in the lower part of its attach- it. To the radius it is attached along the interosseous border, from an inch cm.) below the bicipital tuberosity to the sigmoid notch for the lower end of ulna. It is strongest and broadest in the centre, where the fibres are dense closely packed ; it is also well marked beneath the loronator quadratus, and kens considerably at the lower end, forming a strong band of union between two bones. Its fibres pass chiefly downwards and inwards, from the radius he ulna, though some take the opposite direction ; at the lower end some transverse. On the posterior surface are one or two bands, which pass down- Is and outwards from the ulna to the radius, and frequently there is a strong die as large as the oblique ligament; this should be called the inferior oblique ment (fig. 234), and it stretches from the ulna, an inch and a half above its ii extremity, downwards and outwards to the ridge above and behind the sigmoid ih of the radius. kt its attachment to the bones the interosseous membrane blends with the osteum. Its upper border is connected with the oblique ligament by a thin ibrane, which is pierced by the posterior interosseous vessels; and the lower ier, which stretches across between the two bones just above the inferior radio- articulation, assists in completing the capsule of that joint. Its anterior Eice is in relation with the flexor iwof undus digitorum njiid flexor longus ijollicis he upper three-quarters, the lower fourth being in relation with the ijronator Iratus. The anterior interosseous vessels and nerve descend along the lie of the membrane, the artery being bound down to it. About an inch 1 the lower end, it is pierced by the anterior interosseous artery. The posterior ice is in relation with the sujrinator brevis, extensor ossis metacarpi, extensor li, extensor secundi internodii ijollicis, and the extensor indicis ; also, with the srior branch of the anterior interosseous artery. (c) The Infeeior Eadio-ulnar Joint Class.—Diartlirosis. Subdivision.—Lateral Gimjlymus. I^his is, in one respect, the reverse of the superior; for the radius, instead of anting a circular head to rotate upon the facet on the ulna, presents a concave ; which rolls round the ulna. The articulation may be said to consist of two 3 at right angles to one another : one between the radius and ulna, and the r between the ulna and triangular fibro-cartilage. -he ligaments are :— Anterior radio-ulnar. ' Posterior radio-ulnar. Triangular fibro-cartilage. -he triangular fibro-cartilage (figs. 234, 235) assists the radius in forming rch under which is received the first row of carpal bones. Its base is attached , e2THE ABTICULATIONS 244 to the margin of the radius, separating the sigmoid cavity from the articul surface for the radio-carpal joint, while its apex is fixed from the front to the bai of the fossa at the base of the styloid ^Drocess of the ulna. It gradually ai uniformly diminishes in width from base to apex, becoming rounded where it fixed to the ulna ; it is joined by fibres of the internal lateral ligament of the wris It is about three-eighths of an inch (1 cm.) wide, and the same from base to ape: thicker at the circumference than at the centre; smooth and concave above adapt itself to the ulna, and smooth and slightly concave below to fit over t] cuneiform bone. Its anterior and posterior borders are united to the anteri and posterior radio-ulnar and radio-carpal ligaments. It is the most importa: structure in the inferior radio-carpal articulation, as it is a very firm bond union between the lower ends of the bones, and serves to limit their movemeu upon one another more than any other structure in either the upper or low radio-ulnar joints. Its structure is fibrous at the circumference, while at t] centre there is a preponderance of cells. It differs from all other fibrd-cartilag in entering into two distinct articulations; and separates entirely the synovi membrane of the radio-ulnar joint from that of the wrist. The anterior radio-ulnar ligament (fig. 231) is attached by one end to t] anterior edge of the sigmoid cavity of the radius, and by the other to the roui bone above the articular surface of the ulna as far inwards as the notch, as well into the anterior margin of the triangular cartilage from base to apex. The posterior radio-ulnar ligament (fig. 232) is similarly attached to the po terior margin of the sigmoid cavity at one end, and by the other to the rou< bone above the articular surface of the extremity of the ulna as far inwards as t] groove for the flexor carpi ulnaris, with the sheath of which it is connected, ai also into the whole length of the posterior margin of the triangular fibro-cartilac Both the radio-ulnar ligaments consist of thin, almost scattered, fibres, but tb( serve to form a capsule for the support and protection of the synovial membrane. The lower end of the interosseous membrane extends between the ulna ai radius immediately above their points of contact. Transverse fibres between t] two bones form a sort of arch above the concave articular facet of the radii and, joining the anterior and posterior radio-ulnar ligaments, complete the capsii of the inferior radio-ulnar joint. The synovial membrane,- sometimes called the membrana sacciformis, is lar and loose in proportion to the size of the joint. It is not only interposed betwe( the radial and ulnar articular surfaces, but lines the terminal articular surface the ulna and the upper surface of the triangular fibro-cartilage. The arterial supply is derived from the anterior interosseous artery, and branch of the anterior carpal arch. The nerve-supply comes from the anterior interosseous of the median, and tl posterior interosseous branch of the musculo-spiral. The movements of the radius.—The upper end of the radius rotates arom an axis drawn through its own head and neck within the collar formed by the less sigmoid cavity and the orbicular ligament, while the lower end rolls round t head of the ulna, being retained in position by the triangular ligament. This rotati( is called proiiation when the radius from a position nearly parallel to the uli turns inwards so as to lie obliquely across it; and supination when the radius tur back again from within outwards, so as to uncross and lie nearly parallel with t ulna. In these movements, the radius carries with it the hand, which rotates on ? axis passing a little to the inner side of the middle line ; thus, the hand when pi nated, lies with its dorsum upwards, as in playing the piano, while when supinatc the palm lies upwards—the attitude of a beggar asking alms. Ward thus express the relations of the two extremities of the radius in pronation and supination : ' T head of the radius is so disposed in relation to the sigmoid cavity at the lower ei245 OF THE BADIUS WITH THE ULNA ;t the axis of the former if prolonged falls upon the centre of the circle of which latter is a segment ; ' the axis thus passes through the lower end of the ulna at oint at which the triangular fibro-cartilage is attached, and if prolonged further ses through the ring finger. Thus the radius describes, in rotating, a blunt- ped cone whose apex is the centre of the radial head, and whose base is at the st; thus partial rotation of the bone is unaccompanied by any hinge-like or ero-posterior motion of its head, and pronation and supination occur without iurbance to the parallelism of the bones at the superior radio-ulnar joint, lociated with this rotation in the ordinary way, there is some rotation of the nero-ulnar shaft, which causes lateral shifting of the hand from side to side ; s, with pronation there is some abduction, and with supination some adduction ibined, so that the hand can keep on the same superficies in both pronation and ination. The power of supination in man is much greater than pronation, ng to the immense power and leverage obtained by the curve of the radius, [ by the attachment of the biceps tendon to the back of the tubercle. For this son all our screw-driving and boring tools are made to be used by supination cements. In the undissected state, the amount of rotation it is possible to obtain is about °, so that neither the palm nor the fore part of the lower end of the radius can iurned completely in opposite directions ; yet in the living subject this amount be greatly increased by rotation of the humero-ulnar shaft at the shoulder joint. Pronation is checked in the living subject by the posterior inferior radio-ulnar ,ment, which is strengthened by the connection of the sheath of the extensor Ions with it ; by the lowermost fibres of the interosseous membrane, the back t of the internal and adjacent fibres of the posterior ligament of the wrist, and meeting of the soft parts on the front of the forearm. Supination is checked mainly by the internal lateral ligament of the wrist, but tly also by the oblique radio-ulnar ligament, the anterior inferior radio-ulnar, by the lowest fibres of the interosseous membrane. The interosseous membrane serves, from the direction of its fibres downwards inwards from the radius to the ulna, to transmit the weight of the body from ulna to the radius in the extended position of the elbow, as in pushing forwards 1 the arms extended, or in supporting one's own weight on the hands, the ulna ig in firm contact with the humerus, but scarcely at all with the carpus ; while radius is scarcely in contact with the humerus, but in firm contact with the Dus. Hence the weight transmitted by the ulna is communicated to the radius he tightening of the interosseous membrane. Conversely, in falls upon the hand 1 the arm extended, the interosseous membrane acts as a sling to break the ence of the shock, and prevents the whole force of the impact expending itself ictly upon the capitellum. 6. THE RADIO-CAKPAL ARTICULATION Class.—Diarthrosis. Subdivision.—Ginglymus (with double hinge joint action.) The wrist joint is formed by the union of the radius and triangular fibro-car- 3'e above, articulating with the scaphoid, semilunar, and cuneiform bones below ; ulna being excluded by the intervention of the triangular fibro-cartilage. The Lus and triangular cartilage together present a smooth surface, slightly concave 1 from before backwards, and from side to side ; whilst the three bones of the 3US present a smooth, convex surface, made uniformly even by the interosseous .ments which bind them together.246 THE ARTICULATIONS The capsule of the wrist joint has been usually described as four separate ligj ments, and it will be convenient for the sake of a complete description to folio- this method ; but it must be understood that these four portions are continuoi around the joint, extending from styloid process to styloid process on both r aspects. The four portions are :— Anterior radio-carpal. Internal lateral. Posterior radio-carpal. External lateral. The anterior radio-carpal (fig. 231) is a thick strong ligament, attache superiorly to the radius immediately above the margin of the terminal articule facet, to the curved ridge at the root of the styloid process of the radius, and to th anterior margin of the triangular cartilage, blending with some fibres of the capsu; of the inferior radio-ulnar joint. It passes downwards and inwards to be attache to both rows of carpal bones, especially the second, and to the anterior intercarps ligament. The strongest and most obhque fibres arise from the root of the styloi process of the radius, and pass obliquely over the scaphoid, with which only a fe^ fibres are connected, to be inserted into the semilunar, magnum, and cuneiform bone^ Another set, less oblique, pass from the margin of the facet for the semilunar to b attached to the adjacent parts of the magnum, unciform, and the cuneiform bone^ Between the two sets of fibres, small vessels pass into the joint. The posterior radio-carpal ligament (fig. 232) is attached superiorly to th dorsal edge of the lower end of the radius, the back of the styloid process, and th! posterior margin of the fibro-cartilage. It passes downwards and inwards to b connected with the first row of the carpal bones, chiefly with the semilunar an* cuneiform, and the posterior intercarpal ligament. This ligament is thin an(j membranous, and is strengthened by (i) strong fibres passing from the back of thi fibro-cartilage, where they are blended with the posterior inferior radio-ulnaTHE BADIO-CARPAL 247 gament, and, from the edge of the radius just behmd the lesser sigmoid fossa, to 16 cuneiform bone ; (ii) from the ridge and groove for the extensor secundi iternodii polHcis to the back of the semilunar and cuneiform bones; and (iii) from le groove for the radial extensors to the back of the scaphoid and semilunar. It : in relation with, and strengthened by, the extensor tendons which pass over it. The internal lateral lig^ament (fig. 232) is fan-shaped, with its apex above, at 16 styloid process of the ulna, to which it is attached on all sides, blending with 16 apex of the fibro-cartilage. Some of the fibres pass forwards and outwards to 16 base of the pisiform bone and to the inner part of the upper border of the iiterior annular ligament, where it is attached to the pisiform bone ; they form thick, rounded fasciculus on the front of the wrist. Other fibres descend vertically 3 the inner side of the cuneiform bone, and others again outwards to the dorsal arface of the cuneiform. The tendon of the extensor carpi ulnaris is posterior D, and passes over, part of the fibres of the ligament. Fig. 232.—Posterior View of Wrist. I I Posterior radio-carpal ligament Capsule of earpo-meta- earpal joint of th.umb Posterior radio- ulnar ligament Internal lateral ligament of wrist The external lateral ligament (fig. 231) consists of fibres which radiate from ihe fore part and tip of the styloid process of the radius. Some pass downwards md inwards, in front, to the scaphoid and adjacent edge of the magnum ; others iownwards, a little forwards and inwards, to the tubercle of the scaphoid and ridge Df the trapezium ; and others downwards and outwards to the rough dorsal surface 3f the scaphoid. The fibres of this ligament are not so long and strong, nor do they radiate so much as those of the internal lateral ligament. It is in relation with the radial artery, and the extensor ossis metaca7yi and primi internodii 'poUicis, the artery separating the tendons from the ligament. The synovial membrane is extensive, but does not usually communicate with the synovial membrane of the inferior radio-ulnar joint, being shut out by the triangular cartilage. It is also shut out, in almost every instance, from that of the carpal joints by the interosseous ligaments between the first row of carpal bones. The styloid process of the radius is cartilage-covered internally, and forms part of the articular cavity, while that of the ulna does not.THE ARTICULATIONS 248 The arterial supply is derived from the anterior and posterior carpal arches, the posterior di^-ision of the anterior interosseous, from twigs direct from the radial and ulnar arteries, and from recurrent branches from the first dorsal interosseous. The nerve-supply is derived from the ulnar and median in front, and the posterior i interosseous behind. ! Movements.—The wrist is a double hinge joint, allowing movements round a | transverse axis, i.e. flexion and extension ; and around an antero-posterior axis, i.e. i abduction and adduction; together with a combination of these in quick succession i —circumduction. Lacking only rotation on a vertical axis, it thus possesses > most of the movements of a ball-and-socket joint, wdthout the weakness and ^ Fig. 233.—Front of AVrist with Anterior Annular Ligament. Anterior radio-ulnar ligament Internal lateral ligament of wrist with slip to annular ligament PlSIFORr Anterior annular ligament Anterior radio-carpal ligament Tendon of the flexor carpi radialis liability to dislocation which are peculiar to these joints. This deficiency of rotation is compensated for by the movements of the radius at the radio-ulnar joints, viz. supination and pronation. Its strength depends chiefly upon the number of tendons which pass over it, and the close connection which exists between the fibrous tissue of their sheaths and the capsule of the wrist; also upon the proximity of the medio-carpal and carpo-metacarpal joints, which permits shocks and jars to be shared and distributed between them ; another source of strength is the absence of any long bone on the distal side of the joint. Li flexion and extension the carpus rolls forwards and backwards beneath the arch formed by the radius and fibro-cartilage; flexion being limited by the posterior Hgament and posterior portions of the lateral; extension by the anterior, and anterior portions of the lateral ligaments. Li adduction and alxluction, the carpal bones ghde from249 THE BADIO-CABPAL idthout inwards and from within outwards. Abduction being more limited than l,dduction, and being checked by the internal lateral ligament and by contact of he styloid process of the radius with the trapezium ; adduction being checked by he external lateral ligament alone. One reason for adduction being more free ban abduction is that the ulna does not reach so low down as the radius, and [he yielding fibro-cartilage allows of greater movement upwards of the inner end of he carpus. In circumduction the hand moves so as to describe a cone, the apex if which is at the wrist. These movements are made more easy and extensive by he slight gliding of the carpal bones upon one another, and the comparatively ree motion at the medio-carpal joint. The oblique direction of the fibres of the ateral ligaments prevents any rotation at the radio-carpal joint, while it permits honsiderable freedom of abduction and adduction. 7. THE CARPAL JOINTS I The joints of the carpus may be subdivided into— {a) The joints of the first row. [h) The joints of the second row. I (c) The medio-carpal, or junction of the two rows with each other. {a) The Union of the Fiest Row of Caepal Bones I Class.—Diar thro sis. Subdivision.—Arthroclia. The bones of the first row, the pisiform excepted, are united by two sets of igaments and two interosseous fibro-cartilages. Dorsal. Palmar. Interosseous fibro-cartilages. The two dorsal ligaments extend transversely between the bones, and connect :the scaphoid with the semilunar, and the semilunar with the cuneiform. Their posterior surfaces are in contact with the posterior ligament of the wrist. The two palmar ligaments extend nearly transversely between the bones connecting the scaphoid with the semilunar, and the semilunar with the cuneiform. They are stronger than the dorsal ligaments, and are placed beneath the anterior ligament of the wrist. I The two interosseous fibro-cartilages (fig. 235) are interposed between the scaphoid and semilunar, and the semilunar and cuneiform bones, reaching from the dorsal to the palmar surfaces, and being connected with the dorsal and palmar ligaments. They are narrow fibro-cartilages which extend between small portions only of the osseous surfaces. They help to form the convex carpal surface of the radio-carpal joint, and are somewhat wedge-shaped, their bases being towards [the wrist, and their thin edges between the adjacent articular surfaces of the bones. The synovial membrane is a prolongation from that of'the medio-carpal joint. The arterial and nerve supplies are the same as for the medio-carpal joint. The Union of the Pisifoem Bone with the eest of the Fiest Row This is an arthrodial joint which has a loose fibrous capsule attached to both the pisiform and cuneiform bones just beyond the margins of their articular surfaces. It is hned by a separate synovial membrane. Two strong rounded or flattened bands pass downwards from the pisiform, one to the process of the unciform, and the other to the base of the fifth metacarpal bone ; these may be regarded asTHE ARTICULATIONS 250 prolongations of the tendon of the flexor carpi ulnaris, and the pisiform bone may be looked upon in the li^i^ht of a sesamoid bone developed in that tendon. (b) The Union of the Second Eow of Carpal Bones Class.—Diarthrosis. Subdivision.—.4 r//ircx//rt. The four bones of this row are united to one another by three dorsal, three palmar, and two interosseous ligaments. The three dorsal ligaments (fig. 234) extend transversely and connect the trapezium with the trapezoid, the trapezoid with the magnum, and the magnum with the unciform. The three palmar ligaments are stronger than the dorsal, and are deeply placed | beneath the mass of extensor tendons ; they extend transversely between the bones in a similar manner to the dorsal ligaments. | The two interosseous ligaments are situated on either side of the magnum, | which they connect with the trapezoid on the outer, and the unciform on the | inner, side. That between the magnum and trapezoid is attached to the apposed | surfaces near their dorsal, i.e. the posterior aspect. That between the magnum and unciform (fig. 235) is attached to the apposed surfaces at their lower and anterior, i.e. the palmar aspect. The synovial membrane is a prolongation of that lining the medio-carpal joint. ■ The arterial and nerve supplies are the same as for the medio-carpal joint. (c) The Medio-caepal Joint, or the Union of the Two Eows of the Carpus with one another The inferior surfaces of the bones of the first row are adapted to the superior articular surfaces of the bones of the second row. The line of this articulation is concavo-convex from side to side, and is sometimes described as having the course of a Koman S placed horizontally CO, a resemblance by no means strained, (i) The outer part of the first row consists of the scaphoid alone ; it is convex, and bears the trapezium and trapezoid, (ii) Then follows a transversely elongated socket; formed by the inner part of the scaphoid, the semilunar and cuneiform, into which are received {a) the head of the magnum, which articulates with the scaphoid and semilunar ; {h) the upper and outer angle of the unciform, which articulates with the semilunar ; and (c) the upper convex portion of the internal surface of the unciform, which articulates with the external and conca^■e portion of the inferior surface of the cuneiform, (iii) The innermost part of the inferior surface of the cuneiform bone is convex, and turned a little backwards to fit into the lower portion of the internal surface of the unciform, which is a little concave and turned for- wards to receive it. The central part, which forms a socket for the magnum and unciform, has somewhat the character of a compound complex ball-and-socket joint ; the other portions are typically arthrodial. The ligaments are : (1) anterior medio-carpal; (2) posterior medio-carpal; (3) transverse dorsal. The anterior or palmar medio-carpal is a ligament of considerable strength, consisting mostly of fibres Avhich radiate from the magnum to the scaphoid, semi- lunar, and cuneiform ; some few fibres connect the trapezoid and trapezium with the scaphoid, and others pass between the unciform and cuneiform. It is covered over and thickened by fibrous tissue derived from the sheaths of the flexor tendons and the fibres of origin of the small muscles of the thumb and little finger. The posterior or dorsal medio-carpal ligament consists of fibres passing obliquely from the bones of the first row to those of the second. It is stronger on the ulnar side than on the radial, but is not so strong as the palmar ligament. The transverse dorsal ligament (fig. 234) is an additional band, well markedTHE CABPAL JOINTS 251 and often of considerable strength, which passes across the head of the magnum from the back of the scaphoid to the back of the cuneiform bone ; besides binding down the head of the magnum, it serves to fix the upper and outer angle of the unciform in the socket formed by the first row. The dorsal ligaments, like the palmar, are strengthened by a quantity of fibrous tissue belonging to the sheaths of the extensor tendons and an extension of some of the fibres of the capsule of the wrist. There are no proper lateral medio-carpal ligaments ; they are but prolongations of the lateral ligaments of the wrist. The synovial membrane (fig. 235) of the carpus is common to all the joints of the carpus, and extends to the bases of the four inner metacarpal bones. Thus, besides lining the inter- or medio-carpal joint, it sends two processes upwards between the three bones of the first row, and three downwards between the contiguous surfaces of the trapezoid and trapezium, the trapezium and magnum, and magnum and unciform. From the latter, prolongations run between the carpo-metacarpal Fig. 234.—Posterior View of Wrist, with Capsule cut to SHOW Articular Surfaces. Transverse dorsal ligament Lower lend of interosseous ligament Inferior oblique ligament Triangular fibro-cartilage Band of posterior ligament of wrist left to keep bones in sitil Tendon flexor carpi ulnaris < joints of the four inner bones, and three processes are sent down between the contiguous sides of the four inner metacarpal bones. The arterial supply is derived from (a) the anterior and posterior carpal branches of the radial and ulnar arteries ; (b) the carpal branch of the anterior interosseous, the recurrent branch ; and (c) branches from the deep carpal arch. The terminal \ twigs of the anterior and posterior interosseous supply the joint on its dorsal 1 aspect. The nerve-supply comes from the ulna on the ulnar side, the median on the radial side, and the posterior interosseous behind. The movements of the carpal articulations between bones of the same row are very limited and consist only of slight gliding upon one another ; but, slight as they are, they give elasticity to the carpus to break the jars and shocks which j-esult from blows or falls upon the hand. The movements of one row of bones upon the other at the medio-carpal joint are more extensive, especially in the direction of flexion and extension, so that the252 THE ARTICULATIONS hand enjoys a greater range of these movements than is permitted at the wrist joint alone. At the wrist, extension is more free than flexion; but this is balanced by the greater freedom of flexion than of extension at the medio-carpal joint, and by flexion at the carpo-metacarpal joint, so that on the whole the range of flexion of the hand is greater than that of extension. Fig. 235.—Synovial Membranes of Wrist, Hand, and Fingers. A slight amount of lateral motion accompanied by a limited degree of rotation also takes place ; this rotation consists in the head of the magnum and the superior and outer angle of the unciform bone rotating in the socket formed by the three bones of the upper row, and in a gliding forwards and backwards of the trapezium and trapezoid upon the scaphoid. In addition to the ligaments, the undulating outline and the variety of shapes of the apposed facets render this joint very secure.253 THE GABPO-METACABPAL JOINTS Bearing in mind the mobility of this medio-carpal joint and of the carpo- metacarpal, we see at once the reason for the radial and ulnar flexors and extensors I being prolonged down to their insertion into the base of the metacarpus, for they produce the combined effect of motion at each of the three transverse articulations : (1) at the wrist ; (2) at the medio-carpal ; (3) at the carpo-metacarpal joints. I 8. THE CAKPO-METACARPAL JOINTS These may be divided into two sets, namely :— (a) The carpo-metacarpal joints of the four inner fingers. (b) The carpo-metacarpal joint of the thumb. The inferior surfaces of three of the bones of the second row of the carpus present a combined surface for the four inner metacarpal bones ; the trapezium presents a distinct and separate saddle-shaped surface for the base of the meta- carpal bone of the thumb. (a) The Foue Inner Caepo-metacaepal Joints CIsLSS.—Diartlirosis. Subdivision.—Arthrodia. These joints exist between the trapezium, trapezoid, magnum, and unciform bones above, and the four inner metacarpal bones below. The ligaments which unite them are, dorsal, palmar, and interosseous. The dorsal ligaments (fig. 234).—Three dorsal ligaments pass to the second metacarpal bone : one from each of the carpal bones with which it articulates, viz. the trapezium, trapezoid, and magnum. Two dorsal bands pass from the magnum to the third metacarpal bone. Two dorsal bands pass to the fourth bone : one from the unciform, and another from the magnum ; the latter is sometimes wanting. The fifth bone has only one band passing to it from the unciform. The palmar ligaments.—One strong band passes from the second metacarpal bone to the trapezium internal to the ridge for the annular ligament; it is covered by the sheath of the flexor carpi radialis. Three bands pass from the third metacarpal: one outwards to the trapezium, a middle one upwards to the magnum, and a third inwards over the fourth to reach the fifth metacarpal and the unciform bones. One ligament connects the fourth bone to the unciform. One ligament connects the fifth bone to the unciform, the fibres extending internally, and connecting the dorsal and palmar ligaments. The ligament to the fifth bone is strengthened in front by the prolonged fibres of the flexor carpi ulnaris and the strong inner slip of the ligament of the third metacarpal bone; and posteriorly, by the tendon of the extensor carpi ulnaris. The interosseous ligament (fig. 235) is limited to one part of the articulation, and consists of short strong fibres connecting the contiguous angles of the unciform and magnum, and the third and fourth metacarpal bones towards their palmar aspect. There is, however, a thick strong ligament connecting the edge of the trapezium with the outer border of the base of the second metacarpal bone ; it helps j' to separate the carpo-metacarpal joint of the thumb from the common carpo- metacarpal joint, and to close in the radial side of the latter joint. The synovial membrane is a continuation of the medio-carpal joint; occa- sionally there is a separate membrane between the unciform and fourth and fifth metacarpal bones (fig. 235); while that between the fourth and magnum is lined by the synovial sac of the common joint.THE ABTICULATIONS 254 The arteries to the four inner carpo-metacarpal jomts are as follow :— (1) For the index finger: twigs, are supplied by the trunk of the radial on the dorsal and palmar aspects, the metacarpal, the dorsalis indicis, and the radialis indicis. (2) For the middle finger: the metacarpal, first dorsal interosseous by the branch which passes upwards to join the posterior carpal arch, and a branch from the deep palmar arch which joins the anterior carpal arch. (3) For the ring finger: the deep palmar arch and recurrent twigs from the second dorsal interosseous in the same manner as for the middle finger. (4) For the little finger: the ulnar and its deep branch; also twigs from the second dorsal interosseous. The nerves are supplied to these joints by the deep palmar branch of the ulnar, the posterior interosseous, and the median. The movements permitted at these joints, though slight, serve to increase those of the medio-carpal and wrist joints. The joint between the fifth metacarpal and the unciform bones approaches somewhat in shape and mobility the first carpo- metacarpal joint; it has a greater range of flexion and extension, but its lateral movement is nearly as limited as that of the three other metacarpal bones; the ! process of the unciform bone limits its flexion. Lateral motion towards the ulnar j side is checked by the strong palmar band which unites the base of the fifth \ metacarpal to the base of the third, and the strong transverse ligament at the head j of the bones. The mobility of the second, third, and fourth metacarpal bones j is very limited, and consists almost entirely of a slight gliding upon the carpal i bones, i.e. flexion and extension ; that of the third and fourth bones is extremely j slight, as there is no long flexor attached to either; but, owing to the close con- i nection of the bases of the metacarpal bones, the flexor and extensor radial and I ulnar muscles act on all by their pull on the particular bone into which they are i inserted. i Abduction, or movement toward the radial side, is prevented by the impaction ' of the second bone against the trapezium; a little adduction is permitted, and is \ favoured by the slope given to the unciform and fifth metacarpal bones. | There is also a slight gliding between the fourth and fifth bones, Avhen the | concavity they present towards the palm is deepened to form the ' cup of Diogenes.' i (b) The Caepo-metacaepal Joint of the Thumb Class.—Diarthrosis. Subdivision.—Arthroclia. The bones entering into this joint are the base of the first metacarpal, and the i trapezium. The first metacarpal bone diverges from the other four, contrasting : very strongly with the position of the great toe. It is due to this divergence that | the thumb is able to be opposed to each and all the fingers. The ligament which i unites the bones is the Capsular. . The capsular ligament (figs. 231 and 232) consists of fibres which pass from the margin of the articular facet on the trapezium, to the margin of the articular facet at the base of the first metacarpal bone. The fibres are stronger on the dorsal than on the palmar aspect. They are not tense enough to hold the bones in close contact, so that while they restrict they do not prevent motion in any direction. The internal fibres are stronger than the external. The synovial membrane is lax, and distinct from the other synovial membranes of the carpus. The arteries of the carpo-metacarpal joint of the thumb are derived from the trunk of the radial, the arteria princeps pollicis, and the dorsales pollicis.THE GABFO-METACABPAL JOINTS 255 The nerves are supplied by the branches of the median to the thumb. The movements of this joint are regulated by the shape of the articular surfaces, rather than by the ligaments, and consist of flexion, extension, abduction, adduc- tion, and circumduction. In flexion and extension the metacarpal bone slides to and fro upon the trapezium ; in abduction and adduction it slides from side to side or, more correctly, revolves upon the antero-posterior axis of the joint. The power of opposing the thumb to any of the fingers is due to the forward and inward obliquity of its flexion movement, which is by far its most extensive motion. Abduction is very free, while adduction is limited on account of the proximity of the second metacarpal bone. The movement of the trapezium upon the rest of the carpus somewhat increases the range of all the movements of the thumb. 9. THE INTEECARPAL ARTICULATIONS Class.—Diarthrosis. Subdivision.—Arthrodia. The metacarpal of the thumb is not connected with any other metacarpal bone. Those of the second, third, fourth, and fifth are in actual contact at their bases, and are held firmly together by the following ligaments :— Dorsal. Palmar. Interosseous ligaments. The dorsal ligaments (fig. 233) are layers of variable thickness of strong, short fibres, which pass transversely from bone to bone, filling up the irregularities on the dorsal surfaces. The palmar ligaments are transverse layers of ligamentous tissue passing from bone to bone ; they cannot be well defined from the other ligaments and fibrous tissue covering the bones. The interosseous ligaments (fig. 235) pass between the apposed surfaces of the bones, and are attached to the distal sides of the articular facets, so as to close in the synovial cavities on this aspect; where there are two articular facets, the fibres extend upwards between them, nearly as far as their carpal facets. That between the fourth and fifth is the weakest. The arteries to the intermetacarpal joints are twigs from the palmar and dorsal interosseous arteries ; the twigs pass upwards between the interosseous muscles. The nerves are derived from the ulnar and the posterior interosseous. The synovial membrane is prolonged downwards from the common carpal sac. The Union of the Heads of the Metacarpal Bones The distal extremities of these bones are connected together on their palmar aspects by what is called the transverse ligament. This consists of three short bands of fibrous tissue, which unite the second and third, third and fourth, and the fourth and fifth bones. They are rather more than a quarter of an inch (6 mm.) deep, and rather less in width, and limit the distance to which the metacarpal bones can be separated. They are continuous above with the fascia covering the inter- osseous muscles; below, they are connected with the subcutaneous tissue of the web of the band. They are on a level with the front surfaces of the bones, and are blended at either side with the edges of the glenoid ligament in front, with the lateral ligaments of the metacarpo-phalangeal joint, and also with the sheaths of the tendons. In front, a lumhrical muscle passes with the digital arteries and nerves; while behind, the interossei pass to their insertions.256 THE ABTICULATIONS 10. THE METACARPO-PHALANGEAL JOINTS (a) The Metacaepo-phalangeal Joints of the Four Inner Fingers Class.—Diarthrosis. Subdivision.—Ginglymus. In these joints the cup-shaped extremity of the base of the first phalanx fits on to the rounded head of the metacarpal bone, and is united by the following ligaments : — Lateral. Glenoid. The glenoid ligament (fig. 236) is a fibro-cartilaginous plate which seems more intended to increase the depth of the phalangeal articular facet in front, than to Fig. 236.—Anterior and Posterior View of Ligaments of the Fingers. unite the two bones. It is much more firmly attached to the margin of the phalanx than to the metacarpal bone, being only loosely connected with the palmar surface of the latter by some loose areolar tissue which covers in the synovial sac, here prolonged upon the surface of the bone some little distance. Laterally, it is connected with the lateral ligaments and the transverse metacarpal ligament. It corresponds to the sesamoid bones of the thumb ; a sesamoid bone sometimes exists at the inner border of the joint of the little finger. The lateral ligaments (figs. 235, 236) are strong and firmly connect the bones with one another ; each is attached above to the lateral tubercle, and to a depression in front of the tubercle, of the metacarpal bone. From this point the fibres spread widely as they descend on the side of the base of the phalanx ; the anterior fibres! THE METAGABPO-PHALANGEAL JOINTS 257 tre connected with the glenoid ligament; the posterior blend with the tendinous ixpansion at the back of the joint. The joint is covered in posteriorly by the expansion of the extensor tendon, and .ome loose areolar tissue passing from its under surface to the bones (fig. 236). The synovial sac is loose and capacious, more especially over the base of the )halanx behind, and the head of the metacarpal bone in front. I The arteries come from the digital or anterior interosseous vessels of the deep ^rch. The nerves are derived from the digital branches, or from twigs of the nerves to he interosseous muscles. The movements permitted at these joints are: flexion, extension, abduction, udduction, and circumduction. Flexion is the most free of all, and may be continued iiitil the phalanx is at a right angle with the metacarpal bone. It is on this .ccount that the articular surface of the head of the bone is prolonged so much [iirther on the palmar aspect, and that the synovial sac is here so loose and ample, {extension is the most limited of the movements, and can only be carried to a little beyond the straight line. Abduction and adduction are fairly free, but not so free lis flexion; as a rule, though these movements can be executed separately, flexion s associated with adduction, and extension with abduction. This may be proved by )pening the hand, when the fingers involuntarily separate as they extend, while in jiosing the fist they come together again. The free abduction, adduction, and circumduction which is permitted at these joints is due to the fact that the long ixes of the articular facets are at right angles to one another. {b) The Metacaepo-phalangeal Joint of the Thumb Class.—DiartJiTosis. Subdivision.—Ginglymus. The head of the metacarpal bone of the thumb differs considerably from the corresponding ends of the metacarpal bones of the fingers. It is less convex, vvider from side to side, the palmar edge of the articular surface is raised and irregular, and here on either side of the median line are the two facets for the sesamoid bones. The base of the first phalanx of the thumb, too, is more like the Dase of the second phalanx of one of the other fingers. The ligaments are :— I Lateral. Posterior. Sesamoid bones in place of a glenoid ligament. The lateral ligaments are short, strong bands of fibres, which radiate from jlepressions on either side of the head of the metacarpal bone to the base of the irst phalanx and sesamoid bones. As they descend they pass a little forwards, io that the greater number are inserted in front of the centre of motion. The posterior ligament consists of scattered fibres w^hich pass across the joint ';rom one lateral ligament to the other, completing the capsule and protecting the (Synovial sac. j The sesamoid bones are two in number, situated on either side of the middle 'ine, and connected together by strong transverse fibres which form the floor of the i^Toove for the long flexor tendon; they are connected with the base of the phalanx iindheadof the metacarpal bone by strong fibres. Anteriorly they give attach- nent to the short muscles of the thumb, and posteriorly are smooth for the purpose )f gliding over the facets. The lateral ligaments are partly inserted into their sides. The arteries and nerves come from the digital branches of the thumb. I The movements are chiefly flexion and extension, very little lateral movement j)eing permitted, and that only when the joint is slightly bent. Thus this joint is lnore gingiymoid than the corresponding articulations of the fingers. The thumb ! s258 THE ABTICULATIONS gets its freedom of motion at the carpo-metacarpal joint; the fingers get theirs at the metacarpo-phalangeal, but they have not so much freedom as the thuml enjoys. 11. THE INTEEPHALANGEAL ABTICULATIONS Class.—Diarthrosis. Subdivision.—Ginglyvms. The ligaments which unite the phalanges of the thumb and of the fingers are Glenoid. Lateral. The glenoid ligament (fig. 236), sometimes called the sesamoid body, is verj firmly connected with the base of the distal bone, and loosely, by means of fibro j areolar tissue, with the head of the proximal one. It blends with the latera, ligaments at the sides, and over it pass the flexor tendons. Occasionally a sesamoid bone is developed in the cartilage of the interphalangeal joint of the thumb. i The lateral ligaments (figs. 235 and 236) are strong bands which are attacheCj to the rough depressions on the sides of the upper phalanx, and to the projecting; lateral margins of the lower phalanx of each joint. They are tense in everi position, and entirely prevent any lateral motion ; they are connected posteriorlr with the expansion of the extensor tendon. Posteriorly (fig. 236) the joint is covered in by the deep surface of the extenso: tendon, and a little fibro-areolar tissue extends from the tendon, and thickens thr' posterior portion of the synovial sac, and completes the capsule. j The synovial membrane is loose and ample, and extends upwards a little waj along the shaft of the proximal bone. The arteries and nerves come from their respective digital branches. ' The movements are limited to flexion and extension. Flexion is more free, an(' can be continued till one bone is at right angles with the other, and is most fre j at the junction of the first and second bones ; the second phalanx can be flexed o]! the first through 110° to 115° when the latter is not flexed. The greater freedom o| flexion is due to the greater extent of the articular surface in front of the heads oj the proximal bones, and to the direction of the fibres of the lateral ligaments, whic] pass a little forwards to their insertion into the distal bone.

A thin strong sti-ataim is given off from its su^xa-lieial oct posteriorly, which extends beneath the gluteus minimus, and small rotators, le attached above to the dorsum of the ilium higher than the reflected tendon Qthe rectus, and behind to the ilium and ischium nearly as far as the sciatic K ch.

At the femur, the capsula r ligament is fixed to the anterior portion of the upper .ler of the great trochantei', and to the superior cervical tubercle. Thence it s down the spiral line as tar as the inner border of the femur, where it is on a '1 with the lower part ot" tlui lesser trochanter.

Superadded lo the capsul(>, and considerably strengthening it, are three a,uxi- liy bands, whose libi'es a,i'e intima,tely blended wuth, and in fact form part of, capsule, vi/. the ilio-femoraJ, ischio-fcMUoral, and pectineo-feinoi'al hands. The ilio-femoral (Jig. 2:}7) is the longest, widest, a,nd sti'ongest of the bands, s of triangukir shape, with the apex attached above to a cui'Ncd line on the ilium Unediately below and behind the anterior inferior spine, and its base below to the II'260 THE ABTICULATIONS anterior edge of the greater trochanter and to the spiral Hne as far as the inner borde of the shaft. The highest or outermost fibres are coarse, ahnost straight, and shorte than the rest; the innermost fibres are also thick and strong, but oblique. Thi varying obliquity of the fibres, and their accumulation at the borders, explains wh this band has been described as the Y-shaped ligament. About the centre of its bas( near the femoral attachment, is an aperture transmitting an articular twig froi' the transverse branch of the external circumflex artery. The ischio-femoral band (fig. 238) is formed of very strong fibres attached a along the upper border of the groove for the external obturator, and to the isclii;, margin of the acetabulum above the groove. The highest of these incline a littll Fig. 237.—Anterior View of the Capsule of the Hip Joint. upwards as they pass outwards to be fixed to the greater trochanter in front of t> insertion of the pyriformis tendon, while the other fibres curve more and me upwards as they pass outwards to their insertion at the inner side of the digill fossa, blending with the insertion of the external rotator tendons. When the joi' is in flexion these fibres pass in nearly straight lines to their femoral attachme and spread out uniformly over the head of the femur ; but in extension they w over the back of the femur in a zonular manner, embracing the posterior aspect the neck of the femur. The pectineo-femoral band (fig. 237) is a distinct but narrow set of fibres whi are individually less marked than the fibres of the other two bands ; they are fi. above to the anterior border of the pectineal eminence, reaching as far down as pubic end of the cotyloid notch. Below, they reach the neck of the femur, and fixed above and behind the lowermost fibres of the iho-femoral band, with whi they blend.261 THE HIP JOINT 111 thickness and strength the capsule varies greatly ; thus, if two lines be awn, one from the anterior inferior spine to the inner border of the femur near e lesser trochanter, and the other from the anterior part of the groove for the ternal obturator to the digital fossa, all the ligament between those lines on the iter and upper aspects of the joint is very thick and strong, and that below and the inner side, except at the narrow pectineo-femoral band, is thin and weak, so l.at the head of the bone can be seen through it. The capsule is thickest in the urse of the ilio-femoral band, towards the outer part of which it measures over a larter of an inch (6 mm.). Between the ilio-femoral and ischio-femoral bands e capsule is very strong, and with it here near the acetabulum is incorporated e reflected tendon of the rectus, and here also a triangular band of fibres runs 1 Fig. 238.—Posterior View of the Capsule of the Hip Joint. Eere are seen the re-- fleeted tendon of the rectus and the tri- angular ' ilio-trochan- I terie' band bwnwards and forwards to be attached by a narrow insertion to the ridge on fie front border of the greater trochanter near the gluteus minimus (the ilio- ochanteric band) (fig. 238). The capsule is strengthened here also by a strong band from the under surface (: the gluteus minimus, and by the tendino-trochanteric band which passes down om the reflected tendon of the rectus to the vastus externus (fig. 237). This closely blended with the capsule near the outer edge of the ilio-femoral ligament. 1 The thinnest part of the capsule is between the pectineo-femoral and ilio- imoral bands ; this is sometimes perforated, allowing the bursa under the psoas ) communicate with the joint. The capsule is also very thin at its attachment to |ie back of the femoral neck, and again opposite the cotyloid notch. I The ligamentum teres (figs. 239 and 240) is an interarticular flat band which vtends from the acetabular notch to the head of the femur, and is usually about262 THE ABTICULATIOXS an incli and a half (3'7 cm.) long. It lias two bony attachments, one on either sid( of the cotyloid notch immediately below the articular cartilage, while intermediati fibres spring from the mider surface of the transverse ligament. The ischia portion is the stronger, and has several of its fibres arising outside the ca-sity below and in connection with the origin of the transverse ligament, where it i also continuous with the capsule, and periosteum of the ischium. At the femur i is fixed to the front part of the depression on the head, and also to the cartilag. round the margins of the depression. It is covered by a prolongation of synovia membrane, which also covers the cushion of fat in the recess of the acetabulum the portion reflected over the fatty tissue does not cling closely to the rouiKl ligament, but forms a triangular fold, the apex of which is at the femur. ! The transverse ligament (fig. 241) passes across the cotyloid notch aiK converts it into a foramen; it supports part of the cotyloid fibro-cartilage, and i Fig. 239.—Section through the Hip Joint, showing the Cotyloid Ligament, LiGAMENTUM TeRES, AND KeTINACULA. connected with the ligamentum teres and the capsule. It is composed of decussaj ting fibres, which arise from the margin of the acetabulum on either side of th notch, those coming from the pubes being more superficial, and passing to fori the deep part of the ligament at the ischium, while those superficial at the ischial are deep at the pubes. It thus completes the rim of the acetabulum. The cotyloid fibro-cartilage (figs. 239, 240) is a yellowish-white structurt which deepens the acetabulum by surmounting its margin. It varies in strengt and thickness, but is stronger at its iliac and ischial portions than elsewhere. It^ base is broad and fixed to the bony rim as well as to the articular cartilage q the acetabulum on the inner, and the periosteum on the outer side of it, and blend inseparably with the transverse ligament which supports it over the cotyloi notch. Its free margin is thin; on section it is somewhat lunated, having ii] outer surface convex and its articular face concave and very smooth in adaptatioTHE HIP JOINT 263 the head of the bone, which it tightly embraces a httle beyond its greatest I'cumference. It somewhat contracts the aperture of the acetabiilmn, and retams .6 head of the femur within its grasp after division of the muscles and capsular rament. It is covered on both aspects by synovial membrane. The synovial membrane lines the capsule and both surfaces of the cotyloid j-ament, and passes over the border of the acetabulum to reach and cover the Fig. 240. -Hip-joint after dividing the Capsular Ligament and DISARTICULATING THE FeMUR.

The part covering the fatty cusliion is unusually phick, and is attached round the edges of the rough bony surface on which the jiushion rests. The membrane is loosely reflected off this on to the ligamentum jteres, along which it is prolonged to the head of the femur ; thus the fibres of the round ligament are shut out from the jomt cavity. From the capsule the synovial membrane is also reflected below on to the neck of the femur, passing over the L'etinacula to the margin of the articular cartilage.THE ABTICULATIONS 264 The arterial supply comes from (a) the transverse branches of the mternal and external circmnflex arteries ; ( b) the external branch of the obturator sends a branch through the cotyloid notch beneath the transverse ligament, which ramifies in the fat at the bottom of the acetabulum, and travels down the round ligament to the head of the femur ; (c) the inferior branch of the dee]) division of the gluteal; and {d) the sciatic arteries. The nerve-supply comes from (a) anterior crural, {b) anterior division of the obturator, (c) the accessory obturator, and [d] the sacral plexus, either by a twig from the nerve to the quadratus femoris, or from the upper part of the great sciatic or the lower part of the sacral plexus. The muscles in relation with the hip-joint are : in front, the psoas, which is separated from the capsule by a bursa, and the iliacus, which in part arises froir \ the capsule ; above are the straight and reflected tendons of the rectus, the re- flected tendon being enclosed between the layers of the capsule, and a band whict passes down from the reflected tendon to the vastus externus ; also the gluteui minimus, which is closely adherent to the capsule; above and behind are th( pyriformis, which sometimes sends a slip into the capsule ; the internal obturator which acts as a powerful strap to the back of the joint, and the two gemelli ; beloTX and behind is the external obturator, passing over the capsule,—a dense band o fibro-cellular tissue connects the sheath of the obturator externus with the capsuL along the posterior edge of the muscle ; internally is the pectineus. The movements.—The hip joint, like the shoulder, is a ball-and-socket joint but with a much more complete socket and a corresponding limitation of move ment. Each variety of movement is permitted, viz. flexion, extension, abduction adduction, circumduction, and rotation ; and any two or more of these movement not being antagonistic can be combined, i.e. flexion or extension associated witl abduction or adduction can be combined with rotation in or out. It results from the obliquity of the neck of the femur that the movements o| the head in the acetabulum are always more or less of a rotatory character. Thi' is more especially the case during flexion and extension, and two results follo"V; from it. First, the bearing surfaces of the femur and acetabulum preserve thei apposition to each other, so that the amount of articular surface of the head in th acetabulum does not sensibly diminish i^ari passu with the transit of the join from the extended to the flexed position, as would be the case necessarily if th movement of the femoral head, like that of the thigh itself, was simply angulai instead of rotatory and angular. Secondly, as rotation of the head can continuj until the ligaments are tight without being checked by contact of the neck of th thigh bone against the rim of the acetabulum, flexion of the thigh as far as th joint is concerned is practically unlimited. Flexion is the most important, mos frequent, and most extensive movement, and in the dissected limb, before th| ligaments are disturbed, can be carried to 160°, and is then checked by the lowej fibres of the ischio-femoral ligament. In the living subject simple flexion cai continue until checked by the contact of the soft parts at the groin, if the knee b bent; if the knee be straight, flexion of the hip is checked in most persons by th hamstring muscles at nearly the right angle. This is very evident on trying td touch the ground with the fingers without bending the knees, the chief straiii being felt at the popliteal space. This is due to the shortness of the hamstring£| Extension is limited by the ilio-femoral ligament. I Abduction and outward rotation can be performed freely in every position oj flexion and extension—abduction being limited by the pectineo-femoral ligament i outward rotation by the ilio-femoral ligament, especially its inner portion, durin^i extension ; but by the outer portion, as well as by the ligamentum teres, durinfj flexion. j Adduction and inward rotation are very limited in the extended thigh j i I265 THE HIP JOINT adduction on account of the contact with the opposite hmb ; the inward rotation, because all the muscles of internal rotation (save the tensor vagina femoris) are also extensors, whereas most of the other extensors are also outward rotators, so that each set requires to be relaxed by flexion before inward rotation can be perfected. Fig. 242.—Ligamentum Teres, lax in Flexion. Fig. 243.—Ligamentum Teres, very lax in complete Extension. I In the slightly flexed position adduction is more free, and is then limited by the outer fibres of the ilio-femoral band and the superior portion of the capsule. In flexion the range is still greater, and limited by the ischio-femoral ligament, the liga- mentum teres being also rendered nearly tight. In the nearly extended position,THE ARTICULATIONS 266 inward rotation is limited by the ilio-femoral ligament; and in flexion by the ischio-femoral ligament, and the portion of the capsule between it and the ilio- femoral band. The ilio-femoral band also prevents the tendency of the trunk to roll backwards on the thigh bones in the erect posture, and so does away with the necessity for muscular power for this purpose ; it is put on stretch in the stand-at-ease j position. I The ligamentum teres is of but very little use in resisting violence or giving j strength to the joint. It assists in checking rotation outwards and adduction Fig. 244.—Ligamentum Teres, drawn tight in Flexion combined with EOTATION outwards AND ADDUCTION. during flexion. A ligament can only be of use when it is tight, and it was found by trephining the bottom of the acetabulum, removing the fat, and threading a piece of whipcord round the ligament, that the ligament was slack in simple flexion, and very slack in complete extension, but that its most slack condition was in abduction. It is tightest in flexion combined with adduction and rotation outwards, and almost as tight in flexion with outward rotation alone, and in flexion with adduction alone (figs. 242 to 244). 2. THE KNEE JOINT Class.—Diarthrosis. Subdivision.—Ginglymus. The knee is the largest joint in the body. It is rightly described as a gingiy- moid joint, but there is also an arthrodial element; for, in addition to flexion and extension, there is a sliding backwards and forwardsJof the tibia upon the femoral condyles, as well as slight rotation round a vertical axis. It is one of the most superficial, and, as far as adaptation of the bony surfaces goes, one of the weakest joints, for in no position are the bones in more than partial contact. Its strength hes in the number, size, and arrangement of the ligaments, and the powerful muscles and fascial expansions which pass over the articulation and enable it to withstand the leverage of the two longest bones in the body. It may be said toTHE KNEE JOINT 267 consist of two articulations with a common synovial membrane—the patello- femoral and the tibio-femoral, the latter being double. It is composed of the condyles and trochlear surface of the femur, the tuberosities of the tibia, and the patella, united by the following ligaments, which may be divided into an external and internal set :— The fibrous expansion of the extensor tendons consists (1) of a central portion, densely thick and strong, an inch and a half (3-7 cm.) broad, which is inserted into the anterior two-thirds of the upper border of the patella, many of its superficial fibres passing over the subcutaneous surface of the bone into the ligamentum patellae ; (2) of two lateral portions thinner, but strong. The lateral portions are inserted into the patella along its upper border on either side of the central portion and also into its lateral borders, nearer the anterior than the posterior surface, as low down as the attachment of the ligamentum patellae ; passing thence along the sides of the ligamentum patellae to the tibia, they are attached to the oblique lines which extend laterally from the tubercle to the inner and outer tuberosities, and reach as far as the internal and external lateral ligaments. On the outer side the fibres blend with the ilio-tibial band of the fascia lata, and on the inner they extend below the oblique line to blend with the periosteum of the shaft. Thus there is a large hood spread over the whole of the front of the joint, investing the patella, and reaching from the sides of the ligamentum patella3 to the lateral ligaments, attached below to the tibia, and separated everywhere from the synovial membrane by a layer of fatty tissue. The ligamentum patellae (fig. 247) is simply the continuation of the central portion of the conjoined tendon, some fibres of which are prolonged over the front of the patella into the ligament. It is an extremely strong, flat band, attached above to the lower border of the patella ; below, it is fixed to the lower part of the tubercle and upper part of the crest of the tibia, somewhat obliquely, being pro- ' longed downwards further on the outer side, so that this border is fully an inch longer than the inner which measures two inches-and a half (3'7 cm.) in length. Behind, it is in contact with a mass of fat which separates it from the synovial I membrane, and a small bursa which intervenes between it and the upper part of the j tubercle of the tibia. In front, a large bursa separates it from the subcutaneous tissue, and laterally it is continuous with the fibrous expansion of the extensors. The internal lateral ligament (fig. 245) is a strong, flat band, which extends from the depression on the tubercle on the inner side of the internal condyle of the femur, to the inner border and internal surface of the shaft of the tibia, an inch and a half (3*7 cm.) below the tuberosity. It is three inches and a half (8'7 cm.) I long, well defined anteriorly, where it blends with the expansion of the conjoined extensor tendons; but not so well defined posteriorly, where it merges into the posterior ligament. Some of the lower fibres blend with the descending portion of I the semimemhranosiLS tendon. Its deep surface is firmly adherent to the edge of I the internal semilunar cartilage and coronary ligament, while part of the semi- I memhranosus tendon and inferior internal articular vessels and nerve pass between I it and the bone. Superficially, a bursa separates it from the tendons of the gracilis I and semitendinosus muscles and from the aponeurosis of the sartorius muscle.

Transverse.268 THE ARTICULATIONS The external lateral ligament (fig. 245) consists of t^YO portions : the anterior, which is best marked and longer, is a strong, rounded cord, about two inches (5 cm.) long, attached above to the tubercle on the outer side of the external condyle of the femur, just below and in front of the origin of the outer head of the gastrocnemms, the tendon of the ijoijliteus arising from the groove beloAv and in front of it. Below, it is fixed to the middle of the outer surface of the head of the fibula, half an inch (1*25 cm.) or more anterior to the styloid process. Super- ficially is the tendon of the biceps, which sphts to embrace its lower extremity; while deeper than it passes the popliteus tendon in its sheath, and the inferior external articular vessels and nerve. Some fibres of the peroneus longus occa- sionally arise from the lower end of the hgament. The posterior portion is a third Fig. 245.—Posterior View of the Kxee Joint. its the of an inch (8 mm.) behind the anterior. It is broader and less defined; fixed below to the|styloid process, it inclines upwards and somewhat backwards, and ties down the popliteus against the outer tuberosity, blending beneath the outer head of the gastrocnemins with the posterior ligament of which it is really a portion. The posterior ligament or ligamentum Winslowii (fig. 245) is a broad dense structure of interlacing fibres, Avith large orifices for vessels and nerves. It is ^ attached above to the femur close to the articular margins of the condyles, stretch- j ing across the upper margin of the intercondyloid notch, to which it is connected j by fibro-fatty tissue ; it thus reaches across from the internal to the external j lateral ligaments. Below, it is fixed to the border of the outer tuberosity of the j tibia, to the bone just below the po^^liteal notch, and to the shaft of the tibia | below the inner tuberosity, blending with the descending slip of the semi- jTHE KNEE JOINT 269 memhranosus and internal lateral ligament. Superficially, an oblique fasciculus from the semimembranosus runs across the centre, passing upwards and outwards from near the back part of the inner tuberosity of the tibia to the external condyle of the femur where it joins the outer head of the gastrocnemius, a sesamoid plate being sometimes developed at the point of junction. This slip greatly strengthens the posterior ligament, of which, if not the chief constituent, it is at least a very important part. Its deep surface is closely connected with the semilunar cartilages (especially the inner), and coronary ligaments, and in the interval between the cartilages with Fig. 24G.—Anterior View of the Internal Ligaments of the Knee Joint. Posterior crucial ligament Internal semiliinar flbro-cartilage Transverse ligament Coronary ligament the posterior crucial ligament and fibro-fatty tissue within the joint. Superficially it forms part of the floor of the popliteal space. The capsular or anterior ligament (fig. 246) is thin but strong, covering the synovial membrane under the quadriceps extensor tendon, and looking like a loose sac. It is attached to the femur near the articular margin on the inner side, but further away on the outer ; it passes beneath the external lateral ligament to join the sheath of theiJojjliteus. Internally it joins the internal lateral ligament. Below, it is fixed to the upper and lateral borders of the patella and the anterior border of the head of the tibia. It is strengthened superficially between the femur and patella by an expansion from the suhcrureus, and is separated from the fibrousTRE ABTICULATIONS 270 expansion of the extensor tendon by a layer of fatty tissue. The synovial membrane lines its deep surface, and holds it against the borders of the semilunar cartilages; it is also attached to the coronary ligaments. ! The anterior crucial ligament (figs. 246 and 247) is strong and cord-like. It is attached to the inner half of the fossa in front of the spine of the tibia, and to the | outer border of the inner articular facet as far back as the inner tubercle of the spine. It passes upwards, backwards, and outwards to the back part of the in- ternal surface of the external condyle. To the tibia, it is fixed behind the anterior extremity of the internal semilunar cartilage. Behind and to the outer side it has 1 the anterior extremity of the external semilunar cartilage, a few fibres of which blend with the outer edge of the ligament. Its anterior fibres at the tibial end are strongest and longest, being fixed highest on the femur; while the posterior, springing from the spine, are shorter and more oblique. Near the spine, a slip is sometimes given off to the posterior crucial. The posterior crucial ligament (figs. 246, 247, and 248) is stronger and less oblique than the anterior. It is fixed below to the greater portion of the fossa behind the spine of the tibia, especially the outer and posterior portion, and then inwards and upwards along the popliteal notch ; being joined by fibres which arise i Fig. 247.—Structures lying on the Head of the Tibia. (Eight knee.) between the tubercles of the spine, it ascends to the anterior part of the outer surface of the inner condyle, having a wide crescentic attachment more than half an inch (1*5 cm.) in extent just above the articular surface. Behind, it is connected at the tibia directly with the posterior ligament, and a little higher up by means of a quantity of interposed areolar tissue. In front it rests upon the posterior horn of the internal semilunar cartilage, and receives a large slip from the external cartilage, which runs up along it either in front, or behind to the femur; higher up in front it is connected with the anterior crucial ligament. Until they rise above the spine of the tibia the two crucial ligaments are closely bound together, so that no interspace exists betw^een their tibial attachments and the point of decussation; the only space between them is therefore a V-shaped one corresponding to the upper half of their X-shaped arrangement, and this is a mere chink in the undissected state, and can be seen from the front only, owing to the fatty tissue beneath the synovial membrane which surrounds their femoral attachment. The interarticular or semilunar fibro-cartilages (figs. 246, 247) are two cre- scentic plates resting upon the circumferential portions of the articular facets of theTHE KNEE JOINT 271 tibia, and moving with the tibia upon the femur. They somewhat deepen the tibial articular surfaces, and are dense and compact in structure, becoming looser and more fibrous near their extremities, where they are firmly fixed in front of and -behind the spine of the tibia. The circumferential border of each is convex, thick, and somewhat loosely attached to the borders of the tuberosities of the tibia by the coronary ligaments, and the reflexion of the synovial membrane. The inner border is concave, thin, and free. Half an inch (1*3 cm.) broad at the widest part, they taper somewhat towards their extremities, and cover rather less than two-thirds of the articular facets of the tibia. Their upper surfaces are slightly concave, and fit on to the femoral condyles, while the lower are fiat and rest on the head of the tibia; both surfaces are smooth and covered by synovial membrane.

Posterior crucial Ligamentum mvieosiim Alar ligament Synovial'-poueli under ten- don^of quadriceps extensor Alar ligament The external semilunar cartilage (fig. 247) is nearly circular in form and less firmly fixed than the internal, and consequently slides more freely upon the tibia. Its anterior cornu is attached to a narrow depression along the outer articular facet, just in front of the external tubercle of the tibial spine, close to, and on the outer side of, the anterior crucial ligament; a small slip from the cornu is often fixed to the tibia in front of the crucial ligament. The posterior cornu is firmly attached to the tibia behind the external tubercle of the spine, blending with the posterior crucial ligament, and giving off a well-marked fasciculus, which runs up along the anterior border of the ligament to be attached to the femur (ligament of Wrisberg). It also sends a narrow slip into the back part of the anterior crucial ligament. Its outer border is grooved towards its posterior part by the pojjliteus tendon, which is held to it by fibrous tissue and synovial membrane, and separates it from272 THE ABTIGULATIONS \ the external lateral ligament. From its anterior border is given off the transverse] ligament. | The internal semilunar cartilage (fig. 247) is a segment of a larger circle than the i external, and has an outline more oval than circular. Its anterior cornu is wide, and i has a broad and oblique attachment to the anterior margin of the head of the tibia, i It reaches backwards and outwards from the margin of the tuberosity towards the' middle of the fossa in front of the tibial spine, being altogether in front of the I anterior crucial ligament. The posterior cornu is firmly fixed by a broad insertion in an antero-posterior line along the inner side of the posterior fossa, from the internal i tubercle of the spine to the posterior margin of the head of the tibia, Its convex! border is connected with the internal lateral ligament and the semimemhranosus\ tendon. i The transverse ligament (figs. 246 and 247) is a rounded, slender, short cord,; which extends from the convex border of the external semilunar cartilage to the! concaA'C border or anterior cornu of the internal, near which it is sometimes attached; to the bone. It is an accessory band of the external cartilage, and is situated j beneath the synovial membrane. ! The coronary ligaments (fig. 246) connect the margins of the semilunari fibro-cartilages Avith the head of the tibia. The external is much more laxj than the internal, permitting the outer cartilage to change its position more freely' than the inner. They are not in reality separate structures, but consist of fibres of the several surrounding ligaments of the knee joint which become attached to,| as they pass over the margins of the fibro-cartilages. i The synovial membrane (fig. 249) of the Imee forms the largest synovial sac ini the body. Bulging upwards from the patella, it follows the capsule of the joint| into a large cul-de-sac beneath the tendon of the extensor muscles on the front of j the femur. It reaches some distance beyond the articular surface of the bone,| and communicates very frequently with a large bursa interposed between the| tendon and the femur above the line of attachment of the capsular ligament.] After investing the circumference of the lower end of the femur, it is reflected] upon the fibrous envelope of the joint formed by the capsular, posterior, and] lateral ligaments. It covers a great portion of the crucial ligaments, but leaves] uncovered the back of the posterior crucial where the latter is connected with' the posterior ligament, and the lower part of both crucial ligaments where] they are united. Thus the ligaments are completely shut out of the synovial ca\dty.| Along the fibrous envelope the synovial membrane is conducted down to the semi-j lunar cartilages, over both surfaces of which it passes, and is reflected oft' the under surface on to the coronary ligaments, and thence down to the head of the tibia, around the circumference of which it extends a short way. It dips down between the external cartilage and the head of the tibia as low as the superior tibio-fibular ligament, reaching inwards nearly as far as the popliteal notch, and forming a bursa for the play of the popliteal tendon. i At the back of the joint two pouches are prolonged beneath the muscles, one on each side between the condyle of the femur and the origin of the gastrocnemius, i Large processes of synovial membrane also project into the joint, and being occupied by fat serve as padding to fill up spaces. The chief of these processes, the ligamentum mucosum (figs. 248 and 249) springs from the infrapatellar fatty mass. This so-called ligament is the central portion of the large process of synovial membrane, of which the alar ligaments form the lateral free margins. Itl extends from the fatty mass, below the patella, backwards and upwards to thej intercondyloid notch of the femur, where it is attached in front of the anteriorj crucial, and to the outer side of the posterior crucial ligament. Near the femurj it is thin and transparent, consisting of a double fold of synovial membrane, butj near the patella it contains some fatty tissue. Its anterior or upper edge is free,|273 THE KNEE JOINT ,nd fully an inch (2*5 cm.) long ; the posterior or lower edge is half the length, ,nd is attached to the crucial ligaments above, but is free below. Passing backwards from the capsule on each side of the patella is a prominent rescentic fold formed by reduplications of the synovial membrane—these are the ,lar ligaments (fig. 248). Their free margins are concave and thin, and are lost telow in the ligamentum mucosum. There is a slight fossa above and another )elow each ligament. ^^iG. 249.—Vertical Section of the Knee Joint in the Antero-posterior Direction* Fatty tissue- Opening in synovial membrane behind crucial ligament leading into inner half of joint Synovial membrane, reflected oflF crueials Cut end of anterior crucial ligament Posterior crucial ligament Ligament of Winslow Muscular fibres of quadriceps extensor Extension of synovial sac of knee upon femur Tendon of quadriceps ex- tensor, forming fibrous capsule of joint Pre-patellar bursa.

The great sciatic gives off the internal and external popliteal; the mternal popliteal sends two, sometimes three branches—one with the azygos artery ; one274 THE ABTICULATIONS with the inferior internal, and sometimes one with the superior internal articular artery ; the external popliteal gives a branch w^hich accompanies the superior, and another which accompanies the inferior articular artery, and a recurrent branch which follows the course of the anterior recurrent branch of the anterior tibial Fig. 250.—The Lateral Ligaments of the Knee in Flexion and Extension. IfS. iflDI it I f0 fie ieul artery. The anterior crural sends an articular branch from the nerve to thij vastus externus; a second from the nerve to the vastus internus ; and sometimej a third from that to the crureus. Thus there are three articular twigs to th(| knee derived from the muscular branches of the anterior crural (Roger WilHamEj Journ. Anat. Physiol., 1874). The obturator by its deep division sends a branclj pes ilai Ic Is275 THE KNEE JOINT irough the adductor magnus on to the popliteal artery, which enters the joint irough the posterior ligament. The movements which occur at the knee joint are flexion and extension, with )ine slight amount of pronation and supination in the bent position. These lovements are not so simple as the corresponding ones at the elbow, for the knee i not a simple hinge joint, and pronation and supination, instead of occurring etween the tibia and fibula, as between the radius and ulna, are movements of the bia with the fibula upon the condyles of the femur. The knee differs from a true hinge joint, like the elbow or ankle, in the following articulars :— 1. The points of contact of the femur with the tibia are constantly changing, 'bus, in the flexed position, the hinder part of the articular surface of the tibia is 1 contact with the rounded back part of the condyles ; in the semiflexed position Fig. 251.—Section of Knee, showing Crucials in Extension. Anterior crucial SPINE OF TIBIA Transverse ligament Slip from external fibro- cartilage to femur (liga- ment of V/risberg) Posterior crucial ligament External semilunar cartilage Coronary Ligament Antero-superior tibio-fibular ligament he middle parts of the tibial facets articulate with the anterior rounded part of the ! ondyles; while in the fully extended position the anterior and middle parts of the ibial facets are in contact with the flattened anterior portion of the condyles. So yith the patella : in extreme flexion the inner articular facet rests on the outer part of the internal condyle of the femur ; in flexion the upper pair of facets rest •n the lower part of the trochlear surface of the femur ; in mid-flexion the middle pair rest on the middle of the trochlear surface ; while in extension the lower pair of 'acets on the patella rest on the upper portion of the trochlear surface of the femur. This difference may be described as the shifting of the points of contact of the firticular surface. 2. It difi:ers from a true hinge in that, in passing from a state of extension to )ne of flexion, the tibia does not revolve round a single transverse axis drawn hrough the lower end of the femur, as the ulna does round the lower end of the T 2276 THE ARTICULATIONS humerus. The articular surface of the tibia shdes forwards in extension anc backwards in flexion ; thus the axis round which the tibia revolves upon th( femur is a shifting one, as is seen b}^ reference to fig. 250, B, C, D. 3. Another point of difference is that extension is accompanied by rotatioi outwards, and flexion by rotation inwards, This rotation occurs round a vertical axis drawn through the middle of the outer condyle of the femur and the oute ^ tuberosity of the tibia, and is most marked at the termination of extension and a the commencement of flexion. This rotation of the leg at the knee is a trua rotation about a vertical axis, and thus differs from the obliquity of the flexion anq extension movements at the elbow which is due to the oblique direction of th| articular surfaces of the bones. 4. The antero-posterior spiral curve of the femoral condyles is such, that th anterior part is an arc of a greater circle than the posterior ; hence certain ligament which are tightened during extension are relaxed during flexion, and thereby Fig. 252.—Crucial Ligaments in Flexion. considerable amount of rotatory movement is permitted in the flexed positioi This is called pronation and supination. The axis of this rotation is vertical, an passes through the inner tubercle of the spine of the tibia, so that the outt tuberosity moves in the arc of a larger circle than does the inner, and is therefoi required to move more freely and easily ; hence the shape of the external articula facet and the loose connection of the external semilunar cartilage which is adapte to it. In extension, all the ligaments are on the stretch with the exception of ttj ligamentum patellae and front of the capsule. Extension is checked by both tJ crucial ligaments and the lateral ligaments (figs. 250, A, B, and 251). In flexion the ligamentum patellae and anterior portion of the capsule are o the stretch; so also is the posterior crucial in extreme flexion, though it is n quite tight in the semiflexed state of the joint. All the other ligaments a relaxed (fig. 250, C, D), although the relaxation of the anterior crucial ligamentTHE KNEE JOINT 271 ight in extreme flexion (fig. 252). Flexion is only checked during life by the ' ntact of the soft parts, i.e. the calf with the back of the thigh. Pronation, or inward rotation, is checked by the anterior crucial ligament; the jteral ligaments being loose. I Supination, or outward rotation, is checked by the lateral ligaments ; the crucial ^aments have no controlling effect on it, as they are untwisted by it. Sliding movements are checked by the crucials and lateral ligaments—sliding rwards especially by the anterior, and sliding backwards by the posterior crucial. 3. THE TIBIO-FIBULAK UNION The fibula is connected with the tibia throughout its length by an interosseous embrane, and at the upper and lower extremities by means of two joints. Very tie movement is permitted between the two bones. (a) The superior tibio-fibular joint. I (b) The middle tibio-fibular union. * (c) The inferior tibio-fibular joint. (a) The Superior Tibio-fibular Joint Class.—Diarthrosis. Subdivisior.—Arth rodia. The superior tibio-fibular joint is about a quarter of an inch (6 mm) below, and 'te distinct from, the knee at its upper and anterior part ; but at its posterior and perior aspect, where the border of the outer tuberosity of the tibia is bevelled f the popliteus muscle, the joint is in the closest proximity to the bursa beneath e tendon of that muscle, and is only separated from the knee-joint by a thin ptum of areolar tissue. There is often a communication between the synovial vities of the two joints. The ligaments uniting the bones are :— Capsular. Anterior tibio-fibular. Posterior tibio-fibular. The capsular lig^ament is a well-marked fibro-areolar structure ; it is attached ose round the articular margins of the tibia and fibula, on the latter bone "tending a little distance from the margin behind and below. In front it is shut completely from the knee-joint by the capsule of the knee and the coronary ament; but behind, it is often very thin, and may communicate with the bursa der the popliteus tendon. The anterior tibio-fibular ligament (fig. 251) consists of a few fibres which ss upwards and inwards from the fibula to the tibia. It lies beneath the terior portion of the tendon of the biceps. The posterior tibio-fibular ligament (fig. 245) consists of a few fibres which ss upwards and inwards between the adjacent bones, from the head of the fibula ) the outer tuberosity of the tibia. The superior interosseous ligament consists of a mass of dense yellow fibro- "eolar tissue, binding the opposed surfaces of the bones together for three-quarters an inch (2 cm.) below the articular facets. It is continuous with the interosseous embrane along the tibia. The biceps tendon is divided by the long external lateral ligament of the knee ; the two divisions the anterior is byfar the stronger, and is attached to the xternal tuberosity of the tibia as well as to the front of the head of the fibula, and aiis the muscle, acting on both bones, tends to brace them tighter together ; indeed, ' holds the bones strongly together after all other connections have been severed.THE ABTICULATIONS 278 The synovial membrane which hues the jomt sometimes commmiicates witli the knee joint through the hiirsa beneath the pophteus tendon. 1 The arterial supply is from the inferior external articular and recurrent tibia arteries. I The nerve-supply is from the inferior external articular, and also from th*' recurrent branch of the external popliteal. i The movements are but slight, and consist merely of a gliding of the two bone:! upon one another. The joint is so constructed that the fibula gives some supper to the tibia in transmitting the weight to the foot. The articular facet of thi tibia overhangs, and is received upon the articular facet of the head of tb fibula in an oblique plane. This joint allows of slight yielding of the externa malleohis during flexion and extension of the ankle joint, the whole fibula glidiii; slightly upwards in flexion, and downwards in extension of the ankle. (b) The Middle Tibio-fibulak Union The interosseous membrane is attached all along the outer border of the tibia ain the interosseous border of the fibula. It is deficient above for about an inch (2*5 cm. or more, measured from the under aspect of the superior joint. Its upper horde is concave, and over it pass the anterior tibial vessels. The membrane consists o a thin aponeurotic and translucent lamina, formed of oblique fine fibres, some c which run from the tibia to the fibula, and some from the fibula to the tibia, bii all are inclined downwards. They are best marked at their attachment to th bones, and gradually grow denser and thicker as they approach the inferio interosseous ligament. The chief use of the membrane is to afford a surface for th origin of muscles. It is continuous below with the inferior interosseous ligament.! (c) The Infekior Tibio-fibulak Articulation | Class.—DiartJiTosis. Subdivision.—Arthrodia. This junction is formed by the lower ends of the tibia and fibula. The roug triangular surface on each of these bones formed by the bifurcation of their intei: osseous lines is closely and firmly united by the inferior interosseous ligamen The fibula is in actual contact with the tibia by an articular facet, which is sma, in size, crescentic in shape, and continuous with the articular facet of the malleolu;! The ligaments which unite the bones are :— i 1. Anterior inferior tibio-fibular ligament. I 2. Posterior inferior tibio-fibular ligament. : 3. Transverse ligament. 4. Inferior interosseous ligament. j The anterior inferior tibio-fibular ligament (fig. 255) is a strong triangular ban about three-quarters of an inch (2 cm.) wide, and is attached to the lower extremity <\ ; the tibia at its anterior and external angle, close to the margin of the facet for tl' astragalus, and passes downwards and outwards to the anterior border and coi tiguous surface of the lower end of the fibula, some fibres passing along the ed^j nearly as far as the origin of the anterior fasciculus of the external lateral lig; : ment. The fibres increase in length from above downwards. In front it is in relatic* with the ijeroneus terthis and deep fascia of the leg, and gives origin to fibr; of the anterior ligament of the ankle joint. Behind, it lies in contact with tl' : interosseous ligament, and comes into contact with the articular surface of tli i astragalus. j The posterior inferior tibio-fibular ligament (figs. 254, 255) is very similar !279 THE TIBIO-FIBULAB UNION le anterior, extending from the posterior and external angle of the lower end f the tibia downwards and outwards to the lowest half-inch (l'e5 cm.) of the border sparating the internal from the posterior surface of the shaft of the fibula, and to iie upper part of the posterior border of the external malleolus. It is in relation 1 front with the interosseous ligament; below, it touches the transverse ligament. The inferior interosseous ligament is a dense mass of short felt-like fibres, assing transversely between and firmly uniting the opposed rough triangular urfaces at the lower ends of the tibia and fibula, except for three-eighths of an jach (1 cm.) at the extremity, where there is a synovial cavity. It extends from [he anterior to the posterior tibio-fibular ligaments, reaching upwards an inch and , half in front (4 cm.), but only half this height behind. The transverse ligament (fig. 254) is a strong rounded band, attached to nearly he whole length of the inferior border of the posterior surface of the tibia, just above he articular facet for the astragalus. It then inclines a little forwards and down- wards, to be attached to the internal surface of the external malleolus, just above he fossa, and also into the upper part of the fossa itself. The synovial membrane is continuous with that of the ankle-joint; it projects ipwards between the bones beyond their articular facets as high as the inferior nterosseous ligament. The nerve-supply is the same as that of the ankle-joint ; the arterial supply is I'rom the peroneal and the anterior peroneal, and sometimes from the anterior ibial, or its external malleolar branch. i The movement permitted at this joint is a mere gliding, chiefly in an upward Lnd downward direction, of the fibula on the tibia. The bones are firmly braced lOgether and yet form a slightly yielding arch, thus allowing a slight lateral V expansion during extreme flexion, when the broad part of the astragalus is brought |mder the arch, by the upward gliding of the fibula on the tibia. To this end the 'lirection of the fibres of the superior and inferior tibio-fibular ligaments is down- yards from tibia to fibula. This mechanical arrangement secures perfect contact )f the articular surfaces of the ankle joint in all positions of the foot. I • 4. THE ANKLE JOINT I I Class.—Diarthrosis. Subdivision.—Ginglymus. I The ankle is a perfect ginglymus or hinge joint. The bones which enter into is formation are : the lower extremity and internal malleolus of the tibia, and lihe external malleolus of the fibula, above ; and the upper and lateral articular surfaces of the astragalus below. The ligaments uniting the bones are:— Anterior. Internal lateral, i Posterior. External lateral. MThe anterior ligament (figs. 253, 255) is a thin membranous structure, which extends between the lateral ligaments. It is attached above to the anterior border ;of the internal malleolus, to a crest of bone just above the transverse groove at the bwer end of the tibia, to the anterior inferior tibio-fibular ligament, and to the ;interior border of the external malleolus. Below, it is attached to the rough upper surface of the neck of the astragalus, in front of the fossa. Internally it is thicker, and is fixed to the astragalus close to the facet for the inner malleolus, being continuous with the internal lateral ligament, and passing forwards to blend with the dorsal astragalo-scaphoid ligament. Externally it is attached to the astragalus, just below and in front of the angle between the superior and lateral [facets, close to their edges, and joins the anterior fasciculus of the external lateral [ligament. It is in relation, in front with the tibialis anticus muscle, the anterior280 THE ABTICULATIONS \ tibial vessels and nerve, the extensor tendons of the toes, and the peroneus tertius; | and behind with a mass of fat and synovial membrane. | The posterior ligament (fig. 254) is a very thin and disconnected membranous structure, connected above with the external malleolus, internal to the peroneal groove ; to the posterior margin of the lower end of the tibia external to the groove for the tibialis posticus ; and to the posterior inferior tibio-fibular ligament. Below, i ** it is attached to the posterior surface of the astragalus from the internal to the I 1* external ligaments. The passage of the flexor longus hallucis tendon over the back I of the joint serves the purpose of a much stronger posterior ligament. • { " The internal lateral or deltoid ligament (fig. 253) is attached superiorly to the' internal malleolus along its lower border, and to its anterior surface superficial! to the anterior ligament; some very strong fibres are fixed to the notch in the lower i ''^ border of the malleolus, and, getting attachment below to the rough depression on; Fig. 253.—Inner View of the Ankle and the Tarsus, showing the Groove .

The middle fasciculus is a trong roundish bundle, which extends downwards and somewhat backwards from be anterior border of the external malleolus close to the attachment of the anterior isciculus, and from the outer surface of the malleolus, just in front of the apex, D a tubercle on the middle of the outer surface of the calcaneum. The posterior isciculus is almost horizontal; it is a strong, thick band attached at one end to tie posterior border of the malleolus, and slightly to the fossa on the internal arface ; and at the other end to the astragalus, behind the articular facet for the bula, as well as to a tubercle on the outer side of the groove for the flexor longtis .allucis. The middle fasciculus is covered by the tendons of the jjeronei longus nd hrevis ; and in extension, the posterior fasciculus is received into the pit on he inner surface of the external malleolus.

Posterior ligament of ankle joint Posterior part of the internal lateral ligament The lower part of the inter- osseous membrane seen be- tween the bones Transverse ligament of inferior tibio-fibular joint Posterior fasciculus of external lateral ligament Middle fasciculus of external lateral ligament The synovial membrane is very extensive. Besides lining the Hgaments of the nkle, it extends upwards between the tibia and fibula, forming a short cul-de-sac LS far as the interosseous ligament. Upon the anterior and posterior ligaments it is ^ery loose, and extends beyond the limits of the articulation. It is said to contain nore synovia than any other joint. The nerve-supply is from the internal saphenous, posterior tibial, and the Jxternal division of the anterior tibial. The arterial supply comes from the anterior tibial, the anterior peroneal, the Bxternal malleolar, the posterior tibial, and posterior peroneal. Movements.—This being a true hinge-joint, flexion and extension are the only movements of which it is capable, there being no lateral motion, except in extreme xtension, when the narrowest part of the astragalus is thrust forwards into the re.' .| leiiti 0282 THE ARTICULATIONS widest part of the tibio-fibular arcli. In flexion the astragalus is tightly embraced by the malleoli, and lateral movement is impossible. Flexion is limited by : (i) nearly the whole of the fibres of the internal lateral ligament, none but the most anterior being relaxed ; (ii) tlie posterior and middle portions of the external lateral ligament, especially the posterior ; (iii) the posterior ligament of the ankle. It is also limited by the neck of the astragalus abutting on the edge of the tibia, i Extension is limited by : (i) the anterior fibres of the internal lateral ligament ; (ii) the anterior and middle portions of the external lateral ligament ; (iii) the inner and stronger fibres of the anterior ligament. It is also limited by the posterior portion of the astragalus meeting Avith the tibia. Thus the middle portion of the external lateral ligament is always on the stretch, owing to its obliquely backward direction, whereby it limits flexion; audits attachment to the fibula in front of the malleolar apex, whereby it prevents over-extension as soon as the foot begins to twist inwards. This inward twisting, or adduction of the foot, is partly due to the greater posterior length of the inner border of the superior articular surface of the astragalus, and to the less proportionate height posteriorly of the external border of that surface, but chiefly to the lateral movement in the calcaneo-astragaloid joints. Flexion and extension take place round a transverse axis drawn through the body of the^ astragalus. The movement is not in a direct antero-posterior plane, but on a plane inclined forwards and outwards from the middle of the astragalus to the inter- metatarsal joint of the second and third toes. 5. THE TARSAL JOINTS These may again be divided up into the following sub-groups :— j (a) The calcaneo-astragaloid union. {b) The articulations of the anterior portion of the tarsus, (c) The medio-tarsal joint. (a) The Calcaneo-asteagaloid Union Class. Diartlirosis. Subdivision.—Arthrodia. There are two joints which enter into this union—viz. an anterior and ; posterior. (i) TJie Posterior Calcaneo-astragaloid Joint The calcaneum articulates with the astragalus by two joints, the anterior an( posterior : the former communicates with the medio-tarsal; the posterior is separat and complete in itself. The two bones are united by the following ligaments :— Interosseous. External calcaneo-astragaloid. Posterior calcaneo-astragaloid. Internal calcaneo-astragaloid. The interosseous ligament (figs. 255, 256) is a strong band connecting the appose surfaces of the calcaneum and astragalus along their oblique grooves. It is compose of several vertical laminae of fibres, with some fatty tissue in between. It is bettt marked, deeper, and broader externally. Strong laminae extend from the roug inferior and external surfaces of the neck of the astragalus to the rough superio surface of the os calcis anteriorly, forming the posterior boundary of the anteric calcaneo-astragaloid joint; these have been described as the anterior interosseor ligament. The posterior lamina extend from the roof of the sinus pedis t the OS calcis immediately in front of the external facet, thus forming the anteric part of the capsule of the posterior joint. The external calcaneo-astragaloid ligament (fig. 255) extends from the groo\ just below and in front of the external articular facet of the astragalus to the os calcTHE TABSAL JOINTS 283 some little distance from the articular margin. Its fibres are nearly parallel with 1 those of the middle fasciculus of the external lateral ligament of the ankle, which passes over it and adds to its strength. It fills up the interval between the middle I and anterior fasciculus of the external lateral ligament, a considerable bundle of its i fibres blending with the anterior border of the middle fasciculus. I The posterior calcaneo-astragaloid ligament passes from the external tubercle [ and lower edge of the groove for the flexor longus hallucis to the os calcis, a variable distance from the articular margin. The internal calcaneo-astragaloid ligament (fig. 253) is a narrow band of well- marked fibres passing obliquely downwards and backwards from the depression on the astragalus, just behind the inner end of the sinus pedis, to the os calcis behind the sustentaculum tali, thus completing the floor of the groove. The synovial sac is distinct from any other. The nerve-supply is from the posterior tibial or one of its plantar branches. The arteries are, a branch from the posterior tibial, which enters at the inner end of the sinus pedis; and twigs from the tarsal, external malleolar, and the peroneal, which enter at the outer end of the sinus. (ii) The Anterior Calcaneo-astragaloid Joint This joint is formed by the anterior facet on the upper surface of the os calcis and the facets on the lower surface of the neck and head of the astragalus ; it is bounded laterally and behind by ligaments, and communicates anteriorly with the astragalo-scaphoid joint. The ligaments are :— Interosseous. Internal (or antero-internal) calcaneo-astragaloid. External calcaneo-scaphoid. The interosseous ligament by its anterior laminae limits this joint posteriorly. It has been already described (p. 282). The antero-internal calcaneo-astragaloid ligament consists of short fibres attached above to the rough depression on the internal surface of the neck of the astragalus, and below to the upper edge of the free border of the sustentaculum tali, blending posteriorly with the inner extremity of the interosseous ligament, and anteriorly with the upper border of the inferior calcaneo-scaphoid ligament. It is strengthened by the internal lateral ligament, the anterior fibres of which are also attached to the inferior calcaneo-scaphoid ligament. The external calcaneo-scaphoid (superior calcaneo-scaphoid. Gray) (figs. 255, 256) limits this, as well as the astragalo-scaphoid joint, on the outer side. It is a strong, well-marked band, extending from the rough upper surface of the calcaneum, external to the anterior facet, to a slight groove on the outer surface of the scaphoid near the posterior margin. It blends below with the inferior calcaneo- I scaphoid, and above with the astragalo-scaphoid ligament. Its fibres run obliquely [ forwards and inwards. The internal lateral and middle fasciculus of the external I lateral ligaments of the ankle joint also add to the security of these two joints, and assist in limiting movements between the bones by passing over the astragalus to the OS calcis. The movements of which these two joints are capable are adduction and abduc- tion, with some amount of rotation. Adduction, or inclination of the sole inwards, being combined with some rotation of the toes inwards, and of the heel outwards ; while abduction, or inclination of the foot outwards, is associated with turning of the toes outwards and the heel inwards. Thus the variety and the range of move- ments of the foot on the leg, which at the ankle are almost limited to flexion and extension, are increased. The cuboid moves with the calcaneum, while the scaphoid revolves on the head of the astragalus.284 THE ARTICULATIONS t j In walking, the heel is first placed on the ground ; the foot is slightly adducted ; \ but as the body swings forwards, first the outer then the inner toes touch the ground, I the astragalus presses against the scaphoid and sinks upon the spring ligament; ! the foot then becomes slightly abducted. When the foot is firmly placed on the j ground, the weight is transmitted to it obliquely downwards and inwards, so that ! if the ligaments between the calcaneum and astragalus did not check abduction, j inward displacement of the astragalus from the tibio-fibular arch would only be I prevented by the tendons passing round the inner ankle (especially the tibialis i posticus). If the ligaments be too weak to limit abduction, the weight of the body i increases it, and forces the inner malleolus and astragalus downwards and inwards, ' giving rise to flat foot. ! I Fig. 255.—External View of the Ligaments of the Foot and Ankle. Internal ealcaneo-cutaoid Dorsal External Middle fasciculus of external lateral i caleaneo- caleaneo- ligament of the ankle cuboid astragaloid ligament The advantages of the obliquity and peculiar arrangement of the posterior | calcaneo-astragaloid articulation are seen in walking : (i) for the posterior facet of the calcaneum receives the whole weight of the body when the heel is first placed \ on the ground; (ii) by the upAvard pressure of this facet against the astragalus it transfers the weight to the ball of the toes as the heel is raised, the hinder edge of the sustentaculum tali and the anterior and outer part of the upper surface of ; the calcaneum preventing the astragalus from being displaced too far forward by ' the superincumbent weight; and (iii) the calcaneum serves to suspend the astragalus when, with the heel raised by muscular action, the other foot is being j swung forwards. ITHE TARSAL JOINTS 285 The synovial membrane is the same as that of the astragalo-scaphoid joint. The arteries and nerves are derived from the same sources as those of the medio- tarsal joints. {b) The Articulations of the Anterior Part of the Tarsus Class. —DiartJirosis. Subdivision.—Arthroclia. These include (i) the cubo-scaphoid; (ii) scapho-cuneiform ; (iii) intercunei- Eorm ; and (iv) cubo-cuneiform joints. (i) The Cubo-scajjJioid Union I The ligaments which unite the cuboid and scaphoid are : ~- Dorsal. Plantar. Interosseous. The dorsal cubo-scaphoid ligament (fig. 256) runs forwards and outwards from the outer end of the dorsal surface of the scaphoid to the middle third of the inner border of the cuboid on its dorsal aspect, passing ov6r the posterior external angle of the external cuneiform bone. It is wider externally. The plantar cubo-scaphoid ligament is a well-marked strong band, which runs forwards and outwards, from the plantar surface of the scaphoid to the depression on the inner surface of the cuboid, and slightly into the plantar surface just below it. j The interosseous cubo-scaphoid ligament is a strong band which passes between the apposed surfaces of these bones from the dorsal to the plantar ligaments. Some of its posterior fibres reach the plantar surface of the foot behind the cubo- j scaphoid ligament, and radiate outwards and backwards over the inner border of I the cuboid to blend with the anterior extremity of the short calcaneo-cuboid ligament. (ii) The Scapho-cuneiform Articulation The ligaments uniting the scaphoid with the three cuneiform bones are:— j Dorsal. Plantar. Internal. The dorsal scapho-cuneiform ligament is very strong, and stretches as a con- tinuous structure on the dorsal surface of the scaj)hoid, between the tubercle of the scaphoid on the inner side, and the dorsal cubo-scaphoid ligament externally, passing forwards and a little outwards to the dorsal surfaces of the three cuneiform bones. The internal scapho-cuneiform ligament is a very strong thick band which connects the tubercle of the scaphoid with the inner surface of the internal cunei- form bone. It is continuous with the dorsal and plantar ligaments. Its lower border touches the tendon of the tibialis ^^osticus. The plantar scapho-cuneiform ligament forms, like the dorsal, a continuous structure extending between the plantar surfaces of the bones. Its fibres pass [forwards and outwards. It is in relation below with the tendon of the tibialis iwsticus. It must be noticed that the expanded tendon of insertion of the tibialis posticus^ and the ligaments uniting the scaphoid with the cuboid and cuneiform bones pass forwards and outwards, while the ^^eroneus longus tendon and the ligaments uniting the first and second rows of bones, except the inner half of the dorsal astragalo-scaphoid ligaments, pass forwards and inwards. This arrangement is admirabl}' adapted to preserve the arches of the foot, and especially the transverse arch. Had these tendons and ligaments run directly forward,, all the strain on the transverse arch would have fallen on the interosseous ligaments, but as it is, the arch is braced up by the above-mentioned structures.286 THE ARTICULATIONS (iii) The Intercuneiform and (iv) The Guho-cuneiform Articulations The uniting ligaments of these bones are divided into three sets : — Dorsal. Plantar. Interosseous. The dorsal ligaments are three in number, two connecting the three cuneiform bones together, and a third uniting the external cuneiform with the cuboid. They pass between the contiguous margins of the bones, and are blended behmd with the dorsal ligaments of the cubo-scaphoid and scapho-cuneiform joints. The plantar ligaments are two in number : a very strong one passes outwards and forwards from the outer side of the base of the internal cuneiform to the apex of the middle cuneiform, winding somewhat to its outer side. The second connects the apex of the external cuneiform with the anterior half of the inner surface of the cuboid along its plantar border, joining behind with the plantar scapho-cuboid ligament. The interosseous ligaments are three in number. They are strong and deep masses of ligamentous tissue which connect the middle cuneiform with the internal and external cuneiform bones, and the external cuneiform with the cuboid; occupying all the non-articular portions of the apposed surfaces of the bones. The ligaments extend the whole vertical depth between the middle cuneiform and the external, and the external cuneiform and the cuboid, and blend with the dorsal and plantar ligaments ; they are situated in front of the articular facets, and completely shut off the synovial cavity behind from that in front. The ligament between the internal and middle cuneiform bones occupies the inferior and anterior two-thirds of the apposed surfaces, and does not generally extend high enough to separate the synovial cavity of the anterior tarsal joint from that of the second and third metatarsal and cuneiform bones. If it does extend to the dorsal surface, it divides the facets completely from one another, making a seventh synovial sac in the foot. The synovial cavity will be described later on. The arterial supply is from the metatarsal and plantar arteries. The nerves are derived from the anterior tibial, and internal and external plantar. The movement permitted in these joints is very limited, and exists only for the purpose of adding to the general pliancy and elasticity of the tarsus without allowing any sensible alteration in the position of the different parts of the foot, as the medio-tarsal and calcaneo-astragaloid joints do. It is simply a gliding motion, and either deepens or widens the transverse arch. The external cuneiform being wedged in between the others is less movable, and so forms a pivot upon which the rest can move. The movement is more produced by the weight of the body than by direct muscular action ; and of the muscles attached to this part of the tarsus, all deepen the arch save the tibialis anticus, which pulls the internal cuneiform up, and so tends to widen it. (c) The Medio-taesal oe Teansveese Taesal Joints The articulations of the anterior and posterior portions of the tarsus, although in the same transverse line, consist of two separate joints, viz. (i) an inner, the astragalo-scaphoid, which communicates with the anterior calcaneo-astragaloid articulation ; and (ii) an outer, the calcaneo-cuboid, which is complete in itself. The movements of the anterior upon the posterior portions of the foot take place at both of these joints simultaneously. It will be most convenient to deal with the joints separately as regards the ligaments ; while the arteries, nerves, and move-j ments will be considered together.THE TABSAL JOINTS 287 (i) The Astmgalo-scaphoid Articulation This is the only ball-and-socket joint in the tarsus. It communicates with the interior calcaneo-astragaloid articulation, and two of the ligaments which close it n do not touch the astragalus, but pass from the calcaneum to the scaphoid. The LUiiting ligaments are : — External calcaneo-scaphoid. Inferior calcaneo-scaphoid. I Astragalo-scaphoid. I The external calcaneo-scaphoid has been already described (page 283). The inferior calcaneo-scaphoid ligament (figs. 256, 257) is an exceedingly dense thick plate of fibrous tissue. It extends from the sustentaculum tah and the Fig. 256.—View of the Foot from above, with the Astragalus removed to show THE Inferior and External Calcaneo-scaphoid Ligaments. Dorsal eubo-seaphoid m ligament m Dorsal ealeaneo-cuboid ligament Internal ealeaneo-euboid ligament External ealeaneo-seaplioid ligament Cut edge of interosseous ligament Inferior ealcaneo-seaplioid ligament Tendon of tibialis posticus under surface of the calcaneum in front of a ridge curving outwards to the anterior tubercle of that bone, to the whole width of the under surface of the scaphoid, and also to the inner surface of the scaphoid behind the tubercle. Inter- nally it is blended with the anterior portion of the internal lateral ligament of the ankle, and externally with the lower border of the external calcaneo-scaphoid iitt,lHligament. It is thickest along the inner border. Here it loses the well-marked fibrous appearance which it has in the sole, and becomes smooth and faceted. Over this part of the ligament the tendon of the tibialis ijosticus passes, giving considerable support to the head of the astragalus by assisting the power and spring of the ligament. The fibres of the ligament run forwards and inwards. The astragalo-scaphoid ligament is a broad, thin, but well-marked layer of fibres which passes from the dorsal and external surfaces of the neck of the astragalus to 4288 THE ABTICULATIONS the whole length of the dorsal surface of the scaphoid. Many of the fibres converge to their insertion on the scaphoid. The fibres low down on the outer side blend a little way from their origin with the upper edge of the external calcaneo-scaphoic ligament, and then pass forwards and inwards to the scaphoid ; those next abov^ pass obliquely and with a distinct twist over the upper and outer side of the heac of the astragalus to the centre of the dorsum of the scaphoid, overlapping fibrej from the inner side of the astragalus as well as some from the anterior ligament oj the ankle joint. Synovial membrane.—The astragalo-scaphoid is lined by the same synovial membrane as the anterior calcaneo-astragaloid joint. (ii) TJie Calcanco-cuboid Articulation Class.—Diarthrosis. Subdivision.—Arthrodia. The ligaments which unite the bones forming the outer part of the medio-tarsa joint are:— Internal or interosseous calcaneo-cuboid. Dorsal calcaneo-cuboid. Long inferior calcaneo-cuboid. Short inferior calcaneo-cuboid. The internal or interosseous calcaneo-cuboid ligament (fig. 256) is a strom band of fibres attached to the os calcis along the inner part of the non-articula] ridge above the articular facet for the cuboid, and also to the upper part of th( internal surface close to the articular margin, and passes forwards to be attachec to the depression on the internal surface of the cuboid, and also to the rough angl( between the internal and inferior surfaces. At the calcaneum this ligament i^ closely connected with the external calcaneo-scaphoid ligament. Towards the sol( it is connected with the short inferior calcaneo-cuboid ligament, and superiorh with the dorsal calcaneo-cuboid. The dorsal calcaneo-cuboid (fig. 256) is attached to the dorsal surfaces of th(: two bones, extending low down externally to blend with the outer part of th(| short plantar ligament. Over the inner half, or more, the ligament stretches som( distance beyond the margins of the articular surfaces, reaching well forward upoi the cuboid to be attached about midway between its anterior and posterior borders but towards the outer side, the ligament is much shorter, and is attached to th( cuboid behind its tubercle. The long inferior calcaneo-cuboid (the long plantar) (fig. 257) is a strong dense band of fibres which are attached posteriorly to the whole of the undei surface of the calcaneum between the posterior tubercles and the rounded eminence (the anterior tubercle) at the anterior end of the bone. Most of its fibres pasji directly forwards, and are fixed to the outer two-thirds or more of the obliqu( ridge behind the peroneal groove on the cuboid, while some j)ass further forwards and inwards, expanding into a broad layer, and are inserted into the bases of th( second, third, fourth, and inner half of the fifth metatarsal bones. This anterio] expanded portion completes the canal for the peroneus longus tendon, and from itj under surface arise the adductor hallucis and the flexor brevis minimi digit muscles. The short inferior calcaneo-cuboid (short plantar) (fig. 257) is attached to th( rounded eminence (anterior tubercle) at the anterior end of the under surface of the calcaneum, and to the bone in front of it, and then takes an oblique course forwardfj and inwards, and is attached to the whole of the depressed inferior surface of th(: cuboid behind the oblique ridge, except its outer angle. It is strongest near its oute] edge, and is formed by dense strong fibres. The synovial membrane is distinct from that of any other tarsal joint. The arterial supply of the medio-tarsal joints is from the anterior tibial fro289 MOVEMENTS AT THE TARSAL JOINTS I the tarsal and metatarsal branches of the clorsalis pedis, and from the plantar arteries. [ The nerve-supply of the medio-tarsal joints is from the external division of I the anterior tibial, and occasionally from the musculo-cutaneous or external j plantar. I The movements which take place at the medio-tarsal joints are mainly flexion [and extension, with superadded lateral and rotatory movements. Flexion at these ijomts is simultaneous with extension of the ankle, and vice versa. Flexion and extension do not take place upon a transverse, but round an oblique axis which passes from within outwards, and somewhat backwards and downwards through the astragalus and calcaneum. Combined with flexion and extension is also some rotatory motion round an antero-posterior axis which turns the inner or outer border of the foot upwards. There is also a fair amount of lateral motion whereby the foot can be inclined inwards (i.e. adducted) or outwards (i.e. abducted). These movements of the medio-tarsal joint occur in conjunction with those of the ankle and calcaneo-astragaloid joints. Eotation at the calcaneo-astragaloid joint is, however, round a vertical axis in a horizontal plane, and so turns the toes inwards or outwards ; whereas at the medio-tarsal union the axis is antero- posterior and the inner or outer edge of the foot is turned upwards. Gliding at the calcaneo-astragaloid joint elevates or depresses the edge of the foot, while at the UTHE ABTIGULATIONS 290 medio-tarsal it adducts or abducts the toes without altering the relative position of the calcaneum to the astragalus. Thus flexion at the medio-tarsal joint is associated with adduction and inward rotation of the foot, occurring simultaneously with extension of the ankle; and j extension at the medio-tarsal joint is associated with abduction and outward | rotation, occurring simultaneously with flexion of the ankle. t Flexion and adduction are far more free than extension and abduction, which latter movements are arrested by the ligaments of the sole as soon as the foot is brought into the position in which it rests on the ground. Although the astragalo-scaphoid is a ball-and-socket joint, and might allow motion in any direction, yet, owing to the union of the scaphoid with the cuboid, | movement is limited by the shape of thecalcaneo-cuboid joint, which, being concave-: convex from above downwards, prevents rotation round a vertical axis, and also any side-to-side motion except in a direction obliquely downwards and inwards, and upwards and outwards. This is also the direction of freest movement at the astragalo-scaphoid joint. Movement is also limited by the ligamentous union of the calcaneum with the scaphoid. The twisting movement of the foot, such as turning it upon its inner or outer edge, and the increase or diminution of the arch, take place at the tarsal joints, especially the medio-tarsal and calcaneo-astragaloid articulations. Here too those changes occur which, owing to paralysis of some muscles or contraction of others, result in talipes equino-varus, or valgus. 6. THE TAESO-METATAESAL ARTICULATIONS Class.—Diar^/irosts. Subdivision.—Arthrodia. There may be said to be three articulations between the tarsus and metatarsus, viz : — (a) The Internal, between the inner cuneiform and first metatarsal bones. (h) The Middle, between the three cuneiform and second and third metatarsal bones. (c) The Outer, or cuho-metatarsal, between the cuboid and fourth and fifth metatarsal bones. | The arteries for the tarso-metatarsal joints are derived: (1) for the internal,] from the dorsalis pedis and internal plantar ; (2) for the rest, twigs from the meta- j tarsal and deep plantar arches. j The nerve-supply comes from the anterior tibial and plantar nerves. The movements permitted at these joints are flexion and extension of the| metatarsus on the tarsus ; and at the inner and outer divisions, slight adduction and; abduction. In the outer, the lateral motion is freer than in the inner joint, and freest between the fifth metatarsal bone and the cuboid. In the inner joint, flexion is combined with slight abduction, and extension with adduction. There is also a little gliding, which allows the transverse arch to be increased^ or diminished in depth; the inner and two outer bones sliding downwards, and the two middle a little upwards, when the arch is increased ; and vice versa when the; arch is flattened. i (a) The Internal Taeso-metataesal Joint A complete capsular ligament unites the first metatarsal with the internal cuneiform, the fibres of which are very thick on the under and inner aspects ; those on the outer side pass from behind forwards in the interval between the interosseous ligaments which connect the two bones forming this joint with the second metatarsal. The ligament on the plantar aspect is by far the strongest, and blends at the cuneiform bone with the scapho-cuneiform ligament.291 THE TAESO-METATABSAL 4\i dial :'Jiti! ..V3 {h) The Middle Taeso-metataesal Joint Into this union there enter the three cuneiform and second and third metatarsal oones, which are bound together by the following ligaments : dorsal, plantar, inter- Dsseous. The dorsal ligaments.—1. Some short fibres cross obliquely from the outer edge )f the internal cuneiform bone to the inner border of the base of the second meta- tarsal bone ; they take the place of a dorsal metatarsal ligament which is wanting oetween the first and second metatarsal bones. 2. Between the middle cuneiform and the base of the second metatarsal bone 3ome fibres run directly forwards. 3. The external cuneiform is connected with (1) the outer corner of the second netatarsal bone by a narrow band passing obliquely inwards ; (2) with the third metatarsal by fibres passing directly forwards ; and (3) with the fourth metatarsal by a short band passing obliquely outwards to the inner edge of its base. The plantar ligaments.—A strong ligament unites the internal cuneiform and ;he bases of the second and third metatarsal bones. The tibialis posticus is nserted into these bones close beside it. Other slender ligaments connect the niddle cuneiform with the second, and the external cuneiform with the third .netatarsal bones. The interosseous ligaments.—(1) A strong broad interosseous ligament extends Detween the outer surface of the internal cuneiform, and the inner surface of the 3ase of the second metatarsal bone. It is attached to both bones below and in Tont of the articular facets, and separates the middle from the internal tarso- netatarsal joint. (2) A second band is attached behind to a fossa on the anterior md outer edge of the external cuneiform and to the interosseous ligament between it md the cuboid, and passes horizontally forwards to be attached to the whole depth )f the fourth metatarsal bone behind its internal lateral facet, and to the opposed ;urfaces of the third and fourth below their lateral articular facets. It separates the niddle tarso-metatarsal, and intermetatarsal between the third and fourth bones, Tom the cubo-metatarsal joint. It is more firmly connected with the third bone han with the fourth. (3) A slender ligament composed only of a few fibres often )asses from a small tubercle on the inner and anterior edge of the external cunei- 'orm to a groove on the outer edge of the second metatarsal bone between the two ateral facets. The synovial membrane is prolonged forwards from that of the scapho-cunei- orm and intercuneiform articulations. (c) The Cubo-metataesal Joint The bones comprising this joint are the fourth and fifth metatarsal, and the interior surface of the cuboid, firmly connected on all sides by Dorsal. Plantar. Interosseous ligaments. The plantar cnbo-metatarsal ligament is a broad, well-marked ligament, which xtends from the cuboid behind to the bases of the fourth and fifth metatarsal bones n front. It is continuous along the groove at the base of the fifth metatarsal bone ni\i the dorsal ligament, and as it passes round the outer border of the foot it is omewhat thickened, and may be described as the external cnbo-metatarsal ligament. )n its inner side it joins the interosseous ligaments, thus completing the capsule 'Blow. It is not a thick structure, and to see it the long plantar ligament, the 'eroneus longus, and external slip of the tibialis posticus must be removed; the ttachment of these structures to the fourth and fifth metatarsal bones considerably -ssists to unite them with the tarsus, u 2THE ABTICULATIONS 292 The dorsal cubo-metatarsal ligament is composed of fibres which pas?j obliquely outwards and forwards from the cuboid to the bases of the fourth ancf fifth metatarsal bones. They complete the capsule above, and are continuou^j externally with the external cubo-metatarsal ligament. i The interosseous ligament shuts off the cubo-metatarsal from the middle tarsoj metatarsal joint. It is attached to the external cuneiform behind, and to th(i Fig. 258.—Section to show the Synovial Cavities of the Foot. 1. Posterior caloaneo-astragaloid. 4. Tarsal. 2. Calcaneo-cuboid. 5.

It continuous below with the plantar ligament. The synovial membrane is separate from the other synovial sacs of the tarsu and is continued between the fourth and fifth metatarsal bones. 7. THE INTERMETATARSAL ARTICULATIONS The bases of the metatarsal bones are firmly held in position by dorsal, planta! and interosseous ligaments. The first occasionally articulates by means of a distinl facet with the second metatarsal (fig. 184). The dorsal ligaments are broad, membranous bands passing between the fo' outer toes on their dorsal aspect ; but in place of one between the first ai second metatarsal bones a ligament extends from the internal cuneiform to tj base of the second metatarsal bone (page 291). The plantar ligaments are strong, thick, well-marked ligaments which conne! the bones on their plantar aspect. I The interosseous ligaments are three in number, very strong, and are situatl at the points of union of the shaft with the bases of the bones, and fill up t| sulci on their sides. They limit the synovial cavities in front of the synovial face! The common synovial membrane of the tarsus extends between the second ai third, and third and fourth bones ; that of the cubo-metatarsal joint extendi between the fourth and fifth. The arterial and nerve-supply is the same as for the tarso-metatarsal jomts.' The movements consist merely of gliding, so as to allow the raising or wideni of the transverse arch. Considerable flexibility and elasticity is thus given to t anterior part of the foot, enabling it to become moulded to the irregularities of t ground.THE METATABSO-PHALANGEAL 293 The Union of the Heads of the Metatarsal Bones [ The heads of the metatarsal bones are connected on their plantar aspect by [he transverse ligament, consisting of four bands of fibres passing transversely rom bone to bone, blending with the fibro-cartilaginous or sesamoid plates of the letatarso-phalangeal joints, and the sheaths of the flexor tendons where they are onnected with the fibro-cartilages. It differs from the corresponding ligament a the hand by having a band from the first to the second metatarsal bone. 8. THE METATAKSO-PHALANGEAL AETICULATIONS (a) The Metataeso-phalangeal Joints of the Foue Outee Toes Class.—Diarthrosis. Subdivision.—Ginglymus. These joints are formed by the concave proximal ends of the first phalanges Lrticulating with the rounded heads of the metatarsal bones, and united by the I olio wing ligaments :—• i Two lateral. Dorsal. Plantar sesamoid plate. The two lateral ligaments are strong bands passing from a ridge on each side )f the head of the metatarsal bone to the sides of the proximal end of the first )halanx, and also to the sides of the sesamoid plate which unites the two bones )n their plantar surfaces. On the dorsal aspect they are united by the dorsal igament. The dorsal ligament consists of loose fine fibres of areolo-fibrous tissue, extend- ng between the lateral ligaments, thus completing a capsule. It is connected by ine fibres to the under surface of the extensor tendons, which pass over and jonsiderably strengthen this portion of the capsule. The plantar sesamoid plate helps to deepen the shallow facet of the phalanx or the head of the metatarsal bone, and corresponds to the glenoid ligament of he fingers. It is firmly connected to the lateral ligaments and the intertrans- verse ligament, and is grooved inferiorly where the flexor tendons pass over it. It 'erves to prevent dorsal dislocation of the phalanx. j (b) The Metataeso-phalangeal Joints of the Geeat Toe The metacarpo-phalangeal joint of the great toe differs from the rest in the oUowing particulars :— I (1) The bones are on a larger scale, and the articular surfaces are more extensive, j (2) There are two grooves on the plantar surface of the metatarsal bone, one im each side of the median line, for the sesamoid bones. { (3) The sesamoid bones replace the fibro-cartilaginous or sesamoid plate. They [tre two small hemispherical bones developed in the tendons of the flexor brevis lallucis, convex below, but flat above where they play in grooves on the head of he metatarsal bone; they are united by a strong transverse ligamentous band, j/vhich is smooth below and forms part of the channel along which the long flexor pendon plays. They are firmly united to the base of the phalanx by strong short fibres, but to the metatarsal bone they are joined by somewhat looser fibres. I laterally they are connected with the lateral ligaments and the sheath of the liexor tendons. They provide shifting leverage for the flexor brevis hallucis as kvell as for the flexor longus hallucis.THE ABTICULATIONS 294 The arteries come from the digital and interosseous branches ; and the nerves from the cutaneous digital, or from small twigs of the nerves to the interossei muscles. The movements permitted are : flexion, extension, abduction, adduction, and circumduction. Flexion is more free than extension, and is limited by the extensor tendons andi dorsal ligaments ; extension is limited by the flexor tendons, the plantar fibres of the lateral ligaments, and the sesamoid plates. The lateral motion is possible from the shape of the bony surfaces, but is very limited, being most marked in the great toe. It is limited by the lateral ligaments and sesamoid plates. 9. THE INTEEPHALANGEAL JOINTS Class.—Diarthrosis. Subdivision.—Ginglymus. The articulations between the first and second, and second and third phalanges of the toes are similar to those of the fingers, with this important difference,! that the bones are smaller and the joints, especially between the second and third phalanges, are often ankylosed. The ligaments which unite them are :— Two lateral. Dorsal. Glenoid ligament. The two lateral ligaments are well marked, and pass on each side of the joints from a little rough depression on the head of the proximal, to a rough border on the side of the base of the distal phalanx of the joint. The dorsal ligament is thin and membranous, and extends across the joint from one lateral ligament to the other beneath the extensor tendon, with the deep' surface of which it is connected, and by which it is strengthened. The glenoid ligament covers in the joint on the plantar surface. It is a fibro- cartilaginous plate, connected at the sides with the lateral ligaments, and with thej bones by short ligamentous fibres ; the plantar surface is smooth, and grooved for the flexor tendons. The arteries and nerves are derived from the corresponding digital branches. The only movements permitted at these joints are flexion and extension. At the interphalangeal joint of the great toe there is very frequently a small sesamoid bone which plays on the plantar surface of the first phalanx, in the same] way as the sesamoid bones of the metatarso-phalangeal joint play upon the plantar surface of the head of the metatarsal bone. Morpliology of Ligaments The various ligaments of the human body have, in very many instances, been evolved as the result of secondary changes in muscles adjacent to joints. In a few instances ligaments represent the degenerate remnants of cartilaginous and bony elements. Capsular ligaments are in most joints derived from the periosteum, but they may be strengthened by the incorporation of tendons detached from adjacent muscles. Muscles arising from, or inserted into bones in the immediate vicinity of a joint tendj to become metamorphosed into tendon near their attachments, and a comprehensive study of myology in low vertebrate forms indicates that there is associated with this tissue- change a tendency for the muscle to alter its point of attachment; hence a muscle origin- ally inserted below a joint may eventually come to have its insertion above the joint. In| the same way, a muscle arising above a joint may, as a result of altered environment,! shift its origin to some point below the joint. To this change of position the term migra-i tion of muscles has been applied. In many instances a portion of the muscle equivalent to the distance between the original and the acquired attachment persists as a fibrous band and fulfils the function of a ligament. This is well seen in the knee joint, where the internal lateral ligament is derived from the adductor magnus, this muscle having shifted its insertion from the tibia to the femm-. In the same way the external lateral295 MORPHOLOGY OF LIGAMENTS ligament represents the tendon of the peroneus longus, which has migrated from the femur to the head of the fibula. One of the most remarkable examples of a tendon divorced in this way is the liga- mentum teres in the hip joint. This curious structure was in all probability the tendon of the pectineus, which has been detached from the muscle in consequence of the profound alterations which have taken place in the limb during its evolution. Among other ligaments derived in a similar way from muscles may be mentioned the greater sacro-sciatic ligament. This was originally the tendon of origin of the biceps femoris. The lesser sacro-sciatic is derived from the fibrous regression of portions of [the coccygeus. The sacro-coccygeal ligaments represent the muscles which lift, depress, and wag the tail in those mammals furnished with such an appendage ; indeed, these ligaments are occasionally replaced by muscle-tissue. I The coraco-hmneral ligament is derived from the original tendon of insertion of the pectoralis minor, and not infrequently the muscle is inserted into the lesser tuberosity of the humerus, the ligament being then replaced hy the tendon of the muscle. The coraco- clavicular, rhomboid, and gleno-humeral ligaments are probably derived from modifications of the subclavius muscle. The vertebral column contains several ligamentous structures of great morphological interest. The pulpy substance in the centre of each intervertebral disc is derived from the notochord; the suspensory ligament passing from the tip of the odontoid process Uo the anterior margin of the foramen magnum is a remnant of the sheath of the noto- , chord, and indicates its position as it passed from the vertebral column into the base of the j cranium. The transverse ligament of the atlas is a persistent and functional form of the posterior conjugal ligament uniting the rib-heads in seals and many other mammals, I whilst the interosseous ligament of the head of a rib in man is the feeble representative of this structure in the thoracic region of the spine. ji Many of the subcutaneous tracts of fascia and many aponeuroses in the human body are derived from the metamorphosis and regression of muscle-tissue.SECTION III. THE MUSCLES By J. N. C. DAVIES-COLLEY, M.A., M.C.Cantab., F.R.C.S. SURGEOX TO A^■D LECTtTRER OIV SURGERY AT GUy'S HOSPITAL; EXAMINER IN ANATOMY FOR THE COXJOIXT BOARD; LATE EXAMINER IN THTi UNIVERSITY OF CAMBRIDGE THE Muscles consist chiefly of transversely striated fibres arranged in fasciculi or bundles of various sizes ; and also of white fibrous tissue, which forms the flattened cords or sheets, the tendons and aponeuroses, as they are called, by which most of the muscles at one or both ends are attached to the bones or cartilages with which they are connected. In the account of each individual muscle, it is convenient to divide the descrip- ! tion into seven heads, viz.:—1. the name ; 2. the shape ; 3. the attachments; : 4. the structure; 5. the nerve-supply ; 6. the action ; and 7. the relations. A short account also of the more important variations will be added. i 1. The name is given for various causes, and frequently when it consists of more than one word, for two or even three causes, viz.: (a) the supposed action, e.g. adductor and sartorius ; {b) the shape, e.g. triangularis and lumbricalis ; (c) the direction, e.g. rectus (straight), obliquus (slanting); {d} the position, e.g. sublimis (near the surface), profundus (far from it), gluteus (in connection with the nates); j (e) its divisions and complexity, e.g. biceps, triceps, multifidus ; (/) its size, as magnus, minimus, &c. ; (g) its attachments, e.g. sterno-cleido-mastoideus. : 2. The shape is som.etimes difficult to define on account of the irregularity of ; the outline, and curvature of the surfaces of the muscle. Some are narrow and | of a flattened cylindrical form, which may be designated ribbon-shaped. Many of these are diminished at their extremities, and may be called fusiform or spindle- shaped. Others are broad, and form sheets of various thicknesses, which, according ! to their outline, may be described as fan-shaped, rhomboidal, triangular, or quadri- ^ lateral. Many, again, are compound muscles with double or multiple origins or insertions, which are called, from this cause, bicipital, trifid, &c. This is often the case when a strong muscle arises from many points of bone, or when a muscle i divides into many tendons below to move several small levers, such as the bones of the j fingers and toes. A few have tendons intercalated in their length, and are called | biventral or digastric muscles. It is in some cases difficult to comprehend why certain muscles, on the one hand, which appear to be separate, are grouped under | one name as a compound muscle ; and, on the other hand, muscles which might very well be combined are distinguished by separate names. The principle of dis- tinction appears to have been to group muscles which combine to form one belly, and to separate those in which the tendons alone are united. ! 3. Of the attachments, the more fixed end of the muscle is usually called the i origin, the more movable the insertion. In enumerating the various points ofSTBUCTUBE OF THE MUSCLES 297 itachment, it is very necessary to bear in mind not only those to bone and .artilage, but also those to the fibrous structures or septa and aponeuroses which ie between or around the muscles. Such attachments are best seen when the area >f bone surface available for origin or insertion is small. By this means an ndefinite extension is given to this area, and a small bony process, such as the nner condyle of the humerus, is able to give a firm resistance to the traction of nany strong muscles. 4. The structure will include not only the direction and curvature of the fleshy ibres, and the extent of fibrous tissue by which these fibres arise or are inserted ; mt also the internal arrangement of tendons and muscular fibre, which is often )f a somewhat complicated character. The simplest structure of all is that of jnuscles with no tendons, in which the fleshy fibres run parallel from one end to I,he other. Many of the small muscles of the face are of this character. The iiterno-mastoid and sartorius are examples also of muscles in which the parallel leshy fibres form nearly the whole of the structure. It will be found that in these nuscles, on account of the number of joints passed over and the distance of the line )f the muscle from the axes of these joints, the range of movement is very great. |[n most parts of the body, however, there would be a great waste of fleshy fibre if ihis arrangement prevailed. Roughly speaking, we may say, that when fleshy ibres contract fully, their length is diminished by one half. Now, if the distance oetween the movable points of the skeleton which are joined by the muscles can- Qot be lessened by this amount, it is obvious that some of the contractile power )f the muscle would be wasted. When, therefore, the movable points of the skeleton bridged by a muscle can only be approximated through a limited space, it will be found that the parallel fleshy bundles are about twice the length of this 3pace, and that the rest of the muscle consists of inextensible tendon, which acts simply as a ligament to attach the contractile muscle to the bones. But this iaddition of tendon to the fleshy part of the muscle is effected in various ways. The jsimplest plan is that in which the addition is made at one end or the other of the muscle. The palmaris longus is to some extent an example of such an arrange- ment. By examining the bones it will be seen that the front of the carpus cannot be approximated to the internal condyle of the humerus by more than three finches. The fleshy bundles are, therefore, of about twdce this length, and they |are accumulated towards the upper end of the muscle, while the rest of its length is occupied by a long tendon. A more common arrangement is for the short fleshy fibres to arise in succession along the surface of a long bone or from an inter- imuscular septum, and to pass in parallel lines to the end and side of a long tendon, iwhich gradually thickens with the increase of the number of the fibres inserted into it. Such a muscle is like a feather, of which the quill with its diminishing upper extremity will represent the tendon, and the barbs upon one side of it tthe fleshy fibres. Hence this arrangement is called penniform, from penna, a jfeather (fig. 259). This form is found when considerable power is required, but with only a small range of movement. To appreciate fully the effect of such a muscle, we should in our imagination take all the short parallel fibres and place them side by side at the end of the tendon. The muscle would then be converted into a very thick and short fleshy mass with a very long tendon. Frequently a muscle arises in two lines from the adjacent surfaces of two bones, from which two sets of parallel fibres converge upon a tendon which runs I down in the interval between the bones. This arrangement resembles a feather with barbs on either side of the quill, and is called bipenniform. Examples of both i these forms are found in the leg. The peronei arising from the fibula alone are I penniform, while the tibialis posticus and soleus, arising from both tibia and fibula, \ are bipenniform. i In some cases a further complication is introduced by the origin of a muscle298 THE MUSCLES from both sides of several fibrous septa, as well as from the intermediate sm^faces of the bone to which the septa are attached. The insertion may also be of the same character. A good example of this, which is called the multipemiiform arrange- ment, is the deltoid, a very powerful muscle with a short range of movement. In some few cases the tendon is intercalated between two fleshy masses. Such muscles are called biventral. The central tendon may represent a bony structure found in lower Vertebrata, and the two bellies might sometimes fairly be regardjed as distinct muscles, e.g. those of the digastric muscle. In some cases the central tendon may be of some service in preventing the pressure upon subjacent tissues Fig. 259.—Diageam showing Penniform Muscle, the Peroneus Longus ; and bipenniform, the tibialis posticus. which would occur if the muscle were at this point fleshy and free to thicken as i1 contracted. For example, it has been suggested that the central tendon of the omo-hyoid prevents that muscle from compressing the great vessels of the neck &i it crosses them beneath the sterno-mastoid. In one muscle, the rectus abdominis several of these tendinous intersections are found. 5. Nerve-supply.^—This is of much importance, not only from a medical anc surgical point of view, when the paralysis or spasmodic contraction of individua muscles has to be accounted for, but also because of the light which it throwi upon the action of muscles, and the assistance which it sometimes gives us ii grouping them.299 THEIB ACTION AS LEVEBS 6. Action.—Most muscles act upon the levers formed by the movable bones and ; cartilages. It will be convenient, however, first to speak of those which do not act in this manner. When a muscle passes from a fixed point like a bone to a freely movable point such as the under surface of the skin or mucous membrane, it will simply tend to approximate the movable point to the fixed origin. Such muscles are found in abundance in the face, and the azygos uvul^ is a good example of one t which acts upon mucous membrane. Again, the fibres of many muscles run in jparallel curves, which combine to form a curved band or sheet. The first effect of the contraction of such a muscle will be to straighten or flatten out the curve, jif this lies over a convex surface, as is usually the case, the action of the muscle will be to compress the structures lying in its concavity. The buccinator and abdominal muscles are good examples of this form of muscle. Or if the surface 1 upon which the curved sheet lies is concave, the muscle will tend by its contraction I to lift up the soft parts upon its deep or convex surface. As an instance of this we lhave the influence of the platysma myoides upon the fascia and other structures [which overlie the great vascular channels of the neck and the apices of the lungs. In estimating the effect of muscles acting upon the levers formed by the bones, each of which moves upon a joint as its fulcrum, three points have to be taken into consideration :—(1) the order of lever ; (2) the distance from the fulcrum of the points of application of the force at the insertion of the muscle, and of the resistance to be overcome ; and (3) the direction in which the force is applied. It will be found that whereas in most levers employed in mechanics the object aimed at is I what is called mechanical advantage, i.e. by the application of a small force to overcome a greater resistance ; in the human body the object is, on the contrary, by the exertion of a great force through a small space to overcome a small resist- ance, but at the same time to cause motion through a much greater space, and with a much greater speed. In the three orders of levers, the fulcrum is placed either between the power and the resistance (first order) ; or at one end, with the power at the other, and the resistance to be overcome between (second order); or at one end with the power in the middle, and the resistance to be overcome at the other end (third order). The power required to overcome the resistance varies inversely with the distance of its point of application from the fulcrum. Where this distance, or the arm of the lever as it is called, is short compared with the arm at which the resistance acts, then the power has to be greater than the resistance, and vice versa. In the first order of levers, if the power and resistance act parallel to one another, there may or may not be a gain of mechanical advantage, according as the arm at which the power acts is greater or less than the arm at which the resistance acts. In the second order of levers there must necessarily be mechanical advantage ; and in the third order the power must be greater than the resistance, as it has to act upon a shorter arm, so there will be what may be termed mechanical disadvantage. In the human body there is hardly a single muscle which forms a good example of a lever of the second order, for the simple reason that mechanical advantage is of so much less importance than a wide range of movement with its attendant j rapidity. The best example that can be given is that of some of the muscles which depress the mandible, e.g. the anterior belly of the digastric, which is inserted into |the extremity of the lever formed by that bone, while the resistance to be overcome \—viz. the tonic contraction of the masseter, temporal, and internal pterygoid— is exerted at a point much nearer to the fulcrum upon which the mandible turns. The muscles which are inserted upon the tendo Achillis are often given as an "xample of this order of lever, when by their contraction they raise the heel and llift up the body, the weight of which acts upon the lever of the foot through the |ankle joint. This would be a good example if another person were to lay hold of the tendo Achillis, and by drawing upon it to raise the individual from the ground, ut the fact that the other end of the muscle springs from a part of the mass toTHE MUSCLES 300 be raised alters the conditions, and, as a matter of fact, the muscle, instead of obtaining any mechanical advantage in its action, has to contract with a force four or five times as great as the weight to be raised. It will be found that most of the muscles belong either to the third order, in which there is necessarily mechanical disadvantage, or to the first order ; and in this case the arm at which the power acts is usually the shorter, so that the power has to be greater than the resistance. In the movements of the forearm about the elbow as a fulcrum, the triceps acting with the very short arm afforded by the pro- jection of the olecranon and overcoming a resistance experienced by the hand at the other end of the radius and ulna, will be a lever of the first order. The brachio-radialis (supinator longus) when used to flex the forearm acts at the lower end of the radius, so as to overcome the weight of the forearm and hand, which will act through the centre of gravity of the limb about the middle of the radius, and therefore much nearer to the fulcrum at the elbow. If its angle of insertion were not so very small, the muscle would thus obtain a considerable mechanical advantage. This extreme obliquity, however, actually places the muscle in a condition of mechanical disadvantage. Lastly, the biceps and brachialis anticus are both of them good examples of the third order of lever, when they act by their insertion close to the fulcrum of the elbow to flex the forearm, the centre of gravity of which is much farther from the joint. The direction of the tendon at its point of insertion is of great importance in estimating the effect of the contraction of any muscle. It is rarely perpendicular to Fig. 260. its lever. There is, therefore, in nearly every case, a considerable loss of mechanical advantage ; but it should be remembered that this is more than counterbalanced by important gains. In the first place, the range and rapidity of movement are greatly increased for a given contraction of the muscle ; and in the second place a power is also produced by which the articular ends of the bones bridged over by the muscle are pressed together, so that the tendency to dislocation of the joint is diminished. A third advantage is the compactness given to the limb by the tendons being placed in close apposition to the bones, an object which could not be attained unless their insertions were very oblique. Take the case of the brachio-radialis flexing the forearm. In the adjoining diagram let E be the elbow, B E the humerus, E E the radius, and B E the line of; the brachio-radialis. To estimate how much of the contracting force of the muscle is actually expended in flexing the forearm, all that is necessary is to take any point K in B E, to draw K A perpendicular to E E, and form a rectangle E A K C, on E A. If the force of the muscle acting along E B be represented by the line E K, then E C will represent that portion of the force which tends to flex the elbow, and E A the portion which is devoted to compression of the head of the radius against the capitellum of the humerus, so as to strengthen the elbow joint. Again, let E E'be the new position of the forearm after the brachio-radialis has contracted. The arc of the circle through which it has moved will be indicated by E E', a small arc drawn*THE IB ACTION 3Q1 svith radius EE, and centre E. Now join R' to B, and draw another small arc jR' D with centre B and radius R' B. ED being the difference between B E, and I B E' will indicate the amount by which the length of the muscle has diminished I during its contraction, and E E' will represent the space through which the lower } end of the radius has moved. A comparison of the lengths of E D and E E' will show how great has been the gain in range of movement by the oblique insertion of B R. If the muscle had been inserted at right angles to E E, it would, in order to produce the same effect, have had to contract through a space equal in length to RE'. With its oblique insertion a contraction equal in length to ED has sufficed. The gain in range (and therefore in rapidity of movement, for by contracting through Ithe short distance it causes a simultaneous motion through the longer space) may jbe roughly represented by the fraction gg'. In muscles in which the insertion of [the tendon is at a very small angle, the loss of power is proportionately greater, and [the gain in speed and range enormous. As instances of this maybe mentioned the , 1 insertions of the tendons of the phalanges, which produce the comparatively feeble, but exceedingly nimble, movements of the fingers with a very small contraction of 1 the forearm muscles. In speaking of the direction of the muscles, it should clearly be understood that [ this refers to the angle of the attachment of the tendon to the lever which has to \ be moved, and not to the general direction, which is often changed by the passage Fig. 261. A E B C F D of the tendon or muscle over projections of bone or under arches of ligament before I it reaches its insertion. ! The advantage of an oblique insertion may also be illustrated by the action of muscular fibres, which cross one another like the two parts of the letter X in their passage between two parallel bones; e.g. in the internal and external intercostal I muscles connecting adjacent ribs, or in the external and internal oblique muscles of the abdomen in their passage from the crest of the ilium to the last rib. If the muscles connecting the parallel bones ran at right angles to them, they could only by their contraction diminish the intervening space by one-half; whereas, running obliquely, they produce by their contraction a much greater approximation of the bones. For let A B and C D represent two parallel bones, and E F a muscular fibre running perpendicularly from one to the other. If its full contraction reduced the length of the fibre by one-half, it would merely draw the point E to E'. But suppose that two muscular fibres C E and D E converge at right angles to one another upon i the point E. The amount that they will have to contract to draw E to E' may j be readily found by describing the arc of a circle E' K or E' L about C or D as a centre, and with CE' or DE' as a radius. E K and E L will represent the contraction required ; and it is evident that if these oblique fibres contract more strongly, they can bring the bone A B into close apposition to C D. When muscles pass over more than one joint, their action is somewhat more complicated. Usually other muscles are at the same time called into play, so302 THE MUSCLES as to fix some of the joints, and enable the muscle to act solely upon others. For example, when the muscles arising above the wrist are used to extend the phalanges of the fingers, it will be found that some of the flexors of the carpus I contract so as to fix the wrist. Similarly, if the fingers are flexed in grasping an } object, it is easy to feel the tendons of the carpal extensors starting up into firm ! contraction. | Occasionally the passage of a muscle over two joints is used to obtain very smft i and vigorous action. For example, if the long head of the triceps, which extends from i the axillary border of the shoulder-blade to the olecranon process, were replaced i by an inextensible ligament, which should be tight with the arm down and the I elbow flexed, the elevation of the humerus by the deltoid muscle would necessitate I a corresponding extension of the elbow. Now put in the place of the inextensible i ligament an actively contracting muscle, and it is clear that the combination of this I elevation of the arm by the deltoid with contraction of the triceps will produce a I much more rapid extension of the elbow, such as is seen in throwing a spear or a | stone. ! MUSCLES OF THE UPPER EXTREMITY \ The first group consists of those which, arising from various parts of the head,' neck, and trunk, are inserted into the bones of the shoulder girdle, viz. the clavicle ; and scapula, or into the humerus. Of this group there are two divisions : the one ! comprising the muscles which take their origin from the back of the head, neck,' and trunk; the other, those which arise from the front and sides of the thorax. POSTEEIOE DIVISION OF THE GEOUP OF MUSCLES PASS- ING FEOM THE TEUNK TO THE UPPEE EXTEEMITY. I This division consists of two layers, which lie superficial to the proper back i muscles. Overlying these layers is, firstly, the superficial fascia, which is strong ! and well provided with fat, and is continuous with that of the head, neck, axilla, : and other adjacent regions ; and, secondly, the deep fascia, which is thin and forms ! the sheath of the trapezius and latissimus dorsi muscles. Above and in front, the j deep fascia is continuous with the deep cervical fascia ; lower down, with the axillary j fascia, and that covering the thoracic and abdominal parietes. Internally it is attached | to the spines of the vertebrae, and below it blends with the lumbar aponeurosis. First Layer Consisting of one muscle—the trapezius. THE TRAPEZIUS The trapezius (or cucuUaris, as it has been called from its resemblance to a j cowl = cucullus) is named from rpaTre^a, a table, on account of the four-sided | figure formed by the muscles of the two sides. It is a fan-shaped sheet forming an obtuse-angled triangle, the long side of which corresponds with the spine. Origin.—(1) The inner third of the superior nuchal line of the occipital bone, 'THE MUSCLES 304 and the external occipital protuberance ; (2) the posterior border of the ligamentun nuchse ; (8) the spines of the seventh cervical and all the thoracic vertebrse, togethe with the supraspinous ligaments. Insertion. —(1) The posterior border of the outer third of the clavicle and th adjacent part of its upper surface; (2) the inner edge of the upper surface of th acromion process ; (3) the upper border of the spine of the scapula, and a small tubercle at its inner extremity. I Structure.—The origin of the muscle is by short tendinous intermingled wit'j fleshy fibres, except at two places, where the tendinous fibres form a continuouj sheet. The first of these is from the middle of the ligamentum nuchae to the seconi thoracic spine ; here a conspicuous oval aponeurosis is formed by the tendons of thj two sides. The second is at the lower acute angle of the muscle where it arisel from the lowest thoracic vertebra. The muscular fibres converge from the extensi\- origin, and just before their insertion the sheet of the muscle is folded upon itselj to adapt it to the V-shaped process of the shoulder girdle, into which it is insertei by fleshy fibres, except at the inner extremity of the spine of the scapula, wheii a tendinous sheet plays over the triangular base of that process, before it is insertei into the tubercle at the inner end of the spine. Sometimes a bursa intervene between this sheet and the triangular surface of the scapular spine. ^ Nerve-supply.—From the spinal accessory ; and from the deep cervical plexi by branches of the third and fourth cervical nerves, which, after communicatini with the spinal accessory, enter with it the deep surface of the muscle a sho: distance above the clavicle. ! il Action.—Its upper fibres draw upwards the outer end of the clavicle and tH point of the shoulder ; and acting from below, they extend the head, flex the nee! to the same side, and turn the face to the opposite side. Its middle fibres dra the scapula inwards towards the spine ; at the same time they produce a rotaticj of the scapula on the thorax, by which the point of the shoulder is raised. Tl: lower fibres draw the scapula downwards and inwards, and at the same time rota it so as to raise the point of the shoulder. Acting as a whole, the muscle draws the scapula towards the middle line \ the back, and elevates the shoulder by the rotation it impresses upon the shouldel blade. By drawing the scapula backwards, it gives some help to the pectoral minor and other muscles Avhich elevate the ribs in forced inspiration. When takes its fixed point from the shoulder-blade and clavicle, as when the hand gras] firmly some immovable object, the muscle will draw the spines of the vertebi! towards the scapula. The presence of the oval aponeurotic patch may be explained by the fact thj the range of movement of the scapula in a horizontal direction backwards ai inwards is more limited than when the inward movement is combined with i upward or downward direction. This limitation is due to the ligamentous attaa ments of the clavicle and shoulder blade. Relations.—Superficially, the integuments and subcutaneous nerves ; deeply, tl complexus splenii, serratus posticus superior, rhomboidei, the vertebral aponeuros covering the continuations upwards of the erector spin^e, the external intercosta latissimus dor si, levator anguli scapulae, omo-hyoid, scalenus medius and posticij the supraspinatus, and a small portion of the infraspinatus. j Variations.—Occasionally the upper or the lower part of its origin may fail. Tl clavicular part of its insertion sometimes extends far forwards upon the clavicle. quently fibres pass from its anterior border to the inner end of the clavicle either in front | or behind the sterno-mastoid, forming an arch under which run some of the superfic j nerves. This arch may even extend to the sternum. A similar transverse band is occasioi] ally found in the upper part of the posterior triangle, the transversus nuchce. Sometinj a longitudinal band of fibres covers the sj^inal origin of the trapezius. iLEVATOB ANGULI SCAPULA—BHOMBOIDEI 305 X Second Layer Consists of four muscles—the levator anguli scapula, rhomboideus minor and ajor ; and the latissimus dorsi. ^ 1. lev;a.tor anguli scapula The levator anguli scapulae (figs. 263 and 266), named from its action in raising he posterior superior angle of the scapula, is a ribbon-shaped muscle. Origin.—By four short tendons from the posterior tubercles of the transverse recesses of the four upper cervical vertebrae. Insertion.—The vertebral border of the scapula opposite the supraspinous ssa. Structure.—The tendons of origin, vi^hich are closely connected with the inser- on of the splenius colli, after a short course are succeeded by muscular bellies, d these unite to form a thick band of parallel fibres which remain fleshy to their sertion. The plane of the muscle changes as it descends. Above, while lying in e posterior triangle of the neck, its surfaces look outwards and inwards ; below, ey are directed backwards and forwards. Nerve-supply. — From the cervical plexus by branches from the third and aurth cervical nerve which enter the front of the outer surface near the origin of muscle. Action.—It raises the posterior superior angle of the scapula ; but, by causing tation of that bone, it depresses the point of the shoulder. Taking its fixed oint from below, it is an extensor and lateral flexor of the neck. Relations.-—Superficially, the deep cervical fascia, the platysma myoides, the 'erno-mastoid, the trapezius, the scalenus medius, the internal jugular vein, the "inal accessory nerve, and some of the descending branches of the cervical plexus ; eeply, the splenius colli, the cervicalis ascendens, the serratus posticus superior, d the posterior scapular vessels. Variations.—The number of cervical vertebrae from which the muscle arises varies, and : may even arise from the mastoid process or occipital bone. It msij send slips to the ".rratus magnus, the serratus posticus major, and other adjacent muscles; occasionally 0 to the clavicle and first two ribs. 2 AND 3. RHOMBOIDEI The rhomboidei—named from their shape, which is rhomboidal, or like a itarallelogram—are sometimes looked upon as a single muscle, but may be Lsually separated into the following :— The rhomboideus minor, the lesser and upper of the two, is a four-sided sheet, orming an elongated parallelogram. I Origin.—The lower part of the ligamentum nuchse, the spines of the seventh ervical and first thoracic vertebrae, and the supraspinous ligament between them. I Insertion.—The vertebral border of the scapula opposite its spine. Structure.—Its origin and insertion are by short tendinous fibres, between l^hich its fleshy fibres run parallel to one another, downwards and outwards. ( Nerve-supply.—From the brachial plexus by a branch of the fifth cervical jierve, which enters its deep aspect near the upper border a short distance above its asertion. For action and relations, see the account of the following muscle. XTHE MUSCLES 806 The rhomboideus major—the lower and larger of the two muscles—is a broac' rhomboidal sheet. Origin.—The spines of the four or five upper thoracic vertebrae, and the supra- spinous ligaments between them. Fig. 263.—The Levator Anguli ScAPULiE and Ehomboidei. Supraspinatus Infraspinatus Teres major Serratus magnus Serratus posticus inferior Obliquus'internus Complexus Splenius capitis Levator anguli scapulae Serratus}posticus superiorl Rhomboideus minor Splenius colli Rhomboideus majorBHOMBOIDEI-LATISSIMUS DOBSI 307 Insertion.—The vertebral border of the scapula opposite the infraspinous fossa. Structure.—At the origin, of short tendinous fibres, succeeded by parallel fleshy bundles, which pass downwards and outwards to a narrow tendinous expansion ,vhich is feebly attached to the scapula over the upper three-fourths of its insertion, )ut with thick and strong fibres near the inferior angle of that bone, i Nerve-supply.—The same as the preceding, and entering the upper part of the jleep surface near its insertion. Action.—The rhomboidei draw the scapula inwards and backwards towards he middle line, and at the same time upwards. They also rotate the scapula so Ls to depress the point of the shoulder. In this way they, together with the levator ^nguli scapulae, will help in drawing down the arm, after it has been elevated hrough the rotation of the scapula by the trapezius and serratus magnus. Acting from the scapula, the rhomboidei will help the trapezius in drawing the aiddle line of the back towards that bone. Relations of the two rhomboidei.—Superficially, the trapezius and, at the lower )art of the rhomboideus major, the deep fascia, and latissimus dorsi; deeply, the lerratus posticus superior, splenius colli, the vertebral aponeurosis covering the ipper continuations of the erector spinae, the external intercostals, and the posterior capular vessels. Variations.—The rhomboideus minor is frequently absent, and occasionally there is no liomboideus major. The fibres of the latter muscle may be inserted almost entirely into he lower angle of the scapula. Occasionally its lower fibres join those of the latissimus orsi, and tliey have also been found continuous with a part of the teres major. An ccessory band may join the rhomboidei from the occipital bone (the occipito-scapularis). 4. LATISSIMUS DORSI The latissimus dorsi (figs. 262, 269)—named from its being the broadest of the :ack muscles—is a fan-shaped sheet forming a right-angled triangle, the right angle leing contained between its upper and vertebral borders. Origin.—(1) The five or six lower thoracic spines, and the supraspinous liga- aents; (2) the lower part of the vertebral aponeurosis (see account of Lumbae 'AsciA, page 434), by Avhich it is attached to the spines of all the lumbar and acral vertebrae ; (3) the posterior third of the outer lip of the crest of the ilium ; i) horizontal lines crossing the outer surface of the last three or four ribs external 0 their angles (these lines by their lower borders give origin to processes of the xternal oblique muscle, which thus interdigitates with the latissimus dorsi); (5) the orsal aspect of the inferior angle of the scapula. 1 Insertion.—The bottom of the bicipital groove of the humerus, as far upwards s the lesser tuberosity. Structure.—Its first and third parts arise by short tendinous fibres. The origin f the second part from the vertebral aponeurosis is by fleshy fibres in a line which escends obliquely downwards and outwards from the last thoracic spme to the ack of the crest of the ilium. Its origin from the ribs and scapula is muscular, he fleshy fibres are of nearly equal length, and they converge upon the tendon in ich a way that those which arise from the ribs and crista ilii are inserted highest ito the humerus, while those which spring from the thoracic spine are attached j) the lower part of the bicipital groove. The broad sheet wraps round the side !^ the thorax, and is also folded upon itself, so that the anterior surface at the rigin becomes the posterior at the insertion. A groove is thus formed, in which e the outer border of the scapula and the teres major. The tendon of the teres lajor is usually attached at the borders to that of the latissimus dorsi by strong )nnective tissue ; but a bursa intervenes between them near their insertion. x2THE MUSCLES 308 Nerve-supply.—From the posterior cord of the brachial plexus by means of the: long subscapular nerve. This is derived from the fifth cervical nerve, and entersl the muscle upon its deep surface in the lower part of the axilla. Action.—It draws the humerus baclvwards, downwards, and inwards; at the same time rotating it inwards. The movement of the arm in swimming is a goodj example of its action. When the arm is placed close to the side, it will draw thei shoulder backwards and downwards. ! Acting from the humerus as a fixed point, it is very important in climbing, as it, draws the pelvis and lower part of the trunk upwards and forwards towards the arms. i By its costal origin it will assist in forced inspiration when the arm is fixed, j Relations.—Superficially, the trapezius, fasciae, and integument, the pectorah^j major, axillary vessels, and branches of the brachial plexus; deeply, the rhomboi-i deus major, the vertebral aponeurosis, covering the upward continuations of th(i erector spinae muscle, the serratus posticus inferior, external intercostals, external oblique, infraspinatus, serratus magnus, and teres major muscles. • Variations.—It varies in the height of its origin from the spinal column, and also ir the number of ribs from which it arises. , From its axillary border slips may cross th(: axilla to the tendon of the pectoralis major, or may cross the great vessels and nerves tci the coracoid process or the deep fascia at the upper part of the arm. A slip of fascia oi' muscle may be continued down from its tendon of insertion to the olecranon in associatioi: with the triceps. j j ANTEEIOE DIVISION OF THE GEOUP OF MUSCLE^ PASSING FEOM THE TEUNK TO THE UPPEl! EXTEEMITY These muscles are arranged in three layers, of which the first two are forme( by muscles which arise from the front of the thorax : viz., the pectoralis major ii the first layer, and the subclavius and pectoralis minor in the second; the last b;i a single muscle, the serratus magnus, which takes origin from the side of th| thorax. | The superficial fascia, which covers all these sheets, is but moderately supplie' with fat, and is continuous with that of all the adjacent regions. It lies both ove! and beneath the mammary gland, and sends fibrous septa between its lobules. ; In addition to the superficial fascia, there are three other important fasciae i| this region. j 1. The pectoral fascia, a thin membrane which forms the sheath of the pectoralii major, and is attached to the clavicle above ; while below it passes over the free edgi of the great pectoral muscle, and there unites with the axillary fascia. 2. The clavi-pectoral fascia arises in two sheets from the anterior and posteric' borders of the under surface of the clavicle. These sheets unite after enclosiu, the subclavius muscle, and form a single membrane which is much thicker at ilj outer and upper part, where it is attached to the coracoid process and blends wit? the front of the sheath of the axillary vessels. It bridges over the interv{| between the subclavius muscle and the pectoralis minor, and is here called tb, costo-coracoid membrane. This membrane is of a quadrilateral shape, attache! above and below to the sheaths of the subclavius and the pectoralis minor muscle, externally to the upper surface of the coracoid process, and internally it becom(i i very thin and blends with the fascia covering the two upper intercostal spacei Below, the clavi-pectoral fascia becomes thin, and forms the sheath of the pectoral minor. At the lower border of this muscle it joins the axillary fascia. p 3. The axillary fascia is a strong membrane which stretches across the trianguk A,309 PECTOBALIS MAJOR oor of the axilla. In front, it joins the pectoral and clavi-pectoral fasciae ; behind, , joins the sheath of the latissimus dorsi; above, it is continuous with the deep iscia of the upper arm, and below with that of the thorax. The concavity of its surface, which is directed downwards and outwards, is laintained to a great extent by the attachment of the clavi-pectoral fascia above lentioned. . i FiEST Layer I PECTORALIS MAJOE The pectoralis major—named from its being the larger of the two muscles which irise from the front of the chest (pec^z^s=breast)—is a thick, triangular, fan-shaped leet; or, more accurately, it may be likened to the sector of a circle on account of le curved origin, from which all the fibres converge to the upper part of the nmerus as a centre. Fig. 264.—The Pectoralis Major and Deltoid. \ Origin.—(1) The anterior surface of the inner half of the clavicle and the jijacent part of ,the sterno-clavicular joint; (2) the side of the front of the 'ernum, from the sterno-clavicular joint to the lower extremity of the gladiolus ; !) the front of the cartilages of the second to the sixth ribs; (4) a small part of le outer surface of the sixth rib close to its anterior extremity; (5) the upper310 THE MUSCLES part of the aponeurosis of the external oblique muscle which forms the front of the sheath of the rectus abdominis. Insertion.—(1) The external bicipital ridge of the humerus from the greatei tuberosity down to the impression for the deltoid ; (2) adjacent fibrous structures.} especially the tendon of insertion of the deltoid muscle. I Structure.—The clavicular portion is distinct from the rest, and might be described as a separate muscle. It forms a thick band of parallel fibres, which, arismg tendinous from the clavicle, become almost immediately fleshy, and are inserted into the humerus by short tendinous fibres in front of the rest of thtl tendon of insertion. I The rest of the muscle (the sterno-costal portion as it is usually named) consist^ of fleshy fibres which, arising directly from the four points of origin alread}i enumerated, converge and cross one another to be inserted into the humerus behmc' the clavicular portion by means of a peculiar tendon. \ In a vertical section (fig. 271) near the humerus this tendon is seen to be foldeci upon itself into a compressed horseshoe-shape. The convexity of the folded tender! is directed downwards, and the anterior segment of the horseshoe is shorter thai' the posterior. The anterior segment receives the muscular fibres which proceed from tha, part of the origm of the sterno-costal portion which lies above the third costa cartilage, and with the front of this segment the insertion of the clavicular portioi is closely blended. The posterior segment receives the fibres from the lower parj of the sterno-costal portion, the lowest fibres (viz. those from the external obliquJ aponeurosis) being inserted highest, and the highest (viz. those from the middle o' the sternum) being attached to the lower part of the horseshoe, where they becomd continuous with those forming the anterior segment of the tendon. ! In consequence of this arrangement the lower fibres of the muscle disappea:! from view soon after their origm, and are concealed by the clavicular and uppe:| sterno-costal fibres. This arrangement gives to the anterior border of the axillil a concave outline. Were it not for this decussation, the muscle would be broade and thinner, and would cause an inconvenient and unsightly projection in front of thi axilla. ! The sterno-costal portion may usually be divided into a superficial and deep plane, the superficial being composed of the sternal and external oblique origin ; th I deep, of the fibres which spring from the ribs and their cartilages. Nerve-supply.—From all the nerves of the brachial plexus :—(1) through th external anterior thoracic nerve, which enters the deep surface of the muscle jus below the middle of its upper border; and (2) through the internal anterio thoracic, which, after piercing and supplying the pectoralis minor, enters the dee; surface of the muscle an inch lower down, half-way between its origin anr insertion. j Action.—To adduct; flex, and rotate inwards the upper arm. By its claviculai portion it will draw the arm more directly forwards, as in round-hand bowline w^hile the sterno-costal portion will draw the arm more downwards than forwards The whole muscle will be used with great force in striking a blow downwards an<i forwards. When the arm hangs close to the side, the pectoralis major will dra^. the scapula forwards and downwards, so as to advance and depress the point oi the shoulder, as may be seen in a person shivering with cold. When the arm il elevated and fixed, this muscle will draw^the front of the chest up to it, as b. climbing. It will also raise the upper ribs in forced inspiration. Relations.—Superficially, the platysma myoides, the mammary gland, and thi cutaneous nerves from the descending branches of the cervical plexus, as well a: the lateral and anterior perforating branches of the upper intercostals. Beneath, lie the subclavius, pectoralis minor, and serratus magnus, the fasci' IPEGTOBALIS MAJOB- 311 SUBCLAVIUS hovering the external and internal intercostal muscles, the coracoid process, and iosto-coracoid membrane, with the structures which pass through the membrane, az. the cephalic vein, acromio-thoracic vessels, and the external anterior thoracic lerve. Further outwards it forms part of the anterior wall of the axilla, and enters nto relation with the axillary vessels and nerves. The upper border is separated from the deltoid by the cephalic vein and the 'lumeral branch of the acromio-thoracic artery. Variations.—The clavicular and sterno-costal portions are often widely separated, rhey may also be further subdivided into separate bands or sheets, and they may be ,,vholly or partly absent. Occasionally, the muscles of the two sides join across the hternum, or muscular bands may join the sternal ends of the clavicle. Bands may cross Tom the axillary border to the latissimus dorsi or the deep fascia of the upper arm ; ieeper bands may also pass to the insertion of the pectoralis minor, or the capsule of the Lhoulder joint. I Second Layer 1. SUBCLAVIUS I The subelavius—named from its position beneath the clavicle (=clavis)—is iilmost cylindrical, but may be more accurately described as a thick sheet of the l^hape of a low obtuse-angled triangle, the obtuse angle being contained between the clavicular attachment and the inner free border of the muscle. Fig. 265.—The Subclavius and the Upper Portion of the Serratus Magnus. Subelavius Serratus magnus Origin.—The upper and anterior surface of the first rib and its cartilage at their pomt of junction. Insertion.—The groove on the lower surface of the clavicle from the rhomboid impression to the conoid tubercle. Structure.—It arises by a strong tendon, flattened from before backwards, which lies close to the front of the rhomboid ligament, and is continued for a con- siderable distance along the lower border of the muscle. Its insertion is by fleshy ! fibres which radiate upwards, outwards, and a little backwards, in a penniform manner, from this tendon ; the inner ascending more vertically, and the outer very obliquely. 1 Nerve-supply.—From the brachial plexus by a small branch which, arising !Erom the fifth and sixth cervical nerves, passes behind the clavicle and enters the Imiddle of the back of the muscle. j Action.—To draw the outer end of the clavicle, and with it the point of the [shoulder, downwards and slightly forwards ; but chiefly by pulling the bone inwards k312 THE MUSCLES to supplement the ligaments which prevent dislocation of the sterno-clavicular ^ joint. J' Relations.—In front, the clavi-pectoral fascia and the pectoralis major ; behind,' (,r Fig. 266.—The Pectoralis Minor, Obliquus Internus, Pyramidalis, and Kectus Abdominis.

Variations.—The subclavius may be absent, or its insertion may extend to the coracoid Drocess, transverse ligament, and upper border of the scapula. Occasionally the costo- clavicular portion is separate from the costo-scapular. Again, its origin may extend nwards to the sternum, and the portion which arises from the sternum may be separate xom the rest of the muscle. : 2. PECTOEALIS MINOR The pectoralis minor—named from its being the smaller of the two muscles jvhich arise from the front of the chest—is a fan-shaped or triangular sheet, with its Inner edge divided into three teeth. ' Origin.—(1) The upper borders and outer surfaces of the third, fourth, and fifth ibs near their anterior extremities ; (2) the fascia covering the intercostal muscles jn the spaces between these ribs. I Insertion.—-(1) The upper surface of the coracoid process of the scapula ; ■ 2) the upper part of the tendon of the coraco-brachialis along its inner border. Structure.—Its origin is by aponeurotic slips, which, after becoming fleshy, !onverge upwards, outwards, and somewhat backwards, upon the flattened tendon, yhich is attached chiefly to the coracoid process, but blends for an inch or more )elow that process with the origin of the coraco-brachialis. Nerve-supply.—From the inner cord of the brachial plexus (through the iighth cervical nerve) by the internal anterior thoracic, which enters its deep surface learthe upper border, the nerve subsequently piercing the muscle to send fllaments 0 the pectoralis major. Its action is to draw downwards and forwards the scapula, depressing at the liame time the point of the shoulder. Taking its fixed point from the coracoid process, it dtaws upwards and outwards the ribs to which it is attached, and ;o helps in forced inspiration. Its connection with the tendon of the coraco- )rachialis will enable it to act slightly as a flexor and adductor of the humerus, j Relations.—Superficially, the pectoralis major ; deeply, the external intercostal inuscles ; and, near its insertion, the axillary vessels and brachial nerves. Variations.—The origin may extend upwards as far as the second, or downwards to he sixth rib, and it may receive additions from the pectoralis major. It is occasionally altogether absent. Its insertion may be continued over the coracoid process to the iapsnle of the shoulder joint, the greater tuberosity of the humerus, or the clavicle. « I Third Layer I SERRATUS MAGNUS The serratus magnus—named from its serrated or saw-like anterior border and arge size—is an irregular quadrilateral sheet curved to the shape of the side of the borax. Its anterior attached border has a somewhat sinuous curve, and arises from j he side of the thorax by nine or ten digitations or teeth, which, by their saw-lil^e i-ppearance, give the muscle its name. The muscle may be divided into an upper, niddle, and lower part. Origin.—First part, by two teeth from the middle of the outer surface of the lirst and second ribs, and from the fascia covering the first intercostal space. Second part, by two or three heads from the second, third, and sometimes the ourth ribs upon their outer surface. Third part, by far the largest and strongest )ortion of the muscle, arises from the fourth or fifth to the eighth or ninth ribs by t series of teeth, which are attached in front near the upper border of each rib, and314 THE MUSCLES behind to a line running backwards across the outer surface of the rib from its upper to its lower border. These attachments form a curved line with the convexity forwards, the attachment to the sixth rib being the most anterior and prominent. Insertion.—The first part is attached to an oval space upon the venter of the j scapula close to the posterior superior angle. The second part, to the whole of ; the vertebral border of the scapula upon its ventral aspect. The third part to i the large oval space on the venter of the scapula close to its inferior angle. | Structure.—The origin of the muscle is by fleshy or short aponeurotic fibres, ' Fig. 267.—Serratus Magnus. and in the first part these fibres converge very slightly towards their fleshy insertion. In the second part they diverge and form a thin sheet attached to the vertebral border of the scapula. In the third part of the muscle the fibres converge fanwise and form a very thick and strong fleshy mass which is inserted directly into the inferior angle of the scapula. At their origin the teeth of this part of the muscle interdigitate, that is, meet and fit in between, those of the origin of the obliquus abdominis externus. All the fibres are curved to fit on the convex wall of the chest. Nerve-supply.—From the brachial plexus by the posterior thoracic nerve, which is derived from the fifth, sixth, and seventh cervical nerves. After running down the side of the chest upon the outer surface of the muscle, the nerve is distributed by many branches to the various digitations. Action.—By its contraction this muscle draws forwards the vertebral border of the scapula and, as the third part of it is much the strongest, it will act especially upon the inferior angle, and will rotate the scapula so as to raise the point of the315 SEBBATUS MAGNUS shoulder. It will therefore help the trapezius muscle in lifting up the shoulder, and it will be brought powerfully into play whenever the shoulder is used in pushing in a forward direction. It is most important, however, in relation to the movements of the arm. In order that the deltoid muscle may raise the humerus, it is necessary that the fulcrum formed by the glenoid portion of the scapula should be held steady. j For this reason the scapula extends so far downwards in order that the leverage given to the third and most powerful portion of the serratus may be as great as possible. When the serratus magnus is paralysed, all the efforts of the deltoid to I elevate the arm are unsuccessful, and only cause the lower angle of the scapula to I project from the back of the thorax. "When the arm has been elevated to its full extent by the deltoid, that is, through about a right angle, the rotation of the scapula due to the serratus magnus and trapezius will produce a further elevation through another right angle, and so place the arm in a vertical position. One of the results of the action of this muscle is to keep the lower angle of the scapula in close contact with the wall of the thorax. When the muscle is paralysed, the posterior borders and the inferior angles of the scapulae project backwards from the thorax like ; small wings [scajml^ alatce). Acting from its scapular insertion, the muscle tends to draw the front of the chest towards the scapula, e.g. where it supports the thorax in crawling on the hands and knees. Judging from the direction in which its fibres are inserted into the ribs, most of them can have little if any action in elevating the ribs, as in forced inspiration. j Relations.—Superficially, the pectoralis major and minor, the subscapularis and latissimus dorsi, the subclavian and axillary vessels and the brachial plexus ; deeply, : the external intercostal muscles, and serratus posticus superior. Variations.—It may arise as low as the tenth rib; and above, it may receive slips from the cervical transverse processes, or the levator anguli scapulae. Part or the whole of the nrascle may be deficient. The second group comprises the muscles which pass from the scapula to the upper limb, and move the upper arm. Some of the most important adductors, flexors, and extensors belong to the first group ; but abduction and rotation in both directions are provided for by the second group. MUSCLES WHICH PASS FEOM THE SCAPULA TO THE I UPPEE LIMB These are nine in number, viz. the deltoid, supra-spinatus, infra-spinatus, teres j minor, subscapularis, teres major, coraco-brachialis, biceps, and triceps. The two ! last, however, as they act chiefly upon the forearm, will not be described in this group. The superficial fascia covering the muscles contains but little fat. The deep I fascia is thin where it covers the front of the deltoid, and is continuous with that which invests the pectoralis major. Behind, it is thicker, especially where it covers in the lower part of the infra-spinatus. Below, it blends with the deep fascia of the upper arm. Above, it is connected with the long prominences of the clavicle I and scapula at the upper border of the deltoid. It is also connected, either directly or by strong intermuscular septa, with the vertebral and axillary borders of the scapula. Processes from it cover the deeper surface of the deltoid, and form sheaths to \ all the muscles of this group. ll316 THE MUSCLES 1. DELTOID The deltoid muscle (figs. 262, 264)—named from its resemblance to the Greek | letter delta when inverted—is a very thick triangular sheet, with the apex j directed downwards, and with its plane curved upon itself from before backwards, j so as to wrap round the front, outer side, and back of the upper end of the ! humerus. j Origin.—(1) The anterior border and adjacent part of the upper surface of the | outer third of the clavicle; (2) the outer border and adjacent part of the upper ; surface of the acromion ; (3) the lower border of the spine of the scapula and : the fascia covering the infra-spinatus muscle, near the vertebral border of the i scapula. Insertion.—A rough triangular impression, with the apex downwards, and from ! two to three inches long, just above the middle of the outer surface of the I humerus. Structure.—At the front and back part of its origin it arises by short, tendinous fibres which end in parallel muscular bundles. At the middle part, strong fibrous septa three or four in number pass downwards from the acromion process into the substance of the muscle, upon the surface of which their outer edges are visible. The fleshy fibres of this part of the muscle arise both from the acromion and from the surfaces of these septa. The short strong tendon of insertion is prolonged upwards into three fibrous planes, which, as well as the tendon, receive the fleshy fibres of the middle part in multipenniform fashion. The muscular bundles from the front and back parts of the origin are inserted upon the anterior and posterior surfaces of the tendon of insertion. In front, this tendon is connected with that of the pectoralis major; below, it gives fibres to the external intermuscular septum, and also to the upper part of the brachialis anticus. Nerve-supply.—From the posterior cord of the brachial plexus (through the fifth and sixth cervical nerves) by means of the circumflex nerve. This nerve j enters the deep surface of the muscle by several filaments about half way between j the origin and insertion. j Action.—When all its fibres contract together, it will abduct the humerus j through a right angle. If the first and second parts act alone, they will flex and | abduct the arm, as when it is raised to the level of the shoulder and at the same \ time directed forwards. The posterior and middle portions of the muscle by their 1 contraction will abduct the arm, and at the same time extend it, as when the arm \ is elevated, and at the same time directed backwards. { The movements of abduction, or of abduction combined with flexion, are i through 90° ; of abduction combined with extension, only through 45°. In its action | the muscle forms a lever of the third order. The greater advantage v/hich it gains by its insertion at a considerable distance from its fulcrum at the shoulder joint is lost by the extreme obliquity of its direction. Hence the great thickness and strength of the muscle, and the facility with which this movement is lost ' by injury or disease. For the proper action of this muscle in elevation of the arm, it is necessary for the scapula to be held firm by means of the serratus magnus. Relations.— Superficially, the integument and deep fascia ; upon its front border, the pectoralis major, a small artery, and the cephalic vein ; deeply, the coracoid process and upper extremity of the humerus, the tendons of the pectoralis minor and major, the short head of the biceps, coraco-brachialis, subscapularis, supra- j spinatus, infra-spinatus, teres minor, the long heads of the biceps and triceps, the I outer head of the triceps, the coraco-clavicular and coraco-acromial ligaments, theDEL TOID—S UPBA-SPINA TUS—INFBA-SPINATUS 317 circumflex arteries and nerve, and a large bursa Avhich separates the muscle from Ithe greater tuberosity of the humerus and the structures attached to it; below, it comes into contact with the upper part of the brachialis anticus. Variations.—The clavicular portion of its origin may reach inwards as far as that of the pectoralis major, and the two muscles may blend along their adjacent borders. Behind, it may receive separate bands from the fascia infra-spinata or the borders of the scapula. • Occasionally transverse fibres have been found lying in the substance of the muscle close to its acromial origin. 1 2. SUPRA-SPINATUS The supra-spinatus—named from its position above the spine of the scapula— I is a somewhat fan-shaped, thick triangular sheet. Origin.—(1) The inner two-thirds of the supraspinous fossa ; (2) the upper surface of the spine of the scapula ; and (3) the fascia covering the muscle. Insertion.—(1) The upper facet of the greater tuberosity of the humerus ; and (2) the capsular ligament of the shoulder joint. Structure.—It arises by fleshy fibres which converge upon a tendon which is concealed in the substance of the muscle almost to the point of its insertion. Nerve-supply.—From the brachial plexus (through the fifth cervical nerve) by the suprascapular branch which enters the muscle upon its deep aspect near its upper border. Action.—It assists the deltoid in abducting the arm; it also strengthens the shoulder joint by resisting the tendency to upward displacement of the head of the humerus, and by drawing the head of the humerus firmly tow^ards the centre of the glenoid cavity. Relations.—Superficially, the trapezius, deltoid, and coraco-acromial ligament; deeply, the omo-hyoid muscle and capsular ligament, the suprascapular vessels and nerve. Variations.—It occasionally receives part of the tendon of the pectoralis minor. 3. INFRA-SPINATUS The infra-spinatus—named from its position below the spine of the scapula— is a fan-shaped, thick, triangular sheet. Origin.—(1) The inner two-thirds of the infraspinous fossa ; (2) the under surface of the spine of the scapula ; (3) the infraspinous fascia, and a thick inter- muscular septum which separates it from the teres minor and major muscles. Insertion.-^(l) The middle facet on the greater tuberosity of the humerus ; and (2) the capsule of the shoulder joint. Structure.—Its origin is by fleshy fibres which converge outwards in bipenni- form fashion upon the tendon. Frequently that part which arises from the lower surface of the spine of the scapula overlies and is somewhat separate from the rest. Its insertion into the capsule and tuberosity is by a tendon which is almost entirely concealed by fleshy fibres. Nerve-supply.—From the brachial plexus (through the fifth cervical nerve), by the suprascapular branch which enters the deep surface of the muscle at its outer part and near its upper border. Action.—It is the chief external rotator of the humerus. This movement of external rotation is through about 90°, and is of great importance. When the elbow is bent, it produces the lateral movement of the hand by which, in writing, the pen is carried from left to right across the page. When the elbow is extended, the rotation of the humerus adds considerably to the range of rotatory movementTHE MUSCLES 318 enjoyed by the hand. The infra-spinatus also adducts the elevated arm, at the same time drawing it slightly backwards, or extending it. It helps to hold the head of the hmneriis in contact Avith the glenoid cavity. i Relations.—Superficially, the infraspinons fascia which separates it from the ! deltoid, trapezius, and latissimus dorsi ; deeply, the suprascapular and dorsahs Fig. 268.—Back View of the Scapular Muscles and Triceps. scapulae vessels, and sometimes a small bursa which intervenes between its tendon and the capsule of the shoulder joint ; externally, the teres major and minor. Variations.—The slip from the imder surface of the spine is frequently almost as separate from the infra-spinatus as the teres minor, and sometimes there is no separation between the infra-spinatus and teres minor.319 TEBES MINOB—SUBSCAPULABIS . 4. TERES MINOR ' The teres minor—named from its being the lesser of two somewhat cylindrical muscles {teres=Yo\mdi or cylindrical)—is a thick but narrow triangular or fan-shaped I sheet. Orig^in.—(1) The impression which occupies the upper two-thirds of the axillary border of the infraspinous fossa ; (2) septa which separate it from the infra-spinatus behind, and from the long head of the triceps, the subscapularis, and the teres major in front. Insertion.—(1) The lower of the three facets of the greater tuberosity of the humerus and the posterior surface of that bone for one inch below the facet; j(2) the capsule of the shoulder joint. Structure.—From a fleshy origin which terminates in a point below, its fibres diverge as they pass upwards and outwards to their insertion, which is by a short strong tendon into the lowest facet of the tuberosity, and the capsule of the shoulder 1 joint; below the facet it is inserted by fleshy or very short tendinous fibres. Nerve-supply.—From the posterior cord of the brachial plexus (through the fifth cervical nerve) by the lower division of the circumflex nerve which enters the muscle upon its anterior surface near its insertion. The nerve is remarkable on account of the ganglion upon its trunk shortly before it passes into the muscle. Action.—The same as that of the preceding muscle, of which it may be con- sidered to form a part. It will therefore rotate the arm outwards and at the same time adduct. Relations.—Behind, the deltoid ; in front, the long head of the triceps, the teres major, and subscapularis. Above and internally, the dorsalis scapulae vessels run between it and the axillary border of the scapula. 5. SUBSCAPULARIS The subscapularis muscle—named from its position beneath the scapula—is a thick triangular and somewhat multipenniform sheet. Origin.—(1) The whole of the ventral surface of the scapula with the exception of the part near the neck, and the spaces at the upper and lower angles occupied by the serratus magnus; (2) the lower two-thirds of the grooved outer border of the scapula; and (8) the intermuscular septum between it and the teres minor and major muscles. Insertion.—(1) The lesser tuberosity of the humerus, and the part of the shaft immediately below it; (2) the front of the capsular ligament of the shoulder joint. Structure.—Its origin is by fleshy fibres from the surface of the bone, and also I by bipenniform bundles from the upper and lower surfaces of three or four septa I which are attached to the transverse ridges upon the venter scapulae, so that the whole muscle has a multipenniform arrangement. The fibres converge upwards and outwards upon a strong tendon which is hidden by fleshy fibres to within an inch of its insertion, the lower part of Avhich is also fleshy. A bursa intervenes between the tendon and the base of the coracoid process, and is usually in con- nection with the shoulder joint. Nerve-supply.—From the posterior cord of the brachial plexus (through the fifth and sixth cervical nerves), by the short and part of the lower subscapular nerves. They enter the front surface of the muscle, the former near its upper, the latter near its outer border. Action.—It is the chief internal rotator of the humerus ; at the same time it adducts it after it has been elevated. It also has an important influence in illTHE MUSCLES 320 strengthening the shoulder joint by drawing the head of the humerus towards the glenoid cavity. Relations.—Its anterior and internal face forms the greater part of the posterior wall of the axilla, and is in contact wdth the serratus magnus, the short head of thei biceps, and the coraco-brachialis, the axillary vessels with many of their branches, thej brachial plexus and its branches, the lymphatic glands and vessels ; its outer borderi lies in contact with the teres major, the posterior circumflex and dorsahs scapula| vessels, and the circumflex nerve ; behind lie the long head of the triceps and the; teres minor muscle, and the bursa which intervenes between its tendon and the, capsule of the shoulder joint. I Variations.—Occasionally a sei^arate slip arises from the axillary border of the scapula,' and is inserted into the capsule of the shoulder joint or into the humerus. Fig. 269.—Front View of the Scapular Muscles. G. TERES MAJOR The teres major—named from its somewhat cylindrical shape and its size—j is a thick ribbon-shaped muscle. Origin.—(1) The oval facet which occupies the lower third of the axillar} border of the infraspinous fossa ; (2) the infraspinous fascia and the inter! muscular septa, which separate the muscle from the teres minor and infra-spinatus Insertion.^—-The inner lip of the bicipital groove from the lower border of th( lesser tuberosity for about two inches down the humerus. Structure.—Its origin is by fleshy fibres which pass upwards, outwards anc somew^hat forw^ards, to be inserted by a strong tendon, which is first visible upon th(j outer border, and then upon the anterior surface of the muscle, and which is ii close relation with the back of the tendon of the latissimus dorsi. A small bursj intervenes between the two tendons. Nerve-supply.—From the posterior cord of the brachial plexus (through th(! sixth and seventh cervical nerves) by the lower subscapular nerve, which enters th(| muscle upon its anterior aspect close to the middle of its inner border. Action.—It assists the latissimus dorsi as a strong adductor, and in some posil tions of the arm as an internal rotator of the humerus. When the arm is fixed it will act with the latissimus dorsi in drawmg the bodj321 TEBES MAJOB—COBACO-BBACHIALIS ipwards, as in climbing. Its influence, however, will be exerted upon the lower angle ,f the scapula, while that of the latissimus dorsi is chiefly upon the trunk and pelvis. Relations.—In front lie the latissimus dorsi, both heads of the biceps, the loraco-brachialis, the pectoralis major, the axillary vessels, and the lower branches If the brachial plexus ; behind, the latissimus dorsi, teres minor, infra-spinatus, jhe long and outer heads of the triceps; between its upper border and the sub- capularis muscle are the posterior circumflex and dorsalis scapulas vessels, and he circumflex nerve ; below are the superior profunda vessels and musculo-spiral lerve. ' 7. CORACO-BKACHIALIS The coraco-brachialis—named from its attachment to the coracoid process and he upper arm ihracliium)—is a cylindrical muscle, but somewhat fusiform at he extremities. Origin.—(1) The tip of the coracoid process; (2) the inner side of the tendon )f the short head of the biceps. Insertion.—(1) The rough impression two or three inches long upon the inner )order of the humerus in its middle third, and in front of the internal intermuscular I septum (see page 322) ; (2) the internal intermuscular septum and an aponeurotic □and which extends upwards from the septum in front of the tendons of the teres najor and the latissimus dorsi to the lesser tuberosity of the humerus. Structure.—It arises from the coracoid process by a short tendon, which is jlended upon its inner side with the insertion of the pectoralis minor, and from he short head of the biceps by fleshy fibres for three or four inches below the 'oracoid process. From this origin the fibres run parallel to one another, and are nserted by a short tendon. The muscle is frequently divided into two planes between vhich the external cutaneous nerve passes. Nerve-supply.—From the outer cord of the brachial plexus (through the leventh cervical nerve) by the external cutaneous branch, which either pierces it ibout the middle upon its way to the biceps and brachialis anticus, or sends a )ranch to it in this position, while the rest of the nerve passes in front of the nuscle. Action.—To adduct and flex the humerus. As it lies at so small an angle with he axis of that bone, it assists materially in pressing the head of the humerus igainst the glenoid cavity, and so helps to prevent dislocation. Relations.—Superficially, the deltoid and pectoralis major; deeply, the sub- pcapularis, latissimus dorsi, teres major and triceps. Upon its outer side lies the [short head of the biceps; upon its inner side the pectoralis minor, the axillary and brachial vessels, with the median nerve and other branches of the brachial plexus. Variations.—The coraco-brachialis varies chiefly in its insertion, which may extend as jiiigh as the capsule of the shoulder or the lesser tuberosity, occasionally forming in this |)osition a separate muscle (the rotator humeri) ; or it may descend as low as the inner •ondyle. It sometimes sends a slip to the triceps or brachialis anticus. jjEOUP OF MUSCLES WHICH MOVE THE ELBOW JOINT Fascia of the Uppek Aem The deep fascia of the upper arm forms a strong tube, thicker upon the posterior j jlian the anterior aspect, enclosing all the muscles and most of the vessels and nerves. Above, it is continuous on the outer side and front with the fascia covering the ieltoid and pectoralis major, and internally with the axillary fascia. In the lower Avo-thirds of the upper arm it is joined upon its deep aspect by two strong I , YTHE MUSCLES 322 processes : the external intermuscular septum, which arises from the external con- dylar ridge and the outer border of the humerus ; and the internal intermuscular septum, which arises from the internal condylar ridge and the inner border of the humerus. The tube formed by the deep fascia is thus divided by the bone and these two septa into two compartments. In the front compartment are placed the flexors of the elbow-joint, and in the back compartment the great extensor muscle. : Fig. 270.—Superficial View op the FroNT of the Upper Arm. Flexoes of Tiif: Forearm The flexor muscles are three in number. The most superficial is the bicepj which arises from the scapula; while more deeply lie the brachialis anticus aBj brachio-radialis (supinator longus), which arise from the humerus.323 if BICEPS 1. BICEPS The biceps flexor cubiti—named from its two heads and its action—is a lick, somewhat flattened fusiform muscle with a bifid upper extremity. Origin.—(1) The short head from the outer side of the tip of the coracoid rocess, in close connection with the coraco-brachialis muscle ; (2) the long lead, from the upper border of the glenoid fossa of the scapula and from the lenoid ligament. Insertion.—(1) The posterior border of the tubercle of the radius ; (2) the pper part of the deep fascia on the front of the forearm, two inches below the iiier condyle of the humerus. Structure.—The short head arises by a short tendon from which the fleshy fibres iverge in a somewhat conical form until they meet and blend with the outer and l)nger head about the middle of the upper arm. The long head arises by a thick ribbon-like tendon three to four inches long, hich at its origin upon the upper border of the glenoid fossa bifurcates and lends with the glenoid ligament of the shoulder joint. It first passes outwards ad arches over the rounded head of the humerus. It afterwards enters the canal )rmed by the bicipital groove internally, and externally by the capsule of the joint, bgether with the aponeurotic expansion derived from the tendon of the pectoralis |iajor. Down to this point it is invested by synovial membrane, which is reflected pon it from the adjacent bone and capsule. After emerging at the lower end of le bicipital groove it gives origin to a conical mass of fleshy fibres, which meet jith the fibres derived from the shorter head about the middle of the upper arm. he fleshy bundles belonging to the two heads may be separated for a considerable istance by careful dissection. Shortly below the middle of the upper arm, the mdon of insertion commences as a septum between the two bellies of the muscle. 1 rapidly increases in thickness, and about the level of the condyles it becomes ee, and as a flattened cord passes down in the middle of the bend of the elbow tid turns upon itself so that its posterior aspect now becomes external; before its isertion into the posterior border of the tubercle of the radius it is separated from lat process by a small synovial bursa. About an inch and a half from its inser- on it gives off from its inner border a strong band of fibrous tissue three-quarters [ an inch broad and one inch long (the semilunar fascia), to the deep fascia )vering the ulnar surface of the forearm. Nerve-supply.—From the outer cord of the brachial plexus (through the sixth id seventh cervical nerves) by a branch of the external cutaneous nerve which iters the muscle on its posterior aspect near its inner border. I Action.—(1) It flexes the elbow joint by means of its radial insertion, and also 1^ the attachment of the semilunar fascia to the inner side of the forearm. (2) It jipinates strongly the forearm by means of the radial tendon which wraps round the ibercle of the radius. This movement will be most powerful when the elbow is 3nt to a right angle, as the tendon is then perpendicular to the bone, which it causes ) revolve. To increase its leverage, the tendon is lifted away from the axis of the jone by the prominence of the tubercle. (3) It will assist somewhat feebly in the j lovements of the shoulder joint, its short head being, like the coraco-brachialis, a lexor and adductor of the upper arm. By its long head it binds down the upper |ortion of the humerus, and prevents the tendency to dislocation upwards. When lie forearm is fixed, the biceps will help in flexing the elbow, as in climbing or in It: rawing up the trunk to a horizontal bar. Relations.—Superficially, the deltoid and pectoralis major, the deep fascia, and I the bend of the elbow the median cephalic vein ; deeply, the humerus, the Y 2324 THE MUSCLES brachialis anticus, and supinator brevis; upon its inner side lie the coraco- brachialis, the brachial vessels, and median nerve. The semilunar fascia separates the median basilic vein from the brachial vessels and median nerve. Fig. 271.—Deep View of the Feont of the Upper Arm. Variations.—The origin of the biceps is remarkably variable. Sometimes one of tl- heads is deficient. More often a third head is derived from the middle of the inn border of the humerus, and sometimes as many as three additional heads have been foui arising from the humerus. Occasionally it sends shps to the internal intermuscul septum, internal condyle, or coronoid process.325 BBAGHIALIS ANTIGUS—BBACHIO-BADIALIS 2. BRACHIALIS ANTICUS The brachialis anticus—named from its intimate relation with the front surface the bone of the upper arm (bmchium)—is a thick, somewhat fusiform sheet, rved from side to side to fit on to the convex anterior surface of the humerus, id shghtly bifid above. I Origin.—The whole of the lower three-fifths of the front surface of the humerus, |ith the exception of the small space on its inner aspect occupied by the coraco- achialis and the impression upon the outer aspect for the deltoid muscle, upon fcher side of which it sends up two small pointed processes ; (2) the front of the ternal intermuscular septum ; (8) a small portion of the upper part of the front of iB external intermuscular septum above the point where it is pierced by the usculo-spiral nerve. Insertion.—The inner and lower part of the rough triangular impression upon 16 front of the coronoid process of the ulna. I Structure.—The greater part of its origin is by fleshy fibres which converge iDon a tendinous sheet which makes its appearance at first upon the anterior irface of the muscle, just above the level of the elbow joint. This tendinous leet receives the converging fleshy fibres upon its posterior aspect, and becomes ::adually thicker until it forms a very strong tendon of insertion which is closely mnected with the front of the anterior ligament of the elbow joint. The lower id outer portion of the muscle is deeply grooved by the brachio-radialis (supinator •ngus), so that it often looks like a separate muscle. Nerve-supply.—(1) From the external cord of the brachial plexus (through the xth cervical nerve) by branches of the external cutaneous nerve which enter 18 anterior surface of the muscle near the inner border of its upper third ; i) from the posterior cord of the brachial plexus (through the seventh cervical erve) by a small filament from the musculo-spiral nerve which enters the front of lat part of the muscle which is concealed by the origin of the brachio-radialis iupinator longus). Action.—To flex the ulnar half of the forearm. Like the biceps, it will form a iver of the third order, but with much mechanical disadvantage on account [ the proximity of its insertion to the axis of the elbow joint. There will be, owever, a proportional gain in speed and range of movement. Relations.—In front, the deep fascia on the outer side of the arm which 3parates it from the cephalic vein, the biceps, coraco-brachialis, deltoid, bracliio- idialis, (supinator longus), and extensor carpi radialis longior, the brachial vessels, ledian and musculo-spiral nerves ; behind, the triceps and elbow joint. Variations.—The brachialis anticus is sometimes divided into two heads by a continua- on of the cleft between the two pointed processes above mentioned, or by a separation f a part of the outer half. Occasionally it gives off muscular slips to the radius or 16 fascia of the forearm, also to adjacent muscles such as the pronator teres, the brachio- lidialis, and the extensor carpi radialis longior. 3. BRACHIO-RADIALIS j The brachio-radialis (supinator longus) is described with the radial group of jiuscles (page 339).326 THE MUSCLES EXTENSOES OF THE FOEEAEM The extensor muscles are two in number—the triceps and the anconeus. | 1. TRICEPS The triceps extensor cubiti—named from its three heads and its action—formi a thick fusiform sheet wrapping round the posterior surface of the humerus in iti whole length. Origin.—The long head arises from the lower edge of the glenoid cavity anc the axillary border of the scapula for one inch below it. The external head arises (1) from the posterior surface of the humerus abovij the musculo-spiral groove, reaching as far up as the base of the greater tuberositv and the insertion of the teres minor ; (2) from the back of the external inter muscular septum above the point where it is pierced by the musculo-spiral nerve. The internal head arises (1) from the whole of the posterior surface of th humerus between the musculo-spiral groove and the olecranon fossa; (2) on th inner side, from the back of the whole of the internal intermuscular septum; (8 on the outer side, from the back of that portion of the external intermuscular septun which lies below the point where it is pierced by the musculo-spiral nerve. Insertion.—(1) The posterior part of the upper surface of the olecranon process and (2) on either side by aponeuroses which are continuous with the deep fascia aj the back of the forearm. ! Structure.—The long head forms a strong fusiform muscular band, arising b tendinous fibres which blend Vv^ith the lower part of the capsule of the shoulde. joint. The surfaces of the band at first look inwards and outwards. The tendo:l of origin extends for some distance further on the inner than on the outer surfacf, As the muscular band passes downwards, it twists upon itself so that what was tb internal surface now becomes posterior, and the external surface becoming thj anterior is applied to the back of the rest of the muscle. Upon this anterki surface the common tendon of insertion begins as a broad aponeurosis about thre| inches from the scapula, and receives the fleshy fibres of the long head in penn:! form fashion chiefly upon its upper border and posterior surface. These fleshj fibres are continued as a thick band along the inner border of this common tendoij and terminate in a blunt point a little below the junction of the middle and low(j thirds of the arm. | The external head arises by fleshy fibres which are inserted in penniforil fashion into the outer border of the common aponeurosis. The lowest of these fibr( arise from a tendinous arch which bridges over the musculo-spiral nerve. The internal head, which is much stronger than the outer, forms a thici triangular sheet, wrapping round the back of the bone, and arising also from til back of the intermuscular septa on either side. The apex of this triangle extend upwards along the lower border of the musculo-spiral groove to a point juj below the insertion of the teres major. Its fleshy fibres pass downwards arj somewhat backwards to the broad aponeurosis, which, after receiving the flesl{ fibres from the outer and long heads, completely covers the whole of the posteriij surface of the muscle in the lower third of the arm. A few fleshy fibres of th] head are inserted directly into the bone, and the adjacent posterior ligament ; tlj latter slip is sometimes called the subanconeus. The insertion of the tendon into the back part of the upper surface of tl; olecranon is usually separated from the adjacent part of the olecranon ai327 ANCONEUS the posterior ligament of the elbow joint by a small bursa. That part of the aponeurotic continuation of the tendon which lies between the olecranon process and the back of the external condyle is by far the stronger. Nerve-supply.—From the posterior cord of the brachial plexus (through the seventh and eighth cervical nerves) by means of the musculo-spiral, which supplies branches to the long and inner heads in the first part of its course ; and numerous other branches to the inner and outer heads while passing through the musculo- gpiral groove. Action.—To extend the elbow joint, the muscle acting as a lever of the first order, at a very great mechanical disadvantage on account of the short distance which intervenes between the olecranon process and the axis of the elbow joint; but at the same time with a great gain in speed and range of movement. Hence this muscle is the chief agent in movements of the arm in which great speed is attained, such as in throwing a stone or striking a blow. The long head has some influence as an adductor of the shoulder joint; it has also a supple- mentary ligamentous action upon that joint similar to that of the coraco-brachialis by holding the head of the humerus in close contact with the glenoid cavity. As it passes over both the shoulder and the elbow joints, the long head enables the powerful abductors of the shoulder to exert a peculiar influence upon the extension of the elbow joint. If it were merely a passive ligament, the long head would extend the elbow whenever the humerus was abducted by the deltoid muscle. As, jhowever, the long head contracts at the same time with the deltoid, we have an j apparatus by which, so to speak, a double rapidity of extension is secured for the |elbow joint. This attachment, therefore, of the long head of the triceps to the scapula is the chief cause for the rapid movements of the lower end of the forearm j which are made use of in throwing and striking. [ Acting from below, the triceps will extend the upper arm upon the forearm, as !in the use of the parallel bars, and in many other gymnastic exercises. Relations.—The long head lies behind the subscapularis, teres major, and latis- simus dorsi, in front of the teres minor, with the dorsalis scapulae vessels upon its posterior, and the posterior circumflex vessels and the circumflex nerve upon its anterior border. Lower down, the posterior surface of the muscle is only separated from the integuments by the deep fascia ; in front lie the brachialis anticus, brachio- radialis (supinator longus), extensor carpi radialis longior, and coraco-brachialis, with the superior profunda vessels and musculo-spiral nerve. A small bursa inter- K^enes between the tendon and part of the olecranon process. The muscle is also in relation with the shoulder and elbow joints. Variations.—The internal head sometimes arises as high as the greater tuberosity. An additional slip is occasionally received from the capsule of the shoulder joint, the coracoid 'process, or the tendon of the latissimus dorsi. A slip of muscle is frequently separated [from the lower border of the internal head, and, passing from the inner condyle to the olecranon, bridges over the ulnar nerve. I 2. ANCONEUS The anconeus is described with the Muscles on the Back of the Foeearm ,'page 345). i j MUSCLES OF THE FOEEAEM ! The muscles of the forearm are enveloped by a strong deep fascia which is con- jjinuous with that of the upper arm. It is thickest upon the posterior aspect, where [t is attached to the sides of the triangular posterior surface of the olecranon, uid to the whole of the posterior ridge of the ulna. Below the internal condyle 1328 THE MUSCLES it receives the broad band of the bicipital fascia ; and behind, the aponeurotic inser-1 tion of the triceps. In the bend of the elboAV it is pierced by a communicating | vein. On the outer side and back of the forearm the deep fascia has numerous connections mth the longitudinal ridges of the lower end of the radius and ulna. It also becomes much thickened by the addition of transverse bands, so as to form the posterior annular ligament, which passes from the outer border of the lower end of the radius, inwards and at the same time a little downwards, to the ulnar border of the carpus, where it is attached to the inner side of the pisiform and cuneiform bones. On its anterior surface this ligament is attached to the j ridges upon the back of the lower extremity of the radius, and so forms canals | through which pass the tendons of the long muscles upon the radial border and' posterior surface of the forearm. The ligament is also in contact with the lower | end of the ulna, which it binds in its place, much in the same manner as the head! of the radius is held in position by means of the orbicular ligament, but it has noi insertion into this bone. I In the front of the wrist the deep fascia forms a thin layer, which overlies thej anterior annular ligament. The latter is sometimes described as a thickening of the same fascia, but really it is continuous with a thin aponeurosis which separates the first and second layers of the muscles of the forearm shortly to be described, j It is a strong band of fibrous tissue, which stretches transversely from the pisiform: bone and unciform process on the ulnar side of the carpus to the scaphoid andj the trapezium on the radial side. MUSCLES OF THE FEONT OF THE FOEEAEM The muscles upon the front of the forearm form four planes or layers : the first two layers having their origins from the front of the internal condyle ; the last tw^o from the bones of the forearm alone. j First Layer \ The first layer consists of four muscles—the pronator radii teres, flexoi; carpi radialis, palmaris longus, and flexor carpi ulnaris—which all arise by a common tendon from the front of the internal condyle, and by separate attach-] ments from the deep fascia of the forearm and the intermuscular septa ; whilej the innermost and outermost have additional origins from the ulna. 1. PEONATOR EADII TERES ! The pronator radii teres—named from its action and somewhat cylindrica. shape—is a thick ribbon-shaped muscle. I Origin.—First head : (1) by the common tendon from the front of the internaj condyle ; and (2) from about half an inch of the lowest part of the internal condylar ridge ; (3) from the deep fascia covering it, and the intermuscular septunj which separates it from the flexor carpi radialis and the flexor sublimis digitorum. Second head : from the inner border of the coronoid process. Insertion.—The rough impression on the middle of the outer surface of th( radius. ! Structure.—The higher of the two heads, which is much the larger, arises partkj by a short tendon, and partly by muscular fibres, and is separated from the lowei head by a small tendinous arch through which passes the median nerve. Th lower head, which lies concealed by the rest of the muscle, arises by a smallI PBONATOB BADII TERES 329 iponeurotic band. The thick fleshy muscle passes obliquely'downwards and out- Uvards across the front of the forearm. Below the middle of its anterior surface begins the tendon of insertion, which expands and covers the whole of the muscle Fig. '272.—Front of the Forearm : First Layer of Muscles, Triceps Braehialis antieus Pronator radii tere Flexor carpi radiali Palmaris longu Flexor carpi ulnaris Flexor sublimis digitorum I for a short distance before it is inserted by a strong fibrous band into the special 1 impression for it upon the most prominent portion of the outward curve of the radius.THE MUSCLES 330 Nerve-supply.—FVom the outer and inner cords of the brachial plexus (through the sixth cervical nerve) by means of filaments derived from the median nerve just before it passes through the arch between the two heads. These filaments enter the muscle at its deep surface a short distance above the middle of its outer border. Action. —(1) To pronate the forearm. In supination, the tendon is to some extent wrapped round the radius, as the tendon of the biceps is in pronation. In contraction the muscle, so to speak, unwraps itself and so causes the radius to revolve around the axis, which passes through the middle of its head and the lower end of the ulna. Its insertion into the convexity of the curve of the radius places j lebic the line of the muscle as far as possible from this axis, and so gives it some | lebc^ mechanical advantage. On the other hand, the obliquity of its insertion diminishes ; the power of the muscle, and is one of the causes which make pronation a more j feeble movement than supination. (2) It will also assist in the flexion of the i forearm. I Relations.—Superficially, the deep fascia and superficial veins, the radial vessels j and nerve, and, lower down, the brachio-radialis (supinator longus) and radial j extensors. Deeply, the brachialis anticus, flexor sublimis digitorum, supinator j ^^^j^ brevis, and the median nerve. By its outer border it forms the inner boundary of j ^^^^ the bend of the elbow, and by its inner border it is in contact with the flexor carpi j radialis. \ Ijtni Variations.—The pronator radii teres frequently extends at its origin for some distance \ Iscia further up the internal condylar ridge. It may also receive a separate head from the | i[ internal intermuscular septum, the inner border of the humerus, or an abnormal supra- condylar process ; sometimes also from the biceps or brachialis anticus. This third head bridges over the brachial artery and median nerve. 2. FLEXOE CAKPI EADIALIS The flexor carpi radialis—named from its action as a flexor of the wrist and its position on the radial side of the joint—is flat and fusiform. | Origin.—(1) The common tendon from the front of the internal condyle; j (2) the deep fascia and the intermuscular septa which lie between the muscle and j the pronator radii teres, the flexor sublimis digitorum, and the palmaris longus. ! Insertion.—The front of the base of the second metacarpal bone ; and usually j by a smaller slip into that of the third as well. j Structure.—Its fleshy fibres are contained in an aponeurotic case which forms | an elongated four-sided pyramid, the apex being at the internal condyle, and the sides consisting of the deep fascia and the intermuscular septa which intervene j between it and the adjacent muscles. The fleshy fibres converge downwards and j somewhat outwards upon the back of the tendon which begins at the junction of the upper and middle thirds of the forearm, and is free soon after the middle of the forearm, ' Tj At the wrist the tendon passes through a special compartment external to the I feii tube formed by the anterior annular ligament. This compartment is bounded behind by the scaphoid bone and the groove upon the trapezium; externally, by { j,,^^ the tuberosity of the scaphoid bone and the ridge upon the trapezium; and in front and internally by a thickening of the deep fascia of the forearm. It is lined I by a special synovial membrane. Nerve-supply.—From the outer and inner cords of the brachial plexus (through \ the sixth cervical nerve) by filaments from the median nerve which pass to its ' I posterior surface in its upper third. ! h\ Action.—(1) To flex the wrist. By its insertion into the metacarpus it bends not only the radio-carpal joint (which is the wrist joint proper), but also the (] intercarpal and the carpo-metacarpal joints, which really take part in all the \% ietl I ^ \ koi I 11PALMABIS LONGUS—FLEXOR CARPI ULNARIS 331 Inovements of what may be called the lurist as distinguished from the lurist joint. 2) When the hand is fully supinated, it helps in pronation. (3) It is also a feeble lexor of the elbow. Relations.—Superficially, the deep fascia and the superficial veins ; deeply, the llexor sublimis digitorum, the flexor longus pollicis, the median nerve, the wrist and lome of the carpal joints; on the outer side of it lie the pronator radii teres and he radial vessels ; on the inner side it is in contact above with the palmaris longus. Variations.—The flexor carpi radialis may have a second origin from the tendon of he biceps or the radius, and its insertion may be extended to the base of the fourth -netacarpal bone or to some of the bones of the carpus. It is sometimes absent. 3. PALMARIS LONGUS The palmaris longus—named from its length and its insertion upon the palm bf the hand—is flat and fusiform. Origin.—(1) The common tendon from the front of the internal condyle; (2) ^:he deep fascia of the forearm ; and (3) the septa which lie between the muscle and ihe flexor carpi radialis, the flexor carpi ulnaris, and the flexor sublimis digitorum. Insertion.—(1) The upper end of the strong central portion of the palmar fascia ; '2) the lower part of the front of the anterior annular ligament; and (3) the deep fascia covering the thenar eminence. Structure.—Like the preceding muscle it consists of fleshy fibres which rise in 1 long four-sided pyramid from the aponeurotic case formed by the deep fascia and :he intermuscular septa. Its tendon appears first upon the anterior surface of the nuscle at the junction of the middle and upper thirds of the forearm, and is free about jhe middle of the forearm. It passes almost directly downwards to the middle of jthe wrist, where it descends in front of the upper part of the anterior annular ligament, and then becomes attached to its lower edge as well as the adjacent fasciae. Nerve-supply.—From the outer and inner cords of the brachial plexus (through fjhe eighth cervical nerve) by filaments from the median nerve which enter the deep surface of the muscle. Action.—(1) To flex the wrist ; (2) to a slight extent to flex the elbow also ; (3) it makes tense the central portion of the palmar fascia, so that when an object is grasped firmly by the fingers no injurious pressure is exerted upon the important vessels and nerves which lie beneath that structure ; (4) its attachments to the fascia of the thenar eminence gives a firm origin to some of the short muscles of the thumb. I Relations.—Superficially, the deep fascia and superficial veins ; deeply, the flexor sublimis digitorum and median nerve, and the upper part of the anterior annular ligament. Variations.—The palmaris longus is very variable. It may be double, and it is often absent. The fleshy belly is sometimes below, and the tendon in part or entirel}^ above. It may take an additional head from the radius or the coronoid process. Its insertion may be into tbe fascia of the forearm, the flexor carpi ulnaris, the short muscles of the little finger, or one of the carpal bones. j 4. FLEXOR CARPI ULNARIS I The flexor carpi ulnaris—named from its influence upon the wrist and its position—is a thick sheet of muscular fibre, somewhat fusiform in shape, which 1 wraps round the convex ulnar border of the forearm. ! Origin.—First head: (1) by the common tendon from the lower part of the front of the internal condyle ; (2) the deep fascia of the forearm, and the septa332 THE MUSCLES which intervene between the muscle and the pahnaris longus and flexor subhmis digitorum. The second head : from the inner surface of the olecranon process, and the upper two-thirds of the posterior border of the ulna. Insertion.—The upper surface of the pisiform bone, beyond which fibres are continued to the unciform process, and the front of the base of the fifth metacarpal bone. Structure.—The origin of the upper head is tendinous, and that of the lower is j partly fleshy, partly aponeurotic ; the aponeurosis from the posterior ridge of the | ulna being common to it with the flexor profundus digitorum and the extensor carpi ! ulnaris, and being closely blended with the deep fascia of the back of the forearm, j The two heads are united by a fibrous arch under which passes the ulnar nerve. | From this tendinous and bony origin the fleshy fibres pass downwards and forwards ' in a penniform manner to be inserted into the posterior aspect of a tendon which | appears on the front of the muscle a little above the middle of the forearm, and ! becomes free just above the wrist joint, where it lies superficial and internal to the anterior annular ligament at its insertion into the pisiform bone. Nerve-supply.—From the inner cord of the brachial plexus (through the ' eighth cervical and first thoracic nerves) by filaments from the ulnar nerve which j enter the deep surface of the muscle above the middle of the forearm. Action.—(1) Flexor of the wrist. The pisiform bone assists this action by lifting the line of the tendon a little from the metacarpal bone, much as the patella assists : the quadriceps femoris. (2) It assists somewhat feebly in adduction of the wrist, j (3) It helps in the flexion of the elbow. Relations.—Superficially, the deep fascia and superficial veins ; deeply, the flexor | profundus digitorum, the ulnar vessels and nerve. Near the wrist the ulnar artery lies along the outer border of the tendon. Variations.—Its insertion sometimes extends to the anterior annular ligament, and occasionally it sends a slip to the base of the fourth metacarpal bone. Second Layer The second layer consists of one muscle—the flexor sublimis digitorum. FLEXOR SUBLIMIS DIGITOEUM The flexor sublimis digitorum—named from its action as a flexor of the fingers, and from its position in relation to the deep flexor (sublimis = superficial)—is a fusiform sheet, with two heads above, and dividing into four tendons below. : Origin.—The first head arises from (1) the front of the internal condyle by the common tendon; (2) the intermuscular septum which separates it from the \ muscles of the first sheet ; (3) the internal lateral ligament; and (4) a tubercle at ; the upper part of the inner border of the coronoid process of the ulna. j The second head arises from the oblique line on the anterior surface of the radius. | Insertion.—By four tendons into the middle of the sides of the second phalanges | of the four fingers. i Structure.—The first head arises by short tendinous fibres from the humerus j and ulna, and from the ligament between them. The second head, which is much ! smaller, by fleshy fibres which form a thin sheet covering a part of the flexor longus ; pollicis. Between these two heads the median nerve and the ulnar artery are placed. : Converging from these two heads, the fleshy fibres occupy almost the whole breadth i of the forearm, but soon divide into a superficial and deep plane. From the former, !333 FLEXOB SUBLIMIS DIGITOBUM which contains the radial head and the more superficial fibres of the first head, the tendons to the middle and ring fingers are derived. The tendon to the middle finger receives the greater part of the radial head in penniform fashion, becoming Fig. 273.—Front of the Forearm : Second Layer of Muscles. I Biceps Triceps Muscles of first layer BracMalis antieus Plexor sublimis digitorum Flexor carpi ulnaris Plexor carpi radialis Palmaris longus BracMo-radialis Extensor carpi radialis longior Supinator brevis BracMo-radialis Plexor longus poUieis Extensor ossis metacarpi pollicis Extensor brevis pollicis free close to the anterior annular ligament. That to the ring finger separates high up, and is soon free from fleshy fibres. The deeper plane of the muscle is crossed by a strong tendinous intersection soon after its origin from the first head. It then334 THE MUSCLES gives off a fleshy band to join that part of the superficial plane which goes to the ring finger, and afterwards bifurcates to form the tendons for the index and little fingers. I am indebted to Professor Thane for calling my attention to this arrange- ment. Beneath the anterior annular ligament the tendons of the superficial plane, viz. those going to the middle and ring fingers, lie in front of the other two tendons. Here they are invested by the synovial sheath or great loalmar bursa, which is common to them and the other tendons which pass through this space, and which extends to about the middle of the palm. At the heads of the metacarpal bones the tendons enter the vaginal sheaths of the flexors of the fingers, and each tendon becomes concave behind to correspond with the convexity of the tendon of the deep flexor upon which it now rests. At the middle of the first phalanx the tendon splits, and the halves separate to allow the passage of the tendon of the flexor profundus. The two halves again unite opposite the base of the second phalanx in such a way that the parts now in contact are a direct continuation of what were before the borders of the tendon ; while the parts of the tendon which correspond to its mesial line above are now most widely separated. After a contact of about a quarter of an inch, the halves of the tendon again separate in order to be attached to the sides of the shaft of the second phalanx. Nerve-supply. —From the outer and inner cords of the brachial plexus (through the seventh and eighth cervical and first thoracic nerves) by branches from the median nerve which enter the deep surface of the muscle at its upper part. Action.—To flex the second phalanges of the four fingers. Being insertedFLEXOB PBOFUNDUS DIGITOBUM 385 ery obliquely, it acts under a considerable mechanical disadvantage, but at the ame time the speed and range of movement corresponding to a slight contraction f the muscle are very great. The size of the angle which it makes with the shaft f the phalanx at its point of insertion is somewhat increased by the raising of its endon from the palmar aspect of the first phalanx by the tendon of the deep flexor, ifter bending the second phalanx of the finger, it will bend also the metacarpo- halangeal joint; then the three joints which together produce flexion of the wrist; ,nd finally it will feebly assist in the flexion of the elbow joint. Relations.—Superficially, the four muscles of the first sheet and the radial essels and nerves; deeply, the flexor longus pollicis, flexor profundus digitorum, ,nd pronator quadratus, the ulnar artery and vein, and the median nerve. In the 'land, it lies beneath the anterior annular ligament, the palmar fascia, and the luperficial palmar arch, and upon the tendons of the flexor profundus digitorum i^^ith the lumbricales. Variations.—The fiexor snblimis digitorum varies very little in its origin. It has been leen to arise partly from the pronator radii teres. Occasionally its tendon to the little jinger fails, and the place of this tendon may be taken by a linnbricalis or a special slip from he flexor profundus. Sometimes accessory heads join the tendons in the hand from the lexor profundus or the annular ligament. Thied Layer The third layer consists of two muscles—the flexor profundus digitorum and the lexer longus pollicis—which arise from the ulna and radius respectively. 1. FLEXOK PROFUNDUS DIGITORUM 1 The flexor profundus digitorum—named from its action upon the fingers and jts relation to their superficial flexor—is a strong fusiform sheet of muscular fibres ,vhich wraps round the anterior and inner surfaces of the ulna, and divides below iito four tendons for the fingers. Origin.—-(1) The upper three-fourths of the anterior surface of the ulna ; and 2) the adjacent part of the interosseous membrane ; (3) the upper two-thirds [)f the inner surface of the ulna ; and (4) the posterior ridge of that bone by the iponeurosis common to it, the flexor carpi ulnaris, and the extensor carpi ulnaris. ! Insertion.—The front of the bases of the third phalanges of the four fingers. Structure.—Arising directly from the bones and fibrous structures which form the origin of the muscle, the fleshy fibres converge below upon the back of four Itendons, which, appearing about the middle of the forearm, become free at the ;apper border of the anterior annular ligament. That part of the muscle which is linserted into the index finger is separable from the rest of the muscle in nearly the whole of its extent; the part to the little finger is also generally more separable jfchan that to the other two fingers. As they pass beneath the anterior annular ligament, the tendons are invested by the common synovial sheath. At the meta- carpo-phalangeal joints they enter the vaginal sheaths belonging to their respec- tive fingers. Opposite the first phalangeal joint each tendon passes through the opening formed by the splitting of the flexor sublimis tendon ; and on the palmar aspect of the second phalanx it passes over a slight elevation formed by the union lof the two halves of the companion tendon before they are inserted into the sides jof the second phalanx. The deep tendon finally passes over the second phalangeal point, to be inserted into the front of the base of the third phalanx. In the palm of the hand the lumbricales (which will afterwards be described) arise from the tendons of the flexor profundus.THE MUSCLES 336 Nerve-supply.—By two sources from the brachial plexus (through the eighth cervical and first thoracic nerves) :—(1) By the anterior interosseous branch of the median nerve, which sends a filament to the portion of the muscle belonging Fig. 275.—Front of the Forearm: Third Layer of Muscles. Biceps Muscles of tlie first and second layers Flexor profundus digitorum- Pronator quadratiis Plexor carpi ulnaris BraeMo-radialis BracMalis anticus Extensor carpi radialis longior Supinator brevis Plexor longus poUicis Bracliio-radialis Extensor ossis metacarpi pollicis Extensor brevis pollicis 1 0 ,:fl if if jtel like fiiiati itoil U kert: 'kt to the index finger, and part if not all of that belonging to the middle finger upoi the radial border of its anterior surface, about the middle of the forearm. (2) B;;' the ulnar nerve, which distributes branches to the rest of the muscle near the inne border of the superficial aspect of the muscle in the upper part of the forearm. I ■FLEXOB LONGUS POLLICIS 837 Action.—It is a powerful flexor of the third phalanges of the fingers. As with jhe superficial flexor, the extreme obliqiiity of the insertion of the tendons gives g-reat speed and range of movement, but increases the mechanical disadvantage ^ith which this muscle (being a representative of the third order of lever) must act. The slight elevation formed by the union of the two halves of each tendon of the lexor sublimis upon the second phalanx diminishes to a small extent the extreme Dbliquity of its insertion. After bending the third phalanx, the muscle will assist .n the flexion of the other phalanges and the wrist. j Relations.—Superficially, the flexor sublimis digitorum and flexor carpi ulnaris, |;he ulnar vessels, the median and ulnar nerves ; deeply, the pronator quadratus and 'ivrist joint. In the hand, it lies beneath the tendons of the flexor sublimis digitorum jmd the lumbricales, and upon the adductor of the thumb, the interossei muscles, |ind the deep palmar arch. ! Variations.—The flexor profundus digitorum frequently receives, like the flexor longns 3ollicis, a slip from the superficial muscles of the forearm. Sometimes the part which lyoes to the index finger may take part of its origin from the radius; and occasionally slips may pass from the flexor profundus to the flexor longus poUicis, or vice versa. A [slip has been observed to end in the synovial membrane of the palmar bursa. ' ■ 2. FLEXOR LONGUS POLLICIS i The flexor longus pollicis—named from its action upon the thumb and its .ength as compared with the short muscles of the ball of the thumb—is a fusiform sheet. Origin.—(1) The anterior surface of the radius below the oblique line, with the exception of the last two inches of the surface ; and the adjacent surface of the interosseous membrane. (2) A second head arises from the inner border of the ^oronoid process of the ulna, but occasionally it may come from the internal j condyle of the humerus. Insertion.—The front of the base of the last phalanx of the thumb. Structure.—A penniform muscle arising fleshy from the bone and the inter- Dsseous membrane. The tendon first appears upon the anterior surface near to its alnar border about the middle of the forearm. It receives the fleshy fibres upon ts outer border and posterior surface and becomes free at the level of the wrist joint, where it enters the canal formed by the anterior annular ligament and the cront of the carpus. It is here invested by a special compartment of the great synovial bursa, and this compartment is continuous with the synovial sheath of the lendon as it lies in the thumb. After entering the palm of the hand, the tendon Dasses beneath the outer head of the flexor brevis pollicis, then through the groove !:ormed by the two sesamoid bones which belong to the tendons of this muscle, |ind, after lying in close contact with the concave palmar surface of the first phalanx of the thumb, it is inserted into the front of the base of the second 3halanx. Nerve-supply.—From the outer and inner cords of the brachial plexus (through he eighth cervical and first thoracic nerves) by means of the anterior interosseous )ranch of the median nerve, which sends filaments to it upon its anterior surface lear its ulnar border about the middle of the forearm. 1 Action.—It is a powerful flexor of the last phalanx of the thumb. It will also ilex its metacarpo-phalangeal joint, and afterwards it will assist the other flexors pf the wrist. 1 As the bones of the thumb are not in the same plane with those of the fingers, »mt rotated so that their palmar surface looks towards the rest of the hand, their ilexion will be accompanied by adduction; as when the thumb meets the other Z338 THE MUSCLES fingers in picking up any small object, or in grasping anything between the fingers and thumb. Relations.—Superficially, the flexor sublimis digitorum, flexor carpi radialis, brachio-radialis (supinator longus), and the radial vessels ; deeply, the pronator quadratus and wrist joint. In the hand, after passing beneath the anterior annular ligament, it is covered by the opponens pollicis and the outer head of the flexor brevis pollicis, and it lies on the inner head of the flexor brevis pollicis. Variations.—Besides the communication with the flexor profundus digitorum, we occasionally find slips passing from the tendon of the flexor longus pollicis to join the first Imubricalis muscle. The second head may be absent, as in fig. 275. Fourth Layer The fourth layer consists of one muscle—the pronator quadratus. PBONATOK QUADRATUS The pronator quadratus (fig. 284) is a thin quadrilateral sheet, named from itj action and its nearly square shape. Origin.—The inner part of the front surface of the lower fourth of the ulna. Insertion.—The low^er two inches or rather less of the outer border, the anterio: and the inner surfaces of the radius. Structure.—The greater part of the muscle consists of fleshy fibres whict pass transversely between its two attachments. Its inner third, however, ii covered by a strong aponeurosis which arises from the inner border of the ulna The radial insertion is of a somewhat triangular shape, the outer side of the triangl; passing obliquely from the interosseous line downwards, and joining the oute border of the radius a short distance from the base of the styloid process ; while thj inner side corresponds to the interosseous ridge, and the base crosses the front c] the radius above the attachment of the anterior radio-carpal ligament. Nerve-supply.—From the outer and inner cords of the brachial plexus (throug the eighth cervical and first thoracic nerves) by means of the anterior interosseou branch of the median nerve which terminates by filaments which enter the fror of the muscle near its upper border. I Action.—By drawing the outer border of the anterior surface of the radirj towards the inner border of the anterior surface of the ulna, it pronates the radii; upon the ulna. Relations.—Superficially, the flexor longus pollicis, the flexor carpi radiah' the flexor profundus digitorum, and the flexor carpi ulnaris, the radial and ulns: arteries, and the ulnar nerve ; deeply, the anterior interosseous artery, the inte' osseous membrane, and the inferior radio-ulnar joint. Variations.—The pronator quadratus is sometimes absent. It sometimes gives (j shps to the scaphoid or trapezium, the base of the first metacarr)al bone, or to the origii; of the short thumb muscles.339 BE A CHIO-BADIALIS EADIAL GEOUP OF MUSCLES Along the radial border, between the groups which clothe the front and back of the forearm, lie three long muscles, one upon the other—viz. the brachio-radialis (or supinator longus); the extensor carpi radialis longior; and the extensor carpi radialis brevior. * 1. BEACHIO-RADIALIS The brachio-radialis, or supinator radii longus—named from its attachment to the humerus and radius, and sometimes called the supinator longus from an erroneous view of its action—is a fusiform sheet. Origin.—The upper two-thirds of the external condylar ridge, and the front of the external intermuscular septum of the upper arm. Insertion.—The base of the styloid process of the radius. Structure.—Arising by fleshy fibres from the septum, and by short tendinous fibres from the condylar ridge, the muscle passes downwards and forwards in penni- form fashion to its tendon which lies first on its deep surface. Becoming free just below the middle of the forearm, the tendon runs directly downwards and expands before its insertion upon a horizontal line at the base of the styloid process of the radius. At first the plane of the muscle is directed outwards and inwards; but lower down the outer surface becomes anterior, and the inner posterior. Nerve-supply.—From the posterior cord of the brachial plexus (through the sixth cervical nerve), by branches from the musculo-spiral nerve which enter the upper part of the muscle upon its inner surface. Action.—To flex the forearm. Its insertion at the lower end of the long arm formed by the radius makes it one of the few examples of the second order of lever when the muscle is used to raise only the weight of the forearm ; but whatever advantage is obtained by the position of this insertion is lost by the extreme obliquity of the tendon. This obliquity (Introduction, page 300) will, however, add speed and range of movement, and at the same time it will assist in drawing the articular surfaces of the elbow together, and so give strength to the joint. If the forearm be fully supinated, the contraction of the brachio-radialis will cause some pronation; and it is only when the forearm is in the position of full pronation that it will produce a slight supination. It is therefore incorrect to describe the muscle as a supinator. Relations.—In the upper arm, it has at its inner side the brachialis anticus, iin which it forms a deep groove, and the musculo-spiral nerve and superior pro- funda vessels. Outside and behind lies the inner head of the triceps. Below, it 1 rests on the upper border of the extensor carpi radialis longior. In the forearm it is covered, above by the deep fascia and superficial veins ; below, by the extensor jOssis metacarpi and the extensor brevis pollicis. Beneath it lie the extensor carpi radialis longior, the supinator brevis, the pronator radii teres, the flexor sublimis digitorum, the flexor longus pollicis, the radial vessels and nerve. Variations.—The brachio-radialis is sometimes absent. It may receive a slip from the brachialis anticus. It may give slips to various parts of the radius, to the carpal bones on the radial side of the hand, to the tendons of the extensor carpi radialis longior, the extensor ossis metacarpi pollicis, the flexor longus pollicis, or to the supinator brevis muscle. z 2Fig. 276.—Muscles of the Eadial Side and the Back of the Forearm. 340 THE MUSCLESEXTENSOR COMMUNIS DIGITOBUM ' 341 if I 2. EXTENSOR CARPI RADIALIS LONGIOR The extensor carpi radialis longior—named from its action, position, and length "n comparison with its fellow extensor—is a narrow fusiform sheet. Origin.—(1) The lower third of the external condylar ridge ; (2) the front of the "xternal intermuscular septum; (3) the front of the common tendon by which the xtensors at the back of the forearm arise from the external condyle. Insertion.—The back of the base of the second metacarpal bone near its dial border. Structure.—Arising by fleshy fibres, this muscle has a somewhat penni- form arrangement. Its tendon is first seen near the outer border on the deep surface of the muscle, and becomes free at the junction of the middle and upper thirds of the forearm. It lies upon and in close association with the tendon of the short extensor, and passes through the second compartment in the posterior annular ligament to its insertion upon the metacarpal bone. Its surfaces, like those of the preceding muscle, are at first directed outwards and inwards, and afterwards forwards and backwards. Nerve-supply.—From the posterior cord of the brachial plexus (through the sixth cervical nerve), by a branch from the musculo-spiral nerve which enters the muscle at the upper part of its deep surface. Action.-—^(1) To extend the wrist; including under this appellation the carpo- metacarpal, intercarpal, and radio-carpal joints. It is also a slight abductor of these joints. When the fingers have to be bent by the long flexors, it steadies the carpus so as to limit the action of the flexors to the phalanges. (2) It has also some influence in flexion of the elbow joint. Relations.—In the arm, it lies between the brachialis anticus and the triceps, and it is covered by the brachio-radialis. In the forearm, it overlies the short radial extensor and wrist joint, while it lies beneath the brachio-radialis and the _extensors of the thumb. Variations.—The extensor carpi radialis longior may be united with the brevior. It may give tendinous slips to the bases of the first or third metacarpal bones, or to the trapezium; or a slip may join the extensor ossis metacarpi poUicis, or some of the interossei. 3. EXTENSOR CARPI RADIALIS BREVIOR The extensor carpi radialis brevior—named for similar reasons to those which give its name to the preceding muscle—is also flat and fusiform. Origin.—(1) The common tendon attached to the external condyle; (2) the intermuscular septa which separate it from the origins of the adjacent muscles ; and (3) the external lateral ligament of the elbow joint. Insertion.—The back of the bases of the second and third metacarpal bones near the lower part of their line of contact. Structure.—This muscle is thicker than the preceding, and its fibres have a more decidedly penniform arrangement, as they pass from their long fibrous origin obhquely downwards and forwards to the tendon which appears first upon the inner border of the anterior aspect of the muscle about the middle, and is free at the junction of the lower and middle thirds of the forearm. It passes through the second compartment of the posterior annular ligament with the tendon of the pre- ceding muscle. The tendons of this and the preceding muscle are invested in a synovial sheath as they pass through the posterior annular ligament, and a small bursa lies beneath each of them close to their insertions.342 THE MUSCLES Nerve-supply.—From the posterior cord of the brachial plexus (through the sixth and seventh cervical nerves) by filaments from the posterior interosseous branch of the musculo-spiral nerve which enter the upper part of the anterior surface of the muscle. Action.—(1) To extend the wrist; and (2) to feebly extend the elbow-joint. Relations.—It is covered by the extensor carpi radialis longior and the tendons of the three thumb extensors. It lies upon the supinator brevis, the pronator radii teres, the outer surface of the radius and the wrist joint. Variations.—Its muscular portion may be blended with that of the preceding muscle, or slips may pass between the muscles. The tendon is often divided, and may send ! separate insertions to the second and third metacarpal bones. MUSCLES OF THE BACK OF THE FOEEAEM The muscles upon the back of the forearm form two layers : the superficial, consisting of those arising from the back of the external condyle of the humerus ; and the deep layer, of those which, with one exception, arise from the bones of the forearm only. The superficial layer continues upon the back of the forearm the series of the radial extensors. It consists of four muscles : the extensor communis digitorum; the extensor minimi digiti; the extensor carpi ulnaris ; and the anconeus. I SuPEEFiciAL Layer 1. EXTENSOE COMMUNIS DIGITOKUM i The extensor communis digitorum—named from its common action upon the; four fingers—is fusiform and somewhat flattened, and divides below into fourj tendons. Origin.—(1) The common tendon from the lower part of the external condyle; (2) the deep fascia of the forearm ; and (3) the intermuscular septa which separate it from the extensor carpi radialis brevior, the extensor minimi digiti, and the supinator brevis. Insertion.—(1) The lateral ligaments of the metacarpo-phalangeal joints of the four fingers; the back of the bases of (2) the second, and (3) the third phalanges of the four fingers. Structure.—Arising from the interior of the aponeurotic case formed by the deep fascia and the intermuscular septa, the fleshy fibres soon break up into separate; masses, and converge upon the four tendons which, beginning about the middle ofj the forearm, become free a short distance above the wrist, and lie side by side in thei fourth compartment of the posterior annular ligament; those for the ring and littlei fingers being more closely connected than the others. After their emergence at the' lower border of the ligament, the four tendons, which still retain their flattened j cylindrical shape, diverge to their respective fingers. Opposite the head of the meta carpal bones, each tendon gives off fibrous bands to the lateral ligaments of the metacarpo-phalangeal joint. Upon the first phalanx the tendon expands into a broad aponeurosis which fits closely by its concave anterior surface upon the back of the bone and affords attachment by its lateral margins to other muscles. After passing over the back of the first phalangeal joint, the central portion of this aponeurosis is inserted into the base of the second phalanx, while its lateral343 EXTENSOR COMMUNIS DIGITOBUM ortions converge and, passing over the second phalangeal joint, are attached to the ack of the base of the ungual phalanx. A transverse band usually unites the Fig. 277.—Tendons upon the Dorsum of the Hand. Extensor ossis metaearpi poUieis Extensor brevis pollieis Extensor carpi ulnaris ■-^-y Extensor communis digit orum Extensor minimi digiti Extensor indieis tendons of the index and middle fingers above the heads of the metacarpal bones. A stronger band passes downwards and outwards from the ring finger tendon to that of the middle finger at the same level. The fourth tendon divides into two parts.344 THE MUSCLES The one joins with the tendon of the ring finger, which immediately afterwards gives off a transverse band to the extensor tendon of the little finger, and the other part joins the tendon of the extensor minimi digiti upon the metacarpal bone of the little finger. Nerve-supply.—From the posterior cord of the brachial plexus (through the seventh cervical nerve) by several branches from the posterior interosseous division of the musculo-spiral nerve which enter the upper part of the deep surface of the muscle. i Action.—(1) Chiefly to extend the first phalanges of the fingers. (2) It has^ some power of extending the second and third phalanges ; but this part of the tendon of the muscle is chiefly under the control of the lumbricales and interossei,! which are attached to the sides of the expansion covering the first phalanx. After; extending the fingers, it will also (8) help in the extension of the wrist ; and (4) to a slight extent, of the elbow joint. The bands by which the tendons are attached! to one another upon the back of the hand hinder independent extension, especially! in the ring finger. The little and index fingers, having special extensors, do not| labour under this disadvantage. Relations.—Superficially, the deep fascia and posterior annular ligament; deeply, the supinator brevis, the three extensors of the thumb, the extensor indicis. the dorsal interossei, the posterior and anterior interosseous vessels, the posterioi| interosseous nerve, the wrist and carpal joints ; on the radial side is the extensoij carpi radialis brevior; and on the ulnar, the extensor minimi digiti. !1 Variations.—Some of the tendons may be deficient, or more frequently the muscle -nist. divides into more than four tendons, two or even three of which may be attached tc one finger. Occasionally a tendon joins that of the extensor longus pollicis. 2. EXTENSOR MINIMI DIGITI !ervi ice 6£Ill0- tefoi ictio: lism isori teuli Dttter The extensor minimi digiti—named from its action upon the little finger—is small and fusiform. Origin.—(1) The common tendon from the back of the external condyle by i long fibrous process; (2) the deep fascia; and (3) the intermuscular septa whicl intervene between it and the adjacent muscles. Insertion.—With the corresponding tendon of the preceding muscle. Structure —Arising from the interior of the elongated case formed by th( various aponeuroses which diverge from the back of the external condyle, th( fleshy fibres, which do not begin till some distance below that point, are insertec into the radial border of a tendon which begins about the middle of the forearm and becomes free a short distance above the wrist joint, a little higher than thai of the corresponding part of the preceding muscle. Passing through the fiftt compartment of the posterior annular ligament, which lies upon the line of junctior of the radius and ulna, the tendon reaches the back of the fifth metacarpal bone, anc there blenis with the fourth tendon of the extensor communis digitorum immediately above the metacarpo-phalangeal joint. ; Itea Nerve-supply.—From the posterior cord of the brachial plexus (through thej jj^],^ seventh cervical nerve), by a branch from the posterior interosseous division of th( musculo-spiral which enters the deep surface of the upper part of the muscle. Action.—(1) To extend the first phalanx of the httle finger ; (2) to extend th(j k^^ second and third phalanges ; (3) to extend the wrist ; and (4) very slightly th(| elbow also. ^ , iltnid Relations.—Superficially, the deep fascia of the forearm and the posterioij annular ligament ; deeply, the supinator brevis, the three extensors of the thumbi 1^^^^ and the extensor indicis, the inferior radio-ulnar joint, and the posterior \345 EXTENSOB CABPI ULNABIS—ANCONEUS |)Sseous artery. On the outer side hes the extensor communis digitorum ; and on uhe inner, the extensor carpi ulnaris. t Variations.—The extensor minimi digiti is rarely absent, but it is sometimes blended [nth. the preceding muscle. Its tendon is often divided, sometimes into as many as three [slips. i I 8. EXTENSOE CARPI ULNARIS I The extensor carpi ulnaris—named from its action upon the carpus and its Dosition on the ulnar border of the forearm—is a fusiform sheet. Origin.—By two heads. The first head : (1) By the common tendon from the j)ack of the external condyle ; (2) the front of the deep fascia of the forearm ; and j 3) the intermuscular septa which separate it from the extensor minimi digiti, the jmconeus, and the supinator brevis. j The second head: from the posterior border of the ulna, by the aponeurosis (sommon to it, the flexor carpi ulnaris, and the flexor profundus digitorum. Insertion.—The back of the base of the fifth metacarpal bone, close to its ulnar jorder. Structure.—The fleshy fibres converge below upon the tendon of insertion, phich, beginning in the interior of the muscle in the middle of the forearm, soon becomes visible upon the radial border of the back of the muscle. It receives fleshy ibres in penniform fashion upon its ulnar border and deep surface nearly as far as ihe wrist, where it enters the sixth compartment of the posterior annular ligament, [md lies in a special groove to the outer side of the styloid process of the ulna. { Nerve-supply.—From the posterior cord of the brachial plexus (through the eighth cervical nerve) by branches from the posterior interosseous division of the uusculo-spiral nerve which enter the deep surface of the muscle about the middle )f the forearm. Action.—(1) To extend the wrist, acting upon the three articulations involved n this movement ; (-2) to adduct the wrist, especially when the hand is pronated ; [3) it will also help in the extension of the elbow joint. Relations.—Superficially, the deep fascia of the forearm, and the posterior bnnular ligament; deeply, the supinator brevis, three extensors of the thumb, extensor indicis, posterior interosseous artery, the inner half of the posterior surface l)f the ulna below the middle of the forearm, the wrist, and some carpal joints. On ;he outer side lies the extensor minimi digiti; on the inner, the anconeus muscle. Variations.—Frequently a small slip of tendon passes downwards to join the tendon of |he preceding muscle, the first phalanx, or the head of the metacarpal bone. Occasionally |."he fourth or even the third metacarpal bone may receive a slip. 4. ANCONEUS The anconeus—named from its intimate relation with the elbow (ayKwv)—is a riangular fan-shaped sheet. I Origin.—(1) The lower part of the back of the external condyle ; and (2) the idjacent part of the posterior ligament of the elbow joint. Insertion.—The rough triangular impression upon the outer surface (1) of the |i)lecranon, and (2) of the upper third of the back of the ulna. Structure.—This muscle is a continuation downwards of the lower part of the er head of the triceps. Arising by a short tendon, which is prolonged upon the eep surface of the muscle and along its outer border, the fleshy fibres diverge in fan shape, and are inserted either directly or by short tendinous fibres into the346 THE MUSCLES large special impression upon the ulna ; the highest fibres being nearly horizontal, and the lowest approaching more nearly to a vertical direction. Nerve-supply.—From the posterior cord of the brachial plexus (through the seventh and eighth cervical nerves) by a long branch from the musculo-spiral nerve, which, after passing through the inner head of the triceps muscle, enters the deep aspect of the anconeus close to its upper border. Action.—To extend the elbow, in association with the triceps, of which some authors consider it to form a fourth head. Relations.—Superficially, the deep fascia of the forearm ; deeply, the supinator brevis, the posterior interosseous recurrent artery which runs through the deeper fibres of the muscle, the elbow and upper radio-ulnar joints. Deep Layer j The deep layer consists of five muscles : the supinator radii brevis; extensor ossis metacarpi pollicis ; extensor brevis pollicis ; extensor longus pollicis ; and the extensor indicis. Four of these arise from the bones of the forearm, and one only from the humerus also. 1. SUPINATOR RADII BREVIS The supinator radii brevis—named from its action and size in comparison with the brachio-radialis (=supinator longus)—is a rhomboidal sheet of muscular fibre curved upon itself so as to form the greater part of a cylinder which wraps round the upper third of the radius. Origin.—(1) Lower and back part of external condyle ; (2) the external lateral ligament of the elbow joint; (3) the orbicular ligament; (4) the triangulai depression below the lesser sigmoid cavity of the ulna, especially along its posterioi margin, Avhich forms the upper part of the external border of the ulna. ' Insertion.—(1) The back of the neck of the radius ; (2) the anterior and outei surfaces of the radius above and at the upper border of the oblique line. Structure.—Its origin is partly fleshy and partly by a strong aponeurosis whicti covers the upper half of the muscle and gives attachment to some of the muscles ii the superficial sheet. The line of origin runs downw^ards and somewhat inwardsi from the external condyle to the outer border of the ulna, while that of insertior runs downwards and outwards from the tubercle of the radius to the impressior for the pronator radii teres. Between these lines the fleshy fibres run in parallel curves wrapping round th( upper third of the radius. The muscle is divided into a small superficial and men extensive deep plane by the posterior interosseous nerve which perforates it on it; way to supply the muscles at the back of the forearm. The line of insertion ii broken at the tubercle of the radius by a notch in which lies the bursa in fron of the attachment of the biceps tendon. Nerve-supply.—From the posterior cord of the brachial plexus (through th< sixth cervical nerve) by branches derived from the posterior interosseous divisioij of the musculo-spiral nerve, which are given off from this nerve as it perforates th^ muscle. Action.—To supinate the radius upon the ulna. By its contraction the muscL unwraps itself from the radius ; the tubercle of the radius is drawn forwards, am the outer border of the bone backwards ; and if the radius at the commencemen of action be in the position of complete pronation, it will be caused by this muscl to revolve about the axis which passes through the centre of its head and th middle of the lower extremity of the ulna through nearly 180°. iry347 SUPINATOR BADII BREVIS The action of this muscle will, unlike that of the biceps, be unaffected by the isition of the elbow. %^ This completes the list of muscles by which the rotation of the radius upon the na is effected. The biceps and supinator brevis are the supinators; the pronator Fig. 278.—The Deep Layer of the Back of the Forearm. Anconeus Supinator brevis Extensor ossis metaearpi pollicis Extensor brevis pollicis Extensor longus pollicis Kadial extensors Flexor carpi ulnaris )/// Plexor proftindus digitorum Extensor indicis ' Extensor carpi ulnaris fHf iies and quadratus the pronators. It should be remembered, however, that\ :dinary pronation and supination are effected by a more complicated movement lan simple rotation of the radius, which would cause the hand to revolve around le axis of the little finger. The usual rotation, the axis of which passes through 16 line of the middle finger, involves a slight flexion and extension of the elbow ith some movement of the shoulder joint.348 THE MUSCLES Relations.—Superficially, the biceps, brachio-radialis, pronator radii teres,! extensor carpi radialis brevior, extensor communis digitorum, extensor minimi digiti, extensor carpi ulnaris, anconeus, the radial vessels and nerve, the posteriori interosseous recurrent artery ; deeply, the superior radio-ulnar joint. Variations.—A second head has been seen from the hmneriis near the insertion of the deltoid, and it may receive fibres from the brachio-radialis. 2. EXTENSOK OSSIS METACARPI POLLICIS The extensor ossis metacarpi poUicis, or abductor longus poUicis—named fron its action upon the metacarpal bone of the thumb—is a fusiform sheet. Origin.—(1) The outer division of the posterior surface of the ulna for a shor distance below the junction of the upper and middle thirds of that bone ; (2) thd adjacent portion of the interosseous membrane ; (3) the posterior surface of thil radius near the middle of that bone for about two inches below the insertion of thij supinator brevis ; and (4) the septa which separate it from the supinator brevis; extensor carpi ulnaris, and extensor longus pollicis. j Insertion.—(1) The small impression upon the radial side of the base of the firsj metacarpal bone ; (2) the fascia covering the ball of the thumb ; and frequentlj (3) the back of the trapezium. Structure.—A somewhat bipenniform muscular sheet arising by an origm whic] stretches obliquely downwards and outwards from the back of the ulna, at th upper part of its middle third, to the middle of the back of the radius. The tendo:j appears first as an aponeurosis upon the anterior aspect of the muscle just belo^l the middle of the forearm. The fleshy fibres pass obliquely downwards and oul| wards to be inserted upon the posterior face of this aponeurosis. This as it descendl thickens into a rounded tendon, which, becoming free from its muscular fibres jus above the posterior annular ligament, crosses the back of the two radial extensc! tendons, and enters the first compartment of the posterior annular ligament upo the outer surface of the lower end of the radius. After leaving this compartmen the tendon passes vertically downwards, lying upon the external lateral ligament ( the wrist joint and the radial artery, to be inserted into the first metacarpal bon From its anterior border a strong aponeurosis is given off to that part of the palmi fascia which covers the ball of the thumb, and which forms a part of the origin ( the abductor pollicis. Frequently this division of the insertion is indicated by groove running up the tendon, or by a more complete separation which may exteii as high as the fleshy fibres of the muscle. Nerve-supply.—From the posterior cord of the brachial plexus (through th seventh cervical nerve) by filaments derived from the posterior interosseous divisici of the musculo-spiral nerve which enter the muscle upon the upper part of i; superficial aspect. Action.—(1) It abducts and extends the first metacarpal bone, drawing tl thumb away from the middle line of the hand, and slightly forwards. (2) It abduc the wrist. It should be remembered that on account of the plane of the thun being different to that of the palm and fingers, its abduction involves a considerabj forward movement, which must not be confounded with flexion. I Relations.—Superficially, the extensor communis digitorum, extensor miniij digiti, extensor carpi ulnaris, the posterior interosseous artery, and posterii annular ligament; deeply, the extensor brevis and the extensor longus pollicis, tl two radial extensors, the radial artery, and the wrist joint. Variations.—The extensor ossis metacarpi pollicis may receive an accessory slip fro the radial group of extensors.XTENSOR BBEVIS POLLICIS—EXTENSOR LONGUS POLLICIS 349 3. EXTENSOR BREVIS POLLICIS The extensor brevis pollicis—sometimes called the extensor primi internodii )llicis, from its action upon the first phalanx (internodius) of the thmnb—is flat id fusiform. Orig^in.—(1) The middle of the posterior surface of the interosseous membrane st below the preceding muscle ; (2) an elongated impression upon the inner irt of the posterior surface of the radius extending from the middle of that bone ir about three inches downwards and slightly outwards ; (3) an aponeurosis which 3parates it from the preceding muscle. Insertion.—The back of the base of the first phalanx of the thumb. Structure.—A penniform muscle arising by short tendinous fibres. These soon 5Come fleshy, and pass downwards and outwards to a tendon which begins in the iwer third of the forearm upon the radial border of its superficial aspect. Lying sneath the tendon of the preceding muscle and in close connection with it, this ndon passes over the tendons of the radial extensors, runs through the first )mpartment of the posterior annular ligament, crosses the first metacarpo- alangeal joint on the ulnar side of the tendon of the preceding muscle, and len expands into a broad aponeurosis which is inserted into the whole of the osterior surface of the base of the first phalanx. Nerve-supply.—From the posterior cord of the brachial plexus (through the iventh cervical nerve) by a branch from the posterior interosseous division of the lusculo-spiral nerve, which enters the upper part of the muscle on the ulnar rder of its superficial aspect. Action.—It is a feeble muscle, the chief function of which is (1) to extend the etacarpo-phalangeal joint of the thumb ; at the same time it will assist the stensor ossis metacarpi pollicis in (2) abducting and extending the first metacarpal one; and afterwards it will assist in (3) the abduction of the wrist. Relations.—Superficially, the extensor ossis metacarpi pollicis, extensor com- unis digitorum, extensor minimi digiti, and posterior annular ligament; deeply, 16 radial extensors, the radial artery, the wrist and first metacarpo-phalangeal )ints. Variations.—The extensor brevis pollicis may be absent, or it may be blended with 16 preceding muscle. It may have insertions upon the metacarpal bones or the last ' alanx. An accessory slip has been observed from the external condylar ridge of the umerus. 4. EXTENSOR LONGUS POLLICIS The extensor longus pollicis, or extensor secundi internodii pollicis—named rom its action and length—is flat and fusiform. Origin.—(1) An elongated impression upon the outer part of the posterior surface f the ulna, extending from the middle of that bone for three or four inches down- wards and slightly outwards close to its external border. (2) The adjacent part of he back of the interosseous membrane, and a septum between it and the extensor adicis. Insertion.—The back of the base of the last phalanx of the thumb. Structure.—This muscle, which is stronger than the preceding, has also a nniform arrangement. Its fibres pass downwards and outwards from their fleshy Irigin to be inserted into the tendon upon the back of the muscle, which, appearing Ibout two inches from its upper extremity near its radial border, gradually ||liickens as it passes obliquely downwards and outwards. Becoming free from nuscular fibres at the upper border of the posterior annular ligament, it enters the350 THE MUSCLES deep groove which forms the third compartment beneath that ligament. At tb lower extremity of this canal it crosses obliquely the two radial extensor tender at the back of the wrist joint, and upon the back of the first metacarpal bone it Ht in close contact with the inner border of the tendon of the preceding muscle, an expands into a fiat and broad aponeurosis which covers the back of the fir; ^ phalanx before its insertion into the last phalanx. Whilst spread over the conve surface of the shaft of the first phalanx, it receives small tendinous insertions froi the abductor and adductor muscles of the ball of the thumb. j ^ The three tendons of the extensor muscles of the thumb enclose a triangnlsj space which is visible upon the outer side of the wrist joint, and is bounded by tt ^ tendons of the extensor ossis metacarpi pollicis and the extensor brevis pollic' upon its radial side, by the tendon of the extensor longus pollicis upon its uhu! ' side, and above by the lower end of the radius. Across this triangle stretches til ^'^ radial artery, in its passage beneath the tendons from the anterior surface of tl' fs wrist to the upper part of the back of the first interosseous space. i si Nerve-supply.—From the posterior cord of the brachial plexus (through tli seventh cervical nerve), by branches from the posterior interosseous division of tL musculo-spiral nerve which enter the upper part of the muscle upon its superfici| aspect. I Action.—It is (1) a strong extensor of the second phalangeal joint of the thuml: and afterwards (2) of the first phalanx. It will (3) extend, and at the same tin! adduct, the first metacarpal bone so as to draw the whole thumb in the extend({ |[ position backwards, and at the same time inwards. It will also (4) assist in tl: |^ extension of the wrist, and (5) in the supination of the forearm. j Relations.—Superficially, the extensor ossis metacarpi pollicis, extensor corj ,^ munis digitorum, extensor minimi digiti, extensor carpi ulnaris, posterior inte '--^ osseous artery, and posterior annular ligament; deeply, the radial extensors, t] 'jj radial artery, wrist, metacarpo-phalangeal, and phalangeal joints. ^ Variations.—This muscle may send a slip to the base of the first phalanx of the thuro l It may also receive a tendinous slip from the following muscle. I 5. EXTENSOE INDICIS The extensor indieis—named from its action upon the index finger—is flat ai fusiform. I Origin.—(1) An elongated impression which stretches downwards and slight outwards from the junction of the middle and lower thirds of the outer division the posterior surface of the ulna, immediately internal to the impression for t preceding muscle, but at the same time rather lower down, to within about an in of the lower extremity of that bone. (2) For a short space from the part of t interosseous ligament Avhich is adjacent to the lower part of this impressic (3) The septum betAveen it and the preceding muscle. Insertion.—The inner side of the aponeurosis of the first tendon of the extent communis digitorum. Structure.—This penniform muscle arises by fleshy fibres which pass obliqut/ dowuAvards and outwards to the anterior surface of a tendon which is first se|i upon the radial border of its posterior surface in the lower third of the forearm, aij, becoming free just above the wrist, passes beneath the tendon of the exten^r minimi digiti, and enters the fourth compartment of the posterior annular ligame ' where it lies beneath the inner tendons of the extensor communis digitoru It is then inserted into the inner edge of the aponeurosis of the tendon of t common extensor belonging to the index finger, at about the level of the metacar] phalangeal joint.THE PALMAB FASCIA 851 Nerve-supply.—From the posterior cord of the brachial plexus (through the venth cervical nerve), by a branch from the posterior interosseous division of the usculo-spiral nerve which enters the upper part of the muscle near the radial rder of its superficial aspect. Action.—It assists the extensor communis digitorum in (1) extending the index ger, and especially its first phalanx. At the same time, on account of its rection, it will (2) adduct the index finger, while the action of the extensor mmunis digitorum upon this finger is that of extension combined with abduction, will then assist feebly in (3) the extension of the wrist. Relations.— Superficially, the extensor communis digitorum, the extensor inimi digiti, extensor carpi ulnaris, and posterior annular ligament. Deeply, e dorsal interosseous muscle of the second space, the wrist, and some carpal ints. Variations.—The extensor indicis may give slips to the extensor longiis poUieis and to e middle finger. It may receive slips from the posterior carpal ligaments or the bases of e metacarpal bones, and these slips may be inserted into several digits, so as to form an tensor brevis digitormii manus. THE FASCIA OF THE HAND The dorsal fascia is a thin layer, continuous with the posterior annular ligament, d, like it, composed chiefly of transverse fibres. It covers the extensor tendons, d connects them together upon the back of the hand ; and upon the first phalanges blends with the aponeuroses which succeed to the tendons. Between the fingers C^ips down to join the superficial transverse ligament which forms the web by hich the bases of the fingers are connected. A deeper layer of the dorsal fascia covers the back of the dorsal interossei, and attached to the back of the metacarpal bones. THE PALMAR FASCIA The palmar fascia takes the place of the deep fascia in the palm of the hand, d is for the most part formed by the expansion of the tendon of the palmaris ngus. It is also continuous with the lower margin of the anterior annular liga- ent; it may be divided into a central and two lateral portions. The central division, hich is by far the strongest, is of a triangular shape, the apex being continuous 'th the tendon of the palmaris longus, and also attached to the lower border of e anterior annular ligament; the base corresponding to the heads of the four ner metacarpal bones. It consists in front of longitudinally arranged bundles of brous tissue derived from the palmaris longus tendon, and behind of transverse bres which continue those of the annular ligament. Below, the fascia divides into 'ur processes which join the ligamenta vaginalia of the finger tendons. Each of "ese four processes forms a bridge across the tendons, and is inserted, at the sides i the metacarpo-phalangeal joint, into the lateral and the deep transverse ligaments, his strong central portion of the palmar fascia is closely connected upon its anterior "face with the skin by fibrous septa, which form small compartments in which re lodged pellets of the subcutaneous fat. Upon its posterior surface it is smooth nd in contact with the synovial membrane of the great palmar bursa above, and f the thecas below. Between its four processes there are three spaces left through hich the digital nerves and arteries emerge. These are bridged over by transverse bres which connect the processes, and which form the superficial transverse gaments lying in the webs between the fingers.352 THE MUSCLES | j The outer division, or thenar fascia, is that portion of the palmar fascia which covers the ball of the thumb. It is connected above with the anterior annular ligament, the tendon of the palmaris longus, and an aponeurosis from the tendon of the extensor ossis metacarpi pollicis. After covering the short muscles of the thumb, it is continuous below with the ligamentum vaginale of the flexor longus pollicis tendon. The inner division, or hypothenar fascia, is of a triangular shape, the base being above and the apex below. Arising from the anterior annular ^ ligament and the deep fascia of the forearm at the inner side of the wrist, it ^ invests the short palmar muscles peculiar to the little finger, and terminates upon u the ulnar border of the hand close to the fifth metacarpo-phalangeal joint. It is covered above by the palmaris brevis. A deep layer of fascia covers the front of the interossei muscles, and is attached i by thin longitudinal septa to the posterior surface of the central part of the palmai i fascia. ! The ligamenta vaginalia are strong bands of transverse fibres which art! attached chiefly to the borders of the first and second phalanges, and serve tc ^ bind in their place the long flexor tendons. Opposite the joints the ligament^l are thin, and composed chiefly of obliquely decussating fibres. | The sheaths of the flexor tendons, or thecse as they are called, are blind tubeJ ] of synovial membrane which invest the back of the ligamenta vaginalia and th(| front of the three phalanges and the interphalangeal joints. They extend fronj the metacarpo-phalangeal joint to the middle of the last phalanx; and at th(i ; extremities of the tube the synovial membrane is reflected upon the surface of th(j flexor tendons. Small folds and cords containing connective tissue and blood: i vessels, and invested by the synovial membrane, stretch across the intervening space. These are called vincula accessoria (fig. 279). One set of these, tb ligamenta brevia, are of triangular shape, and pass directly forwards from thi; front of the lower part of the first and second phalanges to the back of thj . overlying tendons ; while the other set—which are called the ligamenta longa- , are small cords running downwards and somewhat forwards from the phalange to the tendons, at a higher level than the ligamenta brevia. The compartmeu! i of the palmar bursa belonging to the flexor longus pollicis tendon is continuoui with the theca of the thumb. The theca also of the little finger is close to, an . frequently in communication with, the lower part of the great palmar bursa upo: its ulnar side (fig. 274). MUSCLES OF THE HAND The muscles of the hand proper consist:—first, of a superficial one, which lie upon the palmar fascia ; and, secondly, of a deeper set, which may be divided into central group belonging to the fingers generally, and two other groups, which ai associated with the thumb on the radial, and the little finger on the ulnar side c the palm. Superficial Muscle of the Hand PALMAEIS BREVIS The palmaris brevis (fig. 280)—named from its position in the palm of tt hand, and its small size—is a small quadrilateral sheet. Origin.—(1) The front of the lower part of the anterior annular ligament aboi353 PALMABIS BBEVIS fets middle ; and (2) the adjacent part of the palmar fascia at the inner edge of its great central division. Insertion.—The deep surface of the skin and the subcutaneous fat, alono- the jalnar border of the upper part of the palm. j Structure.—Arising by fleshy and short tendinous fibres, this muscle passes in ttransverse fascicuh to its insertion, which is of a similar character to its origin, p belongs to that type of muscle of which the panniculus carnosus in the Fig. 279.—Diagram of a Vertical Section through the Middle of the Hand. •G-reat palniar|bursa •Anterior annular ligament Dorsal interosseous Lumbriealis Palmar faseia Flexor profundus digitorum Flexor sublimis digitorum Tlieea Ligamentum vaginale Vincula accessoria ower animals is the best example, and lies in the subcutaneous tissue superficial 0 the deep fascia like the platysma myoides and the superficial muscles ©f the ace. Nerve-supply.—From the inner cord of the brachial plexus (through the first horacic nerve), by filaments from the superficial division of the ulnar nerve which inter the muscle upon its deep aspect near its upper border. Action.—It draws the skin and the superficial fascia of the ulnar border of the A A354 THE MUSCLES hand towards the middle line of the palm, forming a deep dimple or groove upon the upper part of the ulnar border of the hand, and at the same time raising the soft parts into a prominent vertical ridge, the object of which appears to be to prevent the ulnar nerve and artery from being pressed upon when a hard substance is grasped by the hand. It also helps to deepen the cup-shaped hollow when the palm is used to convey fluid to the mouth. Relations.—Superficially, the skin; deeply, the hypothenar fascia, which separates it from the abductor and flexor brevis minimi digiti, the ulnar vessels and nerve. Variations.—This muscle may be entirely absent. Deep Muscles of the Palm of the Hand Central Group Consisting of two sets of muscles—the lumbricales and the interossei. 1 1. THE LUMBEICALES ^ The lumbricales—named from their resemblance to earth-worms (= lumhriciM —are four small muscles of a fusiform shape. Origin.—The two outer ones from the outer side of the first and second tendons of the flexor profundus digitorum ; the two inner from the adjacent sides of the second and third, and third and fourth tendons of the flexor profundus digitorumi respectively. All four are attached to the palmar aspect of the deep flexor, and thei origin begins at the lower border of the anterior annular ligament. Insertion.^—The aponeurosis of the extensor communis digitorum tendon on the radial side of the first phalanx of each of the four fingers. Structure.—Arising fleshy from the tendons of the deep flexor, the fibres coui verge upon a small tendon which becomes free a short distance above the metacarpo: phalangeal joint. The tendon passes in front of the deep transverse metacarpa ligament, below which it expands, and is attached to the border of the extenso: tendon. Nerve-supply.—From the outer and inner cords of the brachial plexus ; thtj first and second receiving small filaments from the digital branches of the medial i nerve, which enter the muscle near the radial border in the middle third of thei palmar aspect. The third and fourth lumbricales are supplied by filaments o the deep branch of the ulnar nerve, which enter their respective muscles in th middle third of their deep surfaces. \ Action.—Their chief action will be (1) to flex the first phalanges upon themetaj carpal bones ; and at the same time (2) to extend the second and third phalange! by their traction upon the sides of the extensor aponeurosis which covers the bac. of each of the first phalanges. In this action they assist the interosseous muscles but the lumbricales have this advantage over them, that when the second and thiri phalanges are flexed by the flexor sublimis and profundus, the lumbricales will fle| the fii^t phalanges with increased force, inasmuch as the tendons from which the j arise have been retracted, whereas the origins of the interossei are practically fixecj The first and second lumbricales will act feebly as abductors of the index and middl, fingers ; the third and fourth as adductors of the ring and little fingers. They wi j also have some influence, together with the interossei, upon the aponeuroses of th extensor communis digitorum tendons in binding them down upon the fir^.355 THE LUMBRICALES halanges. In this way they perform for the dorsal tendon a similar function that which is exercised by the ligamentum vaginale upon the two palmar ndons.

A A 2THE MUSCLES 356 Variations.—The fourth lumbricaHs is sometimes absent. They may vary in their origins, sometimes arismg from one, and sometimes from two adjacent tendons. Occa- sionally one may arise from the flexor longus poUicis tendon. They may be inserted into the ulnar side of a finger, or into the adjacent sides of two fingers. 2. THE INTEROSSEI The interossei—named from their position between the metacarpal bones—are seven in number, three being palmar and four dorsal. They are small muscles, of. penniform or bipenniform structure. Both sets are easily exposed to view by ai deep dissection in the palm, but the dorsal set is alone visible in the back of the^ hand. i Fig. 281.—The Palmar Interossei. The three palmar interossei are fusiform in shape. Origin.—They arise from the sides of the metacarpal bones : the first occup; ing the whole of the ulnar side of the second metacarpal bone ; the second, tl radial side of the fourth metacarpal bone ; the third, the radial side of the fifi metacarpal bone. j Insertion.—By small tendons (1) into the aponeuroses of the extensor tendo: upon the back of the first phalanges of the index, ring, and little fingers ; and ( the adjacent portion of the side of each first phalanx near to its base; the fii being attached to the ulnar border, and the second and third to the radial horde of their fingers. I Structure.—Fleshy fibres arising along the whole length of the metacari: bone are inserted in penniform fashion upon the tendon, which, beginning on t , unattached border of the muscle near the mWdle of the interosseous space, becoirl free just above the metacarpo-phalangeal joint, and passes beneath the del transverse ligament which separates it from the tendon of the lumbricalis muscl357 THE INTEBOSSEI A.t this place a small bursa separates the tendon from the deep transverse igament, and the lateral ligament of the metacarpo-phalangeal joint. Nerve-supply.—From the iniier cord of the brachial plexus (through the bighth cervical nerve), by small filaments which, coming from the deep branch of !,he ulnar nerve, pass into the upper part of the muscles upon their anterior aspect. I Action and relations.— Vide infra. I Of the four dorsal interossei, the first forms a thick triangular sheet, while the !)ther three are fusiform and prismatic. Origin.—From the five metacarpal bones, each muscle arising from the adjacent jmrfaces of the two bones bounding an interosseous space. i Insertion.—(1) Into the sides of the aponeuroses of the extensor communis liigitorum tendons ; and (2) the adjacent parts of the first phalanges. j Structure.—The fleshy fibres arise from the adjacent surfaces of the metacarpal Fig. 282.—The Dorsal Interossei. )ones in bipenniform fashion, and converge upon a tendon which, beginning about ihe middle of the interosseous space, becomes free just above the metacarpo- phalangeal joint, and then passes beneath the deep transverse ligament to its nsertion into the side of the aponeurosis, and into the upper part of the border of lihe first phalanx. j The j^7^s^ muscle is thick and by far the strongest, and forms with the adductor bohicis the fleshy web which fills the interval between the metacarpal bones of the thumb and the index finger. ' Its origin from the first metacarpal bone occupies he upper half of that bone, while that from the second is more extensive. It is nserted into the radial side of the aponeurosis upon the back of the first phalanx well as into the upper part of the outer border of that bone. The second is nserted into the radial side of the aponeurosis upon the first phalanx of the middle finger and into the adjacent bone. The third into the ulnar side of the aponeurosis upon the back of the first phalanx of the middle finger and intoTHE MUSCLES 358 the adjacent bone. The foitrth into the ulnar side of the aponeurosis upon the j back of the ring finger and the adjacent bone. Of the two heads of each of these! muscles, the one arising from the metacarpal bone of the finger into which the muscle is inserted, is always the larger. Nerve-supply.—From the inner cord of the brachial plexus (through, the eighth cervical nerve), by branches from the deep division of the ulnar nerve which enter the muscles at the upper part of their anterior aspect. Action of the interossei muscles.—Firstly, the common action of all the interossci is (1) to flex the first phalanges ; and (2) to extend the second and third. Their power of flexion depends upon their insertion into the sides of the first phalanges as well as the edges of the aponeuroses by which the backs of these phalanges are covered. The extension of the second and third phalanges depends upon the fact that the portion of the aponeurosis into which each of them is inserted is continued downwards to the bases of these phalanges. A good example of the action of these muscles and of the lumbricales is given in the movements of the fingers whicb hold the pen in writing. In forming the light upstroke it will be seen that flexioi: of the first, accompanies the extension of the second and third phalanges. Thi^ movement is due to the contraction of the lumbricales and interossei. On the other hand, the thick downstroke is formed by the extension of the first, and tht flexion of the second and third phalanges ; this strong movement being due to th( action of three powerful muscles, the extensor communis, the flexor sublimis and the flexor profundus digitorum. Secondly, the palmar interossei adduct th( index, ring and little finger towards the middle line of the hand which passe; through the middle finger. Thirdly, the dorsal interossei abduct the index, middL and ring fingers from the middle line of the hand. As the middle finger can bi drawn either to the radial or ulnar side from the middle line of the hand, it ha two dorsal interossei to abduct it. The first dorsal interosseous muscle will als' assist in adducting the thumb. Relations.—On the palmar surface of the interossei, separated from them b i the deep layer of fascia, lie the flexor profundus digitorum tendons and the lumbri cales, the adductor and part of the short flexor of the thumb, the deep palma arch above, and the deep transverse ligaments below; behind, lie the tendons c the extensor communis digitorum and extensor indicis, separated from the dorsi interossei by the deep dorsal fascia. ! Variations.—Sometimes the dorsal interossei receive small accessory heads from thj posterior carpal ligaments, the lower end of the radius, or the adjacent deep fascia, part of the first dorsal interosseous has been seen running separately from the front of tt, metacarpo-phalangeal joint of the thumb to the tendon of the first lumbricalis. Occij sionally the second dorsal interosseous is inserted upon the ulnar side of the index finge! so as to resemble the same muscle in the foot. Muscles of the Thenar Eminence These are four in number, and they form a fleshy mass at the radial border the palm, covered by the thenar portion of the palmar fascia, and called tl thenar eminence or ball of the thumb. They are the abductor pollicis, tl opponens pollicis, the flexor brevis pollicis, and the adductor pollicis. 1. ABDUCTOR POLLICIS The abductor pollicis—named from its action upon the thumb—is a small thi triangular sheet. Origin.—(1) The tuberosity of the scaphoid bone ; (2) the upper part of t.ABDUCTOR POLLICIS 359 ■idge on the trapezium; (3) the outer part of the front of the anterior annular igament; (4) the outer or thenar division of the palmar fascia by which the ball )f the thumb is covered; and (5) the slip from the tendon of the extensor ossis netacarpi pollicis which joins this part of the palmar fascia. Insertion.—(1) With the outer tendon of the flexor brevis pollicis into the Fig. 288.—The Deeper Muscles of the Palm of the Hand. radial side of the base of the first phalanx of the thumb; and into (2) the outer edge of the aponeurosis of the extensor longus pollicis upon the back of the first phalanx. Structure.—Arising by fleshy or short tendinous fibres, the muscle converges upon a short tendon which blends with the adjacent tendon of the flexor brevis. Nerve-supply.—From the outer and inner cords of the brachial plexus (through the sixth cervical nerve), by a branch from the palmar division of the median nerve, which, after passing under the anterior annular ligament, goes upwards and f360 THE MUSCLES outwards to enter the upper part of the deep aspect of the muscle near its ulnar border. Action —(1) To abduct, and (2) to flex the first phalanx of the thumb. As the bones of the thumb are in a different plane to those of the fingers, this movement will draw the thumb forwards and at the same time slightly inwards. By its insertion into the aponeurosis of the extensor longus pollicis, this muscle will help (3) to extend the last phalanx of the thumb. Relations.—Superficially, the thenar fascia, and the superficialis vol^e artery, which usually perforates the muscle; deeply, the outer head of the flexor brevis pollicis and the opponens pollicis. Variations.—As already mentioned, it receives occasional slips from the radial extensors of the carpus and the extensor ossis metacarpi pollicis. It frequently receives a thin muscular slip from the skin over the trapezium ; it may also be supplemented by the opponens pollicis or a small slip from the styloid process of the radius. 2. OPPONENS POLLICIS The opponens pollicis, or flexor ossis metacarpi pollicis, is named from its action, as it helps in opposing the thumb to the other fingers and at the same time is a flexor of the first metacarpal bone. It is a short, thick, triangular sheet. Origin.-—(1) The front of the ridge on the trapezium below the preceding; and (2) the outer half of the lower border of the anterior annular ligament. Insertion.—The whole of the outer border of the anterior surface of the shaft of the first metacarpal bone. Structure.—Arising by a short tendinous or fleshy origin, the muscular fibres diverge fanwise to their insertion. The lower border of the muscle is often so blended Avith the outer head of the next muscle that the separation is somewhat artificial. Nerve-supply.—From the same source as the preceding ; the filaments entering the anterior surface of the muscle near to the upper part of its ulnar border. Action.—To flex the first metacarpal bone, which it draws forwards and inwards. This movement, on account of the shape of the carpo-metacarpal joint, is accompanied by a certain amount of rotation inwards, by which the palmar aspect of the thumb is made to look backwards and inwards. Relations.—Superficially, the abductor pollicis and the thenar fascia ; deeply, and upon its ulnar border, the flexor brevis pollicis. It also lies upon the joint between the metacarpal bone and the trapezium. 3. FLEXOR BREVIS POLLICIS The flexor brevis pollicis—named from its action and short length in compari- son with the long flexor—consists of two heads : each forming a flat triangular sheet. Origin.—The outer head arises from (1) the outer two-thirds of the lower border of the anterior annular ligament; (2) the lower part of the ridge of the trape- zium. The inner head, from (1) the front of the os magnum ; (2) the front of the bases of the first, second, and third metacarpal bones ; and (3) from the front of the sheath of the flexor carpi radialis tendon. Insertion.—The outer and inner sides of the front of the base of the first phalanx of the thumb. Structure.—Arising by short tendinous as well as by fleshy fibres, the two heads become tendinous a short distance above the first metacarpo-phalangeal joint, and have imbedded in their substance sesamoid bones of a somewhat hemispherical shape,361 FLEXOR BEE VIS POLLICIS ad about one-sixth of an inch in diameter, which rest by small articular facets overed with cartilage upon the palmar aspect of the condyles of the first metacarpal one. Close to their insertion the tendinous fibres are blended with those of the bductor pollicis externally, and the adductor internally. In the inner head three iistinct divisions may generally be observed. The first or outermost division is a jmall fusiform slip which passes beneath the tendon of the flexor longus pollicis to i3in the outer head, and to be inserted into the radial sesamoid bone. The second 'Avision is fan-shaped, and its fibres, which form the greater part of the inner head, onverge to embra.ce the ulnar sesamoid bone. The third division lies under cover Fig. 284.—The Pronator Quadratus and Deep View of the Palm. Pronator quadratus Abductor pollicis TOuter head of flexor brevis pollicis ,Inner head of flexor brevis pollicis (flrst division) 'Opponens pollicis Inner head of flexor brevis pollicis (third division) -Inner head of flexor brevis pollicis (second division) -Adductor pollicis Dorsal inter- osseous Third palmar interosseous Fourth dorsal interosseous Second palmar interosseous Third dorsal interosseous Second dorsal interosseous First palmar interosseous of the second. It is a small fleshy slip, which arises from the ulnar side of the base of the first metacarpal bone, and passes downwards to be inserted with the adductor pollicis into the ulnar side of the base of the first phalanx. Some authors describe this third division as the inner head of the flexor brevis pollicis, and the first and second divisions as the adductor pollicis obliquus. Nerve-supply.—The outer head is supplied (through the sixth cervical nerve) by the palmar branch of the median, which enters the middle of its anterior surface near its ulnar border. The inner head is supplied (through the eighth cervical nerve) by the deep branch of the ulnar nerve which enters the upper part of its deep surface close to its ulnar border.THE MUSCLES 362 Action.—Both heads will flex the metacarpo-phalangeal joint of the thumb. The outer head will flex also the carpo-metacarpal joint, while the inner head will be an adductor as well as flexor of this joint. The former will act in association with the abductor and opponens, and will draw the thumb forwards and inwards, keeping it at some distance from the palm of the hand. The latter will act with the adductor, and draw it more directly inwards in close proximity to the palm ol the hand. Relations.—The outer head lies beneath the abductor pollicis, and in contact by its radial border with the opponens pollicis. The inner head is partly separated from it by the tendon of the flexor longus pollicis ; upon its ulnar border it is m contact with the adductor. In front of it lie the tendons of the flexor profundus with the outer lumbricales ; behind, are the third part of the radial artery and th( interossei muscles of the first two spaces. 4. ADDUCTOR POLLICIS The adductor pollicis, sometimes called the adductor pollicis transversus—. named from its action—is a thick triangular sheet. I Origin.—The front border of the shaft of the third metacarpal bone. Insertion.—(1) The inner side of the base of the first phalanx of the thumb (2) the inner side of the aponeurosis of the extensor longus pollicis which cover: the first phalanx. Structure.—Arising by short tendinous or fleshy fibres, the muscle converge upon a short tendon, which blends on its outer side with the inner tendon of th^ flexor brevis pollicis, and sends a fibrous slip to the inner side of the aponeurosi' of the extensor longus pollicis. Nerve-supply.—From the lower cord of the brachial plexus (through the eight) cervical nerve), by the deep branch of the ulnar which sends filaments to th' upper border and deep surface near the origin. Action.— (1) To flex the first phalanx of the thumb ; (2) to adduct and fle the carpo-metacarpal joint of the thumb ; (3) to extend the second phalanx of thi thumb. This latter action of the adductor and abductor pollicis is useful in man of the movements of the thumb, in which it will be found that the second phalan has to be kept extended, while its palmar aspect is being opposed to the tips o the other digits. Relations.—Superficially, some of the tendons of the flexor profundus digitorui and the two outer lumbricales ; deeply, the abductor indicis and the interossei ( the space between the second and third metacarpal bones. Part of the lowc border is subcutaneous. Variations.—The adductor pollicis is often difficult to separate from the inner head o the flexor brevis poUicis, the adductor obliquus, as it is sometimes called.ABDUCT OB AND FLEXOB BEE VIS MINIMI DIGIT I 363 ! Muscles of the HYroTHENAR Eminence These are three m number—the abductor mmimi digiti, the opponens mmimi ligiti, and the flexor brevis mimmi digiti. They lie under cover of the thin internal livision of the palmar fascia. 1. ABDUCTOE MINIMI DIGITI The abductor minimi digiti—named from its action—is fusiform and some- (vhat flattened. Origin.—(1) The lower half of the pisiform bone ; (2) the continuation of the tendon of the flexor carpi ulnaris below this bone. Insertion.—(1) The ulnar side of the base of the first phalanx of the little finger ; and (2) the adjacent portion of the aponeurosis of the extensor minimi ligiti. Structure.—Arising by short tendinous fibres, it soon forms a flat fleshy mass I which contracts slightly below, and just before its insertion, having again become tendinous, it is for the most part attached to the first phalanx, but it also sends a Ismail slip backwards to the extensor aponeurosis. Nerve-supply.—From the ulnar nerve through the eighth cervical nerve. It receives small filaments at the outer and deep aspect, usually from the deep palmar division of the ulnar nerve. Action.—To abduct, and at the same time flex, the metacarpo-phalangeal joint of the little finger; it will also assist, like an interosseous muscle, in the extension of the second and third phalanges. Relations.—Superficially, the hypothenar part of the palmar fascia and the Ipalmaris brevis ; deeply, the flexor brevis and opponens minimi digiti. Upon its radial border are placed the deep palmar branches of the ulnar artery and nerve. 2. FLEXOK BKEVIS MINIMI DIGITI The flexor brevis minimi digiti—named from its action—is small and fusiform. Origin.—(1) The ulnar surface of the hook of the unciform bone; (2) the adjacent part of the front of the anterior annular ligament. Insertion.—The ulnar side of the base of the first phalanx of the little finger. Structure.—Its origin and insertion are by short tendinous fibres, and the rest of the muscle is fleshy. Nerve-supply.—Through the eighth cervical nerve, from the deep branch of the ulnar nerve which sends filaments to the upper part of its deep and ulnar surface. Action.—To flex the first phalanx of the little finger. Relations.—Superficially, the hypothenar part of the palmar fascia, the lower part of the abductor minimi digiti, and the superficial palmar arch; deeply, the opponens minimi digiti and the fifth metacarpal bone ; and to its radial side lie the flexor tendons of the little finger. This muscle is closely connected with the previous one, from which it is separated above by the deep palmar branches of the ulnar artery and nerve. Variations.—It may fail, or be blended with the abductor or opponens minimi digiti. An accessory slip may come to it from the lower third of the ulna at its inner border, from the tendon of the flexor carpi ulnaris, or the deep fascia of the forearm.364 THE MUSCLES 8. OPPONENS MINIMI DIGITI The opponens minimi digiti (= flexor ossis metacarpi minimi digiti)—named from its action—is a triangular fan-shaped sheet. Origin.—(1) From the hook of the miciform bone deeper than the preceding; (2) from the adjacent part of the anterior annular ligament. Insertion.—The whole of the ulnar border and part of the head of the fifth metacarpal bone. Structure.—Arising by short tendinous fibres, the fleshy bundles diverge down- wards and outwards, and are inserted by short tendinous fibres. Nerve-supply.—Through the eighth cervical nerve, from the deep branch of the ulnar nerve which sends filaments to the upper part of its ulnar aspect. Action.—To flex the fifth metacarpal bone, and at the same time slightly to adduct it. This movement is observed when the palm is cupped, as when the hand is used as a scoop to lift water to the mouth. Relations.—Superficially, the abductor and the flexor brevis minimi digiti; and deeply, the interossei of the fourth interspace, and the deep branches of the ulnar artery and nerve. Variations.—It may receive a slip from the deep fascia of the forearm. THE MUSCLES AND FASCIA OF THE THIGH Superficial fascia.—The greater part of this is of loose adipose tissue, and, without any deep connections, is continuous with the superficial fascia of the abdomen and back. In the upper and front part of the thigh a deep layer of a mort membranous structure may be distinguished, and this has deep connections where the lower limb joins the trunk, being attached to Poupart's ligament, the crest the ilium, and the deep fascia just below its insertion into the rami of the pubeH and ischium. Below the inner half of Poupart's ligament several lymphatic glands are arranged longitudinally between these two layers of the superficial fascia. The deep fascia or fascia lata is a very strong layer of fibrous tissue, the fibres oi which are arranged for the most part transversely as an aponeurosis of investment but many of them, especially upon the outer side where it is much thicker, art longitudinal, and serve for the insertion of important muscles. The whole of the deep fascia forms a strong cylindrical tube investing all the muscles of the thigh It is attached above, in the groin, to Poupart's ligament, where it blends with the aponeurosis of the external oblique ; on the outer side and behind, to the outei lip of the crest of the ilium, and to the lower part of the vertebral aponeurosis upon the inner side, to the border of the tuberosity and ascending ramus of tbt ischium, to the descending ramus of the pubes, the symphysis pubis, aiK the anterior lip of the crest of the pubes. Below, it becomes much thinner and is continuous with the deep fascia of the leg ; it has also a deep attach ment to the tuberosities of the tibia and the outer surface of the head of th( fibula. The thickening of its outer portion, which passes down like a tendon totht external tuberosity of the tibia, and is also attached to the outer side of th( ligamentum patella3, is called the ilio-tibial band. From the deep surfacf of this great cylindrical tube are given off various processes which assist in th( formation of the sheaths of some of the more superficial muscles. There ar(|365 FASCIA OF THE THIGH Iso three strong intermuscular septa, which extend from it to the linea aspera ividing the flexor, extensor, and adductor groups of muscles from one another .t the upper part of the thigh, below the inner third of Poupart's ligament, is the aphenous opening, for the passage of the internal saphenous vein, which, after unning up the thigh in the superficial fascia, enters the deep femoral vein in this ituation. This opening is not, as might have been expected from the character 'f these openings in other parts, a mere circular foramen. It is formed by the ivision of the fascia lata into two parts, which do not unite together again, but j,re inserted separately along the line of attachment of the lower limb to the trunk. I^t begins below the inner third of Poupart's ligament, and is of a somewhat )val shape, measuring about one inch from above downwards, and half to hree-quarters of an inch from side to side.

Externally, the fascia lata is attached above along the whole length of Poupart's ligament, and its free internal edge arches inwards towards the spine of the pubes in front of the femoral vein. This external and broad division of the upper part of the fascia lata is called its iliac portion, and the free edge which lies in front of the femoral vessels is known by the name of the falciform ligament. Internally, the fascia lata is in close contact with the pectineus muscle which lies beneath it, and with that muscle it dips beneath the femoral vein and the sheath of the vessels to be attached to the ilio-pectineal line. This internal division is called the pubic portion of the fascia lata. The deep layer of the superficial fascia stretches across the opening, and is firmly attached to the edge of the falciform ligament. From the numerous openings which give passage to the vessels and lymphatics, it is here called the cribriform fascia {crihrum being the Latin for a sieve).366 THE MUSCLES MUSCLES OF THE FEONT OF THE THIGH In front of the thigh there is a group of four muscles, the chief function of which is to flex the hip joint. Two of these muscles arise within the abdomen, and two from the margin of the innominate bone. The two which come from within the abdomen are the psoas and iliacus, and they act together as one muscle, and have been described as such under the name of the ilio-psoas. The third and fourth are the sartorius and pectineus. 1. PSOAS The psoas, or psoas magnus—named from the Greek word i/^oa, meaning the muscles of the loins—is thick, rounded, and fusiform. Origin.—Inner part, by five processes which arise from (1) the sides of the intervertebral cartilages which intervene between the bodies of the last thoracic and the five lumbar vertebrae ; and (2) the adjacent part of the sides of the bodies of these vertebras; and between these processes from (3) tendinous arches which bridge over the sides of the bodies of these vertebrae. Outer part, from the loweri border and the front of the transverse processes of all the lumbar vertebrae. Insertion.—The lower and back part of the lesser trochanter of the femur. Structure.—With the exception of the small tendinous arches which span' the side of each of the four upper lumbar vertebrae from its upper to its lower border, and which give passage to the lumbar vessels, the whole origin of the muscle is fleshy. The fibres pass downwards and forwards in penniform fashion, but with a slight convergence, to the inner side of the tendon, which, beginning in the interior of the muscle about the level of the crest of the ilium, becomes free upon its outer and posterior surface a short distance above Poupart's ligament, while upon its inner surface it receives fibres down to its insertion. The muscle,! having hitherto run in a downward, forward, and slightly outward direction,! changes its course at Poupart's ligament, and passes downwards and backwards to be attached to the lesser trochanter of the femur. In its passage along the, brim of the pelvis and over the lower part of the iliac fossa, the tendon uponj its anterior and outer aspect begins to receive the insertion of the iliacus^ muscle. Between the tendon and the capsule of the hip joint which is in close connection with it, is placed a bursa which frequently communicates through j an opening in the capsule with the interior of the hip joint. ! Nerve-supply.—From the anterior primary branches of the second and third | lumbar nerves by filaments which are given off from the lumbar plexus whilst it is passing through the muscle. Action.—The psoas is a powerful flexor of the thigh upon the pelvis, e.g. in walking, running, or going upstairs. The change in the direction of the tendon after crossing the horizontal ramus of the pubes makes its insertion nearly per- pendicular to the axis of the femur. The psoas therefore acts with less mechanical disadvantage than is usual with the muscles of the limbs. It has been sometimes described as an external rotator of the hip ; and its insertion into the lesser! trochanter at the inner side of the femur would appear to favour this view; but a little consideration will show that, although it is attached on the inner side of the! femur, yet on account of the angle which the neck of the femur forms with its shaft j this point of attachment is really external to the axis about which the rotation! of the femur takes place. It will follow, therefore, that any power of rotation exercised by this muscle will be rather internal than external. j Acting from below, the psoas will flex the lower thoracic and the lumbar spinePSOAS 367 pon the pelvis and the pelvis upon the thigh, as when the body is raised from the 3clining to the sitting position, or when the trunk is bent forwards in rowing. Relations.—The front and inner surfaces are covered by the iliac fascia, which Ifc the upper part of the muscle is thickened, and forms the ligamentum arcuatum iternum of the diaphragm. In front lie also the peritoneum, the intestines, the 3nal vessels, the spermatic or ovarian vein, and the ureter. On the outer side is 16 iliacus muscle. In the interior of the muscle is the lumbar plexus, the nerves •cm which run for some distance in its substance. On the inner side lies the Fig. 286.—Psoas, Iliacus, and Quadratus Lumborum. . "External iliac artery; and behind is the vertebral column, the inner border of the luadratus lumborum, and the brim of the pelvis. In the thigh, after passing oeneath Poupart's ligament, it is covered by the femoral artery, the pectineus lies ilong its inner border, and the capsule of the hip joint lies behind it, together with the intervening bursa. I Variations.—Sometimes the part of the psoas which arises from the lower lumbar - ^vertebras forms a distinct muscle. OccasionaUy fibres from the psoas parvus join the 'psoas magmis.THE MUSCLES 368 2. ILIACUS The iliacus—named from its attachment to the ihum—is a thick, triangula sheet. Origin.—(1) The upper surface of the ala of the sacrum ; (2) the front of th ilio-lumbar, lumbo-sacral, and anterior sacro-ihac hgaments ; (3) the upper and oute half of the venter of the ilium ; (4) the origin of the upper tendon of the rectu femoris and the ilio-femoral ligament near the anterior inferior spine of the ilium Insertion.—(1) The outer surface of the tendon of the psoas, through whic it is attached to the back of the lesser trochanter of the femur ; (2) the upper an inner part of the shaft of the femur in a line about one inch long leading downward from the lesser trochanter. Structure.—Arising by fleshy fibres, the muscle converges in a fan-shape dowr wards and inwards, and its fibres enter the posterior and outer surface of the tendo of the psoas muscle from about two inches above Poupart's ligament to its insertioi The lowest fibres are also continued, still fleshy, into their insertion on the inne part of the shaft of the femur. Nerve-supply.—From the lumbar plexus (through the second and third lumbe nerves) by the anterior crural nerve, which gives branches to its anterior surfac about the middle of its inner border. Action.—Similar to that of the psoas, as a flexor of the thigh ; and acting froi the femur as a fixed point, it will draw forwards and flex the pelvis upon the thigl Relations.—The iliac fascia in front separates it from the peritoneum an intestines. The profunda femoris artery and several nerves from the lumbar plexi lie upon it. Behind, and to its inner side, lies the psoas. After passing undt Poupart's ligament, it is crossed by the sartorius, and behind lie the rectus femor and the capsule of the hip joint. Variations.—A small detached muscle occasionally arises from the anterior inferi( spine, and is inserted into the lower part of the anterior intertrochanteric line, or the ili- femoral ligament. Psoas Parvus The psoas parvus—a small muscle, only occasionally present, named from its positic in the loins and its small size—is fusiform and somewhat flattened. Origin.—The side of the intervertebral disc between the last thoracic and the fir lumbar vertebra and the adjacent borders of the bodies of these vertebrse. Insertion.—The ilio-pectineal line. Structure.—Arising fleshy, the fibres converi^e and are inserted in a somewhat penii form manner into the back and inner surface of a tendon which appears about two incln below the origin of the muscle upon its outer and anterior aspect, and becomes free aboi the level of the fifth lumbar vertebra. The tendon, a narrow fibrous band, lies upon tl inner aspect of the psoas magnus on the brim of the pelvis, and expands at its lowi extremity to be attached along the ilio-pectineal line and the pectineal eminence. Nerve-supply.—By small filaments from the first nerve of the lumbar plexus. Action.—To flex the pelvis upon the thorax; or, taking the pelvis as a fixed point, will flex the lower part of the thoracic spine as well as the lumbar spine upon the pelvi It is a muscle which is well developed in some animals, having for its function the drawii forwards of the lower part of the pelvis, accompanied by the arching of the lumbar spii which is seen when they are running swiftly. Eolations.—In front, the iliac fascia, peritoneum, Kgamentum arcuatum internm intestines, renal vessels, ureter, external iliac vessels, etc. Behind and externally, tl psoas magnus. Investing the abdominal portion of the ilio-psoas is a strong membrane, call( the iliac fascia, which is attached to the crest of the ilium externally, and internal to the posterior part of the ilio-pectineal line which forms the brim of the pelvis.SABTOBIUS 369 Between these attachments it invests the front of the ihacus and psoas muscles. \.bove, it is continued upwards as the covering of the latter muscle, at the sides of ^rhich it is attached to the transverse processes and bodies of the lumbar vertebrae, ,s well as to the intervertebral discs and the small tendinous arches which bridge he side of the bodies of these vertebrae. At the diaphragm it is thickened, and forms, ^ijl^he ligamentum arcuatum internum; near the tips of the transverse processes of he lumbar vertebrae it is attached to the anterior layer of the lumbar fascia lie lid page 434). Below, it joins beneath the outer half of Poupart's ligament with the ransversalis fascia, but internal to this it passes downwards into the thigh, forming nth. the transversalis fascia the sheath of the femoral vessels. Still further wards, it is continuous with the pubic portion of the fascia lata which invests ^^liBhe pectineus muscle, and it also sends backwards a septum between the psoas ,nd the pectineus which is attached to the ilio-pectineal eminence. _ 3. SARTORIUS k The sartorius—named somewhat erroneously from sartor, a tailor, because it ^IjjBlas been supposed to be the muscle by which the cross-legged sitting posture is reduced—is a long, ribbon-shaped muscle slightly fusiform at the two ends. Origin.—The anterior superior spine of the ilium and the adjacent part of the lotch between this process and the anterior inferior spine. Insertion.—(1) The front part of the inner surface of the tibia, just internal to leiBh^ tubercle ; (2) the upper part of the deep fascia covering the internal surface of Structure.—Arising by short tendinous fibres, the fleshy fibres which are the ngest in the whole body, run parallel to one another inwards and downwards cross the front of the thigh, and after reaching the inner surface of the thigh about he middle, the muscular band runs almost vertically downwards to the back of the jftid aternal condyle of the femur. At this point the tendon of insertion makes its ppearance as an aponeurosis which covers the deep aspect of the muscle and ecomes free from fleshy fibres just below the knee joint, where it turns forwards nd covers the inner surface of the inner tuberosity of the tibia, being separated fom it as well as from the tendons of the gracilis and semi-tendinosus by a large ursa. The upper border of this aponeurosis is thick and tendinous and is inserted irectly into the bone. The lower part of the aponeurosis, which is of a much more Qembranous character, is continued downwards and forwards and blends with the eep fascia of the inner side of the leg, of which it is one of the chief constituents. Nerve-supply.—From the second, third, and fourth branches of the lumbar lexus, by filaments which are usually derived from the middle cutaneous branch f the anterior crural nerve as it pierces the muscle at the junction of its middle and .'TJ^pper thirds. Action.—(1) To flex the thigh, and at the same time rotate it slightly outwards nd abduct it. (2) To flex the knee, and when the knee is in the bent position it nil also help in rotating the leg inwards. (3) Being contained in the close-fitting heath formed by the fascia lata and its deep processes, it will tend when it con- Jjlj^l racts to draw the soft parts upon the inner surface of the thigh forwards, and so Qake tense the inner portion of the fascia lata. (4) Acting from below, it will flex he pelvis upon the thigh. Relations.—In front above lies the fascia lata ; internally below lie the fascia ata and internal saphenous vein ; beneath lie the rectus femoris, iliacus, pectineus, -dductor longus and magnus, vastus internus, and the inner hamstring tendons, the emoral vessels, the anterior crural nerve and its internal saphenous and vastus nternus branches. BB iltkf lie,THE MUSCLES 370 Variations.—The sartorius is occasionally absent; it may also be divided longitudinally.! It may have insertions into the fascia lata, or the ligamentmn patellae. A tendinous! intersection sometimes crosses the muscle. Fig. 287.—Muscles of the Front of the Thigh. Adductor brevis Adductor longus Adductor magnus Vastus internus Tendon of sartorius Gluteus medius Gluteus minimus Tensor vaginse femoris Rectus femoris Ilio-tibial band of fascia lata Vastus externus Ligamentum patellae 4. PECTINEUS The pectineus—named from pecten (=pubes) on account of its origin from th?' bone—is a quadrilateral sheet. Origin.—(1) The ilio-pectineal line between the spine of the pubes and ttPECTINEUS—GLUTEUS MAXIMUS 371 lio-pubal eminence ; (2) the surface in front of the inner end of this line; and 3) the deep surface of the pubic portion of the fascia lata close to its attachment 0 the ilio-pectineal line. Insertion.—The back of the femur in a vertical line about two inches long, leginning just behind the lesser trochanter. Structure.—The origin is by fleshy and tendinous fibres intermingled. The ibres then run parallel to one another to a tendinous insertion between the iliacus ,nd the adductor brevis. The direction of the surfaces changes so that that which 3oks forwards above is directed outwards below. V Nerve-supply.—From the lumbar plexus (through the third and fourth lumbar i jierves), by a branch of the anterior crural nerve, which, after passing behind the emoral artery and vein, enters the muscle about the middle of its external border. Vhen there is an accessory obturator nerve, it passes over the brim of the pelvis supply this muscle at the upper part of its anterior surface. Occasionally the atiscle receives a branch upon its deep surface from the anterior division of the bturator nerve. j Action.—To flex and at the same time'adduct the thigh ; as, for example, in rossing the legs, when one thigh is brought forwards and inwards to place it in font of the other thigh. It is also a slight external rotator. Its predominant ction is that of flexion, as is indicated by the fact that it receives the same nerve- upply as the sartorius and ilio-psoas. The tendency w^hich it has to adduct during exion is counteracted by the slight abduction produced by the sartorius. They dll together produce a slight external rotation, as may be observed during the dvance of the leg in walking. Relations.—In front, the pubic portion of the fascia lata, the femoral and jrofunda vessels, and at its insertion the psoas and iliacus muscles; behind, the ductor brevis, obturator externus, hip joint, and obturator nerve. Variations.—Sometimes a slight blending of the lower fibres of the pectineus with the Iductor lonofus has been observed. THE GLUTEAL MUSCLES These are arranged in three layers. First Layer The first layer consists of two muscles—the gluteus maximus and the tensor Ebgin^ femoris. j 1. GLUTEUS MAXIMUS I ji The gluteus maximus (figs. 291, 303)—named from its great size and from the llsgion which it occupies {yXovros = the buttock)—is a very thick and strong ■ lomboidal sheet. PI Origin.—(1) The posterior fifth of the outer lip of the crest of the ilium, and the ater surface of the ilium between the outer Hp of the crest and the superior gluteal ne ; (2) the lumbar aponeurosis between the posterior superior spine of the ilium id the side of the sacrum ; (3) the lateral portion of the posterior surface of the TO last pieces of the sacrum; (4) the side of the coccyx; (5) the back of the ceat sacro-sciatic ligament; (6) in front of its attachment to the ilium a few of Is fibTes arise from the strong process of the fascia lata which invests the gluteus iiedius. B B 2372 THE MUSCLES Insertion.—(1) The upper part of the strong aponeurosis of the fascia lata called the ilio-tibial band ; (2) the gluteal ridge of the femur which leads fron the lower border of the greater trochanter to the linea aspera ; (3) the adjacen part of the tendinous origin of the vastus externus. Structure.—Its origin is almost entirely fleshy, a few tendinous fibres onl^ being intermingled between the coarse bundles which run parallel to one anothe downwards and outwards to the aponeurosis of insertion. The upper half of thi aponeurosis passes over the outer surface of the great trochanter to be attachei to the upper part of the ilio-tibial band. Lower down the insertion consists o, short tendinous fibres, which are not only attached to the rough process of thj bone but to the adjacent tendon of the vastus externus, while the more superficia fibres still pass on to be attached to the fascia lata. The whole muscle forms parallelogram of which the upper and lower parallel sides are formed by the origi] and insertion which run in oblique lines downwards and inwards, while the oute and inner borders of the muscle running downwards and outwards form the othe two sides of the parallelogram. This muscle is especially remarkable for the larg size of the fasciculi in which its fleshy fibres are arranged, and which give th muscle its peculiarly coarse appearance. 1 There are tAvo well-marked bursas in connection with the deep surface of thi^ muscle : the one covering the tuberosity of the ischium, which is partly covered b; the muscle and partly projects from the middle of its lower border in such a wa| that when the thigh is extended it intervenes between the muscle and the prcj minence of bone, and when the thigh is flexed it lies between the tuberosity (' the ischium and the subcutaneous fat. The second is a large, often multiloculg cavity which separates the outer surface of the great trochanter from the ap( neurosis of insertion of the upper part of the muscle. A small bursa is als; occasionally found between the lower part of the muscle and the tendon of ttj vastus externus. Nerve-supply.—^Fromthe sacral plexus (through the fifth lumbar and the firj and second sacral nerves), by means of the inferior gluteal branches of the sma! sciatic nerve which enter the deep surface of the muscle close to its inferior ar internal border. Action.—To extend the hip joint. The upper part of the muscle, passing ovj the great trochanter, is placed at a considerable distance from the axis of movemeij which passes through the centre of the hip joint. A similar object is obtained Ij the insertion of the lower fibres of the muscle at some distance down the ba(j of the femur. The whole muscle therefore is able to act as an extensor of tl hip joint with much less mechanical disadvantage than is usual in the bod The gluteus maximus is not used in the movements of extension which requij but little muscular power, such as those which draw the thigh backwards : walking ; for this purpose the contraction of the hamstring muscles at the back the thigh is alone employed. Where, however, a greater effort is required, as ascending a hill or in running and leaping, the gluteus maximus acts with gre power. i It has some influence as an external rotator. With respect to abduction ail adduction, the action of the muscle is neutral. Acting alone, its upper fibres w assist in the former, and its lower fibres in the latter movement. By means of tl ilio-tibial band it makes tense the outer portion of the fascia lata and is able j exert some force in the extension of the knee, especially when that movement j nearly completed. Taking its fixed point from below, the gluteus maximus is powerful extensor of the pelvis and in some degree of the lower part of the spir e.g. in rising from the stooping position or where the trunk in a sitting posture j drawn forcibly backwards as in the action of rowing. The influence which it hj upon the back by means of its attachment to the lumbar aponeurosis is shownTENSOB VAGINA FEMOBIS—GLUTEUS MEDIUS 373 one J lialf ■ Muss %\ 5 lie mtie or Its! rfacecli ycoTtiii Jiilik :iikr(sl nmli iml: larsai :Dtail idU ofie! infei ,iiicM klociii jusiiiiiii' oi ;he great pain which is felt in rising from the stooping position when there is any nflammation of the fascias in this region, as in lumbago. Relations.—Behind, the thick adipose tissue of the buttock and the fold which •orms its lower limit, and numerous cutaneous nerves ; in front, the gluteus medius, Dyriformis, gemelli and obturator internus, quadratus femoris, adductor magnus, 3iceps, semi-tendinosus and semi-membranosus, the gluteal, sciatic and pudic vessels, he great and small sciatic, the pudic and internal obturator nerves, the two sacro- iciatic ligaments, the tuber ischii, and great trochanter. Variations.—These are rare. Occasionally a bilaminar arrangement has been observed. 2. TENSOR VAGINAE FEMORIS The tensor vaginae femoris (figs. 287, 303)—named from its function of making ight the fascia lata, or sheath of the thigh (=vagina femoris)—is an elongated, our-sided sheet. Origin.—(1) The front of the outer lip of the crest of the ilium ; (2) the ipper part of the notch between the anterior superior and the anterior inferior pines of the ilium; (3) the inner surface of the fascia lata, by which it is closely nvested. Insertion.—The fascia lata about one-fourth of the way down the outer side of he thigh. Structure. — The muscle consists of parallel fleshy fibres which arise by a hort tendinous sheet, pass obliquely downwards, outwards, and backwards, and are Qserted between two layers of the upper part of the strong aponeurosis of the fascia ata on the outside of the thigh called the ilio-tibial hand, which also gives attach- aent to the majority of the fibres of the gluteus maximus. The two muscles meet ly their adjacent borders a little below the upper part of the greater trochanter at n angle of about 60°. As they pass upwards, the two divisions of the fascia lata orm a strong sheath for the muscle. Nerve-supply.—Through the fourth and fifth lumbar nerves, and the first sacral, y the terminal branch of the superior gluteal nerve which enters the muscle bout the middle of its deep surface near its posterior border. Action.—To abduct and rotate inwards the thigh, and, taking its fixed point rom below, to support the pelvis and to rotate the other side of it forwards. Acting dth the gluteus maximus, it will draw upwards the ilio-tibial band, the obliquity of ts fibres enabling it to counteract the tendency of that muscle to draw the band ackwards. The chief consequence of this traction upon the ilio-tibial band will e to assist in the latter part of the extension of the leg, by the drawing upwards f the external tuberosity of the tibia. Relations.—Superficially, the fascia lata and the origin of the sartorius ; |.eeply, the deeper layer of the fascia lata, the gluteus medius, the upper part of tie rectus femoris and the vastus extei^nus, with some of the branches of the xternal circumflex artery. Secoi^d Layee The second layer consists of one muscle— GLUTEUS MEDIUS The gluteus medius (fig. 288)—named from its size and position, which are jgflill [ntermediate between those of the great and small gluteal muscles—is a strong i^^jli{l||riangular sheet. m374 THE MUSCLES Origin.—(1) The anterior four-fifths of the outer lip of the crest of the ihum (2) the outer surface of the ihum, bordered above by the middle portion of the outej lip of the crest of the ilium, and in the posterior fifth by the superior gluteal \me below by the middle gluteal line; (3) the strong process of the fascia lata whic]| invests the outer surface of the muscle and separates it behind from the gluteuj maximus ; (4) the intermuscular septum which intervenes between it and thi gluteus minimus just below the anterior superior spine of the ilium. | Insertion.—The well-marked oblique impression extending from the posterioj superior to the anterior inferior angle on the outer surface of the greater trochantei Structure.—Arising by fleshy and tendinous fibres intermingled, the niuscl converges fanwise upon both surfaces of a strong flat tendon which is visibl rather higher upon the deep than the outer surface of the muscle. The front parte the muscle is stronger, and it gradually decreases in thickness towards its posteric edge. A bursa is contained between the deep portion of the tendon and th triangular space that lies in front of the impression upon the outer surface of th greater trochanter. Nerve-supply.—From the fourth and fifth lumbar nerves, and the first sacu nerve by branches of the superior gluteal nerve which enter the deep surface of tl muscle near the middle of its posterior border. Action.—To abduct the hip joint. It will also by its thicker and strong( anterior fibres rotate the thigh inwards. Its posterior fibres, on the other banc which are not so strong will tend slightly to rotate the thigh outwards. Actiiij from below, it tends to support the pelvis upon the femur and to approximate tl crest of the ilium to the great trochanter. This is by far the most important ar frequent of its actions. In walking, if it were not for the powerful contraction i the gluteus medius and its associated muscles the gluteus minimus and the tens< vaginae femoris, the pelvis would not be held firm upon the upper part of the thi^ when one leg is upon the ground and the other is being advanced in the forwai step. In fast walking the rotatory action of the muscle comes into play, for n only does the gluteus medius of the limb which is resting upon the ground suppc the pelvis by drawing downwards the crest of the ilium, but, by drawing backwar the front portion of that crest, it throws forwards the opposite side of the pelvis ai increases the length of the stride. Relations.—Superficially, the fascia lata, gluteus maximus, and tensor vagii femoris ; deeply, the gluteus minimus, superior gluteal vessels and nerve, and t great trochanter. Variations.—Sometimes a partially distinct bundle of fibres is inserted into the front the upper border of the greater trochanter. A slip may be given from the lower border the pyriformis. Third Layer The third layer consists of one muscle—the gluteus minimus tinuous with the external rotators which form the next group. GLUTEUS MINIMUS The gluteus minimus (fig. 290)—named from its position and smaller is a thick triangular sheet. Origin.—(1) The outer surface of the iUum between the middle and infer gluteal lines ; (2) a fibrous septum which intervenes between its fibres and thost ji the gluteus medius belc\\ the anterior superior spine; (3) the front of the capsf of the hip joint. I -which is ccGLUTEUS MINIMUS-PYBIFOBMIS 815 Insertion.—The well-marked vertical impression which forms the anterior border of the greater trochanter. Structure.—From the fleshy origin the fibres converge fanwise upon the deep surface of the tendon which makes its appearance about half-way down the muscle upon the front part of its outer surface and covers the whole of the outer surface of the muscle from this point down to its insertion. By its anterior border this muscle is closely blended with the anterior border of the gluteus medius and with some of the ligaments of the hip joint. Like the preceding muscle, it is also much thicker and stronger in front. Nerve - supply.—From the same sources as the preceding by the superior gluteal nerve, which distributes filaments to the middle of its outer surface near its posterior border. Action.—The same as the preceding : viz. to abduct and rotate inwards the hip joint; and when it takes its fixed point from below, as is most usually the case, to flex the pelvis laterally and at the same time to rotate the other side forwards. Relations.—Superficially, the gluteus medius, the superior gluteal vessels and nerve ; deeply, the capsule of the hip joint, and posterior head of the rectus femoris. Variations.—The front part of the muscle may be separate from the rest. It occa- isionally sends slips to the adjacent muscles. THE EXTEENAL EOTATOES OF THE THIGH This group consists of six somewhat short muscles, which run transversely from the pelvic bones to the femur, and which follow immediately after the lower fibres of the gluteus minimus—viz. the pyriformis, the obturator internus with the two gemelli, the quadratus femoris, and the obturator externus. 1. PYEIFORMIS The pyriformis—named from its pear shape (2JW'?ts=pear)—is a thick triangular sheet. Origin.—(1) The side of the front of the sacrum between the first, second, third, and fourth foramina ; (2) the deep surface of the great sacro-sciatic ligament ; (3) the posterior border of the innominate bone at the upper part of the great sacro- sciatic notch. Insertion.—A small facet upon the inner aspect of the anterior part of the upper border of the greater trochanter. Structure.—The greater part of the muscle arises by three fleshy slips on the ridges of bone between, and external to, the anterior sacral foramina. From this origin, which receives accessory slips of small size from the great sacro-sciatic ligament and the upper portion of the great sacro-sciatic notch, the fibres converge as they pass transversely outwards and somewhat backwards through the great sacro-sciatic foramen. The tendon is first visible upon the deep aspect of the muscle, and it becomes free near the posterior border of the greater trochanter. Shortly before its insertion it is closely blended with the tendon of the obturator internus muscle. Nerve-supply.—From the sacral plexus by small branches which pass from the second sacral nerve into the anterior surface of the muscle near its origin. Action.—To rotate the thigh outwards. When the thigh is fixed, it will rotateTHE MUSCLES 376 the pelvis so that the face is turned to the opposite side ; if the thigh be flexed, the pyriformis will abduct it. Relations.—In front, the sacral plexus and rectum, the back of the hip Fig. 288.—The External Eotators and the Hamstring Muscles. joint, and some of the branches of the internal iliac artery ; behind, the gluteus maximus ; above, the gluteus medius and minimus, the superior gluteal vessels and nerve ; below, the coccygeus, the lesser sacro-sciatic ligament and gemellusOBTUBATOB INTEBNVS AND GEMELLI an superior, the sciatic and pudic vessels, and most of the branches from the sacral plexus. Variations.—The pyriformis may be absent. It is often divided by a part of the great ciatic nerve into two muscles, and sometimes into three. It may be more or less blended with the gluteus medius or minimus above, and the superior gemellus below. 2, 3, AND 4. OBTUKATOR INTERNUS AND GEMELLI The obturator internus and gemelli form really a single muscle, the greater part of which arises inside the pelvis ; while the gemelli form two accessory slips ivhich join it from the margin of that cavity. The obturator internus—named from the fact that it arises from the membrane R^hich closes up the obturator foramen, and from its position within the pelvis—is a omewhat triangular sheet, or rather, perhaps, it should be described as the sector 3f a circle, for its origin within the pelvis is bounded by a curved line like a part of the circumference of a circle. Origfin.—The whole of the interior of that part of the pelvis which is formed by he innominate bone : viz. (1) The back of the body and descending ramus of the )S pubis, and of the ascending ramus of the ischium ; (2) the whole of the inner surface of the obturator membrane; (3) the broad surface of bone behind the oramen, corresponding to the acetabulum on the exterior; (4) the outer surface j)f the pelvic and obturator fasciae. These extend from the ilio-pectineal line above |iO the great sacro-sciatic foramen behind, and to the spine and tuberosity of the schium below. Insertion.—The inner aspect of the upper border of the greater trochanter at he point where it unites with the upper border of the neck of the femur. Structure.—The muscle arises fleshy from the whole of the interior of the Douch-like cavity formed by the pelvic and obturator fasciae internally and the rvall of the pelvis externally, which opens backwards and downwards at the lesser aero-sciatic foramen. From this extensive origin the fibres converge down- ords and backwards upon a broad tendinous expansion which begins about one nch above the lesser sacro-sciatic foramen upon the outer surface of the muscle. This expansion is corrugated into four or five folds, which are separated from the artilaginous lining of the lesser sacro-sciatic notch by a bursal cavity which lUows of the smooth play of the tendon upon the bone. This cartilage presents iorresponding grooves for the folds of the tendon. After passing through this 'oramen the tendon changes its course, and is directed transversely outwards and brwards to its insertion. The fleshy fibres extend upon the inner, w^hich has low become its posterior surface for about half the distance from the notch to the ;acet upon the greater trochanter. For a short distance before its insertion it s intimately connected with the tendon of the pyriformis. Nerve-supply.—From the first and second sacral nerves of the sacral plexus by b special nerve which, after passing through the lesser sacro-sciatic notch, is distri- cted to the muscle, entering its inner surface near its upper border and close to he lesser sacro-sciatic foramen. The gemellus superior—named from gemellus=-d, twin, because it is the upper )f the two twin muscles which nearly surround the tendon of the obturator internus it its point of emergence from the pelvis—is a somewhat triangular sheet curved ipon itself to embrace the rounded tendon of the obturator internus. Origin.—(1) The outer surface of the spine of the ischium ; (2) the upper half )f the outer edge of the lesser sacro-sciatic notch. Insertion.—The upper border and the anterior surface of the obturator internus endon, about one inch from its insertion.378 THE MUSCLES Structure.—Arising fleshy from the hone at the margin of the lesser sacro- sciatic foramen, the muscular fibres converge slightl}' and form a sheet which is curved upon itself so as to fit round the upper border and anterior aspect of the obturator internus tendon, with which, after a course of about two inches in length, it blends. Nerve-supply.—The first and second nerves of the sacral plexus by a small special branch which enters the muscle at the upper part of its anterior surface near its origin. The gemellus inferior—the lower of these twin muscles—is also triangular in shape, but is somewhat broader and stouter than its fellow. Origin.—(1) The upper part of the inner border of the tuber ischii; and (2 the lower half of the outer edge of the lesser sacro-sciatic notch. Insertion.—The lower border and anterior surface of the tendon of the obturatoi internus, about one inch from its attachment to the greater trochanter. Structure.—Its fibres, arising fleshy from the lower half of the outer border o the lesser sacro-sciatic notch, converge and form a sheet which wraps round th( lower part of the anterior surface of the tendon of the obturator internus. , Ths two gemelli therefore together form an envelope Avhich embraces the whole of th( tendon of the obturator internus after its emergence from the pelvis, with th( exception of a part of its posterior surface. Nerve-supply.—From the sacral plexus (through the fifth lumbar and first sacra nerves), by filaments from the special nerve to this muscle and the quadratiiij femoris, which enter the upper part of its anterior surface near its origin. ' Action.—The obturator internus with its two satellites, the gemelli, powerfuh; rotates the femur outwards. It should be observed that, although the fibres ar^ mostly directed backwards and downwards within the pelvis, the action of th muscle is really determined by the outward and slightly forward direction of th tendon outside the pelvis ; and the notch upon the bone plays the part of a pulle; in changing the direction of the force. Besides its action as an external rotator, the muscle will be able to assist abductio when the thigh is bent through a right angle. Relations.—The obturator internus in the pelvis is in contact externally wit the innominate bone and obturator membrane ; above, with the obturator artery an nerve ; internally, with the pelvic and obturator fasciae, the levator ani, the pelvi viscera, and the pudic vessels and nerve. Outside the pelvis, the tendon of the obturator internus, with the gemelli, is ij contact, in front with the capsule of the hip joint and the tendon of the obturate externus ; behind, with the gluteus maximus, great sacro-sciatic ligament, the sciati vessels and nerves ; above, with the pyriformis and the structures which come oi of the pelvis below it; below, with the quadratus femoris and a branch of the intern; circumflex artery. Variations.— One or other of the gemelli may be absent, but more ft-equently the upp(| one. An accessory slip to the obturator internus has been observed coming from the thii piece of the sacrum. 5. QUADEATUS FEMOEIS The quadratus femoris—named from its square shape and its insertion in' the femur—is a four-sided sheet. Origin.—The upper part of the outer border of the tuber ischii. Insertion.—The vertical ridge which begins just above the middle of the posterii intertrochanteric line of the femur, and is called the ' linea quadrati.' Structure.—Its fibres are fleshy and run parallel to one another almost hoi , zontally outAvards and slightly forwards.QUADBATUS FEMOBIS—ADDUCTOR LONGUS 379 >n ii;aii! oti roili iioleolj Ifct 111 p. p\ ik\ im i mi ofap iuMi trail irarifi i, kj ™ei,i beoltii it,tlie^ :h to* 'tlieiiiiJ llylli8| •OH! ill 0^ Nerve-supply.—From the sacral plexus (through the fifth lumbar and first sacral nerve) by a special branch which, after furnishing filaments to the inferior o-emellus, enters the muscle near the upper part of its anterior surface close to its origin. Action.—It approximates the posterior border of the great trochanter to the tuber ischii, and so assists powerfully in the external rotation of the femur. Relations.—Behind, the gluteus maximus and the two sciatic nerves ; in front, the obturator externus and the termination of the internal circumflex artery. A.bove is the inferior gemellus, and below the adductor magnus. Variations.—This muscle is not unfrequently absent. 6. OBTURATOR EXTERNUS The obturator externus is a strong external rotator of the thigh, but it is also an adductor, and on account of its nerve-supply and position it is better described in that group of muscles. THE ADDUCTOES The adductor muscles form a distinct group on the inner side of the thigh, and are all supplied by the obturator nerve with the exception of a small part of the adductor magnus. They consist of the adductor longus, adductor brevis, adductor magnus, gracilis, and obturator externus. 1. ADDUCTOR LONGUS The adductor longus—so named from its action and its length compared with that of its immediate neighbour—is a thick triangular sheet. Origin.—A rounded impression on the front of the body of the os pubis immediately below the crest and angle. Insertion.—(1) The lower two-thirds of the inner lip of the linea aspera (in the middle third of the thigh); and (2) the adjacent internal intermuscular septum. Structure.—Arising by a strong rounded tendon, which extends about two inches downwards upon the inner border of the muscle, the fleshy fibres diverge in a fan-shaped expansion, and are inserted by short tendinous fibres which blend behind with those of the adductor brevis and adductor magnus. Nerve-supply.—From the third and fourth nerves of the lumbar plexus, by branches from the anterior division of the obturator nerve which enter the muscle on the upper part of its posterior surface rather below its middle. Action.—To adduct and flex the femur, and at the same time to rotate it out- wards. Relations.—In front, the fascia lata, sartorius, vastus internus and femoral vessels; behind, the adductor brevis and magnus, the profunda vessels, and obturator nerve ; its upper border touches the pectineus. Variations.—The adductor longus may arise by two heads, the outer being attached to the crest of the pubes, and separate from the ordinary head which arises below the angle. Occa- sionally the muscle is divided by the passage oi" vessels into an upper and a lower portion.THE MUSCLES 380 \ 2. ADDUCTOR BREVIS The adductor brevis—named from its action and its size as compared with the preceding muscle—is a thick quadrilateral sheet. Fig. 289.^—The Deep Muscles of the Front of the Thigh. Obturator externus Adductor longus Adductor magnus Adductor longus Vastus internus- Vastus internus. Kectus femoris Ligamentum patellae. Origin.—The body and the descending ramus of the os pubis, below, and some- what external to, the origin of the adductor longus.381 ADDUCTOR B BE VIS Insertion.—The inner lip of the linea aspera in its upper half, extending from ust below the lesser trochanter to about the middle of the back of the femur.

Nerve-supply.—From the third and fourth nerves of the lumbar plexus by the uperficial branch of the obturator nerve, which sends filaments to the anterior surface of the muscle near the lower part of its upper border. Sometimes, how- |3ver, it derives its nerve-supply from the deeper division of the obturator nerve, nd in that case the nerves enter the muscle from behind.382 THE MUSCLES Action.—Like the preceding, it is an adductor and rotator outwards of the femur, but it will not assist so powerfully in flexion. Relations.—In front, the pectineus, adductor longus, the profunda vessels, and superficial branch of the obturator nerve ; behind, the obturator externus and adductor magnus, and the deep branch of the obturator nerve. Variations.—It is sometimes divided into an upper and a lower portion. Occasionally it joins above with the obtm-ator externus. 3. ADDUCTOE MAGNUS The adductor magnus—named from its action and its great size—is a thick fan-shaped sheet, forming a right-angled triangle, the right angle of which is; contained between the side corresponding to the insertion of the muscle at the| back of the femur and the side formed by the free upper border of the muscle. Origin.—(1) The lower part of the outer border of the tuber ischii; (2) the outer surface of the ascending ramus of the ischium near its inner border ; (3) the front of the outer surface of the descending ramus of the pubes. Insertion.—(1) The back of the femur, in a line beginning at the lower extremity of the linea quadrati, and extending along the inner border of the gluteal ridge and the middle of the linea aspera down to its bifurcation ; (2) the adductor tubercle on the upper and posterior part of the internal condyle; (3) the lower part of the internal intermuscular septum. Structure.—Its origin and insertion are by short tendinous fibres, Avith the exception of the insertion of the bundle of fibres which passes from the tuber ischii to the adductor tubercle. These arise by a long tendon above, and again become tendinous three or four inches above the knee joint, so as to form a long and con- spicuous tendon on the lower part of the inner border of the muscle. Between this part of the insertion of the muscle and the linea aspera, the fibres are attached to the back of the internal intermuscular septum and to a tendinous arch which allows of the passage of the femoral artery and vein from Hunter's canal into the upper part of the popliteal space. Between the origin and insertion the fibres; diverge ; the anterior fibres of origin passing horizontally outwards to their inser- tion into the upper part of the back of the femur, while the fibres which arise behind pass vertically downwards between the tuber ischii and the internalJ condyle. Moreover, the muscle is twisted upon itself so that the surface which! above looks inwards and rather backwards is directed forwards below. A deep longitudinal groove is thus formed upon the upper part of the back of the muscle,j in which lie the hamstring muscles and the great sciatic nerve. The upper partj of the muscle, which arises in front, and is inserted into the inner border of the gluteal ridge, forms a triangular sheet, usually separate from the rest, and some- times described as a distinct muscle, the adductor minimus. In addition to the opening for the femoral vessels, the muscle is pierced close to the bone by the perforating arteries and the terminal branch of the profunda femoris. Upon its anterior surface it receives a membranous expansion from the vastus internus, which passes inwards beneath the sartorius to the adductoi longus and magnus, forming the anterior wall of a sort of tunnel which con- tains the femoral vessels in the middle third of the thigh, and is called Hunter's canal. Nerve-supply.—Chiefly from the third and fourth nerves of the lumbar plexu& by the deep division of the obturator nerve which supplies the muscle upon the outer part of its anterior surface. The lower fibres of the muscle, hov/ever, are supplied upon their posterior surface by the great sciatic nerve, a branch of the sacral plexus.ADDUCTOR MAGNUS—OBTUBATOB EXTEBNUS 383 Action.—This muscle is the most powerful of the adductors. The upper three )urths of its fibres will also rotate outwards the femur, while that part of the 'lUiscle which arises from the tuber ischii and is inserted into the inner condyle ill tend slightly to rotate the thigh inwards, and will at the same time extend as : ell as adduct the thigh. I Duchenne suggests that this is the part of the muscle which equestrians should I specially develop. Otherwise the adduction of the thighs in gripping the saddle apt to throw out the toes, which is ungainly, and, if the rider have spurs on, |iay lead to unpleasant consequences. : Relations.—In front lie the adductor brevis and longus, and lower down the istus internus. Behind are the hamstring muscles, the gluteus maximus, and the ireat sciatic nerve. At its upper border are the quadratus femoris and obturator kternus. Along its inner border lie the gracilis and part of the sartorius. Variations.—The posterior part of the muscle may form a distinct slip. Accessory indies from the semi-membranosns or biceps may join the lower tendon. The upper rder of the muscle may be blended with the quadratus femoris. 4. GRACILIS The gracilis—named from its form ((/7Ttci/is=slender)—is long and ribbon- aped. Origin.^—The inner edge of the anterior surface of the body and descending us of the OS pubis from about the middle of the symphysis to the junction of e rami of the pubes and ischium. Insertion.—The inner surface of the tibia beloAv its inner tuberosity, between e insertions of the sartorius and the semi-tendinosus. Structure.—Arising by a broad and thin aponeurosis, the muscular fibres pass wn the inner surface of the thigh almost parallel to one another, but with a ■ght convergence, so that the muscle in descending increases in thickness as it minishes in breadth. About two inches above the inner condyle it becomes a unded flattened tendon. This runs behind the inner condyle, and, after forming e of the two hamstring tendons which can be easily felt at the inner border of e popliteal space, it passes forwards to be inserted in a slightly expanded form :low the inner tuberosity. A few fibres pass from its lower border to the deep scia of the leg. Nerve-supply.—From the third and fourth nerves of the lumbar plexus by a ranch from the superficial division of the obturator nerve which enters the deep (irface of the muscle above its middle. >: Action.—To adduct the thigh and flex the knee. When the knee is flexed, it ill help in rotating the leg inwards. Relations.—It lies superficially in its whole course under cover of the fascia ta. Upon its deep surface lie the adductor brevis and magnus, and lower down LB semi-membranosus muscle. It has in front of it the sartorius muscle which i^erlaps it slightly at the lower part of the thigh, and behind it is the tendon of 'le semi-tendinosus. The internal lateral ligament of the knee and a large bursa lie meath its tendon. 5. OBTURATOR EXTERNUS The obturator externus (figs. 286, 289, 290)—named from its attachment to le obturator membrane upon its outer surface—is a triangular sheet. Origin.—(1) The inner half of the anterior surface of the obturator membrane ;THE MUSCLES 384 (2) the descending ramus of the os pubis immediately internal to the foramen (3) the ascending ramus of the ischium internal to the foramen. Insertion.—The digital fossa upon the inner surface of the great trochanter. Structure.—It is a fan-shaped triangular muscle which arises fleshy from th adjacent surfaces of bone and membrane, in a curve which is convex forwards ant inwards. From this wide origin the fibres converge outwards, and end below th acetabulum in a rounded tendon which passes behind and in close contact with th capsule of the joint to its insertion in the digital fossa. Not unfrequently a smal portion of the muscle is separated at its upper border from the rest by one or botJ of the divisions of the obturator nerve. Nerve-supply.—From the third and fourth nerves of the lumbar plexus by th deep division of the obturator nerve which distributes filaments to the deep surfac of the muscle as it is passing through it. Action.—To adduct and rotate outwards the thigh. Relations.—Behind, the obturator vessels, and at its insertion the quadratu femoris ; in front, the psoas muscle, the pectineus, and adductor brevis ; above, th obturator nerve, one or both branches of which perforate it, and more externall the capsule of the hip joint. THE HAMSTEING MUSCLES The hamstring muscles form a group at the back of the thigh, separate by intermuscular septa from the vastus externus on the outer, and the adductc magnus on the inner side. They consist of the biceps, semi-tendinosus and sem membranosus, and are supplied by the great sciatic nerve. Like the glutei] maximus their action is to extend the hip. 1. BICEPS FEMOEIS The flexor biceps femoris (figs. 288, 290)—named from its two heads—co]| sists of two parts : the longer head being somewhat fusiform, and the shorter triangular sheet. Origin.—The long head from (1) the internal and posterior facet at the back i the tuber ischii by a tendon common to it and the semi-tendinosus; (2) the lowi part of the great sacro-sciatic ligament. The short head from (1) the outer 1: of the linea aspera from a point just above the middle of the bone down to tl bifurcation ; (2) the upper two-thirds of the outer division of the linea aspert (3) the external intermuscular septum. Insertion.—(1) A fossa below and in front of the styloid proces.s of the hei of the fibula; (2) the deep fascia covering the peronei muscles; (3) the out tuberosity of the tibia. Structure.—The origin of the long head is by a short tendon which is co: tinned down to the middle of the thigh by a septum which divides this muse from the semi-tendinosus. From this tendon and the outer surface of t] septum the muscular fibres arise in penniform fashion and form a fusiform bellj which receives at the junction of the middle and lower thirds of the thigh ti] thick sheet of muscular fibres derived from the short outer head. The tend(j commences upon the posterior surface of the muscle near its outer border aboa the middle of the thigh. At the back of the external condyle the fleshy fibr cease. The rounded tendon here widens into a thick aponeurosis, which embrac the anterior portion of the external lateral ligament at the point of its inserti'l into the outer and anterior facet of the head of the fibula. Between this tendjBICEPS FEMORISSEMI-TENDINOSUS 385 nd the external lateral ligament is a bursa. From the borders of the tendon at lis point a thinner aponeurosis is given off to the outer tuberosity of the tibia in I'ont and the deep fascia of the leg behind. Nerve-supply.—From the first, second and third nerves of the sacral plexus by jie great sciatic nerve which sends branches to the anterior and inner surfaces of 16 muscle about the middle of the thigh. The short head of the biceps receives Is supply from the external popliteal nerve. Action.—To extend the hip and flex the knee. Its shorter head flexes the iiiee only. When the knee is flexed, both heads will unite in rotating the leg itwards. When the- knee is extended, the long head will have a slight influence ii rotating the hip outwards. Acting from below, the long head will assist in idsing the body from the stooping position. Relations.—Behind, the plantaris, the outer head of the gastrocnemius, gluteus. laximus, fascia lata, and the small sciatic nerve. In front, the tendon of the imi-membranosus, the adductor niagnus, and the great sciatic nerve. Upon its. iner border lie the semi-tendinosus, semi-membranosus, and the external popliteal 3rve. Beneath the lower tendon is a bursa which separates it from the external teral ligament of the knee joint. Variations.—The short head of the biceps may be absent. Accessory heads may be 'irived from the tuber ischii, the upper part of the linea aspera, the fascia lata, or the inner Lrface of the tendon of insertion of the glutens maximus. It may send a slip to the jistrocnemius. 2. SEMI TENDINOSUS The semi-tendinosus (fig. 288)—named from the long tendon which forms the wer half of the muscle—is fusiform and somewhat flattened. Origin.—By a tendon which is common to it and the preceding muscle, from le internal and posterior of the facets at the back of the tuber ischii. Insertion.—(1) The upper part of the inner surface of the tibia below and ihind the insertion of the gracilis; (2) the deep fascia of the inner side of the g- Structure.—The rounded and somewhat flattened tendon of about two inches in ngth is succeeded by a fusiform mass of muscular fibres, which end just below le middle of the thigh in a flattened cylindrical tendon. This runs directly down- Ebrds along the inner side of the pox^liteal space, where it can easily be felt beneath le skin, behind and external to the tendon of the gracilis, in company with which passes downwards and forwards behind the internal condyle to its insertion slow the inner tuberosity. From the lower border of the flattened tendon an )oneurosis passes downwards to the deep fascia of the leg. The fleshy part of [6 muscle is crossed about its middle by a thin tendinous intersection running )wnwards and outwards. Nerve-supply.—From the first, second, and third nerves of the sacral plexus by eans of branches from the great sciatic nerve which enter the outer part of the ep surface of the muscle two or three inches below the tuber ischii. Action.—To extend the hip and flex the knee, and when the knee is flexed to tate the leg inwards. Acting from below, it lifts up the body from the stooping* sition. Relations.—Behind, the gluteus maximus and fascia lata; on its outer side the ceps ; in front, the semi-membranosus, adductor magnus, and near the knee the acilis, sartorius, and the inner head of the gastrocnemius. The large bursa, neath the sartorius tendon also wraps round the upper part of the tendon of e semitendinosus, and separates it from the internal lateral ligament of the lee joint. C CTHE MUSCLES 886 8. SEMI-MEMBRANOSUS The semi-membranosus (fig. 288)—named from the broad membrane-Hl aponeurosis which forms the upper third of the muscle—is strong, flattened, an fusiform. Origin.—The anterior and outer of the facets upon the back of the tub( ischii. Insertion.—(1) The lower part of the posterior extremity of the groove upc the back and inner side of the inner tuberosity of the tibia ; (2) by a band ( fibres which pass upwards and outwards to the upper and back part of the extern; condyle of the femur, and blend with the posterior ligament of the knee joint; (! by a broad expansion which, passing downwards and outwards from its insertic^ into the inner tuberosity to the oblique line at the back of the tibia, forms tl aponeurosis which invests the posterior surface of the popliteus ; (4) a few fibr^ pass downwards and forwards from the lower border of its tibial insertion to blei with the internal lateral ligament. Structure.—The upper part of the muscle consists of a strong flat tendc, about three-quarters of an inch broad, which extends along the outer border of tli muscle to the middle of the thigh. The tendon of insertion is not quite so broi but much thicker, and reaches upon the inner border of the muscle also as high ; the middle of the thigh. Between these two tendons the muscular fibres whi( are comparatively short pass downwards and inwards, beginning upon the upp tendon about four inches below the tuber ischii, and ending upon the lower tendc; close to the upper part of the inner condyle. The muscle has therefore a ve| distinctly penpiform arrangement, but it is peculiar in this respect that the flesl' fibres are at each extremity attached to a tendon, and are not, as is usually tj case, at one extremity attached to the bone. It is also unusual for a muscle have so long a tendon at its proximal end. One effect of this arrangement is allow of the free action of the long head of the biceps which crosses over tl part of the semi-membranosus. Otherwise the swelling of the fibres of the bice, during contraction would have pressed upon and interfered with the action of t semi-membranosus, which usually contracts at the same time. Nerve-supply.—From the first, second, and third nerves of the sacral plexus the great sciatic nerve which sends branches to the deep surface of the mus( > about the middle of the thigh. Action.—To strongly extend the hip and to flex the knee. When the knee ! flexed it will also assist in the internal rotation of the leg, but with less mechanitl advantage than the semi-tendinosus and gracilis, as its line of action is so near f) the axis of movement. Like most penniform muscles, the semi-membranosus is very powerful, as ? shown by the thickness of its tendons. This strength is necessitated by the fijb that its line of action is so much nearer to the axis of movement both in flexi i and rotation inwards of the knee. Like the other muscles which arise from liJ tuber ischii, it will co-operate powerfully in raising the body from the stoopi j position, this prominence of bone forming the short arm of the lever by which 13 trunk is raised. This group of muscles affords a good example of the peculjc action obtained by long muscles passing over two joints. If all three muses were to remain passive, like so many ligaments, it is obvious that on flexion of b hip joint by means of the ilio-psoas and other muscles, the hamstrings wo i ensure the simultaneous flexion of the knee ; or, again, on extension of the knee m the action of the powerful muscles of the front of the thigh, the hamstrings wop produce a corresponding extension of the hip joint. Seeing, however, that th e hamstrings are not passive, but that they contract powerfully at the same time a I ilSABTOBIUS—QUADBICEPS EXTENSOB FEMOBIS 387 any of these movements, it follows that in flexion of the hip in such movements |i those of running, the knee is at the same time flexed with increased rapidity ; !id again, when the knees are extended by the powerful contraction of the ladriceps muscle, the simultaneous action of the hamstring muscles will produce still more rapid elevation of the trunk. Relations of the semi-membranosus.—Behind, the gluteus maximus, biceps, and mi-tendinosus; in front, the adductor magnus, posterior ligament of knee, and e popliteus. Along its outer border lies the great sciatic nerve, and just before ^ insertion the inner head of the gastrocnemius hooks round this border, being parated from it by a bursa which communicates with the knee joint. There is so usually a small bursa between its tendon and the back of the inner tuberosity the tibia. Variations.—The semi-membranosus has occasionally been deficient, or only represented a thin musculo-tendinons band. It has also been found double. ANTEEIOE MUSCLES OF THE THIGH This group consists of the sartorius and the quadriceps extensor femoris. 1. SAETORIUS This muscle has already been described. ,2. QUADRICEPS EXTENSOR FEMORIS The quadriceps extensor femoris (figs. 287, 289), as its name implies, consists four heads. Of these, one, the rectus, arises from the innominate bone; and le three others, the vastus externus, vastus internus, and crureus, from the femur ; hile the common tendon is inserted into the upper border and sides of the patella. (a) Rectus Femoeis The rectus femoris—named from its long straight course—is strong, fusiform, bd flattened from before backwards; it arises by an anterior and posterior head. Origin.—Anterior head, from the front of the anterior inferior spine of the -um; posterior head, from the upper surface of the rim of the acetabulum just i:ternal to the attachment of the capsular ligament, t Insertion.—The front of the upper border of the patella. } Structure.—This muscle consists of two strong tendinous expansions joined 1^ fleshy fibres. The upper expansion is formed above by the union of the two (ndinous heads in a small arch, which is intimately connected with the capsule of le hip joint. From this arch the tendinous expansion descends upon the front of le muscle as far as the middle of the thigh, getting thinner and narrower as it ascends. The tendon of insertion begins upon the back of the muscle also about le middle of the thigh, and soon expands into a broad aponeurosis which covers |ie back of the muscle at its lower end ; about three inches above the patella, it bcomes free of muscular fibres, and forms a strong tendinous band which is Lserted into the upper border of the patella. The fleshy fibres pass from the back id sides of the upper expansion to the front and sides of the tendon of insertion. c c 2388 THE MUSCLES Seen from the front, these fleshy fibres appear to diverge on both sides from tl upper expansion, and, after passing round the border of tlie muscle, they convert upon the tendon of insertion so as to give the muscle a bipenniform appearance. Nerve-supply.—From the lumbar plexus (through the second, third, and four! lumbar nerves), by the anterior crural nerve which sends filaments to the posteri( aspect of the muscle in the upper half of its course. Action.—To assist in the powerful extension of the knee by the quadriceps, will also help in flexion of the hip ; and it will be a powerful agent in preventii dislocation of the head of the femur. When the hip-joint is flexed, the muscle w act chiefly from its posterior head ; but when the hip is extended, the anterior he; of the muscle will act with more power. Relations.—In front lie the sartorius, tensor vaginae femoris, and the fascia lat; behind, it lies on the hip joint and the crureus muscle ; upon its inner border abo is the iliacus ; and outside it lie the gluteus medius and minimus. (b) Vastus Exteenus The vastus externus—named from its great size and its position upon the oii1 • surface of the thigh—is a thick rhomboidal sheet. Orig^in.—(1) The upper half of the anterior intertrochanteric line and the frc of the upper part of the femur along the anterior border of the great trochante; (2) a horizontal line which forms the lower border of the great trochanter; (3) tjs outer lip of the gluteal ridge ; (4) the upper half of the outer lip of the linea aspel and the adjacent portion of the shaft of the femur for about one-sixth of aninc'i; (5) the external intermuscular septum in the neighbourhood of its attachment > the linea aspera. j Insertion.—(1) The outer half of the upper border of the patella, behind tl preceding tendon, with which it also blends ; (2) the upper third of the outer borcj: of the patella ; (3) by an aponeurosis which is inserted partly into the front of t.) external tuberosity of the tibia, partly into the deep fascia of the leg. Structure.—Arising partly directly from the bone, and partly by a strong a' neurosis which covers the outer surface of the muscle in its upper two-thir the fleshy fibres run parallel to one another downwards, forwards, and inwards, jt the same time curving slightly as they pass over the rounded mass formed by crureus muscle. The aponeurosis of insertion lies upon the inner surface of muscle and receives fleshy fibres to within one inch of its insertion into the pate i and its blending with the other tendons of the quadriceps muscle. Upon is anterior surface it unites with the tendon of the rectus muscle, and upon is posterior surface is received a part of the insertion of the crureus. Nerve-supply.—From the anterior crural (through the second, third, f|d fourth lumbar nerves), by several branches which enter the internal surface of p muscle in the upper third of the thigh. j Action and relations.—These will be considered with those of the two follow|g muscles. 1 (c, cl) Vastus Inteenus and Ceueeus The vastus internus and crureus are so closely blended that it is bette] describe their origins together before mentioning the way in which they may separated. They have received their names, the former from its size and positi(]; the latter from its intimate connexion with the whole of the front of the thigh bcj?, the term ' crus ' being often used synonymously with the femur. The blen jd muscle is a somewhat fusiform sheet which is so curved laterally as to fori cylinder embracing the whole of the front and sides of the shaft of the femur. Origin.—(1) The outer lip of the lower half of the linea aspera and its extei'At 6] •1055(1 1^1 .1 iroi hof i kkli 1011t«l if tall y foniiflt . ;illfj(t '3 lit) dp, Ik* mil!: FiSTra INTEBNUS—CBUBEUS 389 furcation, together with the adjacent external intermuscular septum; (2) the wer part of the anterior intertrochanteric line and the spiral line of the femur; the inner lip of the whole length of the linea aspera and its internal bifur- btion, together with the adjacent part of the internal intermuscular septum, and 16 front of the tendon of the adductor magnus ; (4) the greater part of the front id sides of the femur within the limits formed by the three preceding attachments id the origin of the vastus externus. Insertion.—(1) The posterior aspect of the upper border of the patella; (2) the pper half of the inner border of the patella; (3) by a strong aponeurosis into 16 front of the inner tuberosity of the tibia and into the adjacent deep fascia of L6 leg. Structure.—The fibres of this large muscle arise fleshy from the surface of the mur and converge, from the outer side downwards, forwards, and inwards; from 16 front directly downwards ; from the inner side downwards, forwards, and out- ards, upon the back and sides of a strong aponeurosis which covers the front of the uscle from about the middle of the thigh downwards. The fibres which arise om the tendon of the adductor magnus and the adjacent intermuscular septum rm the lowest part of the thick muscular belly of the vastus internus, and are rected almost transversely outwards to get to their insertion upon the inner border ■ the patella. The substance of the muscle is arranged in layers which wrap round .6 front and sides of the femur ; and between the attachment of these layers to & bone, longitudinal strips of bone may be found upon dissection without any liticular attachment. The deepest of these layers in the lower fourth of the igh forms a separate sheet of muscular fibre, sometimes called the subcrureus, hich is inserted into the upper reflexion of the synovial membrane of the 166 joint. Beneath this muscle is the bursa underneath the quadriceps, which , the adult communicates with the upper part of the knee joint. A somewhat arbitrary division may be made between the vastus internus and ureus by dissecting at the lower third of the thigh in a line with the inner border the patella. With a few touches of the scalpel a longitudinal separation may ) made clear, which extends upwards to the lower part of the anterior inter- ochanteric line. The part of the muscle external to this line is the crureus, and IB part internal the vastus internus. The lig^amentum patellae may be looked upon as the common tendon of the ladriceps. It is a band of fibrous tissue about an inch broad by one-quarter of 1 inch thick, and two or three inches in length, which is attached above to the )ex and to the lower part of the posterior surface of the patella ; and, after passing )wnwards and very slightly outwards, it is inserted into the anterior surface of le tubercle of the tibia. Attached to its sides are strong aponeuroses by which le lower fibres of the vastus externus and vastus internus and the ilio-tibial band '6 inserted into the tuberosities of the tibia, and which blend on their deep surface ith the lower part of the capsule of the knee joint. Nerve-supply.—Numerous branches from the anterior crural are distributed to e upper half of the front of the crureus muscle and to the inner surface of the istus internus at the junction of the middle and lower thirds of the thigh, the srve to the vastus internus being a large and conspicuous branch which lies close I the outer side of the femoral artery in the upper part of Hunter's canal. Action.—The vastus externus, crureus and vastus internus, together with the ctus femoris, extend powerfully the knee. Their intermediate insertion into the samoid bone formed by the patella serves to lift from the line of the tibia the ^amentum patellae, which may be looked upon as the lower part of their common ndon. The enormous power of the whole of this combination of muscles is cessitated partly by the fact that the whole of the weight of the body has to be ised by it, and partly by the great mechanical disadvantage which results from390 THE MUSCLES the short arm of the lever upon which the tendon acts, and the obliquity of i insertion. On account of the direction of the femur, which is downwards and inwards, t tendency of the quadriceps is to draw the patella outwards at the same time upwards. This is in some degree counteracted by the position and direction of 11 vastus intemus. The great mass of the fibres of this part of the quadriceps arii in the lower part of the thigh, and are directed so transversely outwards towai! the inner border of the patella, that when they contract they tend to draw 11 patella inwards as well as upwards, and so the combined result and action of t> various divisions of the quadriceps is to draw the patella more directly upwarc If it were not for this arrangement, the contraction of the quadriceps would ha a strong tendency to produce outward dislocation of the knee-cap. Relations of vastus externus, crureus, and vastus internus.—In front He t) fascia lata, tensor vaginse femoris, rectus femoris, and sartorius. To the inner si ) lie the femoral vessels and anterior crural nerve. On the outer side aretheglutej minimus and maximus. Behind are the biceps on the outer side of the femur, a the adductor longus and magnus on the inner side. Variations.—These are few in number. An accessory head to the rectus from the anter superior spine of the ilium has been described, and occasionally the outer head is abseii; THE DEEP FASCIA OF THE LEG AND ANNULAE LIGAMENTS The deep fascia of the leg is continuous above with the fascia lata of the thi and receives important additions from the tendons of the biceps, sartorius, graci and semi-tendinosus. It is also attached to the lower part of the outer 8 inner tuberosities of the tibia and to the head of the fibula. At the back of li knee it is strengthened by transverse fibres which serve to bind together ' muscles which form the boundaries of the popliteal space ; the external saphem g vein also perforates it about the centre of the space. It is very thick and stn a at the upper and outer part of the front of the leg; but behind, where it cov s the muscles of the calf, the fascia becomes much thinner. The internal surf € of the tibia is not covered by this fascia, which blends with the periostela covering its anterior and inner borders throughout their whole length. It is sic attached to the borders of the fibula by two strong intermuscular septa which fc the anterior and posterior walls of a compartment containing the long and sb peronei. In the lower third of the leg it is attached to the borders of the s cutaneous surface of the fibula. In the neighbourhood of the ankle the deep faf is thickened by the addition of numerous transverse fibres, and forms the anni ligaments. The anterior annular ligament (fig. 298) consists of two parts, an upper \ a lower. The iqoper part is a strong band of transverse fibres just above the ar joint, which extends from the anterior border of the tibia to the anterior borde the subcutaneous surface of the fibula. Behind it there is a separate sync sheath for the tendon of the tibialis anticus. The lower part of the ante, annular ligament arises from the upper surface and outer border of the g]j» process of the calcaneum in two bands, a superficial and a deep, which, pas^ i transversely inwards, unite after a course of about an inch, and thus form a If in which are contained the tendons of the extensor longus digitorum and 1 peroneus tertius, together with part of the origin of the extensor brevis digitor iji From the inner extremity of this loop two bands of fibres of varying distinctip proceed: one passes upwards and inwards to join with the front border of |i internal malleolus; the other, which is usually the weaker, more directly inwf over the scaphoid bone to join wdth the inner border of the plantar fascia. Bern391 GASTROCNEMIUS ,his inner portion of the lower part of the anterior annular ligament the tendons )f the extensor proprius hallucis and tibialis anticus are contained in separate synovial sheaths. The external annular ligament passes from the posterior border of the external Irnalleolus to the outer border of the tuberosity of the calcaneum and to the posterior 3art of the junction of the lower and outer surfaces of the calcaneum. It is con- iinuous above with the deep fascia covering the calf muscles and the peronei; md also with the sheet of fascia which separates the two superficial from the two ieeper layers of muscles at the back of the leg. Its deep surface is attached to the iperoneal tubercle on the outer side of the calcaneum. The internal annular ligament extends from the posterior border of the internal Irnalleolus to the inner border of the tuberosity of the calcaneum. It is also continuous above with the deep fascia of the leg and with the sheet of fascia which |intervenes between the soleus and the deeper sheets of muscle at the back of the leg. I MUSCLES OF THE BACK OF THE LEG The muscles in this region are arranged in two layers above, in four below, iThe first layer consists of the gastrocnemius and plantaris. First Layer 1. GASTROCNEMIUS The gastrocnemius—named from 7ao-T>jp=the belly, and KV77/x77=the calf, because- t forms the enlargement of that part of the leg—is double-headed, each head con- sisting of a fusiform muscle, the lower part of which blends with its fellow so as to jform a common tendon of insertion. It forms the femoral origin of the great triceps feurae muscle. I Origin.—Outer head : a well-marked impression upon the upper and posterior i3art of the outer surface of the external condyle and the adjacent part of the posterior surface of the femur just above the external condyle. ( Inner head: an oval impression placed transversely across the posterior ;mrface of the femur above the internal condyle, and reaching inwards to the back bf the adductor tubercle. Insertion.—By the tendo Achillis (so named from the legend that the heel, into jivhich this tendon is inserted, was the only vulnerable part of the hero Achilles) jnto the lower part of the posterior surface of the calcaneum. ! Structure.—The two heads arise by short strong tendons ; that of the inner is the 5tronger and thicker. These tendons converge downwards towards one another, and ire succeeded by large fleshy expansions which unite at the upper part of the niidle third of the leg. Near this point the tendon of insertion begins as an inter- tiiuscular septum between the two bellies of the muscle. This becomes thicker and l^tronger, and expands into a broad aponeurosis which covers the anterior surface of phe united muscle. Just below the middle of the leg the fleshy fibres terminate ipon the back of this aponeurosis in two curves the convexity of which is downwards, ihat of the inner portion of the muscle descending about half an inch lower than the )uter. The strong aponeurosis becomes narrower and at the same time thicker,892 THE MUSCLES Fig. 291.—Superficial Muscles of the Back of the Thigh and Leg.GA STBOCNEMIUS—PLANTARIS 393 md after receiving the fibres of the solens muscle is known by the name of the endo Achilhs. Nerve-supply.—From the internal popliteal branch of the great sciatic nerve, \rhich sends sural branches to the adjacent portions of the anterior surfaces of the wo heads, in the upper third of the leg. Action.—Its action will be described with that of the soleus, which forms apart f the same muscle. Relations.—Behind, the deep fascia, the external saphenous vein and nerve, nd the communicans fibularis nerve. Between the two heads above is the ilantaris muscle. In front lie the knee joint, the tendon of the semi-membranosus, he popliteus, the plantaris tendon, the soleus, the popliteal vessels, and internal opliteal nerve. On the outer side, above, are the biceps tendon, and external lophteal nerve ; on the inner side, above, are the tendons of the semi-tendinosus, racilis, sartorius, and adductor magnus. A bursa lies beneath its inner head, eparates it from the tendon of the semi-membranosus, and communicates with the nee joint., Variations.—The most common variation is the addition of a third head ft-om the osterior surface of the lower end of the femur. This may cross, or even run between, the opliteal vessels. 2. PLANTARIS The plantaris—named from its occasional attachment to the fascia covering he sole of the foot {=2^lanta)—is a fusiform, somewhat flattened muscle with a ery long ribbon-shaped tendon. Origin.—(1) The low^er two inches of the outer bifurcation of the linea aspera 3gether with the posterior surface of the femur immediately below that ridge ; nd (2) the adjacent part of the posterior ligament of the knee joint. lasertion.—The inner side of the lower portion of the posterior surface of the dcaneum ; sometimes, however, it blends with the inner border of the tendo Achillis, nd sometimes it is continued into the inner division of the plantar fascia. Structure.—Arising fleshy, the fibres of this small muscle have a somewhat enniform arrangement and converge upon the thin tendon, which appears first on 16 inner side of the muscle, and soon becoming free runs downwards and slightly iwards across the calf between the gastrocnemius and the soleus. In the lower tiird of the leg it lies along the inner border of the tendo Achillis, with which it is ometimes blended. Nerve-siipply.—From the internal popliteal branch of the great sciatic nerve by small filament which enters the deep aspect of the muscle near the upper part of i inner border. Action.—This vestigial muscle is a feeble extensor of the ankle and flexor of le knee joint. By its attachment to the posterior ligament of the knee joint it 411 tend to draw backwards that ligament during flexion of the knee, and so revent its being caught between the articular surfaces. Relations.—Behind lie the fascia of the popliteal space, the biceps, the gastro- tiemius, and the external popliteal nerve; in front are the popliteal vessels and iternal popliteal nerve, the pojoliteus muscle and the soleus. Variations.—In addition to the above-mentioned variations m the point of insertion, this luscle may sometimes be double at its origin, and it is not infrequently deficient.THE MUSCLES 394 i Second Layer The second layer is formed above by the pophteus, which is covered behind by the aponeurosis derived from the semi-membranosus ; and below by the soleus, which is the lower head of the great triceps sur^e muscle. 1. POPLITEUS The popliteus (fig. 292)—named from its position on the floor of the ham (= poples)—is a triangular sheet. Origin.—The bottom of the anterior portion of a horizontal groove on the lower part of the outer surface of the external condyle of the femur ; also by a small shp from the posterior ligament of the knee joint. Insertion.—(1) The back of the tibia from below the attachment of the pos- terior ligament of the knee joint to the oblique line ; (2) the fascia derived from the tendon of the semi-membranosus, which covers the posterior surface of the muscle. Structure.—Arising by a somewhat flattened cylindrical tendon which passes at first bacliwards and slightly downwards within the knee joint, grooving th( posterior border of the external semilunar cartilage ; it then escapes from the capsuk of the knee joint, receiving a small slip from the posterior ligament, and immediateh expands into a fan-shaped muscle which forms a thick sheet, covering the uppeij fourth of the back of the tibia, and is inserted by fleshy fibres into the pouch formec by the bone in front and the aponeurosis derived from the semi-membranosus behind The tendon of origin is surrounded by synovial membrane, which is reflected upoi it about half an inch beyond the opening, through which it emerges from ih posterior ligament of the knee joint. Nerve-supply.—From the sacral plexus by the internal popliteal division of thi great sciatic nerve, which sends a special branch round the lower border of th muscle to distribute itself to the lower part of its deep or anterior surface. Action.—To flex the knee, which it will do but feebly on account of the obliquitj of its direction and its proximity to the axis of the joint. When the knee is flexes it will act as an internal rotator of the leg. In this position the tendon of origij lies wholly in the groove for its reception upon the outer surface of the externa condyle. It is possible that the attachment of the tendon of origin to the posterio ligament of the knee may enable the muscle when it contracts to draw backward the ligament, and so prevent the synovial membrane upon its anterior aspec from being nipped between the articular surfaces. Relations.—Behind, the aponeurosis of the semi-membranosus, the gastrc cnemius, plantaris, and the popliteal vessels, nerves, and glands. In front, th knee joint. Superficial to the tendon of origin is the external lateral ligament ( the knee. Variations.—A second head of origin has been seen from a sesamoid bone in the out(; tendon of the gastrocnemius. 2. SOLEUS The soleus—named from solea, the Latin for a sole-fish, because of the resen blance of the muscle to this fiat fish—is a thick, fusiform sheet. Origin.—(1) The oblique line of the tibia and the inner border of its posteritj surface, from the lower end of the oblique line to a little below the middle of tli395 SOLE us leg; (2) the back of the head and the upper third of the outer border of the posterior or flexor surface of the fibula and the adjacent external intermuscular septum ; (3) a tendinous arch which stretches across the interval between the upper part of the back of the tibia and fibula. Insertion.—By a strong aponeurosis which blends with the anterior surface of the tendon of the gastrocnemius, and forms the tendo Achillis. Structure.—The muscle arises partly by fleshy fibres and partly by a strong aponeurosis, which hes in front of the fleshy fibres, and is especially noticeable in the neighbourhood of its tibial attachment. From the tibia and fibula the fibres pass in a bipenniform arrangement downwards and towards the middle line, and after a very short course, not exceeding two inches in length, they blend with the tendon of insertion which begins near the upper part of the origin of the muscles, and in cross-sections of the muscle resembles in shape the letter T ; one part of it forming a broad aponeurosis upon the posterior surface of the muscle, the other part a strong tendinous septum which passes forwards from the middle of the broad aponeurosis above mentioned, so as to separate the fleshy fibres into two portions. About the junction of the middle and lower thirds of the leg, the tendon of insertion joins by its posterior aspect with that of the gastrocnemius muscle, but upon its anterior aspect and sides it receives fleshy fibres nearly as far down as the back of the ankle joint. The tendo Achillis is a strong rounded band of tendon about five-eighths of an inch from side to side, and three- eighths of an inch from before backwards ; it is narrowest at the level of the ankle joint, and expands slightly before it is inserted into the lower part of the posterior surface of the calcaneum. A bursa intervenes between the tendon and the smooth upper part of the posterior surface of this bone. Nerve-supply.—From the internal popliteal division of the great sciatic nerve by sural branches which enter the upper half of the muscle upon the posterior surface; and lower down by a branch from the posterior tibial nerve, which enters the anterior surface of the muscle. Action.—The chief action of the combined gastrocnemius and soleus is to extend the ankle joint. It is an extremely powerful muscle, as it acts with considerable mechanical disadvantage. The lever by means of which it acts may be best described as one of the first order; the lever being that part of the foot which lies between the heel and the heads of the metatarsal bones, the ankle being the fulcrum; a pressure equal to the weight of the body being exerted by the ground at the anterior extremity of the lever; and the arm, at the end of which the muscle acts, being the comparatively short distance between the back of the heel and the centre of the ankle joint. When the ankle joint has been completely extended, this muscle will tend to adduct slightly the foot, and to invert the sole, this movement being carried out in the joint between the astragalus and calcaneum. Besides extending the ankle, the gastrocnemius will assist in flexing the knee joint. The chief object, however, which appears to be gained by the femoral attachment of this muscle is the addition to the rapidity of extension of the foot. Like some of the other long muscles which pass over two joints, the gastrocnemius, if it were an inextensible ligament, would cause extension of the ankle as soon as the knee was straightened by means of the great quadriceps muscle. Seeing, however, that during the contraction of the quadriceps the gastrocnemius is at the same time acting, it follows that the rapidity and amount of the extension of the ankle joint is almost doubled. By these means we obtain that rapid and powerful contraction which gives the spring to the body in leaping and running. We may see also how enormously strong the tendon Achillis must be, as it has not only to bear the contraction of the gastrocnemius and soleus, but the additional strain thrown upon it by the simultaneous action of the quadriceps extensor of the knee. The soleus will assist in the extension of the ankle, and will even be able to perform this movement somewhat feebly by itself,896 THE MUSCLES when in extreme flexion of the knee joint the gastrocnemius is so relaxed as to be almost powerless. It is much stronger than the gastrocnemius, as may be inferred from the enormous number of short fibres by which it is formed. At the same time, however, as it only passes over the ankle and calcaneo-astragaloid joints, the range of its movements is very short. Variations.—A second soleus is sometimes formed beneath the normal muscle, and more or less separate from it. It is usually inserted into the calcaneum or internal annular ligament. Third Layer The third layer is separated from the superficial layers b}; an aponeurosis called the deep tibial fascia. This is attached to the inner border of the tibia internally, and externally to the outer border of the flexor surface of the fibula, and the posterior of the two external intermuscular septa. It is thin above, but below it is strengthened by transverse fibres, and becomes much thicker. At the ankle it blends with the deep fascia of the leg and the external and internal annular ligaments. The third layer consists of two muscles—the flexor longus digitorum and the flexor longus hallucis. 1. FLEXOR LONGUS DIGITORUM The flexor longus digitorum—named from its being the longer of the two flexors of the toes—is a fusiform sheet. Origin. — (1) The inner part of the posterior surface of the tibia, beginning with the lower half of the oblique line, and ending about three inches above the inner ankle ; (2) the front of the deep fascia which covers the sheet; (3) a thin inter- muscular septum which intervenes between this muscle and the tibialis posticus. Insertion.—The under surface of the base of the ungual phalanx of each of the four outer toes. Structure.—Arising fleshy from the tibia and adjacent fasciae, the fibres pass in a penniform manner into the front and outer side of a tendon which, beginning about the middle of the leg, gradually becomes thicker and stronger, and receives its last fleshy fibres about two inches above the ankle joint. It then passes beneath the internal annular ligament in a compartment posterior and external to that for the tibialis posticus. Thence it runs downwards, forwards, and outwards beneath the first layer of the sole muscles, and, after having received fleshy fibres from the accessorius pedis and a small tendinous slip from the tendon of the flexor longus hallucis, divides, about half-way between the tuberosity of the calcaneum and the heads of the metatarsal bones, into four tendons. These enter the thecse of the four outer toes, and each tendon passes through the splitting of the tendon of the flexor brevis digitorum to its insertion upon the under surface of the base of the third phalanx. The lumbricales arise from its tendons in the sole of the foot. Nerve-supply.—From the posterior tibial nerve by branches which enter the superficial aspect of the muscle near its outer border about the middle of the leg. Action.—To flex the last phalanges of the four outer toes ; it will then help to flex the second and first phalanges and the medio-tarsal joint of the foot. It will also help slightly in the extension of the ankle joint. In flexing the medio-tarsal joint, it will tend to preserve the arch of the instep. Relations.—Superficially, in the leg the soleus, posterior tibial vessels and nerve ; in the foot, the abductor hallucis and flexor brevis digitorum. Deeply, lie the tibialis posticus in the leg, and in the foot the tendon of the flexor longus hallucis, the accessorius, and the muscles which form the third layer of the sole of the foot.FLEXOB LONG US DIGITOBUM 397 Variations.—An accessory head sometimes arises in the leg from the fibnla, the tibia,, or the deep fascia of the leg ; it may join the rest of the muscle in the leg, or in the sole. Fig. 292.—The Deep Muscles or the Back of the Leg. Some of the tendons to the toes may be wanting; more often they are increased in number and supply the deficiencies of the fiexor brevis digitorum, and especially by sendijig slips to the little toe.THE MUSCLES 398 2. FLEXOE LONGUS HALLUCIS The flexor longus hallucis—named from its action upon the great toe {hallux) and its length—is a strong fusiform sheet. Origin.—The lower two-thirds of the postero-internal (or flexor) surface of the fibula external to the oblique line ; (2) the intermuscular septa between it and the tibialis posticus in front, and the peronei outside; (3) the deep fascia covering its posterior surface ; (4) the lowest portion of the interosseous membrane. Insertion.—(1) The under surface of the base of the last phalanx of the great toe ; (2) by a small slip into that part of the flexor longus digitorum tendon which is distributed to the second and third toes. Structure.—The muscle arises by fleshy fibres which pass with a bipenniform arrangement into the tendon. This tendon appears first just below the middle of the leg at the back of the muscle near its inner border. The fleshy fibres are inserted into it as far as the ankle joint, and just above this point the tendon passes through the groove at the outer part of the back of the lower end of the tibia. The tendon then grooves the back of the astragalus, and afterwards the under surface of the sustentaculum tali, where it lies external to the tendon of the flexor longus digitorum. From this point it passes forwards in the second layer of the muscles of the sole, lying above and crossing the tendon of the flexor longus digitorum, to which it gives a small slip. It then crosses beneath the inner head of the flexor brevis hallucis, lies in the groove between the sesamoid bones of that muscle, and is finally inserted into the base of the last phalanx. Nerve-supply.—From the posterior tibial nerve by branches which enter the muscle in the upper part of its posterior surface near its inner border. Action.—This muscle, which is much more powerful than the flexor longus digitorum, is a strong flexor of the last phalanx of the great toe, and is of great importance in walking, as it presses the great toe firmly against the ground. The ungual phalanx of the great toe is the last part of the foot to leave the ground when : the step is completed ; and until this is the case the flexor longus hallucis is strongly contracted. It will also help to flex the first phalanx of the great toe upon its metatarsal bone and it will act upon the joints which intervene between the first metatarsal bone and the astragalus ; and, finally, it will assist in the extension of the ankle joint. Relations.—Superficially, in the leg, it is covered by the soleus, and in the foot by the abductor hallucis, the flexor longus digitorum, the external plantar vessels and nerve ; on its outer side are the peronei; on its deep aspect in the leg lie the tibialis posticus and the peroneal vessels; and, after passing over the back of the ankle and other joints, it lies upon the inner head of the flexor brevis hallucis. Variations. —An accessory portion of the muscle may be inserted into the sustentaculum tali or the inner surface of the calcaneum. The slip to the flexor longus digitorum tendon may vary in the number of toes to which it is distributed. Fourth Layer The fourth layer consists of one muscle—the tibialis posticus. TIBIALIS POSTICUS The tibialis posticus—named from its position in the back part of the leg and its origin from the tibia—is a thick fusiform sheet. Origin.—(1) The whole of the back of the interosseous ligament with the exception of the lowest portion ; (2) the posterior surface of the tibia close to the interosseous; line, from the upper end of the oblique line to the junction of the middle and lowersTIBIALIS POSTICUS 399 thirds of the shaft; (3) the antero-internal (or inner part of the flexor) surface of the fibula at the back of the interosseous ridge to within an inch or two of the ankle; (4) the intermuscular septa which intervene between it and the muscles of the third layer, viz. the flexor longus hallucis and the flexor longus digitorum ; and (5) a small portion of the deep fascia covering the back of the third layer. Insertion.—(1) The tuberosity of the scaphoid bone ; (2) by several smaller offsets into the front of the lower surface of the sustentaculum tali and the under surface of all the other tarsal bones with the exception of the astragalus ; and (3) the under surface of the bases of the second, third, and fourth metatarsal bones. I Structure.—A strong bipenniform muscle, the central tendon of which, lying upon the middle of the back of the muscle, begins about the middle of the leg, and ipasses downwards and inwards upon the back of the muscle, receiving its last fleshy [fibres about an inch above the ankle. Having passed inwards beneath the tendon of the flexor longus digitorum, it enters the innermost groove on the back of the internal malleolus, and is contained in a synovial sheath which accompanies it to its 'nsertion upon the scaphoid bone. From this insertion strong fibrous bands radiate ackwards, outwards, and forwards to the tarsal and metatarsal bones, being inti- ately blended wdth the ligaments by which these bones are held together. This uscle, which is very strong, is contained, so to speak, in a four-sided prismatic case "ormed in the front by the interosseous membrane; at the sides, by the opposing urfaces of the tibia and fibula ; and behind, at a distance of nearly half an inch from he interosseous membrane, by the intermuscular septa which separate the muscle rem the flexor longus hallucis and the flexor longus digitorum. Just above its insertion into the tuberosity of the scaphoid bone, the tendon ften contains a sesamoid bone. Nerve-supply.—From the posterior tibial, which sends branches forwards to he back of the muscle in the upper third of the leg. Action.—(1) To adduct the front of the foot; (2) to invert the sole ; (3) to xtend the ankle—the last of these movements is somewhat limited ; (4) to upport the longitudinal arch of the foot—firstly, by drawing backwards the lower art of the scaphoid, and so preventing the descent of the head of the astragalus etween the scaphoid and calcaneum, and secondly by its traction upon the other arsal bones upon which the secondary offsets of its tendon are inserted. Relations.—Superficially, the soleus and third layer of muscles of the leg, the osterior tibial and peroneal vessels and the posterior tibial nerve above; the endon of the flexor longus digitorum and the abductor hallucis below ; deeply, he ankle joint and inferior calcaneo-scaphoid ligament. The anterior tibial vessels "ass through a notch at the upper extremity of the muscle, between its tibial and bular origins. f THE FASCIA AND MUSCLES OF THE SOLE OF THE FOOT The plantar fascia is, like the corresponding fascia in the palm, very strong, and is divided into three parts. The central part, which is the strongest, arises from the under surface of the calcaneum at the back of the tubercles. It is triangular in shape and expands forwards to its attachment at the base of the toes, where it splits into five divisions. Each division forms an a^rch over the tendons entering the toe, and is continuous with the ligamentum vaginale of the theca. The sides of the arch pass upwards to be attached to the deep transverse ligament which I400 THE MUSCLES connects the heads of the metatarsal bones and to the lateral ligaments of the metatarso-phalangeal joints. The under sm'face of the fascia is attached to the deep sm-face of the skin by small fibrous bands which form the walls of compartments containing pellets of fat. These fibrous connections give firmness to the skin of the sole and prevent it from being moved about upon the subjacent fascia. The borders of the central portion of the plantar fascia are continued upwards into the sole by the internal and external intermuscular septa, w^hich are attached above to the fibrous structures on the under surface of the tarsal bones. The inner portion, which is the thinnest division of the plantar fascia, is attached behind to the inner border of the Fig. 293.—First Layer of the Muscles of the Sole. Abductor minimi digiti" Plexor brevis minimi digiti- Tendon of flexor ]ongus- digit ortim great tubercle of the calcaneum and to the lower border of the internal annula ligament. It is inserted in front upon the inner side of the base of the first phalan:| of the great toe, and above it becomes continuous with the deep fascia covering th'] instep. The external portion is very thick, and arises from the outer border of th lesser tubercle of the calcaneum and the lower border of the external annula ligament. It terminates in front in the base of the first phalanx of the little toe and at its inner border it blends with the central portion of the plantar fascia where it is joined by the external intermuscular septum, and upon its outer horde it is closely connected with the base of the fifth metatarsal bone, and it i continuous with the deep fascia covering the instep.ABDUGTOB HALLUCIS—FLEXOB BBEVIS DIGITOBUM 401 In the web between the toes some thin transverse fibres are found, the superficial Ifcransverse ligament of the toes. They bridge over part of the interval between the five shps into which the front part of the central division of the plantar fascia breaks up. The muscles and tendons in the sole of the foot are divided into four layers. The first layer consists of three muscles, which correspond in their position to the hree compartments formed by the plantar fascia and the two intermuscular septa, iz. the abductor hallucis, the flexor brevis digitorum, the abductor minimi digiti. 4 First Layer 1. ABDUCTOR HALLUCIS The abductor hallucis—named from its action upon the great toe—is a thick riangular sheet, with a broad origin behind, which is divided into two heads. Origin.—Outer head : (1) The front and inner surfaces of the inner or greater ' ubercle on ihe under surface of the calcaneum ; (2) the deep surface of the inner -ortion of the plantar fascia ; (3) the intermuscular septum which separates it rem the flexor brevis digitorum. Inner head: (1) The deep aspect of the lower order of the internal annular ligament; (2) the under surface of the attachment f the tendon of the tibialis posticus to the tuberosity of the scaphoid bone and the djacent prolongations of this tendon. Insertion.—The inner part of the lower surface of the base of the first phalanx f the great toe and the inner side of the internal sesamoid bone. Occasionally, Iso, the inner border of the expansion of the extensor proprius hallucis on the ack of the first phalanx. Structure.—The outer head arises in close connection with the flexor brevis ■gitorum by short tendinous fibres, soon succeeded by a divergent fleshy bundle hich is joined about two inches from its origin by the fleshy sheet formed by the ner head. The tendon to which these fleshy fibres converge appears first upon he inner and lower aspect of the muscle, and receives fleshy fibres nearly to its sertion, which is closely blended with that of the inner portion of the flexor brevis allucis. The deep surface of the muscle arises from a fibrous arch attached on he one side to the septum between it and the flexor brevis digitorum; on the other ide to the tibialis posticus tendon and the fibrous tissue covering the under surface !f the tarsal bones along the inner border of the foot. Through this arch pass le plantar vessels and nerves. Nerve-supply.—The internal plantar division of the posterior tibial nerve, b^ laments which enter the deep surface of the middle of the muscle. Action.—(1) To flex the first phalanx upon the metatarsal bone ; (2) to abduct rem the middle line of the foot the first phalanx of the great toe. Relations.—Superficially, the internal division of the plantar fascia; upon its uter border, the flexor brevis digitorum ; deeply, the tendons of the tibialis iiiiticus, tibialis posticus, flexor longus digitorum, flexor longus hallucis, the plantar vessels and nerves. Variations.—A third head is occasionally derived fi'om the deep surface of the skin ipon the inner border of the foot, or from the long plantar ligament. The muscle may give slip to the second toe. 2. FLEXOR BREVIS DIGITORUM The flexor brevis digitorum pedis, or flexor perforatus—named from its being e shorter of the flexors of the four outer toes—is a triangular sheet, divided in rent into four processes corresponding to the tendons of the toes. DD402 THE MUSCLES Origin.—(1) The outer part of the front of the lower surface of the great tubercle of the calcaneum ; (2) the deep surface of the back part of the central portion of the plantar fascia ; (3) the back part of the intermuscular septa on either side. Insertion.—The sides of the middle phalanx of each of the four outer toes upon its plantar aspect. Structure.—Arising tendinous by a pointed process from the under surface of the great tubercle, the fleshy fibres extend in a fan-shaped sheet, which, about half- way between the origin and the heads of the metatarsal bones, divides into four fleshy processes which soon become tendinous. The tendons are arranged in a similar manner to those of the flexor sublimis digitorum in the hand. After splitting' beneath the first phalanx of the toe, the two halves of the tendon pass round the sides of the flexor longus digitorum tendon, and about the level of the base of the second phalanx they unite by their adjacent margins, and again diverge to be attached to the sides of the plantar surface of the second phalanx. Nerve-supply.—From the internal plantar division of the posterior tibial, by branches which enter the back of the deep aspect of the muscle near its inner' border. Action.—This muscle, which is comparatively feeble, will flex the second phalanges of the toes, and in combination with the flexor longus digitorum it will assist in walking, by pressing the under surface of the phalanges of the toes against the ground. After it has flexed the second phalanges, it will act in a similar manner upon the metatarso-phalangeal and medio-tarsal joints. Relations.—Superficially, the plantar fascia ; on either side, the other muscles of the first layer of the sole ; deeply, the tendon of the flexor longus digitorum and the lumbricales, the accessorius muscle, and the external plantar vessels and nerve, Variations.—The part of the muscle which belongs to the little toe is often absent, and its place may be supplied by a small perforated slip from the tendon of the flexor longus j digitorum. ^ 3. ABDUCTOR MINIMI DIGITI The abductor minimi digiti (pedis)—named from its action upon the fifth anci smallest toe—is a thick triangular sheet, partly muscular and partly aponeurotic, i Origin.—(1) The outer side and the under surface of the front of the lesse]; tubercle of the calcaneum and the adjacent portion of the under surface of tha bone in front of the great tubercle ; (2) the upper surface of the back part oj the outer division of the plantar fascia; (3) the outer surface of the back part o ,' the external intermuscular septum ; (4) the long plantar ligament and other liga; mentous structures lying upon the outer border of the sole, and more especialbj an aponeurotic band which runs from the outer side of the lesser tubercle of thij calcaneum to the outer side of the base of the fifth metatarsal bone, and of the bas(j of the first phalanx of the fifth toe. j Insertion.—(1) The outer part of the under surface of the base of the firsj phalanx of the little toe ; (2) usually also the outer part of the under surface the base of the fifth metatarsal bones ; (3) the outer edge of the fourth tendon oj the extensor longus digitorum upon the back of the first phalanx of the little toe. j Structure.—The muscle, which is at first encased in the aponeuroses, frorj which as well as from the bone it takes origin, converges from both sides upon j tendon which is first visible on its under surface at the front of the calcaneum. i| small portion of its outer part is now inserted into the tubercle of the fift'i metatarsal bone, internal to the strong aponeurotic band which is also here attache( j From this point the tendon of insertion is free on its inner side, but receives flesh I i i403 ABDUCTOR MINIMI DIGITI fibres still from the continuation of the aponeurotic band just mentioned, until it is inserted into the base of the first phalanx. Nerve-supply—From the external plantar division of the posterior tibial nerve, by filaments which enter the back part of the deep surface of the muscle near its inner border. j Action.—(1) To abduct the first phalanx of the little toe from the middle line ; |[2) to flex the metatarso-phalangeal joint of the little toe. ; The usual action of the muscle will be a combination of these two movements. I Relations.—Superficially, the plantar fascia, the flexor brevis Idigitorum, and Fig. 294.—Second Layer of the Muscles of the'Sole. Origin of abductor minimi digiti Part of abductor minimi digiti Flexor brevis minima digiti Abductor minimi digiti liumbricales Tendon of flexor brevis digit or urn Flexor brevis digitorum Abductor hallueis Aecessorius Plexor longus digitorum Flexor longus hallueis Flexor brevis hallueis Adductor hallueis Abductor hallueis ven a small portion of the abductor hallueis. Deeply, the aecessorius, flexor revis minimi digiti, long plantar ligament, and peroneus longus tendon. Variations.—The muscular slip attached to the base of the fifth metatarsal bone is often ) distinct as to form a separate muscle, the abductor ossis metatarsi quinti. Second Layer The second layer consists of the flexor aecessorius muscle, the four lumbricaleS; nd the tendons of the flexor longus hallueis and the flexor longus digitorum. D D 2THE MUSCLES 404 1. FLEXOR ACCESSORIUS DIGITORUM PEDIS The flexor accessorius digitorum pedis—named from its accessory or supple- mentary action in assisting the flexion of the toes by the flexor longus digitorum— is a double-headed quadrilateral sheet. Origin.—Inner head: The whole of the concave inner surface of the calcaneum below the groove for the flexor longus hallucis. Outer head: (1) The junction of the lower and outer surfaces of the calcaneum| in front of the lesser tubercle; (2) the under surface of the back part of the longi plantar ligament. Insertion.—The upper surface and outer border of the flexor longus digitorum 1 tendon about midway between the tubercles of the calcaneum and the heads of the; metatarsal bones. I Structure.—Its inner head consists of fleshy fll)res which converge from their! origin in a somewhat fan-shaped sheet, and are joined shortly before their insertioiii into the tendon by the outer head, which consists of a pointed tendinous origin,: from which the fleshy fibres form a somewhat smaller fan-shaped sheet which blends with that from the inner head, to be inserted by fleshy fibres upon the upperi surface and outer border of the flexor longus digitorum, at its point of division into the tendons for the four outer toes. Nerve-supply.—From the external plantar division of the posterior tibial nerve,j by branches which enter the under surface of the muscle near its origin. > Action.—To help in the flexion of the last phalanges of the four outer toes,j and at the same time to draw the toes somewhat outwards. On account of the oblique direction of the tendons of the flexor longus digitorum in the foot, they! would tend in flexing the toes to draw them at the same time inwards. Thigs tendency will be somewhat neutralised by the simultaneous contraction of the accessorius. The accessorius will also be able to flex the toes when, on account oJ' the extension of the ankle joint, the muscular fibres of the flexor longus digitormx are so relaxed as to be incapable of action. j Relations.—Superficially, the tendons of the flexor longus digitorum ancl flexor longus hallucis, with the external plantar vessels and nerve ; deeply, th(: flexor brevis hallucis and long plantar ligament. ; Variations.—An additional head may arise above the ankle from the flexor longmi digitorum, flexor longus hallucis, or soleus. Sometimes the outer head is wantmg, anc occasionally the whole muscle is absent. The distribution of its fibres to the tendons o:j the long flexor is very variable. It may send fibres to the tendon of the flexor longus hallucis. 2. THE FOUR LUMBRICALES The four lumbricales—named from their shape (lumbricus = nn earthworm)-i are, like those in the palm, four small fusiform muscles. Origin.— The first, from the inner border of the innermost tendon of the flexoi longus digitorum, from the point of division of the main tendon for about an incl; forwards ; the other three, from the adjacent surfaces of the tendons of the firs! and second, the second and third, and the third and fourth tendons of the flexo i longus digitorum on their plantar aspect. Insertion.—The inner border of the expansion of the extensor longus digitoruu' tendon upon the back of the first phalanx of each of the four outer toes. Structure.—The origin of the muscle is entirely fleshy. It ends in a smal rounded tendon a short distance above the web of the toes. This tendon run forwards and upwards upon the inner side of its toe, above the superficial transvers405 LUMBBICALES—FLEXOB BBEVIS HALLUCIS gament of the toes and beneath the deep transverse ligament of the metatarsus ) the side of the expansion of the extensor tendon. ' Nerve-supply.—The two inner are supplied by the internal plantar division of 16 posterior tibial nerve, by filaments which enter the back part of the lower irface of each muscle near its inner border; the two outer, by the external lantar nerve, by filaments which enter the deep part of each muscle near its ater border. Action.—(1) To flex the first phalanx of the toe; (2) to straighten the second ad third phalanges. (3) The first will abduct the second toe from the axis lassing through it, which is looked upon as the middle line of the foot. The three ithers will adduct. The lumbricales will be able to act upon the first phalanges, wen when the second and third have been flexed by means of their special flexors. I'he chief advantage derived from the simultaneous extension of the two terminal halanges and the flexion of the first phalanx is the application of the whole length ,f the toe to the ground in walking ; otherwise there would be a strong tendency j) the flexion of the phalanges of the toes, which would prevent the proper Ipplication of the soft plantar aspect of the ungual phalanx to the ground. Relations.—Superficially, the flexor brevis digitorum. Deeply, the flexor longus igitorum tendons, the transversalis pedis, and the interossei. I Third Layer ! The third layer consists of four muscles—the flexor brevis hallucis, the adductor [allucis, the transversus pedis, and the flexor brevis minimi digiti. I 1. FLEXOK BREVIS HALLUCIS The flexor brevis hallucis, or flexor brevis pollicis pedis—named from its ction, and its size in comparison with the other flexor of the great toe—is a thick idangular sheet with a forked insertion. Origin.—(1) The plantar ligaments and the continuations of the tibialis 'osticus tendon in the middle of the sole ; (2) the inner part of the under surface f the cuboid bone. Insertion.—The inner and outer borders of the plantar aspect of the base of the rst phalanx of the great toe. [ Structure.—Arising fibrous by a pointed process in the middle of the sole, the Ibres diverge as they pass forwards and slightly inwards, and form two fleshy I undies of equal size, which are succeeded by short tendons. In each tendon is ontained a sesamoid bone of ovoid shape about three-eighths of an inch in the long ntero-posterior diameter, and a quarter of an inch from side to side, with a artilaginous articular facet upon the upper surface which plays upon the lower urface of the condyles of the first metatarsal bone. At their insertion into the inner nd outer part of the lower border of the base of the first phalanx, they are blended Idth the tendons of the abductor and the adductor hallucis. t Nerve-supply.—From the internal plantar division of the posterior tibial nerve, y filaments which enter the under surface of the muscle near the middle of its iner border. Action.—To flex and slightly adduct the first phalanx of the great toe. The [esamoid bones give a slight obliquity to its insertion, and so enable it to act with jiore power ; at the same time they form a groove in which the strong tendon of lie flexor longus hallucis plays. They also form a somewhat elastic support when he weight is placed upon the ball of the foot. Relations.—Superficially, the abductor hallucis, the tendon of the flexor longusTHE MUSCLES 406 hallueis, and the inner tendons of the flexor longus digitorum with the lumbricales; deeply, the interossei and the termination of the external plantar vessels and nerve. Variations.—A small slip is occasionally given to the first phalanx of the second toe. 2. ADDUCTOR HALLUCIS The adductor hallueis—named from its action upon the great toe—is a triangular sheet, the apex of which is directed forwards and inwards. Fig. 295.—Third Layer of the Muscles of the Sole. Part of abductor minimi digiti Plexor brevis minimi digiti Transversus pedis Flexor longus liallueis Flexor longus digitorum Tibialis posticus Flexor brevis hallueis Adductor liallueis Orig^in.—(1)' The continuation forwards of the long plantar ligament whichj forms the sheath of the peroneus longus tendon ; (2) the under surface of the| bases of the second, third, and fourth metatarsal bones. ^ Insertion.—The outer part of the under surface of the base of the first/phalanx [ of the great toe. ! Strueture.—Arising by short tendinous fibres, the muscle converges in bipenni-j form fashion upon a short tendon, which blends with that of the flexor brevis[: hallueis and the outer sesamoid bone internally, and the transversus pedis i| externally.1 ADDUCTOB HALLUCIS—FLEXOB BBEVIS MINIMI DIGITI 407 Nerve-supply.—From the external plantar division of the posterior tibial nerve )y filaments which enter the upper surface of the muscle upon its outer border lear its origin. Action.—(1) To adduct the first phalanx of the great toe towards the middle ine of the foot; (2) to flex the first phalanx. Usually it will act during walking n combination with the flexor brevis hallucis and abductor hallucis, and the hree muscles contracting together will produce direct flexion of the first phalanx, 0 that when the weight of the body rests upon the front part of the foot the econd phalanx is pressed firmly against the ground by the action of the flexor ongus hallucis, while the first phalanx is acted upon in the same manner by the lombination of these three short muscles. As Duchenne has pointed out, the jbductor and adductor will have an important function in adjusting the pressure ?hen the step has to be made upon uneven ground. Thus, in walking upon , slope the adductor hallucis of the one foot will direct the pressure downwards jud slightly outwards, while the abductor of the other foot will direct the pressure lownwards and slightly inwards. Relations.—Superficially, the flexor longus digitorum tendons and their lumbri- ales; deeply, the interossei with the external plantar vessels and nerve; at the ides, the flexor brevis hallucis and transversus pedis. Variations.—The adductor hallucis sometimes sends a slip to the first phalanx of the lecond toe. 3. TEANSVERSUS PEDIS The transversus pedis—named from the direction of its fibres—is a small jnuscle consisting of three or four fusiform bundles lying side by side, and uniting in h single tendon. Origin.—(1) The plantar ligaments of the three outer metatarso-phalangeal oints; (2) the under surface of the adjacent deep transverse metatarsal ligaments. Insertion.—The outer side of the base of the first phalanx of the great toe. Structure.—The fleshy fibres form a series of small bundles which converge ilightly as they pass inwards and slightly forwards, and after uniting terminate in 1 short tendinous insertion which is closely blended with the outer surface of the endon of the adductor hallucis. Nerve-supply.—From the external plantar division of the posterior tibial nerve )y filaments which pass to the upper part of the posterior edge of the muscle. Action.—(1) To adduct the first phalanx of the great toe ; (2) to draw together he heads of the metatarsal bones after they have been separated by the pressure )f the weight of the body during the tread. Relations.—Superficially, the flexor longus digitorum tendons and lumbricales ; leeply, the interossei. Variations.—Some or all of the bundles may be absent; most frequently the outermost me. Occasionally fibres join the muscle from the fascia covering the interossei below ihe lower border of the adductor hallucis, so that the two muscles are more or less blended. 4. FLEXOR BREVIS MINIMI DIGITI The flexor brevis minimi pedis dig^iti—named from its action upon the little jioe—is small, flattened, and fusiform. ! Orig^in.—(1) The under surface of the base of the fifth metatarsal bone ; (2) the jidjacent part of the sheath of the peroneus longus tendon. Insertion.—(1) The outer part of the under surface of the base of the first phalanx ')f the little toe; (2) the outer part of the front of the under surface of the fifth metatarsal bone.408 THE MUSCLES Structure.—Arising tendinous, the fleshy fibres run forwards and a httle out- wards to their short tendon of insertion, which is closely blended with that of the abductor minimi digiti. A few of the deeper fibres end in the metatarsal bone. Nerve-supply.—From the external plantar nerve by a branch which enters the under surface of the muscle. Action.—To flex and slightly abduct the first phalanx of the little toe. Relations.—Superficially, the flexor longus digitorum and abductor minimi digiti; deeply, the interossei of the outermost interspace. Variations.—-The insertion upon the metatarsal bone may form a separate muscle, the opponens digiti pedis quinti, or it may be entirelj^ absent. Fourth Layer The fourth layer consists of the seven interosseous muscles. INTEROSSEI The interossei—named from their position between the metatarsal bones—are,! like those of the hand, seven in number, three being plantar and four dorsal. The plantar are small and narrow fusiform bundles ; the dorsal are bipenniform and of a somewhat broader fusiform shape than the plantar. The interossei ofj the foot differ from those of the hand in the fact that they adduct and abduct with respect to a longitudinal axis through the line of the second toe; whereas in the! hand the median line passes through the middle finger. The plantar interossei.—Origin.—(1) The inner and lower surface of the three outer metatarsal bones ; (2) the adjacent part of the sheath of the peroneus longus tendon. Insertion.—(1) The inner side of the bases of the first phalanges of the three outer toes ; (2) the inner border of the expansions of the long extensor tendons or the back of the first phalanges of the same toes. The dorsal interossei arise from the adjacent surfaces of the metatarsal bone^ bounding each interosseous space. The first dorsal interosseous, however, differs { somewhat in its internal head, which is from the base only of the first metatarsal bone and the adjacent outer surface of the internal cuneiform, bone. Insertion.—The first dorsal interosseous is inserted into :—(1) the inner side gjI the base of the first phalanx of the second toe ; (2) the inner edge of the aponeurosis of the extensor tendon upon the back of the first phalanx. The second, third anc fourth are inserted respectively into :—(1) the outer side of the bases of the firsi phalanges of the second, third, and fourth toes ; (2) the outer border of the extenso] tendons upon the backs of the same phalanges. Structure.—The plantar interossei are penniform muscles consisting of fleshy fibres which run forwards to the outer side of a tendon which begins about th( middle of the space and becomes free opposite the heads of the metatarsal bones. : The dorsal interossei are bipenniform, and consist of fleshy fibres which coU' verge from both sides of the space upon a central tendon which begins about th(| middle of the interosseous space and becomes free opposite the heads of the meta | tarsal bones. The tendons of both sets of muscles before their insertion lie abov(| the deep transverse metatarsal ligament which separates them from the tendon; of the lumbricales. On the back of the foot the dorsal interossei are alone visible j in the sole of the foot both sets are seen. j Nerve-supply.—From the external plantar nerve by filaments which enter th( plantar aspect of the muscles, somewhat behind the middle of the interosseou space.409 INTEROSSEI hi fOBI mm im'i lever. Action.—The common action of all the interossei is (1) to flex the first lohalanges of the four outer toes ; (2) to extend the second and third phalanges. In these two movements they are assisted by the lumbricales. In walking, this movement is of great importance as it keeps the toes straight when the weight of the body rests upon the front part of the foot. When these movements are paralysed, the action of the long and short flexor of the toes is to curl them up, and the ends of the toes will be subjected to considerable pressure, which may set up inflammation to the beds of the nails. Fig. 296.—Fourth Layer of the Muscles of the Sole. Peroneus longus mi i!iti,iii iilie ; Si ■ .'^00- Plantar interossei Dorsal interossei The special action of the plantar interossei is to adduct the first phalanges of phe three outer toes ; and of the dorsal interossei to abduct the second, third, and fourth toes from the middle line of the second toe. As the second toe can be ibducted from its own middle line in two directions, it of course requires two ibductors. Relations.—On the plantar surface both sets of interossei are in contact with the muscles of the third layer, and with the external plantar vessels and nerve ; on the iorsal surface the dorsal interossei are covered by the tendons of the extensor ^ongus and brevis digitorum. The dorsalis pedis and other perforating arteries pass through the back of the interosseous spaces between the double origins of the iorsal interossei.410 THE MUSCLES MUSCLES OF THE FRONT OF THE LEG Between the anterior border of the tibia and the anterior of the two external intermuscular septa, are placed four muscles : the tibialis anticus, the extensor proprius hallucis, the extensor longus digitorum, and the peroneus tertius. 1. TIBIALIS ANTICUS The tibialis anticus—named from its attachment to the tibia and its position in the front of the leg—is fusiform and somewhat flattened, with a long terminal tendon. Origin.—(1) Part of the under surface of the outer tuberosity of the tibia; (2) the outer surface of the upper two-thirds of the tibia ; (3) the adjacent part of the anterior surface of the interosseous membrane ; (4) the posterior surface of the upper part of the deep fascia of the leg ; (5) an intermuscular septum which separates it from the extensor longus digitorum in the upper third of the leg. Insertion.—The loAver part of the front of the inner surface of the internal cuneiform bone and the adjacent part of the base of the first metatarsal bone. Structure.—A strong penniform muscle the fibres of which, arising fleshy from the bone and from the strong fasciae, pass forwards and most of them somewhat outwards to be attached to the deep surface and outer border of a tendon, which, beginning below the middle of the leg, becomes free of fleshy fibres tw^o or three inches above the ankle-joint; and, after passing first beneath the upper portion of the anterior annular ligament, then partly under and partly over the lower portion, expands slightly to be inserted upon the inner margin of the foot. In passing over the instep it turns upon itself so that its anterior surface becomes below internal. Nerve-supply.—From the anterior tibial division of the external popliteal nerve by branches Avhich enter the upper third of the muscle upon the outer part of its deep aspect. Action.—(1) To flex the ankle joint; (2) to draw upwards the inner border of the foot and so invert the sole ; (3) to adduct the front portion of the foot. The first of these movements will be performed chiefly in the ankle joint; the second and third in the medio-tarsal and calcaneo-astragaloid joints. This muscle is of great importance in walking, as it lifts up the anterior part of the foot and so enables the toes to clear the ground w^hen the leg is swinging forwards to begin another step. Relations.—Superficially, the deep fascia ; on the outer side, the extensor longus digitorum and extensor proprius hallucis with the anterior tibial vessels and nerve; deeply, the interosseous membrane and tibia, and in the upper part of the leg the anterior tibial vessels. The tendon lies in a special synovial sheath beneath the two portions of the anterior annular ligament, and upon the ankle joint and inner bones of the tarsus. A small bursa separates the tendon from the upper part of the inner surface of the internal cuneiform bone. Variations.—A small tendon is sometimes sent to the head of the first metatarsal bone, the base of the first phalanx of the great toe, or to the fascia covering the instep. 2. EXTENSOE PEOPRIUS HALLUCIS The extensor proprius hallucis—named from its being the special extensor belonging to the great toe (proprius = peculiar to)—is a somewhat triangular sheet.EXTENSOB PBOPBIUS HALLUCIS 411 Dorsal interossei Origin.—(1) The middle two fourths of the anterior (or extensor) surface of the fibula external to the attachment of the interosseous membrane (2) the adjacent portion of the anterior surface of the interosseous membrane. Insertion.—(1) The ligamentous structures at the back and sides of the first Fig. 297.—The Muscles of the Front of the Leg. Ligamentum patellae G-astroenemius Soleus Extensor proprius.hallueis412 THE MUSCLES metatarso-phalangeal joint; (2) the dorsal aspect of the base of the second phalanx of the great toe. Structure.—Arismg by fleshy fibres from the bone and interosseous membrane, the muscle is inserted in a penniform manner into a tendon which appears about the middle of the leg upon its inner and front aspect, and becomes clear of muscular fibres about the level of the ankle joint. The tendon now passes beneath the upper part of the anterior annular ligament, and is then included in a special sheath beneath the lower part of the same ligament. Opposite the first metatarso- phalangeal joint it gives oft' from its sides and under surface bands of connective tissue which unite partly with the two lateral ligaments, especially the internal one, and partly with the periosteum upon the sides of the first phalanx. The rest of the tendon is flattened out and fits closely to the dorsal aspect of the first phalanx ; it is finally attached to the second phalanx in a transverse line which crosses the upper surface of its base. Nerve-supply.—From the anterior tibial by filaments which enter the inner and deeper aspect of the muscle about the middle of the leg. Action.—(1) To extend the first phalanx of the great toe; (2) slightly to extend the second phalanx, but this movement is chiefly performed by the small muscles of the sole of the foot, which give oft' expansions to be attached to the borders of the tendon at the sides of the first phalanx; (3) to flex the ankle, and at the same time it will slightly adduct the front of the foot and invert the sole. When the muscle contracts strongly it will hyper-extend the first phalanx, and at the same time flexion of the second phalanx will be produced by the resistance of the flexor longus hallucis tendon. Relations in the leg".—Superficially, the deep fascia, the tibialis anticus, and the extensor longus digitorum ; internally, the tibialis anticus ; externally, the extensor longus digitorum; deeply, the interosseous membrane, the tibia, and the anterior tibial vessels and nerve. The tendon lies beneath the two portions of the anterior annular ligament, and after crossing the anterior tibial artery near the ankle-joint it runs to its insertion with the dorsalis pedis and the innermost tendon of the extensor brevis digitorum on its outer side. Variations.—The muscle is occasionally divided, and a smaller external portion joins the first tendon of the extensor brevis digitorum, or is inserted separately into the head of the first metatarsal bone or the base of the first phalanx. 3. EXTENSOR LONGUS DIGITORUM The extensor longus digitorum—named from its length and its action upon the toes—is fusiform and somewhat flattened, with a four-divided tendon. Origin.—(1) The outer part of the under surface of the external tuberosity of the tibia; (2) the upper three-fourths of the anterior or extensor surface of the fibula ; (3) the outer border of the anterior surface of the interosseous membrane in its upper third ; (4) the posterior surface of the deep fascia of the leg; (5) the intermuscular septa which separate it from the upper part of the tibialis anticus and from the long and short peronei. Insertion.—The three phalanges and the metatarso-phalangeal joints of each of the four outer toes. Structure.—This is a penniform muscle, and its fibres arise fleshy from the bones and the fascia, and pass forwards and inwards to the back and outer side of the long tendon of insertion. This begins about the middle of the leg, and becomes free from fleshy fibres about the level of the ankle joint; it passes behind the upper part of the anterior annular ligament, but not in a special synovial sheath then beneath the lower part of the anterior annular ligament in a special synovial IEXTENSOR LONGUS DIGITOBUM—PEBONEUS TEBTIUS 413 sheath with the peroneus tertius. At this point it divides into four tendons, which iiverge upon the back of the foot to the bases of the four outer toes. Each tendon first gives off some strong fibres, which blend with the lateral ligaments of the metatarso-phalangeal articulation, and with the periosteum along the borders of itihe first phalanx. It then forms a broad expansion covering the back of the first phalanx, and divides into three parts : the central part is inserted into the dorsal ispect of the base of the second phalanx ; and the two lateral parts pass forwards With a slight convergence upon the back of the second phalanx to be inserted into the dorsal aspect of the base of the third phalanx. Nerve-supply.—From the anterior tibial by filaments which enter the deep aspect of the muscle in its upper third. Action.—(1) To extend the first phalanges of the four outer toes. It has some linfluence upon the second and third phalanges, but the distal part of its tendon is acted upon chiefly by the short muscles in the sole of the foot, which are attached to the border of the expansion upon the firsc phalanx. When the muscle jsontracts to its fullest amount the first phalanges are extended, while the second land third phalanges are somewhat flexed by the long and short flexors. (2) To flex the ankle joint. (3) Slightly to abduct and evert the front part of the foot. Relations.—Superficially, the deep fascia of the leg and the anterior annular ligaments ; on its inner side, the tibialis anticus and extensor proprius hallucis, the janterior tibial vessels and nerve with their continuations in the foot. Externally, jthe intermuscular septum which separates it from the peroneus longus and brevis, Ithe musculo-cutaneous nerve, and, lower down, the peroneus tertius. Behind, the fibula and interosseous membrane with the anterior tibial nerve above; below, the ankle-joint, tarsal and metatarsal bones, and the extensor brevis digitorum. Variations.—^The muscle may be divided nearly up to its origin. It may give off slips |fco the extensor proprius hallucis, extensor brevis digitorum, or one of the interossei. Sometimes also it has an insertion into some of the metatarsal bones. 4. PERONEUS TERTIUS The peroneus tertius—named from Trepovr], the fibula, and called tertius because it is the third of the muscles which pass from the fibula to the metatarsus—is a small triangular sheet which is closely blended with the preceding muscle. Origin.—(1) The lower fourth of the anterior (or extensor) surface of the fibula ; (2) the front of the interosseous membrane for an inch or two above the ankle jjoint; (3) the external intermuscular septum and the deep fascia of the leg. Insertion.—The upper part of the base of the fifth metatarsal bone. Structure.—^Arising fleshy, the muscular fibres pass downwards and inwards in penniform fashion to a tendon which appears on the inner border of its anterior surface. It becomes free from fleshy fibres at the level of the ankle joint, and after passing beneath the upper part of the anterior annular ligament, is included with [the extensor longus digitorum in a special synovial sheath beneath the lower part [of the ligament, and finally diverges from it'to be inserted into the inner part of the upper surface of the base of the fifth metatarsal bone. Nerve-supply.—Unlike the other peronei, which are supplied by the musculo- cutaneous nerve, it receives filaments from the anterior tibial which enter the inner and deep aspect of the muscle in the upper part of its course. Action.—(1) To flex the ankle joint; (2) to abduct the anterior part of the foot; (3) slightly to elevate the outer border of the foot and so to produce eversion of the sole. Relations.—Superficially, the anterior annular ligament and branches of theTHE MUSCLES 414 musculo-cutaneous nerve ; on the inner side, the extensor longus digitorum, of which | it is really a subdivision ; on the outer side, the peroneus brevis; deeply, the ankle | and outer tarsal joints with the extensor brevis digitorum. \ Fig. 298.—The Muscles of the Dorsum of the Foot. Extensor longue digitorum Tibialis antietis Extensor brevis digitorum Extensor proprius hallueis Dorsalinterossei Peroneus brevis Peroneus tertius Plexor brevis minimi digiti Variations.—The peroneus tertius is often closely blended with the extensor longus digitorum. It is sometimes wanting, and replaced by a slip of tendon from the extensor longus digitorum. Occasionally it sends slips of tendon to the expansion of the extensor longus digitorum on the first phalanx of the two outer toes, or to the fourth dorsal interosseous.EXTENSOR BBEVIS DIGITOBUM—PEEONEUS LONGUS 415 MUSCLE ON THE DORSUM OF THE FOOT This consists of the four bellies of one muscle—the extensor brevis digitorum. , EXTENSOR BREVIS DIGITORUM The extensor brevis digitorum—named from its being the shorter of the two nuscles which extend the toes—is a triangular sheet which breaks up in front into 'our small divisions. Origin.-—(1) The outer part of the upper surface of the great process of the jalcaneum; (2) the interior of the loop of fascia which forms the outer part of the ower anterior annular ligament. Insertion.—By four tendons into the four inner toes ; the innermost is attached j]0 the outer border of the upper surface of the first phalanx of the great toe near ts base ; the three other tendons to the outer border of the tendons of the extensor ongus digitorum just in front of the bases of the first phalanges. Structure.—Arising superficially by fleshy, and on the deep surface by short tendinous fibres, the muscle diverges iuAvards and forwards, and soon divides into i'our fleshy bellies, of which that to the great toe is the largest and most separate. iEach portion has a bipenniform arrangement, with its central tendon upon the jiorsal surface, and becoming free opposite the middle of the metatarsus. Nerve-supply.—From the anterior tibial nerve by small filaments which enter |:he deep surface of the muscle near its inner border as it crosses the cuboid and jBxternal cuneiform bones. ^ Action.—(1) To extend the four inner toes. In the case of the outer toes the two last phalanges will be chiefly extended, and the obliquity of its insertion, by causing t to draw the toes somewhat outwards at the same time that it extends them, will mable it to correct the opposite tendency of the long extensor. (2) The innermost ;endon will act as an adductor of the first phalanx of the great toe. ! Relations.— Superficially, the tendons of the extensor longus digitorum and peroneus tertius ; deeply, the tarsal and tarso-metatarsal joints ; and, in the case of jihe tendon to the great toe, the dorsalis pedis vessels and the termination of the anterior tibial nerve. ! Variations.—The number of tendons may be diminished or increased. Sometimes a lendon is given to the little toe. Accessory bundles may be derived from some of the tarsal or metatarsal bones, and slips have been foimd running to the dorsal interossei; and also a small slip between the first and second bellies, going to the inner side of the j^econd toe or its metatarsal bone. MUSCLES ON THE OUTER SIDE OF THE LEG Consists of two muscles—the peroneus longus and brevis—situated upon the uter side of the fibula in a compartment of quadrilateral section, bounded inter- ally by the fibula, in front and behind by intermuscular septa, and externally by ihe deep fascia of the leg. 1. PERONEUS LONGUS The peroneus longus (figs. 292, 296)—named from its being the longer of the two fibularj",muscles—is long and fusiform.THE MUSCLES 416 Origin.—(1) The outer tuberosity of the tibia by a few fibres ; (2) the front of the head of the fibula ; (3) the upper two-thirds of the outer (or peroneal) surface of the fibula, occupying the whole of this surface above, and the posterior half of it below ; (4) the inner surface of the deep fascia of the leg, and the opposed surfaces of the two external intermuscular septa. Insertion.—(1) The lower part of the outer surface of the base of the first meta- tarsal bone ; (2) the lower part of the outer surface of the internal cuneiform bone close to its articulation with the first metatarsal bone. Structure.—This is a strong penniform muscle, the short fleshy fibres of which pass downwards, and for the most part forwards, to be inserted into the tendoE which, beginning about three inches below the head of the fibula, runs along the front of the outer surface of the muscle, and becomes free in the lower third of the leg. It then passes behind the outer ankle, beneath the external annular ligament! in a special sheath with the tendon of the peroneus brevis, which lies in front of it On the outer surface of the calcaneum it runs forwards and downwards in a specia' compartment of the external annular ligament below the companion tendon. At! the outer border of the foot it again changes its direction, and passes obliquel}! inwards and forwards across the sole of the foot, in a canal formed by the lon^i plantar ligament beneath, and by the groove in the cuboid bone above, to itsj insertion near the inner side of the sole. In the upper two-thirds of the leg th(! peroneus longus almost entirely conceals from view the peroneus brevis, which lies! beneath and slightly anterior to it. The synovial tube which it enters at the outer anlde is common to it and th( peroneus brevis, and bifurcates to accompany the two tendons where they are separated by the peroneal tubercle of the os calcis. A second sheath envelopes th« tendon in the sole, and where the tendon enters this canal it often contains { sesamoid bone which plays upon the front of the ridge of the cuboid bone. Nerve-supply.—From the musculo-cutaneous branch of the external poplitea nerve by filaments which enter the deep and posterior aspect of the muscle in it! upper third. Action.—(1) To extend the anlde joint; (2) to abduct the anterior part of th foot; (3) to depress the inner border of the foot, and so to evert the sole ; (4) h | drawing backwards and outwards the base of the first metatarsal bone, it tends 11 render more concave the antero-posterior and transverse arches of the foot. In th j former action it assists the tibialis posticus. In walking, it will act with the gastrocnemius and soleus in lifting the heel froi the ground, and its tendency to evert the sole and abduct the foot will counterac the opposite tendency of the muscles attached to the tendo Achillis. Moreover, th tendency of this latter set of muscles is to press the outer part of the ball of th toes firmly upon the ground. On the other hand, the influence of the peroneu longus in extending the foot is especially exerted upon the ball of the great to( By the combined action of all these extensors of the ankle the whole of the ba. of the foot is pressed evenly upon the ground and firmness of tread secured. Relations.—Superficially, the deep fascia, the external annular ligament; and i the sole the abductor minimi digiti, the adductor hallucis, and long plantar ligament in front, the peroneus brevis, the extensor longus digitorum, and the musculd cutaneous nerve ; behind, the soleus and flexor longus hallucis ; deeply, the externi popliteal nerve which occupies a fibrous canal below the head of the fibula, tt ankle joint, calcaneum, cuboid, and the bases of the second and third metatars; bones. Variations.—Sometimes a second peroneus arises between the peroneus longus ar brevis, and sends its tendon to join that of the peroneus longus. A slip may be given the external annular ligament. The insertion of the muscle may extend to the bases i the adjacent metatarsal bones.PERONEUS BBEVIS—EXTEBNAL INTERCOSTALS 417 2. PERONEUS BREVIS i The peroneus brevis (figs. 292, 298)—named from its being the shorter of the two libular muscles—is also a triangular sheet. Oris^in.—(1) The lower two-thirds of the outer (or peroneal) surface of the ibula ; (2) the deep fascia of the leg and the intermuscular septa in front and behind. [ Insertion.—(1) The outer part of the base of the fifth metatarsal bone ; (2) the l)uter border of the expansion of the tendon of the extensor longus digitorum upon iihe first phalanx of the little toe. i Structure —This is also a penniform muscle. The short fibres pass obliquely orwards and inwards to the tendon which runs along the outer surface of the uscle close to its anterior border. It becomes free from fleshy fibres just above he external malleolus where it passes beneath the external annular ligament in the ame sheath with the peroneus longus tendon, and after changing its direction runs orwards and somewhat downwards upon the outer surface of the calcaneum and hove the peroneal tubercle. Nerve-supply.—The musculo-cutaneous branch of the popliteal nerve by laments which enter the deep aspect of the muscle about the middle of the leg. Action.—(1) Slightly to extend the ankle; (2) to abduct the anterior part of he foot; (3) slightly to elevate the outer border of the foot and so evert the sole. Relations.—Superficially, the peroneus longus, deep fascia of the leg and external jmnular ligament; in front, the extensor longus digitorum and peroneus tertius ; oehind, the peroneus longus and flexor longus hallucis; deeply, the ankle joint, balcaneum, and cuboid bones. f Variations.—The small slip which the tendon sends on to the expansion upon the little toe may be wanting, or it may be inserted into the first or even the second phalanx. This lip may be entirely separate, so as to form a fourth peroneus. THE MUSCLES OF THE THORAX These consist of six muscles, or sets of muscles, which are attached chiefly to the "ibs, their cartilages, and the sternum : viz. the external and internal intercostals, he levatores costarum, the triangularis sterni, infracostales (or subcostales), and "'aphragm. t Intercostal Muscles The intercostal muscles—named from their position—are long narrow sheets of short oblique muscular fibres which occupy the intercostal spaces. The fibres of the outer sheet run downwards and forwards, and those of the inner downwards and backwards; and the two sheets are the upper continuations of the obliquus externus and internus of the abdominal wall. 1. THE EXTERNAL INTERCOSTALS The external intercostals, which are stronger than the intei^nal, are eleven in number, and fill the space between the ribs from the tubercle to the tip. In the higher spaces, however, they do not come quite so far forwards as below. Above, E E418 THE MUSCLES the lower attachment barely reaches the tip of the rib; while below, the upper * attachment reaches the tip, and the lower is upon the cartilage. Origin.—The lower or outer border of all the ribs except the last, from tubercle to anterior extremity. Fig. 299.—The External Intercostals and Levatores Costarum.

Structure.—Composed of obliquely directed parallel bundles of fleshy fibre, with short tendinous origin, and with a slight admixture of fibrous tissue. The )sterior are more oblique than the anterior fibres. The sheet formed by these )res is thickest behind, and becomes gradually thinner forwards. Between the ,rtilages it is succeeded by a thin membrane, the external intercostal fascia, which composed of fibres running with the same slope as those of the muscle. Nerve-supply.—The intercostal nerves as they run forwards give numerous .aments to the inner surface of the sheets. Action.—See later. Relations.—Superficially, the pectoralis major and minor, the serratus magnus, le external oblique, the latissimus dorsi, the trapezius, rhomboidei, the serrati )stici, the continuation upwards of the erector spinse, and the levatores costarum ; )eply, the internal intercostals and infracostales, the intercostal vessels and nerves. : 2. THE INTERNAL INTERCOSTALS The internal intercostals are eleven in number, and fill the space from the igles of the ribs to the anterior extremity of the cartilages. The fibres, which are Lorter and not quite so oblique as those of the outer sheet, are directed downwards ad backwards. Origin.—The upper border of the subcostal groove of the eleven upper ribs from LB angle forwards, and the continuation of this border upon the cartilages. Insertion.—The inner aspect of the upper border of the eleven lower ribs and ,rtilages. Structure.—The sheets are thicker in front. There is less fibrous tissue mixed ith the fleshy fibres than in the outer sheet. In the upper and lower spaces the 3shy fibres are continued a little further back than the angles. The rest of the lace behind the thin posterior border of the sheet is filled by a thin membrane imposed of fibres running in the same direction, and is called the internal tercostal fascia. Nerve-supply.—Branches from the intercostal nerves, which are supplied to its iter surface or are given off where the nerves are concealed in the interior of the uscle. Action.—See below. Relations.—Superficially, tlie external intercostal muscles, and the intercostal 'teries and nerves ; deeply, the triangularis sterni, infracostales, and the pleura. The action of the intercostal muscles generally is to approximate the ribs to each her, and they are chiefly used in inspiration. The obliquity of their fibres enables .em with a small contraction to produce a greater approximation than if they n perpendicularly between the ribs (page 301). Moreover, if the fibres were all rected, like those of the outer sheet, downwards and forwards, there would be a ndency for the lower ribs to be drawn backwards as well as upwards in inspiration ; id if, on the other hand all the fibres were directed downwards and backwards like ose of the inner sheet, the tendency would be for the lower ribs to be drawn rwards as well as upwards in inspiration. The combined action of the two sets 'oduces the direct elevation of the ribs, the forward pull of the inner sheet being 'unteracted by the backward pull of the outer sheet. If the external intercostals ere carried forwards as far as the sternum, they would tend to take the sternum i a fixed point and to depress the front extremities of the ribs. A similar result ould follow the continuation backwards of the internal intercostals to the vertebral E E 2THE MUSCLES 420 column. It will be also noticed that the front part of the external, and the back part of the internal intercostal sheets are thin and weak, so as to diminish this tendency towards an expiratory movement. It has been urged that both sets of intercostals cannot approximate the ribs, as in inspiration some of the intercostal spaces are seen to open out and become wider. To this it may be replied that, whatever happens in some of the spaces, it is certain that the general tendency is that of approximation of the ribs and diminution of the intervals between them, as after a full inspiration the last rib is nearer to the first rib. Moreover, it does not always follow that because: a muscle is lengthening it may not be acting (cf. such cases as that of the long head of the triceps when it is used in extending the elbow during the elevation of j Fig. 300.—The Intercostal Muscles. External intercostals Interna] intercostals External intercostals Internal intercostals Infra-eostales the arm). If when most of the ribs are being approximated it should happen tb some of the spaces are found to be widened, the action of the muscle in the.' widened spaces will probably be to prevent a greater separation, and by steadying tl lower ribs to enable the nmscles which descend from them to act. When tl| lowest rib is fixed by the quadratus lumborum and other muscles, it is probable th;| the intercostals, at any rate those of the lower spaces, by approximating the low-, ribs to the last rib, may act as muscles of expiration. The following are"' sonj of the arguments which may be adduced in support of the view that both sets j intercostals act together, and also that their action is usually inspiratory. \ 1. The advantage already mentioned, from their oblique decussation enabliij them to approximate the ribs more completely and at the same time to elevate the iLEVATORES COSTABUM—TBIANGULABIS STEBNI 421 irectly when they act in combination (cf. the action of the external and internal blique in approximating the last rib to the crest of the ilimn). 2. Muscles supplied by the same nerve are rarely antagonistic. 3. In long-standing paralysis of the intercostals the sternum is depressed, the hiest flattened, and kept in a permanent condition of exaggerated expiration. i 4. Galvanism of the intercostals produces expansion of the chest. In Duchenne's speriment he found that when he galvanised so slightly as only to affect the sternal intercostals, the inspiratory movement was small; but when he galvanised p strongly as to affect the nerve, and through the nerve the internal intercostals—■ s was known by the contraction of muscular fibre being felt between the cartilages i the ribs, in which situation the only fleshy fibres are those of the inner set—a i:rong inspiratory movement was produced. From the peculiar shape of the ribs and the mode of their articulation, their ievation is accompanied by a rotation of the arcs formed by them upon their chords !3 that their planes from a sloping attain an almost horizontal position. Hence the idening of the chest during inspiration, in addition to the increase of movement :om before backwards due to the elevation of the tips of the ribs. I 3. LEVATORES COSTAEUM The levatores costarum (fig. 299)—named from their action, as elevators of the lbs—are twelve triangular sheets, which cover the back part of the intercostal paces, and are continuous with the fibres of the external intercostal muscles. Origin.—The tips of the transverse processes of the the last cervical, and all ae thoracic vertebra except the last. Insertion.—The outer surface of the ribs from the tubercle to the angle. Structure.—Arising by short tendinous fibres, the muscle expands in a fan bape, and is attached to the next rib below. Frequently fibres pass over one rib nd are inserted upon the next but one. Nerve-supply.—The intercostal nerves which send branches to their deep urfaces. Action.—To elevate the ribs in inspiration. Relations.—Superficially, the outer upward continuations of the erector spinse ; eeply, the external intercostals, which are continuous with the outer border of tie muscles. ; 4. TRIANGULARIS STERNI As the external and internal oblique muscles of the abdomen are represented y the external and internal intercostals in the thorax, so also the transversalis bdominis has its counterpart in the thin stratum of muscular fibre at the sides of 16 sternum called the triangularis sterni, and the still thinner expansion behind of lie infracostales. The triangularis sterni—named from its shape and its connection with the ternum—is a thin, musculo-membranous, triangular sheet, with the apex below jnd directed internally, while the serrated base is external. I Origin.—(1) The side of the lower third of the back of the sternum; (2) the |pper and lateral part of the back of the ensiform cartilage ; (3) the back of the |iner ends of the fifth, sixth, and seventh costal cartilages. \ Insertion.—The outer end of the back and lower border of the cartilages of the 3cond or third to the sixth ribs, and occasionally the tip of the ribs also. I Structure.—The muscle is membranous at its origin and insertion, and it contains |.iany bands of fibrous tissue. Its fibres diverge fan wise, the lower ones being422 THE MUSCLES horizontal, and in serial continuation with the upper digitations of the transversu abdominis, while its higher fibres run obliquely upwards and outwards. Nerve-supply.—The upper intercostals, which send filaments to its anterio aspect. Action.—To depress the anterior extremities of the ribs to which it is attached and so to help in expiration. Relations.—In front, the internal intercostals, cartilages of the ribs, and interna mammary vessels ; behind, the pleura and pericardium. Fig. 301.—The Muscles attached to the Back of the Sternum. Sterno-tliyroid Sterno-h.yoid. Triangularis stemi Transversalis abdominis 5. INFRACOSTALES The infracostales or subcostales—named from their position beneath the ribs-: form a thin musculo-membranous sheet lining the back of the thorax external t( the tubercles of the ribs ; broader and better developed below, becoming narrowe and thinner above. Frequently it consists of only a few bundles of fibres whicl can be distinguished from the internal intercostals by the fact that they are no confined to one intercostal space. Origin.—The lower part of the inner surface of the ribs near their angles. Insertion.—The upper part of the inner surface of the ribs, each bundle o fibres usually passing over one rib to be inserted upon the next higher. Structure.—^The fibres arise tendinous, run upwards and outwards, and havd tendinous insertions. The higher fibres run more vertically. The lower approacl nearer to the vertebral column, arising from the ribs just external to their tubercles!INFBA COSTALES—DIAPHBA GM 423 I Nerve-supply.—The intercostal nerves, which enter their outer surface. Action.—To depress the ribs, and assist in expiration. Relations.—Externally, the external and internal intercostal muscles ; internally, 16 parietal layer of the pleura, which is separated from them by a thin aponeurosis bmetimes called the endothoracic fascia. I 6. THE DIAPHRAGM The diaphragm—named from its function as the hd(f)payfjia, or partition wall ptween the thorax and abdomen—is a dome-shaped musculo-membranous sheet of ! kidney-shaped outhne when seen from above, and consists of a pair of muscles ith a lateral origin and a central aponeurotic insertion, resembling the two •ansversales abdominis, which unite in the linea alba so as also to form a single jome-shaped biventral muscle. Fict. 802.—Diaphragm. Origin.—By three portions :— 1. Anterior or sternal portion.—The lower border and back of the ensiform jartilage, and the adjacent part of the back of the anterior aponeurosis of the [ransversalis abdominis. ! 2. Lateral or costal portion.—^The lower border and inner surface of the iartilages of the six lower ribs, and sometimes also from the adjacent part of jhe ribs. [ 3. Posterior or vertebral portion.—(1) The ligamentum arcuatum externum, a jibrous thickening of the anterior layer of the lumbar fascia, which stretches from ihe tip of the transverse process of the second lumbar vertebra to the tip of the last rib; (2) the ligamentum arcuatum internum—a fibrous thickening of the |hac fascia, w^hich arches over the upper part of the psoas from the side of the body ')f the second lumbar vertebra to the tip of its transverse process; (3) the crus of he diaphragm—a strong vertical band, fleshy externally, tendinous internally—THE MUSCLES 424 arising on the right side from the front of the bodies of the first to the third or fourth lumbar vertebrtB, from the intervening vertebral discs, and the anterior common ligament; on the left side, from the bodies of the first to the second or third vertebrae only, as well as the discs and anterior common ligament. Insertion.—The front, sides, and back, of the central tendon. Structure.—The fibres, arising fleshy from their extensive origin, pass at first vertically upwards, and then arch inwards to be attached to the borders of the central tendon. The sternal fibres are the shortest, and they are often separated from the costal portion by a small triangular interval filled with areolar tissue, and giving passage to the superior epigastric vessels. The costal origin forms a series of teeth which do not correspond accurately with the number of ribs, some rib cartilages having two teeth attached to them. They interdigitate with the serrations of the transversalis abdominis (fig. 301). The aponeurotic fibres which form thf inner portion of the two crura, after arching in front of the abdominal aorta, artj continued by fleshy fibres which decussate, and so changing sides form a loop round j the oesophagus before joining the central aponeurosis. | The central tendon, or aponeurosis, forms the summit of the dome, and is of a similar outline to the diaphragm, being kidney-shaped, with the concavity behind It approaches nearer the back than the front of the thorax. There is a slighlj notching of its outline in front, which divides it into three parts, so that it ha^j somewhat of a trefoil shape, the right leaflet being the largest, and the left th(i smallest. Its fibres run in many directions. Tjhe diaphragm contains three large foramina, for the passage of the vena cav? inferior, oesophagus, and aorta. Foramina. — Close to the posterior border of the central tendon at the junctioi of the right and middle leaflet is a quadrilateral opening with rounded angles, tb foramen for the vena cava inferior, the outer coat of which vessel is blended with it; j fibrous edges. The oefioyliageal ojjening is oval, with the long diameter directe(| forwards. It is surrounded by fleshy fibres, and lies to the left of the middle line opposite the body of the tenth thoracic vertebra. Through it passes the oesophagus with the left vagus nerve in front, and the right behind ; also a few small oesophagea branches from the thoracic aorta, on their way to join some small oesophagea branches from the gastric artery. The aortic opening, formed by the union of th crura, is fibrous, and of oval shape. It is situated in front of the twelfth thoraci vertebra, and is completed behind by the anterior common ligament. Through i pass the aorta, the vena azygos major, and the thoracic duct. In the crura oi either side are small openings which allow of the passage of the great splanchni nerves, and the left crus is usually perforated also by the vena azygos minor. Nerve-supply.—The two phrenic nerves, chiefly derived from the cervical plexu of each side through the fourth cervical nerves, break up close to the diaphragr into many filaments, Avhich penetrate the muscular structure near the anteric border of the central tendon, and are distributed to the under surface of th muscle. Sympathetic filaments are also given to it from the plexuses whic accompany the phrenic arteries. Action.—To deepen the chest from above downwards, and so produce a mov(j ment of inspiration. The central tendon, Avhich is closely connected by means ( the pericardium with the deep fascia of the neck, is but little depressed ; but it arched fleshy fibres all around flatten, and so increase greatly the capacity of tt sides of the thoracic cavity. At the same time the abdominal viscera are drive! downwards, and as the front part of the parietes is the most yielding, they are als displaced forwards, so as to cause a greater prominence of this part of the abdomei In the expulsive efforts of defecation and parturition, after the diaphragm has firri contracted in a deep inspiration, and the glottis has been closed so as to prevei the escape of air from the chest, the abdominal muscles are able to contract witABDOMINAL PABIETES AND MUSCLES 425 [full effect upon the viscera, which have been pressed down by the previous descent jof the diaphragm. I The lower six ribs are slightly elevated by the diaphragm, and the hypochondria I somewhat dilated, this latter movement being due to the forward and outward I pressure of the depressed viscera. I Relations.—Above lie the pleura and pericardium, the heart and the lungs. Below are the peritoneum, the liver with its ligaments, the stomach, the spleen, j pancreas, kidneys, and suprarenal capsules. The dome-shaped upper convex surface Irises higher upon the right than the left side. On the right side, being raised by ■ the liver, it reaches to the level of the junction of the fifth costal cartilage with the j sternum, and on the left side only to the level of the junction of the sixth costal 'cartilage. Variations.—The oesophageal opening has been found in the right crus, instead of being jl surrounded by decussating fibres from both crura. The sternal portion of the muscle is not infrequently absent. j THE ABDOMINAL PABIETES I The superficial fascia covering the walls of the abdomen is continuous with that of the thorax and lower limbs, and is usually divided into two layers. The first layer is well provided with fat, which in many individuals attains to a considerable thickness, especially in the lower part of the anterior wall. The second or deep layer (Scarpa's fascia) is of a more membranous character and contains a quantity of elastic fibres. Near the groin it is separated from the more superficial layer by blood-vessels and lymphatic glands. Upon its deeper surface it is loosely connected with the deep fascia which invests the external oblique muscle ; but it is closely blended with the linea alba, the fibrous structures in front of the pubic bones, the fascia lata immediately below Poupart's ligament, and the crest of the ilium. Both layers are continued downwards upon the external genital organs. In the male they lose their fat and blend with the suspensory ligament of the penis, the fascia covering that organ, and the dartos and septum of the scrotum. In the female they are continuous with the superficial fascia of the vulva. i . THE ABDOMINAL MUSCLES The muscular portion of the abdominal wall forms a lozenge-shaped figure of which the vertical diagonal extends from the ensiform process to the symphysis pubis, while the transverse encircles the abdomen from tip to tip of the transverse processes of the third lumbar vertebra. The boundaries of this muscular wall are formed, above by the costal cartilages of the six lower ribs ; behind, by the tips of the transverse processes of the lumbar vertebrae; below, by the crests of the ilia and the pubes. More accurately, each lateral half may be looked upon as a four-sided figure of which the upper boundary slopes backwards and downwards; the lower, backwards and upwards; while the long anterior boundary and short posterior boundary are vertical and parallel. The426 THE MUSCLES muscles contained in the parietes may be divided into vertical and transvers The former, three in number, are situated two in front, and one behind ; while tl, latter, also three in number, pass transversely, or with some obliquity, between tl anterior and posterior boundaries of the space. ! The two lateral halves unite in front in a strong fibrous band called the line! alba, which stretches from the tip of the ensiform cartilage to the upper part of tl symphysis pubis. It is partly formed by vertical fibres stretching between thes two points, but chiefly by the interlacement of the transverse and oblique banc of fibrous tissue which pass between the aponeuroses of the muscles upon eith( side. In its lower two-fifths it is not more than one-eighth of an inch broad in its upper three-fifths it is broader, usually not less than a quarter of an incj in width, but in some bodies it may be stretched to a much greater extent. A\ the junction of the lower two-fifths and upper three-fifths is the small fibrous rirJ of the unibilicus through which pass the remnants of the foetal vessels. i Anteeioe Vertical Muscles These are two in number—the pyramidalis and rectus abdominis. 1. PYEAMIDALIS ^ The pyramidalis (fig. 266)—named somewhat fancifully from its triangulsl shape—is a fan-shaped sheet of muscular fibre forming a right-angled triangL of which the shortest side corresponds to the origin, and the other side containiu' the right angle to the linea alba. ' Origin.—(1) The front of the pubic crest ; and (2) the fibrous structure! which cover the front of the body of the os pubis and its symphysis. i Insertion.—The linea alba at a point about half-way between the pubes anj the umbilicus. j Structure.—Arising by a short tendinous sheet, the fleshy fibres converge as the { pass upwards. Those nearer to the middle line ascend vertically, while those whic arise near the pubic spine pass obliquely upwards and inwards to the tendinouj insertion of the muscle into the linea alba three or four inches above th\ symphysis pubis. | Nerve-supply.—From the eleventh and twelfth thoracic nerves and from th ilio-hypogastric branch of the lumbar plexus, through their terminal filament which enter the deep surface of the muscle. ! Action.—By its contraction it pulls upon the linea alba and so upon the lowe end of the ensiform cartilage. It will therefore assist the rectus in flexion of th| thorax upon the pelvis, or of the pelvis upon the thorax. It can also help feebly 11 compress the abdominal viscera. Relations.—Superficially, the aponeuroses of the transverse abdominal muscles ; deeply, the rectus abdominis, from which it is separated by a thin fibrous lamella. | Variations.—The height to which this muscle extends is variable. It may be absen j on one or both sides; or it may be double. 2. EECTUS ABDOMINIS The rectus abdominis (fig. 266)—named from its straight direction—is[a strong ribbon-shaped muscle running vertically on either side of the linea alba from th j pubes to the ensiform and adjacent costal cartilages. ' Origin.—By two tendons : (1) the larger or outer head from the whole of th jI BJECTUS ABDOMINIS 427 I ; j crest of the pubes; (2) the inner head crosses the middle line of the body, and - I arises from the fibrous structures lying in front of the symphysis. ^Insertion.—(1) The anterior surface of the tip of the fifth rib ; (2) the front of the costal cartilages of the fifth, sixth, and seventh ribs ; sometimes also (3) the I deep posterior surface of the ensiform cartilage near its outer border, j Structure.—The inner head arises tendinous from the other side of the middle line, decussating with its fellow ; the outer and stronger head arises by a shorter -{^m I tendon, and is soon joined by the inner head. About an inch above the pubes a I fleshy mass is formed, which expands as it ascends into a broad sheet, which below the umbiHcus lies close to its fellow of the opposite side. Above, the two muscles ! are separated by an interval of at least a quarter of an inch. The insertion, which j is by short tendinous fibres, is three or four times the width of the origin. The • j muscle is also curved considerably forwards to correspond with the convexity of the front wall of the abdomen. At certain intervals transverse bands of fibrous tissue I extend in an irregular zigzag manner across the muscle, especially upon its anterior surface. These are called the lineae transversae, and the transverse depressions which they produce are usually to be seen and felt through the skin. They are j generally three or four in number on either side. One is situated opposite the umbilicus ; the second opposite the tip of the ensiform cartilage ; the third half- way between these points ; and a fourth is sometimes present which extends incompletely across the muscle at some distance below the umbilicus. They are ! firmly connected with the anterior layer of the strong sheath of the muscle, which ji will afterwards be described. They do not extend through the whole thickness of j the muscle, being deficient behind. i Nerve-supply.—From the terminal filaments of the anterior branches of the six lower thoracic nerves which enter the muscle on its posterior surface near the [ outer border; and from the ilio-hypogastric branch of the lumbar plexus. I Action.—(1) By the tendency of the curved bands of the muscle to become j straight during contraction, all the viscera contained in its concavity are compressed. It will, therefore, help in defecation, micturition, and parturition ; also in expira- tion, and especially in strong expiratory efforts, such as coughing and sneezing. I (2) By drawing down the ensiform cartilage and the anterior extremities of the middle ribs, it flexes the thorax upon the pelvis, and at the same time acts as a I flexor of the thoracic and lumbar portions of the spine. Acting less strongly, it fixes the sternum, so that the sterno-mastoids by their contraction may flex the head, e.g. in rising from the recumbent position. (3) Taking its fixed point from above, i it will draw upwards the pubic portion of the pelvis, and so flex the pelvis upon the thorax, as when the lower part of the body is drawn up towards the chest in climbing. The linese transversae, which are the remnants of the septa which divide the I muscular structure at intervals in the lower vertebrates, and which in the crocodile form the abdominal ribs, have had various uses assigned to them. In the first I place, they will tend to keep the muscular fibres in their proper place, and prevent [ them from being separated so as to allow of ventral hernia. Secondly, they will I enable the muscle to act not only upon the points of bone which form its direct I attachment, but, by means of their connection with the sheath of the muscle and I the aponeuroses of which it is formed, they will in some measure diffuse the action ill of the muscle over the lower ribs and the crest of the ilium. Thirdly, they will enable one part of the muscle to act independently, as for example when the lower I part exercises some pressure upon the bladder in micturition. Fourthly, they I prevent extensive separation when the muscle is injured. On account of the severe 1 strain to which the muscle is exposed, it is sometimes ruptured. If the muscular I fibres extended without interruption from the pubes to the ensiform cartilage, I such a rupture would occasion a much wider separation, and consequently much f greater disablement than is now found to be the case. LTHE MUSCLES 428 Relations.—Superficially, the front layer of its sheath above, and below the | pyramidalis ; deeply, it is separated from the transversalis fascia and peritoneum in j the greater part of its course by the posterior layer of its sheath; in its lower | fourth it is in contact with the transversalis fascia; and above, it lies on the \ cartilages of the fifth to the ninth ribs, and covers the intercostal muscles which I lie between them. i Variations.—The rectus may be inserted as high as the fourth or even the third rib. j A lateral rectus is sometimes found between the external and internal oblique muscles, { extending from the tenth rib to the iliac crest. Transverse and Oblique Muscles This group consists of three muscles—the obliquus externus, the obliquus internus, and the transversalis—which lie in successive strata in the abdominal wall. 1. OBLIQUUS EXTERNUS The obliquus externus abdominis—named from its position and direction—is a broad curved sheet, partly muscle and partly aponeurosis, of an irregular quadri-i lateral shape. i Origin.—The outer surface of the eight lower ribs about their middle by a series of nearly horizontal lines which, after crossing each rib obliquely downwards and backwards, extend for a short distance along its lower border. Insertion.—(1) By a strong aponeurosis along the whole of the linea alba;' (2) the front of the os pubis close to the sym^physis; (3) the spine of the pubesi and the adjacent part of the ilio-pectineal line ; (4) the deep fascia of the thigh in a thickened band which stretches from the spine of the pubes to the anterioii superior spine of the ilium ; (5) the anterior half of the outer lip of the cres ' of the ilium; (6) at the lower part of the linea alba some of the fibres (th( triangular fascia) stretch across the middle line, and are inserted into the fron of the crest of the pubes and the inner part of the ilio-pectineal line of the othe:; side. I Structure.—At their origin the muscular fibres form a series of teeth whiclj interdigitate in the upper part of the muscle with the serratus magnus, and in th( lower with the latissimus dorsi. The general direction of the origin is an obliquij line somewhat curved upon itself so as to be convex upwards and backwards; Above and below, the origin is nearer to the anterior extremity of the ribs. Froui this origin the fleshy fibres pass downwards and forwards, and at the same tim j diverge fan wise, at first lying upon the ribs and their cartilages, and then withoui any bony support as part of the muscular wall of the abdomen. The change fron; fleshy to tendinous fibres takes place at some distance from the outer border oj the rectus muscle, in such a way that the fleshy mass terminates rather abruptli in a right angle situated in the iliac region of the abdomen. This angle i formed in front by a vertical line, which passes downwards from the tip of th] ninth costal cartilage ; and below by a horizontal line passing forwards from ; point upon the crest of the ilium an inch or two behind the anterior superior spin( This abrupt limitation of the muscular fibres gives rise to a projection whici is distinctly visible through the skin in a muscular subject. The aponeurosis thuj formed blends in nearly the whole of its extent with that of the adjacent muscL the obhquus internus, and in the middle line it unites at the linea alba with that ( the opposite side. Above, it extends upwards as high as the insertion of the recti! muscle, of which it forms part of the sheath, and in this locality it gives origin 1429 OBLIQUUS EXTEBNUS a part of the pectoralis major. At the lower end of the linea alba the portion which, crossing the middle line, is inserted into the crest of the pubes and the ilio- pectineal line of the other side, is known by the name of the triangular fascia. Fig. 303.—External Oblique and Ilio-tibial Band. Pectoralis major Origin of pectoralis major from aponeurosis of obliquus externus Obliquus externus Linea semilunaris Tensor vaginae femoris Ilio-tibial band Trapezius Serratus magnus LatissimuB dorsi G-luteus maximus Tendon of biceps430 THE MUSCLES \ The insertion into the pubic bone of the same side is interrupted by an interval | corresponding to the crest of the pubes, and forms the external abdominal ring, i From the spine of the pubes to the anterior superior spine of the ihum, the! aponeurosis forms a thickened band shghtly convex downwards, which blends with I the fascia lata, and is called Poupart's ligament. The rest of the insertion into' the outer lip of the crest of the ilium is by short tendinous fibres. The insertion of the lower edge of the aponeurosis is also carried backwards and outwards from the spine of the pubes along the inner part of the ilio-pectineal line by a horizontal triangle of fascia called Gimbernat's ligament. This ligament is attached to the lower end of Poupart's ligament in front, and it presents a concave surface upwards, upon which lie the structures which emerge through ] the external abdominal ring. | The external abdominal ring (fig. 285) is an obliquely directed slit in thei aponeurosis of the obliquus externus, which transmits the spermatic cord in the I male, and the round ligament of the uterus in the female. The slit is formed by the divergence of the obliquely directed fibres of the aponeurosis. Those above, which form the inner pillar, as it is called, of the ring, run down- wards and inwards to be attached to the front of the symphysis pubis; those! below, which form the external pillar of the ring, form a thin edge at first, but thicken just before their attachment to the spine of the pubes and the inner; extremity of the ilio-pectineal line, for at this point the external pillar is identical! with Poupart's ligament. Upon the surface of the obliquus externus, close to the external abdominal ring, the oblique fibres of the aponeurosis are fastened together! by some transversely directed fibres, the intercolumnar fibres, which run upwardsj and inwards from Poupart's ligament, limiting and rounding oft' the upper and' outer end of the external abdominal ring, A thin membrane, the intercolumnari fascia, is prolonged from the edges of this opening over the spermatic cord and! round ligament, of which it forms the external envelope. ! Nerve-supply.—From the anterior branches of the lower thoracic nerves ancj from the ilio-hypogastric and ilio-inguinal nerves which come from the highes ' nerve of the lumbar plexus, by means of numerous filaments which, passing througl the internal oblique, enter the muscle on its deep surface. Action.—(1) The curved muscular fibres in their contraction tend to becom«| straight and so compress the viscera which lie in their concavity; they act iii defecation, micturition, parturition, and all expiratory efforts ; (2) the two obliqu i externi acting together will draw upwards the front part of the pelvis, and so flex 1 ' upon the thorax; (3) the muscle of one side, acting alone or in conjunction witl the internal oblique of the opposite side, will rotate the pelvis and the lower par of the body to the same side; (4) it will tend by its posterior fibres to draw tbj crest of the ilium upwards towards the lower ribs, and will thus act as a lateral flexor of the pelvis upon the thorax ; (5) acting from below, the muscles of thij two sides will draw the thorax downwards and forwards and flex the lumbar an(i lower part of the thoracic spine ; (6) it will rotate the thorax upon the pelvis so a to turn the thorax and the upper part of the body to the opposite side ; (7) th posterior fibres will flex the thorax laterally. Relations.—Superficially, the integuments, and for a short space behind th latissimus dorsi; deeply, the lower ribs, their cartilages, the intercostal muscle between them, and the internal oblique; and below, the spermatic cord or roun ligament in the inguinal canal. j Variations.—The obliquus externus may rise from more or fewer ribs. Occasionall I a deeper plane is separated from the rest of the muscle. In one case, the anterior part (' the aponeurosis was observed to be wanting. iOBLIQUUS INTEBNUS 431 2. OBLIQUUS INTERNUS The obliquus internus abdominis (fig. 266)—named from its relation to the oreceding muscle and the direction of its fibres—is an irregular quadrilateral j3urved sheet, partly fleshy and partly aponeurotic. Origin.—(1) The outer half of Poupart's ligament; (2) the anterior two-thirds 3f the space intervening between the inner and outer lips of the crest of the ilium ; the outer and posterior aspect of the aponeurosis of the transversalis abdominis which aponeurosis is also called the lumbar fascia). Insertion.—(1 ) For about one inch into the inner extremity of the ilio- )ectineal hne ; (2) the anterior border of the crest of the pubes; (3) the whole ength of the linea alba; (4) the lower borders of the cartilages of the last three ibs. Structure—Arising by fleshy and short tendinous fibres intermingled, a fleshy heet is soon formed, the fibres of which diverge ; the anterior passing forwards nd downwards, the middle forwards and upwards, and the posterior directly -pwards to their insertion, which is by means of a broad aponeurosis. At the front f the lower intercostal spaces the fibres run parallel to, and in the same plane "th, the internal intercostals. The position of the change from fleshy to apo- eurotic fibres may be indicated by two lines at right angles to one another; one assing upwards and a little outwards from the middle of Poupart's ligament, the ther horizontally forwards below the tip of the last rib, and near the edges of the ower rib cartilages. The aponeurosis is blended with that of the external oblique, d in its upper three-fourths it divides into an anterior and a posterior plane which ogether form the sheath of the rectus muscle. In the lower fourth of the abdomen he whole of the aponeurosis passes in front of this muscle. The line of division of he aponeurosis of the internal oblique is indicated on the surface of the abdomen by furrow called the linea semilunaris, which lies between the fleshy part of the uscle and the outer border of the rectus muscle, and forms a curve, concave wards, which extends from the cartilage of the eighth rib above to the vicinity of he pubes below. The plica semilunaris, or fold of Douglas, on the other hand, is the name 'ven to the lower edge of the posterior sheath of the rectus, when that muscle ierces the aponeuroses so as to lie behind all of them in the lower fourth of its ourse. The lowest portion of the aponeurosis of insertion of the obliquus internus s closely blended with that of the transversalis abdominis, and is called the onjoint tendon. Nerve-supply.—From the anterior primary branches of the lower thoracic erves, and from the first nerve of the lumbar plexus by means of the ilio-inguinal nd ilio-hypogastric nerves. The main branches of these nerves run forwards etween this muscle and the transversalis abdominis, and give off their filaments 0 the internal surface of the muscle; some also are distributed to the muscle by he branches which perforate it in order to supply the external oblique. Action.—(1) The fibres of the muscle being curved tend to flatten upon their sontraction and so to compress the viscera contained within their concavity; hey will therefore help in defecation, micturition, parturition, and all expiratory efforts. (2) It will also assist expiration by drawing the lower ribs downwards. (3) *iVhen both muscles act together, they flex the thorax upon the pelvis. They will dso flex the lumbar and lower thoracic spine. (4) When the muscle of one side lets alone, or in conjunction with the obliquus externus of the other side, it will "otate the thorax to its own side. (5) The posterior fibres of the muscle will draw llown the side of the thorax ; it will therefore be a lateral flexor of the thorax and of the lumbar and lower dorsal spine. (6) Acting from the thorax, this muscleTHE MUSCLES 432 I will flex the pelvis, rotate it to the opposite side, and by means of its posterior fibres it will act as a lateral flexor of the pelvis. Relations.—Superficially, the external oblique and latissimus dorsi; deeply, the transversalis abdominis. Its lower margin lies for a short distance in front of the inguinal canal, containing the spermatic cord in the male, and the round ligament in the female. The conjoined tendon lies internally beneath these structures. The aponeurosis of the internal oblique is also in relation mth the rectus muscle, of which it forms the sheath in the upper three-fourths of its extent. Variations.—Sometimes the muscle is crossed close to its insertion upon the ribs by tendinous insertions, which probably represent ribs. Ceemaster The cremaster (fig. 285)—named from its action as a suspender of the testicle (Kp^jxaaT-qp a suspender, from Kpefxavw/xL to hang)—is really a detached part of the obliquus internus, forming with the fascia which connects its fibres a thin loop- | shaped band which in the male envelopes the lower part and front of the testicle ' and spermatic cord. In the female it is either entirely absent, or a few fibres upon the front of the round ligament take its place. Origin.—The upper and deep surface of Poupart's ligament about its middle point. Insertion.—(1) The spine, and crest of the pubic bone ; (2) the front of the, fascia propria or infundibuliform fascia, which envelopes the testicle and spermatic cord. Structure.—The fibres, which differ from all other muscles in their scattered and j separate character, spring fleshy from the concavity of Poupart's ligament on the, deep aspect of the aponeurosis of the obliquus externus, in continuation of the; origin of the obliquus internus. Three main divisions may be noted:—(1) A series of loops which pass from this origin at different heights in front of the cord and testicle, with their convexities directed downwards, and closely connected; with the fascia propria of the testicle ; finally, they collect into a narrow tendinous \ band, which is attached to the spine and crest of the pubes. (2) A group of; divergent fleshy fibres, which pass from the origin downwards and inwards to be lost upon the fascia propria. (3) A smaller group, which descend from the; tendinous insertion to be lost in a similar manner upon the front of the fascia propria. Between these fleshy fibres, which are often thin and difficult to recognise^ij there is a layer of connective tissue, called the cremasteric fascia, which unites! them and forms one of the coverings of the testicle and cord. Nerve-supply.—The genital branch of the genito-crural, from the first and second lumbar nerves, gives off numerous filaments which enter the muscle upoDj its deep and posterior aspect. | Action.—To raise the testicle, and draw it upv/ards towards the externa]! abdominal ring. This action is involuntary, and is usually of a reflex character; being readily excited by any irritation of the adjacent skin either of the scrotum oi thigh. Relations.—Superficially, the external oblique aponeurosis above, the inter- columnar fascia, dartos, and integuments below; deeply, the spermatic cord anc testicle with its fascia propria.433 TBANSVEBSALIS ABDOMINIS 3. TKANSVERSALIS ABDOMINIS * I The transversalis abdominis—named from the general direction of its fibres—is irregularly quadrilateral curved sheet, partly muscular, partly aponeurotic. ! Origin.—(1) The inner surface of the cartilages of the last six ribs, close to their [unction with the ribs, by teeth which interdigitate with the attachments of the jliaphragm; (2) the strong aponeurosis called the lumbar fascia, which arises (a) Fig. 304.—Transversalis Abdominis and Sheath of Eectus. -Serratus magnus Lumbar fascia ly its anterior layer from the front of the transverse processes of the five lumbar ertebrae, {b) by its middle layer from the tips of the transverse processes of the five iimbar vertebrae, (c) by its posterior layer from the general vertebral aponeurosis /hich is attached to the spines of the thoracic, lumbar, and sacral vertebrae ; (3) the nterior two-thirds of the inner lip of the crest of the ilium; (4) the outer third f Poupart's ligament. Insertion.—(1) the whole length of the linea alba; (2) the anterior border of he crest of the pubes ; (3) the inner end of the ilio-pectineal line for about one Qch and a half. Structure.—Arising by short tendinous intermixed with fleshy fibres, the muscle F F434 THE MUSCLES passes transversely forwards, diverging slightly to its insertion. The change from fleshy to aponeurotic fibres is in a curved line, the upper and lower extremities of which approach the linea alba more closely than in the central part of the muscle. In the upper part the fleshy fibres are overlapped in front by the rectus muscle; and at the lower border of the muscle where it terminates in a small arch, passing over the spermatic cord or round ligament, the fleshy fibres cease just above the middle of Poupart's ligament. The muscles of the two sides, joined as they are by the central aponeurosis, may be looked upon as a single muscle with a central aponeurosis, like the diaphragm; and a similar relation may be considered to hold good between the internal oblique muscle of one side and the external oblique of the other, each pair forming a double-bellied muscle joined by a median aponeurosis. In its upper three-fourths the anterior aponeurosis is closely blended with the posterior division of the aponeurosis of the internal oblique muscle, and forms the hinder part of the sheath of the rectus in this region. In the lower fourth the anterior aponeurosis is blended with the undivided aponeurosis of the internal! oblique, and passes in front of the rectus muscle and the pyramidalis. | The posterior aponeurosis, or lumbar fascia, consists of strong transverse fibres. | The middle layer is the strongest, and has in its substance fibrous bands passing outwards from the tips of the transverse processes of the lumbar vertebrae, and! continuing the series of the ribs connected with the dorsal transverse processes. Between this middle layer and the anterior layer which springs from the front of| the tips of the transverse processes is placed the quadratus lumborum; and a|. thickening of this anterior layer passing from the tips of the transverse processesj i of the first and second lumbar vertebrae to the lowest rib, called the ligamentum\ arcuatum externum, gives origin to a part of the diaphragm. Between the middlej |iic and posterior layers is placed the erector spinae muscle. This posterior layer; \k blends with the vertebral aponeurosis, and gives origin to the latissimus dorsi, the I it serratus posticus inferior, and other muscles. j :isi Nerve-supply.—The anterior primary branches of the lower thoracic nerves and| m the ilio-hypogastric and ilio-inguinal branches of the first nerve of the lumbar plexus, j 9 The nerves as they run forward between this muscle and the obliquus internum j id distribute filaments to its outer surface. Iti Action.—The muscles of the two sides with their intervening aponeuroses forn: a strong girth round the abdominal viscera, and by their contraction compress j most powerfully the contents of the abdomen. i It will thus be seen that the three layers of the transverse muscles in th(j abdominal wall cross one another at various angles, one pair passing transversel}! forwards, a second forwards and upwards, and a third forwards and down] iji, wards. The following objects are gained by this arrangement : (1) the wal^ 1^ is rendered much stronger, and the probability of a hernial protrusion of any portioij of the viscera between the separated fibres of the muscles is diminished ; (2) con j traction of the wall is permitted in every direction ; (3) greater approximation of thi movable boundaries of the abdominal wall is obtained by means of the obliquit;! of the muscles which affect this movement. For example, two parallel bones caij have the distance between them diminished only by one half, supposing that th muscular fibres producing this movement run perpendicularly from one bone to th | other ; but if the fibres cross one another obliquely, like those of the external an i internal oblique muscles, in passing from the crest of the ilium to the lower ribs, \ much more complete approximation of the bones is effected. i Relations.—Superficially, the obliquus internus, the cartilages of the low€j ribs, some small vessels, and the lower intercostal nerves ; above, it is continuom with the lower border of the triangularis sterni ; below, it lies above the spermati j cord or round ligament, and its conjoined tendon lies for a short distance beneat!QUADBATUS LUMBOBUM 435 lese structures ; deeply, the transversalis fascia which separates it from the jritoneum. The sheath of the rectus is formed by the aponeuroses of the three preceding ijiscles. That of the obhquus internus divides into an anterior and posterior ]rer. The anterior layer blended with the aponeurosis of the obliquus externus i-ms the front portion of the sheath. Above, it is attached to the cartilages of i3 fifth, sixth, and seventh ribs; and internally it blends with the posterior jrtion of the sheath along the linea alba. The posterior portion of the sheath is i-med by the posterior layer of the aponeurosis of the obliquus internus, which Jblended with the aponeurosis of the transversalis. Above, it is attached to the Iver edge of the cartilages of the seventh and eighth ribs, and to the ensiform ctilage. Internally it blends with the front portion of the sheath along the ilea alba. Bather nearer the umbilicus than the pubes, the posterior portion of 13 sheath becomes suddenly much thinner and weaker at the fold of Douglas, |ich is a transverse line indicating that the fibres of the abdominal aponeuroses lich have down to this level formed the posterior portion of the sheath, now pass t'its front wall. Below this level the posterior portion of the sheath is formed 1 a thickening of the transversalis fascia (page 436). i POSTEKIOR VERTICAL MUSCLE—QUADBATUS LUMBOBUM I The quadratus lumborum (fig. 286)—named from its approximately square £|ipe and its position in the region of the loins—is a thick quadrilateral sheet. : Origin.—(1) About two inches of the inner lip of the crest of the ilium at the j iction of its middle and posterior thirds ; (2) the ilio-lumbar ligament; (3) the t[S of the transverse processes of the three or four lower lumbar vertebrae. Insertion.—(1) The inner half of the lower border of the last rib ; (2) the tips (the transverse processes of the upper three or four lumbar vertebrae ; and (3) the lirous continuations which pass out from these transverse processes in the spstance of the middle portion of the lumbar fascia, and which represent the Eaominal ribs. I Structure.—This muscle varies considerably in its structure and arrangement, i| origins from and insertions into the transverse processes differing much in Eierent subjects. Its origin is usually by short tendinous intermixed with mus- Mar fibres, and extends at its lower part all along the ilio-lumbar ligament, and Ipind the attachment of this ligament from the inner lip of the crest of the ilium. Be fibres converge somewhat as they ascend; the outermost, passing upwards ii inwards to the middle point of the lower border of the last rib, while the iier fibres pass vertically upwards along the tips of the transverse processes Ii the lumbar vertebrae, from which they receive short tendons, and they some- Bies give tendinous slips to these processes. On the anterior and posterior ilfaces of the muscle are often seen ascending fibres from the transverse pro- Ises, which diverge slightly before they are inserted into the lower border of the I t rib. I Nerve-supply.—From the twelfth thoracic and upper lumbar nerves, by fila- i nts which enter the muscle upon its anterior surface near its inner border. I Action.—(1) It will draw downwards the last rib, and will therefore act as a 13ral flexor of the thorax as well as of the lower thoracic and the lumbar spine ; H it will assist in expiration by drawing down the last rib ; (3) taking its fixed I nt from the last rib, it will draw upwards the crest of the ilium, and so act as a i eral flexor of the pelvis upon the thorax. i Relations.—In front lie the kidney, the colon, the psoas, the lumbar arteries P i nerves, separated from it by the anterior layer of the lumbar fascia. Behind, I F F 2THE MUSCLES 436 the middle layer of the lumbar fascia se^Darates it from the erector spin^, and Along its inner border are placed the intertransversales. The transversalis fascia, which lines the interior of the muscular portion of the ahdominal parietes, is a thin layer of connective tissue. It is best marked in the lower part of the front of the abdomen, where some of the muscular and aponeurotic layers are deficient. Below, it is attached to the inner border of the whole length of the crest of the ilium, and to the outer half of Poupart's ligament, where it! blends with the iliac fascia covering the iliacus muscle. Beneath the inner half ofj Poupart's ligament it is somewhat thickened, and called the deep crural arch.j This is but loosely attached to Poupart's ligament, and the fascia is continued into' the thigh, where it forms the front of the sheath of the femoral vessels. Internally! to this it is attached to the free margin of Gimbernat's ligament, and behind to the ilio-pectineal line. Further inwards it is inserted along the posterior border of the! crest of the pubes. At the back of the linea alba it is continuous with the fascia] of the opposite side. Behind the lower part of the rectus muscle it is thickened,: and takes the place of the posterior portion of the sheath from the pubes to the fold of Douglas. Above, it becomes thin and blends with the fascia covering the under surface of the diaphragm; and behind, it is lost in the loose fat which coven the posterior surface of the kidneys, together with the back of the ascending an descending colon. About half an inch above the centre of Poupart's ligament it is perforated hj the spermatic cord in the male, and the round ligament in the female. To the margins of the opening, which is called the internal abdominal ring, is attached Jij tubular prolongation, the infundibuliform fascia, which invests the cord or round ligament. The connection of this tube to the rest of the fascia may be comparec' to the attachment of the sleeve to a coat. No opening is therefore visible from th exterior until the sleeve-like tube has been divided. i MUSCLES OF THE BACK The two first layers have already been described, as they belong to the groups ( muscles which pass from the thorax to the bones of the upper extremity. The thii layer consists of muscles which stretch in a nearly transverse direction from tl spinous processes of the vertebra to the back of the ribs, viz. the serratus postici, superior and the serratus posticus inferior. Third Layee 1. SERRATUS POSTICUS SUPERIOR The serratus posticus superior—named from its saw-like edge and its relati( to the other serrati—is a quadrilateral sheet with a toothed outer margin. Origin.—(1) The outer surface of the lower part of the ligamentum nuchas ne its posterior edge ; (2) the spines of the last cervical and first tAvo thoracic vertebr and the supraspinous ligaments connecting them. Insertion.—The upper borders and outer surfaces of the second to the fifth ri external to their angles. Structure.—The inner half is a tendinous sheet, the fibres of which run doFig. 305.—The Third and Fourth Layers of the Muscles of the Back.

I Action.—To raise the ribs into which it is inserted ; and therefore to assist inj inspiration. | Relations.—Superficially, the trapezius, levator anguli scapulae, rhomboideusj minor and major ; deeply, the vertebral aponeurosis which separates it from thei splenius and the more superficial spinal muscles ; farther outwards the musclej covers part of the external intercostals. j Variations.—The slips vary in mmiber. Sometimes it gives off a shp from its iippei! border or posterior surface which goes to the levator anguh scapulae, the mastoid process ! or the superior nuchal line. 2. SERRATUS POSTICUS INFERIOR The serratus posticus inferior—named also from its outer saw-like margin' and its position—is a quadrilateral sheet. \ Origin.—The spines of the two lower thoracic and tw^o upper lumbar vertebrae ■ Insertion.—The lower borders of the last four or five ribs external to theil angles, except in the case of the last rib which has no angle ; and as far forwardi" as the costal origins of the latissimus dorsi. Structure. —More than half of the muscle is aponeurosis, which is blended witlj that of the latissimus dorsi behind, and of the erector spinae in front, and forms i\ part of the vertebral aponeurosis, which blends with the posterior layer of th( lumbar fascia. The fleshy fibres are directed upwards and outAvards from thi;, aponeurosis, arising in an obhque line which is nearer the spine above than belo-w and inserted directly or with small tendinous attachments into the ribs. Ead; succeeding tooth slightly overlaps, and extends farther forwards than the om below. The middle teeth are the largest. Nerve-supply.—Filaments from the tenth and eleventh intercostals which ente the deep surface of the outer part of the muscle. Action.—(1) To depress the lower ribs ; (2) to fix them, so as to enable th ; diaphragm to contract. It is therefore in this respect a muscle of inspiration. j Relations.—Superficially, the latissimus dorsi; deeply, the erector spin^ with it upward continuations, also the levatores costarum, and the external intercostai muscles. i GENEEAL AERANGEMENT OF THE MUSCLES ACTING UPON THE SPINAL COLUMN THE VERTEBRAL APONEUROSIS Beneath the serrati postici are arranged what may be called the muscles of th back proper, viz. those which move the vertebral column and act chiefly upon th spines and transverse processes of the vertebrae and the parts of the skull whic. are serially continuous with them. They lie for the most part in the groove o either side of the spines of the vertebrae, and they are bound down and protecte by the strong vertebral aponeurosis which is blended below with the tendinouj origin of the latissimus dorsi, the serratus posticus inferior, and the erector spina Laterally, it is attached to the angles of the ribs. Above, it passes beneath tb tendon of the serratus posticus inferior, and is then lost in the thin fascia coverin the splenii. Iserl He: 1!, hct ads J439 SPLENIUS CAPITIS The back muscles proper may be arranged according to their direction into 3W0 great divisions, each of which contains two classes. The vertical division 3onsists of muscles which run between similar points of bone, and its two classes will contain the spinales, which connect the spines of the vertebra to one another md to the mesial portion of the occipital bone ; the transversales, which connect jhe transverse processes of the sacral and lumbar regions with the transverse orocesses and the adjacent portions of the ribs in the thoracic region, the articular md transverse processes in the cervical region, and the mastoid process at the iipper end of the spinal column. The oblique division consists of muscles which run obliquely, and contains two classes: the spino-transversales, which run upwards and outwards from spine to transverse process, or to a point of bone jwhich corresponds to a transverse process, e.g. the mastoid process; and the \iTansverso-sjpi7iales, which run upwards and inwards from transverse process to 3pine. The action of these muscles will be easily ascertained by observing to which blass they belong. The spinales will simply extend, w^hile the transversales will produce lateral flexion as well as extension. The oblique, in addition to 3xtension and lateral -flexion, will also produce rotation wherever the ligaments ja-nd processes of the vertebrae permit of this movement. I I Fourth Layer j The fourth layer of the muscles of the back consists of two muscles, which are closely connected with each other, and belong to the spino-transver sails class of [the oblique division. 1 AND 2. SPLENIUS The splenitis (fig. 305)—named from Q-irXrjviov a bandage, probably on account of the way in which it crosses over and binds down the complexus and other juiuscles—is a broad four-sided sheet, divided into two parts at its insertion : the one part being the splenius capitis, and the other the splenins colli. (1) Splenius Capitis Origin.—(1) The lower two-thirds of the ligamentum nuchse ; (2) the spines of the seventh cervical and upper two thoracic vertebrae, and the interspinous ligaments between them. Insertion.—The outer third of the middle nuchal line of the occipital bone, md the back part of the outer surface of the mastoid process of the temporal bone. Structure.—^Arising by a short tendinous aponeurosis, the fleshy fibres pass upwards and outwards parallel to each other, and are inserted by short tendinous fibres, except along the anterior border, where the tendon of insertion extends more than an inch downwards. Nerve-supply.—The external branches of the posterior primary divisions of [the middle cervical nerves which enter the outer part of the deep surface of the [muscle. Action.—(1) To extend the head and neck; (2) to flex them laterally ; (3) to rotate the face to the same side.THE MUSCLES 440 (2) Splenius Colll Origin.—The spines of the third to the sixth thoracic vertebrae, and the inter- spinons hgaments between them. Insertion.—The back of the posterior tubercles of the transverse processes of the three or four upper cervical vertebrae. Structure.—Of parallel fleshy fibres with a short aponeurotic origin, and inserted by small tendons, the highest of which is the largest. Nerve-supply.—The external branches of the posterior divisions of the lower cervical nerves. Action.—(1) To extend the upper part of the neck ; (2) to flex it laterally; (3) to rotate it to the same side. Relations of the splenius.—Superficially, the sterno-mastoid, trapezius, ser- ratus posticus superior, and the levator anguli scapulae which conceals the splenius colli in the posterior triangle of the neck. Beneath lie the complexus, trachelo- mastoid, cervicalis ascendens, and transversalis colli. Variations.—The number of the thoracic vertebras from which the splenii arise varies. The splenius colli ma^' be absent. The slip mentioned in the variations of the serratus posticus superior may be considered to be a variation of the splenii. Fifth Layer The fifth layer consists of vertical muscles, and contains both spinales and transversales. To the latter class belongs the greater part of the erector spinas and the seven muscles which either spring from it or are serially continuous with it: viz. the ilio-costalis, accessorius ad ilio-costalem, cervicalis ascendens, longissimus dorsi, transversalis colli, trachelo-mastoid, and the spinalis dorsi. 1. ERECTOR SPIN^ The erector spinse—named from its function—is a broad and very strong membranous sheet of a triangular shape, with a layer of fleshy fibres upon its deep surface ; and it divides in the lumbar region into three longitudinal series of muscles which fill the greater part of the vertebral groove. Origin.—(1) The spines of the two last thoracic, all the lumbar, and the four upper sacral vertebrae ; (2) the back of the side portion of the fourth sacral vertebra ; (3) the posterior sacro-iliac ligaments, a few of these fibres being continuous with the origin of the gluteus maximus ; (4) the upper part of the posterior superior spine of the ilium, and the posterior fifth of the iliac crest. Insertion.—It is continuous with the spinalis dorsi, longissimus dorsi, and ilio-costalis. Structure.—A strong membranous sheet, everywhere continuous except at the origin from the lower thoracic and upper lumbar spines, where it is partly divided into separate tendons. It breaks up into fleshy fibres in a line which stretches obliquely upwards and inwards from the front of the iliac origin to the last thoracic spines. Fleshy fibres also arise upon its deeper surface at a lower level, and some arise directly from the posterior superior iliac spine and the crest under cover of the tendinous origin. Nerve-supply.—The external branches of the posterior divisions of the lumbar nerves which enter its deep surface.ILIO-GOSTALIS—GEBVIGALIS ASGENDENS 441 Action.—Generally, that of extension of the lumbar spine on the pelvis ; but a full account will be given with the description of the succeeding muscles. Relations.—Superficially, the vertebral aponeurosis, with which it is blended at its origin and for the first two inches of its course. With this aponeurosis it therefore enters into a close relation with the lower part of the tendons of the iatissimus dorsi and serratus posticus inferior. Deeply, the multifidus spinae, 3ome of the fibres of which arise from it. The outer division extends upwards along the angles of the ribs and the trans- /erse processes of the lower cervical vertebras, and consists of the ilio-costalis, iccessorius ad ilio-costalem, and the cervicalis ascendens. It is separated from ihe middle division by the external branches of the posterior divisions of the spinal lierves. Outer Division 2. ILIO-COSTALIS The ilio-costalis, or sacro-lumbalis—named from its attachment to the ilium jud ribs—is an elongated muscular sheet, with a serrated outer border formed by [he insertion of its tendons into the lower ribs, i Origin.—The outer portion of the erector spinae. Insertion.—(1) The angles of all the ribs from the sixth to the eleventh ; 2) the lower border of the last rib ; (3) the tips of the transverse processes of the lumbar vertebrae, and the fibrous processes which extend outwards from the tips of jhe transverse processes of the upper lumbar vertebrae into the lumbar fascia. 3. ACCESSORIUS AD ILIO-COSTALEM The accessorius ad ilio-costalem or ad sacro-lumbalem—named from its being ,n accessory or addition to the ilio-costalis—is a narrow musculo-tendinous band 7ith a serrated margin on either side. Origin.—The upper border of the angles of the seventh to the eleventh ribs and he back of the last rib. [ Insertion.—The back of the transverse process of the seventh cervical vertebra, he first rib just external to its tubercle, and the angles of the second to the fifth ibs. 4. CERVICALIS ASCENDENS [ The cervicalis ascendens—named from its position in the neck and its irection—is a still thinner musculo-tendinous band with serrated margins, i Origin.—The back of the four or five upper ribs just internal to the insertion if the preceding muscle. ( Insertion.—The back of the transverse processes of the fourth, fifth, and sixth jervical vertebrae. ; Structure.—'These three sections form a compound muscle, composed for the jiost part of fusiform bellies with tendinous origins and insertions, placed in series so |iat the origins of the higher slips are on a level with the insertions of those that jrise six or seven vertebrae or ribs lower down. The lowest of the series arise lirectly from the muscular mass of the erector spinae ; and the insertions of these j)wer shps, especially those into the lumbar fascia and last rib, are fleshy. A part jf the tendinous origin of the slips of muscle is so closely blended that a completeFig. 306.—The Fifth Layer of the Muscles of the Back. 442 THE MUSCLES separation of the muscle into its component parts is impossible. There is a gradual diminution of the size of each component muscle and its tendons as we trace the compound mass upwards.443 LONGISSIMUS DOBSI—TBACHELO-MASTOID Nerve-supply.—The external branches of the posterior divisions of the spinal nerves from the lower cervical nerves to the last thoracic. Action.—(1) To extend the vertebral column, in the lower cervical, thoracic, and upper lumbar regions ; (2) to flex it laterally in these regions ; (3) to depress the ribs, and so help in expiration. Relations.—Superficially, the trapezius, rhomboidei, latissimus dorsi, the ser- ratus posticus superior and inferior, and the two splenii; deeply, the intercostal muscles and the levatores costarum ; internally, the muscles of the middle division, and the external divisions of the posterior spinal nerves. Middle Division j The middle division extends along the back of the transverse processes of the lumbar and thoracic vertebrae, the articular processes, and adjacent part of the transverse processes of the cervical vertebrae, and ends at the mastoid process of the temporal bone. It consists of the longissimus dorsi, transversalis colli, and trachelo-mastoid. j 5. LONGISSIMUS DORSI The longissimus dorsi—named from its great length and its position in the dorsal region—is a compound muscle forming a long band, with its surfaces directed outwards and inwards, and an anterior margin provided with an outer and inner row of teeth by which it is inserted. I Origin.—(1) The middle part of the erector spinas; and (2) the transverse processes of some of the lower thoracic vertebrae. Insertion.—Externally: (1) the low^er border of the back of the transverse pro- cesses of the upper lumbar vertebrae ; (2) the lower border of the ribs just external to their tubercles. Internally : (1) The accessory tubercles of the upper lumbar and lower thoracic vertebras; and (2) the back of the transverse processes of the rest of the thoracic vertebrae. 6. TRANSVEESALIS COLLI The transversalis colli—named from its attachment to the transverse pro- cesses and its insertion in the neck—is a similar but narrower musculo-tendinous band. Origin.—The back of the transverse processes of the five or six upper thoracic vertebra, internal to the insertion of the preceding muscle. Insertion.—The posterior tubercles of the transverse processes of the second to the sixth cervical vertebra. 7. TRACHELO-MASTOID The trachelo-mastoid—named from its origin, part of which is in the neck (TpdxrjXos), and its insertion upon the mastoid process—is a similar but smaller musculo-tendinous band. Origin.—(1) The back of the articular processes of the lower three or four cervical vertebrae ; (2) the back of the transverse processes of the four or five upper thoracic vertebra. Insertion.—The posterior border of the mastoid process.THE MUSCLES 444 Structure of the middle division.—The three parts of this division have a close connection with one another, and a long tendinous expansion which covers the inner and back part of the longissimus dorsi is common to it and the spinalis dorsi.

All the upper elements of this long compound muscle have tendinous origins and insertions. The trachelo-mastoid portion is often found to have a tendinous intersection crossing its fleshy fibres. Nerve-supply.—The external divisions of the posterior branches of the lower cervical, all the thoracic, and the upper lumbar nerves. Action.—(1) To extend the cervical, thoracic, and lumbar spine ; (2) to flex it laterally ; (3) to extend and laterally flex the head, rotating the face to the same side. Relations.—Superficially, it is covered by the latissimus dorsi, trapezius, rhom- boidei, serratus posticus inferior and superior, and the two splenii; upon its inner border lie the spinalis dorsi and complexus. Upon its outer lie the muscles of the outer division and the external divisions of the posterior branches of the spinal nerves. Beneath lie the multifidus spin« and the semispinalis dorsi et colli. Inner Division The inner division consists usually of a single muscle, the spinalis dorsi; but sometimes a small muscle, the spinalis colli, continues the series into the neck. 8. SPINALIS DOESI The spinalis dorsi—named from its attachment to the spines in the dorsal region—is a musculo-tendinous band closely connected below with the aponeurosis on the back of the longissimus dorsi. Origin.—The erector spinffi, and especially that part which is attached to the two or three lower thoracic and the upper lumbar spines. Insertion.—The spines of the upper thoracic vertebrae. Structure.—Upon its posterior surface it is covered by a thick aponeurosis, from the upper edge and anterior surface of which fleshy fibres pass almost directly upwards, and are then inserted by means of four to eight tendons into as many of the upper thoracic spines. They are closely blended with the tendons of the semi- spinalis dorsi at their insertion. Nerve-supply.—The posterior branches of the thoracic nerves. Action.—To extend the thoracic spine. Relations.—Superficially, the two serrati postici, the latissimus dorsi, the rhomboidei and splenii; externally, the longissimus dorsi; deeply, the semispinalis dorsi and complexus. Variations of the erector spinae and its divisions.—The number of ribs or vertebrae from which the various parts of these divisions arise, or into which they are inserted, varies much. The insertions upon the lumbar vertebrae are often less numerous than those described. Occasionally the longissimus dorsi receives accessory fibres fi''om the lower ribs. Sometimes the portion of the longissimus dorsi, which arises from the transverse processes of the lower thoracic vertebrae, is separate from the rest of the muscle, and is inserted into the transverse processes of some of the upper thoracic vertebrae.446 THE MUSCLES Sixth Layer The sixth layer, or rather group, consists of four strata of oblique muscles belonging to the class of transverso-spinales ; the deepest layer being formed by a series of small muscles which run upwards and inwards from the back of one vertebra to that of the next above it; while the other layers run in the same direction but less obliquely, so as to cross over the backs of several vertebrae before reaching their insertion. 1. COMPLEXUS The complexus, or semispinalis capitis (fig. 306)—named from the complex or complicated arrangement of the muscular bundles which were formerly included under this designation, viz. the complexus, trachelo-mastoid, &c.—is a musculo- tendinous band somewhat constricted about its middle. Origin.—(1) The back of the articular processes of the cervical vertebrae from the third to the sixth ; (2) the back of the transverse processes of the seventh cervical and the six upper thoracic vertebrae ; (3) generally also by an inner head from the spine of the seventh cervical vertebra. Insertion.—The under surface of the occipital bone between the middle and inferior nuchal lines from the middle line for nearly two inches outwards. Structure.—Arising by tendinous slips, the fleshy fibres pass upwards and slightly inwards, and are inserted either directly into the occiput or by a short aponeurosis which covers the thick part of the muscle near its outer border. On their way, the innermost fibres are intersected by a transverse tendinous band opposite the sixth cervical spine, and this part of the muscle, being thus divided, is often called the biventer cervicis. There is usually also a smaller tendinous intersection higher up across the posterior surface of the muscle. Nerve-supply.—From the suboccipital, great occipital, and the internal divisions of the posterior branches of the three or four following cervical nerves which enter the deep surface of the muscle. Action.—To extend the head, to flex it laterally, and to rotate the face slightly to the opposite side. Relations.—It is covered by the trapezius and the two splenii, and it lies upon the muscles of the suboccipital triangle and the semispinalis colli, the vertebral artery and the anastomosis between the arteria princeps cervicis and the arteria profunda cervicis. It is pierced by the great occipital nerve. Internally, it lies close to the ligamentum nuchae; and externally, to the trachelo-mastoid and transversalis colli. Variations.—The inner head may arise from several of the thoracic spines as well as that of the seventh cervical vertebra. Sometimes a second and smaller complexus runs, beneath the normal muscle from the upper thoracic vertebrae to the head. 2. SEMISPINALIS DOESI The semispinalis dorsi—named from the fact that the inner half only of the muscle, i.e. its insertion, is attached to the spines of the vertebrae, and from its situation in the dorsal region—is a rather feeble compound muscle, consisting of a series of small muscles with tendinous extremities. Origin.—The back of the transverse processes of the sixth to the tenth thoracic vertebrae. Insertion.—The spines of the last two cervical, and first four thoracic vertebras-SEMISPINALIS DOBSI 447 Structure.—Arising by long slender tendons, the fleshy fibres form a thin sheet ivhich runs upwards and inwards, and then breaks up again into short tendons of nsertion. Each muscle bridges over six or seven vertebrae. Fig. 308.—^The Sixth Layer of the Muscles of the Back. }ieus minor448 THE MUSCLES Nerve-supply.—The internal divisions of the posterior branches of the thoracic spinal nerves. Action.—To extend and laterally flex the lower cervical and upper thoracic spines. The uppermost tendons will also assist in rotating the lower part of the neck to the opposite side. Relations.—Superficially, the spinalis and longissimus dorsi; deeply, the multi- fidus spinse. 3. SEMISPINALIS COLLI The semispinalis colli—named from the attachment of one half the muscle, i.e. the insertion, to the spines of the cervical vertebrae—is a somewhat triangular sheet, with a serrated base placed vertically along the transverse processes, and the apex at the spine of the second cervical vertebra. Origin.—The back of the transverse processes of the five or six upper thoracic vertebrae. Insertion.—The spines of the second to the fifth cervical vertebrae. Structure.—Arising by short tendons, the fleshy fibres pass upwards and inwards, bridging over in their course five or six vertebrae, and are inserted by still shorter tendons into the spines of the cervical vertebrae. The highest is by far the largest. Nerve-supply.—The internal divisions of the posterior branches of the lower cervical nerves, the upper ones entering the muscle on its superficial, and the lower on its deep aspect. Action.—(1) To extend; (2) to flex laterally ; (3) to rotate to the opposite side, the second and following cervical vertebrae. Relations.—Superficially, the complexus, from which it is separated by branches of the posterior cervical nerves and the anastomosis of the arteria profunda cervicis with the arteria princeps cervicis ; deeply, the multifidus spinae. j 4. MULTIFIDUS SPIN^ The multifidus spinae—named from its many divisions {miiltus, many ; findx), \ to cleave)—is a compound muscle, fleshy and thick in the sacral and lumbar regions, i but becoming thin and more aponeurotic in the thoracic and cervical regions. | Origin.—(1) The groove in the back of the sacrum, between the spines and the j elevations which represent articular processes, the posterior sacro-iliac ligaments, | and the deep surface of the tendon of the erector spinae ; (2) the mammillary processes of the lumbar vertebrae ; (3) the back of the transverse processes of all the ; thoracic vertebrae ; (4) the articular processes of the fourth to the sixth cervical | vertebrae, and the back of the transverse process of the seventh cervical vertebra. | Insertion.—The lower borders of the spines of the vertebrae from the last ] lumbar to the second cervical. I Structure.—Arising by tendinous fibres superficially, but by fleshy fibres deeply,. the bundles of each element of the muscle diverge, the more superficial ones running obliquely upwards and inwards so as to bridge three vertebrae, while the deeper ones pass more transversely to the third, second, and in t£ie neck, the next vertebra above. Consequently, the more superficial fibres from one vertebra overlap the deeper ones from some of the vertebrae above. Nerve-supply.—The internal divisions of the posterior branches of the spinal; nerves from the second cervical to the third sacral. Action.—To extend, laterally flex, and to rotate to the opposite side, the: various parts of the spinal column. Relations.—Superficially, the erector spinae, longissimus and spinalis dorsi, the semispinalis dorsi and colli; deeply, the rotatores spinas. 1 It449 BOTATOBES SPIN^—INTEBSPINALES 5. EOTATORES SPIN^ The rotatores spinae—named from the rotatory action which they impress upon he spine—are small rhomboidal sheets, chiefly found in the thoracic region, where hey form a series of eleven pairs, but occasionally found also in the upper lumbar md the lower cervical regions. Origin.—The back and upper border of the transverse process. Insertion.—The lower border of the lamina of the next vertebra above. Structure.—Sheets of parallel fibres, almost entirely fleshy, which run upwards ,nd inwards. Nerve-supply.—The internal divisions of the posterior primary branches. Action.—To rotate to the opposite side, and also to extend and laterally flex, he vertebra which receives its insertion. ! Relations.—Superficially, the multifidus spin^e ; deeply, the ligamenta subflava. The seventh group consists of short vertical muscles, the interspinales and itertransversales, which lie on a deep plane internal and external to the transverso- ipinales, and under cover of the longer vertical muscles which form the fifth layer f the back. The interspinales—named from their position—are small ribbon-like muscles 'hich run vertically between the spines, especially in the cervical and lumbar h.gions. Origin.—The upper surface of the spine of the vertebra, near its tip. Insertion.—The posterior part of the lower surface of the spine of the vertebra I Structure.—In the neck the bundles are attached to the two parts of the bifid l^tremities of the spines from the axis downwards. In the lumbar region they )rm broader bands attached to the whole length of the spines, and separated by |ie interspinous ligaments. Nerve-supply.—The internal divisions of the posterior branches of the spinal Brves. Action.—To extend the vertebra next above. I Relations.—Behind, the spinales and complexus ; internally, the interspinous Ig'aments ; externally, the multifidus spinas. Variations.—Occasionall}^ they pass over one spine to be inserted upon the next but 16. The spinalis colli, when it occurs, may be looked upon as a still greater extension of lis variation. The intertransversales—named from their position between the transverse 'ocesses—are small vertical bands, also found chiefly in the cervical and lumbar gions. In the neck they are double, the anterior band connecting the anterior tubercles the transverse processes of the cervical vertebrae, and the posterior the posterior bercles. In the lumbar region they are also double, an outer set connecting the adjacent Seventh Layer 1. INTERSPINALES 2. INTERTRANSVERSALES G G450 THE MUSCLES surfaces of the ends of the transverse processes, and an inner connecting the accessory tubercle of one vertebra to the mammillary tubercle of the next vertebra below.

They are hidden from view by the mass of muscles attached to the transverse processes. In' the lumbar region they lie under cover of the erector spinaB and its divisions, andl they are covered in front by the psoas (fig. 286). i THE SUBOCCIPITAL MUSCLES The suboccipital group consists of short muscles, situated in the same plane af the preceding, but somewhat altered in their arrangement on account of the peculiar movements of the region. They are the rectus capitis posticus major ancj Ijj minor, the obliquus capitis inferior and superior, the rectus capitis lateralis. j y ililli tet I \m The rectus capitis posticus major (fig. 308)—somewhat incorrectly named fron^ a the direction of its fibres, its position, and size—is a triangular sheet. i Origin.—The upper surface of the spine of the axis along its side and one hal' Uatii of its bifid tip. \ Insertion.—The middle third of the inferior nuchal line of the occipital bone.

Insertion.—The lower part of the tip of the transverse process of the atlas. Structure.—Strong and fleshy, with pointed extremities, and a general direction ^wards and outwards. Nerve-supply.—The suboccipital, which sends branches to its upper border. Action.—Chiefly to rotate the atlas, and with it the head, to the same side. It ill also help in extension and lateral flexion of the atlas upon the axis. Relations.—Behind, the complexus and the great occipital nerve, which winds mnd its lower border ; in front, the posterior atlanto-axial ligament and vertebral :tery. 4.

I Relations.—In front, the anterior primary branch of the first cervical nerve, and I internal jugular vein ; behind, the obliquus superior and the trachelo-mastoid. j Variations.—Occasionally the short muscles of this group are double. Small slips of nscle have been observed, running from the spines of the lower cervical vertebrse, or the Umentum nuchse to the occipital bone. GG 2THE MUSCLES 452 MUSCLES OF THE HEAD AND NECK The superficial layer in this region is peculiar in that it consists of numeroii muscles contained in the connective tissue outside the deep fascia. This connectiv tissue, the superficial fascia, is moderately provided with fat, and extends wither any deep connection to the adjacent regions of the thorax, arm, and back. In th! scalp it is firm and difficult to dissect on account of numerous septa which pa^; through it to unite the skin to the subjacent muscular aponeurosis. In th; situatior the superficial fascia is richly provided with blood by vessels which xw within il' Instead of beneath the deep fascia, Avhich is their usual position in oth(; parts of fche body. Besid(3s the peculiarity of their position outside the deep fascia, these muscLl are all associated in their function, viz. to produce the various movements of tl| features by which the expression of the emotions is effected. They are aL peculiar in the fact that many of them decussate with each other on the way • their insertion in the skin ; and they are all supplied by the seventh pair > cranial nerves. i SUPERFICIAL MUSCLES OF NECK AND SCALP 1. PLATYSMA MYOIDES mi ■itila The platysma myoides—named from its flat expanse (ylatysma, a plate) ai' its similarity to muscle {myoides, like muscle, for the older anatomists consider it to be only a membrane)—is a quadrilateral sheet with a somewhat tooth posterior border. Orig^in.—(1) The deep fascia of the upper part of the front of the chest ai the shoulder, and the deep cervical fascia covering the sterno-mastoid. . \ Insertion.—(1) The outer surface of the lower border of the body of t mandible, both on the same and the opposite side ; (2) the deep surface of the si from the corner of the mouth to the anterior border of the masseter muscle Structure.—Arising by slender bundles from the fascia covering the pector^ major and deltoid, in a line from the second costal cartilage to the tip of acromial process, the pale muscular fibres at first converge slightly until tt have crossed the clavicle. They then run parallel to each other upwards a forwards, receiving at the posterior border of the muscle small teeth from the d( fascia forming the sheath of the sterno-mastoid. The anterior fibres cross 1 middle line half-way between the hyoid bone and the symphysis, and are inser into the lower border of the body of the mandible upon the opposite side of ' neck. The greater part of the rest are inserted into the outer surface of the lo^ border of the mandible on the same side, but some are continued upwards and j with the depressor labii inferioris. Still further back, a few fibres pass upwa over the lower part of the masseter, and are inserted into the deep surface of skin just outside the angle of the mouth. A strong bundle of these fibres which n nearly transversely forwards to the corner of the mouth will be described later the risorius muscle. In its whole extent the muscle is closely connected with deep surface of the skin. Nerve-supply.—The seventh cranial nerve, by means of the inframaxillj)^, ^ branch of the cervico-facial division, which supplies it from beneath at a poink" *^«iiof little below the angle of the mandible. I '^h Action.—(1) To draw downwards and outwards the lower lip, by means of isconi e #arii453 PLATYSMA MYOIDES )res which are continued upwards into the depressor labii inferioris. In trans- rse wounds below the mandible, the division of this muscle often impairs this ovement. Duchenne has shown how important a part this depression of the vver lip discharges in the expression of horror or extreme surprise. (2) To draw twards the soft parts of the side of the neck, so as to diminish pressure upon the ins during strong inspiratory efforts. As the muscle is arched in its passage )m the clavicle to the mandible, with the concavity directed outwards, it is plain Fig. 309.—The Superficial Muscles of the Head and Neck. Epicranial aponeurosis Attollens aurem Attraliens aurem Occipitalis Hetrahens aurem Sterno-mastoid t]t its contraction will flatten the arch and[tend to hft the skin and fasciae off the Vjsels, in exactly the opposite manner to that by which pressure is exerted when tl' concavity is upon the deep surface of a muscle. (3) It may assist feebly in ' ression of the mandible ; and, if that be fixed, in flexion of the head and rotation 'ards the same side. This muscle covers all the front of the neck with the eption of a narrow triangular interval, the base of which is formed by the upper der of the sternum and the adjacent sterno-clavicular joints. Relations.—It lies immediately beneath the skin and superficial fascia, and in454 THE MUSCLES a lean neck the bundles are often distinctly visible through the skin, especiall when an effort is made to depress the lower lip while the teeth are clenchec A thin band derived from the anterior part of the depressor anguli oris usuallj crosses it superficially beneath the chin (page 465). Upon its deep surface lii the deep cervical fascia, the external jugular vein, the glandulse concatenat^e of tb| neck, the parotid and submaxillary glands, and the superficial branches of th' cervical plexus, together with the masseter, and buccinator, the muscles of th front and side of the neck, and the pectoralis major and deltoid. Its anteric border lies externally to the sterno-clavicular joint, and is often conspicuous i the aged, in whom the two muscles may be seen to hang, like a dewlap, beneat the chin, and then to divide into the two separate folds formed by their intern; borders, which run outwards and downwards towards the clavicles. Variations.—The anterior border of the muscle may be placed as far backwards as tl middle of the clavicle, and in some cases the muscle has been entirely absent. Slips ha^ been seen going to the side of the thjToid cartilage, the amncle or the mastoid process, i 2. OCCIPITO-FRONTALIS The occipito-frontalis—named from its two muscular bellies, which covl parts of the occipital and frontal bones—consists of two curved muscular shee; united by a strong aponeurosis, and is best described in three parts—viz. t| occipitalis and frontalis muscles and the epicranial aponeurosis. j (1) The occipitalis is a small quadrilateral sheet. Origin.—(1) The outer two-thirds of the superior nuchal line of the occipifl bone, and (2) a ridge upon the mastoid process. Insertion.—The posterior border of the epicranial aponeurosis, about one in; and a half above the superior nuchal line of the occipital bone. ' (2) The frontalis—a curved sheet of somewhat quadrilateral shape, with convex upper, and a concave lower border. Origin.—The epicranial aponeurosis, about half-way between the coroi suture and the orbital arch. Insertion.—The deep surface of the skin of the eyebrow and of that wh: occupies the space at the root of the nose between the eyebrow and the mid b line. 1 (3) The epicranial aponeurosis forms the central tendon of the occipij- frontalis, and its attachments will be described with the structure of the mus(j. Structure.—The occipitalis is thin and pale, and arises by short tendinous int> mingled with muscular fibres, and, after passing in parallel lines for about one ii i and a half upwards, it is inserted into the epicranial aponeurosis, a strong cur& sheet, which occupies the whole of the surface of the skull from the superior nuc lines behind to the eyebrows in front, and is continued laterally over the tempc fascia of either side to about the level of the external auditory meatus. Above, i tendinous, and composed of fibres which run from behind forwards. It is thin front and behind, where it forms a sort of sheath to the occipitalis and front muscles ; but near the median line behind it is thick where it fills up the intei between the occipitales. Laterally, it becomes very thin, and is lost in the Icje connective tissue superficial to the temporal fascia, after having supplied their ori n to the attrahens and attollens aurem muscles. In front, a narrow triangular i\h with the base upwards and the apex between the eyebrows, is left between |e frontales, which are larger and somewhat thicker than the occipitales. The fills of the frontales run in parallel bundles downwards and slightly inwards, and p lost in the subcutaneous fat of the eyebrows; while near the middle line a si slip is continued upon the bridge of the nose as the ])i)ramidalis, after enteiOCCIPITO-FBONTALIS—OBBICULABIS BALPEBBABUM 455 linto close relation with the deep surface of the skin at the junction of the forehead and nose. Nerve-supply.—The occipitalis receives one of the divisions of the post-auricular branch from the facial or seventh cranial nerve. Its filaments enter the deep surface of the muscle close to the outer border. The frontalis is supplied by the temporal branch of the temporo-facial division 3f the facial nerve which is distributed to the deep surface near its outer border. Action.—The occipitalis draws back the epicranial aponeurosis, and with it the 3calp, which is intimately attached to its outer surface. Acting from behind, the I'rontalis raises the eyebrow. If these are fixed by the contraction of the orbicularis Dalpebrarum, the frontalis will draw forwards the epicranial aponeurosis and scalp. When both occipitales and frontales contract, they raise the eyebrows to the utmost 3xtent, and throw the skin of the forehead into transverse wrinkles, as in the Expression of surprise or horror. At the same time, on account of the direction of ihe hair-bulbs, which lie with a forward slant behind and a backward slant in front, ihere will be a simultaneous tendency to lift the hair shafts, and to make them stand on end, like quills upon the fretful porcupine.' When the frontalis alone contracts, taking its fixed point from above, a slight levation of the eyebrow is produced, as in the expression of attention. This is Iso accompanied by a transverse wrinkling of the forehead. Relations.—Superficially, the epicranial aponeurosis and its muscles are in very lose connection with the skin of the scalp and forehead, being only separated from t by granular fat which is contained in small compartments formed by fibrous epta extending from the aponeurosis to the deep surface of the skin. In the at lie the hair-bulbs and blood-vessels of the scalp. Beneath, it is separated from ' e pericranium and temporal fascia by very loose connective tissue. Variations.—The occipitalis may be continuous with the retrahens aurem. The fron- alis may have insertions into the external or internal angle of the frontal bone, the nasal rocess of the maxilla, or the nasal bone. THE MUSCLES OF THE EYELIDS AND EYEBEOWS These are four in number—viz. the orbicularis palpebrarum, the tensor tarsi, e corrugator supercilii, and the levator palpebrse superioris. To these may be ded a fifth, the frontalis, which has been described. The levator palpebrae uperioris will be described with the orbital muscles. The only part of it which is 'sible in a dissection of the face is its broad expansion, which is intimately blended ith the front of the crescentic plate of condensed fibrous tissue called the upper rsal cartilage. 1. ORBICULAKIS PALPEBRARUM The orbicularis palpebrarum—named from the rounded shape of the majority f its fibres (orbiculus, a little circle) and its relation to the eyelids—is an oval eet with a long transverse diameter and so curved as to fit the i^rominences and epressions of the eyelids and the margin of the orbit. It consists of a marginal and a central division : the former stronger and called he orbital portion ; the latter thin and pale, and called the palbehral portion, oth have attachments to the tarsal ligaments, by which the so-called tarsal artilages are fastened to the margins of the orbit. The internal tarsal ligament, r tendo oculi, is a strong flat band of fibrous tissue about a sixth of an inch long 'th surfaces which look upwards and downwards. It arises from a projection uponTHE MUSCLES 456 the crest of the nasal process of the maxilla, and passes transversely outwards am somewhat upwards in front of the lachrymal sac, to which it gives off' an aponeuroti covering. It then bifurcates into an upper and a lower division, which diverge t be attached to the inner extremities of the tarsi, here separated by the caruncul lachrymal is. The external tarsal ligament is undivided ; it passes from the margi: of the frontal process of the malar bone transversely inwards to the extremitie of the tarsi, which at the outer commissure of the eyelids are in close contact. The orbital portion of the orbicularis palpebrarum consists of a series of con centric oval loops which are attached only at the inner side of the orbit. Origin and insertion.—(1) The lower part of the internal angular process c the frontal bone ; (2) the posterior half of the outer surface of the nasal proces of the maxilla ; (3) the upper and lower surfaces of the inner half of the interuE tarsal ligament. The palpebral portion consists of paler and shorter semielliptical fibres. Origin.—The upper and lower surfaces of the outer half of the internal tarsE ligament, together with the adjacent part of the aponeurosis covering the lachryme sac. Insertion.—The upper and lower surfaces of the external tarsal ligament. Structure.—Both portions of the muscle are entirely composed of fleshy fibrei In addition to the origin of the orbital portion at the inner part of the orbit, i gives off processes from its circumference which blend with the adjacent muscle such as the frontalis and the elevator of the upper lip. Moreover, some of tbl deeper fibres of the muscle decussate with the fibres of those adjacent muscl( which lie under cover of the outer loops. \ The innermost fibres of the palpebral portion are shorter than the rest an( instead of extending across the whole length of the tarsi, they terminate upon the free margins, between the attachment of the eyelashes and the orifices of certain glands w^hich line the inner surface of the tarsi. : Nerve-supply.—The temporal and malar branches of the temporo-facii I division of the facial nerve, which enter the outer part of the muscle upon its deti surface. Action.—(1) The orbital portion by its contraction draws the soft parts arour| the opening of the orbit inwards and towards the palpebral aperture, raisir up a ridge which deepens the socket of the eye so as to protect the eyeball fro: injury, e.g. from the blow of a fist. (2) Its upper part will loww the eyebrow, {j when the face is exposed to a strong light, or when the mind is wrapt in thought. (: The palpebral portion will lower the upper and raise the lower eyelid, in closure i the eye. (4) The firm contraction of the whole muscle presses upon the eyebalj and supports it from the evil eftect of a strong expiratory effort, which by tl rush of blood into the interior of the eyeball might burst its thin-walled vessel and do serious harm to the delicate structures within. Thus it will be noticed th in shouting, sneezing, or violent coughing the eyes are tightly closed. (5) 11 pressure upon the lachrymal gland it is probable that the muscle influences tl secretion of tears : hence their flow during violent coughing or laughter. It w: also draw outwards and forwards the covering of the lachrymal sac, and so produi a suction of the tears through the canaliculi into the sac. Relations.—Superficially, the skin ; upon its deep surface the tarsal cartilagt; and their ligaments, the palpebral ligaments and the expansion of the tendon j the levator palpebraB superioris ; the bones which bound the opening of the orbit, tl frontalis and corrugator supercilii muscles above ; the temporal fascia externall} the zygomaticus minor, levator labii superioris, and levator labii superioris alasqi nasi, below ; also the supraorbital vessels and nerves, the supratrochlear nerve, tl | terminal portion of the facial artery, and the palpebral branches of the infri orbital vessels and nerve.457 TENSOB TABSI—COBRUGATOB SUPEBCILII 2.

Origin.—The crest of the lachrymal bone. Insertion.—The posterior aspect of the inner end of the tarsi. I Structure.—Arising as a thin muscular sheet, at the back of, and in close contact fwith, the outer surface of the lachrymal sac, the muscle divides into two slips which run behind the canahcuH, and are inserted into the edge of the eyehds near the ipuncta lachrymalia. Nerve-supply.—From the infraorbital branch of the upper division of the facial nerve, by small slips which enter the muscle near its lower border. !

Origin.—The inner extremity of the superciliary ridge of the frontal bone. Insertion.—The deep surface of the skin at the middle of the eyebrow. Structure.—A small wisp of fleshy fibres, closely connected with the orbital ortion of the orbicularis palpebrarum. It passes outwards, and at the same time lightly upwards and forwards, to the under surface of this muscle, and, diverging lightly, its fibres pass between those of the orbicularis and frontalis to their nsertion in the skin. Nerve-supply.—The temporal branch of the upper division of the facial nerve, 'hich enters its deep surface from the outer side. Action.—To draw the middle of the eyebrow inwards and slightly downwards. the adult this causes vertical wrinkles to form between the eyebrows, and gives frowning aspect to the face, as when a difficulty occurs either in thought or action, u the crying infant, the effect of its contraction is to cause dimples about the458 THE MUSCLES centre of the eyebrows, which may nsnally be observed just before the orbiculares palpebrarum close the eyes. Relations.—Superficially, the orbicularis palpebrarum ; deeply, the frontal bone. THE EXTEINSIC MUSCLES OF THE AUEICLE The extrinsic muscles of the auricle (fig. 309)—viz. the attoUens aurem, the attrahens aurem, and the retrahens aurem—are feeble, and almost vestigial in man. They are closely connected with the occipito-frontalis. The largest of the three is the attollens aurem. 1.

I I THE MUSCLES OF THE NOSE The chief muscles of the nose are three in number: viz. the pyramidalis nasi land compressor narium, which consist of muscular fibres w^hich pass upwards and outwards from an aponeurosis, covering the cartilaginous part of the ridge of {the nose, and intimately connected with the under surface of the skin; and the depressor alae nasi. A small slip from the levator labii superioris al^que nasi is also attached to the ala nasi; and two little muscles may sometimes be found in the subcutaneous tissue upon the outer surface of the nostril: viz. the dilatator naris lanterior and posterior. [ I . 1. PYRAMIDALIS The pyramidalis (figs. 809, 311)—named from its triangular shape, which is like the side of a pyramid—is a thin triangular sheet. Origin.—The upper border of the nasal aponeurosis over the junction of the cartilage with the lower border of the nasal bone. Insertion.—The deep surface of the skin between the eyebrows, being at this point continuous with the inner fibres of the frontalis. Structure.—The muscular fibres form a slightly curved sheet, which wraps round the anterior surface of the nasal bone, and is continuous with the corresponding I muscle of the other side. They converge as they pass upwards, and the outer ones run slightly inwards as well as upwards, to their insertion. Nerve-supply.—The infraorbital branch of the upper division of the facial, which enters the outer part of its deep surface. j Action.—To draw downwards the skin between the eyebrows, so as to throw it [forwards into a fold, and at the same time to produce a transverse groove above the bridge of the nose. This gives to the face a stern, aggressive, or fierce expression. j Relations.-—Superficially, the skin ; and deeply, the nasal bone. ! Variation.—This muscle is sometimes absent. 2. COMPRESSOR NARIUM The compressor narium (figs. 309, 311)—named from its supposed action as a compressor of the nostrils—is a triangular sheet, the base of which is attached to the nasal aponeurosis above mentioned. Origin.—The sides of the nasal aponeurosis. Insertion.—(1) The lower and front part of the canine fossa of the maxilla; (2) part of its fibres are continued into those of adjacent muscles, especially the levator labii superioris alseque nasi, and the levator anguli oris.460 THE MUSCLES Structure.—Arising from the side of the aponeurosis in a vertical Hne about half an inch from the ridge of the nose, the fibres of the muscular sheet converge as they pass backwards, outwards and downwards, to a narrow band just above and behind the ala nasi. Here they are partly attached to the maxilla, and partly they pass into the adjacent muscles. Nerve-supply.—The infraorbital branch of the upper division of the facial nerve, which sends filaments to the deep surface of the muscle near its upper border. Action.—(1) To depress slightly the cartilaginous ridge of the nose ; (2) to throw into vertical wrinkles the side of the nose, as when a bad smell is perceived; (3) to assist the adjacent muscles in dilating the nostril and drawing up parts of the upper lip. Relations.—Superficially, the skin and levator labii superioris ahieque nasi; deeply, the cartilages of the nose. 8.

MUSCLES OF THE MOUTH The muscles of the mouth consist, firstly, of the orbicularis oris, which is the sphincter surrounding the aperture ; and secondly, of the bands which radiate from this, as a centre, to their origin upon the adjacent facial bones. These may be grouped into three sets : viz. (1) the transverse series, which radiate transversely. This consists of only one pair of muscles, the buccinators. (2) The angular series, which pass from above or beloAv to the corner of the mouth. (3) The labial series, which pass nearly vertically either downwards or upwards to the lips, and chiefly to their inner half. A fourth series may be added, which have no special connection with the mouth, jviz. two nearly vertical muscles close to the middle line, which radiate from an origin close to the mouth. Of these, one has already been described, the depressor lalae nasi; the other arises from the lower jaw, the levator menti. The muscles might also be arranged according to their stratification, for they form two, and, in some parts, three layers over the greater part of this region. 1. ORBICULARIS ORIS The orbicularis oris—an unpaired muscle, named from its shape and situation— is an oval sheet with the long axis placed transversely, and its fibres arranged round a transverse central aperture. Like the orbicularis oculi, the muscle may be divided into an internal or labial portion, and an external or facial. The first part, which is superficial, has no bony connection, except through the medium of the adjacent muscles with which it is closely blended. The second, which is deep and |which forms part of the third layer of the facial muscles, has the following small Ibony attachments. Attachments to bone.—(1) Naso-labial slips from the back of the lower part of the cartilage of the septum of the nose ; (2) the incisive fossa of the maxilla just above the socket of the lateral incisor tooth ; (3) the incisive fossa of the mandible, below the sockets of the lateral incisor and canine teeth. Structure.—The orbicularis oris consists of three sets of fibres, which are in their direction approximately transverse, vertical, and sagittal or antero-posterior. The transverse set form the most conspicuous part of the muscle ; they are continuous on either side with the fibres of the buccinator, and they constitute theTHE MUSCLES 462 greater part of the fine smooth bundles which He beneath the red skin of the pro- labium, and are called the labial portion of the muscle. The vertical fibres are derived from the elevators and depressors of the lips, including the zygomatici; they form the superficial part of the facial portion, and they interlace with the trans- verse fibres. Many of them pass round the corners of the mouth and become transverse ; those arising from the maxilla and its vicinity passing to the lower lip, while those from the mandible go to the upper. The sagittal or antero- posterior fibres pass directly or somewhat obliquely from before backwards between the transverse fibres, and unite the skin to the mucous membrane. They are found chiefly in the labial portion of the muscle. The two naso-labial slips pass side by side vertically downwards to the upper part of the muscle, their position being indicated upon the surface by two small vertical ridges which descend from the columna nasi on either side of the median groove of the upper lip. The fleshy slips from the maxilla and mandible—the musculi incisivi, as they are called—pass outwards and forwards to join the deep surface of the transverse fibres near the corners of the mouth. Nerve-supply.—The buccal and supramaxillary branches of the lower division of the facial, which enter the facial part of the muscle near its outer border. Action.—(1) To bring together the lips and to oppose all the other muscles which converge upon the mouth, and tend to draw it open in various directions. It thus acts negatively, and prevents the expression of any emotion, as when the lips are pursed up. If the upper fibres alone act, the upper lip will be drawn downwards; if the lower, the lower lip will be drawn upwards. If the fibres of the labial portion contract strongly, the corners of the mouth are approximated. (2) To shoot out the lips : this will chiefly depend upon the contraction of the facial portion and the musculi incisivi. (3) To press the lips against the teeth : the plane of the muscle being curved, with the concavity against the arches formed by the front teeth, its contraction will carry the food backwards into the oral cavity. Relations.—In front of the labial portion is the bright red skin of the prolabium ; and in front of the facial portion lie the angular and labial series of muscles, together with some subcutaneous fat. Upon the deep surface lies the mucous membrane of the mouth, separated from the muscular fibres by the mucous and small salivary glands, together with the superior and inferior coronary arteries. Tkansverse Muscles of the Mouth This group comprises only the buccinator. BUCCINATOK The buccinator—named from its action, as it is the muscle used by the trumpeter (huccinator)—is a somewhat oval sheet of muscular fibre, distinct in its origin, but blending in front with the orbicularis oris. It forms a part of the thn-d stratum of the facial muscles. Origin.— (1) The outer surface of the alveolar process of the maxilla, above the last two molars; (2) the anterior border of the pterygo-maxillary hgament, a fibrous band or raphe extending from the hamular process of the internal pterygoid plate of the sphenoid bone to the back of the mylo-hyoid ridge of the mandible ; (3) the outer surface of the alveolar process of the mandible below the last two molars.463 BUG GIN AT OB Insertion.—The outer part of the orbicularis oris. Structure.—It rises by fleshy fibres which run forwards in four sets. The Lpper set pass directly into the facial portion of the orbicularis oris which belongs 0 the upper lip ; the next pass downwards and forwards to that which belongs to the Dwer lip ; the third upwards and forwards, decussating with the second set to join he lower part of the orbicularis in the upper lip. Finally, a fourth set which pass mm the mandible to the lower part of the facial portion of the orbicularis oris )elonging to the lower lip.

Action.—(1) To draw outwards the corner of the mouth, widening it and ressing the lips against the teeth ; (2) to diminish the concavity of the cheek,\ 464 THE MUSCLES compressing- the air contained in it, as in using the blowpipe or playing the cornet; or forcing inwards the food when, in mastication, any portion of it has escaped into that part of the mouth which is external to the bicuspids and molar teeth. Relations.— Superficially, the skin, subcutaneous fat, Steno's duct, the zygo- maticus major, risorius, a large mass of fat (the buccal fat-pad) which separates the buccinator from the masseter, and a layer of deep fascia continuous with that which covers the upper part of the pharynx ; deeply, the mucous membrane of the mouth. The upper part of the muscle is perforated by Steno's duct. The buccinator is almost continuous behind with the superior constrictor, from which it is only separated by the tendinous intersection of the pterygo-maxillary ligament. Angular Muscles of the Mouth The angular series are four in number : viz. the zygomaticus major, levator anguli oris, risorius, and depressor anguli oris. Two descend to the corner of the mouth obliquely from above, one runs almost horizontally forwards, and one ascends from below. They blend at the corner of the mouth, and form there a thick muscular mass, behind which is a depression filled up with the fat covering the buccinator. In a lean face this depression is often very conspicuous, and in some faces its position is indicated by a dimple when the zygomaticus major contracts. 1. ZYGOMATICUS MAJOR The zygomaticus major—named from its origin from the zygoma and its size- is ribbon-shaped, and belongs to the first layer of the muscles. Origin.—The outer surface of the malar bone near the zygomatic suture. Insertion.—The deep surface of the skin, and the subcutaneous tissue at the outer extremity of the upper lip, and just external to the commissure of the lips. Structure.—Arising by short tendinous fibres, the muscle forms a fleshy band which passes downwards and forwards to the meeting-point of the angular muscles at and external to the angle of the mouth, where it blends with the orbicularis oris and the other angular muscles, its outermost fibres passing into the outer fibres of the depressor anguli oris. Nerve-supply.—The infraorbital branch of the upper division of the facial nerve, which enters the middle of its deep surface. Action.—To draw upwards and outwards the corners of the mouth, as in smiling or laughter. When it is strongly contracted, it throws into prominence the soft parts of the cheek in front of the malar bone, raises the lower eyelid, and produces 'crow's-feet,' as the wrinkles are called which radiate outwards from the outer canthus. When both muscles act together, the mouth is widened, and the upper lip raised so as to show the upper teeth, in what is called a ' broad grin.' Relations.—Superficially, the skin ; deeply, the buccinator and facial part of the orbicularis oris, the facial and transverse facial arteries, the facial vein, and some branches of the facial nerve. 2. LEVATOR ANGULI ORIS The levator anguli oris—named from its action upon the corner of the mouth —is a triangular sheet and belongs to the second stratum of the facial muscles. Origin.—The canine fossa of the maxilla.BISOBIUS—DEPBESSOB ANGULI OBIS 465 Insertion.—The deep surface of the skin, and the subcutaneous tissue, close 0 the corner of the mouth. Structure.—Arising muscular from its broad origin above the canine and [bicuspid teeth, the fibres converge in a downward and outward direction, and blend 'nth the other angular muscles outside the corner of the mouth. Nerve-supply.—The infraorbital branch of the upper division of the facial at he outer part of the anterior surface. Action.—To raise the corner of the mouth, but at the same time to draw it jiwards. Relations.—Superficially, the zygomaticus minor and levator labii superioris, le infraorbital vessels and nerves ; deeply, the facial portion of the orbicularis iris. 3. RISOEIUS The risorius—named from its supposed action in laughter—is flat and ribbon- laped, and belongs to the superficial sheet of muscles, being a part of the platysma iiyoides, and often very small and ill-developed. ! Origin.—The subcutaneous tissue overlying the deep fascia which covers the lasseter and parotid gland. 1 Insertion.—The subcutaneous and muscular tissue external to the angle of the |.outh. 1 Structure.—It is a band of parallel fibres which runs transversely forwards om the upper and posterior part of the platysma to the corner of the mouth. Nerve-supply.—The buccal branch of the lower division of the facial nerve hich enters it from beneath. Action.—To widen the mouth by drawing its corner directly outwards. It is not ed in the expression of pleasure like the zygomaticus major, but it gives a strained ;inful expression to the features, such as is seen in tetanus, and called the 'risus irdonicus.' i Relations.—Superficially, the skin and subcutaneous fat; deeply, the masseter ij.d buccinator, the facial artery and vein, and branches of the facial nerve. 4. DEPRESSOR ANGULI ORIS The depressor anguli oris—named from its action upon the corner of the rath—is a triangular sheet, and belongs to the superficial layer of facial muscles. Origin.—The outer aspect of the lower border of the body of the mandible and tje external oblique line below the canine, bicuspid, and first molar teeth, lasertion.—The subcutaneous connective tissue, and the muscular mass external the corner of the mouth. Structure.—Its fibres, arising fleshy, converge upwards and inwards, and, having dainished to a narrow band, join the general muscular mass at the corner of ! mouth, some of them being continued upwards into the levator anguli oris, i the most external into the zygomaticus major. The fibres which form the inner border of the muscles are often continued djvnwards below the mandible, and form with those of the other side a band, partly i|scular and partly fibrous, which, lying benea-th the platysma myoides, supports a|i compresses the subcutaneous fat below and behind the prominence of the chin, len there is much subcutaneous fat, the absence of this support gives rise to a isiderable prominence behind this band, and forms what is called a ' double chin.' Nerve-supply.—The supramaxillary branch of the lower division of the facial ve, which sends filaments to the back part of its deep surface. H H466 THE MUSCLES Action.—To draw downwards and somewhat outwards the angle of the mouth, giving an expression of sorrow to the face, making the individual look * down in the mouth.' Relations.—The skin superficially ; deeply, the depressor labii inferioris and inferior coronary artery. Labial Group of Muscles The labial set consist of three muscles, which form a continuous sheet and I might fairly be included under one name, passing downwards from the maxilla; | and a single muscle passing upwards from the mandible. Both sets are inserted into the lips, and especially into that part of them which intervenes between the middle line and a point half way between this and the corner of the mouth. The upper set is formed by the levator labii superioris alseque nasi, the levator labii superioris, and the zygomaticus minor; the lower set by the depressor labii inferioris. 1. LEVATOR LABII SUPERIORIS AL^QUE NASI The levator labii superioris alaeque nasi—named from its action as an elevator of the upper lip and the nostril—is a somewhat triangular sheet, bifurcating below at the base which corresponds to the insertion of the muscle. It belongs to the superficial sheet of facial muscles. Origin.—The anterior half of the outer surface of the nasal process of the maxilla. Insertion—(1) The deep surface of the skin which covers the lower part of the ala nasi; (2) the deep surface of the skin, and the general muscular mass, of the inner half of the upper lip. Structure.—Arising fleshy, its fibres diverge somewhat as they pass downwards; they then decussate with those of the orbicularis oris close to the prolabium. Nerve-supply.—The infraorbital branch of the upper division of the facial nerve, which sends filaments to the outer part of the deep surface of the muscle. Action.—(1) To raise and dilate the nostril; (2) to raise the inner half of the upper lip. ' Relations.—Superficially, the skin and orbicularis palpebrarum ; deeply, the compressor narium and levator anguli oris. 2. LEVATOR LABII SUPERIORIS ; The levator labii superioris—named from its action—is a nearly square sheet, : and it belongs to the superficial layer of muscles. j i Origin.—The front of the maxilla just below the rim of the orbit. ' 1 Insertion.—The deep surface of the skin and the subjacent muscular tissue neari ii the upper edge of the inner half of the upper prolabium. I Structure.—Its fibres, arising fleshy, descend parallel to one another and almost : I vertically to their insertion, where they interlace with the fibres of the orbicularis' iij oris. It frequently receives at its outer border some bundles of fibres from th^ orbicularis palpebrarum. 1 Nerve-supply.—The infraorbital branch of the upper division of the facia} nerve, which sends filaments to the outer part of its deep surface. ' Action.—To raise the inner half of the upper lip. This muscle, with its tw(| j fellows, the preceding and following, is especially used in the expression of grief| JZYGOMATIGUS MINOB—DEPBESSOB LABII INFEBIOBIS 467 ' and to some extent of anger also, as when the lip is raised and somewhat everted so as to show the canine tooth. In crying, the action of these muscles is strongly displayed, for when the eyes are closed by the orbicularis palpebrarum, at the same time the mouth is made four-square by the elevation of the inner half of the lip, while the outer half is drawn down by the depressor anguli oris. j Relations.—Superficially, the skin and orbicularis palpebrarum; deeply, the [levator anguli oris, the infraorbital vessels and nerves. j The zygomaticus minor—named from its association with the zygomaticus major and its smaller size—is a small ribbon-shaped band, often absent, and belonging to the superficial sheet of facial muscles. j Origin.—The lower part of the front of the malar bone close to its junction Iwith the maxilla. ! Insertion.—The deep surface of the skin and the subjacent muscular tissue at I point upon the upper border of the prolabium of the upper lip about midway petween the middle line and the outer corner of the mouth. Structure.—Arising fleshy, the small band of parallel fibres which is upon its linner margin closely connected with the preceding muscle, passes downwards and inwards to its insertion, which interlaces with the fibres of the orbicularis oris. Nerve-supply.—The infraorbital branch of the upper division of the facial aerve, which sends filaments to the deep surface of the muscle. Action.—To raise and somewhat evert the part of the upper lip to which it is jittached. Relations.—Superficially, the skin and orbicularis palpebrarum ; deeply, the evator anguli oris, facial portion of the orbicularis oris, and the infraorbital branch )f the facial nerve. The depressor labii inferioris, or quadratus menti—named from its action, or shape, and connection with the chin (mentum)—is a nearly square sheet, and belongs to the second layer of the facial muscles. Origin.—The outer aspect of the lower border of the body of the mandible below he canine and bicuspid teeth. Insertion.—The deep surface of the skin and the subjacent muscular mass along I he lower edge of the prolabium of the lower lip. Structure.—It consists of parallel muscular fibres, many of them continuous Y^ih. those of the platysma myoides, which pass upwards and inwards to inter- Ebce with the fibres of the orbicularis oris along the line above mentioned. The nner margins of the muscles of the two sides meet above in the middle line. Nerve-supply.—The supramaxillary branch of the lower division of the facial '.erve, which sends filaments to its deep surface near its outer border. Action.—To draw down and somewhat evert the lower lip. I Relations.—Superficially, the skin and the depressor anguli oris; deeply, the iicial portion of the orbicularis oris, the menta^l vessels, and nerve. 3. ZYGOMATICUS MINOR 4. DEPRESSOR LABII INFERIORIS H H 2THE MUSCLES 468 Muscles eadiatixg from the Mouth The two muscles which radiate from the month are the depressor alse nasi and the levator menti. 1. DEPRESSOR AL^ NASI The depressor al?e nasi has been described with the muscles of the nose. 2. LEVATOR MENTI The levator menli, or levator labii inferioris—named from its action—is a short, thick, and somewhat fan-shaped muscle, belonging to the second layer. Origin.—The incisive fossa of the mandible, below and a little internal to the attachment of the incisivus inferior of the orbicularis oris. Insertion.— The subcutaneous tissue just above the point of the chin. Structure.—Arising fleshy, its fibres diverge slightly as they pass downwards and inwards to meet in the middle line with those of the opposite side just below a pellet of fat which lies beneath the skin at a short distance above the point of the chin. Nerve-supply.^—The supramaxillary branch of the lower division of the facial nerve, which terminates in this muscle. Action.—To draw upwards the skin covering the prominence of the chin, and to elevate and shoot out the lower lip. It has been sometimes called the viuscukis superhus, from the haughty and contemptuous expression which it produces when it acts at the same time with the depressor anguli oris. A slighter contraction, however, gives the mouth an expression of firmness and decision. Relations.—Superj&cially, the mucous membrane of the mouth and the facial portion of the orbicularis oris above, the subcutaneous fat below ; deeply, the mandible. MUSCLES OF MASTICATION The muscles of mastication form an independent group, four in number, occupying the back part of the side of the face, and the temporal and zygomatic fossae, and consisting of the masseter, the temporal, with the external and internal pterygoid muscles. The temporal muscle is covered by a strong membrane, the temporal fascia, which, arising from the temporal ridge, is attached below to the upper border of the zygoma, after first dividing into two laminae which go to the outer and inner aspects of this border, and contain between them a small quantity of fat. From the zygoma downwards, the masseteric fascia is continued to the posterior and inferior borders of the ramus of the mandible, enveloping the masseter muscle. Closely connected with this is the parotid fascia which envelops this gland, extending backwards from the masseteric fascia to that part of the deep cervical fascia which covers the upper portion of the sterno-mastoid muscle ; covering also the deep surface of the gland, and giving off a process called the stylo-maxillary ligament, which, running from the styloid process to the angle of the mandible, separates the parotid and submaxillary glands.MA SSETEB—TEMPOBAL 469 1. MASSETER I The masseter (fig. 311)—named from the Greek word /xao-o-ao/^at to chew—is a [strong quadrate sheet, consisting of two layers. E Origin.—The superficial layer, from the lower border of the malar bone, and j the lower border of the anterior two-thirds of the zygomatic arch; the deep layer, from I the lower border of the posterior third of the zygomatic arch, and the whole of its ! inner sm'face. ' Insertion.—Superficial layer, into the lower half of the outer surface of the j ramus of the mandible ; the deep layer, partly with the superficial layer, and partly into the upper half of the outer surface of the ramus of the mandible. Structure.—The origin and insertion are by tendinous bands intermingled in multipenniform fashion with fleshy fibres. The fibres of the superficial sheet are 'directed obliquely downwards and backwards; those of the deep sheet almost Svertically dow^nwards, and they are much shorter than the superficial fibres. The two sheets blend closely in front, but are separate behind, where the muscle forms ,a sort of pocket closed above at the origin and below at the insertion, as well as in I front, but open behind. Nerve-supply.—The masseteric branch of the motor division of the inferior imaxillary nerve, which enters the deep surface of the muscle just below the zygoma. I Action.—To close the jaw, and by its superficial sheet to draw it slightly forwards. In closing the jaw it acts with less mechanical disadvantage than is jusual with muscles. When the pressure to be overcome is exerted upon the back teeth, the arm of the lever upon which the power acts is almost as long as that which intervenes between these teeth and the fulcrum. This fulcrum is not at the temporo-maxillary joint, but at a point below the neck of the mandible, cor- responding very nearly to the lower attachment of the internal lateral ligament. Moreover, the resultant force of the muscle, acting as it does upwards and forwards, is perpendicular to the lever, which may be roughly described as a bar extending downwards and forwards from the neck of the mandible to the point of the chin. Relations.—Superficially, the parotid gland and its duct, the platysma tnyoides, the risorius and the masseteric fascia, the transverse facial vessels, the facial vein, the upper and lower divisions of the facial nerve ; deeply, the buccal :at-pad which separates it from the buccinator, a small part of the temporal muscle, md the ramus of the mandible. 2. THE TEMPORAL MUSCLE The temporal muscle—named from its attachment to the iQm])\.Q {=tempus)—is |i thick, somewhat triangular sheet; more correctly it may be described as forming bhe quadrant of a circle. Origin.—(1) The whole of the temporal fossa, from the lower ridge of that lame to the pterygoid ridge, with the exception of a small part close to the outer ivall of the orbit, which is occupied by fat; (2) the inner surface of the temporal fascia down to its lower attachment to the zygomatic process, from the inner surface of which some of its fibres also sometimes arise. Insertion.—The point, posterior border, and the whole of the inner surface of 'he coronoid process of the mandible, down to the last molar tooth. Structure.—The bones of the temporal fossa and the temporal fascia form a oouch, open downwards, from which the fleshy fibres of the muscle converge,470 THE MUSCLES the middle fibres running downwards, the anterior downwards and backwards, the posterior almost transversely forwards, to be inserted below upon both faces of a flat tendon which, becoming free of flesh on the outer surface first, embraces the point and borders of the coronoid process. Nerve-supply.—The two or three deep temporal branches of the motor portion of the inferior maxillary nerve, which enter the lower part of its deep surface. Action.—To close the jaw ; its posterior fibres will also draw it backwards after the other muscles have protruded it. This muscle, like the masseter, has to contend with very little mechanical disadvantage, power being of more importance in mastication than speed. Relations.—Superficially, the temporal fascia which separates it from some of the auricular muscles, the sides of the epicranial aponeurosis, the auriculo-temporal nerve, and the upper branches of the facial nerve ; the zygoma and a small part of the masseter. Deeply, the temporal fossa, and the external pterygoid muscle. At its posterior border it is crossed by the masseteric nerve and vessels. 3. PTERYGOIDEUS EXTERNUS The pterygoideus externus—named from its attachment to the pterygoid process of the sphenoid bone, and its relation to the companion muscle—consists f of two thick triangular sheets, the one lying in a horizontal, and the other in a ' vertical plane. Origin.— Upper head : the under surface of the great wing of the sphenoid bone, internal to the pterygoid ridge, and external to the foramen ovale and , foramen spinosum. Lower head : All the outer surface of the external pterygoid | plate, except a small strip at its lower and front part, . '471 PTEBYGOIDEUS EXTEBNUS Insertion.—Tipper head : (1) The front of the interarticular fibro-cartilage of he temporo-maxillary joint; (2) the adjacent portion of the capsular ligament; 3) the upper part of the front of the neck of the condyle of the mandible. Lower jiead: The pit in the front of the neck of the condyle. i Structure.—Arising by fleshy fibres, which are closely connected at the ptery- oid ridge with part of the temporal muscle, the upper head forms a fan-shaped heet which passes backwards and slightly outwards to its insertion, which is by hort tendinous fibres blending below with those of the lower head. The lower nd much stronger head is at first separated from the upper by a small chink, l^hich may give passage to the internal maxillary vessels. It arises fleshy, converges iackwards, outwards, and somewhat upwards, and is inserted by short tendinous ibres. Nerve-supply.—The external pterygoid branch of the motor division of the iferior maxillary nerve, which divides into filaments entering its deep surface. ; Action.—(1) To draw forwards the ramus of the mandible, and the inter- rticular fibro-cartilage; (2) to draw them inwards. The combination of these wo movements produces the oblique movement of the lower molar teeth of one ide, forwards and inwards with respect to the upper molars which are their pponents. It should be observed also that this inward movement of one side is he agent by which the ramus of the opposite side is moved outwards. (3) To issist in opening the mouth by depression of the lower jaw. As the transverse xis of this movement passes through the mandible at two points situated below he necks of the rami, it folloAvs that a forward movement of the condyles and ecks will assist in the backward movement of the angles and body which accom- ■anies the depression of the mandible. Fig. 313.—The Pterygoid Muscles. External pterygoid Internal pterygoid472 THE MUSCLES Relations.—Superficially, the anterior fibres of the internal pterygoid, the temporal muscle, and, at a little distance, also a small part of the masseter; deeply, the internal pterygoid muscle, the internal maxillary vessels (unless, as sometimes, they pass across the outer surface of the lower head), the middle meningeal and inferior dental vessels, with the masseteric and posterior deep temporal nerves passing behind or through the attachment of the upper head ; the buccal and anterior deep temporal nerves running between the two heads ; the lingual gustatory and inferior dental nerves beneath the lower head. Variations.^—Muscular fibres are fi:-equently found upon the deep surface of the external pterygoid, running from the back of the external pterygoid plate to the spine of the sphenoid, or the vaginal process of the temporal bone. 4. PTEEYGOIDEUS INTERNUS The pterygoideus internus—named from its origin and relative position—is a thick quadrilateral sheet. Origin.'—(1) The whole of the inner surface of the external pterygoid plate. (2) A small triangular area, consisting of the outer surface of the tuberosity of the palate bone, and a small strip in front belonging to the maxilla, and one behind belonging to the external surface of the external pterygoid plate. Insertion.—The lower half of the internal surface of the ramus of the mandible, including the adjacent parts of its lower and posterior borders, and extending as high as the mylo-hyoid ridge and inferior dental canal. Structure.—Arising fleshy, the fibres run parallel to one another, downwards, backwards, and outwards, to be inserted partly directly into the mandible, and partly in multipenniform fashion, like those of the masseter, into the tips and sides of fibrous septa, which, passing upwards from the periosteum of the mandible, separate the muscular bundles from one another. Nerve-supply.—The internal pterygoid branch of the motor division of the inferior maxillary, which enters the deep surface near its posterior border. Action.—(1) To close the jaw. The same remarks which were made with respect to the very small loss of mechanical advantage in the masseter muscle apply to this muscle. (2) When closed it will draw the jaw forwards; and also (3) it will help the external pterygoid in drawing the ramus of its own side towards the middle line. Relations.—Superficially, the external pterygoid muscle, the internal lateral ligament, the internal maxillary vessels, the inferior dental and lingual nerves; deeply, the tensor palati and superior constrictor of the pharynx, the stylo-hyoid and posterior belly of the digastric, the submaxillary gland. THE MUSCLES AND FASCLE OF THE FEONT OF THE NECK The platysma myoides has been already described (page 452) with the muscles of expression. The muscles of the neck which lie beneath it are surrounded by a layer of deep fascia, called the cervical fascia. This is a strong tubular membrane, attached above to the lower border of the mandible, the parotid fascia, the upper part of the mastoid process, and the superior nuchal line. At the back of the neck it is continuous with the deep fascia which gives a thin investment to the trapezius473 STEBNO-CLEIDO-MA STOID iiuscle. In front, it is attached to the lower border of the body and great cornu iif the hyoid bone. Below, it ends upon the front surface of the presternum and [he clavicle. The deep layer of the cervical fascia separates from it just below the Ljoid bone, and runs downwards in close proximity to the sterno-hyoid muscles and ihe other depressors of the hyoid bone, to the upper part of the posterior surface f the sternum, and the posterior surface of the clavicle. Laterally, it blends with !nd completes the sheath of the sterno-mastoid muscle, which is partly formed by tie superficial layer of the cervical fascia; it also binds down the posterior belly f the omo-hyoid to the clavicle and first rib. Below its attachment to the sternum jnd clavicle it is continued downwards in front of the trachea and great vessels t the root of the neck into the superior mediastinum, and it finally joins the ericardium. Behind, it gives an investment to the depressors of the hyoid bone, jletween this deep layer of the cervical fascia and the superficial layer is a small pace containing a part of the course of the anterior jugular vein, a lymphatic land, some fat and loose connective tissue. j A still deeper fibrous layer, the prevertebral fascia, stretches across the neck Ind divides the cylindrical tube formed by the cervical fascia into a posterior and nterior compartment. Its surfaces are directed forwards and backwards. Behind, ,, rests in the middle line upon the ligaments covering the front of the bodies of le cervical vertebrae. Laterally, it covers in the prevertebral muscles, and is ttached to the deep surface of the sujjerjicial layer of the cervical fascia between |ie sterno-mastoid and trapezius muscles. In the compartment formed between the deep layer of the cervical fascia as it ivests the depressors of the hyoid bone, and the prevertebral fascia, processes are iven off which form the sheath of the great vessels of the neck, and invest the iiyroid gland, the trachea, and pharynx. The muscles of the front of the neck may be divided into three groups: the rst group consisting of one muscle which ascends from the sternum and clavicle ) the head, the sterno-cleido-mastoideus ; the second, of those which ascend from le sternum, clavicle, and shoulder blade to the hyoid bone and thyroid cartilage ; le third, of those which are attached to the hyoid bone below, and the skull and )wer jaw above. I First Group STEKNO-CLEIDO-MASTOID The sterno-cleido-mastoid, or sterno-mastoid muscle—named from its attach- !.ents (KAet?=:a key, being the equivalent of clavicle)—is a strong ribbon-shaped md, bifurcated below, and somewhat constricted in its middle third. Origin.—Sternal head: the front of the manubrium (or presternum) between le notches for the clavicle and first rib, and the middle line. Clavicular head: he upper part of the anterior surface of the inner third of the clavicle. Insertion.—(1) Along the anterior border and the upper part of the outer .rface of the mastoid process of the temporal bone ; (2) the outer half of the iperior nuchal line of the occipital bone. Structure.—The sternal head is a rounded but flat tendon ; the clavicular is ^rtly fleshy and partly tendinous. After a course of about an inch, the sternal .!)ad expands into a flat muscle, which conceals the greater part of the clavicular ; >rtion, and, passing upwards, outwards, and backwards, is spread over the whole sie of the upper attachment. Frequently it is so separate from the clavicular '^ad, that they might very fairly be considered to form two muscles. The clavi- ' lar head soon becomes entirely fleshy and ascends more directly. At first it isTHE MUSCLES 474 separated by a small interval from the sternal head, corresponding to a part of the sterno-clavicular joint, from which it sometimes receives a few fibres of origin ; when they have joined, it passes beneath the sternal head to its insertion, which is chiefly the lower part of the outer surface of the mastoid process. The whole insertion in front is composed of short tendinous fibres, and behind of a thin aponeurosis. As the whole muscle has a very wide range of action, nearly the whole length of its fibres is fleshy. The sternal head is a little longer than the other, but has little if any more range of movement. Hence it is tendinous. Nerve-supply—(1) The spinal accessory nerve, which, while traversing the deep surface of the muscle at the junction of its upper and middle thirds, sends Fig. 314.—Anterior and Lateral Cervical Muscles. filaments to it; (2) the cervical plexus through the anterior primary branches ( the second and third cervical nerves, which enter the upper part of its deep surfac Action.—(1) To flex laterally the head and neck, so as to draw the side of tl head towards the shoulder. (2) To rotate the face towards the opposite side. Of tl two parts of the muscle, the cleido-mastoid portion is more concerned in later;! flexion, the sterno-mastoid in rotation. The combination of all these movemen I may be very well seen in a case of wry-neck, which results from the permane: contraction of this muscle. (3) When both muscles act, to flex the head and ne( upon the thorax, at the same time raising slightly the chin, which is therefo carried horizontally forwards. (4) To raise the sternum and inner end of t) €lavicle.

(5) If the head be much thrown back, the two sterno-mastoids may be used 0 increase the extension. Relations.—Superficially, the deep cervical fascia and integuments, the platysma iiyoides, external jugular vein, and many of the superficial branches of the ervical plexus, and the glandule concatenatae ; deeply, the rectus capitis anticus Liajor, omo-hyoid, sterno-hyoid and sterno-thyroid, the posterior belly of the igastric, the splenius capitis, levator anguli scapulae, and three scalene muscles; the common, external, and internal carotid and subclavian arteries, with several 'ranches of the external carotid, the internal jugular, facial, thyroid, anterior Ligular, and other veins ; the spinal accessory and hypoglossal nerves, the cervical jnd upper part of the brachial plexuses with many of their branches, the lateral lobe |f the thyroid gland, and numerous deep cervical lymphatic glands. Variations.— The clavicular origin may extend farther outwards upon the collar bone, jiesides its insertion into the mastoid process, this head may have an attachment to the iiperior nuchal line, called the cleido-occijntal. An extension of the sternal head has een observed arising from the costal cartilages as low as that of the fifth rib. Slips Dinetimes pass fi^om the upper part of the muscle to the angle of the jaw, the pharynx, be auricle, or the upper attachment of the trapezius. THE INFEA-HYOID MUSCLES The infra-h3^oid muscles form a group of four long flat muscles, arranged in livo layers, and enveloped by the deep layer of the cervical fascia. SuPEEFiciAL Layer This consists of two muscles—the sterno-hyoid and omo-hyoid. 1. STERNO-HYOID The sterno-hyoid (figs. 301, 314)—named from its two attachments—is long and ibbon-shaped. Origin,—(1) The back of the manubrium (presternum) just internal to the ptches for the clavicle and first rib ; (2) the back of the posterior sterno-clavicular b-ament; (3) the back of the inner end of the clavicle external to the facet for ;ie first costal cartilage. Insertion.—The lower border of the body of the hyoid bone, close to the middle Qe. 1 Structure.—It arises fleshy, and forms a band of parallel fibres, which approach le middle line as they ascend, and are inserted by a short tendon. i Nerve-supply.—From the first three cervical nerves through the descendens 1 id communicans hypoglossi, which send filaments to its deep surface near its )per end. Action.—To draw down the body of the hyoid bone, e.g. after it has been raised I, swallowing; also to fix it when the muscles which pass upwards from it are i ^pressing the tongue, as in suction. I delations.—Superficially, the deep cervical fascia, sterno-mastoid, sterno- avicular joint, anterior jugular vein; deeply, the sterno-thyroid, crico-thyroid, yroid and cricoid cartilages, the trachea, thyroid isthmus, the anterior jugular I id inferior thyroid veins.THE MUSCLES 476 Variations.—The sterno-hyoid may arise from the clavicle alone, and occasionally even from the middle of that bone. It may be absent or double. A tendinous intersection sometimes crosses it. 2. OMO-HYOID j The omo-hyoid (w/xo?=shoulder), named from its attachment to the shouldei blade and the hyoid bone—is ribbon-shaped with a tendinous constriction in the middle which divides it into two fleshy bellies. , Origin.—(1) The upper border of the scapula for about an inch behind the | suprascapular notch ; (2) occasionally, the upper border of the transverse ligameni | which crosses the notch. . i Insertion.—The lower border of the body of the hyoid bone just external t( the preceding, which it also slightly overlaps. I Structure.—Arising fleshy and broad, the muscle contracts slightly as it passes forwards, and a little upwards, across the posterior triangle of the neck above thi clavicle. Beneath the sterno-mastoid, and over the great vessels of the neck, i becomes tendinous for a short distance ; and then, changing its direction, it agaiij expands to a fleshy band which runs upwards and slightly forwards and inward*' to its insertion, which is by short tendinous, intermingled with fleshy, fibres. A] obtuse angle is formed between the two bellies, the lower portion of the musch and its tendon being held down by a strong process of the deep layer of th cervical fascia, which, forming a loop around them, passes downwards to be attache' to the posterior surface of the clavicle and to the first rib. Nerve-supply.—The anterior belly is supplied by a branch from the descender hypogiossi, which enters the back of its deep surface, while the posterior receive a branch from the loop of communication between this nerve and the commun \ cantes hypogiossi which enters the deep surface of the muscle close to its junctio with the tendon. Action.—(1) To draw down the hyoid bone ; (2) very slightly to help in raisin the scapula ; (3) to make tense the lower part of the cervical fascia. In this wa it assists the platysma myoides in diminishing the inward suction of the so ; parts, which tends to compress the great vessels and the apices of the lungs durin \ prolonged inspiratory efforts. The part of the muscle between the sterno-mastoi i and the carotid sheath, being tendinous, will not vary in thickness, otherwif! during contraction it might tend to obstruct the vessels beneath. j Relations.—Superficially, the deep cervical fascia, sterno-mastoid, clavicl | subclavius and trapezius, the external jugular vein, and the descending branch; of the superficial cervical plexus ; deeply, the thyro-hyoid, sterno-thyroid, scaler. | and the first digitation of the serratus magnus, the sheath of the common carot! artery and internal jugular vein, the upper part of the brachial plexus, often tl i third part of the subclavian artery with the transversalis colli and suprascapul li arteries and the suprascapular nerve. | Variations.—These are very frequent. It may be absent or double. The posteri; belly may be attached to the clavicle and scapula, or to the clavicle alone. Itmayrecei i a slip from the manubrium. The anterior belly may blend with the sterno-hyoid, and j may send a slip to the thyroid cartilage or the mandible. ;STEBNO-THYBOID-THYBO-HYOJD Second Layer of Infra-hyotd Musclrs iThis consists of two muscles—the sterno-thyroicl and thyro-hyoid. 1. STERNO-THYROID The sterno-thyroid (figs. 301, 314)—named from its attachment to the sternmn id thyroid cartilages—is flat and ribbon-shaped. Orig-in.—(1) The lower part and side of the back of the manubrium (pre- ernum), from the middle line to the notch for the first rib cartilage ; (2) the back the first rib cartilage, and occasionally that of the second; and (3) occasionally om the back of the clavicle near the facet for the first costal cartilage. Insertion.—The oblique line on the outer surface of the ala of the thyroid ,rtilage. Structure.—Arising fleshy, the two muscles form broad bands of parallel fibres, hich at first lie close to one another, and afterwards diverge slightly as they cend. Finally, they are inserted by short tendinous fibres into the thyroid ,rtilage. Occasionally the muscle is crossed by a tendinous intersection. Nerve-supply.—Branches from the loop between the descendens and the com- unicantes hypoglossi which enter the outer part of the deep surface of the muscle. Action.—(1) To draw down the thyroid cartilage, e.g. after swallowing; (2) in injunction with the thyro-hyoid it will depress the hyoid bone. Relations.—Superficially, the cervical fascia and first piece of the sternum, .6 anterior jugular vein, the sterno-mastoid and sterno-hyoid and omo-hyoid uscles ; deeply, the thyroid cartilage, inferior constrictor, the cricoid cartilage, ico-thyroid muscle, thyroid gland, inferior thyroid veins and trachea, the common irotid artery and left innominate vein. Variations—This muscle may be absent, or double ; the muscles of the two sides may ! united. It may send a slip to the carotid sheath. 2. THYRO-HYOID I ' The thyro-hyoid—named from its attachment to the thyroid cartilage and hyoid 'pne—is a quadrilateral sheet. Origin.—The oblique line on the outer surface of the ala of the thyroid cartilage. i \ Insertion.—The lower border of (1) the outer third of the body of the hyoid me ; and of (2) the inner half of the greater cornu. Structure.—This muscle is a continuation upwards of the preceding muscle, .any of its fibres being derived from those of the sterno-thyroid without any itachment to the cartilage. It consists of parallel fleshy fibres which run nearly ktically upwards to their insertion into the hyoid bone. Nerve-supply.—A special branch of the hypoglossal nerve which enters the deep irface of the muscle near its posterior border. Action.—To draw up the thyroid cartilage, as in swallowing, or in the pro- \ iction of a high note in singing; (2) in association with the sterno-thyroid to Icaw down the hyoid bone. Relations.—Superficially, the sterno-hyoid, omo-hyoid, and sterno-mastoid ; \3eply, the thyro-hyoid membrane, the thyro-hyoid bursa and ala of the thyroid irtilage, the superior laryngeal vessels and nerve. Variations.—SHps are occasionally seen passing from the cricoid cartilage to the hyoid 3ne, or between the upper border of the thyroid cartilage in front and the body of the hyoid one.478 THE MUSCLES THE SUPEA-HYOID MUSCLES These consist of four muscles arranged in three layers : the first containing the digastric and stjlo-hyoid, the second the mylo-hyoid, and the third the genio- hyoid. 1. DIGASTRIC The digastric—named from its two bellies (yao-rrjp the belly)—is composed o two flattened and somewhat spindle-shaped bellies united by a tendon. Origin.—(1) Of ijosterior belly, the digastric fossa of the temporal bone ; (2) o anterior belly, the low^er border of the body of the mandible just internal to thi symphysis. Insertion.—By its central tendon, which is attached to the outer part of thi lower border of the body of the hyoid bone and the adjacent part of the grea cornu. Structure.—The 2^osterio7' belly at its origin consists of short tendinous fibres which soon form a laterally compressed muscle. This passes downwards, forward and inwards, and converges upon a laterally flattened rounded tendon about hal an inch above the tip of the great cornu of the hyoid bone. The anterior belly arises by short tendinous fibres, and forms a muscle flattenec from before backwards and from above downwards, Avhich is shorter and smalle than the posterior belly. Its fibres converge as they pass backwards and slightl; downwards and outwards, to end in the flattened tendon a quarter of an incl above the junction of the body and great cornu of the hyoid bone. The centra tendon is bound down to its insertion upon the hyoid bone, chiefly by a fibrou expansion given off from its lower border, and to a very small degree also by th^ oblique arch over it formed by the division of the stylo-hyoid muscle. Often ; part of this aponeurosis passes inwards across the middle line and, uniting mth it fellow, forms a membranous covering to the deeper structures, and unites th inner borders of the two anterior bellies. Nerve-supply.—The posterior belly, which is really a distinct muscle, belonging to a deeper stratum of the muscular planes, receives a special branch from th facial nerve which enters the upper part of its deep surface. Perhaps this may h due to the fact that this part of the muscle assists in swallowing; for the facia nerve, by means of the Vidian and the relations which through the lesser superfieia petrosal nerve it has with the otic ganglion, may be considered to take part in thi function, as well as in the expression of emotions. The anterior belly receives at the outer part of its deep surface the termina filaments of the mylo-hyoid twig from the inferior dental branch of the inferio maxillary. Action.—(1) The posterior belly draws upwards and backwards the hyoid bone as in the elevation of the larynx in the second part of deglutition ; (2) the anterio belly, acting from above, draws upwards and forwards the hyoid bone ; and, actin; in the opposite direction, (3) it assists in the depression of the lower jaw and ii opening the mouth. Although a comparatively weak muscle, it acts with con siderable power in this movement, for it is inserted at the end of the lever of th^ second order formed by the mandible, while the resistance which it has to overcome is exerted by muscles acting much nearer to the fulcrum. Moreover, its directioi downwards and backwards is at a considerable angle with the line of the lever, viz that which joins the prominence of the chin to a point a little above the inferio dental foramen. (4) If the mandible be fixed and both bellies act, the hyoid boni will be drawn directly upwards. By this action the muscle is of great importance479 DIGASTBIC—STYLO-HYOID- MYLO-HYOID 1 the elevation of the tongue, which rests upon the upper surface of the hyoid one. It will therefore help in the first part of deglutition, in which the back of he tongue is pressed against the hard palate. i Eelations.—The posterior belly hes beneath the mastoid process, the sterno- lastoid, splenius, and trachelo-mastoid muscles, the facial vein, and the parotid land; in front lies the stylo-hyoid muscle ; deeply, the middle constrictor of the harynx, the hyo-giossus, the external and internal carotid arteries, and some of lie branches of the external carotid, the internal jugular vein, the hypoglossal and uperior laryngeal nerves. ! The tejidon lies beneath the deep cervical fascia, platysma myoides, and part of [ihe stylo-hyoid muscle. Above is the submaxillary gland. On its deep surface is he rest of the stylo-hyoid muscle, the mylo-hyoid, the hyo-giossus, and the hypo- llossal nerve. The anterior belly is covered by the deep cervical fascia and platysma myoides, ,nd it lies upon the mylo-hyoid muscle. Variations.—A second posterior belly may arise in front of the angle of the mandible; lips may also arise from the styloid process, or the pharynx. The anterior belly may 1)6 absent; it may be partly or entirely miited with that of the opposite side, or may send ]> slip to the median raphe of the mylo-hyoid. 2, STYLO-HYOID The stylo-hyoid—named from its attachments—is a slender fusiform muscle ivith a bifurcated lower extremity. Origin.—The back and outer surface of the styloid process of the temporal bone rear its base. Insertion.—The lower border of the body of the hyoid bone at the point of mion with the great cornu. , Structure.—Arising by a short tendon, its fibres soon become fleshy and pass |iownwards and forwards. Just before its insertion they divide into two bundles, which form an obliquely directed arch bridging over the tendon of the digastric muscle. Nerve-supply.—A special branch of the facial nerve, which enters its deep Isurface from behind. 1 Action.—The same as that of the posterior belly of the digastric, viz. to draw the hyoid bone backwards and upwards. Relations.—Superficially, the parotid gland and deep cervical fascia ; in front, the submaxillary gland ; behind, the posterior belly of the digastric ; deeply, the middle constrictor and hyo-giossus and the external carotid artery. Variations.—The stylo-hyoid may arise in part from the cartilage of the external auditory meatus. It may be absent, or its insertion may be midivided^ in which case it may pass to the inner or outer side of the digastric tendon. A second stylo-hyoid may run beneath the hyo-giossus to the lesser cornu of the hyoid bone. 3. MYLO-HYOID The mylo-hyoid—named from its attachment to the lower jaw (/xi;X?;=a mill and the jaw) and to the hyoid bone—is a triangular and somewhat curved sheet. Origin.—The whole length of the mylo-hyoid ridge on the inner surface of the body of the mandible. Insertion.—(1) The lower edge of the anterior surface of the body of the hyoid bone ; (2) a median raphe extending from the middle of the lower border of theTHE MUSCLES 480 body of the hyoid bone to the back of the symphysis of the mandible immediately | below the genial tubercles. Structure.—Arising by fleshy and short tendinous fibres intermingled, the! muscle passes inwards and slightly downwards to its insertion by short tendinous j fibres into the median raphe and hyoid bone. Sometimes the fleshy fibres are here! and there continuous with those of the other side. Each of them is somewhat' arched, so that the whole sheet has a slight downward convexity. The muscles of i the two sides together form a curved diaphragm which stretches across the angle \ contained between the two portions of the mandible. | Nerve-supply.—From the third division of the fifth cranial nerve, by the mylo- \ hyoid branch of the inferior dental which enters the under surface of the muscle bv several filaments. | | Action.—(1) To raise the tongue, the floor of the mouth, and the hyoid bone, as i in mastication and the first part of swallowing. By its elevation of the hyoid bone it will also exert some influence on the larynx and lower part of the pharynx. These actions will be most efficiently carried out when the jaw is closed. (2)| ' Acting from below, it will help in the depression of the lower jaw and in opening! ( the mouth. Relation.—Upon its under surface lie the superficial portion of the submaxillary j j gland, the submental artery, and the anterior belly of the digastric muscle. Above,: , it is in contact with the genio-hyoid and hyo-giossus, the sublingual gland, the] ' deep portion of the submaxillary gland, and the hypoglossal nerve. j Variations.—The mylo-hyoid may be closely connected with the anterior belly of the; - digastric. Openings are sometimes found in the muscular sheet, containing lobules of the submaxillary gland. I 4. GENIO-HYOID j \ The genio-hyoid—named from its attachment to the chin {yeveiov) and the^ hyoid bone—is somewhat fusiform, but flattened from above downwards below and from side to side above. 1 Origin.—The lower genial tubercle. j , Insertion.—The upper and anterior surface of the body of the hyoid bone. j Structure.—Arising by a short tendon, its fibres pass backwards and shghtl3| downwards, close to those of the felloAv muscle of the other side. Near the hyoicj bone they spread out laterally, and occupy nearly the whole of the upper ancj anterior surface of the body, sometimes even a small portion of the greater cornn. 1 I Nerve-supply.—The hypoglossal nerve, which sends filaments to the deepj - surface. ' Action.—(1) To raise and draw forwards the hyoid bone ; (2) to draw down th( i mandible. In its direction and action it is closely related to the anterior belly o: i the digastric. ^ Relations.—Superficially, the mylo-hyoid muscle ; deeply, the genio-hyo glossus ; on its median surface, with its fellow. j S Variations.—The genio-hyoid may be double, or it may form one muscle with its feUov, ■ of the opposite side. | j THE EXTEINSIC MUSCLES OF THE TONGUE i ' \ The tongue consists chiefly of muscular tissue, part of which arises from tb j adjacent bones, while the rest is made up of bands of fibre which pass longitudinally | j or transversely in its substance, and have no external attachment. The latter o:| I ■481 GENIO-HYO-GLOSS US~HYO-GLOSS US titrinsic muscles will be described later ; the former or extrinsic muscles constitute , group which is nearly related to those which have been just described. They ionsist of four muscles—viz. the genio-hyo-glossus, the hyo-giossus, the stylo- 'iossus, and palato-glossus. 1. GENIO-HYO-GLOSSUS The genio-hyo-glossus—named from its attachment to the chin (yevecov), hyoid [one, and tongue (yAcoo-o-a), is a flat sheet forming the quadrant or, more correctly, he sector of a circle, and separated from its fellow by a thin stratum of connective issue, the septum of the tongue. Origin.—The upper genial tubercle. Insertion.—(1) The whole length of the tongue in the submucous tissue just xternal to the median plane, from the ti]3 along the dorsum to the root of the bngue; (2) the upper part of the upper and anterior surface of the body of the ! yoid bone ; (3) by a few fibres into the side of the pharynx. ' Structure.—Its origin is by a short tendon, from which its fleshy fibres diverge a a fan-shaped sheet to their extensive insertion. I Nerve-supply.—The hypoglossal, by filaments which enter its outer surface. Action.—(1) To draw downwards and forwards the mesial portion of the tongue |o as to make its dorsum concave upwards in a transverse direction; (2) by its interior fibres to draw back the tip of the protruded tongue ; (3) by fibres which 'ass to the back part of the dorsum of the tongue to draw it forwards, and protrude he tongue ; (4) by its lowest fibres to draw upwards and forwards the hyoid bone, nd so help the genio-hyoid and anterior belly of the digastric in raising the bngue ; (5) acting from below, its hyoid portion will help in depressing the lower Relations.—Externally, the inferior lingualis and hyo-glossus muscles, the anine artery, the terminal branches of the hypoglossal and lingual gustatory lerves, the mucous membrane of the floor of the mouth, the sublingual gland, and Vharton's duct; internally, the fellow muscle and septum linguae ; along its lower 'lorder, the genio-hyoid muscle. I 2. HYO-GLOSSUS I The hyo-glossus—named from its attachments to the hyoid bone and tongue [yAwo-o-a)—is a thin square sheet. I Origin.—(1) From the front of the hyoid bone near the upper border of the outer bird of its body ; (2) from the upper border of all its great cornu ; (8) by a small 'lip from the lesser cornu. Insertion.—The submucous tissue and adjacent muscular mass of the posterior lalf of the tongue external to the preceding. Structure.—The fleshy fibres arise directly from the bone in a thin sheet, and [scend nearly parallel to one another. The anterior fibres, however, diverge slightly jDrwards, and they all, having reached the upper surface of the sides of the tongue, end round inwards, interlacing with the fibres of the palato-glossus and superficial mgualis to form a submucous cover to the tongue. Those which arise from the lesser cornu are often described as a distinct jauscle, the chondro-glossus, which is separated from the rest of the muscle by jome bundles which pass from the lower part of the genio-hyo-giossus to the juperior constrictor. I Nerve-supply.—The hypoglossal nerve, which sends filaments into its outer lurface. A IITHE MUSCLES 482 Action.—(1) To draw downwards the sides of the tongue, increasing its trans- verse convexity ; (2) to draw backwards the protruded tongue. Relations.—Externally, the mylo-hyoid, digastric, stylo-hyoid, and stylo- glossus muscles, the lingual vein, lingual gustatory and hypoglossal nerves, the submaxillary gland and Wharton's duct; deeply, the inferior lingualis, genio- hyo-glossus, middle constrictor, and part of the origin of the superior constrictoi', the lingual artery, and giosso-pharyngeal nerve. Fig. 315.—Side View of the Muscles of the Tongue. of 3. STYLO-GLOSSUS The stylo-glossus—named from its attachments to the styloid process anc tongue (yAtoa-ora)—is a long, triangular sheet. Origin.—(1) The front of the lower part and tip of the styloid process of th( temporal bone ; (2) the upper part of the stylo-maxillary ligament. j Insertion.—The submucous tissue and subjacent muscular strata of the side o:i the tongue and the adjacent parts of its under surface. Structure.—Arising by short tendinous fibres, the muscle soon develops into i long, fan-shaped, laterally-compressed sheet, which passes in a long curve, with ar upward concavity, forwards and slightly downwards and inwards, to the side of th( tongue, where it partly overlaps and partly interlaces with the hyo-giossus muscle forming with this muscle and some of the fibres of the palato-glossus a thir superficial stratum which is continued forwards to the tip of the tongue. Nerve-supply.—From the hypoglossal nerve, by filaments which enter it external surface. Action.—(1) To draw back the tongue—for this purpose it arises from th^ styloid process as low as possible below the level at which the two other styloi( j muscles arise; (2) to draw upwards the sides of the tongue, so as to help th i genio-hyo-glossi and some of the intrinsic muscles in making its upper surfac j concave from side to side.483 STYLO-GL OSS US—PA LA TO-GLOSS US Relations.—Superficially, the internal pterygoid, the parotid gland, hngual j-ustatory nerve, and the mucous membrane of the side of the tongue ; deeply, the Itylo-pharyngeus, hyo-giossus, inferior lingualis and genio-hyo-giossus, with the •losso-pharyngeal nerve. 4. PALATO-GLOSSUS The palato-glossus—named from its attachment to the soft palate and tongue yXwa-aa)—is a somewhat cylindrical muscle which expands at either end into a bm sheet. Origin.—The under surface of the aponeurosis of the soft palate ; and at he middle line its fibres are continuous with those of its fellow of the opposite 'kle. Insertion.—(1) The superficial muscular stratum which covers the side and djacent part of the under surface of the tongue ; (2) it is partly continuous with |ie deep transverse lingualis muscle. Structure.—Arising in a thin muscular sheet, its fibres form as they pass out- wards a small cylindrical bundle which, lying in front of the tonsil and against jie wall of the pharynx, constitutes the anterior pillar of the fauces. This bundle jms downwards and forwards till it reaches the side of the tongue at the junction i its middle and posterior thirds. Here some of the fibres pass forwards and pwnwards to join the superficial stratum formed by the stylo-giossus and hyo- lossus. The rest pass inwards towards the middle line, being continued into the Bep transverse lingualis muscle. This part of the two muscles, together with le associated portion of the lingualis transversus, forms a sphincter muscle round le front part of the faucial opening, j Nerve-supply.—Filaments from the pharyngeal plexus. Action.—(1) To draw downwards the sides of the soft palate ; (2) to draw )wards and backwards the sides of the tongue. The combination of these two tions closes the front part of the faucial opening, as in the second part of sallowing, when the back of the tongue comes into contact with the soft palate, id prevents the return of the food which is being grasped by the constrictors. Relations.—Superficially, it is covered by the mucous membrane of the soft date and the side of the tongue; deeply, it is in contact with the aponeurosis of |e soft palate, the superior constrictor of the pharynx, and the hyo-glossus ; hind it lies the tonsil. THE DEEP MUSCLES OF THE FEONT OF THE NECK j The deep muscles of the front of the neck consist of an inner and an outer |oup, separated from one another by the fine of the anterior tubercles of the Irvical vertebrte. Both groups are covered in front by the prevertebral fascia. Outer Group i The outer group is formed by the three scaleni, which pass from the first two •|>s upwards and inwards to the transverse processes. ii21 484 THE MUSCLES 1.

BARTHOLOMEW'S HOSPITAL MEDICAL SCHOOL, ETC., ETC. THE APiTEEIES rHE arteries are divided into the pulmonary and the systemic. The puhnonary convey the blood from the right ventricle of the heart to the lungs, whence is returned, when aerated, by the pulmonary veins to the left auricle, and through lat cavity into the left ventricle. The systemic arteries carry the blood from the )ft ventricle all over the body, whence it is returned by the veins to the right iiiricle, and through it to the right ventricle. The lungs also receive blood from the /stemic arteries—the bronchial. This blood which serves for the nourishment of 16 larger and smaller branches of the bronchial tubes and the lung substance is ^turned, in part by the bronchial veins to the general venous circulation, and thence ) the right side of the heart; and in part by the pulmonary veins, along with the srated blood, to the left side of the heart. THE PULMONARY ARTERY The pulmonary artery (fig. 317) passes from the right ventricle to the lungs, i differs from all other arteries in the body in that it contains venous blood. It rises as a short, thick trunk from the upper and front part of the right ventricle aown as the conns arteriosus, and, after a course of about two inches within the sricardium—the serous layer of which membrane forms a common sheath for it ad the aorta—divides into a right and left branch, which pierce the pericardium, ad pass to the right and left lung respectively. The trunk of the pulmonary artery at its origin (fig. 319) is on a plane Qterior to the first portion of the arch of the aorta, and slightly overlaps that vessel, 'hence it passes upwards, backwards, and to the left, forming a slight curve round 16 front and left side of the ascending portion of the aorta (fig. 321); and, ha\ing iached the concavity of the transverse portion of the aortic arch, on a level with the fth thoracic vertebra, and on a plane posterior to the ascending aorta, it di\^des into s right and left branches, which diverge from each other at an angle of about 130°. ' In the foetus, the pulmonary artery (fig. 318) continues its course upwards, back- ards, and to the left, under the name of the ductus arteriosus, or ductus Botalli,THE ABTEBIES 492 and opens into the descending aorta just below the origin of the left subclavian artery. After birth, that portion of the pulmonary artery which extends to the aorta becomes obhterated, and remains merely as a fibrous cord. The trunk of the artery with the ductus Botalh was originally the left fifth aortic arch, and the recurrent laryngeal nerve in early foetal life passed below it direct to the larynx. As in the process of development the heart descends into the thorax, and the fifth arch assumes a more vertical direction, it comes to pass that the nerve winds round the transverse portion of the aorta, the fourth aortic arch, and consequently external to the ductus arteriosus (fig. 321). In adult life the cord formed Fig. 317. Anterior View of the Heart with the Large Arteries and Veins. (By permission. Royal College of Surgeons Museum.)

THE SYSTEMIC AETEEIES THE AORTA The aorta is the main systemic arterial trunk, and from it all the systemic 'teries are derived. It begins at the left ventricle of the heart, and, after running short distance upwards and to the right, turns backwards and to the left, and then )wnwards, forming the arch of the aorta. It is thence continued through the lorax as the thoracic aorta, and finally enters the abdomen at the aortic opening the diaphragm, and, passing through the abdominal cavity under the name of .6 abdominal aorta, terminates opposite the fourth lumbar vertebra in the right id left common iliac arteries. From the point of bifurcation a small vessel is ntinued down the middle line in front of the sacrum and coccyx, and ends in the ,'Ccygeal glomerulus. This vessel (known as the middle sacral) is usually regarded, jorphologically, as the sacral and coccygeal aorta ; while the coccygeal glomerulus ! believed to represent the rudiments of the caudal aorta, with probably a persistent '^rt of the post-anal gut. I !

Thence it passes upwards and slightly forwards and to the right, as high as the level of the upper border of the second costal cartilage of the right side ; and then, curving backwards, upwards, and to the left, crosses behind the sternum at the level of the middle of the manubrium ; and, reaching the left side of the body of the fourth thoracic vertebra, runs downwards on the side of the body of that and the fifth thoracic vertebra, at the lower border of which it terminates in the Fig. 321.—The Arch of the Aorta, with the Pulmonary Artery and Chief Branches of the Aorta.

K K 2500 THE ABTEBIES Variations in the Arch of the Aorta The variations that have been met with in the aortic arch are very numerous. Only the chief can be here mentioned. They may be divided into :—1. Variations in the arcli itself; and 2. Variations in the number and arrangement of the three chief branches. The variations in the coronary arteries are described under Coronary Arteries, page 503. (1) Variations in the Aortic Arch itself The variations in the aortic arch itself may for the most part be traced to abnormalities in development of the embryonic structm^es from which the three portions of the arch and the pulmonary arteries and ductus arteriosus are derived, i.e. {a) the primitive ventral aortic stem; (h) the fourth and fifth branchial arches; and (c) the dorsal aortic stems. Fig. 325.—Scheme of the Eelations of the Third Portion of the Arch of the Aorta. {a) Variations dejjending on Abnormalities in Develojpment of the Ventral Aortic Stem These variations are closely associated with abnormalities of the pulmonary artery an heart. They depend upon deficient development of the septum which normally divide the anterior stem into the first portion of the aorta and the pulmonary artery. The follov ing are some of the chief variations :— (1) The aorta and pulmonary artery may arise as a single stem from a simple heari The septum here is completely absent. The condition resembles the normal state in fishe; (2) The aorta and pulmonary artery may be more or less conjoined, and the septum ( the heart incomplete. This is analogous to the normal condition in reptiles. (3) The aorta and pulmonary artery may be transposed. i (4) The aorta or pulmonary artery may be in part obliterated, and the blood carrie into the remainder of the affected vessel through an abnormal opening beyond ttj obliterated part. (5) Variations depending on Ahnormalities in Develojwient of the Fourth | and Fifth Aortic or Branchial Arches (1) The aorta may be double, the normal condition in amphibians, each arch giving ( a corresponding carotid and subclavian artery. This abnormality is explained by tl persistence of the right fourth aortic arch and right descending aortic stem, as well as tj; corresponding parts on the left side. The trachea and oesophagus pass through the arteri circle thus formed. (2) The aortic arch may turn over the right bronchus instead of over the left. This j the normal condition in birds, and is explained by the persistence of the right four aortic arch and right descending aortic stem and the obliteration of the correspond! parts on the left side. (3) The pulmonary artery may be given off from the aorta. This condition is due ; the obliteration of the anterior part of the fifth branchial arch and the persistence of 1 posterior part which normally constitutes the ductus arteriosus. jVARIATIONS IN ABCH OF AOBTA 501 (c) Variations defending on Abnormalities in DevelopmeJit of the Dorsal Aortic Stems The right subclavian may arise from the third part of the arch of the aorta. It [then passes behind the trachea and oesophagus, and in front of the vertebral column, to igain the interval between the scalene muscles. The explanation of this abnormality is [that the right fourth arch, from v^hich the right subclavian is normally developed, is iobhterated, whilst the right posterior aortic stem remains pervious as far as the spot where jit normally joins the right fourth arch, the blood thus passing through the aortic stem jinstead of the arch. The recurrent laryngeal nerve in these cases runs straight to the [ arynx, since, the fourth arch being obliterated, the nerve is no longer hooked down by it. [rhe rudiments of the right stem frequently persist as the aberrans branch of the superior [intercostal artery and thoracic aorta. , In addition to the above variations, the arch of the aorta may be higher or lower in she thorax than normal. In the former case it may cross the first bone of the sternum, just below, or even a little above, the sternal notch, and reach the side of the second or iihird thoracic vertebra instead of the fourth. In the latter case, that is, when it is situated lower in the thorax than normal, it may cross the sternum below the level of the manu- [jrium, and come into contact with the spine on a level with the fifth or sixth thoracic Kertebra. 2. The Chief Variations in the Three Primary Branches of the Transverse Portions of the Aortic Arch (1) AU may arise from a common stem: a condition explained on the supposition that ;he anterior aortic roots have become fused, and have so collected all the branches together. A similar condition is normal in the horse. This variation is rare. (2) They may arise as two stems : {a) One stem may be common to the right sub- jlavian, right carotid, and left carotid, the other stem being the left subclavian. This is me of the commonest variations in the arrangement of the primary branches. It is the iiormal condition in many mammals, and was formerly described as the normal condition p man. It is of some surgical interest, in that the left carotid when thus given oft' may iross in front of the trachea. (6) One stem may be common to the left subclavian, left arotid, and right carotid, the other stem being the right subclavian. In this variety the ight carotid passes in front of the trachea, (c) There may be two innominate arteries, ne stem forming the right, the other a left innominate artery as in birds, {d) One stem nay be common to the right and left carotid arteries, the other stem being the left ubclavian—the right subclavian in this case coming from the thoracic aorta. (3) They may arise as three stems ; but, in place of being given off in the normal way, {a) he right and left subclavian may come off separately, and the carotids arise by a common Item between the subclavians. This is the normal condition in some cetaceans. (6) The light subclavian and right carotid may arise separately, the left carotid and left subclavian jorming a left innominate stem, (c) The innominate may give off the left carotid, the feft vertebral, and left subclavian, the other two vessels arising from the arch. f (4) They may arise as four stems, which may be given off' in the following order : {a) Innominate, left carotid, left vertebral, left subclavian (the commonest condition); (6) right arotid, left carotid, left subclavian, right subclavian; (c) right subclavian, right carotid, 3ft carotid, left subclavian—the normal condition in the walrus and wombat. \ (5) They may arise as five stems, the five branches being given off in the following jrder: {a) right subclavian, right carotid, left carotid, left vertebral, left subclavian ; (6) ight carotid, left carotid, left vertebral, left subclavian, right subclavian ; (c) right carotid, 3ft carotid, left subclavian, left vertebral, right subclavian; {d) right subclavian, right xternal carotid, right internal carotid, left common carotid, left subclavian ; {e) innominate, light vertebral, left carotid, left vertebral, left subclavian. (6) They may arise as six stems, given off as follows : right subclavian, right vertebral, light carotid, left carotid, left vertebral, left subclavian. Beanches of the Aech of the Aokta 1. The ascending portion gives off—(1) Eight coronary ; (2) left coronary. ^ 2. The transverse portion gives off—(1) Innominate ; (2) left common carotid ; B) left subclavian. ' 8. The descending portion gives off no branch.502 THE ABTEBIES I. The branches of the first, or ascending, portion of the arch of the aorta are the right and left coronary for the supply of the tissues of the heart. They come off from the aorta, immediately above the aortic valves, from two of the dilatations known as the sinuses of Valsalva. THE EIGHT CORONARY ARTERY The right coronary artery (figs. 321, 326) arises from the right anterior sinus of Valsalva, and, passing forwards and to the right between the right auricular appendix and the pulmonary artery, turns to the right, and courses in the right auriculo-ventricular groove to the back of the heart, where it follows the poste- rior interventricular groove to the apex of the ventricles, giving off, however, a small transverse branch, which continues in the groove between the left auricle and ventricle to anastomose with the terminal branch of the left coronary artery. Fm. 326.—Scheme of the Coronary Arteries. Posterior interventricular branch of right coronarij artery AURICULAR APPENDAGE Right coronary artery Preventricular branch — Right marginal branch — Posterior intervejitriculfir — branch of right coronary artery In this course it gives off the following branches : (a) k right auricular brancli (fig. 326), which turns backwards and upwards between the right auf^icle and th aorta, supplying the structures between which it runs and the auricular septum (b) a preventricular branch (fig. 326), w^hich runs down the front of the righ ventricle, supplying its walls; (c) a right marginal branch (fig. 326), which course down the right margin of the right ventricle; {d) a posterior interventricula branch, or the continuation of the coronary trunk, which passes down the post(. rior interventricular groove, giving twigs to each ventricle and the interventricula j septum, and anastomosing at the apex of the heart with the anterior interventr j cular branch of the left coronary artery ; and (e) the transverse branch, which rur j in the left auriculo-ventricular groove to anastomose with the terminal branch of tt left coronary (fig. 326).503 THE INNOMINATE ABTEBY THE LEFT COEONAKY ARTERY The left coronary artery (figs. 321, 326), a little larger than the right, arises from the left anterior sinus of Valsalva, and, passing forwards and to the left between the pulmonary artery and left auricular appendix, courses round the heart in the left auriculo-ventricular groove to anastomose with the transverse branch of the right coronary artery. It gives off the following branches: (a) A left auricular branch, which supplies the left auricle, the pulmonary artery, and the commence- ment of the aorta, (b) A large anterior interventricular branch, which is larger than the continuation of the vessel between the auricle and ventricle, and is regarded by some as the main trunk of the left coronary artery. It courses down- wards in the anterior interventricular groove to the apex of the heart, where it forms a slight anastomosis with the posterior interventricular branch of the right vessel (fig. 324). It supplies both ventricles and the interventricular septum, (c) A left marginal branch, which runs down the left margin of the heart, supplying branches to the walls of the ventricle, (d) The terminal branch, the continuation [of the vessel, anastomoses with the transverse branch of the right coronary artery. I Variations in the Coronary Arteries \ {a) They may arise as a common trunk. (6) They may both arise from the same jsinus of Valsalva, (c) The interventricular and terminal branches of tlie left coronary may arise separately from the sinus of Valsalva, {d) One coronary artery may be larger than usual; the other vessel is tlien correspondingly small, {e) An extra coronary artery imay arise from tlie pulmonary artery, II. From the transverse part of the aortic arch are given off the innominate, the ileft common carotid, and the left subclavian arteries. The innominate and left carotid arise close together—indeed, so close that, when seen from the interior of the aorta, the orifices appear merely separated by a thin septum. The left subclavian arises a little less close to the left carotid. THE INNOMINATE ARTERY The innominate or bracliio-cephalic artery (fig. 321), the largest branch of the irch of the aorta, extends from near the commencement of the transverse portion, ipwards and a little forwards and to the right, as high as the upper limit of the ight sterno-clavicular joint where it bifurcates into the right common carotid and ight subclavian arteries. It lies obhquely in front of the trachea, and measures i'rom an inch and a half to two inches in length (about 4 cm.). Relations.—In front of the artery (fig. 327) are the manubrium, the origins )f the sterno-hyoid and sterno-thyroid muscles, the right sterno-clavicular joint md the remains of the thymus gland. The left innominate vein crosses the root )f the vessel, and the inferior thyroid veins descend obhquely over it to end in ihe left innominate vein. The inferior cervical cardiac branches of the right Dneumogastric pass in front of it on their way to the deep cardiac plexus. ^ Behind, it hes on the trachea, crossing that tube obliquely from left to right, and joming into contact above with the right pleura. To the right side are the right innominate vein, the right pneumogastric nerve, md the pleura. ' To the left side are the left common carotid, the remains of the thymus gland, ;he inferior thyroid veins ; and higher, the trachea.504 THE ABTEBIES Variations in the Innominate Artery The variations in the innominate artery are of surgical interest, {a) It may divide lower than normal, thus decreasing the available space for the application of a ligature to it, but at the same time increasing the length of the first portion of the right subclavian artery. (6) It may divide higher than usual, and may then incline abnormally to the left, mounting in front of the trachea above the sternum. Under these circumstances it is in danger in the low operation of tracheotomy, (c) When abnormally long and inclining to the left, it may pass behind the trachea or the oesophagus to gain the right side, {d) It may give off the thyroidea ima artery, and, more rarely the vertebral, the internal mammary or a smaller twig, as a bronchial, thymic, pericardiac, or tracheal branch. The branches of the innominate artery are : (1) The right common carotid ; and (2) the right subclavian. These are terminal branches. There are usually no col- lateral branches from this vessel, but at times the thyroidea ima may arise from it. Fig. 327.—Scheme of the Kelations of the Innominate Artery.

The external carotid supplie j the structures at the upper part of the front and side of the neck, the laryns i pharynx, tongue, face, the upper part of the back of the neck, the structures i:| the pterygoid region, the scalp, and in chief part the membranes of the brair The internal carotid gives off no branch in the neck, but enters the craniuri and supplies the greater part of the brain, the structures contained in the orbr and portions of the membranes of the brain. The common carotid artery on the right side arises from the bifurcation (iTHE COMMON CABOTID 505 the innominate behind the stenio-clavicular joint; on the left side from the arch of the aorta a httle to the left of the innominate artery, and on a somewhat posterior plane to that vessel (fig. 321). The portion of the left common carotid artery which extends from the arch of the aorta to the level of the sterno-clavicular irticulation hes deeply in the chest, and requires a separate description ; but above the level of the sterno-clavicular joint the relations of the right and left carotids are practically the same, and are given under the account of the right bommon carotid. THORACIC PORTION OF THE LEFT COMMON CAROTID ARTERY j Within the thorax the left common carotid is deeply placed behind the first bone bf the sternum, and is overlapped by the left lung and pleura. It arises from the aiiddle of the transverse portion of the aortic arch, close to the left side of the nnominate artery, and a little posterior to that vessel, and ascends obliquely in front 3f the trachea to the left sterno-clavicular articulation, above which its relations ire similar to those of the right common carotid.

To its left side, but on a posterior plane, are the left subclavian artery and tl left pneumogastric nerve; and, slightly overlapping it, the edge of the left pleu] and lung (fig. 328). The variations in the origin of the left common carotid are given under Variations ( THE Arch of the Aorta (page 500). THE COMMON CAROTID ARTERY IN THE NECK The common carotid artery in the neck extends from the sterno-cla\icul articulation to the upper border of the thyroid cartilage on a level with the four cervical vertebra where it divides into the external and internal carotid arterL A line drawn from the sterno-clavicular joint to the interval between the mastc process and the angle of the jaw would indicate its course. The artery is at fi] deeply placed beneath the sterno-mastoid, sterno-hyoid, and sterno-thyroid muscl and at the level of the top of the sternum is only three-quarters of an in (2 cm.) distant from its fellow of the opposite side, and merely separated frc it by the trachea. As the carotid arteries run up the neck, however, they diver in the form of a V and become more superficial, though on a plane posterior to tl in which they lie at the root of the neck, and are separated from each other by t larynx and pharynx. At their bifurcation they are about two inches and a quar (6 cm.) apart. The common carotid is contained in a sheath of fascia comm to it and the internal jugular vein and pneumogastric nerve. The artery, vej, and nerve, however, are not in contact, but separated from each other by fibre septa, which divide the common sheath into three compartments : one for i artery, one for the vein, and one for the nerve. The vein, which is larger tt the artery, lies to the outer side, and somewhat overlaps the artery. The pneur gastric nerve lies behind and between the two vessels. The vessel on the rLjt side measures about three and three-quarter inches (9*5 cm.), on the left side ab four and three-quarter inches (12 cm.). Relations.—In front the artery is covered by the skin, superficial fascia, platys] and deep fascia, and is more or less overlapped by the sterno-mastoid mus At the lower part of the neck it is covered in addition by the sterno-hyoid { sterno-thyroid muscles, and is crossed by the anterior jugular vein, and is of overlapped by the thyroid body. Opposite the cricoid cartilage it is crossed obliqi by the omo-hyoid muscle ; and above this spot by the middle and superior thyn the lingual, and generally the facial veins in their course to the internal jugulr, and by the middle sterno-mastoid artery as it passes from the superior thyroid art f its usual source, on its way down to the sterno-mastoid muscle. The descend |is hypoglossi nerve generally descends in front of the carotid sheath, being there joi jd by the communicantes hypoglossi, one or two small branches of the second and t] 1x1 cervical nerves. At times this nerve runs within the sheath. There are usually j'O lymphatic glands about the bifurcation of the artery. These are often fO|icl enlarged and infiltrated in cancer of the lip and tongue. j Behind, the common carotid lies on the longus colli below, and rectus caj jis anticus major above. Posterior to the artery, but in the same sheath, is the pneu b- gastric nerve ; and posterior to the sheath, the chain of the sympathetic and ,ie cervical cardiac branches of the sympathetic and pneumogastric nerves. At the Ic jer part of the neck the inferior thyroid artery courses obliquely behind the caroti( |as does likewise the recurrent laryngeal nerve. \ Internally, from below upwards, are the trachea and oesophagus, with the re r- rent laryngeal nerve in the groove between them, and the terminal branches oJ Lie507 THE COMMON CABOTID i Fig. 329.—The Common Carotid, the External and Internal Carotid and the Subclavian Arteries of the Eight Side and their Branches.

The incision is made in the line of the vessel parallel to the anterior margin of the sterno-mastoid muscle. The omo-hyoid forms one of the chief rallying points in the course of the operation for ligature of Ithe artery above that muscle, the usual situation. The artery is found beating at the jangle formed by the omo-hyoid with the sterno-mastoid. ! Branches.—(1) External and (2) internal carotid arteries. The common carotid gives off no lateral branches, and consequently does not diminish in size as it runs up the neck. It is often a little swollen just below its bifurcation. Variations of the Common Carotid Arteries The variations in the origin of the common carotid have been already mentioned iiiider Variations of the Chief Branches of the Aortic Arch (page 50]). The following variations are of surgical interest:— ;, (A) The artery may cross obliquely the lower part of the trachea above the level of the jsternimi. This may occur on the right side : (a) when the innominate is situated abnormally Ito the left of the middle line ; (6) when the right common carotid arises as the second branch 'af the aortic arch; and (c) when the right and left common carotids arise as a common stem from the aorta. On the left side : when the left common carotid arises from the innominate. (B) The right common carotid may, when arising from the aorta, run behind the zachea and oesophagus to the right side of the neck. (C) The commencement of the right common carotid may be above or below the jisual spot, according as the innominate bifurcates higher or lower than usual. A low pifurcation of the innominate is somewhat the more common abnormality. j (D) The common carotid may run in a very tortuous manner, forming one or more iistinct loops in its course up the neck. (E) The artery may bifurcate higher or lower than normal. A high bifurcation is the nore common. The bifurcation may occur as high as the hyoid bone, or even styloid brocess; or as low as the cricoid cartilage, or within an inch and a half of its origin. I (F) The artery may not bifurcate, but give oft' the branches usually derived from the 3xternal division as it ascends in the neck. (G) The common carotid may be absent, the external and internal carotids arising liirectly from the aorta. I (H) It may give off one or more of the branches usually derived from the external parotid. J (I) It may give off a thyroidea ima. • (J) The pneumogastric nerve may run in front of the artery instead of behind it. The collateral circulation (fig. 330), after ligature of the common carotid, is carried on ■hiefiy by the anastomosis of the internal carotid with the internal carotid of the opposite ide through the circle of Willis ; by the vertebral with the opposite vertebral; by the inferior hyroid with the superior thyroid; by the deep cervical branch of the superior intercostal vith the princeps cervicis of the occipital; by the superior thyroid, lingual, facial, occipital Lnd temporal, with the corresponding arteries of the opposite side, and by the ophthalmic Ivith the angular. , THE EXTEKNAL CAROTID ARTERY j The external carotid artery, the smaller of the two branches into which the ;ommon carotid divides at the upper border of the.thyroid cartilage, is distributed 0 the anterior part of the neck, the face, and the side of the head both soft parts and )ones, the integuments externally, and dura mater internally. It is development- Ily derived from the third aortic arch, and supplies the oral and post-oral visceral j)ranches. It is at first situated internal to the internal carotid ; but as it ascends m the neck it forms a gentle curve, with its convexity forwards, and, running shghtly lackwards as well as upwards, terminates opposite the neck of the jaw just below he condyle, by dividing into the internal maxillary and temporal arteries. It here ies superficial to the internal carotid, from which it is separated by a portion of he parotid gland. At its origin it is overlapped by the anterior margin of the sterno-mastoid, and is covered by the superficial fascia, platysma, and deep fascia.THE ABTEBIES 510 Higher up the neck it passes beneath the stylo-hyoid muscle, the posterior belly of the digastric muscle, and the hypoglossal nerve; and, entering the parotid gland, is situated deeply in that structure at its division into its terminal branches. It is separated from the internal carotid artery posteriorly by the stylo-pharyngeus and stylo-glossus muscles, the glosso-pharyngeal nerve, the pharyngeal branch of the pneumogastric nerve, a portion of the parotid gland, and the stylo-hyoid ligament; or, if the styloid process is abnormally long, by that process itself. It measures about two and a half inches (6'5 cm.). Relations (fig. 329). — In front, in addition to the skin, superficial fascia, platysma, and deep fascia, it has the hypoglossal nerve, the lingual and facial veins, the posterior belly of the digastricus and stylo-hyoid muscles, the temporo-maxillary ] vein, the superior cervical lymphatic glands, branches of the facial nerve, and the j parotid gland. The sterno-mastoid also overlaps it in the natural state of the parts.! Behind, it is in relation with.the internal carotid, from which it is separated j by the stylo-glossus and stylo-pharyngeus muscles, the glosso-pharyngeal nerve, the pharyngeal branch of the pneumogastric nerve, the stylo-hyoid ligament, and the ■ parotid gland. The superior laryngeal nerve crosses behind both the external and' internal carotid arteries. Internally, it is in relation with the hyoid bone, the pharyngeal wall, the ramus of the jaw, the stylo-maxillary ligament which separates it from the submaxillary ' gland, and the parotid gland. Externally, in the first part of its course, it is in contact with the internal carotid artery. Chief Variations of the External Carotid Artery The variations of the external carotid artery are not of much surgical importance. The variations in its origin have been discussed under Variations of the Common Carotid. (A) It may be absent, the branches usually derived from it coming off from the upward continuation of the common trunk. (B) It may run superficial to the stylo-hyoid muscle. (C) Its branches may come off irregularly; or may be diminished or increased ir number either by two or more arising as a common stem, or by its giving origin to branches not usually derived from it, as the sterno-mastoid branch of either the superior thyroid oj occipital artery. (D) At times all its branches come off close together just above its origin. The branches of the external carotid are usually given off in the following order j from below upwards :— 1. Ascending pharyngeal 2. Superior thyroid . 3. Lingual 4. Facial . 5. Occipital 6. Posterior auricular 7. Temporal 8. Internal maxillary Ascending set. Anterior set. Posterior set. Terminal set. 1. THE ASCENDING PHAEYNGEAL AKTEEY The ascending pharyngeal artery is usually the first or second branch of th external carotid. Occasionally it comes off at the bifurcation of the commo: carotid from the common carotid itself. It is a long slender vessel, the smalles named branch of the external carotid, and runs deeply seated up the neck to tb base of the skull, having the walls of the pharynx internally, the internal caroti llftl jlei iiscei] lnic lieii]THE ASCENDING PHABYNGEAL 511 •tery externally, and the vertebral column, the rectus capitis anticus major, and lie sympathetic nerve posteriorly. In front it is crossed by the stylo-pharyngeus uscle and giosso-pharyngeal nerve. Branches of the Ascending Pharyngeal Artery The ascending pharyngeal artery gives off the following branches:—(1) Pre- srtebral; (2) pharyngeal; (3) palatine ; (4) tympanic ; (5) meningeal. (1) The prevertebral are distributed to the recti muscles, the fascia in front of e vertebral column, and to the sympathetic nerve and lymphatic glands.

(4) The mpanic accompanies the tympanic branch of the giosso-pharyngeal nerve rough the tympanic canaliculus into the tympanum, and anastomoses with the her tympanic arteries. (5) The meningeal are distributed to the membranes the brain. Some of these pass with the jugular vein through the jugular iramen into the cranium, and supply the dura mater in the posterior fossa ofTHE ABTEBIES 512 the skull. Others occasionally reach the same fossa through the anterior condyloi foramen ; while others pass through the cartilage of the middle lacerated forame and supply the middle fossa of the skull. i 2. THE SUPEEIOR THYROID ARTERY The superior thyroid artery arises from the front of the external carotid little above the origin of that vessel, and, coursing forwards, inwards, and th( downwards, in a tortuous manner, supplies the depressor muscles of the hyoid bon the larynx, the thyroid body, and the lower part of the pharynx. The artery first runs forwards and a little upwards, just beneath the greater cornu of t] Fig. 332.—Scheme of Superior Thyroid Artery Facial arter'i ■—— P\ ^ External carotid artery Ascending pharyngeal arteri Lingual arterv Supra-hyoid branch Infra-hyoid branch Superior laryngeal branch '\^^^') ^ / 1 ^ Internal carotid artery ' 1/ -FTC - -Tm Crico-thyroid branch Steriio-mastoid branch Superior thyroid artery Common carotid artery Inferior thyroid artery hyoid bone. In this part of its course it lies in the superior carotid triangle, ar quite superficial, being covered only with the integument, fascia, and platys It next turns downwards, and passes beneath the omo-hyoid, sterno-hyoid, sterno-thyroid muscles, and ends at the upper part of the thyroid body by brea. up into branches, some of which pass downwards in front, and others behind lateral lobe of that structure to anastomose with ascending branches from inferior thyroid ; whilst others, again, but much smaller in size, pass in the subst of the isthmus across the front of the trachea to anastomose with the sup' thyroid artery of the opposite side. These vessels, however, are so small, thati: isthmus is divided accurately in the middle line, there is practically no art| haemorrhage. From the branch to the thyroid body twigs are given off tc: inferior constrictor and the upper part of the oesophagus. These anastomose |513 SUPEBIOB THYBOID—LINGUAL branches from the inferior thyroid. The superior thyroid vein passes beneath the artery on its way to the internal jugular vein. The superior thyroid is the artery most commonly divided in cases of suicidal wounds of the throat. j Beanches of the Bupekior Thyroid Artery The named branches of the superior thyroid artery are : ■—(1) The hyoid ; (2) the iterno-mastoid ; (3) the superior laryngeal; and (4) the crico-thyroid. i (1) The hyoid—or infra-hyoid branch as it is sometimes called, usually a small wig—passes along the lower border of the hyoid bone, lying on the thyro-hyoid jtiembrane under cover of the thyro-hyoid and sterno-hyoid muscles. It suppHes jhe infra-hyoid bursa, and the thyro-hyoid muscle, and anastomoses with its fellow if the opposite side, and with the supra-hyoid branch of the lingual. When the jitter artery is small, the infra-hyoid is usually comparatively large, and vice ersa. (2) The sterno-mastoid (fig. 332)—or middle mastoid artery as it is occasionally illed—courses downwards and backwards across the carotid sheath, and entering le sterno-mastoid supplies the middle portion of that muscle. It gives off slender vigs to the thyro-hyoid, sterno-hyoid, and omo-hyoid muscles, and the platysma iad integuments covering it. At times the vessel arises directly from the external iirotid. It lies usually somewhere in the upper part of the incision for tying the )mmon carotid, above the omo-hyoid muscle. (8) The superior laryngeal (fig. 329) passes inwards and forwards beneath le thyro-hyoid muscle, and, perforating the thyro-hyoid membrane along with the iperior laryngeal nerve, supplies the intrinsic muscles and mucous lining of the irynx. Its further distribution within the larynx is given with the description of jiat organ. This branch sometimes arises from the external carotid direct. It ay enter the larynx by passing through a foramen in the thyroid cartilage. (4) The crico-thyroid—or inferior laryngeal branch as it is sometimes called, sually insignificant in size—passes across the crico-thyroid membrane immediately beath the lower border of the thyroid cartilage. It anastomoses with its fellow ' the opposite side, and usually sends a small branch through the membrane to the interior of the larynx. It has, however, frequently been seen of com- batively large size—once as large as the radial, and crossing the membrane jiliquely. In order to avoid injuring the crico-thyroid artery in the operation of ryngotomy, it is usual, if the operation has to be done in a hurry, to make the cision through the crico-thyroid membrane in a transverse direction, and as near the cricoid cartilage as possible. (3. THE LINGUAL ARTERY The lingual artery (fig. 333) arises from the front of the external carotid, Itween the superior thyroid and facial arteries, often, as a common trunk with flatter vessel, and nearly opposite or a little below the greater cornu of the hyoid ne. It may, for purposes of description, be divided into three portions: the first, oblique, extends from its origin to the outer edge of the hyo-glossus muscle ; the cond, or horizontal, lies beneath the hyo-glossus; the third, or ascending, beneath e tongue. The first or oblique portion is situated in the superior carotid tangle, and is superficial, being covered merely by the integuments, platysma, d deep fascia. Here it lies on the middle constrictor muscle and superior l-yngeal nerve. After ascending a short distance, it curves downwards and -wards beneath the hypoglossal nerve, and, in the second part of its course, runs rizontally along the upper border of the hyoid bone, beneath the hyo-glossus.THE ABTEBIES 514 by which it is separated from the hypoglossal nerve, the posterior belly of th digastricus and the stylo-hyoid muscles, and the lingual vein. In this part of it course it lies successively on the middle constrictor of the pharynx and the geni( hyo-giossus muscle. In the third part of its course it ascends tortuously, usual] beneath the anterior margin of the hyo-glossus, to the under surface of the tongin Fig. 333.—Scheme of the Lingual Artery.

Branches of the Lingual Artery The named branches of the lingual artery are:—(1) The hyoid; (2) the dors; linguae; (3) the sublingual; and (4) the ranine. (1) The hyoid, or supra-hyoid (fig. 833), is a small vessel which arises from e first part of the lingual, and courses along the upper border of the hyoid be ^ superficial to the hyo-glossus, but beneath the insertion of the posterior bell; )f the digastricus and stylo-hyoid. It anastomoses with its fellow of the oppoie side, and with the infra-hyoid, a branch of the superior thyroid artery, |d supplies the contiguous muscles. j (2) The dorsalis linguae (fig. 333) arises from the second portion of the lin^ il artery, usually under cover of the posterior edge of the hyo-glossus muscle. Et ascends to the back of the dorsum of the tongue, and, dividing into branc |s, supplies the mucous membrane on each side of the V formed by the circumva) jfce papillae. It also supplies the pillars of the fauces and the tonsil, where it ansp- moses with the other faucial and tonsillar arteries. Instead of a single arterjas above described, there may be several small vessels running directly to the pjts mentioned. The artery anastomoses in the mucous membrane by very small bran jes with the vessel of the opposite side; but the anastomosis is so minute that ^ one lingual artery is injected, the injection merely passes across -to the opp |te515 LING UAL—FA CIAL ide at the tip of the tongue ; and when the tongue is divided accurately in the Iniddle Une, as in the removal of one half of that organ, practically no haemorrhage ')ccurs. (3) The sublingual artery (fig. 333) usually comes off from the lingual at the .nterior margin of the hyo-giossus. It passes beneath the mylo-hyoid to the jublingual gland, which it supplies, and, perforating the muscle, anastomoses jnth the submental artery, a branch of the facial. It also supphes branches to jhe side of the tongue, and gives off a terminal twig, which anastomoses beneath he mucous mem.brane of the floor of the mouth (to which it also gives twigs) with jhe artery of the opposite side. The artery of the frsenum is usually derived from tiis vessel (fig. 333). (4) The ranine artery, the termination of the lingual, courses forwards beneath be mucous membrane, on the under surface of the tongue, to the tip. It lies xternal to the genio-hyo-glossus, between that muscle and the inferior linguahs, nd is accompanied by the ranine vein and terminal branch of the gustatory nerve, t follows a very tortuous course, so that it is not stretched when the tongue is rotruded. Branches are given off from it to the contiguous muscles and mucous bembrane. Near the tip of the tongue it communicates with its fellow of the oppo- fte side, as shown by the fact that when the hngual artery of one side is injected le injection fluid passes into the branches of the artery of the other side. 4. THE FACIAL AETEEY The facial artery (fig. 334)—also called the external maxillary—arises imme- iately above the lingual from the fore part of the external carotid, at times a common trunk with the lingual. It courses forwards and upwards in a )rtuous manner to the lower jaw, and, passing over the body of this bone at the aterior edge of the masseter muscle, winds obliquely upwards and forwards over 16 face to the inner canthus of the eye, where it inosculates, under the name of le angular artery, with the nasal branch of the ophthalmic. It is usually divided ito two portions—the cervical and the facial. The cervical portion (fig. 334) ascends tortuously from its origin from the eternal carotid upwards and forwards beneath the posterior belly of the digastric pd stylo-hyoid muscles, and usually also beneath the hypoglossal nerve, and then [laking a turn runs horizontally forwards for a short way beneath the jaw, either abedded in or lying under the submaxillary gland. It has here the mylo-hyoid and ylo-glossus beneath it. On leaving the cover of the gland it forms a loop passing bt wards and then upwards over the lower border of the jav/ immediately in iont of the masseter muscle, where it is superficial, being merely covered by the in- Igument and platysma. Here it can be felt beating, and can be readily compressed. 1 the above course it lies in the posterior part of the submaxillary triangle, and, addition to the structures already mentioned as crossing it, is covered by the dn, superficial fascia, and platysma, and by one or two submaxillary lymphatic ands. The vein is separated from the artery by the submaxillary gland, the )sterior belly of the digastric muscle, the stylo-hyoid muscle, and the hypoglossal )rve. The facial portion (fig. 334) of the facial artery ascends tortuously forwards 'Wards the angle of the mouth, passing under the platysma (risorius) and zygomatic uscles and the supramaxillary and buccal branches of the facial nerve. It here 3 upon the jaw and the buccinator muscle. Thence it courses upwards by the e of the nose towards the inner canthus of the eye, being covered by the levator ijitji^l |bii superioris, levator labii superioris alseque nasi, and infraorbital branches of le facial nerve, and lying on the levator anguli oris (sometimes on the levator L L 2 Ik Id i0THE ARTEBIES 516 labii superioris, instead of below it) and tlie infraorbital branches of tbe fifth nerve. The facial vein takes a much straighter course than the artery, is separated from it by the zygomatic muscles, and lies to its outer side. Fig. 334.—Scheme of the Facial Artery.

One of these brandies, the palatine, passes with the levator palati over tie curved upper margin of the superior constrictor to the soft palate, where it is jstributed to the tissues constituting that structure, and anastomoses with its How of the opposite side and with the descending palatine branch of the internal laxillary, and the ascending pharyngeal, which vessel often to a great extent ipplies the place of this artery. The other branch, the tonsillar, supplies the nsil and the Eustachian tube, anastomosing with the tonsillar branch of the facial id ascending pharyngeal arteries. The ascending palatine artery supplies the luscles between which it runs on its way to the palate. i (2) The tonsillar branch (hg. 334) ascends between the stylo-glossus and internal jerygoid muscles to the level of the tonsil, where it perforates the superior con- dctor muscle of the pharynx, and ends in the tonsil, anastomosing with the tonsillar anch of the ascending palatine and with the other tonsillar arteries (fig. 333). gives branches also to the root of the tongue. ; (3) The glandular or submaxillary branches are distributed to the submaxil jry giand as the artery is passing through or beneath that structure. A small ig from one of these branches usually supplies Wharton's duct. > (4) The muscular branches are small twigs given off irregularly to the contiguous :ascles, viz. the posterior belly of the digastric, the stylo-hyoid, the stylo-glossus, iid the mylo-hyoid muscles. \ (5) The submental branch (fig. 334) comes off from the facial as the latter vessel ]|!s under cover of the submaxillary gland, and, passing forwards on the mylo-hyoid iliscle between the base of the jaw and the anterior belly of the digastricus, iipplies these structures and the overlying platysma and integuments. It gives (j the followung small branches :—(a) muscular, to the muscles between which it ]QS; [b) perforating, which passes through the mylo-hyoid to anastomose with I3 sublingual; (c) cutaneous, to the integuments covering it; {d) mental, which 1ms over the border of the lower jaw near the symphysis, and, after supplying a Imch to the depressor labii inferioris, the levator menti, and the other adjacent ^[t tissues forming the chin and lip, anastomoses with the mental branch of the i'erior dental, the inferior labial, and the artery of the opposite side. \ Beanches of the Facial Arteey on the Face From the outer or concave side of the artery are given off:—(1) masseteric hnches which ascend over the masseter to anastomose with the masseteric Unch of the internal maxillary artery and the transverse facial artery; and (2) Iccal, which pass upwards over the buccinator and anastomose with the buccal hnchof the internal maxillary, the transverse facial, and the infraorbital arteries. From the inner or convex side the following larger and named vessels are given c:—(1) The inferior labial; (2) the inferior coronary ; (3) the superior coronary ; ( the lateralis nasi; and (5) the angular. (1) The inferior labial artery arises either separately from the facial artery, or ij common with the next branch—the inferior coronary. It courses forwards t!ieath the depressor anguli oris, and over the depressor labii inferioris, and, after sl)plying the contiguous muscles and integuments, anastomoses below with the sbmental, above with the inferior coronary, and between the two with the mental l\nGh of the inferior dental which escapes from the mental foramen. (2) The inferior coronary artery arising from the facial a little above the i518 THE ABTEBIES inferior labial, or in common with it, passes forwards beneath the depressor anguli oris towards the angle of the mouth, thence skirts along the lower lip, between the mucous membrane and orbicularis oris, about a quarter to half an inch from the junction of the skin and mucous membrane, and anastomoses with its fellow of the opposite sidec It can readily be felt beating during life by pressing the lip between finger and thumb. It gives off descending branches which anastomose with the inferior labial and the mental branch of the inferior dental. (3) The superior coronary artery, arising from the facial a little higher than the inferior coronary, passes forwards beneath the zygomaticus major, and then, like the inferior coronary, courses tortuously along the lower margin of the uppei lip between the orbicularis oris and the mucous membrane about half an inch from the junction of the mucous membrane and the skin. It is usually larger than the inferior coronary. The superior coronary anastomoses with its fellow of the opposite side, and gives off a small artery to the septum—arteria septum narium Compression of this vessel will sometimes control haemorrhage from the nose. In the operation for hare lip, the pin or suture should be passed sufficiently dee]: to transfix the divided coronary artery, or hemorrhage may continue into the moutk Bleeding from either coronary vessel can be readily controlled by the thumb and forefinger grasping the lip. (4) The lateral nasal artery (fig. 334) is a small twig or twigs given off from thf facial opposite the ala of the nose. It passes forwards over the ala and lower part o: the nose, supplying the integuments, muscles, and cartilages, and anastomoses witl the artery of the septum, the vessel of the opposite side, and the nasal branchei of the ophthalmic. (5) The angular artery (fig. 334) is the name given to the termination of th( facial artery. It anastomoses at the inner canthus of the eye with the nasa branch of the ophthalmic. It is accompanied by the anterior descending veil from the scalp. It lies to the inner side of the lachrymal sac, and supplie that structure and the lower part of the orbicularis oculi, beneath which a brand anastomoses with the infraorbital artery. The situation of the artery to the inne side of the lachrymal sac should be borne in mind in opening a lachrymal abscess 5. THE OCCIPITAL AETERY The occipital artery (fig. 335) is usually a vessel of considerable size. 1 comes off from the posterior part of the external carotid opposite the facial, or els a little higher than that vessel. It then winds upwards and backwards to th interval between the mastoid process of the temporal bone and transverse proces of the atlas, and, after running horizontally backwards in the occipital groo\' on the mastoid portion of the temporal bone, again turns upwards, and ends b ramifying in the scalp over the back of the skull, extending as far forwards as tb vertex. The vessel may be divided into three parts—viz. that internal to the sterm mastoid muscle ; that beneath the sterno-mastoid; and that external to the stern( mastoid. In the first part of its course the occipital artery is covered by the integumem and fascia, and is more or less overlapped by the posterior belly of the digastr: muscle, the parotid gland, and temporo-maxillary vein. It is crossed by the hyp glossal nerve as the latter winds forwards over the carotid vessels to reach the tonguj It successively crosses in front of the internal carotid artery, the hypoglossal nerv the pneumogastric nerve, the internal jugular vein, and the spinal accessory nerv In the second part of its course it sinks deeply beneath the digastric muse into the interval between the mastoid process of the temporal bone and the tranOCCIPITAL 519 iverse process of the atlas. It is here covered by the sterno-mastoid, splenius capitis, and trachelo-mastoid muscles and by the origin of the digastricus; and lies, first on the rectus capitis lateralis, which separates it from the vertebral artery, then in the occipital groove on the mastoid portion of the temporal bone, and then on the jinsertion of the superior oblique muscle. In the third part of its course it enters the triangular interval formed by the diverging borders of the splenii capitis and the superior curved line of the occipital bone. Here it lies beneath the integuments and the aponeurosis uniting the occipital Fig. 335.—Scheme of Occipital and Posterior Auricular Arteries. Anterior hranch of posterior auricular ^Posterior hranch of posterior auricular PAROTID GLAND Sterno-mastoid, cut Auricular branch of occipital Rectus capitis lateralis SPINAL ACCESSORY NERVE Posterior auricular Internal jugular vein Facial artery HYPOGLOSSAL NERVE Lingual arterii PNEUMOGASTRIC NERVE Superior thyroid Common carotid External hranch of occipital — Internal hranch of occipital Complexus I'rinceps cervicis Superior obligrie Traehelo-mastoid, cut Splenius capitis, cut Meningeal branches Sterno-mastoid hranch of occipital Internal carotid Sterno-mastoid Erteryial carotid Trapezius attachments of the sterno-mastoid and trapezius, and rests upon the complexus just before the insertion of that muscle into the occipital bone. In company with the great occipital nerve, it perforates either this aponeurosis, or less often the posterior belly of the occipito-frontalis, and follows roughly, but in a tortuous course, the line of the lambdoid suture lying between the integument and the cranial aponeurosis. In the scalp it divides into several large branches, which ramify over the back of the skull and reach as far forwards as the vertex. ^ They anastomose with the corresponding branches of the opposite side, and with the posterior auricular, and the superficial temporal arteries.THE ABTERIES 520 Branches of the Occipital Aetery The branches of the occipital artery are:—(1) The sterno-mastoid ; (2) the ; posterior meningeal; (3) the auricular ; (4) the mastoid ; (5) the princeps cervicis ; I (6) the communicating; (7) the muscular; and (8) the terminal. The sterno- ! mastoid, posterior meningeal, auricular, and princeps cervicis are the four vessels ' usually named amongst the above branches. i (1) The sterno-mastoid branch (fig. 335) usually comes off from the occipital I just after its origin from the carotid, and, passing downwards and backwards over j the loop of the hypoglossal nerve, enters the sterno-mastoid muscle in company with j the spinal accessory nerve. At times this artery is a distinct branch of the external carotid. The hypoglossal nerve then as a rule loops round it instead of round the I occipital. j (2) The posterior meningeal branches (fig. 335), one or more in number, are ' long slender vessels which leave the occipital artery as it crosses the internal jugular ' vein, and, ascending along that vessel, pass with it through the jugular foramen, i and are distributed to the dura mater lining the posterior fossa of the skull. (3) The auricular branch ascends over the mastoid process to the back of the ear, and supplies the pinna and concha. It sometimes takes the place of the ' posterior auricular artery (fig. 335). (4) The mastoid branch is a small twig that passes into the skull through the ] mastoid foramen, supplying the dura mater, the diploe, the walls of the lateral sinus and the mastoid cells. (5) The princeps cervicis (fig. 335), the largest of the branches of the occipital, arises from that artery just before it emerges from beneath the splenius, and, descending for a short distance between the splenius and complexus, divides into a superficial and a deep branch. The superficial branch perforates the splenius, supplies branches to the trapezius, and anastomoses with the superficial cervical, a branch of the transverse cervical artery. The deep branch passes downwards between the complexus and semispinalis colli, and anastomoses with the deep cervical branch of the superior intercostal and with branches of the vertebral (fig. 338). The ana- i stomoses between the above-mentioned arteries form important collateral channels after ligature of the common carotid and subclavian arteries (fig. 330). (6) The communicating branches run deeply into the triangle formed by the superior oblique, inferior oblique, and rectus capitis posticus major muscles, and ; there anastomose with branches of the vertebral. (7) Muscular branches throughout the course of the occipital artery are dis- I tributed to the contiguous muscles—viz. in addition to the sterno-mastoid which receives a named branch, to the digastricus, stylo-hyoid, splenius, trachelo-mastoid, i trapezius, the small muscles forming the suboccipital triangle, and the posterior ! belly of the occipito-frontalis. (8) The terminal or superficial branches (fig. 335), usually two in number, named from their position internal and external, ramify over the scalp, and have already been described. The internal branch generally gives off a twig which enters the parietal foramen (parietal artery). 6. THE POSTEEIOR AURICULAR ARTERY The posterior auricular artery (fig. 335) arises from the posterior part of the external carotid artery, usually immediately above the posterior belly of the" digastric, about the level of the tip of the styloid process. Occasionally it arises j under cover of the digastric, quite close to, or as a common trunk with, or i as a branch of, the occipital. It courses upwards and backwards in the parotid521 TEMPOBAL POSTEBIOB AUBIGULAB— gland to the notch between the margin of the external auditory meatus and the mastoid process, where it divides into two branches, an anterior or auricular, and I posterior or mastoid. In this course it rests on the styloid process, crosses the 5pinal accessory nerve, and is crossed itself by the facial nerve. Beanches of the Posterior Aueicular Aetery The brandies of the posterior auricular artery are:—(1) The parotid ; (2) the nuscular; (3) the stylo-mastoid ; (4) the anterior terminal, or auricular ; (5) the losterior terminal, or mastoid (fig. 335). (1) The parotid branches are distributed to the lower portion of the parotid iiand, and anastomose with the other parotid arteries. j (2) The muscular branches supply the posterior belly of the digastricus, the tylo-hyoid, and retrahens aurem muscles. (3) The stylo-mastoid branch comes off from the posterior auricular artery ist before it reaches the notch between the margin of the external auditory meatus nd the mastoid process, and, following the facial nerve upwards, enters the stylo- ^lastoid foramen in the temporal bone. In the aqueduct of Fallopius it gives off the )llowing named twigs '.—{a) meatal, to the external auditory meatus ; {b) mastoid, ) the mastoid cells and mastoid antrum ; (c) stapedic, which runs forwards to 16 stapedius muscle; (cl) tympanic, which anastomoses with the tympanic branch |E the internal maxillary, forming with it in the foetus a vascular circle around the jiembrana tympani; (e) vestibular, to the vestibule and semicircular canals ; and \') terminal, a small twig which enters the hiatus Fallopii with the great super- |cial petrosal nerve, and anastomoses with the petrosal branch of the middle iieningeal artery. j (4) The anterior terminal or auricular branch passes upwards behind the ear [id beneath the retrahens aurem, supplying the back of the pinna and neighbour- ig integuments. It anastomoses with the posterior branch of the superficial tem- pral artery. The branches to the pinna not only supply the back of that structure, |it some perforate the cartilage, and others turn over its free margin to supply the jont surface; there they anastomose with the anterior auricular branches from jie temporal. (5) The posterior terminal, or mastoid or occipital branch, passes upwards and (ickwards, crossing the aponeurotic insertion of the sterno-mastoid muscle. It Ives a branch to the posterior belly of the occipito-frontalis, and anastomoses with |.e occipital artery. I 7. THE TEMPOEAL AETEKY I The temporal artery, or superficial temporal artery—the smaller of the two miinal divisions of the external carotid, though apparently the direct continu- ion of that vessel—arises opposite the neck of the lower jaw and, under cover of e parotid gland, passes upwards in the interval between the condyle and the ' ternal auditory meatus to the zygoma. Thence it ascends over the posterior root ' that process and the temporal aponeurosis for about an inch and a half to two j3hes (4 cm.), and there divides into an anterior and a posterior branch. It j surrounded by a dense plexus of sympathetic nerves, and is accompanied by the jriculo-temporal nerve, which lies beneath and generally a little behind it. It is 'j)ssed by the temporo-facial division of the facial nerve, and by the attrahens irem muscle. As it crosses the zygoma it can be readily felt pulsating immediately -I front of the ear, and in this situation can be compressed against the bone. It is r;jk \^ qihte superficial, being merely covered by the integuments and the delicate jisl iplongation from the cervical fascia.522 THE ABTERIES Bkanches of the Temporal Aeteey The branches of the temporal artery are :—(1) The parotid ; (2) the articular; (3) the masseteric ; (4) the auricular, or anterior auricular; (5) the transverse facial; (6) the middle temporal; (7) the orbital; (8) the anterior terminal; (9) the posterior terminal. | (1) The parotid branches are small twigs given off in the substance of the ! parotid gland to that structure. | (2) The articular branches supply the temporo-maxillary joint. (3) The masseteric are one or two small branches to the masseter muscle. (4) The auricular or anterior auricular branches supply the tragus, the pinna, and the lobule of the ear, and to some extent the external auditory meatus. | (5) The transverse facial is the largest branch of the temporal. It sometimes i arises from the external carotid as a common trunk with the temporal. It is at i first deeply seated in the substance of the parotid gland, but, soon emerging from | under that part of the gland known as the socia parotidis, courses transversely across j the masseter muscle about a finger's breadth below the zygoma. Steno's duct runs ; below it, and the infraorbital branches of the facial nerve above it. It supplies the | parotid gland, the masseter muscle, and the skin of the face, and anastomoses with | the infraorbital, the buccal, and the facial arteries. (6) The middle temporal branch, or middle deep temporal artery (fig. 386), arises just above the zygoma, and, perforating the temporal aponeurosis and temporal muscle, ascends on the squamous portion of the temporal bone, and| anastomoses with the posterior deep temporal artery. (7) The orbital or zygomatico-orbital branch (fig. 336), as it is sometimes called I —at times a branch of the deep temporal—passes forwards along the upper border of the zygoma in the fat between the superficial and deep layer of the temporal aponeurosis, and, after giving branches to the orbicularis oculi, sends one or more twigs into the orbit through the orbital foramina in the malar bone to anastomose with the lachrymal and palpebral branches of the ophthalmic. (8) The anterior terminal branch ramifies tortuously in an upward and forwarc direction over the front part of the skull. It lies, first between the skin an( temporal fascia, and then between the skin and occipito-frontalis. It supplie; the anterior belly of the occipito-frontalis and the orbicularis oculi muscles, an( | anastomoses with the supraorbital, supratrochlear, and frontal branches of th-; ophthalmic, and with the corresponding artery of the opposite side. The secondar; branches given off from this vessel to the scalp run from before backwards. j (9) The posterior terminal branch ramifies on the side of the head betweei I the skin and temporal fascia. Its branches anastomose, in front with the anterior terminal branch; behind, with the posterior auricular and occipital arteries; an above, across the vertex of the skull, with the corresponding artery of the opposit side. 8. THE INTEENAL MAXILLARY ARTERY The internal maxillary artery (fig. 336) is the larger of the two termini i divisions of the external carotid. It arises opposite the neck of the jaw in tlj substance of the parotid gland, and, passing first between the neck of the ja and the spheno-mandibular ligament, and then between the external and intern; pterygoid muscles, sinks deeply into the spheno-maxillary fossa, and there brea. i up into its terminal branches. It is divided into three portions : a maxillary, pterygoid, and a spheno-maxillary. (1) In the first part of its course (the maxillary portion) the artery lies betwe j the neck of the jaw and the spheno-mandibular ligament, taking a horizontal coui iINTEBNAL MAXILLARY 523 forwards and inwards parallel to and a little below the auriculo-temporal nerve and the external pterygoid muscle. It is here surrounded by the deep portion of the parotid gland, and usually crosses in front of the mandibular (inferior dental) nerve. (2) In the second part of its course (the pterygoid portion) the artery Hes either between the two pterygoid muscles and the ramus of the jaw, and then turns upwards over the outer surface of the external pterygoid beneath the temporal muscle to gain the two heads of the external pterygoid, between which it sinks into the spheno-maxillary fossa; or it passes behind and internal to the external ptery- goid, and is covered by that muscle till it reaches the interval between its two Fig. 33G.—Scheme of Inteenal Maxillary Aeteey. InfraorUlal arterii and nerve hpheno-palatine branch Posterior or descending palatine branch Naso-pcdatine branch \ I dian branch Anterior deep temporal artery External pterygoid branch Posterior deep temporal artery , / Small meningeal .I , artery . ./ / ^Middle meningeal y//. artery Alveolar branch Wfjn' ,7/ jf^/ " Mas Temporal artery 'ympanic branch Deep auricular ■anch Masseteric branch External carotid artery Internal lateral ligament Mandibular artery a7id nerve i Submental branch Buccal branch with portion of buccal nerve Internal pterygoid branch Mnlo-hvoidean branch heads, where it then often forms a projecting loop as it turns into the spheno- maxillary fossa. (3) In the third part of its course (the spheno-maxillary portion) the artery lies in the spheno-maxillary fossa beneath the maxillary division of the fifth nerve, and in close relationship with Meckel's ganglion, and there breaks up into its terminal branches. Branches of the Internal Maxillary Artery The branches of the internal maxillary artery are as follow :— (A) From the first part:—(1) The deep auricular ; (2) the tympanic ; (3) the (middle meningeal; (4) the mandibular (inferior dental) ; (5) the small meningeal [(sometimes). All these vessels pass through bony or cartilaginous canals.524 THE ABTERIES (B) From the second part:—(1) The masseteric ; (2) the posterior deep temporal; (3) the internal pterygoid ; (4) the external pterygoid ; (5) the buccal; and (6) the anterior deep temporal. All these branches supply muscles. (C) From the third part:—(1) The posterior dental, or alveolar ; (2) the infra- j orbital; (3) the posterior, or descending palatine ; (4) the Vidian ; (5) the pterygo- | palatine ; and (6) the naso- or spheno-palatine. All these branches pass through ! bony canals. Branches of the First Part of the Internal Maxillary Artery.—(1) The deep i auricular (fig. 836) passes upwards in the substance of the parotid gland behind the j capsule of the temporo-maxillary joint, and, perforating the bony or cartilaginous ' wall of the external auditory meatus, supplies the skin of that passage and the | membrana tympani. It at times gives a branch to the joint as it passes behind | the temporo-maxillary capsule. j (2) The tympanic branch, or Glaserian artery, is a long slender vessel, which | runs upwards behind the condyle of the jaw to the Glaserian fissure, through which j it passes to the interior of the tympanum. Here it supplies the lining membrane of ' that cpvvity and the laxator tympani muscle, and anastomoses with the other tympanic arteries, forming with the tympanic branch of the stylo-mastoid artery a vascular circle around the membrana tympani. This circle is more distinct in the foetus than in the adult. (3) The middle or great meningeal is the largest branch of the internal maxillary \ artery. It comes off from that vessel as it lies between the spheno-mandibular liga- j ment and the ramus of the jaw, and under cover of the external pterygoid passes j directly upwards to the foramen spinosum, through which it enters the interior of the ! cranium. In this part of its course it is crossed by the chorda tympani nerve ; and just before it enters the foramen is embraced by the two heads of origin of the auriculo-temporal nerve (fig. 336). The trunk of the mandibular division of the fifth nerve, as the latter emerges j through the foramen ovale, lies in front of the artery. As the artery passes upwards j it is surrounded by filaments of the sympathetic nerve, and is accompanied by two j veins which open into the internal maxillary vein. On entering the skull it ramifies j between the bone and dura mater, supplying both structures. It at first ascends , for a short distance in a groove on the greater wing of the sphenoid, and then j divides into two branches, an anterior and posterior. The anterior branch passes upwards, in the groove on the greater wing of the j sphenoid, on to the parietal bone at its anterior and inferior angle ; at this spot i the groove becomes deepened and often bridged over by a thin plate of bone, being converted for a quarter to half an inch or more into a distinct canal. The situation of the artery is here indicated on the exterior of the skull by a spot an inch and a ^ half behind, and about an inch above, the external angular process of the orbit. ■, The anterior branch is continued along the anterior border of the parietal bone nearly as far as the superior longitudinal sinus, and gives off in its course, but especially posteriorly, large branches which ramify in an upward and backward ] direction in grooves on the parietal bone (fig. 337). 1 The posterior branch passes backv/ards over the squamous portion of the* temporal bone ; and thence on to the parietal bone, behind the anterior branch. | This branch and its collaterals extend upwards as far as the longitudinal sinus, j and backwards as far as the lateral sinus. j In addition to its terminal anterior, and terminal posterior branches, the middle| meningeal gives off:—[a) Gasserian branches to the Gasserian ganglion andi Meckel's space, [h) A petrosal branch, which enters the hiatus Fallopii, andj anastomoses with the terminal branch of the stylo-mastoid artery, (c) A tympanic branch, which enters the canal for the tensor tympani, and supplies that muscle {d) An orbital or lachrymal branch, which enters the orbit at the outermost pari 1INTERNAL MAXILLABY 525 of the sphenoidal fissure, or somethnes through a minute foramen, just external to that fissure, and anastomoses with the lachrymal branch of the ophthalmic (e) Anastomotic or perforating branches which pierce the greater wing ot the sphenoid bone, and anastomose with the deep temporal arteries. (4) The mandibular (inferior dental) artery (fig. 336),* arising from the internal maxillary as it lies between the spheno-mandibular ligament and neck of the jaw, courses downwards to the mandibular foramen, which it enters in company with, and a little hehind and external to, the mandibular nerve. It then passes along the canal in the interior of the bone, giving off branches to the molar, bicuspid, and canine teeth. On reaching the mental foramen it divides into two branches, the incisive and the mental. The incisive continues its course in the bone, and supphes branches to the incisor teeth, and anastomoses with the artery of the opposite side. Fig. 837.—The Middle Meningeal Artery within the Skull. OPI-lRYOiSR ^XSUB-NASAL POINT The mental passes through the mental foramen in company with the mental branch )f the inferior dental nerve, and emerges on the chin under cover of the depressor abii inferioris. It anastomoses above with the inferior coronary, and below with he submental, and also with the inferior labial. Near its origin the artery gives ^ff (a) a ling-ual or gustatory branch, which accompanies and supplies the lingual lerve, and ends in the mucous membrane of the mouth ; and, just before it enters. |he dental foramen in the lower jaw, {h) a mylo-hyoidean branch, which accompanies he nerve of that name along the groove in the lower jaw, and, after supplying the |nylo-hyoid muscle, anastomoses with the sublingual and submental arteries. I (5) The small meningeal arises either from the internal maxillary a little in pnt of the middle or great meningeal, or as a branch of that vessel. It passes jipwards along the course of the mandibular division of the fifth nerve, and, entering he skull through the foramen ovale, is distributed to the Gasserian ganglion, and to. he walls of the cavernous sinus and the dura mater in the neighbourhood.THE ABTEBIES 526 Branches of the Second Part of the Internal Maxillary Artery.—The branches of the second portion of the mternal maxillary all supply muscles. They are: (1) The masseteric ; (2) the posterior deep temporal; (3) the internal pterygoid; (4) the external pterygoid ; (5) the buccal ; and (6) the anterior deep temporal. (1) The masseteric branch comes off from the internal maxillary as the latter is passing from between the neck of the jaw and the spheno-mandibular ligament. It is directed outwards along with the masseteric nerve, and, passing through the sigmoid notch in the lower jaw, supplies the masseter muscle. Some filaments perforate the muscle and anastomose with the transverse facial and with the masseteric branches of the facial itself. (2) The posterior deep temporal arises, as a rule, from the internal maxillary in common with the masseteric or a little beyond that branch. It passes upwards beneath the temporal muscle in a slight groove on the anterior margin of the squamous portion of the temporal bone, supplying the temporal muscle, the pericranium, and the external layer of the bone. It anastomoses with the anterior deep temporal and the other temporal arteries. (3) The internal pterygoid branches are short trunks which pass into and supply the internal pterygoid muscle. (4) The external pterygoid branches supply the external pterygoid muscle, and, like the internal pterygoid branches, are short trunks, and very irregular in their number, origin, and distribution. (5) The buccal branch (fig. 336) courses forwards and downwards with the buccal nerve to the buccinator muscle, lying in close contact with the inner side and anterior margin of the tendon of the temporal muscle and coronoid process of the lower jaw. It supplies the buccinator muscle and mucous membrane of the mouth, and anastomoses with the facial, transverse facial, and infraorbital | arteries. (6) The anterior deep temporal branch ascends beneath the temporal muscle j in a slight groove on the greater wing of the sphenoid bone. It supplies the I muscle, pericranium, and subjacent bone, and gives off small branches which | pass through minute foramina in the malar bone. Some of these last branches! enter the orbit and anastomose with the lachrymal artery; others emerge on the face and anastomose with the transverse facial artery. Branches of the Third Part of the hiternal Maxillary Artery.—The branches of the third part of the internal maxillary artery, like those of the first part, all- pass through bony canals. They are the following :—(1) The posterior dental, oi alveolar ; (2) the infraorbital; (3) the posterior, or descending palatine; (4) the | Vidian ; (5) the pterygo-palatine ; and (6) the naso-palatine, or spheno-palatine, j (1) The posterior dental or alveolar branch arises from the internal maxillar} | as the latter is passing into the spheno-maxillary fossa, and descends in a tor j tuous manner in a groove on the back of the body of the maxilla. It gives of the following branches :—{a) Antral, which pass through small foramina into th( antrum; {h) dental, which pass into bony canals to supply the molar and bicuspic teeth; (c) alveolar, or gingival, which supply the gums ; and {d) buccal, whict j are distributed to the buccinator muscle. j (2) The infraorbital branch arises from the internal maxillary, generally aii a common trunk with the posterior dental. It passes forwards and a little upward; | through the spheno-maxillary fossa ; then forwards in company with the maxillar { division of the fifth nerve, first along the groove, and then through the canal ii; the orbital plate of the maxilla ; and finally, emerging on the face at the infra orbital foramen, under cover of the levator labii superioris proprius, is distributee i to the structures forming the upper lip, the lower eyelid, the lachrymal sac, and tbi I side of the nose. It anastomoses with the inferior coronary and angular branchel l of the facial, with the nasal and lachrymal branches of the ophthalmic, and withthiINTERNAL MAXILLABY o27 transverse facial. It gives off the following small branches :—(a) Orbital, to the fat of the orbit and to the inferior rectus and inferior oblique muscles; {b) an I anterior dental branch, which passes downwards through a groove in the anterior wall of the superior maxilla, and supplies branches to the incisor and canine teeth and the mucous membrane of the antrum ; and (c) nasal branches, which pass through the foramina in the nasal process of the superior maxilla (sutura notha). i (3) The posterior or descending palatine branch descends in the posterior palatine canal with the posterior palatine branches of Meckel's ganglion. On emerging on the palate at the posterior palatine foramen, it divides into the following branches :—(a) An anterior branch, which courses forwards in the muco-periosteum at the junction of the hard palate with the alveolar process as far as the anterior palatine foramen, where it anastomoses with the naso-palatine artery; and {b) posterior branches, which pass backwards and downwards into the soft palate, 1 contributing to the supply of that structure, and anastomosing with the ascending palatine artery. After the operation for cleft palate, serious hasmorrhage occasion- ally occurs from the descending palatine artery. It maybe stopped by compressing ithe artery by means of a plug inserted in the posterior palatine foramen. The foramen is situated a little behind, and internal to, the last molar tooth, and almost immediately in front of the hamular process. (4) The Vidian artery is a long slender branch which passes backwards through the Vidian canal in company with the Vidian nerve into the cartilage of the middle lacerated foramen. It gives off the following branches:—(a) Pharyngeal, Iwhich contributes to the supply of the roof of the pharynx, and anastomoses with Ithe ascending pharyngeal and pterygo-palatine arteries; (b) Eustachian, which is Idistributed to the Eustachian tube ; and (c) tympanic, which enters the tympanum, and anastomoses with the other tympanic arteries. (5) The pterygo-palatine artery, or pterygo-pharyngeal as it is sometimes called, a still more slender branch than the Vidian, passes backwards through the pterygo-palatine foramen with the pharyngeal nerve, a branch of Meckel's ganglion. It divides into three branches: {a) Pharyngeal, to the roof of the pharynx ; (b) Eustachian, to the Eustachian tube ; and (c) sphenoidal, to the sphenoidal cells. iThe pterygo-palatine sometimes arises from the spheno-palatine. (6) The spheno-palatine or naso-palatine artery, the terminal branch of the internal maxillary, passes with the spheno-palatine branch of Meckel's ganglion from the spheno-maxillary fossa into the nose through the spheno-palatine foramen. Crossing the roof of the nose in the muco-periosteum, it passes on to the septum, and then runs forwards and downwards in a groove on the vomer (under the name of the naso-palatine, or artery of the septum) towards the anterior palatine foramen, where it anastomoses with the anterior palatine artery, which enters the nose through the lateral compartment of that foramen (the canal of Stenson). In this course it gives off the following branches :—{a)A pharyngeal branch (or descend- ing pharyngeal branch, as it is sometimes called), which is distributed to the roof land contiguous portions of the pharynx, (b) A sphenoidal branch, which supphes |the sphenoidal cells, (c) Nasal branches, which ramify over the turbinal bones and lateral walls of the nose, and give twigs to the ethmoidal and frontal sinuses land lining membrane of the antrum, (cl) Ascending septal branches, which run iupwards and forwards, giving small twigs to the mucous membrane covering the 'upper part of the septum, and which pass through the cribriform plate of the iethmoid, and anastomose with the ethmoidal arteries (perforating or meningeal [branches). I ITHE ABTEBIES 528 THE INTERNAL CAROTID ARTERY The internal carotid (fig. 338) arises with the external carotid at the bifurcation of the common carotid, opposite the upper border of the thyroid cartilage, on a level with the fourth cervical vertebra. It is at first placed a little external to the external carotid, but as it ascends in the neck the latter vessel becomes more superficial and in front of it. The internal carotid passes up the neck, in front of Fig. 338.—The Internal Carotid Artery, and Deep Branches of the External Carotid Artery. (From a dissection in the Hunterian Museum.)

It then makes a sigmoK | curve on the side of the body of the sphenoid bone, and terminates, after perforating j the dura mater, by dividing opposite the anterior clinoid processes in the fissure o j Sylvius, into the anterior and middle cerebral arteries. i In its course up the neck it often forms one or more curves, especially in ol<j people. Between the internal and the external carotids, at their angle of divergence j is situated the intercarotid body, or ganglion intercaroticum. j529 INTEBNAL CABOTID The internal carotid is the continuation upwards of the primitive dorsal aorta, md supplies the greater part of the brain, the contents of the orbit, and parts of he internal ear, forehead, and nose. It is divided into three portions :—1. A iervical; 2. an intraosseous, or petrosal; and 3. an intracranial. 1. The Cervical Portion Relations.—In the neck the artery is at first comparatively superficial, having b front of it, as it lies in the superior carotid triangle, the skin, superficial fascia, latysma and deep fascia, and the overlapping edge of the sterno-mastoid muscle, ligher up, as it sinks beneath the parotid gland (fig. 329), it becomes deeply placed, !nd is crossed by the posterior belly of the digastric and stylo-hyoid muscles, the ypogiossal nerve, and the occipital and posterior auricular arteries; whilst still igher it is separated from the external carotid artery, which here gets in front of by the stylo-glossus and stylo-pharyngeus muscles, the giosso-pharyngeal nerve, he pharyngeal branch of the pneumogastric nerve, and by the stylo-hyoid ligament. Behind, it lies upon the rectus capitis anticus major, which separates it from the ransverse processes of the three upper cervical vertebrae, on the superior cervical anglion of the sympathetic nerve, and on the pneumogastric nerve. Near the ase of the skull, the hypoglossal, pneumogastric, giosso-pharyngeal, and spinal ccessory nerves cross obliquely behind it, separating it at this spot from the internal jigular vein, which, as the artery is about to enter the carotid canal, also forms one |f its posterior relations. I; On its outer side are the internal jugular vein and pneumogastric nerve. On its inner side it is in relation with the pharynx, the superior constrictor muscle 3parating it from the tonsil. The ascending pharyngeal and ascending palatine [•teries, and at the base of the skull the Eustachian tube and levator palati Luscle are also internal to it. 2. The Intraosseous or Petrosal Portion The intraosseous portion (fig. 331) is situated in the carotid canal in the itrous portion of the temporal bone. It is here separated from the walls of the mal by a prolongation downwards of the dura mater. In this part of its course first ascends in front of the tympanum and cochlea of the internal ear; it then irns forwards and inwards, lying a little internal to and behind the Eustachian ibe, and enters the cranial cavity by turning upwards through the foramen .cerum medium, lying upon the lingula of the sphenoid bone. In this part of its |)urse it is accompanied by the ascending branches from the superior cervical ! i|inglion of the sympathetic. These form a plexus about the artery, but are situated uefly on its outer side. It is also surrounded by a number of small veins, which jceive tributaries from the tympanum, and open into the cavernous sinus and ilternal jugular vein. 8. The Intracranial Portion On entering the cranium through the foramen lacerum medium, the internal irotid first ascends towards the posterior clinoid process, but soon changing its rection, it curves forwards and slightly downwards by the side of the body of the henoid bone on the inner wall of the cavernous sinus. Here it has the sixth nerve jimediately external to it, and is covered by the lining membrane of the sinus, gain turning upwards, it pierces the dura mater on the inner side of the anterior inoid process, and, passing between the second and third nerves to the anterior Eforated spot at the inner end of the Sylvian fissure, divides into its two terminal nches, the anterior and middle cerebral. After it has perforated the dura mater, Is described by some anatomists as a fourth portion—the mtracerebral (fig. 387). I MMTHE ABTEBIES 530 Beanches of the Inteenal Caeotid Aeteey The cervical portion gives off no branch. The intraosseous portion gives off:—(1) Tympanic ; (2) Vidian. The intracranial portion gives off:—(1) Arteria receptaculi; (2) pituitary ; (3) Gasserian ; (4) meningeal; (5) ophthalmic; (6) posterior commmiicating; (7) anterior choroid; (8) anterior cerebral; (9] middle cerebral. Branches of the Intraosseous Portion.—(1) The tympanic enters the tympanum through a small foramen in the posterior wall of the carotid canal, and contributes its quota to the blood-supply of that cavity. It anastomoses with the tympanic branches of the stylo-mastoid and internal maxillary arteries. (2) A Vidian branch is also described, and is said to anastomose with the Vidian artery. Branches of the Bitracranial Portion.—As the internal carotid artery lies on the inner side of the cavernous sinus, it gives off the following branches:— | (1) Arteria receptaculi, small branches to the walls of the cavernous sinus; (2)! pituitary branches to the pituitary body ; (3) Gasserian or ganglionic branches; to the Gasserian ganglion ; (4) meningeal or anterior meningeal branches to the I dura mater ; these anastomose with anterior branches of the middle meningeal, j (5) THE OPHTHALMIC ARTEKY The ophthalmic artery (fig. 339) comes off from the internal carotid imme! diately below the anterior clinoid process just as the latter vessel is passing througl ; the dura mater. Entering the orbit through the optic foramen below and externa ] to the optic nerve, it at once perforates the sheath of dura mater which is prolonge( j through the optic foramen on both artery and nerve. It then runs in a gentL: curve with its convexity outwards below the optic nerve and external rectus, bein< j here crossed by the nasal nerve, and turning forwards, inwards, and upwards passes over the optic nerve, round which it thus forms a loop (fig. 339) to the inne; side of the orbit. Thence it runs obliquely beneath the superior rectus in front o the nasal nerve under the lower border of the superior oblique, but above th internal rectus, and continues its course under the pulley for the superior obliqn and reflected tendon of that muscle to the internal angular process of the orbi: where it divides into the frontal and nasal branches. Beanches of the Ophthalmic Aeteey | The branches of the ophthalmic artery are :—(a) the lachrymal; {h) the supr^i, orbital; (c) the central artery of the retina ; {cl) the muscular ; (e) the ciliary; (j\ the posterior ethmoidal; (g) the anterior ethmoidal; (h) the palpebral; (i) tl frontal; and {h) the nasal. (a) The Lacheymal Aeteey j The lachrymal artery is usually the first and at times the largest branch ] the ophthalmic. It arises between the superior and external rectus on the out j side of the optic nerve from the ophthalmic soon after that vessel has entered tl orbit. At times it is given off from the ophthalmic outside the orbit, and th( usually passes into that cavity through the sphenoidal fissure. It runs forwar j along the outer wall of the orbit with the lachrymal nerve above the upper bord | of the external rectus to the lachrymal gland, which it supplies. In this course j furnishes the following branches :—(i) Recurrent lachrymal, one or morebrancbj which pass backwards through the sphenoidal fissure, and anastomoses with 11 lachrymal branch of the middle meningeal artery. This anastomosis is soul531 BRANCHES OF OPHTHALMIC times of large size, and takes the chief share in the formation of the lachrymal artery, (ii) Muscular branches, distributed chiefly to the external rectus. (iii) Malar branches—small twigs, which pass through the malar canals, and anasto- mose with the orbital branch of the middle temporal, and with the transverse facial on the cheek, (iv) Palpebral branches, which are distributed to the upper and lower eyelids and to the conjunctiva, (v) Ciliary. See Ciliaey Arteries, page 532. (b) The Supraorbital Artery The supraorbital artery usually arises from the ophthalmic as the latter vessel is about to cross over the optic nerve. Passing upwards to the inner side of the jsuperior rectus and levator palpebras, it runs along the upper surface of the latter [muscle with the frontal nerve, but beneath the periosteum to the supraorbital 'notch. On emerging on the forehead beneath the orbicularis palpebrarum, it divides Fig. 339.—The Ophthalmic Artery and Vein.

(c) The Central Artery of the Eetina The arteria centralis retinae, a small but constant branch, comes off from le ophthalmic close to the optic foramen, and, perforating the optic nerve about a M M 2THE ABTEBIES 532 quarter of an inch behind the globe, runs forwards in the substance of the nerve to the eyeball supplying the retina. Its further description is given in the Anatomy OF THE Eye. (c7) The Muscular Branches The muscular branches are very variable in their origin and distribution. They may be roughly divided into superior and inferior sets. The superior or smaller set supply the superior oblique, the levator palpebree, and superior rectus, i The inferior pass forward between the optic nerve and the inferior rectus, supply- i ing that muscle, the internal rectus, and the inferior obhque. From the muscular: branches are given off the anterior ciliary arteries. (See Ciliary Arteries.) I (e) The Ciliary Arteries The ciliary arteries are divided into three sets :—The short posterior, the long| posterior, and the anterior, (i) The short posterior, five to six in number, com(| off chiefly from the ophthalmic as it is crossing the optic nerve. They run forwarc'! about the nerve, dividing into twelve or fifteen small vessels, which perforate th(; sclerotic around the entrance of the optic nerve, and are distributed to the choroicj coat, (ii) The long posterior ciliary arteries, usually two in number, come ofj from the ophthalmic on either side of the optic nerve, and run forward with thj short ciliary to the sclerotic. On piercing the sclerotic, they course forwardj between that coat and the choroid to the ciHary processes and iris. Their furthej distribution is given under the Anatomy of the Eye. (iii) The anterior ciliarj are derived from the muscular branches and from the lachrymal. They run t j the globe along the tendons of the recti, forming a zone of radiating vessel | beneath the conjunctiva. They perforate the sclerotic about a quarter of an inc j (6 mm.) behind the cornea, and supply the iris and cihary processes. It is thes j vessels that are enlarged and congested in iritis, forming the circumcorneal zonj of redness so characteristic of that disease. : (/) The Posterior Ethmoidal Artery i The posterior ethmoidal runs inwards between the superior oblique and intern rectus, and, leaving the orbit by the posterior ethmoidal canal, enters the posterii \ ethmoidal cells, whence it passes through a transverse slit-like aperture betwe( the sphenoid bone and cribriform plate of the ethmoid bone into the cranium. ^ gives off (i) ethmoidal branches to the posterior ethmoidal cells; (ii) meningej branches to the dura mater lining the cribriform plate; and (iii) nasal branch(| which pass through the cribriform plate to the superior meatus and upper sponj bones of the nose, and anastomose with the nasal branches of the spheno-palatij artery. j {g) The Anterior Ethmoidal Artery ] The anterior ethmoidal (figs. 839, 387), a larger branch than the poster| ethmoidal, arises in front of the latter, passes inwards between the superl oblique and internal rectus, and, leaving the orbit through the anterior ethmoi(| canal, in company with the nasal nerve, enters the cranial cavity. After runn: || a short distance beneath the dura mater on the cribriform plate of the ethm i bone, it passes into the nose through the horizontal sht-hke aperture by the side f the crista galh. Its terminal branch passes along the groove on the under surf 13 of the nasal bone, and emerges on the nose between the bone and lateral cartilaf, terminating in the sldn of that organ. It gives off the following branches m 3 course :—(i) Ethmoidal, to the anterior ethmoidal cells ; (ii) meningeal, to the d iPOSTEBIOB COMMUNICATING—ANTEBIOB CHOBOID 583 nater of the anterior fossa ; (iii) nasal, to the middle meatus and anterior part of he nose ; (iv) frontal, to the frontal sinuses ; (v) cutaneous, or terminal, to the skin )f the nose. (h) The Palpebral Aeteries The palpebral branches arise either separately or by a common trunk from he ophthalmic artery opposite the pulley for the superior oblique, just as the latter /essel is about to divide into its terminal branches. They pass, one above and )ne below the internal tarsal ligament or tendo ocuh, and then skirt along the ipper and lower eyelids respectively, near the free margin between the tarsal cartilages and the orbicularis muscle, and form a superior and inferior palpebral jirch by anastomosing with the palpebral branches of the lachrymal. The upper ilso anastomoses with the supraorbital artery and orbital branch of the temporal irtery ; the lower with the infraorbital, the angular branch of the facial, and the ransverse facial arteries. A branch from the lower palpebral passes with the nasal luct as far as the inferior meatus. Small twigs are also given to the caruncle md conjunctiva. (i) The Frontal Branch The frontal branch, the upper of the terminal branches of the ophthalmic, pierces the tarsal membrane at the inner angle of the orbit, passes upwards over he frontal bone, supplies the structures in its neighbourhood, and anastomoses with ts fellow of the opposite side, with the supraorbital, and with the anterior division )f the superficial temporal artery. (k) The Nasal Branch The nasal, the lower of the terminal branches of the ophthalmic, leaves the )rbit at the inner canthus by perforating the tarsal membrane above the tendo )culi. It then descends along the dorsum of the nose, beneath the integuments ; md anastomoses with the angular and lateral nasal branches of the facial. It gives )ff a lachrymal branch as it crosses the lachrymal sac, and a transverse nasal branch as it crosses the root of the nose ; the latter vessel anastomoses with its bellow of the opposite side, (6) THE POSTEEIOE COMMUNICATING AETERY The posterior communicating artery (fig. 340) is given off from the internal karotid just before the division of that vessel into the anterior and middle cerebral pteries; occasionally it arises from the middle cerebral itself. It is as a rule a ilender vessel which runs backwards over the optic tract and crus cerebri along the side of the uncinate convolution to join the posterior cerebral. At times, however, t is of considerable size, and contributes chiefly to form the posterior cerebral, the )ortion of the latter vessel between the basilar and posterior communicating peing then as a rule reduced to a mere rudiment. It gives off the following tranches :—(«) the uncinate, to the convolution of that name; and (b) the middle halamic, to the optic thalamus. I (7) THE ANTEEIOE CHOEOID AETEEY The anterior choroid is a small but constant vessel, which arises as a rule rom the back part of the internal carotid just external to the origin of the Posterior communicating, It passes backwards on the optic tract and the crus cerebri, at first lying parallel and a little external to the posterior communicatingTHE ABTEBIES 534 artery, and then, turning slightly outwards, dips under the edge of the uncinate convolution, and, entering the transverse fissure at the lower end of the descending cornu of the lateral ventricle, ends in the choroid plexus and supplies the hippo- campus major and corpus fimbriatum. (8) THE ANTERIOK CEREBRAL ARTERY The anterior cerebral artery (fig. 340)—one of the terminal branches into which the internal carotid divides in the fissure of Sylvius—passes at first forwards and inwards across the anterior perforated space between the olfactory and optic nerves to the longitudinal fissure where it approaches its fellow of the opposite side, and communicates with it by a short transverse trunk, about two lines long, known as the anterior communicating artery. Onwards from this spot it runs side by side with its fellow in the longitudinal fissure round the genu of the corpus ! '^^ callosum ; then, turning backwards, it continues along the upper surface of that ' commissure, and, after giving off large branches to the frontal and parietal lobules, anastomoses with the posterior cerebral artery. The branches of the anterior cerebral are:—(a) Communicating; {h) ganglionic, or central; (c) commissural ; [d) hemispheral, or cortical. (a) Communicating'.—The anterior communicating is a transverse trunk about two lines in length, connecting the right and left anterior cerebral arteries. It lies immediately in front of the optic commissure across the lamina cinerea. It gives off some of the antero-median branches which pass from the anterior cerebral 1 to the fore end of the caudate nucleus. Sometimes the anterior cerebral arteries, instead of communicating by a transverse trunk, coalesce for a short distance and then again divide. {h) Ganglionic, or central.—The antero-median group, together with the antero- median branches of the anterior communicating, pass through the lamina cinerea and supply the fore end of the caudate nucleus. j (c) Commissural.—These supply the corpus callosum. (d) The hemispheral or cortical branches.—(i) The orbital, three or four in number, supply the inferior surface of the first frontal convolution, and give off small twigs to the olfactory bulb, (ii) The margino-frontal arise from the artery as it lies on the corpus callosum, and, after supplying the marginal convolution, pass on to the convex surface of the hemisphere and further supply the first andi second frontal convolutions and the upper part of the ascending frontal convolution.; (iii) The calloso-marginal supplies the callosal convolution and the upper part of the marginal convolution, (iv) The quadrate is a branch to the convolution ol that name. (9) THE MIDDLE CEREBRAL ARTERY The middle cerebral artery (fig. 340)—the larger of the two terminal division; of the internal carotid—passes obliquely upwards and outwards into the fissure o Sylvius, and opposite the insula or island of Reil divides into its hemispheral o: cortical branches. The branches of the middle cerebral are :—{a) Ganglionic, or central; and (h\ \^ hemispheral, or cortical. i ^kse {a) Ganglionic, or central.—(i) The caudate, two or three small branches, aris i \{^^ from the inner aspect of the artery and pass through the inner part of the floo j 't^i^^ of the fissure of Sylvius to the head of the caudate nucleus, (ii) The anter( ; I', lateral are numerous small arteries, which pass through the anterior perforate space and supply the caudate nucleus (except its head), the internal capsule, andpai of the optic thalamus, (iii) The lenticulo-striate, a larger branch of the anterc tm i((7 iiliirffI MIDDLE CEBEBBAL—CIBCLE OF WILLIS 635 teral set, passes through a separate hole in the outer part of the anterior perforated pace, runs upwards between the lenticular nucleus (which it supplies) and the xternal capsule, perforates the internal capsule, and terminates in the caudate lucleus. It has been so frequently found ruptured, that it is called by Charcot the artery of cerebral haemorrhage.' {h) The hemispheral or cortical branches come off from the middle cerebral pposite the insula. They are four in number :—(i) The inferior, or orbito-frontal, |o the inferior frontal convolutions, (ii) The ascending frontal, to the lower part f the ascending frontal convolution, the upper part being supplied by the margino- contal, a branch of the anterior cerebral, (iii) The parietal, to the whole of the scending parietal and the adjacent part of the inferior parietal convolution. |Lv) The parieto-temporal, to the convolutions around the posterior limb of the ssure of Sylvius—viz. the supra-marginal, the angular, and the posterior part of lie inferior parietal above, and the first and the greater part of the second and lird temporal below.

This so- jiled circle, which has really the form of a heptagon, is formed, in front, by the literior communicating artery uniting the anterior cerebral arteries of opposite sides; iterally, by the trunk of the internal carotid and the posterior communicating jteries stretching between it and the posterior cerebral; behind, by the two posterior 'rebrals diverging from the bifurcation of the basilar artery (page 543). This free iiastomosis between the two internal carotid and the two vertebral arteries serves536 THE ABTEBIES I to equalise the flow of blood to the various portions of the brain ; and, should one or more of the arteries entering into the formation of the circle be temporarily or permanently obstructed, it ensures a flow of blood to the otherwise deprived part through some of the collateral arteries. Thus, if one carotid or one vertebral ia obstructed, the parts supplied by that vessel receive their blood through the circle from the remaining pervious vessels. Indeed, one vertebral artery alone has been found equal to the task of carrying sufficient blood for the supply of the brain after ligature of both the carotids and the other vertebral artery. Further, the circle of Willis is the only medium of communication between the ganglionic or central and the hemispheral or cortical branches of the cerebral arteries, and between the various ganglionic branches themselves. The ganglionic and the cortical branches form separate and distinct systems, and do not anastomose with each other; and the ganglionic, moreover, are so-called end-vessels, and do not anastomose with the neighbouring ganglionic branches. ! I THE SUBCLAVIAN ARTERY | The subclavian artery on the right side arises at the bifurcation of the innomi-i nate behind the right ster^o-clavicular articulation. On the left side it arises from j the arch of the aorta, and as far as the inner border of the scalenus anticus is! situated deeply in the chest. The first portion of the left subclavian artery isj described separately. j Beyond the inner border of the scalenus anticus the artery has the same rela-1 tions on both sides. It courses from this point beneath the clavicle in a slight ■ curve across the root of the neck to the outer border of the first rib, there to endj in the axillary artery. Thus the course of the artery in the neck will be indicatec I by a line drawn from the sterno-clavicular joint in a curve with its convexity upwards to the middle of the clavicle. The height the artery rises in the neck varies. It ii i perhaps most commonly about half an inch above the clavicle. If the curved lin( | above mentioned is drawn to represent part of the circumference of a circle havin{ ! its centre at a point on the lower margin of the clavicle an inch and a half fron j the sternal end of that bone, the line of the artery will be sufficiently well indicatec 11 for all practical purposes. In its course the artery arches over the dome of thj pleura and gains the groove on the upper surface of the first rib by passing betwee] j the scalenus anticus and medius muscles. The artery is accompanied by the sub j clavian vein, the latter vessel lying in front of the scalenus anticus, anterior to th; artery, and on a slightly lower plane. The subclavian artery is divided into three portions—as it lies internal t( behind, or external to, the scalenus anticus muscle. , THE FIRST OR THORACIC PORTION OF THE LEFT j SUBCLAVIAN ARTERY j The left subclavian artery (fig. 828) arises from the termination of the transverf | portion of the arch of the aorta. The first part of the left subclavian is conscj quently longer than the first part of the right, which arises at the bifurcation < | the innominate opposite the right sterno-clavicular joint. The artery at its orig:| is situated deeply in the thorax, and as it arises from the aorta is on a plane po terior to and a little to the left of the thoracic portion of the left common caroti It first ascends almost vertically out of the chest, and at the root of the nei537 BIGHT AND LEFT SUBCLAVIAN 3urves outwards over the apex of the left pleura and lung to the interval between ]he anterior and middle scalane muscles. Beyond the inner border of the scalenus mticus—that is, in the second and third portions of its course—its relations are similar to those of the right subclavian artery. Relations.—In front it is covered by the left pleura and lung, whilst more super- icial are the sterno-thyroid, sterno-hyoid, and sterno-mastoid muscles. It is crossed b little above its origin by the left innominate vein, and higher in the neck near the icalenus anticus by the internal jugular, vertebral, and subclavian veins. The )hrenic nerve crosses the artery immediately internal to the scalenus anticus, and jlhen descends parallel to it but on an anterior plane to cross the arch of the aorta. IChe pneumogastric nerve descends parallel to the artery between it and the left ommon carotid, coming into contact with its anterior surface just before crossing the ,rch of the aorta. The left cervical cardiac nerves of the sympathetic also descend n front of it on their way to the cardiac plexus. The left common carotid is situated ,nteriorly and to its right. The thoracic duct arches over the artery just internal 0 the scalenus anticus, to empty its contents into the confluence of the internal bgular and subclavian veins (fig. 360). j Behind and somewhat internal to it are the oesophagus, thoracic duct, inferior ervical ganglion of the sympathetic, longus colli muscle, and vertebral column. To ome extent it is overlapped posteriorly by the left pleura and lung (fig. 328). On its right side are the trachea and the recurrent laryngeal nerve, and, higher p, the oesophagus and thoracic duct. On its left side are the left pleura and lung. The chief variations in the origin of the left subclavian artery are given under Variations IF THE Arch of the Aorta (page 501). THE FIRST PORTION OF THE RIGHT SUBCLAVIAN ARTERY The first portion of the right subclavian artery extends from its origin at the ifurcation of the innominate, behind the upper margin of the right sterno-clavicular )int, upwards and outwards in a gentle curve over the apex of the right lung and leura to the inner border of the scalenus anticus. It measures about one inch and quarter in length (3 cm.). In this course it ascends in the neck a variable distance jbove the clavicle, but is so deeply placed, so surrounded by important structures, lid gives off so many large branches, that it is now seldom or never selected for the pplication of a ligature. j Relations.—In front it is covered by the integuments, the superficial fascia, the flatysma, the anterior layer of the deep fascia, the clavicular origin of the sterno- lastoid, the sterno-hyoid and sterno-thyroid muscles, and the deep cervical fascia, t is crossed by the commencement of the innominate, by the internal jugular, and ^ the vertebral veins ; and from within outwards by the pneumogastric and phrenic erves, and the superior cardiac branches of the sympathetic nerve. A loop of the /mpathetic nerve itself also crosses the artery, and forms with the trunk of the ^mpathetic a ring around the vessel known as the annulus of Vieussens. Behind, but separated from the artery by a cellular interval, are the longus colli Luscle, the transverse process of the seventh cervical or first thoracic vertebra, the Lain chain of the sympathetic nerve, the inferior cardiac nerves, the recurrent .ryngeal nerve, and the apex of the right lung and pleura. Below, it is in contact with the pleura and lung and the loop of the recurrent .ryngeal nerve, which winds round the artery from the pneumogastric and ascends phind it to the larynx. The subclavian vein is below the artery and on an anterior iane. ! Branches.—The vertebral, internal mammary, and thyroid axis arise from this irt of the vessel.THE ABTEBIES 538 THE SECOND POKTION OF THE SUBCLAVIAN AETERY The second portion of the subclavian artery lies behind the scalenus anticus muscle. It measures about three-quarters of an inch in length (2 cm.), and here reaches highest in the neck. The subclavian vein is separated from the artery by the scalenus anticus, and lies on a lower and anterior jolane. Relations.—In front it is covered by the skin, superficial fascia, platysma, anterior layer of deep fascia, the clavicular origin of the sterno-mastoid, deep layer of deep fascia, and by the scalenus anticus. The phrenic nerve—which, in conse- quence of its oblique course downwards and inwards, crosses a portion of both the first and second part of the subclavian—is separated from the second portion by the scalenus anticus muscle. Behind the artery are the apex of the pleura and lung, and a portion of the scalenus medius. Above is the brachial plexus. Below are the pleura and lung. One branch only—the superior intercostal—is, as a rule, given off from this portion of the subclavian. Fig. 341.—The Subclavian Aetery.

It is more superficial than either the first or second portions ; it is in re tion with less important structures, and as a rule gives off no branch, and for.th' reasons is the part selected when practicable for the application of a ligature. HI SUBCLAVIAN 539 |he longest of the three portions of the subclavian artery, and lies in a triangle—the ubclavian triangle—hounded by the sterno-mastoid, the omo-hyoid, and the clavicle. Relations.—In front it is covered by the skin, superficial fascia, platysma^ navicular branches of the descending portion of the cervical plexus of nerves ; interior layer of deep fascia which descends from the omo-hyoid to the clavicle ; lid the posterior layer of deep fascia which descends from the omo-hyoid to the rst rib and is prolonged inwards over the scalenus anticus and phrenic nerve, etween the two layers of fascia is a variable amount of cellular tissue and fat, and mning in this is the suprascapular artery. The subclavian is crossed by'this :tery unless the arm is drawn well downwards. Hence one of the reasons )r depressing the shoulder, and thus avoiding the suprascapular artery, in the deration of ligaturing the subclavian. Close to the outer margin of the sterno- lastoid, the external jugular vein pierces the fascia, and crosses the subclavian ftery to open into the subclavian vein. As this vein lies between the two layers of ,scia, it receives on its external side the suprascapular, transverse cervical, and ther veins of the neck, which together form a plexus of large veins in front of the |tery. The nerve to the subclavius, and when present the accessory branch from [is nerve to the phrenic, also here cross in front of the artery. In very muscular ibjects the sterno-mastoid may extend further outwards along the clavicle than lual, and in such a case will form one of the coverings of the artery. Behind, the artery is in contact with the scalenus medius, and with the cord of e brachial plexus formed by theimionof the eighth cervical and first dorsal nerve, j Below, the artery rests in the posterior of the two grooves on the upper surface j the first rib. ! Above is the brachial plexus of nerves and the posterior belly of the omo-hyoid iuscle. The cord formed by the fifth and sixth cervical nerves is also above the tery, but on a somewhat anterior plane. It is close to the vessel, and has been istaken for the artery in the application of a ligature. As a rule there is no branch given off from the third portion of the subclavian, i; times, however, the suprascapular (fig. 329) or the posterior scapular artery may ise from the third portion of the subclavian, instead of from the thyroid axis and mi the transverse cervical respectively as here described. ! Chief Variations in the Subclavian Artery (A) The right subclavian artery may arise directly from the arch of the aorta, and 3n come off as the first, second, third or fourth branch of that vessel. When it ;|ses as the first branch, it takes the place usually occupied by the innominate; when it J'ses as the last branch, it courses behind the trachea and tt sophagus to gain the groove on 1) first rib. As the second or third branch of the aortic arch it is very rare ; in both i;tances it then runs behind the right common carotid. The explanation of the right f)clavian arising as the last branch of the arch of the aorta, is that the right aortic arch h remained pervious, whilst the normal root of the subclavian artery has become (iterated. An arteria aberrans, given off" from the right subclavian or from the superior lercostal, can generally be traced to the third thoracic vertebra behind the oesophagus, and ia number of such cases can be followed across the spine to anastomose with a branch of t thoracic aorta given off below the ductus arteriosus. It is the enlargement of this fl;istomosis—whicli is itself the remains of what was the primitive right dorsal aorta in ti embryo—that gives rise to the abnormality in question. The inferior laryngeal nerve ijsuch cases, in consequence of the right fourth arch which forms the first portion of tj subclavian being obliterated, follows a direct course to the larynx instead of winding I'jiirrently round the subclavian artery. ' (B) The right subclavian may arise higher or lower in the neck than usual, according f>i;he innominate divides above or below the normal situation. 1(C) It may perforate the scalenus anticus or pass in front of that muscle. |(D) It may ascend as high as an inch and a half aboA-e the clavicle, or remain below t] level of that bone. |(E) The third part of the artery may be covered by the trapezius or sterno-mastoid, or l^ja clavicular origin of the omo-hyoid. 1(F) The subclavian vein may accompany the artery behind the scalenus anticus.54:0 THE ABTEBIES Beaxches of the Subclavian Aeteey From the first portion of the subclaviau artery are given off : from the upper anc back part and about three-quarters of aniiich (2 cm.) from its origm, the vertebral a little further outwards, from the front part, the thyroid axis ; and from the lowe part—usually opposite the thyroid axis, or else between the thyroid axis and tb vertebral—the internal mammary. From the second portion arises, from the back of the vessel, the superior intei costal. I The tliird portion, as a rule, gives off no branch. Branches of the First Part of the Subclavian' Artery THE VERTEBRAL ARTERY The vertebral artery, the first and largest branch, arises from the upper ai posterior part of the first portion of the subclavian, on the right side abo three-quarters of an inch (2 cm.) from the origin of the latter vessel from tj innominate, on the left side, from the most promment part of the arch of the su clavian, close to the inner edge of the scalenus anticus muscle. It first ascends the foramen m the costo-transverse process of the sixth cervical vertebra, and, havi passed through that foramen and those of the next succeeding cervical vertebrae-i high as the axis, it turns outwards, and then upvrards to reach the foramen in 1 transverse process of the atlas ; after passmg through that foramen it turns ba(! wards behind the articular process lying in the groove on the posterior arch of \- atlas. It next pierces the posterior occipito-atloid ligament and the dura mater, a enters the cranium through the foramen magnum. Here it passes upwards, at fi lying by the side of the medulla, then in front of that structure, and terminates at lower portion of the pons by inosculating with the vertebral of the opposite sid( form the basilar. The vertebral artery may be divided for purposes of description into four pai : the first, or cervical, extending from its origin to the transverse process of the si q cervical vertebra ; the second, or vertebral, situated in the intervertebral forami:; the tliird, or occipital, contamed in'the suboccipital triangle; and the fourtli|r intracranial, within the cranium. The first or cervical portion.—The artery here lies between the scale anticus and longus colli muscles. In front it is covered by the vertebral and uite] jugular veins, and is crossed by the inferior thyroid artery ; and on the left side addition, by the thoracic duct, which runs over it from within outwards. Bet the artery lies on the transverse process of the seventh cervical vertebra and sympathetic nerve. To its inner side is the longus coUi. To its outer side is le scalenus anticus. It gives off as a rule no branch in this part of its course. 0 p- sionally, however, a small branch passes into the foramen of the transverse pre of the seventh cervical vertebra. ^ The second or vertebral portion.—As the artery passes through the ujr- vertebral foramina, it is surromided by a i3iexus of veins and by branches of pe sympathetic nerve. The cervical nerves he behhid it. Between the trans^pe processes it is in contact with the intertransverse muscles. j The tliird or occipital portion.—The artery here Hes m the suboccipital tria lie, bounded by the superior obhque, uiferior oblique, and rectus capitis posticus r or muscles. As it winds round the groove on the atlas, it has the rectus capitis late lis, the articular process, and the occipito-atloid ligament in front of it; the suj lor ss541 VERTEBBAL bblique and the rectus capitis posticus major and the complexus behind it. Sepa- j-ating it from the arch of the atlas, is the first cervical or suboccipital nerve. I The fourth or intracranial portion extends from the aperture in the dura mater (io the lower border of the pons, where it unites with its fellow to form the basilar iirtery. It here winds round from the side to the front of the medulla, lying in the ertebral groove on the basilar process of the occipital bone. In this course it passes )eneath the first process of the ligamentum dentatum, and between the hypoglossal lerve in front, and the anterior roots of the suboccipital nerve behind.

Cervical portion.—No branch. B. Vertebral portion.—1. Lateral spinal ; 2. muscular. C. Occipital portion.—1. Muscular ; 2. anastomotic. D. Cranial portion.—1. Posterior meningeal; 2. posterior spinal; 3. anterioi spinal; 4. posterior cerebellar. Branches of the Second or Vertebral Portion 1. The lateral spinal branches run through the intervertebral foramina intoth(i vertebral canal, and there divide into two branches: {a) The spinal, which ramifiesj on the backs of the bodies of the cervical vertebra ; and (b) the medullary, whicti runs along the spinal nerves, supplies the cord and its membranes, and anastomosed with the arteries above and below. 2. The muscular branches supply the deejl muscles of the neck, and anastomose with the ascending cervical, occipital, anc j deep cervical arteries. Branches op the Third or Occipital Portion | 1. Muscular, to the muscles forming the suboccipital triangle ; 2. anasto j motic, to the branches of the occipital artery. Branches op the Fourth or Cranial Portion 1. The posterior meningeal is a small branch given off as the vertebral arteri pierces the dura mater to enter the cranium. It supplies the bone and dun mater of the posterior fossa of the skull, and anastomoses with the posterio i meningeal branches derived from the occipital and ascending pharyngeal arteries It gives branches to the falx cerebelli (fig. 387). 2. The posterior spinal artery runs downwards obliquely along the side of tht medulla to the back of the cord, down which it passes behind the roots of the spina i nerves, being reinforced by lateral branches running inwards along these nerves, ii the neck from the vertebral, in the dorsal region from the intercostals, and in th(| lumbar region from the lumbar arteries. It can be traced as low as the end of th(j spinal cord. j 3. The anterior spinal artery comes off from the vertebral a little below itij termination in the basilar artery. Descending obliquely inwards in front of th( j medulla, it unites on a level with the foramen magnum with its fellow of th(| opposite side. The single vessel thus formed runs downwards in front of the spina i cord beneath the pia mater as far as the termination of the cord, being reinforcecj by the lateral spinal branches the whole way down (fig. 387). The spinal arteriei f are described in detail with the anatomy of the spinal cord. \ 4. The posterior inferior cerebellar (fig. 340)—the largest branch of the vertebra j —arises from that vessel just before it joins its fellow to form the basilar artery. A j times it may come off from the basilar itself. It runs, at first outwards across th( j restiform body between the origin of the pneumogastric and hypoglossal nerves, and j descending towards the vallecula, there divides into two branches, an internal an( | external, (a) The internal or inferior vermiform branch runs backwards betweei! the vermiform process and the lateral hemisphere of the cerebellum. It suppliei j the vermiform, process, and anastomoses with the artery of the opposite side, am with the superior vermiform branch of the superior cerebellar, (b) The external o: | hemispheral branch runs outwards, and, ramifying over the under surface of th" i iBASIL AB 543 erebellar hemisphere, siippHes its cortex, and anastomoses along its outer margin n\h the superior cerebellar arteries. From the undivided trunk of the posterior inferior cerebellar artery branches re given to the choroidal plexus and the fourth ventricle. THE BASILAR ARTERY The basilar artery is formed by the confluence of the right and left vertebral rteries, which meet at an acute angle at the lower border of the pons Varolii. It uns forwards and upwards in a slight groove in the middle line of the pons, and ivides at the upper border of that structure at the level of the pretentorial opening ato the two posterior cerebral arteries. Branches of the Basilar Artery The branches of the basilar artery are :—1. Transverse or pontal; 2. internal uditory ; 3. anterior cerebellar ; 4. superior cerebellar ; 5. posterior cerebral. 1. The transverse or pontal arteries are numerous small vessels which come ff at right angles on either side of the basilar artery, and, passing outwards over he pons, supply that structure and adjacent parts of the brain. 2. The internal auditory artery, a long slender vessel, accompanies the auditory lerve into the internal auditory meatus (fig. 387). It here lies between the facial and uditory nerves, and at the bottom of the meatus passes into the internal ear, ,nd anastomoses with the other auditory arteries. (See Internal Ear.) 3. The anterior cerebellar—or anterior inferior cerebellar artery, as it is some- imes called—arises from the basilar soon after its origin, passes outwards and lackwards across the pons, and then over the crus cerebelli to the front part of he under surface of the cerebellum. It anastomoses with the posterior inferior erebellar artery (fig. 340). 4. The superior cerebellar comes off from the basilar immediately behind its ifurcation into the posterior cerebral arteries. It courses outwards and backwards ver the pons, in a curve roughly corresponding to that of the posterior cerebral rtery, from which it is separated by the third cranial nerve; but, soon sinking ito the groove between the pons and the crus cerebri, it curves round the latter tructure on to the upper surface of the cerebellum, lying nearly parallel to the ourth nerve. Here it divides into two branches, an internal and external, (a) The nternal or superior vermiform branch courses backwards along the superior Vermiform process, anastomosing with its fellow of the opposite side, and at the posterior notch of the cerebellum with the inferior vermiform branch of the posterior hferior cerebellar artery, {h) The external or hemispheral branch runs outwards p the circumference of the cerebellum, anastomosing with the external branch of he inferior posterior cerebellar artery. Branches are given off from the main trunk of the superior cerebellar artery, r from its internal branch to the valve of Vieussens, the optic lobes, the pineal land, and the choroid plexus. 5. The posterior cerebral arteries are the two terminal branches into which the iasilar bifurcates at the upper border of the pons immediately behind the posterior lerforated space. Each artery runs at first outwards and a Httle forwards across he crus cerebri immediately in front of the third nerve, which separates it from he superior cerebellar artery. After receiving the posterior communicating artery, vhich runs backwards from the internal carotid, the posterior cerebral turns back- mrds on to the under surface of the cerebral hemisphere, where it breaks up into ranches for the supply of the temporo-sphenoidal and occipital lobes.THE ABTEBIES 5U The branches of the posterior cerebral artery may be divided into the ganghonic or central, and the cortical or hemispheral. {ci) The ganglionic or central branches, are divided into the postero-median ; th( posterior choroid ; and the postero-lateral. (i) The postero-median branches conK off from the posterior cerebral near its origin, and, passing through the cerebra substance forming the posterior perforated spot, supply the inner part of the opti( thalamus and the walls of the third ventricle; (ii) the posterior choroid branch passei through the transverse fissure to the velum interpositum and choroid plexus ; (iii the postero-lateral branches arise external to the spot where the posterior cerebra artery is joined by the posterior communicating. They run to the posterior part o the optic thalamus and give branches to the crus cerebri and optic lobes or corpor; quadrigemina. (h) The cortical or hemispheral branches are distributed as follows:—(i) th uncinate, a branch to the anterior part of the uncinate convokition ; (ii) the temporal a branch to the inferior part of the temporal lobe ; and (iii) the temporo-occipita] i a branch to the cuneus, lingual convolution, and outer surface of the occipital lobtj Here it may be stated, not only in reference to the branches of the posterioj cerebral artery, but also with respect to the branches of the anterior and middlj cerebral arteries, which are described with the internal carotid (page 534), that ther ' is no anastomosis between the cortical and central branches. The cortical ani the central form two distinct and separate systems. The cortical may or ma| not anastomose with each other, but the communication between the neiglj bouring cortical branches is seldom sufficient to maintain the nutrition of an are i when the vessel that normally supplies it is obstructed. The central branches ai so-called end-vessels and do not anastomose with each other. Hence obstructio of the middle cerebral or Sylvian artery leads to softening of the area supplied 1 i its central branches, but not always to softening of the region supplied by its cortic: | branches. Indeed the cortical region may escape completely, although the centr | area is irreparably disorganised. The gross anastomosis of the posterior cerebral wil i the anterior and middle cerebral arteries through the circle of Willis is describe i with the branches of the internal carotid (page 535). j SUMMARY OF THE DISTEIBUTION OF THE CEREBEAL ARTEEIE Here it may be of advantage to give a brief summary of the distribution of tl anterior, middle, and posterior cerebral arteries, the branches of which have alrea( been described in detail. The branches of each are divided into the central ganglionic, and the cortical or hemispheral. The central branches arise at tl commencement of the cerebral arteries about the circle of Willis, whilst t] cortical are derived chiefly from the termination of these vessels. (A) The central branches are divided into six sets—two median and fo lateral. 1. The two median are—(1) The antero-median, which arise from i anterior cerebral and the anterior communicating, and supply the fore end of t caudate nucleus, and (2) the postero-median, which arise from the posterior cerebri, and supply the inner part of the optic thalamus and neighbouring wall of the thi ventricle. 2. The four lateral, two on each side, are also divided into antero-later and postero-lateral. (1) The antero-lateral arise from the middle cerebral, ai passing through the anterior perforated spot, supply the lenticular nucleus, t posterior part of the caudate nucleus, the internal and external capsules, and t outer part of the optic thalamus. (2) The postero-lateral arise from the poster: cerebral, and supply the hinder part of the optic thalamus, the crus, and the op lobes or corpora quadrigemina. (B) The cortical branches ramify in the pia mater, giving off branches to t ^545 INFEBIOB THYBOID ortical substance, some of which extend through it to the underlying white sub- fcance. The cortical branches of the anterior cerebral, roughly speaking, supply 16 median surface of the frontal lobe as far as the precuneus, the inner part of its rbital surface, and part of its convex surface, viz. the highest part of the ascending j:ontal and the first and most of the second frontal convolutions. The cortical [ranches of the middle cerebral—or Sylvian artery as it is often called, because t its relation to the Sylvian fissure—supply the most important area, namely, the [lotor convolutions; and also the largest, namely, the inferior frontal, the ascending larietal, part of the inferior parietal, the supramarginal and angular, the posterior art of the superior parietal, the first temporal, and the anterior part of the second ^nd third temporal convolutions. The cortical branches of the posterior cerebral japply the occipital lobe, and the inferior aspect of the temporal lobe. ! It will be seen, therefore, that the middle cerebral supplies the motor region, both bntral and cortical, except a part of the leg centre. It also supplies the region of he cortex that subserves cutaneous sensibility, the cortical auditory centre, and in art the higher visual centre. It likewise supplies all the cortical regions concerned ji speech processes in the left hemisphere. The anterior cerebral supplies only a nail part of the motor region—namely, the part of the leg centre that occupies 16 paracentral lobule and the highest part of the ascending frontal convolution, 'he posterior cerebral supplies the visual path from the middle of the tract jackwards, and the half vision centre in the occipital lobe. It supplies also the prpora quadrigemina and the sensory part of the internal capsule. THE THYROID AXIS The thyroid axis arises from the upper and front part of the subclavian artery, sually opposite the internal mammary, and a little internal to the inner border of scalenus anticus. It is a short thick trunk, and divides almost immediately ito three radiating branches—namely, the inferior thyroid, the suprascapular, |nd the transverse cervical (fig. 330). Occasionally the posterior scapular branch of the transverse cervical arises from lie third portion of the subclavian ; the superficial cervical, the other branch into hich the transverse cervical divides, then commonly comes off from the axis. THE INFEEIOR THYROID ARTERY The inferior thyroid, the largest of the three branches into which the thyroid ds divides, ascends tortuously upwards and inwards in front of the vertebral artery, 16 recurrent laryngeal nerve, and the longus colli muscle, and behind the common rotid, and the sympathetic nerve or its middle cervical ganglion, to the thyroid dy, where it anastomoses with the superior thyroid artery and the artery of the posite side. It gives off the following branches :—(1) Muscular ; (2) ascending xvical; (3) oesophageal; (4) tracheal; and (5) inferior laryngeal. (1) The muscular branches sup^Dly the scalenus anticus, longus colh, sterno- oid, sterno-thyroid, and omo-liyoid muscles, and the inferior constrictor muscle of e pharynx. (2) The ascending cervical (fig. 329) is given off from the inferior thyroid as at vessel is passing beneath the carotid sheath. It ascends between the scalenus ticus and the rectus capitis anticus major, lying parallel and a little internal to e phrenic nerve and behind the internal jugular vein. It anastomoses with the rtebral, ascending pharyngeal, and occipital arteries, and supplies the following anches \—(a) Muscular, to the deep muscles of the neck; {h) spinal, which enter NTHE ABTEBIES 546 the spinal canal with spinal branches of the vertebral artery; and (c) phrenic, to the phrenic nerve. Two veins accompany the ascending cervical artery, and end in the innominate vein. (3) The oesophageal branches of the inferior thyroid artery supply the oeso- phagus, and anastomose with the other arteries supplying that tube. (4) The tracheal branches ramify on the trachea, where they anastomose with the tracheal branches of the superior thyroid and bronchial arteries. (5) The inferior laryngeal branch passes along the trachea to the back of the cricoid cartilage in company with the recurrent laryngeal nerve. It enters the larynx beneath the inferior constrictor. Its further distribution in that organ is described under Laeynx. | THE SUPEASCAPULAE AETEEY | The suprascapular, or transversalis humeri, passes more or less transversely i outwards across the root of the neck, lying first beneath the sterno-mastoid, and i then in the subclavian triangle behind the clavicle and subclavius muscle. At the external angle of this space it is joined by the suprascapular nerve, sinks beneath the posterior belly of the omo-hyoid, and passes over the ligament bridging j the scapular notch, the nerve passing through the notch (fig. 343). It then ramifies • in the supraspinous fossa of the scapula, and, winding downwards round the base' of the spine over the neck of the scapula, enters the infraspinous fossa, and ter- minates by anastomosing with the dorsal scapular and posterior scapular arteries.: As it lies under cover of the sterno-mastoid muscle, it crosses the phrenic nerve and | the scalenus anticus ; and as it courses through the subclavian triangle, it is sepa-1 rated by the cervical fascia which descends from the omo-hyoid to the first rib, from! the subclavian artery and brachial plexus of nerves. If this artery is seen in tying, the subclavian it should not be injured, as it is one of the chief vessels by which | the collateral circulation is carried on after ligature of the subclavian in the third \ part of its course. At the outer part of the subclavian triangle it is covered by the | trapezius, and after passing over the scapular ligament it pierces the supraspinous fascia and passes beneath the supra-spinatus muscle, and ramifies between it and the bone. In the infraspinous fossa it lies between the infra-spinatus and the bone, The artery is accompanied by two veins. The branches of the suprascapular are as follow :—(1) The inferior sterno- mastoid, given off to that muscle as the vessel crosses behind it; (2) the subclavian, \ to the subclavius muscle ; (3) the nutrient, to the clavicle ; (4) the suprasternal, which passes over the sternal end of the clavicle to the skin of the upper part o\ the chest; (5) the acromial, to the arterial rete or plexus on the acromial pro- cess, to reach which it pierces the trapezius ; (6) the articular, to the acromio- clavicular joint and shoulder joint; (7) the subscapular, given off as the arterjj is passing over the suprascapular ligament, descends to the subscapular fossa between the subscapularis and the bone, and anastomoses with the infrascapulai branch of the dorsal scapular artery, and with the subscapular and posterioi scapular arteries; (8) the supraspinous branches, which ramify in the supra-1 spinous fossa, and supply the supra-spinatus muscle and the periosteum and th(| nutrient artery to the bone ; (9) the infraspinous branches, which ramify in i\ similar way in the infraspinous fossa, giving off like twigs to the infra-spinatufi muscle, the periosteum, and the bone. THE TEANSVEESE CEEVICAL AETEEY | The transverse cervical or transversalis colli artery—somewhat larger thai j the suprascapular artery—runs like the latter vessel transversely outwards acrosTBANSVEBSE CEBYIGAL 547 he root of the neck, but on a slightly higher plane, and a little above the clavicle, it its origin from the thyroid axis it lies under the sterno-mastoid ; on leaving the over of this muscle, it crosses the upper part of the subclavian triangle, lying here nly beneath the platysma and cervical fascia ; further outwards, it passes beneath he anterior margin of the trapezius and omo-hyoid muscle, and at the outer largin of the levator anguli scapulae divides into the posterior scapular and super- ,"cial cervical arteries. In this course it crosses the phrenic nerve, the scalenus nticus, the brachial plexus, and the scalenus medius. At times it passes between he cords of the brachial plexus. The terminal branches of the transverse cervical artery are :—(1) The posterior japular ; and (2) the superficial cervical. The posterior scapular occasionally arises ■cm the third portion of the subclavian artery. Fig. 343.—Diagram of Anastomoses of the Scapular Arteries.

It gives off the following branches :—{a) Supraspinous, which ramifies iitween the supraspinous muscle and the trapezius, and sends branches through IB muscle into the fossa, to anastomose with the suprascapular artery, (b) Infra- liinous branches, one or more of which enter the infraspinous fossa, and ana- mose with the dorsal scapular, (c) Subscapular branches, which enter the N N 2 fe548 THE ABTEBIES subscapular fossa, and anastomose with the suprascapular, infrascapular, and subscapular arteries, {d) Muscular branches, to the muscles between which it runs and to the latissimus dorsi. These branches anastomose with the posterior divisions of the intercostal arteries. (2) The superficial cervical artery, smaller than the posterior scapular, ascends under cover of the anterior margin of the trapezius, lying upon the levator anguli scapulae and splenius muscles. It supplies branches to the trapezius, levator a3iguli scapulae, and splenius muscles, and the posterior chain of lymphatic glands. Itj anastomoses with the superficial branch of the princeps cervicis which descends from the occipital between the splenius and complexus. It is accompanied by two veins. This artery may arise directly from the thyroid axis, or from the third part of thej subclavian artery. THE INTEENAL MAMMAEY AETEKY The internal mammary artery (fig. 344) comes off from the lower part of th( first portion of the subclavian, usually opposite the thyroid axis, close to the inneij edge of the scalenus anticus, occasionally opposite the vertebral, or at a spo between these two vessels. It descends- with a slight inclination forwards an(| inwards, under cover of the clavicle, and enters the thorax behind the cartilage o j the first rib, and thence passes down behind the cartilages of the next succeeding j ribs, about half an inch from the external margin of the sternum, to the sixtlj interspace, where it divides into the superior epigastric and musculo-phrenic. I j is accompanied by two veins, which unite into one trunk behind the first intercosta muscle, and pass to the inner side of the artery into the corresponding ven : innominata; occasionally on the right side into the vena cava superior direc The artery may be divided into two portions, the cervical and the thoracic. The cervical portion is covered by the sterno-mastoid muscle, subclavian veil and internal jugular vein, and is crossed obliquely, from without inwards, by ih phrenic nerve. It rests upon the pleura and courses round the upper part of tb innominate vein. There is no branch from this part of the artery. The thoracic portion lies behind the cartilages of the six upper ribs, an in the interspace between the ribs has in front of it the pectoralis major and tl internal intercostal muscles and the external intercostal membrane. Behind, it in contact above with the pleura, but it is separated from it lower down by sli}; of the triangularis sterni. On the left side the artery between the fourth ai sixth rib may be said to be in the anterior mediastinum the pleura here formir a notch for the heart. In the first, second, and third spaces the artery, if wounde can be easily tied ; but in the fourth space the operation is attended with mo difficulty. The remaining spaces are so narrow that a portion of the cartila^ would have to be removed to expose the vessel. The branches of the internal mammary artery are :—(1) The superior phreni (2) the mediastinal, or thymic ; (3) the pericardiac ; (4) the sternal; (5) the anteri intercostals ; (6) the perforating ; (7) the lateral infracostal; (8) the superi epigastric ; and (9) the musculo-phrenic. (1) The superior phrenic, or comes nervi phrenici, is a long slender ve&sd whi comes off from the internal mammary just after it has entered the chest, descends with the phrenic nerve, at first between the pleura and innominate vei: then between the pleura and the vena cava superior; and lastly, between t! pleura and the pericardium to the diaphragm, where it anastomoses with the ott! diaphragmatic arteries. It gives branches both to the pleura and pericardium, i (2) The mediastinal or thymic branches come ofi^ irregularly from the interi mammary. They are of small size, and supply the connective tissue, fat, a IkINTEBNAL MAMMABY 549 lyraphatics in the superior and anterior mediastina and the remains of the thymus gland. (3) The pericardiac branches are distributed to the anterior surface of the ipericardium. (4) The sternal branches enter the nutrient foramina in the sternum, and also supply the triangularis sterni. (5) The anterior intercostal arteries (fig. 344)—two in each of the five or six upper intercostal spaces—run outwards from the internal mammary artery, along the lower border of the rib above and the upper border of the rib below, and Fig. 344.—Scheme of the Internal Mammary Artery. . Common carotid artery PHRENIC NEliVJ.

Each paij of branches sometimes arises by a common trunk from the internal mammary, which in this case soon divides into an upper and lower branch, as above described. They lie at first between the internal intercostal muscles and the pleura; afterwards between the external and internal intercostal muscles. They supply the contiguous muscles, the pectoralis major, and the ribs. ^ ^ (6) The perforating or anterior perforating branches—five or six in number, one corresponding to each of the five or six upper spaces—come off from the front of the internal mammary, between the superior and inferior anterior intercostals, and, perforating the internal intercostal muscles, pass forwards between the costalTHE ABTEBIES 550 cartilages to the pectoralis major, which they supply. The terminal twigs perforate that muscle close to the sternum, and are distributed to the integument. The second, third, and fourth perforating supply the inner and deep surface of the mammary gland, and become greatly enlarged during lactation. They frequently require ligation in excision of the breast. (7) The lateral infracostal artery (Macalister) is given off close to the first rib, and descends behind the ribs just external to the costal cartilages. It anastomoses with the upper intercostal arteries. This vessel is often of insignificant size, or absent. ! (8) The superior epigastric artery (fig. 344), or internal terminal branch of I the internal mammary artery, leaves the thorax behind the seventh costal carti- lage by passing through the costo-xiphoid space in the diaphragm. It is the direct prolongation of the;internal mammary downwards. In the abdomen it descends behind the rectus muscle, between its posterior surface and its sheath, and, lower, entering the substance of the muscle, anastomoses with the deep epigastric, a branch of the external iliac. It gives off the following small branches :—[a) The phrenic, to the diaphragm ; {h) the xiphoid, which crosses in front of the ensi- form cartilage, and anastomoses with the artery of the opposite side; (c) the cuta- neous, which perforate the anterior layer of the sheath of the rectus and supply the integuments ; {d) the muscular, to the rectus muscle, some of which perforate the rectus sheath laterally, and are distributed to the oblique muscles ; {e) the hepatic (on the right side only), which pass along the falciform ligament to the liver, and anastomose with the hepatic artery; (/) the peritoneal which perforate the posterior layer of the sheath of the rectus, and ramify on the peritoneum. (9) The musculo-phrenic, or external terminal branch of the internal mammary ! artery, skirts outwards and downwards behind the costal cartilages of the false ribs along the costal attachments of the diaphragm, which it perforates opposite the i ninth rib. It terminates, much reduced in size, at the tenth or eleventh intercostal I space by anastomosing with the ascending branch of the deep circumflex iliac artery. It gives off in its course the following small branches :—[a) The phrenic for the supply of the diaphragm ; {h) the anterior intercostals, two in number for each of the lower five or six intercostal spaces, are distributed like those to the upper spaces, already described, and anastomose like them with the corresponding branches of the lower aortic intercostals; (c) the muscular for the supply of the oblique muscles; of the abdomen. Beain^ches of the Second Part of the Sueclayiak Aeieey THE SUPEEIOE INTEECOSTAL AETEEY 1. The superior intercostal artery (fig. 845) usually arises from the back part of the second portion of the subclavian artery, behind the scalenus anticus on the right side, but sometimes just internal to that muscle on the left side. It at first runs backwards and a little upwards above the apex of the pleura, and then turns i downwards and enters the thorax in front of the neck of the first rib. It terminates - in a branch which runs forwards in the first intercostal space. Frequently, and j especially on the right side, it is continued in front of the neck of the second rib, and j supplies a branch to the second intercostal space. This branch may then be reinforced by an intercostal from the aorta, which supplies the space when the; branch is not present. As the superior intercostal crosses the neck of the first j rib, it lies internal to the anterior branch of the first dorsal nerve, and externa | | to the superior thoracic ganglion of the sympathetic. That part of the superior I intercostal which intervenes between its origin from the subclavian and its first I branch, is sometimes called the costo-cervical artery. I ISUPERIOR INTERCOSTAL 551 j Branches.—The superior intercostal gives off:—(1) The deep cervical; (2) the [first intercostal; and (3) the arteria aberrans. (1) The deep cervical branch is given off from the superior intercostal just Defore the latter enters the thorax. It passes directly backwards, first between the seventh and eighth cervical nerves, and then between the transverse process of the l^eventh cervical vertebra and the neck of the first rib, having the body of the |;eventh cervical vertebra to its inner side, and the intertransverse muscle to its outer jdde. It then turns upwards in the groove between the transverse and spinous i)rocesses of the cervical vertebrae lying upon the semispinalis colli. It is covered !)y the complexus. Between these muscles, near the axis, it anastomoses with the ileep branch of the princeps cervicis of the occipital artery. The deep cervical is iiomologous in its course to the posterior branch of an aortic intercostal, being aorphologically the posterior branch of the intercostal artery for the seventh Fig. 345.—Scheme of the Superior Intercostal Artery.

(2) The first intercostal branch runs forwards in the first intercostal space, and, ike the second intercostal branch, which, when present, runs to the second space on he right side, resembles in its course and distribution the succeeding mtercostais lerived from^the aorta. (See Branches of Thoracic Aorta.) (3) The arteria aberrans, when present, comes off from the inner side ot tne ight superior intercostal, and occasionally from the right subclavian itself. It ilescends as a delicate vessel into the thorax, passing backwards and inwards behind the oesophagus as far as the third thoracic vertebra, where m some cases it isTHE ARTERIES 552 i pectoralis major and the integuments. found to anastomose with a similar delicate branch coming off from the aorta below the ductus arteriosus. This anastomosis, which represents the remains of the right dorsal aortic stem, may become enlarged, and the subclavian artery on the right side be derived from the arch of the aorta. This accounts for the subclavian in such circumstances passing behind the oesophagus. (See Variations of the Aech of THE Aorta.) THE AXILLARY ARTERY The term axillary is applied to that portion of the main arterial stem of the upper limb that passes through the axilla. The axillary artery therefore is continuous with the subclavian above and with the brachial below. It extends from the outer border of the first rib to the lower edge of the teres major muscle, and has the shoulder joint and the neck of the humerus to its outer side. When the arm is placed close to the side of the body, the artery forms a gentle curve with its convexity upwards ; but when the arm is carried out from the side at right angles to the trunk in the ordinary dissecting position, the vessel takes a nearly straight course, which will then be indicated by a line drawn from the middle of the clavicle to a spot midway between the condyles of the humerus. The axillary artery is at first deeply placed beneath the pectoral muscles, but in its lower third is superficial, being covered only by the skin and the superficial fascia and deep fascia. It is divided ["into three parts—first, second, and third, according as it lies above, beneath, or below the pectoralis minor. The First Part of the Axillary Artery The first part of the axillary artery extends from the outer border of the first rib to the upper border of the pectoralis minor. It measures about an inch in length (2-5 cm.). ! Eelations.—In front it is covered by the skin, superficial fascia, the origin oi the platysma, the deep fascia, the pectoralis major, the costo-coracoid membrane,] the subclavius muscle and the clavicle when the arm hangs down by the side. The | cephalic and acromio-thoracic veins, the external anterior thoracic nerve, and th( | axillary tymphatic trunk, cross over it. A layer of the deep cervical fascia whichj has passed under the clavicle also descends in front of it. I Behind, it rests upon the first intercostal space and first intercostal muscle, th( second digitation and sometimes a portion of the third digitation of the serratu? magnus muscle, and a part of the second rib. The posterior or external respirator; nerve of Bell, on its way to the serratus magnus muscle, passes behind it. i To its outer side, and somewhat on a higher plane, are the cords of the brachia | plexus. i To its inner side, and on a slightly anterior plane, is the axillary vein. Th anterior internal thoracic nerve courses between the vein and the artery. The Second Part of the Axillary Artery The second part of the axillary artery (fig. 346) lies beneath the pectorali minor deep in the axilla. It measures a little more than an inch in leng-th (3 cm. Relations.—In front, in addition to the pectoralis minor, it is covered by th i,AXILLABY 553 Behind, it is separated by a considerable interval containing loose connective issue and fat from the subscapularis muscle ; whilst behind, and in contact with is the posterior cord of the brachial plexus. To the inner side, but separated from the artery by the inner cord of the rachial plexus, is the axillary vein. To the outer side is the outer cord of the brachial plexus, and at some little istance the coracoid process. It is thus seen that the second portion of the axillary artery is surrounded on tiree sides by the cords of the brachial plexus—one behind, one internal, and one xternal. The Thied Paet of the Axillary Aeteey I The third part of the axillary artery (fig. 346) extends from the lower border |£ the pectoralis minor to the lower border of the teres major. Its upper half jes deeply placed within the axilla, beneath the lower edge of the pectoralis major puscle, but its lower half is in the arm external to the axilla, and is uncovered by [luscle. It measures about three inches in length (7'5 cm.), i; Relations.—In front it has, in addition to the skin and superficial fascia, the ectoralis major above, and lower down the deep fascia of the arm. It is crossed bliquely by the inner root of the median nerve and by the outer brachial vena omes. Behind, it lies successively upon the subscapularis, the latissimus dorsi, and teres iiajor muscles. From the first-named muscle it is separated at first by a consider- ble mass of fat and cellular tissue. The musculo-spiral and circumflex nerves itervene between the artery and the muscles. On its outer side it is separated from the bone by the coraco-brachialis, by which is partly overlapped, this muscle and the short head of the biceps serving as a aide to the artery in ligature. For a part of its course it has also the musculo- ntaneous nerve and the outer root of the median nerve to its outer side. To its inner side it has the axillary vein, the ulnar nerve, the internal cutaneous erve, the lesser internal cutaneous nerve, and the inner root of the median nerve, he ulnar nerve is between the artery and the vein. The internal cutaneous nerve 1 a little in front of the artery as well as internal to it. Variations in the Axillary Artery The chief variations in the axillary artery are :—[a) It may give off the radial artery; )) more rarely, the ulnar artery ; (c) still more rarely, the interosseous artery, or a vas berrans; {d) it may give off a common trunk, from which may arise the subscapular, 16 anterior and posterior circumflex, and the superior and inferior profunda arteries. The ranches of the brachial plexus usually surround this common trunk, and not what is pparently the main brachial artery. The latter vessel indeed would seem in many of these istances to be really an enlarged vas aberrans, and the common trunk the main brachial rtery, the lower portion of which has been obliterated, i.e. obliterated from the last branch liven off from the common trunk to the spot where it is again joined by the vas afberrans. ) The axillary artery may be covered in the third part of its course by a muscular slip (the Tsi axillaris), derived from the upper part of the tendon of the latissimus dorsi, and always esent in early fcetal life, though as a rule atrophied later. Branches of the Axillary Artery The first part gives oft :—(1) The 'superior thoracic ; and (2) the acromio- loracic. The second part gives off :—(1) The long thoracic ; and (2) the alar thoracic. The third part gives off:—(1) The subscapular ; (2) the anterior circumflex; nd (3) the posterior circumflex.TUN Airri':i:ih:s ;VIC.. 'VWK liOWI'.l! VaUT OI."

The superior or short thoracic is variously given off from the axillary artery, i|Ually either as a common trmik with the next branch, the acromial thoracic, or iliittle above. It passes behind the axillary vein across the first intercostal space, J pplying-the intercostal muscles and the upper portion of the serratus magnus, and i|.astomoses with the intercostal arteries. At times it sends a branch between the ]|ctoralis major and minor, which then, as a rule, more or less takes the place of ts pectoral branch of the acromial thoracic. 2. The acromio-thoracic, or thoracic axis, arises from the front part of the dllary just above the upper border of the pectoralis minor. It is a short trunk, jd coming off from the front of the artery pierces the costo-coracoid membrane, i d then divides into three or four small branches, named from their direction :— ) the acromial, or thoracica acromialis ; {h) the humeral, or thoracica humerahs ; (il the pectoral, or short thoracic of some authors ; and {d) the clavicular. {a) The acromial branch or branches pass outwards across the coracoid process, 1 iquently through the deltoid muscle, which they in part supply, to the acromion, uere they form, by anastomosing with the anterior and posterior circumflex and jprascapular arteries, the so-called acromial rete, or plexus of vessels on the (rface of that process. {h) The humeral branch—the descending branch of some authors—runs down- rzds with the cephalic vein in the interval between the pectoralis major and the (Itoid, and, supplying lateral offsets to these muscles and the adjacent integuments, lastomoses with the anterior and posterior circumflex arteries. (c) The pectoral branch passes between the pectoralis major and minor muscles, Ijth of which it supplies, and the superimposed mammary gland. In the female, (|e or more of these branches which perforate the pectoralis major are often of ]:ge size. {d) The clavicular branch passes upwards beneath the clavicle, and supplies e subclavius muscle, and anastomoses Avith the suprascapular artery. Branches of the Second Part of the Axillary Artery 1. The long thoracic artery—also called the external mammary—descends Jf)ng the lower border of the pectoralis minor, under cover of the pectoralis ijijor, to the walls of the chest. It supplies both pectoral muscles and the irratus magnus, sends branches round the lower border of the pectoralis major to ;e mammary gland, and terminates in the intercostal muscles by anastomosing ^th the aortic intercostals and the internal mammary. It also furnishes branches l| the glands of the axilla. The branches to the mammary gland in the female often of large size. 2. The alar thoracic are small branches given off either directly from the axillary i tery to the Ij^mphatic glands in the axilla, or from some of the other branches of l!3 first or second part of the axillary artery. I Branches of the Third Part of the Axillary Artery ! 1. The subscapular artery is the largest branch of the axillary. It arises cbosite the lower border of the subscapularis, and runs downwards and inwards a ng the anterior border of that muscle under cover of the latissimus dorsi as ( as the angle of the scapula, where it anastomoses with the dorsal scapular Interior scapular, long thoracic, infrascapular, and the intercostal arteries. The liig subscapular nerve accompanies it. It supplies the subscapularis, teres major.THE AETEBIES 556 latissimns clorsi, and serratus magnus muscles, and gives branches to the glands in the axillary space. The course of this large vessel along the posterior border of the axilla should be remembered in opening abscesses in the axilla, and in removing enlarged glands from this space. It is accompanied by two veins, which usually unite and then receive the dorsal scapular vein, and open as a single vein of large size either into the axillary or at the confluence of the inner brachial vena comes with the basilic vein. About an inch to an inch and a half from its origin, the subscapular artery gives off the following large branch :— The dorsal scapular, arising from the subscapular, usually at the above-mentioned Fig. 347.—The Dorsal Scapular Artery. (From a dissection in the Museum of the Eoyal College of Surgeons.) Supra-spinatus Posterior scapular arlery Suprascapular artery Infra-spinatus Rliomboideiis minor Levator anguli seapulse I Triceps Deltoid, insertion Deltoid Deltoid muscle Trapezius Bhomboideus major Teres major muscle Triceps Teres major, insertion Posterior circumflex artery Dorsalis scapulce artery spot, passes backwards through the triangular space bounded by the subscapularif above, the teres major below, and the long head of the triceps externally, and thei between the teres minor and the axillary border of the scapula, which it commonlj grooves. It thus reaches the infraspinous fossa, where, under cover of the infra spinatus, it anastomoses with the suprascapular and posterior scapular arteries (fig. 347). As it passes through the triangular space, it gives off a ventral branch sometimes called the infrascapular, which ramifies between the subscapularis am the bone, supplying branches to the subscapularis, to the scapula, and to]the shoulde joint. A second branch is often given off near the triangular space and passes down wards between the teres major and teres minor, supplying both muscles (fig.'348^ j 'Sii557 AXILLARY The chief variations in the subscapular artery are :—(a) It may come off with the jsterior circumflex; (&) it may arise from a trmik common to several other of the 1 mches of the third part of the axillary artery and upper part of the brachial artery ; and its dorsal scapular branch may arise from the axillary direct. 2. The anterior circumflex, usually quite a small vessel, comes off from the ter side of the axillary artery, generally opposite the posterior circumflex. It isses beneath the coraco-brachialis and short and long heads of the biceps, winding imsversely round the front of the surgical neck of the humerus, across the bicipital joove, and anastomoses with the posterior circumflex and acromial thoracic arteries, gives off the following small branches: {a) the bicipital or ascending, which runs I the bicipital groove to supply the long tendon of the biceps and the shoulder int; and (h) a pectoral or descending branch, which runs downwards along the jlsertion of the pectoralis major, and supplies the tendon of that muscle. The terior circumflex artery, in consequence of its being close to the bone, is some- nes difficult to secure in the operation for excision of the shoulder joint. Chief variations.—{a) It may be given off from the posterior circumflex ; or (6) from a i m common to it and several other vessels. (See Variations in the Axillary Artery, ge 553.)

The posterior circumflex artery (fig. 348) arises from the hinder part of the xillary, just below the lov^er border of the subscapularis muscle. It passes hrough the quadrilateral space, bounded by the teres minor above, the latissimus brsi and teres major below, the humerus externally, and the long head of the riceps internally, and, winding round the back of the humerus beneath the deltoid, )reaks up under cover of that muscle into a leash of branches, which for the most558 THE ABTEBIES part enter its substance. The circumflex nerve and two venae comites run with it It anastomoses with the anterior circumflex, the arteries on the acromion, and th( superior profunda artery. In addition to the leash of vessels to the deltoid, it gives off the following small branches :—{a) nutrient, to the greater tuberosity of the humerus ; [h) articular to the back of the shoulder joint; (c) acromial, to the plexus on the acromion ; and {d) muscular, to the teres minor and long and short heads of the triceps. One oi more of these branches to the triceps (the tricipital) descend either between the outer and long head, or in the substance of that muscle to anastomose with'an Fig. 349.—The Anastomoses about the Scapula.

It is by means of this anastomosis that the collateral circulation is chiefly carried on when the axillary or the brachial artery is tied between the origins of the posterior circumflex and superior profunda arteries (fig. 330). The chief variations in the posterior circumflex are :—{a) It may arise with the sub- scapular artery as a common trunk. (6) It may come off from the brachial, and run up behind the teres major to the quadrilateral space, (c) It ma,y give off the inferior pro- funda, the anterior circumflex, or the dorsal scapular, (d) It may be double, {e) It may form one of the vessels arising from a trunk common to several branches of the axillary and brachial arteries. (See Variations in the Axillary Artery, page 553.)559 BEAG HIAL THE BRACHIAL ARTERY The brachial artery, the continuation of the axillary, extends from the lower rder of the teres major to a little below the centre of the crease at the bend of 18 elbow, where it divides, opposite the jmiction of the head with the neck of the Fig. 350.—The BRAcmAL Artery.

Throughout the greater part of ] course the artery is superficial, being merely overlapped slightly on its outer si by the coraco-brachiahs and biceps muscles ; but at the bend of the elbow it sin deeply beneath the semilunar fascia of the biceps into the triangular interv; bounded on either side by the supinator longus and pronator radii teres, and at i Fig. 351.—The Brachial Artery at the Bend of the Elbow.

A line dra from midway between the folds of the axilla at the outer side of that space midway between the condyles of the humerus, will indicate its course. It accompanied by two veins which frequently communicate across the artery. Relations.—In front, the artery is covered by the integuments and superficial a deep fasciae, and at the bend of the elbow by the semilunar fascia of the biceps, and ii muscular subjects by the overlapping margins of the supinator longus and pronal' radii teres. In the middle third of the arm it is crossed obliquely from with(jl; inwards by the median nerve, and at the bend of the elbow by the median has vein, the bicipital fascia intervening (fig. 357). Behind, it lies successively on the long head of the triceps (from which it561 BE AC HIAL .iparated by the musculo-spiral nerve and superior profunda artery), on the inner lead of the triceps, on the insertion of the coraco-brachialis, and thence to its ifurcation on the brachialis anticus muscle. I External to the artery is the coraco-brachialis above, and the muscular belly of le biceps below, both of which slightly overlap the vessel, and at the bend of the bow the tendon of the biceps. The external vena comes is also to its outer side, he median nerve is in close contact with the outer side of the artery in the upper lird of its course, but in the middle third crosses the artery obhquely to gain the jiner side. Internal to the artery in the upper part of its course are the internal cutaneous id the ulnar nerves ; the latter nerve, however, leaves the artery about the origin I the inferior profunda branch, to make, with that vessel, for the internal condyle, ower down, the internal cutaneous nerve also leaves the artery, by piercing the ^ep fascia. The median nerve is in close contact with the inner side of the artery [ its lower third and at the bend of the elbow. The basilic vein is superficial to it, lid a little to its inner side in the greater part of its course, but separated from i by the deep fascia. The internal vena comes runs along its inner side. The Variations in the Brachial Artery The chief variations in the brachial artery are :—(1) A high division into its terminal [■anches. The high division may occur at any spot in the normal course of the vessel, but 1 most common in the upper third of the arm, and least common in the middle third. The /o vessels into which the brachial then divides as a rule run parallel to each other to the aid of the elbow in the usual situation of the brachial, whence one follows the normal lOTse of the radial artery through the forearm, and the other takes the normal com'-se of , e ulnar artery, giving off as usual the common interosseous artery. This arrangement ay be considered a simple high division of the brachial. At other times the disposition of ! e two vessels is different : thus (i) the two arteries may communicate at the elbow by a OSS branch, or reimite, and then again divide in the usual manner, (ii) One vessel may How the course of the ulnar artery in the forearm, and the other divide into the radial and I mmon interosseous. This condition is spoken of as a high origin of the ulnar, (iii) One jtery may divide into the radial and ulnar as usual, and the other take the course of the immon interosseous and divide into the anterior and posterior interosseous arteries; or, iich more rarely, take the course of the posterior interosseous artery, the anterior inter- seous coming from the ulnar, (iv) The vessels may follow a course in the upper arm fferent to that of the normal brachial. Thus (A) the branch representing the radial may !) cross over or under the other branch; (6) perforate the deep fascia above the elbow, ■d run beneath the skin to its place in the forearm; or (c) pass behind the tendon of the 3eps. (B) The branch representing the ulnar may {a) run to the front of the inner condyle th the median nerve, and thence reach its usual situation by descending from within I twards beneath the fascia and pronator teres, or, more rarely, beneath some of the flexor kiseles, or merely beneath the skin; or (&) it may run with the ulnar nerve behind the liier condyle, and thence beneath the muscles to its usual place in the forearm. (2) An llarged vas aherrans may be present. This is a long slender vessel, which arises from the iachial usually near the origin of the superior profunda, and joins most commonly the jiial artery, or, more rarely, one of its branches, or the ulnar. It is said to be usually jesent, though not admitting of complete injection, and to descend over the median nerve the biceps muscle. At times this vessel takes the place of the brachial; the median |rve will then be found behind the artery. (8) The brachial may run with the median rve towards the inner condyle, where it then usually turns round a supracondyloid process ier the course normally taken by the artery in the Felidae, in which it rmis through a pracondyloid foramen. Thence it descends to its normal situation beneath the pronator "es, which then usually arises from a fibrous expansion from the process. (4) The brachial ly be covered by various muscular slips derived from the adjacent muscles. (5) Certain (normalities in the giving off of its collateral branches. These are referred to under each jinch. j Branches of the Brachial Artery I The branches of the brachial artery are :—(1) The superior profimda ; (2) the [ferior profunda ; (3) the anastomotica magna ; (4) the nutrient; (5) the muscular ; i^d (6) the terminal branches—the radial and ulnar arteries. 0 0562 THE ABTEBIES (1) The Supeeior Peofunda Aeteey The superior profunda is the largest of the branches of the brachial. It arises from the inner and hinder aspect of that artery, a little below the inferior border of the tendon of the teres major. It at first lies to the inner side of the brachial, but soon passes behind that vessel, and, sinking between the inner and long heads of the triceps with the musculo-spiral nerve, curves round the humerus in the musculo-spiral groove, lying in contact with the bone between the inner and outer heads of the triceps. On reaching the external supracondyloid ridge of the humerus, it perforates the external intermuscular septum, and, continuing forward | between the supinator longus and brachialis anticus to the front of the external ! condyle, ends by anastomosing with the radial recurrent artery. | It gives off the following branches :— (a) The ascending branch, which runs upwards in the substance of the triceps, or between the outer and inner heads of that muscle, to anastomose with the tricipital branch of the posterior circumflex artery. The importance of this anastomosis in carrying on the collateral circulation after ligature of the third part of the axillary artery below the circumflex, or the brachial above the profunda, has already been mentioned (page 558). (b) The cutaneous branch, Avhich runs with the external cutaneous branch of the musculo-spiral nerve to supply the skin of the outer side of the arm. (c) The articular branch, which is often larger than the continued trunk of the j superior profunda itself, is given off from the artery just before it perforates the I intermuscular septum, runs downwards in the substance of the triceps to the back j of the external condyle, where it anastomoses with the interosseous recurrent, and! Tli forms an arterial arch by anastomosing with the anastomotica magna across the backl m. of the lower end of the humerus immediately above the olecranon fossa. FromI fail this arch or rete small twigs enter and supply the elbow joint. iticiis {d) A nutrient artery is sometimes given to the upper end of the humerus. j sp (e) Muscular branches to the triceps. Chief variations.—The superior profunda may arise {a) from the axillary artery in common with one or more branches of that vessel; or (h) as a common trunk with the inferior profunda, (c) It may give off the posterior circumflex, which then runs upwards behind the teres major to reach the back of the shoulder. (2) The Infeeioe Peofunda Aeteey The inferior profunda arises from the inner side of the brachial, usually 'N about the level of the insertion of the coraco-brachialis, at times as a common trunk with the superior profunda. It passes with the ulnar nerve obliquely down- wards and inwards through the internal intermuscular septum, and then along tht inner head of the triceps to the back of the internal condyle where, under cover oi the deep fascia and the origin of the flexor carpi ulnaris from the olecranon and internal condyle, it anastomoses with the posterior ulnar recurrent and anasto- motica magna arteries. It frequently supplies the nutrient artery to the humerus It gives branches to the triceps, to the elbow joint, and a branch which passes irj %i front of the internal condyle to anastomose with the anterior ulnar recurrent. Chief variations.—(1) The inferior profunda may arise [a) with the superior profunda (6) from a trunk common to several other branches of the axillary and brachial arteries (2) It may be absent, its place being taken by the anastomotica magna. (3) The Anastomotica Magna Aeteey The anastomotica magna arises from the inner side of the brachial, about tw( inches above its bifurcation into the radial and ulnar arteries, and, running down 16 ilia ian itapp !(iclosi )lef Slleri m'i fteo563 BE A GHIAL— ULNAR 7ards and inwards across the brachialis antieus, divides into two branches, a posterior ,nd an anterior. The posterior pierces the internal intermuscular septum, winds ound the internal condyloid ridge of the humerus, and pierces the triceps, between sfhioh. and the bone it anastomoses with the articular branch of the superior )rofunda artery, and to a lesser extent with the interosseous recurrent, forming ,n arterial arch or rete round the upper border of the olecranon fossa. The jiiiterior branch passes downwards and inwards between the brachialis antieus and )ronator teres, and anastomoses in front of the internal condyle, but beneath the pronator teres with the anterior ulnar recurrent. From this branch a small vessel )asses down behind the internal condyle to anastomose with the posterior ulnar ecurrent and inferior profunda arteries. Chief variations.—{a) The anastomotica magna may take the place of tlie inferior pro- janda. (6) It may be very small, the inferior profunda taking its place. (4) The Nuteient Arteky of the Humerus The nutrient artery of the humerus comes off from the brachial about the evel of the insertion of the coraco-brachialis, or from the inferior profunda, or rom one of the muscular branches. It passes obliquely downwards through the jiutrient foramen, and on entering the medullary canal of the humerus divides into an ascending and descending branch, of which the latter is the larger. (5) The Muscular Branches op the Brachial The muscular branches are irregular in their number, origin, and distribu- ion. They vary from about five to eight, usually come off from the outer part of he artery, and are distributed to the coraco-brachialis, biceps, and brachialis aiticus muscles. The nutrient artery of the humerus frequently arises from the ippermost muscular branch. THE ULNAR ARTERY The ulnar artery, the larger of the two terminal branches of the brachial, begins opposite the lower border of the head of the radius in the middle line of the fore- jirm. Thence through the upper half of the forearm it runs in a slight curve, with its lonvexity inwards, deeply beneath the pronator teres and superficial flexor muscles, jmd, having reached the ulnar side of the limb about midway between the elbow imd the wrist, it passes directly downwards, being merely overlapped by the flexor iarpi ulnaris. Crossing the annular ligament immediately to the radial side of the )isiform bone, it enters the palm, where it divides into two branches, which enter •espectively into the formation of the superficial and deep palmar arches. The ilrtery is accompanied by two veins, which anastomose with each other by frequent bross branches, and usually terminate in the brachial venae comites ; or sometimes ihe inner vena comes ends in the inner brachial vein, the outer vena comes in the median profunda vein. The ulnar nerve is at first some distance from the artery, but approaches the vessel at the junction of its upper and middle thirds, and then lies close to its inner or ulnar side. The course of the artery in the lower two-thirds :)f the forearm is indicated by a line drawn from the front of the internal condyle |;o the radial side of the pisiform bone ; and in the upper third of the forearm by I line drawn in a gentle curve with its convexity inwards from an inch below the centre of the bend of the elbow to a point in the former line at the junction of its o o 2564 THE ABTEBIES upper with its middle third. The artery throughout its course is best reached | through the innermost intermuscular septum, i.e. the interval between the flexor ! carpi ulnaris, and the flexor sublimis digitorum. | The relations of the artery will be given in detail—as it lies in the forearm, at the wrist, and in the palm of the hand.

Eelations of the Ulnar Artery in the Forearm In front.—In the upper half of the forearm the ulnar artery is deeply placecl beneath the pronator teres, the flexor carpi radiahs, the palmaris longus, and th( | flexor sublimis digitorum. In the lower half it is comparatively superficial, bein^jULNAB 565 merely overlapped above by the tendon of the flexor carpi ulnaris, whilst the last inch i or so of the vessel is only covered as a rule by the skin and superficial and deep fascige. As the artery lies beneath the pronator teres, it is crossed from within outwards by the median nerve, the deep head of origin of the muscle usually separating the nerve from the artery. The lower part of the artery is crossed by the palmar cutaneous branch of the ulnar nerve. Behind.—For about an inch of its course the artery lies upon the brachialis anticus; but thence, as far as the anterior annular ligament of the wrist, upon the flexor profundus digitorum, which separates it above from the interosseous membrane and bone, and at the wrist from the pronator quadratus. The artery is bound down jto the flexor profunda digitorum by bands of fascias. To the outer side in the lower two-thirds of its course is the flexor sublimis digitorum. To the inner side in the lower two-thirds is the flexor carpi ulnaris, the guide to the vessel. The ulnar nerve, as it enters the forearm from behind the inner j condyle, is at first some distance from the artery, being separated from it in its I upper third by the flexor sublimis digitorum, but in its lower two-thirds is in close I contact with the vessel and on its ulnar side. Variations of the Ulnar Artery in the Forearm The principal variations of tlie ulnar artery in the forearm are: (A) It may arise from the brachial above the usual point of division or from the axillary, in which case it usually runs over the flexor muscles, but beneath the fascia, to reach its usual situation in the forearm. The recurrent arteries and the common interosseous are then usually derived from the trunk vessel from which the ulnar is given off. At times it runs beneath the muscles, or merely beneath the skin. (B) It may in some cases of high division of the brachial run beneath the fascia throughout its whole extent in the forearm. (C) In some cases of normal origin from the brachial it takes a superficial course in the forearm, being merely covered by the fascia, the recurrent branches and the common interosseous then arising from the radial. The branches of the ulnar artery in the forearm are :—1. The anterior ulnar recurrent. 2. The posterior ulnar recurrent. 3. The interosseous, or common interosseous: {a) anterior interosseous—(i) arteria comes nervi mediani, (ii) muscular, (iii) medullary, (iv) anterior communicating; (6) posterior interosseous —(i) interosseous recurrent, (ii) muscular, (iii) articular. 4. Muscular. 5. Nutrient. 6. Posterior ulnar carpal. 7. Anterior ulnar carpal. 1. The anterior ulnar recurrent is a small branch which leaves the inner iside of the ulnar artery soon after its origin, and, running upwards and inwards between the outer edge of the pronator teres and the brachialis anticus, anastomoses in front of the internal condyle with the anastomotica magna and a branch of the inferior profunda artery. It supplies branches to the muscles between which it runs. 2. The posterior ulnar recurrent, larger than the anterior ulnar recurrent, comes off from the inner side of the ulnar artery, either a little below the latter branch, or else as a common trunk with it, and, passing inwards between the flexor sublimis and flexor profundus digitorum, turns upwards to the back of the internal condyle, where it lies with the ulnar nerve beneath the two heads of origin of the flexor icarpi ulnaris. It supplies the contiguous muscles—the flexor carpi ulnaris, the palmaris longus, and the flexor sublimis and profundus digitorum—the elbow joint and the ulnar nerve, and anastomoses with the inferior profunda, with the anasto- motica magna, and with the interosseous recurrent, forming the so-called rete lolecrani. 3. The interosseous or common interosseous artery, is a short thick trunk half an inch or so in length, which comes off from the outer and back part of the ulnar about566 THE ARTERIES an inch from its origin, and just before the ulnar artery is crossed by the median nerve. It passes backwards and downwards between the flexor longus pollicis and the flexor profundus digitorum, towards the triangular interval bounded by the upper border of the interosseous membrane, the oblique ligament, and the outer border of the ulna, where it divides into the anterior and posterior interosseous arteries. [a) The anterior interosseous artery, smaller than the posterior, but apparently the direct continuation of the common trunk, courses downwards in front of the interosseous membrane, upon which it lies under cover of the overlapping edges of the flexor profundus digitorum and flexor longus pollicis, to the upper border of the pronator quadratus, where it terminates in two branches, an anterior terminal and posterior terminal. The anterior interosseous artery is accompanied by two veins and by the deep branch of the median nerve which lies to its radial side. The artery is bound down to the interosseous membrane by aponeurotic fibres. The branches of the anterior interosseous artery are :—(i) The arteriaj conies nervi mediani—or the median artery as it is sometimes shortly called—is ai long slender vessel, which arises from the anterior interosseous immediately after the latter is given off from the common trunk. It passes forwards between thej flexor profundus digitorum and the flexor longus pollicis to the median nerve, with which it descends beneath the annular ligament into the palm, and when of large! size sometimes enters into the formation of the superficial palmar arch. At times the artery arises from the common interosseous before its division, (ii) Musculai: branches supply the flexor longus pollicis, flexor profundus digitorum, and pronatci; quadratus, and the extensor muscles of the thumb, which they reach by passing! backwards through the interosseous membrane, (iii) The nutrient arteries of the radius and ulna are usually derived from this vessel, (iv) The anterior termina,' and smaller division of the anterior interosseous artery, sometimes called th( anterior communicating, passes either in front of or behind the pronator quadratus; but in either case in front of the interosseous membrane, and anastomoses wit! the anterior carpal branches of the radial and ulnar arteries, and with the recur rent branches from the deep palmar arch, forming the so-called anterior carpa rete. (v) The posterior terminal and larger division pierces the interosseou membrane, and continues its course downwards behind the interosseous membrane- under cover of the extensor muscles, to the back of the wrist, where it endii by anastomosing with the posterior carpal branches of the radial and ulna arteries, forming the so-called posterior carpal rete. This branch anastomoses! as soon as it pierces the interosseous membrane, with the posterior interosseou artery. {h) The posterior interosseous artery, the larger division of the commo] interosseous, turns backwards through the triangular interval bounded by th interosseous membrane below, the oblique ligament above, and the ulna internall} and, emerging at the back of the forearm between the extensor ossis metacarpi polhci and the supinator brevis, under cover of the superficial extensors of the forearn: descends between the superficial and the deep muscles, crossing in this course th extensor ossis metacarpi pollicis, the extensor primi internodii pollicis, the extenso secundi internodii pollicis, and the indicator (fig. 353). It anastomoses at th lower border of this muscle with the anterior interosseous, or with the posteric branch of the anterior interosseous which here, as above described, has perforate the interosseous membrane. j J'^'fs It gives off the following branches :—(i) The interosseous recurrent, or pos % terior interosseous recurrent (fig. 353), arises from the posterior interosseous as th| i-*clei latter emerges from beneath the supinator brevis. It runs upwards between the anc( j neus and supinator brevis, usually under cover of the former, to the interval betwee IULNAB 567 the external condyle and the olecranon, where it anastomoses with the superior profunda, anastomotica magna, radial recurrent, and posterior ulnar recurrent Fig. 353.—The Back of the Forearm, with the Posterior Interosseous Artery AND Branches of the Eadial at the Back of the Wrist.

The muscular branches of the ulnar artery supply the contiguous muscles, I and are variable in number, origin, and distribution. IiTHE ABTEBIES 568 5. The nutrient artery of the ulna may be given off from the main trunk of the | ulnar artery, or from one of its muscular branches, or from the anterior inter- 1 osseous artery. I 6. The posterior ulnar carpal comes off from the ulnar artery a little above | the anterior annular ligament, and, winding inwards round the end of the ulna i or the internal lateral ligament of the wrist, beneath the flexor carpi ulnaris, j ramifies on the bach of the carpus beneath the extensor tendons. It forms by ' its anastomosis with the posterior radial carpal and with the posterior branch of | the anterior interosseous and with the posterior interosseous arteries, a plexus | or rete, the so-called posterior carpal arch. The branches given off from this j plexus or arch are described with the posterior carpal branch of the radial artery i (page 574). i 7. The anterior ulnar carpal is a small branch given off from the ulnar artery I opposite the carpus. It passes beneath the flexor profundus digitormn to anasto- | mose with the anterior radial carpal, with terminal twigs of the anterior branch of the anterior interosseous, and with recurrent branches from the deep palmar arch, forming an anastomotic arch across the front of the carpus—the so-caUed anterior carpal arch or rete. II. Eelations of the Ulnae Arteey at the Weist ! The ulnar artery at the wrist may be said to extend from the upper to the lower ' border of the anterior annular ligament. It here lies immediately to the radial side j of the pisiform bone, and to the ulnar side of the hook of the unciform, the two bones ! forming for the vessel a protecting channel, which is further conA^erted into a short ! canal by the expansion of the flexor carpi ulnaris passing from the pisiform to the j hook of the unciform. The ulnar nerve in this situation is immediately to the ulnar side of the artery. ; Relations.—In front, it has, in addition to the expansion above mentioned, the skin and superficial fascia ; below, it rests on the annular ligament; internally are the ulnar nerve and pisiform bone ; externally, the hook of the unciform. The ulnar artery gives off' no named artery in this part of its course. j III. Eelations of the Ulnae Aeteey in the Palm (SUPEEFICIAL PaLMAE AeCH) The ulnar artery, on entering the palm, divides into two branches, the superficial and deep. The superficial branch (fig. 354), the direct continuation of the vessel, anastomoses with the superficial volar, a branch of the radial, forming what is then known as the superficial palmar arch. After descending a short distance towards the cleft between the fourth and fifth fingers, it turns outwards towards the thumb, forming a curve with its convexity towards the fingers and its concavity towards the muscles of the thumb, and anastomoses opposite the cleft between the index and middle fingers, at the junction of the upper with the middle third of the palm, with the superficial volar branch of the radial artery to complete the arch. A line drawn across the palm on a level with the thumb at a right angle to the hand will roughly indicate the situation of the arch. Relations.—In front: in addition to the skin and superficial fascia, the vessel is crossed successively, from within outwards, by the palmaris brevis, the palmar branch of the ulnar nerve, the palmar fascia, and the palmar branch of the median nerve.SUPEBFICIAL PALMAB ARCH 569 Behind, it rests upon, from within outwards, the short muscles of the Httle finger, the digital branches of the ulnar nerve, the flexor tendons, and the digital branches of the median nerve. Variations in the Superficial Palmar Arch The superficial palmar arch is very subject to variations. (A) It may be formed by the superficial branch of the ulnar anastomosing with the radialis indicis, or with the radial Fig. 354.—Anastomoses and Distribution of the Arteries of the Hand. Anterior interosseous Radial artery Anterior radial carpal Superficial volar Posterior radial carpal Radial artery at wrist Ulnar artery Anterior ulnar carpal 'osterior ulnar carpal Dorsalis pollicis 'etacarpal or first orsal interosseous Princeps pollicis Dorsalis indicis Radialis indicis First dorsal branch of- collateral digital Second dorsal branch of- collateral digital Anastomosis of collateral digital arteries about matrix of nailandpulp of finger Posterior communicating or perforating Palmar interosseous Second, third, and fourth palmar digital Second and third dorsal interosseous First palmar digital Anterior communicating or perforating in the palm instead of with the superficial volar branch of the radial. (B) The superficial volar may be larger than usual, and take a greater share than the ulnar in the formation of the arch. (C) The arch may be reinforced bj- a large median artery, or by an enlarged interosseous artery. (D) The arch may be double, both the superficial branch of the uhiar and the superficial volar dividing into two branches which anastomose across the palm. (E) The arteries of the thumb and radial side of the index finger may be given off from the arch. (F) The arch may be incomplete, the outer digital branches coming670 THE AETERIES off from the ulnar, and the inner from the superficial volar, the radial in the palm or an enlarged median artery. (G) The arch \\\&y be absent, the lateral digital arteries being then given off from enlarged interosseous arteries from the deep arch, or from enlarged dorsal interosseous arteries. The branches of the superficial palmar arch are:—(1) The four digital | tin fii t( arteries; (2) the muscular; and (8) the cutaneous.

Th( radial side of the index finger and the thumb are supplied respectively by the radiali; indicis and princeps pollicis, branches of the radial artery. The digital arteries an571 ULNAB—BADIAL i named, from within outwards—first, second, third, and fourth. The first digital artery runs downwards and inwards over the muscles on the inner side of the palm, and thence along the ulnar side of the little finger. It gives branches to the abductor, flexor brevis, and opponens minimi digiti muscles. This branch some- times comes from the deep branch of the ulnar artery. The second, third, and j fourth digital arteries run downwards in the interspace between the little and ring, j the ring and middle, and the middle and index fingers respectively, to within about I a quarter of an inch of the clefts between the fingers, where they divide into two branches (collateral digital) for the supply of the sides of the contiguous fingers. As the digital arteries pass through the palm, they lie between the flexor tendons, on the digital nerves and lumbrical muscles, and beneath the palmar fascia. Just before bifurcating they pass under the superficial transverse ligament, and are j joined by the palmar interosseous branches from the deep palmar arch (fig. 354). At this spot they also receive the anterior perforating branches from the dorsal 1 interosseous vessels. On the sides of the fingers the collateral digital arteries lie between the palmar and dorsal digital nerves. They anastomose by small branches, forming an arch across the front of the bones on the proximal side of each inter- phalangeal joint. They supply the flexor tendons and the integuments, and terminate in a plexiform manner beneath the pulp of the finger and around the matrix of the nail. A dorsal digital branch is given off to the back of the fingers ! about the level of the middle of the first phalanx, and a second but smaller dorsal digital branch about the level of the middle of the second phalanx. (2) The muscular branches from the superficial arch are very small and supply the superficial muscles. (3) The cutaneous branches supply the integuments of the palm. The deep branch of the ulnar artery, also called the communicating artery, sinks deeply into the palm between the abductor and flexor brevis minimi digiti, and joins the radial to form the deep palmar arch. (See The Eadial Aetery, page 576.) THE EADIAL AETERY j I The radial artery—the smaller of the two arteries into which the brachial divides at the bend of the elbow—appears as the direct continuation of the brachial. It runs downwards and outwards along the radial side of the forearm as far as the I styloid process, then, coiling over the external lateral ligament and outer and back part of the wrist, enters the palm of the hand from behind between the first and second metacarpal bones, and ends by anastomosing with the deep branch of the ulnar to form the deep palmar arch. Hence the artery is divisible into three parts : that in the forearm, that at the wrist, and that in the palm of the hand. I. The Radial Artery in the Forearm In its course through the forearm (fig. 351) the radial artery is found in the outermost intermuscular space, and it is only necessary to divide the skin, super- ficial and deep fascia, to expose the vessel, and in addition in the upper third to separate the supinator longus (humero-radialis) from the pronator radii teres. In front, the artery is at first overlapped by the supinator longus, but for the rest of its course it is merely covered by the skin, superficial and deep fasciag, by i some cutaneous veins, and by cutaneous branches of the musculo-cutaneous nerve. Behind, it lies successively from above downwards on the tendon of the biceps, the j supinator brevis, the insertion of the pronator radii teres, the radial origin of the flexor sublimis digitorum, the flexor longus pollicis, the pronator quadratus, and the front surface of the lower end of the radius. It is in this last situation, where the artery572 THE ABTEBIES lies upon the bone and can therefore be easily pressed against it, that the pulse is usually felt. On its outer side it has, throughout the whole of its course, the supinator longus or humero-radialis muscle, the guide to the artery in ligature, and the external vena comes ; in its middle third, the radial nerve as well. In its lower third the radial nerve is to its outer side, but separated from it by the supinator longus and fascia. Fig. 356.—Diagram of the Eelation of the Arteries of the Forearm TO THE Bones.

Variations in the Badial Artery in the Forearm (A) The radial artery may be given off from the brachial higher than usual, or from the axillary artery. (B) It may arise from the brachial lower than the bend of the elbow, but a low division of the brachial is rare. (C) It may run superficial to the fascia of the forearm. (D) It may cross over, instead of under, the extensors of the thumb. (E) It573 BADIAL may terminate in the forearm or be absent, its place in the forearm and hand being then suppHed by the ulnar, the anterior interosseous, or an enlarged median artery. (F) It may be joined by a vas aberrans from the brachial or axillary artery. The branches of the radial artery in the forearm are :—(1) The radial recurrent; (2) the muscular ; (3) the anterior radial carpal; (4) the superficial volar. (1) The radial recurrent usually arises from the outer side of the radial just below its origin from the brachial. It at first runs outwards on the supinator brevis, and then divides into three chief branches (fig. 357). One of these runs transversely Fig. 357.—The Bend of the Elbow.

A second ascends between the braehialis antieus and supinator longus, with the musculo-spiral nerve, and anastomoses with the superior profunda artery. A third descends with the radial nerve under cover of the supinator longus supplying that muscle. The radial recurrent also gives off branches to the elbow joint.574 THE ABTERIES (2) The muscular branches of the radial artery come off irregularly to supply the contiguous muscles on the outer side of the forearm. (3) The anterior radial carpal arises from the inner side of the radial artery about the level of the lower border of the pronator quadratus. It crosses the front of the radius beneath the flexor muscles, and anastomoses with the anterior carpal branch of the ulnar, forming what is sometimes called the anterior carpal arch; or what is, more properly speaking, an arterial plexus or rete—the anterior carpal rete. This plexus is joined above by small twigs from the anterior interosseous artery, and beloAv by recurrent branches from the deep palmar arch. It supplies branches to the lower end of the radius, and to the wrist and carpal joints. (4) The superficial volar leaves the radial artery as the latter vessel is about to turn over the external lateral ligament to the back of the wrist. It courses forwards over the short muscles of the ball of the thumb, and anastomoses with the superficial branch of the ulnar artery to complete the superficial palmar arch. It supplies small branches to the muscles of the ball of the thumb, and at times terminates in these muscles without joining the arch. Occasionally it passes beneath the abductor pollicis. II. The Eadial Artery at the Wrist The radial artery at the wrist winds over the outer side of the carpus, under the extensor tendons of the thumb, from a spot a little below and internal to the styloid process of the radius to the base of the first interosseous space, where it sinks between the two heads of the abductor indicis into the palm, to form, by anastomosing Avith the deep branch of the ulnar artery, the deep palmar arch. A line drawn from half an inch internal to the styloid process to the base of the first interosseous space, which can be distinctly felt on the back of the hand, will roughly indicate the course of the artery. Relations.—The artery is covered successively by the extensor ossis metacarpi pollicis and extensor primi internodii pollicis, by branches of the radial nerve and superficial radial veins, and, just before it sinks between the two heads of the abductor indicis, by the tendon of the extensor secundi internodii pollicis. The branches of the radial nerve to the thumb and index finger cross it. It is at first somewhat deeply placed beneath the first-mentioned extensor muscles of the thumb ; but subsequently it lies quite superficial, and can be felt pulsating in a little triangular depression bounded on either side by the extensor primi and extensor secundi internodii pollicis, and above by the lower end of the radius. The artery lies successively on the external lateral ligament of the wrist, on the scaphoid, the trapezium, the base of the first metacarpal bone, and on the dorsal ligaments uniting these bones. It has usually with it two companion veins, and a few branches of the musculo-cutaneous nerve. The branches of the radial artery at the wrist are :—(1) The posterior radial carpal; (2) the metacarpal, or the first dorsal interosseous; (3) the dorsalis pollicis, or dorsal artery of the thumb ; (4) the dorsalis indicis, or dorsal digital artery of the first finger. (1) The posterior radial carpal arises from the radial as the latter vessel passes under the extensor ossis metacarpi pollicis, and runs inwards beneath the extensor carpi radialis longior and brevior, and the extensor secundi internodii pollicis, across the back of the carpus, to anastomose with the posterior ulnar carpal and with the terminal twigs of the posterior branch of the anterior interosseous artery. This anastomosis is called the posterior carpal arch, or posterior carpal rete. The two following named branches are given off from this arch or rete :—{cl) The second and (h) the third dorsal interosseous arteries to the third and fourth spaces respec- j tively. These vessels run downwards on the dorsal interosseous muscles as far as575 RADIAL AT THE WBIST the flexure of the fingers, and there divide into two branches (dorsal digital), which run along the sides of the contiguous fingers on their dorsal aspect. Near their proximal ends they anastomose with the posterior perforating branches of the deep palmar arch. Distally they are connected by anterior perforating branches Fig. 358.—The Kadial Artery at the Wrist. (From a dissection in the Hunterian Museum.)

The branches which run along the backs of the fingers anastomose with the dorsal branches of the collateral digital arteries derived from the palmar digital vessels (fig. 359). (2) The metacarpal or first dorsal interosseous artery (figs. 358,359) arises fromTHE ABTEBIES 576 the radial artery beneath the extensor secundi internodii pollicis, and, crossing the second metacarpal bone, passes downwards on the second dorsal interosseous muscle between the extensor tendons to the level of the metacarpo-phalangeal joint, where it divides into two small branches, like the other dorsal interosseous arteries, for the supply of the sides of the contiguous fingers on their dorsal aspect. At the base of the second interosseous space it communicates with the posterior perforating branch of the deep arch, which here runs forwards between the heads of the second dorsal interosseous muscle, and at the fore part of the space it anastomoses through the anterior perforating branch with the fourth digital artery. The dorsal digital arteries, the terminations of the metacarpal artery and dorsal interosseous arteries, extend along the sides of the fingers as far as the first inter- phalangeal joint, where they anastomose with the dorsal branches of the collateral digital arteries. (3) The dorsalis pollicis arises from the radial just before it sinks between the two heads of the first dorsal interosseous muscle. It runs downwards on the ulnar side of the extensor secundi internodii pollicis, along the metacarpal bone, and divides into two branches for the supply of the radial and ulnar side of the thumb on its dorsal aspect. These branches sometimes come off separately from the radial artery. (4) The dorsalis indicis arises from the radial just as that artery sinks between the two heads of the first dorsal interosseous muscle, usually below the origin of the dorsalis pollicis, but sometimes as a common trunk with the latter vessel. It runs downwards along the radial side of the metacarpal bone of the index finger, and can be traced along the radial side of that finger as far as the first inter- phalangeal joint, where it anastomoses with the dorsal branch of the radialis indicis.

The Radial Aktery in the Palm (the Deep Palmar Aech) The radial artery enters the palm between the first and second metacarpal bones at the base of the first interosseous space, by passing between the two heads of the first dorsal interosseous muscle. It then runs inwards between the adductor pollicis i and inner head of the flexor brevis pollicis, and continuing its course, in a slight curve j with the convexity forwards, across the base of the metacarpal bones and interos- i seous muscles, it anastomoses with the deep branch of the ulnar, forming the deep , palmar arch. The arch thus formed may be said to extend from the first inter- osseous space to the base of the metacarpal bone of the little finger, and is a finger's ; breadth nearer the wrist than the superficial arch. It is covered by the superficial and deep flexor tendons, by the inner head of the flexor brevis pollicis, and by part of ■ the flexor brevis minimi digiti. It is accompanied by the deep branch of the ulnar nerve, and two small venae comites. Variations in the Deep Palmar Arch (A) The deep palmar arch may be larger than usual, and its interosseous branches * supply the place of one or more of the digital arteries by dividing at the cleft of the fingers into collateral digital branches. (B) It may be reinforced by enlarged posterior perforating j branches from the radial and its branches on the back of the hand, or by a large anterior j interosseous. (C) The radial may join the deep arch by passing through the second instead of the first interosseous space. (D) The princeps pollicis and radialis indicis may come off from the superficial arch or from the superficial volar, or from a separate branch of the radial which passes through the first interosseous space. The branches of the deep palmar arch are :—(1) The princeps polhcis ; (2) the I radialis indicis ; (3) the palmar interosseous (three in number); (4) the recurrent carpal; (5) the posterior perforating. The first two are usually spoken of asDEEP PALMAB ABGH 577 coming off from the radial artery in the pahn; the last three from the deep palmar arch. (1) The princeps poUicis arises from the radial artery as it enters the palm, between the two heads of the abductor indicis. It passes downwards between the adductor pollicis and abductor indicis, parallel to the metacarpal bone, and between the two portions of the flexor brevis pollicis under cover of the flexor longus pollicis.

These vessels anastomose with each other at the end of the thumb, like the other collateral digital arteries. : (2) The radialis indicis comes off from the radial artery a little lower than the former vessel, or as a common trunk with it, and passes forwards between the abductor indicis and adductor pollicis, parallel to the radial side of the second PP578 THE ABTEBIES metacarpal bone. After emerging from beneath the adductor poUicis, it continues its course along the radial side of the index finger, on its palmar aspect, as far as the tip, anastomosing in this course with the collateral digital artery on the opposite side of Fig. 360.—The Arch of the Aorta, the Thoracic Aorta, and the Abdominal Aorta, with the Superior and Inferior Vena Cava and the Innominate and AzYGOs Veins.

It gives off a dorsal branch, which | anastomoses with the dorsalis indicis..THOBAGIG AOBTA 579 (3) The palmar interosseous arteries, three in number, come off from the con- vexity of the deep arch, and, coursing downwards in the centre of the second, third, ! and fourth interosseous spaces on the interosseous muscles, terminate near the clefts of the fingers by anastomosing with the digital arteries from the superficial arch. These vessels supply the interosseous muscles and the bones, and the second, third, and fourth lumbricales. (4) The recurrent branches come off from the concavity of the arch, and consist of two or three small vessels which run upwards ^ towards the wrist, and anastomose above with the anterior branch of the anterior interosseous, and laterally with the anterior radial and ulnar carpal arteries, forming the so-called anterior carpal rete (fig. 359). (5) The posterior, communicating, or perforating, also usually three in number, pass from the arch directly through the second, third, and fourth interosseous spaces between the two heads of the corresponding dorsal interosseous muscle, and join the proximal ends of the metacarpal artery (first dorsal interosseous), and the j second and third dorsal interosseous arteries respectively. THE DESCENDING, OR THOEACIC AORTA The thoracic aorta (fig. 360) extends from the termination of the aortic arch at the lower border of the body of the fifth thoracic vertebra to the body of the twelfth ! thoracic vertebra, where it passes through the aortic opening in the diaphragm, and j is thence continued under the name of the abdominal aorta. It is at first situated a little to the left of the vertebral column, but as it descends approaches the front of the column, at the same time following the backward curve of the spine, and at its passage through the diaphragm is almost in the middle line. It lies in the posterior mediastinum, having the oesophagus at first a little to the right of it, then in front of it, and just above the tenth thoracic vertebra, where this tube pierces the diaphragm, a little to its left side. Relations.—In front it is crossed from above downwards by the root of the left lung, by the oesophagus which separates it from the pericardium and heart, and by the diaphragm. Behind, it lies upon the lower seven thoracic vertebrae, and is crossed obliquely j opposite the seventh or eighth vertebra by the vena azygos minor, and opposite the j fifth or sixth vertebra by the superior intercostal vein or third azygos vein, or by one ' or more of the left intercostal veins. On the right side it has, above, the oesophagus, and lower down the right pleura and lung. The vena azygos major and thoracic duct also lie to the right, but on a somewhat posterior plane. On the left side it has the left lung and pleura above, and the oesophagus below. The vena azygos minor and the third azygos vein are also to the left, but on a posterior plane. Bbanches of the Thoeacic Aorta The branches of the thoracic aorta may be divided into the visceral and the parietal. The visceral are :—(1) The pericardiac; (2) the bronchial; and (3) the oesophageal. The parietal are:—(1) The intercostal,; (2) the subcostal; i (3) the diaphragmatic ; and (4) the arteria aberrans. A. Visceral Brandies I (1) The pericardiac—two or three small branches, irregular in their origin, 1 course, and distribution—pass to the posterior surface of the pericardium to supply that structure, and anastomose with the other pericardiac branches. They give small twigs to the posterior mediastinal glands. pp 22. At level of seventh thoracic vertebra.

They vary considerably in their origin, course, and distribution ; they are usually three in number—one on the right side, and two on the left. {a) The right bronchial generally arises either from the first right aortic inter- costal, or else as a common trunk with the left upper bronchial from the front of the thoracic aorta just below the level of the bifurcation of the trachea. It passes outwards on the back of the right bronchus, and is distributed to the bronchi and lung substance, {h) The left upper bronchial arises from the front of the thoracic j aorta just below the bifurcation of the trachea, or as a common trunk with the right bronchial, (c) The left lower bronchial arises from the front of the thoracic aorta just below the level of the left bronchus. Like the corresponding artery on the right side, the left bronchial arteries run outwards on the left bronchus, and, after dividing and subdividing on the back of the bronchi, supply the bronchi themselves and the lung substance. Small twigs are given off from the bronchial arteries to the bronchial glands and to the oesophagus. (3) The oesophageal arteries, four or sometimes five in number, arise at intervals ' from the front of the thoracic aorta, the first coming off just below the left lower bronchial. They usually increase in size from above downwards, the upper coming off more towards the right side of the aorta, the lower more towards the left side. They pass forwards to the oesophagus, supplying that tube and anastomosing with each other and with the descending oesophageal branches of the inferior thyroid j above, and with the ascending oesophageal branches of the phrenic and gastric arteries below, thus forming a chain of anastomoses along the whole length of the tube. B. Parietal Branches (1) The aortic intercostal arteries, usually ten in number on each side, supply i the lower intercostal spaces, the two upper spaces being supplied by the superior intercostal branch of the subclavian artery. The tenth artery runs along the lower border of the last rib, and would be better called the subcostal artery; it is similar in its distribution to the other intercostals, but is described separately. The aortic intercostals arise in pairs from the back part of the thoracic aorta, and at once turning, the one to the right, the other to the left, wind backwards over the front and sides of the vertebral bodies to reach the intercostal spaces, which they follow, and anastomose in front with the anterior intercostals given off from the internal mammary and musculo-phrenic arteries respectively. In foetal life these arteries run almost transversely backwards, or even with a slight inclination down- wards, to the intercostal spaces ; but after the first year, in consequence of the dispro- portionate growth of the aorta and vertebral column, the upper intercostals have to ascend to reach their respective spaces. For convenience of description the inter- costal arteries may be divided into two portions—the vertebral, which lies upon the bodies of the vertebra ; and the intercostal, which lies in the intercostal spaces. The vertebral portion.—The arteries in their course round the vertebrae differ I on the two sides of the body. On the right side the arteries—and especially the upper, in consequence of the aorta lying a little to the left side of the spine in the upper part of its course—are longer than the left. They wind over the front and j right side of the vertebrae, being crossed by the thoracic duct and vena azygos I major, and covered by the right pleura and lung. The upper are also crossed by the oesophagus. They give off small branches to the bodies of the vertebra and anterior common ligament. On the left side, as the intercostals wind round the side of the bodies of the vertebrae, the lower are crossed by the vena azygos minor, the two upper by the left superior intercostal vein, and the two next by the third [ azygos vein when this is present. They are all covered by the left pleura and lung.582 THE ABTEBIES The intercostal portion.—In their course through the intercostal spaces the arteries are alike on both sides. They at first cross the intercostal spaces obliquely, in consequence of the downward direction of the ribs, towards the angle of the rib above, and thence are continued forward in the subcostal groove, and anastomose with the superior branches of the anterior intercostals from the internal mammary in the upper spaces, and from the musculo-phrenic in the lower spaces. They lie at first on the external intercostal muscles, being covered in front by the pleura and lung, the endothoracic fascia and the infra-costales muscles. Opposite the heads of the ribs they are crossed by the sympathetic nerve. At the angle of the ribs they pass under cover of the internal intercostal muscles, and thence to their termination lie between the two intercostal muscles. Their situation in the mid- space as far as the angle of the rib should be remembered in performmg paracentesis ? thoracis. To avoid the risk of injuring the vessels, the puncture should not be made ' further back than the angle of the ribs. They are accompanied by an intercostal nerve and vein, the vein lying above and the nerve below, except in the upper spaces where the artery, having to ascend to reach the space, at first lies below the nerve which passes transversely outwards. The uppermost aortic intercostal artery anastomoses with the superior intercostal from the subclavian, and at times sup- i plies almost entirely the second intercostal space. The arteries to the tenth and eleventh spaces on reaching the end of their respective ribs pass between the i abdominal muscles, and anastomose with the deep epigastric artery from the external iliac, and with the lumbar arteries from the abdominal aorta. The intercostal arteries give off' the following branches :— ((%) The dorsal branch.^This large branch is given oft' from the intercostals opposite the quadrilateral space bounded by the transverse process of the vertebra above, the neck of the rib below, the body of the vertebra internally, and the superior I costo-transverse ligament externally. Passing backwards towards this space with the dorsal branch of the corresponding intercostal nerve, the dorsal branch divides opposite the intervertebral foramen into a s]3inal and a muscular branch, (i) The spinal branch enters the intervertebral foramen along with the undivided trunk of the intercostal nerve, and subdivides into three branches :—(a) an anterior or preneural, which ramifies on the back of the body of the vertebra and anastomoses \ with the corresponding vessels above and below ; (/3) a posterior, or retroneural, ' which ramifies over the back of the spinal canal and also anastomoses with the like artery above and below ; and (c) a middle or medullary, which, passing inwards in the sheath of dura mater to the spinal cord, anastomoses with the anterior spinal artery in front, and with the posterior spinal artery behind, (ii) The muscular branch passes backwards through the quadrilateral space, and soon subdivides into an external and internal branch. The former passes between the longissimus 1 dorsi and ilio-costalis, and, after supplying these muscles, gives cutaneous offsets to : the integuments. The latter or internal branch pierces the multifidus spinae, and, | emerging betw^een the longissimus dorsi and semispinalis dorsi near the spinous processes, gives cutaneous offsets to the skin. It supplies the muscles in its course. (6) The collateral intercostal branch comes off from the intercostal artery j near the angle of the rib above, and descends to the upper border of the rib below, along which it runs between the intercostal muscles to anastomose with the inferior | division of the anterior intercostal branch of the internal mammary artery. It is j much smaller than the main intercostal artery, and helps to supply the structures in the intercostal space and neighbouring parts. 1 (c) The pleural branches ramify beneath the pleura, forming a plexus by anastomosing with like branches above and below. i {d) The muscular branches supply the intercostals, serratus magnus, pectoralis I major and minor, and anastomose with the long and short thoracic branches of the | axillary artery. jTHOBACIC AOBTA 588 (e) The lateral cutaneous branches run with the lateral cutaneous branches of the intercostal nerves to the skin. (/) The mammary glandular branches are given off from the intercostal arteries in the third, fourth, and fifth intercostal spaces, and supply the mammary gland. They are of large size during lactation, and generally require a ligature in the removal of the breast. (2) The subcostal artery, or the twelfth dorsal as it is sometimes called, follows the same course as the intercostals as far as the head of the twelfth rib. It then passes in company with the twelfth dorsal nerve along the lower border of the twelfth rib, lying in front of the quadratus lumborum muscle, behind the fascia transversalis. Crossing in front of it is the thickened upper bridge-like margin of Fig. 362.—Scheme of Intercostal Artery.

The subcostal artery anastomoses with the lumbar arteries and external circumflex iliac artery. At the outer edge of the quadratus lumborum it passes between the abdominal muscles, and is distributed in a manner similar to that of the lumbar arteries. (3) The diaphragmatic branches are small twigs coming off from the thoracic aorta immediately above the diaphragm. They are distributed to the vertebral portion of the diaphragm on its upper surface. (4) The aberrans artery is a small twig which, arising from the thoracic aorta near the right bronchial artery, passes upwards and to the right behind theTHE ABTEBIES 584 oesophagus and trachea, and is occasionally found to anastomose on the oesophagus with the arteria aberrans of the superior intercostal artery. It is regarded as the remains of the right aortic dorsal stem (fig. 345). THE ABDOMINAL AOETA The abdominal aorta (fig. 363), the continuation of the descending or thoracic aorta, begins at the aortic opening in the diaphragm opposite the lower border of the Fig. 363.—The Abdominal Aorta and its Branches, with the Inferior Vena Cava and its Tributaries.

It is at s first centrally placed between the pillars of the diaphragm, but as it descends in | front of the lumbar vertebra it leaves the middle hne, and, at its bifurcation, hes a little to the left side of the spine. The spot at which the aorta bifurcates is, for all practical purposes, roughly indicated on the surface of the abdomen by a point | about half an inch below and a little to the left of the umbilicus. But the level of its bifurcation may be more accurately determined by a line drawn across the front I585 ABDOMINAL AOBTA of the abdomen from the highest point of one iliac crest to the highest point of the other. The vena cava inferior, which accompanies the abdominal aorta, lies to its right side. Below, the vein is in contact with the artery and on a somewhat posterior plane; but above, it is separated from the aorta by the right crus of the diaphragm, and in consequence of the caval opening in the diaphragm being placed further forward than the opening for the aorta, is on an anterior plane. Relations.—In front (fig. 364), the aorta is successively crossed from above downwards by the right lobe of the liver, the solar plexus, the lesser omentum, the ter- mination of the oesophagus in the stomach, the ascending layer of the transverse meso-colon, the splenic vein or commencement of the vena porta, the pancreas, the left j renal vein, the third portion of the duodenum, the mesentery, the aortic plexus of the sympathetic nerve, the spermatic or ovarian arteries, the inferior mesenteric artery, the median lumbar lymphatic glands and lymphatic vessels, and the small intestines. Of these structures the solar plexus, the aortic plexus, the splenic vein or the I commencement of the vena porta, the pancreas, the left renal vein, the duodenum, the lymphatics, the spermatic or ovarian arteries, and the peritoneal reflexions are in contact with the aorta. Behind, the aorta lies upon the bodies of the lumbar vertebrae and intervening intervertebral cartilages, the anterior common ligament, the origin of the left crus of the diaphragm, and the left lumbar veins. On the right side from above downwards are the right crus of the diaphragm, j the great splanchnic nerve, the Spigelian lobe of the liver, the receptaculum chyli I and beginning of the thoracic duct (the two latter structures are on a posterior plane), the right semilunar ganglion, and the vena cava inferior. On the left side are the left crus of the diaphragm, the left splanchnic nerve, and the left semilunar ganglion. The tail of the pancreas is also in contact with the aorta on the left side, as are, too, the small intestines, but separated from it by peritoneum. Variations in the Abdominal Aorta Variations in the abdominal aorta, except as regards its place of division and some irregularity in the origin and number of its branches, are not common. According to Quain, in ten out of every thirteen subjects examined, the bifincation took place within half an inch above or below the level of the highest part of the crest of the ilium. The commonest situation for its bifurcation with reference to the vertebrae is perhaps opposite the lower border of the body of the fourth lumbar, but it may divide opposite the disc between the fourth and fifth lumbar, or rarely opposite the fifth lumbar. A higher division than at the usual spot is less common. The arterj?-, however, has been found in exceptional instances dividing as high as the origin of the renal arteries, or even as high as the second lumbar vertebra. The following rare variations have been met with :—(A) The aorta passing through the oesophageal opening in the diaphragm. (B) The aorta lying on the right side of the vena cava ; the vein then passes over the upper part of the aorta to gain the caval opening. (C) The aorta with a vena cava on each side, the left vein passing across the upper part of the artery to open into the right vein just below the caval opening. (D) The aorta giving off a pulmonary branch close to the origin of the coeliac axis, the abnormal vessel then passing through the cesophageal opening, and supplying a branch to the lower lobe of each lung. The variations in the branches of the aorta are described under each branch. Beanches of the Abdominal Aorta The branches of the abdominal aorta are given off in the following order from above downwards (fig. 363) (1) Eight and left phrenic; (2) coeliac axis; (3) right and left suprarenal or capsular; (4) right and left first lumbar; (5) superior mesenteric; (6) right and left renal; (7) right and left spermatic ; (8) right and left second lumbar ;THE ABTEBIES 586 (9) inferior mesenteric; (10) right and left third lumbar ; (11) right and left fourth lumbar ; (12) right and left common iliac ; (IB) middle sacral. The above branches may be divided into the parietal, the visceral, and the terminal. The parietal branches are distributed to the abdominal walls. They are the right and left phrenics, and the four right and left lumbars. The visceral branches supply the viscera. Three of these are given off singly from the front of the aorta, namely, the coeliac axis, the superior mesenteric and the inferior mesenteric ; and three are given off in pairs, namely, the two suprarenals, the two renals, and the two spermatics. The terminal branches are the middle sacral and the right and left common iliac arteries. Fig. 364.—Scheme of the Abdominal Aorta.

The Pakietal Branches of the Abdominal Aorta 1. THE PHKENIC AETEEIES The right and left phrenic arteries—sometimes called the inferior phrenic to distinguish them from the diaphragmatic branches of the internal mammary and thoracic aorta—usually arise from the aorta as it passes between the crura of the diaphragm either as a common trunk or as separate vessels. At times they come off as a common trunk from the coeliac axis ; or either the right or left vessel may come from this artery, or from other of the upper branches of the abdominal aorta. The right phrenic passes (fig. 363) over the rigbt crus of the diaphragm behind the vena cava, and then upwards and to the right between the central and right leaflets of the central tendon of the muscle, where it divides into an anterior andPHBENIC AND LUMBAB 587 posterior branch. The former courses forwards and mwards, and anastomoses with the anterior branch of the left phrenic, with the musculo-phrenic branches of the internal mammary, and wdth the superior phrenic arteries; the latter passes out- wards and backwards towards the ribs, and anastomoses with the intercostal arteries. Besides the two terminal branches and branches for the supply of the diaphragm itself, the right phrenic gives off the following:—(1) Right superior suprarenal, ito the right suprarenal capsule; (2) caval, to the vena cava; (3) hepatic, to the liver; and (4) pericardiac, to the pericardium. The left phrenic crosses the left crus of the diaphragm behind the oesophagus, and then runs between the left and central leaflets of the tendon, dividing like the right into an anterior and a posterior branch. The former runs forwards and inwards, and anastomoses with the anterior branch of the right phrenic, the left musculo-phrenic from the internal mammary, and the superior phrenic artery. The latter courses outwards and backwards towards the ribs, and anastomoses with the intercostal arteries. In addition to the terminal branches, and branches to the diaphragm itself, the left phrenic gives off:—(1) (Esophageal branches to the oesophagus, where they anastomose with the other oesophageal branches ; (2) left superior suprarenal, to the left suprarenal body ; (3) splenic, to the spleen ; and (4) pericardiac, which perforate the diaphragm and anastomose with the other pericardiac arteries. The variations in the origin of the phrenic arteries are very numerous. The chief have been alluded to in the general description of the vessels. 2. THE LUMBAR ARTERIES The lumbar arteries (figs. 360, 363), usually eight in number, four on each side, come off in pairs from the posterior aspect of the abdominal aorta, opposite the bodies of the four upper lumbar vertebras. A fifth pair of lumbar arteries, gener- ally of small size, are frequently given off from the middle sacral opposite the fifth lumbar vertebra. The lumbar arteries, Avhich are rather longer on the right than on the left side, in consequence of the aorta lying a little to the left of the median line, wind more or less transversely outwards round the bodies of the vertebrge to ! the interval between the transverse processes, where they give off a dorsal branch, and then, coursing forwards between the abdominal muscles, terminate by anasto- mosing with the other arteries of the abdominal wall. As they wind round the I bodies of the vertebrae they pass beneath the chain of the sympathetic nerve, and the two upper beneath the right crus of the diaphragm on the right side, and the left crus on the left side. The right arteries also pass beneath the vena cava j inferior, and the two upper on that side beneath the receptaculum chyli. The I arteries on both sides then dip beneath the tendinous arch thrown across the sides of the bodies of the vertebras by the psoas, and continue beneath this muscle until they arrive at the interval between the transverse processes of the vertebra and the ! inner edge of the quadratus lumborum. Whilst under cover of the psoas they are accompanied by two slender filaments of the sympathetic nerve and by the lumbar veins. A little anterior to the transverse processes they are crossed by branches of the lumbar plexus, and here usually cross in front of the ascending lumbar vein. They now pass behind the quadratus lumborum, with the exception usually of the first, and sometimes of the last, w^hich may pass in front of the muscle. At the outer edge of the quadratus they run between the transversalis and the internal oblique, and then, perforating the internal oblique, between the internal and external oblique. Finally, much diminished in size, they enter the rectus, and give off one or more anterior cutaneous branches, which accompany the last dorsal and the588 THE ABTERIES ilio-hypogastric nerves to the skin. They anastomose with the lower intercostals, ilio-lumbar, deep circumflex ihac, and deep epigastric arteries. The lumbar arteries give off the following branches :— (a) Vertebral branches which supply the bodies of the vertebrae and their connecting ligaments. {h) Muscular branches to the psoas, quadratus lumborum, and oblique muscles of the abdomen. (c) The dorsal branch. This is of large size, and passes backwards in company with the dorsal nerve between the transverse processes above and below, the inter- transversalis internally, and the quadratus lumborum externally, to the muscles of the back. On reaching the interval between the longissimus dorsi and multifldus spinae, it divides into an external and internal branch. The former ends in the multifidus, the latter and larger supplies the erector spinae, and gives branches which accompany the termination of the dorsal nerves to the skin. Just before the artery passes between the transverse processes it gives off a spinal branch, which accom- panies the lumbar nerve through the intervertebral foramen into the spinal canal. Here the spinal branch divides into three twigs, one of which passes through the sheath of the dura mater to the termination of the spinal cord and cauda equina; the other two are distributed to the walls of the spinal canal after the way described in the case of the intercostals. {(1) Renal branches of small size pass forwards in front of the quadratus lumborum to the capsule of the kidney. They anastomose with the renal artery. A communication is thus established betw^een the renal arteries and the arteries supptying the lumbar region. The fifth pair of lumbar arteries, when present, usually come off from the middle sacral artery. Each courses outwards, beneath the common iliac artery and vein ; and, after giving off a dorsal branch, ramifies over the lateral mass of the sacrum, and ends in the iliacus muscle by anastomosing with the circumflex iliac artery. The dorsal branch passes to the back between the last lumbar vertebra and the sacrum and ramifies in the gluteus maximus, anastomosing with the lumbar arteries above, and with the gluteal artery below. The variations in the lumbar arteries are not of great importance. (A) One or more pairs may arise as a common stem from the back of the aorta. (B) The first lumbar may be joined at its origin with the subcostal artery; or the third and fourth lumbar, or less often the second and third lumbar, may arise from the aorta as a common stem. (C) The fifth pair may sometimes be absent. (D) The first lumbar may give off the phrenic or the suprarenal. (E) One of the lumbar arteries may give off' the spermatic. (F) The fourth lumbar on either side may give off the middle sacral, or both arteries may arise as a common stem with the middle sacral. B. The Visceeal Branches of the Abdominal Aoeta THE CCELIAC AETEEY The coeliac artery—or coeliac axis as it is commonly called, because it breaks up simultaneously into three branches w^hich radiate from it like the spokes of a wheel from the axle—is a short thick trunk given off" from the front of the aorta between the crura of the diaphragm a little below the aortic opening. It passes horizontally forwards above the upper margin of the pancreas for about half an inch, and then breaks up into its three branches for the supply of the stomach, duodenum, spleen, pancreas, liver, and gall-bladder (fig. 805). Relations.—In front is the lesser omentum ; behind, the aorta ; above, the right lobe of the liver ; below, the pancreas ; to the right, the right semilunar gangfionC CELIAC 589 and lobulus Spigelii of the liver; to the left, the left semilunar ganglion and the cardiac end of the stomach. It is closely snrromided by the dense solar plexus of sympathetic nerves. Variations.—(A) The coeliac axis may be absent; the branches usually arising from it then coming otf separately h^om the aorta, (B) It may be shorter or longer than usual. Under the latter circumstance the branches are commonly given off separately from the trunk of the vessel instead of radiating from one spot. (C) It may give off two branches only : these are usually the splenic and hepatic, more rarely the gastric and the splenic. (D) It may give off more than three branches, the additional branch being one of the phrenics; a trunk common to the two phrenics; a gastro-duodenal; a second gastric or splenic artery, or the superior mesenteric; the median colic or the pancreatica magna. (E) One or other of the branches normal to the coeliac axis may be absent, or replaced by Fig. 365.—The Cceliac Artery and its Branches.

Branches of the ccBliac artery.—The coeliac axis gives off the gastric, hepatic, and splenic arteries. 1. The Gasteic Arteey The gastric or coronary artery (fig. 365), the smallest of the three branches into which the coeliac axis divides, courses at first upwards and to the left towards the cardiac end of the stomach, where it turns sharply round, and then, coasting along the lesser curvature of the stomach, descends from left to right towards the pylorus. It anastomoses with the superior pyloric branch of the hepatic artery, which has proceeded from the opposite direction, the two branches thus forming a continuous arterial arch corresponding to the lesser curvature of the stomach. The artery at first lies behind the posterior layer of the lesser omental sac of peritoneum (fig. 364), but on reachmg the cardiac end of the stomach it passes through the so-called590 THE ABTEBIES pancreatico-gastric fold of peritoneum into the lesser omentum, between which it then runs to its terminal anastomosis with the pyloric. It is surrounded by the coronary x^lexus of sympathetic nerves. The branches of the gastric artery are :—(1) The oesophageal; (2) the cardiac ; (3) the gastric ; and (4) the hepatic. (1) The oesophageal branches, given off where the artery makes its bend on to the stomach, ascend on the oesophagus, and, passing through the oesophageal opening of the diaphragm, anastomose with the thoracic oesophageal branches and the branches from the left phrenic. (2) The cardiac branches, two or more in number, are given off for the supply of the cardiac end of the stomach, around which they form an anastomotic circle. (3) The gastric branches come off from the artery as it lies between the layers of the lesser omentum, and are distributed to the front and back of the stomach (the lesser anterior and posterior gastric branches), over which they ramify, anastomosing with branches ascending from the right and left gastro-epiploic on the greater curvature. One of these branches of larger size ramifies over the front of the great cid-de-sac, the greater anterior gastric (Macalister), and anastomoses with the vasa brevia and left gastro-epiploic from the splenic. (4) The hepatic branch is a constant small twig passing to the left lobe of the liver, where it anastomoses with the left hepatic artery. Chief variations.—(A) The gastric may arise directly from the aorta, and may then give off one of the phrenics, or both, or a trunk common to the two. (B) There may be two gastric arteries instead of one. (C) The gastric may give off the left branch of the hepatic artery. This appears to be due to the enlargement of the constantly present small hepatic branch, and the obliteration of part of the normal left branch of the hepatic artery. 2. The Hepatic Aeteky The hepatic artery, the largest branch of the coeliac axis in the foetus, but inter- mediate in the adult between the gastric and the splenic, comes off on the right side of the coeliac axis, and, winding upwards and to the right to the transverse or portal fissure of the liver, there breaks up into two chief branches for the supply of the right and left lobe of that organ. It at first courses forwards and to the right j along the upper border of the head of the pancreas, behind the posterior layer of the lesser omental sac of peritoneum, to the upper margin of the duodenum, where, at the base of the so-called right pancreatico-gastric fold, it passes between the two layers of the lesser omentum, and thus ascends along with the hepatic duct which lies to its right, and with the portal vein which lies behind it, to the transverse or portal fissure of the liver. As it lies with the hepatic duct and portal vein between the layers of the lesser omentum, it is in front of the so-called foramen of Winslow. The branches of the hepatic artery are:—(1) The pancreatic; (2) the supe- rior pyloric; (3) the gastro-duodenal; (4) the right terminal; and (5) the left terminal. (1) The pancreatic, or lesser pancreatic branches as they are often called,] come off from the hepatic as it runs along the upper margin of the pancreas, and supply that organ. (2) The superior pyloric comes off from the hepatic just as the latter vessel enters the lesser omentum, and, descending between the two layers of that fold of peritoneum to the pylorus, there turns leftwards, and, ascending from right to left, j anastomoses along the lesser curvature of the stomach, as already mentioned, with the gastric artery, which descends from the opposite direction. i (3) The gastro-duodenal arises from the hepatic a little beyond the pyloric. It descends behind the ascending portion of the duodenum to the lower bordei of the pylorus, where it divides into the right gastro-epiploic and the superioiHEP A TIC—SPLENIC 591 pancreatico-duodenal. It varies from half an inch to an inch in length. In addition to the above branches, it may give off the inferior pyloric artery. [a) The ri^ht gastro-epiploic, entering the anterior fold of the great omentum, coasts from right to left along the greater curvature of the stomach, and anasto- moses with the left gastro-epiploio branch of the splenic, which descends from left to right also along the greater curvature to meet it. From this anastomotic arch are given off:—(i) Ascending^ or gastric branches, which supply the anterior and 'posterior surfaces of the stomach, and anastomose with the descending gastric branches of the arteries along the lesser curvature, (ii) Epiploic or omental branches—long slender vessels, which descend between the two anterior layers of the great omentum, and then, looping upwards, anastomose with similar slender Ibranches given off from the middle and left colic, and passing down in like manner between the two posterior layers of the great omentum. {h) The superior pancreatico-duodenal—the smaller division of the gastro- iduodenal—arises from that vessel as it passes behind the first portion of the duodenum, and courses downwards behind the peritoneum, in the anterior groove ^between the second portion of the duodenum and the pancreas, to anastomose with Ithe-inferior pancreatico-duodenal, a branch of the superior mesenteric, which runs jupwards between the contiguous borders of the pancreas and duodenum. Both [fche inferior and superior pancreatico-duodenal give off branches to the duodenum |md the pancreas. (c) The inferior pyloric arises either from the gastro-duodenal or from the right gastro-epiploic ; it supplies the pyloric end of the stomach, and anastomoses 'with the other arteries in that situation. (4) The right terminal branch of the hepatic artery is given off at the portal fissure of the liver, and runs to the right towards the end of that fissure, either jbehind the hepatic and cystic ducts, or between these structures. At the right end of the portal fissure it divides into two or more branches, which again subdivide as they enter the liver substance for the supply of the right lobe. As it crosses the 'cystic duct it gives off the cystic artery. («) The cystic artery courses forwards and downwards through the angle formed by the union of the hepatic and cystic ducts, and just before it reaches the I gall-bladder divides into a superficial and deep branch. The former breaks up [into a number of small vessels, which ramify over the free surface of the gall- Ibladder beneath the peritoneal covering, and furnish branches to the muscular and mucous coats. The deep branch ramifies between the gall-bladder and the liver-substance, supplying each, and anastomosing with the superficial branch. (5) The left terminal branch, the smaller division of the hepatic artery, runs iinwards towards the left end of the portal fissure, and, after giving off a distinct branch to the Spigelian lobe, enters the left lobe of the liver. Chief variations.—(A) The hepatic artery may arise directly from the aorta, or from the gastric, the superior mesenteric, or the right renal artery. (B) Together with a normal artery there may be an accessory hepatic from one or other of the above named or neigh- ; bouring branches. (C) The hepatic artery may be altogether wanting, and its place supplied by one or more accessory arteries derived from one or other of the above-named sources. This variation is explained by Hyrtl on the supposition that there has been obliteration of the normal hepatic, with enlargement of one or more of the minute branches which normally proceed from the aorta and the above-named branches to the capsule of the liver. 3. The Splenic Abtery The splenic artery—the largest branch of the cceliac axis—arises from the left side of the termination of that vessel below the gastric, and passes along the I upper border of the pancreas in a tortuous manner to the spleen. It at first • lies behind the ascending layer of the transverse meso-colon, but on nearing theTHE ABTEBIES 592 spleen enters the phreno-splenic ligament, and there breaks up into numerous branches, which enter the hilum and supply the organ. In this course it crosses in front of the left crus of the diaphragm and the upper end of the left kidney. The branches of the splenic artery are :—(1) The smaller pancreatic ; (2) the larger pancreatic; (3) the left gastro-epiploica; (4) the vasa brevia; and (5) the terminal. (1) The smaller pancreatic branches come off from the splenic at varying intervals, as that vessel courses along the upper margin of the pancreas. They enter and supply the organ. (2) The larger pancreatic branch usually arises from the splenic about the junction of its middle with its left third. Entering the pancreas obliquely, it runs from left to right, commonly above, and a little behind, the pancreatic duct, which it supplies together with the substance of the organ. (3) The left gastro-epiploic arises from the splenic behind the great cul-de- sac of the stomach, and, passing between the anterior layers of the great omentum, descends along the greater curvature of the stomach from left to right, and anasto- moses with the right gastro-epiploic. Like that vessel, it gives off ascending or gastric branches to the anterior and posterior surfaces of the stomach respectively, and long slender descending epiploic or omental branches to the great omentum which anastomose with like branches from the right and left colic arteries. (4) The vasa brevia come oft' from the splenic just before it divides into its terminal branches, oftentimes from some of these terminal branches themselves. Passing from between the folds of the phreno-splenic ligament into those of the gastro-splenic, they thus reach the greater cul-de-sac of the stomach, where, ramifying over both its anterior and posterior surfaces, they anastomose with the gastric and left gastro-epiploica arteries. (5) The terminal branches, five to eight or more in number, are given off from the splenic as it lies in the phreno-splenic ligament, and, entering the spleen at the hilum, are distributed in the way mentioned in the description of that organ. The variations of the splenic artery are neither numerous nor important. (A) It may divide into two branches which reunite, the splenic vein running through the loop thus formed. (B) It may sometimes give off branches normally derived from other vessels, such as the gastric, the middle colic, and the left hepatic. (C) The variations in its origin are mentioned under Variations of the Cceliac Axis (page 589). THE SUPEKIOR MESENTERIC ARTERY The superior mesenteric artery is given off from the front of the aorta a little below the coeliac axis, which it nearly equals in size ; sometimes as a common trunk with the axis. Lying at first behind the pancreas and splenic vein, it soon passes forwards between the lower border of that gland and the upper border of the third portion of the duodenum, and, crossing in front of the duodenum, enters the mesentery, in which it runs from left to right, in the form of a curve with its con- vexity to the left, to the caecum, where it anastomoses with its ileo-colic branch. Its vein lies to its right side. It is surrounded by the mesenteric plexus of nerves. The accessory portion of the head of the pancreas dips in behind the vessel. From the concave side of the artery branches are given off to the duodenum and the colon, viz.:— (1) The inferior pancreatico-duodenal; (2) the middle colic ; (3) the right coHc ; and (4) the ileo-colic. From the convex side branches are given off to the small intestines, viz. :— (5) The vasa intestini tenuis. It will thus be seen that the superior mesenteric artery supplies, with the excep-SUPEBIOB MESENTEBIG 593 tion of the upper third of the duodenum, the whole of the small mtestine and half the large. (1) The inferior pancreatico-duodenal, arising from the superior mesenteric as that vessel emerges from the contiguous margins of the pancreas and transverse duodenum, and, crossing behind the superior mesenteric vein, courses upwards and to the right between, the head of the pancreas and the duodenum, beneath the ascending layer of the transverse meso-colon, to anastomose with the superior pancreatico-duodenal, which is given off from the gastro-duodenal, and descends in a like situation beneath the ascending layer of the transverse meso-colon. Fig. 366.—The Superior Mesenteric Artery and Vein. fThe colon is turned up, and the small intestines are drawn over to the left side;) (2) The middle colic, arising from the concavity of the superior mesenteric a little below the pancreas, enters the transverse meso-colon, and divides into two branches—one of which passes to the left and anastomoses with the ascending branch of the left colic; the other, winding downwards and to the right, anastomoses with the ascending branch of the right colic. (3) The right colic—sometimes given off as a common trunk either with the former branch or with the ileo-colic—passes to the right behind the peritoneum to the back of the ascending colon, where it divides into an ascending branch, which anastomoses with the descending branch of the middle colic, and a descending branch which anastomoses with the ascending or colic branch of the ileo-colic. QQTHE ABTEBIES 594 (4) The ileo-colic descends behind the peritoneum towards the caecum, where it divides into a colic branch which tracks upwards beneath the peritoneum to anastomose with the descending branch of the right cohc ; and into an ileac branch which passes between the layers of the mesentery and anastomoses with the termination of the superior mesenteric artery. From the anastomotic loops formed between the termination of the superior mesenteric, the ileo-colic, the right colic, and the middle colic arteries, secondary loops are derived whence branches pass to the termination of the ileum, the caecum, the ' vermiform appendix, the ascending colon, and half the transverse colon. These branches on reaching the intestine divide into two, one of which passes in front, and the other behind the intestine, and, after encircling it, anastomose with each other and with the neighbouring circlets above and below. (5) The intestinal branches, or vasa intestini tenuis, arise from the convex side of the superior mesenteric, and, varying from twelve to sixteen in number, radiate in the mesentery, where each divides into two branches, which inosculate with similar branches given off from the branch above and below. From the primary loops thus formed, secondary loops are derived in like manner, and from these tertiary, and at times quaternary, or even quinary loops. From the ultimate loops terminal branches pass on to the intestine through the triangular interval left at the spot where the mesentery is reflected on to the muscular coat of the gut. On reaching the wall of the gut these terminal vessels bifurcate, the two branches encircling the intestine, and thus forming with those above and below a series of vascular rings surrounding the small intestine throughout its whole length. These ; branches of the superior mesenteric in their course to the intestine also supply the j mesentery and the mesenteric glands. The variations in the superior mesenteric artery are numerous. (A) It may be double. (B) It may give off accessory branches to the liver, stomach, pancreas, spleen, and gall-bladder. (C) It may give off branches normally derived from other sources, namely, the hepatic or its right or left branch, the cystic, the gastro-duodenal or its right gastro-epiploic branch, the gastric or the pancreatica magna. (D) It may give off the left colic and superior haemorrhoidal, thus taking the place in whole or in part of the inferior mesenteric. (E) Its colic and intestinal branches may vary considerably in their origin and course, and in the number of primary and secondary loops that they form. (F) A rare abnormality described by Hyrtl is the persistence of an omphalo-mesenteric artery running to the neighbourhood of the umbilicus and giving off a branch to the urachus, or a branch to the liver through j the falciform ligament, or a branch to the rectus anastomosing with the epigastric. | ,1 THE EENAL ARTERIES | The renal arteries come off one on each side of the abdominal aorta, a little below the superior mesenteric and first lumbar arteries, on a level with the first lumbar vertebra. They pass transversely outwards across the crura of the diaphragm to the kidneys, the right being on a slightly lower plane and somewhat longer than the left, and passing behind the inferior vena cava. In front of each is the corresponding renal vein. Behind each at the hilum of the kidney is the commencement of the ureter. Before entering the kidney they break up into three or four terminal branches. The distribution of the arteries in the kidney is i described under the anatomy of that organ. Each renal artery gives off the following branches :— {a) The inferior suprarenal, which ascends to the suprarenal body. [h) The capsular or perirenal branches to the capsule of the kidney and peri- renal fat. (c) The uretal branch to the upper end of the ureter. j Variations in the renal arteries are common. (A) The right and left renal may arise from the aorta by a common stem. (B) They may arise from the aorta lower than usual;595 BENAL -S UPBABENAL—SPEBMA TIC ! the kidneys then being also below their usual situation. (C) There may be several renal arteries on each side, or the renal artery may divide close to its origin into several branches. I (D) The renal artery on one or both sides may arise from the bifurcation of the aorta, from I the common iliac, the internal iliac, the inferior mesenteric, or the middle sacral artery. (E) The right artery may cross in front of, instead of behind, the vena cava. (F) The branches of the renal artery may perforate the substance of the kidney instead of entering at the hilum. (G) The renal artery may give origin to branches normally derived from other vessels, as the phrenic, the hepatic or its right branch from the right renal, the middle suprarenal, some of the colic arteries, the spermatic, one or more of the lumbar arteries, or the greater pancreatic artery. (H) Accessory renal arteries, varying in size and generally ' derived from the aorta, are common. They may enter the kidney at almost any part of the organ. THE SUPEARENAL ARTERIES The suprarenal arteries are derived from three sources, and are named as follows:—(1) Superior suprarenal; (2) middle suprarenal; and (3) inferior supra- ! renal. (1) The superior suprarenals, one on each side, are usually derived from the I phrenics, and descend to the suprarenal bodies. ! (2) The middle suprarenals, or suprarenals proper, come off one on each side ! from the aorta, just above the first lumbar artery, and pass transversely outwards to the suprarenal bodies, across the crura of the diaphragm a little above the renal , arteries. In the foetus they equal the renals in size. In the adult they are much i smaller. (3) The inferior suprarenals are branches of the renals. They ascend, one on each side, to the suprarenal bodies, i The suprarenal veins, usually one on each side, terminate as a rule on the left I side in the left renal; on the right side, in the inferior vena cava. The distribution of the suprarenal vessels within the suprarenal capsules is described in the anatomy of those organs. THE SPERMATIC ARTERIES ' The spermatic arteries come off from the front of the abdominal aorta. They I diverge from each other as they descend over the aorta and psoas muscle to the deep or internal abdominal ring, where they are joined by the vas deferens, and, passing with it through the inguinal canal and out of the external or superficial I abdominal ring, run downwards into the scrotum in a tortuous course to the testicle. I They terminate in branches to the epididymis and body of that organ. Within : the abdomen they lie beneath the peritoneum, and cross in their descent over the [ ureter and distal end of the external iliac artery; the right being superficial to I the vena cava, and behind the termination of the ileum; and the left beneath ! the sigmoid flexure of the colon. In the inguinal canal and in the scrotum the \ spermatic veins lie in front of the artery, and the vas deferens lies behind it. In the foetus these vessels pass transversely outwards to the testicle, which in I early foetal life lies in the loin in front of the kidney ; but as the testicles descend to the scrotum, the vessels become elongated, and are drawn with the testicle into the scrotum. I The spermatic arteries give off the following branches :—(1) Uretal; (2) cre- I masteric; (3) epididymal; and (4) testicular. [ (1) The uretal are small branches given off to the ureter as the spermatic artery I crosses it. They anastomose with the other uretal branches derived from the I renal, common iliac, and vesical arteries. j (2) The cremasteric are small branches given off to the cremaster muscle ; they I anastomose with the cremasteric branch of the deep epigastric. QQ2596 THE ABTEBIES (3) The epididymal are distributed to the epididymis, and anastomose with the artery of the vas. (4) The testicular are the terminal branches of the spermatic ; they perforate i the tunica albuginea posteriorly, and are distributed to the body of the organ in the way mentioned in the section on the Testicle. Chief variations in the spermatic arteries.—(A) One or both may be wanting, the testicle being then supplied by branches from the vesical or prostatic arteries passing under the arch of the pubis. (B) One or both may arise from the renal, more rarely from the supra- renal. (C) One may come off higher than the other. (D) They may come off from a common stem. (E) One or both may be double in the whole or part of their course. (F) The right spermatic may run behind instead of in front of the interior vena cava. THE OVAEIAN ARTERIES i The ovarian arteries are the homologues of the spermatic arteries in the male, and correspond in their relations in the upper part of their course. They diverge somewhat less however, and on reaching the level of the common iliac artery turn inwards over that vessel and descend tortuously into the pelvis between the folds of the broad ligament to the ovaries. In the broad ligament the : ovarian artery lies below the Fallopian tube, and on reaching the ovary turns backwards and supplies that organ (fig. 370). They give off the following branches :—(1) Uretal; (2) Fallopian ; (3) uterine ; and (4) ligamentous. (1) The uretal is distributed, as in the male, to the ureter. (2) The Fallopian supplies the isthmus and ampulla of the Fallopian tube and its fimbriated extremity. i (3) The uterine runs along the Fallopian tube to the superior cornu of the uterus, which it supplies, together with the upper part of the fundus uteri, and anastomoses with the uterine arteries from the internal iliac. (4) The ligamentous is distributed to the round ligament, passing with that i structure through the inguinal canal, and anastomosing with the cremasteric and superficial external pudic arteries. Like the spermatic, the ovarian arteries in the foetus come off at right angles to the aorta, and pass transversely outwards to the ovaries, which are formed, as i are the testicles, in the right and left loin in front of the kidneys. They elongate I as the ovaries descend into the pelvis. During pregnancy these arteries undergo great enlargement. THE INFERIOR MESENTERIC ARTERY The inferior mesenteric artery, smaller than the superior, arises from the front of the abdominal aorta about an inch and a half above the bifurcation of that , vessel. It runs obliquely downwards and to the left, across the lower part of the \ abdominal aorta and then over the left psoas muscle and common iliac artery, descends into the pelvis between the layers of the meso-rectum, and terminates on the rectum in the superior hemorrhoidal or superior rectal artery. It at first lies behind the peritoneum, or in the left lumbar meso-colon when that structure is present. It supplies the lower half of the large intestine. Its vein lies at first j close to the left side, but soon passes upwards on the psoas, away from the artery, to end in the splenic vein (fig. 367). The branches of the inferior mesenteric are:—(1) The left colic; (2) the sig- ' moid ; and (3) the superior hsemorrhoidal. (1) The left colic runs transversely outwards and to the left, beneath the i peritoneum, and divides into two branches, one of which, entering the transverse597 INFEBIOB MESENTEBIG meso-colon, ascends upwards and to the right, to anastomose with the middle cohc. The other descends, and, entering the sigmoid meso-colon, anastomoses with the ascending branch of the sigmoid artery. The distribution of this artery and the next to the colon is similar to that of the colic branches of the superior mesenteric, and does not require a separate description. (See Superior Mesenteric Artery, pages 593, 594 ) (2) The sigmoid artery runs downwards and to the left over the psoas muscle, and, entering the sigmoid meso-colon, divides into two branches ; the upper anastomosing with the left colic, the lower with the superior hagmorrhoidal. (3) The superior hsemorrhoidal is the continued trunk of the inferior mesenteric. It descends into the pelvis, behind the rectum, between the layers of the meso- FiG. 367.—The Infeeior Mesenteric Artery and Vein. (The colon is turned up, and the small intestines are drawn to the right side.) Inferior pancrea- lico-duodenal artery Superior mesenteric artery Right colic artery Abdominal aorta Vena cava inferior Right common iliac artery Middle sacral artery and vein Left colic artery Inferior mesenteric vein Inferior mesen- teric artery Left colic artery Inferior mesen- teric artery Left common iliac vein Sigmoid artery Superior ha;morrhoidal artery rectum. On reaching the wall of the bowel it bifurcates, one branch proceeding on either side of the gut, ta within four or five inches of the anus. Here each again divides, and the branches, piercing the muscular coat, descend between that coat and the mucous membrane, forming with each other, and with the middle haemorrhoidal arteries—derived from the internal iliac—a series of small vessels, running longitudinally to the rectum, and parallel to each other as far as the level of the internal sphincter, where, by their anastomosis, they form a series of loops around the lower part of the rectum. The chief variations in the inferior mesenteric are:—(A) Its place may be supplied by the superior mesenteric. (B) It may give branches to the liver or kidney. (C) It may give otf the middle colic. (D) It may give off a stem to both umbilical arteries. (E) The anastomosis between the middle and left colic arteries may be wanting—the normal condition in the ruminants and the porcupines.598 THE ABTEBIES C. The Terminal Branches of the Abdominal Aorta THE MIDDLE SACRAL ARTERY The middle sacral artery is, anatomically, the continuation of the aorta, and is generally but not universally held to be the homologue of the sacral and coccygeal aorta of some animals. The so-called coccygeal glomerulus, or Luschka's gland, in which it terminates, is believed to contain the rudiments of the caudal aorta, or artery of the tail. The artery is mesially placed, and extends from the bifurcation of the aorta to the tip of the coccyx. As it passes downwards into the pelvis, it runs behind the left common iliac vein, the hypogastric plexus of the sympathetic nerve, and the layer of peritoneum that descends from the mesentery into the pelvis to become the meso-rectum. It lies successively upon the intervertebral disc between the fourth and fifth lumbar vertebrae, the fifth lumbar vertebra, the intervertebral disc between that vertebra and the sacrum, and lower down upon the middle of the anterior surface of the sacrum and coccyx. Branches.—The middle sacral gives off:— (1) The fifth pair of lumbar arteries (sometimes). These are described with the lumbar arteries. (2) Lateral sacral branches, usually four in number. These are serially homo- logous with the intercostal and lumbar arteries given off by the aorta. They run more or less transversely outwards, and anastomose with the lateral sacral branches of the internal iliac artery. They give off small spinal branches, which pass through the sacral foramina, and supply the sacral canal and back of the sacrum. (3) Rectal or hgemorrhoidal branches pass forwards in the layers of the meso- rectum, to the rectum which they help to supply, and anastomose with the other hgemorrhoidal or rectal arteries. On the lower part of the middle sacral artery—the coccygeal part—there are often found small pouches or varicosities, which are believed by some to represent the rudiments of lateral coccygeal arteries, homologous to the intercostal, lumbar, and sacral arteries, given off from the aorta in these regions. The variations of this vessel are unimportant. (A) The most frequent perhaps is for it to come off from the back of the aorta a little above the bifurcation; or (B) from one or other of the common iliacs; or (C) as a common trunk with what are usually its branches, the fifth pair of lumbar arteries. (D) It sometimes gives off' an accessory renal artery—a fact of interest, in that the kidneys occupy a lower position in the abdomen in some animals than in man. THE COMMON ILIAC ARTERIES The common iliac arteries must be regarded as the terminal branches of the abdominal aorta, unless the middle sacral and the artery of the tail in the lower animals are regarded as the continuation of the abdominal aorta. The common iliacs arise opposite the left side of the lower border of the body of the fourth lumbar vertebra, at the bifurcation of the abdominal aorta, and, diverging from each other in the male at about an angle of 60°, and in the female at an angle of 68°, i terminate opposite the upper margin of the sacro-iliac synchondrosis by bifurcating | into the external iliac, which is continued along the brim of the pelvis to the | lower limb, and into the internal iliac, which passes over the brim of the pelvis i and descends into that cavity. Both arteries lie on the fifth lumbar vertebra, are covered by the peritoneum, and are crossed by the ureter, and in the female, , in addition, by the ovarian arteries.COMMON ILIAC 599 The relations of the arteries differ sHghtly on the two sides, and may be considered separately. The Right Common Iliac Aeteby The right common iliac measures about two inches in length (5 cm.), and is rather longer than the left, in consequence of the aorta bifurcating a little to the left of the median line. Relations.—In front it is covered by the peritoneum, and is crossed by the right ureter a little before its bifurcation, by the ovarian artery in the female, by the ter- mination of the ileum, by the terminal branches of the superior mesenteric artery, and by branches of the sympathetic nerve descending to bhe hypogastric plexus. Behind, it lies on the right common iliac vein, the end of the left common iliac vein, and the commencement of the inferior vena cava, which separate it from the fourth and fifth lumbar vertebrae and their intervening discs, the psoas muscle, and the sympathetic nerve ; whilst still deeper in the groove between the fifth lumbar vertebra and the psoas are the lumbo-sacral cord, the obturator nerve, and the ilio- lumbar artery. To the right side are the beginning of the inferior vena cava, the end of the right common iliac vein, and 'the psoas muscle. To the left side are the right common iliac vein, the termination of the left common iliac vein, and the hypogastric plexus. It will be thus seen that the right common iliac artery crosses both common iliac veins, and that its own vein, the right, is at first a little to the left side, but, as it ascends, passes beneath it, and gets a little to the right side. Since the bifurcation of the vena cava is a little below and to the right side of the bifurcation of the aorta, it follows that the right common iliac artery lies on the commence- ment of the vena cava. The Left Common Iliac Aetery The left common iliac artery, one inch and three-quarters in length (4 cm.), is a little shorter and thicker than the right. Relations.—In front it is covered by the peritoneum, which separates it from the intestines, and is crossed by the ureter, the ovarian artery in the female, branches of the sympathetic nerve descending to the hypogastric plexus, the termination of the inferior mesenteric artery, the sigmoid flexure, and the sigmoid meso-colon. Behind are the lower border of the body of the fourth lumbar vertebra, the disc between the fourth and fifth lumbar vertebrae, the body of the fifth lumbar vertebra, and the disc between it and the sacrum, and the psoas muscle, from which it is separated by the left common iliac vein. Crossing deeply behind the artery between the fifth lumbar vertebra and the psoas, is the obturator nerve, the lumbo-sacral cord, and the ilio-lumbar artery. To the left side is the psoas muscle. To the right side are the left common iliac vein, the hypogastric plexus, and the middle sacral artery. Variations in the Common Iliac Arteries (A) The common iliac arteries may be longer or shorter than here described. They have been found as short as half an inch, or as long as four and a half inches, but the usual limit is something between one and a half to three inches. This variation in the length of the vessels may depend upon the aorta bifurcating above or below the usual spot, or upon the common iliac arteries dividing higher or lower than usual. A low bifurcation of the aorta is somewhat more common than a high bifurcation, as is also the case with the common iliacs. (B) The common iliacs may be absent, the external and internal iliacs then arising together from the end of the aorta. (C) Either artery may give off a large branch, such as the ilio-lumbar, the lateral or the middle sacral, sometimes a lumbar, or occasionally an accessory renal arter3^THE ABTERIES 600 Collateral Circulation The collateral circulation after obstruction or ligature of the common iUac artery is carried on chiefly (fig. 374) by the anastomosis of the middle sacral with the lateral sacral; the internal mammary with the epigastric ; the lumbar arteries of the aorta with the ilio-lumbar and deep circumflex iliac; the pubic branch of the epigastric with the pubic branch of the obtm-ator; the posterior branches of the sacral arteries with the gluteal; the superior haemorrhoidal from the superior mesenteric, with the hsemorrhoidal branches of the internal iliac and pudic; the ovarian arteries from the aorta with the uterine branches of the internal iliac ; and by the anastomosis across the middle line of the pubic branch of the obtu- rator with the like vessel of the opposite side ; the lateral sacral with the opposite lateral sacral; and the vesical, hsemorrhoidal, uterine, and vaginal branches of the internal iliac with the corresponding branches of the opposite internal iliac. Branches of the Common Iliac Artery The branches of the common iliac arteries are :—(1) Peritoneal and sub- peritoneal ; (2) ureteric ; (3) internal iliac ; and (4) external iliac. (1) The peritoneal and subperitoneal are distributed to the peritoneum and subperitoneal fat. They anastomose with like vessels given off from the lumbar, phrenic, and renal arteries, forming a subperitoneal arterial anastomosis. They are very small and unimportant. (2) The ureteric are small insignificant twigs given off to the ureter as that' tube crosses the artery. They anastomose with the ureteric arteries given off from the spermatic above, and with those derived from the vesical arteries below. (3) THE INTEENAL ILIAC ARTEEY The internal iliac artery arises at the bifurcation of the common iliac opposite the upper margin of the sacro-iliac synchondrosis. It descends into the pelvis for about an inch and a quarter (3 cm.), and then divides, opposite the upper margin of the great sacro-sciatic foramen, into an anterior and a posterior branch. Relations.—Behind, it rests on the termination of the external iliac vein, the internal iliac vein, the inner margin of the psoas muscle, the lumbo-sacral cord, the obturator nerve, and the sacrum. In front it is covered by the peritoneum, and is crossed by the ureter. In the adult the internal iliac is smaller than the external iliac ; but in the foetus the internal is much larger than the external, and is, together with its anterior branch, the vessel by which the blood is returned to the placenta. In early foetal life it does not descend into the pelvis, but courses above the pelvic brim by the side of the allantois, and later by the side of the bladder and urachus, to the umbilicus, under the name of the hypogastric artery. At the umbilicus it is joined by the umbilical vein, and by the hypogastric artery of the opposite side. The two arteries, now known as the umbilical, coil spirally round the vein on their way to the placenta, forming the umbilical cord (fig. 368). After birth the hypogastric artery ceases to be pervious beyond the superior vesical branch, and is converted into a fibrous cord, the obliterated hypogastric artery. Variations.—(A) The internal iliac may be longer or shorter than usual. It is seldom less than an inch in length, but has been met with as short as half an inch, and as long as three inches. The variation in length generally depends upon the length of the common iliac ; when this bifurcates higher than usual, the internal iliac is then longer, and may lie at first above the brim of the pelvis ; but the length may also depend upon the artery itself dividing higher or lower than usual into its branches. This division may occur anywhere between the brim of the pelvis and the upper border of the sacro-sciatic foramen. (B) Its branches may be given off without the arterj^ dividing into an anterior and posterior division, or one or more branches may arise above the division.601 INTEBNAL ILIAC—ILIO-LUMBAB The branches of the posterior division of the internal iliac are :—(1) The ilio-lumbar ; (2) the lateral sacral; and (3) the gluteal. The branches of the anterior division are:—(1) The hypogastric; (2) the superior, middle, and inferior vesical; (3) the middle hsemorrhoidal; (4) the uterine ; (5) the vaginal; (6) the obturator; (7) the sciatic ; and (8) the internal pudic.

THE ILIO-LUMBAR ARTEEY The ilio-lumbar artery—a short vessel coming off from the posterior part of the internal iliac artery—runs upwards and outwards beneath the common iliac artery, first between the lumbo-sacral cord and obturator nerve, and then between602 THE ABTEBIES the psoas muscle and the vertebral column. On reaching the brmi of the pelvis it divides into two branches, an iliac and a lumbar. The iliac branch passes outwards beneath the psoas and anterior crural nerve and, perforating the iliacus, ramifies in the iliac fossa between that muscle and the bone. It su]Dplies a nutrient artery to the bone, and then breaks up into several branches which radiate from the parent trunk, upwards towards the sacro-iliac synchondrosis, outwards towards the crest of the ilium, downwards towards the anterior superior spine, and inwards towards the pelvic cavity. The first anastomoses with the last lumbar; the second with the external circumflex and gluteal; the third with the deep circumflex iliac from the external iliac ; the fourth with the iliac branch of the obturator. The lumbar branch ascends beneath the psoas, and, supplying that muscle and the quadratus lumborum, anastomoses with the last lumbar artery. It sends a branch into the spinal canal through the intervertebral foramen between the last lumbar vertebra and the sacrum, which anastomoses with the other spinal arteries. The ilio-lumbar artery is serially homologous with the lumbar arteries. Hence the similarity in its course and distribution. 2. THE LATEEAL SAGEAL AETEEIES The lateral sacral arteries, usually two in number, arise from the posterior division of the internal iliac. The superior artery, when two are present, runs downwards and inwards to the first anterior sacral foramen, through which it passes; and, after supplying the spinal membranes and anastomosing with the other spinal arteries, passes through the first posterior sacral foramen, and is distributed to the skin over the back of the sacrum, there anastomosing with branches of the gluteal and sciatic arteries. The inferior lateral sacral descends on the side of the sacrum, external to the sacral chain of the sympathetic, and internal to the anterior sacral foramina, crossing in its course the slips of origin of the pyriformis muscle and the first anterior sacral nerve. On reaching the coccyx it anastomoses in front of that bone with the middle sacral artery, and with the inferior lateral sacral of the opposite side. In this course it gives off:—Posterior or spinal branches, which enter the second, third, and fourth anterior sacral foramina, and, after supplying the spinal membranes and anastomosing with each other, leave the spinal canal by the corresponding posterior sacral foramina, and are distributed to the muscles and skin over the back of the sacrum ; anterior or rectal branches which run forward to the rectum ; external branches which are distributed to the pyriformis, coccygeus, and the sacral nerves ; and internal branches which pass inwards across the sacrum; to anastomose with branches of the middle sacral artery. At times the lateral sacral arteries are exceedingly small, the spinal branches then coming chiefly from the middle sacral. The anastomosing branches between the lateral sacral and middle sacral are usually regarded as sacral arteries diminished in size, and serially homologous with the lumbar and intercostal arteries. 3. THE GLUTEAL AETEEY The gluteal artery, the largest branch of the posterior division of the internal iliac, comes off as a short, thick trunk from the outer and back part of that vessel, of which indeed it may be regarded as the continuation. Passing backwards between the first sacral nerve and the lumbo-sacral cord through an osseo-tendinous arch formed by the margin of the bone and the upper edge of the pelvic fascia, it leaves the pelvis through the great sacro-sciatic foramen above the pyriformis muscle in company with its vein and the superior gluteal nerve. At its exit posteriorly from the great sciatic foramen it lies under cover of the gluteus maximus and I603 GLUTEAL beneath the gluteal vein, and in front of the superior gluteal nerve. It here breaks iup into two chief branches, a superficial and a deep. Its emergence from the ! pelvis is indicated on the surface by a point situated at the junction of the posterior with the middle third of a line drawn from the anterior superior to the posterior superior spine of the ilium. • Branches of the gluteal artery :— {a) Within the pelvis, branches are distributed to the obturator internus, the pyriformis, the levator ani, the coccygeus, and the pelvic bones. I [h] External to the pelvis, the artery divides into a superficial and deep branch. Fig. 369.—The Gluteal Kegion, with the Gluteal, Sciatic, and Pudic Arteries. (From a dissection by W. J.

The lower branches to the muscle anastomose with branches of the sciatic.604 THE ARTEBIES (ii) The deep branch subdivides into a superior and inferior branch, (a) The superior skirts along the hne of origin of the gluteus minimus, between the gluteus medius and the bone, and, emerging in front from beneath these muscles under cover of the tensor fasciae femoris (fig. 368), anastomoses with the ascending branch of the external circumflex and deep circumflex iliac arteries. (/?) The inferior branch passes forwards between the gluteus medius and minimus, accompanied by the branch to the tensor fasciae femoris of the inferior division of the superior gluteal nerve towards the great trochanter, where it anastomoses with the ascending branch of the external circumflex. It supplies branches to the contiguous muscles and to the hip joint. The deep branch before its division gives off the external nutrient artery of the ilium. Branches op the Anterior Division of the Internal | ^^^^ Iliac Artery 1. THE HYPOGASTEIC AETEEY The hypogastric artery, the main trunk of the internal iliac in the foetus, is the apparent continuation of the anterior branch of the internal iliac. Passing forwards along the side of the pelvis, it enters the lateral false ligament of the bladder, where, after giving off one or more vesical branches, it ceases to be pervious as it passes on to the side and upper part of the bladder. Thence it ascends, under cover of the anterior false ligament, as a fibrous cord, to the umbilicus, where it is joined by its fellow of the opposite side. As it lies in the lateral false ligament it is crossed by the vas deferens. 2. THE VESICAL AETEEIES The vesical arteries are divided into the superior, middle, and inferior. (1) The superior vesical artery—though usually described as a branch of the internal iliac, inasmuch as it is apparently given off from the anterior division of ■ that vessel—is really a branch of the unobliterated portion of what, in the foetus, was the hypogastric artery. It ramifies over the upper fundus of the bladder, anasto- mosing with the vessel of the opposite side anol with the middle and inferior vesical below. It gives off the following branches:—(a) The deferential, or artery of the vas deferens, arises from the superior vesical near the spot where the vas crosses the obliterated hypogastric artery, and, having reached the vas, divides into an ascending and descending branch. The ascenoiing branch follows the vas through the inguinal canal to the testicle, where it anastomoses with the sper- matic artery. The descending branch passes downwards to the dilated portion of the vas and vesicul^e seminales. (b) The uracheric branch passes upwards along the urachus. (c) The ureteric branches pass to the lower end of the ureter, which they supply, and anastomose with the other ureteric arteries, (d) The middle vesical (sometimes). ; (2) The middle vesical is a branch either of the superior vesical, or of the | unobliterated portion of the hypogastric artery. In the latter case it is given off | before the superior vesical. It is distributed to the sides and base of the bladder, i and anastomoses with the other vesical arteries. j (3) The inferior vesical arises from the anterior division of the internal iliac, | frequently in common with the middle haemorrhoidal, and passes downwards and inwards to the base of the bladder, where it breaks up into branches which ramify over the lower part of the viscus. It gives off:—{a) Branches to the prostate, which supply that organ and anastomose with the arteries of the opposite side by liinon temori ites' iiicli fiVESICAL— UTEBINE 605 means of descending arteries which pass through the prostatic plexus of veins, but outside the capsule of the prostate, and with the inferior haemorrhoidal branches of the internal pudic. At times one of these prostatic branches is of large size, and supplies certain of the parts normally supplied by the internal pudic. It is then known as the accessory pudic. {h) Branches to the vesiculse seminales ; and (c) branches (in the female) to the vagina. (See Vaginal Artery.) The artery of the vas deferens sometimes arises from the inferior vesical, instead of from the superior vesical. I 3. THE MIDDLE H^MOEEHOIDAL AKTERY The middle haemorrhoidal or the middle rectal artery, variable in its origin, perhaps most commonly arises from the anterior division of the internal iliac along with the inferior vesical. It runs inwards to the sides of the middle portion of jthe rectum, dividing into branches which anastomose above with the superior haemorrhoidal derived from the inferior mesenteric, and below with the inferior hfemorrhoidal derived from branches of the pudic. Its corresponding vein termi- nates in the inferior mesenteric vein. j 4. THE UTERINE ARTERY i The uterine artery arises from the anterior branch of the internal iliac close jto or in conjunction with the middle haemorrhoidal or inferior vesical. It runs down- wards and inwards in the pelvic connective tissue, crossing the ureter about half an Fig, 370.—Scheme of the Ovarian and Uterine and Vaginal Arteries.

It then turns upwards and ascends between the layers of the broad ligament on the side of the uterus in a coiled and tortuous manner, and, after giving off a number of tortuous branches which ramify in a horizontal606 THE ABTERIES I manner over the front and back of the uterus, supplying its substance, anasto- moses with the uterine branch of the ovarian artery. The distribution of the vessel in the uterus will be described with that organ. The branches of the uterine artery are :—(1) Cervical.—This branch comes off from the uterine as the latter artery crosses the ureter to turn upwards on to the uterus. It runs directly inwards, i and divides into three or four branches which pass on to the cervix at right angles I to it; one branch anastomosing with its fellow of the opposite side in front and behind the neck, forming the so-called coronary artery of the cervix. (2) Vaginal azygos.—A second branch descends both in front and behind in the middle line of the cervix on to the vagina, and forms, with branches of the vaginal arteries, the so-calLed azygos artery of the vagina. 5. THE VAGINAL AETEEIES The vaginal arteries come off separately from the anterior division of the internal iliac, or one or more of them may arise in common with the inferior vesical, uterine, or middle h^emorrhoidal arteries. They are usually two or three in number. They pass through the pelvic connective tissue to the side of the vagina, supplying its walls, and anastomosing with the corresponding arteries of the opposite side, with each other, and with tortuous branches from the artery of the cervix, a branch of the uterine. With this vessel they form a more or less vertical trunk in the median line of the vagina, both back and front. This vessel is known as the azygos artery of the vagina. The lower vaginal arteries extend to the bulb of the vestibule, where they communicate with the bulbal branch of the internal pudic. Small branches extend also on to the rectum. 6. THE OBTURATOR ARTERY I The obturator artery comes off from the anterior division of the internal iliac at about the same spot as the hypogastric. Occasionally it arises from the posterior t division. Its runs forward and downwards a little below the brim of the pelvis, having the obturator nerve above, and the obturator vein below. It here lies between the peritoneum and the pelvic fascia, but pierces the fascia to gain the obturator canal, the aperture in the upper and outer part of the obturator membrane. In this course it is crossed by the vas deferens. On emerging from the obturator canal, the artery divides into two branches, an external and an internal, which wind ; round the margin of the thyroid foramen beneath the obturator externus muscle. Within the pelvis the artery gives off:—(1) An iliac or nutrient branch ; (2) a vesical branch ; and (B) a pubic branch. Without the pelvis, it divides into :—(1) An external branch ; and (2) an internal branch. A. Intrapelvic branches.—(1) The iliac or nutrient branch ascends to the ihac fossa, passing between the iliacus muscle and the bone. It supplies a nutrient vessel to the ilium, and anastomoses with the internal branch of the iliac division | of the ilio-lumbar artery. (2) The vesical branch or branches are small vessels which run in the lateral false ligament of the bladder to that organ, where they anastomose with the other ! vesical arteries. (3) The pubic branch comes off from the obturator as that vessel is leaving the pelvis by the obturator canal. It runs upwards and inwards behind the pubes, anastomosing with its fellow of the opposite side of the body, and with the pubic branch of the deep epigastric artery. One of the anastomosing channels between the pubic branch of the obturator and pubic branch of the deep epigastric arteriesOB TUBA TOB—SCIA TIG 607 is sometimes of large size, a fact of sm^gical interest in that the enlarged vessel may 1 then run round the inner side of the femoral ring (page 613). I B. Extrapelvic branches.—(1) The external branch skirts the external margin i of the thyroid foramen,' lying between the obturator externus and the obturator i membrane. At the lower margin of the foramen it divides into two branches. One branch continues its course round the loAver margin of the foramen, and anasto- moses with the internal branch of the obturator and with the internal circumflex. I The other branch turns outwards below the acetabulum, and ends in the muscles j arising from the tuberosity of the ischium. It anastomoses with the sciatic artery. This branch gives off a small twig which passes under the transverse ligament into the hip joint, where it supplies the synovial membrane, the ligamentum teres, and the fat in the fossa at the bottom of the acetabulum. (2) The internal branch runs round the inner margin of the thyroid foramen, and anastomoses with the inner division of the external branch and with the internal j circumflex artery. It supplies branches to the obturator and adductor muscles. ! 7. THE SCIATIC AETERY i The sciatic artery—the larger of the terminal branches of the anterior division j of the internal iliac—passes over the sacral plexus and pyriformis muscle to the I lower part of the great sciatic foramen, where it leaves the pelvis with the pudic j artery, behind and external to which it lies, by passing between the pyriformis and coccygeus muscles. On emerging from the great sciatic foramen in the gluteal region under cover of the gluteus maximus, it descends to the inner side of the great sciatic I nerve, lying midway between the tuberosity of the ischium and the great trochanter on the gemellus superior, obturator internus, gemellus inferior, quadratus femoris, and upper part of the adductor magnus muscles. It anastomoses with the internal circumflex artery, and superior perforating branch of the profunda. The branches of the sciatic artery are divided into the intra- and extra-pelvic. The intrapelvic branches are small and unimportant, and irregular in their origin and distribution. They are given off to the levator ani, coccygeus, and pyriformis muscles, the rectum, bladder, prostate gland, and vesicul* seminales. I The extrapelvic branches are : (1) The coccygeal; (2) inferior gluteal; (3) mus- I cular; (4) anastomotic ; (5) articular ; (6) cutaneous ; and (7) comes nervi ischiatici. (1) The coccygeal is a small branch which passes inwards, and, piercing the great sacro-sciatic ligament and the gluteus maximus, is lost in the integument over the lower part of the sacrum and coccyx. It gives several branches to the , lower and internal part of the gluteus maximus as it passes through it. i' (2) The inferior gluteal is a fairly large branch which arises from the sciatic i just below the coccygeal, and, turning upwards and inwards into the deep surface ! of the gluteus maximus along with the inferior gluteal nerve, supplies that muscle, and anastomoses with the gluteal artery. (3) The muscular branches, variable in their number and origin, pass to the I pyriformis, obturator internus, and gemelli muscles, anastomosing with the pudic, the internal circumflex, and the obturator arteries. (4) The anastomotic branch crosses the external rotator muscles either over or j under the great sciatic nerve, and contributes to the formation of the so-called crucial j anastomosis by anastomosing with the first perforating below, the termination ! of the internal circumflex internally, and the transverse branch of the external circumflex externally (fig. 369). (5) The articular branches pass beneath the external rotator muscles with the nerve to the quadratus femoris, and send several filaments into the posterior part of the capsule of the hip joint. !608 THE ABTEBIES (6) The cutaneous branches turn round the lower border of the gluteus maximus, along with branches of the small sciatic nerve, and supply the integu- ment of that region. (7) The comes nervi isehiatici is a long slender vessel which passes down the back of the thigh with the great sciatic nerve, to which it sends numerous branches. It anastomoses with the internal circumflex, and with the first, second, and third perforating arteries, and with the termination of the profunda, or fourth perfora- ting. After ligature of the femoral in Scarpa's triangle, this artery becomes greatly enlarged, and contributes through its anastomosis with the above-mentioned arteries to the supply of the parts below the ligature. 8. THE INTEENAL PUDIC ARTERY | The internal pudic artery—the smaller of the two terminal branches of the anterior division of the internal iliac artery—comes off with the sciatic, the other terminal branch, either separately or as a common trunk, opposite the pyriformis ( muscle. It descends with the sciatic over the pyriformis and sacral plexus of nerves, lying anterior and internal to the latter artery as far as the lower border | of the great sciatic foramen, where it passes out of the pelvis between the pyriformis and coccygeus muscles. It then winds over the outer surface of the spine of the ischium under cover of the gluteus maximus, and re-enters the pelvis through the ' lesser sciatic notch. Running forwards over the obturator internus muscle, it passes through the base of the triangular ligament, and, continuing its course along the ramus of the pubes, gives off between the two layers of the triangular ligament the artery of the crus and the artery of the bulb, and is continued through the anterior layer of the ligament as the dorsal artery of the penis. The relations of the artery may be considered :—(1) As it lies within the pelvis; (2) as it crosses the spine of the ischium ; (3) as it lies on the obturator internus j muscle, in the outer wall of the ischio-rectal fossa ; and (4) as it lies between the two j layers of the triangular ligament. [ (1) Within the pelvis the artery crosses the pyriformis muscle and sacral plexus | of nerves, lying somewhat anterior and internal to the sciatic artery, which is usually given off from the internal iliac along with it. At the lower border of the sciatic ; foramen it leaves the pelvis by passing between the pyriformis and coccygeus ■ muscles along with the sciatic artery, the pudic nerve, the greater and lesser sciatic nerves, and the nerve to the obturator internus. : (2) As it crosses the spine of the ischium it has a companion vein on either side,; the pudic nerve on its inner side, and the nerve to the obturator internus on its outer side. It is covered by the gluteus maximus muscle, and more or less by the over-? lapping edge of the great sacro-sciatic ligament. In a thin subject it can be felt pulsating as it crosses the ischial spine. A spot taken at the junction of the inner with the outer two-thirds of a line drawn from the top of the great trochanter with the femur rotated inwards to the base of the coccyx, indicates externally the situatioD | of the artery as it crosses the ischial spine. In this situation it may, in a thin subject, be compressed. The branches of the artery in this part of its course are :| {a) Small twigs to the gluteus maximus ; {h) a small branch to the obturator internus | which accompanies the nerve to that muscle ; (c) a sacral branch which pierces; the great sciatic ligament and anastomoses with the sciatic artery. (3) In the third part of its course, as it lies on the obturator internus muscle in the outer wall of the ischio-rectal fossa, it is placed about an inch and a hali (3*5 cm.) above the lower margin of the tuberosity of the ischium. It is here bound down to the muscle by a strong sheath of the obturator layer of the pelvic fascia (Alcock's canal). In this part of its course the dorsal nerve of the penis and th(609 INTEBNAL PUDIG superficial perinasal nerve, into which the pudic nerve divides about this situation, lie respectively above and below the artery. The branches of the pudic artery in the third part of its course are :—{a) The external or inferior hsemorrhoidal; and (6) the superficial perinaeal. {a) The external or inferior hsemorrhoidal branches (inferior or posterior anal) are given off from the pudic at the posterior part of the ischio-rectal fossa, just after it enters the outer wall of that cavity through the lesser sciatic foramen. They perforate the sheath of obturator fascia binding the pudic artery to the obturator internus, and course transversely through the fat of the ischio-rectal fossa, inwards to the anus, where they supply the sphincter muscle and levator ani, and anastomose with the superior and middle haemorrhoidal arteries. Twigs are given Fig. 370a.—The Arteries of the PERiNiEUM. On the right side Colles's fascia has been turned back to show the superficial vessels. On the left side the superficial vessels have been cut away with the anterior layer of the triangular ligament to show the deep vessels. off from them to the skin covering the anal triangle of the perinseum; other branches supply the gluteus maximus and wind over the posterior fold of that muscle to the integuments ; whilst others again run forwards and anastomose with the transverse and superficial perinaaal arteries (fig. 370a). (h) The superficial perinseal branch arises from the pudic at the front of the ischio-rectal fossa, just before that vessel pierces the posterior layer of the triangular ligament. It passes through the deep layer of the superficial fascia of the perineum, (Colles's fascia), where that structure is continued into the anterior layer of the triangular ligament round the transverse perinaeal muscle. It then crosses in front oi (occasionally behind) that muscle, and enters the perinseal triangle, the space between Colles's fascia and the anterior layer of the triangular ligament, bounded by the erector penis externally, the accelerator urinee internally, and the transverse BE610 THE ABTEBIES peringeal muscle below. On nearing the apex of this triangle it divides into long slender branches, which are continued along the back of the scrotum, anastomosing with the superficial external pudic branch of the common femoral. In this course it is accompanied by the superficial perin^eal nerve. It supplies the contiguous muscles and the integuments of the scrotum. As a rule it gives off the following branch:— The transverse perinseal artery usually arises from the before-mentioned artery. Occasionally it is a direct branch from the pudic trunk. It courses trans- versely inwards, on the transverse perinasal muscle, towards the central tendon of the perineum, supplying the muscles and integuments of the periuEeum, and anastomosing with its fellow of the opposite side. (4) In the fourth part of its course the pudic artery lies between the two layers of the triangular ligament, close to the ramus of the pubes, in the substance of the compressor urethrae muscle, having the anterior layer of the triangular ligament in front and the posterior layer behind. In this situation it gives off the artery of the bulb and the artery of the crus penis, and then continues its course forwards Fig. 371.—Scheme of the Pudic Artery and its Branches.

The branches of the pudic artery in the fourth part of its course are :—{a) The artery of the bulb ; (&) the artery of the crus ; and (c) the dorsal artery of the penis. (a) The artery of the bulb, often of large size, comes off from the pudic soon after that vessel has passed between the two layers of the triangular ligament. It runs inwards and slightly upwards behind the anterior layer of the triangular ligament, embedded more or less in the substance of the compressor urethr^e muscle. On nearing the urethra, it passes forwards through a hole in the anterior layer of the triangular ligament (fig. 371), by the side of the opening for the urethra, and, entering the bulb, supplies the erectile tissue of the bulb and corpus spongiosum in the way described under the anatomy of the urethra. It gives off a branch, just before piercing the anterior layer of the triangular ligament, to Cowper's glands (fig. 370a). The situation of the artery of the bulb should be remembered in performing the operation of lateral lithotomy. As a rule, the artery is well above the central tendon of the perinaeum. If the point of the knife is entered below this spot, and care is taken not to direct its point subsequently too much upwards so that the deeperPUDIC—EXTEBNAL ILIAC 611 i part of the incision is not made higher than the superficial, the artery will not i be endangered. At times, however, the artery is given off from the pudic lower than normal. Its division may then be unavoidable. When the artery is given off, as it occasionally is, from the accessory pudic, it I pierces the anterior layer of the triangular ligament higher up, and is out of danger in the ordinary low operation of lateral lithotomy. Further, the artery of the bulb may be absent on one side, smaller than usual, or double. In the female, the artery of the bulb, smaller than in the male, ends in the bulb ! of the vestibule. {h) The artery of the cms is usually given off from the pudic a little higher than the artery of the bulb. It makes at once for the ramus of the pubes, perforates the anterior layer of the triangular ligament close to the bone, and enters the crus penis (figs. 370a, 371). This artery has to be divided in the operation for the removal of the I whole of the penis by dissecting off the crura from the rami of the pubis and ischium. [ Its situation close to the bone at times gives rise to some little trouble in securing it. In the female the artery ends in the crus clitoridis. (c) The dorsal artery of the penis (fig. 371), the termination of the pudic, passes j upwards between the two layers of the triangular ligament in the substance of the compressor urethra muscle ; then, turning forwards, perforates the anterior layer of the triangular ligament, near its apex, a little to one side of the central apical opening for the dorsal vein. It then passes between the two layers of the suspen- sory ligament of the penis, and descends along the dorsum of that organ, the single centrally placed dorsal vein separating it from the artery of the opposite side. The dorsal nerve lies to the outer side of the artery, and, still more external, the deep external pudic branch of the common femoral artery. At the gians the dorsal ' artery forms an anastomotic chain around the corona with the vessel of the opposite side. The superficial external pudic branch of the femoral at times may ; take the place of the dorsal artery. In the female, the termination of the pudic is called the dorsal artery of the ! clitoris. The dorsal artery gives branches to—[a) The corpus cavernosum ; {h) the skin of the penis ; (c) the glans penis ; and in the female, {d) the glans and prepuce of the clitoris. THE EXTERNAL ILIAC ARTERY The external iliac artery—the larger in the adult of the two vessels into which I the common iliac divides opposite the lumbo-sacral articulation—extends from this spot along the brim of the pelvis, lying upon the inner border of the psoas muscle, to the lower margin of Poupart's ligament, where, midway between the anterior ' superior spine of the ilium and the symphysis pubis, it passes into the thigh, and takes the name of the femoral. It measures three and a half to four inches (10 cm.) in length. The course j of the vessel is indicated by a line drawn from half an inch below and a little to the left of the umbilicus, to the centre of Poupart's ligament, that is, to a spot midway between the symphysis pubis and the anterior superior spine of the ilium, i If this line is divided into thirds, the lower two thirds would indicate the situation of the external iliac, the upper third the common iliac. The external iliac vein, the continuation upwards of the femoral vein from the thigh, lies to the inner side of the artery, but on a slightly lower plane, and just before its termination gets a little behind the artery on the right side. Relations.—In front, the artery together with the vein is covered by the 1 parietal peritoneum descending from the abdomen into the pelvis, and by a layer I of condensed subperitoneal tissue, known as Abernethy's fascia. It is crossed by 1 E E 2612 THE ABTERIES the termination of the ileum on the right side, and by the sigmoid flexm-e on the left. The genital branch of the genito-crural nerve runs obliquely over its lower third, and just before its termination it is crossed transversely by the circumflex iliac vein. The spermatic vessels lie for a short distance on the lower part of the artery, and the vas deferens and the ovarian vessels in the female curve over it to descend to the pelvis. It is sometimes crossed at its origin by the ureter. The external iliac lymphatic glands lie along the course of the artery. Behind.—At first the artery lies partly upon its own vein ; lower down upon the inner border of the psoas ; and just before it passes through the lacuna ! vasculosa, beneath Poupart's ligament, upon the tendon of the psoas. The continuation of the iliac into the pelvis fascia is also below it. To its inner side is the external iliac vein, the peritoneum, the descending layer of fascia, and the vas deferens in the male, and ovarian vessels in the female. To its outer side is the psoas muscle and the iliac fascia. Variations.—(A) The external iliac may be longer or shorter than usual, according as j the common iliac bifurcates above or below the usual spot. When longer it often takes a very tortuous course, making a partial loop or bend which may dip down below the brim of the pelvis. (B) It may be much smaller in size than usual; this is especially the case in those instances in which the femoral or main vessel of the lower limb arises from the ■ sciatic or other branch of the internal iliac. It then often ends in the profunda. (C) It may give off a large branch, as the deep circumflex iliac or deep epigastric, higher than usual. . The collateral circulation is carried on (fig. 372), when the external iliac is tied, by the anastomosis of the ilio-lumbar and lumbar arteries with the circumflex iliac ; the internal mammary with the epigastric; the obturator with the internal circumflex; the ; sciatic with the internal circumflex and superior perforating; the gluteal with the external circumflex ; the arteria comes nervi ischiatici from the sciatic, with the perforating branches of the profunda; the external pudic with the internal pudic; the pubic branch of the obtm^ator with the pubic branch of the epigastric. The branches of the external iliac artery are :—(1) The deep epigastric ; (2) i the deep circumflex iliac ; and (3) several small and insigniflcant twigs to the neighbouring psoas muscle and lymphatic glands. (1) The Deep Epigastric Arteey | The deep epigastric artery usually comes off from the external iliac just j above Poupart's ligament. Immediately after its origin, the vas deferens in the male, and the round ligament in the female, loop round it on their way to the 1 pelvis, drawing, as it were, the artery slightly inwards and downwards. Itj here lies internal to the inner margin of the deep or internal abdominal ring| j behind the inguinal canal, and a little to the upper and outer side of the femoral 1 | ring. Thence it passes upwards and inwards, above and to the outer side of the j !■ superficial or external abdominal ring, lying between the fascia transversalis and i the peritoneum to the lower margin of the posterior layer of the sheath of the rectus (fold of Douglas). Passing beneath this margin, it turns upwards between the rectus and its sheath, lying here about midway between the outer and inner ' edge of the muscle. Higher, it enters the substance of the muscle, and anastomoses' 'J with the superior epigastric, descending in the rectus from the internal mammary.; ^ The situation of the artery between the two abdominal rings should be borne in, ■ mind in the operation for strangulated inguinal hernia, and its near proximity tc the upper and outer side of the femoral ring should not be forgotten in the operation for femoral hernia. The artery is accompanied by two veins, of which the inner is the larger. They end in a single trunk before opening into the external iliac vein | The deep epigastric gives off the following small branches:—(a) The cremasteric i which runs with the vas through the inguinal canal, supplies the cremaster muscle | | and anastomoses with the spermatic, inferior external pudic, and superficial perinsea. \613 EXTEBNAL ILIAC—FEMOBAL arteries, {h) The pubic, which passes below, or sometimes above, the femoral ring ' to the back of the pubes, where it anastomoses with the pubic branch of the obtu- rator and the corresponding vessel of the opposite side, (c) The muscular, which supply the rectus and the oblique and transverse muscles of the abdomen, and anastomose with the lower intercostal and the lumbar arteries, (d) The cutaneous, which pierce the rectus, and supply the skin, anastomosing with branches of the superficial epigastric. And [e) the terminal, which anastomose above the umbilicus with the superior epigastric branch of the internal mammary. Variations.—(A) The epigastric may come off from the external iliac higher than usual; i| it has been met with arising as much as two inches and a half above Poupart's ligament. (B) It may arise from the femoral below Poupart's ligament, or even from the profunda. (C) It may arise as a common trunk with the circumflex iliac. (D) It is sometimes double. I (E) It may arise from the obturator, or conversely it may give off the obtm^ator artery. This variation is due to the enlargement of the normal anastomosis of the epigastric and obturator through their pubic branches. It is of considerable importance to the surgeon, since the obturator artery, when given off from the epigastric, may run either external or I internal to the femoral ring to reach the obturator foramen. This abnormal origin of the obturator is said to occur once in every three subjects and a half; but the abnormal artery only courses round the inner side of the ring—in which situation it is liable to injury in the operation for femoral hernia—in exceptional cases. According to Langton (Holden's ; 'Anatomy '), the chances are about seventy to one against this occurring. But even when i it takes the abnormal course, it lies a line and a half or so from the margin of the ring, and will probably escape injury in the division of the strictiu'e if several short notches are made 1 in place of a single and longer incision. (2) The Deep Cikcumflex Iliac Aktery The deep circumflex iliac arises from the outer side of the external iliac artery, either opposite the epigastric or a little below the origin of that vessel. It courses upwards and outwards just above the lower margin of Poupart's ligament, lying between the fascia transversalis and the peritoneum, or at times in a fibrous i canal formed by the union of the fascia transversalis with the iliac fascia. Near the i anterior superior spine of the ilium, it perforates the transversalis, and then courses between that muscle and the internal oblique, along and a little above the crest of the ilium. It finally divides into an ascending branch, which anastomoses with the lumbar and lower intercostal arteries, and a marginal branch which runs backwards I to anastomose with the ilio-lumbar artery. It is accompanied by two veins. These unite into one trunk, which then crosses the external iliac artery to join the external : iliac vein. The deep circumflex iliac artery gives off the following branches:—{a) Muscular branches, which supply the psoas, iliacus, sartorius, tensor fascise femoris, and the oblique and transverse muscles of the abdomen, {h) Cutaneous branches, which supply the skin over the course of the vessel, and anastomose with the superficial circumflex iliac, the gluteal, and the^ ascending branch of the external circumflex. Variations.—(A) The circumflex iliac, like the epigastric, may be given off from the external iliac higher than normal, though seldom if ever as high as the latter. (B) More rarely it may come off from the femoral below Poupart's ligament. (C) It may arise as a j common trunk with the epigastric. (D) It may be double. ' THE FEMOEAL ARTEEY The femoral artery (fig. 872) is the continuation of the external iliac, and extends ! from the lower border of Poupart's ligament, down the front and inner part of the thigh, to the tendinous opening in the adductor magnus, through which it passes into the popliteal space, and is then known as the popUteal. The femoral artery614 THE ABTEBIES is at first quite superficial, being merely covered by the skin, and superficial and deep fascia ; but, after thus passing about five inches (13 cm.) in a direction downwards and inwards through the space known as Scarpa's triangle, it sinks at the apex of that triangle beneath the sartorius muscle, and thence to its termination continues beneath the sartorius, coursing deeply between the vastus internus and adductor muscles in the space known as Hunter's canal. It at first rests upon the brim of the pelvis and head of the thigh bone, from which it is merely separated by the capsule of the hip joint and the tendon of the psoas. Here it can be readily com- pressed. Owing to the obliquity of the neck of the femur and the direct course | taken by the artery, it lies lower down only on muscles, at some little distance from | the bone (fig. 873). At its termination, in consequence of the shaft of the femur inclining towards the middle line of the body, the artery lies close to the bone, but to the inner side. The course of the vessel when the thigh is slightly flexed and abducted—the position in which the limb is placed when the vessel is ligatured—is indicated by a line drawn from a spot midway between the anterior superior spine of the ilium and the symphysis pubis to the adductor tubercle. When the thigh is in the extended position and parallel to its fellow, the course of the artery will correspond to a line drawn from the spot above-mentioned to the inner border of i the patella. The artery for about the first inch and a half to two inches (4-5 cm.) is known as i the common femoral, but at this distance from Poupart's ligament it gives off a large branch called the profunda, or deep femoral. For the rest of its course it is known i as the superficial femoral. The superficial femoral is only superficial where it lies in Scarpa's triangle—that is, for about three and a half inches (9 cm.) of its course ; j the remainder of the artery being deeply placed in Hunter's canal, though less | deeply than the profunda, or deep femoral. The details of the anatomy of the • femoral will perhaps best be studied by considering the relations of (1) the common | femoral; (2) the superficial femoral as it lies in Scarpa's triangle; and (3) the I superficial femoral as it lies in Hunter's canal. ; (1) The relations of the common femoral artery.—In front, the common femoral (fig. 372) is covered by the skin, the superficial fascia, the iliac portion of the fascia lata, the crural branch of the genito-crural nerve, the superficial circumflex iliac i vein, and sometimes the superficial epigastric vein. The fascia transversalis, which is continued downwards into the thigh beneath Poupart's ligament, is also one of ! its anterior relations, but soon becomes indistinguishable from the sheath of the vessel. j Behind, the artery rests upon the tendon of the psoas muscle, which separates it from the brim of the pelvis and capsule of the hip joint, and, a little lower, on the pectineus, more or less loose fat and cellular tissue intervening. The branches of the anterior crural nerve to the pectineus muscle also pass behind it. A similar prolongation to that derived from the fascia transversalis in front descends behind the vessel from the iliac fascia; but, like the anterior prolongation of fascia, soon blends with the sheath of the vessels. To the inner side is the femoral vein, but separated from the artery in the upper part of its course by a thin layer of fascia passing from the continuation of the iliac fascia behind the vessels, to "the continuation of the fascia transversalis in front of the vessels. To the outer side is the leash of nerves known as the anterior crural. (2) The relations of the superficial femoral artery in Scarpa's triangle (fig. 372). —In front, the artery is covered by the skin and by the superficial and deep fascia, | and is crossed at the lower part of Scarpa's triangle by a branch of the internal j cutaneous nerve. The crural branch of the genito-crural nerve is superficial to it, but is separated from this part of the femoral artery by the deep fascia. I Behind, the artery lies on the pectineus, from which it is separated by the femoral jFEMOBAL 615 vein and the profunda vein and artery. Lower down, it lies on the upper portion of the adductor longus muscle. To its outer side is the long saphenous nerve and the nerve to the vastus internus, the anterior crural nerve having in this situation more or less broken up into its components. To its inner side is the femoral vein, which, however, at the apex of Scarpa's triangle, is getting somewhat behind the artery. Fig. 372.—The Femoral Artery in Scarpa's Triangle.

AND NERVE TO VA& INTERNUS Vastus internus muscle The superficial femoral varies in length according to the distance that the pro- funda is given off from the common femoral below Poupart's ligament. As a rule, it measures three inches and a half (9 cm.), the common an inch and a half (4 cm.). But the profunda may come off two or more inches below Poupart's ligament, in which case the superficial femoral will be shorter to this extent; or it may come off less than an inch and a half below Poupart's ligament, or even from the external iliac above Poupart's ligament, when the superficial will be longer than normal. TheTHE ARTEBIES 616 practical point to remember is that it is more usual to meet with a short than with a long common femoral, and that, if the superficial femoral is tied at the apex of Scarpa's triangle—i.e. the spot where the inner edge of the sartorius comes into contact with the adductor longus—there is nearly always a sufficient length of that vessel above the ligature to ensure a firm internal clot, and consequently, as far as this point is concerned, a successful result. (3) The relations of the superficial femoral artery in Hunter's canal.—Hunter's canal is the somewhat triangularly shaped space bounded by the vastus internus on the outer side, the adductors longus and magnus on the inner side, and by an apo- neurosis thrown across from the adductors to the vastus in front. Below, the canal terminates at the opening in the adductor magnus; above, its limit is less well defined, as here the aponeurosis between the muscles becomes less tendinous, and gradually fades away into the perimuscular fascia. The transverse direction of the fibres of the aponeurotic covering at the lower two-thirds of the canal is character- istic, and serves as a rallying point in tying the artery in this part of its course. Lying superficial to the aponeurosis is the sartorius muscle. The superficial femoral artery as it lies in this canal has the following relations :— In front, in addition to the skin, superficial and deep fascia, are the sartorius muscle and the aponeurotic fibres of the canal. The internal saphenous nerve crosses the artery from without inwards, lying in the wall of the canal. Behind is the angle of meeting of the vastus internus and the adductors. The femoral vein lies behind the artery, but gets a little external to it at the lower part of the canal. It is here very firmly and closely attached to the artery, embracing it as it were on its posterior and external aspect. Hence it is very liable to be punctured on ligaturing the artery in this part of its course. Such an accident is best avoided by opening the sheath of the vessels well to the inner side of the front of the artery, and by keeping the point of the aneurysm needle closely applied to the vessel in passing it from without inwards between the vein and the artery. There are sometimes two veins, which then more or less surround the artery. 9T0 its inner side is the adductor longus above and the adductor magnus below. To its outer side is the vastus internus, and at the lower part of the canal the femoral vein. Variations in the Femoral Artery The most important variations in the femoral artery are :—(A) The femoral arising from the sciatic or internal iliac, and passing out of the pelvis and down the back of the thigh with the great sciatic nerve to the popliteal space; the external iliac under these circumstances ending in the profunda or external circumflex, or some other branch of the femoral. (B) A double condition of the femoral artery below the origin of the profunda; the vessel re-uniting lower down the thigh. (C) A vas aberrans given off from the inner side of the common femoral or external iliac, and joining the femoral lower down. (D) The vein may remain to the inner side of the artery its whole distance through the thigh, or it may be double, especially in Hunter's canal. There is often a plexiform arrangement of the vein around the artery in this situation. (E) The variations in the origin of the profunda have been already mentioned. Branches of the Femoral Artery The femoral artery gives off the following branches :— A. From the common femoral:—(1) The superficial epigastric ; (2) the superficial circumflex iliac; (3) the superficial external pudic; (4) the deep external pudic; and (5) the profunda. B. From the superficial femoral in Scarpa's triangle :—(1) Muscular branches ; and (2) the saphenous branch. C.

Branches of the Common Femoral (1) The superficial epigastric artery comes off from the femoral about half an inch below Ponpart's ligament. At its origin it is beneath the fascia lata, but almost at once passes through this fascia, or else through the saphenous opening, and courses upwards and inwards in front of the external oblique muscle almost as far as the umbilicus. It ends in numerous small twigs, which anasto- mose with the cutaneous branches from the deep epigastric and internal mammary. In its course it gives off' small branches to the inguinal glands and to the skin and superficial fasciae. Running with it is the superficial epigastric vein, which ends in the long saphenous just before the latter passes through the saphenous opening. (2) The superficial circumflex iliac artery (fig. 372), usually smaller than the i superficial epigastric, arises either in common with that vessel, or else as a separate I branch from the femoral. It passes upwards and outwards over the iliacus, and, soon | perforating the fascia lata a little to the outer side of the saphenous opening, runs | more or less parallel to Poupart's ligament about as far as the crest of the ilium, where it ends in branches which anastomose with the deep circumflex iliac artery. I In its course it gives off branches to the iliacus and sartorius muscles, to the inguinal glands, and to the fascia and skin. Its companion vein, the superficial circumflex: iliac, ends in the long saphenous vein just before the latter passes through the saphe- nous opening. (3) The superficial or superior external pudic artery arises from the inner side of the femoral, either a little above or else in common with the deep or inferior external pudic. It passes either through the fascia lata, or else through the cribri- form fascia covering the saphenous opening, ascends upwards and inwards over the j spermatic cord in the male, or round ligament in the female, and divides intcj branches, one of which supplies the integuments above the pubes, while anothei' descends along the penis external to the dorsal artery, with which, and with the j corresponding artery of the opposite side, it anastomoses at the corona. In the| female, this branch terminates in the preputium clitoridis, anastomosing witb the dorsal artery of that organ. Small branches also descend to the scrotum anc j labium respectively. As it crosses the cord it anastomoses with the cremasteric branch of the deep epigastric. It is accompanied by two small veins, whicl usually join to form a single vein opening into the upper end of the long saphenous (4) The deep or inferior external pudic artery arises from the inner side of th( femoral artery, either in common with the preceding branch or a little lower down I It runs inwards beneath the deep fascia, across the pectineus and adductor longu^j muscles, and, perforating the fascia close to the ramus of the pubes, suppliefj the skin of the scrotum or the corresponding part, the labium major, in th(! female, anastomosing with the superficial perineal branch of the internal pudicj It supplies small twigs to the pectineus and adductor muscles as it crosses themj Its companion veins terminate as a single trunk in the long saphenous. j (5) The profunda or deep femoral artery (figs. 372, 373) is the chief nutrien vessel of the thigh. It is usually given off from the back and outer part of th( common femoral, about an inch and a half (4 cm.) below Poupart's ligament. A first it is a little external to the femoral, but as it runs downwards and backward j it gets behind that artery and closer to the bone. On reaching the upper horde j of the adductor longus muscle, it leaves the femoral, and, passing beneath th j muscle, pierces the adductor magnus, and finally, much reduced in size, ends in th j hamstring muscles. Relations.—Behind, the artery lies successively upon the iliacus, the pectineus j the adductor brevis, and adductor magnus muscles. In front, at first it ij superficial, being merely covered by the skin, superficial and deep fasciae, ani j branches of the anterior crural nerve; but as it sinks behind the femoral artery, it ha j IBBANCHES OF COMMON FEMOBAL 619 in front of it both the femoral and the profunda veins, and lower down the adductor longus muscle. Externally, it is separated from the bone by the vastus internus. Internally are the pectineus and the angle of meeting of the adductor brevis and adductor magnus muscles. Branches of the profunda.—The profunda gives off the following branches :— {a) The external circumflex; [h) the internal circumflex; and (c) the three per- forating. The termination of the artery is sometimes called the fourth perforating branch. {a) The external circumflex, a short trunk, but the largest in diameter of the branches of the artery, arises from the outer side of the profunda as it lies on the iliacus muscle, about three-quarters of an inch (2 cm.) below the origin of that vessel from the femoral. It passes transversely outwards over the iliacus, under the sartorius and rectus, and between the branches of the anterior crural nerve. In this course it gives off branches to the rectus and crureus, and then divides into three chief sets of branches—an ascending, transverse, and descending. (i) The ascending branch, consisting of one or more separate vessels, runs upwards beneath the sartorius ; then, sinking deeply beneath the tensor fasciae femoris on the outer side, and the gluteus medius and minimus on the inner side, anastomoses with the superior gluteal and the deep circumflex iliac arteries. This branch also supplies a twig which runs upwards under the rectus to the hip joint. (ii) The transverse branch, or branches, run transversely outwards, and, winding over the crureus and piercing the vastus externus, anastomose towards the back of the thigh with the superior perforating branch of the profunda, the sciatic, and internal circumflex arteries. These branches will usually be found a little below the great trochanter. (iii) The descending' branches run directly downwards along with the nerve to the vastus externus muscle. They lie beneath the rectus muscle and on the crureus or vastus externus, some of them being just under cover of the anterior edge of the latter muscle. They are distributed to the vastus externus, crureus, and rectus, one branch usually running along the anterior border of the vastus externus as far as the knee joint, where it anastomoses with the superior external articular branch of the popliteal (fig. 376); another, entering the crureus, anasto- moses with the lower perforating branch of the profunda and with the anastomotica magna. Variations of the external circumflex.—(A) It may come off from the femoral above the profimda. (B) It may be double, one branch coming off from the femoral, and one from the profunda, or both from the j)rofunda, or both from the femoral above the profunda. [h] The internal circumflex artery comes off from the back and inner part of the profunda artery on about the same level as the external circumflex ; sometimes as a common trunk with that vessel. As it winds round the inner side of the femur to reach the region of the trochanters, it lies successively, first, between the psoas and pectineus, then between the obturator externus and adductor brevis; finally, between the adductor magnus and quadratus femoris, where it anastomoses with the external circumflex externally, with the sciatic above, and with the superior per- forating below, forming the so-called crucial anastomosis. As it passes between the obturator externus and adductor brevis, it gives off two or more branches to the adductor longus, the adductor brevis, the gracilis, and the obturator externus, and anastomoses with the obturator artery. Another small branch usually courses upwards and outwards beneath the tendon of the psoas, and enters the hip joint beneath the transverse ligament, and, together with the articular branch of the obturator, supplies the fatty tissue in the acetabulum, and sends branches to the synovial membrane. As it lies beneath the adductor brevis, it gives off a descendingTHE ARTERIES 620 branch to the adductor magnus and brevis. This branch is generally accompanied by the posterior division of the obturator nerve. Before passing between the quadratus femoris and adductor magnus, a small branch runs upwards beneath the quadratus femoris to supply the back of the hip joint, and anastomoses with the gluteal and sciatic arteries. Its companion veins join the profunda vein. Variations of the internal circumflex.—(A) It may come off from the profimda artery before the external circumflex. (B) It may arise from the femoral artery ; or (C) from the external iliac or one of its branches. (c) The perforating arteries of the profunda are so called because they perforate, in a more or less regular manner from above downwards, certain of the adductor muscles. They form a series of loops by anastomosing with one another (fig. 373), and with the gluteal, internal circumflex, and sciatic arteries above, and with the muscular and articular branches of the popliteal below. They are distributed chiefly to the hamstring muscles, but send twigs along the external j intermuscular septum to supply the integuments at the back and outer parts of the thigh. Other branches perforate the external intermuscular septum and ' the short head of the biceps, and, entering the crureus and vastus externus, anastomose with the descending branch of the external circumflex. All the per- forating arteries, moreover, contribute to reinforce the artery of the sciatic nerve, a branch of the sciatic artery. They are each accompanied by tw^o veins which terminate in the profunda. j (i) The superior or first perforating is given off from the profunda as that i vessel sinks beneath the adductor longus. It either pierces the adductor brevis, \ or else runs between the pectineus and adductor brevis, and then passes through a small aponeurotic opening in the adductor magnus close to the inner lip of the linea aspera. In this course it supplies branches to the adductors, and, after perforating the adductor magnus, is distributed to the lower part of the gluteus \ maximus and the hamstring muscles, one branch commonly running upwards ' beneath the gluteus maximus to anastomose with the external circumflex, internal | circumflex, and sciatic arteries, forming the crucial anastomosis at the junction of \ the neck of the femur with the great trochanter (fig. 373). A second branch descends | to anastomose with the ascending branch of the middle perforating. I (ii) The middle or second perforating, which is given off from the profunda as it lies behind the adductor longus, pierces the adductor brevis, and then passes j through a second aponeurotic opening in the adductor magnus a little below that for the first perforating artery, and also close to the linea aspera. It supplies the hamstring muscles, sends a branch upwards to anastomose with the descending branch of the superior perforating, and another downwards to anastomose in like manner with the ascending branch of the third perforating. It usually supplies the chief nutrient branch to the femur. At times, however, this comes : from the third perforating. (iii) The inferior or third perforating also arises from the profunda as it Hes under the adductor longus, usually about the level of the lower border of the adductor | brevis. It turns beneath this border, and then, like the first and second perforating, j passes through an aponeurotic opening in the adductor magnus close to the linea j aspera. It also supplies the hamstring muscles, and divides into two branches, i which anastomose above with the second perforating, and below with the termination ! of the profunda or the fourth perforating. \ (iv) The fourth perforating is the continuation of the profunda. It passes j through an aponeurotic opening in the adductor magnus just above the opening | for the femoral artery. It anastomoses, above with the third perforating, and below with the superior muscular and articular branches of the popliteal. It supplies | chiefly the short head of the biceps. ,621 POPLITEAL B. Branches of the Sui^erficial Femoral in Scarpa's Triangle The branches given off by the superficial femoral in Scarpa's triangle are usually small and insignificant. They are:—(1) Muscular, to the sartorius and rectus ; and (2) saphenous, to the region of the long saphenous vein and femoral lymphatics in the neighbourhood of the vein. C. Branches of the Superficial Femoral in Hunter's Canal The branches in Hunter's canal are :—(1) Muscular ; and (2) the anastomotica magna. \ (1) The muscular branches supply the sartorius, the rectus, the vastus internus, the crureus, and the adductor muscles. They are usually larger than the muscular branches given off in Scarpa's triangle. (2) The anastomotica magna arises from the front and inner side of the femoral just before the latter perforates the adductor magnus muscle, and almost immedi- ately divides into two branches, {a) a superficial and (h) a deep. These branches may sometimes come off separately from the femoral. [ft) The superficial branch pierces the aponeurotic covering of Hunter's canal, passes between the sartorius and gracilis muscles along with the internal saphenous I nerve, and, perforating the deep fascia, supplies the skin of the upper and inner side of the leg and anastomoses with the inferior internal articular branch of the popliteal and the other vessels forming the plexus or rete at the inner side of the knee. In its course it gives twigs to the lower part of the sartorius and gracilis muscles. 1 ih) The deep branch runs downwards in front of the adductor magnus tendon, [ burrowing amongst the fibres of the vastus internus as far as the internal condyle, I where it passes into the plexus or rete on the inner side of the knee joint, \ anastomosing with the internal inferior articular banch of the popliteal, the anterior tibial recurrent, and the external superior articular branch of the popliteal across the front of the femur just above the articular surface of the knee joint. In common with the rest of the rete it sends branches into the knee joint. It also supplies branches to the vastus internus and crureus muscles. THE POPLITEAL ARTEKY The popliteal artery (fig. 375) runs through the popliteal space or ham. It is a continuation of the femoral, and extends from the aponeurotic opening in the ! adductor magnus at the junction of the middle with the lower third of the thigh ! to the lower border of the popliteus muscle, where it terminates by dividing into the posterior and anterior tibial arteries. This division is on a level with the lower . border of the tubercle of the tibia. As the artery passes through the opening in the adductor magnus, it is accompanied by the popliteal vein, and at times [ by the branch of the obturator nerve to the knee joint. The vein throughout i is behind the artery, at first lying a little external to it, but as the vessels pass through the popliteal space the vein crosses obliquely over the artery, and at the termination of the artery lies a little to its inner side. The internal popliteal nerve is superficial to both artery and vein. As it enters the space it is well to the i outer side of the vessels, but as it descends it gradually approaches them, crosses behind them, and at the lower part of the space lies to their inner side. The I artery in the whole of its course is deeply placed and covered by a considerable I amount of fat and cellular tissue. ! Relations (fig. 374).—In front, the artery hes successively on the popliteal surface of the femur (from which it is separated by a httle fat and sometimes one or two small glands); on the posterior Hgament of the knee; on the hinder edge of the I . -622 THE ARTERIES Superior external articular artery POPLITEAL NERVE- External lateral ligament Inferior external articular artery ■ Muscular branch to nolens.

From the latter muscle it is separated by the expansion from the semi-membranosus which covers the muscle, and is attached to the oblique line on the tibia. Fig. 374.—Relations of the Popliteal Artery to Bones and Muscles. Behind, the artery is covered, above by the semi-membranosus ; in the centre of : the space by the skin, superficial and deep fascia ; and below by the inner head of the j623 POPLITEAL ; gastrocnemius. The popliteal vein is behind it in the whole of its course. The I internal popliteal nerves cross behind it obliquely from without inwards, about the i centre of the space. As the artery divides into the anterior and posterior tibial, it is crossed by the aponeurotic arch of the soleus which stretches between the tibial and fibular origins of that muscle. j To the inner side are the semi-membranosus above, and the inner head of the I gastrocnemius and the internal popliteal nerve below. To the outer side are the biceps and the internal popliteal nerve above, and the outer head of the gastrocnemius and the plantaris below. Fig. 375.—Side View of the Popliteal Artery. Principal variations in the popliteal.—(A) It may divide higher, or more rarely lower than usual. (B) It may divide into the anterior tibial and peroneal. (C) The vein may [be deeper than the artery, or separated from it by a slip of the gastrocnemius. j Branches of the Popliteal Aeteey The branches of the popliteal may be divided into—(1) The cutaneous ; (2) the muscular or sural; (3) the articular ; and (4) the terminal.THE ABTEBIES 624 (1) The cutaneous branches—very h'regular in then- origin, number, and dis- tribution—arise either from the main trunk or from one of the inferior muscular branches, pass downwards between the tAvo heads of the gastrocnemius, and, per- forating the deep fascia, supply the skin and fascia of the calf. A branch, usually j of moderate size, accompanies the short or external saphenous vein, and is | sometimes called the posterior saphenous artery. j (2) The muscular or sural branches are commonly divided into the superior | and inferior. They arise from the upper and lower portions of the popliteal i respectively; the former supply the muscles forming the boundaries of the upper j half of the popliteal space ; the latter, the muscles of the calf. I {a) The upper muscular branches—or superior sural, as they are sometimes | called—are distributed to the hamstring muscles and lower part of the adductor i magnus. They anastomose with the superior articular arteries, and with the termination of the profunda, {h) The inferior muscular or sural branches, usually two in number and of large size, come off from the popliteal just as it passes under cover of the inner head of the gastrocnemius. They at first descend between the two heads of the latter muscle, one branch then entering the outer, and one the I inner head. They also supply branches to the soleus and plantaris muscles. ' (3) The articular, five in number, are divided into two superior (internal and j external), two inferior (internal and external), and the azygos, or'anterior. The | superior and inferior come off transversely in pairs from either side of the i popliteal, the superior above, the inferior below the joint, and, winding round the bones to the front of the knee, form—by anastomosing with each other and with ! the anastomotica magna, the termination of the profunda, the descending branch of j the external circumflex, and the anterior tibial recurrent—a superficial and deep j 1 arterial rete (fig. 376). The superficial anastomosis or retelies between the skin and i J fascia round about the patella (patellar rete), which it supplies, the larger branches i ( entering it from above. The deep anastomosis or rete lies on the surface of the ' bones around the articular surfaces of the femur and tibia, supplying branches to the contiguous bones and to the joints. The azygos articular is a single short trunk coming off from the deep surface of the popliteal artery. It at once passes through the posterior ligament into the joint. {a) The superior external articular, the larger of the two superior articular branches, runs transversely outwards under the external head of the gastrocnemius, j and, passing beneath the biceps and through the external intermuscular septum and i 4 vastus externus, enters the substance of the crureus, and anastomoses, above with I * the descending branch of the external circumflex, below with the inferior external | articular, and across the front of the femur with the superior internal articular, I the anastomotica magna, and termination of the profunda, forming with them, as \ already described, the deep periarticular rete. Branches are given off to the patella, to : the upper and outer part of the joint, to the bone, and to the contiguous muscles. ih) The superior internal articular (fig. 374) runs transversely inwards just above the inner head of the gastrocnemius, beneath the semi-membranosus, and, after perforating the tendon of the adductor magnus, enters the substance of the vastus internus, where it anastomoses (fig. 376) with the deep branch of the anastomotica magna and termination of the profunda above, with the inferior internal articular j below, and with the superior external articular across the front of the femur. It; I supplies small branches to the contiguous muscles, to the femur, to the patella,! I and to the joint. i (c) The inferior internal articular, the larger of the two inferior articular arteries, passes obliquely downwards and inwards across the popliteus, below the, internal tuberosity of the tibia, and beneath the internal lateral ligament to the front and inner side of the knee joint, where it anastomoses (fig. 376), above with | the superior internal articular and the superficial branch of the anastomotica magna, jBBANGHES OF POPLITEAL 625 and across the front of the tibia with the inferior external articular. It supplies branches to the lower and inner part of the joint. {d) The inferior external articular (fig. 376) passes outwards above the head of the fibula, along the tendon of the popliteus muscle, beneath the external head of the gastrocnemius, and then under the tendon of the biceps, and between the long and short external lateral ligaments. Then winding to the front of the joint, it anasto- moses above with the superior external articular, below with the anterior tibial recurrent, and across the front of the tibia Avith the internal inferior articular. It also supplies branches to the outer and lower part of the joint. Fig. 376.—The Anastomosis about the Knee Joint. (S emi - diagrammatic.) ■Descending branch of external circumflex artery 'Superior external articular artery passing through external inter- muscular septum EXTERNAL CONDYLE -Long external lateral ligament Inferior external articular artery Anterior tibial recurrent artery .Anterior tibial artery (e) The azygos articular arises from the deep surface of the popliteal artery, and passes, with the articular branch of the obturator nerve, through the posterior hgament, directly into the knee joint, where it supplies the crucial ligaments, and the hgamenta mucosa and alaria. It anastomoses with the intrinsic branches of the other articular arteries. (4) The terminal branches of the popliteal are the posterior and anterior tibial arteries. The former appears to be a direct continuation of the vessel, and passes down the back of the leg to the inner ankle, where, on entering the sole of the foot, it divides into the internal and external plantar. The anterior tibial turns forwards, and, passing through the interosseous membrane, descends along the front of the leg, and ends, under the name of the dorsal artery of the foot, by anastomosing, through the first interosseous space, with the external plantar artery in the sole.THE ABTEBIES 626 THE POSTEEIOR TIBIAL ARTEEY The posterior tibial artery (fig. 377), the larger of the two branches into which the popliteal divides at the lower border of the popliteus muscle, runs downwards on the flexor aspect of the leg between the superficial and deep muscles to the back of the inner ankle, where, midway between the tip of the internal malleolus and os Fig. 377.—The Popliteal, the Posteeior Tibial, and the Peroneal Artery.

The artery is first situated midway between the tibia and fibula, and is deeply placed beneath the muscles of the calf. As it passes downwards it inclines inwards, and at the lower third of the leg is superficial, being only covered by the skin andPOSTEBIOB TIBIAL 627 fasciae. At the ankle it lies beneath the internal annular ligament, and at its bifur- cation also beneath the abductor hallucis. A line drawn from the centre of the popliteal space to a spot midway between the internal malleolus and point of the heel will indicate its course. Eelations.—Anteriorly, from above downwards, it lies successively on the tibialis posticus, the flexor longus digitorum, the posterior surface of the tibia, and the i internal lateral ligament of the ankle joint. Posteriorly, it is covered by the skin and fascia, the gastrocnemius and soleus, and the deep or intermuscular fascia of the leg, by which it is tightly bound down to the underlying muscles. It is crossed by the posterior tibial nerve about an inch and a half below its origin and after it has given off its peroneal branch, the nerve first being on the inner, and for the rest of its course on the outer side of the vessel (fig. 374). It is accompanied by two veins, which send numerous anasto- mosing branches across it. In the lower third of the leg the artery is superficial, being only covered by the skin and by the superficial and deep fasciae. I At the inner ankle it lies beneath the internal annular ligament and abductor 1 hallucis upon the internal lateral ligament of the ankle joint. Here it has the tibialis posticus and flexor longus digitorum in front of it, and the posterior tibial nerve and the flexor longus hallucis behind and to its outer side. At times the posterior tibial nerve divides higher than usual, when one branch ! lies on the inner side of the artery, and the other branch on the outer side. The branches of the posterior tibial artery are :—(1) The peroneal; (2) the I muscular ; (3) the medullary ; (4) the cutaneous ; (5) the communicating ; (6) the j malleolar; (7) the calcanean, or internal calcanean; and (8) the terminal, i.e. the external and internal plantar arteries. (1) The peroneal artery (figs. 374, 377) arises from the posterior tibial about one i inch below the lower border of the popliteus muscle. At first forming a gentle I curve with the convexity outwards, it approaches the fibula, and continues its course downwards close to that bone as far as the lower end of the interosseous membrane, where it gives off a large branch, the anterior peroneal, and then, passing over the back of the inferior tibio-fibular joint, terminates by breaking up into a network, which is distributed over the back of the external malleolus and outer surface of the calcaneum (fig. 381). It is accompanied by two venae comites. Relations.—At its upper part it is deeply placed between the tibialis posticus and soleus muscles, and beneath the deep or intermuscular fascia. For the rest of I its course to the ankle it lies beneath, or sometimes in the substance of the flexor longus hallucis in the angle between the fibula and interosseous membrane. After giving off the anterior peroneal, it is only covered, as it lies behind the tibio-fibular articulation, by the integuments and deep fascia, and in this part of its course is sometimes called the posterior peroneal. The branches of the peroneal artery are :—(a) The anterior peroneal; (b) the muscular; (c) the medullary; (d) the communicating; (e) the cutaneous; (/) the j external calcanean ; and (g) the terminal. (a) The anterior peroneal artery arises from the front of the peroneal artery at the lower part of the interosseous space, and, passing through the interosseous membrane, runs downwards over the front of the inferior tibio-fibular joint, beneath the peroneus tertius, and supplies this muscle and the inferior tibio-fibular joint. It anastomoses with the tarsal, metatarsal, and external malleolar branches of the anterior tibial artery, and with the external plantar artery on the outer side of the foot, forming a plexus over the outer ankle (fig. 380). (b) The muscular branches of the peroneal artery are distributed to the con- tiguous muscles, namely: the flexor longus hallucis, the tibialis posticus, the [peronei, and the soleus. (c) The medullary enters the nutrient foramen of the fibula. s s 2 i628 THE ARTERIES (ciy The communicating^ branches pass transversely inwards in front of the tendo Achillis to anastomose with the communicating branch of the posterior tibial. The usual situation of this communication is from one to two inches above the ankle joint. (e) The cutaneous branches run outwards-between the flexor longus hallucis and soleus to supply the integuments on the outer side of the leg. (/) The external calcanean comes ofi' from the peroneal below the point at which the anterior peroneal is given off, and is distributed over the outer surface of the OS calcis. (g) The terminal branch, or posterior peroneal, the continuation of the peroneal artery, anastomoses with the other arteries distributed to the external malleolus and heel. (2) The muscular branches of the posterior tibial artery are distributed to the contiguous muscles, namely: the tibialis posticus, flexor longus digitorum, and soleus. (3) The medullary artery, a vessel of large size, leaves the posterior tibial at its upper part, pierces the tibialis posticus, and enters the medullary foramen in the upper third of the posterior surface of the tibia. In the interior of the bone it divides into two branches: an ascending or smaller, which runs upwards towards the head of the bone ; and a descending or larger, which courses downwards towards the lower end. It gives off two or three muscular twigs to the tibialis posticus before it enters the foramen. The medullary artery of the tibia is the largest nutrient artery of bone in the body. (4) The cutaneous branches pass outwards to the integuments on the inner side of the leg. They run in the cellular planes between the deep and superficial muscles, and serve as useful guides to the vessel when ligaturing the posterior tibial through the lateral incision. (5) The communicating branch arises from the posterior tibial about two inches above the inner malleolus, and, passing transversely outwards across the j tibia beneath the flexor longus hallucis and tendo Achillis, anastomoses with the | communicating branch of the peroneal. ' Frequently an inferior communicating brpouch between the posterior tibial and peroneal arteries is likewise present in the loose connective tissue beneath or I behind the tendo Achillis (fig. 374). | (6) The malleolar or internal malleolar branches are distributed, as the name implies, over the internal malleolus, anastomosing with the other arteries entering into the retiform plexus of vessels over that portion of bone. In their course to ' the malleolus, they run beneath the flexor longus digitorum and tibialis posticus muscles. (7) The calcanean or internal calcanean branch is distributed to the soft parts over the inner side of the calcaneum. This branch—or, as is frequently the case, branches—comes off from the posterior tibial just before its bifurcation, and anasto- moses with the internal malleolar and peroneal arteries (fig. 379). (8) The terminal branches are the external and internal plantar arteries. THE EXTEENAL PLANTAR ARTERY The external plantar artery—the larger of the two branches into which the posterior tibial divides beneath the internal annular ligament—passes at firsi j obliquely forwards and outwards across the sole of the foot to the base of the fiftt j metatarsal bone, where it makes a bend forwards and inwards, and, sinking deepl}! ^ into the foot, terminates at the proximal end of the first interosseous space b} j anastomosing with the communicating branch of the dorsal artery of the foot. In itil 1 course to the fifth metatarsal bone the artery runs in a more or less straight lin( j ^EXTEBNAL PLANTAB 629 obliquely across the foot; whilst its deep portion, extending from the fifth metatarsal bone to the proximal end of the first interosseous space, forms a slight curve with the convexity forwards, and is known as the plantar arch. The plantar arch is comparable to the deep palmar arch formed by the deep branch of the ulnar anastomosing with the radial through'the first interosseous space. This homology is at times more complete in that the communicating branch of the dorsalis pedis, the homologue of the radial in the upper limb, takes the chief share in forming the arch. The external plantar artery is accompanied by two veins. The course of Fig. 378.—The Plantar Arteries. (From a dissection in the Museum of St. Bartholomew's Hospital.)

Relations.—In the first part of its course from the inner ankle to the base of the fifth metatarsal bone, the artery is covered successively by the abductor hallucis and the flexor brevis digitorum, by which it is separated from the plantar fascia, and may be slightly overlapped in muscular subjects by the abductor minimi digiti. As it approaches the base of the fifth metatarsal bone, it lies, as it turns forwards630 THE ABTEBIES and inwards before sinking into the foot, in the interspace between the flexor brevis digitorum and the abductor minimi digiti, and is here only covered by the skin and superficial fascia, and the plantar fascia. It lies upon the calcaneum, the flexor accessorius, and the flexor brevis minimi digiti. It is accompanied by the external plantar nerve, the smaller of the two divisions into which the posterior tibial nerve divides. In this part of its course it gives off small branches to the contiguous muscles and to the heel. In the second part of its course the artery, which is here known as the plantar arch, sinks into the sole, and is covered, in addition to the skin, superficial fascia, plantar fascia, and flexor brevis digitorum, by the tendon of the flexor longus digitorum, the lumbricales, branches of the internal plantar nerve, and the adductor hallucis. It lies upon the proximal ends of the second, third, and fourth metatarsal bones and the corresponding interosseous muscles. The branches of the external plantar artery are :—(1) Muscular ; (2) calcaneal; (3) cutaneous; (4) anastomotic; (5) articular ; (6) posterior perforating; and (7) digital. (1) The muscular branches of the external plantar are distributed to the contiguous muscles; in the first part of its course to the flexor brevis digitorum, and the accessorius ; as it makes its bend into the sole, to the muscles of the little toe ; and, as it forms the plantar arch, to the interossei, flexor brevis hallucis, and adductor hallucis. (2) The calcanean are two or three small branches which are distributed over the inner surface of the calcaneum, and anastomose with the internal calcanean branch of the posterior tibial artery (fig. 379). (3) The cutaneous pass between the abductor minimi digiti and flexor brevis digitorum, and through the interval between the middle and outer portions of the plantar fascia, to the skin. (4) The anastomotic turn over the outer border of the foot, and anastomose with the tarsal and metatarsal branches of the dorsalis pedis (fig. 381). (5) The articular come oft* from the concavity of the arch, and, running back- wards and upw^ards, are distributed to the articulations of the tarsus. They are homologous to the recurrent branches of the deep palmar arch in the hand, and, like the latter, are usually three in number. (6) The posterior perforating", also three in number, ascend through the proximal end of the second, third, and fourth spaces, between the two heads of origin of the correspondingly named dorsal interosseous muscles, and communicate with the proximal ends of the first, second, and third interosseous arteries (fig. 381). (7) The digital or plantar digital arteries are usually four in number, and are distributed to the inner and outer sides of the third, fourth, and fifth toes, and to the outer side of the second toe. They are named first, second, third, and fourth as they come oft' from the arch from without inwards, and not according to the interosseous space in which they run. The first comes off from the outermost part of the plantar arch, and courses forwards along the outer side of the little toe (figs. 378, 379, 381), over the fifth metatarsal bone and the abductor and flexor brevis minimi digiti muscles. The second, third, and fourth digitals run forward in the centre of the interosseous spaces on the therein contained interosseous muscles, under cover of the contiguous lumbrical, the short and long flexor tendons, and the transversalis pedis muscle. Near the cleft of the toes they become superficial, and bifurcate for the supply of the contiguous sides of the toes : the second supplying the inner side of the fifth and the outer side of the fourth toe; the third the inner side of the fourth and the outer side of the third toe ; and the fourth the inner side of the third and the outer side of the second toe. The supply of the inner side of the second and both sides of the great toe is derived from the dorsalis pedis through its communicating branch to the plantarEXTEBNAL AND INTEBNAL PLANTAB 631 arch. The digital arteries, immediately before they bifmxate, send upwards on to the dorsum of the foot a communicating branch (the anterior perforating artery) to the corresponding dorsal interosseous arteries. On the side of the toes the digital arteries—here sometimes called the collateral digital arteries—furnish numerous small branches to the integuments and the flexor tendons and their sheaths. They anastomose by many small twigs with the dorsal interosseous arteries, which also run along the sides of the toes, but more towards the dorsal aspect. Immediately above each phalangeal joint the collateral digital vessels communicate by cross branches, forming a rete for the supply of the articular end Fig. 379.—Plantar Arteries (Deep).

At the distal end of the toes they also freely anastomose with each other, forming a rete beneath the pulp and around the matrix of the nail. The digital arteries are each accompanied by two small veins. THE INTEENAL PLANTAR ARTERY The internal plantar artery (figs. 878, 379)—the smaller of the two divisions into which the posterior tibial divides at the inner ankle—passes forwards along the inner side of the sole of the foot usually to the first interosseous space, where it ends by632 THE ABTERIES anastomosing either with the fifth plantar digital artery (princeps hallucis) derived I from the communicating branch of the dorsalis pedis, or with the branch given off | by the fifth plantar digital to the inner side of the great toe (figs. 378, 379). | Relations.—The artery is at first under cover of the abductor hallucis, but afterwards lies in the interval between that muscle and the flexor brevis digitorum. It is covered by the skin and superficial fascia, but not by the plantar fascia, since it lies between the middle and inner portions of that structure. The branches of the internal plantar are small and irregular in their origin, i course, and distribution. The following are described :— \ (1) The muscular branches supply the abductor hallucis, and flexor brevis ' digitorum. i (2) The cutaneous branches supply the skin over the course of the vessel. 1 (3) The articular sink deeply into the sole, and supply the articulations on the : inner side of the foot, and anastomose with branches of the external plantar artery, i (4) The anastomotic run beneath the abductor hallucis and round the inner side . of the foot, to anastomose with the internal tarsal branch of the dorsalis pedis. (5) The superficial digital are very small twigs which accompany the digital ' branches of the internal plantar nerves, and anastomose with the plantar digital arteries in the first, second, and third spaces. At times a twig from one of these branches joins the external plantar artery to form a superficial plantar arch. ; THE ANTERIOK TIBIAL ARTERY The anterior tibial artery (fig. 380)—the smaller of the two branches into which the popliteal artery divides at the lower border of the popliteus muscle—at first courses forwards between the two heads of origin of the tibialis posticus, and, after passing between the tibia and fibula through an aperture in the upper part of the interosseous membrane, runs downwards on the front and outer aspect of the leg, \ between the anterior muscles, as far as the front of the ankle joint (fig. 380). Below this spot it is known as the dorsalis pedis. The course of the vessel is indicated by a line drawn from the front of the head of the fibula to a point midway between j the two malleoli. | The artery is accompanied by two veins which communicate with each other at frequent intervals across it. It is also accompanied in the lower three-fourths of its course by the anterior tibial nerve. The nerve, which winds round the head of the fibula, and pierces the extensor longus digitorum, first comes into contact with the outer side of the artery somewhere about the upper third of the leg ; then, in the middle third of the leg, it gets a little in front of the artery, and in the lower third again lies to its outer side. Relations.—The artery at first lies in the triangle formed by the two heads of the tibialis posticus and the popliteus muscle ; and, as it passes through the hole in \ the interosseous membrane, it has the tibia on one side and the fibula on the other. Posteriorly in its course down the leg it lies in its upper two-thirds upon the interosseous membrane, to which it is closely bound by fibrous bands; and in its lower third upon the front of the tibia and the ankle joint. To its inner side along its upper two-thirds is the tibialis anticus muscle ; but at the lower third it is crossed by the tendon of the extensor proprius hallucis, and then for the rest of its course has this tendon overlapping it or to its inner side. On its outer side it is in contact in its upper third with the extensor longus digitorum muscle; in its middle third with the extensor proprius hallucis ; but, as this muscle crosses to the inner side of the artery, the vessel usually for a very short \ part of its course comes again into contact with the extensor longus digitorum. ( In front the artery is covered by the skin, superficial and deep fascia. In its633 ANTEBIOB TIBIAL upper two-thirds it is deeply placed in the cellular interval between the tibialis anticus on the inner side, and the extensor longus digitorum and extensor proprius Fig. 380.—The Anterior Tibiai^ Artery, Dorsal Artery of the Foot, and Anterior Peroneal Artery, and their Branches.

The anterior tibial nerve is usually in front of the artery in the middle third of the leg. The branches of the anterior tibial artery are :—(1) The posterior tibial recurrent; (2) the anterior tibial recurrent; (3) the muscular; (4) the internal malleolar ; and (5) the external malleolar. (1) The posterior tibial recurrent is occasionally absent. It ascends between the popliteus muscle and the posterior ligament of the knee joint supplying these structures and the superior tibio-fibular joint. It anastomoses with the inferior external articular branch of the popliteal, and to a less extent with the inferior internal articular branch. (2) The anterior tibial recurrent is given off from the anterior tibial artery immediately after that vessel has passed through the interosseous membrane. It winds tortuously through the substance of the tibialis anticus muscle, over the outer tuberosity of the tibia close to the bone ; and, perforating the deep fascia, ramifies on the lower and outer part of the capsule of the knee joint. It anastomoses with the inferior and superior external articular branches of the popliteal, with the descending branch of the external circumflex, and somewhat less freely with the internal articular branches of the popliteal and with the anastomotica magna. It gives oft" small branches to the tibialis anticus, the flexor longus digitorum, the knee joint, and the contiguous fascia and skin. It forms one of the collateral channels by which the blood is carried to the limb below in obstruction of the popliteal artery (fig. 376). (3) The muscular branches, some ten or twelve in number, arise irregularly from either side of the artery as it courses down the limb, and supply the contiguous muscles. (4) The internal malleolar, the smaller of the two malleolar branches, arises from the lower part of the anterior tibial artery a little higher than the external, usually about the spot where the tendon of the extensor longus hallucis crosses the anterior tibial artery. It winds inwards over the internal malleolus, passing beneath the tibialis anticus, and forms an internal malleolar plexus or rete about the inner ankle over the lower end of the tibia by anastomosing with branches from the posterior tibial, internal plantar, and internal calcanean arteries. (5) The external malleolar, larger than the internal, arises from the outer side of the anterior tibial artery, usually on a lower level than the internal malleolar. It wdnds in an outw^ard and downward direction round the external malleolus, passing beneath the extensor longus digitorum and peroneus tertius, and forms the external malleolar plexus or rete by anastomosing with the anterior peroneal, the termination of the peroneal, the external plantar, and the external tarsal branch of the dorsalis pedis (fig. 381). The anastomosis between the external malleolar and anterior peroneal is some- times of considerable size, supplying the blood to the dorsal artery of the foot; the anterior tibial, then much reduced in size, usually ends at the spot where the external malleolar is usually given off. THE DORSALIS PEDIS ARTERY The dorsalis pedis artery is a continuation of the anterior tibial. It extends from the front of the ankle joint to the proximal end of the first interosseous space where it dips into the sole to join the external plantar artery and complete the plantar arch. The course of the artery is indicated by a line drawn from a point midway between the two malleoli to the proximal end of the first metatarsal space. Relations.—Behind, the artery from above downwards lies successively on the astragalus, scaphoid, and internal cuneiform bones, and the ligaments uniting theFig. 381.—Diagram of the Distribution and Anastomoses of the Arteries of the Foot.

As it sinks into the sole, under the name of the communicating artery, it lies between the two heads of origin of the first dorsal interosseous muscle. At times it takes a course a little more outwards, then lying either partly on the middle cuneiform bone, or on the dorsal ligaments uniting the middle cuneiform to the internal cuneiform. It is more or less bound down to the bones by aponeurotic fibres derived from the deep fascia. In front, the artery is covered by the anterior annular ligament, sometimes by the extensor longus hallucis, by the skin, the superficial and deep fascia, and, just before it sinks into the sole, by the innermost tendon of the extensor brevis digitorum. The angle formed by this tendon with the extensor longus hallucis is the best guide to finding the artery in the process of ligature (fig. 380). To its outer side is the innermost tendon of the extensor longus digitorum, and lower down the innermost tendon of the extensor brevis digitorum. The anterior tibial nerve is also to its outer side, as is also the outermost of its venae comites. To its inner side is the extensor longus hallucis, except at times for about half an inch below, where the innermost tendon of the extensor brevis digitorum, having crossed the artery, may lie between it and this tendon. The innermost of the venae comites is also to the inner side. Branches between the ven^e comites at intervals cross the vessel. The branches of the dorsalis pedis artery are:—(1) The tarsal; (2) the meta- tarsal ; (3) the dorsalis hallucis ; and (4) the communicating, or plantar digital. (1) The tarsal branches may be divided into (a) the external, and {h) the internal, {a) The internal tarsal consists of a few small branches which run over the inner side of the foot, supplying the skin and articulations, and anastomose with the internal malleolar, [h) The external tarsal runs outwards over the scaphoid and cuboid bones, beneath the extensor brevis digitorum. It supplies branches to that muscle, and to the bones and the articulations between them, and anastomoses above with the external malleolar and anterior peroneal, below with the metatarsal, and externally over the outer border of the foot with the anastomotic branches of the external plantar artery. (2) The metatarsal artery (figs. 380, 381) runs outwards across the foot, in a slight curve with the convexity forwards, over the heads of the metatarsal bones, and beneath the extensor tendons and the extensor brevis digitorum. At the outer border of the foot it anastomoses, above with the external tarsal, and externally with the anasto- motic branches of the external plantar. From the convexity of the arch it gives off three dorsal interosseous arteries, which run forwards on the dorsal interosseous muscles in the centre of the second, third, and fourth interosseous spaces to the cleft of the toes, where they bifurcate for the supply of the contiguous sides of the second and third toes, the third and fourth toes, and the fourth and fifth toes. The outermost of the interosseous branches gives off a small vessel for the supply of the outer side of the little toe. At the proximal end of the second, third, and fourth interosseous spaces each artery receives a branch of communication from the external plantar artery (posterior perforating), and immediately before they bifurcate a second communicating artery through the distal end of the interosseous space from the corresponding digital vessel (anterior perforating artery). The little dorsal digital vessels, into which the dorsal interosseous arteries divide at the cleft of the toes, run along the side of each toe towards the dorsal aspect, anastomosing with each other across the dorsum of the toes and by frequent branches with the collateral digital branches of the digital arteries, which also run along the side of the toes, but nearer the plantar surface. At the end of the toes they anastomose with each other around the quick of the nail. (3) The dorsalis hallucis—or first dorsal interosseous artery, as it is sometimes called—is the apparent continuation of the dorsalis pedis. Like the other dorsal interossei, it passes forward, in the centre of the first interosseous space, on the first637 DOBSALIS PEDIS dorsal interosseous muscle. At the cleft of the toes it divides into two dorsal digital branches—the one for the supply of the outer side of the great toe, the other for the inner side of the second toe. Before its bifurcation the dorsalis hallucis gives off a small branch, which runs inwards, under the extensor longus hallucis, for the supply of the inner side of the great toe ; but this branch is sometimes absent. At the front of the space, immediately before its bifurcation, the dorsalis hallucis communicates with the fifth plantar digital artery, or princeps hallucis, through an anterior perforating artery (fig. 881). (4) The communicating—first interosseous perforating, or plantar digital artery, as it is variously called—comes off from the dorsalis pedis with the dorsalis hallucis (into which arteries indeed the dorsalis pedis may be said to divide). At the back of the first interosseous space it dips into the sole between the two heads of the first dorsal interosseous muscle, and communicates with the termination of the external plantar artery, completing the plantar arch, in a manner similar to that in which the radial artery, passing through the first dorsal interosseous muscle in the hand, completes by inosculating with the ulnar the deep palmar arch. At the spot where it joins the external plantar it gives off the fifth plantar digital artery, or princeps hallucis, which runs forwards in the centre of the first interosseous space to the cleft between the first and second toe, where it divides into collateral branches for the adjacent side of each. Before bifurcating, it supplies a branch to the inner side of the great toe, and receives the anterior communicating artery from the dorsalis hallucis.THE VEINS THE veins, like the arteries, are diyided into the pnhiionary and the sys- temic. The pulmonary return the aerated blood from the lungs to the left side of the heart, and are the only veins that contain arterial blood. The systemic veins bring back to the right side of the heart the impure venous blood from the rest of the body. All the systemic veins terminate ultimately either in the superior or inferior vena cava, except the cardiac veins, which return the blood from the heart's sub- stance, and open directly into the right auricle. The veins from the stomach and intestines, the spleen, and the pancreas, before opening into the inferior vena cava, are collected into a large trunk vein called the portal vein, which breaks up, like an artery, into capillaries in the substance of the liver. From these capillaries the blood is again collected by the hepatic veins, which finally open, as two or more large-sized vessels, into the inferior vena cava. The veins are described under the heads of :—1. The veins of the thorax ; 2. the veins of the head and neck; 3. the veins of the spine ; 4. the veins of the abdomen ; 5. the veins of the upper extremity; and 6. the veins of the lower extremity. 1. THE VEINS OF THE THORAX The veins of the thorax are : the pulmonary, which carry the blood from the lungs to the left side of the heart; and the superior vena cava and its tributaries, which return the venous blood from the head and neck, the upper extremities, and the walls of the thorax, to the right side of the heart. The inferior vena cava, which brings back the blood from the abdomen and pelvis and lower extremities, is described with the veins of the abdomen, in which cavity it lies throughout by far the greater part of its course, somewhat less than half an inch of its upper end only being situated in the thorax. The pulmonary veins are contained in the middle mediastinum. The superior vena cava and the right and left innominate veins course through the superior mediastinum. The azygos veins, the larger of which opens into the superior vena cava, lie on either side of the thoracic vertebra in the posterior mediastinum. They receive the intercostal, the bronchial, and the oesophageal veins. 1FULMONABY—VENA CAVA SUPEBIOB 639 THE PULMONAEY VEINS The pulmonary veins (fig. 820) return the aerated blood from the lungs to the heart. They are usually four in number, two right and two left. Occasionally, however, there are three pulmonary veins on the right side, the result of the vein from the middle lobe of the right lung opening separately into the left auricle instead of joining as usual the upper of the two right pulmonary veins. The relations of the pulmonary veins to the pulmonary arteries and bronchi in the lungs are given with the Anatomy of the Lungs. At the root of the lung the pulmonary veins on both sides are arranged as an upper and lower branch, an anterior descending branch of the bronchus passing between them. The upper vein on the right side is larger than the lower, and usually receives the vein from the middle lobe of the right hmg. The lower vein on the left side is larger than the upper. Both the upper and lower veins lie in front of the pulmonary artery and on a lower plane, and run almost horizontally inwards and forwards to the left auricle. As they pierce the pericardium they receive a reflexion from the serous layer of that membrane. Their relations within the pericardium are given with the Anatomy of the Heart. At the root of the lung their relations to the surrounding structures are similar to those of the pulmonary artery (page 495). A separate description is not required. THE VENA CAVA SUPERIOE The superior or descending vena cava (fig. 381a) carries to the heart the blood returned from the head and neck and upper extremities through the right and left innominate veins, and from the walls of the thorax, either directly through the greater azygos vein, or indirectly through the innominate veins. It is formed (fig. 381a) by the confluence of the right and left innominate veins at the lower border of the first right costal cartilage close to the sternum, and, descending from this spot in a gentle curve with its convexity to the right and in a direction slightly backwards and outwards behind the sternal end of the first and second intercostal spaces and second costal cartilage, terminates in the right auricle of the heart on a level with the third right costal cartilage in front and the seventh thoracic vertebra behind. It measures about three inches in length (7-8 cm.). A little more than its lower half (4 cm.) is contained within the pericardium, the serous layer of that membrane being reflected obliquely over it immediately below the spot where it is joined by the vena azygos major, and on a lower level than the reflexion of the pericardium on the aorta. The vena cava superior contains no valve. Kelations.—In front (fig. 322), in addition to the first and second intercostal spaces and the second costal cartilage, it is covered by the remains of the thymus gland, the interthoracic fascia, and the pericardium, and is overlapped by the right pleura and lung. Behind (fig. 324) are the vena azygos major, the right bronchus, the right pulmonary artery, and the superior right pulmonary vein ; and below, the fibrous layer of the pericardium. The serous layer is reflected over the front and sides of the vessel, but not over its posterior part. To the right side are the right lung and pleura, and the phrenic nerve. To the left side are the right innominate artery and the first or ascending portion of the arch of the aorta. Tributaries.—In addition to the right and left innominate veins and the vena azygos major, it receives small veins from the mediastinum and pericardium.THE VEINS 640 THE INNOMINATE OE BRACHIO-CEPHALIC VEINS The innominate veins return the blood from the head and neck and upper extremity. They are formed on each side by the confluence of the internal jugular and subclavian veins behind the sternal end of the clavicle. They terminate at the | lower border of the first costal cartilage on the right side by uniting to form the I superior vena cava. The innominate veins have no valves. j The right innominate vein (fig. 382) measures about one to one and a half j inch in length (2-3 cm.), and descends from its origin behind the sternal end of the I clavicle, very slightly forwards and inwards, superficial to, and to the right of, the i subclavian and innominate arteries, to its junction with the left vein behind the first costal cartilage close to the sternum. Relations.—In front (fig. 327) are the origins of the sterno-hyoid and sterno- thyroid muscles, the clavicle, the first costal cartilage, and the remains of the I thymus gland. Behind are the pleura and lung. To the right are the right pleura and lung, and the phrenic nerve. To the left (fig. 381a) are the right subclavian artery, the innominate artery, \ the right pneumogastric nerve, and the trachea. I The left innominate vein (fig. 381a) measures two and a half to three inches in j length (6-7 cm.), and extends from its origin behind the sternal end of the left clavicle obliquely across the three main branches of the arch of the aorta to unite with the right innominate vein at the lower border of the cartilage of the first rib i close to the sternum to form the vena cava superior. In this course it runs from j left to right with an inclination downwards and slightly backwards. A line drawn obliquely across the upper half of the manubrium of the sternum, from the sterno- ; clavicular articulation on the left side to the lower border of the first costal carti- lage at its junction with the sternum on the right side, will indicate its course. The left innominate vein is on a level with the top of the sternum at birth. < Relations.—In front, in addition to the manubrium of the sternum, it has the origins of the sterno-hyoid and sterno-thyroid muscles, and the remains of the thymus gland, the sternal end of the left clavicle, and the sterno-clavicular articu- i lation (figs. 328, 381a). Behind, are the three chief arteries arising from the arch of the aorta, the trachea, and the left phrenic and left pneumogastric nerves. j Below it is the transverse portion of the arch of the aorta. 1 Above it are the cervical fascia and inferior thyroid veins. j Tributaries.—In addition to the internal jugular and subclavian veins, by the j confluence of which the innominate veins are formed, each vein receives on its | upper aspect the vertebral, the deep cervical and inferior thyroid veins ; and on its i lower aspect the internal mammary vein. The left vein, moreover, is joined by the left superior intercostal, and by the thymic, mediastinal, and pericardiac veins. At the confluence of the internal jugular and subclavian veins on the right side, the right lymphatic duct opens ; on the left side the thoracic duct. The vertebral, j the deep cervical, and the inferior thyroid veins are described with the deep veins of j the head and neck (page 666). The internal mammary veins (fig. 344) are formed by the union of thei vense comites of the superior epigastric and musculo-phrenic branches of the in- ternal mammary artery. They receive in their course through the chest collateral tributaries corresponding to the branches of the internal mammary artery. Just before reaching the innominate vein they unite behind the first intercostal space to form a single trunk which opens into the innominate vein on the inner side oi the internal mammary artery. They contain many valves.INNOMINATE 641 The left superior intercostal vein—or, more correctly speaking, the lower left superior intercostal vein—-longer than the right, which is described as a tributary of the vena azygos major, receives the intercostal veins from the three or four upper left intercostal spaces except from the first space, and, ascending over the arch of the aorta, opens into the left innominate vein. It usually receives the left Fig. 381a.—The Vena Cava Superior and (From a dissection in St. Bartholomew's THE Innominate Veins. Hospital Museum.)

(See Intee- j COSTAL Veins, page 644.) ! The mediastinal, pericardiac, and thymic veins are small vessels, corresponding to the arteries of those names given off by the internal mammary. They do not, however, as a rule, join the internal mammary vein, but unite into a single trunk 1 (figs. 317, 382), which passes over the transverse part of the arch of the aorta, and opens into the lower and anterior part of the left innominate vein. T T642 THE VEINS Chief Variations in the Superior Vena Cava and Innominate Veins The variations in the vena cava and innominate veins depend upon certain abnormali- ties in the development of the great vems from the ducts of Cuvier and the primitive jugular veins, and can here receive only a brief mention. They may be classified as follows :— (1) Variations due to the Persistence of the Left Duct of Cuvier (a) The left subclavian may join the left internal jugular vem to form a trunk which is continued almost vertically downwards over the arch of the aorta in fi'ont of the root of the left lung, to open into the coronary sinus of the heart. This variety is known as the persistent left superior vena cava, and is the normal arrangement of the great anterior veins in some animals. The rudiments of this vein are fomid in Man in the so-called oblique vem of Marshall, w4iich stretches from the coronary sinus tln-ough the vestigial fold of the pericardium, and is often continued as a fine fibrous cord to the superior inter- costal vem. When the so-called left superior vena cava is present, the upper left azygos vein (the remains of the left primitive cardinal vein) may open into it by arching over the root of the left Kmg in a way similar to that in which the greater azygos (the right primitive cardinal vein) opens into the superior vena cava over the root of the right lung. The normal left innominate vein may be absent, or may be quite small or rudimentary, the result of the non-development, or only partial development, of a transverse branch (which becomes the left innominate) when the left part of the smus venosus and the left duct of Cm-ier are transformed mto the coronary sinus, the oblique vein of Marshall, and the upper portion of the left superior intercostal vem. (6) A vein may run from the left mnominate, or left superior mtercostal vein, through the vestigial fold of the pericardium to the coronary sinus, the left innominate vein being itself normal. This abnormalit}' is similar in kind, but minor in degree, to the former, described mider {a). (2) Variations due to Persistence of the Left and Supirression of the Bight Duct of Cuvier (a) The right innominate vein may cross the arch of the aorta to join a vertical left innominate vein, and thus form a left superior vena cava, the normal right superior cava being absent. The arrangement of the azygos veins imder this condition may be reversed, there being a left vena azygos major opening over the root of the left Imig into the left superior cava, and an upper and lower right azygos vein arranged after the manner of the normal left azygos vems. This arrangement of the veins may occiu" independently of any general transposition of the viscera. (6) There are many other varieties, depending upon abnormalities in the normal development of the great veins from the Guvierian ducts and from the primitive jugular and cardmal veins ; but these cannot be discussed here. THE AZYGOS VEINS \ The azygos veins (fig. 382) are thi^ee in number. They collect the blood ! returned from the eleven intercostal spaces on the right side, and from the seven or eight lower intercostal spaces on the left side. They lie on each side of the front of the bodies of the thoracic vertebrae, and establish a communication between the superior and inferior venae cavae through the ascending lumbar veins. The vena azygos major begins in the abdomen, w^here it may be looked upon as a continuation upwards of the ascending lumbar vein (page 671). It passes 1 through the aortic opening of the diaphragm, runs up through the posterior i mediastinum on the right side of the front of the bodies of the thoracic vertebrae as | high as the fom^th thoracic vertebra ; then curves forwards over the root of the right | lung, and opens into the superior vena cava immediately before the latter pierces \ the pericardium. I Relations.—(1) In the abdomen, the vena azygos major Hes to the right of ' the aorta and thoracic duct, under cover of the right crus of the diaphragm, upoi] the first, sometimes upon the second, lumbar vertebra. At this spot it receives; the right subcostal vein, and is continued below into the ascending lumbar vein: |AZYGOS 643 or, if the lower part of this vein is small, it may appear to begin in one of the lumbar veins, or in the vena cava, or Avhere the portion of the ascending lumbar vein which communicates with the renal is enlarged, in the renal vein.

In obstruction of the inferior vena cava much of the blood from the lower extremities and abdominal wall is returned by the vena azygos major and its continuation, the ascending lumbar vein, in the abdomen, to the vena cava superior. (See Ascending Lumbak Vein, page 671.) T T 2644 THE VEINS (2) At the aortic opening the vena azygos major hes to the right of the aorta and thoracic duct, between the crura of the diaphragm. (3) In the posterior mediastinum, as it courses upwards on the right side of the bodies of the thoracic vertebrae, the vena azygos major crosses in front of the lower right intercostal arteries, having on its left side the descending aorta and thoracic duct, in front the root of the right lung and lower down the pleura, and on its right side the right pleura and lung. (4) As it curls over the root of the right lung, the vena azygos major is in contact with the right bronchus, the pneumogastric nerve passing obliquely between them (fig. 324). It usually contains an imperfect pair of valves at the spot where it turns forwards from the fourth thoracic vertebra to arch over the root of the lung ; and still more imperfect valves are found at varying intervals lower down the vein. Tributaries.—(1) The vena azygos minor; (2) the vena hemiazygos acces- soria, or one or more of the left intercostal veins ; (3) the lower end of the lower j superior intercostal vein of the left side (sometimes); (4) the lower right oesophageal | veins ; (5) a few right mediastinal veins ; (6) the right bronchial vein ; (7) the lower ' right superior intercostal vein ; (8) the nine lower right intercostal veins; and i (9) the right subcostal vein. The vena azygos minor—also called the lower left azygos and vena hemiazygos j —begins in the abdomen by communicating, like the vena azygos major, with the | ascending lumbar vein of the left side. Through this vein it communicates with i the lumbar veins, the renal, and the iliac veins, and, according as one or other portion of the ascending lumbar is enlarged and other portions are diminished in size or obliterated, so may the vena azygos minor appear to begin in the vena cava inferior j or in a lumbar, the renal, or one of the iliac veins. The vena azygos minor, after j receiving the left subcostal vein, passes through the left crus of the diaphragm, and courses up the posterior mediastinum to the left of the bodies of the lower, thoracic vertebra as high as the eighth, where it turns obliquely to the right, and, crossing in front of the spinal column behind the aorta and the oesophagus, opens; into the vena azygos major. In its course it crosses over three or four of the^ lower left intercostal arteries, and is covered by the pleura. Tributaries.—(1) The lower four left intercostal veins; (2) the left subcostal vein; (3) the lower end of the third azygos vein (sometimes); (4) small letii mediastinal veins ; and (5) the lower left oesophageal veins. The vena azygos tertia (also called the upper left azygos and vena hemiazygos accessoria) varies considerably in size, position, and arrangement, and is ofter absent. It lies in the posterior mediastinum by the left side of the bodies of thJ fifth, sixth, and seventh thoracic vertebrae, and is more or less vertical in directionl It is continued above into the lower left superior intercostal vein, and below eithel joins the vena azygos minor, or passes obliquely across the sixth or seventh thoraci' vertebra to join the vena azygos major. The intercostal veins intervening betweei; it and the vena azygos minor then open directly across the spine into the ven I azygos major. It crosses the corresponding left intercostal arteries, and is covere | by the pleura. i Tributaries.—(1) The fifth, sixth, and sometimes the seventh intercostal veins j (2) the lower end of the lower left superior intercostal vein ; (3) the upper en of the vena azygos minor (sometimes); and (4) the left bronchial vein. The intercostal veins.—The intercostal veins are eleven in number on each sid j and correspond with the intercostal arteries. The last thoracic vein is here calk the subcostal, and is described separately (page 645). There is one vein to eac! intercostal artery, the vein lying above the artery whilst in the intercostal spac Each vein is joined by a dorsal tributary which runs with the dorsal branch <j the intercostal artery between the transverse process of the vertebra and the ne( i645 INTEBCOSTALS of the rib. The dorsal tributaries return the blood from the muscles of the back, and receive communicating branches from the dorsal spinal plexus and from the spinal veins through the intervertebral foramina. The intercostal veins also receive small tributaries from the bodies of the vertebrae. The termination of the inter- costal veins is different on the two sides, and is seldom alike in any two consecutive subjects. On the right side.—The first intercostal vein (the upper right superior inter- costal vein) ascends with the superior intercostal artery, a branch of the subclavian, to end either in the vertebral vein just before the latter joins the right innominate vein, or in the right innominate direct. The second intercostal vein either joins with the first, and opens with it as a common trunk into the vertebral or innominate vein, or it joins with the third or with the third and fourth to open into the vena azygos major as the latter is arching over the root of the right lung. This vein is kiown as the lower right superior intercostal vein. The fifth, sixth, seventh, eighth, ninth, tenth, and eleventh right intercostal veins join the vena azygos major. The upper of these have well-marked valves where they join the azygos vein. In the lower veins these valves are imperfect. All the intercostal veins are provided with valves in their course between the muscles. On the left side the first intercostal vein also follows the superior intercostal artery from the subclavian, and ascends to join the left vertebral or left innominate vein, and is known as the upper left superior intercostal vein. The second inter- costal vein either joins the first, and opens with it as a common trunk into the left vertebral or left innominate vein, or joins the third and fourth, as described below, to form the lower left superior intercostal vein. The third and fourth, and some- times the second, intercostal veins unite to form a single trunk, the lower left superior intercostal vein, which passes upwards across the arch of the aorta, and opens into the left innominate vein. This vein usually communicates at its lower end with the third azygos vein, but at times crosses the spine, and enters directly the vena azygos major. A fibrous cord can frequently be traced from it through the vestigial fold of the pericardium to the oblique vein of Marshall (page 642). The fifth and sixth, and sometimes the seventh, intercostal veins either end in the third azygos vein, or, if this is absent, cross the spine, and open directly into the vena azygos major. The eighth, ninth, tenth, and eleventh, and sometimes the seventh, intercostal veins join the vena azygos minor. The subcostal vein, or twelfth thoracic vein, lies beneath the last rib, and accom- panies the twelfth dorsal or subcostal artery. It receives tributaries corresponding to the branches of the subcostal artery, and opens on the right side into the vena azygos major, and on the left side into the vena azygos minor. The bronchial veins correspond to the bronchial arteries, but do not return the whole of the blood carried to the lungs by those vessels—that part which is distri- buted to the smaller bronchial tubes and the alveola being brought back by the pulmonary veins. The bronchial veins issue from the lung substance behind the structures forming the root of the lung. The right vein generally joins the vena azygos major just before the latter vein enters the superior vena cava. The left vein opens into the lower left superior intercostal vein, or into the upper left azygos vein. The bronchial veins at the root of the lung receive small tributaries from the bronchial glands, from the trachea, and from the posterior mediastinum. The oesophageal veins from the thoracic portion of the oesophagus end in part in the vena azygos major, and in part in the vena azygos minor.646 THE VEINS THE VEINS OF THE HEABT The cardiac or coronary veins return the blood from the substance of the heart. They accompany the corresponding coronary arteries, and terminate for the most part in a dilated vein known as the coronary sinus. This opens directly into the right auricle of the heart, between the bicuspid opening and the opening of the inferior vena cava. Some smaller veins from the heart's substance (ven^e minim^e cordis) open separately and directly into the right auricle at the bottom of some of the small depressions known as the foramina Thebesii. The coronary sinus is situated at the back of the heart, in the groove between the left auricle and left ventricle. It measures about an inch in length. Its Fig. 383.—The Coronary Sinus.

It receives the following tributaries: (1) The great coronary or cardiac vein, of which it appears to be the large and dilated end; (2) the posterior cardiac or posterior interventricular vein ; (3) the right auricular vein ; and (4) the oblique vein. (1) The great coronary or cardiac vein is formed by the union of {a) the ante- rior interventricular vein, which runs upwards from the apex of the heart, in the groove between the right and left ventricles, in company with the artery of that name; with {h) the left auricular vein, which returns the blood from the left auricle. The vein thus formed then runs round the left side of the heart, in the groove between the left auricle and left ventricle, and terminates in the coronary sinus at the spot where the latter is joined by the oblique vein. Its entrance into the sinusCABDIAC 647 is guarded by a double valve. It receives (c) the left marginal vein or veins, and branches from both ventricles, especially the left. The left marginal vein runs with the artery of that name over the surface of the left ventricle, along the left margin of the heart. It receives tributaries from the left ventricle, and terminates in the great coronary vein. (2) The posterior cardiac, middle cardiac, or posterior interventricular vein accompanies the posterior interventricular artery upwards, from the apex of the heart in the posterior interventricular groove. It ends in the coronary sinus, just before the termination of the latter in the right auricle. It receives tributaries from the posterior surface of both ventricles, and is guarded by a valve where it joins the coronary sinus. Two or three small veins (posterior cardiac, or smaller posterior cardiac) run upwards from the back of the left ventricle, and open into the coronary sinus by separate orifices guarded by valves. Fig. 384.—Scheme of the Coronary Veins. (3) The right auricular, right coronary, or small coronary vein, runs in the right auriculo-ventricular groove, and terminates in the coronary sinus just before the entrance of that sinus into the auricle. It is joined by the right marginal vein and by the preventricular or smaller anterior cardiac vein or veins. (4) The oblique vein—the greater part of which is often represented merely by a I delicate fibrous cord—runs across the back part of the left auricle, in the vestigial I fold of the pericardium to the coronary sinus. This vein, with the coronary sinus, I its dilated portion, represents what was the left duct of Cuvier and part of the i sinus venosus in the foetus. As stated at page 642, it is occasionally found pervious, i and may be greatly enlarged, and help to form the so-called left superior vena cava. I There is, as might be gathered from the consideration of its morphology, no valve : where the oblique vein is continued into the coronary sinus. The right marginal vein—sometimes called the anterior cardiac vein, or vein of Galen—runs over the right ventricle, along the right margin of the heart, and opens either into the right auricular vein or separately into the lower part of the rightTHE VEINS auricle. Other small veins—the smaller anterior cardiac veins (venae cordis parvse, or preventricular veins)—also track up from the anterior surface of the right ventricle, and open either into the right marginal vein or separately into the right auricle. 2. THE VEINS OF THE HEAD AND NECK The veins of the head and neck may he divided for purposes of description into the superficial, which return the hlood from the external parts of the head and neck ; and into the deep, which return the hlood from the deeper structures. The superficial may he again suhdivided, according to the region from which they carry I the hlood, into (1) The veins of the scalp and face ; and (2) the veins of the neck, i The deep veins—into which, moreover, some of the superficial open—may he | suhdivided into :—(1) The veins of the diploe ; (2) the venous sinuses ; (3) the veins of the brain ; (4) the veins of the nasal cavities ; (5) the veins of the ear ; (6) the veins of the orbit; (7) the veins of the pharynx and larynx ; and (8) the deep veins of the neck. All the veins, whether superficial or deep, sooner or later terminate in the internal jugular, the external jugular, the vertebral, or the deep cervical vein— chiefly the two former; and these veins open directly or indirectly into the innominate veins at the root of the neck, through which all the blood from the head and neck ultimately passes on its way to the heart. The external jugular vein is quite superficial; it is formed by the confluence of the veins corresponding to the upper branches of the external carotid artery, and, after receiving tributaries from the superficial parts of the neck and from the shoulder, terminates just above the clavicle in the subclavian vein. The internal jugular vein is deeply placed by the side of the common and internal carotid arteries. It begins in the jugular fossa, where it is continuous with the lateral sinus, and, after receiving tributaries corresponding to the lower branches of the external carotid artery, terminates at the root of the neck in the innominate vein. The vertebral vein accompanies the vertebral artery through the foramina in the transverse processes of the cervical vertebrae. It begins in the suboccipital triangle by the conrfluence of small veins from the deep muscles at the back of the occiput, and, after receiving tributaries from the cervical spine and deep muscles of the neck, ends in the innominate vein. The deep cervical receives the occipital vein, courses downwards amongst the deep muscles at the back of the neck, and ends in the innominate vein. THE SUPEBFICIA.L VEINS OF THE HEAD AND NECK 1. THE SUPEKFICIAL VEINS OF THE SCALP AND FACE The blood from the scalp is returned by three main channels—viz. an anterior, which passes over the forehead and face; a posterior, which descends over the occipital bone ; and a lateral, formed by the confluence of two smaller veins which descend over the parietal and temporal bones respectively—one in front, and one behind the ear. The Anteeioe Superficial Vein of the Scalp and Face The anterior vein descends near the middle line, over the frontal bone, to the inner angle of the orbit; continues its course by the side of the nose to the cheek, which it crosses obliquely, to the anterior edge of the masseter muscle, and649 VEINS OF THE SCALP AND FACE thence passes through the digastric triangle to the upper border of the hyoid bone, where it terminates in the internal jugular vein. In this course it is reinforced by numerous collateral veins, and gradually increases in size. It has, moreover, numerous communications with the deep veins. This long continuous trunk vein is variously named according to the region in which it lies. Thus, as it descends over the frontal bone it is known as the frontal vein; as it lies by the side of the nose it is called the angular vein ; whilst in the remainder of its course over the face and neck it is spoken of as the facial vein.

Soon forming a single trunk, it passes vertically downwards over the frontal bone, a short distance from the middle line and parallel to its fellow of the opposite side, to the inner canthus of the eyelids, where it takes the name of the angular vein (fig. 385). Tributaries.—In its course it receives numerous tributaries from the forehead, and communicates freely with the vein of the opposite side, across the glabella or root of the nose, by a transverse branch sometimes called the transverse nasal vein.THE VEINS Just before its termination it receives the suj^raorbital vein. The transverse nasal vein usually receives the dorsal veins of the nose. The supraorbital vein begins over the frontal eminences by intercommunications with the anterior branch of the superficial ternijoral vein. It receives tiibutaries from the forehead and eyebrow, and, running obliquely downwards and inwards, opens into the termination of the frontal vein. It communicates ^Yiih. the ophthalmic vein, and receives the frontal vein of the flijjloe as the latter vein issues from the bone at the bottom of the supraorbital notch. (2) The angular vein, the continuation of the frontal vein downwards, extends from the junction of the frontal and supraorbital veins a little below the level of the eyebrow, to the level of the lower margin of the orbit, where it becomes the facial vein. In this short course it skirts round the inner margin of the orbit, lying with the angular aitbry on the nasal process of the superior maxillar}- bone a little internal to the lachr\'mal sac. Branches j>ass from the posterior part of the angular vein into the orbit to join the ophthalmic. The angular, the facial, and the ophthalmic veins contain no valves. The blood, therefore, can pass either forward from the oj^hthalmic into the angular, or backwards through the facial and angular into the ophthalmic, and so on to the cavernous and other venous sinuses of the cranium. Hence in certain tumours in the orbit and cranium, the congestion of the angular and facial veins; and the danger in facial carbuncle and anthrax of septic thrombi sj)reafling backwards through the angular and ox^hthalrnic veins to the cranial sinuses. Tributaries.—The superior lateral nasal; and (b) the palpebral veins. (a) The superior lateral nasal veins ascend from the ala and the side of the nose to join the inner side of the angular vein ffig. 38oj. (b) The palpebral veins proceed from the upper and lower eyelids, and open into the outer side of the angirlar vein, either separately or by a common trunk. Several branches of the inferior palpebral vein open into the facial vein ffig. 38oj. (fj) The facial vein, the continuation of the angular, begins at the lower margin of the orbit, and, crossing the face obliquely downwards and outwards, passes at the anterior edge of the rnasseter muscle over the body of the lower jaw, and thence j do^^Tiwards and backwards across the digastric and superior carotid triangles to join j the internal jugular vein about the level of the hyoid bone. It runs in a more or ] less flirect line behind its corresponding arteiy, the facial, which itself pursues . a tortuous course. It usually passes beneath the zygomatic muscles and beneath the idatysrna, but above the other muscles. At the anterior edge of the masseter it joins the facial artery, Ijdng immediately posterior to it. In the neck it lies | beneath the platysrna and cer\-ical fascia, and is usually separated from the facial artery by the submaxillary gland and the stylo-hyoid, and the posterior belly of the digastricus muscles, below which it frequently receives a communicating branch from the external jugular vein. That portion of the vein from the spot where it receives the communicating branch to its termination in the internal jugular is sometimes called the common facial vein; and the communicating branch, the anterior division of the temporo-maxillary vein. fSee Tempoko-maxillary Vein, page (jrjyj.j Tributaries.—It receives on its inner side, from above downwards:—(a) The inferior lateral nasal veins; (b) the superior labial vein; (c) the inferior labial veins; (d) tlie submental vein; (e) the subrrjaxillary veins. On its outer side :—faj the inferior j-jalpebral veins ; (h) the anterior internal maxillary vein ; (c) the buccal vein ; (d) the anterior parotid vein ; (e) the masseteric vein ; and (f) the inferior palatine vein. Communications.—It communicates with the infraorbital vein, the pterygoid plexus of veins, the anterior jugular vein, and the external jugular vein. Tributaries on the Inner Side.—ia) The inferior lateral nasal vein is a smallG51 VEINS OF THE SCALP AND FACE I branch which corresponds with the lateralis nasi artery. It joins the facial on a j level with the ala of the nose. (b) The superior labial or coronary vein begins as a plexus in the orbicularis oris muscle of the upper lip, and passes with the superior coronary artery outwards, and joins the facial vein a little below the level of the ala of the nose. (c) The inferior labial veins.—A small branch (inferior coronary) usually ! opens into the facial a little below the superior labial vein ; but the chief branch from the lower lip descends as a rule over the chin to the submental vein, and thus only i opens indirectly into the facial vein. It may open into the anterior jugular vein. (d) The submental vein lies on the mylo-hyoid muscle superficial to the sub- j mental artery. It begins below the chin, and, running backwards in the digastric triangle, joins the facial vein just after the latter has passed over the body of the lower jaw. It receives branches from the inferior labial plexus and the neighbouring muscles, and communicates with the anterior jugular vein. (e) The submaxillary or glandular veins open into the facial as it crosses the submaxillary gland. But some branches from the gland often open into the submental vein. Tributaries on the Outer Side.—{a) The inferior palpebral veins.—Several I branches pass downwards to the facial vein ; others, as before stated, pass inwards to the angular vein (page 650). Through one or more of these branches a i communication is formed with the infraorbital vein. j {b) The anterior internal maxillary vein, sometimes known as the deep facial, passes downwards and forwards from the pterygoid plexus of veins between the ! buccinator and masseter muscles, and opens into the outer side of the facial vein under cover of the zygomaticus major muscle. (c) The buccal vein is a small branch from the buccinator muscle. {d) The anterior parotid branch descends downwards and forwards from the glandula socia parotidis to the facial. {e) The masseteric is a small branch from the masseter muscle. (/) The inferior or descending palatine vein accompanies the ascending palatine or tonsillar artery from the venous plexus about the tonsil and soft palate, and joins the facial vein just below the body of the lower jaw. The communicating branch between the external jugular and facial veins— sometimes known as the anterior division of the temporo-maxillary vein—runs obliquely downwards and inwards from the external jugular vein from near the spot where the latter is continuous with the temporo-maxillary trunk. It joins the facial vein deeply just behind the angle of the jaw. i The chief variations in the facial vein are :—(1) It may run over the sterno-mastoid I and open into the external jugular vein; (2) it may open into the anterior jugular vein; ' (3) it may run beneath the posterior belly of the digastricus and stylo-liyoid muscles; I (4) it may receive the lingual vein, the pharyngeal vein, or both of these veins. The Posteeior Superficial Vein of the Scalp The posterior vein descends over the occipital bone, and then deeply amongst I the muscles at the back of the neck. It ends in the innominate vein. The first or superficial portion of this trunk is known as the occipital vein; the second or deeper portion as the deep cervical vein (fig. 385). The occipital vein begins at the back of the skull in a venous plexus which anastomoses with the posterior auricular and posterior branch of the superficial temporal veins. It passes downwards over the occipital bone, and, perforating the trapezius with the occipital artery, sinks deeply into the suboccipital triangle, where it terminates in the deep cervical vein. At times it takes a more superficial i course, and, joining the posterior auricular, passes with this into the externalTHE VEINS 652 jugular vein. One of its branches—usually the outermost—receives an emissary vein issuing through the mastoid foramen of the temporal bone, and in this way forms a communication with the lateral sinus. The deep cervical vein begins as a plexus of small veins in the suboccipital triangle. After receiving, as a rule, the occipital vein, it passes downwards between the complexus and the semispinalis colli, in company, first with the princeps cervicis branch of the occipital artery, and afterwards with the deep cervical branch of the superior intercostal artery. On reaching the transverse process of the seventh cervical vertebra, it turns forward between that process and the neck of the first rib, and opens either into the innominate vein direct, or into the vertebral immediately before that vein joins the innominate. Tributaries.—It receives branches from the muscles amongst which it runs. The Lateeal Supeeficial Veins of the Scalp The lateral veins descend, one in front and one behind the ear, and unite about the level of the angle of the jaw to form a single trunk—the external jugular vein. | The anterior vein, the larger of the two, is known as far as the zygoma as the i superficial temporal vein. There it is joined by a deep vein from the temporal j fossa^—the middle temporal vein; and the united trunk, now called the common temporal vein, passes over the zygoma into the parotid gland. Opposite the neck I of the lower jaw it receives the large internal maxillary vein, and takes the name j of the temporo-maxillary vein. This emerges from the lower border of the parotid ! gland, and joins the posterior lateral vein, which is known as the posterior auricular, \ to form the external jugular vein. | The Anterior Lateral Veins.—The superficial temporal vein returns the blood j from the parietal region of the scalp. It is formed by the union of an anterior and i posterior branch: the former communicates with the supraorbital and frontal veins ; i the latter with the posterior auricular and occipital veins and the temporal | vein of the opposite side. These branches lie superficial to the corresponding branches of the superficial temporal artery, Avhich they roughly though not accurately follow. Like the artery, they lie between the skin and the cranial aponeurosis, and j descend over the temporal fascia to unite a little above the zygoma, and just in front of the pinna of the ear, to form the superficial temporal trunk. The vein, thus formed continues its course downwards with the trunk of the temporal artery,; and opposite the zygoma is joined by the middle temporal vein to form the common ' temporal vein. The middle temporal vein corresponds with the middle temporal artery. It | begins in a plexus in the temporal fossa, and then runs backwards between the j layers of the temporal fascia, the outer layer of which it perforates near thej zygoma, to join the superficial temporal vein. It receives an orbital branch, whict j corresponds with the orbital branch of the temporal artery and communicates ir j front with the ophthalmic vein, the external palpebral veins, and the infraorbita i veins, and then runs backwards between the layers of the temporal fascia to joii j the middle temporal trunk or plexus. The middle temporal vein communicate;! with the deep temporal veins, and through them with the pterygoid venous plexus The common temporal vein, formed by the confluence of the superficial an( | middle temporal veins, descends over the zygoma just in front of the pinna of th* i ear, lying a little superficial to the temporal artery. Then, passing deeply int(! the parotid gland, between the external auditory meatus and the angle of the jaw | it is joined almost at a right angle by the internal maxillary vein, and becomes th ; temporo-maxillary vein. Tributaries.—It receives (a) the transverse facial vein, which corresponds t the transverse facial artery ; (b) articular veins from the plexus around thVEINS OF THE SCALP 653 temporo-maxillary joint—this plexus receives tlie tympanic vein, which, togetlier with its corresponding artery, passes through the fissure of Glaser ; (c) parotid veins, from the substance of tlie parotid gland; (d) masseteric veins, from the j masseter muscle ; and (e) anterior auricular veins, from the pinna of the ear. The internal maxillary vein accompanies the first part of the internal maxillary artery between the internal lateral ligament and the neck of the loAver jaw. It begins at the posterior confluence of the veins forming the pterygoid plexus, and ends by uniting with the common temporal vein to form the temporo-maxillary trunk. ' The pterygoid plexus is formed by the veins which correspond to the branches of the internal maxillary artery. It is situated, partly on the inner surface of the internal pterygoid muscle, and partly around the external pterygoid muscle. The veins entering into this plexus are:—the two middle meningeal, which accom- pany the artery of that name; the posterior dental vein; the mandibular (inferior dental); the masseteric; the buccal; the pterygoid veins from the pterygoid muscles; the deep temporal, by which the plexus communicates wdth the temporal plexus; the spheno-palatine vein; the supraorbital; the superior palatine; the lower branch of the ophthalmic vein, which courses through the spheno-maxillary fissure from the orbit; and the Vesalian vein, through which the plexus communi- I cates with the cavernous sinus. The plexus ends posteriorly in the internal maxillary vein which joins the common temporal vein, and anteriorly in the anterior internal f maxillary or deep facial vein, which passes forwards and downwards between the I buccinator and masseter muscles to join the facial vein. The above-mentioned veins, forming by their confluence the pterygoid plexus, correspond in their course so nearly with that of their companion arteries, that a detailed description is not necessary. Although deeply placed, they are for convenience described with'the superficial veins. The temporo-maxillary vein is formed by the union of the common temporal vein and internal maxillary vein in the substance of the parotid gland. It usually ; joins about the angle of the jaw the posterior auricular vein to form the external jugular. At other times it divides into two branches, an anterior and a posterior. The anterior division runs forwards and downwards, and joins the facial vein (see Facial Vein). The posterior division runs backwards over the sterno-mastoid I and joins the posterior auricular to form the external jugular. When the temporo- maxillary trunk without dividing joins the posterior auricular to form the external \ jugular vein, the anterior branch is represented by the communicating branch between the external jugular and facial veins. The Posterior Lateral Veins.—The posterior auricular vein begins in a venous I plexus on the posterior part of the parietal bone. This plexus communicates with !' the vein of the opposite side, across the sagittal suture, and with the posterior ! branch of the superficial temporal vein in front, and with the occipital vein behind. ! It descends over the back part of the parietal bone and the mastoid process of the temporal bone, lying with its artery behind the ear. It then leaves the artery, and passing over the upper part of the sterno-mastoid muscle obliquely forwards and I downwards, joins the temporo-maxillary vein about the level of the angle of the ! lower jaw, forming the external jugular vein (fig. 385). \ Tributaries.—{a) Auricular veins from the back of the pinna ; and (6) the stylo-mastoid vein, corresponding to the little stylo-mastoid artery. The latter vein opens into the posterior auricular vein, as a rule, as the latter leaves the mastoid process. -THE VEINS 654 2. THE SUPEKFICIAL VEINS OF THE NECK The external jugular vein is formed by the confluence of the posterior auricular and temporo-maxillary veins near the angle of the lower jaw. It runs obliquely downwards and backwards across the sterno-mastoid muscle to a spot opposite the middle of the clavicle, where it terminates as a rule in the subclavian vein. A line drawn from a point midway between the mastoid process and angle of the jaw to the middle of the clavicle will indicate its course. It is covered by the skin, superficial fascia, and platysma, and is crossed by a few branches of the cervical plexus, the great auricular nerve running parallel to it at the upper part of the neck. It at first crosses the sterno-mastoid obliquely, then runs nearly parallel to the posterior border of that muscle, from which it is separated throughout its course by the anterior layer of the deep cervical fascia. Just above the clavicle it perforates the cervical fascia, by which it is prevented from readily collapsing, the fascia being attached to its walls. It then opens into the subclavian vein ; occasionally into the internal jugular, or into the confluence of the subclavian and internal jugular veins. It contains a pair of valves about one inch to two inches above the clavicle, and a second pair where it enters the sub- clavian vein. Both of these valves were shown by Dr. Struthers not to prevent the blood regurgitating, or injections passing from the larger vein into the external jugular. Some anatomists describe the external jugular vein as being formed by the junction of the posterior auricular and occipital veins. The vein here regarded as the upper part of the trunk of the external jugular is looked upon by them merely as a branch of communication between the external jugular and temporo-maxillary vein. The chief variations of the external jugular vein are :—(1) It may be very small, or much smaller or much larger than the opposite vein ; (2) it may be wanting on one or both sides, the veins which normally form it then opening into the internal jugular; (3) it may be formed merely by the posterior auricular vein; (4) it may be perforated by the superficialis colli nerve ; (5) it may receive the facial, the lingual, and the cephalic veins ; (6) it may pass over the clavicle and open into the cephalic or subclavian vein. Tributaries and communications.—From above downwards, the external jugular receives a branch from the internal jugular vein ; the posterior external jugular, which in the foetus was part of the primitive jugular vein ; a large branch connecting it with the facial vein; one or two small branches of communication from the anterior jugular vein ; near its termination, the transverse cervical and supra- scapular veins; and sometimes the anterior jugular vein at the posterior border and hinder surface of the sterno-mastoid. At times the occipital vein opens into the external jugular, and is by some anatomists regarded as the normal termination of the former vein. The posterior external jugular vein descends from the upper and back part of the neck, receiving small tributaries from the superficial structures and muscles. At times it communicates with the occipital, or may appear as a continuation of that vein. It opens into the external jugular as the latter vein is leaving the sterno- mastoid muscle. In the foetus this vein returns the blood from the interior of the cranium through the post-gienoid foramen. Vestiges of the foetal trunk are said to remain in the mastoid vein. The suprascapular veins, two in number, correspond to the suprascapular artery. They usually form one trunk before they open into the external jugular vein. They contain well-marked valves. The transverse cervical veins—or venae comites of the transverse cervical artery —accompany that vessel and open with the suprascapular vein into the external jugular close to the spot where the latter vein joins the subclavian.VEINS OF THE HEAD AND NECK 655 The anterior jugular vein begins below the chin by communicating- with the mental, submental, inferior labial, and inferior hyoid veins. It descends a little external to the middle line, receiving branches from the superficial structures at the front and side of the neck, and occasionally a branch from the larynx and thyroid body. Just above the clavicle it turns outwards, and, piercing the fascia, passes beneath the sterno-mastoid muscle and opens into the external jugular vein just before the latter joins the subclavian; at times it opens into the subclavian vein itself. In its course down the neck it communicates with the external jugular ; and, as it turns outwards beneath the sterno-mastoid, sends a branch across the trachea, between the layers of cervical fascia, to join the anterior jugular of the opposite side. This communicating vein may be divided in the operation of tracheotomy, and is then often found greatly engorged with blood. When the anterior jugular vein is large, the external jugular is small, and vice versa. It is usually also of large size when the corresponding vein on the opposite side is absent, as is frequently the case. It contains no valves. The position of the anterior jugular vein beneath the tendon of the sterno-mastoid should be borne in mind in tenotomy of that muscle for wry-neck. THE DEEP VEINS OF THE HEAD AND NECK The deep veins of the head and neck may be divided into—1. the veins of the diploe ; 2. the venous sinuses of the cranium ; 3. the veins of the brain; 4. the veins of the nasal cavities ; 5. the veins of the ear; 6. the veins of the orbit; 7. the veins of the pharynx and larynx; and 8. the deep veins of the neck. The veins of the diploe terminate partly in the superficial veins already described, partly in the venous sinuses of the cranium, and partly in the deep veins of the neck. The venous sinuses open into the deep veins of the neck. The veins of the brain terminate in the venous sinuses. The veins of the nasal cavities terminate partly in the deep, and to some extent in the superficial veins. The veins of the ear join both the superficial and deep veins and the venous sinuses. The veins of the orbit terminate partly in the superficial veins, but chiefly in the venous sinuses. The veins of the pharynx and larynx enter the deep veins of the neck. 1. THE VEINS OF THE DIPLOE The veins of the diploe are contained in bony channels in the cancellous tissue between the external and internal tables of the skull. They are of comparatively large size, with very thin and imperfect walls, and form irregular communicating channels. They have no valves. They can only be seen on removing the external table of the skull with a file or chisel. They terminate in four or five main and descending channels, which open, some outwards through the external table of the skull into some of the superficial and deep veins of the head and face, and some inwards through the internal table into the venous sinuses. They are divided into the frontal, fronto-sphenoidal, fronto-parietal or anterior temporal, external parietal or posterior temporal, and occipital or parieto-occipital. The frontal are contained in the anterior part of the frontal bone. They con- verge anteriorly to a single vein which passes downwards, perforates the external table through a small aperture in the roof of the supraorbital notch, and terminates in the supraorbital vein. The fronto-sphenoidal are contained in the lateral parts of the frontal bone, and, running into the sphenoid bone, terminate in the sinus alse parvaB.656 THE VEINS The fronto-parietal, or anterior temporal, are contained in the posterior part of the frontal and in the anterior part of the parietal bone. They pass downwards, and end, partly in the deep temporal veins by perforating the greater ring of the sphenoid bone, and partly in the superior petrosal sinus. The external parietal, or posterior temporal, ramifies in the parietal bone, and, coursing downwards to the posterior inferior angle of that bone, passes either through a foramen in its inner table, or through the mastoid foramen into the lateral sinus. The occipital, or parieto-occipital, ramifies chiefly in the occipital bone, and opens into the occipital vein or into the lateral sinus. The diploic veins freely anastomose with one another in the adult; but in the foetus, before the bones have united, each system of veins is distinct. Fig. 386.—The Veins of the Diploe. (From a specimen in St. Bartholomew's Hospital Musemn,) 2. THE VENOUS SINUSES OF THE CEANIUM The venous sinuses of the cranium are endothelially lined blood-spaces situated between the periosteal and meningeal layers of the dura mater. They are the i channels by which the blood is conveyed from the cerebral veins, and from some of the veins of the meninges and diploe, into the veins of the neck. The sinuses of the '■ base of the skull also carry the chief part of the blood from the orbit and eyeball to \ the jugular veins. At certain spots the sinuses communicate with the superficial * veins by small vessels known as the emissary veins, which run through foramina . in the cranial bones. The venous sinuses are eighteen in number: six being disposed medianly | and singly; six laterally and in pairs. The median and single sinuses are:—(1) the superior longitudinal; (2) the inferior longitudinal; (3) the straight; (4) the occipital; (5) the circular ; and (6) the transverse or basilar. The lateral and paired sinuses are:—(7) the two lateral; (8) the two superior petrosal; (9) the two inferior petrosal; (10) the two cavernous ; (11) the two spheno-parietal (sinus alae657 VENOUS SINUSES OF THE CBANIUM parvse), and the two sigmoid—which latter, however, are usually described as part of the lateral. Occasionally there are two additional sinuses (the two petro-squamous), due to the persistence in the adult of what in the foetus was the continuation of the lateral sinus. (1) The superior longitudinal sinus, or superior sagittal sinus (fig. 388), lies in the median groove on the inner surface of the calvaria along the attached margin of the falx cerebri. It extends from the foramen caecum to the internal occipital protuberance. It grooves from before backwards the frontal bone, the contiguous sagittal margin of the parietal bones, and the squamous portion of the occipital bone. In the foetus it communicates, through the foramen caecum, with the nasal veins, and generally throughout life with the superficial temporal vein through the parietal foramen. It is triangular on section, the base of the triangle corresponding to Fig. 387.—The Venous Sinuses. (From a dissection by W. J. Walsham in St. Bartholomew' Hospital Museum.)

Crossing it are a number of fibrous bands known as the chordae Willisii, and projecting into it in places are the Pacchionian bodies. In front the sinus is quite small, but it increases greatly in calibre as it runs backwards. It receives at intervals the superior cortical cerebral veins, and the veins from the falx. The former, for the most part, open into it in the direction opposite to that in which the blood is flowing in the sinus. They pass for some distance in the walls of the sinus before opening into it. Posteriorly, at the internal occipital protuberance, the superior longitudinal sinus usually turns sharply to the right, and ends in the right lateral sinus ; the straight sinus then usually terminates in the left lateral sinus, and the right and left lateral sinuses communicate with each other across the occipital protuberance. Occasionally, however, the superior longitudinal sinus ends UU658 THE VEINS in the left lateral sinus, the straight then passing into the right. At other times the posterior end of the superior longitudinal sinus at the internal occipital protu- berance becomes slightly dilated, forming what is called the torcular Herophili, or confluence of the sinuses. When this dilatation exists, the straight sinus usually opens into it in front, the two lateral sinuses on either side, the superior longitu- dinal above, the occipital sinus or sinuses, when two are present, below. The torcular may communicate through the occipital emissary vein, which, when present, passes through a minute foramen in the occipital protuberance, with the occipital vein. (2) The inferior longitudinal or inferior sagittal sinus (fig. 388) is situated at the free margin of the falx cerebri. Beginning about the junction of the anterior with the middle third of the falx, it is continued backwards along the concave or lower margin of that process to the junction of the falx with the tentorium, where Fig. 388.—The Venous Sinuses.

The sinus is cylindrical in shape and of small size, and receives some of the inferior frontal veins of the brain, some of the veins from the median surface of the brain, and some of the veins of the falx. (3) The straight sinus, or sinus rectus (fig. 388)—also variously called the sinus tentorii, perpendicularis, and obliquus—lies along the junction of the falx cerebri with the tentorium cerebelli. It is formed by the union of the great vein of Galen and the inferior longitudinal sinus. It receives in its course branches from the tentorium cerebelli and from the upper surface of the cerebellum. It runs down- wards and backwards to the internal occipital protuberance, where it ends in the left lateral sinus, at times in the right lateral sinus, or in the torcular Herophili when that blood-space is present. On section it is triangular in shape, with its apex upwards. (4) The occipital sinus (fig. 387) ascends mesially at the attached margin of theVENOUS SINUSES OF THE CBANIUM 659 falx cerebelli, along the lower half of the squamous portion of the occipital bone from i near the posterior margin of the foramen magnum to the internal occipital protu- berance. It usually begins in a right and left branch, known as the marginal sinuses. These proceed from the termination of each lateral sinus, run round the foramen magnum, where they communicate with the posterior spinal veins, and unite at a I variable distance from the internal occipital protuberance to form the single occipital sinus. Sometimes they remain separate as far as the occipital protuberance, then j forming two occipital sinuses. One or other of the marginal sinuses may be much smaller than the other, or be entirely absent. At the point where the marginal sinuses unite to form the single occipital sinus, there is a communication with the posterior spinal veins. The occipital sinus ends either in one of the lateral sinuses, in the straight sinus, or in the torcular Herophili when this is present. It receives in its course veins from the tentorium cerebelli, and from the inferior surface of the cerebellum. It communicates through the plexus of veins which surrounds the hypoglossal nerve in the anterior condyloid foramen with the vertebral vein and veins of the anterior spinal plexus. (5) The circular sinus, so called (fig. 387), is a venous plexus encircling the hypophysis cerebri, and connecting the right and left cavernous sinuses. The more distinct channels are found, one in front of the sella turcica, one behind, and one on its floor, and are sometimes called the anterior, posterior, and inferior inter- \ cavernous sinuses, the last being also known as the inferior circular sinus of ! Winslow. ! (6) The transverse or basilar sinus (fig. 387) is a venous plexus in the substance I of the dura mater over the basilar process of the occipital bone. It extends from the cavernous sinus to the margin of the foramen magnum below. It communi- cates laterally with the inferior petrosal sinus, and inferiorly with the anterior spinal veins. Through this sinus passes the sixth nerve. One of the larger of the irregular venous channels forming the sinus passes transversely from one inferior petrosal sinus to the other. It is this portion to which the description of the j transverse sinus given by some authors appears to apply. This venous plexus on the basilar process is serially homologous with the anterior spinal plexus of veins on the posterior surface of the bodies of the vertebrae. (7) The lateral sinus (fig. 387) extends from the internal occipital protuberance j to the jugular foramen. In this course it lies in the groove (which has been named I after it) along the squamous portion of the occipital bone, the posterior inferior angle of the parietal bone, the mastoid portion of the temporal bone, and the I jugular process of the occipital bone. It at first runs horizontally outwards and forwards between the two layers of the tentorium cerebelli, following the curve of the groove on the occipital and the posterior inferior angle of the parietal bones. In this part of its course it is sometimes known as the transverse sinus, or lateral sinus proper, but on reaching the groove in the mastoid portion of the temporal bone it leaves the tentorium and curves downwards and inwards and then forwards over the jugular process of the occipital bone, and ends in the posterior compart- ment of the jugular fossa in the sinus jugularis or bulb of the internal jugular vein. The S-shaped part of the sinus which lies on the mastoid portion of the temporal and jugular portion of the occipital bone is sometimes known as the sigmoid sinus. The lateral sinus receives the veins from the temporo-sphenoidal lobe of the cerebrum, some of the superior and inferior cerebellar veins, some of the veins of the medulla and pons, the occipital and the external parietal veins of the diploe, and at the spot where it leaves the tentorium the superior petrosal sinus and, when present, the petro-squamous sinus. It communicates with the occipital and vertebral veins through the mastoid and posterior condyloid foramina by means of emissary veins. As the lateral sinus lies between the tentorium it is on section prismatic in shape. The sigmoid portion is semicyhndrical. u u 2 i 1660 THE VEINS The right lateral sinus is usually the larger and the direct continuation of the superior longitudinal sinus, and hence conveys the chief part of the blood from the cortical surface of the brain and vault of the skull. The left lateral sinus is usually the smaller and the direct continuation of the straight sinus and hence returns the chief part of the blood from the central ganglia of the brain. The relation of the lateral sinus to the outside of the skull, especially to the mastoid process of the temporal bone, is of importance with reference to the opera- tions of trephining the mastoid cells, opening the tympanum, and exposing the sinus itself, in septic thrombosis, &c. The course of the sinus corresponds to a line drawn from the external occipital protuberance to the base of the mastoid process, or to the asterion, and thence over the back of the mastoid process in a curved line towards its apex. (8) The superior petrosal sinus (figs. 387, 388) runs at the attached margin of the tentorium cerebelli, along the upper border of the petrous portion of the temporal bone. It connects the cavernous with the lateral sinus. Leaving the outer and back part of the cavernous sinus just below the fourth nerve, it crosses the fifth nerve, and, after grooving the petrous bone, ends in the lateral sinus as the latter turns downwards on the mastoid portion of the temporal bone. It receives veins from the temporo-sphenoidal lobe of the cerebrum, veins from the cerebellum, veins from the tympanum through the squamo-petrosal fissure, and sometimes the fronto- parietal veins of the diploe. (9) The inferior petrosal sinus (figs. 387, 388) runs along the hne of the petro- occipital suture, and connects the cavernous sinus with the commencement of the internal jugular vein. It is shorter than the superior petrosal, but considerably wider. As it crosses the anterior compartment of the jugular foramen, it separates the glosso-pharyngeal from the pneumogastric and spinal accessory nerves. It receives veins from the inferior surface of the cerebellum, from the medulla and pons, and from the internal ear. The last issue through the aqueductus vestibuli and aqueductus cochleae. (10) The cavernous sinus (fig. 387) is an irregular shaped venous space situated between the meningeal and periosteal layers of the dura mater on the side of the body of the sphenoid bone. It extends from the central end of the sphenoidal fissure in front to the apex of the petrous bone behind. Its outer wall is the more distinct, and contains in it, but separated from the blood by the lining membrane of the sinus, the third and fourth nerves, and the ophthalmic division of the fifth nerve, the nerves lying in the above-mentioned order from above downwards, and from Avithin outwards. The inner wall is less distinct, and is formed chiefly by the internal carotid artery and the sixth nerve, these structures being separated from the blood by the endothelial lining of the sinus. Above the carotid the inner wall is practically absent, the blood-space communicating across the middle line with the opposite sinus in front, behind, and below the pituitary body or hypophysis cerebri. (See Circulae Sinus.) The cavernous sinus is traversed by numerous trabecul^e or fibrous bands, so that there is no central space, but rather a number of endothelially-lined irregular lacunar cavities communicating with each other. Hence its name cavernous, from its resemblance to cavernous tissue. In front it receives the ophthalmic vein, with which it is practically continuous, and just above the third nerve the sinus alae parv^. Internally it communicates with the opposite sinus, and posteriorly it ends in the superior and inferior petrosal sinuses. It also receives veins from the inferior surface of the frontal lobe of the brain, and some of the middle cerebral veins. Through the Vesalian vein, which runs in a minute foramen in the greater wing of the sphenoid bone, the sinus communicates with the pterygoid plexus of veins; through the venous plexus around the intraosseous portion of the internal carotid, with the internal jugular vein ; and through small661 CEBEBBAL AND CEBEBELLAB i veins which leave the cranium by the foramen ovale and foramen lacerum medium, with the pterygoid and pharyngeal plexuses. (11) The spheno-parietal sinus, or sinus alse parvse, runs in a shght groove on the under surface of the lesser wing of the sphenoid bone. It originates in one of the meningeal veins near the apex of the lesser wing, and, running inwards, passes through the sphenoidal fold of dura mater above the third nerve into the front part of the cavernous sinus. It generally receives the fronto-sphenoidal veins from the diploe. The petro-squamous sinus is occasionally present. It lies in a groove along the junction of the petrous and squamous portions of the temporal bone. It opens posteriorly into the lateral sinus at the spot where the latter enters on its sigmoid course. In front it sometimes, though very rarely, passes through a foramen in the squamous portion of the temporal bone between the glenoid cavity and the external auditory meatus into the temporal vein. This sinus is the rudiment of what in early foetal life, before the development of the internal jugular vein, was the con- tinuation of the lateral sinus, the blood from the interior of the skull at this period passing through the above-mentioned foramen into the primitive jugular vein. ! 3. THE VEINS OF THE BEAIN The veins of the brain present the following peculiarities :—(a) They do not I accompany the cerebral arteries, (h) Ascending veins do not as in other situations run with descending arteries, but with ascending arteries, and vice versa, (c) The deep veins do not freely communicate, [d) The veins have very thin walls, no muscular coat, and no valves, {e) The veins opening into the longitudinal, and some of those opening into the lateral sinus pour in their blood in a direction opposite to the current in the sinuses, so impeding the flow in both vein and sinus. (/) The I flow of blood in the sinuses is further retarded by the trabeculae stretching across i their lumen, and in the longitudinal sinus by the blood having to ascend, when the body is erect, through the anterior half of its course. The veins of the brain may be divided into the cerebral and the cerebellar. The Cerebral Veins The cerebral veins, like the cerebral arteries, may be divided into the cortical or hemispheral, and the central or ganglionic. The cortical, hemispheral or superficial veins ramify on the surface of the brain and return the blood from the cortical substance into the venous sinuses. They lie ' for the most part in the sulci between the convolutions, but some pass over the I convolutions from one sulcus to another. They consist of two sets : a superior and an inferior. I (1) The superior cortical veins, some eight to twelve in number on each side, are formed by the union of branches from the convex and median surfaces of the I cerebrum. Those from the convex surface pass forwards and inwards towards the longitudinal fissure, where they are joined by the branches coming from the median I surface. After receiving a sheath from the arachnoid, they enter obliquely into the superior longitudinal sinus, running for some distance in its walls. These veins freely communicate with each other, thus differing from the cortical arteries. [They also communicate with the inferior cortical veins. They may be roughly ! subdivided into {a) frontal; (h) paracentral; (c) central; and (d) occipital. I (2) The inferior cortical veins ramify on the base of the hemisphere and the ! lower part of its outer surface. Those on the inferior surface of the frontal lobe I pass, in part into the inferior longitudinal sinus, and in part into the cavernous sinus. Those on the temporo-sphenoidal lobe enter in part into the superior i662 THE VEINS petrosal sinus, and in part into the lateral sinus, passing into the latter from before backwards. A large vein from the occipital lobe winds over the crus cerebri and joins the great vein of Galen just before the latter enters the straight sinus. One of the inferior cortical veins is sometimes called the middle cerebral vein; another the great anastomosing vein of Trolard; another the posterior anasto- mosing vein of Labbe. The first ramifies over the under surface of the frontal and temporo-sphenoidal lobes, and at the anterior and lower part of the fissure of Sylvius opens into the cavernous sinus. The second establishes a communication between the superior longitudinal and cavernous sinuses by anastomosing with the middle cerebral and one of the superior cortical veins. The third passes from the middle cerebral vein over the temporo-sphenoidal lobe to the lateral sinus. The central, ganglionic, or deep cerebral veins are collected into two large | venous trunks, the venas Galeni, which leave the brain at the great transverse! fissure, that is, between the splenium of the corpus callosum and the optic lobes, | At this spot they unite to form a single vein, the vena magna Galeni, which opens I into the anterior end of the straight sinus. The venae Galeni are formed by the j union of the choroid vein with the vena corporis striati near the foramen of; Monro. From this spot they run backwards parallel to each other between the layers of the velum interpositum, and terminate in the way above mentioned. Tributaries of the veins of Galen.—The choroid vein, the vein of the corpus striatum, the basilar vein, the veins of the optic thalamus, the vein of the choroid ! plexus of the third ventricle, and veins from the corpus callosum, the pineal body,- the optic lobes, and posterior horn of the lateral ventricle. The united trunk, oi i great vein of Galen, receives veins from the upper surface of the cerebellum, anc one of the posterior inferior cerebral veins. ' The choroid vein runs with the choroid plexus. It begins in the inferior cornr • of the lateral ventricle, and ascends on the outer side of the choroid plexus along! the margin of the velum interpositum to the foramen of Monro, where it unite;; with the vein of the corpus striatum to form the vein of Galen. It receives tribu [ taries from the hippocampus major, corpus callosum, and fornix. The vena corporis striati, formed by veins from the corpus striatum and opti | thalamus, runs forwards in the groove between those structures, passing in its course; beneath the tinea semicircularis, and joins the vein of Galen at the foramen o Monro. Tributaries.—It receives, in addition to the veins from the corpus striatun and optic thalamus, small veins from the fornix, septum lucidum, and anterior corm j of the lateral ventricle. ; The basilar vein, formed by the confluence of the deep Sylvian vein, th | inferior striate veins, and some small anterior cerebral veins, runs backwards ove the crus cerebri, and enters the vein of Galen near the union of that vessel wit! I the vein of the opposite side. Tributaries.—The deep Sylvian vein from the insuL i and surrounding convolutions ; the inferior striate veins from the corpus striatun] j which they leave through the anterior perforated space; anterior cerebral vein from the front of the corpus collosum ; interpeduncular veins from the structure I in the interpeduncular space ; ventricular veins from the middle cornu of thelatera j ventricle ; and mesencephalic veins from the mid-brain. The Ceeebellar Veins i The cerebellar veins are divided into the superior and inferior. The superior ramify on the upper surface of the cerebellum; some of thei run inwards over the superior vermiform process to join the straight sinus an great vein of Galen ; others run outwards to the lateral and superior petros^i sinuses.663 NASAL—A UBIGULAB—OPHTHALMIC The inferior, larger than the superior, run, some forwards and outwards to the inferior petrosal and lateral sinuses, and others directly backwards to the occipital sinuses. The Veins of the Medulla and Pons The veins from the medulla oblongata and the pons terminate in the inferior petrosal and lateral sinuses. 4. THE VEINS OF THE NASAL CAVITIES The venous plexuses on the inferior turbinated bone and back of the septum are described with the Nose. The veins leaving the nasal cavities follow roughly the course of their corresponding arteries. Thus the spheno-palatine veins pass through the spheno-palatine foramen into the pterygoid plexus ; the anterior and posterior ethmoidal veins join the ophthalmic. Small veins accompany branches of the facial artery through the nasal bones and nasal process of the superior maxillary bones, and end in the angular and facial veins ; and other small veins pass from the nose anteriorly into the superior labial, and thence to the facial. 5. THE VEINS OF THE EAR The veins from the external ear and external auditory meatus join the tem- poral and posterior auricular veins. The veins from the tympanum open into the superior petrosal sinus and temporo-maxillary vein. The blood from the labyrinth flows chiefly through the internal auditory veins which lie with the internal auditory artery in the internal auditory meatus, and enters the inferior petrosal or lateral sinus. Some of the blood from the labyrinth, however, passes through the vestibular vein which lies in the aqueductus vestibuli, into the inferior petrosal sinus, and some through the aqueductus cochleae, into the commencement of the internal jugular vein. 6. THE VEINS OF THE ORBIT The blood from the eyeball and orbit is returned by the ophthalmic vein into the cavernous sinus. This vein and its tributaries have no valves, and communicate in front with the frontal, supraorbital, and other veins. Hence under certain conditions, as from pressure on the cavernous sinus, the blood may flow in the contrary direction to the normal—i.e. from behind forwards into the frontal and supraorbital, and thence through the angular vein into the facial. In this way pressure on the retinal veins is quickly relieved, and little or no distension occurs in cases of obstruction in the cavernous sinus. The ophthalmic vein, or common ophthalmic vein, is formed by the confluence at the back of the orbit of the superior and inferior ophthalmic veins. It is a short thick trunk, and passes backwards between the two heads of the external rectus muscle below the sixth nerve, and at the inner part of the sphenoidal fissure leaves the orbit and enters the front part of the cavernous sinus. A. The superior ophthalmic vein, larger than the inferior, begins at the inner canthus of the eyelid by a free communication with the frontal, supraorbital, and angular veins, and thence runs backwards and outwards with the ophthalmic artery across the optic nerve to the inner end of the sphenoidal fissure, where it joins the inferior ophthalmic vein to form the common ophthalmic trunk. In this course it lies anterior and superficial to the ophthalmic artery.664 THE VEINS Tributaries.—(1) The superior muscular veins; (2) the cihary veins; (3) the anterior and posterior ethmoidal veins ; (4) the lachrymal vein ; and (5) the central vein of the retina. (1) The superior muscular branches are derived from the levator palpebr^, superior rectus, superior oblique, and internal rectus. (2) The ciliary veins are divided into two sets : an anterior, which emerge from the eyeball with the anterior ciliary arteries, and open into the muscular veins returning the blood from the four recti; and a posterior set, which leave the globe midway between the cornea and entrance of the optic nerve. The latter veins are four or five in number, the upper ending in the superior, the lower in the inferior ophthalmic vein (page 890). (3) The anterior and posterior ethmoidal veins correspond in their course with the arteries of the same name. They enter the orbit through the anterior and Fig. K—The Veins of the Orbit.

(4) The lachrymal vein returns the blood from the lachrymal gland, and corre- sponds in its course to the lachrymal artery. (5) The central vein of the retina runs with the central artery in the optic nerve. It joins the superior ophthalmic at the back of the orbit. B. The inferior ophthalmic vein, smaller than the superior, is formed near the front of the orbit by the confluence of the inferior muscular with the lower posterior ciliary veins. It runs backwards below the optic nerve, along the floor of the orbit, and either joins the superior ophthalmic vein to form the common ophthalmic trunk, or else opens separately into the cavernous sinus. A large communicating branch passes downwards through the spheno-maxillary fissure to join the ptery- goid plexus of veins.665 INTERNAL JUGULAR Tributaries.—(1) The inferior muscular, which are derived from the inferior obhque, inferior rectus, and external rectus; and (2) the lower posterior ciliary veins. 7. THE VEINS OF THE PHAEYNX AND LAKYNX The veins of the pharynx are arranged in the form of a plexus, between the , constrictor muscles and the pharyngeal or prevertebral fascia. The plexus I receives branches from the mucous membrane, from the soft palate, the Eustachian tube, and the anterior recti and longus colli muscles. Above, it communicates with the pterygoid plexus of veins; below, either with the lower end of the facial vein, I pr with the internal jugular vein. I The veins of the larynx end partly in the superior, and partly in the inferior thyroid veins. j 8. THE DEEP VEINS OF THE NECK The deep veins of the neck are the internal jugular vein, the vertebral vein, and the deep cervical vein and their respective tributaries. The Internal Jugular Vein The internal jugular vein begins at the jugular fossa, and is the continuation of the lateral sinus. It passes down the neck in company first with the internal carotid artery, and then with the common carotid artery to a spot a little external to the sterno-clavicular articulation, where it joins the subclavian to form the innominate vein. At its commencement in the larger, and posterior and external part of the jugular foramen, it is somewhat dilated, forming the so-called bulb or sinus of the internal jugular vein. At first it lies in front of the rectus capitis lateralis, and behind the internal carotid artery, from which it is separated by the hypoglossal, glosso-pharyngeal, and pneumogastric nerves, and by the carotid plexus of the sympathetic. But as it descends it passes gradually to the outer side of that I vessel, and retains this relation as far as the upper border of the thyroid cartilage. Thence it runs to its termination along the outer side of the common carotid artery, being contained in the same sheath with it and the pneumogastric nerve, but separated from these structures by a distinct septum. The vein generally overlaps the artery in front; hence the importance in tying the carotid of opening i the sheath well to the inner side of that vessel, in order to avoid the vein. About an inch above its termination it contains a pair of imperfect valves. Tributaries.—At the bulb or sinus the internal jugular vein receives the inferior : petrosal sinus; opposite the angle of the jaw veins from the pharyngeal plexus, ! and often a communicating branch from the external jugular vein ; opposite the bifurcation of the carotid it is joined by the facial, and a little lower down by the lingual and the superior thyroid vein, and at the level of the cricoid cartilage by I the middle thyroid vein. The inferior petrosal sinus is described with the other sinuses of the brain (page 660); the pharyngeal plexus with the veins of the pharynx (see above); I, and the facial vein with the superficial veins of the scalp and face (page 650). The lingual vein begins near the tip of the tongue, under the name of the i ranine. It lies at first close to the hypoglossal nerve and beneath the mucous , membrane covering the under surface of the tongue. It then passes backwards i across the hyo-glossus, the latter muscle intervening between it and the lingual artery. After receiving the sublingual vein and the dorsalis linguae veins which roughly correspond to their respective arteries, and the two small veins (venae comites) which frequently accompany the lingual artery beneath the hyo-glossus,THE VEINS 666 the united trunk crosses the common carotid artery and opens into the internal jugular vein. At times these tributaries open separately into the internal jugular vein or into the facial vein. The superior thyroid vein emerges from the upper part of the thyroid body, in which it freely anastomoses with the other thyroid veins, both in the substance of the organ, and on its surface beneath the capsule. Thence it passes upwards and outwards into the internal jugular vein, crossing the common carotid artery in its course. At times it forms a common trunk with the facial vein. Its tributaries are the sterno-hyoid, sterno-thyroid and thyro-hyoid veins from the muscles bearing those names ; and the crico-thyroid and superior laryngeal vein, which correspond with the crico-thyroid and superior laryngeal arteries respectively. These require no special description. The middle thyroid vein passes out from the capsule of the thyroid gland near the lower part of the lateral lobe of that body, crosses the common carotid obliquely downwards and outwards, and opens into the internal jugular vein a little below the cricoid cartilage. The Infeeige Thyeoid Veins The inferior thyroid veins descend from the lower part of the thyroid body obliquely outwards and downwards to the innominate veins. The right vein crosses the innominate artery just before its bifurcation, and ends in the right innominate vein a little above the superior vena cava. It receives inferior laryngeal veins and veins from the trachea, and has valves at its termination in the innomi- nate. The left vein passes obliquely over the trachea behind the sterno-thyroid muscle, and opens into the left innominate vein. It also receives laryngeal and tracheal veins, and is guarded by valves where it opens into the innominate trunk. The inferior thyroid veins communicate across the trachea by transverse branches. The Veetebeal Veins The vertebral vein (fig. 342) does not accompany the vertebral artery in its fourth stage, that is, within the skull, but begins as a plexus of small veins in the suboccipital triangle. It then enters the foramen in the transverse process of the atlas, and passes with the vertebral artery through the foramina in the transverse processes of the cervical vertebrae, forming a plexus around the artery. On leaving the transverse process of the sixth cervical vertebra it crosses in front of the subclavian artery and opens into the innominate vein. It has one or two semilunar valves at its entrance into the innominate vein. In the suboccipital triangle it communicates with the intraspinal, deep cervical, and occipital veins, and is joined by veins from the recti and oblique muscles and the pericranium. Tributaries.—As it passes down the neck it receives (1) lateral spinal veins, which issue along with the cervical nerves and lateral spinal arteries from the spinal canal; (2) branches from the venous plexus about the bodies of the cervical vertebrae and their transverse processes; (3) branches from the deep cervical muscles; and (4) branches from the cervical dorsal spinal veins. Just before it terminates in the innominate it is joined by (5) the deep cervical vein (sometimes); (6) the anterior vertebral vein; and (7) the upper superior intercostal vein (sometimes). The anterior vertebral vein begins in a plexus in front of the bodies of the cervical vertebrae, and, running downwards with the ascending cervical artery between the scalenus anticus and longus colli muscles, opens into the vertebra>l vein just before the latter ends in the innominate. It receives tributaries from the scaleni, longus colli, and rectus capitis anticus muscles. The deep cervical vein, which is really a part of the posterior superficial vein of the scalp, is described with that vein (page 652).mi SPINAL 3. THE SPINAL VEINS The spinal veins, which form plexuses around and within the spinal canal from the cranium to the sacrum, may be divided into the extra- and intraspinal veins. The extraspinal form a plexus both in front of the bodies of the vertebrae (the anterior spinal plexus), and in the spinal groove between the transverse and spinous processes—the dorsal plexus, or dorsal spinal plexus as it is often called. The intraspinal veins, or those within the spinal canal, may be divided into the meningeal and the medullary. The meningeal form an anterior and posterior spinal plexus between the dura mater and the walls of the spinal canal, and are generally known as the meningo-rachidean veins. They receive the veins from the bodies of Fig. 390.—The Spinal Veins. Anterior sjnnal plexus the vertebrae. The medullary set are situated within the dura mater ; they return the blood from the spinal cord, and are known as the medulli-spinal veins. I 1. The extraspinal veins.—{a) The veins of the anterior spinal plexus ramify I in front of the bodies of the vertebrae. They are of small size and most distinct I in the cervical region (fig. 390). They open into the neighbouring veins. (5) The veins of the posterior spinal or dorsal spinal plexus are situated around j the spinous processes, the laminae, and the articular and transverse processes of the I vertebrae, the larger veins of the plexus running horizontally forwards along the interspinous ligaments. The plexus is formed chiefly by the union of tributaries proceeding from the integuments of the back and the spinal muscles. Communi- cations take place between the veins of each vertebral segment by vertical branches running upwards and downwards to the plexus above and below respectively nearTHE VEINS 668 the base of the transverse processes. Branches are also sent between the lamina of the several vertebrae to the posterior plexus of the intraspinal veins,' and also forwards between the transverse processes of the vertebrae to join the vertebral vein in the neck, the dorsal branch of the intercostal veins in the thorax, the lumbar veins in the lumbar region, and the lateral sacral veins in the sacral region. 2. The intraspinal veins are divided into {a) the meningeal; and {h) the medullary, or meduUi-spinal. {a) The meningeal extra-medullary or meningo-rachidian veins lie in the fatty tissue betw^een the walls of the vertebral canal and the dura mater or theca vertebralis. They are arranged in four longitudinal channels, two of which are anterior and two posterior, united by transverse branches corresponding in number to the vertebral segments (fig. 390). The anterior longitudinal spinal veins extend from the foramen magnum to the coccyx as two tortuous plexiform vessels, one being placed on each side of the back of the bodies of the vertebra behind the posterior common ligament. Opposite the body of each vertebra they communicate by a transverse branch, which passes between the body of the vertebra and posterior common ligament, an arrangement which is sometimes spoken of as the spinal venous ladder. Each transverse branch as it lies under cover of the posterior common ligament receives the veins from the bodies of the vertebrae (the venae basis vertebrae). At the spot where each longi- tudinal vein is joined by the transverse branch, the vessel becomes considerably dilated. From the longitudinal vein branches run backwards to join the posterior longitudinal veins, and opposite the intervertebral foramina a transverse branch runs outwards to join the vertebral vein, the intercostal veins, the lumbar veins, and the sacral veins, according to the region of the spine in which the vertebra is situated. Above, the anterior spinal veins communicate with the basilar plexus at the front of the foramen magnum. The posterior longitudinal spinal veins, smaller than the anterior longitudinal veins, likewise extend from the cranium to the coccyx. They lie between the posterior wall of the spinal canal and the dura mater. Like the anterior, they communicate by transverse branches, which receive veins through the ligamenta subflava from the dorsal spinal plexus. They also communicate with the anterior longitudinal veins by lateral transverse branches. It will be thus seen (fig. 390) that in the interior of the vertebral canal, opposite each vertebral segment, there is a venous ring between the bony wall of the canal and the sheath of the dura mater, the ring being formed in front by the anterior transverse vein; on each side by the dilated portion of the trunk of the anterior longitudinal spinal vein, and the lateral transverse branch ; and behind, by the trunk of the posterior longitudinal vein and the posterior transverse branch. This venous ring receives veins from the body of the vertebra, from the spinal cord, and from the meninges, and pours its blood, in part through the lateral veins lying in the intervertebral foramina into the vertebral, intercostal, lumbar, or sacral veins ; and in part through the branch which perforates the ligamenta subflava into the dorsal spinal plexus. Above, the posterior longitudinal veins communicate at the back of the foramen magnum with the occipital sinuses. Around the foramen magnum a distinct venous ring or plexus is formed by the communication between the occipital and marginal sinuses and the posterior and anterior "spinal veins. {h) The medullary or medulli-spinal veins, or veins of the spinal cord, are of small size, and run in the pia mater in a tortuous course along the spinal cord. They join the venous ring corresponding to each vertebral segment by passing along the sheath of dura mater reflected round the spinal nerves.INFEBIOB VENA CAVA 669 4. THE VEINS OF THE ABDOMEN AND PELVIS All the veins of the abdomen and pelvis—with the exception of the superior ! epigastric vein and ascending lumbar vein, which open ultimately into the superior vena cava—enter directly or indirectly into the inferior vena cava. The veins corresponding to the parietal branches of the abdominal aorta, except the middle sacral vein, open directly into the inferior vena cava ; the middle sacral vein only indirectly through the left common iliac vein. Of the visceral veins corresponding to the visceral branches of the abdominal aorta, those which return the blood from the stomach, intestines, and pancreas (the chylopoetic viscera), and from the spleen, I end in a common trunk (the portal vein). The portal vein enters the liver, and breaks up in the liver substance into capillaries like an artery, and from these j capillaries arise the hepatic veins which open into the inferior vena cava as that vessel grooves the under surface of the liver. Of the other visceral veins, both renals, the right capsular, and the right sper- matic or ovarian open directly into the inferior vena cava ; whilst the left capsular and left spermatic or ovarian only join that vessel indirectly through the left renal. Two of the superficial veins of the lower part of the anterior abdominal wall, the superficial epigastric and superficial circumflex iliac, enter the long saphenous ' vein; and two of the deep" veins from the like situation, the deep epigastric and deep circumflex iliac, enter the external iliac vein. The blood in these vessels, however, can flow upwards as well as in the normally downward direction. In obstruction of the inferior vena cava they become greatly enlarged, and form, with the superior epigastric vein and with other superficial veins of the thorax with which they anastomose, one of the chief channels for the return of the blood from the lower limbs. The veins of the pelvis, which receive the veins from the perin^eum and gluteal region, join the internal iliac vein. THE INFERIOE VENA CAVA j The inferior or ascending vena cava (fig. 391) is the large vessel which returns 1 the blood from the lower extremities and the abdomen and pelvis. It is formed by the confluence of the right and left common iliac veins opposite the body of the i fifth lumbar vertebra, ascends in front of the lumbar vertebrae to the right of the abdominal aorta, passes through the caval opening in the diaphragm, and ends in the lower and back part of the right auricle of the heart on a level with the ! lower border of the ninth thoracic vertebra. At its origin it lies behind the right ' common iliac artery on a plane posterior to the aorta, but as it ascends it passes [ slightly forward and to the right, getting on a plane anterior to the aorta, and I becoming separated from that artery by the right crus of the diaphragm and the j lobulus Spigelii of the liver. Whilst in contact with the liver it lies in a deep I groove on the hinder surface of that organ, the groove being often converted into II a distinct canal by a thin portion of the hepatic substance bridging across the j groove. As it passes through the diaphragm its walls are attached to the tendinous ' margins of the caval opening, and are thus held apart when the muscle contracts. ! On the thoracic side of the diaphragm it lies for about half an inch within the ij pericardium, the serous layer of that membrane being reflected over it. I Relations.—In front it is covered by the peritoneum, and crossed by the right ,! spermatic artery, branches of the aortic plexus of the sympathetic, the transverse670 THE VEINS colon, the root of the mesentery, the duodenum, the head of the pancreas, the portal vein, and the liver. The median group of the lumbar lymphatic glands are also in front of it below. Behind, it lies on the lumbar vertebraB, the right lumbar arteries, the right renal artery, the right semilunar ganglion, and the right crus of the diaphragm. To the right are the peritoneum and liver. To the left is the aorta, and higher up the right crus of the diaphragm. Fig. 391.—The Abdominal Aorta and Inferior Vena Cava.

(1) The renal or emulgent veins return the blood from the kidneys. They are short but thick trunks, and open into the vena cava nearly at right angles to that vessel. The vein on the left side, like the kidney, is a little higher than on the right, and is also longer, in consequence of its having to cross the aorta. The comparative shortness of the right renal vein should be borne in mind in the operation of nephrectomy, since, if too much traction is made on the pedicle, not only the vein, but a portion of the vena cava may be drawn into the ligature, as shownTBIBUTABIES OF THE INFEBIOB VENA CAVA 671 in a specimen in St. Bartholomew's Hospital Museum. Each vein lies in front of its corresponding artery. The left vein crosses in front of the aorta, just below the origin of the superior mesenteric artery. It is covered by the third portion of the duodenum, and receives the left spermatic, or the left ovarian in the female, and usually the left suprarenal, and sometimes the left phrenic. There are rudiments of valves in each vein where it joins the vena cava. Those on the right side, how- ever, are less well marked. (2) The suprarenal veins.—There is usually only one suprarenal vein on each side to return the blood brought to the suprarenal body by the three suprarenal arteries. On the right side the vein opens into the vena cava direct above the opening of the right renal vein. On the left side, it opens into the left renal. (3) The spermatic veins return the blood from the testicle. They begin by the confluence of small branches from the body of the testicle and epididymis, and as they proceed up the spermatic cord, in front of the spermatic artery and vas deferens, become dilated and plexiform, constituting the so-called pampiniform plexus. After passing through the external abdominal ring, the inguinal canal, and the internal abdominal ring, the plexus merges into two veins, which lie one on each side of the spermatic artery. Along with the artery the veins pass up beneath the peritoneum, and on the left side also beneath the sigmoid flexure of the colon, across the psoas muscle and ureter, to end as a single trunk, on the right side in the inferior vena cava, and on the left side in the left renal vein. There are commonly a number of imperfect valves in the spermatic plexus and a perfect pair at the termination of each spermatic vein. On the left side, however, the terminal valve may be wanting. (4) The ovarian veins begin as the pampiniform plexus near the ovary, between the layers of the broad ligament. This plexus communicates freely with the uterine plexus of veins, and with the plexus of veins which extends from the hilum of the ovary into the ovarian ligament (the ovarian bulb). After passing from between the layers of the broad ligament, the plexus unites to form at first two and then a single vessel, which accompanies the ovarian artery, following a similar course to the spermatic veins in the male. The right ovarian vein opens into the inferior vena cava; the left into the left renal. They usually contain imperfect valves in their plexiform part, and a perfect valve where they join the vena cava I and renal vein respectively. I (5) The lumbar veins.—There are usually four lumbar veins on each side corre- I sponding to the lumbar arteries. The main trunks of these veins, which lie beside the bodies of the lumbar vertebrae, are formed by the union beneath the psoas of anterior and posterior branches. The anterior branches collect the blood from the front and lateral walls of the abdomen. They communicate in front with the internal mammary and epigastric veins, and then run backwards between the abdominal muscles in company with the anterior branches of the lumbar arteries to their confluence with the posterior branches. The posterior branches collect the blood from the loins and muscles of the back, and correspond to the posterior or dorsal division of the lumbar arteries. They receive communicating branches from the dorsal spinal plexus and from the vertebral canal, and pass forwards between the transverse processes to join the anterior branches. The trunk lumbar veins are connected beneath the psoas muscle by vertical branches, which cross in : front of the transverse processes. The last lumbar vein is variously joined below by a vertical branch to the common iliac, internal iliac, lateral sacral or ilio-lumbar vein, and the first lumbar vein is similarly connected above with the commence- men^fc of the vena azygos major on the right, and the vena azygos minor on the left sidte. The vertical vein thus formed is known as the ascending lumbar vein, and is regarded by some morphologists as the remains of the primitive or cardinal vein of the embryo. The trunk lumbar veins run up beneath the tendinous arches of672 THE VEINS the psoas on the sides of the bodies of the vertebra in company with the lumbar arteries and branches of the sympathetic nerve, and end in the inferior vena cava on its posterior aspect. The left veins are longer than the right, and pass behind the aorta. (6) The phrenic veins, or inferior phrenic veins as they are sometimes called, follow the course of the phrenic arteries: the right opens into the vena cava direct; the left into the suprarenal, the left renal, or the vena cava. (7) The hepatic veins, the largest tributaries of the vena cava, return the blood from the liver. Commencing in the substance of the liver (see Liver), they converge as they approach its posterior surface, and unite to form two or three large branches, which open into the vena cava as it lies in the groove or canal in that organ. Some smaller vessels from the lobulus Spigelii, and other parts of the liver in the neighbourhood of the caval groove, open directly into the vena cava. The hepatic veins contain no valves, but, in consequence of those from the right and left lobe of the liver opening obliquely into the vena cava, present a semilunar fold at the lower margin of their orifices. Chief Variations in the Inferior Vena Cava (1) The inferior vena cava, in cases of transposition of the viscera, may lie on the left side of the aorta. (2) Without transposition it may also lie to the left of the aorta, crossing to the right to gain the caval opening immediately below the diaphragm, or after receiving the left renal vein. (3) It may be double, the left cava then usually passing across the aorta into the right after receiving the left renal vein. A communi- cation between the right and left veins in the position of the normal left common iliac vein may or may not then exist. (4) The inferior vena cava may be absent, the blood from the lower extremities passing by a large vein in the position of the ascending lumbar and azygos veins through the diaphragm to open into the superior vena cava. The hepatic veins then open directly into the right auricle through the normal caval opening in the diaphragm. (5) The inferior vena cava may receive the left spermatic vein. (6) It may receive a left accessory renal vein passing behind the aorta, and into this the usual tributaries of the left renal vein may open. (7) It may receive several accessory renal veins; as many as seven on each side have been met with. (8) The lumbar veins may enter it on one or both sides as a common trunk. (8) THE COMMON ILIAC VEINS The common iliac veins are formed opposite the sacro-iliac synchondrosis by the confluence of the external iliac and internal iliac veins. They converge as they ascend, and unite opposite the upper border of the fifth lumbar vertebra to form the vena cava inferior a little to the right of the median line. The rig^ht vein, shorter and more vertical in direction than the left, passes | obliquely behind the right common iliac artery to its outer side, where it is joined j by the left common iliac vein. j The left vein lies to the inner side of the left common iliac artery, and, after crossing in front of the promontory of the sacrum and fifth lumbar vertebra below the bifurcation of the aorta, passes beneath the right common iliac artery to jpin the right vein and form the inferior vena cava. The left vein may contain an imperfect valve. Tributaries.—The ilio-lumbar veins may enter the lower part of the common iliac, or open into the internal iliac vein. The left vein receives the middle sacral j veins. j {a) The ilio-lumbar veins follow the course of the ilio-lumbar artery, and end | either in the common iliac or in the internal iliac vein. i {h) The middle sacral veins ascend on either side of the middle sacral artery in j front of the sacrum, to open usually by a single trunk into the left common iHac I673 COMMON ILIAC—PORTAL vein. They communicate with the lateral sacral veins, forming the so-called pre- sacral plexus. Below, the middle sacral veins communicate with the haemorrhoidal veins. Chief Variatio7is in the Common Iliac Veins (1) Either common iliac vein may be double, or double only for a portion of its extent. (2) One may be absent,—the external and internal iliac veins joining the opposite common iliac to form the vena cava. (3) The right and left internal iliac veins may unite and open as a common trunk at the confluence of the right and left external ihac veins to form the vena cava. (4) The middle sacral trunk vein may divide, and one branch open into the right, and the other into the left common iliac vein. THE PORTAL VEIN AND ITS TRIBUTARIES The veins corresponding to the inferior mesenteric, the superior mesenteric, and the branches of the coeliac artery, with the exception of the terminal branches of the hepatic artery, do not join the inferior vena cava direct, but unite to form a common trunk—the portal vein. This vein enters the liver, and breaks up in its substance into capillaries like an artery, from which the blood is again ultimately collected by the hepatic veins, and carried by them into the inferior vena cava. The terminal branches of the hepatic artery also break up in the liver into capillaries, and from them the blood likewise finds its way finally into the hepatic veins, and thence into the inferior vena cava. Thus the arterial blood, leaving the aorta for the supply of the stomach, the intestines, the pancreas (the so-called chylopoetic viscera), and the spleen, passes, before it reaches the vena cava, through two sets of capillaries: viz. the capillaries of the viscera and the capillaries of the liver. Hence the portal system of veins may be said to terminate in capillaries at each end; to begin, like other veins, in capillaries in the viscera ; but, unlike other veins, to end in capillaries like an artery, instead of in a larger and larger vein till the auricle is reached. The portal vein and its tributaries have no valves. The portal vein is a thick trunk about three inches in length (7-8 cm.). It is formed behind the pancreas, opposite the right side of the body of the second lumbar vertebra, by the union of the superior mesenteric with the splenic vein. After passing behind the first part of the duodenum, and then between the layers of the lesser omentum in company with the hepatic artery and the hepatic duct, it enters the transverse or portal fissure of the liver, and there divides into a right and left branch. In this course it passes upwards and to the right, having both the hepatic artery and the common bile duct in front, the former to the left, the latter to the right. It is surrounded by branches of the hepatic plexus of the sym- pathetic nerve, and by numerous lymphatic vessels and some glands. The connective tissue sheath enclosing these structures is called the capsule of Glisson. Just before it divides it is somewhat dilated, the dilated portion being called the sinus of the portal vein. The division into right and left branches takes place towards the right end of the transverse fissure of the liver. The right branch is ! shorter and thicker than the left, and supplies the right lobe of the liver and a i branch to the quadrate lobe. The left branch is longer and smaller than the right, : and supplies the left lobe, and gives a branch to the Spigelian and quadrate lobes. It is joined, as it crosses the longitudinal fissure, by a fibrous cord, known as the round ligament of the liver or the obliterated umbilical vein, and posteriorly by a second fibrous cord, the remains of the ductus venosus. In the foetus the blood passes through the umbilical vein and ductus venosus directly into the vena cava, a very small quantity only turning to the right and left into the branches of the portal vein. Before birth, the blood in that part of the left branch of the portal XXTHE VEINS 674 vein which lies between the trunk of the vena porta and the umbilical vein travels from left to right; but after birth, as the portal circulation becomes freely esta- blished and the umbilical vein and ductus venosus are obliterated, in the opposite direction, i.e. from right to left. Tributaries.—The pyloric, the gastric, the cystic (which latter usually enters the right branch), the superior mesenteric, and the splenic. The pyloric vein begins near the pylorus in the lesser curve of the stomach, and, running from left to right ^\iih. the superior pyloric artery, opens directly into the lower part of the portal vein. It receives branches from the pancreas and duodenum. Fig. 392.—The Veins of the Stomach and Portal Vein. (From a dissection by W. J. Walsham.) Cystic vein Right branch of portal vein Continvation of hepatic artery G astro-duodenal artery Pyloric vein Oiufntal vein L'\ft branch of portal vein The gastric or coronary vein runs with the gastric artery at first from right to left, along the lesser curve of the stomach, towards the cardiac end, and then, turning to the right, passes across the spine from left to right to end in the portal trunk a little higher than the pyloric vein (fig. B92). At the cardiac end of the stomach it receives small branches from the oesophagus. The cystic vein returns the blood from the gall-bladder. It usually opens into the right branch of the portal vein. Tho superior mesenteric vein begins in tributaries which correspond with the branches of the superior mesenteric artery. It courses upwards a little, in front and to the right of the artery, passing with that vessel from between the layers of the675 POBTAL mesentery in front of the duodenum, and behind the pancreas, where it joins the splenic vein to form the portal trunk. Tributaries.—In addition to the tributaries corresponding to the branches of the superior mesenteric artery—viz. the ileo-colic, right colic, middle colic, and small intestinal veins (fig. 393)—it receives the right gastro-epiploic and the pancreatico- duodenal veins just before its termination in the portal vein. The right gastro-epiploic vein accompanies the artery of that name. It runs from left to right along the greater curvature of the stomach, receiving branches from the anterior and posterior surfaces of that viscus, and from the great Fig. 393.—The Superior Mesenteric Vein.

The pancreatico-duodenal vein runs with the corresponding arteries between the head of the pancreas and the second portion of the duodenum, and ends in the superior mesenteric vein a little below the spot where that vessel is joined by the right gastro-epiploic vein. The splenic vein issues as several large branches from the hilum of the spleen. These soon unite to form a large trunk, which passes across the aorta and spine in company with the splenic artery, below which it lies, to join at nearly a right angle the superior mesenteric vein. In this course it lies behind the pancreas ; and at its X X 2THE VEINS 676 union with the superior mesenteric to form the vena porta, in front of the inferior vena cava. Tributaries.—It receives veins corresponding to the vasa brevia arteries from the cardiac end of the stomach, the left g^astro-epiploic vein, veins from the pancreas, and the inferior mesenteric vein. The left gastro-epiploic vein accompanies the left gastro-epiploic artery. It runs from right to left along the greater curvature of the stomach, receives branches from the stomach and omentum, and opens into the commencement of the splenic vein. The inferior mesenteric vein begins at the rectum in the superior and middle hsemorrhoidal veins. It passes out of the pelvis with the inferior mesenteric artery; Fig. 394.—The Inferior Mesenteric Vein. (The colon is turned up, and the small intestines are drawn to the right side.)

On approaching the pancreas it turns slightly inwards, and passes obliquely behind that gland to join the splenic vein just before the latter unites with the superior mesenteric to form the vena porta. THE VEINS OF THE PELVIS The veins of the pelvis, with the exception of the middle sacral vein which terminates in the left common iliac vein, open into the internal iliac vein. Under the head of pelvic veins are included all of those corresponding to the branches ofmi VEINS OF PELVIS the internal iliac artery except the hypogastric branch, although some of these veins do not return the blood from the pelvic walls or viscera. The internal iliac vein is formed by the confluence of the veins (except the umbilical) corresponding to the branches of the internal iliac artery. It varies considerably in length, but is usually quite a short trunk, extending from the upper part of the great sacro-sciatic foramen to the sacro-iliac synchondrosis, where it joins the external iliac to form the common iliac vein. It lies behind and a little internal to the internal iliac artery. It contains no valve. Tributaries.—The internal iliac vein receives directly or indirectly the following branches: the gluteal, ilio-lumbar, lateral sacral, obturator, sciatic, pudic, dorsal penile, prostatic, vesical, and hsemorrhoidal veins. The single umbilical vein—the vein corresponding to the right and left hypogastric arteries and their continuation, the umbilical arteries—does not enter the pelvis, but, leaving the umbilical arteries at the navel, passes along the falciform ligament to the liver. After birth it is converted into a fibrous cord. (See Pobtal Vein, page 673.) The gluteal veins accompany the gluteal artery, and, passing through the upper part of the great sciatic foramen, open into the internal iliac vein near its termina- tion, either separately or as a single trunk. The ilio-lumbar veins open into the internal iliac a little higher than the gluteal. At times they join the common iliac vein. The lateral sacral veins join the gluteal or the internal iliac -at or about the same situation as the gluteal. They form with the middle sacral veins a plexus in front of the sacrum, and receive branches from the sacral canal. The obturator vein, which lies below the obturator artery as it crosses the side of the pelvis, opens into the front of the internal iliac vein a little below the gluteal. Its branches correspond to those of the artery. The sciatic veins accompany the sciatic artery, and, as a rule, unite to form a single trunk before joining the internal iliac a little below the obturator vein. All the above veins so closely follow the ramifications of their respective arteries, that no further special description of them is required. They all contain valves. The pudic vein does not begin as the dorsal vein of the penis, but issues from the corpus cavernosum with the artery of that body. It communicates, however, with the dorsal vein before the latter pierces the triangular ligament. In the rest of its course it runs with the pudic artery, receiving tributaries corresponding to the branches of that vessel. It terminates in the lower part of the internal iliac vein. The dorsal vein of the penis begins in a plexus around the corona giandis, then runs along the centre of the dorsum of the penis between the two pudic arteries. In this course it receives large tributaries from the interior of the organ, which, emerging for the most part between the corpus spongiosum and corpus cavernosum, wind obliquely over the outer surface of the latter structure to the dorsum of the penis to end in the dorsal vein. At the root of the penis the dorsal vein leaves the dorsal arteries, and, passing straight backwards between the two layers of the suspensory ligament, and then through either the subpubic ligament or the upper part of the triangular ligament of the pelvis (fig. 371) bifurcates, each branch passing backwards and downwards to the prostatico-vesical plexus of veins. At times the dorsal vein begins as two branches, which run between the dorsal arteries and only unite to form a single trunk about an inch and a half from the triangular ligament. Before passing through the triangular ligament, it communicates on each side with the primary radicals of the pudic vein. After dividing into a right and left branch within the pelvis, each vessel generally communicates with the obturator vein by a branch passing over the back of the pubes to the obturator foramen. The prostatico-vesical plexus surrounds the prostate and the neck and lowerTHE VEINS 678 fundus of the bladder. It receives in front the right and left divisions of the dorsal vein of the penis, and communicates posteriorly with the haemorrhoidal plexus. The prostatic veins and the vesical plexus open into it. The veins forming the plexus are of large size, especially in old men, in whom they often become varicose, and contain phleboliths, or vein-stones. The plexus is surrounded by a kind of capsule formed by the recto-vesical process of the pelvic fascia. It terminates in a single stem on each side which opens into the internal iliac vein. The vesical plexus surrounds the upper fundus, the sides, and the anterior and posterior surfaces of the bladder. It is situated between the muscular coat and the peritoneum, and where the bladder is uncovered by peritoneum external to the muscular coat in the pelvic cellular tissue. It opens into the prostatico-vesical plexus. The haemorrhoidal plexus of veins surrounds the rectum, and is situated at the lower part of that tube between the muscular and mucous coats. The veins of this plexus terminate in the inferior, middle, and superior haemorrhoidal veins. The inferior join the pudic ; the middle accompany the middle haemorrhoidal arteries, and open into the internal iliac and superior haemorrhoidal veins ; the superior form the commencement of the inferior mesenteric vein, and through this the blood gains the portal vein. None of these veins have any valves ; hence the enlargement of the inferior haemorrhoidal veins, a condition known as piles, when the portal vein is obstructed, as from compression of its capillaries in cirrhosis of the liver. Through the haemorrhoidal veins a free communication is established between the systemic and portal system of veins. 5. TRE VEINS OF TEE UPPER EXTREMITY The veins of the upper limb consist of two sets—a superficial and a deep. The superficial veins ramify in the subcutaneous tissue above the deep fascia; the deep accompany the arteries, and have practically the same relations as those vessels. The superficial and deep veins communicate at frequent intervals through the intermuscular veins which run between the muscles and perforate the deep fascia. Both sets of veins are provided with valves, but the valves are more numerous in the deep than in the superficial. There is usually a valve where the deep veins join the superficial. The superficial veins are larger than the deep, and take the greater share in returning the blood. I. THE SUPEBFICIAL VEINS OF THE UFPEB EXTBEMITY The superficial veins begin in two irregular venous plexuses : one situated on the back of the hand, and the other on the front of the wrist. From the radial side of the dorsal plexus, a single vein, the superficial radial, runs up the forearm as far as the elbow. From the ulnar side of the plexus, two veins course up the inner side of the forearm—the anterior and posterior superficial ulnar veins—and, joining together a little below the bend of the elbow, form a single superficial ulnar vein. From the anterior plexus a vein runs up the middle of the front of the forearm—the superficial median vein—and, after receiving a branch from the deep veins at the bend of the elbow (the deep median), divides into an outer branch (the median cephalic) and an inner branch (the median basilic). The median cephalic runs upwards and outwards to join the superficial radial vein. The united trunk, then known as the cephalic, continues up the outer side of the arm, and opens into the axillary vein. The median basilic runs upwards and inwards to join the(17!) ,sii|)(M-li('i;iJ iiliiiM' vein.

The musculo-ciitaneous nerve passes beneath it, a few fibres of the nerve lying superficial to it. The median basilic vein, the larger of the two divisions of the median vein, runs upwards and inwards across the semilunar fascia of the biceps, by which it is separated from the brachial artery, to the internal bicipital sulcus, where it joins one of the superficial ulnar veins or their united trunk to form the basilic. Fibres of the internal cutaneous nerve pass both in front and behind it. This vein is Fig. 895.—The Bend of the Elbow with the Superficial Veins.

The cephalic vein, formed by the union of the median cephalic with the super- ficial radial vein, courses upwards first in the external bicipital sulcus, and then, in the interval between the pectoralis major and the deltoid, perforates the costo-681 CEPHALIC AND BASILIC coracoid membrane, and, crossing the first part of the axillary artery, opens into the axillary vein. It contains a pair of valves where it joins the axillary vein. Fig. 396.—Superficial Veins and Lymphatics of the Forearm and Arm. Peetoralis major, hooked up .

At the junction of the middle with the lower third of the arm it pierces the deep fascia, and ends by uniting with the inner brachial vena comes to form the axillary vein. II. THE DEEP VEINS OF THE UPPEB EXTBEMITY The deep veins of the upper extremity accompany their corresponding arteries and consequently require no detailed description. There are two veins to each artery below the level of the axilla, known as the companion veins or venae comites. In the leg, as will be afterwards noticed, the ven^ comites of the main arteries extend as far as the knee only. The deep veins all contain numerous valves, and communicate at frequent intervals through intermuscular veins with the superficial. Beginning at the fingers, two minute veins accompany each digital artery along the sides of the fingers, and, uniting at the cleft, form interdigital veins which join the venae comites of the arteries, forming the superficial palmar arch. In like manner the veins accompanying the arteries forming the deep arch receive tributaries corresponding to the branches of that arch. The venae comites from the ulnar side of the superficial and deep arches unite at the spot where the ulnar artery divides into the superficial and deep branch to form two ulnar venae comites ; whilst those on the radial side of the superficial and deep arch accompany the super- ficial volar artery and the termination of the radial artery respectively, and unite at the spot where the superficial volar is given off from the radial artery, to form the radial venae comites. The ulnar and radial venas comites thus formed course up the forearm with their respective arteries, receiving numerous tributaries from the muscles amongst which they run, and giving frequent communications to the super- ficial veins. They finally unite at the bend of the elbow to form the brachial venae comites. The ulnar ven^e comites receive, before joining the radial, the companion veins of the interosseous arteries. At the bend of the elbow the deep veins are connected with the superficial median vein by a short, thick trunk, the deep median vein. The brachial vense comites accompany the brachial artery, the inner vein receiving at the lower border of either the teres major or subscapularis muscle the outer vein and the basilic vein, to form a single axillary vein. The vense comites of the arteries of the arm anastomose with one another by frequent cross branches. The axillary vein is formed by the junction of the inner brachial vena comes with the basilic vein at the lower border of either the teres major or subscapularis muscle. It is a vessel of large size, conveying as it does nearly the whole of the returned blood from the upper extremity. It accompanies the axillary artery through the axilla, lying to its inner side and at the upper part of the space on a slightly lower plane. At the outer border of the first rib it changes its name to the sub- clavian. It has one or two axillary glands in close connection with it, and is liable, if care is not taken, to be wounded in removing these glands when infiltrated with cancer secondary to cancer of the breast. The vein contains a pair of valves, usually placed near the lower border of the subscapularis muscle. It receives in its course through the axilla :—(1) The subscapular veins which accompany the sub- scapular artery ; (2) the circumflex veins accompanying the circumflex arteries ; (3) the long thoracic veins accompanying the long thoracic artery; (4) numerous small veins returning the blood from the axillary glands ; (5) the veins corresponding to the branches of the thoracic axis; and (6) the cephalic vein. The subclavian vein (fig. 329) is the continuation of the axillary. It begins at the outer border of the first rib, and terminates by joining the internal jugular toSUBCLAVIAN—INTEBNAL SAPHENOUS 683 form the innominate vein opposite the outer part of the sterno-clavicular articulation. It lies anterior to the subclavian artery and on a lower plane, and is separated from the artery in the second part of its course by the scalenus anticus muscle. The subclavian vein, just before the spot where it is joined by the external jugular, contains a pair of valves. Tributaries.—Near the outer border of the sterno-mastoid muscle it receives the external jugular vein. Occasionally the cephalic vein, or a branch from the cephalic (the jugulo-cephalic), passes over the clavicle to the subclavian (fig. 396). Chief variations.—(1) The subclavian vein may run on a higher plane than usual, lying even above the artery. (2) It may pass with the artery behind the scalenus anticus. (3) It may run behind the scalenus anticus and the artery in front of that muscle. (4) It may split and enclose the scalenus anticus. (5) It may pass between the clavicle and the sub- clavius. (6) It may receive directly the transverse cervical, the suprascapular, the anterior jugular, or the cephalic vein, or the vense comites of the brachial artery. 6. THE VEINS OF THE LOWER EXTREMITY The veins of the lower extremity are divided into the superficial and the deep. The superficial veins lie in the subcutaneous tissue superficial to the deep fascia, through which they receive numerous communicating branches from the deep veins. They are collected chiefly into two main trunks, which, beginning on the foot, extend upwards, one lying antero-internally, and the other postero- externally. The former finally joins the femoral vein by passing through the deep fascia at the groin; the latter the popliteal by perforating the fascia at the ham. The deep veins, on the other hand, accompany their corresponding arteries. Below the knee there are two veins to each artery; above it, excepting at the back of the thigh, there is only one vein to each artery. All the veins of the lower limb have valves which are more numerous than in the veins of the upper extremity, and in the deep than in the superficial veins. I. THE SUPEBFIGIAL VEINS OF THE LOWEB EXTBEMITY The superficial veins of the lower limb are collected into two main trunks. One, the long or internal saphenous, which is placed antero-internally ; the other, the short or external saphenous, which is placed postero-externally. These veins commence on the dorsum of the foot in an irregular arch, which stretches across the instep with its convexity towards the toes. The arch receives branches from the four outer toes and dorsum of the foot, and one branch of somewhat larger size than the rest from the inner side of the great toe. It also communicates with the ven^ comites accompanying the dorsal artery of the foot (fig. 397). The long or internal saphenous vein commences on the inner side of the foot at the inner end of the above described venous arch,^and, after receiving branches from the sole which join it by turning over the inner border of the foot, passes upwards in front of the inner ankle, and then obliquely upwards and backwards about a finger's breadth from the posterior border of the tibia in company with the internal saphenous nerve, which becomes superficial just below the knee. Continuing its course upwards, it passes behind the internal condyle, and then runs upwards and somewhat outwards on the inner side of the front of the thigh to about an inch and a half below Poupart's ligament, where, after receiving the superficial circumflexTHE VEINS 684EXTERNAL SAPHENOUS 685 iliac, superficial epigastric, and superficial external pudic veins, it dips through the saphenous opening in the fascia lata, and ends in the femoral vein. In its course up the leg and thigh it receives numerous unnamed cutaneous branches, and at variable intervals communicates with the deep veins. Just before it passes through the saphenous opening, it often receives a large vein (external femoral cutaneous) formed by the union of several of the cutaneous veins .on the upper and outer part of the thigh, and a second vein (the internal femoral cutaneous) formed by the union of the cutaneous veins from the inner and back part of the thigh. The long saphenous vein contains from ten to twenty valves. The short or external saphenous vein begins at the outer end of the venous arch, or plexus, on the dorsum of the foot. After receiving branches from the sole, which turn over the outer border of the foot, it passes behind the outer ankle, and then upwards and inwards, lying at first along the outer side of the tendo Achillis, afterwards along the back of the calf, in company with the external or short saphenous nerve, to about the lower part of the centre of the popliteal space, where it perforates the deep fascia, and, sinking between the two heads of the gastrocnemius, opens into the popliteal vein. As it passes up the calf between the superficial and deep fascia, it receives numerous cutaneous veins from the heel, and the outer side and back part of the leg, and communicates at intervals, through transverse or intermuscular branches, with the deep veins (venae comites) accom- panying the peroneal artery. Just before perforating the deep fascia, it receives a large descending branch from the lower and back part of the thigh, and sends upwards and inwards a communicating vein to the long saphenous. A small offshoot from the inferior sural branch of the popliteal artery accompanies the vein for a short distance down the back of the calf. The short saphenous vein contains from nine to twelve valves. II. THE DEEP VEINS OF THE LOWEB EXTREMITY The deep veins of the lower extremity accompany the arteries, and have received corresponding names. From the foot to the knee there are two veins to each artery. These veins run on either side of the corresponding artery, and communicate at frequent intervals with each other across it They are known as the ven^e comites. From the knee upwards there is a single vein to each artery, except at the back of the thigh and in the gluteal region, where there are com- monly two. The veins of the foot and leg.—The venae comites of the internal and ex- ternal plantar arteries, after receiving small veins corresponding to the branches of these vessels, unite, beneath the abductor hallucis muscle, to form the venae comites of the posterior tibial artery. These, again, receive, at the spot where the peroneal artery is given off from the posterior tibial, the ven^ comites of the peroneal artery, which are formed in like manner by the confluence of the various veins corresponding to the branches of that vessel. Opposite the lower border of the popliteus muscle, the posterior tibial veins unite with the anterior tibial veins, which pass through the upper part of the interosseous membrane with the anterior tibial artery, to form the popliteal. The anterior tibial veins are the continuation of the ven^ comites of the dorsal artery of the foot, which, in their turn, are formed by the confluence of the veins accompanying its various branches. The anterior tibial venae comites thus formed run with the anterior tibial artery up the front of the leg, and, after passing through the interosseous membrane along with the artery, join the posterior tibial veins to form a single popliteal. All these veins contain numerous valves, and communicate, by means of inter- muscular branches, with the superficial veins.686 TRE VEINS The popliteal vein is formed by the confluence of the ven^e comites of the anterior and posterior tibial arteries at the lower border of the popliteus, and extends upwards to the opening in the adductor magnus at the junction of the middle and lower third of the thigh, where it changes its name to femoral. It accompanies the popliteal artery, lying superficial to it in the whole of its course, and tightly bound down to it by its fascial sheath. At the lower part of the space it is a little internal to the artery, but, crossing the vessel obliquely as it ascends, lies a little external to it at the upper part of the space. The internal popliteal nerve lies superficial to the vein, being external to it above, then on it, and then a little to its inner side. The popliteal vein contains two or three valves. The chief variations of the popliteal are :—(1) It may lie between the artery and the bone. (2) It may be double through a part or the whole of the popliteal space. (3) Two veins by frequently uniting in front and behind the artery may form a kind of plexus around the vessel. (4) It may be shorter than usual in consequence of a high union of the tibial venge comites. The femoral vein, the continuation of the popliteal upwards, extends from the tendinous opening in the adductor magnus to an inch and a half below Poupart's ligament where it joins the profunda vein to form the common femoral vein. In this course its relations are similar to those of the superficial femoral artery. As the vein passes through Hunter's canal, it lies behind and a little external to the artery. At the apex of Scarpa's triangle it is still posterior to the artery, but gradually passes to the inner side as it ascends through that space. It contains three pairs of valves. The close connection of the vein to the artery should be remembered in the operation of ligature. The sheath should be opened on its inner side, that is, well over the artery, and the point of the aneurysm needle kept closely applied to the artery lest it perforate the overlapping vein. Tributaries.—(1) The venae comites of the anastomotica magna artery ; (2) the vense comites corresponding to the muscular branches of the femoral. The profunda or deep femoral vein accompanies the profunda or deep femoral artery, and receives the venae comites corresponding to its various branches. Unlike the other veins of the lower extremity, it lies in front of its companion artery, and is at first a little internal to it. It terminates by joining the super- ficial femoral vein about an inch and a half below Poupart's ligament in the angle between the femoral and profunda arteries. It contains five valves. The common femoral vein is a short thick trunk corresponding to the common femoral artery. It is formed by the confluence of the superficial femoral and profunda veins about an inch and a half below Poupart's ligament, and is con- tinued upwards to the lower border of that structure, where it takes the name of external iliac. It lies on the same plane as the common femoral artery, but internal to that vessel, from which it is separated by a delicate prolongation of fascia stretching between the front and back layers of the femoral sheath. Internally, it is separated by a similar septum of fascia from the crural canal. It usually contains two valves : one just above the junction with the profunda vein, the other just below Poupart's ligament (fig. 372). Tributary.—The long saphenous vein which reaches it by passing through the saphenous opening in the deep fascia. Chief variations.—(1) The femoral vein may be double in part or in whole of its length. (2) It may split into two and embrace the femoral artery. (3) It may pass through the adductor magnus above the femoral artery and run separate from the artery until it joins the profunda vein to form the common femoral vein. (4) It may run with the sciatic nerve and pierce the adductor magnus at the level of the lesser trochanter. When this occurs the femoral artery is usually very small, and the sciatic artery is the chief nutrient vessel of the thigh. The external iliac vein is the continuation upwards of the common femoral. Beginning at the lower border of Poupart's ligament it accompanies the externalEXTERNAL ILIAC 687 iliac artery upwards and inwards along the brim of the pelvis, lying at first on the horizontal ramus of the pubes, and then on the psoas muscle. It terminates in the common iliac vein by joining the internal iliac vein behind the internal iliac artery opposite the lower border of the sacro-iliac synchondrosis. It lies at first internal to the external iliac artery, and on the left side remains internal to the artery throughout its course. On the right side, however, as it ascends, it gradually gets a little behind the artery. It contains one or two valves. Tributaries.—(1) The deep epigastric vein, formed by the union of the venas comites of the deep epigastric artery, joins the external iliac just above Poupart's Hgament. (2) The deep circumflex iliac vein, which is formed in the same way by the confluence of the vense comites of the deep circumflex iliac artery, joins the external iliac vein a little higher.THE LYMPHATICS T1HE lymphatics consist of lymphatic vessels and lymphatic glands. The lymphatic vessels carry lymph, and the lymphatics of the intestine chyle as well whilst digestion is going on. The chyle-carrying lymphatics are generally known as lacteals. The lymphatic glands are situated at certain spots in the com-se j of the lymphatic vessels. The lymphatic vessels ultimately terminate either in 1 the left or right lymphatic duct. The former, some eighteen inches in length, ] known as the thoracic duct, begins at the confluence of certain lymphatics in the abdomen, passes through the thorax, and terminates in the left innominate vein at the confluence of the left internal jugular and subclavian veins. It receives | the lymphatics of both lower extremities, the lymphatics of the abdomen, except | those from the convex surface of the liver, the lymphatics from the left half of the j thorax, the left half of the head and neck, and the left upper extremity. The right i lymphatic duct is a short vessel a little less than an inch in length. It receives | the lymphatics from the convex surface of the liver, the right half of the thorax, j the right side of the head and neck, and the right upper extremity. It ends in the right innominate vein at the confluence of the right internal jugular and subclavian veins. The thoracic duct, or left lymphatic duct, is described with the Lymphatics of THE Thoeax ; the right lymphatic duct with the Lymphatics of the Head and Neck. THE LYMPHATICS OF THE HEAD AND NECK The lymphatics of the head and neck are divided into the superficial and the deep. The superficial roughly folloAv the course of the superficial veins. Streaming down the scalp and face, they enter the neck through corresponding groups of superficial glands, and then converge to join the superficial cervical chain and in part the deep cervical chain of glands which are situated along the course of the external and internal jugular veins respectively. The deep lymphatics of the head and neck follow roughly the course of the deep arte- ries. They include the lymphatics from the interior of the cranium ; from the orbit; from the interior of the nose and mouth; from the tongue; from the pharynx, larynx, and upper part of the trachea and oesophagus, and from the thyroid gland. After passing through certain glands in their course, they terminate chiefly in the deep cervical chain of glands. The deep cervical chain of glands, after receiving the lymphatics from the superficial chain, ends in the thoracic duct on the left side, and in the right lymphatic duct on the right side.SUPJEBFICIAL LYMPHATICS OF HEAD AND NECK 689 I. THE SUPEBFICIAL LYMPHATIC VESSELS AND GLANDS OF THE HEAD AND NECK A. The Supeeficial Lymphatic Vessels The superficial lymphatic vessels may be subdivided into the superficial lymphatics of the scalp, the face, and the neck (fig. 398). 1. The superficial lymphatic vessels of the scalp follow roughly the course of the superficial veins. Thus there is (1) a posterior or occipital set, which course downwards over the occipital bone to the occipital, or suboccipital glands as they are sometimes called ; (2) a posterolateral or posterior auricular set, which course downwards behind the ear, and end in the posterior auricular or sterno-mastoid glands ; (3) an antero-lateral or temporal set, which accompany the superficial temporal vein in front of the ear, and end in the parotid lymphatic glands; and (4) an anterior or frontal set, which course downwards over the frontal bone and end in the facial lymphatics. 2. The superficial lymphatic vessels of the face—continuous at the root of the nose with the frontal set of lymphatics descending from the scalp—course downwards and backwards with the facial vein, receiving tributaries from the inner half of the eyelids, the side of the nose, the contiguous portions of the cheek, and the upper and lower lips. They end in the submaxillary lymphatic glands beneath the lower jaw. The lymphatics from the outer part of the eyelids and the outer part of the cheek run backwards and slightly downwards to the parotid lymphatic glands. 3. The superficial lymphatic vessels of the neck form a plexus in the sub- cutaneous tissues of the neck. They communicate with the superficial lymphatics of the scalp and face, and with some of the superficial lymphatics of the upper part of the thorax. They end in the superficial cervical chain of lymphatic glands. B. The Superficial Lymphatic Glands The superficial lymphatic glands of the head and neck may be divided into two sets, a transverse and a vertical (fig. 398). 1. The transverse occur in groups in the course of a line drawn from the occiput to the mastoid process, and thence along the zygoma and beneath the body of the lower jaw to the symphysis. They receive as afferent vessels the lymphatics of the scalp and face. Their efferent vessels pass into the superficial and deep cervical chains. They are named :—(1) The occipital, or suboccipital; (2) the posterior auricular, or sterno-mastoid ; (3) the parotid; (4) the buccal; and (5) the submaxillary. (1) The occipital or suboccipital glands are situated at the back of the head, beneath the skin, just below the superior curved line of the occipital bone and over the insertion of the complexus muscle. They receive the lymphatic vessels from the back of the head. Their efferent vessels discharge into the superficial lymphatic glands of the neck. It is these glands which perhaps more especially are found enlarged in secondary syphilis. (2) The posterior auricular or sterno-mastoid glands, situated over the inser- tion of the sterno-mastoid muscle behind the ear, receive the posterior auricular lymphatics. Their efferent vessels discharge into the superficial cervical lymphatics. (3) The parotid lymphatic glands are situated just in front of the ear over the parotid salivary gland, in the substance of which one or more are embedded. They receive the temporal set of lymphatic vessels, and the lymphatics from the external parts of the eyelid and posterior and greater part of the cheek. They Y YTHE LYMPHATICS 690 discharge, partly into the submaxillary glands, and partly into the superficial cervical chain. (4) The buccal lymphatic glands are situated on the surface of the buccinator. Some of the facial lymphatics pass through these on their Avay to the submaxillary glands. (5) The submaxillary lymphatic glands are situated in the digastric triangle, beneath the body of the lower jaw. They vary from eight to twelve in number.

Their efferent vessels terminate partly in the deep, and partly in the superficial cervical lymphatic glands. Two or three glands situated in the middle line between the anterior bellies of the digastric muscles are sometimes distinguished as the suprahyoid lymphatic glands.691 DEEP LYMPHATICS OF HEAD AND NECK 2. The vertical set of superficial glands of the neck—four to six in number, known as the superficial cervical chain—are situated chiefly in the posterior triangle of the neck, along the course of the external jugular vein, between the platysma and the deep fascia. Small superficial glands are also found in the front of the neck between the hyoid bone and the sternum, and posteriorly over the trapezius muscle. I The superficial cervical glands receive the vessels from the occipital glands, and from the posterior auricular glands, and part of those from the parotid and submaxillary glands. They also receive the lymphatics from the integuments of I the neck and from the external ear. Their efferent vessels open into the deep chain of cervical glands. II. THE DEEP LYMPHATIC VESSELS AND GLANDS OF THE HEAD AND NECK A. The Deep Lymphatic Vessels of the Head and Neck The deep lymphatic vessels of the head and neck may be divided into the lymphatics of the cranium, the orbit, the temporal and zygomatic fossa9, the nose, the mouth and tongue, the pharynx, the larynx, the upper part of the oesophagus and trachea, and the thyroid body. They roughly follow the course of the deep arteries, and terminate in the deep cervical chain of lymphatic glands which accom- pany the common carotid artery and internal jugular vein. 1. The lymphatics from the interior of the cranium are divided into the •meningeal and the cerebral. The meningeal accompany the meningeal arteries •through the various foramina in the base of the skull, and terminate in the deep cervical chain. The cerebral lymphatics pass in like manner with the cerebral vessels (the internal carotid and vertebral arteries, and the internal jugular vein), through the corresponding foramina in the base of the skull, and join the deep lymphatic chain. The origin of the cerebral lymphatics and the •lymphatics from the choroid plexus are described in the Anatomy of the Bkain (page 717). 2. The lymphatics of the orbit pass with the infraorbital vein into the spheno- maxillary fossa, and thence with the internal maxillary vein into the internal maxillary and deep parotid glands. (For description of the lymphatics of the eyeball, see page 889.) 3. The lymphatics from the temporal and zygomatic fossae run with the arteries in these situations, and, after passing through the internal maxillary glands, I join the deep cervical chain. 4. The lymphatics from the interior of the nose accompany the arteries supplying that cavity, and terminate, in part in the lymphatics of the pharynx, but chiefly in the deep cervical chain. They communicate, through the lymphatic spaces which surround the olfactory nerves, with the subdural and subarachnoid lymph-spaces of the cranium. 5. The lymphatics of the mouth and tongue.—The lymphatics from the floor j of the mouth pass through the mylo-hyoid muscle into the submaxillary lymphatic I glands. The lymphatics of the lips pass with the superficial lymphatics, partly into the submaxillary glands, and partly into the deep cervical chain. The ^ lymphatics of the deep surface of the cheek and of the roof of the mouth join the internal maxillary lymphatic glands. The lymphatics of the tongue run back- wards with the ranine vein, and, after passing through several small lingual glands ! on the hyo-glossus muscle, join the deep cervical chain. The lymphatics of the front part of the tongue pass with the lymphatics of the floor of the mouth, ' through the mylo-hyoidean muscles into the submaxillary glands. Y Y 2THE LYMPHATICS 692 6. The lymphatics of the pharynx run along the course of the pharyngeal arteries and enter the upper set of deep cervical glands. Those from the upper part of the pharynx pass through the post-pharyngeal gland. The lymphatics of the tonsil open into the submaxillary glands near the angle of the jaw. 7. The lymphatics of tha larynx join the deep cervical glands. Those above the glottis pierce the thyro-hyoid membrane, and end in the upper set of the deep cervical glands ; those below the glottis perforate the crico-thyroid membrane, and, after passing through one or more small laryng^eal glands at the lower part of the larynx on its anterior or lateral aspect, enter the lower set of the deep cervical glands. 8. The lymphatics of the upper part of the oesophagus and trachea join the lower glands of the deep cervical chain. 9. The lymphatics of the thyroid body accompany the thyroid arteries, and end in part in the upper and in part in the lower glands of the deep cervical chain. B. The Deep Lymphatic Glands of the Head and Neck 1. The deep lymphatic glands of the head are few in number. They are the lingual, the internal maxillary, and the post-pharyngeal. (1) The lingual, two to four in number, are situated on the outer surface of the hyo-glossus and genio-hyo-glossus muscles. They receive lymphatics from the upper surface and posterior part of the substance of the tongue. Their efferent vessels terminate in the superior glands of the deep cervical chain. (2) The internal maxillary or deep facial glands, three to six in number, are situated by the side of the pharynx immediately behind the buccinator muscle. They receive the lymphatics from the orbit, the nose, the temporal and spheno- maxillary fossse, the upper jaw, the palate, and the pharynx. Their efferent vessels join the superior glands of the deep cervical chain. (3) The post-pharyngeal gland is situated behind the pharynx on the rectus capitis anticus major near the base of the skull. It receives lymphatics from the upper part of the pharynx, from the nose, and from the deep prevertebral muscles. 2. The deep lymphatic glands of the neck are divided into the upper and the lower. The upper set extend along the course of the internal jugular vein from the base of the skull to about the level of the thyroid cartilage. They receive the lymphatics from the interior of the cranium above ; the lymphatics from the deep muscles of the upper part of the neck behind ; and the lymphatics from the internal maxillary glands, the posterior half of the tongue, the middle portion of the pharynx, the upper part of the larynx, the upper part of the thyroid body, and some of the efferent vessels from the submaxillary lymphatic glands in front and internally. Their efferent vessels pass downwards to the lower deep cervical glands. The lower deep cervical glands follow the course of the internal jugular vein from the thyroid cartilage to near the clavicle. They receive the lymphatics from the lower part of the neck, the efferent vessels from the superior set of deep cervical glands, the lymphatics from the lower part of the larynx, the lower part of the thyroid body, the upper part of the trachea and oesophagus, and the efferent vessels from the superficial cervical glands. Their efferent vessels end in the jugular lymphatic trunk, which unites with the subclavian lymphatic trunk, on the right side to form the right lymphatic duct, and on the left side to end in the thoracic duct. The right jugular trunk may also receive the lymphatics coming from the right half of the superior and anterior mediastina. The right lymphatic duct.—The right lymphatic duct is a short vessel from half to three-quarters of an inch long. It receives the lymphatics from the right side of the head and neck, from the right upper extremity, most of the lymphaticsLYMPHATICS OF UPPER EXTBEMITY 693 from the right side of the thorax, and part of the lymphatics from the convex surface of the liver. It passes downwards and inwards from its formation at the union of the subclavian and jugular lymphatic trunks, and ends at the confluence of the right internal jugular and subclavian veins. Its entrance is guarded by a double valve. THE LYMPHATICS OF THE UPPER EXTREMITY The lymphatics of the upper extremity—consisting of both lymphatic vessels and lymphatic glands—are arranged in two sets, a superficial and a deep. The former are situated in the subcutaneous tissue between the skin and the deep or muscular fascia, the latter along the course of the arteries of the limb. Both sets converge as they approach the axilla, and unite in the axillary glands. The efferent vessels of these glands form one or more trunks, which open, on the left side, into the thoracic duct, and, on the right side, into the right lymphatic duct. I. THE SUPEPvFICIAL LYMPHATIC VESSELS AND GLANDS OF THE UPPER EXTREMITY 1. The superficial lymphatic vessels begin around the matrix of the nail and in the pulp of the finger. Thence they run upwards, in the form of four main channels, along the side of the finger—two on the dorsal and two on the palmar aspect. The palmar set end on the convexity of a lymphatic palmar arch. From the arch, lymphatic vessels run up the forearm, more or less in two sets—an outer and an inner—roughly following the course of the superficial veins; a third or median set, starting as a plexiform arrangement in front of the wrist, runs up between the other two. The communication, however, between the three main sets of vessels is so free that, when they are minutely injected, the front of the forearm appears covered with a dense plexus of lymphatics (fig. 899). The dorsal set of digital lymphatics ends in a plexus on the back of the hand. From this plexus numerous lymphatic vessels stream up the back of the forearm, and, winding round the inner and outer borders respectively of the limb, join the lymphatics on the anterior aspect. From the bend of the elbow the lymphatics run up the arm, the greater number following the course of the basilic vein, and, dipping beneath the pectoralis major, converge to end in the axillary glands. The lymphatics from the outer side of the arm run in chief part obliquely across the biceps, towards the axilla ; but a few accompany the cephalic vein to the infraclavicular lymphatic glands. The lymphatics over the deltoid also mainly end in these glands. 2. The superficial lymphatic glands are few in number. There are none, as a rule, below the bend of the elbow. Occasionally there is one at the bend of the elbow, and constantly two or three are found above the internal condyle (epitrochlear glands), in the course of the lymphatic vessels running with the basilic vein. II. THE DEEP LYMPHATIC VESSELS AND GLANDS OF THE UPPER EXTBEMITY 1. The deep lymphatic vessels accompany the arteries of the upper extremity. Hence in the forearm they are found along the course of the radial, the ulnar, the anterior interosseous, and the posterior interosseous arteries. At the bend of the694 THE LYMPHATICS Fig. 399.—The Superficial Lymphatics of the UppePv Limb and Axillary Glands.

They communicate with the superficial lymphatics at the wrist. 2. The deep lymphatic glands.—A few small glands are occasionally found in the course of the lymphatic vessels accompanying the arteries of the forearm, and, more often, a few in the course of those accompanying the brachial artery. But the first important set of deep glands is met with in the axilla. The axillary glands are numerous and of large size. They are about twelve in number. They are arranged in four chief sets—a median set, three or more in number, situated along the course of the axillary artery and vein (axillary glands proper); an inner or anterior set, four or five in number, situated below the greater pectoral muscles in the course of the long thoracic artery, on the outer surface of the serratus magnus (pectoral glands) ; a posterior or external set, usually two in number, situated along the course of the subscapular artery, under cover of the latissimus dorsi (subscapular glands); and a superior set, usually two in number, situated just below the clavicle close to the cephalic vein, upon the costo-coracoid membrane in the fossa beneath the pectoralis major and deltoid (subclavian or infraclavicular glands). The axillary glands proper, or the glands along the course of the axillary artery and vein, receive the larger number of lymphatics from the arm. The pectoral glands receive the lymphatics from the mammary gland, the side of the chest, and the integument of the upper portion of the abdominal wall. The subscapular glands receive the lymphatics from the integuments of the back. The infraclavicular glands receive the lymphatics from the outer part of the arm and integuments covering the deltoid. They communicate, above with the cervical lymphatics, and below with the other glands in the axilla. The efferent vessels from all these glands run upwards along the subclavian vein, and enter the neck either as four , distinct trunks, or as a single trunk (the axillary lymphatic trunk), and terminate i on the left side in the thoracic duct, and on the right side in the right lymphatic duct. The communication between the glands in the axilla is very free. Thus, in I secondary infiltration following carcinoma of the breast, although the pectoral glands may at first be alone aftected, the remaining sets generally become also involved. THE LYMPHATICS OF THE THORAX The lymphatics of the thorax may be divided into the parietal, which ramify in the thoracic walls ; and the visceral, which receive the lymph from the thoracic viscera. The thoracic duct, which conveys the lymph from the lower extremities and from the greater part of the abdomen, passes through the posterior mediastinum on its way to the confluence of the left internal jugular and subclavian veins at the root of the neck, and is described here with the lymphatics of the thorax. I 1. THE PARIETAL LYMPHATIC VESSELS AND GLANDS OF THE THORAX I 1. The parietal lymphatic vessels are divided into the superficial and the deep. I The superficial parietal lymphatics ramify beneath the integuments, over the i pectoralis major in front, the serratus magnus laterally, and the trapezius and696 THE LYMPHATICS latissimus dorsi behind. They all converge towards the axilla, and end in the axillary glands. The lymphatics of the mammary gland end for the most part in the pectoral set of the axillary glands, but those from the inner portion of the gland pass through the second, third, and fourth intercostal spaces into the internal mammary lymphatic chain of glands, and thus open into the thoracic duct on the left, and the right lymphatic duct on the right side. According to Macalister, the lymphatics from the nipple and areola pass more deeply into the axilla, and end in one of the axillary glands, placed nearer to the clavicle than the pectoral set. The deep parietal lymphatics are subdivided into (1) the intercostal and (2) the diaphragmatic. (1) The intercostal lymphatics accompany the intercostal arteries and receive the lymph from the intercostal muscles and the parietal pleura. Those in the anterior part of the intercostal space run forwards and end in the internal mammary or anterior intercostal lymphatic glands. Those in the posterior part of the space run backwards, and—after receiving the dorsal lymphatic vessels which accompany the dorsal branches of the intercostal arteries between the transverse processes of the vertebra, and return the lymph from the muscles of the back and from the spinal canal—end in the intercostal or posterior intercostal lymphatic glands. (2) The diaphragmatic lymphatics follow the vessels of the diaphragm. They terminate, anteriorly in the internal mammary and anterior mediastinal lymphatic glands ; postero-laterally in the lower intercostal lymphatics and in the lymphatics accompanying the musculo-phrenic artery ; and posteriorly in the posterior medi- astinal glands. The lymphatics from the vertebral portion of the diaphragm end in the lumbar glands (see Lymphatics of Abdomen, page 701). Some of the lymphatics from the right side join the hepatic lymphatics. 2. The parietal lymphatic glands are also divided into the superficial and the deep. The superficial parietal glands.—The three or four glands along the lower border of the pectoralis major, described here as the pectoral set of the axillary glands, are by some authors classed as superficial thoracic glands. They receive the lymphatics from the front of the chest, and some of the lymphatics of the mammary gland. There is also occasionally a superficial gland a little below the ensiform cartilage called the epigastric gland. It receives, when present, some of the lymphatics from the lower anterior chest walls and upper part of the abdomen. The deep parietal glands are:—(1) The internal mammary, sternal, or anterior intercostal; and (2) the intercostal or posterior intercostal. (1) The internal mammary, sternal, or anterior intercostal glands lie along the course of the internal mammary artery behind the costal cartilages of the true ribs. There is usually one gland corresponding to each intercostal space. These glands receive the lymphatics from the anterior part of the intercostal spaces, the lymphatics ascending with the superior epigastric artery from the abdominal walls, the lymphatics accompanying the musculo-phrenic artery from the diaphragm and lower intercostal spaces, and the lymphatics from the inner portion of the mammary gland. The efferent vessels from the uppermost glands join the thoracic and right lymphatic ducts respectively, but some of the efferent vessels of the lower glands join the anterior mediastinal glands. (2) The intercostal or posterior intercostal lymphatic glands lie in the posterior end of each intercostal space about the level of the heads of the ribs. They receive the lymphatics accompanying the intercostal vessels from the posterior parts of the intercostal spaces, and the lymphatics from the deep muscles of the back, and from the spinal canal. The lowermost also receive some of the lymphatics from the diaphragm. On the lefi: side their efferent vessels open into the thoracic duct. On the right side the efferent vessels from the lower glands also join the thoracic697 VISCEBAL LYMPHATICS OF THOBAX duct, but the vessels from the upper glands may join the efferent vessels from the bronchial glands (the bronchio-mediastinal trunk) and open into the right lymphatic duct. II. THE VISCEBAL LYMPHATIC VESSELS AND GLANDS * OF THE THOBAX 1. The visceral lymphatics of the thorax include those from the heart and pericardium, the lungs and visceral pleura, the oesophagus and the thymus gland, with the glands into which these lymphatics respectively open—namely, the anterior mediastinal, the superior mediastinal, the posterior mediastinal, and the bronchial. The lymphatics of the pericardium end in front in the anterior mediastinal and superior mediastinal glands, and behind in the posterior mediastinal glands. The lymphatics of the heart begin at the apex, and follow the coronary vessels to the base, where they leave the pericardium, and unite to form a right and left trunk. The former passes over the arch of the aorta, then through one of the superior mediastinal or cardiac glands, and thence backwards to the trachea, on which it runs to join the right lymphatic duct at the root of the neck. The left trunk courses along the pulmonary artery, and, at the bifurcation of that vessel, passes through one of the posterior mediastinal glands behind the arch of the aorta, and thence runs up the left side of the trachea to end in the thoracic duct. The lymphatics of the visceral pleura and lung form a superficial set beneath the pleura, and a deep set which accompanies the pulmonary vessels and bronchial tubes. At the root of the lung the superficial join the deep, which then enter the bronchial glands. The lymphatics of the thoracic portion of the oesophagus begin as a plexus between the mucous membrane and the muscular coat, perforate the latter, and terminate in the posterior mediastinal glands. The lymphatics of the thymus terminate in the superior mediastinal glands. 2. The visceral lymphatic glands are the anterior mediastinal, the superior mediastinal, the posterior mediastinal, and the bronchial. The anterior mediastinal or sternal glands lie in front of the pericardium behind the sternum in the loose tissue of the anterior mediastinum. They receive the lymphatics from the antero-median portion of the diaphragm, the front of the pericardium and heart, some of the efferent vessels from the lower internal mammary lymphatic glands, and the lymphatics from the convex surface of the right lobe of the liver. Their efferent vessels pass upwards to the superior mediastinal glands. The superior mediastinal or cardiac glands lie in front of the upper part of the pericardium, the arch of the aorta, and left innominate vein. They receive the lymphatics from the anterior mediastinal glands, from the upper and front part of the pericardium and right side of the heart, and from the thymus gland. Their efferent vessels run up the sides of the trachea to join the thoracic duct and right lymphatic duct respectively. The posterior mediastinal glands are situated in the posterior mediastinum along the course of the aorta and oesophagus. They receive lymphatics from the back of the pericardium and left side of the heart, from the oesophagus, from the posterior part of the diaphragm, and a few from the right border of the liver. Their efferent vessels pass chiefly into the thoracic duct; a few into the bronchial glands. The bronchial glands are placed between the divisions of the bronchi at the root of the lung (pulmonary glands), and about the bifurcation of the trachea (tracheal glands). The larger glands, situated at the bifurcation of the trachea, are twenty or thirty in number. They receive the lymphatics from the lung andTHE LYMPHATICS 698 visceral pleura; also some of the lymphatics from the trachea and from the back of the heart and pericardimn, and a few of the efferent vessels of the posterior mediastinal glands. Their efferent vessels, with the efferent vessels of the superior mediastinal or cardiac glands, pass up the sides of the trachea, and on the right side either terminate directly in the right lymphatic duct, or join with the efferent vessels of the intercostal glands to form a common trunk, the broncho-mediastinal trunk, and thus open into the right lymphatic duct«. On the left side they open directly into the thoracic duct, or first form, as on the right side, a broncho- mediastinal trunk. In early life they are of a pinkish colour, but as life advances they become bluish, and later almost black, from the deposit of pigment arrested in them in its passage from the lungs. THE THOKACIC DUCT The thoracic duct begins in the abdomen at the receptaculum chyli opposite the first or second lumbar vertebra, enters the thorax through the aortic opening of the diaphragm, runs up the posterior mediastinum to the right of the aorta, crosses behind the aortic arch, and, leaving the thorax at the superior opening, ascends on the left side of the neck as high as the seventh cervical vertebra, and, finally curving over the apex of the left pleura and subclavian artery, ends in the confluence of the left internal jugular and subclavian veins. The duct is about eighteen inches long, and pursues a tortuous course. It contains many double valves v/hich, when the duct is dilated, cause it to be con- stricted at intervals, and give it somewhat the appearance of a string of beads. The valves are more numerous in the upper than in the lower part of the duct. At its entrance into the innominate vein there are two perfect valves, which efi'ectually prevent any regurgitation of lymph or entrance of blood. The calibre of the duct usually decreases as it ascends through the thorax, but increases again at its upper part. It is least at or about the fifth thoracic vertebra. The thoracic duct conveys the lymph from the lower extremities, the lymph and chyle from the abdomen (except some of the lymph from the convex surface of the liver), the lymph from the left side of the thorax, and some of that from the right side, and the lymph from the left upper extremity and the left side of the head and neck. The relations of the thoracic duct in the abdomen, the thorax, and at the root of the neck, may be considered separately. 1. The abdominal portion of the thoracic duct lies deeply placed behind and between the aorta and the right crus of the diaphragm on the front of the body of the second lumbar vertebra. This part of the duct is dilated into an irregular, sacculated, and fusiform sac, known as the receptaculum chyli, or cistern of Pecquet. It receives the efferent vessels of the lumbar glands, the intestinal lymphatic trunk, and sometimes some of the hepatic and gastric lymphatics. It is thin-walled and contains no valves, and is about an inch and a half long (38 mm.) and about a quarter of an inch in diameter at its widest part (7 mm.). As the duct passes through the aortic opening of the diaphragm, it still lies to the right of the aorta, and has the vena azygos major to its right side. 2. The thoracic portion of the thoracic duct lies at first in the posterior mediastinum between the aorta and the vena azygos major, in front of the seven lower thoracic vertebrae ; but at the level of the fifth thoracic vertebra it passes to the left behind the oesophagus and aortic arch, and enters the superior mediastinum, whence it escapes through the upper aperture of the thorax into the root of the neck. In the posterior mediastinum it has in front of it, from below upwards, the pericardium, the oesophagus, and the arch of the aorta; behind it, the seven lower699 THOBACIG DUCT thoracic vertebrae, the anterior common ligament, the lower right intercostal arteries, the vena azygos minor, and at times one or more of the mid left intercostal veins, and the vena azygos tertia. To its left is the thoracic aorta, and to its right the vena azygos major and the right pleura. In the superior mediastinum it ascends, between the cesophagns and left pleura, to the posterior and left side of the superior thoracic opening. It here has in front of it the first portion of the left subclavian artery, behind it the upper thoracic vertebrae, to its left the pleura, and to its right the oesophagus. Opening into the thoracic portion of the duct are :—the lymphatics from the left half of the thoracic walls ; the efferent vessels from the left anterior mediastinal and intercostal glands; the lymphatics of the left lung and the left side of the heart; the lymphatics of the trachea and oesophagus, and the right lower internal mammary lymphatics. 3. The cervical portion of the thoracic duct ascends as high as the level of the seventh cervical vertebra, and then curves, downwards and forwards, over the apex of the pleura in front of the subclavian artery, scalenus anticus muscle, and vertebral vein, behind the left internal jugular vein, and behind and subsequently external to the left common carotid artery, and, having received the left jugular lymphatic trunk, opens into the left innominate vein at the confluence of the internal jugular and subclavian veins. The cervical portion receives the lymphatics from the left upper extremity and left side of the head and neck. The chief variations in the thoracic duct.—(1) The thoracic duct may be double ; when this is the case, the left duct may end normally in the left innominate vein, and the right in the correspondin;^ situation on the right side ; or the two ducts may unite at the root of the neck, and open into the left innominate vein. (2) The reduplication ma}" be incom- plete. Thus : (rt) The duct may at first be single, but divide into two separate vessels at a variable distance from its termination, and then (i) one branch of the duct may enter the left confluence of veins at the root of the neck ; the other the right confluence, a normal condition in some animals; or one may enter the confluence of veins in the normal manner, the other either the subclavian or internal jugular vein; or (ii) the two branches ma}" reunite—this is a frequent variety, and is regarded as a normal condition by some anatomists. (6) It may break up into several branches in its com-se through the thorax, forming a plexus of vessels, which subsequently reimite into a single duct. (3) The thoracic duct may lie altogether to the left side of the aorta, and terminate as normal. (4) The duct may open into the confluence of the subclavian and internal jugular veins on the right side, an abnormal arrangement which may occur under the following condi- tions :—{a) when the viscera are transposed ; (&) when there is a right aortic arch without transposition of viscera ; and (c) when the vessels and viscera are normal. (5) The duct may end in the vena azygos maj or. THE LYMPHATICS OF THE ABDOMEN AND PELVIS The lymphatics of the abdomen and pelvis may be divided into the parietal, which ramify in the abdominal and pelvic walls; and the visceral, which receive the lymph from the pelvic viscera, and the lymph and chyle from the abdominal viscera. I. THE PARIETAL LYMPHATIC VESSELS AND GLANDS OF THE ABDOMEN AND PELVIS . 1. The parietal lymphatic vessels may be subdivided into the superficial, which ramify beneath the skin in the subcutaneous tissue, and include the lymphatics of the skin of the penis and scrotum and of the external genital700 THE LYMPHATICS organs in the female ; and into the deep, which accompany the deep arteries of the abdominal and pelvic walls. The former for the most part end in the superficial inguinal glands ; the latter in the lumbar glands. (1) The superficial parietal lymphatics.—^The superficial parietal lymphatics of the abdominal walls are situated between the skin and the abdommal muscles. Those from the front of the abdomen, below the level of the umbilicus, pass downwards along the course of the superficial epigastric artery and veins, and end in the superficial inguinal glands. The lymphatics from the upper part of the front of the abdomen, above the level of the umbilicus, pass upwards and outwards with the lymphatics from the front and side of the chest to the axillary glands. The lymphatics from the lateral abdominal walls run, in part over the crest of the ilium, in the course of the superficial circumflex iliac artery and veins, into the outer superficial inguinal glands, and in part follow the course of the lumbar and ilio-lumbar arteries, and, after perforating the abdominal muscles, end in the lateral lumbar glands. The superficial lymphatics from the lower part of the back and from the gluteal reg^ion for the most part pass outwards over the gluteal muscles to end in the outermost superficial inguinal glands ; but those from the region of the anus follow the course of the perineal lymphatics through the fork to the innermost superficial inguinal glands. The superficial lymphatics of the penis begin in the prepuce, and thence pass backwards to the corona glandis, where they form a ring around the glans. This ring receives the superficial lymphatics from the glans, and the lymphatics from the anterior two-thirds of the urethra which run from behind forwards. From the glans three main lymphatic channels run backwards under the integuments of the penis, one on the dorsum, and one on each side of the organ. At the root of the penis the dorsal lymphatic vessel divideslinto a right and left branch, each branch passing with the lateral lymphatic vessel of the corresponding side to the superficial inguinal glands. The deep lymphatics of the penis pass with the dorsal vein into the pelvis, where they join the lymphatic glands about the internal iliac artery. The lymphatics of the scrotum in the male, and of the parts corresponding thereto in the female, and the lymphatics of the other external generative organs in the female, run with the superficial external pudic arteries to the superficial inguinal glands. It will be noted that the lymphatics of the testicle pass with the spermatic artery to the lumbar glands. The superficial lymphatics of the perinseum run upwards over the adductor muscles, through the fork between the thighs, and join the superficial inguinal glands. (2) The deep parietal lymphatics.—The deep lymphatics of the anterior and lateral abdominal walls accompany the parietal vessels to the back of the abdomen, where they end in the deep glands. Thus some follow the deep epigastric artery to the external iliac glands; others the deep circumflex iliac artery also to the external iliac glands; and others, again, the ilio-lumbar and lumbar arteries to the lateral lumbar glands. The last are also joined by the lymphatics from the muscles of the back and from the spinal cord. The deep lymphatics from the upper part of the abdominal wall pass, with the superior epigastric artery, into the thorax, where they end in the internal mammary lymphatic glands. The deep lymphatics of the pelvic walls accompany the parietal vessels, and hence are found with the obturator, sciatic, gluteal, pudic, and sacral arteries. They end in the glands surrounding the internal iliac artery, and in the sacral glands. 2. The parietal lymphatic glands lie, for the most part, along the back of the abdomen and pelvis, and are known, from their position, as the external iliac, internal iliac, sacral, lumbar, and coeliac glands.LYMPHATICS OF ABDOMEN AND PELVIS 701 The external iliac lymphatic glands lie along the course of the external ihac and common iliac arteries and veins. They are three to five or more in nmnber. They receive the lymphatics from the inguinal glands and femoral glands, and the deep lymphatic vessels accompanying the deep epigastric and deep circum- flex iliac arteries and veins from the anterior and lower abdominal walls. Their efferent vessels join the lumbar glands. They communicate with the internal iliac glands. The internal iliac glands are situated in the course of the internal iliac artery and its branches. They vary from nine to twelve or more in number, the largest being situated at the upper part of the great sciatic foramen. They receive the lymphatics from the muscles of the pelvis and the lymphatics corresponding to the branches of the internal iliac artery. Thus the greater number of the lymphatics from the pelvic viscera, from the deeper parts of the perinasum, and from the hinder and deeper parts of the scrotum or labia majora, the deep lymphatics of the penis and posterior part of the urethra, the deep lymphatics from the gluteal region, and some of the lymphatics from the adductor muscles of the upper part of the thigh, join these glands. Their efferent vessels pass to the lumbar glands. The sacral glands are situated in the hollow of the sacrum, four or five being placed in the meso-rectal folds opposite its promontory. They receive the lymphatics from the rectum and the hinder walls of the pelvis. They join the lumbar glands. The lumbar glands lie beneath the peritoneum, at the back of the abdomen, on the front and sides of the lumbar vertebrae. They are usually divided into three groups, a median and two lateral; but these freely communicate with each other across the aorta and vena cava. The median group (aortic lumbar glands) consists of about six large glands placed along the abdominal aorta and vena cava. They extend from the bifurcation of the aorta to the second lumbar vertebra. The median group receive the efferent vessels of the external and internal iliac and sacral glands, the lymphatics accompanying the spermatic or ovarian vessels from the testicle or ovarian plexus respectively, and the lymphatics of the kidneys, suprarenal bodies, and hinder portion of the diaphragm. They also receive most of the efferent vessels from the lateral sets. Their efferent vessels commonly unite about the level of the second lumbar vertebra to form a right and a left lumbar lymphatic trunk, which open, with some small vessels from the lateral sets, into the receptaculum chyli. The left lumbar trunk also receives the lymphatics of the descending colon and sigmoid flexure. The lateral lumbar glands, transverse lumbar cfin psoas glands, are situated behind the psoas between the transverse processes of the lumbar vertebrae. They are twenty or thirty in number, and smaller than the glands of the central group. The lateral glands receive the lymphatics accompanying the lumbar arteries, the lymphatics from the muscles of the back, the spinal canal, and from the deeper parts of the parietes of the posterior abdominal walls. Their efferent vessels open, in part into the median set, and in part, as separate vessels, into the receptaculum chyli. The coeliac glands, sixteen to twenty in number, are grouped around the coeliac axis in front of the aorta, above the origin of the superior mesenteric artery. At the back of the transverse meso-colon they receive the efferent vessels from some of the hepatic glands, the superior gastric glands, the inferior gastric glands, the splenic and the pancreatic glands. Their efferent vessels join the intestinal lymphatic trunk, and open into the receptaculum chyli.THE LYMPHATICS 702 II. THE VISCEBAL LYMPHATIC VESSELS AND GLANDS OF THE ABDOMEN AND PELVIS The lymphatics of the pelvic and abdominal viscera are considered separately. 1. The lymphatics of the pelvic viscera.—The lymphatics of the bladder pass partly backwards, beneath the peritonemii, to join the rectal lymphatics, or the lymphatics of the uterus and vagina in the female ; and partly forwards, to join the prostatic lymphatics and the lymphatics of the vesiculse seminales. These anterior sets of lymphatics, together with those from the prostate and vesiculffi seminales, pass through the anterior true ligaments of the bladder, in which there is a small gland, into the internal iliac lymphatics. The lymphatics of the rectum run backwards between the two layers of the meso-rectum, in which there are four or five glands, through the sacral to the lumbar glands. The lymphatics of the uterus, vagina, ovaries, and Fallopian tubes.—The superficial lymphatics of the uterus, which lie beneath the peritoneum, pass, together with those of the substance of the fundus and upper part of the body of the organ, outwards, in the broad ligament, where they join the lymphatics from the ovaries and Fallopian tubes, and pass up, with the ovarian vessels, to the lumbar glands. The lymphatics from the lower part of the body and from the cervix of the uterus run, together with most of the lymphatics of the vagina, along the course of the uterine and vaginal vessels, and terminate in the internal iliac glands. The lymphatics from the lower part of the vagina join the superficial inguinal glands. The lymphatics of the testicle accompany the spermatic vessels, and terminate in the lumbar glands. Hence in carcinoma of the testicle the lumbar glands are those which first become enlarged, the inguinal not being affected until the skin of the scrotum becomes involved in the disease. 2. The lymphatics of the abdominal viscera are divided into—(1) The lymphatics of the stomach ; (2) the intestines ; (3) the liver; (4) the spleen; (5) the pancreas ; (6) the kidneys ; (7) the ureters ; and (8) the suprarenal capsules. (1) The lymphatics of the stomach begin in the mucous and subserous coat, and thence follow the course of the blood-vessels. Thus some run upwards to the lesser curve of the stomach, others downwards to the greater curve, and others left- wards to the greater end. In this way, three chief sets are formed—the superior gastric, the inferior gastric, and the left gastric lymphatics, {a) The superior gastric follow the course of the coronary vein along the lesser curvature towards the cardiac end of the stomach, lying between the layers of the lesser omentum. They pass on their way through five or six small (superior gastric) lymphatic glands. Eeaching the cardia, they turn downwards, and, having been joined by some of the lymphatics from the left lobe of the liver, enter the upper coeliac glands. (b) The inferior gastric lymphatics follow the course of the right gastro-epiploic vessels towards the pylorus, along the greater curvature of the stomach, between the layers of the greater omentum. After passing through six or eight small glands (inferior gastric), they are joined by the lymphatics from the upper part of the duodenum, and run between the pylorus and pancreas to the coeliac glands, (c) The left gastric lymphatics run with the vasa brevia, between the folds of the gastro- splenic omentum, to the splenic lymphatic glands. The lymphatic glands of the stomach are the superior and inferior gastric glands. The superior gastric glands, five or six in number, are situated along the lesser curve between the layers of the gastro-hepatic omentum. They receive theLYMPHATICS OF ABDOMEN AND FELVIS 703 superior gastric lymphatics; their efferent ducts pass, first upwards towards the oesophagus, and then, after receiving the lymphatics from the upper and left portion of the left lobe of the liver, turn downwards behind the pancreas to join the coeliac glands. The inferior gastric or gastro-epiploic glands, six or eight in number, lie along I the greater curve of the stomach between the layers of the great omentum. They I receive the inferior gastric lymphatics and the lymphatics of the great omentum. I Their efferent vessels pass with the lymphatics from the upper part of the duo- denum into the coeliac glands. (2) The lymphatic vessels of the intestines are divided into the lymjphatics of the small intestine and the lymphatics of the large intestine. The lymphatics of the small intestines are called the lacteals, because they carry the chyle as well as the lymph from the intestinal walls. Beginning partly beneath the peritoneal coat—but chiefly in two plexuses, one between the muscular coats, and one beneath the mucous membrane—they pass round the intestine with the blood-vessels to the mesenteric attachment, and thence between the layers of the mesentery to the mesenteric glands. The lymphatics of the large intestine are disposed of as follows :—{a) Those from the csecum and ascending colon pass between the layers of the meso-colon to the meso-colic glands, (h) Those from the transverse colon and upper half of the descending colon pass with the middle colic artery between the layers of the meso- ' colon, also to the meso-colic glands, (c) Those from the lower half of the descend- ing colon and sigmoid flexure pass into the left lymphatic trunk of the lumbar glands. The lymphatics of the rectum are described with the lymphatics of the pelvis (page 702). The lymphatic glands of the intestines are the mesenteric and meso-colic. The mesenteric glands, some one hundred and fifty to two hundred in number, lie between the layers of the mesentery. They are arranged roughly in three sets : [a) A primary set, about two inches from the intestinal margin of the mesentery, receive the lymphatics from the intestine. The efferent vessels from these glands pass into the next or secondary set. [h) The secondary set are situated about the primary loops of the superior mesenteric artery; they are more numerous than the primary set, and receive the efferent vessels of the latter. Their efferent vessels end in the tertiary set. (c) The tertiary set of glands lie along the course of the trunk of the superior mesenteric artery. They are larger than the secondary set, and closer together. Their efferent vessels unite to form three or four trunks, or perhaps more often a single trunk (the intestinal lymphatic trunk) which, after receiving the efferent vessels from the meso-colic glands, opens, either separately, or together with the efferent ducts of the coeliac glands, into the receptaculum chyli. The glands and lacteals of the jejunum are more numerous than those of the ileum. The meso-colic glands, twenty to thirty in number, are placed between the layers of the meso-colon. They receive the lymphatics from the caecum, ascending I and transverse colon, and from part of the descending colon. Their efferent vessels join the efferent vessels from the tertiary set of mesenteric glands, and open with them into the receptaculum chyli. (3) The lymphatics of the liver consist of a superficial and deep set. The former are arranged in a plexus beneath the peritoneal covering; the latter accom- pany the blood-vessels in the substance of the organ. \a) The superficial set of lymphatics form groups, and run in various directions. 1 Those on the upper or convex surface of the liver are disposed of as follows :— (i) The I lymphatics of the left half of the right lobe, and of the right half of the left lobe, converge towards the falciform ligament, up which they run to the diaphragm. I They then pass through the costo-xiphoid space, and enter the anterior mediastinal704 THE LYMPHATICS chain of glands, and thus open in part into the right lymphatic duct, (ii) The lymphatics on the anterior part of the convex surface pass over the anterior margin, ; and along the course of the longitudinal fissure to the hepatic glands in the gastro- hepatic omentum, (iii) The lymphatics along the posterior margin of the liver pass betAveen the layers of the coronary ligament to the diaphragm, which they perforate, and end in small glands about the upper part of the vena cava (Quain). (iv) A \ group from the right half of the right lobe pass outwards and backwards to the right lateral ligament, where they either perforate the diaphragm and end in the anterior mediastinal glands, or cross its crus and open into the coeliac glands or receptaculum chyli. (v) A group from the left half of the left lobe pass through the left lateral ligament, and join the oesophageal lymphatics at the oesophageal opening of the diaphragm, or pass with the superior gastric lymphatics behind the pancreas to the coeliac glands. Or they may pierce the diaphragm and enter the glands in the anterior mediastinum. \ The superficial lymphatics on the under surface of the liver are arranged as follows :—(i) The greater number converge to the transverse fissure, and thence pass with the deep lymphatics to the hepatic glands in the gastro-hepatic omentum; (ii) a group from the back of the right lobe pass to the lumbar glands ; (iii) a group from the back of the left lobe join the oesophageal lymphatics or superior gastric lymphatics, and end with them in the coeliac glands; (iv) the lymphatics of the gall-bladder run with the hepatic artery to the hepatic glands in the gastro-hepatic \ omentum. \ {b) The deep set of lymphatics run, in part with the portal vein, and in part j with the hepatic vein, (i) The portal set emerge at the transverse fissure, and ; pass with the blood-vessels to the hepatic glands in the gastro-hepatic omentum, (ii) The hepatic set perforate the diaphragm with the inferior vena cava, and, having passed through some small glands round the upper part of that vessel, join the superficial lymphatics from the posterior margin of the liver, and with them run down the thoracic surface of the vertebral portion of the diaphragm to the commencement of the thoracic duct or receptaculum chyli. The hepatic glands are situated in front of the portal vein between the layers of the gastro-hepatic omentum. They receive the deep portal set of lymphatics, the anterior group of the superficial lymphatics from the convex surface of the j liver, most of the superficial lymphatics from the under surface of the liver, and | the lymphatics from the gall-bladder. Their efferent vessels proceed to the coeliac ' j glands. i (4) The lymphatics of the spleen.—^The splenic lymphatics are arranged in a j superficial set which ramify beneath the peritoneal covering; and in a deep set, j which run with the vessels in the parenchyma of the organ. Both sets unite at j the hilum, and terminate in the splenic glands. The splenic glands, eight to ten in number, are situated in the hilum of the I spleen, and along the course of the splenic artery and vein. They receive the i superficial and deep lymphatics of the spleen, and the left gastric lymphatics which I run with the vasa brevia in the gastro-splenic omentum from the greater end of j the stomach. The efi'erent vessels run behind the peritoneum and pancreas with { the splenic artery to the coeliac glands. They are joined on the way by the j lymphatics of the pancreas. |; (5) The lymphatics of the pancreas consist of a double set, a superficial and a || deep. They leave the pancreas along with the vessels derived from the splenic | artery, and, joining the lymphatics of the spleen, end in the coeliac glands. (6) The lymphatics of the kidneys ramify, partly on the surface, and partly in the j substance of the organ. They unite at the hilum, and run inwards to the central set oi lumbar glands. They receive the lymphatics from the suprarenal bodies and j from the upper part of the ureters. jLYMPHATICS OF LOWER EXTBEMITY 705 (7) The lymphatics of the ureters end chiefly in the renal lymphatics. Those from the lower part join the posterior vesical set of lymphatics. (8) The suprarenal lymphatics leave the suprarenal bodies with the suprarenal veins, and join for the most part the renal lymphatics in the hilum of the kidneys. A few pass direct into the central lumbar chain of glands. THE LYMPHATICS OF THE LOWER EXTREMITY The lymphatics of the lower extremity, like those of the upper, may be divided into the superficial and the deep. The former run in the subcutaneous tissue with the superficial veins, the latter along the course of the deep arteries. At the groin the superficial end in the deep, which then pass under Poupart's ligament into the abdomen. I. THE SUPEBFIGIAL LYMPHATIC VESSELS AND GLANDS OF THE LOWER EXTREMITY The superficial lymphatic vessels follow in chief part the long and short saphenous veins. Passing from the toes to a plexus on the dorsum and sole of the foot respectively, they thence run up the leg, forming two chief sets of lymphatic vessels, an inner and an outer. The inner and larger accompanies the long saphenous vein in front of the ankle, behind the inner side of the knee, and then up the inner and front part of the thigh to the inguinal glands. The outer set, beginning on the outer side of the foot, run up the outer side of the leg, some passing round the front of the tibia to end in the inner set below the knee ; others passing over the popliteal space to join the inner set higher in the limb ; and others, again, perforating the deep fascia along with the short saphenous vein to end in the popliteal glands. The lymphatics of the gluteal region wind, in part round the inner side of the thigh, over the upper portion of the adductors, to join the innermost inguinal glands; and in part over the crest of the ilium to join the outermost inguinal glands. The superficial lymphatic glands.—There are no superficial glands below the inguinal. The inguinal glands, six to twelve in number, are situated in the inguinal region. They may be subdivided into the obhque, or inguinal proper, which are grouped along the course of Poupart's ligament; and the vertical, or femoral, or saphenous, which surround the saphenous opening. The oblique or inguinal glands proper, which are situated on a higher level than the vertical set, receive the lymphatics from the integuments of the penis and scrotum, and the skin of the pudenda and lower part of the vagina in the female. They also receive the lymphatics from the integuments of the lower part of the abdomen, and that covering the perinseal and gluteal regions. Their efferent vessels in part pass through the saphenous opening, and in part perforate the deep fascia to end in the deep inguinal and, to some extent, in the lumbar glands. It is these superficial inguinal glands which become enlarged in venereal disease, in chancres and epithelioma of the penis and scrotum, or labia in the female, and in boils or other sources of irritation about the anus, gluteal region, and perin^eum. The vertical set, or saphenous or superficial femoral glands, receive the super- ficial lymphatics from the lower limb. They are found enlarged in sores on the heel, malignant disease of the skin, etc. Z Z706 THE LYMPHATICS Fig. 400.—The Superficial Lymphatics of the Lower Limb.

THE DEEP LYMPHATIC VESSELS AND GLANDS OF THE LOWER EXTREMITY The deep lymphatic vessels of the lower limb follow the course of the deep arteries and veins. Thus they accompany the internal and external plantar arteries in the sole, and the dorsalis pedis artery on the dorsum of the foot. In the leg they are found following the posterior tibial, anterior tibial, and peroneal arteries, and, after passing through the lymphatic glands in the popliteal space, accompany, first, the popliteal, and then the femoral artery up the thigh to the deep inguinal or deep femoral glands. Deep lymphatics also run with the profunda artery. These also join the deep femoral lymphatic glands. Others accompany the gluteal and ischiatic artery, and end in the lymphatic glands of the same name at the great sciatic foramen. The deep lymphatic glands of the lower extremity are met with chiefly in the popliteal space and in the inguinal region. One, or sometimes two, small glands, however, may be found in the upper part of the front of the leg, lying on the inter- osseous membrane along the course of the anterior tibial artery. The popliteal glands are placed deep in the popliteal space around the popliteal artery and vein. They receive the deep lymphatics from the leg, and those of the superficial which perforate the deep fascia along with the external saphenous vein. Their efferent vessels accompany the popliteal and the femoral vessels to the deep inguinal or femoral glands. The deep inguinal or deep femoral glands surround the upper part of the femoral vessels. One or more are constantly found in the femoral canal. They receive the deep lymphatics accompanying the femoral artery, and a few of the efferent vessels from the superficial inguinal glands. Their efferent vessels pass, in part along the course of the femoral vessels, and in part through the femoral ring to join the glands along the course of the external iliac artery. z z 2SECTION V. THE NERVOUS SYSTEM By H. ST. JOHN BROOKS, M.D., B.Ch., D.Sc, B.A. UNIVERSITY ANATOMIST AND EXAMINEE IN ANATOMY IN 'J HE UNH^EHSITY OF DUBLIN ; SURGEON TO SIR PATRICK dun's HOSPITAL. NEUROLOGY NEUROLOGY is that branch of Anatomy which deals with the nervous system. It treats of the brain and spinal cord, constituting the cerebro-spinal axis or central nervous system; and the cranial and spinal nerves, or peripheral nervous system. The sympathetic system is" to be regarded as an appendage of the latter, although, as has been recently shown, there is reason to believe that it originates independently. The study of the nervous system (of the brain in particular) is greatly facilitated by a knowledge of its mode of development and by Fig. 401.—Diagrammatic Sagittal Section of a Vertebrate Brain.

It is not our purpose to enter into these subjects here ; but an examination of the two diagrams (figs. 401, 402), which are based upon Embryology and Comparative Anatomy, will familiarise the student with the plan upon which the brain is laid down, and form a key to the complicated structure of the adult human brain. At an early period of embryonic life the cerebro-spinal axis consists simply of a thin walled tube, the neural tube, which becomes enlarged at the cephahc end of the body. Constrictions appear on this enlarged cephalic end, dividing it into three vesicles, an anterior, a middle, and a posterior. The ventricles of the brain are709 NEUROLOGY afterwards developed from these three cerebral vesicles, and the remainder of the nem^al tube forms the central canal of the spinal cord. The substance of the brain and cord is formed by thickenings of the wall of this neural tube. The terminal or anterior cerebral vesicle becomes divided into an anterior and a posterior division ; the latter persists as the third ventricle, which, with the parts around it, constitutes the thalamencephalon. The anterior division is afterwards differentiated into the cerebral hemispheres or prosencephalon. It becomes at first indented in the middle line, and then completely bilobed. In this way two symmetrical cavities, the right and left lateral ventricles, are formed. The anterior part of the wall of the cerebral vesicle between the two hemi- spheres, thus mapped out, is called the lamina terminalis. The lamina terminalis is carried backwards so as to bound the third ventricle in front, and the aperture of communication (foramen commune anterius), connecting the third with the lateral ventricles, becomes narrowed. The cavity of the middle cerebral vesicle becomes the aqueduct of Sylvius, and the parts developed around it constitute the mid-brain or mesencephalon. The cavity of the posterior cerebral vesicle becomes the fourth ventricle, and its walls are differentiated into the cerebellum and pons Varolii (epencephalon), and into the medulla oblongata (metencephalon). The walls of the lateral ventricles become greatly thickened and form the cerebral hemispheres, constituting the greater part of the mass of the brain. They grow backwards from the position represented in the diagram (fig. 401), and cover the mid- and hind-brain. In front of the lamina terminalis the walls of the lateral ventricles remain thin, and approximate so as to enclose a narrow space, the fifth ventricle. Thus the fifth ventricle differs entirely in its nature from the other ventricles of the brain : it is a separated portion of the interhemispheric or great longitudinal fissure, and has nothing to do with the true ventricular cavities ; accord- ing to Testut it is lined by a rudimentary layer of pia mater. Later on, a great transverse commissure (corpus callosum), which passes from one hemisphere to the other, is developed. It commences in front of the fifth ventricle in the secondarily fused portions of the cerebral walls, and afterwards extends backwards as the hemispheres grow over the mesencephalon. The oldest portion of the cerebral hemisphere, both in the series of vertebrates and in the development of the individual, is the island of Eeil with the grey masses which lie subjacent to it (nucleus caudatus and nucleus lenticularis of the corpus striatum). These structures constitute a central portion (Stammtheil of Schwalbe) which is almost completely invested by the remaining larger part of the hemisphere. The latter forms the less massive part of the wall of the lateral ventricle, and may be called the mantle-wall (Manteltheil of Schwalbe).THE NEBVOUS SYSTEM 710 The ventricular cavities of the brain and the central canal of the spinal cord are lined by a layer of ciliated epithelial cells, immediately outside which is a stratum of neuroglia, free from nerve-cells, which is called ependyma. The ependyma around the central canal of the cord is often termed substantia gelatinosa centralis. Neuroglia is the name given to the peculiar interstitial tissue of the brain and cord. It is continuous with processes of pia mater which dip in from the surface. Nerve-fibres are processes or outgrowths of the nerve-cells of the central nervous system, from which they pass to be distributed to every part of the body. They are classed by physiologists into efferent and afferent fibres. Efferent or centrifugal nerve-fibres convey impulses from the nerve-centres ; they comprise motor nerves to muscles, secreto-motor nerves to glands and vaso-motor nerves. Afferent or centripetal nerves convey impulses towards the nerve-centres; they comprise sensory nerves and other nerves conveying impulses, which under ordinary circumstances do not produce conscious sensations. Nerve-fibres run for the greater part of their course in compact bundles of various sizes, and these bundles are called nerves in the most general use of the term. Nerves are usually mixed (i.e. contain both efferent and afferent fibres). Most nerves are of a whitish colour owing to a medullary sheath which invests the essential parts (axis-cylinders) of the individual fibres. Others (chiefly visceral nerves) are of a pearly-grey colour owing to the absence of the medullary sheath in the majority of the fibres which make up the nerve. The fibres of sensory nerves are outgrowths from nerve-cells contained in ganglia, such as the Gasserian ganglion and the ganglia on the posterior roots of the spinal nerves. These ganglia, although appearing to belong to the peripheral nervous system in the adult, were (in early embryonic life) in continuity with the general epiblast of the neural canal. Certain terms which are in frequent use, such as coronal, sagittal, and hori- zontal, may be defined here. A coronal section is a vertical section passing through or parallel to the coronal suture, in other words, a transverse vertical section. A sagittal section is a vertical section taken at right angles to a coronal section—an antero-posterior vertical section. A horizontal section is a section taken at right angles to the perpendicular axis of the body. Structures which lie in the planes of these sections are sometimes spoken of as coronally placed, sagittally directed, etc. THE MENINGES The brain and spinal cord are invested by three membranes, termed the meninges, which afford protection and support to the delicate nervous structures, and also furnish a convenient medium in which the blood-vessels can ramify. The outer of these is thick and tough, and is termed the dura mater. The intermediate and inner membranes (arachnoid and pia mater) are thin and delicate. These mem- branes present differences in the regions of the brain and spinal cord respectively. The membranes of the brain will be first considered, and the differences met with in relation to the spinal cord will be dealt with in the description of that region. Dissection.—The first step in the examination of the meninges is the removal of the brain. The calvaria should be removed as follows :—The bone having been laid bare, a string should be tied round the skull passing from about an inch and a quarter above the external occipital protuberance behind, to an inch above the orbital arches in front. The outer table of the skull should then be sawn through and the inner table afterwards cracked with the mallet and chisel. A slight wrench will now disengage the calvaria. After noticing the Pacchionian bodies and the meningeal arteries, the student will do well toMENINGES 711 examine the superior longitudinal sinus by laying it open. He should next cut through the dura mater in an antero-posterior direction on each side of the sinus, and then make incisions directed transversely outwards from the central points of the two previous incisions as far as the cut margin of the bone. The four triangular flaps thus mapped out should be turned downwards, and by gently drawing one of the hemispheres aside, the falx cerebri may be seen ifi situ within the great longitudinal fissure, and the veins entering the superior longitudinal sinus may be noted. The falx should then be divided close to its attachment to the crista galli and thrown backwards. The head should next be inclined backwards and the frontal lobes of the brain gently raised. The following structures will then come into view, viz. the olfactory bulbs, the second, third, and fourth nerves, the infundibulum, and the internal carotid arteries. The olfactory bulbs will come away with the brain, but the other structures will require to be divided with scissors, as the nerves are frequently torn away from their connections by using a scalpel for this purpose. The head should next be gently inclined towards the right side, and the tentorium divided close to its attachment to the bone. The sixth, seventh, and eighth nerves should be cut at the same time. This dissection should be repeated on the opposite side. The head should then be tilted backwards, and the remaining cranial nerves, the vertebral arteries, and the commencement of the spinal cord cut through. The latter should be divided as low down as it can be reached with the scalpel. The brain can now be removed from the cranial cavity, the veins of Galen being ruptured by this process. The BUS A MATEE is a tough fibrous membrane of a bluish-white colour present- ing externally a rough appearance, but internally smooth and shining. It performs the double function of a periosteum to the interior of the skull and of affording support and protection to the brain. In correspondence with this double function it may be regarded as consisting of two layers, an outer or periosteal lamina, and an inner or supporting lamina. These layers are inseparable for the greater part of their extent, but along certain lines the inner lamina leaves the periosteal lamina and forms shelf-like projections (of which the falx cerebri and the tentorium cerebelli are examples) into the cranial cavity. Along the lines where these layers divaricate spaces occur which form cranial sinuses. A cranial sinus may be defined as a space formed by the cleavage of the dura mater, lined by a prolongation of the lining membrane of a vein and conveying venous blood. Some of the sinuses are placed between the periosteal and supporting layers of the dura mater—the lateral sinus is a good example of this class. Others (as the straight sinus) are bounded wholly by the inner or supporting layer. The cranial sinuses form two principal systems, which, however, communicate with one another. The following is a list of the sinuses which unite to form the larger of these two systems :—superior longitudinal, inferior longitudinal, straight, occipital, superior petrosal. These form a system which converges at the torcular Herophili, a dilated blood-space situated on the right side (rarely on the left) of the internal occipital protuberance. The blood from the torcular is drained away by the lateral sinuses (more particularly by the right sinus), and leaves the cranium through the posterior compartment of the jugular foramen. The straight sinus usually passes into the left lateral sinus. The smaller system comprises the spheno-parietal, cavernous, circular, transverse, and inferior petrosal sinuses. The blood from this system passes into the internal jugular vein through the anterior compartment of the jugular foramen. A portion of the blood conveyed by the cavernous sinus, however, passes into the lateral sinus through the superior petrosal sinus. Emissary veins.—These veins are possibly extracranial tributaries of the cranial sinuses under normal conditions, but, in cases of engorgement of the sinuses, permit the flow of blood in the opposite direction, and become, in accordance with their name, emissary. The mastoid emissary is the most important of these veins; it passes through the mastoid foramen to enter the lateral sinus, and explains the value of applying leeches behind the ears in cases of cerebral congestion. Two small emissaries enter the superior longitudinal sinus, one of these passes through the foramen caecum; another traverses the parietal foramen. An additional vein occasionally passes to the torcular Herophili through a foramen in the occipital bone near the external occipital protuberance. Emissary veins pass through the foramen ovale and foramen of Vesalius, and place the cavernous sinus in com- munication with the pterygoid venous plexus ; others traverse the cartilage which occupies the foramen lacerum medium. Small veins enter the lateral sinuses through the anterior and posterior condyloid foramina. A minute venous plexus, which accompanies the internal carotid artery through the carotid canal, establishes a communication between the cavernous sinus and the internal jugular vein. (Eektorzik.)THE NERVOUS SYSTEM 712 The dura mater of the brain is continuous through the foramen magnum with the dura mater of the cord. It is also continuous, through the various foramina in the cranium, with the external periosteum of the skull. This is most easily observed at the sphenoidal fissure, but may be made out with ordinary care at any of the other foramina. It sends a strong prolongation through the optic foramen which splits into two layers, one of which forms the sheath of the optic nerve, and the other is continued into the periosteum of the orbit. On account of the number of foramina at the base of the skull, it follows that the dura mater is more firmly connected to the bone here than at the roof and sides. In the region of the basilar process of the occipital bone, the dura mater splits into supporting and periosteal layers. The supporting layer passes through the foramen magnum to become continuous with the dura mater of the spinal cord. The periosteal layer clothes Fig. 403.—Coronal Section of the Head passing through the Mastoid Process. (From a mounted specimen in the Anatomical Department of Trinity College, Dublin.) rosal the bone and is thickened into a ligamentous band, the occipito-cervical or cervico- basilar ligament (page 198), which passes through the foramen magnum to join the posterior common ligament of the vertebrae and to gain attachment to the body of the axis. Thus a connection is established between the dura mater and the periosteum of the vertebrae. At the back and sides of the foramen magnum the dura mater does not split into periosteal and supporting layers until it reaches the margin of that opening, where its layers divaricate, the one to become continuous with the external periosteum of the skull, the other to be continued into the spinal dura mater. In the middle fossa of the skull there is a separation of the periosteal and supporting layers to form the cavernous sinus; on the inner side of this the supporting layer is moulded round the pituitary body and then folds on itself to form the diaphragma sellae. External to the cavernous sinus the two layers remain separate for some distance, forming a space (Meckel's space), which encloses the Gasserian ganglion. The outer surface of the dura mater is covered with a number of arteries, which ramify between it and the inner table of the skull. These vessels break up intoMENINGES 713 small twigs which penetrate the bone. The term meningeal, applied to these arteries, is somewhat misleading, inasmuch as they do not supply any of the meninges, except the dura mater, being chiefly destined for the nutrition of the cranial bones. These small vessels, together with a number of fibrous retinacula, are torn across when the dura mater is forcibly detached from the bone, and give rise to the rough appearance which is presented by its outer surface. An examination under water will, however, reveal smooth spots interspersed among the bundles of ruptured vessels ; these are subperiosteal lymph-spaces. Meningeal arteries.—The middle or great meningeal artery, which enters the middle cranial fossa through the foramen spinosum, supplies the dura mater which lines the vault of the cranium. In addition to this there are meningeal arteries, mostly of small size, Fig. 404.—Coronal Section of the Head passing through the Posterior Horns of the Lateral Ventricles.

In the anterior cranial fossa there are anterior meningeal branches of the anterior and posterior ethmoidal arteries, which enter the cranium through the anterior and posterior internal orbital canals; also twigs from the middle meningeal which usually pierce the great wing of the sphenoid near the outer angle of the sphenoidal fissure. In the middle cranial fossa the following arteries are met with :—a branch of the ascending pharyngeal which perforates the cartilage which occupies the foramen lacerum medium ; the meningea parva which enters the cranium through the foramen ovale; the meningeal branch of the internal carotid, and twigs from the middle meningeal. In the posterior cranial fossa, two meningeal branches, derived from the occipital and ascending pharyngeal, enter through the posterior compartment of the jugular foramen, another twig from the occipital passes through the mastoid foramen, and a twig from the ascending pharyngeal makes its way through the anterior condyloid foramen. A meningeal branch of the vertebral is given off from that artery, in the interval between the occipital bone and the posterior arch of the atlas, and enters the skull through the foramen magnum. A branch of the occipital artery (ramus parietalis, Cruveilhier) occasionally passes through the parietal foramen to the dm^a mater lining the calvaria. The following are the infoldings formed by the inner or supporting layer of the714 THE NEBVOUS SYSTEM dura mater, taken in their order of magnitude: the falx cerebri, the tentorium cerebelii, the falx cerebelli, and the diaphragma sellge. There are also two smaller paired folds ; viz. the folds which project from the lesser wings of the sphenoid bone into the Sylvian fissm-es of the brain, and the crescentic folds which are placed over the optic nerves at the upper margin of the optic foramina. The Falx Cerebri is a large sickle-shaped process, deeper behind than in front, which is placed in the great longitudinal fissure of the brain. It is attached by its base to the tentorium cerebelli, in the middle line, and maintains by its tension the vaulted character of the latter. The straight sinus follows this line of attachment. Its apex is firmly fixed to the crista galli of the ethmoid, and has also an attach- ment to the ethmoidal spine of the sphenoid bone. Its convex or upper margin corresponds to the superior longitudinal sinus, and is attached to the periosteal Fig. 405.—The Cranium opened to show the Falx Cerebri, the Tentorium Cerebelli, and the places where the Cranial Nerves pierce the Dura Mater.

The inferior longitudinal sinus courses along its concave or free margin. This margin closely approaches the corpus callosum behind, but is separated from it by a considerable interval in front. The Tentorium Cerebelli occupies the interval between the cerebrum and cerebellum. It presents for examination an upper surface, a lower surface, a free or concave border, and an attached or convex border. The upper surface is in contact with the occipital lobes of the cerebrum, and is strongly convex upwards, forming a roof-like structure, to the ridge of which the base of the falx cerebri is attached. This ridge also slopes upwards and forwards, so that its highest point is situated at the free border. The under surface is in apposition to the cerebellum. The free border bounds an opening usually described as oval, but which is more properly triangular with curved sides, the apex of the triangle being turned back-715 MENINGES wards, and corresponding to the point where the veins of Galen enter the straight sinus. This opening transmits the crura cerebri and the superior peduncles of the cerebellum, these parts forming an isthmus connecting the masses of brain sub- stance above and below the tentorium ; the basilar artery and the third and fourth pairs of cranial nerves also pass upwards through this opening. Followed for- wards, the free border is seen to be attached to the anterior clinoid processes of the sphenoid bone. The attached border follows the lateral sinus along the occipital and parietal bones, and then corresponds to the superior petrosal sinus along the superior border of the petrous portion of the temporal, and finally dips under the free border, to be attached to ihe posterior clinoid process of the sphenoid bone. The Falx Cerebelli is a small prominent fold, which is placed between the cerebellar hemispheres. Its attached border corresponds to the occipital sinus along the internal occipital crest. Above this it is attached for a short distance to the under surface of the tentorium. Its free border looks upwards and forwards.

SUBARACHNOID SPACE Superior loiigitudinal sinvs PACCHIONIAN BODY Dura mater (joBPCS CALLOSUM The diaphragma sellae is a small, annular, shelf-like fold of the dura mater which roofs in the pituitary fossa, leaving a small aperture in the centre, which transmits the infundibulum. The subdural space is a narrow lymph-space between the dura mater and the arachnoid. It is occupied by a small portion of the cerebro-spinal fluid, the greater part of which, however, is lodged in the meshes of the subarachnoid tissue, and in the ventricles of the brain (page 717). This space separates the arachnoid from the dura mater, except where it is crossed by the veins of the brain passing to the cranial sinuses, by the Pacchionian bodies, and by the cranial nerves at their points of exit from the skull. The ARACHNOID is a thin delicate membrane, which presents a well-defined limiting surface towards the dura mater, but on its deep or pia-matral surface passes insensibly into the subarachnoid tissue. The arachnoid does not dip into the fissures of the cerebrum and cerebellum, with the exception of those fissures which contain processes of dura mater. Thus it is carried into the great longitu- dinal fissure for a depth corresponding to the falx cerebri, and it passes for a short distance into the fissure of Sylvius around the fold of dura mater which projects from the lesser wing of the sphenoid.THE NEBVOUS SYSTEM 716 On each side of the superior longitudinal sinus groups of small lobulated bodies, the so-called Pacchionian glands, project from the surface of the arachnoid; these are enlargements of the normal villi of that membrane which perforate the dura mater and cause absorption of the bone in their vicinity. Most of these bodies are lodged in irregular pits in the calvaria; others project into the superior longitu- dinal sinus. They may also occur in other situations. The subarachnoid tissue consists of very fine trabeculse, clothed with endo- thelial cells, which pass from the arachnoid to the i3ia mater.

It should be understood, however, that in these larger spaces the subarachnoid tissue is less abundant and the meshes are larger than in the regions where the arachnoid and the pia mater are more approximated. The largest of these spaces is the cisterna magna, which is a continuation of the posterior subarachnoid space of the spinal cord. This space appears triangular in sagittal section. It is bounded in front by the layer of pia mater (tela choroidea inferior, page 757) which closes in the lower part of the roof of the fourth ventricle, and above by the inferior vermiform process of the cerebellum. It extends laterally as far as the outer margins of the tonsillar lobes. It communi- cates with the fourth ventricle by means of three small openings ; the principal of these (foramen of Majendie) is in the middle line of the tela choroidea inferiorPIA MATEB—LYMPHATICS OF BBAIN 111 immediately above the obex (page 758). The two others (foramina of Key and Eetzius) are at the extremities of the recessus laterales of the fom^th ventricle, behind the upper roots of the giosso-pharyngeal nerves. Another large space, the cisterna pontis, is continued from the anterior subarachnoid space of the cord, and extends forwards as far as the commencement of the great longitudinal fissure, and laterally to the inner margins of the temporo-sphenoidal lobes. The basilar artery and the circle of Willis are placed in this space. The cisterna pontis communicates freely around the medulla oblongata with the cisterna magna—thus the medulla is encircled by a wide subarachnoid space. A large space is also to be found between the lower edge of the falx cerebri (where the arachnoid passes across from one cerebral hemisphere to the other) and the upper surface of the corpus callosum. This space contains the trunks and larger branches of the anterior cerebral arteries. Another considerable space exists in the fissure of Sylvius, and in this the middle cerebral artery ramifies. Thus, with the exception of the cisterna magna, all these spaces serve for the accommodation of large arteries. There is also a space between the corpora quadri- gemina and the anterior extremity of the superior vermiform process of the cere- bellum, and through this the veins of Galen pass to terminate in the straight sinus. The PIA MATER is a delicate vascular membrane which closely invests the nervous substance. It follows accurately the contour of the surface of the brain, dipping into all the fissures of the cerebrum and cerebellum—in the smaller sulci of the latter, however, a double layer cannot be distinctly made out. Processes or folds of this membrane project into some of the ventricles of the brain, and are separated from the ventricular cavities only by a layer of epithelium. These folds form the velum interpositum and choroid plexuses, which will be described with the anatomy of the ventricles. The blood-vessels, which divide freely in the subarachnoid tissue, subdivide into the pia mater, forming by their inosculations fine networks from which innumerable minute vessels proceed to penetrate the nervous substance. Lymphatics of the Beain and Spinal Coed The lymphatics of the brain and spinal cord are peculiar, inasmuch as they open into the subarachnoid space, and are only indirectly connected with the general lymphatic and venous systems. The communications with the venous system are effected by the Pacchio- nian bodies. The lymphatics of the peripheral nerves are in the form of tubular spaces placed between the lamellae of the perinem-al sheaths. These tubular channels open into the subdural and subarachnoid spaces. The subdural space is a very narrow interval between the dura mater and arachnoid (page 715). It normallj^ contains only sufficient fluid to moisten its sm-faces. It is in commimication with the lymphatics of the neck and also of the back and loins. It also commimicates with the perineural spaces around the nerves, and with the lymph spaces which smTound the olfactory, optic, and auditory nerves. It sends prolongations around the Pacchionian bodies. It does not communicate with the subarachnoid space. The subarachnoid space contains the greater part of the cerebro-spinal fluid, the fluid occupy- ing the meshes of the subarachnoid tissue. The lymphatics of the brain and cord and also the perineural spaces of the nerves open into this space. It is also in commimication with the ventricular system of the brain by means of the foramen of Majendie and the foramina of Key and Eetzius. Slit-like commmiications between the subarachnoid space and the descending horn of the lateral ventricle have also been described (Merkel and Mierzejewsky). It also commmiicates with the perilymph spaces of the internal ear and with the lymphatics of the mucous membrane of the nose. It sends prolongations aroimd the optic and auditory nerves. The lymphatic vessels of the brain and cord surroimd the arteries, and are hence caUed perivascular lymphatics. As each artery dips into the nervous substance it carries with it a tubular process of the pia mater. This tubular process is lined by endothelial cells and a similar layer covers the coat of the artery. In this manner the lymph-space is bounded. The perivascular lymphatic follows the artery as far as its capillary ramifications. There is a lymph-space between the two layers of the spinal pia mater. Ljanph-spaces between the outer and middle coats of the cerebral arteries (Virchow-Eobin space) and others718 THE NEBVOUS SYSTEM around the individual nerve-cells of the brain have been described, but these are xeiy general!}' believed to be artificial, being due to shrinking from the action of reagents. According to Obersteiner, however, the existence of the pericellular spaces ' is proved by the presence within them of lymphatic cells.' The so-called epicerebral and epispinal spaces, situated between the deep surface of the pia mater and the nervous substance, are also artificial. Structure of a Pacchionian body.—A Pacchionian body consists of {a) a central core of subarachnoid tissue which is joined to the general subarachnoid tissue by a comparatively narrow stalk. This is limited by (5) a la3^er of arachnoid ; aromid which is (c) a prolon- gation of the subdiu-al space. Bounding this space is (d) a very thin layer of membrane derived from the inner layer of the dura mater. It has been shown experimentally' that injections thrown into the subarachnoid space permeate the Pacchionian bodies and pass into the venous sinuses into which these bodies project. In this course the injection dis- tends the subdural space of the Pacchionian body, but does not enter the general subdural space. It should be mentioned, however, that anatomical pores by which the injection could pass do not exist. It is probable from these experiments that an outlet for the cerebro- spinal fluid is provided by the Pacchionian bodies. Cerebro-spinal fluid.—The cerebro-spinal fluid occupies the subdural and subarachnoid spaces of the brain and cord and also the ventricular cavities of the brain. The average quantity is about two ounces (Landois and Stirling). Its specific gravity is about 1010, It is of a very pale yellow colour, and presents many of the characters of ordinary lymph, but differs from lymph in not being coagulable, as it does not contain either fibrin factors or fibrin ferment. It contains a substance which acts on Fehling's solution like dextrose, but which is not a sugar (Foster). The cerebro-spinal fluid is derived in part from the lymphatic vessels which open into the subarachnoid and subdural spaces, but is also believed to be secreted by the epithelial cells which cover the choroid plexuses. These cells are cubical in form, and resemble secreting cells ; a process of the choroid plexus covered by these cells has been aptly compared by Foster to ' an everted alveolus of a secreting gland, with the epithelium outside and the blood-vessels within.' THE ENCEPHALON The encephalon, or brain, is the portion of the cerebro-spinal axis which is lodged within the cranial cavity and constitutes (by weight) about 98 per cent, of the whole. It consists of the cerebrum, the cerebellum, the pons Varolii, and the medulla oblongata. The medulla is continuous with the spinal cord at the decus- sation of the pyramids. The encephalon, taken as a whole, is ellipsoidal or ovoidal in form, presenting above a tolerably even convexity formed by the cerebral hemi- spheres, but below a more irregular surface corresponding to the fossee in the base of the skull. The cerebrum comprises the cerebral hemispheres containing the lateral ventricles (prosencephalon), the optic thalami with the third ventricle between them (thalamencephalon), and the mesencephalon. It occupies the upper compartment of the cranial cavity, resting on a floor formed by the anterior and middle cranial fossae and the tentorium cerebelli. The cerebellum occupies the posterior cranial fossa, and is placed above and behind the fourth ventricle. It is connected by three pairs of peduncles or crura to the cerebrum, pons, and the medulla respectively. The fourth ventricle is bounded below and in front by the pons and medulla. In every part of the encephalon two distinct kinds of nervous substance are to be met with, termed grey and white matter. The grey matter is chiefly disposed upon the siu"face, as in the convolutions of the cerebrum and cerebeUum; but it is also met with in detached or partially detached masses or nuclei, such as the corpora striata and optic thalami in the cerebrum, the nuclei of the medulla and pons, and the corpus dentatum of the cerebeUum. It is composed of groups of gpmglion cells, which possess the power of originating nervous impulses; or of receiving impulses produced by the action of external stimuli on the end- organs of nerves ; or of modifying and redirecting such impulses. The white matter occiu-s in the greatest quantity in the central parts of the cerebral hemispheres. It is composed of meduUated nerve-fibres, which conduct the impulses to and from the ganglion cells in the grey matter. Both grey and white matter are supported by a delicate interstitial tissue termed neuroglia.THE BRAIN 719 Base of the Beain Dissection.—The student is recommended to commence the dissection of the brain by a general examination of the structures forming the base of that organ. He should carefully remove the remains of the membranes from the base, and after studying that region should proceed in a similar manner to remove the membranes from the superior and lateral surfaces of the cerebral hemispheres. The base of the brain presents for examination the inferior surfaces of the frontal and temporo-sphenoidal lobes of the cerebrum ; the structures contained within and adjacent to the interpediincular space ; the inferior sm-faces of the pons Varolii, meduUa oblongata, and lateral hemispheres of the cerebellum; and the superficial origins of the cranial nerves. In front, the orbital surfaces of the frontal lobes are seen separated from one another by the great longitudinal fissure, and indented by the triradiate and olfactory sulci, the^ latter Fig. 408.—View of the Base of the Brain.

Behind and somewhat laterally the frontal lobes are marked off from the temporal lobes by the fissure of Sylvius, near the commencement of which is the anterior perforated space. This space is of a grey colour, and is formed by a part of the lenticular nucleus of the corpus striatum, which comes to the surface at the base of the brain. The perforations are caused by small arteries which proceed from the middle cerebral artery to the corpus striatum. Each space is bomided internally by one of the peduncles of the corpus callosmn. The latter are white bands which pass from the corpus callosmn to the commencement of the fissm'e of Sylvius. Between the temporo- sphenoidal lobes is a large recess, which is bounded in front by the frontal lobes, and behind by the pons Varolii; within this is the remarkable arterial anastomosis known as the circle of Willis, the crura cerebri, the interpeduncular space, portions of the optic tracts with the optic commissure, the lamina cinerea, and portions of the third and fourth pairs of nerves.THE NERVOUS SYSTEM 720 The interpeduncular space is situated between the diverging crura cerebri. It corresponds below to the deepest part of the cisterna pontis, and above to the posterior part of the floor of the thu-d ventricle. It contains (1) the posterior perforated space, and in front of this (2) a pair of white roimded eminences, the corpora albicantia or mammiUaria, and (3) a conical greyish elevation, the tuber cinereum, ending in a thin tubular process, the infundibulum. The latter passes to the pituitary body, from which it is detached in removing the brain by the ordinary method. Immediately in front of the tuber cinereum is the optic commissm-e, from which the optic tracts can be traced for a short distance backwards and outwards, winding round the crura cerebri, and finally disappearing under cover of the temporal lobes. A thin grey lamina, the lamina cinerea, passes from the anterior border of the optic commissure to the commencement of the great longitudinal fissure, where it gains an attachment to the rostrum of the corpus callosum. The crura cerebri appear as two strong flattened bundles of white fibres, which emerge from the anterior border of the pons, and, diverging from one another, pass under cover of the temporal lobes, and are soon lost to view. On each side the third nerve is seen passing between the posterior cerebral and superior cerebellar arteries. Each nerve springs by a row of filaments from a groove at the inner margin of the crus. The fom^th nerve, a slender rounded fasciculus, winds romid the outer side of the crus. The pons Varolii appears immediately behind the crura as a broad band of white fibres directed transversely, and passing from one cerebellar hemisphere to the other. It narrows on each side as it passes into the cerebelhun. It is marked by a shallow groove in the middle line in which the basilar artery rests. The fifth nerve is seen piercing the side of the pons near its upper border in the form of two bundles, a large posterior or sensory root, and a smaU anterior or motor root, separated from the former by some of the transverse fibres of the pons. The sixth nerves are seen at the lower border of the pons in the groove between it and the medulla, emerging from the latter close to the outer side of the pyramidal bodies or between the fibres of these bodies. The pyramidal and olivary bodies can readily be made out on the medulla, and a portion of the restiform body can also be seen without distiu-bing the parts. The twelfth or hypoglossal nerve emerges by a row of filaments from the groove between the olivary and pyramidal bodies. The ninth, tenth, and eleventh nerves, which appear in numerical order from above downwards, arise from the groove between the olivary and restiform bodies; the origin of the eleventh or spinal accessory nerve being continued down the lateral column of the cord. The seventh and eighth nerves are close to the edge of the pons in the angle between the latter and the cerebellum. The cerebellar hemispheres are placed one on each side of the medulla and conceal the occipital lobes of the cerebrum when viewed from the base. The cerebellum stands out conspicuously from the cerebrmn on account of its darker grey colour and the smaller size and narrowness of its convolutions, which are termed folia. Two of its lobes are more prominent than the rest, viz. the amygdalae or tonsils, which are placed close to the medulla, one on each side; and the flocculi, which lie close to the pons above the tenth or pneumogastric nerves. THE CEEEBEAL HEMISPHERES The cerebral hemispheres constitute about 89 per cent, of the entire brain, and viewed from above, present an ovate form, broader behind than in front. They contain the lateral ventricles in their interior. They are separated from one another by the great longitudinal fissure, the floor of which is formed by the corpus callo- sum, a great commissure which connects each hemisphere with its fellow. Each hemisphere presents for examination a supero-external, an inferior, and an internal surface, and two extremities or poles, an anterior and a posterior ; the anterior pole presenting an edge flattened internally and bevelled externally; the posterior forming a blunt rounded point which is directed backwards with an inclination downwards. With the exception of a small portion of the inferior surface, the cerebral hemispheres are entirely covered with fissures or sulci, which mark off intervening elongated elevations termed convolutions or gyri. By this means the surface area of the brain and consequently the proportion of grey to white matter is very greatly increased. The general arrangement of the convolutions in the two hemispheres of the same brain is tolerably symmetrical, but minor differences always occur. These differences are more particularly seen when there is any striking deviation from the normal arrangement, as such abnormalities are usually con- fined to one hemisphere. The supero-external surface is convex, presenting a721 FISSUBES OF CEBEBBUM sharper curve in the transverse than in the antero-posterior direction. It is marked off from the internal surface at the great longitudinal fissure by a well-defined edge. It is divided for about its middle third into a superior and an inferior segment by the horizontal limb of the fissure of Sylvius which marks off the temporo-sphenoidal lobe. The internal surface is flattened, and is separated from the opposite hemi- sphere by the falx cerebri and the subarachnoid space. The inferior surface presents, in its middle third, a well-marked projection (the temporal pole of Broca) caused by the temporal lobe, in front of which is the commencement of the fissure of Sylvius, which separates the temporal lobe from the orbital surface of the frontal lobe.

Only two fissures are included in the former category, viz. the great longitudinal and the great transverse fissures of the cerebrum, {a) The great longitudinal fissure extends from the frontal to the occipital pole of the cerebrum and separates the hemispheres from one another, except where they are joined by the corpus callosum. It contains the falx cerebri and the anterior cerebral arteries. The great trans- verse fissure will be described with the anatomy of the lateral and third ventricles. {h) The remaining fissures present a very distinct division into complete and incomplete. The complete fissures are formed by an infolding of the entire 3 ATHE NERVOUS SYSTEM 722 thickness of the ventricular wall, so that the reverse of each complete fissure appears as a bulging into the cavity of the ventricles. The complete fissures comprise the dentate fissure, the collateral fissure, the calcarine fissure, and parieto- occipital fissure. The fissure of Sylvius is sometimes described as a complete fissure, ' but the projection into the hemisphere cavity which corresponds with it (viz. the corpus striatum) is not formed by an infolding of the mantle wall, but as an elevation on the floor of the prosencephalon. The surface area corresponding to this internal projection does not keep pace with the mantle, as the latter grows around it, and in consequence the Sylvian depression makes its appearance.' (Cunningham.) Interlobar fissures.—Certain fissures are termed interlobar because they have been selected to determine the boundaries of the various lobes into which the hemispheres have been (somewhat artificially) divided. These are the parieto- occipital fissure and the fissures of Sylvius and of Eolando. The parieto-oecipital fissure appears as a well-marked vertical sulcus on the posterior part of the inner face of the hemisphere, and is continued outwards for a short distance on to the convex surface. The portion on the mesial surface is distinguished as the internal parieto-oecipital or internal perpendicular fissure. It will be more particularly described with the fissures and convolutions of the inner surface of the hemisphere. The portion which appears on the convex surface is distinguished as the external parieto-oecipital fissure. The fissure of Sylvius is situated partly on the base and partly on the external surface of the hemisphere, and is, with the exception of the great longitudinal fissure, the most conspicuous sulcus in the brain. It commences at the outer angle of a depression called the vallecula Sylvii, in which the anterior perforated space is situated. It passes outwards and upwards with an inclination backwards, and divides into three branches or limbs, a posterior, an ascending, and an anterior. The posterior limb is by far the largest, and is to be regarded as the continuation of the main fissure; it passes backwards and slightly upwards, separating the temporal from the frontal and parietal lobes, and finally, taking a more upward direction, ends in the parietal lobe. The ascending limb is short and passes vertically upwards ; the inferior frontal convolution arches around it. The anterior limb is about the same length as the ascending ; it passes directly forwards into the substance of the inferior frontal convolution. , Between the posterior and ascending limbs of the fissure of Sylvius, a wedge-sllaped mass of convolutions is included which is known as the operculum ; it belongs partly to the frontal and partly to the parietal lobes. Beneath the operculum the two limbs of the fissure of Sylvius are united by a fissure which takes a curved course concentric with the cerebral surface; this fissure or space corresponds to the floor of the originally open fossa Sylvii, which has been covered by the downward growth of the operculum. When it is opened up by raising the operculum, the island of Keil is displayed. The fissure of Rolando, or central sulcus, serves as a line of demarcation between the frontal and parietal lobes. It is, next to the fissure of Sylvius, the most important of the incomplete fissures of the brain. It extends from the great longitudinal fissure to the Sylvian fissure, and may communicate with the latter (19 per cent., Cunningham), but the communication is always shallow. At its upper end it usually (60 per cent., Cunningham) passes into the great longitudinal fissure and appears on the mesial surface of the hemisphere, where it ends by bending backwards for about a quarter of an inch. The fissure of Rolando is directed downwards and forwards so that the fissures of the two sides taken together form an angle of about 143°, open in front. The fissure does not pursue a perfectly straight course, but is somewhat sinuous, and two of its bends, more conspicuous and constant than the others, have been described as the superior and inferior genua. These genua mark off the fissure into three approximately equal parts.FISSUBE OF ROLANDO 728 The superior genu is directed backwards. The inferior genu looks forwards ; it is more constant and much more strongly marked than the superior genu. In rare cases the fissure of Rolando may communicate with the prascentral or intraparietal sulci, but as a rule it pursues an isolated course across the convex surface. It has been very generally taught that the fissure of Rolando is caused by the pressure of a vein which passes diu-ing fcetal life (ft-om the foiu-th to the sixth month) from the middle cerebral vein to the superior longitudinal sinus. This view has been recently disproved, as it has been shown that the fissure develops in two segments, an upper and a lower, and the fissm-e is afterwards completed by the sinking down of the central portion. The remains of this central elevation can always be seen on opening the fissm-e of Rolando as a deeply placed annectant or bridging convolution at the level of the superior genu. (Cunningham.) The fissiu-e of Rolando is one of the earliest of the incomplete fissm^es to appear, and is usually developed diu-ing the last week or ten days of the fifth month of intra-uterine life. By its transverse direction it interrupts the longitudinal coiu-se of the majority of the Fig. 410.—Lateral View of the Fissures and Convolutions of the Cerebrum.

It is one of the most important landmarks on the cerebral sm'-face, as the principal motor centres of the cortex are situated around it. I The Lobes of the Cerebeal Hemispheres with the Fissures and Convolutions Each cerebral hemisphere is divided into five lobes, viz. the frontal, parietal, i occipital, temporo-sphenoidal, and the central lobe or island of Reil. Four of these j lobes are visible on the peripheral part of the hemispheres ; the fifth, or island of Reil, is deeply placed and is concealed by the operculum. Two other lobes, the falciform and the so-called olfactory lobe, are also described. The falciform lobe is limited to the mesial and tentorial surfaces of ; 3 A 2724 THE NEBVOUS SYSTEM the hemisphere, and will be described later on. The so-called olfactory lobe attains a considerable size in some of the lower animals, and may contain a prolongation of the lateral ventricle in its interior; in man, however, although hollow in embryonic life, it is reduced to a solid olfactory tract and bulb of small size. The olfactory tract and bulb are described for convenience among the cranial nerves, and are termed the olfactory or first pair of nerves. The rhinencephalon (so-called olfactory lobe) is a secondary outgrowth from the primitive cerebral vesicle, and therefore does not come under the same category as the cerebral lobes. It bears the same relation to the prosencephalon that the latter does to the thalam- encephalon. The FRONTAL LOBE occupies the fore part of the hemisphere and presents three surfaces : a convex supero-external or frontal, an inferior or orbital, and an internal or mesial. The convolutions and fissures on the mesial and tentorial surfaces of the hemisphere will be described separately. The frontal lobe is bounded behind by the fissure of Kolando, and below, for about its posterior half, by the stem and posterior limb of the fissure of Sylvius. It is limited internally by the calloso- marginal fissure. The frontal surface is separated from the orbital by a well-marked angle which may be called the orbital margin. This margin is usually destitute of fissures, and forms a curve concentric with the orbital arch of the frontal bone. Three fissures on the frontal surface require description : one of these, running in a transverse direction, is termed the prsecentral, the other two, which run parallel to the great longitudinal fissure, are named superior and inferior frontal. The prsecentral sulcus is placed in front of and parallel to the fissure of Kolando, and is usually divided by a sagittally-placed convolution into two parts, a superior and an inferior prascentral; the former is usually continuous with the superior frontal fissure. The superior frontal fissure is sometimes discontinuous with the prsecentral. At its orbital end it often passes into a coronally placed, curved fissure, termed the sulcus fronto-marginalis. The latter is situa.ted just above the orbital margin of the frontal lobe. The inferior frontal fissure may be continuous with the prsecentral, but a narrow gyrus usually separates the two fissures. The convolutions on the frontal surface are four in number : one directed trans- versely, the ascending frontal; and three lying in an antero-posterior direction, named superior, middle, and inferior frontal. The ascending frontal convolution bounds the fissure of Rolando in front, and is placed between that fissure and the prsecentral sulcus. It is connected at each end of the fissure of Rolando with the ascending parietal convolution, and passes into the paracentral lobule on the inner face of the hemisphere. The superior, middle, and inferior frontal convolutions occupy the remainder of the frontal surface, and are marked off by the superior and inferior frontal fissures. They pass forwards, and become continuous with the convolutions on the orbital surface. They are not simple, but are traversed both in a coronal and sagittal direction by tertiary fissures. The superior frontal convolution is continuous behind with the ascending frontal, and passes in front into the gyrus rectus and into the internal and anterior orbital convolutions. It is continuous with the marginal convolution on the inner face of the hemisphere. The middle frontal convolution is continuous behind with the ascending frontal when the superior and inferior prsecentral fissures are discontinuous. It passes in front into the anterior orbital gyrus. It is almost invariably continuous with the superior and inferior frontal convolutions at the orbital margin of the frontal lobe.725 FRONTAL AND PABIETAL LOBES and is often connected to these convolutions by secondary gyri passing across the superior and inferior frontal fissures. The inferior frontal convolution is continuous behind with the ascending frontal, and joins the external orbital gyrus around the orbital margin. The ascending and anterior limbs of the fissure of Sylvius cut into the substance of this convolution, and divide it into three parts, viz. pars orbitalis, pars triangularis, and pars basilaris. The pars orbitalis is situated below the anterior limb of the Sylvian fissure. The pars triangularis is included between the ascending and anterior limbs of the fissure. The pars basilaris is placed behind the ascending limb of the Sylvian fissure between the latter and the inferior praecentral sulcus. This convolution is of great physiological interest, as the faciilt^^ of articulate speech is localised in its posterior part (Broca's convolution). Disease of this limited portion of brain substance on the left side produces aphasia, except in left-handed persons, in whom the speech-centre is placed in the corresponding position on the right side. The speech-centre is limited to the pars basilaris. According to Ferrier, the speech-centre includes (in addition to the above) the inferior extremity of the ascending frontal convolution and a small part of the ascending parietal immediately behind the lower end of the fissm-e of Eolando. The orbital surface of the frontal lobe appears flattened in brains hardened in the ordinary manner; but when the brain is hardened in situ (fig. 410) it pre- sents a very characteristic concavity, being moulded on the orbital plate of the frontal bone. The outer half of the orbital surface looks directly downwards, but the inner half, following the curve of the orbital plate, looks much more outwards than downwards, and forms a tolerably sharp edge where it meets the internal surface. Two fissures are situated on this surface, viz. the triradiate and the olfactory. The triradiate fissure, as its name implies, is formed by three branches, which radiate from a common point. One branch is directed forwards, another backwards and inwards, and the third outwards. Another branch frequently springs from the external division near its centre, and in such cases the triradiate fissure assumes an H-shaped outline. The olfactory or straight sulcus is placed a short distance external to the great longitudinal fissure, and lodges the olfactory tract and bulb. The convolutions on the orbital surface comprise the three orbital convolutions and the straight convolution. The orbital convolutions are wedge-shaped masses placed between the limbs of the triradiate fissure. They are called, from their position, internal, anterior, and posterior. They are continuous with the superior, middle, and inferior frontal convolutions respectively. The straight convolution, or gyrus rectus, is situated between the sulcus of the same name and the margin of the great longitudinal fissure. It is continuous in front with the superior frontal convolution, and on the inner margin of the hemisphere with the marginal gyrus. It is sometimes described as a part of the internal orbital convolution. The convolutions on the internal surface of the frontal lobe are the marginal and the paracentral. The student is recommended to defer the study of these till a later period (page 731). The PARIETAL LOBE occupies the portion of the convex surface betvreen the frontal and occipital lobes and above the temporal lobe. It is bounded in front by the fissure of Eolando. Internally it is continued into the mesial surface of the hemi- sphere, where it is marked off from the adjacent lobes by the upturned end of the calloso-marginal fissure in front, by the internal parieto-occipital fissure behind, and more obscurely below by the variable sulcus subparietalis. On the convex surface of the hemisphere the posterior limits of the parietal lobe are in a greatTHE NEBVOUS SYSTEM 726 measure artificial. Tlie external parieto-occipital fissure marks it off for a short distance, and the boundary is then crossed by convolutions termed annectant gyri, which run in a sagittal direction and so bring the parietal and occipital lobes into direct continuity. There is, however, a notch, the iwcB-occiintal notch (fig. 410), placed at the lower margin of the hemisphere between the occipital and temporal lobes, and if a line be drawn from the extremity of the external parieto-occipital fissure to this notch, the upper part of the line, together with the external parieto-occipital fissure, separates the parietal from the occipital lobe. The parietal lobe is limited below by the posterior limb of the Sylvian fissure in the horizontal part of its course, and behind this its lower limits are artificially mapped out by producing the horizontal part of the Sylvian fissure backwards to meet the posterior boundary. The parietal lobe contains one fissure of importance—the intraparietal. The intraparietal fissure is a system of three fissures, viz. a superior and an inferior vertical, placed parallel to the fissure of Eolando ; and a horizontal placed at right angles to the other two. These parts may in rare cases remain separate, but most commonly are united with one another, forming a T-shaped figure. More- over, the horizontal part may unite with a fourth part, the ramus occipitalis, which extends into the occipital lobe. The intraparietal fissm^e has been hitherto regarded as consisting of an ascending and a horizontal part; the upper vertical limb (postcentral sulcus) being detached. This is a common variety of the fissm-e, but it has recently been shown that the T-shaped form is the commonest or normal arrangement. (Ciimiingliam.) The convolutions of the parietal lobe are : an ascending parietal, bounding the fissure of Eolando posteriorly and placed between that fissure and the intraparietal sulcus ; and two parietal lobules, a superior and an inferior, placed above and below the horizontal limb of that fissure. The inferior parietal lobule is further sub- divided into an anterior part called the supramarginal convolution, and a posterior termed the angular gyrus. The ascending parietal convolution extends from the posterior limb of the Sylvian to the great longitudinal fissure, and is bounded in front by the fissure of Eolando, and behind by the intraparietal sulcus. It is continuous with the supra- marginal convolution below the intraparietal fissure, and at its upper end is con- tinued into the paracentral lobule on the inner surface of the hemisphere. The superior parietal lobule is a squarish mass indented on the surface by tertiary fissures. It is limited internally by the margin of the great longitudinal fissure where it becomes continuous with the praecuneus. The anterior end of the ramus occipitalis of the intraparietal fissure terminates in this lobule when it is not continuous with the remainder of the intraparietal fissure, and, in such cases, the superior and inferior parietal lobules are continuous posteriorly. The superior parietal lobule is joined in front, by a convolution of variable breadth, v/ith the ascending parietal, and is connected behind to the superior occipital convolution by the first annectant gyrus. The supramarginal convolution is the anterior part of the inferior parietal lobule. It arches around the upturned extremity of the posterior limb of the fissure of Sylvius. It is continuous in front with the ascending parietal convolu- tion, behind with the superior temporal gyrus and also with the angular gyrus. It is often very obscurely marked off from the latter. The angular gyrus is placed behind the preceding and embraces the extremity of the parallel fissure. It is continuous behind with the middle temporal convolu- tion. It is also usually connected to the middle occipital convolution by the third annectant gyrus. The OCCIPITAL LOBE occupies approximately the portion of the cranial cavity which is interposed between the superior fossae of the occipital bone and theOCCIPITAL LOBE T21 tentorium cerebelli. It presents three very distinct surfaces: a convex supero-external, a mesial or internal, and a tentorial. The latter looks downwards and slightly inwards. These three surfaces meet at the occipital pole. It is sharply marked off on the mesial surface by the internal parieto-occipital fissure. On the convex surface the line of demarcation (as already described in treating of the parietal lobe) is made by drawing a line from the extremity of the external parieto-occipital fissure to the prseoccipital notch (fig. 410). This line separates the occipital from the parietal and temporal lobes. The prseoccipital*notch (fig. 410) is produced by the impression of the veins which enter the lateral sinus. Another impression (fig. 410, n), which is produced by the superior border of the petrous portion of the temporal bone, has been some- times described as the praeoccipital notch. It is generally stated that the occipital lobe passes into the temporal lobe on the tentorial surface without any line of demarcation. A number of methods of marking off the occipital lobe have been proposed by different authors. These are all largely artificial. The occipital lobe is due to a backward growth common to the parietal and temporal lobes. That growth carries with it a prolongation of tlie lateral ventricle, forming the posterior cornu. The occipital lobe is therefore that part of the hemisphere which contains the posterior cornu. It may be marked off on the tentorial surface by a line drawn from the praeoccipital notch to the extremity of the parieto-occipital fissm-e at the isthmus of the gyrus fornicatus (fig. 411). The remaining boundaries will be the parieto-occipital fissm-e for its entire length and (as before) a line drawn from the extremity of the external parieto-occipital fissure to the prseoccipital notch. The fissures on the convex surface of the occipital lobe are the superior, middle, and inferior occipital fissures ; to these may be added the ramus occipitalis of the intraparietal fissure with its appendage the transverse occipital fissure. The superior occipital fissure may be represented by a direct continuation of the intraparietal fissure to the occipital pole of the cerebrum. More commonly, however, it is limited to the posterior part of the occipital lobe (fig. 409, right side), and is not continuous with the intraparietal fissure. The ramus occipitalis of the intraparietal fissure may be directly continued into the occipital lobe from the horizontal limb of the main fissure, or it may commence in the superior parietal lobule. In either case it passes backwards into the occipital lobe between the first and second annectant gyri, and usually terminates a short distance behind the external parieto-occipital fissure by dividing into two branches which extend upwards and downwards at right angles to the main fissure, and together constitute the transverse occipital fissure. In the brains of most apes a fissure extends across the hemisphere in a line with the upper end of the internal parieto-occipital fissm^e, and is often said to be homologous with the external parieto-occipital fissure of the human brain. This characteristic simian fissm-e (appropriately called, in Germany, the Affenspalte) is, however, formed by the anterior margin of an occipital operculum, that is to sa,j, a portion of brain substance which has grown forwards from the occipital lobe, and has concealed the true external parieto-occipital fissure and the annectant gyri. These structures can, however, be readily seen if this operculum be lifted up. The occipital operculum and Affenspalte are probably formed by the forward growth of the convolution which bounds the transverse occipital fissure pos- teriorly, the parts immediately in front of this fissm-e being cliecked in their growth and depressed below the surface. For further information the student is referred to the works of Gratiolet, Schwalbe, and to a recent paper by D. J. Cimningham on the intraparietal fissure of the human brain. The middle occipital fissure is often feebly developed. It is directed from before backwards and meets the superior occipital fissure at the occipital pole. The inferior occipital fissure is placed along the margin which separates the convex surface from the tentorial surface of the hemisphere. It may extend in a tortuous manner from the prfeoccipital notch to the occipital pole of the hemisphere but is often broken up by one or more convolutions crossing it.728 THE NEBVOUS SYSTEM The convolutions on the convex surface are three in number, and are imper- fectly marked off from one another by the fissures above described. They pass from before backwards and become confluent at the occipital pole. The superior occipital convolution is placed between the superior occipital fissure and the margin of the great longitudinal fissure. It is continuous with the cuneus on the inner surface of the hemisphere, and is joined in front by the first annectant gyrus to the superior parietal lobule. The middle occipital convolution is situated between the superior and middle occipital fissures, and is united in front to the angular gyrus by the second and third annectant gyri. The inferior occipital convolution occupies the interval between the middle and inferior occipital fissures, and may be connected to the middle temporal convo- lution by a fourth annectant gyrus. The annectant gyri are four small sagittally-directed convolutions which cross the boundary line which separates the occipital from the parietal and temporal lobes. They are nmnbered from within outwards. The first and second of these are the most constant and are placed one on each side of the ramus occipitalis of the intraparietal fissure. The third and fourth are not infrequently absent as they may be cut through by the fissure, the sulcus occipitalis anterior. The sulcus occipitalis anterior is an inconstant fissure which is parallel to, and placed a little in front of, the anterior bomidary of the occipital lobe on the convex sm-face of the hemisphere. The TEMPORAL LOBE (temporo-sphenoidal lobe) is sharply marked off in front by the Sylvian fissure, but, as we have already seen, it passes behind without any surface line of demarcation into the parietal and occipital lobes. Its anterior extremity forms a bold prominence directed downwards and forwards (the temporal pole of Broca). It has three surfaces : an external, forming part of the general convexity of the hemisphere; an inferior, which rests on the great wing of the sphenoid and the adjacent part of the petrous portion of the temporal bone ; and a superior, which is situated within the Sylvian fissure and can be displayed by pulling up the operculum. The boundaries of the temporal lobe have been already indicated in the description of the other lobes, but may be recapitulated as follows. It is bomided behind by the lower part of the line drawn from the external parieto-occipital fissure to the praeoccipital notch. Above, it is limited by the horizontal part of the posterior limb of the Sylvian fissure and by a line continuing the horizontal direction backwards to meet the posterior boundary. Its inferior surface may be marked off from the occipital lobe by a line drawn from the prgeoccipital notch to the isthmus of the gyrus fornicatus. Three fissures traverse the temporal lobe in a direction parallel to its long axis. The first of these, the superior temporal or parallel fissure, is one of the most constant of the incomplete fissures of the cerebrum. The other two, termed middle and inferior temporal, seldom appear as well-marked sulci, being as a rule broken up by fissures and gyri crossing at right angles to their direction. The collateral fissure is approximately parallel to the three temporal sulci; it marks ofi' the temporal from the falciform lobe. The parallel fissure commences a short distance behind the apex of the lobe, and takes a course parallel to the posterior limb of the fissure of Sylvius. Its upturned extremity ends in the parietal lobe, where it is embraced by the angular gyrus. The middle temporal fissure runs in the same general direction as the parallel fissure but is placed at a lower level. It may communicate behind with the sulcus occipitalis anterior. The inferior temporal fissure is placed on the under surface near the lateral margin of the hemisphere. It is in a line with the inferior occipital fissure.729 TEMPOBAL LOBE—ISLAND OF BEIL Three convolutions are present on the outer surface, running in an antero- posterior direction. They are termed the superior, middle, and inferior temporal convolutions. They become confluent with one another at the apex of the lobe. The superior temporal or inframarginal convolution lies between the Sylvian and parallel fissures. It is continuous above with the supramarginal and angular gyri. The middle temporal convolution, placed between the parallel and the middle temporal fissures, is continuous behind with the angular gyrus and middle occipital convolution. It is usually joined to the inferior occipital by the fourth annectant gyrus. The inferior temporal convolution is situated on the lateral margin of the hemisphere. It may be connected to the inferior occipital convolution by a fifth annectant gyrus. The superior surface of the temporal lobe is in contact with the operculum. It is crossed by two or three (sometimes four) transverse temporal convolutions. (Heschl.) Dissection.—The student should now raise the operculum and at the same time draw the temporal lobe downwards in order to bring the island of Eeil into view. The large branches of the middle cerebral artery which lie among the convolutions of the island should be removed, together with the adherent pia mater. The CENTRAL LOBE or ISLAND OF REIL corresponds to the floor of the embry- onic fossa Sylvii, and is placed external to the claustrum. It is situated under cover of the operculum, and is also overlapped by the temporal lobe and by the part of the inferior frontal convolution in front of the ascending limb of the fissure of Sylvius. It is of a triangular form with the base placed uppermost, the apex forming a prominence, the iimen insulse, which separates the vallecula Sylvii from the fissure of the same name. It is surrounded, except at the limen, by a curved furrow, the sulcus circularis Reilii (Schwalbe). From five to seven convolutions, the gyri operti, radiate from the limen insulie. The island is divided into a larger anterior part (pars frontalis), and a smaller posterior part (pars parieto-falciformis) by a constant fissure, the sulcus centralis insulae (Hefftler and Eberstaller), which has the same direction, and is in the same plane, as the fissure of Rolando. The pars parieto-falciformis is usually termed pars temporo-parietalis ; a study of the development of this part of the island has shown, however, that it is connected with the falciform and not with the temporal lobe. (Cmniingham.) Dissection.—The student is recommended to defer the study of the convolutions on the mesial and tentorial sm^faces of the hemisphere until the dissection of the corpus callosum is completed, and to proceed as follows. He should make a horizontal section through the uppermost part of the cerebral hemispheres; this will display the central core of white matter (centrum, ovale minus) surrounded by a convoluted border of grey matter. Within the white matter a number of minute vessels wiU be seen which appear as bleeding points in a fresh brain (the puncta vasculosa vel cruenta). He may then remove successive thin sections until he reaches the level of the corpus callosum, the fibres of which, spreading out into the hemisphere, form an extensive white layer called the centrum ovale majus. A far more instructive dissection, however, can be made b,y cautiously tearing the brain substance in a direction from within outwards mitil the callosal fissure is reached. By the latter method the following points can be made out in an ordinary well-hardened brain: (1) The white fibres entering each convolution spreading out so as to end perpendicularly to the surface. (2) The fibres from the body of the corpus caUosmn passing at first hori- zontally outwards into the hemisphere and then diverging, some sweeping iipwards to the parietal and frontal lobes, others bending downwards into the temporal lobe and following the long axis of that lobe. At the point where they bend downwards they readily break, as they are here intersected by fibres passing upwards from the inner capsule. (3) The fibres from the anterior and posterior extremities of the corpus callosum passing in a cm-ved manner into the frontal and occipital lobes respectively, forming the forceps minor and the forceps major. (4) A set of fibres, known as the cingulum, which run within the gyrus fornicatus, forming a sagittally-directed arch. The dissector should next study the corpus callosum and the convolutions on the inner face of the hemisphere. The convolutions onTHE NEBVOUS SYSTEM 730 the tentorial siu^face may be learned from a momited specimen, or better still from a east of a cerebral hemisphere, and the actual convolutions can be examined when the hemi- spheres are cut away from the mesencephalon at a later stage. Mesial and tentorial surfaces of the hemisphere.—The mesial surface of the hemisphere is marked off from both the convex supero-external and the tentorial surface by the margin of the great longitudinal fissure. This margin follows a curved course as a well-defined border from the posterior extremity of the gyrus rectus as far as the occipital pole of the cerebrum. From this point it passes for- wards and pursues a slightly curved course to the splenium of the corpus callosum immediately beneath which it ends. The latter part is termed by Schwalbe the internal occipital border ; it is only seen in carefully-hardened brains, and appears as a rounded margin crossing the lobulus lingualis, and in front of this marking Fig. 411.—Convolutions and Fissures on the Mesial and Tentorial Surfaces OF the Hemisphere. PARACENTRAL LOBULE SULCUS PARACEXTRALIS CALLOSO-MARGINAL FISSURE DENTATE IMPRESSIO TENTORIAL UNCUS FISSURE PETROSA GROOVE the gyrus fornicatus immediately above its isthmus (fig. 411). The tentorial surface is marked off from the supero-external surface by a well-defined border which extends from the occipital pole to the extremity of the teniporo-sphenoidal lobe, forming a slight curve with the convexity upwards. The fissural system of the mesial and tentorial surfaces is of considerable importance and interest, as all the complete fissures of the cerebrum appear on these surfaces. These fissures are, as already mentioned, the internal parieto-occipital, the calcarine, the dentate, and the collateral. The calloso-marginal, a constant and important incomplete fissure, is also to be seen on the mesial surface. The ealloso-marginal fissure commences below the genu of the corpus callosum and pursues a curved course parallel to the corpus callosum until it reaches a point a short distance behind the upper extremity of the fissure of Eolando. It then bends upwards and extends on to the convex surface for a short distance, where it indents the upper end of the ascending parietal convolution. Two branches whichMESIAL AND TENTORIAL SURFACES OF HEMISPHERE 731 pass from this fissure deserve special mention as, although not constantly present, they form useful lines of demarcation. One of these, the sulcus paracentralis, passes upwards between the paracentral and the marginal convolutions. Another, the sulcus subparietalis, passes backwards from the bend of the main fissure and separates the praecuneus from the gyrus fornicatus. The parieto-occipital fissure commences at the isthmus of the gyrus fornicatus, and passes at first backwards and upwards, and then almost vertically upwards to reach the margin of the hemisphere, where it bends outwards and ends as the external parieto-occipital fissure. The calcarine fissure commences by a bifid extremity near the occipital pole, and passes horizontally forwards with a slightly curved course to become confluent with the parieto-occipital fissure. From what has been said, it follows that the internal parieto-occipital and calcarine fissures form by their union a -<-shaped figure. The hinder part of the stem of the -< and the fore part of the calcarine fissm-e produce an elevation within the posterior cornu of the lateral ventricle known as the hippocampus minor. It has been recently shown that in its development the stem of the < may belong to the parieto-occipital fissure alone, or to the calcarine alone, or may be common to both. (Cunningham.) The callosal fissure is a deep furrow which follows the curve of the corpus callosum, being placed between that body and the gyrus fornicatus. It commences below the rostrum and terminates behind the splenium, where it becomes continuous with the dentate fissure. The dentate or hippoeampal fissure extends from the splenium of the corpus callosum to the hooked extremity (uncus) of the uncinate gyrus. It produces an elevation in the descending cornu of the lateral ventricle, which is termed the hippocampus major. The collateral fissure is common to the occipital and temporal lobes. It passes from a point on the under surface of the temporal lobe, near its apex, to the occipital pole of the hemisphere. The reverse of this fissure appears as an elevation (the eminentia coUateralis) in the descending cornu of the lateral ventricle. The following convolutions appear on the mesial and tentorial surfaces :— The marginal convolution commences below the rostrum of the corpus callosum and occupies the area of the mesial surface between the calloso-marginal fissure and the margin of the hemisphere as far as the paracentral sulcus. The latter separates it from the paracentral lobule. It is continuous around the margin of the hemi- sphere with the olfactory, the internal orbital, and the superior frontal convolutions. It is marked by tertiary fissures along its whole course, in particular by a fissure which runs for some distance parallel to the calloso-marginal sulcus. The paracentral lobule is bounded in front by the paracentral sulcus; below and behind by the calloso-marginal fissure. It is continuous around the margin of the hemisphere with the ascending frontal and ascending parietal convolutions; but as it is connected with the former by a much broader band than with the latter, it is referred to the frontal lobe. (Broca.) When the typical backward turn of the upper extremity of the fissure of Kolando is present, it hooks backwards into the forward bend formed by the upper extremity of the calloso-marginal fissure, and thus the frontal and parietal lobes are only connected by a narrow isthmus between the two fissures. The gyrus fornicatus, or gyrus cinguli, commences between the rostrum of the corpus callosum and the extremity of the marginal convolution, and, pursuing an arched course parallel to the corpus callosum, ends in a narrow convo- lution, the isthmus, which connects it to the uncinate gyrus. It is placed between the calloso-marginal and callosal fissures, and is thus clearly marked off from adjacent structures in the greater part of its extent, but is often very732 THE NEBVOUS SYSTEM imperfectly separated from the superior parietal lobule. It may also be connected to the hinder end of the marginal convolution by a small gyrus crossing the calloso- marginal fissure. The prsecuneus, or quadrate lobule, is a squarish mass of small gyri which is continuous around the margin of the hemisphere with the superior parietal lobule. It is bounded, in front by the upturned end of the calloso-marginal fissure ; behind, by the parieto-occipital fissure; and it may be marked off below, from the gyrus fornicatus, by the sulcus subparietalis. The cuneus, or cuneate lobule, is a wedge-shaped mass occupying the interval between the internal parieto-occipital and calcarine fissures. It is continuous around the margin of the hemisphere with the superior occipital convolution. In a properly hardened right hemisphere it shows a distinct bevelling near the margin. This is produced by the impression of the superior longitudinal sinus. This bevelling can be traced downwards to the extremity of the lobulus lingualis, and less distinctly forwards to the pr?ecuneus. In rare instances it may be seen in the left hemisphere instead of the right. Two sagittally directed convolutions are situated on the tentorial surface. They are termed the superior and inferior occipito-temporal convolutions. The superior of these is divided into an anterior part called the uncinate gyrus, and a posterior part which is known as the lobulus lingualis. The uncinate convolution commences behind at the isthmus, by which it is continuous with the gyrus fornicatus, and ends immediately behind the anterior perforated space in a hook-like elevation, the uncus. It is separated from the dentate convolution by the dentate fissure, and is marked off' from the inferior occipito-temporal convolution by the collateral fissure and, in front of this, by the incisura temporalis. The outer part of the anterior end is marked by a distinct groove, which, as it is produced by the free edge of the tentorium cerebelli, may be called the tentorial groove (fig. 411). The uncinate convolution is covered with a peculiar fine network of white fibres, the substantia reticularis alba. These fibres are derived from the strise longitudinales laterales which pass from the splenium of the corpus callosum on to the isthmus, and from thence to the micinate gyrus. The dentate convolution or fascia dentata will be more conveniently described with the anatomy of the lateral ventricle, as it is usually dissected in connection with that cavity. The lobulus lingualis is the posterior part of the superior occipito-temporal convolution. It is bounded by the calcarine and parieto-occipital fissures above, and by the collateral fissure below. As the internal occipital border crosses this lobule it divides it into two parts, an upper part which appears on the mesial surface, and a larger lower portion situated on the tentorial surface. The inferior occipito-temporal convolution extends from the apex of the temporal lobe to the occipital pole of the hemisphere. It is bounded above by the collateral fissure, and below by the inferior temporal and inferior occipital fissures. It is marked by the impressio petrosa at the junction of its anterior and middle thirds. Three distinct impressions, which lie in a line with one another, are produced on the brain by the petrous portion of the temporal bone. One of these (fig. 410, n) corresponds to the portion of bone opposite the confluence of the superior petrosal with the lateral sinus. Another, the impressio petrosa, which may be large and conspicuous, is caused by the prominence of the superior semicircular canal. The third impression (incisura temporalis) is situated near the vallecula Sylvii, about one-third of an inch external to the tentorial groove. FALCIFORM LOBE; LIMBIC LOBE.—The falciform lobe is the name proposed by Schwalbe for the portion of the cerebral surface which cannot be satisfactorily relegated to any of the five lobes above described. Its separation as a distinct lobe depends more upon considera- tions based upon comparative anatomy and embryology than upon any indications affordedFALCIFOBM LOBE—COBPUS CALLOSUM 733 by the adult himian brain. It is incompletely divided into two segments by the corpus callosum. The outer segment (limbic lobe of Broca) is formed by the gyrus fornicatus and the micinate convolution. These two convolutions, with the isthmus which unites them, form a remarkable ring-like gyrus open only at the anterior perforated space. The inner segment comprises the septum lucidum, the fascia dentata, and the fornix. Of the remaining convolutions on the mesial and tentorial surfaces, the marginal and paracentral belong to the frontal lobe ; the prsecmieus to the parietal lobe; the cmieus, lobulus lingualis, and posterior portion of the inferior occipito-temporal, to the occipital lobe ; and the anterior part of the inferior occipito-temporal to the temporal lobe. The Corpus Callosum is a great white commissure which unites the cerebral hemispheres. Its form can be well studied in a mesial section of the brain (fig. 412).. Here it is seen to form a longitudinal arch with rounded anterior and Fig. 412.—Mesial Section of Entire Brain. (After Henle.) The (*) points to the anterior extremity of the gyrus fornicatus ; above it is the basal white commissure. POSTERIOR SULCUS OF MIDDLE FORAMEN COMMISSURE MONRO COMMISSURE OF MONRO PONS CORPUS CINEREUM ALBICANS posterior extremities. The posterior extremity is called the splenium; it is rounded off behind and is formed by the corpus callosum doubling on itself, so that a small portion is folded forw^ards under, and in close opposition to, the larger part (fig. 413). The anterior extremity or genu is less sharply bent than the posterior end. It is continued downwards and backwards into a portion which appears pointed in section and is called the rostrum. The rostrum is connected to the lamina cinerea by a thin layer of white substance, the basal white commissure. The portion which intervenes between the splenium and rostrum, and which con- stitutes the greater part of the corpus callosum, is called the body. The under surface of the body is adherent behind to the fornix, and in front to the septum lucidum. In coronal sections (figs. 415, 423) it can be seen that the under surfaceTHE NEBVOUS SYSTEM 734 is free for some distance, except at its attachment in the middle line to the fornix and septum lucidmn. This free portion forms the roof of the lateral ventricles. The upper surface remains free for a shorter distance than the lower, and ends at the floor of the callosal fissure, where the fibres of the corpus callosum enter the sub- stance of the hemisphere. It forms in the transverse direction a gentle curve with the concavity directed upwards. Viewed from above, the corpus callosum is seen to present a transverse striation, this being an indication of the bundles of fibres passing from hemisphere to hemisphere. These transverse striations are crossed superficially by narrow longitudinal bands, the strise longitudinales and the strife longitudinales laterales or t^eni^e tectse. The striae longitudinales are placed one on each side of the middle line, and lie very close together, leaving a narrow interval between them which is called the raphe. Traced forwards, they slightly diverge and pass round the genu to the Fig. 413.—A Dissection of the AVhite Matter of the Posterior Part of THE Eight Cerebral Hemisphere. (Viewed from the inner side.

If the striae longi- tudinales be traced backwards, they will be seen to diverge as they pass round the splenium and join the forceps major on each side. The tsenisB tectse are placed on the upper surface of the corpus callosum under cover of the gyrus fornicatus. They pass backwards over the splenium and spread out on the isthmus of the gyrus fornicatus and on the uncinate convolution to form the substantia reticularis alba. They are merely stray bundles of a system of fibres (cingulum) which is contained within the gyrus fornicatus. The fibres of the corpus callosum after entering the cerebral substance spread out to every part of the hemispheres (with the exception of small portions of the temporal lobes) in the following sets :— The fibres from the genu pass forwards and outwards into the anterior part of the frontal lobe, and then sweep inwards forming the forceps minor.735 COBPUS CALLOSUM—LATERAL VENTBICLES The fibres from the body have the following distribution :—The uppermoist fibres pass outwards and then upwards, and finally curve inwards to the upper and mesial surfaces of the frontal and parietal lobes. The intermediate fibres pass transversely outwards to the same lobes. The lowest fibres form the roof of the lateral ventricle, and are separated from that cavity only by the ependyma and epithelium, and divide into anterior and posterior sets which are differently distributed. The anterior set ends in the operculum. The posterior set forms a layer called the tapetum which follows the descending and posterior cornua of the lateral ventricle, roofing over and bounding these cornua externally. The part which follows the descending cornu is destined for the temporal lobe. The portion which accompanies the posterior cornu passes to the under part of the occipital lobe. The fibres from the splenium, and from the part which is folded below it, pass backwards and outwards, and then sweep inwards forming the forceps major,* the fibres of which pass to the posterior and upper parts of the occipital lobe. Dissection.—Having completed the examination of the corpus callosum and of the mesial surface of the hemisphere, the student should next tuxn. his attention to the lateral Fig. 414.—Diageammatic Coronal Section of Third and Lateral Ventricles. (From Schwalbe, slightly modified.) LA 'J'L'/IA L VESTRICLK The red lines indicate the epithelium. ventricles. The remaining fibres of the body of the corpus callosum shoidd be divided a little to the right of the middle line and reflected outwards. This dissection wall expose the body and anterior cornu of the lateral ventricle. The posterior and descending cornua should next be exposed by removing their outer wall. The Lateral Ventricles are cavities in the cerebral hemispheres which are continuous with the third ventricle and with one another, through the foramen commune anterius (page 738). They are roofed over, as already described, by the corpus callosmn, and are lined throughout by epithelium, which is reflected over the choroid plexuses, and is not continuous with the lining of the third ventricle except at the foramina of Monro. This epithelial lining forms the ventricular Avail in the region of the so-called transverse fissure, through ^vhich the choroid plexus projects. This fissure is therefore not a breach in the ventricle, but simply a thin part of the wall through which the locally thickened pia mater (choroid plexus) can be seen. Each lateral ventricle consists of a central part or body and three cornua : an anterior, an inferior or descending, and a posterior.7S6 THE NEBVOUS SYSTEM The body may be defined as the portion of the ventricle which extends from the foramen of Monro to the point where the cavity bifurcates into its posterior and descending cornua. It corresponds ahnost exactly in length to the portion of the optic thalamus which lies free within the ventricular cavity. It is greatest in its antero-posterior, and smallest in its vertical diameter. It is limited on the inner side by the attachment of the fornix to the corpus callosum, and by the narrow posterior part of the septum lucidum. On the outer side it is bounded by the fibres I of the corpus callosum entering the substance of the hemisphere. Its floor looks upwards and slightly inwards, as can be well seen in coronal sections, and is formed by a series of structures which trend forwards with an inclination inwards. These structures are placed in the following order from without inwards :—the caudate Fig. 415.—Coronal Section of the Hemispheres passing through the Anterior Cornua of the Lateral Ventricles. (From a mounted specimen in the Anatomical Department of Trinity College, Dublin.) i nucleus of the corpus striatum, the tfenia semicircularis and lamina cornea, the ! optic thalamus, the choroid plexus and the fornix (figs. 414 and 419). I The anterior cornu is directed forwards, downwards, and outwards. It appears i crescentic in outline both in coronal and horizontal section. The concavity of j the crescent looks downwards and outwards, and is caused by the projection of the \ caudate nucleus into the cavity. The anterior cornu is bounded internally by the i septum lucidum, which forms a thin vertical partition between the anterior cornua | of opposite sides. i The posterior cornu is horizontal in its whole course, and is directed at first ! backwards and outwards, and afterwards backwards and inwards. It presents on | its inner wall a curved prominence, the hippocampus minor or calcar avis; and ! above this a second prominence, the bulb of the cornu, which is caused by a part [ of the forceps major projecting into the cavity. The hippocampus minor is caused i by a fold of the cerebral wall, and corresponds to the calcarine fissure on the | mesial surface of the hemisphere (fig. 416). Its floor presents a slight elevation, : caused by the fasciculus longitudinalis inferior. i I.LATERAL VENTRICLES Tdl Dissection.—The operculum should next be pulled upwards, when the small portion of substance still attaching it to the brain will be broken through. A complete view of the island of Eeil is then obtained. Lastly, the student should make a series of thin sagittal sections through the island of Reil and the frontal lobe until the great transverse fissmx and its relation to the descending cornu of the lateral ventricle is seen (fig. 417). The sections will pass through the lenticular and caudate nuclei of the corpus striatum and through the optic thalannis. The inferior or descending cornu pursues a more curved and complicated course than the other two cornna. It is directed at first outwards and backwards, and then bends somewhat sharply downwards; lastly, it sweeps forwards with an inclination inwards, following the long axis of the temporo-sphenoidal lobe.

Lateral sinus t'o IIPCS DKXTATi\][ Tentorium eerebeUi ! transverse section it is seen to be somewhat triangular, presenting a floor, an inner wall, and a curved roof wdiicli bounds the cavity above and externally. The floor is formed by the eminentia collateralis. The following structures appear on the inner wall:—the hippocampus major, ending in the pes hippocampi; the corpus fimbriatum ; and the choroid plexus, the latter apparently passing through a fissure (the great transverse fissure). The roof is formed from within outw^ards by the taenia semicircularis, by the narrow posterior prolongation of the caudate nucleus of the corpus striatum, and by the tapetum. At the extremity of the cornu the roof is formed by the amygdaloid tubercle. The taenia semicircularis and caudate I nucleus may be traced to this tubercle. The eminentia collateralis is a smooth triangular elevation, which commences I in the interval between the hippocampus major and minor, and extends, narrowing as it proceeds, nearly to the extremity of the descending cornu. It is the indenta- tion of the ventricular wall produced by the collateral fissure. j The hippocampus major, or cornu Ammonis, is a curved white body which ends in a blunt extremity (pes hippocampi), on which are small indentations, giving it 3 B738 THE NERVOUS SYSTEM an obscure resemblance to the paw of an animal. It corresponds to the dentate fissure. The corpus fimbriatum, taenia hippocampi, or fimbria, is a narrow strip of white matter with a somewhat wavy appearance, which is placed along the concave side of the hippocampus major. It is formed by a portion of the fibres of the fornix continued into the descending cornu, and presents apparently a free edge towards the transverse fissure, but is in reality continued into the epithelium which covers the choroid plexus. When this epithelium is torn through and the choroid plexus pushed forwards, the fascia dentata is exposed ; the latter structure is placed in the floor of the dentate fissure, between the fimbria and the uncinate gyrus. The choroid plexuses are vascular fringes formed by an infolding of the pia mater in the region of the so-called great transverse fissure. They extend from Fig. 417.—A Dissection of the Descending Cornu of the Lateral Ventricle, WITH A Sagittal Section through the Basal Ganglia. the termination of the descending cornua to the foramina of Monro, through which they disappear. The epithelial lining of the ventricle passes from the thin (apparently free) edge of the fimbria over the choroid plexus to the tsenia semicircularis. This epithelium, which is the morphological wall of the cornu, excludes the choroid plexus (strictly speaking) from the ventricular cavity. The foramina of Monro are the apertures through which the lateral ventricles communicate with the third ventricle, forming at their communication a Y-shaped passage, the foramen commune anterius, by means of which the lateral ventricles of opposite sides communicate with one another. The choroid plexuses of the lateral ventricles are continuous with one another through this passage. Each foramen of Monro is crescentic in outline, and is bounded in front and above by the anterior pillars of the fornix; below and behind by the anterior extremity of the optic thalamus ; and behind by the reflexions of epithelium from the fornix and optic thalamus on to the choroid plexus.739 LATEBAL VENTRICLES—BASAL GANGLIA The fascia dentata, or dentate convolution, is the free edge of the grey matter of the hemisphere, and derives its name from its characteristically notched or indented appearance. It is placed at the inner side of the dentate fissure, and follows this fissure upwards towards the splenium of the corpus callosum, where it becomes continuous with the fasciola cinerea. The fasciola cinerea is a grey lamina resembling the fascia dentata but with a smooth margin. It ends just above the splenium of the corpus callosum. Dissection.—The student should slice away the left hemisphere and expose the lateral ventricle of that side, leaving the central portion of the corpus caUosum in situ for the Fig. 418.—A Dissection showing the Free or Intraventricular Portion of the Caudate Nucleus.

If he has carried out the dissection as recommended on the right side, he will now be in a position to study the corpus striatum both in hori- zontal and vertical section, and at the same time to examine its intraventricular part more fuUy. The horizontal sections will pass through both nuclei of the corpus striatum with the inner and outer capsules, the claustrum, and a portion of the optic thalamus (fig. 419). Basal Ganglia of the HEMisrHERES A series of ganglionic masses is placed in the base of each cerebral hemisphere. They are subjacent (with the exception of the amygdaloid nucleus) to the island of Reil and form, with that lobe, the oldest part of the hemisphere; that is to say, they constitute the portion which is (as already mentioned) the first to appear both in the vertebrate series and also in the development of the individual. They are all semi-detached local thickenings of the grey cortex, and may be enumerated as follows:—the corpora striata, each composed of two nuclei, the nucleus caudatus 3 B 2THE NEBVOUS SYSTEM 740 and the nucleus lenticularis ; the claustra, and the amygdaloid nuclei. The optic thalami are in close proximity to the corpora striata, but belong to the thalam- encephalon. Certain important fasciculi of white matter are intimately related to the corpora striata. The chief of these white fasciculi are the inner and outer capsules, the anterior commissure, and the taenia semicircularis. The nucleus caudatus is an elongated mass of grey matter somewhat resembling a pear with a long curved stalk. It presents a free, or ventricular, surface, and a surface which is embedded in the hemisphere. It is thickest at the anterior end, or head. The free surface of the anterior thickened portion looks upwards and inwards, and bulges into the anterior horn of the lateral ventricle. From thence it ascends with an inclination outwards to the body of the ventricle, where it forms i the outermost constituent of the floor of that cavity, and narrows into the com- mencement of the tail. In this situation it is separated from the optic thalamus by the lamina cornea and taenia semicircularis. The tail of the nucleus caudatus then j passes into the descending cornu. It is placed at first in front of the cornu, after- ' wards forms part of the roof of that cavity, and ends at the amygdaloid tubercle. The deep surface of the caudate nucleus is separated from the nucleus lenticularis by a layer of white matter called the inner ca.psule. The two nuclei are, however, connected by bands of grey matter which intersect the fibres of the anterior limb of the inner capsule, and are directly continuous for a short distance in front. The nucleus lenticularis is embedded in the substance of the hemisphere except at the base of the brain, where it comes to the surface for a small part of its extent at the anterior perforated space. Here it is continuous externally with the claustrum and, as before stated, with the nucleus caudatus. In horizontal section it appears like a bi-convex lens, with its surface directed outwards and inwards, the outer surface forming a curve of larger radius than the inner. In sagittal section the lenticular nucleus is also somewhat lens-shaped in outline (fig. 417). In coronal sections through the anterior part it appears crescentic, with the convexity turned downwards and outwards (fig. 415); but in successive sections taken from before backwards the crescentic gives place to a triangular or wedge-shaped outline (fig. 421). In fresh brains this grey mass can be seen to be traversed by thin white intersections, the internal and external medullary laminae, which divide it into three zones. The middle and inner zones are of a yellowish grey colour, and constitute the globus pallidus. The outer zone is of a darker reddish grey, and is traversed with fine white striae. It is called the putamen. The putamen is the longest part of the lenticular nucleus, and is the only portion of that body which is continuous with the caudate nucleus. The above agrees substantially with the account which is given by Schwalbe; this anatomist, however, describes the amygdaloid nucleus as discontinuous with the tail of the caudate nucleus. According to Foster and Sherrington, the globus pallidus of the lenticular [ nucleus as well as the putamen is continuous with the caudate nucleus. A band of white fibres, the ansa lenticularis, passes inwards below the inner capsule. It emerges from the under surface of the lenticular nucleus, being continued from the . medullary laminae. It also receives fibres from the inner segment of the globus pallidus. The ansa lenticularis enters the subthalamic region and passes beneath the red nucleus, | where it becomes indistinct. [ The claustrum is a thin band of grey matter which is placed, nearly vertically, ' external to the lenticular nucleus, and separated from the latter, except at its lower I part, by the outer capsule. It is separated from the grey matter of the island of Eeil by a layer of white matter, into which it sends small pointed processes ; corresponding to the gyri operti of the island. It is fused at its anterior end with i the amygdaloid nucleus. (Hill.) The amygdaloid nucleus is a thickening of the grey cortex of the apex of the temporal lobe, and produces a bulging (amygdaloid tubercle) into the roof of the j extremity of the descending cornu of the lateral ventricle. jBASAL GANGLIA OF HEMISPHEBES 741 The tsenia semicircularis, or stria terminalis, is a band of fibres which passes upwards and backwards from the anterior pillar of the fornix, and traverses the groove between the caudate nucleus and the optic thalamus. It is reinforced by some fibres from the anterior cornu of the lateral ventricle. It accompanies the caudate nucleus into the roof of the descending cornu, and ends in the amygdaloid nucleus. In its course along the groove above mentioned it is partly covered by Fig. 419. -Horizontal Section of the Cerebrum. (After Landois and Stirling.)

The inner capsule is a broad baud of white fibres which is placed on the inner side of the nucleus lenticularis. In horizontal section it presents an anterior limb between the two nuclei of the corpus striatum, and a posterior limb which separates the nucleus lenticularis from the optic thalamus. These two limbs meet at an angle salient inwards. This angle is called the genu, and is placed adjacent to the taenia semicircularis. In vertical section the inner capsule presents a beautiful arched arrangement of radiating white fibres (fig. 417).742 THE NEBVOUS SYSTEM The outer capsule, much narrower than the inner, is a band of white fibres which intervenes between the claustrum and the nucleus lenticularis. In a horizontal section through the basal ganglia of the hemisphere and adjacent part of the thalamencephalon, an alternation of grey and white layers is seen in the following order from without inwards :—(1) the grey matter of the island of Eeil; (2) the white matter of the same lobe ; (3) the claustrum; (4) the outer capsule ; (5) the nucleus lenticu- laris ; (6) the inner capsule; (7) the nucleus caudatus and optic thalamus, separated from one another by the taenia semicircularis (fig. 419). The anterior commissure bounds the third ventricle in front, but belongs to the cerebral hemispheres, as it is developed in connection with the lamina terminalis. It presents a cylindrical free surface towards the third ventricle, where it appears like a small transverse bar in the interval between the anterior pillars of the fornix. It passes outwards in front of the fornix, and traverses the cerebral substance below the lenticular nucleus on each side (fig. 421), the fibres inclining backwards and assuming a twisted arrangement as it proceeds. It ends in the temporal lobe. Dissection.—The student should cut through the remaining part of the corpus callosum about the middle, raise the posterior portion, carefully detaching it from the subjacent fornix, and throw it backwards. This dissection will reveal the body and the diverging posterior pillars of the fornix. He should then raise the anterior portion of the corpus callosum, and snip through the septmn lucidum with a sharp pair of scissors. The slit-like fifth ventricle will now be visible, or may be brought into view by gently separating the laminae of the septum lucidum with the point of the scalpel. The fornix should next be examined and then divided by cutting through its body and throwing the parts backwards and forwards. By this dissection the so-called transverse fissure will be opened up and the velum interpositum exposed. The FORNIX is a longitudinally-arched bundle of fibres composed of two symmetrical halves which are united together at the central part, forming the body, but diverge in front and behind, constituting the anterior and posterior pillars. The body forms a curve parallel to the corpus callosum, to the under surface of which it is adherent. It is narrowest and thickest in front, widest and thinnest behind. It lies on the velum interpositum, which separates it from the third ventricle and from the optic thalami. The outer portions of its upper surface are placed in the body of the lateral ventricles, covered by the epithelium which passes at the thin outer margin of the fornix into the epithelial covering of the choroid plexuses. The posterior pillars diverge from the body, passing backwards and outwards. In the interval between them the splenium of the corpus callosum can be seen if viewed from below. This is marked by faint longitudinal, transverse, and oblique lines, and is described as the lyre. The posterior pillars expand as they pass outwards and enter the descending cornua of the lateral ventricles. A conspicuous bundle of fornix fibres passes along the concave border of the hippocampus major as the fimbria, which can be traced to the uncus. Other fibres are scattered over the hippocampus major and the eminentia collateralis. The anterior pillars sweep downwards with a sharper curve than the corpus callosum, and so diverge from it, leaving an interval which is occupied by the septum lucidum. They descend, in the form of two rounded slightly-diverging bundles, immediately behind the anterior commissure. Here they are joined by the taeniae semicireulares, and receive fibres from the peduncles of the pineal body and from the septum lucidum. In this situation they present a free surface, except in front, where they give attachment to the septum lucidum. Having reached the base of the brain, they end in the grey nuclei of the corpora albicantia. The anterior pillars of the fornix were formerly described as twisting on themselves to form bends or loops in the base of the brain, the corpora albicantia, the fibres after forming the bend being continued upwards on the inner sides of the descending anterior pillars asFOBNIX—SEPTUM LUCIDUM 745 the bundles of Vicq d'Azyr. This description is borne out by macroscopic dissection, but it has been shown that the bundles of Vicq d'Azyr are discontinuous with the fornix fibres^ (Forel and Gudden.) The septum lucidum is formed by thin portions of the hemisphere walls, which have become approximated and in part fused, but are separated in the greater part of their extent by the fifth ventricle. It appears as two closely approximated thin vertical laminge, separating the anterior cornua of the lateral ventricles of opposite sides. It is attached above and in front to the under surface of the body and back of the genu of the corpus callosum, below to the rostrum and to the basal white commissure, and behind to the anterior pillars of the fornix. Viewed from the side, it is triangular in outline, with an acute angle directed backwards and occupy- ing the narrow interval between the front of the body of the fornix and the corpus callosum (fig. 412). Each of the two laminae which constitute the septum lucidum contains three layers: a layer of ependyma and epithelium next the lateral ventricle, a middle layer of white fibres, and a layer of rudimentary grey matter next the fifth ventricle. A layer of connective tissue immediately bounding the fifth ventricle (rudimentary pia-matral layer) is described by Testut. The fifth or Sylvian ventricle is a narrow, sagittally-directed, slit-like cavity which originally formed a part of the great longitudinal fissure. It does not communicate with any of the true ventricles of the brain. The great transverse fissure of the cerebrum is of a horse-shoe shape, and extends from the foramen of Monro on each side to the termination of the descending cornu of the lateral , ventricle. It is not a fissure in the sense of forming a communication between the ventricles and the exterior of the brain, but it may be considered as a fissure in the same sense that we use the term ' complete fissm-e.' If we compare it with the adjacent dentate fissiu-e, we find that the latter produces a bulging (the hippocampus major) into the ventricular cavity. This bulging contains an inner layer of white and a outer layer of grey matter, and is simply a fold of the ventricular wall, which is here thinner than elsewhere. The floor of the dentate fissm-e is occupied by pia mater. Now if we suppose the substance of the hippocampus thinned away mitil only the epithelial lining of the ventricle was left, this epithelium would come in contact v/ith the external pia mater, and an arrangement resembling the choroid plexus, coming through a fissure, the hippocampal fissure, would be produced. The choroid plexus is therefore an internal com^olution reduced to a layer of epithelium forming the morphological wall of the ventricle, and produced by a fissure, the great transverse fissure, which is occupied b,y a specialised and highly vascular part of the pia mater. In comparing the great transverse fissure with the complete fissures of the cerebral hemispheres, however, w^e must not lose sight of the fact that it is not limited to the hemisphere wall (except at its extremities in the temporal lobes), but is produced, for the greater part of its extent, by the folding of the prosencephalon over the thalamencephalon (page 709). According to Merkel and Mierzejewsk3\ small slit-like apertures are found in the region of the transverse fissure near the termination of the descending horn of the lateral ventricle. These place the cavity of the lateral ventricle in communication with the subarachnoid space. The velum interpositum, or tela choroidea superior, is a large triangular fold of pia mater which overlies the third ventricle. The body and posterior pillars of the fornix and the splenimn of the corpus callosum rest on its upper surface. It . is continuous laterally with the choroid plexuses of the lateral ventricles, which are simply the convoluted and highly vascular margins of the fold. Traced backwards, the layers are seen to divaricate and to become continuous with the pia mater covering the tentorial surface of the occipital lobes and the upper surface of the cerebellum. Two large veins, the veins of Galen, commence at the anterior extremity of the velum interpositum. The veins of Galen are chiefly formed by the veins of the corpora striata, and are continued backwards in the middle line to end in the straight sinus. In this course they lie in a prolongation of the subarachnoid space between the two layers of pia mater which form the velum interpositum, and usually unite into one vein before entering the straight sinus.744 THE NEBVOUS SYSTEM The under surface of the velum interpositum rests on the inner parts of the optic thalami, and between the latter it is placed directly over the third ventricle, where it is covered by a layer of epithelium continuous with the lining of that cavity, but discontinuous with the epithelium of the lateral ventricles, except at the foramina of Monro. The choroid plexuses extend from the extremity of the descending cornu of each side to the foramen of Monro where they become continuous with one another through the foramen commune anterius. From the junction of the two plexuses Fig. 420.—Horizontal Section of the Cerebral Hemispheres. (From a mounted specimen in the Anatomical Department of Trinity College, Dublin.)

Dissection.—The student should divide the splenium of the corpus callosum in the middle line, and remove the portions of the hemispheres which lie posterior to the great transverse fissure; they will readily separate at the fissure, and break off at the extremitiesCHOBOID PLEXUSES—THALAMENCEPHALON 745 of the temporal lobes. This operation should be conducted with gentleness, as the walls of the third ventricle are very prone to become miduly divaricated by this dissection. The part removed should be re-examined, as the relations between the fissures and hippocampi can be studied to great advantage at this stage. The cavity of the third ventricle may now be displayed by raising the velum interpositum, and reflecting it backwards. This must be done cautiously, as the pineal body is closely enfolded in the posterior part of the under layer of that membrane, and an attempt should be made to retain it in its proper place. The dissector should thoroughly examine the cavity and floor of the third ventricle and the free surfaces of the optic thalami, but is recommended to dissect the deep surfaces of the latter bodies in connection with the mesencephalon. The Thalamencephalon The THIRD VENTRICLE is a narrow cavity whose lateral walls are so closely approximated that in coronal sections it appears as a vertical slit. It communi- cates in front with the lateral ventricles by the foramina of Monro. Behind, it is continuous with the fourth ventricle through a narrow passage, the aqueduct of Sylvius. The opening into the aqueduct is bounded above by a transverse white bundle of fibres, the posterior commissure; and, above this, a prolongation of the Fig. 421.—Coronal Section through the Anterior Part of the Third Ventricle.

The third ventricle is covered by the corpus callosum, the fornix, and the velum interpositum ; its true roof, however, is formed by the epithelium lining the under surface of the last-named structure. The central part of its cavity is crossed transversely by the middle or grey commissure. It is bounded, laterally by the aptic thalami, and in front by the anterior pillars of the fornix and by the anterior commissure. It is limited behind by the commencement of the aqueduct of Sylvius, by the posterior commissure, and by the reflexion of epithelium from the tipper surface of the pineal body on to the under surface of the velum interpositum.746 THE NERVOUS SYSTEM I In the anterior part of the ventricle the floor is marked off from the lateral walls | by the anterior pillars of the fornix, which, after forming part of the anterior boundary, sweep backwards with an inclination downwards : in this situation they are covered by a thin layer of the central grey substance of the ventricle, and project as slight ridges. The third ventricle is relatively shallow for about the posterior third of its extent, but in its anterior two-thirds it presents a deep recess j which is divided into an anterior and a posterior part by a prominent ridge. This j ridge is formed by the junction of the tuber cinereum and the lamina cinerea above the optic commissure. The floor is formed by the following structures :— behind, by the tegmental portion of the diverging crura cerebri, and between them by the posterior perforated space ; in front of this by the corpora albicantia, the tuber cinereum with the infundibulum and the lamina cinerea. The latter slopes upwards to the anterior commissure, and is relegated by some anatomists to the | anterior wall instead of to the floor. | The central grey matter of the third ventricle is continuous behind with the grey matter | of the aqueduct of Sylvius, and passes in front into the basal grey commissure. It also i covers the lower parts of the internal surfaces of the optic thalami, and gives a thin covering to the anterior pillars of the fornix and to the bundles of Vicq d'Azyr. The optic thalami are a pair of large ganglia placed one on each side of the third ventricle. Each optic thalamus is a short prismatic body whose long axis is i directed forwards and inwards. This axis is not straight, but is slightly curved with its convexity upwards. The thalamus presents an anterior and a posterior extremity or tubercle, and four surfaces: a superior and an internal which are free, and an inferior and an external which are imbedded in the cerebral substance. The anterior tubercle is a blunt rounded point which forms the posterior boundary of the foramen of Monro. The posterior tubercle, or pulvinar, \ is broader than the anterior, and is compressed from above downwards. It is | directed backwards and downwards; it is continued externally into the outer j ( geniculate body, and overhangs the inner geniculate body. It is placed above and | in front of the descending cornu of the lateral ventricle, but is separated from I the cavity of the latter by the choroid plexus. The superior surface shows a slight convexity, more pronounced in the antero-posterior than in the transverse | direction. It is covered with a layer of white fibres. It presents a groove, the sulcus i choroideus, which underlies the free edge of the fornix, separated from the latter only by the velum interpositum. This groove marks off an antero-external area, i wider in front than behind, which ends in the anterior tubercle and which forms j part of the floor of the lateral ventricle. Internal to the sulcus choroideus is a i larger area, which is covered by the fornix and velum interpositum. This area is i limited internally for about its anterior half by the stria pinealis, or peduncle of j the pineal body, a white bundle of fibres which runs along the sharp edge which separates the superior from the median surface. The posterior part of this area | slopes gradually into the pulvinar. Between the superior surface and the posterior j part of the stria pinealis is a small triangular area, the trigonum. habenulae, which | is sunk below the level of the adjacent part of the thalamus. The internal } surface is nearly flat and bounds the cavity of the third ventricle, towards which j it presents a slight convexity. It is of a pale-grey colour owing to a thick layer 1 of ependyma covering the ganglionic substance, and is united to its fellow of the | opposite side by a broad band of grey matter, the middle or grey commissure (commissura mollis). It is crossed at its lower margin by a groove, the sulcus of j Monro, which passes from the foramen of Monro to the commencement of the j aqueduct of Sylvius. The external surface rests against the fibres of the inner j capsule behind the genu, being separated from the nucleus lenticularis by the inner i capsule. The inferior surface is placed over the crus cerebri, on the tegmental j part of which it rests.OPTIC THALAMI—PINEAL BODY , In coronal sections through the posterior part of the thalamus, the external surface is seen to be separated from the inferior surface by a distinct angle; but in similar sections through the anterior part the two siurfaces pass into one another, the angle being rounded off. The grey substance of the thalamus is indistinctly marked off into three nuclei: an antero-superior, an external, and an internal. The largest part of the antero-superior nucleus forms the anterior tubercle ; the thinner portion passes backwards above and between the other two nuclei; its shape has been not inaptly compared to that of the caudate nucleus. A remarkable bundle of white fibres, the ansa lenticularis, passes below the optic thalamus and inner capsule from the lenticular nucleus of the corpus striatum. The pineal body (epiphysis cerebri or conarium) is a reddish-grey body about the size of a cherry-stone. It has the form of a flattened cone, compressed from above downwards. Its long axis is directed forwards and slightly upwards. Its base is directed forwards and passes into a bilaminar stalk. Its superior surface Fig. 422.—Coronal Section through the Middle Commissure of the Third Ventricle. (Schwalbe.) is covered by epithelium for the anterior two-thirds or three-fourths of its extent, and bounds in part the cavity of the third ventricle. Its inferior surface rests in the mesial groove between the superior quadrigeminal bodies, separated from the latter by a fold of pia mater. The stalk of the pineal body is continuous by its lower lamina with the posterior commissure. Its upper lamina passes into the peduncle or stria pinealis, w^hich passes at first outwards, and then forwards, along the margin of the optic thalamus which separates the upper and mesial surfaces of that body ; it then crosses the floor of the foramen of Monro and joins the anterior pillars of the fornix. The recussus pinealis is a diverticulum from the cavity of the third ventricle, which extends into the stalk and a short distance into the body of the conarium. Within the pineal body, and in the adjacent part of the velum interpositum, a number of gritty particles (acervulus cerebri, brain sand) are found. These particles consist chiefly of phosphate and carbonate of calcium. The pineal body was formerly described as a gland (pineal gland)THE NEBVOUS SYSTEM 748 but is now known to be a rudimentary unpaired eye. This pineal eye lies close to the surface in some of the lower vertebrates, and was probably functional at a former period. A great parietal foramen in the extinct reptile Ichthyosaurus is strongly suggestive of a functional pineal eye. The posterior commissure is a transverse band of fibres which projects into the posterior part of the cavity of the third ventricle. It contains fibres which connect the optic thalami of opposite sides. It probably contains decussating fibres derived from the fillet (page 782), from the posterior longitudinal bundles, and from the brachia of the nates (page 751). It belongs, therefore, more to the mesencephalon than to the thalamencephalon. The subthalamic tegmental region and the corpora geniculata will be more conveniently described with the mesencephalon. Fig. 423.—Coronal Section through the Third Ventricle behind the Middle Commissure. (Gegenbaur.) CORPUS CALLOSUiM FORNIX OPTIC THALAMUS MIDDLE COMMISSURE SUBSTANTIA NIGRA CRUST A. The basal grey commissure is a continuous plate of grey matter which is formed from behind forwards by the posterior perforated space, the tuber cinereum, and the lamina cinerea. The posterior perforated space is a stratum of grey matter which is perforated by a number of small vessels derived from the commencements of the posterior cerebral and superior cerebellar arteries. It occupies the back part of the inter- peduncular space and extends for a short distance under cover of the pons, where it bounds a recess, the foramen caecum anterius. It is continuous laterally with the grey matter of the tegmenta of the crura cerebri, and is attached in front to the corpora albicantia. The portion of the space which is situated in front of the exit of the third nerve forms part of the floor of the third ventricle ; the posterior part belongs to the mesencephalon. The corpora albicantia appear as a pair of white knobs in the base of the brain. Each contains in its interior a grey nucleus. This nucleus is joined by the anterior pillar of the fornix and the bundle of Vicq d'Azyr of the same side. The bundle of Vicq d'Azyr passes upwards and forwards through the grey matter of the optic thalamus to the anterior tubercle of that body. The tuber cinereum is a grey elevation placed immediately behind the opticBASAL GREY COMMISSUBE 749 commissure. It is the largest part of the basal grey commissm^e, and is continuous laterally, above the optic tracts, with the grey cortex of the temporal lobes (fig. 421). In front it passes over the optic commissure into the lamina cinerea. It is continued below into a conical process, the infundibulum, which is directed down- wards and slightly forwards, through the minute central opening in the diaphragma sell^e to end in the posterior lobe of the pituitary body. The upper part of the infundibulum is hollowed out by a diverticulum of the third ventricle, the recessus infandibuli. The tuber cinereum and infundibulum correspond to the median recess in the floor of the third ventricle. The pituitary body, or hypophysis cerebri, is a small ellipsoidal body which is lodged in the pituitary fossa of the sphenoid bone. Its long axis is directed transversely, and its antero-posterior and vertical diameters are about equal. The pituitary body consists of two distinct lobes, an anterior and a posterior. The anterior lobe is of a reddish-grey colour, and is considerably larger than the posterior lobe, which it partially embraces. The posterior lobe, of a yellowish-grey colour, is lodged in a recess in the anterior lobe, and is the only part connected with the infimdibulum. This body was formerly described as the pituitary gland, because it was supposed to secrete the pituita, or mucus of the nose. According to Gaskell's ingenious theory, the infandibidum is the mouth of an archaic alimentary canal. The ventricidar system of the brain is the rudiment of the cephalic stomach as found in Arthropods. The central canal of the spinal cord is the archaic intestine, and the nem^o-enteric canal (an embryonic com- munication between the neural tube and the intestine) connects this archaic intestine with the ano-rectal region. The pituitary body is of great interest in the light of this theory, as it brings the archaic mouth to the surface. The posterior lobe is developed in connection with the brain, but the anterior lobe is formed independently'. It originates as an upward growth of the epiblastic invagination which forms the mouth, and is afterwards cut off from the pharynx by the chondrification and subsequent ossification of the skull. The optic commissure is formed by the union and partial decussation of the optic tracts of opposite sides. Each optic tract may be traced backwards from the commissure, around the crus cerebri, to the region of the corpora geniculata (page 752). The lamina cinerea is a thin plate of grey matter which may be seen from the base of the brain by pulling the optic commissure slightly backwards. It is continuous in front with the grey matter of the olfactory convolutions of the frontal lobes, and between the latter it is connected to the rostrum of the corpus callosum by the basal white commissure. Laterally, it is continuous with the anterior perforated space. It forms the anterior sloping part of the floor of the third ventricle. Dissection.—The student should remove the pia mater from the anterior part of the upper surface of the cerebellum, and also any of that membrane which may be still adherent to the quadrigeminal bodies. The anterior part of the cerebellum should now be gently pushed backwards until the quadrigeminal bodies and the lateral parts of the crura cerebri are fully exposed. The valve of Vieussens and the slender pair of fourth nerves which spring from its upper part are very liable to injury at this stage. In conducting this dissection, the student will notice a pair of broad white bands, the superior peduncles of the cerebellum, converging towards the lower pair of quadrigeminal bodies, and a thin white lamina, the valve of Vieussens, filling the interspace between them. The mesen- cephalon is now fully exposed, and its free surface should first be examined. Directions will be subsequently given for the examination of its internal structure. The Mesencephalon The aqueduct of Sylvius is a narrow passage which unites the cavities of the third and fourth ventricles : hence it is sometimes called iter e tertio ad quartum ventriculum. It is roofed by a plate of grey matter, the lamina quadrigemina, which is surmounted by two pairs of elevations, the corpora quadrigemina. Its floor is formed by the tegmenta of the crura cerebri. Its outline in transverseTHE NEBVOUS SYSTEM 750 section varies in different parts of its course. Thus, at its commencement, under the posterior commissure, it has the form of an isosceles triangle with the apex directed downwards. Below the anterior quadrigeminal bodies it is heart-shaped, then somewhat shield-shaped. Lower down, on the level of the posterior corpora quadrigemina, it has the form of an ovate leaf with the stalk directed downwards; and finally, at its junction with the fourth ventricle, it is T-shaped in section (fig. 443). The grey matter of the aqueduct is a thick stratum which surrounds that canal, and is continuous with the grey matter of the floor of the fourth ventricle. It is bounded below by the formatio reticularis, and by the posterior longitudinal bundle (fig. 443). It is continuous above with the grey matter of the lamina quadrigemina. Groups of ceUs are embedded in this grey substance; the most important of these is a long column of nerve- cells which is placed near the middle line beneath the aqueduct close to the formatio reticularis (fig. 424). This is the continuous nucleus of tlie third and fourth nerves. It commences near the junction of the third ventricle and the aqueduct, and extends for nearly the whole length of the latter. It is on a line with the nuclei of two nerves (sixth and twelfth) which arise from the floor of the fourth ventricle. The nucleus of the descending root of the fifth nerve is a group of cells in the region of the upper quadrigeminal751 COBPOBA QUADBIGEMINA bodies, situated above and external to the nucleus of the third nerve; it is limited on its outer side by the white fibres of the nerve-root itself. The formatio reticularis will be described with the anatomy of the medulla and pons. The CORPORA QUADRIGEMINA are four greyish elevations which surmount the lamina quadrigemina. The superior or anterior pair are termed the nates; the inferior or posterior pair, the testes. The corpora quadrigemina are marked off by Fig. 425.—Lateral View of Mesencephalon, Pons, and Medulla. (Gegenbam\) CORPUS GENICULATUM EXTERNUM CRUST A OLIVARY BODY PULVINAR OF OPTIC THALAMUS PINEAL BODY ..^ -^V~ (CORPUS GENICULATUM ^N^:^^ INTERNUM CORPORA QUADRIGEMINA FILLET MIDDLE CEREBELLAR PEDUNCLE INFERIOR CEREBELLAR PEDUNCLE a cruciform groove, the transverse limb of which is the more distinct. The portion of the vertical groove which lies between the nates is also w^ell marked, but the groove between the testes is shallow and is obscured by a rounded bundle of fibres, the frenulum veli, which passes dowai^vards and spreads out on the valve of Vieussens, immediately below the testes. The corpora quadrigemina consist of grey matter overlaid by a thin superficial stratum of white fibres. The nates are broader and darker in colour than the testes, and form a pair of ovoid elevations with their long axes directed upwards and outw^ards ; this direction is continued into the corresponding brachia. The brachia of the nates, or superior brachia, are slightly-raised white bands which pass on each side from the nates in the intervals between the pulvinar of the optic thalami and the corpora geniculata interna. They are sharply marked off from the latter, but less distinctly from the thalami. Each brachium is continued below the corpus geniculatum externum of its omi side directly into the optic tract. The testes are lighter in colour, and form more pronounced elevations than the nates. Each testis is a somewhat pear-shaped body, the narrow end of which is continued into the brachium of its own side. The brachia of the testes, or inferior brachia, are narrower and more prominent than the brachia of the nates, and run parallel to the latter. Each brachium passes below the corpus geniculatum internum of its own side and disappears from the surface. The corpus geniculatum internum is an oval elevation Avhich is placed behind the lateral groove of the mesencephalon under cover of the pulvinar. Its long axis is directed transversely. A band of ^vhite fibres is prolonged from its outer end into the optic tract. This passes as the hindermost layer of fibres in the opticTHE NEBVOUS SYSTEM 752 commissure into the corresponding bundle of the opposite side. It is therefore commissural in nature. It does not contribute any fibres to the optic nerve. The corpus geniculatum externum is a slight elevation at the outer side of the pulvinar. It is directly continuous with the optic tract. The remainder of the mesencephalon is formed by the crura cerebri, each of which is divided into three distinct parts easily recognised in transverse section (fig. 424). These are (1) a greyish upper portion, the tegmen ; (2) a band of almost black substance, the substantia nigra ; and (3) a lower white portion, the crusta, which appears at the base of the brain. The tegmen is also marked off super- ficially from the crusta by two grooves, the oculo-motor and the lateral groove, which may be seen in section to correspond with the inner and outer extremities of the substantia nigra. The oculo-motor groove derives its name from the third or oculo-motor nerve, the filaments of which reach the surface along this furrow. The lateral groove of the mesencephalon is best marked near the upper border of the pons, where it is bounded below by the superficial fibres of the crusta ; and above by a triangular band of fibres, the fillet, which disappears under the testis and its brachium. The crusta, or pes, is a large flattened band of white fibres which is crescentic in section, with the concavity directed backwards and inwards, and in contact with the substantia nigra. Its antero-inferior, inner, and outer surfaces are free. These surfaces are marked with ridges indicating the bundles of fibres of which it is composed. These ridges do not run parallel to the axis of the crus, but take a slightly curved course, passing at first outwards and then upwards. The crusta is continuous below through the pons with the pyramidal body of the same side, and with the cerebellar hemisphere of the opposite side. It is somewhat constricted where it emerges from the pons. It is continuous above with the inner capsule. Dissection.—The student should scrape away the remains of the lenticular nucleus on the left side until the white substance of the inner capsule is exposed. He should then raise the superficial fibres of the under surface of the crus of the same side, and by tearing off these fibres in an upward direction he may readily demonstrate the continuity of the crusta with the inner capsule. The dissector may also follow the fibres of the crusta downwards to the pyramidal bodies by cutting through the superficial transverse fibres of the pons, but it is better to defer this dissection till a later period. The remainder of the mesencephalon with the optic thalami should be carefiiUy preserved until the end of the dissection of the brain, when they should be examined in connection with the medulla and pons by a series of sections. The fibres composing the central third of the crusta are derived from the pyramidal bodies and pass into the anterior half of the posterior limb of the inner capsule to the ascending ft-ontal and ascending parietal convolutions. Its outer third is formed by fibres which are derived from the cerebellar hemispheres of the opposite side, and which pass through the posterior half of the posterior limb of the inner capsule to the temporal and occipital lobes. These fibres are considered to be sensory in function. Lastly, the fibres constituting its inner third pass upwards through the genu and anterior limb of the capsule to the convolutions of the frontal lobe, while below some form communications with the nuclei of the cranial nerves, and others are distributed to the cerebellum in a similar manner to the fibres of the outer third of the crusta. There are other tracts of minor importance in the crusta. The tegmental portions of the crura cerebri, unlike the crusta9, are continuous with one another across the middle line, where they unite in a median raphe. Each tegmen extends into the thalamencephalon below the optic thalamus, where it contains a yellowish-grey lenticular body which is called the subthalamic body. The tegmentum contains both grey and white matter, with a continuation of the formatio reticularis of the medulla and pons. The most conspicuous of the collections of grey matter is the tegmental or red nucleus, a mass of brownish- grey matter which is placed below the optic thalamus, and extends backwards into the mesencephalon below the aqueduct. It appears round in coronal sections (fig. 423).MESENCEPHALON—EPENGEPHALON 753 The best marked of the white strands are the superior peduncles of the cere- bellum, the fillet, and the posterior longitudinal bundle (fig. 444). The filaments of origin of the third nerve, passing from its nucleus through the tegmentum and inner part of the substantia nigra, are also conspicuous in sections (fig. 448). The superior cerebellar peduncle is readily distinguishable in sections through the lowest part of the mesencephalon as a white, crescent-shaped bundle with its inner or concave side bounded by the grey-coloured formatio reticularis which separates it from the grey matter of the aqueduct. Higher up it takes a deeper course below the floor of the aqueduct, and decussates with its fellow of the opposite side. It then passes into the subthalamic region, and separates into an inner and an outer division. The inner division passes internal to the red nucleus and enters the under surface of the optic thalamus. The outer division passes external to the red nucleus and probably enters the globus pallidus of the lenticular nucleus. Fibres have been described as passing from the red nucleus to the cerebral cortex. The fillet appears as a flattened bundle considerably smaller than the cerebellar peduncle, and is placed below and external to the latter. It passes obliquely upwards and outwards, and reaches the surface, appearing as a triangular band of fibres before noticed. It winds round the superior cerebellar peduncles, and dis- appears, for the most part, under the testis of the same side. Part of it is said to ascend in the formatio reticularis and decussate with the fibres of the opposite side, the foremost part of this decussation appearing as the posterior commissure which has been described in connection with the third ventricle. The posterior longitudinal bundle is a flattened bundle of fibres, thinner externally than internally, which is placed between the formatio reticularis and the grey matter of the aqueduct. It probably connects the nuclei of the nerves (third, fourth, and sixth) which supi^ly the muscles of the eye. The Epencephalon Dissection.—The pia mater should be removed from the superior and inferior surfaces of the cerebellum ; care should be taken, however, in removing it from the inferior vermi- form process. In dissecting the latter region, the membranes should be clipped close with scissors rather than pulled out, as by the latter method the choroid plexuses of the fourth ventricle would be removed and the fragile posterior medullary velum would be torn. The student should examine first fhe upper and then the lower surface of the cerebellum, but he should defer the stu.dy of the anterior parts of the inferior vermiform process (pyramid and nodule) imtil the fourth ventricle is opened. The CEREBELLUM consists of two lateral masses, the hemispheres, which are united by a narrower median portion, the vermiform process. This is seen in sagittal section in fig. 427. This median portion is but slightly raised above the level of the hemispheres as seen from above, where it constitutes the superior vermiform process (fig. 427) ; but, as seen from below (inferior vermiform process), it forms the roof of a deep recess between the hemispheres, the vallecula, which is occupied for the most part by the medulla. The vallecula terminates in front at the cavity of the fourth ventricle. Behind, it passes into a deep notch, the incisura marsupialis, which is occupied by the falx cerebelli and the cisterna magna of the subarachnoid space. The surface of the cerebellum is covered by a number of folia, which are curved, with a general direction convex backwards and outwards. The folia are much narrower than the cerebral convolutions, and are of a darker grey colour than the latter. They are separated by fissures, some of which appear on the surface separating individual folia ; others dip in for some distance below the surface, and within these secondary fissures are developed. In this way the great horizontal fissure and the interlobar fissures are formed. The separation into lobes is somewhat arbitrary, as fissures resembling the interlobar fissures in character traverse the substance of the lobes. 30754 THE NEBVOUS SYSTEM The cerebellum is connected to the adjacent parts of the cerebro-spinal axis by- three pairs of peduncles : a superior pair to the cerebrum; a middle pair to the pons ; and an inferior pair to the medulla. I The great horizontal fissure is deeper than the interlobar fissures. It com- i mences at the point where the middle peduncle of the cerebellum enters the hemi- i sphere and pursues a curved course around the margin of the hemisphere, inchning first downwards, and then cur\dng slightly upwards, and crossing the middle line immediately above the incisura marsupialis, to pursue a similar course on the opposite side. On opening up the fissure, numerous folia are seen to run obliquely within it, some of which cross the floor of the fissure so as to connect the upper i and lower surfaces which bound the fissure. The great horizontal fissure separates the superior and inferior surfaces of the cerebellum. The superior surface of the cerebellum has a general inclination backwards i and outwards. This surface is approximately flat, but shows a slight concavity I corresponding to the superjacent occipital lobe of the cerebrum. Mesially the slope j of the surface becomes more abrupt, and forms the superior vermiform process. Of the fissures which traverse this surface the most important is the sulcus cerebelli superior, which branches off from the great horizontal fissure at its commencement ' and curves over the posterior part of the upper surface to approach the great horizontal fissure again at the superior vermiform process, where the two fissures are separated only by a narrow band, the folium cacuminis (fig. 427). The sulcus cerebelli superior divides the superior surface into a larger anterior part, the quadrate lobe, and a smaller semilunar posterior portion, the posterior superior lobe. Another fissure divides the quadrate lobe into an anterior crescentic and a posterior crescentic portion. The anterior crescentic portion is usually subdivided into two portions by another sulcus parallel to the fissure last mentioned. The superior vermiform process is divided by fissures, continuous with the sulci above described, into parts which are placed in the following order from before ■ backwards : lobulus centralis, monticulus cerebelli, and folium cacuminis. The lobulus centralis is a small squarish mass which is placed below and behind the testes, separated from the latter by a fold of pia mater. It rests below on the lingula, which separates it from the valve of Vieussens (fig. 426). It expands laterally into a pair of somewhat triangular folds, the alse (fig. 426), which are I entirely overlapped and hidden by the quadrate lobes when the cerebellum is viewed from above in its undisturbed position. The lingula is a small tongue-shaped portion of the cerebellum which lies on, and is adherent to, the valve of Vieussens. Its basal part is continuous with the lobulus centralis, and it consists of from four to five transverse folia. The monticulus cerebelli is divided into an anterior elevated portion, the culmen, and a posterior sloping part, the declive. The culmen connects the anterior crescentic portions of the quadrate lobes of opposite sides, and is traversed by the fissures which intersect these portions. The declive connects the posterior crescentic portions, and consists of about six or seven transverse folia. The folium cacuminis is a narrow band which connects the posterior superior lobes of opposite sides. It is not a simple folium, but is marked on its superior and inferior surfaces by transverse furrows. The inferior surface of the cerebellum shows a pronounced convexity corre- sponding to the inferior fossae of the occipital bone on which it rests. It is smoothly rounded off externally and behind, but changes its direction abruptly internally and in front, where it comes in contact with the medulla and pons. It is marked off into lobes, which are arranged in the following order from behind forwards : pos- terior inferior, slender, biventral, tonsillar, and flocculus. The posterior inferior is a narrow crescentic lobe, which bounds the great horizontal fissure inferiorly. The slender (lobulus gracilis) is similar in shape, but narrower, as its name implies. The biventral, shorter and thicker than the two last described, is divided by a755 EPENGEPHALON well-marked fissure into an anterior and a posterior portion. The tonsillar lobe (amygdala) lies internal and slightly anterior to the biventral, and is partly hidden in the vallecula. The flocculus is a small lobe forming a marked projection in front of the biventral lobe, which it separates from the middle peduncle of the cerebellum. The inferior vermiform process is formed by the following parts, taken in order from behind forwards: tuber valvulae, pyramid, uvula, and nodule. The tuber valvulse is a transverse band, consisting of about seven or eight folia, which connects the posterior inferior and slender lobes with their fellows of the opposite side. The pyramid is the most massive portion of the inferior vermiform process, and is connected to the biventral lobes on each side. It consists of from five to eight folia. The uvula is an elongated portion, compressed laterally, and connected to the amygdala on each side by the furrowed band. The nodule, or laminated tubercle, is the prominent anterior extremity of the inferior vermiform process Fig. 426.—Inferior Surface of the Cerebellum.

It is connected to the flocculus on each side by a thin white plate, the inferior medullary velum. The latter will be referred to in connection with the anatomy of the fourth ventricle. Dissection.—The student should now obtain a view of the principal systems of fibres in the cerebellum by the following dissection, which we shall speak of as Reil's method. The great horizontal fissure should be opened up and the portion of the cerebellum which lies superior to that fissure gently torn off the underlying portion. If this proceeding has been successfiilly accomplished, a large bundle of fibres will be seen passing through a gap between the superior and middle peduncles of the cerebellum, and passing towards the superior surface. This bundle is formed b}^ the restiform body and by the lower fibres of the pons. The position of the corpus dentatum will also be noticeable near the middle line, as the white fibres which form the capsule of that body are disposed in ridges corre- sponding to the plications of grey matter of the nucleus. A more superficial dissection on the opposite side will show the fibres of the above-mentioned bundle passing inwards, forming at first curves convex backwards, and then sweeping upwards into the folia of the superior vermis. A horizontal section through the corpus dentatum on the right side will expose the plicated bag of grey matter which constitutes the nucleus, an opening into which, the hihun, will be seen on the inner and upper side. If a small portion of the fibres of the superior peduncle of the cerebellum of the same side be now raised and torn gently in a downward direction, the fibres are readily traceable into the white centre of the nucleus. 3c2THE NERVOUS SYSTEM 756 A horizontal section through the superior vermis will show the smaller nuclei of the cerebellum (nuclei fastigii, emboliformis, and giobosus). These are, however, somewhat difficult to find. Lastly, a median sagittal section will expose the fourth ventricle, to obtain a good view of which the remainders of the cerebellar hemispheres should be drawn gently aside. In doing this care should be taken of the inferior medullary velum. White matter of the cerebellum.—The course of the nerve-fibres in the cerebel- lum will be dealt with further on page 783, but the appearance presented by the white matter as seen in sections will now be described. In a mesial sagittal section of the cerebellum (fig. 427) the amount of ^vhite matter is smaller in proportion to I the grey matter than in any other section. It presents a characteristically branched ! appearance w^hich is called the arbor vitse. Two main divisions, the vertical and I horizontal branches, of the arbor vitse are described, and from these secondary i ramifications arise. The vertical branch is mainly continued into the culmen, | where it subdivides somewhat freely. It sends forwards usually two branches into i the lobulus centralis, and a slender twig into the lingula. The main axis of the i horizontal branch is prolonged into a slender white band, which enters the folium cacuminis. From the upper surface of the horizontal branch a stout offset is sent ' into the declive, and from its lower surface branches are sent into the tuber valvulae, j pyramid, and uvula. A small offset enters the nodule, and if this be traced in a lateral direction it will be found to be continued into the inferior medullary velum. In coronal sections the disposition of the white matter in the hemispheres is well seen. It forms a somewhat ovoid mass in each hemisphere, near the centre of which the corpus dentatum is placed (fig. 416). The appearance is very similar in ! sagittal sections through the centre of a hemisphere. It is not necessary to give a separate description of the divisions of the white matter, as these correspond to the i lobulation of the surface. I The grey matter in the interior of the cerebellum consists of four pairs of nuclei, which are everywhere separated by white matter from the grey matter of j the folia. The largest of these nuclei in each hemisphere is called the corpus ! dentatum. The smaller, which are placed nearer the middle line, are called the : nucleus emboliformis, nucleus giobosus, and nucleus fastigii. The corpus dentatum is a crumpled sheet of grey matter which presents a similar i outline in coronal, sagittal, and horizontal sections. This outline is approximately i an oval bounded by a wavy line. This line is broken only on the inner and anterior side, where the white matter of the exterior is continuous with that of the interior ' through an aperture called the hilum. The nucleus emboliformis is an elongated streak of grey matter, which is placed on the inner side of the corpus dentatum. It is somewhat enlarged at its ■ anterior extremity, hence it may be described as club-shaped. The nucleus glo- ' bosus consists of several spheroidal clumps of grey matter, which are placed on the < inner side of the preceding; these clumps are connected with one another, and also with the nucleus emboliformis and nucleus fastigii. The nucleus fastigii varies ! somewhat in its minute structure from the three nuclei above described. It is ' situated immediately over the roof of the fourth ventricle, separated from that ; cavity, however, by a thin stratum of white matter. The nuclei of opposite sides i nearly touch one another in the middle line. The FOURTH VENTRICLE is a cavity Avhich is widest and most lofty about its i centre, and narrowed at its anterior and posterior extremities. It communicates \ with the third ventricle in front through the aqueduct of Sylvius, and passes ' behind into the central canal of the spinal cord. Its long axis is directed upwards ; and forwards. The structures which bound it behind and above are said to j constitute its roof, while the parts bounding it below and in front are described as I its floor. The roof is formed from before backwards by the following structures : the superior peduncles of the cerebellum with the valve of Vieussens between them,757 FOUBTH VENTBICLE the inferior medullary vela, and the epithelial lining of the choroid plexuses and tela choroidea inferior. Some small plates of white matter, the obex and the ligulse, also enter into the formation of the roof. The posterior part of the floor is formed by the medulla and rather more than the anterior half of the upper surface of the pons. Some white lines (stride acustic*), which cross the floor transversely, approximately separate the pontine from the medullary portion of the floor. The valve of Vieussens, or superior medullary velum, is a thin plate of white matter which fills in the angular interval between the superior peduncles of the cerebellum. It is continuous behind with the white matter of the superior vermiform process of the cerebellum. The lingula rests on the posterior part of its upper surface. The fibres of the fourth nerve decussate within its substance at its upper part. The inferior medullary vela are thin crescentic translucent bands of white Fig. 427.—Eight Half of the Encephalic Peduncle as seen from the Inside OF A Median Section.

Each velum presents a concave edge, which is apparently free, but which is in reality continued into the epithelium, which covers the choroid plexuses. It is attached to the cerebellum by its convex edge. The choroid plexuses of the fourth ventricle are convoluted vascular folds of the pia mater, which project into the cavity of the fourth ventricle, but are excluded from the ventricular cavity by a layer of epithelium. They run at first forwards close together on each side of the middle line, and then turn outwards along the edges of the inferior medullary vela to reach the lateral recesses of the ventricle, where they become continuous with the general pia mater. The tela choroidea inferior is a layer of pia mater which closes in the lower and back part of the fourth ventricle. It extends from the choroid plexuses to the HgulaB and obex, where it is continued into the pia mater which covers the posterior758 THE NEBVOUS SYSTEM \ \ surface of the lower part of the medulla. As already mentioned in the descrip- tion of the meninges, it presents three openings or deficiencies : one (foramen of Majendie) in the middle line immediately above the obex, and two (foramina of Key and Retzius) at the lateral recesses. The obex is a thin, somewhat triangular plate of white matter, occupying the angular interval between the two diverging clavje. It is not infrequently absent. ' The ligulse are thin narrow strips of white matter, which project from the inner margins of the clavse. They run at first upwards and forwards, and then turn outwards around the restiform bodies. They may sometimes be traced as far as the flocculi, when they become continuous with the inferior medullary vela. Their inner, apparently free, edges are continuous with the epithelial roof of the fourth ventricle. The floor of the fourth ventricle is a depressed area, which is rhomboidal in I outline, the longer diameter of the rhomboid being directed upwards and forwards and marked by a very distinct fissure, the sulcus longitudinalis medianus, which is continuous below with the central canal of the spinal cord. The ventricular floor is bounded laterally by the clavae and corpora restiformia below, and by the superior peduncles of the cerebellum above. Under cover of the obex, where the fourth ventricle is about to join the central canal of the cord, a small ampulla is formed, termed the ventricle of Arantius. The widest part of the floor corresponds to the lateral recesses of the ventricle. Close behind the lateral recesses, the floor is crossed by some white lines, the strise meduUares or striae acusticae, which emerge from the sulcus longitudinalis medianus, and pass outwards to the auditory nerve. The stride divide the floor into two approximately equal parts, a posterior and an anterior. The posterior moiety of the floor is indented by an angular groove, the fovea inferior or posterior, which marks off a depressed triangular area of a grey colour, the ala cinerea. The latter corresponds in position to the subjacent nuclei of the vagus and glosso-pharyngeal nerves, and is therefore also termed the trigonum vagi. The apex of the posterior fovea is directed forwards. It nearly touches the striae acusticae, and thus two other triangular spaces, both of a whitish colour, are marked off in the posterior moiety of the floor. The internal of these spaces is called the trigonum hypoglossi, since it corresponds in position to the nucleus of the hypoglossal nerve. It is bounded by the posterior fovea, the striae acusticae, and the sulcus longitudinalis medianus. The outer triangle is bounded by the posterior fovea, by the stride acusticae, and by the clavae. It forms the posterior part of a prominence or swelling which extends into the pontine portion of the floor. This prominence is called the tuberculum acusticum. It is well marked in the brain of the infant. The anterior moiety of the floor is completely covered by a thin layer of white substance. It presents, on each side of the sulcus longitudinalis medianus, a semi- cylindrical elevation about five millimetres in length, which is called the eminentia teres. It is caused by an underlying bundle of fibres, the fasciculus teres, which is now known to be a part of the intrapontine course of the fibres of the facial nerve, though possibly it may contain fibres from other sources. External to the eminentia teres is a depressed area, the fovea superior, which is occasionally crossed by a whitish band of fibres, the conductor sonorus. The conductor sonorus meets the stria medullaris of its own side, at the sulcus longitudinalis medianus, at an acute angle. Immediately in front of the fovea superior is a bluish spot, the locus cseruleus, which is caused by the substantia ferruginea showing through the white covering of the floor. The substantia ferruginea is an aggregation of darkly-pigmented cells, which is very conspicuous in transverse sections through the upper part of the floor of the fourth ventricle and through the lower part of the aqueduct of Sylvius. The PONS VAROLII is that portion of the epencephalon which lies in front of the proximal part of the fourth ventricle. As seen from the base of the brain, it forms759 PONS VABOLII a considerable prominence, which narrows on each side as it passes into the middle cerebral peduncles. At its lower border the pyramidal bodies are seen dis- appearing into its substance, while at its upper border the crura cerebri are seen emerging. It rests on the body of the sphenoid bone, reaching upwards as far as the margin of the dorsum sellae. It presents a ventral and a dorsal surface, and a superior and an inferior border. Lateral surfaces have also been described, but these are determined artificially by dividing the pons proper from the middle cerebellar peduncles. The boundary between the pons and the middle cerebellar Fig. 428.—Metencephalon, Mesencephalon, and Thalamencephalon, from THE Dorsal Surface. (After Obersteiner.)

(Henle.) The dorsal surface has been described in connection with the floor of the fourth ventricle. The ventral surface is broad and prominent, strongly convex from side to side, and slightly convex from before backwards. It presents a transverse striation, corresponding to the bundles of commissural fibres passing from hemisphere to hemisphere of the cerebellum. Mesially, it is marked by a sagittal groove or furrow, which usually lodges the basilar artery, but is in no way caused by theTHE NEBVOUS SYSTEM 760 contact with the vessel. On each side of the groove a prominence is formed, where the sagittally-directed fibres of the pyramidal bodies pass brainwards, under cover of the transverse fibres of the pons. The superior border is convex forwards. Its fibres pass directly into the upper border of the middle peduncle of the cerebellum. The inferior border is marked off by a distinct transverse groove from the medulla. It is formed in its inner part by the lowest fibres of the pons, but these are crossed near the junction of pons and middle peduncle by the oblique fasci- culus. The oblique fasciculus is formed by the middle transverse fibres of the pons, which pass downwards and backwards, internal to the exit of the trigeminal nerve, on each side, and cross the inferior fibres on their superficial aspect. j Coronal sections through the pons (fig. 429) show that it comprises two very ! distinct regions—an anterior or ventral region and a dorsal region, which is called | tegmental, as most of its constituents are continued into the tegmentum of the i mesencephalon. The ventral region consists of transverse and longitudinal fibres, | interspersed with small aggregations of grey matter. The transverse fibres are of i three kinds:—(a) Commissural, from hemisphere to hemisphere—these preponderate | on the anterior surface ; (b) decussating fibres, which, after emerging from the j cerebellum by the middle peduncles, cross over to the opposite side and pass i upwards to the cerebrum; (c) fibres which take origin from the grey matter of j the pons, and cross over to the cerebellar hemisphere of the opposite side. These i are probably cerebral fibres which have suffered an interruption in the nerve | cells of the pons. The longitudinal fibres are the upward continuation of the j pyramids. They pass upwards in flattened bundles, separated from one another ' by some of the transverse fibres of the pons. : In the upper or tegmental region the chief things to be observed are: the I tract of the fillet (which lies next to the ventral region), the formatio reticularis, i the posterior longitudinal bundle, the substantia ferruginea, and the funiculus I teres. The superior olivary nucleus, the nuclei of the sixth and seventh cranial j nerves, the motor nucleus of the trigeminal, with parts of the ascending and ; descending roots of the last-named nerve and portions of the nucleus of the ' auditory nerve, are embedded in this region of the pons. j Some of the structures mentioned in the preceding paragraph are visible to the unaided | eye in ordinary dissecting-room specimens. The nuclei of the cranial nerves will not be i further described here, as a full account of them will be given in the section on the cranial : nerves. I I The Metencephalon ! I The MEDULLA OBLONGATA, or bulb, is the portion of the cerebro-spinal axis ' which extends from the inferior border of the pons to the decussation of the pyramids, i It presents an anterior, a posterior, and two lateral surfaces. The anterior surface ! rests upon the basilar groove of the occipital bone, and extends downwards as far \ as the point where the odontoid process is crossed by the transverse ligament of | the atlas (Testut). The bulb has the form of a truncated cone, the base of which I is continued into the pons above, while the truncated apex is prolonged into the i spinal cord below. The posterior surface is received into the vallecula, between the cerebellar hemispheres, and forms, by its upper part, as already described, ' the lower or posterior part of the floor of the fourth ventricle. The ninth to the | twelfth nerves (with the exception of the spinal part of the spinal accessory) take j their superficial origin from its sides. The sixth, seventh, and eighth nerves i appear in the transverse groove between the medulla and the pons in numerical order from within outwards. j The ventricular part of the medulla has been already described; but on the jMETEXCEPHALON 761 extraYentricnlar portion certain fissures, and the elevated portions which these fissures map out, require notice. Fissures.—Commencing in front, we find the anterior fissure (fissura longitu- dinalis anterior) occupying the middle line. It is shallow below, where it is almost separated from the anterior longitudinal fissure of the cord by the decussation of the pyramids; deeper above, where it separates the pyramids of opposite sides. Above, it ends in a blind recess, under the margin of the pons, the foramen caecum k\ posterius, or foramen caecum of Vicq d'Azyr. External to the anterior fissure, we f ■■ find the sulcus lateralis ventralis; the latter intervenes between the pyramid and \ '' the olive above, and extends downwards immediately in front of the olive and the I lateral column. It is joined below the ohve by the postolivary sulcus. From its upper part, a fissure (sulcus parapyramidalis) passes downwards and inwards to join the anterior fissure. On the posterior surface of the medulla we find the posterior fissure (fissura longitudinalis posterior) occup^'ing the middle hne. It is continuous below Avith the posterior fissure of the spinal cord, and ends above at the fourth ventricle. External to this we find the sulcus paramedianus dorsalis, and more externally the sulcus lateralis dorsalis. The former of these two fissures ends above at the apex of the clava, the latter extends for some distance further upwards. To recapitulate, the fissures of the medulla, taken in order from before backwards, are as follow : fissura longitudinahs anterior, sulcus parapyramidalis, sulcus lateralis ventralis, sulcus postolivaris, sulcus lateralis dorsalis, sulcus paramedianus dorsalis, fissura longitudinalis posterior. As will be seen from the previous description, however, I this summary applies only to the upper or proximal part of the medulla ; in the I distal part the fissures become reduced in number owing to some of them becoming confluent with others. Certain of the above-mentioned fissures divide the medulla into columns or areas corresponding, for the most part, to the columns of the cord. I Thus we have an anterior area between the anterior fissure and the sulcus lateralis ! ventralis, a lateral area between the last-named fissure and the sulcus lateralis dorsalis, and a posterior area between the sulcus lateralis dorsalis and the posterior fissure. The anterior area of the medulla is occupied, for the greater part of its extent, by the pyramidal bodies. These are a pair of prominences somewhat pyriform in outline, which lie on each side of the anterior median fissure. Their larger ends are directed upwards and abut against the pons where they become slightly constricted. Laterally, they are marked oft" by the sulci parapyramidales. Their apices are directed downwards and correspond to the decussation of the pyramids. The greater number of the fibres pass across at this point and make their way into I the lateral column of the opposite side of the cord (lateral pyramidal tract); a small bundle, however, of the outermost fibres of each pyramid runs downwards in the anterior column of the cord of the same side (anterior pyramidal tract). f The remainder of the anterior column is occupied by the funiculus anterior. I This is a triangular area of white substance which intervenes between the sulcus parapyramidalis and the sulcus laterahs ventralis. Its base is directed downwards, and is continuous with the anterior ground bundle of the anterior column of the cord. Its apex, directed upwards, is wedged in between the olivary and pyramidal I bodies. The progressive diminution of the tract when traced upwards is owing to 1 its fibres receding from the surface, being overlapped by the pyramidal body. I The lateral area of the medulla is narrow below, being formed by the contiiiua- ' tion of a portion only of the lateral column of the cord. Higher up it expands and presents : («) The olivary body and {h) the tubercle of Rolando. The lateral column fl is a band which passes upwards between the sulcus lateralis ventralis and the sulcus ' f lateralis dorsalis. Above, it passes behind the lower part of the olivary body, and here a greyish prominence, the grey tubercle of Rolando, comes to the surface. il762 THE NERVOUS SYSTEM Beyond this the lateral column can be followed as a narrowband behind the ohve as far as the transverse groove at the lower border of the pons. The olivary body is an ovoidal prominence from twelve to sixteen millimetres long, which extends upwards as far as the transverse groove at the lower border of the pons. It is separated from the pyramidal body by the sulcus lateralis ventralis, and marked off externally by the sulcus postolivaris. Its lower end is crossed by the external arciform fibres. The external arciform fibres emerge from the anterior longitudinal fissure and from the sulcus laterahs ventralis, and arch round the pyramidal and olivary bodies to join the restiform body of the same side. The posterior area of the medulla is occupied in its lower part by two slender fasciculi, each of which expands above into a tubercle. The inner of the two is called the funiculus gracilis, the outer the funiculus cuneatus. The funiculus gracilis is separated from its fellow of the opposite side by the posterior fissure. As it approaches the lower extremity of the fourth ventricle, it swells out into a Fig. 4'29. Transverse Section through the Upper Part of the Pons. (Scliwalbe.) LINGULA TRANSVERSE FIBRES OF PONS prominence called the clava. The latter diverges from its fellow of the opposite side, bounding the fourth ventricle. When traced upwards it gradually tapers off into a fine point. To the inner margins of the diverging portions of the clavas we find the obex and ligul^ attached, as already described (page 758). The funiculus cuneatus is placed between the funiculus last described and the lateral area of the medulla. At the level of the clava it swells out into a prominence, the cuneate tubercle. Above this point it disappears from the surface. The upper part of the posterior area is occupied by the restiform body. The latter appears at first sight as if it were the continuation upwards of the funiculus cuneatus and of the lateral tract, and this was formerly described to be the case. It is now known, however, that it is formed by the direct cerebellar tract (page 781), the external arciform fibres, and the deep or internal arciform fibres (page 783). These constituents unite and form a rounded cord which proceeds upwards and then backwards to the cerebellum, forming the inferior peduncle of that body. In its lower part it is embraced by the roots of the auditory nerve. It then passes through a gap or interval between the superior and middle cerebellarMETENGEPHAL ON 763 peduncles, and ends in the superior vermiform process of the cerebellum in the nucleus fastigii. As already mentioned, the superficial origins of the cranial nerves appear on the surface of the medulla. The sixth, seventh, and eighth nerves come to the surface in the transverse groove between the medulla and pons (fig. 441). The twelfth nerve appears by a row of filaments in the groove between the olivary and pyramidal bodies, and in a line with these filaments, opposite the decussation of the pyramids, the upper part of the anterior root of the first cervical nerve comes to the surface. Between the olivary and restiform bodies, the ninth, tenth, and the upper part of the eleventh nerves make their appearance, and behind the latter the upper filaments of the posterior root of the first cervical nerve reach the surface. Dissection.—If the student has followed out the dissection previously recommended, the brain will now be reduced to the medulla, the pons, the mesencephalon, and small portions Fig. 430.—Transverse Section of the Pons near the Centre of the Fourth Ventricle. (Schwalbe.) SEVEST/I NERVE NUCLEUS OF SIXTH of the hemispheres (chiefly thalamencephalon). He should now tear off the transverse fibres of the pons on one side of the middle line, so as to bring into view the flattened bundles which form the continuation of the p,yraniidal body tlu^ongli the pons. By tearing these pyramidal fibres in a sagittal direction, the dissector will be able to follow them through the crusta into the inner capsule. Lastly the dissector should make a series of transverse sections through the remaining portion of brain-substance. An inspection of figs. 423, 424, 429, 430, and 431 will materially aid him in comprehending the somewhat faint indications which he wiU observe in his sections. The following are the j)rincipal points which can be made out by the unaided eye in an ordinary brain, hardened in spirit, and treated in the above-mentioned manner. (In a brain hardened in Miiller's fluid many additional details can be made out.) In the upper- most sections the tegmental or red nucleus is readily recognised by its romided outline; it lies below the optic thalamus, and extends backwards for a considerable distance (fig. 423). If the section pass through the external geniculate body, curved bands of white matter intersecting the grey matter can be seen. Sections through the upper part of the mesen- cephalon show the red nucleus in the tegmentum, the substantia nigra, the crusta, and the aqueduct of Sylvius. Lower down, the decussation of the superior peduncles of the cere- bellum forms a conspicuous white centre in the tegmentmn ; the grey matter surrounding the aqueduct is distinct in colour from the rest of the section, and on the ventral side of this grey matter the posterior longitudinal bundle can be faintly made out. Sections through the inferior corpora quadrigemina show the posterior longitudinal bundle more distinctly ; the superior peduncles of the cerebellum lie on the ventral side of the bundle, touching one another at the raphe, but commencing to rise up around the sides of the aqueduct; ventral to these the tract of the fillet may be seen as a white band; and ventrally764 THE XEBVOUS SYSTEM to the fillet the longitudinal fibres of the pons are well seen intersectini>- the transverse fibres. Sections through the valve of Yieussens (fig. 429) show the superior peduncles of the cerebellum in the form of distinct white crescents placed lateralh" to the fioor of the fourth ventricle.. The posterior longitudinal bundle is now very distinct. It appears pear-shaped in cross-section with the narrow end pointing outwards and abutting against the substantia ferruginea; the latter stands out as a conspicuous dark spot. The tract of the fillet is easily recognised as a white flattened oval bundle. The area mapped out between the posterior longitudinal bundle, the superior peduncles of the cerebellum, and the tract of the fillet, is occupied by the formatio reticularis. In sections distal to this, the posterior longitudinal bimdle and the tract of the fillet rapidly lose their distinctness, and in the medulla little can be made out as a rule except the olivary nucleus. The latter appears as a thin wav}' grey line occup^dng the interior of the olivary body. Fig. 431.—Transverse Section of the Medulla a little above the Lower Extremity of the Fourth Ventricle. (After Krause.) FUNICULUS SOLI TAR J us NUCLEUS OF AUDITORY Internal structure of the medulla.—Transverse sections of the medulla show that it is composed of symmetrical halves separated by a central raphe. The raphe is entirely formed by decussating fibres. Each lateral half is composed of both grey and white matter. The white matter will be dealt with in connnon with the tracts of the spinal cord and with the cranial nerves. The arrangement of the grey matter in the medulla is, for the most part, not visible to the unaided eye, and therefore will be dealt with very briefly here. It is usually classified into two categories : (a) Representatives of the grey crescents of the spinal cord; and {h) nuclei or aggregations of grey matter not represented in the spinal cord. As will be seen on consulting the section on the Spinal Coed, the grey matter of the latter consists of a pair of bilaterally symmetrical grey crescentsMETENGEFHALON 765 which are nnitecl in the middle line by a grey commissure. In the centre of this commissure is the central canal of the cord. This central canal extends upwards into the lower or distal part of the medulla, but, in the upper part of the last- named structure, the posterior columns diverge from one another so that the central canal opens out and expands into the floor of the fourth ventricle. There- fore the ependyma which surrounds the central canal, together with the grey masses at the bases of both anterior and posterior horns, is spread out on the floor of the fourth ventricle. From the nerve-cells in this grey matter some of the cranial nerves, which take their origin in the medulla, arise. The grey matter of the base of the anterior horn suffers but little displacement, and lies in a column on each side of the sulcus longitudinalis medianus, and from this a motor nerve (the twelfth) arises. The sixth nerve arises in series with the twelfth in the tegmental region of the pons, and the nuclei of the fourth and third nerves continue this motor column of cells brainwards. The grey matter of the base of the posterior horn is dis- placed laterally, so that it underlies the surface markings which have been described above as ala cinerea and tuberculum acusticum, and from this grey matter the sensory parts of the tenth and ninth nerves and part of the eighth nerve arise.

At the decussation of the pyramids (fig. 438) large bundles of fibres pass from the lateral columns of the cord to cross over to the opposite side and appear in the anterior column of the medulla, forming the greater part of the pyramids. These bundles of fibres cut through the necks of the anterior horns so as to com- pletely amputate the heads of the horns. A little higher up each head is thrust into a more lateral position by the increased size of the pyramids, and forms the nucleus lateralis and the nucleus ambiguus (fig. 432). The motor nuclei of the por- tion of the eleventh which arises in the medulla, and of the tenth and ninth nerves, are regarded as derivatives from the head of the anterior horn, and the series is continued upwards by the nucleus of the seventh (at the junction of the pons and medulla), and in the pons by the motor nucleus of the trigeminal. A little above the decussation of the pyramids, bundles of fibres, chiefly from the funiculi gracilis and cuneatus, pass forwards and cut through the neck of the posterior horn, and then decussate, forming the sensory or upper pyramidal decussation (decussatio lemnisci). The separated head of the posterior horn (substantia gelatinosa Rolandi) is continued upwards as far as the accessory sensory nucleus of the fifth nerve» This substantia gelatinosa is one of the sensory nuclei of the fifth nerve, and isTHE NERVOUS SYSTEM 766 covered externally by a band of white fibres, concave inwards, the ascending root of the trigeminal nerve (fig. 432). At one point the substantia gelatinosa approaches very near the surface, and forms the grey tubercle of Rolando. Of the nuclei which are apparently without representatives in the grey matter of the spinal cord, the most important is the olivary nucleus ; this is a crumpled bag of grey matter enclosing white matter and occupying the interior of the olivary body. It can easily be seen with the unaided eye in cross-sections of the medulla. It presents a marked resemblance, in miniature, to the corpus dentatum of the cerebellum, and is often called the corpus dentatum of the olivary body. It presents an opening or hilum which opens downwards and inwards. The nucleus of the clava and the nucleus cuneatus are not directly represented in the cord, but their connection with the posterior horns can be seen in sections through the lower part of the medulla ; they have probably the same anatomical value as a column of nerve-cells (Clarke's column) in the dorsal region of the spinal cord (Testut). Other nuclei of smaller size are found in the medulla; the nucleus arciformis and the accessory olives will serve as examples of these (fig. 431). None of these smaller nuclei are visible to the unaided eye. Specific Gravity and Weight of the Brain The average specific gravity of the brain is about 1036. The white matter is somewhat more heavy (sp. gr. 1040) than the grey matter (sp. gr. 1034). Tlie adult male brain weighs on an average 49*5 ounces; the female brain is somewhat lighter, and weighs from 5 to 5*5 ounces less than the male. The cerebrum forms about 87*5 per cent, of the entire brain; the cerebellum about 10*5 per cent.; and the pons and medulla about 2 per cent. Weight of the Spinal Cord In the adult, the spinal cord, when all extraneous structures have been removed, weighs from 1 to 1'5 ounce. CRANIO-CEREBRAL TOPOGRAPHY The great advances which have been made during late years in cerebral surgery render it imperative that the student should become acquainted with, at least, the more important facts concerning the relations which exist between the encephalon and the cranium with its covering of soft parts. The first observers considered that the lobes of the brain corresponded to the bones of the same name ; this is now known not to be the case. It has also been demonstrated that the sutures of the skull are much more variable in their relations to the fissures of the brain than was originally supposed. The principal fissures are found to be fairly constant in their position, while the sutures vary consider- ably in their relation to these fissures. Guide-points.^—-In attempting to map out the outline of the brain and its fissures and convolutions on the surface of the head, advantage is taken of certain prominent points and ridges, which can, under ordinary circumstances, be felt through the skin in the living head. Some of these are very definite, and therefore valuable; while others have been suggested by v-arious authors which are so obscure and variable as to be practically useless. The following is a list of the principal guide-points which have been employed : the glabella, the naso-frontal groove, the orbital arch, the external angular process, the zygoma, the external auditory meatus, the mastoid process, the superior curved line of the occipital bone, the external occipital protuberance, the parietal eminence, and the sutures of the skull. The glabella is an eminence which is situated between the superciliary ridges.767 CBANIO-CEBEBBAL TOPOGBAPHY It has been used as a guide-point by the majority of authors, but it may well be replaced, as Poirier has proposed, by the naso-frontal groove. The glabella is variable, being elevated in some skulls, and rounded off to such a degree in others as to be hardly perceptible. Moreover, it is rather an area than a definite point from which measurements could be taken ; while the naso-frontal groove is easily localised, very constant in its relations to the anterior poles of the cerebral hemi- spheres, and is a very convenient point from which to take measurements. The naso-frontal groove (the centre of which is termed the nasion) can be easily recognised in the living head as a definite depression. It corresponds to the suture between the nasal and frontal bones. The orbital arch is easily recognised. Its inner extremity, the internal angular process, is deeply placed. Its outer extremity, the external angular process, is very prominent. The external angular process can be easily felt, and its anterior and posterior borders made out. The posterior border is a very convenient point from which to take measurements. The zygoma, being subcutaneous for its entire extent, is easily recognised. Its upper border corresponds, broadly speaking, to the infero-external border of the temporal lobe. This border, however, frequently dips below the upper border of the zygoma, as may be seen in the series of casts prepared by Professor Cunningham. The zygoma, from the fact of its being practically horizontal, may be of further use in determining the horizontal plane in the recumbent position of the body. The external auditory meatus possesses the advantage of being visible as well as tangible, and (according to Poirier) of bearing a very constant relation to the contents of the cranial cavity. In determining the position of the fissure of Eolando by Eeid's method, the depression in front of the meatus is selected as a landmark. The mastoid process is easily felt, except in young children. The posterior border of the root of this process is the point from which, in Reid's method, a vertical line is drawn to meet the middle line. The superior nuchal line corresponds to the upper limit of the muscles of the neck, and can be felt, in many persons, pursuing a curved course from the posterior border of the mastoid process to the external occipital protuberance. The external occipital protuberance, or inion, is one of the most useful guide- points. It corresponds to the posterior end of the great longitudinal fissure, and can usually be easily made out as a distinct eminence. In some cases it is slightly developed and, in such cases, its position may be determined by following the superior nuchal line towards the mesial line of the head, or by making tense the ligamentum nuchae, which is attached to the protuberance. The parietal eminence is very prominent in the young child, but in the adult it becomes rounded off, and is too obscurely marked to be of much use as a landmark. The sutures are of very little practical use, as they cannot easily be dis- tinguished until the soft parts have been reflected, and, as above mentioned, the sutures vary considerably in their relations to the fissures of the brain. The lambda can, however, be generally made out as a depression immediately in front of the highest point of the occipital bone. Various methods have been employed in determining the relations of the cerebral con- volutions and fissures to the superficial landmarks of the head. Pegs have been driven through the skull, along the sutures, into the brain, and the relations of these sutures to the brain thus ascertained. Much information has also been obtained from the study of sections of frozen heads. Composite photographs of dissections have also been prepared, showing the convolutions, and even the ventricular cavities, of the brain in relation to the surface of the head, the head appearing transparent (Fraser). Lastly, the brain, having been hardened in situ, has been exposed by removing portions of the skull-wall and casts have been made of the preparations (Cunningham). Figs. 433 and 434 are drawn from two of these casts.THE NERVOUS SYSTEM 768 Relation of the margin of the hemisphere to the cranial wall.—The mesial border of the hemisphere may be mapped out by taking on the sm^faee of the scalp a point about half an inch above the superior nuchal line of the occipital bone, three-quarters of an inch on the right side (a quarter of an inch on the left) from the centre of the external occipital protuberance, and drawing a straight line forwards from this point to the naso-frontal groove. This line gradually approaches the middle line as it is traced forwards in consequence of the narrowing of the superior longitudinal sinus. The orbital margin of the hemisphere commences opposite the floor of the naso- frontal groove, and passes upwards and outwards above the orbital arch, gradually Fig. 433.—Drawing of a Cast of the Head of an Adult Male. (Prepared by Professor Cunningham to illustrate cranio-cerebral topography.) rising until it reaches a point situated from eight to fifteen millimetres above the external angular process ; from this point it passes almost horizontally backwards to the point (Sylvian point) where the fissure of Sylvius reaches the convex surface of the hemisphere. The Sylvian point is placed from twenty-nine to thirty-two millimetres behind the external angular process. From this point the upper margin of the anterior part of the temporal lobe runs downwards and forwards towards the apex of the temporal lobe as far as a point which is situated on an average about fifteen millimetres behind the external angular process, and two millimetres above the zygoma. ■ From this point the infero-external border commences, and passes backwards, with a slight inclination downwards, as far as the temporo-mandibular articulation, and is here on a level with the upper border769 GBANIO-CEBEBBAL TOPOGBAPHY of the zygoma. It runs then backwards and slightly upwards, passing four to ten millimetres above the external auditory meatus, and follows the same direction as far as a perpendicular line drawn upwards from the posterior border of the mastoid process at its root; then, slightly changing its direction, it passes backwards, with an inclination downwards, a little above the superior nuchal line to the external occipital protuberance. In the above description the method of Poirier has been partly followed. It should be noted that the apex of the temporal lobe is directed inwards as well as downwards and forwards, so that it is related to the base rather than to the lateral wall of the skull. In a brain hardened in situ (fig. 410), the apex of the temporal lobe is seen to be sharply pointed, while, about one-half to three-quarters of an inch above and behind the apex, an elevation is seen crossing the three temporal convolutions. This elevation corresponds to the margin of the part of the hemisphere which is in relation to the lateral wall of the skull, I and is apparently the blunt pole {i^ointe mousse) of the temporal lobe referred to by Poirier. In tracing the mesial border of the hemisphere, a quarter of an inch on the left side and three-quarters of an inch on the right side is allowed for the superior longitudinal sinus. This allows an inch for the breadth of the sinus, which would be too large for the superior longitudinal sinus alone; but we must also take into account the commencement of the lateral sinuses, which begin to deviate at this point. The inion is a little below the occipital pole of the cerebral hemispheres. The superior nuchal line generally corresponds, as Birmingham has shown, to the lateral sinus at its posterior or inner part. [In six skulls I ' drilled a series of holes horizontally through the superior nuchal line of the occipital bone on each side. Most of the holes entered the groove for the lateral sinus or pierced the skull below that groove. In three skulls, holes drilled through the nuchal line at a point half an inch external to the inion on the left side passed above the sinus, and would therefore have entered the cerebrum in the recent state. In every instance the nuchal line was situated entirely below the cerebrum on the right side. From the average of the six skulls examined it would appear that the inner third of the superior nuchal line corresponds to the lower border of the lateral sinus or to the margin of the cerebellum ; the middle third of the nuchal line to the lateral sinus near its upper border ; and the outer third of the nuchal line to the cerebellum.—H. St. J. B.] Position of the principal fissures.—The methods in use in this country up I to the present time for determining the relations of the principal fissures to I ■ the surface of the head are chiefly those of Hare and Eeid. The former mainly devoted himself to mapping out the most important fissure, namely, the fissure of Rolando. He found that the upper end of this fissure was on an average 57 per cent, of the surface-distance from the glabella to the external occipital protuberance, that its average length was 3f inches, and that it formed an angle of 1 67° with the mesial line of the head. This angle has recently been shown to more nearly average 71'5° (Cunningham). Eeid refers most of his markings to perpendiculars erected on a line drawn from the lowest part of the infraorbital margin backwards through the middle of the external auditory meatus. He calls I this line the ' base line.' The rules which follow in this article for determining the positions of the various fissures are based mainly on the observations of Hare, Poirier, and Cunningham. I Fissure of Rolando.—If the distance from the floor of the naso-frontal groove 1 to the external occipital protuberance be measured, and a point be taken two centimetres behind the central point of this line, it will indicate the upper end of the fissure of Rolando. From this point a line should be drawn downwards and forwards for a distance of 8*6 centimetres (3| inches), forming an angle of 71*5° with the mesial line. In cases where the external occipital protuberance cannot be satisfactorily made out, the upper end of the fissure of Rolando may be found by measuring a distance of eighteen centimetres in large heads (or seventeen centimetres in small heads) from the naso-frontal groove. (Poirier.) ; [In this method of determining the position of the fissure of Rolando, I have employed j Poirier's method for determining the upper extremity of the fissure, the Eolandic angle as I determined by Cunningham, and the length of the fissure as given by Hare. I recently I, measured eight of Professor Cunningham's casts, both by the above method and by Hare's. 3D770 THE NEBVOUS SYSTEM \ j The fissure coincided with the measurement, by both methods, in four cases. In three out of the remaining four cases an inch trephine would have exposed the fissure in both series of measurements, while in one case the fissure would have formed a tangent to the trephine circle by the above method, and would have missed the fissure by about two millimetres by Hare's method. I attribute this failure to the difficulty of determining the glabella with precision.—H. St. J. B.] Naso-lambdoidal line.—Poirier has introduced a line which he terms the naso- lambdoidal line. This line is drawn from the naso-frontal groove to a point one centimetre above the lambda. It touches the lower pointed extremity of the pars triangularis of the inferior frontal convolution, runs for a distance of from four to six centimetres along the posterior limb of the fissure of Sylvius, grazes | the inferior part of the supramarginal convolution, passes through the base of | the angular gyrus, and abuts on the external parieto-occipital fissure. About | the middle of its course, the naso-lambdoidal line passes through a point situated | six millimetres above the external auditory meatus. In cases where the lambda | Fig. 434.—Drawing of a Cast of the Head of a Newly-born Male Infant. !

(Poirier.) ' Fissure of Sylvius.—The following directions are given by Eeid for finding ' this sulcus :—' Draw a line from a point one inch and a quarter behind the external j angular process of the frontal bone to a point three-quarters of an inch below the most prominent part of the parietal eminence. Measuring from before backwards, ' the first three-quarters of an inch of the line will represent the main fissure, and i the rest of the line will indicate the horizontal limb. The ascending limb will start from the posterior end of the line indicating the main fissure—that is, two i inches behind, and slightly above, the external angular process—and run vertically j upwards for about an inch.' In making these measurements, the chief difficulty \ is the vague contour of the parietal eminence; it will therefore be advisable i to check the result obtained by drawing the naso-lambdoidal line. | j771 THE SPINAL COED External parieto-occipital fissure.—This fissure is situated, according to Hare, on an average, five-eigliths of an inch in front of the lambda, or one inch and seven-eighths behind the upper end of the fissure of Eolando. It may also be found at the posterior end of the naso-lambdoidal line. [In Professor Cunningham's series of casts, the relation of the lambda to the external parieto-occipital fissm-e is seen to vary considerably. The fissure is generally in front of the lambda, but is in one case under cover of that landmark. I recently measured the distance of the parieto-occipital fissure from the upper end of the fissure of Eolando in five of these casts, and found it slightly in excess of the measurement given above—viz. 2'3 inches—the limit of variability being half an inch.—H. St. ,T. B.] Angular gyrus.—This convolution is situated on the naso-lambdoidal line, seven centimetres from the lambda. (Poirier.) Supramarginal convolution.—This is placed immediately above the naso- lambdoidal line at a distance of ten centimetres from the lambda. (Poirier.) THE SPINAL CORD The spinal cord is the elongated portion of the cerebro-spinal axis which is contained within the spinal canal. It extends from the level of the transverse Fig. 435.—Transverse Section of the Spinal Cord and its Membranes. (After Key and Eetzius.) Dura mater — ligament of the atlas to the body of the second lumbar vertebra. Occasionally it only extends as far as the body of the first lumbar vertebra. It is invested, in common with the brain, by three membranes : dura mater, arachnoid, and pia mater. The portions of these membranes which are contained within the cranial cavity, and I are therefore in relation to the brain, have been already described (page 710). There I are, however, certain differences between the cranial and the spinal meninges ; there- I fore, a short separate description of the latter will be necessary. ij Dissection.—The subject being placed on its face, the neural canal ma^^ be laid open in , the usual manner by cutting through the pedicles of the vertebras and removing the neural arches of the sacrum. The cord and its membranes should be first examined in situ. \ About three inches of the theca should be ripped up at the junction of the dorsal and I hmibar regions for this purpose. The entire cord with the membranes should then be removed by dividing both cord and membranes at the level of the articulation between I the atlas and axis and cutting through the nerves as they enter the intervertebral foramina. Two or three of the lower lumbar or upper sacral nerves should be cut sufticiently long to preserve the ganglia on the posterior roots. The cord should now be pinned out with 3 D 2772 THE NEBVOUS SYSTEM its posterior surface uppermost in a cork-lined tray and dissected under water. On lajdng open the dura mater by a mesial longitudinal incision, the arachnoid will come into view and will be rendered more evident by blowing air between it and the pia mater with a blowpipe. On slitting up the arachnoid some of the coarser strands of the subarachnoid tissue may be made out. The posterior and anterior nerve-roots will also be seen with the ligamentum denticulatum between them. The connection of the latter with the pia mater is well seen under water. The pia mater appears white and glistening, and when traced downwards is very obviously continuous with the lilum terminale. The last-named structure stands out conspicuously among the duller-coloured nerve-roots which constitute the Cauda equina. On the anterior aspect of the cord the linea splendens will be seen. Lastly the student should make a series of transverse sections through the cord and compare the disposition of the grey and white matter in the different regions (fig. 439). The DURA MATER forms a loose sheath or theca around the cord. It invests not only the cord but also the elongated nerve-roots, which (under the name of cauda equina) extend beyond the cord. It invests the cauda equina as far as the second or third sacral vertebra, but at this level it converges so as to form a blunt hollow cone, and is represented lower down only by the sheath of the filum terminale. By means of this sheath it is attached to the base of the coccyx. Its outer surface is Fig. 48G.—View of the Membranes of the Spinal Cord. (Ellis.) rough and is loosely connected by fatty tissue to the ligaments and periosteum which line the neural canal. Some stronger retinacula connect it to the posterior common ligament. Its inner surface, smooth and shining, is separated from the arachnoid by a narrow subdural space. It is connected to the cord by a special development of the pia mater—the ligamentum denticulatum. It is continuous through the foramen magnum with the supporting layer of the dura mater of the brain. It sends tubular prolongations around the spinal nerves. These prolonga- tions gradually merge into the connective tissue sheaths (epineurium) of the nerves. Each tube is divided by a septum into two compartments, one for the anterior, and one for the posterior root of the spinal nerve. The differences between the dura mater of the brain and cord may be summarised as follows :—The dura mater of the cord does not send processes or infoldings into the fissures of the cord. It represents only the supporting layer of the dura mater of the brain. The periosteal layer is represented by the periosteumMENINGES OF THE SPINAL COBD of the neural canal, but is separated from the supporting layer by fatty tissue, and by some venous plexuses. Hence this periosteum is only brought into relation with the dura mater proper by the fact, already noticed (page 712), that the dura mater of the cranium is directly continuous by the'^medium of the posterior occipito- axial ligament with the periosteum of the neural canal. The AEACHNOID is separated from the dura mater by a narrow subdural space, and is connected to the dura mater only opposite the attachments of the ligamentum 1 Fig. 487.—Posterior View of the Medulla Oblongata and of the Spinal Cord, WITH its Coverings and the Koots of the Nerves. (Hirschfeld and Leveille.) A B denticulatum, to be presently described. It is a thin membrane resembling the cerebral arachnoid, with which it is continuous. It sends tubular investments along the nerve-roots. These investments eventually become continuous with the perineural sheaths of the nerves. It extends downwards within the theca as far as the second or third sacral vertebra, forming a common investment to the bundle of nerve-roots constituting the cauda equina.774 THE NEBVOUS SYSTEM The subarachnoid tissue is much less abundant in tlie spinal portion than in the cerebral part of the subarachnoid space. It passes from arachnoid to pia mater in the form of delicate threads, which are separated from one another by comparatively wide intervals. It also gives support to the nerve-roots as they cross the subarachnoid space (fig. 435). An incomplete membranous septum, the septum posticum (Key and Retzius), passes from arachnoid to pia mater opposite the posterior fissure of the spinal cord, and serves to conduct blood-vessels to the cord. The space is also partially divided into a posterior and an anterior compartment by the ligamentum denticulatum. The PIA MATER of the cord consists of two layers, an outer and an inner, the latter of which represents, and is continuous with, the pia mater of the brain, i Both layers dip into the anterior fissure of the cord, but only the inner layer enters the posterior fissure. The outer layer is strong and fibrous, and presents certain localised thickenings which require separate description ; these are the ligamentum denticulatum and the linea splendens. The filum terminale may be conveniently described along with these. \ The ligamentum denticulatum is a fibrous band which is attached on each side j of the cord about midway between the anterior and posterior nerve-roots. It is ■ continuous by its inner margin with the pia mater. Its outer margin is character- istically scalloped or denticulated, and presents about twenty-one pointed processes by which it is attached to the dura mater. These processes do not pierce the ' arachnoid, but receive funnel-shaped sheaths from it (Key and Retzius). The highest of these processes is at the level of the foramen magnum, and is placed j between the hypoglossal nerve and the vertebral artery. In the upper region of | the cord one denticulation is regularly placed between the point of exit of each j nerve and the next nerve below ; lower down the arrangement becomes less regular. I It is continuous below with the filum terminale. The linea splendens (Haller) is j a conspicuous linear thickening which is placed in the middle line in front of the ij cord. It presents a silvery white appearance. It is continuous below with the j filum terminale. The filum terminale is the continuation of the pia-matral sheath i of the cord, and contains but little nervous matter in its interior. It is easily i distinguished by its shining white appearance from the nerve-roots among which it lies. It is a slender strand which extends from the pointed lower extremity of the spinal cord to the lower end of the sacrum, or first piece of the coccyx, opposite i which it is attached to the bone. As already mentioned, it receives a sheath from the dura mater in the lower part of its course. EXTERNAL CHARACTERS OF THE SPINAL CORD i The spinal cord is about eighteen inches in length, and forms (by weight) about two per cent, of the cerebro-spinal axis. It is cylindrical in form, and is slightly | compressed from before backwards, so that the transverse exceeds the antero- | posterior diameter. It is continuous with the medulla oblongata above at the ; decussation of the pyramids ; below it tapers off into a cone, the conus medullaris, j the apex of which is continued downwards by the filum terminale. It follows the curvatures of the canal in which it is placed, and therefore describes two curves, the upper or cervical convex forwards, and the lower or dorsal concave forwards. . I In two regions of the cord distinct enlargements are visible : these are called the cervical and the lumbar enlargements. The large size of the nerves which are I given off to supply the limbs, forming the brachial and lumbo-sacral plexuses, j obviously account for these enlargements of the cord. The increase in size is | almost entirely produced by an increase in the transverse diameter. The cervical | enlargement is more pronounced than the lumbar swelling. It commences at the j level of the third cervical vertebra, and ends at the second dorsal. It is at its maximum775 THE SPINAL COED Fig. 438.—Anterior and Posterior View of the Spinal Cord. (Modified from Quain.) X represents the filum terminale.

The lumbar enlargement commences at the level of the ninth dorsal vertebra, and reaches its maximum at the twelfth dorsal; below this point it rapidly diminishes and passes into the conns meduUaris. The spinal cord is bilaterally symmetrical, the two halves being marked off from one another by the anterior and posterior longitudinal fissures. From the antero- lateral and posterolateral aspects of the cord the anterior and posterior nerve-roots emerge, forming two parallel series of fasciculi which extend for the entire length of the cord. In the upper cervical region the intrathecal course of the nerve-roots is very short, and the direction taken by the roots is nearly transverse. As the roots are traced downwards in the dorsal and lumbar regions, they become pro- gressively longer, and descend with an increasing degree of obliquity. Hence the lumbar and sacral nerve-roots have a very long intrathecal course. They extend beyond the termination of the cord (which, it will be remembered, ends at the body of the second lumbar vertebra), and lie within the theca in a sheaf somewhat resembling a horse's tail, and therefore called the cauda equina. Fissures.—The anterior longitudinal fissure (fissura longitudinalis anterior)^ is a true fissure and is comparatively wide. It attains a depth equal to one-third of the antero-posterior diameter of the cord. As above mentioned, both layers of the pia mater dip into it. It occupies the entire length of the cord. It is continuous above with the anterior fissure of the medulla, being, however, almost obliterated at the decussation of the pyramids. The posterior longitudinal fissure (sulcus longitudinalis posterior) is much narrower than the anterior, and is, in fact, a septum rather than a fissure, being formed by the inner layer of the pia mater, which dips in and reaches as far forwards as the grey commissure. Its depth is one-half of the antero-posterior diameter of the cord. It is continuous with the posterior fissure of the medulla. Antero-lateral and postero-lateral fissures or grooves corresponding to the line of origin of the anterior and posterior nerve-roots are described, and by means of these fissures the cord is mapped out into three columns : an anterior between the anterior longitudinal fissure and the antero- lateral groove ; a lateral between the last-named groove and the posterolateral groove, and a posterior between the postero-lateral groove and the posterior median fissure. The postero-lateral groove is well marked ; at its floor the grey matter of the cord comes to the surface, and from it the fibres of the posterior roots emerge in a single row. It is deepest in the cervical region, and is continuous with the sulcus lateralis dorsalis of the medulla. The antero-lateral groove has no real existence, as the anterior roots leave the cord in three to eight thin bundles, and thus cover a longitudinal strip of the cord about one millimetre in breadth. In correspondence with this, we find that the division into anterior and lateral columns is also artificial, and it is now generally recognised that it is better to enumerate only two columns in the spinal cord, viz. an antero-lateral and a posterior. In the cervical region of the cord an additional groove (sulcus para- medianus dorsalis) is visible ; this becomes indistinct when traced downwards, but is very obviously continued into the medulla. The surface of the cord is clothed with white matter, the grey matter being contained in the interior. In two situations, however, the grey matter comes to the surface, viz. in the floor of the postero-lateral groove and at the bottom of the posterior longitudinal fissure. In the latter situation the posterior grey commissure crosses from side to side. INTEENAL STRUCTUEE OF THE SPINAL COED In transverse section each lateral half of the cord is seen to be composed of both grey and white matter, the latter being disposed on the surface. The grey matter is in the form of a crescent, which has been not inaptly compared (by Testut)THE SPINAL COBD 111 to a large comma (,). The head of the comma looks forwards and constitutes the anterior horn of grey matter; the tail forms the posterior horn, and the convexity looks inwards and is united to the grey crescent of the o^^posite side by the grey commissure. The two crescents, "with the commissure, form a figure resembling a capital H. Within the grey commissure is the central canal of the cord, and in front of the grey commissure, occupying the floor of the anterior longitudinal Fig. 439.—Sections through Different Eegions of the Spin.ax Cord.

The term commissure is somewhat misleading, as the majority of the nerve-fibres which pass from side to side are not commissural but decussating fibres. The grey matter of the cord consists of two varieties : (a) Substantia gelatinosa, and (h) substantia spongiosa. The former {a) covers the head of the posterior born like a cap (substantia gelatinosa Rolandi), and is also found around the778 THE NEBVOUS SYSTEM i central canal (substantia gelatinosa centralis). The latter is continued into the i ependyma of the cerebral ventricles, (b) The substantia spongiosa is much more j extensive than the substantia gelatinosa, and contains large nerve-cells. These | cells are arranged in definite groups. In the anterior horn there are large cells | which are connected with the anterior roots, and are called motor-cells. In the lower lumbar region these motor-cells are disposed in four groups : a central (occupying nearly the centre of the anterior horn), a mesial, a latero-ventral, and a latero-dorsal. The latero-dorsal group represents the lateral horn (tractus | intermedio-lateralis). The lateral horn is represented throughout the cord, but is i best seen in the upper dorsal region where it projects like a beak. It is to be i distinctly understood that these groups of cells are the expression in cross-section \ of long columns of cells which are placed longitudinally in the grey matter. In I the dorsal region of the cord a very remarkable column of cells (Clarke's column) i is found. It occupies the inner side of the base of the posterior horn. It com- mences opposite the origin of the seventh or eighth cervical nerve, and disappears at the level of the second or third lumbar. It is at its maximum opposite the eleventh or twelfth dorsal nerve. It is encircled and as it were mapped out' by fibres belonging to the posterior roots. In the cervical region, immediately behind \ the lateral horn, trabeculge of grey matter extend outwards for a short distance, and enclose strands of white fibres in their meshes. This network is called the i processus reticularis. The central canal of the cord is lined by ciliated epithelium ; it is continued i into the filum terminate for about half the length of the latter, and is here some- I what dilated ; a few nerve-fibres accompany the canal into the filum terminale, and I are supposed to be rudimentary coccygeal nerves. The canal is dilated in the ; conus medullaris, forming an irregular cavity, the sinus rhomboidalis inferior, or j ventriculus terminalis. | In transverse sections through the spinar'cord made in the dissecting room the general ' arrangement of the grey and white matter can be made out, and sections from the different regions of the cord can be distinguished from one another in fresh specimens, especially with the aid of a pocket lens. In the upper cervical region (at the level of the second or third cervical nerves) the | grey matter forms an H-shaped outline bearing a great resemblance to the outline in the dorsal region (fig, 439, B). Sections through this region are very difficult to distinguish fi-om sections of the dorsal cord with the naked eye. The microscope, however, reveals the absence of Clarke's column and the presence, in some cases, of root-fibres of the spinal accessory nerve. In the lower cervical region (fig. 439, A) the cord is elhptical in outline and the anterior horns of the grey crescents are very large; the section shows a certain similarity to a section i through the lumbar region (fig. 439, C). In the latter, however, the anterior horns are I more evenly rounded, the general outline approaches more nearly to a ch-cle, and the proportion of grey to white matter has greatly increased. j Sections of the dorsal region can be easily recognised with the microscope by the i presence of Clarke's column, which is confined to the dorsal, lowest part of the cervical, \ and the uppermost part of the lumbar regions. | Sections through the part of the cord from which the sacral nerves arise show a great j preponderance of grey matter. This feature becomes more marked as the termination of the cord is approached (fig. 439, D, E, and F). DEEP OKIGIN OF THE SPINAL NERVES The deep origins of the spinal nerves are (undoubtedly in the case of the anterior j roots, and possibly also in the case of the posterior roots) from nerve-cells embedded I in the grey matter of the cord. Only the principal connections of the roots are j described here ; other connections which are still doubtful are, for the sake of | simplicity, omitted. But little can be learned regarding the course of these nerve- | roots from the normal adult cord, and the facts detailed here have been chiefly l ascertained by embryological and pathological research. The success of the jSPINAL NEBVES 779 embryological method depends upon the fact that certain tracts or groups of fibres myehnate (or acquire their medullary sheath) at an earlier period than others, and therefore these tracts of meduUated fibres can be followed and recognised through a series of sections. The pathological method depends upon the trophic influence exercised by nerve-cells. It is found that every nerve-fibre must receive a certain influence from a nerve-cell in order to benefit by the lymph with which it is surrounded. This is called trophic influence. The trophic cells for the sensory fibres are situated in the ganglia in the posterior roots; hence, if the roots be divided between the cord and the ganglia, the nerve-tracts degenerate in an upward direction, and the degenerated tracts can be seen surrounded by the unaffected tracts. Ascending degeneration is, therefore, characteristic of centripetal tracts. The trophic cells for the motor fibres, however, are situated in the cerebral cortex ; hence injuries of the motor area of the cortex are followed by descending degenera- j tion of the motor tracts of the spinal cord. In speaking of the deep origin of the i spinal nerves in the cord, it is to be understood that we refer to the interruption of the nerve-fibres in nerve-cells ; from the nerve-cells other fibres arise in a manner not yet fully understood, and these fibres proceed upwards in the white columns of the cord to the brain. It is easy to recognise, particularly in the case of motor nerves, that the aggre- gations of nerve-cells in the cord correspond to, or are serially homologous with, the nuclei of the cranial nerves. In each case we have an interruption, in nerve-cells, ' of fibres proceeding from the cerebral cortex towards the periphery of the body. Just as injury to the anterior moiety of the posterior limb of the inner capsule will paralyse the motor fibres of the spinal nerves of the opposite side of the body, so will injury to the genu of the inner capsule paralyse the motor cranial nerves of ! the opposite side. The same remarks hold good in regard to the corresponding areas of the cortex. The anterior roots of the spinal nerves traverse the white matter of the cord ' in several bundles, and enter the anterior horn of grey matter. Some fibres (i) join cells, and eventually pass to the lateral pyramidal tract of the same side. Others (ii), after a similar interruption, pass to the anterior pyramidal tract of the same side. Others (iii) pass, via the anterior commissure, to cells in the anterior ! horn of the opposite side. Lastly, others (iv) pass to the cells of the lateral horn (fig. 440). The posterior roots enter the cord at the postero-lateral groove, and spread out in the following manner :—The most laterally placed fibres (v) pass upwards for a short distance in the boundary zone of Lissauer, and then enter the posterior horn; the intermediate fibres (vi) ^Dierce the substantia gelatinosa Rolandi, and are continued in a manner not yet fully understood; the innermost fibres (vii) enter Burdach's columns, and run upwards for a short distance in a longitudinal ' direction. From thence they are very probably continued as follows :—Some (vii[) pass into nerve-cells in. the posterior horn; others (ix) pass, via the posterior commissure, into Goll's column on the opposite side ; others (x) enter Clarke's column, and, after an interruption in the nerve-cells of the column, pass into the I direct cerebellar tract of the same side ; lastly, others (xi) enter Goll's column on ■the same side. Tracts of the spinal cord.—The accompanying diagram (fig. 440) indicates the position and general relation of those tracts, but it must be understood that they vary somewhat in difterent regions of the spinal cord. For instance, the anterior j pyramidal tract is not found below the lower part of the dorsal region, and the I .direct cerebellar tract disappears at the level of the upper lumbar nerve-roots. In I the antero-lateral column in the following tracts are found : anterior pyramidal, I anterior ground bundle, mixed lateral zone, Gower's tract, lateral ground bundle, lateral pyramidal tract, direct cerebellar tract. To these may be added the boundaryTHE NERVOUS SYSTEM 780 zone of Lissauer. In the posterior column, two tracts—the cohmms of Goll and Burdach—are found. We shall now proceed to trace these tracts toAvards the brain. As some of them are centripetal and some centrifugal, it would appear more scientific to trace the former brainwards and the latter towards the periphery, following the course of the nerve-current in each case. As, however, the functions and connections of some of these tracts are very imperfectly known, it will be more convenient to trace all of them in an upward, or cerebral, direction, more especially as, while they are tolerably clearly marked off in the spinal cord, their connections become very complicated when they enter the brain. The pyramidal tracts are the best defined in their course and connections, and may be described first. The larger or lateral pyramidal tract is placed in the Fig. I, II, III, IV, anterior root 440.—Diagram of the Tracts or the Spinal Cord and of the Deep Origins of the Spinal Nerves. The motor tracts are indicated by red shading, the sensory by blue. V, VI, VII, posterior root. BURDACH'S COLUMN GOLL'S COLUMN SUBSTANTIA GELATINOSA ROLANDI BOUNDARY ZONE OF LISSA UER LATERAL PYRAMIDAL TRACT DIRECT CEREBELLAR TRACT GOWER'S TRACT MIXED LATERAL ZONE AND ANTERIOR GROUND BUNDLE LATERAL GROUND BUNDLE {SENSORY PORTION) LATERAL GROUND BUNDLE {MOTOR PORTION) ANTERIOR PYRAMIDAL TRACT hinder part of the lateral column. The anterior pyramidal tract, very much the smaller, forms the innermost part of the anterior column. The fibres of the ante- rior nerve-roots, on entering the cord, suffer an interruption in the ganglion cells of the anterior horn of grey matter, but afterwards pass into the lateral pyramidal tract. The greater number ascend in this tract as far as the decussation of the pyramids, but a certain (variable) number pass through the anterior white com- missure to the opposite side of the cord, and ascend in the anterior pyramidal tract. At the decussation of the pyramids the fibres of the lateral pyramidal tract pass to the opposite side in coarse bundles, cutting through the neck of the anterior horn of grey matter, and join the fibres of the anterior pyramidal tract, which, it will be remembered, have already decussated, vid the anterior commissure, lower down. Thus all the fibres derived from the anterior roots pass to the opposite side of the body. It is right to mention, however, that ' recrossed fibres ' have recently been described by Sherrington—that is to say, fibres which, having decussated via781 TBACTS OF THE SPINAL COED the anterior commissure, cross a second time at the pyramidal decussation, and thus regain the side of the body from which they originally started. The two tracts, now united, form the pyramidal body, and ascend as a compact bundle as far as the pons Varolii. They then traverse the latter structure in the form of flattened fasciculi separated from one another by the transverse fibres of the pons. Then they emerge at the upper border of the pons, and pass upwards in the crusta of the crus cerebri forming about the middle third of that body. From thence they pass through the anterior moiety of the posterior limb of the inner capsule, and end in the Eolandic area; that is to say, in the paracentral lobule, the ascending frontal, and the ascending parietal convolutions. The anterior ground bundle and the mixed lateral zone may be described together, as their connections are similar, and they are only mapped off from one another by the fibres of the anterior roots, which cut through them. Taken thus together, they may be said to consist of fibres belonging to the anterior roots and of longitudinal commissural fibres. The latter fibres unite the groups of motor cells of different levels in the anterior horn with one another. Traced into the medulla, the anterior ground bundle gradually recedes from the surface as it becomes overlapped by the pyramidal body. Its fibres pass backwards, outwards, and upwards through the substance of the medulla, and then bend inwards towards the middle line and form the most dorsal portion of the substantia reticularis alba. The anterior ground bundle appears to be continuous with the posterior longitudinal bundle. The latter forms longitudinal communications between the nuclei of the facial and the eye-muscle nerves, and thus resembles the anterior ground bundle in uniting together a series of motor nuclei. The mixed lateral zone also passes into the substantia reticularis alba, forming its middle portion. Gower's tract is regarded as a centripetal tract. It is probably formed by fibres from the posterior roots of the spinal nerves, which cross in the posterior commissure, and then, after suffering an interruption in nerve-cells, ascend in the tract above mentioned. A portion of it appears to be lost in the cervical region of the cord. The rest passes to the nucleus lateralis of the medulla, and, after a partial or total interruption in the cells of that nucleus, passes on to form the external part of the tract of the fillet. The direct cerebellar tract, as already mentioned, commences at the level of the upper lumbar nerve-roots and augments as it ascends. It is formed of fibres chiefly uncrossed. These fibres are derived from the posterior roots which have suffered an interruption in the nerve-cells of Clarke's column. It ascends as a well-defined tract on the outer surface of the lateral pyramidal tract as far as the medulla; here it passes obliquely across the descending root of the fifth nerve and reaches the posterior surface of the medulla, where it joins the restiform body and thus passes to the superior vermis of the cerebellum. A certain number of the fibres, according to Monakow, do not join the restiform body but ascend in the tract of the fillet as far as the upper part of the valve of Vieussens, and then bend downwards and decussate in the substance of the valve and pass also to the superior vermis. The lateral ground bundle is a mixed tract. The motor fibres occupy the anterior and larger part, and are derived from the anterior horns. The sensory fibres, forming the posterior part of the tract, have probably the following deriva- tion. Some of the fibres of the posterior roots, after suffering an interruption in the cells of Clarke's column, enter the posterior columns and ascend for a very short distance in Burdach's column. They then pass obliquely through the grey matter of the posterior horn to form the sensory part of the lateral ground bundle. A few fibres may pass via the posterior commissure to the corresponding bundle on the opposite side. The bundle then ascends as far as the medulla, where its fibres, at a point immediately above the pyramidal decussation, cross over to theTHE NERVOUS SYSTEM 782 opposite side, entering into the sensory or superior pyramidal decussation (decus- satio lemnisci). From thence it ascends brainwards. The boundary zone of Lissauer is formed by the most lateral fibres of the posterior roots, which ascend for a short distance in that zone, and then leave it to enter the posterior horn. Burdach's column contains {a) sensory fibres from Clarke's colmnn ; (b) root fibres from the posterior roots ; and (c) longitudinal commissural fibres. (a) The fibres from Clarke's column have already been described in connection with the | lateral ground bundle. They are derived from the posterior roots, ascend only for | a very short distance in Burdach's column, and leave it again to join the posterior I or sensory part of the lateral ground bundle, (b) The fibres which are directly | derived from the posterior roots pass upwards; some enter GoU's column, others \ ascend to the nucleus cuneatus in the medulla. These fibres, after suffering | an interruption in the nerve-cells of the cuneate nucleus and nucleus of the clava, j divide into two groups ; one group decussates at the decussatio lemnisci, and goes , to swell the tract of the fillet ; the other goes to the restiform body, chiefly in the i form of arciform fibres, (c) The longitudinal commissural fibres originate ^nd ! terminate in the grey matter of the posterior horns, and thus unite groups of nerve- ' cells occupying different levels in the spinal cord. GoU's column is formed of longitudinal commissural fibres similar to the set (c) I in Burdach's column, inasmuch as they unite groups of nerve-cells which are ij placed at different levels in the posterior horns. They differ from the fibres i in Burdach's column, however, by the fact that the individual fibres are very long, i Goll's column diminishes in size when traced downwards, and is feebly represented ' in the portion of the cord from which the sacral nerves arise. The ultimate source ! of its fibres is from the posterior roots, which reach it in a manner not yet fully | understood. It terminates above in the nucleus of the clava, from whence fibres i pass to the tract of the fillet and to the restiform body in the manner already \ noticed in the description of Burdach's column. I Having now described the course of the tracts in the spinal cord, and the more I direct continuation of these tracts into the brain, it will be necessary to recapi- ' tulate the constitution of some of the best defined of the groups of fibres and which { proceed to the cerebrum and cerebellum, namely, the fillet, the posterior longitudinal | bundle, and the restiform body. | Fillet.—The term fillet (lemniscus) was originally applied to the triangular \ band of fibres which comes to the surface at the lateral groove of the mesen- ! cephalon and winds round the superior cerebellar peduncle to disappear (as far as [ macroscopic observation is concerned) in the region of the testes. The system of ] fibres to which this superficial set belongs is now known as the inferior or lateral \ fillet (fig. 425), while other fibres, more deeply placed, form the superior or mesial j fillet. The superior fillet is in part derived from the columns of GoU and Burdach I of the opposite side ; these fibres, after an interruption in the nerve-cells of the clavate and cuneate nuclei, pass across at the decussatio lemnisci. The continuation of Gower's tract applies itself to the outer side of these fibres, and thus a broad band of fibres, the tract of the fillet, is formed. It is very conspicuous in trans- ! verse sections through the pons (fig. 429). The innermost part bends downwards j into the crusta of the cerebral peduncle, and passes from without inwards to | form the outermost constituent of the crusta. The remaining and by far the j larger part of the tract passes upwards, occupying the most ventral portion of the I tegment of the lower part of the mesencephalon, and then, assuming a more dorsal j position, encloses the nucleus of the superior quadrigeminal body of the same side, some fibres crossing in the raphe to enter, with a similar relation, the superior j quadrigeminal body of the opposite side. Other fibres are described which pass brainwards on the outer side of the red nucleus. Some of these fibres end in the :BESTIFOBM BODY—FIBRES OF CEBEBELLUM 783 optic thalamus, while others probably pass to the cortex cerebri via the inner capsule. The inferior fillet arises chiefly in the pons from the superior olive and from the nucleus of the inferior fillet. The latter is a collection of nerve-cells which is placed close to the cerebral end of the superior olive. The inferior fillet comes to the surface at the lateral groove of the mesencephalon as above described, and then encloses the nucleus of the testis. A portion of it decussates above the aqueduct of Sylvius to reach the testis of the opposite side. Many additional fibres have been said to join the fillet; in particular, fibres from the anterior column may be mentioned (Homan and Spitzka). The posterior longitudinal bundle may be regarded as the cerebral continua- tion of the anterior ground bundle of the cord. It is generally believed to establish communications between the nuclei of the eye-muscle nerves. Its connection with the facial nerve is described in the account of the anatomy of that nerve (page 810). The restiform body is the continuation of the direct cerebellar tract together with fibres from the columns of Goll and Burdach. Its connection with these columns is partly crossed, partly uncrossed. The uncrossed fibres have been shown to take a larger share in the formation of the restiform body than the crossed fibres (Darkschewitsch and Freud). The crossed fibres all reach the restiform body as arciform fibres ; many of these fibres traverse the olivary nucleus but without entering into connection with its nerve-cells (Edinger) ; they also traverse the accessory olives and may pierce the ascending root of the trigeminal nerve ; they all decussate at the raphe, and from thence proceed in two groups, superficial and deep arciform fibres. The superficial arciform fibres emerge through the anterior fissure of the medulla, some also through the sulcus paramedianus ventralis, and arch round the pyramidal body and olive to join the restiform body. In this part of their course they pass between the root-fibres of the ninth, tenth, eleventh, and twelfth nerves. The deep arciform fibres, after crossing in the raphe, traverse the olivary nucleus of the opposite side, and pass from thence, through the substance of the medulla, into the restiform body. The olivary body also sends fibres to the restiform body. Fibres pass out of the hilum and cross in the raphe; they then traverse the olivary body of the opposite side and join the restiform body. The fibres of the cerebellum may be described under the following heads : [a) Fibres derived from the cerebellar peduncles, and {h) intrinsic fibres, {a) The fibres from the pons (middle peduncle) are, as already described (page 760), partly true commissural fibres, and partly fibres which establish (with or without the intervention of nerve-cells) a crossed connection between the cerebrum and cerebellum. The upper fibres of the pons pass into the lateral parts of the cerebellar hemispheres, and end in the grey cortex. The middle fibres sweep downwards, forming the oblique fasciculus, and end in the folia of the inferior surface. The lower fibres accompany the restiform body to the superior surface. The restiform body (inferior peduncle) is joined on entering the cerebellum by the inferior fibres of the pons ; the two together unite into a distinct round bundle, the inner part of which is formed by the restiform body ; the outer by the pons-fibres. This bundle passes through a distinct gap or interval bounded by the superior peduncle internally, and by the greater part of the middle peduncle externally. Its fibres then spread out into a layer (fibraB semicirculares of Stilling), which are disposed in gentle curves convex backwards and outwards ; these fibres cover the capsule of the corpus dentatum, and finally sweep abruptly upwards into the folia of the superior vermis. Some fibres enter the nucleus fastigii. The corpus dentatum is covered by a distinct capsule of fibres (the ' fleece' of Stilling) derived from the olivary nucleus of the opposite side. The fibres are probably for the most part interrupted in the nerve-cells of the corpus dentatum,I I 784 THE NEBVOUS SYSTEM and are then (indirectly) continued into the white matter which occupies the interior of that phcated bag of grey matter. From the hikmi of the corpus dentatum a bundle of fibres passes out, which is joined by fibres from the fleece, and thus the superior cerebellar peduncle is formed. The superior cerebellar peduncle passes upwards and inwards, and receives a covering on its outer side from the inferior fillet. It disappears from the surface by passing under cover of the testis of its own side, and assumes a deeper position in the mesencephalon, passing to the ventral side of the aqueduct of Sylvius. It decussates with its fellow of the opposite side, the decussation being most pronounced at the level of the centre of the nates. The decussation being completed, each peduncle proceeds brainwards as a distinct column. This column of fibres soon encounters the red nucleus, and the fibres pass through the nucleus in small bundles, the cross-section of which gives the punctated appearance to the red nucleus which is so charac- teristic of that body when seen in coronal section. Beyond the red nucleus, fibres of the superior peduncles certainly enter the optic thalamus, and probably the globus pallidus and the cortex cerebri. , [b) Sagittally-directed fibres are placed within the superior vermis. When traced forwards these fibres are found to decussate with their fellows of the opposite side in front and above the nucleus fastigii; here they are joined by true ; commissural fibres from its hemispheres, the whole forming the great anterior cerebellar commissure of Stilling. Fibres unite the different folia to one another, constituting a system of fibres which form the most peripheral part of the arbor vitae. These fibres, from their general arrangement, are called garland-like fasciculi. Nerve-tracts in the substance of the thalamencephalon and prosencephalon.— The systems of fibres which are connected with the optic thalamus may be first considered ; the principal of these are : (a) The posterior commissure ; (b) the corona radiata of the optic thalamus ; and (c) the bundle of Vicq d'Azyr. {a) The posterior commissure undoubtedly contains a tract of fibres which passes i from the optic thalamus to the tegmental region of the mesencephalon on the opposite side ; but beyond this, nothing is known with any degree of certainty. It is said to transmit fibres from the fillet and from the posterior longitudinal bundle to the opposite side. Fibres are also said to proceed via this commissure from the ganglion habenul^e and the pineal body to the oculo-motor nucleus of the opposite side. It is therefore a bundle of decussating fibres derived from various sources, and probably does not contain any true commissural fibres. {b) The corona radiata of the optic thalamus is formed of a system of fibres which converge to the thalamus from the cortex of the frontal, parietal, occipital, | and temporal lobes, and it also receives a small bundle from the cortical part of the olfactory tract. Portions of this system, namely, the fibres from the occipital lobe j (posterior peduncle of the thalamus), and from the temporal lobe (inferior peduncle), i require special notice. The posterior peduncle of the thalamus (optic radiation) passes backwards in the white matter of the hemisphere in company with a great bundle of sensory fibres to the occipital lobe. It is further described in connection with the optic nerve (page 790). The inferior peduncle may, for the sake of simplicity, be described with the ansa peduncularis, as it forms an important j constituent of that body. The ansa peduncularis may be exposed from the base of the brain by dissecting the optic tract from the surface of the crus cerebri. It is a band of fibres which winds round the ventral surface of the crusta just at the transition of the latter into the inner capsule. Its principal constituents are the ansa lenticularis and i the inferior peduncle of the thalamus. The ansa lenticularis proceeds from the ■ medullary laminae of the lenticular nucleus and passes transversely inwards ; immediately below the globus pallidus. It then enters the subthalamic region, and785 COBONA BADIATA without doubt passes into the mesencephalon, but its exact course cannot be followed with certainty. The inferior peduncle of the thalamus is partly formed by a sagitally-directed bundle which passes backwards through the substance of the thalamus between the anterior pillar of the fornix and the bundle of Vicq d'Azyr. This bundle is joined by fibres from the superior surface of the thalamus (stratum zonale). The fibres from the stratum zonale pass from the superior to the internal surface of the thalamus, and finally, reaching the inferior surface of that body, join the sagittal bundle first mentioned to form the inferior peduncle ; the latter now passes outwards below the ansa lenticularis and ends in the cortex of the temporal lobe. (c) The bundle of Vicq d'Azyr passes from the anterior tubercle of the thalamus to the nucleus of the corpus albicans. It might be regarded as a consti- I tuent of the corona radiata—the nucleus of the corpus albicans being considered as 1 modified cortex. The white matter of the cerebral hemispheres contains the following systems of fibre : (a) The corona radiata ; {h) commissural or interhemispheric fibres ; (c) association or intrahemispheric fibres. These three systems of fibres are disposed in more or less defined tracts which can be unravelled by dissection, but in certain situations where the difierent tracts cross one another the arrangement becomes more complicated. This is notably the case in the region where the fibres I of the corpus callosum intersect the fibres of the inner capsule. !The corona radiata is the name given to the prolongation of the fibres of the inner capsule into the hemisphere. It is continued upwards from the inner capsule as a somewhat narrow band (peduncle of the corona radiata), but the fibres soon spread out like a fan and proceed to the cerebral cortex. It will be well at this stage to re-examine the constitution of the inner capsule; the latter contains three sets of fibres, namely : (a) Fibres which pass from the crusta of the crus cerebri directly into the corona radiata without the intervention of nerve-cells ; [h) fibres passing from the mesencephalon into the optic thalamus and corpus striatum; and (c) fibres from the thalamus (part of the corona radiata of that body) ; and from the corpus striatum to the cerebral cortex. We have already seen (page 742) that I the inner capsule shows in horizontal section an anterior limb, a posterior limb Iand a genu. The fibres which occupy the most anterior part of the anterior limb belong to the corona radiata of the optic thalamus. Behind these fibres is a tract which extends nearly to the genu ; this tract is formed by fibres which are derived from the frontal lobe, and although their function is not accurately known they [ are supposed to be associated with the higher intellectual functions. Traced down- wards, this bundle passes into the crusta, forming rather more than the inner fifth of that body, and from thence enters the pons, where a part of it seems to terminate j (frontal pontine tract). Its further course is unknown. The portion of the inner \ capsule immediately in front of the genu is intimately associated with the faculty of speech ; it passes in the crusta immediately external to the frontal pontine tracts. The genu conveys fibres from the cortex cerebri to some of the motor cranial nerves. These fibres pass immediately external to the preceding (aphasia) bundle, and probably decussate in the pons to become connected to the nuclei of the facial and hypoglossal nerves, and to the motor nucleus of the trigeminal. The anterior two-thirds of the posterior limb of the inner capsule is formed by the pyramidal 1 tract which has already been sufficiently described (page 780). The posterior third of the posterior limb of the inner capsule is formed by sensory fibres comprising the optic radiation ; the latter proceeds exclusively from the occipital lobe. The I remaining sensory fibres are derived from the occipital and temporal, and to I a certain extent from the parietal, lobes. They descend in the crusta, occupying the outer third of that body. As this sensory tract traverses the crusta, its outer- j most part is formed by fibres derived from the fillet (page 782). 3 ETHE NERVOUS SYSTEM 786 The commissural system, consisting of the corpus callosum and the anterior commissure, has been akeacly described (pages 733, 742). The intrahemispheric or association fibres unite different portions of the cortex of the same hemisphere to one another. These fibres are in two sets—a long and a short. The short fibres (fibrae arcuatse sen propri^e) unite two adjacent convolu- tions, the fibres passing round beneath the fissure which separates the two convolutions. The long fibres are disposed in several more or less well-defined tracts, namely : the cingulum, the fasciculus arcuatus, the fasciculus uncinatus, the perpendicular occipital fasciculus, and the fasciculus longitudinalis inferior. The cingulum is a well-defined band, which occupies the core of the gyrus fornicatus. Near the splenium of the corpus callosum it receives an acces- sion of fibres from the occipital lobe. The fasciculus arcuatus passes from the cortex of the frontal to the occipital lobe ; it also sends some fibres into the temporal lobe. The fasciculus uncinatus springs from the orbital gyri and from the inferior frontal convolution, and, after traversing the lower part of the claustrum, ends in the cortex of the temporal lobe hear the amygdaloid nucleus. The perpendicular occipital fasciculus passes from the inferior parietal lobule to the inferior occipito-temporal convolution. The fasciculus longitudinalis inferior is an extremely well-defined bundle which passes from the occipital to the temporal lobe. The external capsule also belongs to the association system, as it is chiefly concerned with the convolutions of the island of Eeil. THE PERIPHERAL NERVOUS SYSTEM The cerebro-spinal nerves, together with the end-organs of these nerves, the sympathetic system and the gangha which are connected to both the cerebro-spinal and the sympathetic nerves, make up the peripheral nervous system. The cerebro- spinal nerves are invariably paired, and, with a few exceptions (notably the vagus), are symmetrical in their origin, course, and distribution on the two sides of the body. The cranial nerves arise directly from the brain and pass out from the skull through foramina in the cranial wall. The spinal nerves arise by anterior and posterior roots from the spinal cord, and leave the spinal canal by passing through the intervertebral foramina. The first spinal nerve is somewhat exceptional, as its origin is partly from the medulla, and, moreover, it leaves the spinal canal by passing between the occipital bone and the atlas. THE CEANIAL NERVES The cranial nerves are classified into nine pairs by Willis, and into twelve pairs by Soemmerring. Willis's classification depends upon the manner in which the nerves pierce the dura mater ; for example, the giosso-pharyngeal, vagus, and spinal accessory nerves all pierce that membrane opposite the jugular foramen, hence they collectively form a cranial nerve (the eighth) of Willis. In Soemmerring's classification each nerve-trunk is considered separately. Willis's classification was formerly in general use in this country ; it is now, however, generally discarded in favour of Soemmerring's classification. The latter will be followed in this work. The following table will explain the relation of Willis's to Soemmerring's- classification :—787 CBANIAL NEBVES Willis First pair of nerves Second „ Soemmerriiig First pair of nerves Second Third Fourth Fifth Sixth Seventh Ei^?hth Ninth Third Fourth Fifth Sixth jPortio dura Seventh ' Portio niolhs Eighth (Ninth j Tenth (Eleventh Twelfth Xames Olfactory Optic Ocnlo-motor Pathetic or trochlear Trigeminal or trifacial Abducent Facial Auditory Glosso-pharyngeal Pneumogastric or vagus Spinal accessory Hypoglossal It will be well to notice here that the olfactory and optic nerves are not serially homologous with the other cranial nerves, but are rather outgrowths of the cerebral Fig. 441.—Surface Origin of the Cranial Nerves.

The ' filaments of the olfactory nerve/ which pierce the cribriform plate of the ethmoid bone, correspond collectively to a cranial nerve. In the case of the optic nerve, the retina, as a study of its development shows, is a portion of the brain extruded beyond the cranial wall, and the ganglionic layer of the retina m all probability corresponds to the ' nucleus of origin ' of an ordinary cranial nerve. The nervous elements which intervene betAveen the ganglionic layer of the retina and the rods and cones therefore represent the true optic nerves. 8 E 2788 THE NEBVOUS SYSTEM I j Superficial and deep origins.—The point at which a cranial nerve emerges from the substance of the brain is called its superficial origin ; while the collection of nerve-cells to which its fibres can be followed is called its deep origin. It must be clearly understood, however, that the deep origin is only the proximate origin of the nerve, the real origin is in the cerebral cortex. For example, injuries to the lower portions of the ascending parietal and ascending frontal convolutions almost as surely paralyse the facial and hypoglossal nerves as if the nuclei of these nerves had been destroyed in the medulla. General distribution.—The olfactory, optic, and auditory nerves are exclusively nerves of special sense, and are distributed to the nose, the eye, and the ear, respec- j tively. Of the remaining nerves, some are motor, others are mixed. The motor j nerves are : the third, fourth, and sixth to the ocular muscles, the seventh to the ' platysma and to the superficial muscles of the face, and the twelfth to the muscles | of the tongue. The mixed are the fifth, which is chiefly sensory to the face, teeth, \ eye, external ear, and fore part of the scalp, but also motor to the muscles of masti- I cation; the ninth, which contains fibres for the special sense of taste, also ordinary | sensory and motor fibres ; the tenth which conveys sensory fibres to the external j ear, and both motor and sensory fibres to the pharynx, larynx, heart, lungs, . trachea, oesophagus, and stomach; and the eleventh, which divides into a spinal part, wholly motor, destined for the sterno-mastoid and trapezius muscles, and a mixed or accessory part which joins the tenth. \ In the following pages the course of each nerve is described in order from its so-called deep origin to its peripheral distribution ; the ultimate connection with the cortex is described in the anatomy of the brain. An exception is made, however, ; in the case of the olfactory and optic nerves, the cerebral connections of which j are described in this place. j FIKST OR OLFACTORY NERVES j j The grey filaments, about twenty to thirty in number, which arise from the ; under surface of the olfactory bulb, together constitute, as above noticed, the olfactory or first nerve; the olfactory tract and bulb, formerly described as the first nerve, being in reality a part of the brain. It will be convenient to describe the tract and bulb first, and then to take the nerves at the point where they appear on the surface of the bulb, and trace them to their central origin. The peripheral dis- j tribution will be afterwards described. The olfactory tract is an elongated body, | triangular in coronal section. It is covered at its anterior end by a cap of grey i matter, the olfactory bulb. Both tract and bulb occupy the olfactory sulcus on I the orbital surface of the frontal lobe. In the natural position the tract rests upon | the upper surface of the sphenoid bone, in front of the optic grooA'e, while the bulb j is in contact with the cribriform plate of the ethmoid bone. The olfactory tract j contains in its interior a strand of connective tissue, which occupies the position j of the obliterated ventricular cavity (page 724); above this the tract is formed by ! grey matter, the cortex of the tract. The latter is continuous with the cerebral j cortex, along the inner side of the olfactory sulcus, and also with the small trans- | verse convolution which closes in that sulcus posteriorly. The inferior surface of i the tract, including the internal and external angles, is covered by white matter, j the component fibres of which run in a sagittal direction. The roots of the { olfactory tract are the direct continuations of this white matter. Three roots are ; usually described, an external and an internal white root, and a middle or grey root, j The external root is the largest and most important of these. It passes along the i outer boundary of the anterior perforated space to the temporal lobe, and ends in \ the amygdaloid nucleus and the adjacent part of the cortex. The middle root j passes backwards and upwards under cover of the tuber olfactorium, a greyishOLFACTORY NEBVES 789 elevation which is placed in the front part of the anterior perforated space ; from thence it passes into the anterior commissure. The internal root passes backwards and inwards, and then bends upwards to end in the anterior extremity of the gyrus fornicatus. According to Obersteiner, ' no white mesial root, as commonly described, is to be seen ; nor does a middle grey root, in the common meaning of the term, exist.' The following is an outline of the cerebral part of the course of the olfactory fi"bres. On entering the olfactory bulb, they suffer an interruption in the nerve- cells of that body, these cells apparently corresponding to the nucleus of origin of an ordinary cranial nerve. From thence the fibres enter the white matter of the olfactory tract and may be here classified into two groups, namely :—(a) Fibres which enter the cortex of the tract; and {b) fibres which pass through the white Fig. 442.—Nerves of the Nasal Cavity^ NASAL OLFACTORY FRONTAL SINUS NERVE NERVE OLFACTORY NKllVE TO SUPE- RJoR TURBINATE I'.nNE SPHENOIDAL SINUS VIDIAN NERVE MECKEUS GANGLION DES( ENDING I'A LA TINE ORIFICE OF EUSTACHIAN TUBE NASAL BRANCHES, Ji _ I'USTERIOR PA LA TINE ANTERIOR PALATINE MIDDLE PALATINE matter to other parts of the brain without becoming connected to the cortex of the tract, {a) From the cortex of the tract some fibres pass via the external white root to the cortex of the temporal lobe. Others enter the anterior commissure, and proceed to the cerebral cortex of the opposite side. (6) Of the fibres which pass directly through the tract, some pass by the external white root to the temporal lobe ; others pass as a slender tract into the under border of the internal capsule, and so reach the front of the optic thalamus (Obersteiner). A commissural bundle of fibres, which passes from one olfactory tract to its fellow of the opposite side, via the anterior commissure, is also described. In its peripheral distribution, the olfactory nerve does not extend beyond the limits of the mucous membrane which invests the ethmoid bone. The olfactory filaments are composed exclusively of non-meduUated fibres, and to this their pearly grey colour is due. As they pass through the foramina in the cribriform plate, they are invested by sheaths derived from the dura mater.790 THE NERVOUS SYSTEM They are divided into two groups, an outer and an inner. Both groups ramify between the periosteum and the deep surface of the mucous membrane. The outer group, twelve to twenty in number (Valentin), enter the nose through the outer series of foramina in the cribriform plate, and form a richly-meshed plexus on the | upper surfaces of the superior and middle turbinated bones. The inner group, | twelve to sixteen in number (Valentin), pass through the inner series of foramina | close to the crista galli, and on entering the nose are lodged at first in grooves on the perpendicular plate of the ethmoid bone. They communicate with one another, forming a plexus, and finally break up into spreading tufts of extremely fine filaments. SECOND OE OPTIC NEKVES ! The optic nerves appear at the base of the brain as a pair of round white I cords, which arise from the optic chiasma. From the posterior aspect of the • latter structure, two somewhat similar cords, the optic tracts, pass backw^ards and I outwards. Each optic nerve is continuous, through the chiasma, with both optic i tracts. It will be convenient to trace first the central connections of the optic nerves through the optic tracts, and afterwards to follow the nerves forwards from 1 the optic chiasma to the eyeball. I The optic chiasma or commissure rests upon the optic groove, on the superior \ surface of the sphenoid bone. It is in relation above with the third ventricle, j being separated only by a thin layer of grey matter from that cavity. The internal j carotid arteries are close to its outer sides. | Constitution of the optic chiasma.—Four sets of fibres have been described in | the optic chiasma, namely : (a) Fibres from one optic tract to the optic nerve of the i same side; (b) fibres from one optic tract to the optic nerve of the opposite side ; ; (c) commissural fibres passing from one optic tract to its fellow of the opposite side; and (d) fibres from one optic nerve to the nerve of the opposite side. The | existence of the first three sets is well ascertained. The fourth set is now very j generally believed to have been erroneously described, {a) The uncrossed fibres | proceed from the lateral or temporal half of the retina of the same side. They j occupy the outer part of the chiasma. (b) The crossed fibres, w^hich form the j largest constituent of the chiasma, are derived from the mesial or nasal half of | the retina, and pass into the optic tract of the opposite side, (c) The commissural ! fibres occupy the back part of the chiasma. They have nothing to do with vision, i Two sets are described under the names of Gudden's and Meynert's commissures. ' The optic tract passes backwards and outwards along the outer side of the j tuber cinereum, and then passes under cover of the temporal lobe, winding around ; the crus cerebri. As it applies itself to the latter, it adheres to it, and becomes flattened from above dowmwards. It next inclines upwards, and divides into an external and an internal root. These roots proceed towards the external and j internal geniculate bodies, respectively. The internal root contains the fibres of ; Gudden's commissure. A portion of the external root becomes connected wdth the nerve-cells in the ; -external geniculate body ; another part enters the pulvinar of the optic thalamus, | while a third part passes in the superior brachium to the superior quadrigeminal j body of the same side. ! The fibres of the optic nerve are therefore interrupted in the ganglion cells of \ the external geniculate body, the pulvinar of the optic thalamus, and the superior. i quadrigeminal body ; hence, these three bodies are said to contain the nuclei of i origin of the optic nerve. Other fibres, however, collectively termed the optic radiation, pass out of these three bodies, and pass through the most posterior part J of the inner capsule to the occipital lobe, and thus the cortical origin of the optic |OPTIC NEBVES 791 i nerve is established. The exact area of the cortex devoted to the sense of sight is still a matter of dispute, but the weight of evidence seems to be in favour of the cuneus being the cerebral centre of vision, j Other roots of the optic nerve are described, of which the direct cortical root I (Wernicke and Gudden) is perhaps the most important. This root leaves the optic tract as the latter is crossing the crus cerebri, and runs upwards in the inner capsule to join the optic radiation. Another root is described which passes from the optic chiasma into the central grey matter of the third ventricle. The descending root (Stilling) enters the crus and is variously distributed; a portion of its fibres become connected with the oculo-motor nucleus, and thus a path for reflex movements of the iris and ciliary muscle is probably established. Gudden's commissure.—Fibres emerge from the posterior quadrigeminal body, j constituting its brachium, and enter the internal geniculate body. After partial interruption in the nerve-cells of the latter, these fibres are continued into the optic tract and pass across to the opposite side, forming the back part of the optic chiasma, to enter into a similar relation to the internal geniculate and posterior quadrigeminal bodies of the opposite side. Meynert's commissure.—From the grey matter of the tuber cinereum fibres arise which cross the middle line behind Gudden's commissure and enter the crusta I on the opposite side, from whence they are said to pass into the subthalamic body. The optic nerve passes forwards and outwards from the chiasma and enters the orbit through the optic foramen, accompanied by the ophthalmic artery, the i vessel being external to and slightly below the nerve. It then slightly changes its I direction and passes almost directly forw^ards to enter the back of the eyeball about I three millimetres internal to and slightly below the posterior extremity of the optic axis ; having gained the interior of the eyeball its fibres spread out in the retina. In its course through the orbit it is surrounded by the ciliary arteries and nerves ; its upper surface is crossed obliquely by the ophthalmic artery, and the lenticular ganglion is in contact with its outer surface. Near the optic foramen it is sur- rounded by, and in close relation to, the four recti muscles; but further forw^ards it is separated from the muscles by an interval containing fat. The arteria centralis retinae pierces the under surface of the optic nerve near the middle point of the intraorbital part of its course and runs from thence into the eyeball in the I axis of the nerve. Very distinct prolongations of the cerebral membranes accom- pany the optic nerve. The dura mater, having entered the orbit through the optic ! foramen, delaminates into the orbital periosteum and the sheath of the optic nerve ; the latter is tough and strong, and becomes continuous with the sclerotic of the eyeball. Within the dura mater is a narrow subdural space, then the arachnoid and a comparatively wide subarachnoid space, the inner boundary of which is formed by the pia mater, which invests the bundles of nerve-fibres. I THIRD OR OCULO-MOTOR NERVES The third or oculo-motor nerve arises from a column of nerve-cells which is placed in the grey matter beneath the floor of the aqueduct of Sylvius immediately [ dorsal to the posterior longitudinal bundle. This nucleus extends from the level ' of the posterior commissure to a point corresponding to the interval between the nates and testes, where it is imperfectly separated from the nucleus of the fourth nerve. The fibres arising from this nucleus pass downw^ards and forwards in a series of fasciculi, which traverse the posterior longitudinal bundle, the red nucleus, j and the inner part of the substantia nigra. The fibres emerge (superficial origin) in a r row of about nine fasciculi from the oculo-motor groove at the inner side of the crus. The third nerve passes between the superior cerebellar and posterior cerebral792 THE NEBVOUS SYSTEM arteries, and then pierces the dura mater about midway between the anterior and posterior clinoid processes of the sphenoid bone in the centre of a httle triangular space which has the following boundaries : externally, the free margin of the tentorium cerebelli, posteriorly the attached margin of the tentorium, and internally a ridge of dura mater which extends from the posterior to the anterior clinoid process. It then enters the outer wall of the cavernous sinus and runs forwards to the sphenoidal fissure, occupying a position superior and internal to the fourth Fig. 443.—Deep Origin of the Third Nerve. (After Krause.) nerve. At the sphenoidal fissure it divides into a superior and an inferior division. These divisions, as they enter the orbit through the sphenoidal fissure, pass between the two heads of the external rectus muscle, and are separated from one another by the nasal branch of the ophthalmic division of the fifth nerve. The superior division supplies the superior rectus. It enters that muscle on its ocular surface and sends a branch through it to supply the levator palpebrse superioris. The inferior division, considerably larger than the superior, divides into three branches ; two of these, the nerves to the internal and inferior rectus muscles,TBOGRLEAB NEBVES 793 pierce the ocular surfaces of the muscles which they supply. The third branch, the nerve to the inferior oblique, is considerably longer than the other two. It runs forwards in the interval between the inferior and external rectus muscles, and pierces the posterior border of the inferior oblique. Near its commencement it gives off the short or motor root to the lenticular ganglion. The third nerve supplies all the orbital muscles, with the exception of the external rectus and the superior oblique. It also supplies (through the lenticular ganglion) the ciliary muscle and the circular fibres of the iris (sphincter iridis). FOURTH OE TROCHLEAR NERVES The fourth or trochlear nerve arises from a column of nerve-cells which is continuous with the nucleus of the third nerve. This column of cells is embedded in the central grey matter below the aqueduct, and extends from the level of the interval between the nates and testes to the lower margin of the latter bodies. Fig. 444.—Sections through the Origin of the Fourth Nerve. (Stilling.) (The upper figure is an oblique section, the lower is a coronal section.) AQUEDUCT OF SYLVIUS NUCLEUS OF FOURTH- NERVE POSTERIOR LONGI-- TUDINAL BUNDLE RAPHE- ■AQUEDUCT OF SYLVIUS SUPERIOR CEREBELLAR PEDUNCLE .FILLET The nerve-fibres issuing from this elongated nucleus form two or three rounded bundles, which run downwards, backwards, and slightly outwards along the outer j side of the nucleus, and then incline inwards to reach the valve of Vieussens, in the substance of which they decussate with their fellows of the opposite side and become collected into a single bundle (fig. 444). This bundle emerges as a slender I rounded fasciculus (superficial origin) from the valve of Vieussens, close to the frenulum veli, immediately below the testes, and winds round the crus cerebri to appear at the base of the brain near the anterior margin of the pons. The right nerve, therefore, arises from the left nucleus and vice versa. I The fourth nerve pierces the dura mater at a point a little behind and external I to the posterior clinoid process of the sphenoid bone in the postero-external angle [ of the triangular space which has been described in connection with the third nerve. It runs forwards in the outer wall of the cavernous sinus, being placed between the third nerve which is above and internal to it, and the ophthalmic division of the fifth nerve, which is situated below and to its outer side. As it794 THE NERVOUS SYSTEM approaches the sphenoidal fissure it bends upwards, crosses on the outer side of the third nerve, and passes through the innermost part of the sphenoidal fissure. As it passes through the fissure it is placed above and internal to the frontal nerve. It then passes inwards above the origin of the levator palpebrfe superioris muscle, and pierces the orbital surface of the superior obhque muscle, in which it ends. The fourth nerve is the smallest of the cranial nerves. It is remarkable for the length of its intracranial course and for its mode of decussation. FIFTH OE TKIGEMINAL NERVE j The fifth or trigeminal nerve consists of two parts, a large sensory root (portio major) and a small motor root (portio minor). The portio major passes into a ganglion (Gasserian ganglion) which has been compared to the ganghon on the posterior root of a spinal nerve, which it probably resembles in exercising a trophic infiuence on the nerve fibres, though this has not been experimentally proved. The ' superficial origin ' of the nerve is from the side of the pons near its upper border. The deep origin of the portio major is chiefiy by the ascending root, a long tract of fibres which runs for a considerable distance within the cerebro-spinal i axis. The portio major has, however, in addition to this, several supplementary | origins. The portio minor arises principally from a nucleus which is embedded in the grey matter of the fioor of the fourth ventricle, but it also receives the ■ whole or the greater part of a long tract of fibres, which passes downwards from the mesencephalon, and which is termed the descending root. The ascending root commences in the upper part of the spinal cord at the level | of the second cervical nerve, and passes upwards, increasing in size as it ascends, i It is placed on the outer side of the substantia gelatinosa, in w^hich some of its fibres appear to take origin. In transverse sections through the lower part of the medulla it appears as a crescentic white bundle of fibres, convex outwards, placed i on the outer side of the substantia gelatinosa, and covered only by some white j matter belonging to the direct cerebellar tract (fig. 432). Higher up it is more deeply placed, being covered by the restiform body and by the roots of the i auditory nerve. In the grey matter of the upper third of the fourth ventricle it comes in contact with a cluster of nerve cells which is termed the accessory sensory nucleus; here it takes a bend downwards and forwards, partly intersecting the i accessory nucleus, receives accessions of fibres from that nucleus, and, according to most observers, also from the cerebellum and from the substantia ferruginea of the opposite side. It now passes downwards and forwards somewhat obhquely through the pons, and emerges (superficial origin) as the portio major of the fifth nerve at the side of the pons near the superior border. The accessory nucleus is a ; mass of cells of an elongated ovoid form embedded in the grey matter of the floor of the fourth ventricle at a level a little above the striae acusticse. The cerebellar root passes downwards and forwards from the cerebellum around the outer side of the superior cerebellar peduncle of its own side, and joins the outermost portion of the sensory root. The descending root arises from a column of nerve-cells which is embedded in the grey matter of the aqueduct above and external to the nucleus of the third nerve. The root commences at the level of the upper part of the nates, and increases in size as it descends, forming a white bundle of fibres crescentic in section, some of these fibres being connected with the nerve-cells which are placed on their inner side (fig. 444, v). It passes through the grey matter of the upper part of the floor of the fourth ventricle, close to the outer side of the substantia ferru- ; ginea, and reaches the upper part of the motor nucleus of the fifth nerve. Here it is joined by the principal part of the motor root, which arises from the motorOPHTHALMIC DIVISION OF THE FIFTH NEBVE 795 i nucleus, and by a few fibres from the motor nucleus of the opposite side. It then passes downwards and forwards through the pons to emerge as the portio minor of the fifth nerve. At its emergence it is placed a little in front of the sensory portion, and is separated from the latter by some of the transverse fibres of the pons. The motor nucleus is an ovoid mass of cells considerably shorter than the accessory sensory nucleus, on the inner side of which it is placed. It is on the same line as the nucleus of the facial nerve, and is immediately in front of that nucleus. According to some observers some fibres of the descending root enter the sensory root and are said to eventually pass into the ophthalmic division. The sensory and motor roots of the nerve pass downwards and forwards towards I an aperture in the dura mater which is placed under cover of the tentorium I cerebelli, a little external to the apex of the petrous portion of the temporal bone. i In this course the motor root takes a half-spiral turn around the sensory root, passing first to the inner side, and then below the latter. Both roots then pass I through the aperture above mentioned to enter Meckel's space, between the sup- porting and periosteal layers of the dura mater. The motor root passes out of the skull through the foramen ovale, accompanied by a larger sensory bundle from the Gasserian ganglion, and joins Anth the latter outside the skull to form the mandibular (or inferior maxillary) division of the fifth nerve. The sensory root i spreads out into a flattened, somewhat fan-shaped, plexiform bundle, and enters i the Gasserian ganglion. The Gasserian ganglion is a reddish-grey band of ganglionic matter, with its long axis slightly curved so as to present a convexity forwards and outwards. The upper and lower surfaces of the ganglion are also slightly convex and are some- ' what adherent to the dura mater, the upper surface being more firmly attached than the lower. It rests on a depression on the petrous bone and, in front of this, on the cartilage which occupies the foramen lacerum medium. From the convex antero-external border of the ganglion, three large bundles of nerve-fibres arise. The first or ophthalmic division enters the orbit through the sphenoidal fissure. The second or maxillary (superior maxillary) division leaves the skull through the I foramen rotundum. The third division passes through the foramen ovale in front of the motor root of the fifth nerve, Avith which it unites, as already described, to form the mandibular (inferior maxillary) division. The Gasserian ganglion I receives communications from the carotid plexus of the sympathetic, and is said to furnish some minute twigs to the dura mater. First or Ophthalmic Division of the Fifth Nerve ' The ophthalmic is the smallest of the three divisions of the fifth, and is entirely sensory in function. It passes forwards and inwards in the outer wall of the ' cavernous sinus, where it is placed below and external to the fourth nerve. Imme- diately behind the sphenoidal fissure it divides into three branches. These branches pass through the sphenoidal fissure, where they pierce the fibrous derivative of the dura mater which closes in the fissure. Two of them, the frontal and the lachrymal, enter the orbit above the external rectus muscle. The remaining branch, the nasal, passes between the two heads of that muscle. In its course in the outer wall of the cavernous sinus the ophthalmic division receives communications from the carotid plexus of the sympathetic, and gives ofi' a tentorial branch (nervus recurrens , rami primi, Luschka) which runs backwards for a short distance within the sheath of the fourth nerve, and is distributed between the layers of the tentorium cerebelli. It also gives communicating branches to the third, fourth, and sixth nerves. The : orbital muscles receive their sensory supply through these communications.706 THE NEBVOUS SYSTEM (1) The frontal nerve is the largest branch of the ophthahnic division. It passes forwards and upwards on the inner side of the third nerve, and enters the orbit immediately external to, and a little below, the fourth nerve. It passes forwards between the periosteum of the orbit and the levator palpebrjB superioris muscle, and, a little behind the middle of the orbit, divides into two branches, termed the supra()rl)ital and supratrochlear. (2) The supraorbital nerve leaves the orbit by passing through the supraorbital notch or foramen, where it gives twigs to the upper eyelid, and turns upwards on the frontal bone, accompanied by the supraorbital artery. It divides into two branches, an external and an internal. Both these branches divide into several twigs, which pass very obliquely through the anterior belly of the occipito-frontalis muscle, and supply the integument of the forehead and fore part of the scalp. The external branch, which is considerably larger than the internal, may be traced backwards nearly as far as the lambdoidal suture. (8) The supratrochlear nerve is directed forw^ards and inwards above the pulley of the superior oblique muscle. It communicates with the infratrochlear branch of the nasal nerve and turns upwards on the forehead, accompanied by the frontal Fig. 445.—Nerves of the Orbit, from the Outer Side.

It is much smaller than the supraorbital nerve, and it is distributed to a small area of integument around the glabella. It gives twigs to the inner part of the upper eyelid. (4) The lachrymal nerve is the smallest of the three branches of the ophthalmic division. It passes through the sphenoidal fissure external to and slightly below the frontal nerve, and is directed forwards and outwards along the upper border of the external rectus muscle to the lachrymal gland. Immediately behind the lachrymal gland it communicates with the temporal branch of the orbital nerve, forming a loop convex forwards ; from this loop and from the adjacent part of the trunk of the nerve a number of twigs pass into the gland substance. A small twig passes beyond the gland and is distributed to the integument and conjunctiva at the outer canthus of the eye. (5) The nasal nerve enters the orbit by passing forwards between the superior and inferior divisions of the third nerve, and takes an oblique course forwards and inwards to reach the inner wall of the orbit. In this course it passes between the optic nerve and the superior rectus muscle. It then passes through the anterior internal orbital canal, accompanied by the anterior ethmoidal vessels, crosses the cribriform plate of the ethmoid bone under cover of the dura mater, and entersMAXILLABY DIVISION OF THE FIFTH NEBVE 797 1 nasal fossa through a slit-like aperture at the side of the crista galli (the moidal fissure). It terminates within the nasal fossa by dividing into three inches : an internal, or septal; an external; and an anterior, or terminal. Branches.—The long root to the lenticular ganglion is given oft' at the sphe- dal fissure. It is a slender filament which passes forwards to join the upper 1 back xDart of the ganglion. The long ciliary nerves, usually two in number, 36 from the nasal trunk as the latter is crossing the optic nerve. They are acted forwards along the inner side of the optic nerve, and join the short ciliary •ves after they pierce the sclerotic (page 887). The infratrochlear nerve is given by the nasal just before the latter enters the anterior internal orbital canal. It ises forwards beneath the pulley of the superior oblique muscle, and supplies the Q and conjunctiva around the inner canthus of the eyes and the integument of upper part of the nose. It also supplies the lachrymal sac and caruncle. It Qmunicates with the supratrochlear nerve in front of (sometimes behind) the ley. The internal or septal branch of the nasal nerve runs downwards and forwards the upper and front part of the nasal septum. The external branch gives two or three twigs to the anterior extremities of the )erior and middle turbinated bones, and to the mucous membrane of the outer [1 of the nose. The terminal or anterior branch runs downwards in a groove on the inner face of the nasal bone. It pierces the wall of the nose between the nasal bone 1 the lateral cartilage, and supplies the integument of the lower part of the side the nose as far as the tip of that organ. Lenticular Ganglion The lenticular, ciliary, or ophthalmic ganglion is a small reddish-grey body )ut the size of a pin's head. It is quadrilateral in outline, and its outer and ler surfaces are slightly convex. It is placed between the optic nerve and the lernal rectus muscle, about a quarter of an inch in front of the sphenoidal !ure. Following the general rule applying to the sporadic ganglia which are mected with the fifth nerve, it is provided with three roots, a motor, a sensory, i a sympathetic. The motor or short root is derived from the branch of the do-motor to the inferior oblique muscle ; it enters the posterior inferior angle of ) ganglion. The sensory or long root is a branch of the nasal nerve ; it passes ing the outer side of the optic nerve, and enters the upper and back part of the iglion. The sympathetic root is derived from the cavernous plexus of the npathetic ; it may enter the back part of the ganglion in the form of fine twigs, t usually reaches the ganglion for the most part through the third and nasal ^-ves, being incorporated with the motor and sensory roots. From the anterior border of the ganglion about six short ciliary nerves arise ; ise subdivide and communicate with the long ciliary nerves, forming about tAventy Lwes which separate into a supero-external and an infero-internal group, and :round the optic nerve. The nerves pierce the sclerotic in a circle around the trance of the optic nerve into the eyeball, and pass forwards between the sclerotic d choroid coats of the eye. They supply nerves of ordinary sensation and trophic eves to the eyeball (derived from the nasal) ; the radiating fibres of the iris irived from the sympathetic) ; and the ciliary muscle and sphincter of the pupil jrived from the oculo-motor) (page 886). Second oe Maxillary Division of the Fifth Nerve The maxillary (superior maxillary) division of the fifth nerve is intermediate size betAveen the mandibular (inferior maxillary) and ophthalmic divisions, and,THE NEBVOUS SYSTEM 798 like the latter, it is entirely sensory in function. It proceeds forwards from the Gasserian ganglion for about one-third of an inch within the skull, and then passes through the foramen rotundum. It traverses the upper part of the spheno-maxillary fossa, and, inclining upwards, passes into the orbit through the spheno-maxillary fissure. It then courses forwards along the infraorbital groove, accompanied by the infraorbital artery, to the infraorbital canal, and passes through the canal to emerge at the infraorbital foramen, where it terminates, almost immediately, in three sets of branches, which proceed to the upper lip, the nose, and the lower eyelid. Branches.—The branches of the maxillary division may be classified into four sets, namely :—(1) Intracranial branches ; (2) branches which are given off in the spheno-maxillary fossa; (3) branches which arise from the portion of the nerve which is placed in the infraorbital canal; and (4) terminal branches. The first set (1) consists of one or two recurrent twigs to the dura mater, which form loops with the recurrent branch of the mandibular (inferior maxillary) division. The second set (2) comprises the orbital nerve, the spheno-palatine nerves, and the posterior superior dental nerves. (3) The middle and anterior superior dental nerves constitute the third set. (4) The terminal branches fall into three groups, which are termed labial, nasal, and palpebral branches. The orbital or temporo-malar nerve passes upwards and forwards through the spheno-maxillary fissure by which it enters the orbit, and terminates by dividing into two branches, temporal and malar. The temporal branch communicates with the lachrymal nerve, and then runs forwards through the periosteum on the outer wall of the orbit, and traverses the spheno-malar foramen. It enters the temporal fossa and pierces the deeper of the two lamellaB of the temporal fascia. It runs outwards for about a quarter of an inch in the fat between the two lamellae of the fascia, and pierces the superficial lamella about an inch above the superior border of the zygoma ; here it forms a well-marked communication with the temporal branch of the facial nerve, and then ramifies in the integument of799 MAXILLABY DIVISION OF THE FIFTH NEBVE the anterior temporal region. The malar branch (ramus subcutaneus malse) runs forwards in the loose fatty tissue of the orbit, and passes through the malar foramen. It pierces the orbicularis palpebrarum and supplies a small area of skin over the prominence of the cheek. It communicates with the malar branch of the facial nerve. The spheno-palatiue nerves are two stout twigs which pass downwards to Meckel's ganglion, of which they form the sensory roots ; most of the nerve- fibres pass on the inner side of the ganglion without traversing the ganglionic substance, but it is more convenient to trace these nerves with the branches of the ganglion. The posterior superior dental nerves, usually two in number, pass downwards and outwards through the pterygo-maxillary fissure. They furnish several twigs to the gums (nervuli gingivales) and adjacent part of the mucous membrane of the cheek. They then enter foramina in the maxilla, follow the curve of the alveolar arch through minute canals in the bone above the roots of the molar teeth, and end by communicating in a plexiform manner with the middle dental nerve. They give off minute branches to the mucous membrane of the antrum, and furnish three twigs to each of the molar teeth. These twigs enter the foramina at the tips of the fangs of the teeth and ramify in the pulp. The middle and anterior superior dental nerves are small branches which pass through canals in the substance of the maxilla to supply the incisor, canine, and bicuspid teeth and the corresponding regions of the gums. In the upper, and mare particularly in the lower, parts of these canals the nerves are surrounded on all sides by thick bone ; but in the middle part, where they are traversing the anterior wall of the antrum, they are surrounded by a mere shell of bone, which is not infrequently deficient on the deep surface, so that the nerves may lie in grooves in the anterior wall of the antrum between the bone and mucous membrane. In this situation the nerves furnish twigs to the antrum. The middle dental nerve enters a foramen at the posterior part of the infraorbital canal. It supplies the bicuspid teeth, and communicates with the anterior and posterior dental nerves. It may be wanting. The anterior dental nerve enters a canal close to the infraorbital foramen, and supplies the incisor and canine teeth. It gives off a nasal branch, which passes through a minute canal in the bone and enters the anterior part of the inferior meatus. Here it ramifies in the mucous membrane, and com- municates with the naso-palatine nerve from Meckel's ganglion. It communicates with the middle dental nerve. Two small ganglifomi enlargements are occasionally foimd on the plexiform arch formed by the dental nerves. One of these, the ganglion of Valentin, is situated above the root of the second bicuspid at the junction of the middle and posterior dental nerves. The other, the ganglion of Bochdalek, is placed on the junction of the anterior and middle dental nerves. The labial branches, usually four in number, are the largest of the three terminal divisions of the maxillary nerve. They pass downwards, spreading out as they descend, under cover of the levator labii superioris muscle, and ramify in the structures forming the upper lip, very large twigs being supplied to the mucous membrane. The nasal branches, three or four in number, are intermediate in size. They pass inwards under cover of the levator labii superioris alseque nasi, and supply the integument on the lateral aspect of the nose. The palpebral branches, the smallest of the terminal divisions of the nerve, pierce the origin of the levator labii superioris, and turn upwards around the lower border of the orbicularis palpebrarum. They are usually two in number, an external and an internal; they ramify in the integument of the lower eyelid.800 THE NEBVOUS SYSTE2I The terminal branches of the maxillary division communicate freely with the infraorbital branch of the facial, forming the infraorbital plexus. The plexus is placed under cover of the levator labii superioris. Meckel's Ganglion The spheno-palatine, nasal, or Meckel's ganglion is a small reddish-grey body which is situated in the spheno-maxillary fossa. It is triangular in form, flattened at the sides, and measures about one-fifth of an inch in its longest diameter. It is provided with three roots, a motor and a sympathetic, which reach it through the Vidian nerve, and a sensory root from the maxillary nerve. The latter root is in the form of two stout twigs, which are described as the spheno-palatine nerves. Roots.—The great superficial petrosal nerve is the motor root of the ganglion. It arises from the geniculate ganglion of the facial nerve within the aqueduct of Fallopius, and enters the cranial cavity by traversing the hiatus Fallopii. It then runs forwards and inwards in a groove in the petrous portion of the temporal bone, and, after passing under the Gasserian ganglion, enters an oblique canal in i the cartilage which occupies the foramen lacerum medium. Having reached the i posterior opening of the Vidian canal, it unites with the great deep petrosal nerve , to form the Vidian nerve. ! The great deep petrosal nerve is of a grey colour and is soft in consistence. It i arises from the carotid plexus of the sympathetic close to the intracranial termina- ! tion of the carotid canal, traverses a canal in the cartilage, Avhich occupies the i foramen lacerum medium, and joins the Vidian nerve. i The Vidian nerve runs forwards through the canal of the same name, accom- I panied by the Vidian artery, and enters the spheno-maxillary fossa, where it ends in the posterior angle of Meckel's ganglion. The majority of the facial fibres in the Vidian probably pass through the ganglion into the posterior palatine nerve to supply the levator palati and azygos uvul® muscles. While within the canal the Vidian nerve furnishes nasal twigs to the mucous membrane of the posterior part of the superior meatus of the nose. They may be regarded as superior nasal nerves, which, after leaving Meckel's ganglion, have become associated with the Vidian nerve for a part of their course. Branches.—The branches of Meckel's ganglion are classified into (1) ascending, to the orbit; (2) internal, to the mucous membrane of the nose; (3) descending, to the hard and soft palate ; and (4) posterior, to the pharynx. (1) Ascending branches.—The ascending or orbital branches are two or three small twigs which enter the orbit through the spheno-maxillary fissure, and pro- ceed within the periosteum to the inner wall of the orbit, where they pass through j the posterior internal orbital canal and through the foramina in the suture behind \ that canal to be distributed to the mucous membrane which lines the posterior ethmoidal cells and the sphenoidal sinus. (2) Internal branches.—The internal branches are derived in part from the inner side of the ganglion, but are also largely made up of fibres which pass from the spheno-palatine nerves without traversing the ganglionic substance. They are disposed in two sets, the superior nasal and the septal. The superior nasal are six or seven small twigs which pass through the spheno- palatine foramen, and are distributed to the mucous membrane covering the posterior parts of the superior and middle turbinated bones. They also furnish . twigs to the lining membrane of the posterior ethmoidal cells. The septal branches are two or three in number, and pass inwards through the spheno-palatine foramen. They cross the roof of the nasal fossa to reach the back part of the nasal septum, where the smaller twigs terminate. The largest nerve of the set, naso-palatine nerve, or nerve of Cotunnius, runs downwards and forwardsMANDIBULAR DIVISION OF THE FIFTH NEBVE 801 n a groove in the vomer between the periosteum and the mucous membrane to the interior palatine canal. Here it communicates with the nasal branch of the ,nterior superior dental nerve. The two naso-palatine nerves then pass through he foramina of Scarpa in the anterior palatine canal, the left nerve passing through he anterior of the two foramina. In the lower part of the anterior palatine canal he two nerves form a plexiform communication (formerly described as Cloquet's angiion) and furnish twigs to the anterior part of the hard palate. In this situa- ion they communicate with the anterior palatine nerves. (3) Descending branches.—The descending branches are the great or anterior, be posterior, and the external palatine nerves. Like the internal set of branches, tiey are in part derived from the ganglion and in part directly continuous with be spheno-palatine nerves. The great or anterior palatine nerve arises from the inferior angle of Meckel's angiion, and passes downwards through the posterior palatine canal, accompanied y the descending palatine artery. Emerging from the canal, it divides into two r three branches, which pass forwards in grooves in the hard palate and supply le glands and mucous membrane of the hard palate and the gums on the inner spect of the alveolar border of the upper jaw. During its course through the osterior palatine canal, the anterior palatine nerve gives off, usually two, inferior asal nerves. These nerves pass through small openings in the perpendicular late of the palate bone to supply the mucous membrane lining the back parts of le inferior turbinated bone, and of the middle and inferior meatus of the nose. The posterior or small palatine nerve passes downwards through the accessory alatine canal, and enters the soft palate, where it supplies the levator palati and zygos uvulae muscles. According to the researches of Horsley and Beevor the Leventh nerve supplies the levator palati; they state that the path by which the bres from this nerve reach the palate is probably through the upper branch of le pharyngeal plexus. The external palatine nerve, the smallest of the three, traverses the external alatine canal, and supplies twigs to the tonsil and to the adjacent part of the soft Eilate. (4) Posterior branch.—The Vidian is considered by some anatomists to be a ranch, in which case it would be classed here. We have, however, regarded it 3 the united motor and sympathetic root of the ganglion ; therefore, the pharyngeal canch only remains to be described. The pharyngeal branch is of small size, and passes backwards and somewhat iwards through the pterygo-palatine canal, accompanied by the pterygo-palatine rtery. It is distributed to the mucous membrane of the uppermost, part of the barynx, to the upper part of the posterior nares, to the opening of the Eustachian ibe, and to the lining of the sphenoidal sinus. Thikd ok Mandibular Division of the Fifth Nerve The mandibular (inferior maxillary) division is the largest of the three divisions I the fifth nerve, and is formed, as before stated, by the union of two distinct parts, amely, the entire motor ro.ot of the fifth nerve and a large bundle of fibres srived from the sensory root and traversing the Gasserian ganglion. These two arts pass through the foramen ovale and unite immediately outside the skull to form large trunk which terminates almost directly after its formation by dividing into smaller anterior and a larger posterior portion. The anterior portion is chiefly lotor, and the posterior division mainly sensory in function. Pre^dous to its ivision, two branches arise'from the trunk of the nerve, namely, the recurrent erve and the nerve to the internal pterygoid. (1) The recurrent nerve enters the cranium through the foramen spinosum, 3 FTHE NERVOUS SYSTEM 802 accompanying the middle meningeal artery, and divides into an anterior and a posterior branch. The anterior branch communicates with the meningeal branch of the maxillary division of the fifth nerve, furnishes filaments to the dura mater, and ends in the osseous substance of the great wing of the sphenoid. The posterior branch traverses the petro-squamous suture and ends in the lining membrane of the mastoid cells. (2) The nerve to the internal pterygoid passes under cover of a dense layer of fascia derived from an expansion of the ligamentum pterygo-spinosum, and enters the deep surface of the muscle. Near its commencement this nerve furnishes a motor root to the otic ganglion. The ANTERIOR PORTION of the mandibular division of the fifth nerve supplies the temporal, masseter, and external pterygoid muscles, and gives off a sensory branch.

OR INFERIOR \ DENTAL I NERVE the long buccal nerve ; the latter is accompanied, in the, first part of its course, by a small strand of motor fibres which leaves it to end in the anterior part of the temporal muscle. (1) The temporal nerves, usually two in number, pass between the bone and the upper border of the external pterygoid muscle, and turn upwards around the infra-temporal crest of the sphenoid bone to end in the deep surface of the temporal muscle. The posterior of these two nerves may arise in common with the masseteric nerve. (2) The masseteric nerve passes between the bone and the external pterygoid muscle external to the temporal nerves, and accompanies the masseteric artery through the sigmoid notch of the mandible to be distributed to the masseter. ItMANDIBULAB DIVISION OF THE FIFTH NEBVE 803 may be readily traced through the deeper fibres of the masseter nearly to the anterior border of that muscle. As it emerges from under cover of the external pterygoid it gives a twig to the temporo-mandibular articulation. (3) The nerve to the external pterygoid, after a course of about an eighth of an inch, divides into twigs which enter the deep surface of the two heads of the muscle. It is usually adherent at its origin to the long buccal nerve. (4) The long buccal nerve passes between the two heads of the external pterygoid muscle, and then turns forwards and emerges from under cover of the temporal and masseter muscles at the anterior border of the latter. It runs forwards and com- municates with the buccal branch of the facial, being in this situation covered only by the integument and fascia, and then pierces the buccinator muscle and ramifies in on the mucous membrane lining the cheek, its terminal twigs reaching as far forwards as the angle of the mouth. As it emerges from between the heads of the external pterygoid, it gives off a slender twig to the temporal muscle. The POSTERIOR PORTION of the mandibular division of the fifth nerve divides into three large branches; two of these, the auriculo-temporal and the lingual, are exclusively sensory ; the remaining branch, mandibular (inferior dental), contains a strand of motor fibres—the mylo-hyoid nerve. (1) The auriculo-temporal nerve arises by two roots, which usually embrace the . middle meningeal artery, and passes backwards and outwards between the internal lateral ligament of the temporo-mandibular articulation and the condyle of the mandible, closely embracing the capsular ligaments of the joint. It then ascends under cover of the parotid gland and traverses the glandular substance as it crosses the root of the zygoma. It accompanies the temporal artery, being placed under cover of and slightly behind that vessel, and terminates at the level of the tragus of the ear by dividing into auricular and temporal branches. As it passes through the parotid gland it communicates with the temporo-facial division of the facial nerve by two stout twigs, which may surround the temporal artery. The auriculo-temporal nerve receives communicating twigs from the otic ganglion, and gives off the articular branch, the nerves to the meatus, and the parotid branches, j It terminates in the anterior auricular and superficial temporal branches. {a) The communicating twigs from the otic ganglion join the nerve close to its [commencement in the form of several fine filaments. These filaments have been shown by physiological experiments to be derived from the i glosso-pharyngeal nerve through the lesser superficial petrosal. They rim for a short distance in the trunk of the aiu^iculo-temporal, and leave it under the name of parotid branches. They are the secreto-motor fibres of the parotid gland. , (h) The articular branch is supplied to the temporo-mandibular articulation as the auriculo-temporal nerve is passing between the capsular ligament and the parotid gland. 1 (c) The nerves to the meatus, two in number, pass between the bony and cartilaginous parts of the external auditory meatus and supply the skin lining the meatus. The upper of the two nerves furnishes a filament to the membrana tympani. The lower nerve gives twigs to the lobule of the ear. Occasionally only jthe upper nerve is present, the lower being replaced by a twig from the great auricular. (Henle.) {cT) The parotid branches are a variable number of fine twigs which arise either directly from the auriculo-temporal nerve or from the loops of communication jbetween it and the facial. As above mentioned, they supply the glandular substance. I (e) The anterior auricular branches, two in number, are supplied to the upper part of the pinna, and are chiefly distributed to the integument which covers the anterior aspect of the tragus and helix, I (/) The superficial temporal branches divide at acute angles and ramify over ithe integument which covers the temporal fascia. The largest twig accompanies ] * 3 F 2804 THE NERVOUS SYSTEM \ ! the posterior branch of the temporal artery. The anterior twigs communicate ^\'ith the temporal branches of the facial nerve. (2) The mandibular (inferior dental) nerve is the largest branch of the man- dibular division. It passes downwards under cover of the external pterygoid muscle to reach the interval between the ramus of the lower jaw and the spheno-mandibular ligament. In this situation it is placed on the outer side and somewhat behind the lingual nerve, and is connected to the latter by a transverse communicating branch. It then enters the mandibular canal accompanied by the mandibular artery, and lies at first behind and then below that vessel as it follows the course of the canal. Opposite the mental foramen it terminates by dividing into an incisive and a mental branch. The branches of the inferior dental nerve are the mylo-hyoid, the alveolar, the incisive, and the mental. (a) The mylo-hyoid is given off from the mandibular nerve immediately before the latter enters the dental canal. It runs downAvards and forwards in the mylo- hyoid groove of the mandible between the bone and the internal pterygoid muscle. In this course it is accompanied by the mylo-hyoid artery. It then runs forwards on the inferior surface of the mylo-hyoid muscle, and, after supplying that musclel with several twigs, it pierces the anterior belly of the digastric, in the substance oi= which it ends. j (b) The alveolar branches are a series of twigs which are given of!" within the mandibular canal to supply the molar and bicuspid teeth. They communicate with one another within the bone, forming a fine plexus. From this plexus twigs aid given off corresponding in number to the fangs of the teeth, and enter the minute apertures at the tips of the fangs to end in the pulp. Twigs are also given to the adjacent part of the gums (nervi gingivales). (c) The incisive branch, the smaller of the two terminal divisions, is continued] forwards and inwards in the dental canal, and supplies the canine and incisoi! teeth and the corresponding region of the gums. (d) The mental branch is a nerve of considerable size, which emerges through the: mental foramen. It communicates, near its exit, mth the supramandibular branch of the facial nerve, and then divides into three branches. The smallest branch turnj' downwards to supply the chin. The other two pass upwards, diverging as the} ascend, and divide into a number of twigs. The stoutest twigs ramify upon th( mucous membrane which lines the lower lip. Other twigs are distributed to th(' integument and fascia of the lip and chin. (3) The lingual (formerly called gustatory) nerve is slightly smaller than th(j mandibular nerve, and is placed at first in front of and close to the inner side oi' the latter under cover of the external pterygoid muscle. In this situation it w joined by the chorda tympani nerve ; the latter enters the lingual on its outer side the two nerves uniting at an acute angle. The lingual then escapes from undei cover of the external pterygoid muscle, and is connected to the mandibular nei-ve by a transverse communicating branch. It then passes between the ramus of th( mandible and the internal pterygoid muscle, and is continued forwards between th(' mucous membrane of the mouth and the mylo-hyoid muscle, and lies on the origiri of this muscle close to the bone. In this part of its course it can be easily dividec by an incision through the mucous membrane at the level of the second lowe: molar tooth. It then runs between the mylo-hyoid and hyo-glossus muscles crosses below Wharton's duct, and finally courses forwards by the side of th( tongue, so as to reach the tip of that organ. As it crosses the hyo-glossus muscl( it forms a curve with the convexity directed downwards, and is connected at th< most dependent part of the curve to the submandibular (submaxillary) ganglion, td which it furnishes sensory roots. Immediately beyond the ganglion it communi cates freely with the hypoglossal nerve, the communications forming several loops.j Branches.—(a) Communicating branches are given to the mandibular nerve, iiMANDIBULAB DIVISION OF THE FIFTH NEBVF 805 the submaxillary ganglion, and to the hypoglossal nerve. These have already been described. [b) Twigs are distributed to the interval between the tongue and gums, and ramify in the mucous membrane of the floor of the mouth. [c) A twig enters the sublingual gland. This twig conveys secreto-motor fibres from the chorda tympani to the gland. [d) The lingual branches are a series of twigs which are given off by the lingual nerve in the last stage of its course as it is passing forwards towards the tip of the tongue. They pierce the musculature at the side of the tongue, and proceed to the dorsum of the middle and anterior part of that organ, where they end in the filiform and fungiform papillae. Submandibular (Submaxillary) Ganglion The submandibular ganglion is a small reddish fusiform body which is placed j between the mylo-hyoid and hyo-giossus muscles at the outer side of Wharton's duct. It is connected to the lingual nerve by two communications, an anterior and a posterior. The posterior communication contains the motor and sensory roots of the ganglion. The anterior communication represents a branch passing from the ganglion to the lingual nerve. The motor root is derived from the chorda tympani. The sensory root is furnished by the lingual. The ganglion : also receives a sympathetic root from the plexus of the sympathetic which accom- panies the facial artery. Branches.—The ganglion furnishes five or six twigs to the submandibular !(submaxillary) gland, and gives minute twigs to Wharton's duct, which accompany the duct to its termination. From the fore part of the ganglion a branch passes to the lingual nerve, and through this branch fibres from the chorda tympani are conveyed to the sublingual gland and to the tongue. Sublingual ganglion.—A small ganglion has been described by Blandin and others on the twig to the sublingual gland. According to Bose, it is not constant. Otic Ganglion 1 The otic ganglion, or ganglion of Arnold, is a small reddish-grey body which placed immediately below the foramen ovale, internal to the mandibular division 3f the trigeminal nerve. The cartilage of the Eustachian tube is placed close to its inner side, and the middle meningeal artery is behind it. The ganglion is oval in Lorm, and compressed in its coronal diameter. It is greatest in its sagittal diameter, vhich is about four millimetres. J Roots.—The mandibular division of the trigeminal nerve supplies one or more 'oots to the otic ganglion; these roots probably contain both sensory and motor fibres, and are associated with the nerve to the internal pterygoid. The lesser iuperficial petrosal nerve enters the ganglion, being a motor (or, more properly, liferent) root. The ganglion receives a sympathetic root from the plexus which lurrounds the middle meningeal artery. I Branches.—The otic ganglion furnishes muscular twigs to the tensor palati and :ensor tympani; these twigs', especially the former, pass for the most part from the iQandibular division of the fifth nerve to the muscles without interruption in the ^lerve-cells of the ganglion. It also gives communicating branches to the auriculo- emporal nerve and to the chorda tympani. ' SIXTH OE ABDUCENT NERVE The sixth or abducent nerve arises from an approximately spherical cluster of l^erve-cells which is placed between the grey matter of the floor of the fourth806 THE NEBVOUS SYSTEM ventricle and the formatio reticularis. This nucleus is situated near the middle line, a little in front of the striae acusticas, and corresponds to the eminentia teres It is on a line with the nuclei of the third and fourth nerves. The fibres whicl arise from this nucleus plunge forwards through the substance of the pons, anc emerge at the lower border of the latter structure (superficial origin). Some of th( fibres pass through the pyramidal body ; others pass out in the interval betweer the latter and the olivary body. The sixth nerve was formerly described as giving fibres of origin to the facial, but Guddei and Gowers have shown that this is not the case. A remarkable strand of fibres passes from the abdncens nucleus to the posterior longitudinal bundle. It runsbrainwards, forming the inner border of the bundle, and decussates below the corpora quadrigemina with iti fellow of the opposite side; it then joins the third nerve, and passes eventually into th( internal rectus muscle. Thus the eyes can be directed to the right or left, as the case ma^ be, by the action of a single nucleus, e.g. in turning the eyes to the right, the right external rectus and the left internal rectus are used, and these are both supplied by the right abducensj nucleus. | The sixth nerve pierces the dura mater at a point a little above the junction the basilar process of the occipital bone with the sphenoid. It runs upwards or the body of the sphenoid, and turns forwards in the interval between the apex c the petrous portion of the temporal bone and the posterior clinoid process of tb sphenoid, passing in this situation under cover of a ligament which connects thJ osseous prominences above mentioned. It enters the floor of the cavernous sinus and passes on to the outer side of the internal carotid artery. In this situation i receives several communications from the carotid plexus of the sympathetic. I enters the orbit through the sphenoidal fissure, passing between the inferior divisioi of the third nerve and the ophthalmic vein. It passes between the two heads o the external rectus muscle, and ends by piercing the ocular surface of that musckj SEVENTH OE FACIAL NEEVE The seventh or facial nerve is formed by two distinct parts—the main trunk or facial nerve proper, and an accessory portion, the pars intermedia of Wrisberg The facial nerve proper arises from an elongated nucleus which is deeply placed i] the reticular formation below the floor of the fourth ventricle. This nucleu commences at the level of the striae acusticae, and extends brainwards for abou four millimetres. The fibres which arise from it pursue a remarkably tortuou; course within the substance of the pons. At first they pass backwards and inwardj so as to approach the ependyma of the floor of the fourth ventricle close to thi sulcus longitudinalis medianus (crus of origin). They then run upwards and for^ wards in a compact bundle (fasciculus teres, or ascending crus), which produce an elevation (eminentia teres) on the floor of the fourth ventricle immediatebl external to the median fissure. The bundle of fibres then bends, and is directe(i at right angles to its former course; it arches outwards over the nucleus of thi, sixth nerve, and passes forwards, outwards, and downwards (issuing crus). In thij part of its course it passes to the outer side of its own nucleus, between the latte| and the ascending root of the fifth nerve. Finally it emerges at the lower border o! the pons in the interval between the olivary and restiform body (superficial origin)! From the above description, it will be seen that the facial nerve embraces th(i nucleus of the abducens ; the term genu nervi facialis is applied to the nerve ir this part of its course. The pars intermedia of Wrisberg arises from the extreme upper (proximal) enc| of the sensory nucleus of the glosso-pharyngeal nerve (Duval). Its fibres pasi| obliquely through the substance of the pons, and emerge at the lower border of thfj last-named structure immediately external to the facial nerve, between the latte:'FACIAL NEBVE 807 and the auditory nerve (superficial origin). From thence the'nerve passes, in the form of a small compact bundle, and enters the internal auditory meatus. In this situation it lies on the upper surface of the auditory nerve, while the facial is j placed above it. It joins the facial nerve at the commencement of the geniculate gangUon. This nerve is regarded as an aberrant fasciculus of the glosso-pharyngeal nerve, and additional support is given to this view by the fact that it also receives fibres from the j- funiculus solitarius (Testnt). The chorda tympani is usually regarded as the continuation ' of this nerve, and thus the anterior part of the tongue receives fibres from the glosso- pharyngeal through the chorda tympani, while the posterior part of the organ is supplied j directly. (See Glosso-pharyngeal Nerve.) i At its superficial origin the facial nerve is placed immediately internal to the I auditory nerve, the pars intermedia of Wrisberg intervening between them. As the facial nerve enters the internal auditory meatus, it is placed above the auditory nerve. It then parts company with the auditory nerve by entering the aqueduct of Fallopius. While traversing the aqueduct, it necessarily follows the windings of that canal. It passes at first outwards and forwards through the bone above Fig. 448.—Diagrammatic Lateral View of the Origin of the Facial Nerve. (Krause.) SUPERIOR OLIVE ASCENDING CRUS NUCLEUS OF ABDUCENS CRUS OF ORIGIN NUCLEUS OF FACIAL MEDULLA and between the cochlea and the vestibule. It then makes a sharp bend, and runs backwards and slightly downwards, being separated from the tympanum in this part of its course only by a very thin scale of bone and by the mucous membrane lining the cavity. Lastly, it runs directly downwards, and emerges at the stylo- mastoid foramen. The portion of the nerve corresponding to the first bend is considerably thickened, and contains some nerve-cells ; it is called the geniculate ganglion. The ganglionic substance forms a little conical cap on the bend of the nerve, the apex of the cone being directed towards the hiatus Fallopii. After its emergence from the stylo-mastoid foramen, the facial nerve runs downwards and forwards within the substance of the parotid gland, and terminates by dividing into two divisions—an upper or temporo-facial, and a lower or cervico- facial. The branches of the facial nerve may be classified into three sets:—(1) Branches given off within the aqueduct of Fallopius ; (2) branches from the extracranial portion of the nerve before its terminal division ; (3) branches of the temporo-facial and cervico-facial divisions. (1) Six branches are given off within the aqueduct: viz. three from the genicu- late ganglion, the great, the lesser, and the external superficial petrosal nerves ; and three from the facial nerve in the descending part of its course—viz. the nerve to the stapedius, the chorda tympani, and a communicating twig to the pneumo- gastric.808 THE NERVOUS SYSTEM (a) The great superficial petrosal nerve receives a communicating filament from the tympanic branch of the glosso-pharyngeal, and leaves the aqueduct by passing through the hiatus Fallopii. It runs forwards and inwards in a groove on the petrous portion of the temporal bone under cover of the dura mater. It passes beneath the Gasserian ganglion, and pierces obliquely the cartilaginous substance which occupies the foramen lacerum medium; here it is joined by the great deep petrosal nerve, and forms, with the latter, the Vidian nerve as already described. (h) The lesser superficial petrosal nerve arises from the geniculate ganglion external to the preceding. It receives a relatively large communication from the tympanic branch of the glosso-pharyngeal. This communication is often considered to be the main root of the nerve (Schwalbe and others). It leaves the aqueduct through a canal which is placed external to the hiatus Fallopii, and passes f orAvards for a short distance, lying in a groove in the bone, under cover of the dura mater. It escapes from the cranium through a small foramen situated between the fora- men ovale and the foramen spinosum (canalis innominatus), and enters the etic ganglion. Occasionally it leaves the skull by traversing the suture between the great wing of the sphenoid and the petrous portion of the temporal bone. (c) The external superficial petrosal is the smallest of the three petrosal nerves. It passes through a minute canal in the temporal bone immediately external to the point of emergence of the lesser superficial nerve. It then runs forwards, under cover of the dura mater, and joins the plexus of the sympathetic on the middle meningeal artery close to the foramen spinosum. (d) The nerve to the stapedius is a minute twig which is given off by the facial nerve immediately below the second bend which the. nerve forms within the aque- duct. It passes through a small canal leading from the aqueduct to the interior of the pyramid, and ends in the muscular substance of the stapedius. (e) The chorda tympani arises from the facial nerve about five millimetres above the stylo-mastoid foramen. It pursues a slightly recurrent course, upwards and forwards, through the iter chords posterius, and thus enters the tympanum. It crosses the membrana tympani at the junction of the upper and middle thirds of that membrane. In this part of its course it runs forwards between the fibrous and mucous layers of the membrana tympani, passing on the inner side of the manu- brium of the malleus. It leaves the tympanum by passing through the iter chordaB anterius, or canal of Buguier, and, after communicating with the otic ganglion, passes forwards, under cover of the external pterygoid muscle, to gain the outer side of the lingual nerve, which it joins at an acute angle. From thence it runs in the sheath of the lingual nerve, a portion of its fibres, as already described (see Lingual Nebve), passing into the submandibular ganglion. Other fibres reach the sublingual gland, and the dorsum of the tongue. (/) The communicating twig to the pneumogastric is given off at the same level as the chorda tympani, and joins the auricular branch of the pneumogastric while the latter is traversing the substance of the temporal bone. (2) The branches which arise from the facial nerve between the stylo-mastoid foramen and the terminal bifurcation are the posterior auricular and the nerves to the posterior belly of the digastric and to the stylo-hyoid muscles. A lingual branch is also described. (a) The posterior auricular nerve is the first branch of the extracranial portion of the facial. It passes between the parotid gland and the anterior border of the sterno-mastoid muscle, and runs upwards in the deep interval between the external auditory meatus and the mastoid process. In this situation it communicates with the auricular branch of the pneumogastric. It supplies the retrahens aurem, and sends a slender twig upwards to the attoUens aurem, and ends in a long slender branch, which passes backwards to supply the posterior belly of the occipito- fro italis.FACIAL NEBVE 809 {h) The nerve to the posterior belly of the digastric arises from the facial nerve close to the stjlo-mastoid foramen, and enters the digastric near the centre of that muscle, or sometimes near its origin. (c) The nerve to the stylo-hyoid arises at the same level as the preceding nerve, the two nerves sometimes forming a common trunk. It ends in the upper part of the muscle for which it is destined. The lingual branch is remarkable for its long course. It arises close to the two small muscular nerves above described. It passes on the outer side of the stylo-pharyngeus Fig. 449.—Superficial Distribution of the Facial and other Nerves of THE Head. (After Hirschfeld and Leveille.)

In this situation it is joined by filaments from the glosso-pharyngeal. It then passes between the palato-glossus muscle and the tonsil, and reaches the base of the tongue, where it ends in filaments to the mucous membrane and in twigs to the palato-glossus and stylo-glossus mnscles. (Testut.) (3) Six branches are given off from the two terminal divisions of the facial nerve. These branches traverse the substance of^the parotid gland, and emerge at its margin. At their emergence they range from a point on the zygoma, a little in front of the spot where the temporal artery crosses the bone, to the angle of the810 THE NEBVOUS SYSTEM lower jaw. These branches proceed forwards over the face and front of the neck, and by frequently communicating with one another form a great expanded plexus which is called the pes anserinus. Taken in order from above downwards, the temporo-facial division gives off the following branches : temporal, malar, and infraorbital. The cervico-facial division divides into buccal, supramandibular and inframandibular branches. The TEMPORO-FACIAL DIVISION of the facial nerve runs obliquely upwards and forwards through the substance of the parotid gland, crosses the external carotid artery and the temporo-maxillary vein on the superficial aspect of those vessels, and terminates, as above described, in three branches. In this course it receives communications from the auriculo-temporal nerve, as mentioned in the description of the fifth nerve. {a) The temporal branch passes upwards through the parotid gland, and emerges at the upper border of the gland at a point a little in front of the temporal artery. It divides into several branches, which communicate with one another and with the malar branch. It also communicates with the temporal branch of the orbital, and with the supraorbital nerve. Its largest branches are distributed to the upper part of the orbicularis palpebrarum, and to the anterior belly of the occipito- frontalis. It also supplies the attrahens aurem, the corrugator supercilii, and, occasionally, the attollens aurem. The fibres which run in the facial nerve to end in the orbicularis palpebrarum and frontalis muscles are probably derived from the oculo-motor nucleus of the same side, and pass downwards in the posterior longitudinal bundle to join the genu nervi facialis. (Mendel.) {b) The malar branch is a smaller nerve than the preceding. It is directed upwards and forwards to reach the most prominent part of the malar bone ; it supplies the lower part of the orbicularis palpebrarum. It also gives twigs to both eyelids; it communicates with the malar branch of the orbital, with the supra- orbital and lachrymal branches of the ophthalmic, with the palpebral twigs derived from the superior maxillary division of the fifth, and with the temporal and infraorbital branches of the facial. (c) The infraorbital is the largest of the nerves which enter into the pes anserinus. It escapes from the parotid gland above Stenson's duct, and divides into several ; branches. These branches communicate freely with one another, and pass inwards on the deep surface of the zygomatici and the levator labii superioris. Under cover of the latter muscle they communicate with the terminal branches of the superior maxillary division of the fifth nerve, forming the infraorbital plexus; from thence twigs extend to the nose, and communicate with the nasal branch of the ophthalmic nerve. The infraorbital branch also forms communications with other branches of the facial, namely with the malar above and with the buccal below. It supplies the zygomatici, the levator labii superioris, the levator labii superioris alasque nasi, the levator anguli oris, the pyramidalis nasi, the compressor nasi, and the depressor alee nasi. It also gives twigs to the buccinator and to the orbicularis oris. The CERVICO-FACIAL DIVISION of the facial nerve is directed forwards and down- wards, through the parotid gland, and, like the temporo-facial division, it crosses on the outer side of the external carotid artery. As it traverses the glandular sub- stance, it communicates with the facial branches of the great auricular nerve. As above described, it terminates in three branches : the buccal, the supramandibular, and the inframandibular. (a) The buccal branch is of small size, and is the highest of the three branches of the cervico-facial division. It is placed between the infraorbital and supra- mandibular branches of the facial, and communicates with both these branches. It emerges from the parotid gland below Stenson's duct, and crosses the masseter muscle. In front of the anterior border of the masseter, it communicates with theFACIAL NEBVE—AUDITOBY NEBVE 811 long buccal branch of the fifth, and then breaks into twigs, which end in the buccinator and orbicularis oris. [b) The supramandibular branch, after escaping from the parotid gland, crosses the lower part of the masseter muscle, a little way above the angle of the lower jaw, and passes forwards, under cover of the risorius and the depressors of the lower lip, as far as the middle line. It communicates with the buccal and inframandibular branches of the facial, and with the mental branch of the man- dibular nerve. It supplies the risorius, the depressor anguli oris, the depressor labii inferioris, and the levator menti. (c) The inframandibular branch becomes superficial at the lower margin of the parotid gland, and runs obliquely downwards and forwards, under cover of the platysma, across the side and front of the neck. It forms one or more communi- cating loops, near its commencement, with the great auricular nerve, and longer loops, lower down, with the superficial cervical nerve. It supplies the platysma myoides. EIGHTH OE AUDITOEY NERVE The auditory nerve appears at the lower border of the pons (superficial origin), immediately external to the facial nerve. It arises by two roots, a lateral and a mesial. These roots embrace the restiform body, the lateral root being external, and the mesial root internal to that body (fig.-450). It is very generally agreed that the lateral root (superficial, dorsal, inferior, or posterior root) is continuous with the cochlear nerve, and is the true nerve of hearing ; while the mesial root (deep, ventral, superior, or anterior root) is continued into the vestibular nerve, and is concerned in the maintenance of equilibrium. The nuclei in connection with these roots will be first described. The small-celled or chief nucleus is superficially placed in the floor of the fourth ventricle. It is largest in the region of the stri^ medullares, in which situation it appears in coronal sections as a triangular grey mass, which reaches the middle line. It extends forwards from this ;'point as far as the abducens nucleus and backwards for about an equal distance. Both in front and behindTHE NEBVOUS SYSTEM 812 it recedes from the middle line. The nerve-cells forming this nucleus are all of small size. The large-celled or Deiter's nucleus is placed close to the inner side of the restiform body. It is about the same length as the small-celled nucleus, but occupies a position deeper and further forwards than the latter. The cells of this nucleus are of large size, and are most numerous at the anterior part. The accessory nucleus is a group of cells chiefly contained within the lateral root, but also occupying the angular interspace between the lateral and the mesial roots. It presents marked affinities to a spinal nerve-ganglion, particularly in the character of the nerve-cells in its anterior (superior) part. The nerve-cells in the tuberculum acusticum are also connected with the auditory nerve. The so-called nucleus funiculi teretis (a group of cells which is placed on the mesial side of the chief nucleus), and the superior olive may also be mentioned as parts of the auditory apparatus. Lateral root.—The lateral root arises chiefly from the cells of the accessory nucleus, but a certain number of fibres are believed to pass by that nucleus without interruption. Both sets of fibres pass in a tolerably compact bundle around the outer side of the restiform body. A certain number take origin in the cells of the tuberculum acusticum, the others cross the floor of the fourth ventricle, as stride medullares, and, having crossed the middle line, take origin partly in the so-called nucleus funiculi teretis of the opposite side, and pass partly into the conductor sonorus. The origin of the conductor sonorus is unknown; its course has been noticed in the description of the fourth ventricle (page 758). Fibres pass inwards from the accessory nucleus, and traverse the substance of the pons in a transverse direction to reach the superior olive of the same and of the opposite side. In many animals, owing to the relatively feeble development of the pons, these fibres appear on the ventral surface of the brain and occupy a quadrilateral area on each side, external to the pyramidal body, and in front of (above) the inferior olive. For this reason these fibres are collectively called the corpus trapezoides. Mesial root.—In coronal sections, taken through the medulla at a point corresponding to the centre of the medullary portion by the floor of the fourth ventricle, the cross-section of a bundle of fibres is seen on the inner side of the nucleus cuneatus; this is the ascending root of the auditory nerve. The ascending root is continued into the region of Deiter's nucleus, and is here joined by fibres from the large cells of Deiter's nucleus and by others from the chief nucleus. The fibres derived from these several sources pass ventrally between the restiform body and the ascending root of the trigeminal nerve, and form the mesial root. Many other origins of the auditory nerve have been described, the cerebellar root being, perhaps, the most important of these. The chief nucleus receives fibres which are derived from the flocculus of the opposite side (Edinger). Fibres from the nucleus fastigii of the opposite side reach the cells of Deiter's nucleus, and are probably continued into the mesial root. There appears to be but little doubt that the superior temporal convolution is the cortical centre for hearing (Ferrier). According to Obersteiner, the probable links between the nerves of hearing and the cortical acoustic field are as follow: lateral root, accessory nucleus, superior olive, inferior fillet, posterior quadrigeminal body, internal geniculate body, temporal lobe. From its superficial origin, the auditory nerve proceeds upwards, outwards, and forwards, winding round the middle cerebellar peduncle, and enters the internal auditory meatus. Near the end of that bony canal it divides into an anterior or cochlear, and a posterior or vestibular division. In its course through the meatus, it is accompanied by the facial nerve, the pars intermedia, and the internal audi- tory artery. These structures are all contained in a common sheath of arachnoid.813 GLOSSO-PHABYNGEAL NEBVE Within the meatus the auditory nerve becomes flattened, and is curved in such a manner as to form a half-cyhnder, open above. The pars intermedia hes in the concavity of this half-cyhnder, and above this is the facial nerve, the three nerves being connected by a lax connective tissue. This connective tissue has often been mistaken for nervous communications. (Testut.) The cochlear nerve gives twigs to the saccule and to the ampulla of the posterior semicircular canal, and then divides into a number of filaments, which enter the lamina cribrosa. The vestibular nerve divides into twigs for the utricle and for the ampullse of the superior and external semicircular canals. NINTH OR GLOSSO-PHARYNGEAL NERVE The glosso-pharyng'eal nerve is made up of fibres derived from three different sources. Two of these sets of fibres arise from distinct groups of cells, and represent the motor part of the nerve and the portion devoted to the special sense of taste. The third set of fibres takes the form of an ascending root (funiculus sohtarius), the round cross-section of which forms a conspicuous object in sections through the lower part of the medulla. The fibres which form this ascending (or sensory) root have not as yet been distinctly traced to cells. The fibres from these three sources emerge in the form of several fasciculi (superficial origin) in the groove between the olivary and restiform bodies, near the lower border of the pons, in series with the roots of the vagus nerve. The two principal nuclei are called the small-celled and the large-celled nuclei, and are absolutely continuous with the nuclei of the vagus and of the accessory part of the spinal accessory nerve. The small-celled nucleus (sensory, or accessorio-vago-glosso-pharyngeal nucleus) corresponds for the most part to the ala cinerea in the floor of the fourth ventricle. In this situation it lies immediately external to the chief nucleus of the hypo- glossal nerve. Higher up, it recedes from the middle line, and is more deeply placed, being covered by the chief nucleus of the auditory nerve. It is from this deeper (upper) part that the glosso-pharyngeal fibres take origin and these fibres are regarded as the conductors of the special sense of taste. The large-ceiled nucleus (motor nucleus, nucleus ambiguus) contains cells resembling the motor cells in the anterior horn of the spinal cord, and is regarded as a portion of the head of that horn which has been amputated from the neck by the decussation of the pyramids. It is more deeply placed than the small-celled nucleus. It is placed between the nucleus lateralis and external accessory olive, and somewhat dor sally to both. It extends in a sagittal direction from the level of the striae medullares downwards to a point a little below the fourth ventricle. From the upper end of this nucleus fibres pass dorsally and then arch outwards to join the fibres derived from the small-celled nucleus. Both sets of fibres then proceed forwards and outwards, piercing the ascending root of the trigeminal, and emerge at the ventral margin of the restiform body. The ascending root (funiculus solitarius) commences at a point immediately above the level of the decussation of the pyramids. It passes upwards in the form of a sharply circumscribed round bundle, gaining in strength as it ascends. It is placed at first close to the outer side of the nucleus of the hypoglossal nerve ; higher up it is related to the outer side of the small-celled (accessorio-vago-giosso- pharyngeal) nucleus, and lies dorsally to the roots of the vagus between the latter and the ascending root of the auditory. Finally, at the level of the striae medullares, it bends at right angles to its former course, and runs forwards and outwards, traversing the substantia gelatinosa and the ascending root of the trigeminal to join814 THE NERVOUS SYSTEM the rest of the giosso-pharyngeal nerve, forming the uppermost (most proxnnal) of the series of fascicnh which has been described as the superficial origin of that nerve. The origin of the ascending root is not known with certainty ; but it is probably derived from the posterior horn. From its superficial origin the giosso-pharyngeal nerve proceeds outwards and slightly forwards, below and in front of the flocculus, to reach the middle compart- ment of the jugular foramen, which it traverses in common with the vagus and spinal accessory nerves. As it passes through the foramen it is placed in front of, and a little internal to, the vagus and spinal accessory nerves, but occupies a separate compartment in the dura mater, and is lodged in a groove on the lower border of the petrous portion of the temporal bone. Having emerged at the base of the skull, it lies at first in contact with the vagus, but leaves the latter almost immediately and passes forwards and inwards between the internal jugular vein and the internal carotid artery and curves round the outer side of the latter vessel. In this part of its course it is placed under cover of the stylo-pharyngeus muscle. It then winds round the lower border of that muscle, and finally passes upwards in front of it and gains the deep surface of the hyo-glossus, where it breaks up into its terminal or lingual branches. In the course above described, the giosso-pharyngeal describes a curve with the convexity directed downwards and backwards. In its course through the jugular foramen, two ganglia are formed upon the trunk of the nerve, the lower of these bodies (petrous ganglion) is the more constant, the upper or jugular ganglion being generally regarded as a segmentation from the petrous ganglion. The two ganglia taken together are generally assumed to be equivalent to the ganglion on the posterior root of a spinal nerve. The jugular ganglion (ganglion of Ehrenritter) is a small greyish body which involves only the back part of the nerve. It is lodged in the upper part of the groove in the temporal bone through which the nerve passes. This ganglion does not give off any branches. The petrous ganglion (ganglion of Andersch) is an ovoid greyish body which probably involves all the fibres of the nerve. Its long axis coincides with the axis of the nerve, and measures two or three millimetres. It is placed in the lower part of the jugular fossa. The nerve of Jacobson and some communicating branches arise from this ganglion. Branches.—The following branches are given off by the giosso-pharyngeal nerve:—(1) meningeal; (2) tympanic; (3) communicating; (4) muscular ; (5) pharyngeal; (6) tonsillar ; and (7) lingual. (1) The meningeal branches are slender twigs which are given off within the cranium, and are distributed to the pia mater and arachnoid. (Bochdalek.) (2) The tympanic branch, or nerve of Jacobson, is a small twig which arises from the petrous ganglion. It enters a minute canal (the tympanic canaliculus), which commences below on the ridge between the jugular fossa and the inferior opening of the carotid canal, and ends above, in the tympanic cavity, immediately below the promontory. The nerve, having traversed this canal, ramifies on the promontory, grooving the bone, and forms the tympanic plexus. The following branches arise from the nerve within the tympanum : (a) a communicating twig to the great superficial petrosal; (b) a twig to the lesser superficial petrosal, which is considered by some anatomists to be the main root of the nerve ; (c) a twig to the mucous membrane surrounding the fenestra ovalis ; {d) a twig to the fenestra rotunda ; (e) a twig to the lining membrane of the Eustachian tube ; (/) a twig which passes through the carotico-tympanic canal to join the carotid plexus of the sympathetic. (3) The communicating branches arise from the petrous ganglion. One joins the superior cervical ganglion of the sympathetic ; another forms a loop with the auricular branch of the vagus ; while a third, less constant than the other two, joinsPNEUMOGASTBIG NEBVE 815 the ganglion of the root of the vagus. Immediately below the petrous ganglion a twig is given off which joins the lingual branch of the facial as above described (page 809). (4) The muscular branch is distributed to the stylo-pharyngeus muscle. This branch receives a communication from the facial. According to Testut, the glosso-pharyngeal gives off carotid branches which join the carotid plexus of the sympathetic and also muscular twigs to the digastric, stylo-hj^oid, and stylo-glossus muscles. (5) The pharyngeal branches may be two or three in number, and arise from the nerve a short distance below the petrous ganglion. The principal and most constant of these nerves passes on the outer side of the internal carotid artery, and after a very short independent course joins the pharyngeal branch of the vagus to form the pharyngeal plexus with that nerve, and with branches of the superior cervical ganglion. (6) The tonsillar branches are a number of small twigs which arise under cover of the hyo-glossus muscle; these proceed to the tonsil, around which they form a plexus. From this plexus fine twigs proceed to the pillars of the fauces and to the soft palate. (7) The lingual branches arise from the termination of the nerve and proceed to the dorsum of the tongue, where they are chiefly distributed to the circumvallate papillae. Some small twigs pass backwards to the follicular glands of the tongue, and to the anterior surface of its epiglottis. Other twigs are distributed around the foramen c^cum, where they communicate with the corresponding twigs of the opposite side. TENTH OK PNEUMOGASTBIG NEEVE The pneumogastric or vagus nerve is the longest of the cranial nerves. It is remarkable for its extensive distribution, for the asymmetry which it shows in certain parts of its course and distribution, and for the almost vertical course which it pursues. It supplies, as its name implies, the lungs and the stomach, but also furnishes branches to the external ear, the pharynx, larynx, oesophagus, trachea, heart, and abdominal viscera. The pneumogastric nerve arises in the medulla in a manner nearly identical with the glosso-pharyngeal nerve, the roots of the former nerve being a serial continua- tion of the roots of the latter. Thus we find that sensory roots arise from the small-celled nucleus (in a position corresponding to the ala cinerea in the floor of the fourth ventricle), and motor roots arise from the nucleus ambiguus. The latter arch round to join the sensory roots. The vagus is also said to receive a few fine filaments from the funiculus solitarius. The roots from these different sources unite and pass forwards and outwards to emerge (superficial origin) in the form of from ten to fifteen fasciculi, between the restiform body and the lateral column of the medulla. This row of fasciculi is in series above with the glosso-pharyngeal roots, and below with the bulbar roots of the spinal accessory. The roots of these three nerves cannot be distinguished from one another either at their superficial origin, or at the points where they spring from their nuclei in the medulla, unless the connection of the roots with their respective trunks has been preserved. From its superficial origin the vagus nerve proceeds outwards and slightly upwards and forwards beneath the flocculus to reach the jugular foramen. It traverses the middle compartment of the foramen accompanied by the spinal accessory and glosso-pharyngeal nerves The former nerve occupies the same compartment in the dura^mater as the vagus. The glosso-pharyngeal is provided with a separate sheath, and is in front of and somewhat internal to the other two816 THE NEBVOUS SYSTEM nerves. As the vagus traverses the jugular foramen it bends at a right angle to its former course, and proceeds vertically downwards.

In the upperPNEUMOGASTBIG NEBVE 817 part of the neck it is placed between and on a plane posterior to the internal jugular vein and the internal carotid artery. In the lower part of the neck it occupies a similar position in regard to the internal jugular vein and common carotid artery, the vein being in front and external, and the artery in front and internal to the nerve. The three structures are enclosed in a common sheath derived from the deep cervical fascia. In their course through the thorax the nerves of the left and right sides differ in some respects from each other. The right vagus nerve passes in front of the first stage of the subclavian artery between the latter and the right innominate vein, and then, inclining backwards^ runs downwards on the side of the trachea to reach the posterior aspect of the right bronchus. Behind the bronchus it expands into a great, flat, plexiform band, from which the posterior pulmonary plexus proceeds. The vagus then inclines inwards in the form of two cords, and communicates with the pneumogastric of the opposite side both in front and behind the oesophagus to form the oesophageal plexus (plexus- gulae). Having interchanged a considerable number of fibres with the other nerve^ the right vagus then descends (having regained the form of one nerve) behind the oesophagus through the oesophageal opening of the diaphragm, and spreads out on the posterior surface of the stomach. The left vagus nerve enters the thorax behind the left common carotid artery between the latter and the left subclavian artery. As it approaches the arch of the aorta it bends suddenly backwards, and crosses the root of the subclavian artery on the left side of that vessel, immediately under cover of the pleura. It then crosses the left side (in front) of the transverse part of the arch of the aorta, and bends backwards to reach the posterior aspect of the left bronchus, where it spreads out in a similar manner to the nerve of the right side. It then descends on the oesophagus, entering into the plexus guise, and on reaching the diaphragm passes in the form of a single trunk in front of the oesophagus into the abdominal cavity, and spreads out on the anterior surface of the stomach. At the base of the skull the vagus presents two ganglia : an upper ganglion, or ganglion of the root; and a lower, or ganglion of the trunk. The ganglion of the root is placed within the jugular foramen opposite the jugular ganglion of the glosso-pharyngeal. It is an irregular greyish swelling of from four to six millimetres in length. It is usually regarded as corresponding to a spinal ganglion. The ganglion of the trunk, situated a little below the preceding, is a fusiform enlargement of the nerve about twenty millimetres in length, and four to five milli- metres in transverse diameter at its thickest part. The hypoglossal nerve is firmly attached to it by connective tissue and encloses it in a spiral turn, being placed at first to the inner side of the vagus, then passing behind, then to its outer side, and finally crossing it in front. The superior cervical ganglion of the sympathetic is behind and a little external to the vagus ; the glosso-pharyngeal is in front of it. The accessory ^ portion of the spinal accessory nerve joins the ganglion of the trunk ; some of the- i fibres running over the ganglion into the pharyngeal and superior laryngeal branches. Branches.—The branches of the vagus may be classified into (1) communicating : branches; and (2) branches of distribution. I (1) Communicating branches.—The vagus communicates with the following :' nerves : —(«) the glosso-pharyngeal to the auricular branch of the pneumogastric ; ih) the spinal accessory; (c) the hypoglossal; {d) the sympathetic; and (c) the upper two spinal nerves. [a) Besides the communicating branch to the vagus just referred to, a communi- cating twig is given off from the pneumogastric, close to the base of the skull,, which joins the glosso-pharyngeal nerve immediately below the petrous ganglion. {h) The spinal accessory gives some fine filaments to the ganglion of the root of the vagus within the jugular foramen. Lower down, the remainder of the accessory portion joins the ganglion of the root. ! 3 GTHE NERVOUS SYSTEM 818 (c) The hypoglossal furnishes two or three fine filaments to the ganglion of the trunk of the vagus. These filaments are given off by the hypoglossal as it winds round the ganglion. (d) Two or three twigs from the superior cervical ganglion of the sympathetic join the ganglion of the trunk. Lower down the branches of distribution of the vagus communicate extensively with the sympathetic. (e) A twig passes from the loop formed by the anterior primary divisions of the upper two spinal nerves to the ganglion of the trunk of the vagus. This communi- cation is not constant. (2) Branches of distribution.—These are {a) the meningeal; (6) auricular; > (c) pharyngeal; {d} superior laryngeal; (e) inferior laryngeal; (/) cardiac; ' {g) pulmonary; (h) oesophageal; and (i) abdominal branches. i {a) The meningeal or recurrent branch is a slender filament which is given off | from the ganglion of the root. It takes a recurrent course through the jugular | foramen, and is distributed to the dura mater around the lateral sinus. | (b) The auricular branch, or nerve of Arnold, arises from the jugular fossa. | It traverses the bone, passing to the inner side of the aqueduct of Fallopius, and | emerges behind the pinna, where it divides into two branches, one of which joins : the posterior auricular branch of the facial while the other supplies the posterior and inferior part of the external auditory meatus and the back of the pinna. j (c) The pharyngeal branches may be two or three in number. The principal of ■ these joins the pharyngeal branch of the glosso-pharyngeal in front of the internal i carotid artery, and passes with the latter behind the external carotid artery down- !i wards and inwards to reach the posterior aspect of the pharynx. Here the two I nerves are joined by branches from the superior cervical ganglion of the sympathetic, | and form, with the latter, the pharyngeal plexus. (d) The superior laryngeal nerve arises from the lower part of the ganglion of 1 the trunk, and passes obliquely downwards and inwards behind both internal and ' external carotid arteries towards the larynx. In this course it describes a curve ; with the convexity downwards and outwards, and divides into (i) a larger internal j and (ii) a smaller external branch. ! (i) The internal branch accompanies the superior laryngeal artery to the interval between the upper border of the thyroid cartilage and the great cornu of the hyoidi j bone. It passes under cover of the thyro-hyoid muscle and pierces the thyro-hyoid membrane to gain the interior of the larynx ; here it divides into a number oi ] diverging branches. The ascending branches supply the mucous membrane on j both surfaces of the epiglottis. The descending branches ramify in the mucous i - membrane lining the larynx, communicate with the recurrent laryngeal nerve, and | supply the mucous membrane which covers the back of the cricoid cartilage. | (ii) The external laryngeal branch runs downwards towards the lower border of j the thyroid cartilage. It pierces the lower fibres of the inferior constrictor of the j pharynx, and ends for the most part in the crico-thyroid muscle. A few filaments pierce the crico-thyroid membrane, and are distributed to the lining membrane of the larynx. It gives off a cardiac branch which joins one of the cardiac branches of the sympathetic ; it also furnishes twigs to the inferior constrictor and com- I municating twigs to the pharyngeal plexus. • (e) The inferior or recurrent laryngeal nerve of the right side arises at the root | of the neck in front of the first stage of the right subclavian artery. It hooks round | the artery, passing below and then behind that vessel, and runs upwards and slightly | inwards, crossing obliquely behind the common carotid and inferior thyroid arteries. | Having gained the side of the trachea, it runs upwards in the groove between that j canal and the oesophagus, and enters the larynx by passing under cover of the lower | border of the inferior constrictor of the pharynx. It then breaks up into branches, • which are distributed to all the intrinsic muscles of the pharynx with the exception j, I PNEUMOGASTBIG NEBVE 819 of the crico-thyroid, and communicates, as above mentioned, with the superior laryngeal nerve. Near its commencement it usually gives off a cardiac branch. In its course between the oesophagus and trachea it gives numerous twigs to these structures, and near the termination it furnishes one or two twigs to the inferior constrictor of the pharynx. On the left side the nerve arises in front of the so-called transverse portion of the ' aortic arch, and wdnds round the concavity of the arch just behind the obliterated ductus arteriosus. It crosses obliquely behind the root of the left common carotid artery, gains the angular interval between the oesophagus and trachea, and corre- sponds to the nerve of the right side for the remainder of its course and distribution. ' (f) Cardiac branches. — These are named (from the different levels at which they take origin) cervical and thoracic, and form altogether three or four pairs of nerves. 1 I These all proceed to the deep cardiac plexus, with one exception, the inferior f cervical cardiac of the left side, which joins the superficial cardiac plexus. (i) The superior cervical cardiac nerves, one or two in number, join the corre- I spending branches from the sympathetic. A full account of these nerves will be ' I given in the description of the cardiac plexus. (See Sympathetic System.) (ii) The inferior cervical cardiac nerve of the left side passes downwards on the left side of the transverse portion of the aortic arch between the latter and the ( [ pleura, and joins the superficial cardiac plexus. As it crosses the arch the phrenic i : nerve is in front of it, and the left upper cer\ical cardiac of the sympathetic is behind it. The right inferior cervical cardiac passes downwards on the side of the trachea to join the deep cardiac plexus. I (iii) The thoracic cardiac branches usually arise close to and in connection with I the recurrent laryngeal nerves ; consequently the nerves on the left side arise a little i lower than the right. They are directed inwards to the front of the lower end of the trachea to terminate in the deep cardiac plexus. ; {g) The anterior pulmonary branches are one or two small twigs, which arise ) at the upper border of the root of the lung and pass forwards to gain the anterior !aspect of the bronchus, where they communicate with the sympathetic and form the anterior pulmonary plexus, whence fine twigs pass on the bronchus into the lung. The posterior pulmonary plexus is formed by a great flattened expansion of the pneumogastric nerve on the posterior aspect of the bronchus. From this several stout twigs proceed, which communicate with twigs from the second, third, and fourth thoracic ganglia of the sympathetic, and pass into the lung. I {h) (Esophageal branches.—Numerous twigs are given oft' from the plexus gulae : as it encircles the oesophagus, and are distributed to the muscular and mucous coats of that canal. (i) Abdominal branches.—The termination of the left vagus nerve passes through the oesophageal opening in the diaphragm on the anterior aspect of the ! oesophagus, and is distributed over the anterior surface of the stomach. The I strongest branches accompany the coronary artery along the lesser curvature of the ' stomach, and, from these, twigs pass on to the hepatic artery and join the hepatic plexus. The termination of the right vagus is distributed upon the posterior sur- face of the stomach, and gives twigs to the coeliac, splenic, and left renal plexuses. ELEVENTH OR SPINAL ACCESSORY NERVE . The spinal accessory nerve consists of two distinct parts, w^hich are usually known as the spinal and the accessory portions of the nerve. The former of these I (spinal portion) is a purely motor nerve which arises from the nerve-cells in the [cervical spinal cord. The accessory portion, on the other hand, a.rises by a series of roots from the distal parts of both the motor and sensory accessorio-vago- 3 G 2820 THE NEBVOUS SYSTEM ! ! giosso-pharyngeal nuclei in the medulla, and would be more properly described as the most distal vagal roots (Obersteiner) than as a separate nerve. The accessory portion (distal vagal roots, or bulbar accessory) consists of four or five fasciculi which arise in a precisely similar manner to the roots of the vagus with which they are in series. Shortly after their emergence from the medulla they join the spinal portion and accompany the latter through the jugular foramen. Having gained the exterior of the skull, the bulbar accessory leaves the nerve with which it has been associated in part of its course, and joins the ganglion of the root of the vagus; some of its fibres pass into the pharyngeal and superior laryngeal nerves as already described. The spinal portion arises from nerve-cells in the extreme lateral margin of the anterior horn in the cervical portion of the spinal cord. According to some anatomists the cells of the processus reticularis and the cells of the lateral horn are believed to be the nucleus of this nerve. Some of the fibres run longitudinally! for a short distance and join other more direct fibres, which arch backwards and' outwards to emerge at the lateral column of the cord between the posterior nerve! roots and the attachment of the ligamentum denticulatum. The superficial originj of the nerve is thus constituted by a row of filaments which extend from the fifth! or sixth (rarely the seventh) to the first cervical nerve. The lowest of this series' of roots is close to the ligamentum denticulatum ; the highest is near to the point i of emergence of the posterior roots of the first cervical nerve. The roots unite toi form a rounded cord Avhich courses upwards, increasing in size as it ascends, and] enters the cranial cavity by passing through the foramen magnum. Here it isl joined, for the time being, by the accessory portion, and passes with the latter, in: the form of a single trunk, through the middle compartment of the jugulari foramen. At the base of the skull it runs downwards, outwards, and backwards! between the occipital artery and the internal jugular vein, to pass under cover of; the sterno-mastoid muscle ; here it pierces the deeper fibres of the muscle and' communicates with a branch derived from the second cervical nerve. From the plexus so formed the sterno-mastoid is supplied. The nerve then emerges' at the posterior border of the muscle, crosses the floor of the posterior triangle ofj the neck obliquely, and passes under cover of the trapezius; on the deep surface I of that muscle the spinal accessory is joined by branches from the third and fourtti cervical nerves, and forms Avith them the subtrapezial plexus, from which the* trapezius is supplied. , TWELFTH OR HYPOGLOSSAL NERVE The hypoglossal nerve arises from an elongated column of nerve-cells whict! extends from the stride meduUares in the floor of the fourth ventricle downwards tc | the level of the lower end of the olivary body. This column contains nerve-cell^l of large size. It represents the neck of the anterior horn of the grey crescent ir! the spinal cord, and is continued into that structure below. In its lower part thd column is placed ventro-laterally to the central canal, but, as the central cana i expands into the floor of the fourth ventricle, the grey column is displaced laterally | and thus apparently occupies a more dorsal position. It corresponds to the arer described as the trigonum hypoglossi, and is separated from the ependyma of thd ventricle only by a thin layer of medullated fibres. From the cells embedded ir this grey column the nerve-fibres arise. These fibres pass in bundles which an directed ventrally and outwards, internal to the olivary nucleus, between the lattei j and the internal accessory olive. Finally they emerge in a row of from ten t(j twelve filaments in the furrow between the olivary and pyramidal bodies, consti j tuting the superficial origin of the hypoglossal nerve. I821 HYPOGLOSSAL NEBVE An accessory nucleus is also described which is placed ventro-laterally to the above described (or chief) nucleus. This accessory nucleus represents a portion of the head of the anterior horn. Fibres pass from the inner side of the hypoglossal nucleus, and cross in the raphe from where they ascend brainwards to establish the cortical origin of the nerve. The filaments unite to form two fasciculi, each of which pierces the dura mater separately at a point opposite to the anterior condyloid foramen. As these fasciculi traverse the foramen, they unite to form a single trunk, which is placed at first on the inner side of the pneumogastric, but then winds spirally round the ganglion of the trunk of the latter nerve, passing behind, external to, and finally in front of the ganglion. In this situation the hypoglossal receives two or three commu- nicating branches from the first and second cervical nerves, and some minute twigs from the vagus and sympathetic. The hypoglossal then runs forwards and inwards, describing a curve, the concavity of which looks downwards and outwards. At the commencement of this part of its course it hooks round the occipital artery, passing immediately below that vessel. It then crosses in front of the internal and external carotid arteries, the middle constrictor of the pharynx, and the hyo- glossus muscle, and, passing under cover of the mylo-hyoid, breaks up into its terminal branches. As it lies on the middle constrictor the great cornu of the hyoid bone and the lingual artery are below it and the tendon of the digastric muscle is above it. As it passes on to the hyo-glossus it is crossed on its superficial surface by the digastric and stylo-hyoid muscles. It is also overlapped in this situation by the submaxillary gland. Branches.—The meningeal branch (Luschka) is given off by the hypoglossal as it is traversing the anterior condyloid foramen, and takes a recurrent course into the cranial cavity, where it is distributed to the dura mater. It is probably derived from the communicating branches of the pneumogastric or from the first cervical nerve. The remaining branches of the hypoglossal may be classified into branches of the cervical plexus which are simply adherent for the time being to the cranial nerve, and true hypoglossal branches; the latter are exclusively distributed to the muscles of the tongue. The BRANCHES DERIVED FROM THE CERVICAL PLEXUS are the descendens hypoglossi, and the muscular twigs to the thyro-hyoid and genio-hyoid muscles. The descendens hypoglossi parts company with the hypoglossal at the point where the latter hooks round the occipital artery. It runs downwards and slightly inwards on the sheath of the great vessels (occasionally within the sheath), and is joined at a variable level by the communicantes hypoglossi from the second and third cervical nerves, forming a loop, the ansa hypoglossi. The ansa hypoglossi may be placed at any level from a point immediately below the occipital artery to about an inch and j a half above the sternum. A twig to the anterior belly of the omo-hyoid arises from the descendens hypoglossi in the upper part of its course. The nerves which supply the sterno-hyoid, sterno-thyroid, and posterior belly of the omo-hyoid are given off by the ansa hypoglossi. Twigs from the first two nerves pass in the muscles behind the manubrium sterni and in rare cases communicate with the phrenic within the thorax. The nerve to the posterior belly of the omo-hyoid runs in a loop of the cervical fascia below the central tendon of the muscle. The nerve to the thyro-hyoid is given off near the tip of the great cornu of the hyoid bone, and runs obliquely downwards and inwards to reach the muscle. I The nerve to the genio-hyoid arises under cover of the m^ylo-hyoid muscle. I The TRUE HYPOGLOSSAL BRANCHES supply the stylo-hyoid, hyo-glossus, genio- I' hyo-glossus, and the intrinsic muscular fibres of the tongue. ! The nerve to the stylo-hyoid is given off near the outer border of the hyo- I glossus. It pierces the stylo-glossus, and its fibres pursue a more or less recurrent course within the muscle.822 THE NEBVOUS SYSTEM The nerves to the hyo-glossus are several twigs which are supplied to the muscle as the hypoglossal nerve crosses it. The nerves to the genio-hyo-glossus arise under cover of the mylo-hyoid in common with the terminal branches to the intrinsic muscles of the tongue. They communicate freely with branches of the lingual, forming long loops which lie on the hyo-giossus muscle. From these loops twigs pass into the genio-hyo-glossus and into the muscular substance of the tongue. — j! SPINAL NERVES The spinal nerves spring from the spinal cord by four long series of roots, namely, an anterior and a posterior series on each side of the cord. These origins correspond with the superficial origins of the cranial nerves, being the points at which the nerve-fibres emerge from the cerebro-spinal axis. Like the cranial nerves, the spinal nerves have also a deep origin. This is situated in the anterior and posterior horns of the grey crescents and has been already described (page 778). The spinal nerves also resemble the cranial nerves, inasmuch as this ' deep' origin is only a preliminary interruption in nerve-cells or in plexuses in the grey matter, and from the deep origin tracts of fibres pass upwards to establish a connection with the cerebral cortex. They differ from the cranial nerves inasmuch as they arise from the spinal cord instead of from the encephalon, in their mode of origin by an anterior motor and posterior sensory root, and by the development, on each of the posterior roots, of a ganglion (the spinal ganglion). Certain of the cranial nerves resemble the spinal nerves in the two latter respects ; for example, the vagus arises from the large-celled (motor nucleus), a derivative of the anterior horn, and from the small-celled (sensory nucleus) derived from the basal part of the posterior horn ; the roots from these two sources have, however, united before the nerve has reached the surface of the medulla. The ganglion of the root of the vagus and the ganglion on the sensory root of the trigeminal (Gasserian ganglion) are clearly homologous to the ganglia on the posterior roots of the spinal nerves. The hypoglossal nerve is, in rare cases, joined by a small posterior root on which a ganglion is developed, and, on the other hand, cases are recorded in which the posterior root of the first spinal nerve was devoid of a ganglion. The anterior roots stand out in marked contrast to the posterior roots in regard to their function, being motor, whereas the posterior roots are sensory. They also differ from the posterior roots in several anatomical points. The anterior roots (with the single exception of the first) are smaller than the posterior ; they arise by four to six fasciculi, and their origins do not form a linear series, but map out a longitudinal area of one to two millimetres in breadth on the surface of the cord. The posterior roots are larger than the anterior, they arise by six to eight fasciculi, are placed in a strictly linear series, and, as each root is traversing the corresponding intervertebral foramen, it enters into a spinal ganglion, a structure with which the motor root has no connection whatever. The posterior roots are from one and a half to three times as large as the anterior, the ratio being— 1 to 1*5 in the thoracic nerves. 1 to 2 in the lumbar nerves. 1 to 3 in the cervical nerves. Course and direction.—From their superficial origin, both anterior and posterior roots proceed towards the intervertebral foramina, and unite near the outer limits of the foramina into single trunks. The ganglia on the posterior roots are placed, in the case of the majority of the nerves, within the foramina immediately internal to the point of junction of the two roots. The ganglia of the first and secondSPINAL NEBVES 823 cervical nerves are placed on the laminae of the atlas and axis. The ganglia of the sacral and coccygeal nerves are placed within the spinal canal. Each spinal ganglion is an ovoid greyish body, the long axis of which corresponds to the axis of the nerve with which it is incorporated. It is somewhat adherent to its meningeal sheath. The roots of the first spinal nerve ascend slightly to reach the interval between the atlas and the occipital bone. The second and third nerves pass horizontally outwards, the fourth passes obliquely downwards and outwards, and the remaining nerves pass out with increasing degrees of obliquity, the intraspinal course of the nerve-roots increasing in length as the series is followed downwards. It follows from the above statement that the lower nerve-roots are directed almost vertically downwards, and as the spinal cord ends at the level of the second lumbar vertebra, while the series of intervertebral foramina is continued to the lower end of the sacrum, the nerve-roots passing within the vertebral canal beyond the cord form a great sheaf of fibres, the cauda equina (fig. 437). The distance of the points of emergence (superficial origins) of certain of the nerves from the corresponding intervertebral foramina is given in the following table. This table gives the measure- ments made by Testut in a subject of eighteen years. The length of the spinal cord was in this case forty-one centimetres.

Fn^st ,, sacral ,, . Fifth „ „ „ . Each spinal nerve, as it enters the intervertebral foramen, is enclosed in a strong tubular sheath formed by the dura mater. This sheath is at first divided by a partition into two compartments, one for the anterior and the other for the posterior root. The septum soon disappears and allows the posterior and anterior roots to inter- mingle their fibres. Immediately beyond the ganglion on the posterior root the sheath thins away into the epineurium and perineurium of the nerve. The arach- noid and pia mater also send tubular processes around the nerves; these become continuous with the perineurium, and a connection is thus established between the lymph spaces around the nerves and the subdural and subarachnoid spaces. Topography.—The relation of the superficial origins of the spinal nerves to the spinous processes of the vertebrae has been investigated by Nuhn, and more recently by Reid. In the following table, which is given by the latter anatomist, A signi- fies the highest point of origin ; B the lowest point of origin ; it gives the extreme limits of origin as observed in six subjects. For example, the origin of the sixth thoracic nerve may extend as high as the lower border of the spine of the second thoracic vertebra, or as low as the upper border of the spine of the fifth, but it does not necessarily extend either as high or as low as the points indicated.

The cervical nerves are named from the vertebrae below them; the thoracic, Imiibar, sacral and coccygeal nerves from the vertebras above them. The first cervical or suboccipital nerve escapes through the interval between the occipital bone and the atlas ; the eighth cervical passes through the intervertebral foramen between the seventh cervical and first thoracic vertebras. General distribution.—Each spinal nerve, at its exit from the intervertebral foramen, gives a small recurrent branch (Luschka), which receives a communicating twig from the sympathetic, and re-enters the neural canal to be distributed to the meninges and blood-vessels within the canal. Immediately after its exit each nerve divides into an anterior and a posterior primary division. Both the anterior and posterior primary divisions are mixed nerves, containing fibres derived from both the anterior and the posterior roots. The posterior primary divisions are, with two exceptions, smaller than the anterior divisions. The posterior divisions of the first and second cervical nerves are larger than the anterior ; that of the second cervical nerve being three or four times as large as the anterior division. In the regions of the great plexuses (brachial, lumbar, and sacral) the anterior division is very much larger than the posterior, particularly in the case of the upper sacral nerves. The posterior primary divisions are distributed to the integument of the occiput, posterior aspect of the neck, of the back, and of the greater part of the gluteal region. They also supply 1 the muscles of the posterior part of the neck and the muscles of the back, with the exception of such of the posterior cervical and dorsal muscles as are connected with the superior extremity, the serrati postici, and the levatores costarum. The anterior primary divisions may be broadly stated to supply the anterior surface of the body from the level of the chin downwards, and also the limbs. Each anterior division is connected with the sympathetic system by rami communicantes. The anterior divisions contrast forcibly with the posterior divisions in the great size that they attain to in the lower cervical and lumbo-sacral regions. In these regions they communicate with one another to form plexuses, from which a number of branches are given off* to supply the limbs. POSTEEIOE PEIMAEY DIVISIONS The posterior primary divisions of the spinal nerves are, with the exception of the first and second cervical nerves, smaller than the anterior divisions. With the exception of the first cervical, the fourth and fifth sacral and the coccygeal nerves, each nerve divides shortly after its commencement into an internal and an external branch. CERVICAL NERVES.—The posterior divisions of the first and second cervical require separate description. The third, fourth, and fifth cervical nerves are of small size. They pass backwards at the outer border of the semispinalis colli, and divide into internal and external branches. The internal branches pass between the semispinalis colli and the complexus, giving twigs to both these muscles and to the multifidus spinae. They then pass between the complexus muscle and the ligamentum nuchas, pierce the origin of the trapezius, and are distributed to the integument of the back of the neck. As they enter the fasciae they are directed upwards and outwards. The branch from the third nerve is directed nearly vertically upwards, and is called the third or smallest occipital nerve. It communicates with the great occipital nerve and reaches the integument of the occiput.THE NERVOUS SYSTEM 826 The external branches are distributed to the trachelo-mastoid, the cervicahs ascendens, the transversahs colK, and to the splenius. The internal branches of the sixth, seventh, and eighth cervical nerves pass Fig. 452.—Distribution of the Posterior Primary Divisions of THE Spinal Nerves. (Henle.) under cover of the semispinaHs colK, and end in that muscle and in the adjacent part of the multifidus spinae. The external branches are distributed to the com- plexus, splenius, cervicalis ascendens, and transversalis colli muscles. The posterior primary division of the first cervical nerve passes backwardsrOSTEBIOB DIVISIONS OF SPINAL NERVES 827 between the posterior arch of the atlas and the vertebral artery, and traverses the fatty tissue which occupies the triangular space bounded by the obliquus superior, the obliquus inferior, and the rectus capitis posticus major. It gives a twdg to each of these three muscles, another twig crosses the deep surface of the rectus capitis posticus major to reach the rectus capitis posticus minor. Another twig forms a communicating loop wdth the great occipital nerve on the posterior surface of the obliquus inferior. A branch is also furnished to the complexus. In a few cases it gives a cutaneous tmg to the back of the occiput. The posterior division of the second cervical nerve divides into a small external and a very large internal branch. The external branch gives a twig to the obliquus inferior, and ends in the complexus and trachelo-mastoid muscles. The internal branch is the great occipital nerve. It gives off communicating branches which pass upwards and downwards, forming loops with the first and second cervical nerves. In this manner a small plexus (posterior cervical plexus of Cruveilhier) is formed. The great occipital nerve is then directed upwards, crossing the triangular space described in connection with the first nerve, and being covered by the complexus. It gives one or two twigs to the latter muscle, and then pierces it to reach the deep surface of the trapezius. It joierces the outer border of the trapezius immediately below the superior curved line, and divides at acute angles into a number of branches, which ramify in the scalp. These branches communi- cate freely with the lesser occipital nerve, and run in the subcutaneous fat between the skin and the occipito-frontalis. In this situation they are accompanied by branches of the occipital artery. They supply the integument which covers the portion of the occipital bone above the superior curved line, and the posterior part of the parietal bone. THORACIC NERVES.—The posterior primary divisions of the thoracic nerves pass backwards betAveen the transverse processes of the thoracic vertebrse, and divide into internal and external branches. The internal branches become progressively smaller from the second to the last of the series. The external branches show a reciprocal increase in size. The internal branches pass to the inner side of the longissimus dorsi, giving branches to that muscle and to the spinalis dorsi, semispinalis, multifidus spin^e, rotatores spinje, intertransversales, and interspinals. Large branches from the upper six or seven nerves reach the surface by piercing the origin of the trapezius close to the spinous processes of the vertebrae. They run outwards in the super- ficial fascia, and supply the integument of the back, including the skin over the inner half of the infraspinous part of the dorsum scapulae and the integument over the supraspinous fossa. The cutaneous branch of the second nerve is the largest of the series. From the lower five or six nerves small twigs usually reach the surface and become cutaneous. The external branches of the upper six or seven nerves end in the accessorius and longissimus dorsi muscles. The lower five or six, after supplying the adjacent muscles, pierce the outer series of insertions of the longissimus dorsi, and appear in the interval between that muscle and the accessorius. They then pierce the latissimus dorsi, and are distributed to the integument on the lower and outer part of the back. LUMBAR NERVES.—The internal branches of all the lumbar nerves end in the multifidus spinfe. The external branches of the upper three nerves, after supplying twigs to the adjacent muscles, pierce the posterior layer of the lumbar aponeurosis at the outer border of the erector spinae. The three nerves cross the crest of the ilium and occupy different planes in the thick superficial fascia w^hich covers the upper part of the gluteus medius. The branch from the first nerve is comparatively small, and occupies the most superficial plane. The second occupies an intermediate828 THE NEBVOUS SYSTEM position. The branch from the third nerve is the largest of the three, and occupies the deepest position; it distributes branches over the gluteus maximus as far as the great trochanter. The three nerves communicate with one another and also with the cutaneous branches from the posterior divisions of the two upper sacral nerves. The external branch of the fourth lumbar nerve is of small size and ends in the lower part of the erector spinse. The external branch of the fifth lumbar is distributed to the erector spinas and communicates with the first sacral nerve. SACRAL AND COCCYGEAL NERVES.—The posterior divisions of the upper four | sacral nerves escape from the neural canal by passing through the posterior sacral foramina ; the fifth sacral nerve passes between the sacrum and coccyx. The coccygeal nerve escapes through the termination of the neural canal. The upper three sacral nerves divide in the ordinary manner into internal and external branches, the lower two sacral and the coccygeal nerves remain undivided. The internal branches of the upper three sacral nerves are of small size, and are distributed to the multifidus spinse. The external branches unite with one another and with the external branch of the last lumbar nerve to form loops on the posterior surface of the sacrum. From these loops branches proceed to the poste- rior surface of the great sacro-sciatic ligament, where they communicate to form a second series of loops, from whence two or three branches are given off. These branches pierce the gluteus maximus and come to the surface of that muscle in a line between the posterior superior spine of the ilium and the tip of the coccyx. They are distributed to the integument over the inner part of the gluteus maximus, and communicate, in their course through the superficial fascia, with the posterior branches of the lumbar nerves. The posterior divisions of the lower two sacral and of the coccygeal nerve unite with one another and with the posterior branch of the third sacral, and form loops from Avhence twigs pass to the integument over the lower end of the coccyx. ANTERIOE PEIMAEY DIVISIONS The anterior divisions of the spinal nerves are (with the two exceptions above mentioned) larger than the posterior divisions. In the cervical, lumbar, sacral, and coccygeal regions they combine to form plexuses ; in the thoracic region each nerve takes for the most part an independent course. Each anterior division is connected by one or tw^o rami comniunicantes wdth the gangliated cord of the sympathetic. CERVICAL NERVES The upper four cervical nerves are of moderate size and unite with one another to form the cervical plexus. The anterior division of the first nerve passes out- wards and forwards under cover of the vertebral artery, lying in the groove on the posterior arch of the atlas. It then bends forwards, crossing to the inner side of the foramen in the transverse process of the atlas, and then turns downwards in front of that process to form a loop with the second cervical nerve. In this course it crosses the deep surface of the rectus capitis lateralis. The anterior division of the second nerve runs outwmxls behind the superior articular process of the axis, • and passes behind and then to the outer side of the vertebral artery to reach the interval between the scalenus medius and the rectus capitis anticus major. The third and fourth nerves, after their exit from the intervertebral foramina, pass behind the vertebral artery and appear in the interspace between the rectus capitis anticus major and the scalenus medius.CEBVICAL NERVES 829 Each of the upper four cervical nerves is connected by one or two branches with the superior cervical ganglion of the sympathetic. The lower four cervical nerves increase rapidly in size from the fifth to tlie eighth, and unite with the greater part of the first thoracic nerve to form the brachial plexus. Each of these nerves is connected by one or two twigs to the cervical sympathetic. CERVICAL PLEXUS The anterior divisions of the upper four cervical nerves unite to form the cervical plexus in the following manner : the second and third nerves are connected by ascending and descending branches with one another, and with the first and fourth nerves. In this way a series of three loops is formed. The fourth nerve is also connected with the l)rachial plexus by a descending twig. The branches of the Fkt. 453.—Diagram of the Cervical Plexus.

The superficial series is subdivided into ascending, transverse, and descending branches ; the deep series into external and internal branches. SuPEKFiciAL Branches Ascending" branches.—1. The lesser occipital nerve is derived from the second cervical. It passes backwards and slightly upwards under cover of the sterno- mastoid muscle to reach the posterior border of that muscle. It then ascends, running parallel to the posterior border of the muscle, being occasionally overlapped by it, and passes on to the scalp, where it divides into auricular, mastoid, and occipital branches, {a) The auricular branch runs upwards and slightly forAvards to reach the integument on the posterior and upper part of the pinna, and is distributed there, {h) The mastoid branch is distributed to the skin covering the base of theTHE NERVOUS SYSTEM 830 mastoid process, (c) The occipital branches ramify over the occipitaUs muscle, and are distributed to the skin of the scalp; they communicate with one another and with the great occipital nerve. 2. The great auricular nerve arises by two roots, one from the second, and the other from the third cervical nerve. It accompanies the lesser occipital nerve as far as the posterior border of the sterno-mastoid, and then winds round that muscle, and crosses it obliquely. In this course it runs upwards and forwards towards the tip of the mastoid process, and is covered by the skin, superficial fascia, and Fig. 454.—Superficial Branches of the Cervical Plexus.

At a point about the centre of its course across the sterno-mastoid muscle, it begins to divide into branches, which diverge from one another as they approach the level of the mastoid process, forming mastoid, auricular, and facial branches, (a) The mastoid branch, is small, and is distributed to the integument covering the mastoid process, (b) The auricular branches are three or four stout twigs which cross the superficial surface of the posterior auricular branch of the831 CEBVIGAL NERVES facial, and are distributed to the skin on the back of the pinna with the exception of its uppermost part. One or two twigs pass through fissures in the cartilage of the ear, and are distributed to the integument on the outer surface of the lobule and the outer surface of the lower part of the helix and antihelix. (c) The facial branches pass upwards and forwards among the superficial lobules of the parotid and supply the skin over that gland and immediately in front of it. In some cases fine twigs may be traced forwards nearly to the angle of the mouth. Transverse branch.—The superficial cervical nerve arises from the second and third nerves, and appears at the posterior border of the sterno-mastoid, a little below the great auricular nerve. It passes transversely across the sterno-mastoid under cover of the integuments and platysma, and divides into a number of twigs which spread out after the manner of a fan, and extend, as they approach the middle line, from the chin to the sternum. The upper two or three of these twigs unite with the inframandibular branch of the facial, and thus form loops. The trunk of the nerve is crossed superficially by the external jugular vein as it lies on the sterno-mastoid muscle. From the terminal branches of the nerve numerous twigs pierce the platysma to end in the skin of the front part of the neck. Descending branches.—These are derived from the third and fourth cervical nerves, and arise under cover of the sterno-mastoid. At their commencement they are usually united with the muscular branches destined for the trapezius. They become superficial at the posterior border of the sterno-mastoid, about the centre of that muscle, and are termed suprasternal, supraclavicular, and supra-acromial nerves. (1) The suprasternal twig's are small, and cross over the cla-s icular origin of the sterno-mastoid to reach the integument over the upper part of the manubrium sterni. (2) The supraclavicular nerves, of considerable size, cross in front of the middle third of the clavicle under cover of the platysma, and are distributed to the skin, covering the upper part of the pectoralis major. (3) The supra-acromial branches cross the clavicular insertion of the trapezius and the acromion process, and are distributed to the skin which invests the upper two-thirds of the deltoid muscle. Deep Branches External branches.—These consist of muscular branches, which supply the sterno-mastoid, scalenus medius, levator anguli scapula?, and trapezius. 1. The nerve to the sterno-mastoid arises from the second cervical nerve. It pierces the deep surface of the sterno-mastoid, and communicates within the muscle with the spinal accessory nerve. 2. The nerves to the scalenus medius are derived from the third and fourth cervical close to their exit from the intervertebral foramina. 3. The nerves to the levator anguli scapulae are derived from the third and fourth nerves, and occasionally from the second. They pierce the superficial surface of the levator anguli, and supply the upper three divisions of that muscle. 4. The branches to the trapezius are usually in the form of two stout twigs which are given oft' by the third and fourth cervical nerves. They emerge at the posterior border of the sterno-mastoid, and cross the posterior superior triangle of the neck at a lower level than the spinal accessory nerve. They pass under cover of the trapezius in company with the last-named nerve, and communicate with it to form the subtrapezial plexus, from which the trapezius is supplied. Internal branches.—The internal set of deep branches comprise communicating branches and muscular branches. 1. The communicating branches pass to the vagus and hypoglossal nerves, from the loop formed by the first and second nerves, and to the sympathetic from all of the four nerves which enter into the cervical plexus. The muscular branches are distributed to the rectus capitis lateralis, to I the recti capitis antici major and minor, to the longus colli, to the depressors of832 THE NEBVOUS SYSTEM the hyoid bone (commnnicantes liypoglossi), and to the diaphragm (phrenic nerve). 2. The branch to the rectus capitis lateralis is furnished to that muscle by the first nerve as it crosses the deep surface of the muscle. 3. The nerve to the rectus capitis anticus minor is given off by the first nerve at the upper part of the loop in front of the transverse process of the atlas. 4. The nerve to the rectus capitis anticus major is derived from twigs from the first and second cervical nerves. ! 5. The nerve to the longus colli is formed by twigs from the second and third cervical nerves. 6. The commnnicantes hypoglossi are given off by the second and third cervical nerves, and run obliquely downwards and inwards in front of tlie great vessels of the neck to form a loop, the ansa hypoglossi, with the so-called descendens hypoglossi. I They supply the depressor muscles of the hyoid bone. (See Hypoglossal Nerve.). I 7. The PHRENIC NERVE may arise by one, two, or three roots, the strongest, ' and occasionally the only, root being derived from the fourth cervical nerve. A root from the fifth is commonly present, and is usually associated either with the nerve i to the subclavius or with the communicating branch which passes from the cervical ] to the brachial plexus. A slender root from the third nerve is occasionally present. The cervical sympathetic also furnishes a communicating twig. The phrenic nerve passes downwards and inwards under cover of the sterno-mastoid, crossing obliquely ; in front of the scalenus anticus muscle, and passes behind the subclavian vein to I enter the thorax. In this situation it crosses in front of the commencement of the j internal mammary artery, and is commonly joined at this point by a communica- .; ting twig from the nerve to the subclavius muscle. j The further course of the phrenic differs on the two sides. On the right side the nerve passes dow^nwards, running on the outer side of the right innominate ; vein, the superior vena cava, and the pericardium, between these structures and i the pleura. In its course between the pericardium and pleura it crosses in front | of the root of the lung. It then pierces the diaphragm immediately on the ! left side of the opening for the vena cava inferior, and is distributed to the i diaphragm, the branches entering the muscle on its lower surface. On the I left side the phrenic nerve passes on to the left side of the so-called transverse j portion of the aortic arch between the latter and the pleura, and in front of the inferior cervical cardiac branch of the vagus. It then runs downwards between the pericardium and the pleura in front of the root of the lung, i taking a longer course than on the right side in consequence of the inclina- j tion of the heart to the left side, and also on account of the lower level of the left j cupola of the diaphragm. It pierces the diaphragm immediately to the left of the attachment of the pericardium to that muscle, and is distributed to its abdominal j surface in a similar manner to the nerve on the right side. Branches.—Minute twigs are supplied [a) to the pleura ; and {h) to the peri- cardium. On the right side the nerve communicates with the diaphragmatic plexus of the sympathetic, forming a small ganglion (ganglion diaphragmaticum). BEACIIIAL PLEXUS The BRACHIAL PLEXUS is formed by the anterior primary divisions of the four lower cervical nerves, the greater part of the first thoracic nerve, and is usually joined by small communicating twigs from the fourth cervical and second thoracic nerves. The four lower cervical nerves emerge in the interval between the anterior and j middle scaleni muscles. The first thoracic nerve, after traversing the intervertebral I foramen between the first and second thoracic vertebrae, appears in the first inter- costal space and, after giving off the small first intercostal nerve, crosses the inner833 BBACHIAL PLEXUS margin and upper surface of the first rib obliquely, and joins the eighth cervical nerve. The brachial plexus is divisible into four distinct stages. In the first stage all the component nerves are separate from each other. In the second stage the nerves unite with one another to form trunks. In the third stage the trunks divide into anterior and posterior divisions. In the fourth stage the six divisions become collected into three rounded bundles, which are termed cords. The fifth and sixth, and usually a communicating twig from the fourth, cervical nerves unite to form the upper trunk; the seventh remains independent and forms themiddle trunk; the eighth cervical and first thoracic, with occasionally a communi- cating twig from the second thoracic, unite to form the lower trunk. Each of these trunks divides into an anterior and a posterior division. The anterior and posterior divisions of the upper and middle trunks are about equal in size. The anterior division of the lower trunk is very much larger than the posterior division.

The anterior divisions of the upper and middle trunks join to form the outer cord. The anterior division of the lower trunk is continued into the inner cord. The first stage of the plexus is situated between the anterior and middle scaleni muscles, and at the outer border of the former muscle. The second stage is placed in the posterior inferior triangle of the neck, the lower trunk of the plexus being behind the third stage of the subclavian artery and the upper and middle trunks above and on a plane posterior to that vessel. When a posterior scapular artery arises from the third stage of the subclavian, it passes backwards between the trunks of the plexus. In its third stage the plexus lies under cover of the clavicle and subclavius muscle, and is placed above, external, and on a plane posterior to the axillary artery. In its fourth stage the plexus is situated under cover of the pectoral muscles, and the cords surround the second stage of the axillary artery, occupying 3 H834 TRE NERVOUS SYSTEM the positions indicated by their names, the external cord being in contact with the outer side of the artery, the internal cord on the inner side, and the posterior cord behind the vessel. A little external to the outer border of the pectoralis minor, the plexus terminates by dividing into large nerves, which surround the third stage of the axillary artery. j The branches of the brachial plexus are classified into branches which arise j above the clavicle, and branches which are given off below that bone. The branches | which arise below the clavicle may be conveniently subdivided into short branches I which end in the axilla, and long branches which arise from the terminations of the three cords and are destined to supply the shoulder, arm, forearm, and hand. Branches given off above the Clavicle These are all muscular branches, and comprise the following nerves:—(1) Supra- | scapular ; (2) rhomboid; (3) posterior thoracic ; (4) communicating to the phrenic ; | nerves to (5) the subclavius, (6) scaleni, and (7) longus colli. j (1) The suprascapular nerve arises from the upper trunk of the plexus, and ; therefore contains fibres derived from the fifth and sixth, and in some cases from the ' fourth, cervical nerves. It runs downwards and outwards below the posterior belly of the omo-hyoid muscle, and passes under cover of the trapezius to reach the supra- | scapular notch ; here it crosses the suprascapular artery, and takes a lower position than that vessel. It then passes through the suprascapular notch beneath the transverse ligament, and, after furnishing a twig to the shoulder joint, divides into a supraspinous and an infraspinous branch. The supraspinous branch inclines inwards and ends in the supraspinatus muscle. The infraspinous branch passes ; through the great scapular notch under cover of the spino-glenoid ligament, and i terminates in the infraspinatus muscle. ' (2) The nerve to the rhomboids arises from the fifth cervical nerve shortly after ; its exit from the intervertebral foramen. It arises in common with the upper root of the posterior thoracic nerve, and passes backwards and outwards through the fibres of | the scalenus medius. It then usually divides in a plexiform manner into several ; branches, the strongest of which passes below the levator anguli scapulae, while the ; others traverse the lowest division of that muscle and supply it with one or more twigs. In the cellular interval betAveen the levator and the rhomboideus minor, the twigs reunite to form one nerve, which passes to the deep surface of the two ' rhomboid muscles and supplies them. (8) The posterior thoracic nerve (external respiratory of Bell) arises, by three roots, from the fifth, sixth, and seventh cervical nerves. The upper two roots traverse the substance of the scalenus medius ; the root from the seventh passes in front of that muscle. Twigs are furnished to the superior portion of the serratus magnus by the upper two roots ; lower down they unite and are subsequently joined by the root from the seventh. The nerve now passes downwards behind the brachial plexus and the first stage of the axillary artery, and runs along the axillary surface of the serratus magnus, supplying twigs to each of the digitations of that muscle. (4) The communicating twig to the phrenic arises from the fifth nerve close to the point where the latter nerve receives the communicating tmg from the cervical plexus. (5) The nerve to the subclavius is a small twig which arises from the fifth nerve or from the upper trunk of the plexus. Its fibres are derived from the fifth or in some cases from the fourth cervical nerve through the communicating twig from the cervical plexus. It runs downwards in front of the third stage of the subclavian artery and, after giving off a communicating branch to the phrenic, pierces the costo- coracoid membrane, and enters the subclavius at the lower border of that muscle. Variety.—In rare cases the entire phrenic nerve may pass via, the nerve to the subclavius ; in front of the third stage of the subclavian artery. i835 BBANCHES OF BBACHIAL PLEXUS (6) The scaleni and (7) longus colli are supplied by twigs which arise from the lower three cervical nerves immediately after their exit from the intervertebral foramina. Bkanches given off below the Clavicle The AXILLARY or SHORT BRANCHES are (1) the external and (2) internal anterior thoracic, and (3) the three subscapular nerves. (1) The external anterior thoracic nerve arises from the outer cord of the plexus, and, after communicating with the internal anterior thoracic, ends in branches which supply the pectoralis major. (2) The internal anterior thoracic nerve arises from the inner cord and passes forwards between the first stage of the axillary artery and the axillary vein. It gives branches to the pectoralis minor, some of which pass through the latter muscle and end in the great pectoral. The nerve then unites with a branch from the external anterior thoracic, and forms a loop which is placed in front of the first stage of the axillary artery. From this loop additional branches are furnished to the greater pectoral muscle. (3) The subscapular nerves are branches of the posterior cord. They are three in number, are distinguished as upper, middle, and lower, and are distributed to the subscapularis, latissimus dorsi, and teres major muscles. {a) The upper or short subscapular nerve is distributed exclusively to the sub- scapularis muscle. It is occasionally double. I ih) The middle or long subscapular nerve accompanies the subscapular artery \ along the axillary margin of the subscapularis muscle and ends in the latissimus dorsi. (c) The lower subscapular nerve is distributed to the teres major and furnishes one or two twigs to the subscapularis. These tmgs enter the subscapularis near the axillary margin of that muscle. TERMINAL OR LONG BRANCHES.—These are given off as follows : from the outer ; cord, the musculo-cutaneous and the outer head of the median; from the inner cord, the inner head of the median, the ulnar, the internal cutaneous, and the lesser ^ internal cutaneous ; from the posterior cord, the musculo-spiral and the circumflex nerves. The circumflex, lesser internal cutaneous, internal cutaneous, and musculo- ' cutaneous are more proximal in their distribution than the median, ulnar, and musculo-spiral, and may therefore be first described. I (1) The circumflex nerve is a branch of the posterior cord, and is composed of fibres derived from the fifth, sixth, seventh, and eighth cervical nerves. It accom- panies the posterior circumflex artery through the quadrilateral space bounded by the teres major, long head of triceps and subscapularis muscles and by the surgical : neck of the humerus, and divides into a smaller posterior and a larger anterior : division. Previous to its division it furnishes an articular twig to the shoulder j joint. This twig pierces the inferior part of the capsular ligament. {a) The anterior division accompanies the posterior circumflex artery around the neck of the humerus, and gives off a number of stout twigs which enter the deltoid muscle. A few fine filaments pierce the deltoid and end in the integument which covers the middle third of that muscle. {h) The posterior division divides into a cutaneous and a muscular branch. The cutaneous branch supplies the skin covering the lower third of the deltoid and \ a small area of integument below the insertion of that muscle. The muscular I branch is distributed to the teres minor ; it swells out into an ovoid or fusiform reddish gangliform enlargement before perforating the muscle. I (2) The lesser internal cutaneous nerve, or nerve of Wrisberg, arises from the inner cord of the brachial plexus, and is formed of fibres derived from the eighth cervical and first thoracic nerves or from the first thoracic nerve alone. It runs down- wards on the inner side of the axillary vein, being separated by that vessel from the 3 H 2 I836 THE NERVOUS SYSTEM ulnar nerve. It passes downwards with a slight inclination backwards under cover of the deep fascia on the inner side of the arm. Near the bend of the elbow it turns somewhat sharply backwards to supply the integument which covers the olecranon process. As it traverses the axilla, the nerve of Wrisberg communicates wdth the intercosto-humeral nerve, forming one or sometimes two loops. In its course down the arm it gives a few fine twigs to the integument. (3) The internal cutaneous is a branch of the inner cord, its fibres being ulti- mately derived from the eighth cervical and first thoracic nerves. At its origin it lies on the inner side of the'axillary artery, but it soon passes on to the anterior surface of that vessel, and bears the same relation to the brachial artery in the upper two- FiG. 456.- -DlSTRIBUTION OF CUTANEOUS NeRVES ON THE ANTERIOR AND POSTERIOR Aspects of the Superior Extremity.

It then pierces the deep fascia in company with the basilic vein, and divides into an anterior and a posterior branch. Previous to its division it gives off a twig which pierces the deep fascia, and supplies the integument of the upper and inner part of the arm. (a) The anterior branch is larger than the posterior, and divides at acute angles into several twigs, some of which pass in front of and some behind the median basilic vein, and then run down the forearm to supply the integuments covering its anterior and internal aspect as far as the wrist, (b) The posterior branch passes downwards and backwards in front of the internal condyle of the humerus, and divides into branches which supply the skin on the postero- external aspect of the forearm. 1 ilBBANCHES OF BBACHIAL BLEXUS 837 (4) The musculo-cutaneous nerve is a branch of the posterior cord of the brachial plexus. It is composed of fibres which are derived from the fifth, sixth, and seventh cervical nerves. It is placed at first close to the outer side of the brachial artery, but soon leaves that vessel and pierces the coraco-brachialis muscle in a direction obliquely downwards and outwards. Continuing this oblique direction, it passes between the biceps and brachialis anticus muscles, and becomes superficial at the outer border of the former muscle, a little above the bend of the elbow. It then passes on the deep surface of the median cephalic vein, and divides into an anterior and a posterior branch. Previous to its division, the musculo-cutaneous nerve Fig. 457.—A Dissection showing the Arrangement of the Nerves in front OF the Elbow. (From a mounted specimen in the Anatomical Department of Trinity College, Dublin.) supplies three muscles, viz. the coraco-braclLialis, the biceps, and the bracJiialis .anticus. The nerves to the coraco-brachialis are two or three twigs which are ,given off from the nerve close to its origin, and before it has traversed the muscle. |The nerves to the biceps and brachialis anticus muscles arise from the musculo- cutaneous nerve as it is passing between these muscles. There is a separate t|branch for each head of the biceps. The posterior terminal branch is small, and I is directed downwards and backwards in front of the external condyle of the [humerus to be distributed to the skin on the outer and posterior aspect of the [forearm as low as the wrist. The anterior branch runs downwards on the outer and anterior part of the forearm, supplying the integument of that region, and,THE NEBVOUS SYSTEM 838 having communicated near the wist with the radial nerve, terminates in the skin covering the middle part of the thenar eminence. (5) The median nerve is formed by fibres derived from the fifth, sixth, seventh, and eighth cervical and first thoracic nerves. It arises by two heads, one from the outer, and one from the inner cord. The inner head crosses obliquely in front of the third stage of the axillary artery, and joins the outer head on the external side j of that vessel. The median nerve runs almost vertically down the arm under cover of i the skin and fascia, and is partially overlapped by the biceps. In the upper part j of the arm it is placed on the outer side of the brachial artery. About the middle | of the arm it crosses in front of that vessel, and then runs down on the inner side of the artery to the bend of the elbow. It then passes between the two heads of the pronator radii teres, and is separated from the ulnar artery in this situation by the deep head of the muscle. It then runs vertically downwards in the middle line of the forearm between the flexor sublimis and flexor profundus digitorum ; in this part of its course it is accompanied by a companion artery, the comes nervi mediani. At the upper border of the annular ligament it is placed between the tendons of the flexor carpi radialis and palmaris longus muscles, and somewhat overlapped by the tendons of the flexor sublimis. It then passes under cover of the anterior annular ligament on the superficial surface of the flexor tendons, and, at the lower border of the ligament, bifurcates into two terminal divisions, an inner and an outer. Branches.—The median nerve does not supply any part of the upper arm. In front of the elbow joint it furnishes one or two filaments to the articulation. In the forearm it supplies all the superficial anterior muscles (with the exception of the flexor carpi ulnaris) directly from its trunk, and supplies the deep muscles (with the exception of the inner half of the flexor profundus) by its anterior interosseous branch. In the hand it supplies the group of short muscles of the thumb (with the exception of those which are placed on the ulnar side of the tendon of the flexor longus pollicis), the two outer lumbricales, the integument covering the central part of the palm and inner part of the thenar eminence, and the palmar aspect of the thumb, index, middle, and radial half of the ring fingers. It also sends twigs to the dorsal aspect of these digits. (a) The nerve to the pronator radii teres arises a little above the bend of the elbow, and pierces the outer border of that muscle. (b) The nerves to the flexor carpi radialis, palmaris long^us, and flexor sublimis digitorum arise a little lower down, and pierce the pronator-flexor mass of muscles, to end in the respective members of the group for which they are destined. (c) The anterior interosseous nerve arises from the median at the level of the bicipital tubercle of the radius, and runs downwards on the interosseous membrane accompanied by the anterior interosseous artery. It passes under cover of the pronator quadratus, and pierces the deep surface of that muscle. The anterior interosseous nerve also furnishes a twig to the front of the wrist joint and supplies the flexor profundus digitorum and the flexor longus pollicis. The nerve to the former muscle arises from the posterior interosseous near its commencement and supplies the outer two divisions of the muscle, and communicates within its substance with twigs derived from the ulnar nerve. (d) The palmar cutaneous branch arises immediately above the anterior annular ligament and passes between the tendons of the flexor carpi radialis and the palmaris longus. It then crosses the superficial surface of the annular ligament, is distributed to the integument and fascia on the central depressed surface of the palm, and supplies a few twigs to the inner border of the thenar eminence ; these twigs communicate with the musculo-cutaneous and radial nerves. (e) The branch to the muscles of the thumb arises at the lower border of the annular ligament, and, winding round that ligament, divides into twigs to supply the abductor, the opponens, and the outer head of the flexor brevis pollicis.839 MEDIAN AND ULNAE NERVES (/) The external terminal division divides into two branches. The outer branch passes obhquely across the long flexor tendon of the thumb, and runs along the radial border of the thumb as far as its extremity. It gives numerous branches to the pulp of the thumb, and a strong twig which passes on to the dorsum to supply the matrix of the nail. The inner branch, after running a course varying from an eighth to a half an inch, divides into two digital collateral branches. The outer collateral branch supplies the ulnar side of the volar aspect of the thumb, and gives off a twig to the matrix of the thumb nail. The inner collateral branch is distributed in a similar manner to the radial side of the index finger. It gives off a twig to supply the first lumbrical muscle. (g) The internal terminal division divides into an outer and an inner branch. The outer branch gives a twig to supply the second lumbrical muscle, and divides a little above the metacarpo-phalangeal articulation into collateral branches, which supply the adjacent sides of the index and middle fingers, and also give twigs to the dorsum of these digits. These dorsal twigs will be more particularly described later on (page 843). The inner branch communicates with the ulnar nerve and divides to supply the adjacent sides of the middle and ring fingers. Fig. 458.—Superficial Nerves of the Palm. (Ellis.) As the branches of the median nerve pass downwards in the palm of the hand, they cross the deep or posterior surface of the superficial palmar arch. This relation to the arteries is reversed in the fingers, where the digital arteries are placed behind the nerves. As each digital nerve pursues its course along the margin of the corresponding finger, it gives off twigs to the dorsum of the finger, particularly stout twigs passing to supply the matrix of the nail. Each nerve termmates in branches to the pulp of the finger, and on these terminal branches as well as on the more proximal twigs to the volar aspect of the fingers, ovoid bodies, about the size of millet seeds, are developed. These bodies are called Pacinian corpuscles, and are one of the forms of sensory nerve-terminations.THE NERVOUS SYSTEM 840 (6) The ulnar nerve is the largest branch of the inner cord of the brachial plexus, and is derived from the eighth cervical and first thoracic nerves. It runs downwards between the axillary artery and the vein, and preserves the same relation to the brachial artery for the upper third of the arm. It then diverges from the brachial artery at an acute angle, and accompanies the inferior profunda artery to the interval between the internal condyle of the humerus and the olecranon process of the ulna. In this course it is placed under cover of the deep fascia, and pierces the internal intermuscular septum. It then passes between the two heads of the flexor carpi ulnaris, and runs downwards under cover of that muscle, between it and the flexor profunda digitorum, to reach the wrist. At the junction of the upper and middle thirds of the forearm it is joined at an acute angle by the ulnar artery, and runs parallel to the inner side of that vessel in the middle and lower two-thirds of the forearm. It enters the hand by crossing the superficial surface of the anterior annular ligament close to the radial border of the pisiform bone, and terminates by bifurcating into a superficial and a deep division. Branches.—The ulnar resembles the medial nerve in not furnishing any branches to the upper arm. As it passes between the olecranon process and the internal condyle, it gives off two or three fine filaments to the elbow joint. In the forearm it supplies the flexor carpi ulnaris and the inner portion of the flexor profundus digitorum, and gives oft' the palmar cutaneous branch. In the hand it supplies the integument of the hypothenar eminence, the little finger and half of the ring finger and part of the dorsum; it also gives twigs to the palm. It also supplies the short intrinsic muscles of the hand with the exception of the abductor, the opponens, the outer head of the flexor brevis poUicis, and the two outer lumbricales. (a) The nerves to the flexor carpi ulnaris and to the inner two divisions of the flexor profundus digitorum arise from the ulnar in the upper third of the forearm. (b) The palmar cutaneous arises at the junction of the middle and lower thirds of the forearm, and runs downwards in front of the ulnar artery, and is conducted by the vessel into the palm. It furnishes some filaments to the vessel, and ends in the integument covering the central depressed surface of the palm. (c) The dorsal or posterior branch arises about two inches above the wrist joint, and passes backwards under cover of the flexor carpi ulnaris to reach the dorsal aspect of the wrist. It crosses superficial to the tendon of the extensor carpi ulnaris immediately below the lower end of the ulna, and, after giving off twigs to supply the skin of the dorsum of the hand, divides into three branches, namely: a branch to the inner border of the little finger ; a branch w^hich divides to supply the contiguous borders of the ring and little fingers, and a branch which communi- cates with the radial and participates in the supply of the adjacent borders of the ring and middle fingers. (d) The superficial terminal branch of the ulnar nerve gives off a branch to supply the palmaris brevis muscle, and several twigs, which are distributed to the skin which covers the hypothenar eminence, and then divides into two branches, an inner and an outer. The inner branch is distributed to the inner side of the little finger on its volar aspect. The outer branch communicates with the median nerve, and then divides to supply the contiguous margins of the ring and little finger. The distribution of these branches to the fingers resembles that of the digital branches of the median nerve, which has been already described. (e) The deep branch of the ulnar nerve accompanies the deep branch of the ulnar artery into the interval between the abductor and flexor brevis minimi digiti muscles, and then passes through the fibres of the opponens minimi digiti to reach the deep surface of the flexor tendons. It supplies the abductor, flexor brevis, and opponens minimi digiti, the two inner lumbricales, all the interossei, the adductor, and the inner head of the flexor brevis pollicis. Occasionally it also gives a twig to the outer head of the flexor brevis pollicis.BADIAL NEBVE 841 I (7) The musculo-spiral nerve is the largest branch of the brachial plexus. It * arises from the posterior cord, and contains fibres derived from the fifth, sixth, seventh, and eighth cervical nerves. It is placed at first behind the third stage of i the axillary artery; lower down it has a similar relation to the upper part of the \ brachial artery. It soon leaves the latter vessel and accompanies the superior profunda artery into the interval between the inner and outer heads of the triceps. Having followed the spiral groove around the humerus, it pierces the external inter- t muscular septum and runs downwards in the interval between the supinator longus I and the brachialis anticus muscles. A little above the bend of the elbow it termi- nates by dividing into the radial and the posterior interosseous nerves. Branches.—The musculo-spiral nerve gives off three cutaneous branches, one internal and two external, and supplies the following muscles : triceps, anconeus, brachialis anticus in part, supinator longus, and extensor carpi radialis longior. {a) The internal cutaneous branch arises within the axilla, usually in common with the branch to the long head of the triceps. It crosses the tendon of the latissimus dorsi muscle and passes on to the back of the arm to supply a strip of integument extending nearly down to the elbow, and placed between the areas of distribution of the circumflex and intercosto-humeral nerves. {h) The external cutaneous branches are distinguished as upper and lower. The upper branch, much the smaller, pierces the deep fascia in the line of the external intermuscular septum, and is distributed to the skin over the lower part of the biceps muscle. The lower branch is of considerable size. It pierces the deep fascia a little below the upper branch, and runs on the supinator longus in; front of the external condyle of the humerus. It then inclines backwards and supplies the integument on the back of the forearm as far as the wrist. (c) A nerve is furnished to each of the three heads of the triceps. The nerve to the long head arises within the axilla. The nerves to the outer and inner heads arise as the nerve is traversing the spiral groove. A separate branch, the ulnar collateral of Krause, accompanies the ulnar nervje for some distance, and ends in the lower part of the inner head of the triceps. {d) Muscular branches.—The nerve to the anconeus arises in common with the nerve to the inner head of the triceps, and runs down in the fibres of the latter muscle towards the interval between the olecranon process and the external condyle, where it ends in the anconeus. In its course through the triceps it furnishes a number of fine filaments to that muscle. The nerves to the brachialis anticus, supinator longus, and extensor carpi radialis longior arise in the interval between the first and two last named muscles. (e) The posterior interosseous nerve passes downwards in the interval between the brachialis anticus and the extensor carpi radialis longior, and, having given off a branch to supply the extensor carpi radialis brevior, it runs downwards and back- ■ wards through the substance of the supinator brevis, and enters the cellular interval between the superficial and deep layers of muscles at the back of the forearm. Having given off twigs to supply these muscles, it passes on to the interosseous . membrane at the lower third of the forearm, and passes under cover of the tendons ■ of the extensor communis digitorum to reach the back of the wrist, where it swells < into a gangiiform enlargement, from which twigs are given off to supply the carpal articulations. The muscles supplied by the posterior interosseous nerve are the ^ extensor carpi radialis brevior, the supinator brevis, the extensor communis i digitorum, extensor minimi digiti, extensor carpi ulnaris, the three extensor muscles of the thumb, and the extensor indicis. The supinator brevis receives two twigs, I one of which is given off before the nerve pierces the muscle, and the other while \ it is traversing the muscular substance. I (/) The radial nerve is somewhat smaller than the posterior interosseous, and I is a purely cutaneous nerve. It runs downwards under cover of the supinator longus.842 THE NEBVOUS SYSTEM and, approaching the radial artery at an acute angle, runs parallel to the outer side of that vessel in the middle third of the forearm. It then parts company with the artery by bending backwards on the deep surface of the tendon of the supinator longus. It then pierces the deep fascia and is directed towards the back of the wrist, where it divides into its terminal branches. One of these, the palmar cutaneous of the radial nerve, supplies the outer part of the thenar eminence; two others supply the dorsum of the thumb, a fourth branch runs along the radial side of the index finger, a fifth divides to supply the adjacent side of the index and middle fingers, and a sixth branch communicates with the dorsal branch of the ulnar nerve to supply the adjacent side of the middle and ring fingers. Nerve-supply of the dorsal integument to the hand.—It will be seen, by the foregoing description of the radial and ulnar nerves, that the thumb, index, and half the middle finger are supplied by the radial; the little and half the ring finger by the ulnar ; and the adjacent sides of the ring and middle fingers by both radial and ulnar nerves. The distance to which these nerves extend on the digits is somewhat variable, but the following is theINTEBCOSTAL NEBVES 843 average condition:—The radial nerve extends to the base of the thumb nail, to the distal ' interphalangeal joint of the iiidex, and not quite to the proximal interphalangeal joint of the middle finger, and sends a fine twig in some cases to the skin covering the meta- I phalangeal articulation of the ring finger. The ulnar nerve extends to the nail of the little finger, to the distal interphalangeal joint of the ring, and in some cases to the integument covering the proximal interphalangeal jomt of the middle, and the metacarpo-phalangeal articulation of the index finger. The distal parts of the dorsum of the fingers are supplied by twigs from the palmar collateral branches of the median and ulnar, almost the whole of the middle finger being supplied in this way, and the other digits to a less degree. The matrix of the thumb nail is supplied by twigs from the palmar branches of the median. A' considerable part of the dorsum of the hand is usually supplied by twigs from both the radial and the ulnar nerves, as these nerves overlap one another in then" distribution (fig. 459). Occasionally two other nerves, the musculo-cutaneous and the lower external • cutaneous branch of the musculo-spiral, take part in the supply of the back of the hand. THORACIC NERVES The smaller part of the first thoracic nerve and the second to the eleventh thoracic nerves follow the contour of the body wall in the intervals between the ribs, and are therefore termed intercostal nerves. The twelfth thoracic nerve pursues a parallel course to the others, below the tw^elfth rib. Each of the intercostal nerves is accompanied by an intercostal artery and vein. These vessels are placed, immediately above the nerve, in the groove at the lower border of the rib. The twelfth thoracic nerve is accompanied by the first kmibar artery. Each thoracic nerve is joined, near the head of the rib, by two rami communicantes from the gangiiated cord of the sympathetic. The first and last thoracic nerves require separate description. The remaining ten nerves fall naturally into an upper and a lower group. The members of the upper group (the second to the sixth) run between the ribs as far as the margin of the sternum. The members of the lower group (seventh to eleventh nerves) lie for a part of their course between the layers of the abdominal w^all, the extent of the abdominal distribution increasing from the highest to the lowest member of the series. A. First thoracic nerve.—The greater part of the first thoracic nerve crosses the neck of the first rib to join the brachial plexus, as already described. The smaller part, about one-fifth of the entire nerve, runs for about two inches in contact with r^fthe under surface of the first rib between the bone and the pleura, and then enters I the cellular interval between the external and internal intercostal muscles. For the remainder of its course it corresponds to the upper intercostal nerves in its distri- bution, but it does not usually give a lateral or an anterior cutaneous branch. Variety.—In some cases a lateral cutaneous nerve arises from the first intercostal nerve, ilt may be of small size, but is sometimes as large as an ordinary intercosto-humeral nerve. It communicates with the intercosto-humeral nerve and with the nerve of Wrisberg. B. Upper intercostal nerves.—The second, third, fourth, fifth, and sixth inter- icostal nerves, after receiving communications from the sympathetic, are directed outwards in the intercostal spaces in front of the posterior intercostal membrane, between that membrane and the pleura. They then enter the interval between the |3xternal and internal intercostal muscles, and follow the curve of the thoracic wall between these muscles as far as the mid-axillary line, and then, taking a deeper position, they run through the fibres of the internal intercostals as far as the junction 3f the bony parts of the ribs with their cartilages. They then pass forwards on the ieep surface of the internal intercostal muscles, lying on the pleura and on the slips of Ijhe triangularis sterni, and cross in front of the internal mammary vessels. Lastly, 'jhey bend forwards and pierce the internal intercostals and pectoralis major, and844 THE NEBVOUS SYSTEM Fig. 460.—Cutaneous Nerves of the Thorax and Abdomen, viewed from the Side. (After Henle.)845 INTERCOSTAL NEBVES terminate as the anterior cutaneous nerves of the thorax. In this course they give off muscular branches to the levatores costarum, serratus posticus superior, external and internal intercostals, and triangularis sterni. Each nerve also gives off two cutaneous branches—namely, the lateral and anterior cutaneous nerves of the thorax. The lateral cutaneous nerves of the thorax pierce the external intercostal muscles, and divide into anterior and posterior branches. These branches pass between the digitations of the serratus magnus, and are separated by an interval of about half an inch, when they appear on the superficial surface of that muscle. The anterior branches run forwards, cross the lower border of the great pectoral, and supply the integuments which cover the lower and outer portion of that muscle, and give twigs to the mammary gland. They decrease progressively in size from the sixth to the third. In the case of the second lateral cutaneous nerve, the anterior branch is usually wanting. The posterior branches turn backwards, and supply the skin covering the outer part of the latissimus dorsi and the inferior angle of the scapula. The lateral cutaneous branches of the second and third intercostal nerves are larger than the others, and require separate notice. The lateral cutaneous branch of the second intercostal nerve is called the intercosto-humeral nerve. It passes outwards across the axillary space, and crosses the tendon of the latissimus dorsi to reach the arm. It is distributed to the integument of the inner and posterior part of the arm in its upper two-thirds. Within the axilla it communi- cates with the lesser internal cutaneous nerve of the brachial plexus, and with the lateral cutaneous branch of the third intercostal. The lateral cutaneous branch of the third intercostal divides into a small anterior and a large posterior branch. The anterior branch ends near the margin of the great pectoral muscle. The posterior branch communicates with the intercosto-humeral nerve, and then turns round the posterior fold of the axilla, and, after giving a twig to the integument of the arm, ends in the skin covering the dorsum of the scapula. The anterior cutaneous nerves of the thorax are the terminal branches of the upper intercostal nerves. They pierce the pectoralis major in company with the perforating branches of the internal mammary artery. On reaching the surface of the muscle, they give off minute twigs, which supply the skin over the sternum, and then end in slender branches which are directed outwards to supply the skin cover- ing the greater part of the pectoralis major. Some tAvigs from the third and fourth nerves are distributed to the mammary gland. C. Lower intercostal nerves.—The seventh, eighth, ninth, tenth, and eleventh intercostal nerves, in the part of their course which lies between the ribs, present the same relations as the upper intercostal nerves. On emerging from between the ribs, they pass forwards between the internal oblique and transversalis muscles, and usually communicate with one another in a plexiform manner in this situation. They then pierce the outer edge of the sheath of the rectus, and, after supplying the rectus, pass through the muscular substance and pierce the anterior part of the sheath, where they end as the anterior cutaneous nerves of the abdomen. Branches.—The lower intercostal nerves supply the external and internal inter- costal muscles, the levatores costarum, the serratus posticus inferior, the internal obhque, the transversalis, and the rectus. They also give off' lateral cutaneous branches, by which the external obhque is supplied. The lateral cutaneous nerves of the abdomen are the continuation of the series of the lateral cutaneous nerves of the thorax. They divide into anterior and posterior branches, which pierce the external oblique. The anterior branches are directed forwards and somewhat downwards, and supply the integument covering the anterior abdominal wall as far as the outer margin of the rectus. Each nerve gives off' a muscular twig, which pierces the adjacent digitation of the external oblique muscle on its superficial surface. The posterior branches pass backwards around the margin of the latissimus dorsi, and end in the skin of the outer part of the back.846 THE NEBVOUS SYSTEM The anterior cutaneous nerves of the abdomen are the terminal branches of the I lower intercostal nerves, and pierce the anterior part of the sheath of the rectus to | supply the skin covering that muscle. These nerves are of small size, and sometimes j divide before their emergence, so as to form a double series. | D. Last thoracic nerve.—This nerve gives off a communicating twig to the first | lumbar nerve, and then passes through the external arcuate ligament, and runs j outwards below the twelfth rib. It pierces the posterior aponeurosis of the trans- | versalis, and follows the curve of the abdominal wall between the transversalis and 1 internal oblique muscles. In the remainder of its course it resembles a lower | intercostal nerve. After piercing the rectus, however, it supplies the pyramidalis | (Griffin). Its lateral cutaneous branch remains undivided, and represents the [ anterior division of an ordinary lateral cutaneous branch. On account of its ■ distribution, it is named the iliac branch. The iliac branch pierces the external I oblique about three inches above the iliac crest, and is directed dowmwards, across i the crest, a short distance behind the anterior superior spine. It ends in the ' integument covering the anterior part of the gluteal region. ■ LUMBAR NERVES I The anterior divisions of the five lumbar nerves increase progressively in size from above downwards, the first lumbar being about the size of an intercostal nerve, and the fifth a nerve of considerable magnitude. The first, second, third, and part of the fourth nerves unite to form the lumbar plexus. The remainder of the fourth unites with the fifth to form the lumbo-sacral cord, which passes to the sacral plexus. Each lumbar nerve is connected to the gangliated cord of the sympathetic by rami communicantes. These rami communicantes reach the lumbar nerves by accompanying the lumbar arteries through the fibrous arches from which the psoas takes origin. LUMBAR PLEXUS | The lumbar plexus is placed among the deeper fibres of the psoas, and is con- stituted as follows : the first lumbar nerve is joined by a communicating twig from j the twelfth thoracic and divides into two branches ; one of these is the common ! origin of the ilio-hypogastric and ilio-inguinal nerves ; the other branch unites with a branch of the second lumbar to form the genito-crural nerve. The second, 1 third, and fourth lumbar nerves divide into anterior and posterior divisions. A part | of the anterior division of the second lumbar nerve enters into the composition of j the genito-crural nerve as above mentioned ; the remainder of the anterior division i of the second nerve unites with the anterior division of the third and part of the . fourth nerve to form the obturator nerve. The remainder of the anterior division i of the fourth nerve enters the lumbo-sacral cord. The posterior divisions of the , second, third, and fourth nerves end chiefly in two large nerves—the external cuta- ; neous and the anterior crural. The external cutaneous arises from the second and ' third nerves. The anterior crural springs from the second, third, and fourth nerves, j A part of the posterior division of the fourth nerve enters the lumbo-sacral cord. \ The large terminal branches above described are given off within the substance , of the psoas; three of these, the ilio-hypogastric, ilio-inguinal, and external cuta- j neous, appear at the outer border of the psoas, between that muscle and the j quadratus lumborum ; one, the genito-crural, pierces the anterior fibres of the psoas and appears in front of the muscle ; another branch, the obturator, appears at the j inner border of the psoas close to the lower margin of the fifth lumbar vertebra ; |LUMBAB PLEXUS 847 lastly, the anterior crural nerve, the largest branch of the plexus, runs downwards in the interval between the psoas and iliacus. Within the psoas small twigs are given off by the lumbar nerves, which end in the muscular substance of the psoas and quadratus lumborum. Branches.—The nerves to the i^soas and quadratus lumhoruiii arise in an irregular manner from the lumbar nerves within the substance of the psoas. The ilio-hypogastric and ilio-inguinal nerves are in some cases represented by Fig. 461.—Diagram of the Lumbar and Sacral Plexuses. (Modified from Paterson.)

More commonly they exist as two separate nerves, the upper and larger nerve being ilio-hypogastric ; the lower and smaller, ilio-inguinal. Taken together they correspond in many respects to a lower intercostal nerve. They run for a considerable part of their course between the transversalis and internal oblique, giving twigs to both these muscles. The ilio-hypogastric gives off a lateral cutaneous, which is called the iliac branch, and terminates in an anterior cutaneous which is termed the hypogastric branch.THE NEBVOUS SYSTEM 848 (1) The ilio-hypogastric nerve is a branch of the first himbar. It appears at the i outer border of the psoas and crosses the quadratiis hmiborum obHquely to reach j the crest of the ilium. In this part of its course it is surrounded by the extra- | peritoneal fat.

(6) The hypogastric branch continues the direction of the main trunk, and perforates the internal oblique near the anterior superior spine of the ilium. In this part of its course it communicates in a plexiform manner with the ilio-inguinal nerve. It is then directed forwards and inwards under cover of the aponeurosis of the external oblique. Finally it pierces the aponeurosis at a point about an inch above the external abdominal ring, and supplies the skin in that situation, forming a continuation of the series of anterior cutaneous nerves of the abdomen. i849 BRANCHES OF LUMBAB PLEXUS (2) The ilio-inguinal nerve arises from the first lumbar nerve in common with the iho-hypogastric, and accompanies the last-named nerve across the quadratus lumbormn, but at a lower level. It then passes obliquely across the upper part of the iliacus and pierces the transversalis muscle. It follows the curve of the crest of the ilium in company with the ilio-hypogastric, communicating with that nerve in a plexiform manner. It pierces the inferior oblique a little in front of the anterior superior spine of the ilium, and runs forwards under cover of the aponeurosis of the external oblique immediately above Poupart's ligament, and reaches the external abdominal ring. It then traverses the ring and divides into its terminal branches, which are distributed to the skin covering the upper part of the adductor longus, the integuments of the scrotum in the male, and of the labium majus in the female. (3) The genito-crural nerve arises from the first and second lumbar nerve by two roots which pass forwards and downwards through the fibres of the psoas, and unite to form a single trunk. The nerve then appears on the surface of the psoas close to the vertebral column, and runs downwards under cover of the peritoneum to reach the outer side of the external iliac artery, where it divides into a genital and a crural branch. {a) The genital branch accompanies the spermatic vessels through the inguinal canal, and, emerging from the external abdominal ring, pierces the internal spermatic fascia, and is distributed to the cremaster muscle. In the female this branch is rudimentary and accompanies the round ligament. ih) The crural branch is carried downwards in front of the external iliac and femoral artery into the external compartment of the femoral sheath. It pierces the femoral sheath and becomes subcutaneous about two inches below Poupart's ligament by piercing the fascia lata. It is distributed to the skin covering the upper and central part of the anterior aspect of the thigh. (4) The obturator nerve arises from the third and fourth lumbar nerves, and in the majority of cases receives an additional root from the second. It passes between the psoas muscle and the body of the fifth lumbar vertebra. It then runs down- wards and forwards to reach the upper margin of the thyroid foramen. In this part of its course it runs parallel to and a little below the brim of the pelvis, and is placed in the extra-peritoneal fat between the peritoneum and the parietal pelvic fascia. It is accompanied by the obturator vessels which are placed below it. The nerve then passes through the deficiency in the obturator membrane, and divides I into two branches, an anterior and a posterior. I (a) The anterior branch passes across the upper border of the obturator externus, and is directed downwards and inwards between the pectineus and 1 adductor brevis, and divides into the following branches :—(i) A twig for the hip joint; (ii) a branch for the adductor longus ; (iii) a branch to supply the adductor brevis ; (iv) a branch for the gracilis ; (v) in rare cases, a twig for the pectineus ; j (vi) a cutaneous branch. The cutaneous branch becomes superficial by passing between the adductor longus and adductor brevis, and is then directed along the ! posterior border of the sartorius, where it communicates with twigs from the long I saphenous and from the posterior branch of the internal cutaneous to form the I subsartorial plexus. I {h) The posterior branch gives off branches to supply the hip joint and the obturator externus, and then pierces the upper part of that muscle, and reaches the interval between the adductor brevis and adductor magnus. It runs downwards on the anterior surface of the latter muscle, supplying it with twigs, and terminates in an articular twig, the geniculate branch, which is distributed to the hip joint, (i) The twig to the hip joint enters the acetabulum by passing through the cotyloid notch. It ramifies in the fat occupying the floor of the acetabulum and in the adjacent synovial membrane, (ii) The branch to the obturator externus pierces 3 1850 THE NERVOUS SYSTEM the deep surface of the muscle, (iii) Several large twigs enter the adductor magnus. (iv) The geniculate branch pierces the lower part of the adductor magnus and appears on the posterior surface of that muscle close to the opening for the popliteal vessels, and descends on the inner side of (sometimes behind) the popliteal artery. Having given off a filament which accompanies the superior internal articular artery, it breaks up into terminal twigs which separately pierce the posterior ligament of the knee joint.

It arises from the obturator nerve near its commencement, or by separate roots from the third and fourth lumbar nerves. It runs along the inner border of the psoas, and crosses in front of the brim of the pubis to gain the deep surface of the pectineus. In this situation it breaks up into branches. The largest of these branches joins the obturator nerve, others enter the capsule of the hip joint, and a branch is furnished to the pectineus.ANTERIOR CRURAL NERVE 851 (5) The external cutaneous nerve arises, by two roots, from the second and third lumbar nerves. It emerges at the outer border of the psoas, and crosses obliquely in front of the iliacus to reach the interval between the anterior superior and anterior inferior spines of the ilium. In this course it runs under cover of the fascia iliaca. It then passes behind Poupart's ligament, crosses in front of the origin of the sartorius, and divides into an anterior and a posterior branch. The posterior branch passes backwards and downwards under cover of the fascia lata, and divides into twigs, which supply the integument covering the insertion of the gluteus maximus and the upper and outer part of the thigh. The anterior branch Fig. 464.- -DlSTRIBUTION OF CuTANEOUS NeRVES ON THE POSTERIOR AND ANTERIOR Aspects of the Inferior Extremity.

It divides into branches which supply the skin of the outer part of the thigh, a few of the terminal twigs reaching as far ' as the knee and entering into the composition of the plexus patellae. (6) The anterior crural nerve is the largest branch of the lumbar plexus. It I arises by three roots, which spring from the second, third, and fourth Imiibar nerves ; ! these roots traverse the substance of the psoas and unite into a single trunk in the deep groove between the psoas and iliacus muscles. The nerve then passes under cover of the fascia iliaca behind Poupart's ligament, and is placed behind the 3 I 2852 THE NEBVOUS SYSTEM femoral sheath at the outer side of the femoral artery. In this situation it divides into its terminal branches ; these branches may be classified into cutaneous and muscular, some of the latter being associated with articular twigs. The muscular branches are distributed to the iliacus, pectineus, sartorius, quadriceps extensor, and subcrureus. The cutaneous branches are the middle and internal cutaneous and the long saphenous. (a) The nerves to the iliacus are given off from the anterior crural in the intra- abdominal part of its course. {b) The nerve to the pectineus arises immediately below Poupart's ligament. It passes inwards behind the femoral vessels and the femoral sheath, and enters the anterior surface of the muscle. (c) The nerve to the sartorius is usually adherent to the middle cutaneous fori a part of its course. (d) The nerves to the quadriceps are of large size and are distributed to thei four portions of the muscle. From the branch to the rectus an articular twig isj furnished to the hip joint. The nerves to the vasti give large twigs to the upperj and lateral portions of the capsule of the knee joint. The nerve to the crureus,' after giving branches to the upper part of the muscle, runs downwards between j the adherent borders of the crureus and vastus internus to reach the anterior j aspect of the lower end of the femur, where, after supplying the subcrureus, it endsi! in the synovial membrane of the knee joint. t (e) The middle cutaneous nerve usually takes the form of two strong branches, j Avhich run a nearly parallel course. One of these branches usually pierces the' sartorius, while the other crosses the superficial surface of that muscle ; they pierce the fascia lata a little above the middle of the thigh. They ramify in the super-; ficial fascia, supplying the skin of the anterior part of the thigh as far as the knee, \ where they end in the plexus patellae. (/) The internal cutaneous nerve is directed downwards along the outer side of the femoral artery, and gives off in this situation two or three cutaneous twigs, which i pierce the fascia lata. It then crosses obliquely in front of the femoral artery, atj the lower angle of Scarpa's triangle, and divides into an anterior and a posteriori branch. The anterior branch is the larger. It runs downwards in front of the] sartorius, under cover of the fascia lata. It pierces the fascia lata about the! middle of the lower third of the thigh, and, after giving twigs to the skin of that region, turns outwards to end in the plexus patellae. The posterior branch runs ' along the posterior border of the sartorius, and, after giving twigs to the sub-: sartorial plexus, runs downwards on the inner aspect of the knee, and ends in the: integument of the upper and inner part of the calf. i Plexus patellae.—The skin covering the patella is profusely supplied with nerves which i communicate with one another, and are derived from the external, middle, and internal j cutaneous and from the long saphenous. j Subsartorial plexus.—At the posterior border of the sartorius muscle, a little below the; middle of the thigh, branches of the obturator, long saphenous, and internal cutaneous • nerves communicate in a plexiform manner and supply the adjacent skin. The posterior i branch of the internal cutaneous has an independent distribution, as already described, j Occasionally the cutaneous branch of the obturator is unusually large, and may supply ani area of integument covering the lower part of the inner hamstring muscles. 'i {g) The long or internal saphenous nerve accompanies the nerve to the vastus internus in its course through Scarpa's triangle, being placed between the latter] \ nerve and the femoral artery. It enters Hunter's canal, and runs a parallel course toj ■ the femoral artery, being supplied against the outer side of that vessel. At the lower ji end of the canal it crosses in front of the femoral vessels, and runs on the deepi surface of the sartorius accompanied by the superficial branch of the anastomotic| j artery. It passes between the tendons of the sartorius and gracilis, and becomesj ;COCCYGEAL PLEXUS 853 superficial a little below the knee. At this point it approaches the long saphenous vein, and accompanies that vessel for the remainder of its course. It runs down the anterior and inner part of the leg, supplying branches to the skin of that region, passes in front of the inner malleolus, and supplies the integument for about two inches below that prominence. As it leaves Hunter's canal, the long saphenous nerve gives off a patellar branch. This branch pierces the sartorius, and runs, at first downwards and then inwards, towards the ligamentum patellae. It gives twigs to the integument covering that ligament, and others Avhich curve upwards to join the plexus patellae. SACRAL AND COCCYGEAL NERVES The anterior primary divisions of the upper four sacral nerves escape from the neural canal by passing through the anterior sacral foramina, while the anterior division of the fifth passes forwards between the sacrum and coccyx. The coccygeal nerve escapes from the neural canal by passing through the terminal opening. Its anterior primary division pierces the sacro-sciatic ligaments and passes forwards. The sacral nerves decrease progressively in size, from the first to the fifth. The first sacral nerve is the largest nerve in the body, while the fifth is very small. Each sacral nerve is connected to the gangliated cord of the sympathetic by rami communicantes. The anterior divisions of the first, second, and part of the fourth nerves join the sacral plexus ; another part of the fourth has an independent distribution. The lower part of the fourth joins the fifth sacral and the coccygeal nerve to form the coccygeal plexus. The branches of the fourth sacral nerve and the coccygeal plexus may be conveniently described first, as their distribution is confined to a limited area in the immediate neighbourhood of the sacral plexus. FOURTH SACRAL NERVE The fourth sacral nerve gives off an ascending branch to join the sacral plexus, and a descending twig to the coccygeal plexus. In the interval between these communicating branches, several offsets arise directly from the fourth sacral, without entering into a plexiform arrangement. These direct offsets are the perforating cutaneous nerve, the perinatal branch, and the muscular nerves to the coccygeus and to the levator ani. The perforating- cutaneous branch runs in the angular interval between the great and lesser sacro-sciatic ligaments, and then, perforating the former ligament, runs between it and the gluteus maximus. It then winds round the border of that muscle, behind the ischio-rectal fossa, and supplies the integument covering the lower and inner part of the muscle (figs. 464, 466). The peringeal branch of the fourth sacral pierces the pelvic diaphragm, between the contiguous margins of the coccygeus and levator ani, and appears close to the tip of the coccyx. It is then directed forwards, and ends in twigs to the external sphincter ani and to the integument of the anus. The branches to the coccygeus and levator ani enter these muscles on their deep or pelvic surface.THE NEBVOUS SYSTEM 854 COCCYGEAL PLEXUS The anterior primary division of the fifth sacral nerve divides into ascending and descending branches. The ascending branch unites with the descending branch of the fourth sacral. The descending branch joins the coccygeal nerve. In this manner two small Ioo^ds are formed : these loops constitute the coccygeal plexus. Anterior and posterior branches are given off by the plexus. The anterior branches join the hypogastric plexus (Testut). The posterior branches pierce the j coccygeus muscle, and are distributed to the skin covering the posterior surface of j the coccyx. The coccygeal nerve gives a twig to the coccygeus and (according to i Testut) gives off a branch which pierces the great sacro-sciatic ligament and ends | in the lower fibres of the gluteus maximus. j I I SACRAL PLEXUS i ! The sacral plexus, with the exception of the roots of the lumbo-sacral cord, is | situated in the pelvis, behind the parietal pelvic fascia. It lies, for the most part, , on the pyriformis, the fibres of that muscle often interlacing with the roots of the i plexus. It is formed as follows : a part of the fourth lumbar joins the fifth lumbar j to form the lumbo-sacral cord ; this cord is then joined by the first, second, and \ third sacral nerves to form a great flattened band. This band is directed outwards and downwards towards the lower margin of the great sacro-sciatic foramen, and, on crossing that margin, is no longer called the sacral plexus, but takes the name : of the great sciatic nerve. A part of the fourth sacral nerve is joined by branches < from the second and third sacral nerves to form a second or lower band of relatively small size, Avhich ends in the pudic nerve. Several branches, to be presently enumerated, spring from the plexus; but by far the larger part of the plexus is directly continued into the great sciatic and pudic nerves. The plexus is, therefore, more condensed and more simple in its formation than any other plexus in the body. The two constituents of the lumbo-sacral cord unite to form that structure on, or a little below, the brim of the pelvis. The plexus has the following important vascular relations : the internal iliac vessels are placed a little in front of its upper part; the gluteal artery passes between the lumbo-sacral cord and the first sacral nerve ; the sciatic artery passes through the lower part of the plexus (fig. 466). It has been shown (Paterson) that the anterior primary divisions of the lower four lumbar and the upper two sacral nerves divide into anterior and posterior parts. The branches derived fi-om the anterior parts (lightly shaded in fig. 465) always cross in front of the posterior parts and unite to form trunks (e.g. obturator, internal popliteal), which are distributed to what is morphologically the anterior aspect of the limb. The trunks which are formed from the posterior parts (e.g. external cutaneous, anterior crural, external popliteal) are distributed to the (morphologically) posterior aspect of the limb; these nerves are darkly shaded in fig. 465. The branches of the sacral plexus are classified into collateral and terminal. The collateral branches are the superior gluteal, the inferior gluteal, the nerve to the pyriformis, visceral branches, the nerve to the quadratus, the small sciatic, and the nerve to the obturator internus. The terminal branches are the great sciatic and the pudic nerves. COLLATEKAL BRANCHES.—1. The superior gluteal nerve arises by two roots, one from the lumbo-sacral cord, and the other from the first sacral nerve. The upper root contains fibres derived from the fourth and fifth lumbar nerves. The nerve accompanies the gluteal vessels through the great sacro-sciatic foramen, passing above the pyriformis. It then accompanies the deep division of the gluteal artery into the interval between the gluteus medius and gluteus minimus, and,BBANCHES OF THE SACBAL PLEXUS 855 having supplied both these muscles, ends in a branch which pierces the outer I fibres of the gluteus minimus, and supplies the tensor fasciae femoris. 2. The inferior gluteal nerve arises from the posterior aspect of the plexus, and ! contains fibres derived from the second and third sacral nerves. It escapes through the great sacro-sciatic foramen, below the pyriformis, and in this situation is often 'adherent to the small sciatic nerve. It divides into several stout twigs, which enter the deep surface of the gluteus maximus. Fig. 465.—Diagram of the Lumbar and Sacral Plexuses. (Modified from Paterson.)

It then runs downwards on the posterior surface of the great sciatic nerve, under cover of the gluteus maximus muscle, to which it furnishes a branch. This branch is probably a portion of the inferior gluteal nerve, which has adhered in a part of its course to the small sciatic. It then runs vertically down the middle of the posterior aspect of the thigh, beneath the fascia lata, crosses the popliteal space, and pierces the deep fascia a little below the knee, to end in the integument of the upper part of the calf, where it mayBEAN CHE S OF THE SACBAL BLEXUS 857 communicate with the external saphenous nerve. In its course clown the thigh it gives off numerous branches, which pierce the fascia lata to supply the skin covering the back of the thigh and the popliteal space. At the lower border of the gluteus maximus it gives off' (a) reflected branches, and (b) a large branch termed the long pudendal nerve. (a) The reflected branches, three or four in number, wind round the lower border of the gluteus maximus, and, having pierced the deep fascia, supply the integument covering the lower and outer part of that muscle. (b) The long pudendal nerve, or nerve of Soemmerring, winds round the origin of the hamstring muscles, just below the ischial tuberosity, giving twigs to the integument on the inner and upper part of the thigh, and then curves upwards and forwards towards the external genitals.

In the female it is distributed in a similar manner to the labium majus. 7. The nerve to the obturator internns arises from the second and third nerves, and is often united in a plexiform manner with the pudic. It passes through the great sacro-sciatic foramen, below the pyriformis, and crosses the base of the ischial spine, being placed on the outer side of the pudic vessels. Having furnished a twig to the superior gemellus, it enters the lesser sacro-sciatic foramen, and ends in the obturator internus. TERMINAL BEANCHES.—1. The pudic nerve arises by three roots from the second, third, and fourth sacral nerves, and escapes from the pelvis by passing through the great sacro-sciatic foramen, below the pyriformis. It then crosses the posterior surface of the small sacro-sciatic ligament, near the attachment of that ligament to the spine of the ischium, and to the inner side of the pudic vessels. It then accompanies the pudic vessels through the small sacro-sciatic foramen, and enters aTHE NEBVOUS SYSTEM 858 canal formed by a clelamination of the parietal pelvic fascia (Alcock's canal), and, having given off the inferior haemorrhoidal nerve, terminates by dividing into the peringeal nerve and the dorsal nerve of the penis. At its origin, the pudic nerve is often connected in a plexiform manner with the nerve to the obtm^ator internus. (a) The inferior haemorrhoidal nerve pierces the wall of Alcock's canal, and passes inwards through the fatty tissue which occupies, the ischio-rectal fossa. It is deeply placed at the outer part of the fossa, but becomes superficial as it approaches the anus. It divides into terminal twigs, some of which supply the external sphincter ani, while others are distributed to the adjacent integument. (b) The perinaeal nerve runs for a short distance in Alcock's canal at a lower level than the pudic vessels, and then divides into cutaneous and muscular divisions. The cutaneous division takes the form of two nerves, which are termed posterior and anterior superficial perinaeal nerves. The posterior or external superficial perinaeal nerve escapes from Alcock's canal at the anterior part of the ischio-rectal fossa, and, winding round the transverse perinaeal muscle, passes forwards under cover of Colles's fascia. It then divides into several long slender twigs, which communicate with the anterior superficial perinseal and long pudendal nerves, and end in the integuments of the scrotum. In the female they are distributed in a similar manner to the labium majus. The anterior or internal superficial perinaeal nerve appears a little further forwards than the preceding nerve, and usually passes through the fibres of the transverse perinaeal muscle. Its terminal offsets accompany the branches of the posterior perinaeal nerve, and have a similar distribution. The muscular division of the perinaeal nerve is more deeply placed than the cutaneous division. It breaks up into the following branches : a twig to the bulb of the urethra, and branches to supply the transversus perinaei, erector penis (or clitoridis), accelerator urinae (or sphincter vaginae), and compressor urethrae muscles. (c) The dorsal nerve of the penis, which is placed at its origin below the pudic artery, crosses that vessel and courses along above it. It then insinuates itself between the layers of the triangular ligament and lies close to the bone at the outer side of the pudic vessels. It then pierces the anterior layer of the triangular liga- ment, and, having furnished a branch to the corpus cavernosum, passes between the bone and the crus penis. It is then directed downwards on the dorsum penis external to the dorsal artery. Having given off twigs to the prepuce, it ends in branches to the glans. As it runs on the dorsum penis the nerve is under cover of a thin strong fascia, and often appears in the form of two or three flattened parallel bundles. The dorsal nerve of the clitoris is distributed in a similar manner to the dorsal nerve of the penis, but is of much smaller size. 2. The Great Sciatic Neeve The GREAT SCIATIC NERVE is the largest nerve in the body. It is, as above mentioned, the main termination of the sacral plexus, and commences at the lower border of the great sacro-sciatic foramen. It is directed vertically down the thigh, and terminates a little below the middle of the thigh by dividing into the external and internal popliteal nerves. In this course it is covered by the skin and fasciae, the gluteus maximus and biceps muscles, and the small sciatic nerve. Its deep or anterior relations are the following, taken in order from above downwards: the ischium, gemellus superior, tendon of obturator internus, gemellus inferior, quadratus femoris, and adductor magnus. Branches.—The great sciatic nerve gives off branches in the thigh which supply the hamstring muscles, and (in part) the adductor magnus. The nerve to the semi-tendinosus usually arises from a more proximal part of the great sciatic thanEXTEBNAL POPLITEAL NEBVE 859 the other branches. Each head of the biceps is supplied with a separate branch. The branches to the semi-membranosus and adductor magnus arise by a common trunk. In some cases the external and internal popliteal nerves arise separately from the sacral plexus, a great sciatic nerve in the proper sense of the word being absent. In such cases the nerves to the hamstrings are derived from the internal popliteal nerve. (Paterson.) The EXTERNAL POPLITEAL NERVE enters the superior angle of the popliteal space, and runs downwards and outwards in contact with the inner border of the biceps. It leaves the space by passing between the biceps tendon and the outer head of the gastrocnemius. It then winds round the neck of the fibula between the bone and the peroneus longus muscle, and terminates by dividing into the recurrent articular, the musculo-cutaneous, and the anterior tibial nerves. Branches.—The branches of the external popliteal nerve may be classified into articular, cutaneous, and terminal. (1) The articular branches accompany the superior and inferior external articular branches of the popliteal artery, and are distributed to the knee joint. [ (2) The cutaneous branches are two in number, and often arise by a common trunk. One of these is distributed to the skin covering the outer and upper part of the leg. The other branch is termed nervus communicans peronei. It runs down- wards and inwards beneath the deep fascia, and joins the nervus communicans I tibialis to form the external or short saphenous nerve (page 861). (3) The recurrent articular nerve ends principally in the upper part of the I tibialis anticus muscle. A few fine filaments accompany the anterior tibial recurrent artery to the front of the knee joint. (4) The musculo-cutaneous nerve is directed downwards through the substance of the peroneus longus, and is afterwards placed between the peroneus longus and I peroneus brevis muscles. Having given off branches to supply these muscles, it ! divides into an external and an internal branch; these branches pierce the deep fascia in the line of the intermuscular septum between the peronei and the extensor group of muscles. The external branch runs downwards in front of the anterior annular ligament, and divides into the following branches : a twig which communicates with the short saphenous; a branch which divides to supply the adjacent sides of the fourth and fifth toes ; and a branch which communicates with I the internal division of the musculo-cutaneous nerve. The internal branch crosses the anterior annular ligament about an inch to the inner side of the external branch, and divides into four branches ; the first of these communicates with the external branch, forming with it a nerve which bifurcates to supply the adjacent 1 sides of the third and fourth toes ; the second divides to be distributed to the con- tiguous sides of the second and third toes ; the third communicates with the internal ]! terminal branch of the anterior tibial at the cleft between the great and second [ toes ; and the fourth supplies the inner border of the great toe. From the two main divisions of the nerve a number of collateral twigs are 1 given off, which supply the integument of the lower part of the front of the leg and I the dorsum of the foot. ' (5) The anterior tibial nerve pierces the intermuscular septum between the peronei and extensors, and, having traversed the upper fibres of the extensor longus digitorum, runs downwards on the interosseous membrane between the last-named muscle and the tibialis anticus ; lower down it is placed between the tibialis anticus I and the extensor longus hallucis. Finally it passes under cover of the anterior i annular ligament, and terminates in front of the bend of the ankle by dividing into j an external and an internal branch. In this course it is placed external to the I anterior tibial artery in the upper fourth of the leg, but lies on the anterior ' surface of that vessel in the remainder of its course. ITHE NERVOUS SYSTEM 860 Branches.—In addition to the two terminal branches above mentioned, the raiterior tibial nerve gives off an articular twig to the ankle joint, and branches Fig. 468.—Distribution of the Musculo-cutaneous and Anterior Tibial Nerves ON THE Anterior Aspect of the Leg and on the Dorsum of the Foot.

The branches destined for the two latter muscles arise in861 INTEBNAL POPLITEAL NERVE common, and take the form of a long slender nerve which runs along the inner side of the muscles, supplying them with numerous twigs. The external branch is directed outwards under cover of the extensor brevis digitorum, and, having supplied that muscle, ends in twigs which are distributed to the tarsal articulations. This nerve presents a gangliform enlargement near its commencement, thus resembling the anterior interosseous nerve in the superior extremity. The internal branch is directed forwards towards the interval between the first and second toes, where it is joined by a twig from the musculo-cutaneous, and then divides to supply the contiguous margins of the above-mentioned toes. In its course on the dorsum pedis it lies to the outer side of the dorsal artery of the foot, and it is crossed on its superficial surface by the innermost division of the extensor brevis digitorum. The INTERNAL POPLITEAL NEEVE is larger than the peroneal nerve, and runs downwards, following the same direction as the great sciatic, to reach the lower border of the popliteus muscle, where it is continued into the posterior tibial nerve. In this course it occupies the middle vertical diameter of the popliteal space, and is the most superficially placed of the important contents of that space. It is overlapped by the hamstring muscles above and by the heads of the gastrocnemius below ; but is covered only by the skin and fasciae for about two inches above the line of the knee joint. The popliteal vein intervenes between the internal popliteal nerve and the artery, and the nerve is on a plane superficial to the vessels. In the upper part of the popliteal space the vessels are internal to the artery ; at the level of the knee joint they are immediately in front of the nerve ; and at the lower part of the space they are placed external to it. Branches.^—The branches of the internal popliteal nerve may be classified into cutaneous, articular, muscular, and terminal. (1) The cutaneous branch is termed nervus communicans tibialis. It arises from the internal pox^liteal about the centre of the popliteal space, and runs vertically downwards, under cover of the deep fascia, to reach the interval between the two heads of the gastrocnemius ; then, inclining a little outwards, it pierces the deep fascia, and unites with the communicans fibularis to form the short saphenous nerve. (2) The external or short saphenous nerve is formed about the middle of the calf (sometimes higher up or lower down), and runs downwards and outwards, accompanied by the vein of the same name, to reach the interval between the external malleolus and the calcaneum. It then runs forwards along the outer border of the foot, supplying numerous twigs to the integument of the region. Having communicated with the external branch of the musculo-cutaneous, it terminates by supplying the integument on the outer side of the little toe. Varieties.—In a large mimber of cases the distribution of this nerve is much more extensive. It may supply the fifth and fourth toes and the outer border of the third. In some cases the communicans fibularis does not join the communicans tibialis, but ends independently in the integuments of the calf. (3) The muscular branches of the internal popliteal nerve are distributed to the gastrocnemius, soleus, plantaris, and popliteus muscles. There is a separate branch for each head of the gastrocnemius. The branch to the popliteus arises lower down than the other branches. It crosses the superficial surface of the popliteal artery to reach the outer side of that vessel, runs downwards on the posterior surface of the popliteus, and winds round the lower border of that muscle to gain its deep or anterior surface, where it ends in the muscular substance. (4) The articular branches are three in number, and accompany the superior and inferior internal articular and the azygos branches of the popliteal artery, to be distributed to the knee joint.THE NERVOUS SYSTEM 862 I The POSTERIOR TIBIAL NERVE is the terminal branch of the internal popliteal, or rather the direct continuation of that nerve. It runs downwards with an inclination inwards to reach the interval between the inner malleolus and the os calcis, and, having- passed under cover of the origin of the abductor hallucis muscle, terminates by dividing into the internal and external plantar nerves. In the upper part of its course it is covered by the gastrocnemius, plantaris, and soleus muscles, and by the intermuscular part of the deep fascia of the leg. Lower down, as it approaches the Fig. 469.—Superficial Nerves in the Sole of the Foot. (Ellis.) Abductor minimi digiti External plantar artery EXTERNAL PLANTAR NERVE DIGITAL COLLATERAL BRANCHES OF EXTERNAL PLANTAR DIGITAL COLLATERAL BRANCHES OF INTERNAL PLANTAR ankle, it is covered only by the skin and fasciae. Its anterior relations are the tibialis posticus in the upper, and the flexor longus digitorum in the lower part of its course. The posterior tibial vessels are placed externally to its upper part; about the middle of the leg they cross in front of the nerve, and run downwards parallel to its inner side. Branches.—The posterior tibial nerve supplies the three deep muscles of the calf, viz. the tibialis posticus, flexor longus digitorum, and flexor long as hallucis.863 SYMPATHETIC NEBVES It also furnishes one or two articular filaments to the ankle joint, and gives off a cutaneous branch, the internal calcanean. (1) The internal calcanean or calcaneo-plantar cutaneous branch arises from i the posterior tibial nerve a little above the level of the inner malleolus, and passes under cover of the internal annular ligament, where it divides into several branches. These branches pierce the internal annular ligament, accompanying the branches of the internal calcanean artery, and are distributed to the thick fascia and integu- ment which covers the heel and adjacent part of the sole. (2) The internal plantar nerve is the larger of the two terminal branches of the posterior tibial, and corresponds in its distribution to the median nerve in the hand. It runs forwards in the interval between the abductor hallucis and the flexor brevis digitorum ; gives off branches to supply both these muscles, and a number of cuta- j neous twigs which appear in the interval between the middle and internal parta of ! the plantar fascia. Near the level of the tarso-metatarsal articulation it terminates by dividing into four digital branches. The first dig^ital branch gives off a branch to supply the flexor brevis hallucis, and then runs along the inner side of the great I toe as far as the extremity of that digit. The second branch gives oft' a twig to supply the first or innermost lumbrical muscle, and then divides into two collateral ' branches which supply the adjacent sides of the great and second toes. The third branch divides in a similar manner to supply the contiguous sides of the second and third toes. The fourth branch communicates with the superficial division of the external plantar, and divides to supply the adjacent sides of the third and fourth toes. (3) The external plantar nerve shows many points of resemblance to the dis- tribution of the ulnar nerve in the hand. From its origin at the termination of the I posterior tibial nerve, it is directed outwards and forwards between the flexor brevis digitorum and the flexor accessorius. In this part of its course it supplies the j accessorius and the abductor minimi digiti. It is then directed forwards in the I interval between the last-named muscle and the flexor brevis digitorum, and termi- nates at the level of the tarso-metatarsal articulations by dividing into a superficial and a deep division. Previous to its division it gives off several cutaneous twigs, which appear in the interval between the middle and external divisions of the plantar fascia. The superficial division divides into two digital nerves, an external and an internal. The internal branch supplies the interosseous muscles which occupy the fourth interosseous space, and, having communicated with the internal plantar, divides into two collateral branches which supply the contiguous sides of j the third and fourth toes. The external branch supplies the flexor brevis minimi digiti, and is then directed along the outer border of the little toe to terminate at the extremity of that digit. The deep division of the external plantar nerve runs inwards and forwards on the dorsal or deep surface of the flexor tendons, and ramifies in the interval between these tendons and the interosseous muscles. It supplies the three outer lumbrical muscles, the interosseous muscles occupying the j three inner interosseous spaces, the transversus pedis, and the adductor hallucis. SYMPATHETIC NERVES The sympathetic nerves were formerly supposed to be a separate system, linked, it is true, to the cerebro-spinal system by numerous communications, yet possessing, in their ganglia, a certain governing power independent of the cerebro-spinal axis. It is now very generally admitted that the sympathetic nerves are merely the864 THE NEBVOUS SYSTEM visceral branches of the spinal nerves, but differ from the somatic nerves in the following respects: (a) in the individual fibres being of smaller calibre than the somatic nerve-fibres ; (b) in the great preponderance of non-medullated fibres; (c) in the fibres being interrupted in the nerve-cells, which are contained in a chain of ganglia which is called the gangliated cord of the sympathetic, and often also interrupted in secondary and tertiary ganglia, of which the semilunar ganglia and the nerve-cells in the plexuses of Auerbach and Meissner are examples; and (d) in the tendency that these nerves show to form extensive and closely-meshed plexuses. The somatic nerves are the nerves which supply the body-wall as distinguished from the viscera. They have been described above as the cranial and spinal nerves. Certain visceral nerves—for example, the visceral branches of the third and fourth sacral nerves—do not join the gangliated cord. While the sympathetic nerves, taken as a whole, can no longer be regarded as a separate system, certain ganglia connected with the sympathetic are capable of automatic action ; for example, the ganglia in the heart and in the intestinal walls. The sympathetic system, as usually described, consists of (a) a pair of gangliated cords which are placed on the front and sides of the vertebral column ; and (b) three great prevertebral plexuses. One of these, the cardiac plexus, is contained in the thoracic cavity. The other two, which are termed the solar and hypogastric plexuses, are placed in the abdominal cavity. The gangliated cords will be first described. GANGLIATED CORDS OF THE SYMPATHETIC ' J The gangliated cords of the sympathetic consist of a series of ganglia united together by intervening cords. These ganglia are of a reddish-grey colour, soft in consistence, but enclosed in tolerably firm investments of connective tissue. The nerve-cords uniting them are pearly grey in colour. Morphologically speaking, there should be thirty-one pairs of ganglia, that is to say, a pair corresponding to each pair of spinal nerves. We find, however, owing to the cohesion of certain ganglia, particularly in the cervical region, that the number is reduced to from twenty to twenty-three pairs. In the thoracic region the arrangement is the most typical, as here we find twelve pairs of ganglia corresponding to the twelve thoracic nerves. In the thoracic region, also, the arrangement of the rami communicantes is most easily studied. Each of the thoracic ganglia is connected to the corresponding spinal nerve by two rami communicantes, a white and a grey. The white ramus communicans consists of medullated fibres which enter the ganglion and pass through it towards the viscera. The grey ramus communicans or revehent nerve is formed of non-medullated fibres, and passes back from the ganglion to join the spinal nerve. It gives off afferent fibres which enter the spinal cord, and efferent fibres which join the somatic division of the spinal nerve, and are thus conveyed to the walls of the blood-vessels, forming vaso-motor nerves, and to the skin, where they are distributed to the sweat glands. Cranial portion of the sympathetic.—The small sporadic ganglia (ophthalmic, spheno- palatine, otic, and submaxillary), which have already been described in connection with the trigeminal nerve, are regarded by some anatomists as representing a cranial portion of the gangliated cord. CERVICAL POETION OF THE GANGLIATED CORD The cervical portion of the gangliated cord consists of three ganglia united by intervening nerve-cords. Of these the superior cervical ganglion is the largest, and probably represents four coalesced ganglia ; the middle cervical ganglion is the smallest, and represents two ganglia ; the inferior, intermediate in size, is probably865 SYMPATHETIC NEBVES 'ormed by the union of two ganglia. The cord takes a vertical course down the leck, and is in contact posteriorly with the prevertebral layer of the cervical fascia. Behind this fascia it corresponds to the rectus capitis anticus major above, and the ongus colli below. These muscles and the prevertebral fascia intervene between the cord and the transverse processes of the cervical vertebrae. The internal carotid fibove, and the common carotid artery below, are placed in front of the gangliated 3ord, and the pneumogastric nerve is external to it. I Superior Cervical Ganglion The superior cervical ganglion is a fusiform body, about one inch to an inch md a half in length. It corresponds to the transverse processes of the second and lihird (and sometimes the first) cervical vertebrae. Above, it is continued into a stout trunk which is called the ascending branch. Below, it ends in a cord which Dasses downwards to join the middle cervical ganglion. It is connected to the interior primary divisions of the four upper cervical nerves by as many rami com- municantes. Occasionally the number of rami is increased to five or six. The yanglion is occasionally constricted at intervals—these constrictions affording an ndication of the individual ganglia by the coalescence of which the superior . jervical ganglion is formed. ( Branches.—The branches of the superior cervical ganglion are the ascending pranch ; branches which follow the distribution of the external carotid artery (nervi noUes); branches of communication to cranial nerves ; pharyngeal nerves; and ;he superior cervical cardiac nerve. 1. The ascending branch enters the carotid canal in the temporal bone and iivides into a larger external branch which forms the carotid plexus, and a smaller internal branch which ends in the cavernous plexus. These plexuses communicate frequently with one another around the artery, and may be regarded as different parts of the same plexus rather than distinct plexuses. The carotid plexus is formed by repeatedly communicating branches, which [qUow the internal carotid artery in the carotid canal, keeping close to the outer side of that vessel. The following nerves arise from it : tympanic; great deep petrosal; and a communicating branch to the sixth nerve. (a) The tympanic branch (small deep petrosal) enters a minute canal (carotico- tympanic canal) in the temporal bone, by which it is conducted to the tympanic Iplexus (page 814). (b) The great deep petrosal nerve passes forwards and inwards through the cartilage which occupies the foramen lacerum medium, and unites with the great superficial petrosal to form the Vidian nerve (page 800). (c) The branches to the Gasserian ganglion are given off from the plexus as it [emerges from the carotid canal. (d) The branches to the sixth nerve are very distinct, and can be easily seen I when the cavernous sinus is opened. They join the abducens as it is crossing the outer side of the internal carotid artery. \ The cavernous plexus is placed on the inner side of the internal carotid artery near the pituitary body. Its terminal offsets follow the ophthalmic and cerebral branches of the internal carotid artery. In addition to these it gives off the following branches :— (a) Communicating branches to the third, fourth, and ophthalmic division of the fifth cranial nerves. {b) The sympathetic root of the lenticular ganglion. This root is usually in the form of several fine filaments which enter the ganglion at its posterior border. (c) Two or three fine twigs enter the pituitary body. 2. The nervi moUes are given off from the anterior part of the superior cervical 3KI 866 THE NEBVOUS SYSTEM Fig. 470.—The Cervical Portion of the Sympathetic and the Distribution OF the Pneumogastric Nerve, viewed from behind, (Krause.)

We have already noted, in the description of the fifth cranial nerve, that the otic and sub-i maxillary ganglia receive their sympathetic roots from plexuses of the sympathetic I867 CEBVICAL GANGLIONS which reach them vid the micldle meningeal and facial arteries respectively. In I addition to these roots to the ganglia, vaso-niotor branches, and twigs which enter ! the parotid gland, are given ofi. Other twigs, taking a downward direction, enter the intercarotic and thyroid bodies ; the latter follow the com^se of the superior thyroid vessels. 3. Communieating' branches to cranial nerves.—Branches of communication arise directly from the ganglion to join the vagus, glosso-pharyngeal, and hypo- glossal nerves. Communications are effected with the ganglia of the root and trunk of the vagus, and with the jugular and petrous ganglia of the glosso-pharyngeal. 4. The pharyngeal branches, four or five in number, pass downwards and inwards behind the external and internal carotid arteries to join the pharyngeal ' plexus. 5. The superior cervical cardiac nerve arises from the lower part of the j ganglion, or occasionally from the nerve-cord between the superior and middle cervical ganglia. The nerves of the two sides run a corresponding course in the neck, but differ in their arrangement in the thorax. In the neck, each nerve is , directed downwards on the prevertebral fascia in front of the longus colli muscle, and communicates with the upper cervical cardiac branch of the pneumogastric, with the middle cardiac nerve of the sympathetic, and mth the external laryngeal I and recurrent laryngeal nerves. On the right side the nerve passes in front of (occasionally behind) the sub- i clavian artery, and is directed along the innominate artery to reach the bifurcation ; of the trachea, in front of which it terminates in the deep cardiac plexus. On the left side the nerve is conducted into the thorax in front of the common carotid artery, and crosses in front (or rather to the left side) of the so-called j transverse part of the arch of the aorta in the interval between the trunk of the I vagus and its inferior cervical cardiac branch, and ends in the superficial cardiac plexus. Middle Cervical Ganglion The middle cervical ganglion is a small, somewhat triangular, ganglionic thickening of the cord of the sympathetic. It is situated at the point where the i cord crosses the inferior thyroid artery at the level of the sixth cervical vertebra. It is joined by rami communicantes from the fifth and sixth cervical nerves. It is connected below to the inferior cervical ganglion by the main cord of the sympa- thetic, which passes behind the subclavian artery, and by one or more nerve-cords which pass in front of that vessel, forming the ansa Vieussenii. The middle j cervical ganglion gives off branches to the thyroid body and the middle cardiac nerve. The branches to the thyroid body commumicate with the superior cardiac nerve, and proceed to the gland, following the branches of the inferior thyroid artery. The middle cardiac nerve enters the thorax, passing sometimes in front of the subclavian artery, and sometimes behind that vessel. It communicates in the neck with the upper cardiac nerve, and in the thorax with the recurrent laryngeal. It terminates in the deep cardiac plexus. Inferioe Cervical Ganglion The inferior cervical ganglion is larger than the middle ganglion, and is con- nected by short rami communicantes to the seventh and eighth cervical nerves. It is irregular in form and is deeply placed, being lodged in a depression between I the neck of the first rib and the transverse process of the seventh cervical vertebra. In this situation it is concealed by the vertebral artery, the vessel being placed in ( front of the ganglion. It is united to the first thoracic ganglion by one or two stout I 8 K 2868 THE NEBVOUS SYSTEM cords and often by a band of ganglionic substance. It gives off branches to the vertebral artery and the inferior cardiac nerve. The branches to the vertebral artery are of considerable size and accompany the vessel into the arterio-vertebral foramina in the transverse processes. The plexus thus formed is continued on the vertebral and basilar to the cerebral arteries. The inferior cardiac nerve communicates with the middle cardiac and recurrent laryngeal, and passes along the side of the trachea to join the deep cardiac plexus. It occasionally arises from the first dorsal ganglion. THOEACIC POETION OF THE GANGLIATED CORD The thoracic portion of the gangliated cord is represented by a chain of twelve pairs of ganglia. In a few cases, on account of the coalescence of some of the members of the series, the number may be reduced to eleven or ten pairs. The upper ten ganglia lie upon the heads of the corresponding ribs, immediately under cover of the pleura. The lower two are placed further forwards, and lie on the sides of the bodies of the eleventh and twelfth thoracic vertebrae between the bones and the diaphragm. The cord is continuous above with the cervical part of the cord, the first thoracic ganglion being sometimes united across the neck of the first rib with the inferior cervical ganglion. Below, the cord enters the abdominal cavity by passing through the crus of the diaphragm to become continuous with the lumbar part of the cord. The first thoracic ganglion (ganglion stellatum) is larger than the others, and is of an irregular form. The remainder of the series are triangular in outline, two of the angles being continued into the intergangiionic part of the cord, and the other into the rami communicantes. On some of the lower ganglia a fourth angle makes its appearance, and is continued into one of the roots of the splanchnic nerves. Branches.—The branches are classified into external and internal. The external branches are the rami communicantes. A grey and a white ramus communicans connects each ganglion with the corresponding thoracic nerve. The internal branches of the upper four ganglia are distributed chiefly to the aorta and lungs. The internal branches of the lower eight ganglia form three splanchnic nerves which are distributed to the abdominal viscera. Internal branches—Upper series.—From the upper four or five ganglia fine twigs arise which are distributed to the thoracic aorta, mediastinum, and lungs. Internal branches—Lower series.—These branches, although arising in the , thorax, are destined for the abdominal viscera. The branches from the fifth to the j ninth ganglia unite to form the great splanchnic nerve; the lesser splanchnic nerve arises by two roots from the tenth and eleventh ganglia, while the internal branch of the twelfth ganglion forms the smallest splanchnic nerve. GREAT SPLANCHNIC NEEVE.—The five roots of this nerve run downwards and inwards between the pleura and the bodies of the thoracic vertebrae, and unite within the posterior mediastinum to form a trunk of considerable size. The nerve thus formed pierces the crus of the diaphragm, and enters the semilunar ganglion of its own side. The great splanchnic nerve is whitish in colour, owing to a number of meduUated fibres entering into its composition. Occasionally a small ganglion (splanchnic ganglion) is developed upon it in the mediastinum. This ganglion is constant on the right side. (Cunningham.) The LESSER SPLANCHNIC NERVE runs a similar course to the great splanchnic, but at a lower level. It pierces the crus of the diaphragm, or passes through the internal arcuate ligament, and enters the solar and renal plexuses. The SMALLEST SPLANCHNIC NERVE passes through the internal arcuate ligament and enters the renal plexus.GBEAT PBEVEBTEBBAL PLEXUSES 869 LUMBAR PORTION OF THE GANGLIATED CORD The lumbar part of the gang^liated cord consists of a chain of ganglia, usually four in number, which are placed in front of the bodies of the vertebrae, close to the anterior border of the psoas muscle. On the right side the cord is covered by the vena cava, and on the left side it is behind and external to the aorta. Above, it is continuous Avith the thoracic part of the cord. Below, it is continued into the sacral part of the cord by passing behind the common iliac vessels. The rami communicantes are longer in this part of the gangliated cord than in any other region of the body. Usually two rami pass from each ganglion backwards through the fibrous arches from which the psoas takes origin, and join the lumbar nerves in a somewhat variable manner. In this course they are accompanied by the lumbar arteries. Branches.—Some of the branches join the aortic plexus ; others pass in front of the common iliac arteries to form the hypogastric plexus. SACRAL PORTION OF THE GANGLIATED CORD The sacral part of the gangliated cord consists of a chain of four small gangha, which is placed in front of the sacrum internal to the anterior sacral foramina. From the lowest of these ganglia, branches proceed on each side which converge to a median ganglion (ganglion impar) which is situated in front of the last piece of the sacrum or the first piece of the coccyx. These ganglia are connected in a somewhat irregular manner to the sacral nerves by rami communicantes. The rami communicantes are very short in this region. Branches.—From the upper sacral ganglia branches are given off which join the pelvic plexuses. Others pass across the sacrum to join corresponding branches from the cord of the opposite side. From the ganglion impar twigs pass down- wards to enter the coccygeal body. 1 THE GREAT PREVERTEBRAL PLEXUSES [ \ The great prevertebral plexuses, as we have already noticed, are the cardiac, I solar, and hypogastric. They are formed mainly by branches derived from the I gangliated cords, but also receive fibres from the cerebro-spinal nerves; thus the cardiac plexus and solar plexuses are joined by branches of the pneumogastric, and the hypogastric plexus is joined by branches of the third and fourth and sometimes the second sacral nerves. CARDIAC PLEXUS I We have already noticed that each pneumogastric nerve gives off two or \ three cervical cardiac branches and a thoracic cardiac branch, and that additional branches may spring from the recurrent laryngeal nerve. We have also seen that three cardiac nerves arise from the cervical sympathetic cord on each side. These nerves all proceed to the cardiac plexus, but their course and arrangement is extremely variable. It is very common to find the upper cervical cardiac branches I of the vagus and sympathetic unite to form a common trunk ; in other cases the I nerves branch and communicate with one another in a plexiform manner. The I cardiac plexus, although forming a continuous network of nerves, is for convenience ! divided into a superficial and a deep plexus. The superficial plexus is situated I immediately below the arch of the aorta, internal to the ductus arteriosus ; it receives the left superior cardiac nerve of the sympathetic and the left inferior cervical cardiac branch of the pneumogastric. The deep cardiac plexus is placed870 THE NEBVOUS SYSTEM in front of the bifurcation of the trachea between that structure and the transverse part of the aortic arch ; it receives all the other cardiac nerves. Superficial cardiac plexus.—The superior cardiac branch of the sympathetic and the inferior cervical cardiac branch of the vagus cross the so-called transverse part of the aortic arch on its left side, being placed between the artery and the left pleura. The nerves then enter the interval between the aortic arch and the bifurcation of the pulmonary artery, where they communicate Avith the deep cardiac plexus. A small ganglion (the cardiac ganglion of Wrisberg) is usually developed at the point of communication. Branches are furnished to the right coronary plexus and also to the left lung. The latter branches join the anterior pulmonary plexus. Deep cardiac plexus.—The deep cardiac plexus receives all the right cardiac nerves, and also the cardiac nerves of the left side, with the exception of the superior cervical cardiac of the sympathetic and the inferior cervical cardiac of the vagus. The plexus is placed in front of the bifurcation of the trachea, and gives off the following branches :—(a) Branches to the anterior pulmonary plexuses of both sides ; (b) the left coronary plexus; (c) branches to the right auricle; (d) communicating branches to the superficial cardiac plexus ; and (e) branches to the right coronary plexus. Right coronary plexus.—This plexus is formed by branches from both the superficial and deep cardiac plexuses. It follows the branches of the right coronary artery for a certain distance, beyond which the nerves diverge from the arteries, and run between the pericardium and the muscular substance of the heart. Finally they enter the muscular substance. Left coronary plexus.—This plexus arises from the deep cardiac plexus. It passes forwards between the left auricular appendix and the pulmonary artery, and accompanies the branches of the left coronary artery. SOLAR PLEXUS The solar plexus is placed in front of the commencement of the abdominal aorta. It is the largest of the prevertebral plexuses, and is formed by the two semilunar ganglia, and by a number of interlacing nerve-cords which surround the ganglia. Each semilunar ganglion is placed at the side of the coeliac axis, embracing the artery in its concavity. The upper and the lower extremities of the ganglia of opposite sides are connected to one another by nerve-cords, above and below the artery. In this manner the coeliac axis is surrounded by a neuro-ganglionic collar. From this neuro-ganglionic collar a number of branches arise which are joined by branches from the right vagus and by both small splanchnic nerves, and in this manner the solar plexus is formed. From the solar plexus a number of nerves arise which accompany the abdominal aorta and its branches, forming secondary plexuses, which take their names from the arteries they accompany. Semilunar ganglia.—These are a pair of reddish-grey, irregularly shaped bodies which rest on the crura of the diaphragm, close to the coeliac axis. The great splanchnic nerve on each side, after piercing the crus of the diaphragm, enters the outer, or convex, side of the corresponding ganglion. Coeliac plexus.—The coeliac plexus surrounds the coeliac axis, and divides into splenic, hepatic, and coronary plexuses. The splenic plexus, after receiving a communication from the right pneumo- gastric nerve, accompanies the splenic artery to the spleen. It gives off pancreatic and left gastro-epiploic plexuses. The hepatic plexus is joined, near the pyloric end of the stomach, by branches from the left pneumogastric, and accompanies the hepatic artery to the liver, where it divides into right and left hepatic plexuses. Previous to its division, it gives offSOLAB PLEXUS 871 pyloric, right gastro-epiploic, and pancreatico-duodenal plexuses. From the right hepatic plexus a cystic plexus is furnished to the gall-bladder. The coronary plexus follows the lesser curvature of the stomach, proceeding from left to right. In this course it is joined by branches from the left pneumo- gastric, and, after giving off numerous twigs to the stomach, ends, near the pylorus, by joining the pyloric plexus. I The diaphragmatic plexuses arise from the upper extremities of the semilunar gangha, and accompany the diaphragmatic arteries to the under surface of the diaphragm. On the right side a communication is effected with the phrenic nerve, a small ganglion (ganglion diaphragmaticum) being formed at the point of commu- nication. The suprarenal plexuses are derived, in part from the diaphragmatic, in part from the solar, and in part from the renal plexuses ; they are distributed chiefly to the medullary portions of the suprarenal bodies. The renal plexuses are formed by branches of the solar and aortic plexuses, j and are joined posteriorly by the smallest splanchnic nerves. Each renal plexus I surrounds the corresponding renal artery, and enters the hilum of the kidney, where it subdivides in the fatty tissue which occupies the sinus, and enters the substance of the kidney with the blood-vessels. The superior mesenteric plexus is of large size, and is remarkable for the comparatively white colour of the nerves which compose it. It is derived from I the solar plexus, and, after emerging from under cover of the pancreas, closely I surrounds the trunk of the superior mesenteric artery. In this situation a few j ganglia (ganglia mesenterica) are formed. Having given off branches, which accompany the colica media, colica dextra, and ileo-colic arteries, the greater part of the plexus enters the mesentery, where the nerves—no longer closely following the blood-vessels, spread out between the layers of the mesentery, and eventually j reach the small intestine. I The aortic plexus is in the form of two vast networks of nerves which are massed along the sides of the abdominal aorta, and are connected by commu- nicating branches which pass across the front of the great vessel. It is formed I mainly by the downward continuation of the solar plexus, but receives strong reinforcements from the upper three lumbar ganglia. It gives off the spermatic and inferior mesenteric plexuses, and terminates below in strong branches to the hypogastric plexus. The inferior mesenteric plexus is much smaller than the superior mesenteric plexus, but, like the latter, is remarkable for its whitish colour. It is derived from the aortic plexus, and is conveyed by the branches of the inferior mesenteric artery I to the descending colon, the sigmoid flexure, and to the upper part of the rectum. In the latter situation it communicates with the pelvic plexuses. ; The spermatic plexus is derived from the aortic and renal plexuses. It accom- panies the spermatic artery as far as the internal abdominal ring, where it is joined j by a fine plexus derived from the pelvic plexus and accompanying the vas deferens. [ Thus reinforced, it is conducted by the spermatic cord to the testicle. ; In the female it accompanies the ovarian vessels to the ovary and uterus. [ HYPOGASTEIC PLEXUS From the lower ganglia of the lumbar sympathetic cord, two or three strong I branches proceed which cross obliquely in front of the common iliac arteries. These nerves are joined by stout offsets from the aortic plexus, and interlace in front of the body of the fifth lumbar vertebra with the corresponding nerves of the opposite side to form a broad flattened band, which is termed the hypogastric plexus. This plexus is remarkable in that it contains little or no ganglionic matter. It soon [ divides into two lateral portions, the pelvic or inferior hypogastric plexuses.

In this manner the pelvic plexuses are formed. Each pelvic plexus gives off branches to the pelvic viscera; these branches, in the greater part of their course, follow the arteries of the pelvis. We distinguish middle hsemorrhoidal, vesical, prostatic, and (in the female) vaginal and uterine plexuses. The middle hsemorrhoidal plexuses form a closely-meshed expansion on the sides of the rectum; they communicate above with branches from the inferior mesenteric plexus, and below with the inferior hsemorrhoidal branches of the pudic nerve. The vesical plexus is chiefly formed by fibres derived from the third and fourth sacral nerves. The nerves pass forwards on each side of the bladder, and divide into two groups—a superior group, which supplies the upper two-thirds of the bladder; and an inferior group, which is distributed to the lower third of that viscus. In the male, branches are given off to the vesiculffi seminales and vasa deferentia. The nerves to the vas deferens form a slender plexus which accom- panies that structure as far as the internal abdominal ring, where it unites with the spermatic plexus. The prostatic plexus is placed a little lower down than the vesical plexus, of which it is in some measure a continuation. The nerves which pass to it are of relatively large size, and are massed on the sides of the organ, where several ganglionic masses, from one-eighth to a quarter of an inch in length (ganglia prostatica of Miiller), are developed. From the prostatic plexus, offsets are furnished to the vesiculae seminales, and also branches to the erectile structures of the penis ; the latter branches are called cavernous nerves. The small cavernous nerves are several fine twigs which pierce the layers of the triangular ligament and the muscular structures which surround the membranous portion of the urethra. They enter the corpora cavernosa just in front of the subpubic ligament. The large cavernous nerve takes a similar course through the triangular liga- ment, and runs forwards on the dorsum penis as far as the middle of the organ, where it communicates with the dorsal nerves of the penis. It ends in twigs to the corpus cavernosum. In the female there are similar nerves, but of much smaller size, distributed to the clitoris. The vaginal plexus is formed largely by branches from the sacral nerves. It ramifies on the sides of the vagina, giving off twigs to the erectile substance, and to the mucous membrane. A few fine twigs pass forwards to reach the clitoris. The uterine plexus accompanies the uterine artery between the layers of the broad ligament, and, having received communicating twigs from the ovarian plexus, enters the muscular substance. In the gravid uterus this plexus is increased in size, chiefly on account of an hypertrophy of the connective tissue sheaths of the nerves.SECTION VI ORGANS OF SPECIAL SENSE I THE EYE By E. MAECUS GUNN, M.A., P.E.C.S. STJEGEOX TO THE ROYAL LONDON OPHTHALMIC HOSPITAL, MOOBPrELDS ; ASSISTANT OPHTHALMIC SURGEON TO UNl-STERSITY COLLEGE HOSPITAX. THE EYEBALL AND ITS SUEEOUNDINGS Genekal Surface View This examination is to be made prior to any disturbance of the parts, and is, indeed, best conducted on the hving body. A pocket magnifying lens should be at hand for use when required. THE two eyes are situated nearly in the line where the upper and middle thirds of the face meet; they lie right and left of the root of the nose, the most j prominent part of the front of each globe being about an inch and a quarter from j the middle line of the face. Each eye is overshadowed by the corresponding I eyebrow, and is capable of being concealed by its eyelids, upper and lower. ■ The orbital margin may be traced all round with the finger. At the junction of j the inner and middle thirds of the upper margin, the supraorbital notch can usually I be felt, and the supraorbital nerve passing through it can sometimes be made to roll i from side to side under the finger. The inner margin is the most difficult to trace I in this way, partly because it is more rounded off than the others, partly because 'j it is bridged over by a firm fibrous band (tendo oculi, or inner palpebral ligament), | passing inwards from the eyelids ; below this band, however, a sharp bony crest is I felt, which lies in front of the lachrymal sac. Note how the eye is protected by the | rim of the orbit, above and below; if we lay a hard flat body over the orbital opening, j it will rest upon the upper and lower bony prominences, and will not touch the 1 surface of the globe. Inwards, the eye is protected from injury mainly by the | bridge of the nose; outwards it is most readily vulnerable, as here the orbital rim ! is comparatively low. With one finger placed over the closed upper lid, now press j the eyeball gently backwards into the orbit, and observe the elastic resistance met | with, due to the fact that the globe rests posteriorly on a pad of fat. \ The space between the free edges of the upper and lower lids is known as the | palpebral aperture: it is a mere sht when the lids are closed; but when they are open j its shape is, roughly, that of an almond lying with its long axis horizontal, and ! about thirty millimetres in length.THE EYEBALL AND ITS SUBBOUNDINGS 875 When the eyes are directed to an object straight in front of them, this aperture is about twelve milhrnetres wide, but its width varies with upward and downward movements of the eyeball, being greatest on looking strongly upwards, diminishing gradually as the eye looks progressively lower. The angles formed by the meeting of the lids at each end of the palpebral aperture are named respectively the outer and inner canthus, of which the outer, or temporal, is sharp, while the inner, or nasal, is rounded off. On a closer inspection, it will be found that, for the last five milli- metres or so before reaching the inner canthus, the edges of the lids run an almost parallel course, and are here devoid of lashes. Through the open palpebral aperture the front of the eyeball comes into view, extending quite to the outer, but not reach- ing as far as the inner, canthus; just within the latter we find a small reddish prominence, the lachrymal caruncle ; and between this and the eyeball a fold of conjunctiva known as the plica semilunaris. While the eye is open, press one finger on the skin, a little beyond the outer canthus, and draw it firmly outwards from the middle line; observe that the upper lid then falls over the eyeball, and that the outline of a firm band already referred to (the tendo oculi) becomes evident, passing between the inner canthus and the nose. The falling of the lid is caused by our dragging upon a ligament (the outer palpebral) to which the outer end of its tarsus is attached, and so putting the lid itself upon the stretch. If, while the eyeball is directed downwards, we place one finger on the outer end of the upper eyelid and draw it forcibly upwards and outwards, we can usually cause the lower division of the lachrymal gland to present just above the outer canthus. The upper eyelid is much broader than the lower, extending upwards as far as the eyebrow. The skin covering it is loosely attached to the subjacent tissues above, but more firmly below, nearer the free margin, where it overlies a firm fibrous tissue called the tarsus. When the eye is open, a fold is present at the upper border of this latter more tightly applied portion of skin, called the superior palpebral fold, and by it the lid is marked off into an upper or orbital, and a lower or tarsal, division. The presence of the tarsus can be readily appreciated on our pinching horizontally the entire thickness of the eyelid below the palpebral fold. The lower eyelid is similarly divided anatomically into a tarsal and an orbital part, but the demarcation is sometimes unrecognisable on the surface, though there is usually here also a fold or groove (the inferior palpebral) visible when the eye is widely opened. There is no precise limit of this lid below, but it may be regarded as extending to the level of the lower margin of the orbit. Numerous very fine short hairs are seen on the cutaneous surface of both eyelids. The free margin of each lid has two edges—(a) An outer, or anterior, rounded edge, along which the stiff eyelashes, or cilia, are closely placed in several rows; and (b) a sharp posterior edge, which is applied to the surface of the globe. The lashes of both eyelids have their points turned away from the palpebral aperture, so that the upper ones curve upwards, and the lower downwards; the cilia of the upper lid are the stronger, and those in the middle of each row* are longer than those at each end. Between the two edges just described, the lid-margin has a smooth surface, on which we observe a single row of minute apertures, which are the openings of large modified sebaceous glands (the Meibomian follicles); it is by these glistening, well-lubricated surfaces that the opposite lids come into apposition when they are closed. The sharp posterior edge of the lid-margin marks the situation of the transition of skin into mucous i membrane. Not far from the inner end of this edge we find a prominence, the I lachrymal papilla, on the summit of which is a small hole (lachrymal punctum), I the opening of the canaliculus for the passage of tears into the lachrymal sac. The ' lower punctum is rather larger than the upper, and is placed further from the inner canthus. If we now examine the inner surface of the eyelids—e.g. of the lower—we observe that it is lined by a soft mucous membrane, the palpebral conjunctiva.OBGANS OF SPECIAL SENSE 876 Over the tarsal part of the lid, the conjunctiva is closely adherent, but beyond this it is freely movable along with the loose submucous tissue here present. On tracing it backwards, we find that it covers the whole inner surface of the lids, and is then continued forwards over the front of the eyeball, forming the ocular conjunctiva; the bend it makes as it changes its direction here is called the conjunctival cul-de- sac, or fornix. Numerous underlying blood-vessels are visible through the palpebral conjunctiva, and beneath the tarsal part of it we can see a series of nearly straight, parallel, light yellow lines, arranged perpendicularly to the free margin of the lid— the Meibomian follicles. The conjunctiva over the outer and inner fourths of each lid is not quite so smooth as elsewhere, and is normally of a deeper red colour; we shall find later that there are glands well developed in these positions. When the eyelids are opened naturally, we see through the palpebral aperture the following: the greater part of the transparent cornea, and behind it the coloured iris with the pupil in its centre ; white sclerotic to the outer and inner sides of the cornea ; the semilunar fold and lachrymal caruncle at the inner canthus. The extent of the eyeball visible in this way varies according to its position. Thus, with the eyes looking straight forwards, the lower margin of the upper lid is nearly opposite to the top of the cornea, or, more strictly, to a line midway between the Fig. 472.—View of Eyeball, etc., obtained on drawing the Lids forcibly apart. (After Merkel, slightly modified.) ■CONJUNCTIVAL FORNIX top of the cornea and the upper border of the pupil, while the lower lid corresponds with the lower corneal margin. When the eyes are directed strongly upwards, the upper lid is relatively on a slightly higher level, as it is simultaneously raised, but the lower lid now leaves a strip of sclerotic exposed below the cornea. On looking downwards, the upper lid covers the upper part of the cornea as low down as the level of the top of the pupil, while the lower lid is about midway between the pupil and the lower corneal border. If we draw the eyelids forcibly apart, we expose the whole cornea, and a zone of sclerotic about eight and a half millimetres in breadth above and below, and ten millimetres in breadth to the outer and inner sides, altogether about one-third of the globe ; all the eyeball thus exposed is covered by the ocular conjunctiva. Over the sclerotic the conjunctiva is freely movable, and through it we see superficial blood-vessels that can be made to slip from side to side along with it (conjunctival vessels). Occasionally other deeper vessels may also be seen which do not move with the conjunctiva, but are attached to the sclerotic (anterior ciliary arteries and veins). Near the corneal border the conjunctiva ceases to be freely movable, and it is closely adherent to the whole anterior surface of the cornea, giving the latter its characteristic bright, reflecting appearance; no blood-vessels are visible through it here in health. (When the lids are shut, the space enclosed between their posteriorTHE EYEBALL AND ITS SUBBOUNDINGS 877 Till surfaces and the front of the eyeball is thus everywhere covered by conjunctiva, and is known as the conjunctival sac.) Not infrequently, the tendinous insertions of some or all of the recti muscles into the sclerotic may be seen through the conjunctiva, each insertion appearing as a series of whitish parallel lines running towards, but terminating about seven milli- metres from the corresponding corneal border. The cornea appears as a transparent dome, having a curvature greater than that of the sclerotic; the junction of the two unequally curved surfaces is marked by a shallow depression running around the cornea, known as the scleral sulcus. In outline the cornea is nearly circular, but its horizontal diameter is slightly greater than its vertical. Between it and the iris a space exists, whose depth we can estimate roughly by looking at the eye from one side; this space, or anterior chamber, is occupied by a clear fluid, the aqueous humour. Almost the whole anterior surface of the iris is visible, its extreme periphery only being concealed by sclerotic. In colour the iris varies greatly in different indivi- duals. Near its centre (really a little up and in) a round hole exists in the iris, the hlsbck 2ncjnl, whose size varies considerably in different eyes, and in the same eye according to temporary conditions, such as exposure to light, etc. In examining the surface-markings of ,the living iris, one of dark colom^ is to be preferred. Focal illumination will be found useful, for which purpose a second convex lens will be required. On the surface of the iris we see a number of ridges running more or less radially ; adjoining ones occasionally unite and interlace to some extent, so as to leave large depressed meshes at intervals. The ridges coming from the edge of the pupil, and those coming from the more peripheral part of the iris, meet in a zigzag elevated ridge, concentric with the pupil, and by this ridge the iris is roughly marked off into two unequal zones—an outer or ciliary, and an inner or pupillary —of which the latter is much the narrower. The border next the pupil is edged with small, roundish, bead-like prominences of a dark brown colour, separated from one another by depressions, so that it presents a finely notched contour. Not infre- quently, in a light-coloured iris, we may see the sphincter muscle through the anterior layers, in the form of a ring about one millimetre in breadth around the pupil. The ciliary zone may be described as consisting of three parts: (a) A comparatively smooth zone next the zigzag ridge; (b) a middle area, showing concentric but incompletely circular furrows ; (c) a small peripheral darker part, presenting a sieve-like appearance. On the floor of the large depressed meshes, or CTTjpts, parallel radial vessels can be traced, belonging to the iris-stroma. The zigzag line mentioned above corresponds to the position of the circulus arteriosus minor. Occasionally, especially in a light iris, superficial pigment spots of a rusty brown colour occur. If we are examining the living eye, the ophthalmoscope should now be used, so as to gain a view of the fundus. We can thus study the termination of the optic nerve, the distribution of the larger retinal vessels, etc. The general red reflex obtained from the fundus is due to the blood in a capillary network (chorio-capillaris) situated in the inner part of the choroid. To the nasal side of the centre of the fundus is a paler area of a disc shape corresponding to the intraocular end of the optic nerve, and known as the optic disc, or papilla. This optic disc is nearly circular, but usually slightly oval vertically ; it is of a light orange-pink colour, with a characteristic superficial translucency ; its outer third segment is paler than the rest from the nerve-fibres and capillaries here being fewer. About its centre we often observe a well-marked whitish depression or gap, formed by the dispersion of the nerve-fibres as they spread out over the fundus; at the bottom of this depression a sieve-like appearance may be seen, due to the878 OBGANS OF SPECIAL SENSE presence of the lamina cribrosa, which consists of a white fibrous tissue frame- work, with small, roundish, light-grey meshes in it, through which latter the nerve- fibre bundles pass. Also near the centre of the disc, the retinal blood-vessels first come into view, the arteries narrower in size and lighter in colour than the veins; they divide dichotomously as they are distributed over the fundus. The retina proper is so transparent as to be ophthalmoscopically invisible, but its pigment- epithelium gives a very finely granular or darkly stippled appearance to the general red reflex. In the centre of the fundus, and therefore to the outer side of the disc, the ophthalmoscope often shows a shifting halo of light playing round a horizontally oval, comparatively dark enclosed area ; this latter corresponds to the yellow spot region, and about its centre a small pale spot usually marks the position of the fovea centralis. Two structures visible at the nasal end of the palpebral aperture have been previously mentioned, and should now be examined more narrowly. The lachrymal caruncle is in reality an island of modified skin, and fine hairs can commonly be detected on its surface. On its outer side, separated from it by Fig. 473.—Left Fundus Oculi, as seen by direct Ophthalmoscopic Method. (After Fiichs.) LAMINA CRIBROSA FOVEA CENTRALIS PIGMENT AT OUTER BORDER OF DISC a narrow groove, is the semilunar fold of conjunctiva; it rests on the eyeball, 1 and is a rudiment of the third eyelid or nictitating membrane, present in birds ij and well represented in many other vertebrates. Examination of the Eyeball The eyeball of a cadaver should now be removed by snipping with scissors the conjunctiva near the corneal border, then cutting through the ocular muscles near their insertion into the globe, and finally dividing the optic nerve close to the sclerotic. The eyeball is almost spherical, but not perfectly so, mainly because its anterior, clear, or corneal segment has a greater curvature than the rest of the eye. Con- sidering it as a globe, however, we speak of an anterior and of a posterior pole ; the former corresponding to the middle of the front of the cornea, the latter to the middle of the posterior curvature. An imaginary straight line joining the two poles is called the antero-posterior or sagittal axis of the eyeball. The equator of the eye is that part of its surface which lies midway between the two poles. The sagittal axis of the globe is the greatest (about 24-5 mm.), the vertical equatorial j the least (about 23*5 mm.), and the transverse equatorial axis is intermediate in length (about 23*9), so that the eyeball is in reality an ellipsoid, flattened shghtly \ from above downwards. Again, if the globe is divided in its antero-posterior vertical iEXAMINATION OF THE EYEBALL 879 plane, the nasal division will be found to be slightly smaller than the temporal. The optic nerve joins the globe three or four millimetres to the nasal side of the posterior pole. The shape of the eye depends on, and is preserved by, the outermost tunic, formed conjointly by the cornea and sclerotic, the entire outer surfaces of which are now in view. The anterior or corneal part has been already examined. All round the cornea there remains a little adherent conjunctiva ; elsewhere, the sclerotic is directly exposed, except for some loose connective tissue which adheres to it, especially around the optic nerve entrance. In front of the equator we see the tendinous insertions of the four recti muscles. Behind the equator are the insertions of the two oblique muscles—that of the superior oblique tendinous, and further forwards ; that of the inferior more fleshy, and placed between the optic nerve and the external rectus. It is difficult to recognise the different recti muscles by their uisertions if we do not know whether the eye examined is a right or left one. To determine this we should hold the globe with the optic nerve towards us, and in the natural position with the superior oblique tendon uppermost. The mferior oblique tendon will now poin, to the side to which the eye belongs, and we can consequently determine the different recti muscles. Fig. 474.—Diagrammatic View of the Insertions of the Ocular Muscles. (After Merkel.) The internal rectus is inserted nearest (7 mm. from) the corneal border; the external rectus commonly, sometimes the superior, is inserted furthest from it (about 8 mm.). All the recti tendons are broad and thin, but that of the internal is the broadest (8 mm.) ; those of the external and inferior the narroAvest (6 mm.). The greatest interval between two neighbouring tendons is that between the superior and internal recti (about 12 mm.); the least is between the superior and external (7 mm.). The form of the lines of insertion of the different tendons varies considerably, the inferior being almost straight, the superior and external convex forwards, the internal further removed from the corneal border below than above. The insertions of the obliques are at more than double the average distance of the insertions of the recti from the corneal border. That of the superior oblique is found on the superior surface of the sclerotic, about sixteen millimetres from the corneal edge, in the form of a line sloping from before backwards and inwards. The inferior oblique has a long fleshy insertion lying between the external rectus and the optic nerve entrance ; the posterior end of the insertion, which is also the highest, is only about six millimetres from the optic nerve, and from this point it slopes forwards, outwards, and slightly downwards.OBGANS OF SPECIAL SENSE 880 Several small nerves and two arteries may be seen running forwards and ulti- mately perforating the sclerotic not far from the entrance of the optic nerve. The two arteries are the long posterior ciliary ; they both perforate the globe in the horizontal meridian, one on the outer, the other on the inner side. The short ciliary arteries are too small to be seen in an ordinary examination. The nerves are the long and short ciliary. Nearer the equator, the large venous trunks emerge; they can be traced for some distance in front of their exit as dark lines, running antero-posteriorly beneath the sclerotic. The optic nerve is seen in section, surrounded loosely by a thick outer sheath; in the centre of the nerve-section a small red spot indicates the position of the central retinal blood-vessels. For ordinary dissections eyes of the sheep, pig, or bullock should be obtained. Divide an eyeball into fore and hind halves by cutting through it in the equatorial plane. 1. Posterior hemisphere seen from in front. This is much the same view that the ophthalmoscope affords us. Unless the eye be very fresh, however, the retina will have lost its transparency, and will now present the appearance of a thin whitish membrane, detached in folds from the underlying coats, but still adherent at the optic disc. The vitreous jelly lying within the retinal cup may be torn away. In the human eye the retina next the posterior pole is stained yellow (macula lutea). On turning the retina over, a little pigment may be seen adhering to its outer surface here and there. Cut through the retina close to the optic disc all round and remove it; note how easily it is torn. We now see a dark brown surface, consisting of the retinal pigment layer, adherent to the inner surface of the choroid. Brush off the retinal pigment under water. The choroid thus exposed can for the most part be fairly easily torn away from the thick sclerotic, as a lymph-space Fig. 475.—Equatorial Section of Eyeball : Anterior Segment viewed from BEHIND. (After Merkel.) exists between them, but the attachment is firm around the optic nerve entrance, and also where the arteries and nerves join the choroid after penetrating the sclerotic. The choroid is darkly pigmented of a brown colour, with markings on its surfaces corresponding to the distribution of its large veins. The inner surface of the sclerotic is of a light brownish colour, mainly from the presence of a delicate pigmented layer, the membrana suprachoroidea, which adheres partly to it, partly to the choroid, giving to their adjacent surfaces a floccu- lent appearance when examined under water. 2. Anterior hemisphere viewed from behind.—The round opening of the pupil is visible in the middle, with the large clear crystalline lens lying behind it. The retina proper extends forwards a little way from our line of section, and then ends abruptly in a wavy line called the ora serrata, bej^ond which it is only represented by a very thin membrane (pars ciliaris retinae). Outside the periphery of the lens are a number of ciliary processes arranged closely together in a circle concentric with the pupil, and each radially elongated ; posteriorly they are continuous with numerous fine folds, also radial, which soon get very indistinct as they pass backwards, but reach almost to the ora serrata (plicae ciliares). Between the front of the ciliary processes and the edge of the pupil lies the iris. On removal of the retina the inner surface of all this region is seen to be darkly pigmented, but especially dark in front of the position of the ora serrata. Vitreous probably still adheres to the back of the lens, and by pulling upon it the lens can be removed along with its capsule and suspensory ligament; some pigment will now be found adhering to the front of the vitreous, torn from the ciliary processes, which are consequently now lighter in colour than before. The lens-capsule is transparent, and has a smooth glistening outer surface ; through it a greyish star-shaped figure may be observed on the anterior and posterior surfaces of the lens. The suspensory ligament is a transparent membrane attached to the capsule of the lens about its equator, and is best seen by floating the lens in water in a glass vessel placed on a dark ground. On opening the capsule we expose the lens PLIC/E CILIARES881 EXAMINATION OF THE EYEBALL itself, which is superficially soft and glutinous to the touch, but becomes firmer as we rub off its outer layers and approach its centre. Carefully tear the choroid and iris from the sclerotic: a firm adhesion exists just behind the corneal periphery. Their outer sm-face thus exposed is found to be also rather darkly pigmented (as far forward as the base of the iris at least), but it shows a white ring corresponding to the adhesion just mentioned, and a pale area behind this ring indicates the position of the ciliary muscle. On this sm-face numerous white nerve-cords are visible running forwards. Observe that the iris, the ciliary processes, etc., and the choroid are all different parts of the same ocular tunic—mere local modifications of it. Similarly the sclerotic and cornea are seen to blend together to form one outer coat. An eyeball should now be placed for half an hour in a freezing mixtm-e of crushed ice and salt. It will thus become quite hard, and should at once be divided into two parts by cutting it antero-posteriorly through the centre of the cornea and the oi)tic nerve. We thus gain another view of the relations of parts, the position of the lens between the aqueous and vitreous chambers, etc. On removing the lens, vitreous, and retina, and brushing off its pigment, the light markings corresponding to the choroidal veins (venae vorticosae) should be noted, and their distribution studied. Usually fom" vortices or fountain-like markings are found in the whole choroid, their points of junction situated at approximately equal distances from one another at about the line where the posterior and middle thirds of the globe meet. These sections should be kept for reference while following the further description of the ocular tunics. 1. The outer, fibrous coat of the eye is formed by the sclerotic and cornea, which pass into one another at the scleral sulcus. It consists throughout mainly of fine connective-tissue fibres, arranged in interlacing bundles, with small lymph- spaces at intervals between them. The naked-eye appearance of the two divisions of this fibrous coat is, however, quite different, the cornea being transparent, ^vhile the sclerotic is white and opaque. The sclerotic encloses the posterior five-sixths or so of the eyeball, but there is a hole in it at the entrance of the optic nerve (foramen sclerae), only partially bridged across by fibres from its inner layers forming the lamina cribrosa. The fibre-bundles composing the sclerotic are arranged more irregularly than in the cornea, and run mainly in two directions, viz. from before backwards, and circularly; the circular fibres are particularly well developed just behind the j sulcus. It is thickest (about 1 mm.) posteriorly, where it is strengthened chiefly I by the outer sheath of the optic nerve, and partly also by the tissue surrounding j the ciliary vessels and nerves. It becomes gradually thinner as it passes forwards, up to the line of insertion of the recti muscles, in front of which line it is again reinforced by their tendinous fibres becoming incorporated with it. In children the sclerotic is often so thin as to allow the underlying choroidal pigment to show through, appearing then of a bluish white. In the aged, again, it is sometimes yellowish. It always contains a few pigment cells, but these are in the deep layers, and only become visible externally where the sclerotic is pierced by vessels and nerves going to the choroid. It is itself almost non-vascular, but quite at its I anterior end a large venous sinus (canal of Schlemm) runs in its deeper layers ^ circularly around the cornea. Just in front of this sinus, at the corneal limbus, ! the sclerotic merges into the cornea, its deeper layers changing first, and finally the : superficial ones. The cornea is thickest at its periphery, and becomes gradually thinner towards its centre ; the curvature of its posterior is consequently greater than that of its anterior surface, but even the latter is more curved than the surface of the sclerotic. In the cornea proper, fibre-bundles are arranged so as to form a series of superposed lamellae, each of which is connected here and there to the adjacent ones by fibres passing from one to the other, so that they can only be torn apart with difficulty. The corneal lymph-spaces communicate with one another by very fine canals, and thus not only is a thorough lymph-circulation provided for, but the protoplasm with which these spaces are partially occupied may be also regarded as continuous throughout. It contains no blood-vessels, with the exception 3L882 OBGANS OF SPECIAL SENSE of a rich plexus at its extreme periphery, on which its nutrition is ultimately dependent. The most superficial part of the true cornea appears homogeneous, even when highly magnified (Bowman's memhrane), though there is reason to believe that its structure only differs from that already described in the closeness of its fibrous texture ; the two parts are certainly connected by fine fibres. Anteriorly, the cornea is covered by an extension of the ocular conjunctiva, in the form of an epithehum several layers deep. Posteriorly, the cornea is lined by a firm, thin, glass-like layer (membrane of Descemet, posterior elastic lamina), distinct from the corneal tissue both anatomically and chemically. At the periphery this membrane breaks up into a number of fibres, which mainly arch over to join the base of the iris (ligamentum pectinatum iridis). The interstices between these fibres constitute spaces (spaces of Fontana) freely communicating with the aqueous chamber on the one hand, and indirectly with the canal of Schlemm on the other. Descemet's membrane is in turn lined by a single layer of flat cells, which are continuous peripherally with cells lining the spaces of Fontana and the anterior surface of the iris. The cornea is richly supplied with nerves, particularly in its most superficial layers. 2. The dark, middle, or vascular coat of the eye, generally known as the uveal tract, is formed by the iris, ciliary body, and choroid. It is closely applied to the sclerotic, but actually joins it only at the anterior and posterior limits of their course together viz. at the scleral sulcus, and around the optic nerve entrance. In front of the sulcus the middle coat no longer lines the outer, being separated from it (i.e. the iris from the cornea) by a considerable space filled with fluid, called the anterior aqueous chamber. The uveal tract has two openings in it; a larger one in front, the pupil, and a smaller one behind, for the passage of the optic nerve. Its structure is that of a pigmented connective tissue, supporting numerous blood- vessels and containing many nerves and two deposits of smooth muscle-fibres. The choroid forms the posterior part of the uveal tract, and extends, with slowly diminishing thickness, forwards as far as the ora serrata. Its outer and inner surfaces are both formed by non-vascular layers ; that covering the outer, the membrana suprachoroidea, is pigmented, arranged in several fine loose lameUae, and has been seen in our dissection ; that covering the inner surface is a thin, transparent, homogeneous membrane, called the vitreous lamina of the choroid, or the membrane of Bruch. The intervening choroidal stroma is very rich in blood- vessels, which are of largest size next its outer surface, and become progressively smaller as we approach the vitreous lamina, next to which we find a layer of closely placed wide capillaries, called the chorio-capillaris. The pigment becomes less in amount as we pass inwards, and finally ceases, being absent entirely from the chorio-capillaris and vitreous lamina. In front of the ora serrata the uveal coat becomes considerably modified, and the part reaching from here to the iris may conveniently be termed the ciliary region of the tract, or ciliary body. Its superficial aspects have been already briefly described. In front, the ciliary processes, about seventy in number, project towards the interior of the eye, forming the corona ciliaris. Behind this part lies the orbiculus ciliaris, whose inner surface is almost smooth, faint radial folds only being present, three or four of which join each ciliary process. The more minute structure of this ciliary region resembles closely that of the choroid, except that the chorio-capillaris is no longer present, that the stroma is thicker and richer in blood-vessels, and that a muscular element (ciliary muscle) exists between the vascular layer and the membrana suprachoroidea. On antero-posterior section the ciliary body is triangular ; the shortest side looks forward, and from about its middle the iris arises ; the two long sides look respectively inwards and outwards, the inner haying the ciliary processes upon it, while the outer is formed by the ciliary muscle.EXAMINATION OF THE EYEBALL 883 This muscle possesses smooth fibres and consists of an outer and inner division; I in the outer the fibres run longitudinally, inserted into the outer fibrous coat of j the eye at the sclero-corneal junction in front, and passing backwards to join the outer layers of the orbiculus and choroid; the inner contains circularly running fibres situated next to the ciliary processes. The entire muscle is destitute of pigment, and therefore is recognisable in the section by its light colour. The whole thickening of the uveal tract in this region, muscle and folds and processes together, is named the ciliary body. The iris projects into the interior of the front half of the eye in the form of a circular disc perforated in the middle. The appearance of its anterior surface has Fig. 476.—Diagrammatic Horizontal Section of Eyeball and Orbit. (After Fuchs, much modified.)

Its posterior surface exhibits numerous radial folds running from the cihary processes to near the pupillary border; a thick layer of black pigment covers it and curls round its inner edge, so as to come into view all round the pupil as seen from in front. The peripheral or ciliary border of the iris is continuous with the front of the ciliary body, where it also receives fibres from the ligamentum pectinatum iridis ; in other respects the iris is quite free, merely resting on the front of the lens-capsule near the pupil. Its stroma is spongy in character, being made up of vessels covered by a thick adventitia, running from the periphery to the pupillary border, with interspaces filled by branching pigment cells, which are particularly abundant near the front surface. Deep in the stroma, running 3 L 2OBGANS OF SPECIAL SENSE 884 round near the pupillary border, we find a broad flat band of smooth muscle fibres, constituting the sphincter iridis. Immediately behind the vascular tissue lies a thin membrane, consisting of fine, straight fibres running radially from the ciliary border to just behind the sphincter. These fibres are often described as muscular, but in the absence of satisfactory evidence of their being of this nature, they are better regarded as elastic, the whole membrane serving to dilate the pupil on relaxation of the sphincter. Among mammals, radial muscle-fibres a,re present in the iris of the otter, and probably also in that of the rabbit; in all the others examined their existence is very doubtful. In birds the muscular system of the iris is of the striped variety, and many of the fibres certainly- run radially, so that the possibility of a muscular dilating action is provided for. The sphincter iridis and the ciliary muscle are supplied by the third nerve, by way of the ciliary ganglion. Quite posteriorly is the pigment already mentioned, really consisting of two layers of pigmented cells, each lawyer representing the extension forward of one subdivision of the retina. The front of the iris is covered by a delicate epithelial layer, a continuation of that lining Descemet's membrane. The colour of the iris in difierent individuals depends upon the amount of stromal pigment. 3. The innermost or nervous coat.—The inner surface of the uveal tract is everywhere lined by a layer of pigment of corresponding extent, which usually adheres to it closely on dissection. Developmentally, however, this general pigment lining is quite distinct from the uveal coat, and represents the outer loall of the secondary optic vesicle or embryonic retina: it consists of a single layer of pigmented epithelial cells. The amount of pigment is greatest anteriorly, over the ciliary region and iris, and there is again a small local increase posteriorly, corresponding to the macula lutea and to the edge of the optic foramen. Jn the ciliary region these cells have recently been described as lining numerous narrow tubular depressions in the inner part of the uveal tract, and they seem here to have a special function, viz. that of secreting the intraocular fluids. From the manner in which the secondary optic vesicle, or optic mqj, is formed, its two walls are necessarily continuous in front, at what may be termed the Up of the cup : we have just observed that the outer wall lines the uveal coat everywhere and corresponds in extent ; consequently, the lip must be looked for at the edge of the pupil, i.e. at the termination of this coat anteriorly. The ifiner ivall of the cup, consequently, reaches from the lip, or pupillary edge, in front, to the optic stalk or nerve behind, and is in close apposition to the pigment-epithelium ; unlike the outer, however, this wall is represented in the developed eye by tissues very dissimilar in structure in different parts of its extent. Tracing it backwards from the pupillary edge, we find that over the whole posterior surface of the iris it exists as a single layer of pigmented epithelium, the developmental changes having here produced a result similar to what we have found throughout in the outer wall: here, accordingly, we have a double layer of pigment cells. At the root of the iris the single inner layer of cells still exists ; but now they become destitute of pigment, and this condition obtains over the entire ciliary region, constituting what is known as the pars ciliaris retinae. At the line of the ora serrata the tissue derived from the inner wall abruptly increases in thickness, and rapidly acquires that complexity of structure characteristic of the retina proper, which extends from here to the optic nerve. It consists of several layers—nerve-fibres, nerve-cells, and nerve-epithelium—held together by a supporting framework of delicate connective tissue. The nerve- epithelium is on the outer surface, immediately applied to the pigment-epithelium; at the posterior pole of the eye a small spot (fovea centralis) exists, where this is the only retinal layer represented, and where consequently the retina is extremely thin. The nerve-fibres run on the inner surface of the retina and are continuous885 EXAMINATION OF THE EYEBALL with those of the optic nerve ; they constitute the only retinal layer that is continued into the intraocular end of the nerve. The nerve-cells are found between these surface layers. The larger blood-vessels of the retina run in the inner layers, and none encroach on the layer of nerve-epithelium. Within the coats mentioned, the interior of the eyeball is fully occupied by contents, which are divided into three parts, and differently named according to their consistence and anatomical form. They are all transparent, as through them the hght has to pass so as to gain the retina. Of these the only one that is sharply and independently outlined is the lens, which is situated in the anterior half of the globe at the level of the ciliary processes, where it is suspended between the other contents, which fill respectively the space in front of it and the space behind it. The space in front is called the anterior or aqueous chamber; that behind the lens is the vitreous chamber. The lens is a biconvex body, with its surfaces directed anteriorly and posteriorly ; these surfaces meet at its rounded-off edge or equator, which is near (but does not I touch) the ciliary processes all round. The posterior is considerably more convex than the anterior surface ; the central part of each surface is called its pole. The lens is closely encased in a hyaline elastic capsule, thicker over the anterior than over the posterior surface. Thus enclosed, it is held in position in the globe by a suspensory ligament, attached to its capsule near the equator all round, and swung : from the ciliary region. Posteriorly, the lens rests in a cup formed by the front part I of the vitreous, while its anterior capsule is in contact with the aqueous fluid and lies ' close against the back of the pupillary border of the iris. When in position the lens measures nine millimetres across, and about four millimetres between its poles. On886 OBGANS OF SPECIAL SENSE each surface a series of fine, sinuous, grey Hues can be seen radiating from the pole towards the equator, called respectively the anterior and posterior stellate figures. The lines observable on the posterior are always so placed as to be intermediate with those on the anterior surface, so that on viewing them through the lens they occupy a position corresponding to the intervals between the lines on the anterior surface. The lens-capsule is comparatively brittle, and can be readily cut through when scraped with a sharp-pointed instrument; on doing so the divided edges curl outwards, away from the lenticular substance. When removed from its capsule, the outer portion of the lens is found to be soft and glutinous, but its substance gets progressively firmer as we approach the centre. This harder central part is known as the nucleus, and the surrounding softer matter as cortex. The cortical part shows a tendency to peel off in successive layers. It consists of long fibres, the ends of which meet in front and behind at the anterior and posterior stellate figures. Histologically the capsule is not in immediate contact with the cortex over the front surface of the lens, a single layer of cells intervening, called the subcapsular epithelium. The suspensory ligament of the lens is formed by a thickening of the anterior part of a membrane enclosing the vitreous, strengthened by numerous fibres derived from the folds of the ciliary region. Its chief attachments to the lens- capsule are a little in front of and behind the equator, and the space included between the most anterior and most posterior divisions of the ligament is termed the canal of Petit. This space is bridged across by fine intermediate suspensory fibres, and is occupied by fluid. The vitreous humour is a transparent, colourless, jelly-like mass, enclosed in a delicate, clear, structureless membrane, called the hyaloid membrane. This latter is closely applied to the back of the posterior lens-capsule and of the suspensory ligament, and to the inner surface of the pars ciliaris retinae, retina proper, and optic papilla. Although possessing some degree of firmness, the vitreous humour contains quite 98 per cent, of water, and has no definite structure. Membranes have been described in it, but these are really artificial products. In certain situations spaces exist in the vitreous mass, the most determinate of which runs in the form of a canal from the optic papilla to the posterior pole of the lens, corre- sponding to the position of the foetal hyaloid artery (hyaloid canal, or canal of Cloquet). Other very fine spaces are described running circularly in the peripheral part of the vitreous concentric with its outer surface. Microscopically, wandering cells are found in the vitreous, which often here assume peculiar forms which the observer can, not infrequently, study subjectively. The aqueous humour is a clear, watery fluid, occupying the space between the cornea on the one hand, and the ciliary body, suspensory ligament, and lens on the other. The iris, projecting into this space, has both its surfaces bathed in the aqueous; but, as its inner part rests on the lens, it is regarded as dividing the space into two parts, an anterior larger, and a posterior smaller aqueous chamber, which communicate freely through the pupil. Ciliary nerves of the eyeball.—The long and short ciliary nerves, after per- forating the sclerotic, run forward between it and the choroid to the ciliary region, where they form a plexus, from which proceed branches for the ciliary muscle, the iris, and the cornea. The nerves of the iris enter it at its ciliary border, and run towards its pupillary edge, losing their medullary sheath sooner or later, and supplying specially the sphincter muscle. The corneal nerves form an annular plexus near the limbus, from which a few twigs proceed to the sclerotic and con- junctiva, while most of the offsets enter and run radially in the corneal stroma, branching and anastomosing so as to form a plexus. The nerves entering the corneaEXAMINATION OF THE EYEBALL 887 are about sixty in number, each containing from two to twelve non-meduUated nerve-fibres (page 797). Blood-vessels of the eyeball.—The ocular tissues receive blood from two sets of vessels, viz. the retinal and the ciliary arteries. 1. The arteria centralis retinae either comes direct from the ophthalmic artery, or from one of its branches near the apex of the orbit. Entering the optic nerve twenty millimetres or less behind the globe, it runs forward in its axis to the end of the nerve-trunk, and then divides into branches which run in the inner layers of the Fig. 478.—Diagrammatic Eepresentation of the Blood-vessels of the Eyeball.

The smaller branches He more deeply in the retina, l3ut none penetrate into the nerve-epithelium, so that the fovea centralis is non-vascular. In the retina, the branches of the central artery do not communicate with any other arteries, but while still in the optic nerve fine communications take place between this artery and neighbouring vessels. Thus {a) minute twigs from it, which help to nourish the axial part of the nerve, communicate with those running in the septa derived from the pial sheath. Again, as the nerve passes through the sclerotic, it is surrounded by a vascular ring888 ORGANS OF SPECIAL SENSE (circle of Haller), formed of fine branches derived from the short posterior cihary arteries ; fine twigs passing inwards from this ring to the optic nerve, join the vessels of the pial sheath, and {h) an indirect communication is thus brought about between the retinal and ciliary vessels. Finally, as the nerve passes through the choroid, there is (c) a direct connection between these two sets of vessels, the capillary network of the optic nerve being here continuous with the chorio-capillaris. Not infrequently, a branch from a short posterior ciliary artery pierces the optic papilla, and then courses over the adjoining retina (a cilio-retinal artery), supplying the latter in part in place of the central artery. The vena centralis retinae returns the blood of the corresponding artery. 2. The ciliary system of blood-vessels (pages 531, 532, and 664).—There are three sets of arteries belonging to this system, all derived directly or indirectly from the ophthalmic artery. (1) Short posterior ciliary arteries, twelve to twenty in number, pierce the sclerotic round the optic nerve entrance, and are distributed in the choroid. Before entering the eyeball, small twigs are given off to the adjoining sclerotic and to the dural sheath of the optic nerve. Fig. 479.—Surface of Choroid and Iris exposed by removal of Sclerotic and Cornea, showing Distribution of Blood-vessels and Nerves. (Twice natural size. After Zinn.) A CILIARY (2) Two long posterior ciliary arteries, piercing the sclerotic further from the nerve than the short ciliaries, run horizontally forwards between the sclerotic and choroid, one on each side of the globe. On arriving at the ciliary body, they join with the anterior ciliary arteries, forming the circulus iridis major, which sends off branches to the ciliary processes and the iris. The long ciliaries also give twigs to the ciliary muscle, and small recurrent branches run backwards to anastomose with the short ciliary arteries. The arteries of the iris run radially to the pupillary border, anastomosing with one another opposite the outer border of the sphincter so as to form the circulus iridis minor. (3) The anterior ciliary arteries come from the arteries of the four recti muscles, one or two from each; they run forwards, branching as they go, and finally pierce the sclerotic near the corneal border. Outside the globe they send twigs to the adjoining sclerotic, to the conjunctiva, and to the border of the cornea. After passing through the sclerotic the arteries enter the ciliary muscle, where they end in twigs to the muscle and to the circulus iridis major, and recurrent branches to the choroid.889 EXAMINATION OF THE EYEBALL Veins.—The venous blood from almost the whole uveal tract (choroid, ciliary processes and iris, and part of the ciliary muscle) ultimately leaves the eyeball by (1) the venae vorticosse, which have been already noticed in describing an antero- posterior section through the globe. One large vein passes backwards from each vortex, piercing the sclerotic obliquely ; it is joined by small episcleral veins when outside the globe. (2) The anterior ciliary veins commence by the junction of a few small veins of the ciliary muscle; they pass outwards through the sclerotic near the corneal border, receiving blood from the veins in connection with Schlemm's canal, and afterwards from episcleral and conjunctival veins, and from the marginal corneal plexus. Finally they join the veins running in the recti muscles. Lymphatic system of the eyeball.—Apart from those in the conjunctiva there are no lymphatic vessels in the eyeball, but the fluid is contained in s^jaces of various sizes. These are usually divided into an anterior and posterior set. Fig. 480.—The Lymphatics of the Eyeball. (Diagrammatic. After Fuclis.) 1. Anteriorly, we have the anterior and posterior aqueous chambers, which communicate freely through the pupil. The aqueous humour is secreted in the posterior of these chambers, from the vessels of the ciliary body and posterior surface of the iris (see also page 884). The stream passes mainly forwards through the pupil into the anterior aqueous chamber, whence it escapes slowly by passing through the spaces of Fontana into Schlemm's canal, and thence into the anterior ciliary veins. Part of the lymph-stream passes from the posterior aqueous chamber backwards into the canal of Petit, out of which fluid can pass into the lens substance, or diffuse itself into the front of the vitreous. In the cornea the lymph travels in the spaces already mentioned as existing between the fibre-bundles, and in the nerve-channels, and at the periphery of the cornea it flows off into the lymphatic vessels of the conjunctiva.890 OBGANS OF SPECIAL SENSE In the iris there is a system of lymphatic spaces opening anteriorly on its free surface by the crypts previously described, and communicating peripherally with the spaces of Fontana. 2. Posteriorly, we have (a) the central or hyaloid canal, between the poste- rior pole of the lens and the optic nerve entrance, and (b) the perivascular canals of the retina ; the lymph from both of these situations flows into the spaces of the optic nerve, which communicate with the intervaginal space of the nerve, and thus with the great intracranial spaces. Further, between choroid and sclerotic, we have (c) the perichoroidal space, which gets the lymph from the choroid, and communicates with Tenon's space outside the sclerotic by the perforations corre- sponding to the vasa vorticosa and posterior ciliary arteries, and with the interva- ginal space around the optic nerve entrance. Tenon's space, again, is continuous with the supravaginal space around the optic nerve, which communicates both with the intervaginal.ispaces, with the lymph spaces of the orbit, and directly with the intracranial spaces at the apex of the orbit.

The posterior two-thirds of the globe are in relation with soft parts, chiefly muscles and fat, and its posterior pole is situated midway between the base (or opening) and the apex of the orbital cavity. The anterior third of the eyeball is naturally free, except for a thin covering of conjunctiva, and projects slightly beyond the opening of the orbit, the degree of prominence varying with the amount of orbital fat, and also to some extent with the length of the globe. A straight line joining the inner and outer orbital margins usually cuts the eye behind the cornea—externally behind the ora serrata, nasally further forward, at the junction of the ciliary body and iris. The globe is held in position by numerous bands of connective tissue. The891 CAVITY OF THE OBBIT lachrymal gland lies under the outer part of the roof of the orbit anteriorly. The orbital fat occupies the spaces between the orbital muscles, and is in greatest amount immediately behind the eyeball; it also exists between the muscles and the orbital walls in the anterior half of the cavity. Six muscles, viz. the four recti, the superior oblique, and the levator palpebrse superioris, arise at the apex of the orbit, and diverge as they pass forwards. The recti muscles—superior, inferior, external, and internal—run each near the corresponding orbital wall, but the superior is over- lapped in part by the levator palpebrae. The superior oblique lies about midway betweeen the superior and internal recti. A seventh muscle, the inferior oblique, has a short course entirely in the anterior part of the orbit, coming from its inner wall and passing beneath the globe between the termination of the inferior rectus and the orbital floor. The optic nerve with its sheaths passes from the optic Fig. 482.—Section through Contents of Eight Orbit 8-11 mm. behind the Eyeball, VIEWED FROM BEHIND.

Among the contents of the cavity are also to be enumerated many vessels and nerves, and fibrous tissue septa, while its walls are clothed by periosteum (periorbita). The muscles of the orbit are seven in number, of which six are ocular, i.e. are inserted into the eyeball and rotate it in different directions. These ocular muscles are arranged in opponent pairs, viz. superior and inferior recti, superior and inferior obliques, external and internal recti. With the exception of the short inferior oblique, they all arise from the back of the orbit along with the seventh orbital muscle, the elevator of the upper lid. All these long muscles take their origin from the periosteum in the vicinity of the optic foramen. The four recti muscles arise from a fibrous ring which arches close over the upper and inner edgeOBGANS OF SPECIAL SENSE 892 of the foramen, and extends down and out so as -to embrace part of the opening of the sphenoidal fissure. Their origins may be said at first to form a short, common, tendinous tube, from which the individual muscles soon separate, taking the posi- tions indicated by their respective names. The external rectus has two origins from bone, one on either side of the sphenoidal fissure. But in the fresh state the fissure is here bridged across by fibrous tissue, from which this rectus also springs, so that its origin is in reality continuous. The part of this fibrous ring nearest i the foramen (corresponding to the origins of the superior and internal recti) is 1 closely connected with the outer sheath of the optic nerve. The remaining two j long muscles arise just outside the upper and inner part of the above-mentioned i ring, and are often partially united ; the levator palpebr^e tendon is in close relation ' to the origin of the superior rectus, while the superior oblique arises from the ' periosteum of the body of the sphenoid bone one or two millimetres in front of ; the origin of the internal rectus. I The four recti muscles lie rather close to the corresponding orbital walls for the | first half of their course, the superior rectus, however, being overlapped in part by : the levator palpebrae; they then turn towards the eyeball, running obliquely ; through the orbital fat, and are finally inserted by broad, thin tendons into the sclerotic in front of the equator. The thickest of these muscles is the internal rectus, next the external, then the inferior, and the superior rectus is the thinnest.

The external rectus is supplied by the sixth nerve. The other three recti muscles are all supplied by the third nerve. The levator palpebrae superioris courses along the roof of the orbit close to the periosteum for the greater part of its course, partially overlapping the superior rectus ; it finally descends through the orbital fat, and widens out to be inserted into the root of the upper lid. It may be briefly described as being inserted in two distinct layers separated by a horizontal interval. The upper or anterior layer of insertion is fibrous, and passes in front of the tarsus, where it comes into relation with fibres of the orbicularis. The lower layer consists of smooth muscle (Miiller's superior palpebral muscle) and is inserted along the upper border of the tarsus. The levator has also connections with the sheath of the superior rectus. These different insertions of the muscle will be referred to later along with the description of the orbital fascise and of the upper eyehd. It gets its nervous supply from the third nerve, but the smooth muscle developed in its lower layer of insertion is supplied by the sympathetic nervous system. As its name expresses, its action is to raise the upper lid and to support it while the eye is open. The superior oblique runs forward close to the inner part of the orbital roof until it reaches the fossa trochlearis near the internal angular process, where itNEBVE-SUPPLY AND ACTION OF MUSCLES 89B ! becomes tendinous and passes through a fibro-cartilaginous pulley attached to the fossa just named. On passmg through this pulley, or trochlea, the tendon bends at an angle of 50°, running backwards and outwards under the superior rectus to its insertion into the sclerotic. It is supplied by the fourth nerve. The inferior oblique arises from the front of the orbit, about the junction of its inner and lower walls, just external to the lower end of the lachrymal groove. It runs, in a sloping direction, outwards and backwards, lying at first between the inferior rectus and the orbital floor, then between the external rectus and the globe ; finally it ascends slightly, to be inserted by a short tendon into the sclerotic at the back of the eye. Its nervous supply is derived from the third nerve. The precise manner of insertion of the different ocular muscles has been described above in our Examination of the Eyeball. (For Muscles of the Eyelids AND Eyebkows, see pages 455 and following.) Action of the ocular muscles.—^While rotating the globe so that the cornea is turned in different directions, the ocular muscles do not alter the position of the eyeball in the orbit either laterally, vertically, or antero-posteriorly. In speaking, therefore, of the eye being moved uiJiuards, or outwards, etc., it is the altered position of the cornea or front of the eye that we mean to express; it is manifest I that, if the cornea moves up, the back of the eyeball must simultaneously be depressed, and similarly with other movements. All the movements of the globe take place by rotation, on axes passing through the centre. Though the possible axes are numerous in combined muscular action, there are three principal axes of rotation of the eyeball, and in reference to these the action of individual muscles must be described. Two of these axes are horizontal, and one vertical; they all pass through the centre of rotation at right angles to one another. By rotation of i the eye on its vertical axis the cornea is moved outwards (towards the temple), and inwards (towards the nose): movements called respectively abduction and adduction. In upward and downward movements of the cornea, the eye rotates on its hori- zontal equatorial axis. The other principal axis of rotation is the sagittal, which we have previously described as corresponding to the line joining the anterior and posterior poles of the globe (page 878). In rotation of the eye on its sagittal axis, therefore, the cornea may be said to move as a wheel on its axle, for its centre now corresponds to one end of the axis; in other words, this is a rotation of the cornea. Such movements may, consequently, be expressed with reference to their I effect on an imaginary spoke of the corneal wheel—e.g. one running vertically [ upwards from the corneal centre. Thus we may say ' rotation of the cornea \ outwards' when this part of the wheel moves towards the outer canthus, or 1 ' inwards ' when towards the nose. I The only two muscles that rotate the eyeball merely on one axis are the \ external rectus and the internal rectus; the former abducting, and the latter adducting the cornea. The chief action of the superior rectus is to draw the cornea upwards, but at I the same time it adducts and rotates the cornea inwards. The inferior rectus mainly draws the cornea downwards, also adducting it and rotating it outwards. ; The chief action of the superior oblique is to rotate the cornea inwards, also I drawing it downwards and slightly abducting it. 1, The inferior oblique mainly rotates the cornea outwards, also drawing it I upwards and slightly abducting it. j The fasciae of the orbit.—The orbital contents are bound together and supported ! by fibrous tissues, which are connected with each other, but which may conveniently j be regarded as belonging to three systems. These are : (1) Those lining the bony walls ; (2) those ensheathing the muscles; and (3) the tissue which partially encapsules the eyeball.894 OBGANS OF SPECIAL SENSE ' | 1. The orbital periosteum, or periorbita, is closely applied to the bones forming the walls of the cavity, but may be stripped o£f with comparative ease. It presents openings for the passage of vessels and nerves entering and leaving the orbit. ! Posteriorly this tissue is very firm, being joined by processes of the dura mater at j the optic canal and sphenoidal fissure ; at the optic foramen it is also connected with i the dural sheath of the optic nerve. As it covers the spheno-maxillary fissure its ' fibres are interwoven with smooth muscle, forming the orbital muscle of Miiller. \ From its inner surface processes run into the orbital cavity, separating the fat i lobules. One important process comes from the periorbita about midway along I the roof of the orbit, runs forward to the back of the upper division of the lachrymal ' gland, and there splits, helping to form the gland-capsule : this capsule is joined I at its inner border by other periorbital bands coming off near the upper orbital rim, 1 and forming the suspensory ligament of the gland. On the inner side of the orbit ' Fig. 484.—View of Left Orbit from above, showing the Ocular Muscles. ! (From Hirschfeld and Leveille.) Internal rectus muscle Superior oblique muscle Troelilea the periorbita sends fibrous processes to the trochlea of the superior oblique, which i keep it in position. On arriving at the lachrymal groove the periorbita divides into i two layers, a thin posterior one continuing to line the bone forming the floor of the ' groove, whilst the thicker anterior layer bridges over the groove and the sac which lies in it, forming the limbs of the inner palpebral ligament (page 904). Quite anteriorly, at the rim of the orbit, the periorbita sends off a membranous 1 process which aids in forming the fibrous tissue of the eyelids (orbito-tarsal liga- ! ment, or palpebral fascia), and is itself continuous with the periosteum of the bones , outside the orbital margin. i 2. The orbital muscles are connected by a common fascia, which splits at their borders and furnishes a sheath to each. Processes of this fascia give membranous | investments for the vessels and nerves (including the optic nerve), splitting similarly ' to enclose them ; these membranous processes also assist in separating the fat lobules. Posteriorly, this fascia is thin and loose, and blends with the periorbita at the origin of the muscles. Anteriorly, it becomes thicker and firmer, accompanies the muscles to near the equator of the eyeball, and there divides into two laminae, :895 CAVITY OF THE OBBIT an anterior and a posterior; the former continues a forward course, forming a complete funnel-shaped investment all round, passing ultimately to the eyelids and orbital margin—whilst the latter turns backwards, covering the hinder third of the globe. The anterior lamina is a well-marked membrane everywhere, but in certain situations it presents special bands of thickening, corresponding to the direct continuation forwards of the sheath of each rectus muscle. Above and below, this lamina spreads out in the form of two large membranes, which are finally applied to the deep surface of the palpebral fascia; the lower membrane constitutes what has been described as ' the suspensory ligament of the eyeball.'

The upper part of the sheath of the superior rectus (along with the adjoining membrane on each side of it) passes to the deep surface of the levator, to which it closely adheres, and completely ensheaths this tendon by extending round its borders to its upper surface. The lower part of this levator-sheath is applied to the inferior surface of the deeper of the two divisions of the muscle [orhito-ioalpehral muscle of Sappey, superior palpebral muscle of Miiller), and is attached to the upper border of the tarsus of the upper lid, reaching laterally to the outer and inner angles of the orbit. The upper part of the sheath of the orbito-palpebralis muscle reaches to the middle of the palpebral fascia, and is mainly continued forw^ard between the muscle and the fascia to the anterior surface of the tarsus.OBGANS OF SPECIAL SENSE 896 The lower membrane (suspensory ligament of the eyeball), joined by the sheath of the inferior rectus, reaches forward to the attached (hinder) border of the tarsus of the lower lid, where it is mainly attached, while a part of it extends to the lower palpebral fascia. To understand the special hands mentioned above, we must follow the sheath of each rectus muscle forwards, when we find that, while it is rather loosely applied to the muscular belly in its posterior two-thirds, it then suddenly becomes thicker, and is firmly attached to the muscle for some distance before finally leaving it, and is thereafter often accompanied by some muscle-fibres. The best developed of these bands, the external check ligament, passes forwards and outwards to the outer angle of the orbit, helping to support the lachrymal gland on its way, and is Fig. 486.—Horizontal Section through Left Orbit, viewed from above. (After Von Gerlach. To show check ligaments, etc.) inserted near the orbital edge immediately behind the external palpebral ligament. The inner band, or internal check ligament, is larger than the outer, but not so thick; it passes forwards and inwards to be inserted into the upper part of the lachrymal crest and just behind it. These two bands, external and internal, come from the sheaths of the corresponding recti muscles. From the sheath of the superior rectus come two thin bands, one from each border. The inner joins the sheath of the tendon of the superior oblique; the outer goes to the external angle of the orbit, assisting in the support of part of the lachrymal gland. The sheath of the inferior rectus is thickened in front, and, on leaving the muscle, goes to the middle of the inferior oblique, splitting to enclose it ; it then passes to be inserted into the lower inner angle of the orbit close behind its margin, about midway between the internal check ligament and the orbital attachment of the inferior oblique.897 OPTIC NEBVE 3. In addition to its partial investment by the muscle-fascia, the eyeball has a special membrane enclosing its hinder two-thirds, usually called Tenon's capsule. This is a thin, transparent tissue, situated immediately beneath the muscle-fascia. It follows the curve of the sclerotic from the insertion of the recti to about 3 mm. from the optic nerve entrance, when it leaves the eyeball and blends with the posterior lamina of the muscle-fascia; the combined membrane may be traced backwards, enveloping the optic-nerve sheath loosely, approaching it as it nears the optic foramen, but never actually joining it. The interval between it and the nerve- sheath is called the supravaginal lymjjh sjMce. Tenon's capsule first comes into relation with the muscles at the point where they are left by their proper sheaths ; it there invests their tendons, forms a small serous bursa on the anterior surface of each, and adheres to the sclerotic in the form of a line running round the globe, joining the insertions of the four recti muscles. Between this line and the corneal border, the conjunctiva is separated from the sclerotic by the subconjunctival tissue, strengthened by a fine expansion of the muscle-fascia. The inner surface of the capsule is smooth, and is only connected with the sclerotic by a loose, wide-meshed areolar tissue. This interval between the sclerotic and capsule, known as Tenon's space, is a lymph cavity, and permits free move- ments of the eyeball within the capsule. Belatio7i of Tenon's Capsule to the Ohliqne Muscles.—The capsule surrounds the posterior third of the inferior oblique and its tendon, running along its ocular surface till it meets the fascial band coming from the inferior rectus (see above), and forming a serous bursa on the superficial surface of the oblique near its insertion. The tendon of the superior oblique for about its last five millimetres is invested solely by Tenon's capsule ; in front of this, as far as the trochlea, the tendon lies in a membranous tube derived from the muscle-fascia, the inner lining of which is smooth, and may be considered as a prolongation of Tenon's capsule. The Optic Nebve The part of this nerve with which we have here to do lies within the orbit, extending from the optic foramen to the eyeball. Its course is somewhat S-shaped; thus, on entering the orbit, it describes a curve, with its convexity down and out, and then a second slighter curve, convex inwards. Finally, it runs straight forwards to the globe, which it enters to the inner side of its posterior pole. Besides curving as just described, the nerve also rotates on its long axis, so that the surface which is below at the foramen becomes temporal before entering the eyeball. In its passage through the optic canal the nerve is surrounded by a pro- i longation of the meninges. The dura mater splits at the optic foramen, part i of it joining the periorbita, while the remainder continues to surround the I nerve loosely as its outer or dural sheath. The nerve is closely enveloped by I a vascular covering derived from the pia mater, named accordingly the pial I sheath. The space between these two sheaths, known as the intcrvaqinal space, is subdivided by a fine prolongation of the arachnoid (the arachnoidal sheath) into two parts, viz. an outer, narrow, subdurcU, and an inner, wider, subarachnoid [ space, communicating with the corresponding intracranial spaces. The arachnoidal sheath is connected with the sheath on each side of it by numerous fine processes which bridge across the intervening spaces. The pial sheath sends processes inwards, which form a framework separating the bundles of nerve-fibres; between the enclosed nerve-fibres and each mesh of this framework there is a narrow interval \ occupied by lymph. The nerve-fibres are medullated, but have no primitive sheath. About fifteen or twenty millimetres behind the globe the central vessels enter, piercing obliquely the lower outer quadrant of the nerve, and then run forward 3 MOBGANS OF SPECIAL SENSE 898 in its axis. They are accompanied throughout by a special process of the pial sheath, which forms a fibrous cord in the centre of the nerve. On reaching the eyeball, the dural sheath is joined by the arachnoid, and turns away from the nerve to be continued into the outer two-thirds of the sclerotic. Similarly the pial sheath also here leaves the nerve, its greater part running into the inner third of the sclerotic, while a few of its fibres join the choroid ; the inter- FiG. 487.—Transverse Section through Optic Nerve, showing the Relations of ITS Sheaths and Connective-Tissue Framework.

In this locality the connective-tissue framework of the nerve becomes thicker and closer in its meshwork, and has been already alluded to as the lamina cribrosa. It is formed by processes passing out from the central fibrous cord at its termination, and by processes passing inwards from the pial sheath, sclerotic, and choroid. It does not pass straight across the nerve, but follows the curve of the surrounding sclerotic, being therefore slightly convex backwards. The nerve-trunk here quickly becomesOPTIC NEBVE 899 reduced to one-half its former diameter, the fibres losing their medullary sheath, and being continued henceforward as mere axis cylinders. Apart from the conse- quent loss of bulk, this histological change may be readily recognised macroscopi- cally in a longitudinal section of the nerve, its aspect here changing from opaque white to semi-translucent grey. The part of the nerve within the lamina cribrosa has already been seen in our ophthalmoscopic examination of the living eye. The optic nerve is mainly nourished by fine vessels derived from those of the pial sheath, which run into the substance of the nerve in the processes above mentioned. In front of the entrance of the central retinal artery this vessel aids to some extent in the blood-supply of the axial part of the nerve.

I Arteries.—The main blood-supply is afforded by the ophthalmic artery, a branch of the internal carotid, which gains the orbit through the optic canal, where it lies beneath and to the temporal side of the nerve. On entering the orbit it ascends, and passes obliquely over the optic nerve to the inner wall of the orbit; in this early part of its course it gives off most of its branches, which vary much in their jmanner of origin and also in their course. The arteries of the orbit are remarkable I for their tortuous course, for their delicate walls, and for their loose attachment to the [surrounding tissues. The ophthalmic artery gives off special branches in the orbit |to the lachrymal gland, the muscles, the retina (through the optic nerve), and the eyeball, as well as to the meninges, the ethmoidal cells, and the nasal mucous membrane. Twigs from all the different branches go to supply the fat, fascia, and ordinary nerves of the orbit. Branches which leave the orbit anteriorly ramify on the forehead and nose, and also go to the supply of the eyelids and the tear-passages. 3 M 2900 ORGANS OF SPECIAL SENSE The ophthalmic artery has many anastomoses with branches of the external carotid. The contents of the orbit are also supplied in part by the infraorbital artery, a branch of the internal maxillary; in particular this artery supplies part of the inferior rectus and inferior oblique muscles in the cavity, and also gives a branch to the lower eyelid. Veins.—Branches, corresponding generally to those of the artery, unite to form the superior and inferior ophthalmic veins, which ultimately, either separately or united into one trunk, pass through the sphenoidal fissure and empty into the cavernous sinus. The inferior vein is connected with the pterygoid plexus by a branch which leaves the orbit by the spheno-maxillary fissure. Nerves of the orbit.—These are motor, sensory, and sympathetic, and all enter the orbit by the sphenoidal fissure, with the exception of one small sensory branch passing through the spheno-maxillary fissure. (The optic nerve has been already described, and is not included in this account.) A. The motor nerves are the third, fourth, and sixth cranial. Fig. 490.—Section through Contents of Eight Orbit, 1-2 mm. in front of THE Optic Foramen, viewed from behind. (After Lange.) ASAL, ^MAL muscle 1. The third nerve enters the orbit in two parts, an upper smaller, and a lower larger division. The u^pi^er division gives off two branches : one supphes the superior rectus, entering its lower surface far back; the other branch goes to the levator palpebrjB, entering its lower surface in its posterior third. The loiver division divides into three branches, of which one supplies the inferior rectus,^ entering its upper surface far back, and another supphes the internal rectus, entering its inner surface a little behind its middle. The third branch of the lower division gives (1) the short root to the cihary ganglion, and (2) one or more twigs to the inferior rectus, and the remainder of this branch then enters the lower surface of the inferior oblique muscle about its middle. 2. The fourth nerve supphes the superior obhque muscle, entering its upper surface about midway in its course. 3. The sixth nerve supphes the external rectus, entering its inner surface about the junction of the posterior and middle thirds of the muscle. As regards the manner of termination of these motor nerves, it is found that in all the ocular muscles the nerve on its entrance breaks up into numerous bundles of fibres, which form first coarse and then fine plexuses, the latter ulti- mately sending off fine twigs supplying the muscle throughout with nerve-endings. The posterior third of these muscles is, however, comparatively ill supphed with both kinds of plexus and with nerve-endings.NEBVES OF OBBIT 901 I B. The sensory nerves are supplied by the first and second divisions of the fifth cranial nerve. The first division, or ophthalmic nerve, is entirely orbital; while the second, or maxillary, only sends a small branch to the orbit. 1. The ophthalmic division of the fifth nerve enters the orbit in three divisions, namely:— I (1) Frontal, splitting subsequently into supratrochlear and supraorbital, both ! passing out of the orbit. It is distributed to the corresponding upper eyelid, and the skin over the root of the nose, the forehead, and the hairy scalp as far back as the coronal suture on the same side. It also gives branches to the periosteum in this region, and to the frontal sinus. (2) Lachrymal, supplying the lachrymal gland, anastomosing with a branch of j the superior maxillary in the orbit, and finally piercing the upper eyelid. Outside I the orbit it is distributed to the outer part of the upper lid, the conjunctiva at the ' external canthus, and the skin between this and the temporal region. (3) Nasal, giving off (a) a branch to the ciliary ganglion, constituting its long root; (b) two or three long ciliary nerves ; and (c) the infratrochlear, passing out of the orbit. The nasal nerve then leaves the orbit, re-entering the cranial cavity before being finally distributed to the nose. The infratrochlear branch supplies the eyelids and skin of the side of the nose near the inner canthus, the lachrymal sac, caruncle, and plica semilunaris. The nasal nerve, after its second course in the cranial cavity, passes through an aperture in the front of the cribriform plate of the ethmoid bone, and is ultimately distributed to the nasal mucous membrane, and to the skin of the side and ridge of the nose near its tip. 2. The maxillary division of the fifth nerve gives a branch, called the orbital nerve, which passes into the orbit through the spheno-maxillary fissure, anastomoses with the lachrymal, and leaves the orbit in two divisions. These are distributed to the skin of the temple and of the prominent part of the cheek. A few minute twigs from Meckel's ganglion, and sometimes from the maxillary division of the fifth nerve, also pass through the spheno-maxillary fissure to supply the periorbita in this neighbourhood. C. The sympathetic nerves of the orbit are derived from the plexus on the internal carotid. With the exception of branches accompanying the ophthalmic artery, and of the distinct sympathetic root of the ciliary ganglion, they enter the orbit in the substance of the other nerve-cords. The connections between the ocular nerves and the carotid plexus are recognisable as fibres going to the third, sixth, and ophthalmic nerves ; as a rule, the comparatively large twigs going to the sixth I join it furthest back, and those to the third furthest forward. Sympathetic I connections with the fourth nerve are very doubtful. The lenticular or ciliary ganglion is situated between the optic nerve and ! external rectus far back in the orbit. Its three roots—motor, sensory, and sympa- thetic—have been already mentioned. Anteriorly, it gives ofl* three to six small trunks, which subdivide to form the short ciliary nerves, about twenty in number, [ piercing the sclerotic around the optic nerve entrance. The lymphatic system of the orbit.—Although there are no lymphatic vessels i or glands in the orbit, the passage of lymph is nevertheless well provided for. We have already observed the lymph channels within, between, and outside the sheaths of the optic nerve, and have seen how these communicate anteriorly with the I lymph channels of the eyeball, and posteriorly with the intracranial meningeal I spaces. In addition, there are lymph-spaces around the blood-vessels, situated [ between the outer coat and the loose investment furnished by the muscle-fascia. I The nerves of the orbit (apart from the optic) are probably similarly surrounded by lymph-spaces. In the absence of lymphatic vessels it is difficult to trace the I circulation thoroughly; much of the lymph from the orbital cavity is said to pass I into the internal maxillary glands.OBGANS OF SPECIAL SENSE 902 The Eyelids The cutaneous and conjunctival surfaces of the hds have akeady been examined, and the position of the tarsus has been indicated. We have now to ascertain the nature and relations of the tarsus, and describe the other tissues entering into the formation of the eyelids. The skin here is thin, bearing fine hairs, and having small sebaceous and numerous small sweat glands. Immediately beneath it is a loose subcutaneous tissue, destitute of fat, separating the skin from the palpebral part of the orbicularis Fig. 491.—Vertical Transverse Section through the Upper Eyelid. (After Waldeyer and Fiichs.)

The Hd-fibres of this muscle arise from the inner palpebral ligament, and course over the whole upper and lower eyelids in a succession of arches, so as to meet again beyond the outer canthus ; there they in part join one another, in part are inserted into the outer palpebral ligament. The muscular fibres are arranged in loose bundles, with spaces between them occupied by connective tissue ; in the upper hd these connective tissue fibres may be traced upwards and backwards into the fibrous expansion of the tendon of the levator palpebrse superioris. One strong bundle of orbicularis fibres, called the musculus eiliaris Riolani, is found near the edge of the lid, in front of, and behind, the efferent ducts of the Meibomian glands.THE EYELIDS 903 A central connective tissue separates the orbicularis muscle from the tarsus in the tarsal division of the lids. In the upper lid this is to be regarded as mainly the anterior or fibrous expansion of the tendon of the levator palpebrse, which sends connective tissue septa between the bundles of the overlying orbicularis (as just mentioned) going to the skin. In the orbital part of this lid the central con- nective tissue includes also the palpebral fascia, lying here immediately beneath the orbicularis muscle ; but this soon thins off and fades into the more deeply placed ' levator expansion. This latter is strengthened by an extension of the sheath of the superior rectus, by which this muscle is enabled to influence the elevation of the lid indirectly. In the lower lid the central connective tissue similarly consists of palpebral fascia, blended with a thin fibrous extension of the sheath of the inferior rectus. Immediately in front of each tarsus is a little loose connective tissue, which contains the large blood-vessels and nerves of the lids. The tarsus of each lid is a stiff plate of close connective tissue, with its sur- . faces directed anteriorly and posteriorly ; in its substance the Meibomian glands I are embedded. One tarsal border is free, viz. towards the edge of the lid, the I other is attached ; the former is straight, while the latter is convex, especially in the upper lid. The length of each tarsus is about twenty millimetres. Its breadth I is greatest in the middle of the lid, and becomes gradually smaller towards each I canthus, where the tarsi are joined to the outer and inner palpebral ligaments. The [ breadth of the upper tarsus (10 mm.) is about twice that of the lower. The thickness i of each is greatest, and its texture closest, at the middle of its length, thinning off j towards the canthi and towards both borders. Into the superior anterior border of the upper tarsus the lower layer of the levator expansion is attached, consisting of smooth muscle-fibres constituting the superior palpebral muscle of Miiller. In like manner, at the inferior border of the lower tarsus, bundles of smooth muscle fibre are inserted (the inferior palpebral muscle of Miiller), developed in what has been regarded as part of the extension of the sheath of the inferior rectus. The palpebral conjunctiva is firmly adherent to the back of the tarsus ; but in the orbital part of the lid loose subconjunctival tissue intervenes between it and Miiller's palpebral muscle. Adenoid tissue occurs in the substance of the conjunc- tiva, especially in its orbital division. Near the upper fornix, the conjunctiva receives expansions of the tendon of the levator palpebrse and of the sheath of the superior rectus, and, at the lower fornix, of the sheath of the inferior rectus. The : surface of the tarsal conjunctiva shows small elevations or papillae everywhere ; I but these are particularly well marked over the attached border of the tarsus. ' Glands of the eyelids.—From its manner of formation the eyelid may be regarded as consisting of two thicknesses of skin, the inner (or posterior) having ! been doubled back upon the outer at the edge of the lid; thus the cuticle and corium of the skin proper are represented respectively by the conjunctiva and tarsus of the inner thickness. At the free border of the lid, accordingly, we find glands corresponding to the sebaceous and sweat glands of the skin, viz. large sebaceous glands of the cilia (Zeiss's glands) and Moll's modified sweat glands. Again, in the i inner skin-thickness of the lid, the Meibomian glands of the tarsus are sebaceous, i and acino-tubular glands present at the attached border of the tarsus (Waldeyer's glands) may be reckoned as modified sweat glands. Glands similar in structure to Waldeyer's also occur at the fornix, and are especially abundant near the outer canthus of the upper lid, close to the efferent ducts of the lachrymal gland ; from their structure, and the character of their secretion, these acinous or acino-tubular i glands have been termed by Henle ' accessory lachrymal glands.' Other simple tubular glands (Henle), formed merely by the depressions between the papillae, are best developed in the inner and outer fourths of the tarsal conjunctiva cf both lids.ORGANS OF SPECIAL SENSE 904 Blood-vessels.—The arteries run in the central connective tissue of the lids, I mainly in the form of arches near the borders of the tarsus, from which twigs go ' to the different palpebral tissues. They are supplied by the lachrymal and palpebral \ branches of the ophthalmic, and by small branches derived from the temporal j artery. The veins are more numerous and larger than the arteries, and form a | close plexus beneath each fornix. They empty themselves into the veins of the j face at the inner, and into the orbital veins at the outer canthus. | The lymphatic vessels of the lids are numerous, and are principally situated in 1 the conjunctiva. Lymph-spaces also surround the follicles of the Meibomian i glands. The palpebral lymphatic vessels mainly pass through the preauricular ' gland ; but, sometimes at least, those from the inner half of the lower lid go to the I submaxillary lymphatic glands. i Nerves.—{a) Sensory. The upper lid is chiefly supplied by branches of the ; supraorbital and supratrochlear nerves, the lower lid by one or two branches of | the infraorbital. At the inner canthus the infratrochlear nerve also aids in the j supply, and, at the outer canthus, the lachrymal, {h) Motor. The palpebral part i of the orbicularis is supplied by branches of the facial nerve, which mainly enter \ it near the outer canthus. Miiller's palpebral muscles are supplied by the sympa- , thetic nervous system. j The inner palpebral lig^ament, or tendo oculi, has been referred to previously. Arising from the frontal process of the maxilla, it extends outwards over the front wall of the lachrymal sac, bends round the outer wall of the sac, and then passes backwards to the posterior crest on the lachrymal bone. It is thus U-shaped, having its limbs anterior and posterior, embracing the lachrymal sac ; the anterior : limb lies immediately beneath the skin, and is visible in the living. The palpebral : fibres of the orbicularis are inserted into the outer surface of both limbs, those attached to the posterior limb constituting Horner's muscle. The outer palpebral lig^ament is merely a stronger development of connective tissue in the orbicularis, i Both ligaments are connected with the tarsi as already mentioned. I The Lacheymal Appaeatus j The tears are secreted by an acinous gland, and flow through fine ducts to the upper outer part of the conjunctival sac, whence they are drained off through the j puncta, pass along the canaliculi into the lachrymal sac, and ultimately run down : the nasal duct to gain the inferior meatus of the nose. j The lachrymal gland is situated near the front of the outer part of the roof of j the orbit, lying in a depression in the orbital plate of the frontal bone. It consists ! of two very unequal parts, one placed above and the other beneath the tendinous j expansion of the levator palpebrae superioris, but small gaps in the expansion ! permit of connections between these two parts of the gland. The upper and larger subdivision {superior lachrymal gland) is a firm elongated body, about the size of a small almond; it has a greyish-red colour, and is made up of closely aggregated lobules. The upper surface (next the orbital roof) is convex, and its lower surface is slightly concave. Anteriorly, the gland almost reaches the upper orbital \ margin, and it extends backwards for approximately one-fourth the depth of the orbit, measuring about twelve millimetres in this direction. The outer border of ; the gland descends to near the insertion of the fascial expansion of the external rectus, while its inner border almost reaches the outer edge of the superior rectus ; its transverse measurement is about tw^enty millimetres. It is enveloped in a capsule, which is slung by strong fibrous bands passing to its inner border from the orbital margin (suspensory ligament of the gland). j The lower subdivision of the gland {inferior lachrymal gland) is composed of |LACHBYMAL APPABATUS 905 loosely applied lobules, and lies immediately over the outer third of the upper conjunctival fornix, reaching outwards as far as the external canthus. Each subdivision of the gland possesses several excretory ducts, which all open on the outer part of the upper fornix conjunctivae, about four millimetres above the upper border of the tarsus. Those of the superior gland, three or four in number, pass between the lobules of the lower gland ; the outermost duct is the largest, and opens at the level of the external canthus. The ducts of the inferior gland in part discharge themselves into those of the upper, but there are also several fine ducts from this subdivision that run an independent course. Near the inner canthus are the two puncta lachrymalia, upper and lower, each situated at the summit of its papilla. The top of each papilla curves backwards towards the conjunctival sac, so that the puncta are well adapted for their function of draining oft' any fluid collecting there. The canaliculi lachrymales extend from the puncta to the lachrymal sac. The lumen at the punctum is horizontally oval, from its lips being slightly compressed antero-posteriorly ; the lumen of the lower punctum is somewhat larger than that of the upper. As the lower papilla is a little further from the inner canthus than the upper, the corresponding canaliculus is longer. Fig. 492.—Lachrymal Apparatus. (After Schwalbe.) On tracing either canaliculus from its origin, we find that at first it runs nearly vertically for a short distance, then bends sharply towards the nose, and I finally courses more or less horizontally, converging slightly towards its fellow, I and not infrequently joining it before opening into the sac. The calibre varies considerably in this course, being narrowest a short distance from the punctum, ' and widest at the bend, from which point it again narrow^s very gradually as it I nears the sac. The w^all of the canaliculus consists mainly of elastic and white ! fibrous tissue, lined internally by epithelium, and covered externally by striated muscle (part of the orbicularis). The muscle-fibres run parallel to the canaliculus I in the horizontal part of its course; but they are placed, some in front and some [ behind, around the vertical part, acting here as a kind of sphincter. Just before ^ their termination, the canaliculi pierce the periosteal thickening that constitutes the posterior limb of the inner palpebral ligament. The lachrymal sac lies in a depression in the bone at the inner angle of the I orbit (the lachrymal fossa). It is vertically elongated, and narrows at its upper and lower ends; the upper extremity or f undus is closed, while the lower is continuous [directly with the nasal duct. Laterally, the sac is somewhat compressed, so that its antero-posterior is greater than its transverse diameter. The canaliculi, either separately or by a short common tube, open into a bulging on the outer surface 1906 OBGANS OF SPECIAL SENSE \ I of the sac near the fundus. As has previously been mentioned, the sac is ; surrounded by periosteum, but between this and the mucous membrane forming | the true sac-wall there is a loose connective tissue, so that the cavity is capable of considerable distension. The relations of the inner palpebral ligament have i already been described ; it is to be noted that the fundus of the sac extends above j this ligament. | The nasal duct reaches from the lower end of the sac to the top of the inferior i meatus of the nose, opening into the latter just beneath the adherent border of the | inferior turbinated bone. Traced from above, its main direction is downwards, j but it has also a slight inclination backwards and outwards. It lies in a bony ! canal, whose periosteum forms its outer covering. Between this and the mucous | membrane of the duct there is a little intermediate tissue, in which run veins of ; considerable size connected with the plexus of the inferior turbinated bone. The duct does not usually open directly into the nasal cavity at the lower end of the \ bony canal, but pierces the nasal mucous membrane very obliquely, so that a flap \ of mucous membrane covers the lower border of the opening in the bone, upon which flap the tears first trickle after escaping from the duct proper. The sac and nasal duct together constitute the lachrymal canal, lined through- out by a continuous mucous membrane. This membrane presents folds in some situations, especially near the opening of the canaliculi, at the junction of the sac and duct and at the lower end of the duct. That at the top of the duct is the most important, as it sometimes interferes with the proper flow of tears out of the sac. The total length of the lachrymal canal is roughly twenty-four millimetres, half of . this being sac, and half nasal duct. If, however, we reckon as duct the oblique passage through the nasal mucous membrane, this measurement may occasionally be increased by eight or ten millimetres. The lachrymal sac, when distended, ; measures about six millimetres from before backwards, by four millimetres trans- ■ versely. The nasal duct is practically circular, and has a diameter of about three millimetres, rather less at its junction with the sac, where we find the narrowest ■ part of the whole lachrymal canal.THE EAE By ARTHUR HENSMAN, F.R.C.S. LECTURER OX ANATOMY AT THE MIDDLESEX HOSPITAL MEDICAL COLLEGE; AXD SURGEOX TO THE THROAT AND EAR DEPARTMENT OF THE MIDDLESEX HOSPITAL. The organ of hearing may be divided into three parts : —the EXTERNAL EAR, which includes the pinna and external auditory meatus; the MIDDLE EAR, or tympanum, with its ventilating shaft the Eustachian tube ; and the INTERNAL EAR, which includes the osseous labyrinth, within which is placed—the essential portion of the organ—the membranous labyrinth. THE EXTEKNAL EAR The Pinna, or Auricle, is attached to the side of the head, midway between the forehead and occiput. Its level is indicated by horizontal lines extending backwards from the eyebrows above, and from the tip of the nose below. Somewhat pyriform in shape, its irregular concave outer surface is turned more or less forwards, but the Fig. 493.—External View of the Left Auricle. Triangulj fossa angle of inclination varies considerably in different subjects. The incurved rim of the ear, which divides its surfaces, commences below in a deep concavity which surrounds, like the mouth of a trumpet, the external auditory meatus. This rim is called the helix, and, traced round the ear, ends below at the posterior margin of the lobule. On the upper part of the inverted edge of the helix a little irregular process often exists, which has been regarded as the shrivelled tip of the primitive908 OBGANS OF SPECIAL SENSE j j ear. The hollow from which it starts is called the concha. Within the helix, but separated by the scaphoid fossa (fossa of the helix) runs a second curved ridge, the antihelix. It commences below in the little process known as the antitragus, and | bifurcating superiorly, bounds a shallow fossa just above the concha, the so-called i triangular fossa (fossa of the antihelix). The concha bounded by the helix is | deeply notched below (incisura intertragica). Overlapping the commencement of | the notch before and behind are two eminences, the anterior and larger, the tragus ; \ the posterior, the antitragus. The auricle varies greatly in different individuals, i and the lobe perhaps more than any other part. | The cartilaginous framework of the ear, although it does not enter into all I its parts, gives to it the general character and appearance already described. | It consists of pliable reticular cartilage of the yellow elastic kind. It does not enter into the formation of the lobule, which consists entirely of dense connec- tive tissue and fat. Its lower portion is so rolled upon itself as to form a tube > incomplete above, which tails ofi' as it passes inwards to be attached to the lower , third of the external auditory meatus. This attachment is effected by means of a dense fibro-elastic tissue which allows considerable shifting on traction of ^ the pinna upwards and backwards. A section passing through the orifice of the ' meatus shows the cartilage greatly in excess of the fibrous membrane which Fig. 494.—Section through the Orifice of the Eight External Auditory Meatus. Fissure of Santorini. Posterior auricular artery- Section of cartilaginous portion. —-- EXTERNAL AUDITORY CANAL Lining membrane - —Fissure of Santorini completes its contour. Deeper sections show the cartilage diminishing more 1 and more until it forms scarcely a third of the lumen of the tube near the bony meatus. The channel is traversed by a couple of fissures, the fissures of Santorini; but these are not constant in their number, extent, or direction. These intervals are filled with fibrous tissue, and allow the canal to be straightened by traction on the pinna. The lower segment of the cartilaginous meatus is in close contact with , | the parotid gland. An abscess in this region may thus burrow through the fissures : and discharge itself through the external meatus. There is also a gap between , ^ the helix and the tragus bridged over by a band of dense fibrous tissue. Several fissures traverse the cartilage, and a deep cleft dividing the antihelix severs the j ^ caudate process from the rest of the cartilage below. , Ligaments.—An anterior ligament connects the helix with the root of the | zygoma, and a posterior passes from the concha to the mastoid process. j ^.^ A pair of ligaments belong to the cartilage itself, the strong band already \ described completing the orifice of the meatus, and one less marked passing between j | the concha and the processus caudatus. | , Muscles.—The extrinsic muscles, the attollens, attrahens, and retrahens aurem, have been described on page 458. The special intrinsic muscles are six in number. ^ They are difficult to display, and sometimes appear to be absent. i |909 EXTEBNAL EAB Helicis major is a narrow slip which arises from a small tubercle, and passes upwards along the rim of the helix to near its summit. Helicis minor is an oblique fasciculus overlying the commencement of the helix. The tragieus consists of nearly vertical fibres lying over the outer surface of the tragus. The antitragicus arises from the outer surface of the antitragus to pass to the caudate process. The transversus auris consists of mixed muscular and tendinous fibres which with the following lies on the cranial aspect of the pinna, and traverses the hollow formed between the bulging of the concha and the convexity corresponding to the groove of the helix. The obliquus auris crosses the hollow between the concha and fossa of the antihelix. Fig. 495.—External and Internal Surface of the Cartilage of the Eight Pinna and its Muscles, etc. Helicis major Obliqmis Transversus Anti-tragicus Tragieus Fissure of Santorini Vessels.—The arteries are the posterior auricular from the external carotid, and the anterior auricular from the temporal. The veins enter the posterior auricular and temporal. Nerves.—The great auricular supplies the cranial aspect, sending a few filaments to the outer surface near the lobule. The posterior auricular of the facial and the auricular branch of the pneumo- gastric also supply the cranial aspect. The auriculo-temporal supplies the outer aspect of the pinna. The tip of the ear at the inner part receives the auricular branch of the small occipital. This is sometimes replaced by a branch from the great occipital. The intrinsic muscles receive their supply from the temporal and posterior auricular branches of the facial. The External Auditory Meatus is about an inch and a quarter in length (3 cm.). It commences at the bottom of the concha, and passes inwards and a little forwards to end at the membrana tympani. It is narrower at its centre. Near its orifice it is oval from above downwards, but at its termination it is somewhat broader from side to side. Owing to the obliquity of the membrana tympani, the floor is longer than the roof, and the anterior longer than the posterior wall of the canal.910 OBGANS OF SPECIAL SENSE Its cartilaginous portion, which is about half an inch (1-3 cm.) in length, is formed by the incomplete tube of cartilage already described, with fibrous membrane to complete its upper and back part. The osseous portion of the tube is about three-quarters of an inch (14-16 mm.) in length, and is slightly curved, with its convexity looking upwards and backwards (page 45). ^ The lining membrane is a reflexion from the skin externally. It is thick and strong in the cartilaginous, but becomes thinner in the osseous portion ; especially is this the case near the membrana tympani, over which it is reflected to form its cuticular layer. In the cartilaginous portion the dermis is supplied with numerous hairs, and sebaceous glands open into their follicles. Tubular ceruminous glands, the orifices of which stud the whole of the cartilaginous portion, appear as dark points to the naked eye. Fig. 496.—Section of the Middle and External Ear.

The arteries are derived from the posterior auricular, temporal, and internal maxillary ; and the nerves from the auriculo-temporal. THE MIDDLE EAR The Membrana Tympani is an irregularly rounded concave membrane stretched obliquely across the bottom of the osseous meatus in such wise as to form an obtuse angle with its upper wall (according to Von Troltsch, 140°) and an acute one with its lower.MIDDLE EAB 911 The circumference of the membrane is lodged in the groove of the tympanic ring. Above and in front where the ring is wanting there is a slight recess known as the notch of Eivini, and here the membrane is extended outwards, to unite with the grooveless margin of the tympanum to form what is known as the Rivinian segment. The shape of the membrane varies with that of the inner end of the meatus. Its long axis is from above downwards and forwards. The membrane, broadly viewed, is concave externally, and convex towards the cavity of the tympanum. This is mainly due to the traction of the handle of the malleus, which descends obliquely downwards and backwards between its two inner layers to a point a little below the centre of the membrane. This curvature is deepest at the umbo, opposite the flattened extremity of the handle. In front of and below the umbo, extending towards the periphery, the membrane is slightly convex externally. At the anterior superior pole, the short process of the malleus is plainly visible as a rounded point projecting outwards. A fold of the membrane passes backwards, and another forwards from this spot, and above these folds may, under favourable Fig. 497.—^External View of the Left Membrana Tympani. (Enlarged from life.) Sbrapnell's membrane I Posterior fold of membrana tympani Anterior fold of membrana tympani SHORT PROCESS OF MALLEUS UMBO, OR LOWER EXTREMITY OF HANDLE OF MALLEUS Cone of ligbt conditions, be seen two short, tightly stretched striae, which, taking origin from the corners of the notch of Eivini above, converge as they descend to meet at the short process. The membrane between these stride and the edge of the notch is thin and flaccid, and appears above the short process as a small pit-like depression (membrana Shrapnelli). An anastomosis between the tympanic vessels and those of the external meatus occurs at this spot. \ Viewed from within, the head of the malleus is seen above the membrane articulating with the incus, its curved handle passing downwards and slightly back- wards between its layers, and strongly projecting from the inner surface. The chorda tympani nerve may be seen crossing the neck of the malleus forwards to the Glaserian fissure. Folds of the membrane occur in front of and behind the malleus, forming what are known as the anterior and posterior pouches of the membrana tympani. The free margin of the posterior pouch is commonly well marked. Passing slightly downwards and outwards to the base of the handle of the malleus, is the strongly marked fold containing the tendon of the tensor tympani muscle. Structure.—The membrana tympani consists of three layers—a special fibrous layer, with a cuticular coverings externally continuous with that which lines the r912 OBGANS OF SPECIAL SENSE I j auditory meatus; and a mucous lining internally derived from the tympanic j cavity. | The fibrous layer consists of two lamellae closely connected—an external, in 1 which the fibres radiate from the handle of the malleus ; and an internal, the fibres | of which are arranged concentrically, and are especially strong at the circumference, i The membrane of Shrapnell is extremely thin, and consists only of the outer | and inner layers, the fibrous layer being absent. I The handle of the malleus descends between the two inner layers, accompanied | by the vessels, which are often clearly visible in the living membrane. i The Tympanic Cavity is irregular in shape, laterally compressed, and communi- ! cates posteriorly with the mastoid antrum and cells. It contains air, which reaches ^ it through the Eustachian tube, and is crossed from without inwards by a chain of j movable bones—the tympanic ossicles—through which vibrations which reach the membrana tympani are conducted to the internal ear. Fig. 498.—Internal View of Eight Membrana Tympani. (Enlarged.) HEAD OF MALLEUS CHORDA TYMPANI NERVE Tendon of tensor tympani HANDLE OF MALLEUS Tensor tympani muscle EUSTACHIAN TUBE The roof, which is about three lines in breadth, is thin, and separates the cavity from the interior of the cranium. The floor is much narrower, but is similarly separated from the jugular fossa. The outer wall is chiefly formed by the membrana tympani, already described, and the bony wall above and below it. The cl'iorda tymimni nerve, which traverses the outer wall, enters by a minute orifice, the aperture of the iter chordeB posterius, and leaves the cavity by the iter chordae anterius, which leads into the canal of Huguier. The Glaserian fissure lies immediately below the latter orifice, but these minute openings are hidden by the mucous lining. The inner wall is vertical, and looks directly outwards; it presents the fenestra ovalis and fenestra rotunda with the intervening grooved promontory, which corresponds to the first turn of the cochlea, and the ridge marking the course of the Fallopian canal, which is traversed by the facial nerve.THE EAR 913 The reniform orifice of the fenestra ovalis leads into the vestibule, and is occu- pied by the base of the stapes with its annular ligament, in addition to the lining membrane derived from the cavities with which it communicates. The fenestra rotunda leads into the cochlea, and is closed by a membrane (the secondary membrane of Scarpa), concave towards the tympanum. This consists of three layers—a middle fibrous layer, coveied by the mucous lining of the tympanum externally, and by the serous layer of the cochlea internally. The posterior wall presents the hollow pyramid which lodges the stcqjedms muscle and the openings which lead into the mastoid antrum and cells ; these vary much in size, and receive a mucous lining from the cavity. The anterior wall, which is separated by a thin layer of bone from the carotid canal, presents the orifice of the small canal, filled in the recent state by the tensor tympani muscle, the orifice of the Eustachian tube, and the intervening plate of bone, the processus cochleariformis. The EUSTACHIAN TUBE is nearly two inches (2*5 cm.) in length, and passes from the tympanum downwards, forwards, and inwards. It is partly bony and partly cartilaginous. The osseous portion is about half an inch (1-3 cm.) in length. It commences just below the orifice which transmits the tendon of the tensor tympani muscle, and, gradually contracting, ends by a jagged and oblique orifice between the petrous and squamous portions of the temporal bone. To this is attached the cartilaginous portion of the tube, which is about an inch in length. This is composed of an elon- gated triangular plate, so folded upon itself as to leave an interval below which is completed by fibrous tissue. At first narrow, the canal becomes much expanded towards its trumpet-shaped termination. Its orifice, which is somewhat oval, opens into the upper part and side of .the pharynx, on a level with the inferior meatus. The mucous membrane possesses a ciliated lining. It is thin near the tympanic cavity, but it is much more vascular, thicker, and possesses mucous glands and adenoid tissue near its pharyngeal orifice. Sections of the cartilaginous portion of the tube show that the cartilaginous plate is curled round like a hook above, and that the membranous portion is thin where it is attached to the tip of the hook, but that it becomes much thicker below. A small space near the bony portion of the tube, immediately below the hook, remains permanently open, but elsewhere the walls are in contact, except when separated by the action of the tensor palati muscle, or when forcibly driven asunder, as in the act of sneezing, etc. A number of small sesamoid fibro-cartilages, some of which are visible to the naked eye, are buried in the submucous tissue. The ossicles of the ear are described on pages 73-75. Articulation of the Ossicles.—The malleus with, the incus. I The oblong articular surface which descends as far as the neck, on the posterior surface of the head of the malleus, is divided into two portions by a nearly vertical I edge. The incus presents a corresponding surface similarly divided into two por- [tions, and both of these surfaces are coated by a delicate layer of hyaline cartilage. A thin capsule, from the inner surface of which a delicate wedge-shaped meniscus projects from above into the cavity of the joint, is attached to the grooves, which i limit the articular surfaces. The mechanism has been compared by Helmholtz to |the check movement inside the key of a Geneva watch, and permits considerable gliding between the two bones. The incus with the stapes,—This joint is formed by the convex surface of the [lenticular process (orbicular bone) which terminates the long crus of the incus and the corresponding concave surface of the head of the stapes. Both surfaces are covered with a layer of hyaline cartilage. i The elastic capsular ligament permits but very slight separation between the 3 N914 OBGANS OF SPECIAL SENSE \ I bones, but allows a somewhat freer lateral movement. This articulation has beenj regarded by some writers as a synchondrosis, but it is now usually described as a| true joint. i The stapes with the margin of the fenestra ovalis.—The so-called annular! ligament is not equally broad throughout, and consists of elastic fibres which! radiate as they pass outwards from the edge of the footpiece of the stapes to the| margin of the fenestra. According to Toynbee, these edges are covered by a thin; layer of cartilage. i The Ligaments of the Ossicles.—In addition to the capsular ligaments alreadyl described, certain well-marked bands limit the movements of the ossicles. | The superior ligament of the malleus descends as a firm rounded band from! the upper and outer wall of the tympanic cavity to the head of the malleus. It limits the outward movement of the handle of the malleus. Fig. 499.—Section of the Tympanum, etc. (Enlarged.) The anterior ligament of the malleus is broad and strong. According t Helmholtz it encircles the long process of the malleus, and is inserted into the fore part of its neck and head. Some of the fibres of this ligament have been described as muscular under th( name of the laxator tympani muscle. But although occasionally muscular fibre can be detected, in the majority of cases they appear to be absent. The external ligament of the malleus prevents the handle of the malleus bein turned too much outwards. It passes from the margins of the notch of Eivini t( the short process of the malleus. The ligament of the incus.—The short crus of the incus is covered with a laye of fibro-cartilage and rests on a depression of the posterior tympanic wall, clos to the orifice leading into the mastoid cells. The posterior ligament binds th process to this wall. The Muscles of the Tympanum.—Two muscles—the tensor tympani and th915 THE EAB stapedius, both of which he within bony canals—transmit their tendons into the cavity of the tympanum for insertion into the chain of ossicles. The tensor tympani is a penniform muscle about half an inch in length, and arises in small part from the cartilaginous Eustachian tube and adjacent surface of the sphenoid bone as well as from the wall of the canal in which it lies. The tendon, which extends outwards almost at a right angle to the belly of the muscle, can be traced some distance inwards on its lower aspect. It is inserted on the inner margin of the handle of the malleus, near its root. The tendon glides within a sheath continuous with the periosteum lining the canal and surrounded by mucous membrane. This muscle draws the handle of the malleus, and with it the membrana tympani, inwards. The stapedius is a pyriform muscle, and arises from the interior of the pyramidal eminence which projects from the posterior wall of the tympanum. The tendon, which can be traced inwards for more than half the length of the muscle, passes through the aperture at the summit of the eminence, to be inserted into the posterior aspect of the neck of the stapes. Its tendon, like that of the tensor tympani, is surrounded by a fibrous sheath enveloped in the tympanic mucous membrane. This muscle depresses the posterior, whilst at the same time it slightly raises the anterior, end of the foot-piece of the stapes. Nerves.—The stapedius is supplied by the facial nerve. The tensor tympani receives a filament from the otic ganglion which is probably derived from the I motor portion of the fifth nerve. i The Mucous Membrane of the Tympanum is continuous through the Eustachian tube with that which lines the pharynx. It is thin and transparent, and in places it is easily detached. Several vascular folds extend from the tympanic walls to the ossicles, all of which receive a complete covering. The following are the most important. {a) A prominent fold descends from the superior wall to the head of the malleus and the upper margin of the body of the incus, and surrounds anteriorly the tendon of the tensor tympani muscle. {h) A second fold envelops the stapes, forming between its crura the so-called obturator ligament of the stapes, and spreads posteriorly over its hinder crus to 3nvelop the tendon of the stapedius muscle. (c) The folds which form the inferior boundaries of the so-called pouches of the membrana tympani have already been described. Other folds which are inconstant and irregular appear to be the shrunken remains of the gelatinous connective tissue which fills the cavity in the foetal 3tate. The mucous membrane of the roof of the tympanum and that which lines :he membrana tympani and covers the ossicles possesses a flattened non-ciliated epithelium. Elsewhere for the most part, including the Eustachian tube, it is iolumnar and ciliated. j Vessels and nerves of the tympanum.—Arteries.—The tympanic branch of phe internal maxillary which passes through the Glaserian fissure, and the stylo- jnastoid branch of the posterior auricular which passes through the Fallopian ;anal, supply the front and back part of the tympanic cavity, and form a vascular chain around the circumference of the membrana tympani. In addition io these chief branches the hiatus Fallopii transmits the petrosal branch from the niddle meningeal, whilst fine branches leave the carotid artery as it traverses the iiarotid canal. The ascending pharyngeal sends branches to the Eustachian tube, pome of which reach the tympanum, ii, ^1 Veins.—The veins empty into the superior petrosal sinus and into the temporo- laxillary. Nerves.—The tympanic mucous membrane is supplied by the tympanic plexus an^ttkhich occupies the grooves on the promontory and inner wall of the cavity. I 3 N 2OBGANS OF SPECIAL SENSE 916 The plexus is formed by the following nerves. The tympanic branch of the glosso-pharyngeal, which enters the cavity through a foramen in the floor ; a communicating branch from the carotid plexus i of the sympathetic which passes through the carotid canal. A branch from the great superficial petrosal, which enters by the inner wall close in front of the fenestra ovahs ; and one from the small superficial petrosal, which enters near the canal for the tensor tympani. The com^se of the chorda tympani nerve has already been sufficiently indicated j (pages 808, 912). THE INTEENAL EAE, OR LABYRINTH ; I The INTEENAL EAR, or LABYRINTH, is the essential part of the organ of . hearing, and receives the terminations of the auditory nerve. I The Osseous Labyrinth is divided into three portions : the vestibule, the semi- I circular canals, and the cochlea—recesses hollowed in the substance of the petrous i portion of the temporal bone. Fig. 500.—The Osseous Labyrinth of the Right Side. (Modified from Soemmerring. Enlarged.) Commencement of first turn of the eoelilea The Vestibule lies between the cochlea and semicircular canals, on the inner i side of the tympanum. It is a laterally compressed ovoidal cavity, and is about one-fifth of an inch in horizontal and vertical measurement. ! The outer wall presents the fenestra ovalis filled with the foot-piece of the j stapes and its annular ligament. On its inner wall there is a small saucer-like j depression, the fovea hemispherica, perforated below and in front by several minute I orifices (macula cribrosa) for the filaments of the auditory nerve. Immediately I behind this is a vertical ridge, the pyramidal eminence or crista vestibuli, behind j which is the orifice of the aqueductus vestibuli. | On the roof there is a second depression, oval in shape, the fovea hemielliptica. '|j The two depressions are separated by the pyramidal eminence. | Behind, the semicircular canals open by five orifices ; and in front by means of | a large oval opening the vestibular cavity communicates with the scala vestibuli | of the cochlea, the apertura scales vestibuli. The Three Semicircular Canals are placed above and behind the vestibule. They are unequal in length, but each forms the greater part of a circle, is laterally compressed, and measures about one-twentieth of an inch (1-5 mm.) in diameter (page 45). One extremity of each canal is suddenly dilated to nearly double its sizeTHE EAB 917 to form the ampulla. As two of the canals join to open by a common orifice, collectively they present only five openings. The superior semicircular canal, the highest of the canals, is almost vertical, and is directed transversely. A smooth eminence on the anterior surface of the petrous bone closely corresponds to the summit of its arch. Its ampuUary end is at the outer extremity, and presents a separate opening at the upper part of the vestibule ; the opposite end, which is not dilated, joins to form a common orifice with the similar extremity of the posterior canal.

Its dilated end is placed at the loAver and back part of the vestibule ; its non-dilated extremity joins the superior canal. It is placed nearly vertically, and is directed backwards. The external semicircular canal curves horizontally outwards, and presents two openings in the upper and back part of the vestibular cavity. The Cochlea has a rough resemblance to a snail's shell, and coils itself almost horizontally immediately in front of the vestibule. Its base corresponds to the lower and front part of the fundus of the internal auditory meatus, and is there Fig. 502.—Interior of the Osseous Cochlea. (Enlarged.) Scala vestibuli Scala tympani Lamina spiralis marked by the series of minute holes which form the tractus spiralis foraminu- ilentus, whilst its apex is directed forwards and outwards, towards the upper and [fore part of the inner wall of the tympanum. [ The cochlea is about a quarter of an inch (6 mm.) in length, and its basal measure- [ment is nearly the same. It is composed of a central pillar, the modiolus, or columella, j around which curls for two and a half turns a spiral canal, which contains a [delicate spiral shelf or plate, the lamina spiralis. This partially divides its cavity into two portions, as it follows its windings from base to apex. Near the apex918 OBGANS OF SPECIAL SENSE it ends in a hook-like process, the hamulus, which bounds a small opening, the helicotrema. The osseous spiral canal is nearly an inch and a half (about 3-5 cm.) in length. The lamina spiralis is thin and dense in structure at its edge, but it is spongy and channelled with canals for nerves and blood-vessels where it starts shelf-like from the modiolus. The spiral canal of the modiolus coils round the pillar as it tunnels the base of the spiral lamina. In the recent state, membranous structures complete the bony partition into two separate chambers, or scalse: the scala vestibuli and the scala tympani, which communicate through the helicotrema at the summit of the cochlea. The scala vestibuli commences from the cavity of the cochlea ; in its first turn it is somewhat narrower than the scala tympani. The scala tympani commences at the fenestra rotunda, which is filled with the secondary membrane of Scarpa, and forms a kind of window which shuts it off from the cavity of the tympanum. Near its commencement is the small orifice of the aqueductus cochleae, which lodges a minute vein, and forms a communication with the subarachnoid space. The central axis, or modiolus, extends from the base to the apex of the cochlea. It starts with a broad base where it corresponds with the first turn of the cochlea, and it is pierced by minute canals to receive the filaments of the cochlear division Fig. 503.—Section of the Osseous Cochlea. (Enlarged.) Lamina spiralis Seala vestibuli Lamina spiralis Seala tympani Modiolus Central eanal of tlie modiolus Termination of external auditory meatus of the auditory nerve. In the second coil the axis is diminished by more than half, and it terminates in the remaining half coil or cupula in a bony plate, the infundibulum, which expands towards the summit of the cochlea, with which it becomes continuous. The central canal of the modiolus runs through its centre. The Membranous Labyrinth, which lies within the bony labyrinth just described, receives the terminations of the auditory nerve. It is for the most part separated by the perilymph from the membrane which lines the bony chambers, and it contains within its own cavity the fluid endolymph. In the vestibule and semicircular canals it bears a near resemblance (though it is much smaller) to the enclosing structures, but in the cochlea it not only divides its canal into the two scalse, but forms between them a third space, the canal of the cochlea. Within the vestibule the membranous labyrinth consists of two sacs, which do not directly communicate : the utricle, connected with the semicircular canals ; and the saccule, with the cochlea. The Utricle is the larger. It is oblong, laterally compressed; it occupies the upper and back part of the cavity, and is in contact with the fovea hemielliptica. Filaments of the auditory nerve are distributed to the wall of the sac opposite the crista vestibuli, passing through the bony foramina already described. Its wall is here thicker than elsewhere, and calcareous particles (otoliths) are attached to its inner surface. Behind, the cavity communicates by five orifices with the semi- circular canals.THE EAB 919 The Saccule, which is sHghtly flattened, occupies the front and lower part of the cavity at the opening of the scala vestibuh of the cochlea. From the hollow of the fovea hemispherica it receives numerous nerve filaments, and presents a thickened area with attached otoliths. The membranous canal of the cochlea is connected with the saccule by a short canal, the canalis reuniens. Fig, 504.—Membranous Labyeinth (magnified), with Nerves.

CANALIS " AMPULLA I REUNIENS j The two sacs are indirectly connected by means of a small tube which leaves the saccule to join the commencement of a minute canal, as it passes from the (utricle to enter the aqueductus vestibuli. Within each semicircular canal the membranous labyrinth occupies less than a third of the area of the tube, but follows its curves and repeats its ampuUary lenlargement; and here the wall is thicker and more opaque, and more completely fills the cavity. The membranous ampullae are flattened on their external walls.920 OBGANS OF SPECIAL SENSE where they receive vascular and nervous filaments, and their cavities are partially divided by a transverse crest or ridge (crista acustica). Within the canal the outer convex border is fixed to the osseous wall. Structure.—The membranous labyrinth consists of three layers: a tunica pro- pria, with a fibrous investment externally, and an epithelial lining within. Within the cochlea, the membranous structures divide the canal into three compartments. The lamina spiralis (which in macerated specimens only partially divides it) is continued into a projection from the periosteum of the outer wall (spiral ligament) by means of a distinct membrane, membrana basilaris, thus completely roofing in the scala tympani which before communicated with the scala vestibuli. In addition, a delicate membrane, the membrane of E-eissner, stretches from the opposite surface of the lamina from near its free edge to the periosteum of the outer wall. Shutting off a small triangular space (scala media) from the scala vestibuli, the sides of which are bounded by the two membranes (basilar and Eeissner), and whose base externally is formed by the osseous wall with its periosteal lining. This canal is lined with epithelium, winds through the whole length of the cochlea, and is commonly known as the ductus cochlearis, or Fig. 506.—Enlarged View of Longitudinal Section of the First Turn of the Cochlea, showing the Positions and Boundaries of the Three Scal^. membranous canal of the cochlea. It ends blindly by pointed extremities. That which corresponds to the floor of the vestibule receives the small canal already described, the canalis reuniens, which proceeds from the saccule. The canal of the cochlea and the saccule are thus brought into communication. The Auditory Nerve divides into two portions before it reaches the fundus of the external auditory meatus. The superior division consists of three branches which pass to the crista vestibuli, through special openings, to be distributed to the utricle and the ampullary enlargements of the superior and external semicircular canals. The inferior division supplies the cochlea through the foramina of the tractus foraminulentus ; also a branch to the saccule, the filaments of which pass through the openings of the fovea hemispherica; and a longer branch to the posterior semicircular canal, which reaches it by a special channel behind the foramina which transmit the filament's to the saccule. Vessels.—The internal auditory branch of the basilar artery, which accompanies the auditory nerve, supplies both the vestibule and cochlea, with their membranous contents. The veins correspond and open into the inferior petrosal sinus, which also receives the minute veins which traverse the aqueductus vestibuli.THE TONGUE By AETHUR HENSMAN, F.R.C.S. LECTURER OX ANATOMY AT THE MIDDLESEX HOSPITAL MEDICAL COLLEGE; AND SURGEON TO THE THROAT AND EAR DEPARTMENT OP THE MIDDLESEX HOSPITAL. The tongue is a freely movable, highly sensitive, and muscular organ, and is ndowed with the special sense of taste. It participates, moreover, in the function of speech, and plays an important part in mastication and deglutition. Its upper surface, or dorsum, with its sides and tip, are free, whilst its base is attached by muscles to the hyoid bone and lower jaw. Folds of mucous membrane loosely connect it with the epiglottis and soft palate, as well as with the symphysis iof the lower jaw. From beneath its rounded borders the mucous covering becomes [continuous with the inner surface of the gums. The anterior two-thirds of the [tongue occupies the floor of the mouth, lying between the halves of the lower jaw, with its convex dorsum overarched by the vault of the palate, and its sides and tip |in contact with the teeth and gums. The posterior third of the dorsum forms a ounded surface overhanging the epiglottis. The mucous membrane, which is really a modified skin, covers the whole of the {free surface of the tongue. It forms three folds: the glosso-epiglottidean in con- nection with the epiglottis ; and on each side of the median fold—^fraenum epiglot- tidis—is formed the glosso-epiglottidean pouch, or vallecula, which is bounded ^xternally by the more rounded lateral folds. On each side of the tongue, near the function of the posterior and middle] third, the membrane ascends to form the anterior pillars of the fauces, and in front beneath the tip it forms the sharp fold of the frsenum linguae (fig. 509). A slight longitudinal groove, the median raphe, divides the dorsum of the tongue along its anterior two-thirds. It ends posteriorly near a small foramen, [the foramen csBCum, which represents the upper termination of the thyro-glossal !uct. The orifice, however, is not at all constant in the adult tongue, although ccasionally it is present, and may sometimes lead into the still patent duct which imnels the tongue as far as the body of the hyoid bone. The course of the bliterated duct may in many cases be demonstrated. The foramen c^cum is easily seen in the foetus at the angle of meeting of two tallow grooves which form the V-shaped line behind the circumvallate papillse. 'his groove indicates the line of junction of the anterior and posterior portions of phe tongue, and is faintly visible in the adult organ. The papilla crowd the anterior two-thirds of the dorsum as well as the sides md tip of the tongue, but at the back they are small and hidden by the epithelial eating. Of the papillae three chief kinds can be distinguished. The circumvallate or calyciform papillae are the largest, but they are few in lumber, varying from seven or eight to twelve, and they form a V-shaped line in -ront of and parallel with the groove already mentioned.OBGANS OF SPECIAL SENSE 922 Each papilla presents a narrow attached base and a broad free end, and is seated in a circular cup which is surrounded by a rim or vallum. Upon the bases of most of these papillae a central depression marks the orifice of one or more glands. Secondary papillae lie hidden under the thick epithelial covering both of the chief papilla and the circular rim which surrounds it. The fungiform papillae are more thinly covered w^ith epithelium, and they are redder in colour than the smaller papillaB amongst which they are scattered. They occur irregularly over the dorsum, sides, and tip of the tongue, being attached by a Fig. 507.—Dorsum of the Tongue. EXTREMITY OF CORNU OF False vocal cord LOWER END OF PHARYNX comparatively narrow base with a broader, rounded, and free extremity, and, hke the circumvallate, are studded with smaller secondary papillae.

They faintly ridge the organ wdth delicate lines, which posteriorly lie parallel with the circumvallate papilla, but become more and more transverse in direction as they approach the tip and sides of the tongue. They present secondary papillae upon their surfaces thickly overlaid with epithelium.923 THE TONGUE The lingual glands are especially abundant near the foramen caecum and in the neighbourhood of the circumvallate papillae, as well as along the borders of the tongue.

This often becomes much developed, and gives to this part of the tongue an irregular nodular appearance. A fibrous septum separates the halves of the tongue and extends in the middle plane from base to apex; and a strong fibrous membrane, the hypoglossal membrane, passes from beneath the base of the tongue to the body of the hyoid bone. ! The Muscles of the Tongue.—The muscles of the tongue are both extrinsic, and special or intrinsic. The extrinsic muscles are the hyo-giossus, genio-hyo-glossus, stylo-glossus, palato-giossus, and a small part of the superior constrictor. The intrinsic muscles.—The lingualis superior constitutes a superficial longi- j, tudinal stratum, which extends from the base to the tip of the organ, immediately I beneath the mucous membrane. The fibres form short fascicles attached to the overlying tissues, and are placed between the hyo- and stylo-glossi muscles of the opposite sides of the tongue, both pairs of which, near the base, overlap the fibres of the lingualis. The inferior lingualis is composed of two bands which reach from the base to the apex on the under surface of the tongue. Posteriorly some of the fibres become attached to the body of the hyoid bone. Each of these bands is placed between the hyo- and genio-hyo-glossus, and near the tip some of its fibres mix with those of the stylo-glossus muscle. The transverse fibres mixed with fat lie between the two muscles just described, and form a considerable part of the bulk of the tongue. They take origin from the median fibrous septum, and, curving outwards and upwards, are inserted into the sides and dorsum of the organ. The vertical fibres decussate with the transverse, and pass from the dorsum to the under surface of the tongue in curves with their concavities looking outwards. The fibres become shorter as they approach the margin of the tongue. Arteries.—The arteries are derived from the lingual, facial, and ascending pharyngeal. Nerves.—The nerves are—the lingual branch of the mandibular division of the fifth, which supplies the papillse of the fore part and sides of the tongue ; the lingual branch of the glosso-pharyngeal, which supplies the base and sides, in- cluding the circumvallate papillaB; and fine branches from the superior laryngeal, which reach the root close to the epiglottis. The hypoglossal supplies the muscular substance of the tongue, as well as most of the extrinsic muscles; and the chorda tympani through the facial contributes also some filaments.THE NOSE By ARTHUR HENSMAN, F.R.C.S.

The nose includes a visible external portion, the nose proper ; and an internal cavity, the nasal fossa. The Nose Proper is triangular in shape ; its root above is at the forehead, from which the bridge or dorsum slopes downwards and forwards to end in a rounded tip or lobe. The base below overhangs the upper lip ; it here presents two orifices, the nostrils, which are divided by the columna.

Its sides slope from the dorsum outwards and backwards, and terminate below in the alse or wings, which bound the nostrils externally. It presents a dense unyielding bony framework, formed by the two nasal bones, with the nasal processes of the maxillas above, and by the projecting anterior nasal spine below. To this is added a yielding cartilaginous portion, which completes the organ, forming its chief part.THE NOSE 927 The nose is enveloped in skin, lined by a mucous membrane, and supplied with vessels and nerves, and its cartilages are acted upon by small muscles. The cartilages.—The principal cartilages are five in number : a pair above, the superior lateral; a pair below, the inferior lateral; and the cartilage of the septum, the persistent unossified remnant of the facial segment of the chondro-cranium (page 97). With these must be included a group of small irregular cartilages known as sesamoid and accessory quadrate. These cartilages, ensheathed in perichondrium, are for the most part loosely held together by tough intervening fibrous tissue, and this in turn becomes con- tinuous with the periosteum of the surrounding bones. The upper lateral cartilages are nearly flat and somewhat triangular in shape, each presenting an outer and an inner surface. Their anterior margins are continuous above with the rounded borders of a shallow groove which furrows the cartilage of the septum; but below for about two- thirds of their extent, though their edges are closely applied to the borders of the Fig. 513.—Antekior View of the Nose, showing its Cartilages, etc. ORIFICE OF LACHRYMAL CANAL GROOVE ON ANTERIOR BORDER OF SEPTAL CARTILAGE ACCESSORY QUADRATE CARTILAGES SESAMOID CARTILAGES CELLULAR TISSUE OF ALA f^ASAL BONE NASAL PROCESS OF THE MAXILLA UPPER LATERAL CARTILAGE OUTER PLATE OF LOWER LATERAL CARTILAGE groove, there is on each side a narrow cleft of separation which opens out below into an angular notch. Their curved posterior margins are firmly attached superficially by somewhat jagged edges to the nasal bones ; but deeply, and especially near the septum, they underlie these bones for a considerable distance. The rest of the border is smooth, free, and loosely connected by intervening fibrous tissue to the nasal process of the maxilla. Their inferior borders are connected with the lower lateral cartilages ; one or more narrow plates of cartilage occasionally intervene and fill the fibrous interval. On account of their continuity with the septal cartilage, the upper lateral cartilages should be regarded as its wings or lateral expansions. (Henle.) The lower lateral cartilages are thin, phant, and curved, and so folded back- I wards that each forms an inner and outer plate. ! The inner plates are loosely attached to one another, where they meet below j the septum to form the tip of the nose and fore part of the columna. The outer plates are oval, and curve backwards above the masses of dense cellular tissue which form the alse. They maintain the contour of the nostrils,OBGANS OF SPECIAL SENSE 928 and serve to keep these orifices open. Posteriorly they are connected by fibrous tissue to the nasal margin of the superior maxillaries. In this tissue are embedded several extremely thin and irregular cartilages named sesamoid, and above these commonly a pair still smaller, called accessory quadrate. ' The septal cartilage fills in the triangular interval of the bony septum. The anterior border is attached to the nasal bones at their junction below the crest, i Beyond it presents a shallow groove, the borders of which are at first continuous with the upper lateral cartilages, as already described. This groove becomes narrowed by the gradual approximation of its borders, which ultimately meet in a faint transverse ridge which terminates it below. Still lower, it dips for a short | distance between the inner plates of the lower lateral cartilages, beyond which these meet to form the tip of the nose. The posterior border is connected with the perpendicular plate of the ethmoid,' whilst its inferior is attached to the vomer, which is often channelled like the ethmoid plate to receive it. Immediately in front it is attached to the nasal spine of the maxillae. Fig. 514.—Under View of the Nose, showing its Cartilages, etc. of ala The cartilage does not simply dip into the groove which is more or less marked on the upper surface of the nasal spine, but broadens out to obtain the widest possible, though somewhat lax, attachment to it. Viewed from below, it appears to embrace the spine. The border of its rounded angle in front is somewhat thickened before terminating in a thin smooth edge. It is extremely thin near the centre. The shape of the septal cartilage varies in relation to the extent of ossification in the bony septum, and even in the adult a strip of cartilage may extend for a varying distance backwards and upwards between the vomer and ethmoid, sometimes even reaching the body of the sphenoid bone. It may be here noted that the septum of the nose is almost always straight in children and in aboriginal skulls (eightyper cent.); but in Europeans it is deflected to one or other side in the proportion of three out of every four. Jacobsonian cartilages. — In the septal cartilage above the opening of Stenson's canal there is a small pouch which presents a minute opening below. This is the ] representative of the Jacobsonian organ. A strip of cartilage underneath this, ; firmly adherent, but distinct from the septal cartilage, is known as the Jacobsonian cartilage. . |THE NOSE 929 Muscles.—The muscles are seven in number, and may be grouped as dilators and constrictors. The latter are comparatively feeble in their action. The dilators.—The pyramidalis nasi is a downward prolongation of the occipito- frontalis. Each muscle descends on the side of the nose, to blend, after becoming tendinous, with the compressor nasi. They diverge from one another as they pass downwards. The levator labii superioris alaeque nasi arises from the nasal process of the maxilla. It divides in its passage downwards, one slip being inserted into the cartilage of the wing, the other extending to the upper lip to blend with its muscular fibres. The two foregoing muscles may be regarded as extraordinary or reserve muscles of dilatation. Fig. 515.—Section showing Bony and Cartilaginous Septum. The dotted line indicates the course of the anterior palatine canal.

It is placed I between the skin and cartilage of the ala. I The dilator naris posterior arises from the edge of the nasal notch of the I maxilla and the sesamoid cartilages, to be inserted into the margin of the nostril. In paralysis of the facial nerve, a deep inspiration through the nostril produces complete collapse of its cartilaginous wall, thus showing the importance of the dilator muscles in keeping patent the nasal orifices. The constrictors, or compressors.—The compressor naris arises from the maxilla near the incisive fossa, its fibres mixing Avith those of the levator anguli oris. It expands as it passes inwards, to end in a thin aponeurosis, which 3 0930 - OBGANS OF SPECIAL SENSE i i joins with its fellow as well as with the pyramidalis, and it also blends with the subcutaneous tissue over the bridge of the nose. The depressor alse nasi arises from the incisor fossa; its fibres pass upwards to the septum and posterior part of the wing. ; The compressor narium minor consists of a few indistinct fibres, occasionally found between the alar cartilage and skin over the tip of the nose. ; These muscles are all supplied by the facial nerve. ' The skin covering the nose is for the most part thin and freely movable upon : the subjacent parts, but at the tip and over the cartilages it is much thicker and I more adherent and furnished with numerous sebaceous glands. I The mucous membrane becomes continuous with the skin at the nasal orifices, i and posteriorly with the membrane which lines the nasal fossae. Fig. 516.—Muscles of the Nose. (After Bonrgery.) Levator labii superioris alseque nasi Accessory slip of compressor. naris Dilator naris posterior Orbiciilaris oris- The vessels.—The arteries of the nose which arise from the facial are the | lateralis nasi and the artery to the septum derived from the coronary of the same ; trunk. This latter also supplies the ala. The nasal branch of the ophthalmic | and infraorbital are distributed to the sides and dorsum. j The veins terminate by joining the facial and ophthalmic. i The nerves.—The nerves are supplied by the facial, which is motory, and by the infratrochlear and nasal branch of the ophthalmic division of the fifth, which are : sensory. ; The nasal fossae.—The nasal fossas have been already described (page 86). } Tho mucous membrane (jntuitary or Sclineiderian).—In the recent state the j area of the fossae is much contracted by its mucous lining. This is loosely folded ij around the lower edges of the turbinal bones, and extends beyond them in front [, and behind. Especially is this marked where it envelops the inferior turbinal j bone, and it is here very thick and spongy. It is, moreover, thick where it covers jTHE NOSE 931 he septum, but thin at the bottom of the meatuses and within the sinuses. hme of the openings which are apparent in the dried skull are quite hidden in he recent state ; those, however, which lead into the air-spaces together with the achrymal duct remain patent, though the bony orifices are much reduced in size. Chere is a small conical closed sac, close to the septum at its fore part, which adicates the position of the now obliterated canal of Stenson. The termination is barked in the mouth by the incisive papilla. The membrane is continuous in rent through the anterior nares with the skin ; behind, it extends through the (osterior nares to line the naso-pharynx and tympanum with the mastoid cells by 7ay of the Eustachian orifice and tube. It is intimately adherent to the periosteum |,nd perichondrium. The acinous glands which are imbedded in its structure ecrete for the most part a thin watery fluid. They are especially large over the Fig. 517.—Oblique Section passing through the Nasal Foss^, just in front OF THE Posterior Nares. (Seen fi'om behind.) IIAN iferior turbinal bone, and very numerous at the middle and back of the fossae near 16 orifices of the posterior nares. The vestibule is lined with a scaly epithelium, behind which the cavity is jivided into an upper olfactory and a lower or respiratory region. The liactory region is lined with a columnar unciliated epithelium. The mucous [lembrane is here of a yellowish colour, thicker than elsewhere, and contains the ifactory cells of Max Schultze. The lower or respiratory is a much wider portion, in which the epithelium is plumnar and ciliated, and includes the inferior turbinal bone with the lower art of the fossa. The roof presents but one opening posteriorly which leads into the sphenoidal s-nus. The orifices in the cribriform j)late are entirely closed over. 3 o 2ORGANS OF SPECIAL SENSE 932 Fig. 518. Section of the Nose, showing the Turbinal Bones and Meatuses, WITH THE Openings in Dotted Outline. Frontal sinusTHE NOSE In the floor the openings leading into the anterior palatine canal are closed. The small cul-de-sac already described indicates their position. The superior meatus has but a single opening, which leads into the posterior ethmoidal cells. The spheno-palatine foramen is entirely covered by membrane. The middle meatus presents the orifice of the antrum. In front of this and hidden by the overhanging turbinal bone is the curved gutter-like cell leading [upwards from the fore part of the meatus to the frontal sinus, the infundibulum. It receives below the orifice of the middle, and above that of the anterior ethmoidal cells. In the inferior meatus is the orifice of the nasal duct. The opening is under cover of the fore part of the inferior turbinal bone. The mucous membrane - is arranged around the opening in a circular valve, which is sometimes double, 'known as the valve of Hasner (page 906). The nerves—The olfactory or special nerves of smell, the filaments of which pass through the foramina in the cribriform plate of the ethmoid bone, lie for some distance in the grooves of the bony walls before terminating in the Schneiderian membrane. Those which supply the septum ramify in its upper third, whilst those which reach the outer walls are distributed in two groups—a posterior, to supply the membrane covering the superior turbinal bone, and an anterior to ramify in the membrane over the middle turbinal bone and the smooth surface of the ethmoid in front of this. In addition to the special nerves of smell, the cavity is supplied with nerves of' common sensation derived from the fifth pair. The nasal branch of the ophthalmic supplies the front and upper part of the septum and also the outer wall of the nasal fossa.934 OBGANS OF SPECIAL SENSE The Vidian, with the upper anterior branches of Meckel's ganglion, supply the upper and back portion of the septum, including the superior spongy bone. The naso-palatine supplies the middle portion of the septum. The anterior dental branch of the maxillary division of the fifth nerve is distributed to the inferior meatus and inferior turbinal bone. The anterior or large palatine nerve supplies in its course downwards the I middle and lower turbinal bones. | The arteries are distributed as follows :— f The spheno-palatine, from the internal maxillary by its internal or naso-palatine i branch, supplies the septum as it courses to the incisor foramen. Its external i branches supply the antrum (also supplied by the alveolar branch of the facial) j and frontal sinus, the ethmoidal cells, and inner surfaces of the turbinal bones i with the meatuses. It enters the cavity through the spheno-palatine foramen. ' The anterior and posterior ethmoidal arteries derived from the ophthalmic | supply the upper portion of the septum, the roof, the outer wall (anteriorly) and posterior ethmoidal cells. The descending palatine of the internal maxillary sends a few filaments to the ' back of the inferior meatus and lower turbinal bone. The branch to the septum derived from the superior coronary of the facial ramifies in the membrane covering its lower and front portion. The veins form a plexus especially marked at the lower and hinder portions of the fossa. They follow the course of the arteries. The spheno-palatine passes into the pterygoid plexus. The ethmoidal terminate in the ophthalmic vein, and i the alveolar joins the facial. [ Communications are formed with the veins within the cranial cavity, through \ the cribriform foramina and foramen caecum, and also with the facial vein through small foramina in the nasal bone and nasal process of the maxilla. The lymphatics form a well-developed plexus, which communicates, through the lymphatics surrounding the olfactory nerves, with the subdural space within the cranial cavity.SECTION VII THE THOEAX INCLUDING THE ORGANS OF VOICE, EESPIEATION, AND CIECULATION Bt aethde hensman, f.e.c.s. LECTURER OX ANATOMY AT THE MIDDLESEX HOSPITAL MEDICAL COLLEGE ; AXD SURGEOX TO THE THROAT AXD EAR DEl'ARTMENT OF THE JIIDDLESEX HOSPITAL. THE THORAX THE thorax, or trunk of the body—lying between the neck and the abdomen—is formed partly of bones and partly of soft connecting tissues. In the living body it is constantly varying in relation to the respiratory process. The cavity is bounded, in front by the sternum and upper six costal cartilages and internal intercostal muscles; behind by the thoracic vertebra and posterior ends of the ribs ; and laterally by the ribs with the internal and external intercostal muscles. Its form is conical, flattened in the adult from before backAvards, so that its transverse is its greater diameter. In the human foetus, as in the lower animals, it is flattened laterally, its antero-posterior diameter being the greater. It is narrow above, where the ribs are short, and broad below. Owing to the backward set of the hinder extremities of the ribs, the bodies of the vertebrae project forwards into the cavity, which thus, on a transverse section, appears more or less cordiform. The superior aperture is bounded, in front by the upper margin of the sternum ; behind by the body of the first thoracic vertebra; on each side by the first rib. It measures in a well-formed adult about two and a quarter inches from before backwards, and four and a quarter inches from side to side. The ribs slope down- wards towards the sternum, the upper margin of which corresponds to the inter- vertebral substance between the second and third thoracic vertebrae. It transmits the following structures :—(1) The sterno-hyoid and sterno-thyroid muscles, and more deeply a thin layer of the deep cervical fascia which blends below with the sheath of the great vessels and the pericardium ; (2) the thymus gland in the infant, or its shrunken remains in the adult; (3) an occasional middle thyroid artery, the trachea, the oesophagus, the thoracic duct, the longus colli muscles, and a thin layer of fascia overlying them. Laterally : the innominate artery (on the right side), the common carotid and subclavian (on the left), with the internal mammary and superior intercostal arteries; the innominate and inferior thyroid veins ; the phrenic, pneumogastric, and sympathetic nerves, with the left recurrent laryngeal, some cardiac branches, and the anterior branches of the first thoracic nerve. On each side, in addition, there is a small portion of the apex of the lung with its pleural covering.THE THOBAX 936 The lower opening, or base, is limited in front by the ensiform cartilage, behind by the twelfth thoracic vertebra, and laterally by the twelfth ribs. The diaphragm arches upwards to form a vaulted floor to the intervening space. It is about one inch higher on the right side than on the left, and its flattened central portion is lower than either of the lateral arches. The thoracic cavity is much deeper behind than in front. The following structures pass through the loiuer opening of the thorax :—(1) The aorta, vena azygos major, thoracic duct, and, occasionally, the left sympathetic nerve pass through the aortic opening. (2) The oesophagus, pneumogastric nerves, and some small oesophageal arterial branches emerge through the oesophageal opening. Fig. 521.—Anterior View of the Thorax, with Outlines of the Diaphragm and Lungs. (3) The vena cava inferior ascends through the caval opening, and the branches of the phrenic nerves pierce the diaphragm to reach its lower surface. (4) The splanchnic nerves, the vena azygos minor, and the sympathetic trunk of each side pass through the crura. The viscera contained within the thoracic cavity are : the heart, which is enclosed in the pericardium ; and the lungs, with their pleural investments. The heart lies between the lungs in the so-called mediastinal space. This is bounded on each side by the reflexions of the pleura?, which pass from the front to the back of the thoracic cavity; and the common space is further subdivided into a superior mediastinum above the heart sac, an anterior and a posterior respec-SUPEBIOB MEDIASTINUM 937 tively in front of and behind it, and a middle mediastinum which contains the heart itself. The superior mediastinum has the following boundaries : -the manubrium with the origins of the sterno-hyoid and sterno-thyroid muscles in front; the bodies of the four highest thoracic vertebra behind, with the lower portions of the longus colli muscles ; and on each side the pleural sacs. Above, the boundary corresponds with the superior aperture of the thorax, and below with a nearly horizontal plane passing backwards from the articulation between the manubrium and gladiolus of the sternum, to the lower part of the body of the fourth thoracic vertebra.

The anterior mediastinum is narrow above, lying behind the sternum opposite the second, third, and fourth cartilages. Below, it opens out into a quadrangular space, having nearly the whole of the lower half of the sternum, the lower edge of the fourth, the fifth, part of the sixth, and the termination of the seventh cartilages of the left side, with the triangularis sterni muscle in front (fig. 521.) The pericardium forms its posterior wall. The space merely contains some small lymphatic glands and areolar tissue, and a few irregular bands, the inferior sterno-pericardiac ligaments, with the thymus gland or its vestiges. It corresponds to the area of cardiac dullness. The posterior mediastinum is bounded in front by the roots of the lungs and posterior surface of the pericardium in front, and behind by the thoracic vertebral column below the fourth thoracic vertebra. On each side it is bounded by the pleural sacs. It contains the third part of the aortic arch and the descending aorta, oesophagus, and pneumogastric nerves, azygos veins, thoracic duct, and lymphatic glands. THE ORGANS OP VOICE THE LARYNX The larynx is the organ of the voice, and the protector of the air passages from the intrusion of foreign bodies. By its closure, moreover, it retains the air within the chest cavity, contributing to the fixity of the thorax, a condition which is essential to the due performance of a variety of muscular actions. It consists of a framework of cartilages held together by ligaments and acted upon by muscles (extrinsic and intrinsic). It is lined by a very sensitive mucous membrane, and supplied with blood-vessels, nerves, and lymphatics. The cartilages of the larynx are nine in number. Some of these are single, some are arranged in pairs, Single cartilages:— Paired cartilages :— Thyroid. Arytenoid. Cricoid. Cornicula laryngis (Santorini). Epiglottis. Cuneiform (Wrisberg). From their general structure they may be arranged as follows :— Hyaline :— Yellow elastic :— Thyroid. Epiglottis. Cricoid. Cornicula laryngis. Arytenoid (the tip of the arytenoid Cuneiform, is yellow elastic.) In the anteater there extends backwards from each side of the epiglottis to the summit of the arytenoids a continuous rim of yellow elastic cartilage. It is the broken remnants of this which in man form the cornicula and the cuneiform cartilages. (Bland Sutton).THE LABYNX 989 The THYROID CARTILAGE forms the front and sides of the upper part of the larynx, being placed above the cricoid. It consists of two nearly square symmetrical plates, or alee, united in front, where they form the pomum Adami, but widely separated behind. They include between them an angle varying from 80° to 90°, and are somewhat obliquely inclined, their outer surfaces looking slightly downwards as well as outwards. Each plate has an outer and an inner surface and four borders. The upper and lower angles of each plate project upwards and downwards to form posteriorly its superior and inferior cornu. The outer surface is smooth, and is crossed by an oblique and often very faintly defined line, or by an occasional fibrous band. This is marked at each extremity by a small tubercle. These tubercles are more pronounced in old subjects. The Fig. 523.—Front View of the Cartilages of the Larynx. (Modified from Bonrgery and Jacob.) line and the adjacent cartilage give attachments to the thyro-hyoid and sterno- thyroid muscles, and the smaller portion (one fourth) of the ala which lies behind it is overlapped by the inferior constrictor, this muscle arising from its anterior part. The inner surface is also smooth ; it is concave, and in contact with the mucous membrane which lines the sinus pyriformis. The anterior or isthmic border, which is also the shortest, corresponds to the junction of the two alfe in the median line in front; very prominent above, where it forms the pomum Adami, it becomes depressed before again projecting less markedly [below. Posteriorly, at the angle of junction it gives attachment to the stalk of the epiglottis, the true and false vocal cords, the thyro-arytenoid and thyro-epiglottidei muscles. The superior border, which gives attachment to the thyro-hyoid membrane, is940 THE OBGANS OF VOICE sinuous. Slightly depressed posteriorly, it rises in front, and then becomes abruptly scooped out and everted to form the side of the great median notch. The inferior border is somewhat sinuous. It gives attachment in front to the middle portion of the crico-thyroid membrane, and behind to the crico-thyroid muscle, and presents the small tubercle already noticed at the termination of the oblique line. The posterior border, thick and rounded, projects above and below into the superior and inferior cornua, and gives partial insertion to the stylo- and palato- pharyngei muscles. The superior coinua project imvards as well as upwards and backwards. To their tips are attached the thyro-hyoid ligaments, and near each root appears the tubercle at the upper end of the oblique line. Fig. 524.— Side View of the Cartilages of the Larynx. (Modified from Bourgery and Jacob.) The inferior cornna are short, blunt processes. They project inwards as well i as downwards and forwards. By means of a small oval concave facet (directed downwards as well as inwards) placed on their inner faces, the inferior cornua : articulate with the facets on the sides of the cricoid cartilage. They give partial attachment to the inferior constrictors of the pharynx and crico-thyroid muscles in j addition to the ligaments of the joint. - The CEICOID CARTILAGE is thick and strong, and forms a complete ring around the lower part of the larynx. Behind, it presents a quadrate surface, but narrows rapidly ; in its anterior half to only one-fourth or one-fifth of its posterior depth. Hence its : comparison to a signet ring. It thus possesses an anterior and a posterior portion, and a superior and inferior border, and presents four articular surfaces. The posterior quadrate portion is divided by a median vertical ridge whichTHE LABYNX 941 separates two broad and shallow depressions. To this ridge some of the longitudinal fibres of the cssophagus are attached, and the depressions give origin to the I posterior crico-arytenoid muscles. The anterior portion is narrow and rounded, and gives attachment in front to the crico-thyroid muscles, and more posteriorly to some fibres of the inferior constrictor of the pharynx. Between these two halves of the ring, but nearer the lower border, is placed the oval surface (looking upwards and outwards) for articulation with the inferior cornu of the thyroid cartilage. The inner surface is smooth and lined by mucous membrane. The superior border bounds the quadrate plate above, and then passes obliquely I downwards and forwards. An oval, convex, obliquely placed articular surface, upon i which moves the arytenoid cartilage, separates these two portions of the upper ! border. i The oblique half gives attachment to the crico-thyroid membrane, and, laterally I and external to this, to the lateral crico-arytenoid muscle. i The inferior border—horizontal, and often deeply notched at the sides—-is attached to the first ring of the trachea by fibrous membrane. The arytenoid cartilages are irregular, three-sided pyramids, which articulate by their bases with the oblique facets on the superior border of the cricoid cartilage, and support upon their apices the cornicula laryngis. The space between them in certain animals has been likened to the mouth of a pitcher, and hence their name. Each cartilage presents three surfaces, divided by three borders, with a base, apex, and angies. The surfaces.—The posterior is concave, smooth, and gives attachment to the \ arytenoid muscle. The anterior is irregular and convex. It gives attachment by a small tubercle to the false vocal cord, and also to the thyro-arytenoid muscle. The internal is almost flat, smooth, and narrow, and covered by mucous membrane. The base is obliquely hollowed, and presents internally the facet for articulation with the cricoid cartilage. The angles.—The anterior is prolonged for the attachment of the true vocal cord. It is known as the vocal process, and with the aid of the laryngoscope is easily seen during life. The external or muscular is thick and blunt, and gives attachment in front to the lateral crico-arytenoid, and behind to the posterior crico-arytenoid muscle. The internal is unimportant; it is tied to the corresponding cartilage and to the cricoid by a fibrous band which is known as the transverse or crico- arytenoid ligament. I The borders.—The two internal, which limit the narrow inner face, are nearly parallel and almost vertical; whilst the external slopes upwards, inwards, and backwards. The apex projects inwards and backwards, and supports the corniculum. The I cartilage here becomes fibrous in structure. ! The EPIGLOTTIS is a median leaf-like plate of yellow elastic cartilage attached by : a stalk inferiorly to the retiring angle of the thyroid cartilage below the median notch. When denuded of its mucous covering, it is seen to be pitted with numerous depressions for the lodgment of glands (fig. 530). Placed with its lingual surface above, and its stalk in front, it has been compared to an elongated saddle. It varies very considerably both in shape and inclination, its leaf-like portion being sometimes considerably curled upon itself. It is placed nearly vertically in the adult, but in children is frequently so much \ depressed that its posterior free surface is inclined below its anterior. Hence itsTHE ORGANS OF VOICE 942 variable appearance when examined in the hving subject with the laryngoscope. It is somewhat depressed and folded upon itself during deglutition. Its anterior or lingual aspect is free above and covered with mucous membrane, which lower down is reflected forward upon the base of the tongue in three folds— one median (which encloses elastic tissue) and two lateral—the glosso-epiglottidean folds. Beneath the mucous membrane the deeper attached portion of this surface is tied to the hyoid bone by a median elastic membrane, named hyo-epiglottidean ligament. A quantity of elastic and fatty tissue, closely blended with this ligament Fig. 525.—Front View of the Cricoid and Arytenoid Cartilages. (Modified from Boiirgery and Jacob.)

The posterior or laryngeal surface, concavo-convex from above downwards, and concave from side to side, is free and covered with mucous membrane for its whole extent.

The CORNICULA LAEYNGIS, or cartilages of Santorini, are the two little cone- shaped yellow elastic cartilages which project backwards and inwards from the summits of the arytenoids, with which they are sometimes directly continuous. A joint, however, is usually present. <|THE LABYNX 943 The CUNEIFORM CARTILAGES, or cartilages of Wrisberg, are placed within ;he aryteno-epigiottidean folds. These small conical and elongated yellow elastic jartilages produce the thickenings just mentioned in front of the cornicula. Calcification.—^The hyaline cartilages of the larynx are especially prone to calcify ifter middle life, but the yellow elastic cartilages take no share in the process. The little cartilago triticea, however, is frequently converted into bone. I In the thyroid cartilage the deposit of bony salts usually commences near the posterior border and in the cornua, extending forwards into the lower part of the ilia, and finally upwards, until in advanced cases the whole cartilage is involved. In the cricoid cartilage the calcification commences above on each side in the leighbourhood of the crico-arytenoid joints, and extends downwards, and finally )oth forwards and backwards. In the arytenoid the calcification commences in the base, but it finally involves he whole cartilage with the exception of the summit, where the hyaline structure (as dready noted) disappears. The ligaments (extrinsic).—The thyro-hyoid membrane is composed mainly if elastic fibres.

Posteriorly, the membrane is loosely connected with tie superior cornua of the thyroid cartilage, and above these it is bounded on each ide by thickened bands, the thyro-hyoid ligaments, which pass between their tips nd the greater cornua of the hyoid bone. A little grain-like cartilage (cartilago triticea) is usually imbedded in this band ust above the thyroid cornu. I The central portion of the membrane is mainly subcutaneous, a bursa inter- ening where it is overhung by the body of the hyoid bone. Its lateral portions are covered by the thyro-hyoid muscles. Posteriorly it is sparated from the epiglottis by the mucous membrane at the base of the tongue -nd the areolar fatty tissue already described. The crico-thyroid membrane (intrinsic) is composed chiefly of elastic tissue, t presents a prominent rounded median portion overlapped slightly by the crico- hyroid muscles, but between these muscles it is subcutaneous. It is crossed by a mall anastomotic arch formed by the crico-thyroid twigs of the superior laryngeal rtery; one or two small holes transmit vessels from the arch to the interior of the irynx.944 THE ORGANS OF VOICE This median portion of the membrane stretches between the borders of the two| cartilages. The lateral and thinner portions pass upwards from the inner border j of the upper margin of the cricoid cartilage in contact with the laryngeal mucous' membrane, and within the embrace of the thyroid cartilage, to form the true vocalt cords or inferior thyro-arytenoid ligaments. These elastic bands extend from the: vocal processes of the arytenoid cartilages to the retiring angle of the thyroid nearj its centre. The lateral portions of this membrane are covered superficially by the thyro-i arytenoid and lateral crico-arytenoid muscles. i The superior thyro-arytenoid ligaments are contained within the arched folds' of mucous membrane which form the false vocal cords. They consist of a few! bundles of fibrous tissue. i ! i Fig. 528.—Side View of the Muscles and Ligaments of the Larynx. | The crico-arytenoid or transverse ligament has been already sufficient! noticed. The Joints of the Larynx.—The crico-thyroid joints are lined by a syno"' membrane, embraced by a thin capsule of radiating fibres, and often strengthen posteriorly by a well-marked fibrous band. They permit of movement between th two cartilages upon an axis passing transversely through both joints, and a limitc gliding of the cricoid upwards and backwards. As can be shown on the livin body, the cricoid is the cartilage which swings between the inferior thyroid corn"" The crico-arytenoid joints possess a synovial membrane enveloped in a thin an moderately loose capsule, strengthened posteriorly by a band passing between tb. cricoid and the inner and back part of the arytenoid—the posterior crico-arytenoif ligament; and internally by the interarytenoid band, which is occasionally ligaj mentous—the crico-arytenoid ligament.THE LABYNX 945 I The cricoid articular surface is oval, convex, and oblique, with its long axis passing from behind, forwards, and outwards. The opposed articular surface on the base of the arytenoid is also oval, but it is concave with its long axis passing from before backwards. It follows that the two surfaces never completely cover each other at any one time. The arytenoid rotates on a vertical axis near to and parallel with its inner jsurface, and it also glides forwards and inwards, or in an opposite direction. These movements are associated—the gliding forwards and inwards with the inward rotation, and the gliding outwards and backwards with the outward rotation. The Muscles.—The muscles are divisible into an extrinsic group, passing between ^the larynx and parts beyond ; and an intrinsic group, belonging entirely to the organ itself. j The extrinsic muscles are the sterno-thyroid, thyro-hyoid, stylo- and palato- ipharyngei, and the inferior constrictors of the pharynx. It should be noted that the muscles which fix the hyoid bone, and also those which close the lower jaw, assist the action of the above mentioned. The intrinsic muscles.—The crieo-thyroid is attached below to the front and side of the cricoid cartilage, and above to the lower border of the thyroid cartilage. The lower fibres, which are horizontal and often distinct, pass to the front border of its inferior cornu, and act by pulling the cricoid directly backwards, whilst the Fig. 529.—Scheme of Eima, showing Action of Crico-arytenoideus Posticus, which DRAWS THE ARYTENOID CARTILAGE FROM I TO II. (Modified from Stirling.) spreading fibres which form the rest of the muscle swing the cricoid between the prico-thyroid joints, pulling it upwards as well as backwards. Both portions of the muscle make tense the vocal cords, and are supplied by the external laryngeal lerve. It is overlapped laterally by the sterno-thyroid, having beneath it a small portion of the crico-thyroid membrane and some of the lower fibres of the ateral crico-arytenoid muscle. The central portion of the crico-thyroid membrane ippears in the angular interval between the two muscles. The crico-arytenoideus posticus arises from the quadrate surface situated on )ach side of the posterior median ridge of the cricoid cartilage. Its fibres rapidly jonverge to be inserted into the posterior portion of the outer angle (muscular process) of the arytenoid cartilage. The upper fibres are chiefly concerned in rotation of the arytenoid cartilage, Rrhilst the lower produce its gliding movement. It is a dilator of the rima glottidis. Some of the lowest fibres occasionally pass to the inferior cornu of the thyroid jartilage, and are known as the kerato-cricoideus or kerato-thyroideus. It is covered posteriorly by mucous membrane, and is supplied by the recurrent laryngeal nerve. A few of the longitudinal fibres of the oesophagus arise from the ridge which separates the two muscles. The crico-arytenoideus lateralis arises from the upper border of the cricoid 3P946 THE ORGANS OF VOICE cartilage between the origin of the crico-thyroid and the crico-arytenoid articulation. It narrows to be inserted into the fore part of the muscular process of the arytenoid cartilage. It draws the cartilage forwards, relaxing and slightly approximating the cords. It is overlapped by the thyroid cartilage, and anteriorly by the crico-thyroid muscle ; internally it is covered by mucous membrane.

It is supplied , by the recurrent laryngeal nerve. The thyro-arytenoid muscle, which is placed above the foregoing, arises broadly from the lower two-thirds of the inner surface of the thyroid cartilage close to its retiring angle, and slightly from the posterior surface of the crico-thyroid membrane. Narrowing as it passes outwards and backwards, it is inserted into the anterior Fig. 531.—Scheme showing Action of Thyro-arytenoid drawing the Vocal Cords AND Vocal Processes from II to I. (Modified from Stirling.) surface of the arytenoid cartilage, and also into its base close to the attachment of the lateral crico-arytenoid muscle. Some few of its fibres pass onwards and become continuous with the oblique fibres of the arytenoid muscle. The lower portion of the muscle lies parallel to and blends with the outer surface of the vocal cord. The upper and thinner portion is placed immediately beneath the mucous membrane, and overlies the ventricle and laryngeal pouch.947 THE LABYNX These muscles by rotating the arytenoid cartilages draw the vocal processes 'downwards and inwards, and thus approximate the vocal cords. By pulling fforward the cartilages, they relax the cord as a whole. According to some authorities, the fibres attached to the outer border of the vocal cord act upon it by modifying its elasticity, tightening a portion in front and relaxing the remainder, in this somewhat resembling the stop action of the finger on a violin string. The arytenoideus consists of transverse fibres passing from one arytenoid ieartilage to the other, and attached to their posterior concave surfaces. Super- ificially are some oblique fibres, which decussate where they meet. These pass from Ifche outer angle of one cartilage below to the summit of the opposite, A few of these fibres pass onwards to the aryteno-epiglottidean fold and side of epiglottis. These, reinforced by fibres attached to the summit of the arytenoid cartilage, constitute the aryteno-epiglottideus muscle. A few fibres blend with the thyro- arytenoid muscle. The arytenoideus approximates and depresses the arytenoid cartilages. These actions are assisted by the aryteno-epigiottidei, which depress the epiglottis and icontract the superior aperture of the larynx. The thyro-epiglottideus (sometimes described as part of the thyro-arytenoid) consists of fibres attached below to the thyroid cartilage which, spreading above, Fig. 532.—Scheme showing Action of Arytenoideus drawing Arytenoid Cartilage from Neutral Position I to II. (Modified from Stirling.) reach the aryteno-epiglottidean fold, and the outer wall of the laryngeal pouch as jtvell as the epiglottis. (For the nerve-supply of the laryngeal muscles see page 950.) ! The Interior of the Larynx.—The superior aperture, or opening of the glottis, s triangular in shape, wide in front, narrow behind, and placed so obliquely as to )e almost vertical in the living subject. Above and in front it is bounded by the ipiglottis, behind and below by the interarytenoid notch, whilst on each side stretches the aryteno-epiglottidean fold containing muscular and ligamentous libres. This fold presents two thickened areas, one at the summit of the arytenoid iartilage, and one just in front and above this, formed by the bulging of the hornicular and cuneiform cartilages respectively. Bounded inteipially by this fold, and externally by the wing of the thyroid iartilage, is a shallow depression—the sinus pyriformis. The cavity of the larynx extends from the aperture above described to the lower jborder of the cricoid cartilage. I Its lining of mucous membrane varies much in its colour and thickness and its ixity to the structures which it overlies. On the surface of the true vocal cords it is ixtremely thin, pale and adherent, whilst above and below this it is more vascular bnd more loosely attached to the underlying parts. The submucous tissue contains mmerous elastic fibres and mucous glands. 3 p 2THE OBGANS OF VOICE 948 The canity is naturally divided into two portions—supra- and infra-rimal—; divided by the glottis or interval between the two true vocal cords. The suprarimal portion corresponds to the space between the wings of the th}Toid cartilage. It is broad and triangular above, but narrower below, and its walls are much deeper in front than behind. Immediately above each vocal cordj is an oblong depression—the ventricle—boimded above by the crescent-shaped; Fig. 533.—View of Interior of Larynx as seen during Inspiration. ^ BASE OF TONGUE Vallecula CusMon of epiglottis Tme vocal cord Bima glottidis Sinus pyriformis Arytenoid commissure edge of the false vocal cord, below by the straight margin of the true vocal cord, and externally by the thyro-arytenoid muscle.

The rima glottidis is the chink bounded on each side by the vocal cords and the inner stirfaces of the arytenoid cartilages with their vocal x^rocesses. It is limited behind by the interarytenoid fold, and presents the appearance of m elongated triangle, measuring, in the adult male, nearly an inch in length, and hree or four lines across at its widest part. When observed during life, the rima glottidis is seen to vary very considerably. 3n inspiration the vocal cords, whilst almost touching in front, are separated behind from a quarter to half an inch (^G to 12 mm,), forming an angle directed950 THE OBGANS OF VOICE outwards, where they terminate in the vocal processes, the glottis presenting a lozenge-shaped' appearance. | On phonation the cords become parallel and closely approximated, and the I vocal processes approaching each other cause the angle to be turned inwards. ; The infrarimal portion of the larynx rapidly widens out into a nearly circular! cavity at the lower border of the cricoid cartilage, from which point it is continuous \ with the lumen of the trachea. I Nerves.—The nerves of the larynx are derived from the superior and inferior! (recurrent) laryngeal branches of the vagus. i The superior laryngeal.—The sensory nerve of the larynx gives off near its' origin behind the carotid sheath a long and slender filament, which is principally! motor. This (external) branch is distributed to the crico-thyroid muscle, a fe-R minute filaments reaching the mucous membrane of the larynx. Its larger and main branch (internal) is sensory, and passes through th aperture in the thyro-hyoid membrane above the superior laryngeal artery. I divides beneath the mucous membrane which lines the sinus pyriformis, distributin branches upw^ards to supply both surfaces of the epiglottis and the base of th tongue immediately in front; inwards to the aryteno-epiglottidean fold and it^ neighbourhood; whilst others pass downwards to the mucous membrane of th deeper portions of the larynx as far as the true vocal cords. The inferior (recurrent) laryngeal, the motor nerve of the larynx, ascends ir the groove between the trachea and oesophagus, both of which structures it supplies It reaches the larynx below the edge of the inferior constrictor, and immediatel behind the crico-thyroid joint. At this spot it divides into two branches: a' anterior to supply the thyro-arytenoideus, crico-arytenoideus lateralis, with th muscles of the epiglottis ; and a posterior branch to the crico-arytenoideus posticu and arytenoideus. The superior laryngeal communicates with this branch by a slender filament which passes downwards near to the posterior border of the thyroid cartilage This communication sometimes takes place beneath the posterior crico-arytenoi muscle. The arteries are derived from the superior and inferior thyroid, the epiglotti receiving some twigs from the dorsalis linguae of the lingual. The veins correspond with the arteries ; and the lymphatics, which are scanty follow the vessels and end in the deep cervical glands. THE TRACHEA The trachea, or air-tube, which is cylindrical in shape, but flattened posteriorly, extends from the lower border of the fifth cervical vertebra to the fourth or fift tlioracic vertebra. It is continuous with the larynx above, and divides into the twci bronchi below. It measures from four and a half to five inches in length, and isi nearly an inch in width. i Relations.—In its cervical portion it rests upon the oesophagus, which curves ! somewhat to the left at the root of the neck; on each side, but especially on the; left, it comes into relationship with the lateral lobes of the thyroid gland, the inferior thyroid arteries, and the recurrent laryngeal nerves. These latter running. upwards gain the lateral groove between the trachea and oesophagus; and lastly, it is in relation with the sheath containing the common carotid artery, internal jugular vein, and pneumogastric nerve. ;951 THE TEA CHE A In front it is crossed by the thyroid isthmus, and in addition to the skin and superficial fascia are the following structures :—The anterior ju^gular veins, and commonly at the root of the neck a communicating branch passing transversely between them, the inferior thyroid veins, and when present the thyroidea ima, and the thymus gland or its remains. It is overlapped on each side by the sterno-hyoid and sterno-thyroid muscles, with a narrow interval between them, across which \ passes a strong deeper layer of the cervical fascia and a thinner superficial layer. In its thoracic portion the trachea still rests upon and retains its connection with 1 the oesophagus, which separates it from the spine. It lies between the two pleural sacs and pneumogastric nerves, having in front of it the sternum with the origins of the sterno-hyoid and thyroid muscles, the thymus gland, the deep cardiac plexus, and also the transverse portion of the arch of the aorta, which vessel crosses the tube just above its bifurcation ; the innominate artery passes upwards to its right. Fig. 536.—Anterior View of the Larynx, with the Trachea and Bronchi. (Modified from Bourgery.) and the left carotid ascends to reach its left side with the left recurrent laryngeal nerve. The left innominate vein crosses the roots of these vessels. Structure.—The trachea is made up of a series of imperfect cartilaginous rings, deficient behind, connected throughout by fibro-elastic membrane, with muscular fibres, the trachealis muscle, a special layer of yellow elastic fibres, and a lining of mucous membrane. The cartilaginous rings vary in number from sixteen to twenty. They are incomplete, being deficient in the hinder third, and are connected in a continuous series by a fibrous membrane, which divides to enclose them, but reunites in the narrow intervals between. It forms a definite layer where the cartilages are wanting, so that it may be regarded as complete throughout the tube. The inside of the trachea is ridged transversely by the rings, which are rounded on their inner952 THE OBGANS OF VOICE surfaces ; but it is comparatively smooth externally, where the outer surfaces of the rings are flattened. The first cartilage is broad, and is occasionally united with the cricoid above, or second ring of the trachea below. The last cartilage is likewise broad and strong, and sends a curved beak down- wards and backwards at the point of bifurcation of the trachea. It forms an imperfect ring on each side above the commencement of the corresponding bronchus. Two cartilages not uncommonly unite in part, and thus present a bifurcated appearance. The fibres of the trachealis are unstriped, and form a transverse layer at the posterior flattened part of the tube, with an indistinct layer of longitudinal fibres superimposed. The yellow elastic fibres, which exist throughout the entire mucous membrane, form a definite and deep layer at the posterior flattened portion of the tube. They are gathered into strong longitudinal flattened bands, especially well seen at thei lower part of the trachea, and where the fibres separate to pass into the bronchi. The mucous membrane is smooth and pinkish in colour; it is provided with numerous glands, especially at its hinder part, and is lined by a columnar ciliated' epithelium. The arteries are derived from the inferior thyroid. The veins join the thyroid plexuses ; and the nerves are supplied by branches from the pneumogastric, the recurrent laryngeal, and sympathetic. THE BEONCHI The right bronchus (fig. 536) is about one inch in length. It is shorter and wider than the left, and in direction more horizontal in its passage to the root of the lung. Relations.—The vena azygos major arches above it from behind to end in the superior vena cava, which latter is placed anteriorly. The right pulmonary artery is at first below, and then in front of it. The left bronchus is about two inches in length ; it is more oblique, longer, and narrower than the right. Relations.—It lies beneath the arch of the aorta, and rests upon the oesophagus, thoracic duct, and finally the descending aorta. The left pulmonary artery lies above and then in front of it. On looking down the trachea the dividing ridge between the two bronchial orifices is seen to be on the left of the middle line, more of the right orifice for this reason being visible. This explains the fact that foreign bodies entering the trachea most commonly become lodged in the right bronchus. At the root of the lung the right bronchus distributes a branch to the upper lobe of the lung which reaches above the level of the pulmonary artery. The remaining stem passes behind the pulmonary artery, and divides into two branches for the middle and lower lobes respectively. These, after several subdivisions, becomes bronchioles. The left bronchus lies below the pulmonary artery, and divides into two branches—one for each of its lobes—these corresponding with those which supply the middle and lower lobes of the right lung. THE THYEOID BODY OR GLAND The thyroid body is of a reddish colour, and is classed amongst the -ductless glands. It consists of two lateral lobes, and a connecting isthmus which unites them below.THYROID GLAND 953 The lateral lobes pass upwards on each side nearly as high as the oblique line which crosses the ala of the thyroid cartilage, and extend below as far as the fifth Dr sixth ring of the trachea. The isthmus, which varies in breadth a good deal in different subjects (from a quarter to three-quarters of an inch), usually covers the gecond and third rings, but sometimes descends over the fourth ring of the trachea. The gland is convex and rounded on its outer surface, but deeply it is moulded jO the parts which it overlies. It commonly weighs from one to two ounces, but is r in the female, and is often increased in size during menstruation. The lateral lobes are pyriform in shape, with their broad ends below, and Fig. 537.—View of Thyroid Body.

Its '•osterior rounded border reaches backwards as far as the pharynx, and comes intoTHE OBGANS OF VOICE 954 relationship, more especially on the left side, with the oesophagus and recurrent laryngeal nerve, with branches of the inferior thyroid artery, and with the sheath containing the great vessels of the neck. The middle or pyramidal process is developed in connection with the tliyro- glossal duct, and, like the isthmus, which has a similar origin, it is the most I variable portion of the gland. When present it is connected inferiorly with the isthmus or neighbouring part of the left lateral lobe. It extends upwards to be connected by means of fibrous tissue with the thyro-hyoid membrane or the body of the hyoid bone. It varies very much in appearance, but its apex is usually above. In some cases it is divided, and occasionally it is represented throughout by fibrous tissue. The thyro-glossal duct may, even in the adult, remain more or less pervious in its lower portion. Above, it is represented by the foramen cfecum on the dorsum of the tongue. Fig. 538.—Thyroid Body, with Middle Lobe and Levator Muscle.

The suspensory ligaments of the thyroid gland, two broadish bands, pass from the inner and back part of the lateral lobes upwards to the sides of the cricoid cartilage. Below, they are intimately blended with the investing capsule, and thus form on each side a sling which suspends the organ. These ligaments have no sharply defined edges, being continued into the layers of fasciae covering the front of the cricoid cartilage and posterior surface of the trachea. The recurrent laryngeal nerve lies in immediate contact with the outer surface of the ligament at its upper attachment. (Berry.) Structure.—The thyroid body, enveloped in a dense but thin covering of 1955 THYBOID GLAND areolar tissue, is made up of a number of closed follicles. These are surrounded by an open vascular meshwork supported by the interstitial connective tissue. The follicles are grouped into irregular lobules, and these form in turn the lobes of the gland. Both the interior of the follicles and the spaces in the connecting areolar tissue may become filled with colloid material. Vessels.—The arteries—which are relatively very large and frequently ana- stomose—are the two superior thyroids, the two inferior thyroids, and an occasional branch which ascends on the front of the trachea, the thyroidea ima. This latter is derived either from the innominate artery or from the arch of the aorta. The superior thyroid arteries descend to supply the apices and inner and fore parts of the lateral lobes ; whilst the inferior ascend to supply their outer and binder portions below. The veins are the superior middle and the inferior thyroid. The two former Fig. 539.—The Suspensory Ligaments of the Thyroid Body. (After Berry.)

It reaches its highest de- velopment about the end of the second year. Although it occasionally retains a considerable size in the adult, it usually disappears or shrivels away to an insignificant vestige. It is commonly made up of two elongated, nearly equal pyramidal lobes of a greyish pink colour, which meet one another near the middle line; but they vary jin number and are inconstant in size. There may be but a single lobe present, I or a third may intervene between the other two. Sometimes the right lobe and sometimes the left lobe is the larger. The thymus body is about two inches in length, about one inch and a half in breadth at its base, and a quarter of an inch in thickness.THE ORGANS OF VOICE 956 Its weight at birth is about half an ounce. Relations.—The thyroid body at the period of its fullest development lies partly in the thorax and partly in the neck. It extends upwards as far as the thyroid body covered by the sterno-hyoid and thyroid muscles, completely hiding the trachea. Below, it descends into the superior mediastinum between the pleural sacs and internal mammary vessels as far as the fourth rib cartilages, and lies behind the sternum and in front of the pericardium and larger vessels.

If the capsule is removed, it is seen to send inwards numerous prolongations from its deep surface, which pass between the lobules to surround and connect them. The lobules are irregular and many-sided, and consist of numerous lymph follicles. They are grouped around a central tubular cord of connective tissue, and957 THYMUS GLAND when unravelled the lobe can be lengthened out, the lobules then appearing to be attached to the cord in a spiral fashion.

They are separated one from the I other by the heart and great vessels, and the other contents of the mediastinal i spaces. I THE PLEUE^ j I Each lung is closely invested by a delicate serous covering, which also dips into i and lines the fissures which separate their lobes—the visceral layer of the pleura, or pleura pulmonalis. The parietal layer, or pleura costalis, is reflected from the root of the lung I forwards, covering the side of the pericardium, to the chest-wall in front, and backwards to the sides of the vertebral column, whilst below it covers the vault of the diaphragm. The pleural cavity between the two layers just described does i not exist except as a result of disease or injury; air or fluid may then separate : them one from the other and fill the intervening space. Below the root of each lung a fold of the pleura descends to the diaphragm, the \ ligamentum latum pulmonis. The pleural sacs pass for an inch or more above the level of the first rib beneath the scalene muscles, covering the apices of the lungs, and the parietal layer is here strengthened by a dome of fascia which descends from beneath the muscles to the inner border of the first rib. The interval between the two sacs is considerable both above and below; but opposite the second piece of the sternum, corresponding with the second, third, and fourth rib cartilages (fig. 521), they are closely approximated or in actual contact. I The right pleural sac, though shorter and wider than the left, reaches as a rule : somewhat higher in the neck. The inner surface of the pleura, where the two i layers are in contact, is smooth and moist and glistening; the outer surface is closely adherent where it invests the lungs, the pulmonary vessels, and the diaphragm; but elsewhere it may be easily detached, and it is, moreover, much thicker, and presents a rough surface. ; The pleurae leave a narrow rim at the circumference of the diaphragm uncovered and in direct contact with the chest walls. The lungs are somewhat pyramidal in shape, with their bases below and their ; apices projecting upwards to the root of the neck. Each lung presents an outer and an inner surface, separated by an anterior and a posterior border, with a base and an apex. \ The outer surface is convex, and mainly corresponds to the concavity of the inner surface of the lateral wall of the thorax. , The inner surface is concave, and comes into contact with the pericardium and lateral pleural wall of the mediastinal spaces. The posterior border is the longer; it is thick, rounded, and smooth, and occupies the groove on the side of the vertebral column. The anterior border is thin, irregular, and sharply edged, and is deeply notched in the left lung, leaving the pericardium uncovered. The base is concave, and rests on the corresponding arch of the diaphragm; j959 THE PLEUB^ Fig. 542.—Anterior View of Fcetal Heart, Vessels, and Lungs.

(Modified from Bourgery.)960 THE ORGANS OF BESPIBATION whilst the apex passes above the first rib to He beneath the subclavian artery. The lungs are divided into two lobes by a deep fissure which passes obliquely upwards and inwards almost to the root of the organ. This fissure commences at the posterior border, about 7*5 cm. below the apex, and, sweeping round the convex surface of the lung, ends near the anterior border below. In the right lung a second fissure passes from the anterior edge to reach the main fissure near its centre, marking off a third or middle lobe. The right lung is somewhat larger than the left; it is also shorter, and, as just mentioned, possesses three lobes. Fig. 544.—Posterior View of the Thorax with Chest Wall removed, showing THE Lungs. (Modified from Bourgery.) Above the middle of the inner surface, but nearer to the posterior border, each lung is connected to the pulmonary vessels and bronchi by means of its root. The root of the lung is composed of the pulmonary artery and the pulmonary vein with the corresponding bronchial tube ; and, in addition, the bronchial vessels, the anterior and posterior pulmonary plexuses with some bronchial lymphatic glands and areolar tissue—the whole of which are encased in a pleural covering. The right root lies behind the superior cava and upper portion of the right auricle of the heart; above, the vena azygos major arches to join the superior cava. In front is the anterior pulmonary plexus, and more anteriorly the phrenic nerve. Behind is the posterior pulmonary plexus and the pneumogastric nerve, whilst below is the ligamentum latum pulmonis.961 THE LUNGS The left root has the pulmonary plexus and left phrenic in front; above it is the arch of the aorta; behind, the descending aorta and pneumogastric nerve with the posterior pulmonary plexus ; whilst below stretches downwards the ligamentum i latum pulmonis. The chief structures contained within the root vary on the two sides. I From above downwards on the right side, they lie as follows—bronchus, ' artery, and vein; whilst on the left side the artery is the highest, the bronchus is Fig. 545.—Anterior View of the Lungs : Pericardium. (Modified from Boiirgery.) ENSIFORM CARTI placed next, and the vein is again the lowest. From before backwards on both sides, the arrangement is—bronchus, artery, and vein. The weight of the lungs together is about forty-two ounces ; the right lung is about two ounces heavier than the left. In colour the lungs are of a pinkish white ; but they become darker, mottled, and even black, as age advances. Structure.—The lungs possess an external serous coat derived from the pleura, beneath which is a delicate subserous layer. B Q962 THE OBGANS OF CIBCULATION j The parenchyma, or lung substance, is composed of minute lobules connected | by interlobular areolar tissue. Each lobule is made up of a ramification of a bron- | chial tube with its cluster of terminal air cells, with a minute plexus of pulmonary i and bronchial vessels, nerves, and lymphatics. I The vessels.—The pulmonary arteries convey venous blood from the heart to the lungs ; they divide into branches which follow the bronchial tubes, and finally termi- i nate in a flat mesh work upon the walls of the intercellular passages and air cells. | The radicles of the pulmonary veins start from this network, and, coalescing I into larger branches which accompany the arteries, return the arterial blood to the | left auricle of the heart. I The bronchial arteries are the nutrient vessels of the lung. They commonly | arise by a single or by separate trunks from the thoracic aorta. Some branches ramify in an open plexus outside the lung beneath the pleura ; another set supply j the interlobular areolar tissue; whilst a third set of branches supply the bronchial i tubes with their lining membrane and muscular walls, the walls of the vessels, and i the bronchial glands. The ramifications of this set reach and mingle with the I pulmonary vessels, and thus a small quantity of the blood conveyed by the bronchial i arteries is returned as arterial through the pulmonary veins to the heart. i The bronchial veins consist of a superficial and a deep set, which join, to empty on the right side into the vena azygos major, and on the left into the superior i intercostal. j The lymphatics form a superficial and a deep set. j The nerves are derived from the anterior and posterior pulmonary plexuses. \ I THE ORGANS OF CIECULATION THE PEEICAKDIUM \ j The pericardium is a cone-shaped, fibro-serous sac surrounding the heart, with! its apex above, and its base below and adherent to the diaphragm. The fibrous layer is very strong and inelastic, and is composed of interlacing fibres. Below, j its connection with the central tendon of the diaphragm is close and intimate. It i is very firmly bound to the caval opening, but loosely attached and easily separable i elsewhere. Above, it is lost on the sheaths of the great vessels, all of which receive , distinct investments, with the single exception of the inferior vena cava, which | pierces it from below. The aorta, superior vena cava, both divisions of the pulmonary artery, with | the ductus arteriosus, together with the four pulmonary veins, are all ensheathed | in this manner. The fibrous portion of the pericardium through the sheaths, \ prolonged over the great vessels, ultimately becomes continuous above with the ; deep cervical fascia. Two slight bands of fibrous tissue—the sterno-pericardial \ bands or ligaments—connect the front of the pericardium, above and below, with the posterior surface of the sternum. 1 The serous layer is smooth and glistening. It lines the fibrous bag to form j its parietal portion, and is reflected over the surface of the heart at the roots of | the great vessels to form its visceral portion, the two layers being in close contact, | and moistened with a thin secretion to allow the free movement of the heart. A i series of pouches or sinuses are thus formed at the line of reflexion. Between the j inferior vena cava and lower left pulmonary vein, the oblique sinus ascends j behind the left auricle, partially investing the pulmonary arteries and the pulmonary j 1 li963 PEBICABDIUM—HEART 7eins of the right and left sides, between Y\^hich it passes. Small pouches from the iiiain sac dip between the veins to meet the inflexions from the sides of the oblique j^inus just noticed, thus completing the serous coverings to these vessels. I Pouches can be further traced between the inferior vena cava and lower pulmo- lary vein of the right side, between the superior vena cava and upper pulmonary jQiYi of the same side, and also between the left pulmonary artery and left upper bulmonary vein. j A tubular prolongation, moreover, surrounds both the root of the pulmonary Lrtery and the aorta in common, and these are the only vessels which can be said jlo have a complete and continuous investment. The inferior vena cava receives a very imperfect covering. The vestigial fold of the pericardium is a doubling of the serous layer which passes between the left pulmonary artery above and left pulmonary vein below. (;t contains, besides some fatty and areolar tissue, the shrunken remains of the left uperior vena cava. It is connected above with the left superior intercostal vein, Nnd below with the left auricle and oblique vein of Marshall,—these veins with the coronary sinus having originally formed portions of the left upper cava. Relations.—In front are found the thymus gland or its remains, areolar tissue, he sterno-pericardiac ligaments, the triangularis sterni muscle, the internal Qammary vessels, and sternum. Laterally, it is overlapped by the thin anterior aargins of the lungs with their pleural sacs, especially on the left side. Posteriorly \ is in relation with the bronchi, the oesophagus, and pneumogastric nerves, and the ascending aorta. On each side the pericardium is covered by the parietal layer f the pleura, the phrenic nerve and its companion artery intervening. On opening he pericardium the following structures may be observed: the greater part of he right and a portion of the left ventricle with the interventricular sulcus, the ight auricle and right auricular appendix (the latter overlapping the root of jhe aorta), the auriculo-ventricular sulcus ; the first portion of the aorta with tie superior vena cava on its right side, and the pulmonary artery at first overlying bd then passing to its left side, with the tip of the left auricular appendix. If the eart be raised upwards and to the right, its posterior surface is seen to consist of ,ie greater part of the left ventricle, and the remaining portion of the right, the entricular sulcus dividing the two. Lying transversely above the ventricle in jie auriculo-ventricular groove is the coronary sinus, receiving some of the cardiac eins, and also the oblique vein of Marshall from the back of the left auricle, the pots of the pulmonary veins, and the very small portion of the inferior cava above le diaphragm, may also be noticed. The tv*^o ventricles rest in about equal proportions on the central tendon of the iaphragm. The main branches of the coronary arteries of the heart occupy lie grooves. Vessels.—The arteries of the pericardium are derived from the pericardiac, jsophageal, and bronchial branches of the thoracic aorta, and from the internal lamniary and phrenic. THE HEART i j The heart—enclosed in the pericardium—occupies the greater part of the middle lediastinal space. It is a somewhat flattened, cone-shaped, hollow, muscular organ. Position.—In the adult the heart lies obliquely behind the lower two-thirds of jie sternum, projecting considerably to its left side. Its base is directed slightly owards and backwards, and to the right; its apex downwards and forwards, bd to the left. The base corresponds to the sixth, seventh, and eighth thoracic Irtebrae; and the apex to the chest wall on the left side, between the fifth and [xth rib cartilages. I 3 Q 2 ITHE ORGANS OF CIRCULATION 964 It may be mapped out on the chest wall in the following manner : a line drai across the sternmn about the level of the third costal cartilages, half an inch the right and one inch to the left, will indicate the position of its base, from whi the great vessels arise. The apex, as before observed, strikes the chest wall between the fifth and sij rib cartilages on the left side, at a spot about a couple of inches below the nipp and one inch to its sternal side. The lower border is formed by the right ventricle and rests on the cent tendon of the diaphragm. It is defined by a line curving downwards, commencij; Fig. 546.

' Size and weight.—In the adult the heart measures about five inches from ba to apex, three and a half inches across where it is broadest, and two and a half its thickest portion. In the male its weight averages about eleven ounces, and the female about nine ounces. It increases both in size and weight up to advanc life, the increase being most marked up to the age of twenty-nine years.I THE HEART 965 The anterior surface of the heart is convex, and looks upwards and forwards. . its lower and posterior surface, which rests partly on the diaphragm, is flattened. rhe borders which divide the two surfaces of the heart meet near the apex; the 1^. ight border is thin and rather longer than the left, whilst the latter border is thick , Ind rounded.

The ventricles are similarly divided from each other by the inter- ventricular groove, which runs obliquely on the anterior and posterior surfaces of "he heart, meeting below just to the right of the apex where they are continuous. The grooves are ^Dlaced near the borders of the heart, so that the right ventricle 3 mainly anterior, and the left posterior. Of the four cavities into w^hich the heart is divided, the right auricle and |entricle constitute its v enous side, whilst the left auricle and ventricle belong to Is arterial side. The right auricle receives the venous blood of the body through the two ven^e966 THE OBGANS OF CIRCULATION I cavse, and of the heart through the coronary sinus, and transmits it into the righi ventricle. The right ventricle in turn transmits the venous blood to the lungi! through the pulmonary artery. From the lungs it is returned arterialised to thd left auricle of the heart by the pulmonary veins. From the auricle it passes int( the corresponding ventricle, and thence through the aorta and its branches to al parts of the body, including the heart itself. The right auricle.—The right auricle is lined by a smooth and delicat( membrane, the endocardium, which is continuous with the inner coats of th( blood-vessels. It presents a large quadrangular cavity, the sinus venosus or atrium and one much smaller within the auricular appendix. The auricle forms th( right and fore part of the base of the heart. Openings.—Of the three chief openings, that of the superior cava appears a Fig. 548.— Teansveese Section passing theough the Aueicles of the Heaet, SHOWING THE AUEICULO-VENTEICULAE OeIFICES AND THE SeMILUNAE VaLVES OF THE PULMONAEY AeTEEY AND AOETA.

The right auriculo-ventrieular opening, which leads into the ventricle, is placed below and in front; whilst above and '{n front the cavity is prolonged into the auricular appendix. The orifice of the coronary sinus lies between the lower caval and auriculo- ventrieular openings. Besides these there are about a score of small scattered orifices, known as the foramina Thebesii. The superior caval opening is valveless, and is directed downwards and forwards towards the auriculo-ventrieular opening. The inferior caval opening is somewhat larger, and is directed upwards and inwards. It is usually guarded by a semilunar fold, the Eustachian valve, which is much larger in foetal life, and which then serves to direct the current of blood through a foramen in the wall dividing the two auricles. It is attached by its967 THE HEABT convex margin to the front and left side of the vein, its free concave edge looking upwards and to the right. The left cornu or horn of the crescent is continuous [with the anterior edge of the annulus ovalis, whilst the right horn is lost on the auricular wall. The Eustachian valve contains interlacing muscular fibres ; it is often very incomplete and sometimes perforated. ' Fig. 549.—Anterior View of the Right Chambers of the Heart, with the Great Vessels.

Like the Eustachian, it is formed of a fold of the endocardium, and I serves to direct the blood current, but does not prevent regurgitation. It is some- [times perforated, and occasionally presents the most delicate lacework. The foramina Thebesii.—The greater number of these small orifices end968 THE OBGANS OF CIBCULATION j blindly, but the rest are the termmations of minute veins from the musculail substance (vense minimae cordis). One of these, more constant than the others, th( vena Galeni (right marginal), usually opens below the superior cava, on the septa! wall. i The cavity of the right auricle is smooth, except upon its anterior wall, an([ within the appendix, where it is ridged with muscular bands (the musculil pectinati). At the lower part of the posterior wall or septum which divides the two auricles, and just above the orifice of the inferior cava, is a smooth oval depression, th( fossa ovalis. It marks the position of the opening in the foetal heart, to bf| described hereafter ; and is bounded by a well-marked rounded edge, the annuluji ovalis. Beneath its margin a little valvular pouch may usually be noticed whicb, leads into a small orifice passing into the left auricle. ! The tubercle of Lower—which is placed on the right of the cavity between thf: orifices of the two cavse—is well marked in some of the lower animals, but it is quite; an insignificant eminence in man. ' The right ventricle forms the larger part of the heart in front, where it is Fig. 550.—Transverse Section through the Heart near its Apex, showing THE Kelative Thickness of its Muscular Walls, the Bulging of the Septum towards the Eight Ventricle, and the Shape of the Cavities. [ CAVITY OF LEFT VENTRICLE convex ; but below, where it rests upon the diaphragm, it is flattened. It forms, the whole of the lower border (margo acutus) of the heart, but it does not reach the apex, which is formed entirely by the left ventricle. In form the ventricle is triangular, its upper and left angle being continuous: with the root of the pulmonary artery ; and upon opening the cavity the two are | seen to be continuous through a cone-shaped prolongation—the infundibulum oi! conns arteriosus. At the opposite angle there is a second and larger opening, leading from the'; right auricle, the auriculo-ventricular orifice. It lies below and to the right of the; pulmonary orifice. The apex of the ventricle points to the left. The two openings just named are guarded by valves and separated by a rounded, muscular projection of the ventricular wall. The inner surface, or body, of the ventricle presents a somewhat complicated arrangement of nniscular ridges, bands, j and columns, which become smaller, more numerous, and more closely interlaced*) at the apex and near the margin, but which disappear in the infundibulum. ] These projections, or columnse carnese, are usually divided into three sets:969 THE HEABT (1) mere ridges ; (2) bands attached at either end but elsewhere free ; and (3) a third set, the musculi papillares, which need a more detailed description (fig. 549). A special band—the so-called moderator band, which is constant in the sheep— is occasionally a well-marked structure in the human heart, stretching between its anterior and septal walls. The musculi papillares are attached by their broad ends to the ventricular wall, and by their extremities to tendinous cords (chordse tendinese), which restrain and harmonise the action of the valves guarding the auriculo-ventricular opening. Three of these are larger and more constant than the rest: an anterior, connected with the front wall above the moderator band ; a right, near the margin, which is also attached to the anterior wall; and a posterior, which arises from the septum. The septal wall of the ventricle so bulges into the cavity as to make its cross-section appear crescentic. The Openings and theik Valves The orijfice of the pulmonary artery is circular and obhquely placed at the summit of the infundibulum near the septum. It is guarded by three valves, the pulmonary semilunar valves. Of these one is placed anteriorly and to the left, and two posteriorly ; the right being somewhat in advance of the left (fig. 548). Fig. 551.—Interior View of the Aortic Semilunar Valves. Sinus of Valsalva-^ Section o Free edge of valve - t^^^X^^AV- Orifice of right coronarv "^11 artery SI' Corpus Arantii Semilunar valve Decussating fibrous tissue of valve I Immediately above and behind each semilunar valve there is a pouch or sinus. These collectively constitute the pulmonary sinuses, or sinuses of Valsalva. Each valve is formed of a fibrous layer within a reduplication of the lining membrane, which is continuous on the upper surface with the innermost coats of the artery, and on the opposite surface with endocardium of the ventricle. In the centre of the free straight edge of each valve there is a little fibro-carti- laginous nodule, the corpus Arantii, and this margin is further strengthened by a j delicate tendinous band. Another fibrous band in like manner strengthens the I convex attached portion of the valve, and from this a third set of obliquely inter- lacing fibres pass throughout the whole valve towards the nodule. Two narrow I crescent-shaped areas, the lunulse, near the free edge on each side of the nodule, remain almost free from this fibrous invasion, and it is these thinner portions which are in apposition during closure of the valve. A fibrous ring strengthens the pulmonary orifice, giving attachment below to the muscular fibres of the heart; whilst j above, opposite the sinuses of Valsalva, it is deeply hollowed into three semilunar j notches. The valves are attached to the edges of these notches as well as to the ' horns which project inwards and separate them from one another. (See fig. 551, of j the aortic valves, in which these characters are present and more strongly marked.)970 THE ORGANS OF GIBCULATION The auriculo-ventricular opening is oval and guarded by the tricuspid valve. The three triangular flaps of this valve are continuous with one another at their broad ends, and so form a continuous fold around the orifice ; but beyond, they project with jagged and sharply dentated edges towards the apex of the ventricle. The chordae tendineae, which chiefly arise from the papillary muscles already described, pass to their free borders and ventricular surfaces. The largest segment of the valve is placed in front, the smallest behind near the septum, and the third, which is the most movable, is situated on the right between the two ventricular | openings. I Smaller segments intervene between the larger flaps. The chordae tendineae, which arise in groups from the papillary muscles, divide as they pass to be attached to the edges and ventricular surfaces of the neighbouring segments. Additional i cords are furnished from the ventricular walls, and especially from the septum to the small segment, and some of these are provided with little papillary muscles. The segments of this valve, except at the extremities and margins, contain abundant fibrous, a small amount of muscular tissue, and they are attached by their thickened bases to a fibrous ring which surrounds and strengthens the orifice. Fig. 552.—View of the Auriculae Cavities from below (the Transverse Section passing above their Middle). The surfaces which look towards the opening are smooth, whilst upon the opposite surfaces the chords tendineae form an arched interlacement, w4iich has been well likened to the fan tracery of Gothic architecture. (Macalister.) The left auricle is placed behind the roots of the aorta and pulmonary artery, with the right auricle overlapping it, and lying to the right of these structures. Behind, it receives on each side the pulmonary veins. Its narrow and much curved appendix arches round the root of the pulmonary artery, and is the only part of the auricle to be seen from the front. The cavity of the auricle is smooth, with the exception of the appendix, in which the musculi pectinati are well marked. Openings.—Besides the narrow opening which leads from the atrium into the appendix, the left auricle presents posteriorly the orifices of the four pulmonary veins, two of which sometimes have a single mouth, whilst a third may be present, and especially on the right side. The oval auriculo-ventricular opening is placed below and in front. Several small orifices, the foramina Thebesii, are also to be found in the cavity. A crescentic indentation on the septal wall, with its concavity upwards and placed above the level of the annulus ovalis, indicates the upper border of the valve, which has grown upwards to obliterate the foramen ovale,971 THE HEABT but which now is adherent and forms part of the wall dividing the two auricles. As already observed, a small oblique orifice sometimes remains unclosed. The left ventricle forms the chief part of the heart behind, with its apex and left border. It is somewhat longer and narrower than the right, and in cross-section its cavity appears oval.

The musculi papillares are usually represented by two large, sometimes com- pound, muscular pillars, which arise from the anterior and the posterior wall respectively ; and from these the chordae tendinese pass to the edges and surfaces of the two segments of the bicuspid valve. The orifice of the aorta looks somewhat forwards, and is guarded by three 1THE OBGANS OF CIBCULATION 972 semilunar valves, which are similar in structure, but present more strongly marked characters than are to be found in the corresponding valves of the pulmonary artery. Two of these segments are placed anteriorly, the right being slightly in advance of the left; and one is placed posteriorly and slightly to the right. It is surrounded by a fibrous ring similar to that which strengthens the pulmonary orifice. The auriculo-ventricular opening is guarded by the bicuspid valve. Its two unequal segments are larger and thicker than those on the right side of the heart, though the orifice itself is somewhat smaller, and they are similarly separated by smaller lobes or cusps. Of the two segments, the one, which is the larger and the more free and smooth, is placed in front and to the right between the two openings, whilst the other lies behind and to the left. The fibrous ring surrounding the orifice serves to give attachment to muscular fibres as well as to the valves. By its right border it is tied to the aortic ring by fibrous tissue, which also extends to the ring surrounding the tricuspid valve. In the angular space thus bounded there is imbedded a fibro-cartilage, which in some mammals is represented by a bone which is known as the os cordis. The Position of the Chief Oeifices one to the other and TO the Chest Wall The pulmonary orifice is placed in front of, and to the left of the right auriculo- ■ ventricular opening, whilst the aortic orifice is in front of, and to the right of the ! left auriculo-ventricular opening. The relation of the valved orifices to the chest i wall can only be approximately determined. The pulmonary semilunar valves, which are anterior in position to the aortic, , are placed behind the junction of the third rib with the sternum on the left side. The aortic semilunar valves, more deeply placed, correspond to the third space, j close to the sternum. The tricuspid valve is situated behind the sternum near the middle line, about j the level of the fourth costal cartilage. The mitral valve lies deeply behind the third intercostal space about an inch to - the left of the sternum. ; The muscular walls of the heart vary very much in thickness, and the foetal i differs from the adult heart in the relative muscularity of its chambers. The right auricle is thinner than the left, the right measuring about one-twelfth j of an inch, and the left about one-eighth of an inch in thickness. The right ventricular wall in the adult is much thinner than the left, being thickest at the base, and thinnest at the apex. The left ventricular w^all is about double the thickness of the right; and it is thickest where it is broadest, being thinner both at its base and apex. The Vessels and Neeves j The arteries.—The two coronary arteries, right and left, arise from the aorta just above the free borders of the right and left semilunar valves. The right coronary artery passes forwards between the pulmonary artery and the right auricular appendix, and then winds to the right border of the heart, around which it turns to gain its posterior surface. In this course it lies in the auriculo- ventricular groove. At the commencement of the posterior interventricular groove it divides into its two main branches, one of which, still passing onwards in the auriculo-ventricular groove, anastomoses with the left coronary, whilst the other (interventricular) descends in the furrow between the ventricles towards the apex, near which it anastomoses with branches derived from the left coronary artery which have reached the posterior surface of the heart after passing around its apex, iTHE HEABT 973 In this course the right coronary artery supplies branches to the right auricle (auricular) and roots of the pulmonary artery and aorta, as well as one that descends near the right border of the heart (right marginal), and a second (preventricular) to the anterior wall of the right ventricle. It supplies both ventricles and the septum. The left coronary artery passes for a short distance forwards, between the pulmonary artery and the left auricular appendix, and then divides into two prin- cipal branches, one of which descends in the interventricular groove to the apex of the heart (interventricular), around which it sends branches to anastomose with Fig. 554.—Showing the Position of the Heart and its Valves to the Chest Wall. (Reduced from Hensman and Fisher's ' Anatomical Outlines.') (The right auricle and ventricle, with the pulmonary semilunar and tricuspid valves, are outlined in blue tints ; whilst the left auricle and ventricle, with their corresponding valves, are indicated in red.) the right coronary ; whilst the other winds to the back of the heart in the auriculo- [ ventricular groove, to anastomose after division with the corresponding twigs of I the^'right artery. In this course it gives off a branch which descends near the left border of the heart (left marginal), as well as smaller branches to the left auricle, both ventricles, and the commencement of the aorta and pulmonary vessels. The cardiac or coronary veins accompany the coronary arteries and return the blood from the walls of the heart. The (so-called) great cardiac vein ascends in the anterior interventricular sulcus,THE ORGANS OF CIRCULATION 974 passing round the left side of tlie heart to its posterior surface in the auriculo- ventricular groove to terminate in the commencement of the coronary sinus. Its mouth is usually guarded by two valves, and it receives in its course the left marginal vein, with other smaller veins from the left auricle (the left auricular) and ventricle, all of which are guarded by valves. The posterior cardiac vein (posterior interventricular), sometimes the larger of the two chief veins, communicates with the foregoing at its commencement on the anterior surface above the heart's apex. It ascends in the posterior interventricular groove, receiving blood from the ventricular walls, and joins the coronary sinus through an orifice guarded by a single valve close to its termination. Fig. 555.—Anterior View of the Heart, showing its Arteries and Veins. The anterior cardiac veins (preventricular) consist of several small branches from the front of the right ventricle, which open separately into the right auricle, or into the right auricular vein ; and a right marginal vein (vein of Galen), which joins the coronary sinus near its termination, or opens separately into the lower part of the right auricle (figs. 549, 555). The coronary sinus may be regarded as a much dilated terminal portion of the great cardiac vein. It is about an inch in length, covered by muscular fibres from the auricle, and lies in the auriculo-ventricular groove on the posterior surface of the heart. Its cardiac orifice with the coronary (Thebesian) valve has already been described. Besides the tributary veins already named, a small oblique vein of Marshall may sometimes be traced from the vestigial fold to the sinus. This little vein, which is not always pervious or easy of demonstration, never possesses a valve at its orifice, and like the coronary sinus formed a part of the left superior vena cava of early foetal life. The sinus also receives the posterior interventricular vein,975 THE HEABT one or more right auricular branches, and several post-ventricular veins from the back of the left ventricle. The cardiac nerves descend into the superior mediastinum, passing in front of and behind the arch of the aorta, to unite in the formation of the superficial and deep cardiac plexuses. The deep cardiac plexus, the larger and more important, is placed immediately labove the pulmonary artery at its point of division, lying between the trachea and transverse arch of the aorta. It is usually formed by the interlacement of all the cardiac branches, with the exception of the left superior cardiac branch from the sympathetic and the left inferior cardiac from the pneumogastric. A meshwork of branches descends from the plexus, some passing to the right Fig. 556.—Posterior View of the Heart, showing its Arteries and Veins.

The left branches, which are both larger and more numerous, descend beneath be corresponding pulmonary artery to join the posterior coronary plexus ; seme of bese pass right and left to join the anterior pulmonary plexuses at the roots f the lungs. The superficial cardiac plexus, which lies in front of the right pulmonary artery s it passes beneath the arch of the aorta, is formed by the interlacement of the left aperficial cardiac branch from the sympathetic, the inferior cardiac from the beumogastric, together with branches derived from the deep plexus. A small ranglion, the cardiac ganglion of Wrisberg, is sometimes found close to the right I,976 THE OBGANS OF CIRCULATION Fig. 557.—Anterior View of a Fcetus. The Heart, Vessels, and Chief Organs DISPLAYED, with THE PlACENTA AND UmBILICAL CoRD.THE FCETAL HEABT 977 side of the ductus arteriosus. The filaments from this plexus form the greater portion of the anterior coronary plexus. Some, however, reach the left anterior pulmonary plexus. The coronary plexuses follow the course of the vessels, and their filaments enter the muscular walls of the heart. Minute ganglia are connected with these filaments, and are especially ahundant near the auriculo-ventricular groove. Peculiarities of the Fcetal Heart The foetal heart is at first almost vertical in position, but during the latter half of intra-uterine life it gradually assumes the oblique position it retains in the adult. Its weight in relation to the body varies considerably. Thus at the second imonth it is about 1 to 50 ; at birth it is 1 to 120 ; whilst in the adult it is about 1 to 160. The auricular portion is at first more capacious than the ventricular, and the right auricle is larger than the left. The ventricular walls are at first about equal in thickness, but at birth the left wall is the thicker of the two. The foramen ovale is largest about the sixth month of intra-uterine life, and there is up to this period a direct communication between the two auricles. The ivalve of the foramen ovale, however, gradually advancing upwards beyond the lannulus, on its left side, acts as a perfect valve during the latter half of foetal life,, and thus prevents the return of blood into the right auricle. The Eustachian valve has already been described ; it is of large size in the foetal heart, and serves to direct the current of blood from the inferior cava into the left auricle. The ductus arteriosus continues the pulmonary artery onwards to the concavity of the arch of the aorta, to a point just beyond the origin of the left subclavian artery, and so transmits the blood from the right ventricle into the descending- aorta. The ductus arteriosus during the growth of the pulmonary artery becomes ultimately associated with its left branch. The foetal circulation.—The right auricle of the heart receives its blood from both ven^e cav«, as well as from the coronary sinus. That which is conveyed by the superior cava is venous blood returned from the head and neck and upper extremities. The inferior cava returns the blood from the lower half of the body,, as well as that which comes from the placenta through the umbilical vein. This The black connecting arrows indicate the course of the circulation through the head and neck, the upper extremities, the lungs, the liver, and the lower extremities. The red arrows show the direction of the current from the placenta, through the umbilical vein, ductus venosus (d.v.) and liver, to the upper portion of the inferior vena cava. The red arrows with the blue tails and the dotted line show the course of the less pure blood, as it enters the right auricle through the inferior vena cava, and traverses the foramen ovale, guided by the Eustachian valve, to gain the left auricle, left ventricle, and aorta, to be distributed by its chief branches to the head and neck and upper extremities. The blue arrows are placed on the superior and inferior venae cavae, and some of their (main tributary trunks. I The stream derived from the superior cava passes through the right auricle—in front of that already described—to reach the right ventricle ; thence it passes into the pulmonary artery (a small portion only reaching the lungs through the right and left pulmonary branches), ductus arteriosus, and descending aorta. The stream derived from the inferior cava mixes with the blood of the umbilical vein, and that which has passed through the liver, beyond the junction of the ductus venosus and hepatic veins. The blue arrows with the red tails show the course of the blood through the descending aorta to the lower extremities, and through the umbilical arteries to the placenta. The colours of the arrows roughly indicate the proportion of pure and impure blood in ^the different parts of the circulation. 3 K978 THE OBGANS OF CIBGULATION latter stream reaches the inferior cava, in part directly through the ductus venosus and in part through the liver and hepatic veins. The hlood of the superior vena cava passes from the right auricle into the righi ■ventricle, and thence through the pulmonary artery (a small portion only reachinJ the lungs) and ductus arteriosus to the descending aorta. Through this trunk if is conducted to the lower half of the body as well as to the placenta through thJ umbilical arteries. From these parts it is returned to the right auricle by thd Fig. 558. -Anterior View of Heart and Great Vessels of Fcetus, the Anterior Chest Wall being removed and the Heart Sac opened.

LECTURER ON ANATOMY AT THS MIDDLESEX HOSPITAL MEDICAL COLLEGE ; AJs^D SURGEON TO THE THROAT AND EAR DEPARTMENT OF THE MIDDLESEX HOSPITAL, THE MOUTH THE mouth is the cavity at the commencement of the ahmentary canal which contains the organs of taste and mastication and the greater part of those of speech. It communicates with the exterior through a transverse orifice (the buccal orifice) and with the pharynx through the fauces. It is bounded anteriorly and laterally by the teeth and alveolar arches ; external to which is a second cavity, often described as the vestibule of the mouth, which is enclosed by the lips and cheeks. Its roof is formed by the hard palate, its floor by the tongue, with the mucous membrane reflected from it to the inner surface of the gums over the sublingual glands and the Whartonian ducts ; and posteriorly it opens into the fauces. It is lined by mucous membrane, which is continuous with that of the pharynx, and at the outer margin of the lips is continuous with the skin. The buccal orifice is a horizontal slit, the extremities or ' angles ' of which are jopposite the first bicuspid teeth. The orifice is bounded by the upper and lower lips, jof which the former is distinguished by a median tubercle, the remains of the free extremity of the fronto-nasal process. The lips are covered by a dry mucous Imembrane, bright red in colour, and extremely sensitive, containing large numbers jof vascular papillfe, in many of which are nerve-terminations resembling touch- jcorpuscles. Near to the junction of the skin and mucous membrane are numerous sebaceous follicles, but these are devoid of hair-bulbs. The substance of the lips consists of the orbicularis oris and a quantity of areolar tissue in which are embedded the coronary vessels, lymphatics, and small branches of the infraorbital and mental nerves. Around the orifice of the mouth on its inner aspect, and placed beneath the mucous membrane, are a number of small ilobulated glands known as the ' labial glands.' The cheeks consist of the buccinator muscle, covered externally, first by a stratum of subcutaneous fat, then by the dermal muscles, zygomatici and risorius, and lastly by the skin. They are lined with mucous membrane, which contains numerous buccal glands similar to, but smaller than, the labial glands ; and about five of larger size, which, opening opposite to the last molar teeth, are known as the molar glands. Between the integument and the mucous membrane, besides muscles, areolar tissue, vessels, and nerves, there is in each cheek a large quantity of fat, which gives 3 e2980 THE OBGANS OF DIGESTION rotundity to the features, and constitutes what is sometimes spoken of as tb sucking cushion of the cheek. Opposite the second upper molar tooth is a papi which marks the opening of the duct of the parotid gland. The gums are formed by a layer of tough areolar tissue covering the alveola: processes, and firmly attached to their periosteum. They are covered on both aspects by the mucous membrane of the mouth, tb inner surfaces receiving reflexions from the sides and anterior extremity of tb tongue, a median fold forming the frsenum of that organ ; and the outer surfaces receiving reflexions from the cheeks and lips. In the median line above and below the orifice of the mouth are folds of mucous membrane, forming the fraena labiorum, of which the upper is the more marked. i THE PALATE | The palate consists of two portions, the anterior or ha^rd palate, and the posterioi or soft palate. ^ The hard palate, which is limited in front and laterally by the alveolar processes, ends posteriorly in a free border to which the soft palate is attached. The mucous membrane which covers it is thick and somewhat pale, and is firmly bound down to its periosteum. In the median line of the palate is a ridge called' the raphe ; and at the anterior extremity of this is a small papilla which marks the inferior opening of the anterior palatine canal. The mucous membrane coverino; this receives its nerve-supply from the anterior palatine and naso-palatine nerves. The SOFT PALATE (fig. 560) is attached to the posterior border of the hard palate, of which it forms a backward prolongation hanging down at the back the mouth, and thus partially separating the latter cavity from the pharynx. Its| sides are merged in the pharyngeal wall, and its lower border is free. From the centre of this border a somewhat conical process, the uvula, depends and from the base of this two folds of mucous membrane on each side extend in ar' outward and downward direction, receiving the name of the pillars of the fauces. The anterior pillar is formed principally by the palato-giossus muscle, and its^ direction is downward, outward, and forward to the side of the base of the tongue. The posterior pillar is formed principally by the palato-pharyngeus. It, approaches more nearly to its fellow of the opposite side than does the anterior. Its direction is outward, downward and backward, and there thus exists between itj and the anterior pillar a triangular space, the tonsillar recess. The space between the pillars is known as the isthmus of the fauces, and forms ^ the buccal opening of the pharynx. It is bounded below by the tongue, above by; the soft palate, and laterally by the pillars of the fauces. i The anterior surface of the soft palate is concave, directed forwards and, downwards, and is continuous with the surface of the hard palate ; its posterior, surface is convex, and is a continuation of the floor of the nasal cavity. The soft palate is composed of a thin but rather dense fibrous aponeurosis, certain muscles, vessels, and mucous glands covered by mucous membrane. i In the median line is a raphe which marks the junction of the two halves of | which the soft palate originally consists. ! Muscles.—The muscles of the soft palate are, on each side :—palato-giossus,; palato-pharyngeus, levator palati, and tensor palati; and, in the middle line, azygos uvulae, which divides above into two parts. The Palato-Glossus is described on page 483.THE PALATE 981 The Palato-Pharyngeus—named from its attachments—is a thin sheet. Origin.—(1) From the aponem'osis of the soft palate by two heads which are bparated by the insertion of the levator palati; (2) one or two narrow bundles :om the lower part of the cartilage of the Eustachian tube {salpmgo-johary?igeus). Insertion.—(1) By a narrow fasciculus into the posterior border of the thyroid [irtilage near the base of the superior cornu; (2) by a broad expansion into the ;brous layer of the pharynx at its lower part. Structure.—The upper head of the muscle consists of scattered fibres which ijlend with the opposite muscle across the middle line; the lower head is thicker, nd follows the curve of the posterior border of the palate. The two heads with le fasciculus from the Eustachian tube form a compact muscular band in the osterior pillar of the fauces ; the fibres mingle with those of the stylo-pharyngeus, nd then expand upon the lower part of the pharynx. Nerve-supply.—From the pharyngeal plexus. Action.—(1) Approximates the posterior pillars of the fauces; (2) depresses he soft palate ; (3) elevates the pharynx. ! The Levator Palati—named from its action on the soft palate—is somewhat punded in its upper, but flattened in its lower half. I Origin.—(1) The under surface of the petrosal anterior to the orifice of the |irotid canal; (2) the lower margin of the cartilage of the Eustachian tube. [ Insertion.—The aponeurosis of the soft palate ; the terminal fibres of the luscle of each side meet in the middle line in front of the azygos uvulae. Structure.—Its origin is by a short tendon ; the muscle then becomes fleshy, ad continues so to its insertion. Nerve-supply.—It is usual to describe this muscle as being enervated by the Lcial through the petrosal branch of the Vidian. The nerve is supposed to reach le muscle in the branching of the posterior palatine. Stimulation of the facial ■unk within the skull of monkeys produces no result on the soft palate, whereas simulation of the eleventh causes elevation of the soft palate on the same side, he motor branch probably passes to the palate in the upper branch of the pharyn- 3al plexus. (Horsley and Beevor.) Action.—(1) To raise up the palate, and bring it in contact with the posterior jail of the pharynx; (2) when the muscle contracts it presses up and closes the laryngeal orifice of the Eustachian tube (Cleland). This action is not admitted f many anatomists. The Tensor Palati—named from its action on the soft palate—is a thin, flat, id narrow sheet. Origin.—(1) The scaphoid fossa at the root of the internal pterygoid plate; ) the alar spine of the sphenoid; (3) the outer side of the pharyngeal extre- jity of the Eustachian tube. Insertion.—(1) Into the transverse ridge on the under surface of the horizontal ate of the palate bone ; (2) the aponeurosis of the soft palate. Structure.—Its belly as it descends between the internal pterygoid muscle and .e internal pterygoid plate is muscular. On approachmg the hamular process it icomes tendinous, and continues so to its insertion. A bursa is interposed between e hamular process and the tendon. The belly of the muscle is at nearly a right iigle with its tendon. Nerve-supply.—From the otic ganglion on the mandibular division of the fifth : irve. Actions.—(1) Tightens the soft palate; (2) opens the Eustachian tube during < glutition. The Azygos Uvulae—named because it was supposed to be a single muscle. Origin.—(1) From the aponeurosis of the soft palate; (2) the nasal spine of e palate bone k982 THE OBGANS OF DIGESTION I Insertion.—Into the uvula. : Structure.—The muscle consists of two narrow parallel strips lying on eac side of the middle line of the palate. Nerve-supply.—Probably from the same source as the levator palati. Action.—To draw up the uvula. j The Mucous Membrane of the soft palate is continuous with that of the mout | on its anterior aspect, and with that of the nasal chamber on its posterior surface j its epithelium is columnar and ciliated in the vicinity of the Eustachian tube, bri elsewhere it is squamous and not ciliated. The glands form an especially thic I layer on its superior aspect. j Arterial supply of the soft palate.—(1) Ascending palatine of facial; (2) paki tine branch of ascending pharyngeal; (3) twigs from superior palatine of interna maxillary, which enter the smaller palatine canals, and are distributed to the soj| palate and tonsils, and communicate with the ascending palatine of the faci^ , artery; (4) lingual artery, by twigs from the dorsal branch. Nerves to the soft palate.—(1) Branches from Meckel's ganglion ('small o' posterior palatine' and 'external palatine nerve'); (2) tonsillitic branches c' glosso-pharyngeal nerve ; and (3) the nerA-es supplying the muscles (p. 981). i The TONSILS (figs. 507 and 560) are two bodies situated one in each of thili recesses between the anterior and posterior pillars of the fauces. They are show half an inch (15 mm.) in length, and one-third (8 mm.) in width and thickness ; bu their size is liable to considerable variation. ' On their inner surfaces are a number of puncture-like openings (twelve to fiftee: on each tonsil), which form the orifices of small recesses or crypts, into whic numerous follicles open. The mucous membrane is continued into, and forms ; lining for, these follicles ; and their walls are surrounded by an aggregation of closet; capsules somewhat similar to the solitary glands of the intestine, and containing ; thick secretion. The tonsil is in relation externally with the internal carotid and ascending pharyngeal arteries, the superior constrictor intervening, and its position correspond: to the angle of the lower jaw. i The arteries of the tonsil are five in number, viz. :—(1) Dorsalis linguae fron - the lingual; (2) ascending pharyngeal from the external carotid ; (3) ascendim palatine from the facial ; (4) tonsillar from the facial; and (5) descending palatiiK; from the internal maxillary. The veins of the tonsil form a plexus which occupies the outer side of the gland i The nerves of the tonsil are branches of the fifth and glosso-pharyngeal. ; THE SALIVARY GLANDS ' i The three chief salivary glands are the parotid, the submaxillary (mandibular) \ and the sublingual. These all pour their secretions into the cavity of the mouth j into which also open a number of smaller glands to mix their contents with tht ( saliva. : The PAEOTID GLAND, lying just below and in front of the ear—the largest o i the salivary glands—varies from a little over half an ounce to an ounce in weight. Its superficial area is limited above by the root of the zygoma ; behind, j the auditory meatus, the mastoid process, and the sterno-mastoid muscle with th( j posterior belly of the digastric; anteriorly, it extends for a varying distance ovei \THE SALIVARY GLANDS 98^ the masseter muscle ; and below, it is bounded by a line passing from the angle of the jaw backwards. Its deep portion is in contact with the styloid process and its muscles, and also with the sheath containing the internal carotid artery and internal jugular vein. The stylo-mandibular ligament separates the parotid from the submaxillary gland. Processes or lobes pass from the body of the gland in various directions : one extends forwards beneath the ramus of the mandible between the two pterygoid muscles; a second passes inwards beneath the temporo-mandibular articulation, filling the back of the glenoid cavity ; and a third, forming the deepest portion of the gland, surrounds the styloid process and passes between the carotid vessels. These have been named respectively the pterygoid, glenoid, and carotid lobes. There is often in addition a detached lobe, known as the socia parotidis. It is placed below the zj^goma, and above the main duct, into which it pours its contents by a separate channel. The outer rounded surface of the parotid gland lies beneath the deep fascia.

Two or three lymphatic glands are placed on this surface. From the upper part of the gland the temporal artery emerges to be joined by the temporal branches of the auriculo-temporal nerve. The duct passes forwards from its anterior border, with branches of the facial nerve and the transverse facial artery. Within the substance of the gland are found the following structures:—The termination of the external carotid artery with the commencement of the temporal, the transverse facial, the internal maxillary and posterior auricular arteries, all of which supply branches to the gland ; the temporo-maxillary vein, with a connecting; branch to the internal jugular, the facial nerve which crosses the artery in its passage forwards and breaks up into the pes anserinus before emerging from the anterior portion of the gland. There is a branch also of the great auricular nerve,984 THE OBGANS OF DIGESTION which penetrates the gland to join the facial. One or two lympathic glands, commonly lie imbedded within the parotid. The duct of the parotid (Stenson's) crosses the masseter a finger's breadth below the zygoma. It penetrates the fat of the cheek and the fibres of the buccinator muscle, between which and the mucous membrane it runs for a short distance before it terminates, on the summit of a little paj^illa, by a minute orifice. This opening is placed opposite the crown of the second upper molar tooth. The duct commences by numerous branches, which converge towards the anterior border of' the gland, and receives in its passage across the masseter the duct of the socia j parotidis. Its canal is about the size of a crow^-quill. Its mucous membrane is \ lined by a columnar epithelium. The coat of the duct is thick and tough, and consists of fibrous tissue intermixed with contractile fibres. The arteries have been already described lying within the gland substance. The veins have a similar distribution to the arteries. The nerves are derived from the facial, great auricular, the carotid plexus of the sympathetic, and the auriculo-temporal. The latter also conveys a branch derived from the giosso-pharyngeal through the lesser petrosal and otic ganglion. The lymphatics terminate in the superficial and deep cervical glands. The parotid gland has been observed to retain its primitive condition, lying over the mandible and masseter muscle. Its lobes are absent in early childhood. The SUBMAXILLARY GLAND weighs about two drachms, and occupies the fore part of the submaxillary triangle. It is covered by the skin, platysma, facial vein, the inframandibular branches of the facial nerve, and the deep fascia; and it extends upwards to occupy the submaxillary fossa, beneath the body of the mandible. The anterior belly of the digastric lies in front; behind, the stylo-mandibular ligament separates it from the parotid. The facial artery lies in a deep groove which occupies its hinder and upper portion. Its deep surface is in relation with the mylo-hyoid in front, and the hyo-glossus behind, with a few fibres of the stylo-glossus muscle superiorly, and in addition the mylo-hyoid artery and nerve. The mylo-hyoid muscle separates the submaxillary from the sublingual gland, and around the posterior free border of this muscle a deep process of the gland turns forwards on the hyo-glossus. Several lymphatic glands are found on the surface or imbedded within the glandular substance. '' , The duct of the submaxillary gland (Wharton's) passes forwards and inwards from the deep lobe just described, to open by a small orifice on the summit of a papilla by the side of the frsenum of the tongue. In this course it passes above the lingual nerve. It lies at first between the mylo-hyoid and hyo-glossus; next, between the mylo-hyoid and genio-hyo-glossus ; and lastly, under cover of the mucous membrane of the mouth, between the genio-hyo-glossus and the sublingual gland. The duct is about two inches (5 cm.) in length, and has comparatively thin coats. It is lined by columnar epithelium. The arteries to the gland are derived from the facial and lingual, with corre- sponding veins. The nerves proceed from the submandibular ganglion, from the mylo-hyoid of the mandibular nerve, and from branches of the sympathetic. The SUBLINGUAL GLAND—the smallest of the salivary glands—is about one -drachm in weight. It lies beneath the fore part of the tongue and mucous membrane of the floor of the mouth, close to the frgenum, deeply resting upon the mylo-hyoid muscle. It is limited externally by the sublingual fossa of the mandible, and internally by the genio-hyo-glossus and Wharton's duct; in front it touches its fellow, and behind, it approaches the deep lobe of the submaxillary gland. The duct from the main portion of the gland—the duct of Rivini—runs along- side the submaxillary duct, to open with it on the same papilla. The fore part of the gland consists of a cluster of little lobules, each with its own separate duct.THE PHARYNX 985 jChey open in a line on the floor of the month. The innermost of the series very ;ommonly opens into the submaxillary duct. The arteries are derived from the sublingual and submental, with their corre- iponding veins. The nerves are derived from the gustatory (through the submandibular ganglion) ^nd from the sympathetic. THE PHARYNX The pharynx is placed behind the nose and mouth, and extends from the base f the skull to the lower part of the cricoid cartilage opposite the fifth cervical rertebra. The soft palate projects into it from the front, dividing it into a nasal portion above, and a buccal portion below. The openings of the two posterior nares which are in front, and the orifices of he two Eustachian tubes, one on each side, open into the naso-pharynx ; whilst nto the buccal portion below the velum are the single openings of the mouth in ront, and the larynx and oesophagus below, j Thus there are seven openings leading into its cavity. It measures from above downwards about four and a half inches (11"3 cm.), Ind is flattened from before backwards, so that the cavity in this direction is xtremely contracted, its mucous membrane, especially above, being thrown into aumerous folds and recesses ; whilst below the cavity becomes entirely obliterated, or here its anterior and posterior walls, except during the act of swallowing, are n actual contact. Thus it measures much more from side to side, being widest )pposite the cornua of the hyoid bone. It is narrowest below where it passes into he oesophagus. The pharyngeal walls are composed of a fibrous coat, the pharyngeal aponeu- ■osis, lined by a mucous membrane, and surrounded externally by muscular layers nvested by a delicate areolar sheath which lies beneath the stronger post-pharyngeal 'ascia. The pharyngeal aponeurosis is well marked above, but below it loses its density md gradually disappears as a definite structure. Above, it is attached to the posterior portion of the body of the sphenoid bone in front of the pharyngeal iubercle. Its attachment may be traced outwards to the apex of the petrous portion )f the temporal bone, to the cartilage which intervenes between it and the occipital ibone, and thence to the Eustachian tube and internal pterygoid plate. The mucous membrane of the pharynx is continuous with the several cavities ivhich open into it. It is closely adherent to the base of the skull, thick and spongy md dark in colour. It becomes thinner Avhere it approaches the openings of the posterior nares and Eustachian tubes, and below it is paler and folded longitudi- nally. Lymphoid follicles and numerous racemose glands exist throughout the mucous membrane. The epithehum is cihated and columnar in the naso-pharynx, but becomes stratified and scaly in the lower portion. Muscles.—The muscular coat consists of the three constrictor muscles, with (additional fibres derived from the stylo- and palato-pharyngei muscles. The inferior constrictor is thick and strong. It arises from the thyroid carti- lage immediately behind the oblique line and superior tubercle, and also from the inferior cornu and the side of the cricoid cartilage behind the crico-thyroid muscle (fig. 521). The fibres spread backwards and inwards, the lowest hoiizontally,986 ' THE OBGANS OF DIGESTION whilst those above ascend more and more obliquely, and are inserted into the fibrous raphe of the pharynx. Some of the lowest fibres are continuous with the muscular fibres of the oesophagus, and the upper overlap the middle constrictor. Near the upper border the superior laryngeal nerve and artery pierce the thyro- hyoid membrane to reach the larynx. The recurrent laryngeal nerve ascends I beneath the lower border immediately behind the crico-thyroid articulation. | The middle constrictor is a fan- shaped muscle which arises from the lesser cornu of the hyoid bone, the whole length of the greater cornu, and from the stylo-hyoid i ligament. The diverging fibres are inserted into the median raphe, and blend with' those of the opposite side. The lower fibres of the muscle descend beneath the! inferior constrictor to the lower part of the pharynx ; the upper overlap the superior constrictor, and reach the basilar process of the occipital bone ; whilst the middle: fibres run transversely. i The stylo-pharyngeus and glosso-pharyngeal nerve pass downwards above its | Fig. 560.—Section showing the Posterior Wall of the Pharynx, with the Pharyngeal Bursa, Fauces, etc. upper border, and near its origin it is overlapped by the hyo-giossus and crossed by the lingual artery. The superior constrictor is quadrilateral in shape, pale and thin. It arises from the lower third of the hinder edge of the internal pterygoid plate and its hamular process, from the pterygo-mandibular ligament, from the posterior fifth of the mylo-hyoid ridge of the mandible, and from the side of the tongue. The fibres pass backwards to be inserted into the median raphe, the highest reaching the pharyngeal spine. The Eustachian tube and the levator palati muscle are placed above the superior arched border, and the space between this and the basilar process, devoid of muscular fibres, is strengthened by the pharyngeal aponeurosis. It is semilunar in shape, and named the sinus of Morgagni.j THE (ESOPHAGUS 987 The stylo-pharyngeus arises from the base of the styloid process internally. It passes downwards and inwards to reach the pharynx between the superior and middle constrictors. Its fibres spread out as it descends beneath the mucous membrane. Some join the fibres of the palato-pharyngeus to be inserted into the posterior border of the thyroid cartilage, and the rest interblend with the [ constrictors. I The palato-pharyngeus is described with the muscles of the soft palate (pages 981 and following). ! The muscular coat of the pharynx is supplied by the pharyngeal x^lexus and the external and recurrent laryngeal nerves. The stylo-pharyngeus is supplied by j the glosso-pharyngeal nerve. [ Relations.—The pharynx is loosely connected by areolar tissue with the pre- [vertebral fascia, the longus colli, and the rectus capitis anticus major muscles, and vertebral column. Laterally, it is in relation with the styloid process and its muscles, the glosso-pharyngeal nerve, the lateral lobes of the thyroid gland, the sheath of the carotid vessels, the pharyngeal plexus and ascending pharyngeal artery; above, it is separated from the ramus of the mandible and internal ptery- j goid muscle by a cellular interval; and beneath its investing fascia there is a plexus I of veins. I The interior of the pharynx, viewed from behind, presents the seven openings I already named. At its upper and back part the mucous membrane forms a rounded projection which corresponds to the anterior recti muscles, and on each side of this it sinks backwards, beneath the tip of the petrous portion of the temporal bone, to form a cul-de-sac known as the pharyngeal recess. j In the roof of the cavity just below the body of the occipital bone and in the middle line, the mucous membrane dips into a little pouch with a contracted orifice, the pharyngeal bursa. It is the persistent lower portion of the pharyngeal j diverticulum (pouch of Rathke). It is easily demonstrated in the foetus and young child, but commonly entirely disappears in the adult. Stretching across the pharyngeal wall between the Eustachian orifices and above the pharyngeal bursa, there occurs a special group of lymphatic follicles. It extends indefinitely upwards towards the roof of the cavity, and constitutes the pharyngeal tonsil. This portion of the naso-pharynx is exceedingly liable to become swollen and chronically thickened in naso-pharyngeal catarrh. THE (ESOPHAGUS The (Bsophagus is that portion of the alimentary tract which extends between i the pharynx and the stomach. It is more constricted than the rest of the canal, I being narrowest at its commencement opposite the sixth cervical vertebra and lower , border of the cricoid cartilage. It is again somewhat contracted in its passage through the diaphragm, which is opposite the upper border of the eleventh thoracic II vertebra. It is nine or ten inches (25 cm.) in length, and in its course downwards I follows the curves of the vertebral column, until it finally passes forwards in front of, and slightly to the left of the aorta to gain the oesophageal opening in the dia- j phragm. In addition to these curves it presents two lateral curvatures towards the left side, at the root of the neck, and also below where it leaves the vertebral column. It is placed in the middle line at its commencement opposite the fifth cervical vertebra, and again, at a lower level, opposite the fifth thoracic vertebra. Relations in the neck.—The oesophagus has in front of it the trachea, theTHE OBGANS OF DIGESTION 988 posterior portion of the left lateral lobe of the thyroid gland, and the left recurrent laryngeal nerve. Behind, it rests upon the vertebral column, the left longus colli muscle, and prevertebral fascia. On its ri^ht side are placed the right carotid and right recurrent nerve; and on the left side the left inferior thyroid vessels, left carotid artery, left subclavian, and thoracic duct. The recurrent nerves pass upwards on each side to gain the interval between the trachea and oesophagus. The left nerve, as already described, at first lies in front of the tube, and the right at some little distance from it. In the thorax the oesophagus descends through the superior and posterior mediastina. In front are the following structures :—the lower part of the trachea with the commencement of the left bronchus, the transverse arch of the aorta, left carotid and left subclavian arteries. Below is the posterior surface of the pericardium. Behind, it is in relation with the vertebral column, longus colli muscle, the thoracic duct, the right intercostal vessels, the left lower azygos vein, and the lower portion of the thoracic aorta. Laterally it comes into contact with both pleural sacs and with the pneumo- gastric nerves. BeloAv the roots of lungs these form a plexus (the plexus gul^) surrounding the gullet; finally the left nerve gains the front, and the right nerve passes to the back of the tube. The vena azygos major ascends on the right side, and the aorta descends on the left. After death the gullet is somewhat flattened from before backwards, but it is more rounded during life. It is closed except during the passage of food, etc. Structure.—The wall of the oesophagus is composed of three coats—muscular, submucous, and mucous. It is surrounded with elastic cellular tissue, loosely con- necting it with the neighbouring structures, and freely permitting its distension. The muscular coat is thick, red, and consists of striped muscular fibres in its upper third or more. It is made up of two distinct layers. The longitudinal fibres commence as three flattened bands : a strong anterior arising from the ridge on the back of the cricoid cartilage (fig. 526), and two lateral bands which blend with the fibres of the pharynx. These all unite into a conti- nuous layer which passes below into the muscular coat of the stomach. Several accessory bands have been described, connected with the trachea, left bronchus, pericardium, and left pleura. The circular fibres are continuous above with the inferior constrictor, and below with the oblique fibres of the stomach ; they form a uniform layer which becomes somewhat obliquely disposed towards the middle of the gullet. The submucous coat loosely connects the inner mucous and outer muscular coats. It is the seat of numerous racemose glands whose ducts open on the surface of the mucous membrane. The mucous coat is thick, reddish above, paler below, and deeply folded longitu- dinally. It presents numerous papilla and contains racemose glands. It is lined by a stratified squamous epithelium. ^THE PEBITONEUM 989 THE ABDOMINAL YISCEEA By FEEDEEICK TEEVES, F.E.C.S.Eng. SURGEOX TO AND LECTURER OX AXATOMY AT THE LONDON HOSPITAL ; jrEMBER OF THE BOARD OP EXAMINERS OF THE ROYAL COLLEGE OF SURGEONS ; EXAMIXER IX SURGERY AT THE UXIYERSITY OF CAMBRIDGE. THE PERITONEUM Its general character.—The peritoneum is a thin and delicate serous membrane which hnes the cavity of the abdomen from the diaphragm to the pelvic floor, and linvests or covers to a varying extent the viscera which that cavity contains. 'Viewed in its very simplest condition, it may be regarded as a closed sac, the inner sm^face of which is smooth and perfectly polished, while the outer surface is rough and is attached to the tissues w^hich surround it. Could it be possible for the peritoneum to be removed entire from the body by some process of superhuman dissection, it would appear simply as a huge thin-walled bag. In the male subject the peritoneum forms actually a closed sac; but in the Fig. 561.—Transverse Section of the Peritoneal Sac at about the Level OF the Umbilicus. female its w^all exhibits tw^o minute punctures, which correspond to the openings of the Fallopian tubes. That part which lines the walls of the abdomen is termed the parietal peritoneum ; that w^hich is reflected on to the viscera is the visceral peritoneum. The disposition of the peritoneum may first be studied by noting its arrangement as made evident in transverse sections of the abdomen at certain levels. The first section to be described shows the peritoneum in its simplest condition. This is a transverse section through the body, at about the level of the upper surface of the fourth lumbar vertebra, and therefore about the site of the umbilicus (fig. 561). Starting on the inner surface of the anterior abdominal parietes, the990 THE OBGANS OF DIGESTION peritoneum is seen to cover the transversalis fascia, and indirectly the anterior abdominal muscles ; then, x^assing to the left, it lines the side of the abdomen, until it reaches the descending colon. This it covers, as a rule, in front and on the sides, though occasionally, as shown in the diagram (fig. 561), it forms a meso-colon. Then it passes over the bodies of the vertebrae with the large vessels upon them, and leaves the back of the abdomen to run forward to enclose the termination of the small intestine, returning again to the spine. The two layers thus form the mesentery, having between them the termmal branches of the superior mesenteric vessels. It then passes over the right half of the posterior abdominal wall, covering the ascending colon in front, and at the sides only, unless there be a meso-colon, and then passes on to the side and front of the abdomen to the point from which it was first traced. In tracing the peritoneum in a section of the body (fig. 562) opposite the stomach, at a level with the first lumbar vertebra, its course becomes more com- plicated and difficult to follow. In the section already given the peritoneum as a simple closed sac can be readily conceived ; but at the level now exposed the serous membrane has been so introverted that there appear to be two sacs, one leading from the other. The Fig. 562.—Transverse Section of the Abdomen at the Level of the Foramen OF WiNSLOW. GASTRO-HEPATIC OMENTUM lesser is indeed but a diverticulum or bulging from the greater, and the maimer of its formation is explained on page 1039. These two sacs are called the greater and the lesser sacs of the peritoneum. They communicate through a narrow strait or neck, the foramen of Wmslow. The lesser sac or cavity is discovered behind the stomach, so that on first opening the abdomen no trace of it is to be seen. It extends downwards between the layers of the great omentum (though this part of the lesser sac is always obliterated by adhesion in the adult). It extends upwards to the under surface of the liver, and is limited behind by the posterior abdominal wall; and below, behind the great omentum, by the transverse meso- colon. Its disposition on vertical section is shown in fig. 563. The foramen of Winslow is situated just below the hver ; it looks forwards and towards the right, and \dll readily admit one or two fingers. It is bounded above by the caudate lobe of the liver ; below, by the duodenum and hepatic vessels; behind, by the vena cava; and in front by the gastro-hepatic or lesser omentum, containing the structures passing to and from the liver. Starting at the foramen of ^Mnslow, the lesser sac will be found to turn to the left. If now the peritoneum be viewed in a transverse section of the body at theTHE PEBITONEUM 991 level named, viz. through the first lumbar vertebra, it will be found that the section lhas probably passed through the foramen of Winslow (fig. 562). Starting at the |front of the abdomen and going to the right, the peritoneum is seen to line [the anterior abdominal walls, to pass over the side of the abdomen, and to cover jfche front of the right kidney ; it then extends on to the vena cava, when it fbecomes a part of the lesser sac ; then along the back of the lesser sac, over the I aorta and pancreas, which separate it from the vertebral column ; next it reaches the anterior of the two internal surfaces of the spleen in front of the hilum. Here it meets with another layer of peritoneum, and helps to form the gastro-splenic Fig. 563.—Diagram to show the Peritoneum as seen in a Vertical Section. (Allen Thomson.) WINSLOW IE MESO-COLON omentum. Leaving the spleen, it changes its direction, and runs to the right to the stomach, forming the posterior layer of the gastro-splenic omentum ; it covers the posterior surface of the stomach, and leaves its upper border to form the posterior I layer of the gastro-hepatic omentum, and then passes upwards and to the right to the I liver. In this transverse section it is only seen passing on the right to the hepatic ! vessels, where it forms the posterior boundary of the foramen of Winslow. Here it bends sharply round and forms the anterior layer of the gastro-hepatic omentum ; and passing to the left reaches the stomach, which it covers in front. It then forms the anterior la3^er of the gastro-splenic omentum, and once more reaches the spleen, j It passes right round the spleen to the back of the hilum, w^here it is reflected on992 THE OBGANS OF DIGESTION to the left kidney (fig 502). From hence the peritoneum passes along the side and front of the abdomen to the point from which it started. In this section the liver is so divided as to appear separated from all connection with the other viscera and the abdominal wall, and to be snrromided by peritonemn. The com^se of the peritoneum in a longitudinal section of the hody will now be considered (fig. 563). Starting at the umbilicus, and passing downwards, the peri- toneum is seen to line the anterior abdominal wall. Before reaching the pelvis it covers also the urachus and obliterated hypogastric arteries, which can be seen to form ridges beneath it. On reaching the os pubis it is reflected on to the upper part of the bladder, covering it as far back as the base of the trigone ; from thence it is reflected on to the rectum, which it coaws in front and at the sides on its upper part. Between the bladder and rectum it forms the recto-vesical pouch. In the female the peritoneum is reflected from the bladder on to the uterus, which it covers; it then extends so far down in the pelvis as to pass over the upper part of the vagina behind; from thence it extends to the rectum. The fold between the vagina and rectum forms the recto-vaginal pouch, or pouch of Douglas. The membrane has now been traced back to the spine. Following it upwards, the sigmoid flexure will be found to be completely covered by peritoneum, a meso-colon attaching the gut to the abdominal wall. As seen in fig. 561, the ascending and descending colon in either loin are covered by peritoneum, as a rule, in front and on the sides. A little higher up in the median line the peritoneum passes forwards, to enclose the small intestine, and, returning to the spine, forms the mesentery (fig. 563). It now passes over the third part of the duodenum to the pancreas, from which point it again passes for- wards to form the lower layer of the transverse meso-colon. It invests the transverse colon below and partly in front, and then leaves it to pass downwards to take part in the great omentum. Running downwards some distance, it returns again and forms the anterior layer of the omentum. On reaching the stomach it goes over the anterior surface, and at the upper border forms the anterior layer of the lesser or gastro-hepatic omentum, which extends between the stomach and the liver. It invests the inferior surface of the liver in front of the transverse fissure, and, turning over its anterior border, covers the upper surface. At the posterior limit of the upper surface it leaves the liver and goes to the diaphragm, forming the superior layer of the coronary ligament. It covers the anterior part of the dome of the diaphragm, and, once more reaching the anterior abdominal wall, can be followed to the umbilicus, where it was first described. On reference to the dia- gram (fig. 563), the student might be led to suppose that the two sacs as above described are quite separate. This, of course, is not the case ; but in a longitudinal section of the body made anywhere to the left of the foramen of Winslow, it is impossible to show the direct connection between the two sacs. The peritoneum has only been traced in this longitudinal section so far as it concerns the greater sac. It now remains to follow upon the same section such part of the membrane as forms the lesser sac. The peritoneum here will be seen to cover the posterior surface of the stomach ; and from thence it runs upwards to; the liver, forming the posterior layer of the lesser or gastro-hepatic omentum. It j reaches the liver behind the transverse fissure. It covers only a part of its posterior surface, and is reflected on to the diaphragm, forming the lower layer of the coronary ligament. It now goes downwards over the hinder part of the dome of the diaphragm to the spine, separated from the latter by the great vessels. On reaching the pancreas it passes forwards, and forms the upper layer of the trans- verse meso-colon. It then covers the upper half of the transverse colon, and descending forms the innermost layer of the great omentum. It now ascends and, arriving at the greater curvature of the stomach, passes on to its posterior wall. At this point its description was commenced. From fig. 562 it will also be evident JTHE PEBITONEUM 993 ihat the peritoneum forming the lesser sac comes into contact with the spleen, terms one layer of the gastro-splenic omentum, and is in relation with the upper oart of the left kidney. The precise manner in which certain organs—such as the liver, the csecum, the duodenum, and the kidneys—are invested by peritoneum, is described in the account )f those viscera. To such accounts the reader is referred for a description of the nany ' ligaments ' (such as those of the bladder and liver) which are formed by the , Deritoneum. The great omentum.—It vv^ill be seen that the great omentum is formed of four layers of peritoneum, though this is quite impossible to demonstrate in an adult, ,he individual layers having become adherent. The great omentum acts as a sort of apron, protecting the intestines and )roviding them with a heat-economising covering of fat. It is nearly quadrilateral n shape, and is variable in extent. In fig. 564 the great omentum is shown to be connected with the greater curva- ure of the stomach on the one hand, and the transverse colon on the other. This s the arrangement described in the text. Under certain conditions (as shown in j Fig. 564.—Diagram to show the Peritoneum as seen in Vertical Section. (Allen Thomson.) GASTRO-HEI |.g. 563) the posterior layer of the great omentum returns to the posterior parietes, -nd is independent of the transverse meso-colon. This variation is explained in he account of the evolution of the peritoneum (page 1089). Mr. Lockwood has made some investigations on the lengths of the transverse i-ieso-colon and great omentum in thirty-three cases. In twenty under the age of orty-five, only one subject had a great omentum long enough to be drawn beyond he pubic spine ; in five, the omentum reached as far as the pubes. In the cases ;eyond forty-five years, it was the exception rather than the rule to find an mentum which could not be pulled beyond the lower limits of the abdomen. I The lesser or gastro-hepatic omentum consists of a double layer of peritoneum Extending between the lesser curvature of the stomach and the transverse fissure of he liver. If the two anterior layers of the great omentum are traced upwards, hey are seen to enclose the stomach, and then join together again at the lesser iurvature to form the lesser or gastro-hepatic omentum (fig. 563). It is connected hove with the transverse fissure of the liver, below with the upper curvature of the Itomach; the left extremity encloses the oesophagus; the right border contains 'he hepatic vessels, and is free and forms the anterior boundary of the foramen t^f Win slow. I 3 S994 THE OBGANS OF DIGESTION j The gastro-splenic omentum connects the left extremity of the stomach with | It the spleen, continuing the layers of peritonemn which enclose the stomach. ' 0 The gastro-phrenic and phreno-colic ligaments.—As the peritoneum passes I iil from the diaphragm to the stomach it forms a small fold just to the left of the 'J oesophagus. This is the gastro-phrenic ligament. A stout fold of the membrane I Itl also extends from the diaphragm (opposite the tenth and eleventh ribs) to the in splenic flexure of the colon, and is known as the phreno-colic or costo-colic ligament. : 0 Subperitoneal connective tissue.—An elaborate account of this tissue has been : written by Mr. Anderson and Mr. Makins. According to these observers, ' the i fn subperitoneal and subpleural fasciae are to be regarded as a portion of a wide i , system of mesoblastic connective tissue which surrounds the great vessels of the trunk, accompanying these branches from origin to termination, and extending ! i mainly in the form of perivascular sheaths to all parts of the body.' | ' The subperitoneal segment of the tissue they divide into two portions: a ' parietal layer, closely connected to the wall of the cavity, and visceral lamina which accompany the branches of the aorta to their distribution. The imrietal layer is developed chiefly in front of the vertebral column, ' from ■ which point it may be traced as a broad expansion between, and intimately connected with, the peritoneum on the one hand, and the transversalis, diaphragmatic, iliac, obturator, and recto-vesical fascia on the other.' It forms a sheath for the large m vessels, and is continuous with the vessels outside the abdomen. \ S The visceral j^ortioii follows the course of the branches of the aorta, and greatly assists in fixing certain viscera, such as the liver, pancreas, etc., becoming continuous with their connective tissue tunic. This tissue can be seen passing between the layers of peritoneum to those organs which are connected to the abdo- minal wall by duplicatures of peritoneum. For an account of the evolution of the peritoneum, and an explanation of its arrangement in the human body, the student is referred to page 1027. i u THE ABDOMEN i The abdomen properly consists of that part of the body cavity situated between ■ the diaphragm and the pelvis. It is bounded above by the diaphragm; below, H by the brim of the true pelvis ; behind, by the vertebral column, diaphragm, ■ quadratus lumborum and psoas muscles, and by the posterior portions of the ilia. H At the sides it is limited by the anterior parts of the ilia and the hinder segments H of the muscles which compose the anterior abdominal wall, viz. the transversalis, H internal oblique, and external oblique. In front, besides these muscles, there are jB^' the t^vo recti and pyramidales muscles. External to the peritoneum the abdomen W''''^' is lined by a special layer of fascia. The abdomen is the largest serous cavity in the body. Its serous membrane isBj^'l the peritoneum, which, through its various complicated arrangements, is always W% (with one unimportant exception) a closed sac, so that the viscera are in reality WrM situated outside the enclosure. The principal viscera found in the abdomen are those connected wuth digestion and the excretion of urine. jH^ffifii On freely laying open an abdomen from the front, the general form of the space B is seen to be an irregular hexagon, the sides of which are formed as follows—the H upper two by the margins of the costal cartilages with the ensiform cartilage M between ; the two lateral sides by the edges of the lateral boundary ; and the two H. lower by the t^vo ligaments of Poupart w^hich meet at the pubes. ''^^JB^THE ABDOMEN 995 In this irregular hexagon the following organs can be observed without dis- irranging their normal positi-on (fig. 565"). Above, on the right side under the 30stal cartilages, can be seen the liver, which extends from the right across the median line to a point below the left costal cartilages. Below the liver, and lying ;o the left side, can be seen the anterior surface of the stomach ; from the lower order of the stomach the omentum extends downwards, and shining through it can 36 seen the middle part of the transverse colon. On each side and below the Fig. 565.—The Viscera as seen on fully opening the Abdomen without Disarrangement of the Internal Parts. (After Sarazin.)

To the left of the stomach and under cover of the lower ribs of the left side he edge of the spleen may possibly be observed ; and just below the edge of the iver, and about the level of the tip of the ninth rib, the gall bladder may be seen, -he dome of the bladder may be noticed just behind the symphysis pubis and in he median line. The disposition of the viscera in the foetus is shown in fig. 578. 3 s 2996 THE OBGANS OF DIGESTION THE STOMACH General description.—The stomach is situated in the upper part of the abdo- minal cavity and to the left side. Above it are the liver and diaphragm, while below is the transverse colon. It is somew^hat pyriform in outline, with the small end of the figure twisted upward. Its length is about twelve inches, and its width four inches. It weighs four ounces and a half. There are tw^o orifices, two borders, and two surfaces to be noticed. The left, splenic, or cardiac end of the viscus is much expanded, and forms the great cul-de- sac or fundus. At the right or pyloric end there is another slighter expansion, called the antrum pylori or small cul-de-sac (fig. 566). The cardiac orifice, by which the oesophagus opens into the stomach, is situated about three inches from the left extremity, owing to the bulging to the left of the great cul-de-sac. The pyloric orifice, or pylorus, is situated to the extreme right, and is more anterior in position than the cardiac orifice. The pylorus is produced by a thickening of the intestinal w^alls between the Fig. 566.—Posterior Surface of the Stomach. cardiac orifice ANTRUM PYLORI duodenum and stomach. The circular muscular fibres which surround the stomachl are here thickened into a strong ring, thus forming a sphincter wdiich can be feltj from the outside. The longitudinal fibres pass over the circular fibres, and arenotj generally supposed to take part in the thickening. The mucous membrane is I pushed in by the muscular ring and also thickened. The pyloric opening will| about admit a sixpence. It is the narrowest part of the digestive canal. There I is no such special sphincter apparatus at the cardiac end of the stomach, the oesophagus passing directly into its walls, becoming wider as it does so. The two borders are situated above and below, and run between the .twoi orifices. The upper is knowm as the lesser curvature, and is about three or four j inches long ; it is concave along its whole length, except near the pylorus, w^here it j takes part in the antrum pylori (fig. 567). The lower border is called the greater curvature, and is convex except near the right extremity just before the formation of the antrum pylori, where there is a slight depression. The two surfaces lie between the two borders. They are of equal extent, and are named the anterior and posterior surfaces.THE STOMACH 997 I Relations to surrounding parts.—The degree of obliquity of the stomach in its relation to the long axis of the body has been a disputed point, the majority of luthorities holding that it lies slightly obliquely from left to right; while a few Luschka and Lesshaft) maintain that its direction is vertical. In an early period )f development the organ is certainly vertical, and in rare instances this position nay be maintained throughout life. As a rule, however, the organ is placed 3bliquely, and lies in the left hypochondriac and epigastric regions (figs. 578, 582, md 583). The cardiac end, or fundus, reaches as high as the level of the sixth chondro- ^ternal articulation, being a little above and behind the heart apex. The cardiac orifice is opposite the seventh left costal cartilage, and is about one inch from the jternum. Behind, it is about on the level of the ninth thoracic spine. The i^ylorus s on a lower level and nearer the surface than the cardiac end, and is opposite a Doint to the right of the middle line two to three inches below the sterno-xiphoid irticulation, on the level of a line drawn between the bony ends of the seventh nbs (fig. 582). Behind, it is on a level with the twelfth thoracic spine (fig. 583).

The anterior surface looks upwards and forwards. Its relations are of import- ance in connection with the operation of gastrostomy. A certain portion of thisTHE OBGANS OF DIGESTION 998 surface comes into immediate contact with the abdominal wall; this portion is triangular in shape, is bounded on the right by the edge of the liver, and on the left by the cartilages of the eighth and ninth ribs; and below by a horizontal line passing between the tips of the tenth costal cartilages (fig. 582). Besides the abdominal wall, this surface is covered by the diaphragm and the under surface of the liver (fig. 590). ! Relations to the peritoneum.—The stomach is covered by peritoneum in its whole | extent, except immediately along the curvatures and upon a small triangular space at the back of the cardiac orifice. It is enclosed between two layers. These two layers at its upper border or lesser curvature come together to form the lesser omentum, and at the lower border or greater curvature extend downwards, to form' the great omentum (figs. 562, 563). At the left of the oesophagus the two layers j pass to the diaphragm, forming the gastro-phrenic ligament; and at the fundus they pass on to the spleen, forming the gastro-splenic omentum. Fig. 568.—^Muscular Coat of the Stomach. (Luschka.) Alteration of position.—As the stomach becomes distended it undergoes some alteration in position. The greater curvature is elevated and carried forwards, the anterior surface is directed upwards, and the posterior downwards, and the pylorus passes some inches to the right. This rotation about its long axis is influenced by the fixity of the lesser curvature of the organ. Structure.—The walls of the stomach consist of four coats—serous, muscular, submucous, and mucous. The external serous coat is formed by the peritoneum, and has to the naked eye the usual shiny appearance of that membrane. The muscular coat consists of three layers :— A longitudinal layer externally, which is continued from similar fibres on the oesophagus, and is thickest along the curvatures, more particularly the lesser. At the pylorus the fibres are more regularly placed round that orifice (fig. 568). A circular layer, which regularly surrounds the whole stomach, and becomes much thicker at the pyloric end where it forms the sphincter. These circular fibres are arranged perpendicularly to the long axis of the stomach (fig. 569). An oblique layer, continuous with the circular fibres of the oesophagus. They999 THE STOMACH lass to the left of the oesophagus towards the great curvature. They unite finally 7ith the circular fibres (fig. 569). [ The submucous coat is made up of areolar tissue, in which the blood-vessels )reak up. The mucous or mternal coat is pink in colour and soft to the touch, and when he stomach is not distended has a rugose appearance. It is covered with columnar ipithelium, and with a lens shows the openings of numerous glands. A thin layer of muscular tissue—the muscttlaris 77mcos63—supports the mucous membrane ixternally. i Nerves.—The nerves of the stomach are the right and left pneumogastric, the right nerve passing over the posterior surface, and the left over the anterior, the organ is also connected with the sympathetic system by means of the solar plexus. Fig. 569.—Muscular Coat of the Stomach. (Luschka.) OBLIQUE LAYER CIRCULAR LAYER Blood-supply.—The stomach receives its blood-supply from many branches. From the coeliac axis there is the gastric artery, which runs along the lesser curve from left to right, anastomosing with the pyloric branch of the hepatic. Along the greater curve run the right and left gastro-epiploic arteries anastomosing at the middle of the border, the left being a branch of the splenic, the right a branch of the hepatic through the gastro-duodenal artery. The stomach also receives branches from the splenic (vasa brevia) at the fundus. The blood of the stomach is returned into the portal vein. The coronary vein and pyloric vein open separately into the portal vein ; the right gastro-epiploic vein opens into the superior mesenteric, the left into the splenic. Lymphatics.—There is a set of glands lying along the greater and the lesser curvatures, and others at the pyloric and cardiac ends. These are entered by lymphatic vessels beginning in the mucous membrane.loco THE OBGANS OF DIGESTION and pancreatic duct enter (figs. 571, 586, and 587). THE INTESIINES THE SMALL INTESTINE The small intestine is that part of the intestinal canal which lies between the pylorus and the ileo-caecal valve. It is conveniently divided into three portions: the duodenum, jejunum, and ileum. It is of the average length in the adult male (between the ages of twenty and fifty) of twenty-two feet six inches. In the female it is longer, the average length being twenty-three feet four inches. The length is independent, in the adult at least, of age, height, or weight. The length may vary in the male from thirty-one feet ten inches to fifteen feet six inches. In the female, from twenty-nine feet four inches to nineteen feet ten inches. With the exception of the duodenum, the small intestine lies for the most part inside the more fixed portions of the large intestine (figs. 565, 578). It is also, with the exception of the duodenum, connected to the posterior abdominal wall by a pro- cess of peritoneum, the mesentery. This broad membrane is seen to extend from above downwards, and from left to right from the end of the duodenum above to the ileo-caecal valve below, enclosing the jejunum and ileum along the whole of their extent (figs. 561, 563, and 599). The duodenum—the first portion of the small intestine—is, unlike the other parts of that bowel, very definite in position and extent. It is that part which is not contained by the mesentery. It is formed from the end of the embryonic fore-gut, and its peculiar position behind the transverse colon is due to the rotation from left to right of the intestine in the foetus (page 1032). It is the most fixed as well as the widest part of the small intestine. It measures one and a half to two inches in diameter, and is about ten inches long. It has been compared in general shape to a horseshoe, though not very aptly, as the one side is so much longer than the other. It is arranged in a curved manner round the pancreas, and readily lends itself to a division into four parts (fig. 577). The first part—the superior, or ascending—is hardly two inches long. Begin- ning at the pylorus, and passing upwards and backwards to the right, it ends at the neck of the gall-bladder. It is the most movable of the four portions. It is covered by the two layers of peritoneum which are continued from the stomach, and by these it is completely surrounded. Above it are found the liver (quadrate lobe) and gall bladder. The . gut itself forms the lower boundary of the foramen of Winslow. Below it is the pancreas; and behind are the common bile-duct and hepatic vessels. The second part—the descending portion—not quite three inches long, extends from the neck of the gall bladder to the second or third lumbar vertebra, a short bend marking the separation between the first and second parts. This part is covered by peritoneum in front only, the membrane being derived from a continuation of the superior layer of the transverse meso-colon (fig. 570). It is more fixed than the first portion. It is in relation in front with the transverse colon and meso-colon. On its left side is the pancreas (fig. 577), and the common bile-duct a little more posteriorly. The loop formed by the pancreatico- duodenal arteries runs also along the left margin of this part of the bowel. Behind lie the right kidney and the renal vessels and vena cava (fig. 590). Some of the muscular fibres of this part of the duodenum are said to be con- tinuous with the lobules of the pancreas. Into this segment of the bowel, at its inner and back part and some four inches from the pylorus the common bile-ductTHE SMALL INTESTINE 1001 The third part, or transverse portion, is the longest, being about five inches eng. It extends from the body of the second or third hmibar vertebra on the light side, and passes obliquely across the spine to the upper part of the left side, liscending a little on its way. In front of the third part of the duodenum is found ;he lower layer of the transverse meso-colon. The superior mesenteric vessels cross Fig. 570.—The Duodenum from in front, superior layer of transverse meso-colon ihis part of the bowel, running between it and the pancreas to reach the mesentery fig. 570). Along the upper border runs the inferior pancreatico-duodenal artery. Che gut is in relation above with the pancreas and superior mesenteric artery. Behind are the vena cava, aorta, and crura of the diaphragm (figs. 571, 577). It is FiCt. 571.—The Duodenum from behind. Porial vein HEAD OF PANCREAS he most fixed portion of the duodenum, and is covered in front only by peritoneum. The fotcrth part of the duodenum, or second ascending portion, ascends vertically )y the left side of the spine. This vertical portion—which is covered entirely in rent and partly at the sides by peritoneum—is at least an inch in length (figs. 570, •71, and 572). The end of the duodenum is very firmly fixed in its place by theTHE OBGANS OF DIGESTION 1002 fimscuhts susj^tensoriiis duocleni. This name has been given to a fibrous band that contains, according to Treitz, some plain muscular fibres, and that descends to th( vertical part of the duodenum from the left crus of the diaphragm and the tissuei about the coeliac axis. Mr. Lockwood points out that this band is continued on, after being insertec into the duodenum, between the layers of the mesentery. He suggests the naiiK of the ' suspensory muscle of the duodenum and mesentery,' and says, ' togethe; with the other constituents of the root of the mesentery, it forms a band of con siderable strength, sufficient not only to support the weight of the intestines am mesentery, but also to resist the pressure of the descent of the diaphragm.' I In connection with the termination of the duodenum may be mentioned thj fossa duodeno-jejunalis. It is formed as a pouch behind a fold of peritoneum. Thi i fold runs from the parietal peritoneum, just to the left of the terminal orfourtlj part of the duodenum, and is attached in a vertical line to the anterior surface c i this portion of the bowel. It is of interest as being the seat of origin of a retro i peritoneal hernia. The fold forming the fossa is the remains of the ' duodenal fold,' modified b ■ Fig. 572.—The Fossa Duodeno-jejunalis. (Treves.) THE FOSSA THE DUODENAL FOLD Inferior ineaeuteric vein growth and displaced by the process of unequal development in the intestini j canal (page 1040, and figs. 605, 606). The pocket, or fossa, is of triangul{| outline, with the base or orifice upwards. Its apex extends below the last ber;j of the duodenum (fig. 572). The capacity of the fossa varies. In well-markel specimens it will lodge the thumb up to the first joint. It is actually occupif j by the duodeno-jejunal junction or bend. Out of one hundred bodies examined \ found this fossa in forty-eight examples. -\ Jejunum and ileum.—There is no unvarying method in the arrangement of tl \ individual coils of the small intestine. . In the majority of adult bodies the small intestine is disposed in an irregular i curved manner from left to right. The gut, starting from the duodenum, will fir j occupy the contiguous parts of the left side of the epigastric and umbilical regions | the coils then fill some part of the left hypochondriac and lumbar regions ; th( | now commonly descend into the pelvis, reappearing in the left iliac quarter, ar j then occupy, in order, the hypogastric, lower umbilical, right lumbar, and rig]! iliac regions. Before reaching the last situation they commonly descend aga: j into the pelvis. i I1003 THE SMALL INTESTINE I In many instances no kind of methodical arrangement is apparent. The j coils of small intestine most usually found in the pelvis belong to the terminal part i of the ileum, and to that part of the intestine that has the longest mesentery— the part, namely, that extends between two points, respectively six and eleven feet from the end of the duodenum. In five out of one hundred cases examined, the coils were arranged in an exactly reverse manner to that just described. The jejunum (jejunus, empty).—The jejunum is the name given to the upper two-fifths of the small intestine below the duodenum. i The term ileum (dX^iv to twist) is applied to the last three-fifths of the bowel. The ileum ends at the ileo-caecal valve. The coils formed by the jejunum and ileum are very movable, are completely invested by peritoneum, and are supported and attached to the posterior parietes by the extensive membrane known as the I mesentery. The intestine alters gradually in character from above downwards. If a segment from the middle of the jejunum be compared with a portion of the middle ileum, the following differences would be noted. The diameter of the jejunum is about an inch and a half, that of the ileum one and a quarter. The jejunum has thicker walls, is more vascular, and is provided with a more complex mucous membrane. I Meckel's diverticulum—From one to three feet from the end of the ileum is sometimes seen a diverticulum, or blind tube or cord, coming off from the free margin of the bowel. This is Meckel's diverticulum, and represents the remains of jthe vitello-intestinal duct (page 1030). I The mesentery.—The mesentery extends from the end of the duodenum to the ileo-c^cal junction. It envelopes and supports the ileum and jejunum. Its upper j or right layer is continuous with the under layer of the transverse meso-colon and with the peritoneum that invests the ascending colon. Its lower or left layer joins with the serous membrane that encloses the descending colon and that forms the sigmoid mesentery (fig. 561). [ The point at which the mesentery is attached above is on a level with the lower [border of the pancreas and just to the left of the vertebral bodies. From this point the insertion of the mesentery follows an oblique line that runs downwards and to the right, crossing the great vessels, and ending in some part of the iliac ifossa (fig. 599). In the absence of an ascending meso-colon (the normal condition) the peritoneum that covers the cfecum is reflected from the hinder surface of that part of the bowel on to the posterior parietes ; at this reflexion the mesentery ends. If an ascending meso-colon exists, the mesentery terminates by joining it. jThe parietal attachment of the mesentery measures, as a rule, about six inches [(fig. 599). The length of the mesentery from the spine to the intestine varies in different parts of the canal; its average length may be taken as between eight and nine inches. It soon attains its full length, and within one foot of the end of the duodenum is already six inches in length. The ordinary type of mesentery conforms to the figure of half a circle, but the membrane is liable to considerable variation. It is not uncommon to find the mesentery maintaining a considerable length up nearly to the end of the ileum. Structure of the small intestine.—Its coats are four in number, viz. serous, muscular, areolar, and mucous. The intestine receives its serous covering from J the peritoneum, and, with the exception of certain parts of the duodenum which have been described, it is covered entirely by it, save only where the layers leave it behind to form the mesentery. The line of attachment of the mesentery marks the attached border of the small intestine. The muscular coat is divided into an external longitudinal layer and an internal circular, the circular being the thicker of the two. Both layers are uniform around the bowel.THE OBGAXS OF DIGESTION 1004 The areolar ot suhimcons coat consists of areolar tissue connecting the imisciila- and mncons tunics. A thin layer of muscular tissue separates the mucous membraiit from the areolar coat (muscularis mucosae). The mucous coat, thicker at the upper part than the lower part, is linet throughout with columnar epithelium and is very vascular. The whole surface i: covered with minute processes called villi; these give the membrane a fineb flocculent appearance, which has been compared to the pile of velvet. They ar. largest and most numerous in the duodenum and jejunum, and become gradualbj shorter, smaller, and fewer on the ileum. Besides the villi are certain large fold' or valvular flaps : these are the valvules conniventes. They are permanent ores centic folds of mucous membrane set transversely to the long axis of the intestine which extend from one half to two-thirds of the distance round the lumen (fig. 573)| The largest are more than two inches long, and about one-third of an inch widej They do not exist at the beginning of the duodenum. They are very larg.j just below the entrance of the bile duct, and remain conspicuous until the middl-lj of the jejunum is reached, They then become smaller, and gradually disappeaij at the lower part of the ileum. i Fig. 573.—Portion of the Small Intestine, laid open to show the Valvule Conniventes. (Brinton.) Scattered over the whole of the mucous membrane of the small intestine arti numerous minute soft rounded bodies. These are the so-called solitary glands, j Certain patches, called Peyer's yatclies, are found in the lower ileum. The^' are oval, are from one half to three inches in length, and about one inch iii breadth, and are placed on the long axis of the bowel along a lin.e most remote j from the mesentery. They are made up of an aggregation of solitary glands. ! A number of closely set tubular glands, called Brumiefs glands, maybe exposecl by dissection in the first part of the duodenum. I Blood-supply of the small intestine.—The small intestine receives its bloo(i from the superior mesenteric artery, and a branch coming indirectly from th(; hepatic, the superior pancreatico-duodenal. The superior mesenteric runs betweeil the layers of the mesentery, and gives off about twelve or fifteen branches, running; downwards and to the left (vasa intestini tenuis), which break up and form a serieij of arches, finally encircling the intestine as small branches. It also gives off 'c\ small branch at the beginning, the inferior pancreatico-duodenal, which, with th(j superior pancreatico-duodenal, forms an arch, which lies in the concavity of th(| duodenum and supplies it. The blood is returned by means of the superio]! mesenteric vein, which with the splenic vein forms the portal (fig. 574). |THE SMALL INTESTINE 1005 The lymphatics form a continuous series, which is divided into two sets—viz. hat of the mucous membrane, and that of the muscular coat. The lymph vessels ,f both sets form a copious plexus, and end in the mesenteric lacteals (fig. 574). ^ The nerves.—The small intestine is supphed by means of the superior Fig. 574.—Vessels of the Small Intestine. LACTEALS Veins mesenteric plexus, which is continuous with the lower part of the solar plexus. The branches follow the blood-vessels, and finally form tw^o plexuses : one (Auer- bach's) which lies between the muscular coats; and another (Meissner's) in the submucous coat. THE LAEGE INTESTINE The large intestine is that part of the alimentary canal which extends between the ileum and the anus. It is divided into the following parts :—Cfficum, ascending, transverse, and descending colon, sigmoid flexure, and rectum. It is so arranged las to surround the small intestine, making a circuit round the abdominal cavity from right to left (fig. 565). The cacum lies in the right iliac fossa ; thence the colon passes vertically upwards on the right side {ascending colon) until the liver is reached. Here it forms a more or less rectangular bend (hepatic flexure), and then passes transversely across the belly {transverse colon) below the stomach. It then reaches the splenic area, where it makes a second sharp bend (splenic flexure), 'and, passing vertically downwards on the left side {descending colon), reaches the left iliac fossa. At this point it forms the loop of the sigmoid flexure, and finally passes through the pelvis as the rectum (fig. 577). It is much larger in diameter than the small intestine, and has not the same general convoluted arrangement. Leaving out of consideration the dilated portion of the rectum, it is wider at the beginning than at the end. It varies in width at different parts,_from two and a haK to one and a quarter inches. The length from the root of the appendix or tip of the cfficum to the point where the meso-rectum ends is, in the male, about four feet eight inches ; and in the female, about four feet six inches. The extremes found in a number of cases ^yere, for both sexes respectively, six feet six inches, and three feet three inches. The large intestine, in all parts except the rectum, has a peculiar arrangement of its walls, which gives it a very different appearance to the small intestine. It I,I THE OBGANS OF DIGESTION 1006 is sacculated, and the sacculation is produced by the gut having to adapt its lengtl to three shorter muscular bands which run the course of the intestine. Thes bands are really the longitudinal fibres of the muscular Avail, which are chief! collected at three parts (fig. 575). One band is sitwa^ted jjosteriorly on the attachet border, another runs anteriorly, and the third is situated on the inner side of th ascending and descending colon, and on the lower border of the transverse coIoe All these bands start at the vermiform appendix, and are lost on the rectum Along the whole length of the large intestine, except the loAver part of the rectum are certain small appendages (ajjj^endiccs einploiccB), seen mostly along the line o the inner muscular band. They are pouches of peritoneum containing fat. The csecum, or caput coli.—The caecum is a cul-cle-sac forming the first part c the large intestine. It is defined as that part of the colon which is situated beloT the entrance of the ileum. Its breadth is about three inches, and its length aboii two and a half inches. It lies in the right iliac fossa, and is usually situated upon the psoas muscle and so placed that its apex or lowest point is just projecting beyond the inner horde j of that muscle (figs. 565, 577). It is entirely enveloped in peritoneum, and i free in the abdominal cavity. The apex of the caecum usually corresponds with point a little to the inner side of the middle of Poupart's ligament. Less frequentlj Fig. 575.—The Four Types of C^cum. (Treves.) ABC D the caecum will be found to be in relation with the iliacus muscle only ; or the buh; of the caput will lie upon that muscle, while the apex rests upon the psoas. In fi number of cases the caecum is entirely clear of both psoas and iliacus muscles, ano hangs over the pelvic brim, or is lodged entirely within the pelvic cavity. Som( part of the caecum may pass even to the left of the median line of the body. This part of the colon is liable to considerable variation. , Its variations may be described under/o2ir %jjes :— 1. The foetal type is conical in shape, the appendix arising from the apex This process is a continuation of the long axis of the colon. The three musculai bands w^hich meet at the appendix are nearly at equal distances apart (fig. 575, a). 2. The second form is more quadrilateral in shape than the last; the thret bands retain their relative positions; the appendix appears betAveen two bulging sacculi, instead of at the summit of a cone (fig. 575, b). 3. In the third type, that part of the caput coli that lies to the right side of thf j anterior band groAvs out of proportion to that part to the left of the band. Th( anterior Avail becomes more deA-eloped than the posterior, so that the apex is turnet so much to the left and posteriorly, that it nearly meets the ileo-caecal junction J A false apex is formed by the highly developed part to the right of the anterioi band. This is the usual caecum found (fig. 575, c). 4. In the fourth type, the deA^elopment of the part to the right of the anterioiTHE LABGE INTESTINE 1007 I )and is excessive, while the segment to the left of the band has atrophied. In this orm the anterior band rims to the inferior angle of junction of the ilemii with the 3fecum. The root of the appendix is posterior to that angle. There is no trace of ijhe original apex, and the appendix appears to spring almost from the ileo-cfecal 'unction (fig. 575, d). Other variations.—The ca?cnm may vary in its general development. It is isometimes small and insignificant, in other cases it reaches a large size. It may be so rotated that the ilemii passes behind the colon and opens on the right side. The posterior part has been seen much more developed than the anterior, so that the ileum has entered from the front, and the appendix has come off from the interior wall. The caecum may remain undescended, and be found just under the liver or in the vicinity of the umbilicus. The caecum and colon may be suspended by a mesentery common to the whole intestinal canal. In such cases the primitive i condition of the peritoneal fold which supports the small and large intestine is ■■ permanently retained (page 1034). The vermiform appendix.—Attached to what is really the original apex of the cfficum is a narrow blind tube : this is the vermiform appendix. It usually comes joff close to the ileo-c^cal valve on the inner and posterior side of the bowel, though 'occasionally it forms the true apex of the csecum. In the adult the average length is four inches, the extremes being one inch and six inches. In the majority of instances the appendix is much twisted upon itself. Its usual position is behind the end of the ileum and its mesentery, and pointing in the direction of the spleen. It may occasionally ascend vertically behind the caecum. It has a definite mesentery, which comes off from the left layer of the mesentery of the ileum. Its origin from this layer is along a straight line which is situated at a short distance from the intestine, and which is not quite parallel with the I margin of the bowel. In general outline the mesentery is triangular. In the adult it does not extend along the whole length of the tube. It is, in fact, too short for the appendix, and it is this that accounts for the twisted condition of the llittle process. Along the free margin of the mesentery runs a branch of the ileo- colic artery. Ileo-caecal fossa.—About the caecum, and especially in the vicinity of the ileo- jCascal junction, are certain fossae collectively known as the ileo-csecal. Two only appear to be fairly constant. The first, the suioerior ileo-ccecal, is formed by the passage across the junction of the caecum and ileum of a branch of the ileo-colic artery, which produces a fold of peritoneum limiting a pouch. It is on the anterior ^ aspect of the bowel, and the pouch opens downwards. I' The second fossa is not quite so simple. If the caecum be turned upwards so i as to expose its posterior surface as it lies in situ, and if the appendix be drawn down ' (SO as to put its mesentery on the stretch, a peculiar fold will be found to join that mesentery. This fold arises from that border of the ileum which is most remote from the insertion of its mesentery. It then passes over the ileo-c^ecal junction on jits inferior aspect, is adherent to the caecum, and finally joins the surface of the . mesentery of the appendix. This fold is peculiar in the absence of any visible vessels. Between it and the appendix there is an almost constant fossa, the inferior ileo-ccecal. It is large, admitting two fingers. It opens outwards, and is bounded on one side by the small intestine, and on the other by the caecum. The ileo-csecal valve.—The ileo-caecal valve, which is situated at the entrance of the ileum into the large intestine at the upper border of the csecum, is found on the inner side and towards the posterior aspect of the intestine. The ileum passes from below upwards and towards the right, and terminates with a considerable degree of obliquity. The valve is formed by two semilunar folds projecting into j the large intestine, set nearly transversely, the lower being a little oblique. The j opening between them takes the form of a narrow slit, rounded in front but narrow1008 THE OBGANS OF DIGESTION behind. At the ends of the sHt the valves unite and are prolonged at either end a a ridge partially surrounding the intestine (fraena). Villi cover that surface of th folds looking towards the ileum. The surface towards the large intestine is fre from villi. In the formation of this valve the longitudinal muscular fibres pas across from the ileum to the large intestine without dipping down between the twi layers of each fold. The circular muscular fibres, on the other hand, are containeij between the layer of the mucous membrane and submucous tissue which form theirj The colon.—In the adult the ascending and the descending parts of the colon arl placed vertically, while the direction of the transverse colon is practically horizontal The average length in the adult of the ascending colon (as measured from the ti of the caecum to the hepatic flexure) is eight inches, and of the descending coloi (as measured from the splenic bend to the commencement of the sigmoid loop) i! eight and a half inches. The descending colon is the part of the large bowel thai is least liable to variation. It is the only part of the gut except the duodenum tha| retains its original position as a portion of the great primary vertical loop. Th' Fig. 576.—Section of the Ascending Colon. (x\llen Thomson.) Creseentie ridge of mucous membrane wMeli divides the saceuli Longitudinal muscle Inner band Circvilar muscle transverse colon, on the other hand, is liable to considerable variation in lengt position, and arrangement. Its average length is twenty inches in the adult. I has been found to vary in adults from twelve to thirty-three inches. The ascending colon.—The ascending colon extends from the cascum to th inferior surface of the liver close to the gall bladder, forming there the hepatic flexur It is covered by peritoneum in front and at the side, but in a certain proportion o, cases (twenty-six percent in one hundred dissections) this part of the large intestinij is connected with the posterior wall of the abdomen by a meso-colon, that is to say| it is quite surrounded by peritoneum. Connected with the ascending colon ir sometimes found a fold of peritoneum, extending from the right side of the gut t( the parietes at a little above the level of the highest part of the iliac crest. I forms a shelf upon which rests the extreme right margin of the liver. It might b(] called the sustentaculum hepatis. The ascending colon is in relation behind with the right kidney, second portior of the duodenum, and quadratus lumborum. In front are some of the coils of the ileum (fig. 577).THE COLON lOOD The transverse colon.—The transverse colon, smaller m diameter than the !ascending, extends from the imder sm^face of the liver to the spleen. Being [longer than a straight line between these two points, it has to describe an arch , [with its convexity forwards ; it also bends a little downwards. It crosses through the umbilical region from the right hypochondrium to the left hypochondrium (fig. 565). In the majority of cases the superficial part of the colic arch—as seen before J [the viscera are disturbed—is either in whole or in greater part above a straight line drawn transversely across the body between the highest points of the iliac crest, i [In the proportion of one to four it lies, in whole or in greater part, below this line f%. 582). Certain remarkable bends are sometimes formed by this part of the bowel. [The bending is always in the same direction, namely, downwards, and is usually jj jibrupt and angular. The apex of the V or U-shaped bend thus formed may f |reach the pubes. This bend appears to be due to two distinct causes: namely,. long continued distension on the one hand, and to congenital malformation on the 3ther. , The transverse colon is in relation above with the liver and gall bladder, :he stomach, and at its left extremity with the spleen. The third portion of the luodenum passes behind it. Below are the coils of the small intestine. It is RUTOunded with peritoneum, being connected with the posterior abdominal wall by li meso-colon. The descending colon extends from the spleen to the sigmoid flexure. It m nore movable than the ascending colon. It is also narrower. At its beginning t is connected with the diaphragm, at a level with the tenth and eleventh ribs, by a 'old of peritoneum, the costo-colic ligament (or sustentaculum lienis, from the fact hat it supports the spleen). The bend between the transverse colon and descending jolon is called the splenic flexure. The descending colon is situated in the left lypochondriac and lumbar regions (fig. 591). Its relations to the peritoneum are he same as obtain with the ascending colon, that is, it is covered in front and on he sides. A meso-colon is met with oftener on this side than on the right. In )ne hundred dissections it was found thirty-six times. The descending colon is jiovered in front by the small intestine ; behind, are part of the diaphragm, the left ddney, and the quadratus lumborum muscle (fig. 577). The sigmoid flexure and rectum.—The segment of gut termed the sigmoid lexure, and the so-called first part of the rectum, form together a single simple oop that cannot be divided into parts. This loop begins where the descending olon ends, viz. in the left iliac fossa, and ends at the commencement of the o-called second piece of the rectum—at the spot, where the meso-rectum ceases, opposite about the third piece of the sacrum in the median line. The loop when infolded describes a figure that may be compared to the capital omega. The iverage length of this sigmoid or omega loop is seventeen inches and a half. The lormal position of the loop is not in the left iliac fossa, but wholly in the pelvis, 'he most common disposition of it may be now described. I The descending colon ends just at the outer border of the psoas. The gut here [iiddenly changes its direction, and the sigmoid or omega loop begins (figs. 565, 77). The bowel crosses the muscle at right angles and about midway between the im^bo-sacral eminence and Poupart's ligament. It now descends vertically along- he left pelvic wall, and may at once reach the pelvic floor. It then passes more (r less horizontally and transversely across the pelvis from left to right, and [ommonly comes into contact with the right pelvic wall. At this point it is •ent upon itself, and, passing once more towards the left, reaches the middle line nd descends to the anus. It will lie therefore in more or less direct contact i^th the bladder and uterus, and may possibly touch the caecum. It is very closely1010 THE OBGANS OF DIGESTION related with the coils of small gut that occupy the pelvis, and by these coils th loop is usually hidden. The sigmoid or omega loop is attached to the abdominal and pelvic wall by meso-colon, so that it is quite surrounded by peritoneum. The line of attachmer of this meso-colon is as follows. It crosses the p;5oas at a right angle, and the takes a slight curve upwards so as to pass over the iliac vessels at or about thei Fig. 577.—View of the Deeper ABuoriiNAL Viscera. (Eiidinger.) Superior vena cava- THORACIC DUCT- hiferior vena cava- PANCREAS- KIDNEY- ASCENDING COLON bifurcation. The curve ends at a point either just to the inner side of the psoa muscle, or between the psoas and the middle line, or, as is most frequently the castj just over the bifurcation of the vessels. From this point the line of attachmeDj proceeds vertically down, taking at first a slight curve to the right. Its course i to the left of the middle line, while its ending will be upon that line, about th third piece of the sacrum. The sigmoid meso-colon measures from one and ; quarter to three and a half inches in width—i.e. from the parietes to the bowel.1011 THE BEGTUM AND ANUS When a descending meso-colon exists it joins that of the loop, and the line of attachment is then, as a rule, directed obliquely across the psoas and the lower end of the kidney, while beyond the pelvic brim the attachment is as above described. There is often no meso-colon over the psoas, the gut being adherent to that muscle. In connection with the sigmoid meso-colon is often found a fossa or pouch of peritoneum, known as the inter sigmoid fossa. The pouch is formed by the layers of the meso-colon, and is produced by the sigmoid artery. It is generally found over the bifurcation of the iliac vessels. The pouch is funnel-shaped, and the opening looks downwards and to the left. The fossa varies in depth from one to lone and a half inch, and is the seat of the sigmoid hernia. I The rectum.—The rectum has been described as divided into three portions. 'Such division is quite arbitrary, and is inconvenient. What is usually described as the first portion has, in the account just given, been included with the sigmoid jflexure. The two remaining portions of the intestine extend from the middle of the third piece of the sacrum to the anus. It would be well if the term rectum were to be limited to that part of the Ibowel which is below the level of the third segment of the sacrum, and which is -ree of any meso-colon. This portion of bowel—the rectum proper—may be livided into two portions. The first portion extends from the third piece of the l?acrum to the tip of the coccyx. I This portion, about three and a half inches long, is only covered by peritoneum ibove, and then only over the anterior surface. Behind, it is in relation with the jjacrum and coccyx. In front it is in relation with the trigone of the bladder, the l/esiculae seminales, and under surface of the prostate. In the female the anterior kirface is in relation with the vagina and the cervix uteri. The peritoneum is reflected from the rectum to the bladder in the male, and he vagina in the female (recto-vesical or recto-vaginal pouch). This pouch ixtends in the male to within about three inches of the anus. On the posterior surface of the gut there is no peritoneum below a point five inches from the anus. ' The second portion (or what used to be called the third portion) extends from he tip of the coccyx to the anus ; it is about an inch and a half long. It differs irom the first portion in the direction of its curve : while that follows the curve of I he sacrum and coccyx, this portion turns backwards and downwards. It is not ■onnected with the peritoneum. It is surrounded, after leaving the prostate, by the nternal sphincter, while the levator ani is attached to its side. At its end the jxternal sphincter is situated; in front is the triangular ligament of the perinaeum. bst above the anus the rectum is much dilated. The anus.—The anus is the aperture by which the intestine opens externally. )uring life it is contracted by the sphincters, so as to give the skin around a vrinkled appearance. Bound the lower part of the rectum and anus certain iiuscles that are connected with its proper function are situated. They are the nternal sphincter, the levator ani, and the external sphincter. The levator ani and xternal sphincter will be found described in another part. The internal sphincter is a thickening of the circular fibres of the intestine, jituated round the rectum about an inch above the anus, and extending over half In inch of the intestine. It forms a complete muscular ring. It is two lines thick, j-nd is paler than the external sphincter. ! The rectum differs from the rest of the colon in presenting perfectly smooth [i^alls marked by no sacculi, by no longitudinal muscular bands, and by no appen- j ices. The mucous membrane of the rectum is thicker than that of the rest of the irge intestine. Certain folds, chiefly longitudinal in direction, are seen in the lax tate of the tube which disappear when distended. Houston has described three 3 T 2THE OBGANS OF DIGESTION 1012 oblique semilunar folds, which project into the lumen of the tube : one in front b the prostate, and two others higher up; one from the left side, and one on th right, the highest. Structure of the large intestine.—There are four coats : a serous, muscula| submucous, and mucous. j The serous is derived from the peritoneum, and is more or less complete. j The appendices epiploic?e in connection with this layer have been mentione! (%-576). I The muscular cooA is divided into circular and longitudinal layers, the longj tudinal being external. The arrangement of the longitudinal fibres has bee| described in as far as they make up the three longitudinal bands (fig. 576). Onli a small amount of longitudinal fibres are found between the bands, except on thj vermiform appendix and lower part of the sigmoid flexure, where they are arrange! all round. ! The circular fibres form a thin layer, and are mostly collected in the intervji between the sacculi. , The mucous membrane, separated from the muscular layer by the suhmucoiu layer, has no villi, and no valvule© conniventes. Blood-vessels.—The large intestine is supplied with blood by the branches of thj superior mesenteric and inferior mesenteric arteries, while it also receives a blooc supply from the internal iliac at the rectum. The vessels form a continuous seriti of arches from the caecum, where the vasa intestini tenuis anastomose with thj ileo-colica, the first branch of the superior mesenteric given to the large intestine. The blood-supply of the rectum is from the inferior mesenteric by the superic hsemorrhoidal, from the internal iliac by the middle haemorrhoidal, and from th internal pudic by the inferior hjemorrhoidal. The vessels at the lower end of th rectum assume a longitudinal direction, communicating freely near the anus, an less freely above. 1 The blood of the large intestine is returned into the portal vein by means of th superior mesenteric and inferior mesenteric veins. At the rectum a communicatio is set up between the systemic and portal system of veins, since some of the blool of that part of the intestine is returned into the internal iliac veins. In the lowd end of the rectum the veins, like the arteries, are arranged longitudinally. Th: arrangement is called the haemorrhoidal plexus. i The nerves and lymphatics of the large intestine differ in no importai particular from those of the small intestine. i THE LIVER The liver—the largest gland in the body—is situated in the upper and rigl]| part of the abdominal cavity (figs. 565, 578). It is of most irregular shape, ll weighs between fifty and sixty ounces. In females the liver is smaller than il males. It bears a different relation to the body weight at different ages. It form] one-fortieth part of the weight of the body in the adult male, and one-thirt}'| sixth in the adult female. In the foetus, at the fourth month, it is one-tenth thl weight of the body, and in the infant at birth one twenty-fourth (fig. 578). I measures from right to left ten to twelve inches, from before backwards six tij seven inches, and three and a half inches from above downwards in the thickesj part of the right lobe. It is of a chocolate or reddish-brown colour, is solid an(j firm to the touch, but friable. Its bulk is equal to ninety-five cubic inches. |1013 THE LIVEB i In the description which follows it will be noted that there are two borders— interior and posterior ; two extremities—right and left; three surfaces—superior, nferior, and posterior; five lobes—right, left, quadrate, caudate, and Spigelian; ive fissures—umbilical, fissure for the ductus venosus, transverse, fissure of the /ena cava, fissure for the gall bladder; five ligaments—coronary, suspensory or alciform, round, right and left lateral. The liver is seen to be divided by means of a fold of peritoneum—the suspen- FiG. 578.—The Viscera of the Fcetus. (Eiidinger.) ory ligament—into two very distinct parts, the right and left lobes (figs. 578, 579). \ The anterior border of the liver is well defined, appearing as a sharp thin edge. |-0 the left of the middle point at the beginning of the longitudinal fissure is the laterlobar notch, marking the division between the right and left lobes. Further 0 the right is a notch for the gall bladder. The posterior border is thick, rounded, and fixed, is slightly marked by the ipinal column, and notched for the vena cava. 1 The right extremity is thick and rounded like the posterior border. The left xtremity is thin and flat like the anterior border.THE OBGANS OF DIGESTION 1014 The surfaces are described as they are seen m a liver which has been hardens m situ. The superior surface of the Hver is convex, and moulded to the surface of th diaphragm. It is smooth, and is covered by peritoneum. It is divided by the sus pensory ligament, which runs from before backwards, into two parts : the right ant left lobes, the right division being much the larger (fig. 579). Upon this surface c the left lobe is a shallow depression for the heart. The surface of the left lobj is much less convex than that of the right. !■ The inferior surface consists of that part of the liver in front of and includin the transverse fissure. It is irregularly concave. It is covered by peritoneun except where the gall bladder comes in contact with its surface, and at the tran^ verse fissure where the lesser omentum leaves the liver. It consists of three part —viz. the quadrate lobe, nearly all the left lobe, and the under surface of the rigb lobe (fig. 580). This inferior surface is divided into right and left sections b the longitudinal fissure which forms the inferior separation between the right an: left lobes. The part of the longitudinal fissure seen on this surface is known ai Fig. 579.—Superior Surface op the Liver. | GALL BLADDER Paleiform or suspensory ligament the umbilical fissure from its containing during foetal hfe the umbihcal vein, t remains of which are now to be seen as the round ligament.

The under surface of the right lobe is divided into two by the gall bladder, whic is contained in a fossa (the fossa of the gall bladder). The inner of these portions, which is bounded by the umbihcal fissure to the left, the fossa of the ga bladder to ihe right, and the transverse fissure behind, is called the quadrate lob j and is connected with the left lobe very often by a bridge of liver substance (poi1015 THE LIVEB lepatis) across the umbilical fissure. The outer of the two portions is much the arger, and presents three depressions upon its surface : an anterior one for the lepatic flexure of the colon {imijressio colica), a posterior one for the right [idney (impressio renalis), and one situated on the inner side of the impressio ■enahs for the descending part of the duodenum (imiwessio duodenalis). In a ardened liver these impressions are well marked, and are separated by well-defined The posterior surface is directed backwards toAvards the vertebral column, at vhich part it is concave. It includes that part of the liver behind the transverse issure, and consists of the following parts (fig. 581) :— (1) The posterior portion of the left lobe, not very well defined; it presents a mbrotuberance (the tuber omentale) in front, which projects against the lesser >mentum ; behind, a concavity coming in contact with the cardia. This portion is separated by means of the fissure of the ductus venosus from (2) he Spigelian lobe, which lies between this fissure and that of the vena cava.

It is opposite to the tenth and eleventh ihoracic vertebrae, and rests on the crura of the diaphragm. Behind its upper left- land corner the oesophagus passes to enter the stomach. Below, it projects and -orms part of the posterior boundary of the transverse fissure. It is connected mih. that part of the right lobe which enters into the posterior surface by means 3f (3) the caudate lobe, which is a small mass of liver substance running from left ko right behind the transverse fissure. It lies directly over the foramen of Winslow. It varies a good deal in form ; is sometimes well defined, at other times p bardly to be seen. When Avell defined it is about tAvo to three inches long ; behind s the termination of the fissure of the vena cava. (4) The portion of the right lobe taking part in the posterior surface consists of a strip two and a half to three inches broad (Quain). This is uncovered by peritoneum, except at the extreme right. Lying between the two layers of the coronary ligament jclose to the vena cava and near the caudate lobe is an impression for the right suprarenal capsule (imioressio sujprarenalis).THE ORGANS OF DIGESTION lOlG Fissures.—The fissures on the inferior and posterior surfaces of the hver are arranged very Uke a capital letter H. The left upright of the H is formed by the longitudinal fissure ; the anterior portion containing the umbilical vein is seen on; the inferior surface, and is known as the umbilical fissure; the posterior portion, seen on the posterior surface, contains the ductus venosus, and is therefore called' the fissure of the ductus venosus. The transverse bar of the H is formed by the| transverse or portal fissure, which runs across at right angles to the longitudinal! fissure, and contains the vessels entering the liver, viz. the portal vein, hepatic' artery, and hepatic duct (fig. 580). | The right upright of the H is formed by the fossa of the gall bladder in front ;j it is interrupted by the caudate lobe ; and is continued behind as the fissure ot the vena cava, containing, as its name implies, the inferior vena cava. \ General position.—The liver is situated in the right hypochondriac and epigastric| regions, and usually extends into the left hypochondrium (fig. 582). It is oppositel the tenth and eleventh dorsal vertebrae behind (fig. 583), and on the right side extends! between the seventh and eleventh ribs; in front, it lies behind the sixth, seventh,j Fig. 581.—Posterior Surface of the Liver. Vena cava eighth, and ninth costal cartilages ; and its anterior border corresponds on the right to the line of the margin of the costal cartilages, and to the left it is in contact with the anterior abdominal wall below the sternal notch (fig. 582). The liver is very movable, and alters its position under various circumstances. It is depressed at each inspiration, the anterior border being pushed below the ribs with a deep breath. When lying down, the liver edge is an inch or an inch and a half above the margin of the ribs. In children, the gland being larger in proportion to the body than in the adult state, it extends below the ribs and reaches the left hypochondrium. The liver's extreme left point is about an inch and a half beyond the left margin j of the sternum ; in front, inr the middle line, it reaches to about half way between I the xiphoid cartilage and the navel. The lower edge as it crosses the subcostal angle is represented by a line drawn from the ninth right to the eighth left costal ; cartilage. (Quain.) Its upper limit is indicated by a line crossing the meso-sternum close to its i lower end, and rising on the right side to the level of the fifth chondro-sternal *THE LIVEB 1017 articulation, and on the left to that of the sixth. Behind, the liver is nearest the , surface at the tenth and eleventh thoracic vertebrae. Its upper convex surface is in contact with the whole of the right arch of the diaphragm and a part of the left, as well as with the ribs and the anterior wall of the abdomen. The under surface.—The left lobe hes over the cardiac end and a portion of the anterior wall of the stomach. The right lobe lies over the hepatic flexure of the colon and right kidney, and descending portion of the duodenum. ! Fig. 582.—Eelation of the Abdominal Viscera to the Paeietes. (Treves.) j The quadrate lobe lies over the pyloric end of the stomach and first part of the duodenum. The posterior surface.—The Spigelian lobe lies against the tenth and eleventh thoracic vertebrae, the right crus of the diaphragm, and the lower end of the oesophagus. That portion of the right lobe which takes part in this surface lies jagainst the right suprarenal capsule and diaphragm. ! The inferior vena cava lies in a groove in this lobe. The small portion of the left lobe taking part in the posterior surface lies against the oesophagus.THE OBGANS OF DIGESTION 1018 I The fundus of the gall bladder is opposite to the ninth costal cartilage, close to the outer margin of the right rectus muscle. Relation to the peritoneum.—The liver is received between the layers of the i gastro-hepatic omentum. The an terior layer on leaving the transverse fissure passes | along to the anterior border of the liver, where it meets the round ligament, encloses i it, and is then continued on to the superior surface in two portions, owing to the ' intervention of the round ligament, the two layers reflected on to this structure being known as the suspensory ligament. At the posterior border of the superior surface it leaves the liver and forms the upper layer of the coronary ligament. \ i Fig. 583.—Eelation of the Abdominal Viscera to the Parietes. (Treves.) , The xiosterior layer of the gastro-hepatic omentum passes backwards, covers a portion of the posterior surface of the liver, and leaves uncovered that part of the ; right lobe (except the extreme right) which takes part in this surface. It is finally ] reflected to form the inferior layer of the coronary ligament. The parts of the liver uncovered by peritoneum are : the transverse fissure, the ' fossa of the gall bladder, and that portion of the posterior surface made up by the j right lobe, and to which allusion has already been made. | Underneath the peritoneal investment of the liver is a thin fibro-elastic membrane [ i1019 THE LIVEB I iwhich is intimately adherent to the peritoneum, and is continuous over the Uver where the peritoneum is deficient. At the transverse fissure this fihrous layer [invests the hepatic vessels, forming a special sheath which follows the vessels as I they enter the liver: this structure receives the name of Glisson's capsule. I Above. I Diaphragm and anterior wall of abdomen. i I Behind. j Tenth and eleventh thoracic verte- ' brse ; crm^a of diaphragm; lower end of oesophagus; right supra- renal capsule; great vessels. Below. Cardiac end of stomach ; hepatic flexure of coloai; right kidney; first and second portions of duodenum. Ligaments of the liver.—With the exception of the round ligament, the liga- ments are formed by the peritoneum, and (with the same exception) are all attached jto the diaphragm. The reflexion of the two layers of peritoneum from the posterior Surface of the liver to the diaphragm, as just described, forms the coronary ligaments, the extremities, or lateral continuations, being called the right and left lateral lligaments. The left lateral ligament is the longer, and is attached to the diaphragm in front of the oesophagus. The right is attached to the back part of the liaphragm. The broad ligament (falciform or suspensory ligament) is also continuous jbehind with the coronary ligament; it is formed by the adjacent surfaces of the two portions of peritoneum covering the superior surface ; it extends from the ambilicus where is the apex of the falx. The upper rounded border is connected with the anterior abdominal wall and diaphragm. The free or anterior border 3ontains the round ligament; the lower or attached border extends from before backwards on the upper surface of the liver. The round ligament is a fibrous cord (the remains of the umbilical vein), extending m the free border of the broad ligament from the longitudinal fissure to the imbilicus. Blood-vessels.—The liver receives its arterial supply of blood from the hepatic irtery, a branch of the coeliac axis, which passes up between the two layers of the esser omentum, and, dividing into two branches, one for each lobe, enters the liver it the transverse fissure. The right branch gives off a branch to the gall bladder, the liver receives a much larger supply of blood from the ijortal vein, which 3onveys to the liver blood from the stomach, intestines, pancreas, and spleen. It mters the transverse fissure, and there divides into two branches. Below this tissure the hepatic artery lies to the left, the bile duct to the right, and the portal K^ein behind and between the two (fig. 584). These three structures ascend to the iiver between the layers of the gastro-hepatic omentum in front of the foramen 3f Winslow. At the actual fissure the order of the three structures from before backwards is—duct, artery, vein. I The hepatic veins, by which the blood of the liver passes into the inferior vena pava, open by several large and small openings into that vessel at the posterior surface of the gland at the bottom of the fossa of the vena cava. I Lymphatics.—The lymphatics are divided into a deep and a superficial set. The fleep set run with the branches of the portal vein, artery, and duct through the liver, leaving at the transverse fissure, where they join the vessels of the superficial set. The superficial set begin in the subperitoneal tissue. Those of the upper urface consist:—(1) Of vessels which pass up, principally, in the broad ligamentTHE ORGANS OF DIGESTION 1020 and right and left lateral ligaments, through the diaphragm, and so into the anterior mediastinal glands; occasionally lymphatics of the right ligament pass straight into the thoracic duct. (2) Of a set passing over the anterior border of the liver I to the glands in the small omentum about the transverse fissure. j On the under surface, the lymphatics to the right of the gall bladder enter the' lumbar glands. | Those round the gall bladder enter -the glands of the lesser omentum. i Those to the left of the gall bladder enter the glands of the oesophagus andi lesser curvature of the stomach. 1 Structure of the liver.—If a section be made of the liver, the following features! in its general structure may be noted :— i Outside of all will be seen the investment of j^eritoneum, which is incomplete i in parts, and which has been already described. Within this a ihin fihrous coat will be observed to invest the entire gland. At| the transverse fissure this coat turns into the substance of the liver with thej branches of the portal vein. " Glisson's capsule.—The capsule is in all parts closely adherent to the gland- substance, and is thickest where the peritoneum is absent. The liver on section is seen to be mottled, and when a portion is torn thai Fig. 584.—Eelation of Structures at and below the Transverse Fissure. (Thane.) surface presents a granular appearance. This is produced by the minute lobules^ (one twenty-fourth to one-twelfth of an inch in diameter) of which the liver tissue is composed. The cut surface will also exhibit the openings of a number of canals. A slight examination will show that these are of two kinds—viz. the canals for the branches of the portal vein and the canals for the hepatic veins. In the iiortal canals the vein is accompanied by a branch of the duct and a branch of the hepatic artery. The vein has thick walls which will be seen to bei more or less collapsed on section. The vessels in the canal are separated from the liver substance by much connective tissue (Glisson's capsule, fig. 585). In the hepatic ca?ials the veins are solitary, their walls are exceedingly thin, and their mouths open and gaping. The wall of the vein is directly adherent to tJae liver substance, no connective tissue capsule intervening. The gall bladder, which retains the bile, is situated between the right andi quadrate lobes on the under surface of the liver. It is of pyriform outline, and when full is seen projecting beyond the anterior border of the liver, coming in > contact with the abdominal wall at the cartilage of the ninth or tenth rib. It extends back as far as the transverse fissure. It measures in length, from before backwards, from two and a half to four inches, | and an inch and a half across at the widest part, and will hold about one ounce. ' GALL BLADDER BILE DUCT Hepatic artery Portal vein1021 THE GALL BLADDEB The broad end of the sac is directed forwards, dowmvards, and to the right, and is called the fundus. The narrow end, or nech, which is curved first to the right, then to the left, is at the transverse fissure. The intervening part is called the body. Its uiJioer surface is in contact with the liver, lying in the fossa of the gall bladder. It is attached to the liver by connective tissue. The lower surface is covered by peritoneum, which passes over its sides and inferior surface, though [ occasionally it entirely surrounds the gall bladder, forming a sort of mesentery to j attach it to the liver. The lower surface comes into contact with the first part of j the duodenum and hepatic flexure of the colon, and occasionally with the pyloric ends of stomach or small intestine, which are often ])ost mortem found stained with bile. 1 The neck of the gall bladder opens into the cystic duct. This is a tube an ' inch to an inch and a half long, which unites with the hepatic duct to form the ! common duct; it is directed backwards and to the left as it runs in the lesser omentum, the hepatic artery being to the left, and the portal vein behind. It joins the hepatic duct at an acute angle. The hepatic duct begins with a branch from each lobe right and left in the Fig. 585.—Section of a Portal Canal. (Qnain.) LYMPHATICS IN GLISSON' vein m GLISSON'S CAPSULE transverse fissure, and is directed downwards and to the right in the folds of the ;lesser omentum, the hepatic artery being to the left. It is not quite two inches long. Uniting with the cystic duct, it forms the common bile duct (ductus com- munis choledochus). I The common bile duct is about three inches in length. It passes down between the layers of the lesser omentum, in front of the portal vein, and to the right of the hepatic artery (fig. 584); it then passes behind the first part of the duodenum, then between the second part and the head of the pancreas, and ends at the lower part of the second segment of the duodenum by opening into that part of the intestine on its left side and somewhat behind (figs. 571, 586, and 587). It pierces the intes- tinal wall very obliquely, running between the muscular layer for about three- iquarters of an inch; there is a slight constriction at its termination. The [pancreatic duct is united with the common bile duct just before its termination. [There is a slight papilla at their place of opening on the mucous surface of [the duodenum. This papilla is about four inches from the pylorus. After the pancreatic duct has entered the bile duct there is a dilatation of the common tube called the ampulla of Vater. The common duct has a diameter of about two lines. Its width at theTHE OBGANS OF DIGESTION 1022 ampulla is three lines. It is narrowest at its outlet into the duodenum. The cystic! and hepatic ducts are a little narrower than the common duct. Structure of the gall bladder.—The wall of the gall bladder is made up of! three coats—serous, muscular or fibrous, and mucous. Fig. 586.—Abdominal Viscera, from behind. (Rtidinger.) DESCENDll Inferior it 1. The serous coat being formed by the peritoneum, is only found on the lower surface and part or the sides. Beneath this coat is a nerve plexus. 2. Tho, fibrous coat consists of plain muscular fibres and fibrous tissue. The muscular fibres run mostly longitudinally, some transversely. The fibrous tissue consists of white fibres running in every way. This layer contains the principal blood-vessels and lymphatics, and also contains a nerve plexus.1023 THE GALL BLADDEB 8. The mucous coat is raised into rugffi bounding polygonal spaces, which are largest about the body. It is lined with columnar epithelium, and contains many mucous glands. At the neck the mucous membrane forms folds which project into the interior, acting as valves. This layer contains an anastomosis of blood- vessels, and a fine plexus of lymphatics. The ducts consist of a fibrous and a mucous layer. In the fibrous layer are muscular fibres which are chiefly circular, together with many strong white connective tissue and elastic fibres. The mucous layer is lined with columnar epithelium, and has many mucous glands. In the cystic duct the mucous membrane is raised into folds, which are crescentic in form, and so directed obliquely as to seem to surround the lumen of the tube in a spiral manner. Varieties of the Liver Varieties are more rare in the liver than in almost any other organ of the I body. The left lobe may be very small; on the other hand, it may be much larger, occasionally extending in an attenuated form much more towards the left. The ileft lobe, or a portion of it, may be attached only by a pedicle of peritoneum and vessels to the main organ. The gall bladder has been seen through an opening in the upper surface, owing to the depth of the fossa of the gall bladder. I The liver may be subdivided into many lobes, or may show no division at all. ! It may retain the thick rounded form of the fcetus. The gall badder may be absent, in which case the hepatic duct usually becomes much dilated before it reaches the duodenum. ! The gall bladder may be partially divided either transversely or longitudinally. The common duct may enter the bowel independently of the pancreatic duct. THE PANCREAS The pancreas is situated in the epigastric and left hypochondriac regions. It lis a compound racemose gland. It lies transversely across the body, on a level with the first lumbar vertebra, and is deeply placed (fig. 577). It differs in shape as it is examined in situ, or removed from the body. When examined in situ it shows various impressions for the different organs with which it is in contact (figs. 570, j571); when removed from the body it appears to be longer, and runs to a point at bhe left extremity (fig. 587). It is of a pinkish-cream colour and soft in texture. It shows upon its surface the markings between the lobules of which it is made up. It may be divided into three portions : a head, a body, and a tail. The head of the pancreas is situated at the right extremity of the gland, and is contained in ■jhe loop of the duodenum. The head is bent downwards, so that it extends lower :han the lower border of the body. Behind it are found the common bile duct, jyvhich runs, as a rule, in a canal in its substance, and the vena cava (fig. 571). A Dortion of the head, to which the name lesser pancreas has been given, situated it the lower part, hooks round the superior mesenteric vessels, making a groove, )r even a canal, for them. In front of the head is the attachment of the transverse neso-colon and the stomach. ^ According to Professor His, there are three surfaces on the body of the pancreas : interior, inferior, and posterior. The body extends from the head of the gland1024 THE OBGANS OF DIGESTION to the spleen; it is situated transversely across the vertebral column with the larg(j vessels intervening. ! i The anterior surface is in contact with the stomach, which organ gives ?! concavity to the surface (fig. 590). This surface is covered by peritoneum derivecj from the ascending layer of the transverse meso-colon. The posterior surface is in contact with the crura of the diaphragm, the aorta vena cava, and superior mesenteric vessels, which structures are interposed betweeri it and the spine (figs. 571, 586). The splenic artery and vein run lengthways abovd the back of the upper border of the posterior surface. To the left, the posterio]! surface is in contact with the left kidney and suprarenal capsule. The uppeij border in the middle line abuts against the coeHac axis. The inferior surface is narrow, and lies over the third part of the duodenum ancj beginning of the jejunum. The transverse meso-colon is continued from the fron- of the head along the border separating this surface from the anterior surface The splenic end of the transverse colon lies under the left extremity of this surface From the under surface of the transverse meso-colon a layer of peritoneum passe: to the central part of the inferior surface. Fig. 587.—The Pancreas and its Duct. DUCT OF PANCREAS DUCT OF PANCREAS COMMON BILE DUCT The tail of the pancreas is the name given to the left extremity of the organ it touches the anterior surface of the spleen. The duct of the pancreas, or the canal of Wirsung, Avhite in appearance, run from nearly the extreme left of the gland, concealed by the proper substance of th pancreas, nearer its posterior surface than the anterior, between the upper and lowe: borders, to empty into the lower and inner part of the second portion of the duodenun with the common bile duct. It runs sinuously, receiving its branches as it goes which enter nearly at right angles. These branches are straight. Its diameter nea: its termination is one-eighth of an inch. Near its termination it is generally joinet by another duct, that of the lesser pancreas, though this may open into the duo denum separately (fig. 587). The pancreatic duct often does not join the commo' bile duct until its termination, running side by side with it through the walls of th intestine. Occasionally the pancreatic duct opens by itself into the duodenum. Blood-supply.—The pancreas receives blood from the splenic artery throug' its pancreatic branches, and from the superior mesenteric and hepatic by th inferior and superior pancreatico-duodenal arteries, which form a loop runnin round, below, and to the right of its head. The blood is returned into the portal vein by means of the splenic and superio mesenteric veins.THE SPLEEN 1025 ! Lymphatics.—The lymphatics terminate in two glands which lie on the Riperior mesenteric artery. Nerves.—These are branches of the solar plexus which accompany the arteries ^ entering the gland. THE SPLEEN Position.—The spleen—one of the ductless glands—is situated for the most |>art in the left hypochondriac region (figs. 577, 591). It is deeply placed between he fundus of the stomach and the diaphragm, and in the line of the axilla it ixtends between the eighth and eleventh ribs. It is covered by the ninth, tenths .nd eleventh ribs (fig. 583), and is separated from them by the diaphragm and to a. I mailer extent by the lung. Its upper end reaches to the level of the ninth thoracic pine, and its lower end to the level of the first lumbar spine. Its inner extremity 3 within two inches of the median plane of the body, and its outer boundary is jiosterior to the mid-axillary line. A line drawn from the left sterno-clavicular Ibint to the tip of the eleventh left rib bounds the anterior margin of the spleen. It is bluish-red in colour, is soft, and easily lacerated. Fig. 588.—Outer Aspect of the Spleen. ANTERIOR BORDER- LOWER END Its shape varies, and depends much upon the condition in which it is examined. • soft, and as usually found after removal from the body, it can only be said to jave two surfaces, an outer convex and an inner concave; but if examined after has been hardened in situ, after the manner of Professor His, it is seen to be of much more precise shape, and to present three surfaces (fig. 590). Viewed from the outside, it presents a form which is irregularly oval, wider wve than below, with a bulging of the anterior border (fig. 588). The three irfaces are the external, anterior, and inner. The external or posterior surface is le largest. It is regularly convex, and is directed outwards and backwards and miewhat upwards (figs. 588, 590). It lies against the commencement of the bch of the diaphragm. It is covered by peritoneum. Viewed from the inside, the 1^0 other surfaces are seen to be divided by a distinct vertically directed ridge (fig. pO). The anterior of the two looks forwards, inwards, and a little downwards. 1 is concave from above downwards, and from side to side. It is a good deal the 3 U102G THE ORGANS OF DIGESTION larger of the two, and is semilunar in shape (fig. 589). It is in contact with the great cul-de-sac of the stomach, with the tip of the pancreas, and the extreme point of the splenic flexm^e of the colon (fig. 586).

SPLEEN In size it varies, owing to the fact that it increases in dimensions after food and ider other circumstances. In the adult it measures generally about five to six ches in length, three or four inches in breadth, and one to one and a half inch thickness ; its usual volume, according to Krause, is from nine and three-quarters fifteen cubic inches. It is entirely surrounded by peritoneum except at the hilum. On either side of |e hilum the gastro-splenic ligament is attached. This reflexion of peritoneum, jmetimes called the gastro-splenic omentum, passes inwards to the left extremity [ the stomach and the left margin of the great omentum. A fold of peritoneum, ephreno-splenic ligament, connects the upper end of the spleen to the diaphragm. Varieties.—The principal peculiarity is due to the presence of supplementary 3 u 21028 THE OBGANS OF DIGESTION spleens (lienculi), found in the gastro-splenic omentum, or less often in the grea omentum. From one to twenty of these small bodies may be met with. They an red and round, of the same structure as the spleen, and vary in size from a pea t( a walnut. Structure.—Beneath the covering of peritoneum is a thin but tough capsule o areolar tissue, which is very adherent to the serous membrane. It is remarkabl; elastic. It sends a prolongation in at the hilum, which follows and supports th vessels to their termination. Within the capsule is the puliJ. This is a ver; friable soft tissue of a dark reddish-brown colour, not unlike grumous blood i] colour and consistence. It can be squeezed out from the cut spleen, and then i will be seen that the whole organ is pervaded by a network of fine fibres whic support the pulp. The larger of these come off directly from the fibrous capsuk and are called the trabecules. In Front. Stomach; splenic flexure of colon. Outer Side.

Blood-supply.—The spleen receives its blood from the splenic artery, which very large in proportion to the body it is going to supply. It divides before enterii into about six branches. The artery is very tortuous. The vein, on the oth; hand, is straight, and lies below the artery. ; The lymphatics are divided into a superficial and a deep set. The former fori a plexus beneath the peritoneum. The latter are derived from fine perivascul j spaces in the adenoid tissue around the vessels. They join at the hilum, ai pass between the layers of the gastro-hepatic omentum to the glands in th neighbourhood. j The nerves are from the solar plexus. They pass in along the splenic artery I THE EVOLUTION OF THE PEEITONEUM AND AN EXPLANATIQ]! OF ITS AKKANGEMENT IN THE HUMAN BODY 1 The peritoneum is a serous membrane and is identical with other like-nam { membranes which are less complicated in their disposition. It differs in ]| essential particular from the pleura, from the pericardium, from the tunica vaginal j from the synovial membrane of a joint, or from the simple vaginal sheath of | tendon. In all there is practically a closed sac of thin membrane, which is I disposed as to both line a cavity and to invest the structures which encroach up( j that cavity. j Imagine a pleural cavity from which the lung had vanished without distur ance of parts. The membrane lining it vfould appear as a simple serous Next conceive the lung gradually budding towards this sac. It would push t] membrane before it, and as it did so it would both encroach upon the cavity lin by the membrane, and be itself covered or invested by it. When the lung had attained nearly to the dimensions of the rigid cavity it wi i1029 THE FEBITONEUM occupying, the serous lining would be found to invest the whole of it excepting only its pedicle—the stalk of the original bud—the root of the lung. Although the thoracic space might be almost obliterated, the lung would still remain entirely outside the cavity of the serous sac. It would be convenient then to speak of the undisturbed layer which still lined the thoracic space as the parietal layer, and the layer which had come in a passive way to invest the lung as the visceral layer. In the abdomen a similar condition exists. Imagine all the viscera to have vanished from the abdominal cavity. A great space would exist, bounded above by mi "^'^ the diaphragm, below by the pelvic floor, and in front and behind by the abdominal parietes. This space would be evenly lined by the peritoneum in the form of a simple closed sac. As the viscera reappeared they would emerge, as it were, from the posterior wall of the belly, and would project into the cavity of the abdomen. In so doing they would push before them the peritoneum lining the posterior wall of the cavity, and would each in turn become invested by the displaced membrane. All the abdominal viscera are outside the peritoneal cavity, although they are obviously within the abdominal space. The peritoneal sac remains entirely empty, and its wall, with the exception of the Fallopian orifices, is unbroken. That part of the simple sac which lines the anterior abdominal parietes is practically the only part which retains its original connections undisturbed. One main function of a serous membrane is to minimise the effects of friction. Those viscera which are exposed to most movement, such as the small intestines, ire the most completely invested by the smooth membrane ; those which remain fixed, such as the kidney, are only casually invested. The movements of the nscera in respiration, the alteration in shape and position which will occur in such organs as the stomach and bladder, are provided for by the peritoneum in such a manner that these movements are practically without friction. The viscera contained in the abdomen are not only numerous, but they are of 7ery complex outline for the most part, and they are disposed in a manner which iends to greatly confuse their relations with one another. A bare description of the peritoneum, as it is met with in the human subject, «ri™J|nust needs be intricate and complicated, and if considered without reference to nore primitive and simpler conditions is almost inexplicable. The description nay be followed, but it needs interpretation, and no account of this membrane can )e considered to be satisfactory unless it be rendered evident how the complex irrangement has come about, and unless the student base his conceptions upon the imple and rudimentary disposition which an elaborate development of parts and b remarkable specialisation of structure have rendered intricate and confusing. The readiest idea of the disposition of the peritoneum is to be derived from a tudy of the development and most rudimentary forms of that membrane. Such - study is founded upon an examination of the human embryo at various periods, -nd of the peritoneum in the mammalia and lower animals. The simple alimentary tube.—The alimentary canal first appears as a simple ube lying about the median line in front of the posterior abdominal parietes, and )laced vertically. This tube is connected with the posterior parietes by a simple old of peritoneum—a species of general mesentery (fig. 592). The fact that the abdominal cavity is at an early period open in front, and that he rudimentary intestine protrudes beyond the limits of the future cavity, may be iisregarded. The cavity, such as it is, is lined by a membrane which is later ecognisable as the peritoneum, and the general mesentery is produced by the rowth and protrusion forwards of the elementary bowel from the tissues behind, .6. outside the peritoneum. The simple straight tube, suspended on the posterior mesial line by its fold of )eritoneum, becomes in due course differentiated (fig. 592). Hill lisTHE ORGANS OF DIGESTION 1030 The upper part becomes the stomach ; the bowel immediately beyond forms th duodenum ; then follow the small intestine ; and lastly the colon and rectum. The point of separation of the small bowel from the colon is indicated by th appearance of the caecum. Fig. 592.—Diagram of the Primitive Alimentary Canal. (A: a indicates the vitello-intestinal duct; b points to the future position of the caecum, It will be understood also that the upper part of the mesial peritoneal fold is call( the meso-gaster (m-g, fig. 593); the next part the meso-duodenum (m-d) ; and tl succeeding portions, in order, the mesentery, the meso-colon, and the meso-rectu (fig. 593, MES, M-c, m-r). The stomach becomes more distinctly marked ; the tul below lengthens and forms an intestinal loop, which in the embryo projects beyoi the site of the future umbilicus, taking the mesentery with it. Fig. 593.—Diagram of the Primitive Alimentary Canal. This elementary condition of the intestinal canal persists in certain fully dev-elo; animals. As an example may be taken the alimentary canal of the salamander, depicted in fig. 594. In this figure the viscera are shown undisturbed. In fig. 5i the peritoneum has been drawn forwards so as to show the parts in one medi: plane, and well represents the simple arrangement. In many mammals among tjI THE ALIMENTABY CANAL 1031 : Edentates the simple vertical median fold of peritonemii is retained. ■ This is shown I in the great anteater and in Hoffmann's sloth (fig. 596), where the intestinal canal, , from the pylorus to the rectum, is still quite simple, although it is of considerable length, and is, as a consequence, thrown into numerous coils. The whole of this long tube is supported by a single median fold of peritoneum attached to the middle line behind, and serving the purpose of meso-duodenum, mesentery, meso- colon, and meso-rectum in one. Where this fold is attached behind runs the aorta, and between the layers of the fold vessels pass forwards to supply the viscera. (Fig. 592, B, a, represents the intestinal tube to which an artery is passing.) There will be an artery to the stomach (i, fig. 593) and the great mesenteric artery. The latter vessel will supply the rudimentary duodenum, the small intestines, the caecum, and such part of the colon as is later on known as the ascending and transverse segments. The arrangement of the vessel is shown in figs. 593, 2, and 596. The descending colon and rectum are suppHed by a separate vessel, the inferior mesenteric, direct from the aorta (3, figs. 593 and 596). At the summit of the primitive loop which forms the principal part of the intes- FiG. 594.—Alimentary Canal of Salamandra maculosa. tine will be the vitello-intestinal duct or vitelline stalk (v. d, fig. 593 ; a, fig. 592, A), It is to this point that the great or superior mesenteric artery is directed. The morphological ending of the superior mesenteric artery is at this spot, while branches pass off from either side of it. The student may be reminded that a trace of the vitelline duct may persist in the form of a process known as Meckel's diverticulum, and that this process, when existing, is situated in the lower part of the ilemPx not far from the cpecum (page 1003). In the adult the trunk of the artery may be represented by a line drawn from its place of origin to a point on the ileum from one to three feet from the csecum. The primitive intestinal loop increases in length, and forms longer and more complex coils. A large part of these coils will lie without the abdomen, the anterior abdominal wall being still incomplete. As the loop lengthens, a species of neck forms which tends to become narrower. The upper part of this neck or strait is bounded or formed by the duodenum; the lower part by that portion of the large bowel which is at a later period known as the transverse colon (fig. 593). The transverse colon and the duodenum are thus brought near together, and it is noteworthy that, no matter how complex the relations of the bowel become, these segments of the intestinal tube are never separated. In the narrow neck formed1032 THE OBGANS OF DIGESTION between them runs the trunk of the superior mesenteric artery. The great loop beyond this neck will form the small intestine, the caecum, and the ascending colon. The descending colon retains its simple connections with the median line (fig. 593). The mesentery does not increase in the same proportion as the intestines gro\v,j and hence the bowel is thrown into innumerable convolutions. In the humanj subject the increase in the breadth of the mesentery is somewhat more noteworthy} than its increase in length. | There is a time, then, when the great mass of the intestine is supported by a! simple but extensive mesentery, which is entirely free, and which is attached behindj by means of a narrow neck bounded by the duodenum and the right end of thej transverse colon, and through w^hich the superior mesenteric artery runs. j The great intestinal loop projects at first anteriorly and mesially. The small' intestine is above, the large intestine below (figs. 593, 595). I As the coils of bowel become more fully developed, it will be seen that all the; small intestines lie to the right hand side, and the caecum and the commencement' of the colon to the left. The vasa intestini tenuis of the superior mesenteric^ artery consequently arise from the right side of the vessel, while the ileo-colic, righti colic, and middle colic all arise from the left (fig. 593). Fig. 595.—Alimentary Canal of Salamandra maculosa. Further development in this direction may not proceed, and the condition above described is met with in some of the lower mammals as a permanent arrangement (fig. 596). The rotation of the intestinal canal.—As development proceeds, the plates which are forming the anterior abdominal parietes approach one another, and the closure! of the cavity of the abdomen is imminent. The loops which have up to this time projected beyond the site of the future umbilicus are now withdrawn into the abdomen. About this time a remarkable and quite characteristic rotation of the general mesenteric fold takes place. The rotation is from left to right, and is around an; axis which may be represented by a line drawn from the neck or pedicle of the common mesentery to the site of the vitelline duct. This is in fact the line of the superior mesenteric artery (fig. £93). The rotation is therefore at the neck of: -the great and complex loop of intestine, which neck, as has been already said, is bounded by the duodenum and the right end of the transverse colon. \ As a result of this rotation, the caecum and the ascending colon turn over to \ the right, while the great mass of the small intestines is brought to the left (fig. 597).; The lower end of the duodenum will be consequently carried to the left; the j transverse colon will lie in front of it instead of below it; and the superior mesen-!1033 THE INTESTINAL CANAL teric artery (2, fig. 597), which must still run between these two segments of the bowel, will now be described as passing over the duodenum, or as crossing its anterior surface. It is needless to say that in the fully-developed body this artery crosses the left end of the third part of the duodenum, and is behind the right end of the transverse colon. It will be seen that, in spite of this revolution, the duodenum and the transverse colon still retain their relations to one another, and still mark the neck or pedicle of attachment of the common mesenteric fold. The effect of this rotation of the intestinal tube is shown in the diagram on the next page (fig. 597). The caecum and ascending colon are now moved to the right; the transverse colon is more distinctly transverse ; the small intestine has passed over to the left side. The right side of the mesentery has become the left side, and vice versa; and the vasa intestini tenuis now appear to arise from the left border of the superior Fig. 596.—Alimentary Canal of Choloepus Hoffmann/. COLON PYLORUS mesenteric artery instead of from the right (fig. 597). The duodenum is almost aidden from view, and has been brought into close contact with the vertebral 3olumn. The descending colon remains unchanged, and is supported by the 5till undisturbed median fold of peritoneum. The duodenum still has a meso-duodenum, and is still entirely invested by peritoneum. In man further changes take place, but in mammals below man the condition lust described is that which represents the normal arrangement. Fig. 597 may be 'considered to represent in diagrammatic fashion the simple intestine of a carnivorous animal. In the human subject even development may not proceed beyond this point, and he condition detailed may be met with in the adult as a permanent arrangement. I lave described some examples of this (' The Anatomy of the Intestinal Canal and Peritoneum in Man,' London, 1885 ; and 'Lancet,' Oct. 13,1888). In these instancesTHE OBGANS OF DIGESTION 1034 the whole of the small intestine, together with the cfeciim and the ascending colon, were slung from a common mesentery, the attachment of which to the posterioi parietes was by a narrow neck giving passage to the superior mesenteric artery, and bounded by the duodenum and the transverse colon. In these subjects there was no trace of the mesentery proper as it is found in the normal human body, The duodenum had been deprived of its meso-duodenum, and the descending meso j colon was comparatively scanty; but, wdth these and some minor exceptions, thei resemblance of the arrangement of the bow^els to that met with in the loAver animabi was very exact. It is the existence of this immature condition that predisposes tci certain forms of twist or volvulus of the bowel. I The progress of this rudimentary revolution of the intestinal tube may be notecj by observing the progress of the caecum. i That prominent diverticulum lies at first below the loop forming the lesser bowel: and then to its left side. It is at first without the abdomen, and is gradually with j drawn in the progress of development through the rapidly closing umbilical opening, It then lies about the middle of the belly and just below the liver. Later, ii passes to the right side, and then descends into the right iliac fossa. ' Fig. 597.—Diagram to show the Eotation of the Intestinal Canal. It may be permanently arrested at any point of its course. In the conditior known as the congenital umbilical hernia, the gap in the anterior abdominal parietes; has never closed, and the protruding loop of bowel has never been quite withdraw! ^ into the abdomen. The sac of such a hernia is made out of the tissues of th( umbilical cord, and the contents are usually the caecum and lower part of th( ileum, and not infrequently a Meckel's diverticulum. As has been mentione(, already, the caecum may be found near the middle line or in the right hypochondria( region (page 1007). It is then spoken of as undescended. Final chang^es in the peritoneum.—Further changes in the position of th(; intestine and in the arrangement of the peritoneum are finally brought about, am: these changes are almost entirely limited to the human subject. The intestinij grows, and other abdominal viscera are encroaching upon the peritoneum. Thi;- membrane is mobile, is easily drawn from one point to another, and is capabL of considerable adjustment. It does not, however, continue to grow at the saim rate as the viscera which it serves to cover. The peritoneum is relatively mor<; extensive in the foetus than in the adult, and in the lower mammals than in man. ■ If the viscera grow out of proportion to the peritoneum, it is evident that th( j reflexions of that membrane must here and there be shortened ; and it is possibL ■1035 THE PEBITONEUM that a viscus which was at one time entirely covered by peritoneum may in due j course become ahiiost bared of it. This is so. In the diagram (fig. 598) a transverse section of the body is imagined, the section traversing the spot where the duodenum and transverse colon are in relation at the neck of the great common mesentery. Here, by reason of the rotation of the intestine from left to right, the mesenteric [ lamina has become folded upon itself (A, fig. 598). The fold would be V-shaped, open above, but coming to a point below. On transverse section the meso- duodenum (m-d) and transverse meso-colon (m-c) can be seen side by side. Now a I constantly increasing demand upon the peritoneum is made by the rapidly growing ' viscera. The membrane is drawn in this direction and in that. There is some symmetry, however, within the abdomen, and the membrane may be conceived to I be drawn equally upon in the direction of the arrows R and l. Fig. 598.—Diagram to show the Eelation of the Peritoneum to the Duodenum. 0. The result of such traction upon the peritoneum in this particular instance will be to lessen the length of the transverse meso-colon, and to use up the meso- iduodenum altogether (fig. 598, B). That piece of bowel is indeed at last left uncovered by peritoneum behind, and is brought into contact with the posterior parietes. The j serous membrane which formed the meso-duodenum has been utilised to afford a covering for adjacent viscera, which are increasing in size, and are pushing the peritoneum before them as they advance. In this particular region of the |abdomen the growth of the liver, stomach, and spleen make great demands upon [the adjacent peritoneum. As has been already said, it is evident that the growth I of the general sac of the peritoneum does not keep pace with the growth of the structures it covers, and that it is possible for one organ to be clothed with peritoneum at the expense of another. To complete the account of the general relation of the peritoneum to the intestine, the following changes remain to be noticed : — The meso-colon.—The descending colon is displaced by the growth of the rest of1036 THE OBGANS OF DIGESTION l the boYN'el to the left side, and comes to occupy the x^osition which it holds in the i fully developed body. The primitive meso-colon is displaced also to the left, and sur\'ives as the descending meso-colon, the sigmoid meso-colon, and the meso-rectmn (fig. 599). It may be so curtailed that no distinct fold that can be called a descending meso-colon is left, and the posterior part of the bowel is in such a case found to be more or less uncovered by the peritoneum. The meso-rectum is a genuine and but little disturbed relic of the simple median vertical fold of the primitive body. The duodenum is more or less bared of peritoneum, especially so far as its third part is concerned. The ascending colon has, hke the descending colon, been deprived of a con- siderable amount of its peritoneum. This membrane originally belonged to the common mesentery, but so much of it may have been abstracted from the bowel, that this part of the colon may be free from peritoneum behind, or may be con- nected to the posterior parietes by a short meso-colon. The parietal attachments (so-called) of this ascending meso-colon are entirely acquired, and have no relation whatever to the primary attachment of the median fold—the primitive meso-colon— to the posterior wall of the abdomen (fig. 599). The mesentery.—The mesentery proper—the fold belonging to the small intestines—in like manner and by a similar process acquires a new connection mth the posterior parietes. In using the term ' new connection,' it must be understood that the sac of the peritoneum remains quite unbroken, and that the numerous duphcatures of the membrane have simply been so readjusted and displaced that it' has in more points than one a reflexion from the posterior wall of the abdomen The mesentery is described as being ' attached posteriorly by a very short border which extends from the level of the attachment of the transverse meso-colon to the; left of the middle line directly down to the right ihac fossa where the ileum falls into the caecum' (Quain). This is the precise attachment made evident when the intestines have been all cut away, and nothing but the stump of the mesentery is left (fig. 599). The attachment is, however, wholly acquired or secondary, and has been brought about by an extensive readjustment of the peritoneum. The real attachment of the mesentery is about the origin of the superior mesenteric artery, and this attachment obtains in mammals below man. In fig. 599 is shown the posterior wall of the abdomen after the removal of the intestines, together witfcl the stomach, liver, and spleen. The lines of the various peritoneal reflexions are depicted in a diagrammatic manner. A line drawn downwards, commencing at the falciform ligament of the liver, and continued past the oesophagus, through the gastro-splenic omentum, descendmg meso-colon, and sigmoid meso-colon. represents the original attachment of the primitive median fold. All other lines of reflexion must be regarded as acquired or secondary. The meso-gaster.—It now remains to consider what becomes of the upper part of the simple primitive fold of peritoneum—the meso-gaster (m-g, fig. 593). The stomach enlarges, assumes more of its characteristic outline, and becomes less vertical. The liver may be regarded as an outgrowth from the duodenum. Its con- nections with the great veins of the heart cause it to extend upwards and to the right side. As it grows it separates the layers of the highest part of the peritoneal fold, and from this membrane it receives a covering. The remains of the primitive mesial fold persist in the form of the falciform ligament (figs. 593, 595, and 599). The gastro-hepatic omentum.—The connection of the liver to the stomach is intimate, partly through the association of the great gland with the duodenum, and partly through certain blood-vessels which pass to the stomach and Hver from the aorta. As the stomach enlarges, its duodenal end is drawn towards the right side; the viscus becomes transverse, the left wall becomes anterior, and the right posterior. The layer of peritoneum which stretches between the two organs is called theTHE GREAT OMENTUM 1037 gastro-hepatic or lesser omentum. The right or free margin of this omentum was originally anterior, and the whole fold is directly derived, with but little disturbance of the membrane, from the upper part of the primitive meso-gaster (figs. 593, 595). The great omentum.—The formation and disposition of the great omentum are a little difficult to follow in the adult human species, and the student's conception of the right character of this fold may be a little distorted by a study of certain Fig. 599.—Diageam to show the Lines along which the Peritoneum leaves THE Wall of the Abdomen to invest the Viscera.

In mammals and in the human foetus the disposition of the great omentum is readily appreciated. This fold appears as a bulging of the meso-gaster forwards and to the left. When the stomach has assumed its final position, this bulging of the membrane is of course entirely in the direction forwards. At first the great omentum forms a shallow and wide-mouthed bag. ItsTHE ORGANS OF DIGESTION 1038 appearance is such as could be produced in imagination if the fingers were to be pressed against the right (posterior) side of the meso-gaster, and were to force a bag of the yielding membrane before them. The pendulous bag-Hke projection could be seen from the left side of the meso-gaster and the wide opening into the bag from the right (fig. 600). Here the bag is represented as cut away. An arrow Fig. 600.—Diagram to show the Formation of the Great Omentum. passing from right to left, i.e. from behind forwards, shows the direction of the protrusion. The dotted Une represents the position of the bag ; a and p represent sections of its anterior and posterior walls. j The bag becomes larger and larger, and more and more pendulous, until it at last hangs down over the transverse colon and the small intestines as a kind of Fig. 601.— Great Omentum in Macropus P£yicJLLATU,'<. apron. Its orifice becomes narrowed in time by the growth of structures around ; it, and is known as the foramen of Winslow. j If the finger be introduced into this foramen, it will touch the posterior wall of the stomach, and consequently the right (or posterior) layer of the original meso- gaster. As both layers of the meso-gaster enter into the formation of this pouch j or apron, it must of necessity be formed of four layers of peritoneum. :THE GBEAT 0JIENTU2I 1039 The place where the bulging takes place is a matter of importance. Originally such part of the meso-gaster is involved in it as extends from the region of the pylorus to about the middle of the fundus of the stomach (fig. 600). In the lower mammals the rudimentary disposition of the great omentum is well seen. Thus in the two-toed anteater it maybe observed in its simplest possible condition. It here takes the form of a slight bag projecting towards the left, and formed solely by that part of the primitive meso-gaster which is nearest to the greater curvature of the stomach. It extends to the right as far as the pylorus. It is quite horizontal. Its greatest depth does not exceed an inch, and its orifice is a wide shallow opening upon the right side of the meso-gaster. In higher mammals—as in some marsupials—the great omentum appears as a loose pendulous open bag, with so large an opening that it could not be termed a foramen. (Fig. 601 shows the great omentum in the kangaroo.) In man and in most of the higher mammals not only is the meso-gaster (M-G, fig. 602, A) involved in the bulging which forms the great omentum, but some part of the transverse meso-colon (m-c) becomes involved also. This depends upon the close connection which exists between the right end of the transverse colon and the duodenum. It will be seen from figs. 600 and 602, A, that but a little Fig. 602.-Formation of Great Omentum as seen in Vertical Section. extension of the bulging of the membrane is needed for the transverse meso-colon to become involved. In such case the anterior layer of the great omentum will appear to come off from the greater curvature of the stomach, while the posterior layer will return to the transverse colon and will become continuous with the meso-colon (figs. 602, C, and 603, A). In the adult man this arrangement usually extends throughout the greater part of the width of the great omentum. It is in all instances to be observed in all that part of the great omentum which is about and to the right of the middle line. In the foetus (as in the lower primates) the posterior layer of that part of the great omentum which is quite to the left of the middle line is clear of the transverse meso-colon, and is obviously derived from the meso-gaster solely (figs. 602, B, and 603, B). This difference between the right and the left extremities of the transverse meso-colon and omentum can sometimes be made out in the adult man. The term ' the lesser cavity of the peritoneum ' is applied to the cavity formed by this protrusion of the peritoneum. The term is of use for descriptive purposes, but it is apt to be misleading if it favours the impression that the general sac of the peritoneum is divided into two perfectly distinct parts. If the diagram (fig. 562), which shows a transverse section of the abdomen at the level of the foramen of Winslow, be examined, it will be seen that the posterior1040 THE OBGANS OF DIGESTION layer of the gastro-hepatic omentum, the covering of the posterior wall of ih stomach, the right layer of the gastro-splenic omentmn, and the peritonemn ove the pancreas, are all derived from this so-called lesser sac of the peritonemn.

If figs. 593, 597, and 598 be examined, it will be understood that when the rotatioiTHE DUODENAL FOLD 1041 of the intestine takes place and the colon rises up and crosses in front of the duo- denum, the peritoneum between the meso-duodenum and meso-colon must be folded upon itself. The folding is V-shaped, the apex of the V being placed below, and the plication being in or about the median line. The two membranes on a transverse section would have the relation to one another shown in fig. 598, C. The third part of the duodenum is brought closer to the posterior parietes; the Fig. 605.—Intestine of Macropus penicillatus. COLON peritoneum in connection with it is curtailed; and the relations of the structures around are readjusted As a result of these changes, which can be followed in many ! of the lower mammals, a distinct fold is produced which is connected with the third and terminal parts of the duodenum, and is often of considerable size. This fold can be well studied in Macropus. It appears to come off from that margin of the bowel which is immediately opposite to the attachment of the meso-duodenum Fig. 606.—Duodenal Fold of Macropus penicillatus. j(figs. 605, 606). It ends below in a free edge, and posteriorly it either joins the peritoneum on the posterior parietes close to the origin of the descending meso- colon, or it joins the meso-colon at some little distance from the spine. I The traction about this somewhat firmly held segment of bowel has been such that it has been drawn between the layers of its own meso-duodenum. It is by this [ fold that is formed the wall of the fossa duodeno-jejunalis (page 1002, fig. 572). 3 XSECTION IX THE UBINAEY AND EEPEODUCTIVE ORGANS By WILLIAM ANDEESON, F.R.C.S. SURGtEON TO AXD LECTURER OX ANATOJIY AT ST. THOMAS'S HOSPITAL ; PROFESSOR OP ANATOMY IN THE ROYAL academy; examiner in anatomy to the royal colleges op PHYSICIANS AND SURGEONS. THE KIDNEYS THE fundamental elements of the urinary api^aratus are the kidneys—twoi glandular organs situated in the loins behind the peritoneum, each of whichi is provided with a duct—the ureter—for the passage of the secretion to a reservoir—• the bladder—by which it is periodically expelled from the body through a tube of; outlet—the urethra.

Branches of the renal artery (an irregular branch running be- hind the duct) Renal vein (a lower branch is seen below the duct) DUCT, sliowing superior and infe- rior pelves witla common pelvis and commencement of m-eter proper Physical characters.—The kidney in its typical form is bean-shaped. It is elongated from above downwards, compressed between its parietal and abdominal surfaces, and presents at its anterior and internal aspect a cleft, the hilum,'leading to a cavity, called the sinus, in which lie the renal vessels, nerves, and duct. The \ gland in the male averages about four and three-quarter inches in length, an | inch and an eighth, m thickness and weighs about five ounces. The dimensions !THE KIDNEYS 1043 f the female kidney differ little from those of the male, but its weight is from one- eventh to one-fifth less. In the child the organ is relatively large, but its permanent elation to the body weight is usually attained by the end of the tenth year of life. It offers for description tAvo surfaces, two extremities, and two borders. The nterior or visceral surface is convex, and looks obliquely forwards and outwards ; iie posterior or parietal surface, less convex than the anterior, looks inwards and ackwards; the rounded upper extremity is usually somewhat larger than the nver, and is placed about half an inch nearer to the median sagittal plane of the ody. The external border is narrow and convex. The internal border (or surface), )oldng forwards, inwards, and slightly downwards, is relatively broad, and is ssured vertically in the middle third of its length by the hilum. j The hilum is a slit-like aperture bounded by two rounded lips of variable and jLiequal thickness. The posterior lip is nearer to the middle line than the anterior,, id between the two pass the renal vessels and nerves, the duct, and a quantity of :,t-bearing connective tissue. The sinus (fig. 609), occupied by the structures just kmed, is narrowest near its entrance, and about an inch in depth. Its fundus is Fig. 608.—Diagram showing Eelation of Kidney to Capsule. in SUBPERITONEAL TISSUE FATTY CAPSULE Renal vessels embedded in sulperitoneal tissue prced by the renal vessels and nerves, and by the uriniferous tubules ; and gives £ achment to the primary branches (calices) of the duct. Investment and fixation.—The entire organ is enveloped and supported by a lid of capsule of fat-bearing connective tissue derived from the parietal layer of subperitoneal fascia (fig. 608). The adipose element may be in large or small cintity. In the latter case the investment often appears as a transparent fascial file, which in renal operations may be mistaken for peritoneum, or fascia trans- ^ salis ; or, if the fat be excessively developed, it may form a kind of hernial pttrusion into the parietal incision. Should the sustentacular power of the fatty Cj)sule become impaired from any cause, the phenomenon of movable or wandering l^jiiey is established, the organ tending to shift its place as far and in such flection as the attachment of its vessels to the main trunk will permit. A partial Cjering of peritoneum is loosely adherent to its anterior surface. Position and relations.—The kidney is commonly said to iie in the lumbar ' 3x2THE UBINABY OBGANS 1044 region. It is, however, intersected by the horizontal and vertical planes whicl separate the hypochondriac, lumbar, epigastric, and umbilical regions from eac^ Fig. 609.—Section of Kidney, showing the Sinus.

The only visceral relation posteriorly is on the eft side, where the spleen slightly overlaps the kidney opposite the upper half of its |)uter border. The parietal relations on both sides are as follow : (1) the diaphragm ; Fig. 611.—The Abdominal Viscera, seen from behind. (From the model of His.) The kidneys are somewhat lower than usual in their relations to the ribs. I) the anterior lamella of the posterior aponeurosis of the transversalis (separating lie organ from the quadratus lumborum); yd) the psoas ; (4) tne three fasciae— iaphragmatic, transversalis, and iliac —which line these muscles respectively ; and 5) the last thoracic, the ilio-hypogastric, and the ilio-inguinal nerves, and the anterior ivisions of the first and second lumbar vessels, all running obliquely downwards nd outwards in front of the quadratus lumborum to pierce the transversalis beyond le outer border of the quadratus. Owing to the higher level of the left kidney, i'S diaphragmatic area of contact is larger than that of the right organ. This rea moreover, may be increased on either side wheii the arcuate ligamentsTHE UBINABY OBGANS 1046 which give origin to a large portion of the posterior fibres are attached to the ti of the transverse process of the second lumbar vertebrae instead of that of the firsl The pleura has an indirect but important relation to the kidney. The inferio, limit of the pleural sac extends almost horizontally outwards from the lower borde of the twelfth thoracic vertebra, crossing the last rib near its neck, and the eleventi rib about two inches farther outwards. As a rule, the incision in renal operation! may be carried safely to the lower border of the last rib ; but, should this bone bi absent or very short, the eleventh rib may be mistaken for it, and the seroiii membrane would then be in danger. It is probable too that the pleura reachd to a lower point in those cases where the arcuate ligaments are attached to th second lumbar transverse process. The presence of a thirteenth rib would invoh, a contraction of the space available for the surgical exploration of the organ. i The upper extremity of each kidney is crowned by the suprarenal body (fig. 01' 612), which encroaches also upon its anterior surface and inner border, and is fixtl to it by connective tissue derived from the subperitoneal fascia. 1 The anterior or visceral surface (fig. 612) is differently related on the two side Ficx. 612.- -DlAGRAM SHOWING ANTERIOR EeLATIONS OF KiDNEYS AND Suprarenal Bodies.

The seco: stage of the duodenum is also more or less in relation with the right renal vessel The left kidney lies behind the stomach, the pancreas, the splenic vessels, t descending colon, and the colic vessels. Its anterior surface may be divided in three portions : an upper or gastric area, separated from the stomach by t.j peritoneum of the lesser sac ; a middle or pancreatic area, attached to the pancre by subperitoneal connective tissue, and crossed also by the splenic vein where tt vessel lies behind the upper border of the gland, and by the splenic artery, whi( runs in a serpentine course immediately above the vein ; and an inferior or col ] area, the outer portion of which is covered by the splenic flexure and upper pa ■THE KIDNEYS 1047 of the descending colon ; the inner by a layer of peritoneum (of the greater sac) and the colic vessels. The outer border of the kidney reaches a point about three and a half or four jinches external to the lumbar spinous processes. On the right side, it is in contact jwith the liver in its upper half or two-thirds ; on the left, its upper third or half rests jagainst the renal groove in the posterior portion of the visceral surface of the spleen. I The inner border of the right kidney lies close to the vena cava, especially above; that of the left is divided from the aorta by an interval of an inch or more. The position of the kidneys at the back of the abdominal cavity involves a sertain amount of pressure upon the organs and their vessels and nerves by the weight of the viscera in front when the body is supine, and there is reason to believe that their secretory functions are consequently influenced by changes of iposture to an extent that may be utilised in therapeutics. The structures lying within the sinus are the renal artery and vein, the renal Lymphatics (vessels and glands), a plexus of nerves, the duct, and more or less con- lective and adipose tissue continuous with the fatty capsule. The renal artery s a branch of the aorta given off opposite the first lumbar vertebra and behind the Dancreas. On reaching the hilum it breaks up into four or five branches, which generally lie directly in front of the duct, and behind the vein; but irregular vessels nay pierce the gland above or below the hilum, and a branch of the artery not nfrequently passes immediately behind the duct (fig. 607). The left renal vein j'Bceives the spermatic or utero-ovarian vein, and is usually somewhat lower than ihe right. The shortness of the right renal vein should be remembered in the Operation of nephrectomy. Structure.—The kidney when removed from its fatty investment is seen as a ^ellowish-red organ covered by a thin but strong fibrous capsule (tunica propria), vhich is prolonged through the hilum into the sinus, where it becomes continuous vith the sheaths of the renal vessels, and extends as far as the attachments of he subdivisions of the duct around the renal papilla. The whole capsule may )e easily peeled off from the healthy kidney, except at the bottom of the sinus vhere it is fixed by the vessels and duct; and as the capsular vessels are of small iize, the process of stripping is attended with little haemorrhage when practised ,n the course of operations upon the living subject. ! On section through the hilum the renal parenchyma is found to be made up )f two structural elements, the medulla and the cortex ; the former consisting >i a variable number (eight to eighteen) of conical segments called pyramids of ttalpighi, the apices of which project into the bottom of the sinus (fig. 609) and are urrounded by the primary segments (calices) of the duct, while their bases are urned towards the surface, but are separated from it and from each other by 'he cortex. The pyramids average in their axial diameter about three-quarters if an inch, and have a width at the base of about two-thirds of an inch. They J ire smooth and somewhat glistening in section, and marked with delicate striae t ^hich converge from base to apex, and indicate the course of the uriniferous I iibules. The blunted apex, or papilla, single or in association with one or even wo of its fellows, is embraced by a calyx, and if examined with a hand lens will e seen to present forty or fifty minute apertures, the foramina papillaria, through ^hich the secretion escapes into the duct. The cortex may be divided into two portions : a peripheral layer, the cortex roper, which is a little less than half an inch in thickness, and extends from the apsule to the bases of the pyramids of Malpighi; and processes called columnse tertini, which dip inwards between the Malpighian pyramids to reach the bottom i the sinus, where they are covered by the fibrous capsule and more or less adipose issue (fig. 613). In section the cortex is somewhat granular in aspect, and in an ejected kidney is seen to be dotted with minute points corresponding to vascularTHE UBINABY OBGANS 1048 glomeruli lying within the csecal origin of the uriniferous tubules (capsules of Bowman). Examined more closely, it displays a number of small pyramidal i groups of tubules, some belonging to the cortex proper, with their bases resting j upon the bases of the Malpighian pyramids, the apices directed towards, but not I reaching, the periphery ; others forming a part of the columnae Bertini, and! disposed almost at right angles to the last. These cortical groups are called j pyramids of Ferrein, in contradistinction to the much larger medullary pyramids \ of Malpighi. i The kidney of a foetus differs from that of the adult in the lobular subdivision i of its surface, each lobule corresponding to the base of a pyramid of Malpighi' capped by a thin layer of cortex. Such a condition is permanent in some of the! lower animals ; but in man the superficial indications of morphological segmenta-1 tion usually become obliterated during the progress of growth of the cortical tissue,' and are seldom visible after the age of ten. j Uriniferous tubes (fig. 614).—The secreting tubules commence by a number| of spherical capsules (capsules of Bowman), which lie in the cortex. From each Fig. 613.—Horizontal Section of Kidney, showing the Sinus. COLUMN PYRAMID Cortico- .

The tubes are lined wit | epithelium throughout, the cells being tesselated in the capsule, irregularly cubic?; in the convoluted tubes, flattened on the loops of Henle, and columnar in th' cortical collecting tubes and in the straight tubes of the medulla. ; Vessels (fig. 614).—The kidney is very vascular.

The efferent vessels of the Malpighian glomeruli form a capillary plexus around the uriniferous tubules and terminate in the renal veins. iThe surface of the kidney receives small collateral arteries which pass through the I Fig. 614.—Scheme of Tubules and Vessels of the Kidney. (After Macalister.) fatty capsule from the suprarenal, spermatic, and lumbar vessels. The superficial 7eins appear in the form of little stellate groups (stars of Verheyen), which are kery distinct when the organ is congested. The renal lymphatics may be divided nto two sets, capsular and parenchymatous. They terminate in a series of glands ying with the renal vessels in the subperitoneal tissue, and their contents are liltimately conveyed into the receptaculum chyli. Nerves.—The nerves form a plexus accompanying the vessels, and are derived1050 THE UBINABY OBGANS mainly from the sympathetic through the solar and aortic xDlexuses, the semilmiar ganglia, and the splanchnics. They commmiicate with the spermatic plexuses.! Some filaments have also been traced from the pneumogastrics. Varieties.—The principal variations of the kidney are as follow :— I 1. In form.—Disproportionate increase of one or other diameter, producing the long, globular, and discoid types. ; 2. In size.—Inequality : one being small, the other compensatingly large. 3. In number.—The organ may be single, then usually occupying its ordinary position in one or other loin; or, still more rarely, it may be triple, in which case' the additional gland is either lateral or median. ' 4. In 2)osition.—One or both kidneys may be above or below the normal level, ^ in the latter and far more frequent case encroaching upon the iliac fossa, or even J entering the true pelvis in front of or behind the rectum; or the displacement may! be horizontal, the organ lying upon the vertebral column or even in the opposite loin. | 5. By fusion of the two kidneys ; the union involving the lower extremities only! (' horseshoe kidney'), or the whole length of their inner borders. 6. In mobility.—Undue mobility is usually, if not always, due to a laxity of that portion of the subperitoneal tissue which constitutes the fatty capsule; but a peritoneal meso-nephron is said to have been seen in extremely rare cases ofj movable kidney. THE SUPRAEENAL BODIES These structures do not form any part of the genito-urinary apparatus, but it is convenient to describe them in association with the glands by which they ar supported. The suprarenal bodies (fig. 615) are two solid viscera resting each upon th upper extremity of the corresponding kidney and the adjoining parts of its inner an anterior surfaces, and bound to it by subperitoneal connective tissue. They li against the diaphragm opposite the eleventh rib, or tenth intercostal space, and ar separated from each other by a space of about two inches and a half. The left i usually a little higher than the right owing to the greater elevation of its kidney. The organ varies widely in dimensions within physiological limits. Its averag weight is about a drachni, its height an inch and a quarter, and its greatest breadt" at the base an inch and three-quarters. The right suprarenal body is pyramidal in form with the apex directed upward and someAvhat inwards. Its anterior surface is related above to a special impressio" upon the under and back part of the right lobe of the liver, between the layer of the coronary ligament ; internally to the inferior vena cava which slightl: overlaps it (Rolleston) ; and below is covered with peritoneum continuous with that of the kidney, except at its internal inferior angle where it is crossed by th hepatic flexure of the duodenuin. It is rather firmly adherent to the liver, and th vessels of the two organs anastomose with each other at this point. The left suprarenal body is a little larger than its fellow, somewhat crescenti in shape, and encroaches less upon the summit of the kidney than the right, an: more upon the inner border, reaching even to the hilum. Its anterior surface i covered above by the peritoneum of the lesser sac, which separates it from the stomach; and below, near its internal inferior angle, it is crossed by the uppe' border of the pancreas and the splenic artery. Externally it is in contact withj the upper extremity of the spleen, which passes a little behind it, and its inner! border is separated from the aorta by the fibres of the diaphragm. Accessory suprarenal bodies are often present in the connective tissue around the i principal organ. Structure.—On section the organ is found to be covered by a thin fibrous'1051 THE SUPBABENAL BODIES capsule which sends trabecular processes between the cellular elements of its proper substance. The parenchyma consists of a peripheral portion, or cortex, of yellowish colour, except in its deepest layer which is darkly pigmented, and a central portion or medulla, soft and greyish, and tending to break down under decomposition in such a manner as to give the appearance of an irregular cavity (whence the name suprarenal ' capsule Vessels and nerves.—It is richly supplied both with vessels and nerves. Its arteries are derived from three sources—the aorta, the phrenic, and the renal—and pierce the organ in various places. The veins terminate on the right side in the vena cava, and sometimes by means of small branches in the phrenic and renal trunks ; on the left, in the left renal vein. The lymphatics pass to the renal glands, which, like the suprarenal bodies, themselves contain a good deal of pigment. The nerves come from the solar plexus, and include filaments from the sympathetic, the splanchnics, and according to some authors from the phrenic and vagus also. It is disproportionately large in early foetal life, and has nearly reached its full growth at the time of birth.

At its origin in the sinus renalis it appears m the form of a number of short tubes, usually eight or nine, called calices, each of Avhich embraces the papillary extremity of a pyramid of Malpighi two or three lines above its apex, or occasionally two papillae may be connected with a single calyx. The icalices average about a third to half an inch in length, and open directly or by means of intermediate tubes (infundibula) into two short passages, the superior and inferior pelves, which in turn combine after a longer or shorter course to form the common pelvis. The inferior and larger pelvis has a diameter of about two- fifths of an inch ; the superior is about one-third less. The common pelvis varies greatly in different subjects. It usually appears as a more or less funnel-shaped portion of the canal, wider above (about three-fifths of an inch), where it lies between the two lips of the hilum; narrow below, where it arches downwards and inwards to become continuous with the relatively uniform portion of the duct1052 THE UBINAIiY ORGANS known as tho ureter proper. In sonio cases, however, it can scarcely be said to exist as a dihitation. Under ordinary circumstances it is flattened from licfore backwards, its anterior and posterior walls being in contact, and its channel represented by a fissure. It is in relation behind with the posterior lip of the hilum, from which it is separated by more or less adipose tissue continuous with the fatty capsule, and occasionally hy an irregular branch of the renal artery. The renal vein and artery imbedded in fat lie in front, and anterior to these structures are situated the descending portion of the duodenum on the right side, and the pancreas on the left. The ureter extends from the termination of the pelvis to the bladder, running in a kind of lymph-space between the laminfe of the subperitoneal tissue. It is a tube of about a sixth of an inch in diameter when distended, and is fairly uniform in si/e, except about two inches below the kidney where a slight constric- tion is usually found (Bruce Clark). Its length is variously stated, but the average in the male adult may be taken as about twelve inches. The excessive estimates sometimes given depend upon the untrustworthy indications afforded by admeasure- ment after the removal of the structure} from the })ody. Fio. GIG.— Ui'PKR PoiJTiON OF ])vcT.

The pelvic portion runs in front of the sacro-iliac synchondrosis then upon th(THE BENAL DUCTS 1053 obturator internus and its fascia behind and below the psoas, finally leaving the pelvic wall to join the bladder. In this position, in the male it is crossed superiorly and internally by the vas deferens, and lies under cover of the free extremity of the j vesicula seniinalis, separated from its fellow by a distance of an inch and a half. ! In the female it runs parallel with, and four to six lines from the cervix uteri, behind the uterine artery, through the uterine plexus of veins, and beneath the root of the broad ligament; finally crossing the upper third of the vagina to reach the vesico- vaginal interspace and pierce the bladder opposite the middle of the vagina. A calculus in the lower end of the tube might be detected by a vaginal examination. The vesical portion, about half an inch in length, runs obliquely downwards j and inwards through the coats of the bladder, and opens on to the mucous surface ! at a distance of about three-quarters of an inch to an inch from its fellow, and from the internal urinary meatus. Structure.—The wall of the ureter is about a twenty-fifth of an inch in thickness, and consists of a mucous membrane, a muscular coat, and an external connective tissue investment. The mucous membrane is longitudinally plicated, and is lined with a multiple layer of transitional epithelium, continuous with that of the papillae above, and with that of the bladder below. Mucous follicles are said to exist in the pelvis renalis. The muscularis is about one-fiftieth of an inch in thickness, and consists of two layers, an external composed of annular fibres, an internal of fibres longitudinally disposed. After the tube has entered the bladder the circular fibres appear as a kind of sphincter around its vesical oiifice ; while the longitudinal fibres spread out to form with those of the opposite side a triangular expanse with its apex at the internal urinary meatus and its base corresponding to a line drawn between the two ureteric orifices. Vessels and nerves.—The arteries of the ureter come from the renal, spermatic, internal iliac, and vesical; the veins terminate in the corresponding trunks; and the lymphatics pass to the pelvic and lumbar glands and into the receptaculum chyli. The nerves are supplied by the spermatic, renal, and hypogastric plexuses. Varieties.—The most important variation consists in the partial or complete duplication of the tube owing to the late union or to the non-union of the superior and inferior infundibula or pelves. In rare cases the calices form three pelves which may in like manner remain separate in part or in the whole of their course to the bladder. THE BLADDER The urinary bladder is a receptacle, of which the form, size, and position vary with the amount of its contents. The adult organ in its empty or moderately filled condition lies entirely below the level of the oblique plane of the pelvic inlet; but when considerably distended it rises into the abdomen and shows itself beneath the parietes as a characteristic mesial projection above the symphysis ; a projection which in certain cases may extend nearly to the level of the umbilicus. It is invested over its whole extent by recto-vesical fascia, and is partially covered above by peritoneum (fig. 617). Form.—When fully distended it assumes in the male an ovoid shape with its longest diameter directed downwards and backwards, but in women the transverse diameter is commonly the greatest. In the child it is somewhat pear-shaped, the stalk being represented by the urachus. The form of the empty bladder is still doubtful, as the appearances in the dead subject do not necessarily coincide with the condition existing during life. InTHE UBINABY OBGANS 1054 mesial sagittal section it usually appears somewhat cup-shaped, its upper wall presenting a rounded or pyramidal hollow to the intestines, while its cavity is represented by a T or Y-shaped fissure (as in plate 1 of Symington's ' Anatomy of the Child '). It is possible that this ' diastolic ' form, as it has been termed, is the normal result of a relaxation preliminary to refilling; but it appears more probable that it is due to the loss of vital elasticity of the muscular wall, and that the healthy living bladder always maintains a rounded or ovoid form. Fig. 617.—Median Sagittal Section of the Male Pelvis. (From a preparation in the Museum of St. Thomas's Hospital.) The three terms, ' apex ' or ' superior fundus,' ' inferior fundus,' and ' neck,' are commonly applied to parts of the bladder : the first to the point of attachment of the superior ligament or urachus (a relic of the tube of communication between the bladder and allantois) which connects it with the umbilicus ; the second to the lower part of the organ, and the third to the point at which the vesical cavity becomes continuous with the urethra ; but the expressions are all more or less objectionable, and serve no useful purpose. Uuder ordinary distension the so-called ' apex ' is as much rounded as the rest of the viscus ; the anatomical limits of the ' inferior fundus ' are still undefined ; and the only ' neck ' that can be assigned to the bladder is represented by the prostate and prostatic urethra. Relations.—The bladder when moderately filled may be said to present for description five aspects or surfaces : antero-inferior or pubic, posterior or rectal, superior or intestinal, and two lateral or obturator surfaces. The anterior, posterior,1055 THE BLADDEB and lateral surfaces meet above at the urachus, and converge below towards the base of the prostate—the posterior wall sometimes approaching the urethral orifice almost lin a vertical direction, as in Braune's section (plate 2), or curving first downwards, and then forwards, as in fig. 617; and in old subjects this curve may be so exagge- rated that a kind of pouch is formed behind the internal meatus. The antero-inferior surface looks downwards and forwards towards the symphysis. It is uncovered by peritoneum, but has a strong investment of recto-vesical fascia, and is separated from ohe pubic bones and anterior attachments of the obturatores interni and levatores ini by a space known as the cavum Betzii, which contains a variable quantity of oose fat continuous with the pelvic and abdominal subperitoneal tissue. Each jiateral surface is covered by peritoneum down to the level of a line extending from phe urachus backwards to a point below the summit of the vesicula seminalis, about jin inch above the base of the prostate. Below this level it is separated from the evatores ani by subperitoneal tissue, which usually bears much fat in its meshes iiid ensheaths the vesical vessels and nerves ; and it is crossed by the vas deferens, ind at the point of peritoneal reflexion by the obliterated hypogastric artery. The [ueter pierces the junction of the posterior and lateral surfaces about two inches [ |,bove the prostate, the vas running between it and the vesical wall. External to hese structures the lateral wall is in relation to the levator ani and obturator internus. Phe posterior surface may be divided into two portions, an upper covered by the )eritoneum of the recto-vesical or utero-vesical pouch, a lower in direct contact with Ihe anterior wall of the rectum, and the lower part of the vasa deferentia and vesiculae keminales. The distance of the recto-vesical cul-de-sac of peritoneum from the !)rostate is very variable, but usually ranges between half an inch and one inch, and nay be increased to two inches by distension of the bladder. It is, however, very small n the child. The ureters where they lie at the outer limits of this surface are near 0 though not in contact with the rectum, and a calculus in the lower end of the uinary tube might be felt by an exploration from within the bowel. In the lower )ortion of the posterior wall in the male is a triangular space, the sides of which ;.re formed by the diverging vasa deferentia, the base by the line of reflexion of he recto-vesical pouch of peritoneum, and the apex by the meeting of the ejacula- ory ducts at the summit of the prostate. It was formerly selected as the position or the introduction of a trocar through the rectum into the bladder in cases of etention of urine. In the female the posterior surface is adherent below to the lervix uteri and upper part of the anterior wall of the vagina, but is separated hove from the body of the uterus by a shallow utero-vesical pouch of peritoneum. The superior surface is entirely covered with peritoneum. It looks almost irectly upwards into the abdominal cavity, and lies in contact with the small atestines, and sometimes with a portion of the sigmoid flexure behind these. Effects of distension.—When the bladder becomes excessively full it rises above he level of the symphysis, and in certain chronic conditions of retention may even Qount as high as the umbilicus. During the process of distension the anterior wall arries upwards the peritoneal fold reflected on to its upper surface. This elevation is, owever, variable and limited in extent; at its maximum it seldom exceeds two inches, nid m some instances fails even to pass the upper border of the symphysis, hence [here is some danger in tapping the bladder above the pubes unless the part is exposed |y a careful dissection. In recent years Garson and Pietersen have demonstrated |hat the introduction into the rectum of a bag of suitable dimensions filled with air |r water pushes forward the expanded viscus and may still further increase the |vailable space for surgical operation, but it does not ensure the elevation of the leritoneal fold above the symphysis. The relation of the internal urinary meatus to the pelvic wall has become a nbject of interest since the revival of suprapubic operations upon the bladder. As rule it lies at some point opposite the upper half of the symphysis, but in greatTHE UBINABY OBGANS 1056 distension of the viscus (see Eiiclinger, plate 3) it may descend to a lower level On the other hand, in young children it usually reaches the level of the uppei border of the symphysis, and in old persons with prostatic disease it may rise ever above this point. In the male adult it lies from three-quarters of an inch to aij inch behind the symphysis, and about tAvo or two and a half inches above th(! perinaeum. | Structure.—The bladder wall is composed mainly of unstriped muscular fibre i invested externally by a layer of recto-vesical fascia and a partial covering ol peritoneum, and lined with mucous membrane and submucous tissue. Its thick ness varies greatly in ditferent subjects and in the same subject under differen: conditions of distension. It is estimated at about an eighth of an inch whei' moderately stretched, but may reach half an inch or even more when completer: contracted. It is somewhat thicker at the trigone. The arrangement of the peritoneum over the superior, lateral, and posterior walk has been described, and it only remains to mention that its reflexions over th' urachus above, and from the sides and back of the bladder below, form the superioi lateral, and posterior false ligaments. The recto-vesical fascia is a well-developer Fig. 618.—The Posterior Wall of the Bladder. (After Henle.)

These traditional names, however, are misleadii]' and have no practical value. The muscular coat is composed of unstriped fibn which may be divided roughly into two layers, an outer principally longitudin and an inner plexiform, but tending towards the horizontal direction. The fibr of the outer layer are most distinctly longitudinal on the anterior and poster! surfaces, and extend above along the urachus, but they run obliquely over the sides the bladder, decussating with each other in a complex manner ; and near the urethri end of the viscus two strong bundles of the anterior longitudinal fibres run or on each side of the middle line in front of the anterior wall of the prostate ar beneath the pubo-prostatic ligament, to become attached to the back of the pub; bones on each side of the symphysis (vesico-pubic muscle). The imie^" layer forms kind of annular sphincter near the urethral orifice (sphincter vesicae internus), tki fibres of which are continuous with the upper sphincteric fibres of the prostate, am1057 THE BLADDER it the trigone are reinforced by the expansion of the longitudmal ureteric fibres aamed on page 1053. The rather coarse meshwork formed by the decussating muscular fibres is apt io present weali: points through which the mucous membrane may protrude as iiverticular sacculations, sometimes of considerable size and capable of lodging calculous concretions. On the other hand, when the muscular tissue becomes lypertrophied from excessive use, it often forms strong ridge-like projections which nay give rise to deceptive impressions during exploration of the cavity with the ;ound.

The internal urinary meatus usual-' lies at the most dependent part of the bladder, but in morbid conditions of tl prostate the borders of the aperture may be considerably elevated above the adjacei vesical zone. The female bladder (hg. GIO) presents no peculiarities of importance, except th; its frontal diameter is usually increased at the expense of the sagittal diameter, part in consequence of the greater width of the pelvis, and partly owing to the presenc of the vagina and uterus, which encroach upon the space in the middle lin Lateral asymmetry is very common. Furthermore, the symphysis being of le; depth than in the male, the urinary orifice lies nearer its lower border. In the infant the bladder is said to be an abdominal organ, but this is not strict accurate. The relatively small pelvic cavity at this period of life is occupied main by the rectum, and there is little room for the bladder, which hence rises into tl abdomen even in moderate degrees of distension ; but, as pointed out by Symingto if a line be drawn from the sacral promontory to the top of the symphysis, fully o] half of the bladder will be found to lie below it, and hence within the pelvis. Tl internal meatus, however, is behind the upper margin of the symphysis, and tl whole organ is hence above the horizontal level of the pubic crests. This relati( gradually changes from the period at which independent locomotion begins, till I the age of six, when the pelvic wall has grown up around the viscus, the positi( does not differ materially from that in the adult. It should also be noted th the recto-vesical fold of peritoneum extends in infancy nearly as low as the ba of the prostate. Vessels.—The arteries of the bladder are derived from the internal iliac a] internal pudic, and in the female some twigs are also given off by the uteri: arteries. The veins terminate in the internal iliac trunk. They form plexus which are especially large about the parts adjacent to the prostate, and communica in the male with the dorsal vein of the penis. Lymphatics are few, and are foui mostly in the neighbourhood of the internal meatus. They accompany the vei and terminate in the pelvic glands. Nerves.—The nerves are derived, partly from the sympathetic system throuf the hypogastric plexuses, partly from the cerebro-spinal system through the saci plexus. The former supply the mucosa, the latter the muscularis. i TEE MALE EEPEODUCTIVE CWiGANS ■ I The reproductive organs of the male consist of (1) two testicles or semirB glands, with their excretory tubes ; (2) a musculo-glandular organ, the prostap which provides a material for the dilution of the semen, and by its sphincte:' contraction aids in the ejaculation of the spermatic fluid, and at the same tii| intercepts its retrograde passage into the bladder ; (3) an organ of copulatic [ the penis ; and (-I) a canal, the urethra, which pierces the prostate and penis, a serves for the transit of both the generative and urinary secretions. j THE PROSTATE | The prostate is a firm elastic and contractile organ, lying between the blade " and the penis, and perforated by the urethra (figs. 620, 024, and 049). It f roughly comparable to a horse-chestnut in form and dimensions; its broac jTHE PBOSTATE 1059 I xtremity or base lies uppermost and blends with the vesical sphincter, while its pex rests against the superior triangular ligament. Its long axis is vertical (in erect posture), or inclmes slightly forwards below (fig. 617), and is about an ch and a quarter in length. Its transverse diameter, greatest near the base, easures about an inch and a half, and its antero-posterior diameter about an ch. Its average weight is about six drachms, nearly the same as that of the sticle, and it may be noted that the active evolution of the two organs begins at game period, that of puberty, and that the structural and functional develop- lient of the one is intimately associated with that of the other during the period f sexual vigour. It oflers for description a base, an apex, and anterior, lateral, nd posterior walls. The base is connected with the musculature of the bladder, Ind usually lies a little above the level of the middle of the symphysis. The pex, resting against the superior or deep triangular ligament, is about half an ich behind and a little below the subpubic angle, and on rectal exploration will Fig. 620.— Semi-diagrammatic Section of the Male Pelvis.

The lateral walls are in ntact with the inner borders of the two levatores ani muscles and the marginal P^' Ibrtion of the venous plexus, and project above in the form of ill-defined lobes, iiDCii persistent indication of its development in two halves. The posterior wall is '^i^"* ittened and is opposed to the rectum, from which it is separated by some con- 1™''"^ active tissue and unstriped muscular fibres. Near its upper border is a transverse edian cleft, the prostatic fissure (fig. 624), which extends deeply inwards and rwards towards the middle of the prostatic urethra, transmitting the common jaculatory ducts and the sinus pocularis, and in section (fig. 620) appearing to cut fa portion of the substance of the organ, the so-called ' middle lobe,' from the rest. An irregular artery, usually derived from the internal iliac trunk, is sometimes lund running by the side of the prostate to reach the dorsum of the penis, and may i the source of dangerous haemorrhage in lithotomy. It replaces one or more : the terminal branches of the internal pudic. 3 Y 21060 THE MALE BEPBODUCTIVE OBGANS Structure and function.—The prostate is invested by a fibrous capsule, derived from the recto-vesical segment of the pelvic fascia. The organ itself is composed of muscular and glandular tissue. The muscular element represents about three- fourths of the entire mass, and consists principally of unstriped fibres, continuous above with the vesical sphincter, and forming in the upper third of the organ a ring of great firmness and strength, lying above the urethral orifices of the ejacu- latory ducts, and discharging in all probability the function of intercepting the backward flow of the semen and prostatic fluid into the bladder dufing sexual congress; below this point the muscle is intermingled with gland tissue, and nea: the apex with a quantity of striated fibres which are probably connected with th deep transversus perin^ei. Here it is still of considerable strength, and aids in th forward propulsion of the mingled prostatic and seminal secretions ; the ejaculatio: being further aided by the deep transversus perinaei and bulbo-cavernosi. The glands are of the branched tubular type, and lie chiefly in the posterior an lateral parts of the organ, their ducts opening into the urethral recesses (prostatitf sinuses) by the sides of the verumontanum. They secrete a mucus, the principa use of which is to dilute and give bulk to the semen, and they are sometimes the sea of pathological concretions. In addition to the true glands are seen a number o; simple follicles in the anterior wall of the prostatic urethra, probably of the sami nature as the rest of the urethral follicles. The prostatic urethra will be describei hereafter (page 1074). The organ is essentially generative, and serves also to reinforce the vesi( sphincter, but its absence in the female and its imperfect development in childrei; and eunuchs appear to entail no defect in the control of the bladder. The muscu fibres are, however, to some extent represented in the female (page 1079). Vessels and Nerves.—The arteries of the prostate arise from the adjace: vesical and hemorrhoidal vessels. The prostatic veins receive the dorsal vein cj the penis, and, after forming a plexus investing the anterior and a portion of t lateral surfaces, terminate in the adjacent vesical veins. The lymphatics end i the pelvic glands, and a small gland may sometimes be found on each side near base of the organ. The nerves are derived from the hypogastric plexus. THE TESTICLES AND THEIE APPENDAGES AND COVEEINGS The two testicles lie in a common pouch of integument called the scrotum, an| each organ is invested in addition by a series of coverings which join in the midc line to form a septum scroti. There are three principal layers : an outer (the dartoJ of unstriped muscular fibre, a middle (the cremasteric) containing striped musculgj fibre, and an inner serous (the tunica vaginalis), separated from each other bl layers of connective tissue. The coverings (fig. 621), named from without inwardj are (1) the dartos; (2) the external spermatic fascia; (3) the cremasteric or midc spermatic fascia ; (4) the internal spermatic fascia ; (5) subperitoneal fascia; ai (6) the tunica vaginalis. THE SCROTUM.—The scrotal integument is more or less pigmented, and covere in the adult by coarse scattered hairs. It presents in the middle line a longitudinsj ridge, the raphe, from which start on either side a multitude of transverse wrinklej Its sudoriparous and sebaceous glands are largely developed. (1) The dartos is a thin reddish layer composed of elastic tissue freely inta mingled with unstriped muscular fibres. It is adherent to the deep surface of ti; skin, but passes inward septally between the two testicles, forming a separate si\ for each, and is prolonged over the penis and perinseum. Its fibres for the mo: part assume a direction at right angles to the scrotal wrinkles, of which they a] i the cause. They are always moderately contracted in health, and contract still moi i1061 THE TESTICLES under the influence of cold and of mental emotion, but are not affected by electricity. 'Tbey become relaxed in conditions of general enfeeblement. (2) The external spermatic or ' inter columnar' fascia consists of a fatless, aminated connective tissue, within and closely adherent to the dartos, blending t the external inguinal opening with the strong fibrous bands crossing the columns f the ring, and prolonged, like the dartos, over the ]3enis and perinc^um. It is ontinuous behind with the deep layer of the superficial perinfeal fascia, and above ith the superficial fascia over the symphysis. (3) The cremasteric or middle spermatic fascia is a well-defined fibro-muscular xpansion covering the cord and testicle. It consists of a strong double lamina of reolar and elastic tissue enclosing and connecting longitudinal bundles of striped uscle, the fibres of which may be traced above to the external inguinal ring, here they are divided into three principal sets : an inner, attached to the pubic pine, an outer to that portion of the external oblique which forms the external Fig. 621.—Horizontal Section of the Scrotum and Testicle.

Below, the tunic lends with the dartos opposite the lower extremity of the testicle. The cremaster ntracts during convulsive expiratory actions of the abdominal muscles and under motional influences. (4) The internal spermatic or ' infundibuliform' fascia is a delicate connective ssue derived from the fascia transversalis, and within this will be seen (5) a ■minated prolongation of the subperitoneal tissue closely investing the elements f the cord above the limits of the tunica vaginalis. (6) The tunica vaginalis is intimately connected with the testicle, and will be escribed after that organ (page 1062). Vessels and Nerves.—The skin and dartos are supplied by branches of the xternal pudic and superficial perinasal arteries, while the cremaster receives a pecial branch from the deep epigastric ; the corresponding veins communicate with e pudic, the long saphenous, and the dorsal vein of the penis. The lymphatics rminate in the innermost set of the inguinal glands (the lymphatics of the testicle self passing to the lumbar glands). The nerves are derived from the genito- rural and superficial perinatal. THE TESTICLES.—The testicles (fig. 622), two in number, are suspended from the guinal region by the spermatic cords. The left is supposed to hang somewhat wer than the right in the majority of persons. Each gland consists of twoTHE MALE BEPBODUCTIVE OBGANS 1062 portions, the testicle proper and the epididymis. Its weight as a whole averageii between five and six drachms, rarely attaining the maximum of an ounce ; it is abou| an inch and a half in length, an inch and a quarter in depth (from the anterior td the posterior border), and somewhat less than an inch in thickness. It is so sus pended in the scrotum that its upper extremity inclines a little more forward thai| the lower, and its inner surface is turned slightly forwards as well as inwards. The Testicle proper is shaped somewhat like a kidney bean ; it is elongated froni above downwards, and flattened from side to side. Its surface is smooth and white! and is covered by the visceral layer of the tunica vaginalis, except where it is ii: contact with the epididymis. \ Fig. 622.—The Left Testicle with Vessels and Duct. (After Sappey.) ! •tery is The Epididymis is adherent to the posterior and inferior part of the testicle prope ' and inclines slightly to the outer side. It is enlarged above into a head or globU ' major, and below into a tail or globus minor, the intermediate portion being calle: the body. The Tunica Vaginalis is a serous sac of peritoneal origin, which bears to th ; testicle a relation similar to that of the serous x^ericardium to the heart. It consist; of parietal and visceral layers. The visceral layer is intimately adherent to the testicle proper, and to the globu j major, and outer part of the body of the epididymis, and is prolonged upwards fo j about half an inch upon the spermatic cord. On the outer side and above, i|THE TESTICLES 1063 extends into a deep depression, the digital fossa, between the testicle and epididy- [mis ; but it leaves uncovered nearly the whole of the globus minor and the internal [and posterior surfaces of the body of the epididymis, and it is in these situations that an important vascular communication is established between the gland and its coverings. The iKirietal layer, continuous with the visceral layer at the posterior and inferior parts of the testicle and at the point of reflexion from the spermatic cord, becomes loosely attached to the internal spermatic fascia by means of a prolongation of the abdominal subperitoneal tissue. Under normal conditions the two layers are in I contact, the serous fluid being secreted only in sufficient quantity to moisten the opposed surfaces. An undue increase of the amount constitutes the disease known as vaginal hydrocele. The testicle is occasionally so rotated upon its long axis that the epididymis becomes turned towards the front of the scrotum. In this case, were a hydrocele to occur, the sac would project posteriorly. The side to which a detached testicle jbelongs may be distinguished by remembering that the epididymis is attached behind, and that the digital fossa of the tunica vaginalis lies on the outer side. In order to understand the relations of the organ to adjacent structures it is necessary to learn something of the mechanism of its descent. The testicle is at jfirst an abdominal organ lying below the kidney and invested by a layer of peritoneum (mesorchium) which is firmly adherent to its surface in front and at the sides. It is moreover connected by bundles of unstriped muscular fibres, the gubernaculum Itestis, with the pillars of the external inguinal ring and with the dartos at the [bottom of the scrotum. It begins to descend in the early part of the third month jof foetal life, reaching the internal inguinal ring in the sixth month. It then passes 'obliquely through the structures of the abdominal wall, preceded by a pouch of peri- toneum and pushing before it, in succession, the subperitoneal tissue, an infundibuli- form prolongation of the fascia transversalis, a few fibres of the internal oblique (which form part of the cremaster), and the intercolumnar fascia, which braces, together the pillars of the external inguinal ring. At the eighth month it appears it the external ring, and reaches the bottom of the scrotum shortly before birth. The cause of this migration is still uncertain. The theory usually adopted is. shat the descent is effected by the progressive shortening of the gubernaculum, and m accordance with this view the unstriped muscular fibres connecting the bottom bf the gland with the scrotum are regarded as the remains of the central and principal gubernacular band, while the lateral bands, ceasing to act after the testicle [aas reached the external ring, are drawn down into the scrotum and appear as pcattered groups of fibres, the internal cremaster of Henle, lying amidst the dements of the spermatic cord (fig. 626). The peritoneal sac carried with the testicle is at first continuous with the ibdominal peritoneum. In most cases the tube of communication gradually larrows, and at length, within a few days after birth, becomes entirely closed. Sometimes, however, the process of obliteration is more or less incomplete, should it fail altogether, a portion of the abdominal viscera may pass into the -unica vaginalis, and constitute the congenital variety of inguinal hernia ; or peritoneal fluid may accumulate in the testicular sac, and form a congenital lydrocele. More frequently the continuity of the tunica vaginalis with the )eritoneum is interrupted; but a slender pouch of peritoneum, the processus vaginalis, may run into the inguinal canal, and even through the external ring into :he cord, or the tunica vaginalis may be prolonged upwards upon the cord for a onsiderable distance. Should any portion of the abdominal contents enter the processus vaginalis, t may pass through the inguinal canal as a hernia, and descend into the scrotum, f at the same time the upward extension of the tunica vaginalis be present, the1064 THE MALE BEPBODUCTIVE OEGANS \ i hernia with its sac may pass within it or invaginate it, and a surgeon called upor to operate in such a case would probably open the tunica vaginalis before reaching the peritoneal sac, and thus meet with three layers of serous membrane befor< exposing the extruded intestine. A hernia of this kind is called' infantile.' Cystiij tumours may be formed by the distension of small unobliterated segments of tbj funicular portion of the tube, and are called encysted hydroceles of the cord. | Structure (fig. 623).—The testicle proper consists of a tubular parenchymjj enclosed within a strong fibrous tunic, the tunica albuginea. i The tunica albuginea (figs. 621, 623) is a dense white inelastic capsule of abou; one-sixteenth of an inch in thickness in the greater part of its extent, but reachingj two or three times this admeasurement beneath the epididymis. It is perforated a' its upper and back part by the efferent seminal tubes which go to form the giobuij major of the epididymis, and from its inner surface pass a number of sustentacula;} processes, one of large size called the mediastinum testis or corpus Highmorianum j and a multitude of others in the form of thread-like fibro-muscular filaments an(| delicate septal planes of connective tissue, the trabeculae. The mediastinum extend; forwards from the upper half of the posterior border, occupying about a fourth o' Fig. 623.—Diagram of the Testicular Tubules. the sagittal and a third of the transverse diameter of the interior, and is tunnellet by blood-vessels and a network of seminal tubes (the rete testis). The trabeculsj radiate from the deep aspect of the mediastinum to the inner surface of th| tunica albuginea and subdivide the interior of the capsule into a number of locu] (150-200). \ Within these loculi lie the testicular tubules, supported by a fine retifornj connective tissue which becomes condensed into a highly vascular lamina calle< iliQ tunica vasculosa where it is in contact with the albuginea. The prope secreting substance consists of fine branching canals, the tubuli seminiferi, abou i^th of an inch in diameter, and lined with a layer of cubical cells in which ar developed the spermatic filaments or spermatozoa. The tubules are collected int< little bundles, called lobules, about three hundred in number, each comprising tw< or more separate tubes. These by their union form larger tubes, or tubuli recti which converge towards the mediastinum, and on entering it break up into a plexus the rete testis ; from the rete in turn spring twelve to twenty efferent tubes, or vast j efferentia, twice or three times as large as the tubules, and these, piercing th( upper and back part of the albuginea, end in the head of the epididymis (fig. 623).1065 THE TESTICLES The epididymis represents the second stage in the course of the seminiferous |vessels. The vasa efferentia, after their escape from the testicle proper, form each k tube about six to eight inches in length, lined with ciliated epithelium and coiled In such a manner as to assume the form of a conical mass, the conus vasculosus, Lith the apex towards the albuginea. The coni vasculosi grouped together constitute 'the globus major, and their respective tubules are collected by a single canal, the tube of the epididymis, which by its complex coils, fifteen to twenty feet in length, makes up the body and globus minor of the epididymis, and finally terminates in the free portion of the duct, the vas deferens. It presents near its termination jne or more diverticula, the largest and most constant of which, the vas aberrans Ipf Haller, ranges from an inch and a half to fifteen inches in length, and runs up [between the body of the epididymis and the commencement of the vas deferens, the tube of the epididymis, like those of the coni vasculosi, is lined with ciliated epithelium, but its walls are thick, and contain two layers of unstriped muscular (fibres. Two little bodies of some morphological interest are to be found appended to the testicle proper and the globus major. The less constant of these, known as the hydatid of Morgagni, is a pediculated sac from one-eighth to one-third of m inch in length, dilated at its free extremity and containing a clear fluid; the 3ther, rarely absent, has about the same dimensions, but is usually sessile and iattened, and may be subdivided into two or three lobes. It is believed to correspond :o the upper end of the Fallopian tube, and to be the remains of the Miillerian duct jpage 1094), the foetal structure from which are developed the most important part of the internal genitals of the female. Another relic, called the paradidymis, or organ of Giraldes, probably derived :i'om the Wolffian body (page 1094), is found over the lowest portion of the spermatic I'ord immediately above the head of the epididymis. It consists of coiled tubules, )lind and dilated at both ends, lying beneath the visceral layer of the funicular portion of the tunica vaginalis. It usually has the appearance of a white or rellowish irregular patch about one-fifth of an inch in diameter. Any of these anbryonic structures may give rise to cystic tumours, and the aberrant tubes are )robably not an uncommon source of origin of true spermatic cysts containing leminal fluid. The testicle remains small until the period of puberty, when, together with the )rostate, it begins to undergo rapid development; but in some cases its evolution s arrested before it has attained its full dimensions, and this is particularly liable 0 occur when its descent into the scrotum has not taken place, or when a varicose lilatation of its veins appears before adolescence. In old age it usually loses much )f its functional activity, but this is not invariably the case. The VAS DEFERENS is the continuation of the tube of the epididymis, and extends rem the globus minor to the prostatic portion of the urethra. In the lower part )f its course it is slender and tortuous, but it becomes thicker and straighter as it scends along the back of the epididymis (testicular stage), and attains its full ize before it reaches the top of the organ. From this point it is the principal lement of the spermatic cord, and runs upwards almost vertically as far as the ixternal inguinal ring (funicular stage) ; entering the inguinal canal, it runs I'bliquely outwards, upwards, and slightly backwards to the internal ring (inguinal Ptage). It then quits the associated vessels of the cord, and, winding around the rigin of the deep epigastric artery to the inner side of the external iliac artery and 11 front of the external iliac vein, enters the pelvis (pelvic stage) close to the ilio- ubic suture, and runs downwards and backwards over the side of the bladder, irossing it on the vesical side of the obliterated hypogastric artery and ureter, to |each the side of the posterior wall of the viscus. Here it lies between the bladder jud the second stage of the rectum, and, becoming enlarged and sacculated, passes1066 THE MALE BEPBODUCTIVE OBGANS \ downwards and inwards towards the base of the prostate, where it narrows and : joined by the lower end of the vesicula seminalis. The common tube descend as the ejaculatory duct to open into the prostatic portion of the m^ethra. Tb two vasa deferentia, Avhere they lie in front of the rectmn, are separated by triangular interval, the apex of which is formed by the approximation of tb ejaculatory ducts, and lies immediately above the prostate. The whole of the pelv: portion of the vas is subperitoneal except near its termination, where it is investe only by recto-vesical fascia and an extension of subperitoneal tissue. The enth length of the vas deferens averages about twenty-four inches, of which an inc and a half may be allotted to the testicular stage, three inches to the funicule stage, an inch and three-quarters to the inguinal stage, and the rest to the pelvi stage. It is cylindrical and of uniform diameter (about one-tenth of an inch) i| its funicular, inguinal, and pelvic stages down to the retrovesical portion, an Fig. 624.—Vasa Deferentia and Vesicula Seminales. (After Sappey.) its walls are of great thickness, about one-twenty-fifth of an inch, while its calibre ' extremely small. It is here composed of an outer cellular coat containing vesse and smooth muscular fibres, a threefold muscular coat with external and intern! transverse and middle circular layers, and a mucous membrane lined with cylindrici epithelium. The ampullated retrovesical portion differs from the rest in the thii ness of its walls and in its sacculation (fig. 625). The VESICULA SEMINALES are two diverticular reservoirs situated between tl bladder and rectum external to the ampullae of the vasa deferentia. Each vesicula is of somewhat triangular form, its broad upper extremity lyinl beneath the peritoneum, its apex joining the vas deferens at the base of ttj prostate. It averages about two and a quarter inches in length and half a inch in diameter at its base. It is lobulated on the surface, and on dissectio! is found to consist of a central tube from three to five inches in length, wifeVESIGULA SEMINALIS 1067 ^''^i two or more short lateral branches. It is related in front to the posterior wall ""^oi the bladder, and by its upper extremity overlaps the ureter; jjosteriorly it is ■ bovered by the recto-vesical pouch of peritoneum, for a short distance above ; and ^ V below this point it lies in direct contact with the front of the rectum, and external ■^^ tt b the ampulla of the vas deferens. It becomes constricted at its junction with P^l^ the vas. Structurally it consists of a fibrous external coat; a middle muscular 3oat in two layers, external longitudinal and internal transverse; and an internal nucous membrane, plicated, yellowish brown in colour, and lined with cylindrical epithelium. It is invested, together with the ampulla of the vas, by a kind of jheath of fibrous tissue and by a layer of smooth muscular fibres which is pro- Dably accessory in function to the contractile element of the proper wall of the ubes. calili lilt ■0 Fig. 625.—Vas Deferens and Vesicula Seminalis dissected.

DIVERTICULA DIVERTICULA SACCULI OF AMPULLA OF VAS JUNCTION OF VAS AND VESICUiA EJACULATORY DUCT The EJACULATORY DUCT, formed on each side by the union of the vas deferens id vesicula seminalis, is an infundibuliform tube about three-quarters of an inch length, and about an eighth of an inch in width above, narrowing to one-third that size below, while the lumen near its opening is not more than one-fiftieth of 'uWt ^^^^ diameter. The two ducts converge slightly as they descend, and finally, ssing behind the so-called ' middle lobe,' the hinder part of the basal muscular g of the prostate (page 1060), pierce the prostatic fissure and open on to the rumontanum on either side of the orifice of the sinus pocularis (fig. 624). Vessels and Nerves of the testicle and its appendag^es.—The testicle is supplied th blood by the spermatic and deferential arteries, the two vessels anastomosing th each other and with the scrotal arteries at the lower extremity of the gland, e corresponding veins, spermatic and deferential, form like communications and up in two separate groups. The spermatic veins, large and imperfectly valved,1068 THE MALE BEPBODUCTIVE OBGANS spring from the upper part of the testicle, and, running in front of the deferential veins around the spermatic artery, are connected to each other by means of short transverse branches; finally, the right ends in the vena cava, the left in the left renal vein. The lymphatics of the vas and testicle accompany the veins. The former terminate in the pelvic iliac glands, the latter in the lumbar glands. The free anastomosis between the deferential, spermatic, and scrotal blood-! vessels explains why the ligature or excision of the spermatic veins and artery in \ varicocele leaves the nutrition of the testicle unimpaired; while the intercom-1 munication of the testicular and scrotal blood and lymph vessels behind the| epididymis accounts for the extension of inflammatory affections of the epididymis' to the scrotal integument. ' The Nerves of the testicle come from the aortic, renal, and hypogastric plexuses. | The vesicula seminalis is supplied by the deferential, inferior vesical, and; middle haemorrhoidal arteries: its lymphatics end in the pelvic glands, and the | nerves are derived from the hypogastric plexus. | SPERMATIC COED ' i The spermatic cord is the elongated pedicle of the testicle. It extends from the internal inguinal ring, where its component structures are collected together, through the inguinal canal, and into the scrotum as far as the summit ol ■ the testicle. Its constituent elements are as follow (fig. 626). ' Fig. 626.—Section of the Spermatic Cord. (After Henle.) ^ ----^^ —-Internal cremaster \ 1.

THE PENIS The penis is composed of three rod-like segments of erectile tissue, firmly [mited together and invested by a sheath composed of integument, dartos, and jascia (fig. 627). Of these three erectile segments, two, the corpora cavernosa, are placed side by side above or dorsally; the third, the corpus spongiosum, is perforated in the whole length by the urethral canal, and lies on the ventral aspect of the former, except Ivhere it expands distally to form the free end of the organ (fig. 628). f I The penis as a whole may be divided into a root, a body, and a terminal j enlargement or glans ; the root is attached to the symphysis and pubic arch ; the I )ody, prismatic in section with rounded angles, forms the greater part of the !ree portion of the organ; and the glans is a heart-shaped expansion, more leveloped on its dorsal than on its ventral aspect, and presenting the urethral rifice at its distal extremity. The body and glans are separated by a constriction ialled the neck. The coverings of the penis are continuous with those of the testicle. The skin,, ike that of the scrotum, is pigmented, fatless, and highly elastic. It contains large^ ebaceous glands, which in the neighbourhood of the neck of the organ secrete a^ is^hitish fatty odorous substance, the smegma prseputii. It moves freely upon the jubjacent parts except over the glans, where it is firmly adherent. At the neck it [ecomes peculiarly redundant, and forms a fold, the prepuce, which more or less ompletely conceals the glans. The deeper layer of the duplicature, which is turned owards and is continuous with the skin of the glans, is sometimes erroneously lermed ' mucous membrane.' A small median plication, the frsenum prseputii, jxtends from the prepuce to the lower surface of the glans. This contains vessels of Jome size, and, if ruptured, may give rise to considerable loss of blood.i I 1070 THE MALE BEPBODUCTIVE OBGANS The dartos is continuous with the dartos tissue (page 1060) of the scrotum, and \ consists of smooth muscle, the fibres of which are for the most part disposed! longitudinally. It enters into the formation of the prepuce, and according to Sappey 1 forms a kind of sphincter around the preputial orifice. Beneath the dartos is a i loose connective tissue very liable to infiltration in inflammatory or dropsical con-1 ditions and in urinary extravasation. Within this lies the fascial sheath of the! penis, a complete and highly elastic tunic investing the entire organ as far as the \ base of the glans, where it fuses with the integument. The suspensory ligament \ of the penis is a strong band of fibrous tissue which passes from the front of thej symphysis to the subjacent portion of the organ, blending with the fascial sheath i in the middle line and at the sides. The angle of the penis corresponds to the I most anterior point of suspension to the symphysis. The corpora cavernosa constitute the dorsal and larger part of the penis. They are closely united in the greater part of their extent, but separate for a short distance j in front and diverge somewhat widely behind. The posterior extremity of each,, called the crus penis, at first enlarges slightly, but tapers as it approaches the subpubic arch; then, becoming tendinous and somewhat flattened, is strongly' attached to the ischio-pubic rami; and the distal end, pointed somewhat like the tip of a cigar, is plunged into the substance of the glans (fig. 628). The entire length of the corpus cavernosum averages about six inches, and its breadth about Fig. 628.—Transverse Section of the Penis through the Base of the Glans. C0RP8S SPONGIOSUM Integument half an inch, but it increases in size by one-third or more when its vascular spaces are fully distended. In structure it consists of a sponge-like erectile tissue invested by a strong; sheath or tunica albuginea. The sheath is about a line in thickness, white,; remarkably tough, and consists of two laminae, an external, of longitudinal fibres common to both corpora cavernosa; and an internal, of circular fibres surrounding: each corpus and forming a mesial septum pectiniforme where the two corpora; cavernosa come into contact. The framework of the cavernous structure is formed. by a reticular arrangement of fibro-muscular trabecular bands, starting from the inner surface of the albuginea and becoming more slender as they approach the! axis of the body. The branches of the supplying artery run in the trabeculse and < terminate by opening into the anastomosing intertrabecular spaces which represent the widely dilated capillaries of the organ. The corpus spongiosum lies in the middle line and below the united corpora; cavernosa. Unlike the latter it has no direct attachment to the pelvic bones, but j terminates at each end in a bulbous expansion. It may be divided into a glans.; a body, and a bulb. The anterior enlargement, or glans, is somewhat heart-shaped, its base extending ) much farther over the dorsal than over the ventral aspect of the corpora caver- j1071 THE PENIS inosa, and showing a distinct indication of division into two lateral lobes in the ilatter situation. The most prominent part of the base is called the corona glandis, and the furrow behind this is the neck of the penis. At its tip it presents a vertical fissure about one-third of an inch in length, the external urinary meatus or outlet of the urethra. The glans is composed of erectile tissue with coarse trabeculse, and is covered with a firmly adherent layer of skin continuous with the inner layer of the prepuce. Its capacity for vascular engorgement is much less than that of the corpus spongi- josum, and it never attains a like degree of hardness during erection. 1 The body of the corpus spongiosum is cylindrical, uniform in diameter, and Fig. 629.—The Male Perineum.

BULBO-CAVERNOSUS Superficial triangular ligament ISCHIO-CAVERNOSUS Muscles of thigh INFERIOR PUDENDAL NERVE SUPERFICIAL PERIN.EAL NERVE^ INFERIOR HJLMORP^EOIDAL NERVE 'UTANEOUS BRANCH OF FOURTH SACRALl Sphincter ani Gluteus maximus TUBEROSITY OF ISCHIUM G-reat saero-sciatic ligament 'Levator ani Superficial transversus perinsei traversed axially in its whole length by the urethra ; it is lodged above in a groove letween the two corpora cavernosa, while its ventral aspect is subcutaneous except /here it corresponds to the attachment of the scrotum. Structurally it is provided -'ith a thin albuginea, between which and the urethra lies a narrow layer of erectile issue. 1 The bulb is formed by an expansion of the erectile structure, and the portion of he urethra by which it is traversed undergoes a well-marked dilatation, and lies Barer its upper than its lower surface. It is about an inch and a half in length, nd its greatest width is about three-quarters of an inch. It is surrounded by the ulbo-cavernosi muscles, the greater part of the fibres of which pass between itTHE MALE BEPBODUCTIVE OBGANS 1072 and the corpora cavernosa to blend together in the middle line; and it rests posteriorly against the superficial triangular ligament about half an inch in front of the anus. It is liable to considerable enlargement after middle age. Muscles.—The muscles of the penis are three on each side—the ischio- cavernosus, the bulbo-cavernosus, and the superficial transversus perinfei (fig. 629).| The ischio-cavernosus (erector penis) arises from the inner surface of the I tuberosity and ramus of the ischium, from the pubic ramus, and from the adjacent| root of the crus penis, and is inserted into the surface of the tunica albuginea of the corpus cavernosum near the point of attachment of the suspensory ligament. A slip, the compressor venae dorsalis, is occasionally detached from its more distal portion, and becomes inserted into the fascial sheath of the penis over the dorsal vessels, or may blend with its fellow in a narrow tendon in this situation. The bulbo-cavernosus (accelerator urinae) arises from a median raphe which I extends from the anterior extremity of the sphincter ani along the whole length of the bulb as far as the level of the symphysis. A few of its more posterior fibres pass outw^ards to become inserted into the superficial triangular ligament and into the bulb, and a bundle of its most anterior fibres may, like the similar slip from the ischio-cavernosus, form a sling around the corpora cavernosa and become attached to the fascial sheath of the penis, or it may be inserted into the side of the, corpus cavernosum itself. In the former case it acts as a compressor of the dorsal' vein. The rest of the fibres pass around the bulb to become lost in the connective tissue on the dorsal aspect of the latter, between it and the corpora cavernosa; the two muscles thus practically encircle the bulb, and act as an annular sphincter upon the contained portion of the urethra. It is often joined by fibres from the sphincter ani and deep transversus perin?ei. The superficial transversus perinaei is the most variable of all the perin^eal ; muscles. It usually arises from the inner surface of the tuberosity and ramus of; the ischium, blending with the origin of the ischio-cavernosus, and passes inwards; and forwards to its insertion into the tendinous centre of the perin^eum, interlacing I with the posterior fibres of origin of the bulbo-cavernosus. Some of its fibres may blend with those of the sphincter ani and levator ani. ' These three pairs of muscles possess each a tliin fascial sheath, and lie in the I superficial perineal interspace between the fascia of Colles and the superficial! triangular ligament. They are supplied by branches of the deep division of the superficial perinasal nerves and vessels. | The action of the penile muscles is not very obvious. The compressores venae: dorsalis when present may aid in erection by impeding the return of venous blood' from the organ, but there is no reason to believe that any disadvantage attaches | to their absence. The bulbo-cavernosus, with its fellow, is however of value as ai compressor of the bulbous portion of the urethra, and thus assists in the ejaculation, of the semen, continuing the action of the ejaculatory fibres of the prostate and of I the deep transversus perinaei; and it may also be of service in expelling the last: drops of the urine. The compression of the vessels of the bulb favours the engorge- i ment of the rest of the corpus spongiosum. ; The ischio-cavernosus in the absence of its dorsal fasciculus can scarcely justify; its older name of erector penis, but it appears to have the power of impressing; voluntary movements upon the turgid organ. The superficial transversus perinaei j is accessory to the bulbo-cavernosus, fixing the raphe from which its fibres arise, and it adds slightly to the strength of the muscular floor of the pelvis. jTHE UBETHBA 1073 THE UEETHRA The urethra is the mucous canal extending from the bladder to the extremity of !he glans penis. In its course it pierces the prostate from base to apex, the deep ,nd superficial triangular ligaments with the intervening compressor urethrse, and he whole length of the corpus spongiosum. It may hence be divided into three egments :—(1) Prostatic ; (2) membranous (the portion lying in the space between he two transverse ligaments); and (3) spongy (fig. 630). Fig. 630.—The Male Urethra, cleft dorsally to show Ventral Mucous Wall. 3 Z1074 THE MALE BEPBODUCTIVE OBGANS I ! Its average length is still variously stated by different authorities, but the inves- I tigations of Cazenave and Sappey, confirmed as they are by the frozen sections of I Braune and others, set the matter at rest so far as the physiological condition is j concerned. In the ordinary relaxed state of the penis the distance between the internal and external meatus does not usually exceed six inches and a half, and may be less than this when the organ is contracted to its minimum degree. But I under the test of catheterism the length of the canal is undoubtedly greater, and ■ may reach seven or eight inches or even more, owing to the traction upon the I penis which accompanies the operation. The canal may be greatly lengthened' also by senile hypertrophy of the prostate, which carries the internal meatus upwards | towards the level of the top of the symphysis. i The diameters of the passage are scarcely capable of accurate measurement.; In the ordinary condition it is represented by a fissure, and its limits of safei dilatability can only be approximately calculated. Otis's investigations showi that these limits are wider than was formerly believed to be the case, and he| has endeavoured to establish as a law that there is a ratio between the maximum; circumference of the canal and that of the penis, of four to nine. Thus a penis having in its ordinary state a circumference of thirty-six lines should possess a urethra capable of admitting an instrument of sixteen lines. The sources oi fallacy in such an observation are not inconsiderable, but they do not destroy itg value as a practical guide to the surgeon. The prostatic portion is about an inch and a quarter in length, wider ir the middle than at the two extremities, and perpendicular in direction, or slightl} inclined downwards and forwards. Its anterior wall is concave both in longitudina and transverse sections, and is studded with the orifices of small mucous follicles ' the posterior wall presents a longitudinal ridge called the coUiculus seminalis o:' verumontanum, highest near the middle and gradually diminishing above anc ; below. A little above the centre of the colliculus may be seen a rather largi j opening which leads to a cul-de-sac of especial interest for the morphologist, th(| sinus pocularis or uterus masculinus, and on the lateral margins of the onM of the sinus are seen two small puncta, one on each side, the openings of tb j i ejaculatory ducts. The sinus pocularis and ducts may be traced upwards ani| backwards through the prostatic cleft and behind the sphincteric fibres whic^i constitute the prostatic bar or middle lobe of the prostate. | In consequence of the presence of the colliculus the urethral fissure appears o:: horizontal section as a U-shaped curve with forward convexity. The recesse^ « corresponding to the extremities of the U are sometimes called the prostatic sinusef: t and into these open the orifices of the posterior and lateral prostatic glands. J The mucous membrane of the prostatic urethra is lined with a laminated epi thelium. Beneath this is a layer of erectile tissue which constitutes the principf j element of the colliculus, and is in turn supported by a layer of longitudinal muscL | The sinus pocularis is believed to be the homologue of the uterus. It is aboi i half an inch in length, and terminates by a blind slightly dilated extremity. Itj walls consist of connective tissue intermingled with smooth muscular fibres, an i covered with laminated epithelium. It contains a few simple or compound glandi in which small concretions are occasionally found. | The membranous portion, bounded above and below by the superior an- inferior triangular ligaments, is from half to three-quarters of an inch in lengtbj it is inclined downwards and somewhat forwards, and lies about an inch behind tlj subpubic ligament, from which it is separated by the muscular fibres of the de€ transversus perinsei and a plexus of veins. The posterior wall is shorter than tl anterior, owing to the convergence of the two triangular ligaments as they pai j backwards to unite with the posterior border of the fascia of Colles. It is close, related on either side to Cowper's glands.1075 THE UBETHBA The mucous membrane resembles that of the prostatic urethra in its epithelium, Irectile layer, and muscularis, but surrounding these structures is a strong annular and of unstriped muscle continuous with the fibres of the prostate and forming sphincter of considerable power. This in turn is supported by the striated fibres f the deep transversus perin^i. The glands of the mucous membrane, simple nd racemose, form suite with those of the anterior wall of the prostatic canal. The spongy portion extending to the extremity of the penis presents two dilata- } ons with an intermediate portion of narrow but uniform dimensions. The posterior xpansion (pars bulbosa) lies in the bulb, and is about an inch in length ; the anterior •ossa navicularis) is of nearly the same extent, and is situated within the glans. 'he penile angle, formed where the flaccid organ falls from the point of suspension fc the pubic region, lies about two inches in front of the superficial triangular Igament; and the portion of the canal behind this is almost horizontal in direction, at with a slight upward concavity (fig. 617). The mucous membrane of the spongy urethra resembles that of the more osterior part of the canal in possessing a laminated epithelium, a muscularis lucosae with fibres longitudinally arranged, and an intermediate layer of erectile ssue. There is, however, at itie distal extremity an inflexion of the integumental )vering of the gians for a distance of about a quarter of an inch, and the tie of demarcation between the cutaneous and mucous structures is well defined, he external meatus is represented by a vertical slit about a quarter of an inch in ingth, and is the least dilatable part of the canal; hence in urethral operations ! is sometimes necessary to enlarge it by incision. ' An examination of the mucous surface will show a number of orifices directed irwards, the lacunae (sometimes called ' glands of Littre '), connected with simple fUicular invaginations of various depth. One of the number, termed the lacuna agna, usually found upon the dorsal wall about an inch from the external eatus, is of large size, and may arrest the point of a small instrument during 'btheterism. In addition to these are many simple and compound mucous glands, ich as appear in the prostatic portion of the canal; and the ducts of Cowper's ands open into the anterior portion of the bulb on the ventral wall, j! As already mentioned, the collapsed urethra is represented by a fissure. This the glans penis is vertical in direction. A short horizontal branch is superadded the upper end of the fossa navicularis, giving the fissure the aspect of an verted T. Above this point the horizontal limb progressively elongates, while the 'I'tical limb shortens until the former alone is left, and the rest of the spongy rethra is represented by a transverse fissure. In the membranous segment the tssure is usually stellate, while in the prostatic region the presence of the colliculus Ives it the U-like form already described. This progressive change of shape volves a kind of rifling of the tube, and probably accounts for the spiral form of e normal stream of urine. The muscularis mucosae appears to be capable of a peculiar vermicular contrac- tu by which a catheter left within the urethra is gradually expelled, and an 1 ample is known in which an elastic instrument carelessly tied in situ found its |iy during the night, in the reverse direction, into the bladder, and formed the icleus of a calculus. The female urethra is described on page 1079. 3 z 2I I 1076 THE FEMALE BEPBODUCTIVE OBGANS THE FEMALE ORGANS OF GENERATION The female genitals may be divided into (1) an external part, the vulva, repre- sentative of structures found in a more highly developed condition in the male; (2) a vaginal passage, the cavity of which appears as a fissure in its ordinary condition, but is capable of very great dilatation ; and (3) an internal apparatus comprising the organs of ovulation (ovaries) v/ith their ducts, and a musculo-mucous j sac (uterus) in which the ovum undergoes development, and by which the foetus is I ultimately expelled. The vagina and internal organs are intrapelvic. | Fig. 631.—The Exteknal Genitals of the Female. | IN -CORPUS CLITORIDIS -LABIUM MAJUS -LABIUM MINUS -HYMEN The VULVA consists of a pair of integumentary folds, the labia major a; tw(, smaller folds, the labia minora; a small penile appendage, the clitoris ; and a shor , passage, the vestibule, leading to the vaginal orifice. The vestibule is flanked or. either side by an erectile body, the bulbus vestibuli, and pierced in the middle lin(' by the urethra (fig. 631, 632). The labia majora correspond morphologically to the scrotum in the male They are two folds of integument about three inches in length, continuous abov( the symphysis, with an eminence called the mons Veneris, and meeting below ir, a posterior commissure, or fourchette, about an inch in front of the anus. Eacl; labium has two surfaces : an outer, pigmented and covered with strong crisp hairs ' an inner, in contact with its fellow, smooth, presenting only rudimentary hairs but beset with large sebaceous follicles. The fissure between the two labia, callec, the rima pudendi, is horizontally placed in the erect posture. !THE VULVA 1077 The structures forming the labia resemble those of the scrotum, but the dartos imperfectly developed, and each labium contains a well-defined encapsulated subcutaneous mass of fat, of somewhat ovoid shape, which blends above with the iistal extremity of the round ligament. A similar mass is occasionally found in the Imale scrotum as a fatty tumour of the cord, and may simulate an inguinal hernia. The labia minora, or nymphse, are folds differing from the labia majora in their !;elatively small size and in the absence of fat. The two plications unite above, 3mbracing the clitoris and forming the prseputium clitoridis ; below, they diverge md terminate opposite to or a little behind the middle of the rima genitalis. They ire smooth and hairless on the surface, usually of a pale rose colour, and their free border, which projects for a very variable distance, is convex and often crenulated br lobed. They are usually concealed by the labia majora, except in the foetus ; but are sometimes largely developed, and may project beyond the genital fissure, Fig. 632.—Diagrammatic Kepresentation of the Perin^eal Structures IN the Female. ihen assuming a dry pigmented aspect. The sebaceous glands are large and occupy )oth surfaces. j The vestibule is the space between the labia minora and the vaginal orifice. Its boundaries are ill defined posteriorly, and the term is used with different signi- ficance by different anatomists. Opening into it are the urethra, the glands of Bartholin, and the orifices of a number of lacunae. The glands of Bartholin probably represent Gowper's glands in the male, but are more superficially placed. They are two little racemose glands, about a ihird of an inch long, situated one on either side beneath the lateral wall of the t/estibule and behind the bulbi vestibuli. The duct, about three-quarters of an nch in length, opens immediately in front of the vaginal orifice opposite its meridian. Vessels.—The vulvar structures are supplied by branches of the external and Internal pudic arteries. The veins end in the corresponding trunks, and there is ipi addition a free anastomosis with the veins of the round ligament in the pubcutaneous fat of the labium. The lymphatics terminate for the most part |Ln the inguinal glands, a few passing to the femoral glands. About the vaginalTHE FEMALE BEPBODUCTIVE OBGANS 1078 orifice is a neutral territory in which the vulvar and vaginal absorbents inter! communicate. I The erectile structures of the vulva correspond morphologically to those of tht male organ ; the corpora cavernosa are represented by the clitoris, and the corpu spongiosum, cleft in the female by the vulvar orifice, appears beneath the mucou membrane of the vestibule in the form of two vascular plexuses, one on each side called the bulbi vestibuli (fig. 632).

The crura are supportec dorsally by a suspensory ligament, and are attached to the ischial rami in the sani' manner as in the male. The clitoris is relatively smaller in the adult than in the child, and is almos always concealed within the rima pudendi. It is a highly sensitive organ, and i capable of erection. ^ The bulbi vestibuli are two erectile bodies of somewhat pyriform shape, lyin^, one on either side of the vestibule beneath the mucous membrane. The large]THE GLITOBIS 1079 extremity of each is posterior and extends backwards nearly to the posterior commissure, touching the gland of Bartholin. The narrow anterior extremity, the pars intermedialis of Kobelt, runs forwards to meet its fellow of the opposite side beneath the clitoris. Superiorly, it is fixed to the superficial triangular ligament of the perinseum, while it is in relation internally to the urethral and vaginal orifices, and externally is invested by the fibres of the bulbo-cavernosus. It consists of erectile tissue, enveloped by a thin tunica albuginea. During the condition of engorgement it helps to narrow the vestibular portion of the vulva and the entrance of the vagina. The vessels and nerves of the clitoris and bulbi vestibuli are the same as those of the analogous parts of the male. The muscles appended to the erectile structures again are very similar to those 1 described in connection with the penis. The iscMo-cavernosi are identical in I attachments with the erectores penis; but the bulbo-cavernosi are separated in jj the middle line by the vulvar fissure, and appear on each side as a delicate, and sometimes very indistinct, plane of muscular fibres, called the constrictor vaginse, attached behind to the tendinous centre of the perinseum, and breaking up in front into tendinous slips which run in close external relation to the bulbi vestibuli, and become lost above and below the clitoris. Their function is to compress the bulbs and to constrict the vestibule and vaginal orifice. The transversi perinsei j have the same connections as in the male. j THE URETHEA (fig. 633).—The female urethra represents only the upper part of the male canal. It is similarly related to the superior and inferior triangular liga- ments, but is deficient in the sphincteric and glandular structures supplied to the I male urethra by the prostate. It is about an inch and a quarter in length, and is [directed upwards and slightly backwards to open into the bladder about three- quarters of an inch behind the middle of the symphysis. Its posterior wall is in con- tact with the vagina, and it is surrounded in front and at the sides by a plexus of veins (plexus of Santorini). The posterior margin of the meatus usually presents a tubercular prominence by which the position of the orifice may be distinguished during catheterism. As in the male urethra, the narrowest portion of the canal is the external meatus, but the whole tube is sufficiently dilatable in most cases to allow the careful intro- duction of the finger while the patient is under an ansesthetic. A case is recorded by William Cowper (1697) in which, as a result of an imperforate condition of the [hymen, it became the channel of sexual congress. In structure it consists of a mucous membrane presenting a few lacunae and some rudimentary glandular follicles, and a muscular coat divisible into external circular and internal longitudinal layers, both intermingled with fibres of elastic tissue and with large venous plexuses which may undergo varicose dilatation near the external orifice and form a pile-like tumour. It is surrounded by a muscular sphincter composed of striped and unstriped fibre corresponding to the deep transversus perinsei in the male, and partly perhaps to the musculature of the prostate. THE VAGINA The vagina is a passage which extends upwards from its external opening at the vestibule, and terminates above by embracing the neck of the uterus. Its vulvar aperture is guarded in the virgin by a fold of mucous membrane called the hymen. Form and direction (figs. 633, 634).—In its ordinary condition the vaginal I canal is represented by a fissure which in horizontal section assumes the form of the letter H, with a transverse limb about an inch in length and two short ; vertical limbs (fig. 633). In longitudinal section (fig. 633) the fissure branches above,1080 THE FEMALE BEPBODUCTIVE OBGANS a short limb (occasionally ill-marked or absent) passing in front of the anterior lip of the OS uteri, a much longer limb extending behind the os to end about three- quarters of an inch above the extremity of the posterior lip. The angle of reflexion of the vaginal on to the uterine mucous membrane is called the fornix. The direction of the passage is upwards and slightly backwards, forming an angle of 10° to 15° with the long axis of the body, and usually presenting a slight posterior concavity adapted to the convexity of the rectal ampulla ; the course and direction, however, vary with the degree of pelvic inclination peculiar to the individual, and to some extent with the condition of the bladder and rectum. The two walls are of very unequal length, the anterior measuring about two inches and a half, while the posterior is prolonged upwards an inch further. Relations.—Anteriorly, it is opposed to the urethra and posterior wall of the bladder. It is intimately united with the lower two-thirds of the urethra, but is separated from the upper third and from the bladder by loose connective tissue continuous with the subperitoneal fascia. The ureters pierce the vesical wall in Fig. 634.—Horizontal Section of Vagina and adjacent Structures. (After Henle.) URETHRA- Levator ani.

The dudi of Gartner, a relic of the Wolffian duct, may occasionally be found by the side o: the upper half of the vagina as a minute tube or fibrous cordc Two orifices whicl (1081 THE VAGINA jopen into the vagina near the meatus, sometimes called Skene's tubes, are regarded by some morphologists as the terminations of Gartner's ducts, i The lower end of the vagina pierces the triangular ligament, and it is here that the resistance to dilatation is greatest. The inlet may be temporarily narrowed by the engorgement of the bulbi vestibuli, or by the action of the constrictor vaginae, [and perhaps also by that of the levatores ani. The mucous surface of the vagina presents on the anterior wall a median longitudinal ridge or carina, and on the posterior wall two ridges, the columnae rugarum, from all of which pass a number of transverse rugae. These markings ,diminish in distinctness with advance in age and with successive parturitions. The hymen has been a subject of much speculation amongst the learned and imlearned of all ages. Its very existence was at one time denied by many great luthorities, and the significance to be attached to its presence or absence is still I question in medical jurisprudence. It appears in the virgin as an imperfect septum pierced by an irregular aperture which usually reaches to the anterior L^aginal wall, and leaves a fold of semilunar form behind. It varies greatly in 'strength and elasticity, and although it is nearly always ruptured by the first act of ;exual congress, it may remain unbroken until parturition. An imperforate con- lition of the membrane is occasionally present, and may necessitate a surgical j)peration at the commencement of the menstrual period. Structure.—The vaginal wall is composed of three coats, fibrous, muscular, and nucous, and has a thickness of one-eighth to one-sixth of an inch. The outer ibrous coat is derived from the recto-vesical fascia, and holds in its meshes a )lexus of veins. The muscular coat comprises two layers of strong unstriped ibres, the outer longitudinal, continuous above with the uterine muscle and with ihe utero-sacral ligaments ; and the inner circular and more largely developed near jhe vulvar aperture. The mucous membrane presents the plications described, and is of a pale rose int in periods of quiescence, but becomes turgid during the catamenial period and n pregnancy. It is highly elastic, beset with papilla and covered with a squamous aminated epithelium continuous with that of the os uteri and vulva. Vessels and Nerves.—The arteries are derived from an inferior branch of the iterine and from the internal iliac, communicating below with branches of the xternal pudic ; they run along the lateral aspect of the passage and give twigs to he anterior and posterior surfaces. The veins, similarly disposed, form a rich i etwork in the muscular and mucous coats, and terminate in the vaginal and uterine Irunks. The lymphatics accompany the veins and terminate in the pelvic glands, I few from the neighbourhood of the vestibule, however, reaching the inguinal lands. A small gland is occasionally found between the rectum and vagina. The Nerves come from the hypogastric plexus, the fourth sacral, and the pudic. i THE UTEEUS The uterus, or womb (figs. 635-638), is a hollow muscular organ lined with jmcous membrane. It communicates above with the two Fallopian tubes, and below ith the vagina, and lies within the pelvic cavity between the bladder and rectum, jixed in its place by folds of peritoneum and certain bands of unstriped muscle. I varies greatly in size and form at different periods of life and under different tiysiological conditions. The adult uterus is flattened from before backwards, pyriform in its outlines hen seen from the front, and is divided into two main portions, body and cervix, IJ a transverse constriction, the isthmus. The isthmus may be regarded as the eak point in the organ, and it is here that the various pathological flexions take1082 THE FEMALE BEPBODUCTIVE OBGANS place. Its position in the virgin uterus is about midway between the two extren ties, but it lies near the junction of the middle and lower thirds in women who ha) Fig. 635.—The Female Organs of Generation.

The Jei,f4 ipi^avaginal zone, representing about one-half of the neck behind and two-thirds 0 front, is in relation anteriorly with the bladder; posteriorly it is covered withTHE FEMALE BEPBODUCTIVE OBGANS 1084 i the peritoneum of the anterior wall of the pouch of Douglas, and at the sides i is connected with the broad ligament, in which lie the uterine vessels and th ureter, the latter at a distance of a little over half an inch. The zone of vagina attachment is obliquely set, extending higher behind than in front, and has depth of about one-fifth of an inch. The intravaginal zone, or os uteri, i covered with mucous membrane continuous with that of the vagina. It present the external aperture of the uterine cavity, usually in the form of a transvers fissure, about a quarter of an inch in length, bounded by two prominent labit anterior and posterior, both of which are in contact with the posterior wall of th vagina. The anterior lip is the thicker, the shorter, and the lower; the posteric lip is longer on account of the greater height of the posterior vaginal fornix. Afte childbirth the labia usually become notched and irregular. Dimensions.—The size of the uterus varies within wide limits. Its averag length in the nulliparous adult is about three inches, and its greatest breadth aboi an inch and a half, but in women who have borne children these dimensioi] are about one-fifth greater. Its weight averages seven drachms in nullipara, nii: to twelve drachms in multipara. Direction.—The direction of the uterine axis is undoubtedly variable, and it : probable that observations made after death are open to misinterpretation. ] appears to coincide under ordinary circumstances with the long axis of the bod;| both in the recumbent and erect postures, but may be inclined forwards to tfc: extent of 15° or 20° when the bladder is empty, or may be deflected to the rigl w^hen the rectum is full. Variations in form according to age.—In young children the body is bv slightly developed in proportion to the cervix, and the prominence of the intr; vaginal segment is relatively great. In the virgin uterus of a young adult tl length is about equally divided betiveen body and cervix, but after childbirth ti l body never returns to its original size, and its length when involution is comple j is nearly double that of the neck. In old age the entire organ undergoes atrophy i The cavity of the uterus is reduced to a fissure by the antero-posterior flattenii of the walls. It is divisible into two segments, that of the body and that of tl neck. The shape of the cavity of the body is that of a triangle with concave sid (in the virgin) and three open angles. At the two superior angles are the orific of the oviducts, and the lower angle presents the os uteri internum or apertu of communication with the neck. The walls are smooth, and moistened wit mucus. I The cavity of the neck is fusiform, terminating in the os internum above, ar I in the os externum below. The superior opening is circular, the inferior usual ! in the form of a transverse fissure. The mucous lining of the anterior and posteri' walls presents ridges which bear some resemblance to those of the vagina, but a dependent upon the arrangement of the innermost layers of the muscular wall, ai not upon a simple plication of the mucous membrane. The whole length of ea( wall is traversed by a longitudinal nearly median ridge or stem, from which pa a number of branches in an outward and slightly upward direction. T] figure formed by these folds is designated by the name of arbor vitcB uterina ; it ■ most marked in the young, and tends to effacement after repeated parturitior j The cavity usually contains a plug of alkaline mucus. ] Structure.—The uterus is composed of three coats—an outer sero-fibrous, | middle muscular, and an inner mucous. The serous membrane covers the upp j half or two-thirds of the anterior surface, the whole of the supravaginal portion j the posterior surface, and the summit. The lower portion of the anterior wall | separated from the bladder by cellular tissue continuous with the subperitonej fascia, and a thin layer of the same structure may be demonstrated over the lowj part of the posterior surface and laterally into the base of the broad ligament (j I i1085 THE UTERUS either side between the two peritoneal lamina. Owing to this disposition of the sub- 3erous tissue, the whole of the cervix uteri may be amputated without encroaching ipon the peritoneal cavity. The muscular coat constitutes the greater part of the thickness of the organ. The arrangement of the fibres is very complex, but a fairly satisfactory division nto three layers may be demonstrated :—a thin outer layer, longitudinal in iirection, continuous with the muscular fibres of the oviducts, vagina, round, 3varian, and utero-sacral ligaments, and with the muscular expansion in the broad jligaments ; a middle layer, circular in direction, very thick, and intermingled with [large venous plexuses in the body of the uterus, the innermost strands forming [sphincteric rings around the os internum and around the orifices of the oviducts?; |ind a thin internal layer, longitudinal in the body, and producing the ridges of the irbor vit^e in the cervix. The mucous membrane of the body is smooth and pale, pierced by innumerable inbular glands, and lined with cylindrical ciliated epithelium. The ciliary motion |[S from within outwards.

Ligaments.—The so-called ligaments of the uterus are of two kinds, peritoneal md muscular. The peritoneal ligaments are six in number : two lateral, two anterior, and two 'osterior. The lateral or broad ligaments (fig. 639), called also alae vespertilionis from heir fancied resemblance to the wings of a bat, are formed by a duplicature of >eritoneum extending from the sides of the uterus and vagina transversely out- wards to the sides of the pelvis. The two layers of peritoneum are continuous above ^nd form the free border of the fold, but diverge laterally and below, where they )ass on to adjacent structures. Each ligament presents two surfaces and fourTHE FEMALE BEPBODUCTIVE OBGANS 1086 borders. The superior or free border is represented by the summit of the plication i which turns around the oviduct and follows a sinuous course towards the side o j the pelvis, its outermost extremity lying external to the fimbriated extremity of th(i Fallopian tube and forming a sharp fold, the ligamentum infundibulo-pelvicum' which conveys the ovarian vessels. The internal border is attached to the sides oi the uterus and vagina, the two laminpg separating to transmit the utero-vagina \ vessels, and muscular bands, which pass from the uterus into the peritoneal fold' The inferior border is attached to the levator ani and recto-vesical fascia ; it; laminae are separated by fat-bearing cellular tissue (subperitoneal) which give;: passage to vessels and nerves and to the ureter; and the anterior layer is mucli shorter than the posterior, owing to the higher level of its point of reflexion.

The posterior peritoneal or recto-uterine ligaments are two serous folds which im backwards from the intraperitoneal portion of the cervix uteri and vagina to ecome continuous with the peritoneal investment of the second stage of the 3ctum. They form the lateral boundaries of the pouch of Douglas, and between j^oi |ieir layers lie muscular utero-sacral ligaments, comparable to the expansion in (;] f pe broad ligaments, with loose connective tissue and a number of anastomosing ranches of the uterine and haemorrhoidal vessels. The anterior peritoneal or utero-vesical ligaments are two ill-defined folds khich pass one on each side from the cervix uteri to the bladder. The muscular ligaments lying between the peritoneal folds are four pairs :1088 THE FEMALE BEPBODUCTIVE ORGANS three in the broad ligaments, the round or utero-inguinal, the utero-ovarian, and * the ntero-pelvic, and one in the posterior ligaments, the utero-sacral. They have I already been briefly referred to. \ The round or utero-inguinal ligament (fig. 639) is a cord, about five inches in | length, attached to the uterus just below the Fallopian tube, and there continuous ! with the superficial uterine fibres. From this point it runs obliquely downwards, i outwards, and forwards, immediately beneath the anterior layer of the broad i ligament, to reach the pelvic wall; it then loops around the curve of the deep j epigastric artery on the inner side of the external iliac artery, and enters the inguinal | canal at the internal ring. In its course through the canal it is supplemented by a I set of striped fibres, some derived from the muscular walls of the abdomen, others | apparently of independent origin ; and it may be accompanied by an invagination of j peritoneum, the canal of Nuck, which is constant in the foetus and not infrequently i persistent during childhood and even adult life. The ligament then gives off a few of its newly acquired striped fibres to the pillars of the ring and to the pubic spine, and, emerging from the external ring, finally breaks up into a number of delicate I fasciculi which become lost amongst the interlobular connective tissue of the large! pad of fat which occupies the labium majus. \ In structure it is composed of unstriped muscle with areolar and elastic tissue, ] reinforced in the inguinal canal by striated muscular fibres and funicular vessels • and nerves. The funicular artery, conveyed by the round ligament, is a branch of the superior vesical. It is accompanied by a plexus of veins, and anastomoses in' the labium with branches of the external pudic, and at the superior angle of the! uterus with the uterine and ovarian. The utero-sacral ligaments (fig. 641) are flat muscular bands, extending from the highest part of the cervix uteri, where they are more or less continuous with the uterine fibres in the recto-uterine peritoneal folds, to the sides of the sacrum opposite the lower border of the sacro-iliac synchondroses. They run one on each side of the rectum near the junction of the first and second stages of this portion o' the intestine, closely connected with its muscular coat, and more anteriorly are ' lateral relation with the pouch of Douglas. The utero-pelvic ligaments (fig. 641) are the expansions of muscular tissu already described in connection with the broad ligament. They radiate from the fasci over the obturator internus to the sides of the uterus and vagina, and ensheath the utero-vaginal vessels and nerves. The utero-ovarian ligaments (fig. 639), or ligaments of the ovaries, are shoi rounded cords continuous with the uterine fibres at the superior angle of the organ behind the Fallopian tube, and joining externally the inner end and attached; border of each ovary. These various ligamentous structures all serve to main-ij tain the normal position of the uterus. In addition, the utero-ovarian ligament ( aids in the fixation of the ovary, and the round and utero-pelvic ligaments forn]| protective sheaths for vessels and nerves. THE FALLOPIAN TUBES OK OVIDUCTS The Fallopian tubes (fig. 639) represent the upper extremities of the Miilleria' ducts, and may probably be regarded as cornua uteri both in structure and morpho logy. They are two trumpet-shaped tubes structurally continuous with th superior angles of the uterus, and running between the two layers of the bro~ ligaments to become closely connected with the ovaries, partly by direct attachment, partly by a peculiar contiguity. Each duct opens internally into the uterine cavity, and its external orifice establishes a continuity between the tubo-ovarian mucou: membrane and the peritoneum, but under normal circumstances is closely applieTHE FALLOPIAN TUBES 1089 ;o the surface of the ovary, and receives the ova which are detached from the gland, iransmitting them to the uterine cavity. It is about four and a half inches in ength, straight, narrow, and somewhat cord-like at its uterine end for a distance )f about an inch and a half; flexuous, and irregularly dilated in the rest of its ength as far as its free extremity, where it becomes expanded into a trumpet- ;haped mouth, fringed by a circle or circles of diverging villous processes or fimbriae, !)ne of which, the fimbria ovarica, or tubo-ovarian ligament, is attached to the )uter extremity of the ovary. One or two little cystic pediculated appendages, like |he hydatid of Morgagni in the testicle, may also be appended to the mouth. The Iperture (ostium abdominale) in the middle of this expansion is very small, not acre than half a line or a line in diameter, but its mucous membrane may be rolonged for some distance along a furrow in the tubo-ovarian ligament. The narrow extremity, or isthmus, has a diameter of about an eighth of an ich, the dilated portion or ampulla measures about a fifth of an inch, and the 3rminal expansion exclusive of its fringes has a width of about a quarter to a tiird of an inch, the free fimbriae ranging in length from two-fifths to three- fths of an inch, while the fimbria ovarica attains an inch or even two inches, ccessory fimbriated extremities are occasionally met with.

PAROVARIUM AMPULLA OF FALLOPIAN TUBE FALLOPIAN TUBE EXTERNAL ANGLE OF UTERUS Ligament of ovary- Anterior peritoneal lamina 1 Position.—The normal position and direction of the ovary is still doubtful, and je course of the duct necessarily shares in this uncertainty. There is, however, reason ■ believe that it does not assume in the living subject the position represented anatomical diagrams. This will be referred to in the description of the ovary. Structure.—The tube has four coats—serous, cellular, muscular, and mucous, le serous coat, represented by the fold at the free border of the broad ligament, incomplete, like that of the small intestine, the muscular tunic being uncovered peritoneum for about one-fourth or one-fifth of its circumference along the te of attachment of the two serous lamina, and hence a rupture of the duct may d to an escape of its contents either into the peritoneal cavity or into the inter- i :ous space. The cellular coat is a kind of adventitia, rich in vessels, and continu- (s with the subperitoneal tissue of the broad ligament. The muscular coat, about h sixtieth of an inch in thickness, consists of circular and longitudinal fibres ; latter for the most part sparingly distributed outside the former, but near the 4 A1090 THE FEMALE BEPBODUCTIVE OBGANS outer extremity of the tube appearing also as an innermost layer. The circula layer is most attenuated near the fimbriated extremity. The mucous membrane i ■ characterised mainly by its plications. The folds are longitudinal in direction, an relatively simple in the isthmus, where the cavity appears as a stellate fissure whe cut across ; but in the ampulla the multiplication of surface is very complex, and i a transverse section presents a deceptive appearance of branching tubular gianc' within the depth of a thick mucosa. At the fimbriated extremity of the tube, tb plications are continued on to the fringes. The epithelium is cylindrical an cihated, the motion being towards the uterus. At the trumpet-shaped extremity passes by transition into the pavement epithelium of the serous membrane. TI subepithelial tissue contains a longitudinal vmscularis mucosce. THE OVARIES The ovary (fig. 635) is a paired organ which projects strongly from the posteri- surface of the broad ligament. Its longest diameter averages an inch and a half, i greatest breadth about three-quarters of an inch, its thickness about half an incl and its weight is ordinarily about 100 grains. The right is usually a little larg than the left. Form, position, etc.— The typical shape resembles that of a broad almon In anatomical preparations it appears as a horizontal appendage to the back of t • broad ligament with an anterior attached border, a posterior free border, superi] and inferior surfaces, an inner extremity connected with the utero-ovarian lig ment, and an outer extremity receiving the fimbria ovarica of the Fallopian tub it is most probable however that the position is different when the organs are situ under normal circumstances. Symington in his examination of frozen sectio in children found the ovary lying in a sagittal plane against the side wall of t pelvis with its long axis nearly vertical, so that its surfaces were internal and extern its borders anterior and posterior, and its extremities upper and lower, while t Fallopian tube ran upwards along the anterior attached border of the gland, tb arching backwards above its upper extremity to end in the fimbriaB; and where t fimbriae are fully developed they may embrace the posterior free border, and th the tube is wound almost completely around the gland, leaving only the late surfaces exposed. The external surface is said to lie against the pelvic wall ii hollow between the internal iliac artery and vein. The organ when enlarged n: be felt through the vagina, and, better, through the rectum, and its position w regard to the surface is indicated by a point about two inches to the inner side the anterior superior spine of the ilium. The surfaces and free border are of a cl white, and after puberty are scarred by breaches of surfaces due to the dehisce] of ripe ova ; the attached border is pierced by the ovarian vessels and nerves wh lie between the layers of the broad ligament, and their point of entrance is tern the hilum. i Structure.—The ovary consists of a parenchyma and a kind of capsule, ' tunica albuginea. The latter, unlike the tunica albuginea of the testis, i^ / modification of the stroma of the gland, and does not exceed the two-hundred-a: fiftieth of an inch in thickness ; it is covered with an epithelium (column ] differing in character from that of the serous membrane with which it is connect [ The true gland-structure is a mass of connective tissue and unstriped muscle i vessels and nerves. It s very vascular in the neighbourhood of the hilum, wh ! the veins are peculiarly large and closely set, and is condensed into a kind of cor f beneath the albuginea.

The majority of the ovisacs are microscopic, but as they ripen and approach the irface they increase in dimensions, and may even attain the size of a large white arrant. Their rupture leads to the scarring already mentioned, and the empty cap- ile slowly disappears when impregnation has not occurred; but, under the influence [ the vascularisation of the organs during pregnancy, it may undergo a remarkable levelopment and form a yellow plicated body known as the corpus luteum.

These anastomose with their llows across the middle line, one larger branch opposite the junction of the body Qd cervix, forming with the corresponding vessel of the other side the ' arterial rcle of Huguier.' Finally they communicate at the upper angle with the terminal vigs of the ovarian and funicular arteries. The uterine veins are of very large ze, and on leaving the uterus form a plexus in the muscular tissue of the road ligaments, at length joining a trunk which runs side by side with the artery ) end the internal iliac vein. The ovarian artery, arising from the aorta (like the spermatic in the male), 4 A 21092 THE FEMALE BEPBODUCTIVE OBGANS crosses the common iliac artery, and is conducted into the broad ligament by the ligamentum infundibulo-pelvicum (page 1086), which extends to the outer end of the oviduct. It breaks up into two divisions : (1) The kcbal, which runs along the lower border of the oviduct where the peritoneal layers of the tube separate, and sends numerous branches to it; and (2) the ovarian proper, a large serpentine vessel which gives off many large branches into the hilum of the gland, and tber passes to the angle of the uterus, where it ends by anastomosing with the uterine! and funicular arteries. j The ovarian veins, very largely developed about the hilum of the ovary | appear as a plexus in the broad ligament, and, reaching the margin of the plexus j assume a pampiniform arrangement around the artery. The right ends in thd vena cava, the left in the renal vein. | The funicular artery is an offset of the vesical. It joins the round ligameni at the internal ring, and divides into ascending and descending branches, th(' former running backwards in the substance of the ligament as far as the angL of the uterus, where it communicates with the ovarian and uterine ; the latte i passing with the ligament through the inguinal canal into the labium, theri anastomosing with the external pudic. It is accompanied by its vein. The lymphatics (fig. 643) of the uterus and Fallopian tubes form plexuses inth mucous membrane, in the muscular walls, and beneath the peritoneum. Those of th ovary originate in the perifollicular tissue around the Graafian vesicles, and escape at the hilum. The efferent vessels from these three organs may be divided inti three groups with intercommunicating territories. (1) The first, including those o the body of the uterus, those of the ovary, and those of the Fallopian tube, unite b; the side of the ovarian vessels and run with the veins to terminate in the prevertebra, ganglia in front of the aorta and vena cava ; (2) the second, those of the cervix uter: form two trunks which run along the base of the broad ligament with th uterine vein to end in the pelvic glands which lie beneath the bifurcation of th iliac artery ; (3) the third, those of the round ligament, follow this structure an( end in the inguinal or lower iliac glands. Here as elsewhere the lymphatics ar collateral with the veins. The nerves of the uterus are derived from the third and fourth sacral, the hype I gastric plexus of the sympathetic, and from the renal plexus, which also supplie the ovaries and oviduct. i DEVELOPMENT OF THE GENITO-UBINABY OBGANS I There is at first a period in the growth of the embryo during which there is no indica jl tion of any provision either for the generative or for the urinary function. A little late i I the rudiments of a genito-urinary apparatus are laid down, but there is as yet no appeai jl ance of sexual differentiation. Finally, a third stage in the formative process is occupie |l by the evolution of the organs characteristic of the masculine or feminine type, and th I completion of the glandular and other structures which provide for the secretion, storage || and ultimate expulsion of the urine from the body. It will be seen that in the course c'l these developmental changes certain of the structures concerned appear and assume theij permanent characters gradually and without alteration of plan; others, originally employe; for purposes unconnected with the genito-urinary system, become adapted to take their plac ! in this section of the economy; others belonging to the system from the first are brouglj into a special condition of functional activity only to undergo conversion to a different us later on; while others again may, according to the sex assumed b^^ the foetus, either dwindli into useless relics without ever taking any share in the work of the body, or may becomij elaborated into important and efficient parts of the reproductive organism. The earliest appearance is that of a tube called the Wolffian duct, which opens b its hinder extremity into a cloaca or common outlet for the intestinal and urinarf passages. From the fore part of this duct is devdoped a temporary organ, thj pronephros, or head-kidney, in the form of vascular glomeruli. Behind this soon appear j number of tubes, which open at right angles into the mid portion of the duct, and constitutfDEVELOPMENT OF GENITO-UBINABY ORGANS 109B e mesonepliros, mid-kidney, or Wolffian body. Still farther back, from the posterior end of 6 duct, springs the metanephros, or hind-kidney, a mesoblastic growth around a hollow anching protrusion from the duct, with which tubules and glomeruli subsequently come connected. The pronephros quickly disappears in the higher vertebrates; the esonephros, which reaches its maximum development by the sixth week, soon ceases to scharge its renal function, and either becomes a useless relic in the broad ligament of the male pelvis, or undergoes transformation into an essential part of the male generative iparatus; while the metanephros becomes developed into the permanent kidney, le ureter and uriniferous tubules probably originate as special outgrowths from the sterior part of the Wolffian duct. The morphology of the suprarenal body is somewhat ubtful, but it is probable that the medulla is a derivative of the sjanpathetic system, and nee of epiblastic origin; while the cortex is a mesoblastic development in connection with e fore end of the Wolffian duct. It is at first larger than the kidney, but the latter iiains an equal bulk by the tenth week, and then continues to increase, becoming (Qsiderably the greater by the end of foetal life ; but even at birth the suprarenal bodies ;|e proportionately much larger than in the adult.

OF URETERS OF MULLERIAN DUCT PENIS CLITORIS The urinary bladder appears in the second month as a transformation of the pedicle of allantois, a structure which has already done service in conveying the vessels of the ei^ryo to the placenta. The allantois is a hypoblastic sac invested by a layer of mesoblast, commimicating with the hind gut. That portion of it which Kes within the body )mes dilated at its central part into the minary bladder, but remains narrow at both emities, forming in front the urachus; and behind, the whole urethra in the female, the upper part of the prostatic urethra in the male. The generative apparatus is developed from the Wolffian ducts and from two other Bd structures closely related to these, but of somewhat later formation—the Miillerian iS and the genital glands. From the Wolffian body ics tubules and its duct are formed, in the male, the whole of thjexcretory tubes outside the body of the testicle, namely, the vasa efferentia, the coni ;ulosi, the tube of the epididymis, the vas deferens, the ejaculatory duct, and the jtdidymis (the organ of Giraldes). In the female the structure dwindles away, leaving i^estiges as the parovarium and the duct of Gartner (the latter being occasionally onstrable in the human subject).1094 THE UBINARY ORGANS The genital gland arises as a ridge, partly mesoblastic aiid partly due to a thickening o an epithelial layer, the germinal epithelium, on the inner side of the Wolffian body. Th cells, at first indeterminate, soon become differentiated to form the Graafian follicles and ov in the female, and the epitheliimi of the seminiferous tubes in the male; the rest of the ovar or testicle being developed from the mesoblast of the ridge. The gland is at first attache to the Wolffian body. The latter is itself fixed to the posterior wall of the abdominal cavit by a duplicature of peritoneum called the mesorchium, or mesovarium, from which a little fo] I containing muscular fibre is prolonged downwards to become the gubernaculum testis in th male, or, after connection with the uterus, the round ligament in the female.

It becomes canalised and opens distally into the cloaca. After a ti it fuses with its fellow mesially a short distance above the terminal aperture, and the ci ■ joint tube is bound together with the adjacent Wolffian ducts into a kind of stem called ; genital cord. In the male the Miillerian duct never appears to discharge any function, f its useless relics are to be traced in the sinus pocularis and hydatid of Morgagni; but ji the female it gives rise to nearly the whole of the internal apparatus of generation; > upper extremity, above the line of fusion in the human subject, forming the oviduct and * hydatid appendage, the conjoint tube developing the uterus and vagina. Variations |t the point of fusion of the two ducts may lead to the abnormality of a two-horned utei I, or even a double uterus and vagina. Exceptionally MiiUer's duct may form a rudiment ' uterus in the male. In such cases the testes are weU developed, but the penis rema} very small. i The external genitals are developed about the cloacal outlet common to the gen: !■ urinary- and intestinal canals. The first change is the appearance of a genital eminer i,DEVELOPMENT OF GENITO-UEINABY OBGANS 1095 the future clitoris or penis, at the ventral extremity of the cloacal fissure about the fifth or sixth week. A fortnight later the cloaca is divided by a transverse septum into ;wo parts, a dorsal or anal, and a ventral or uro-genital (uro-genital sinus) ; the septum tself persisting as the perinseal body in the female, and the portion of the perinseum lying between the scrotum and anus in the male. Its absence or incomplete development accounts for certain congenital malformations well known to teratologists. The uro-genital sinus next undergoes changes which give the external stamp of sex. At first the urethra 3pens into the sinus behind the genital prominence. In the female this remains perma- lent, the lips of the sinus expand into the labia majora; two ridges within the sinus, Extending one on each side as high as the genital prominence, form the nymphae ; and a little semilunar fold at the entrance of the vagina shows itself in the fifth month and becomes the hymen; while the genital eminence ceases to enlarge and remains as the Fig. 646.—Development of the Urino-generative Organs, Male Type. (After Henle.) IC URETHRA SPONGIOSUM CAVERNOSUM cHtoris. In the male the evolutionary processes go farther. The margins of the uro-genital sinus fuse in the middle line to close in a prolongation of the urethra on the ventral aspect of the genital eminence and to form the scrotum, the process being concluded about the fifteenth week ; finally, a pouch of peritoneum makes its way on each side through the abdominal wall into the corresponding half of the scrotum, and into this the testicle I ultimately descends, guided by the gubernaculum (page 1063). The glands of Cowper [or Bartholin in both sexes are formed by involutions of epithelium near the root of the rudimentary clitoris or penis. Should the process of mesial fusion fail, the urethra may present a fistulous opening on its ventral side, or ma,j remain cleft from the meatus upwards for a greater or less distance.THE UBINARY ORGANS 1096 In the more aggravated forms the defect of union involves the scrotum also, and leads to a spurious hermaphrodism in which is perpetuated a superficial resemblance to the female genitals, the simulation being made greater by the imperfect descent of the testicles, j All these congenital defects are clearly accounted for b}^ ascertained facts in morphology'; but there is a malformation which our present knowledge does not satisfactorily explain— that known as ' extroversion of the bladder,' in which a non-closure of the ventral parietes below the umbilicus coincides with a fissure in the anterior wall of the allantoic bladder, { and leads to an extrusion of the posterior wall of the viscus. Mr. Shattock suggests that the condition is perhaps the result of an undue extension forwards of the cloacal fissure; but the problem cannot yet be regarded as solved. THE PERINyEUM \ i The term perinseum (Trept, vatui) has been variously applied by anatomists— i firstly, in its original and general meaning, to the soft parts connected with the pelvic outlet; secondly, to the anterior or genito-urinary segment only of these parts ; and thirdly, to the tissues separating the vulvo-vaginal and ano-rectal passages. It is here employed in the first and broader sense, the expression ' perinsemn proper' being used for the second application, and that of ' perinseal body ' for the third. The outlet of the pelvis is a lozenge-shaped space bounded in front by the symphysis and subpubic ligament, behind by the tip of the coccyx, and on each • side by the conjoined rami of os pubis and ischium, the tuber ischii, and the inferior border of the great sacro-sciatic ligament. The latter structure is overlapped to a variable extent by the gluteus maximus, which also covers the tuber ischii when the thighs are extended ; but the glutei are merely accessory to the true boundaries. The dimensions of the outlet in the male and female are given in page 156. The further anatomy of the parts differs in the two sexes. THE MALE PEEIN^UM The integument of the perinseum is pigmented, beset with scattered hairs, and its sebaceous and sudoriparous glands are largely developed. Its deeper layers contain an abundance of smooth muscular fibre continuous with the dartos of the scrotum, and these are so disposed around the anal margin as to corrugate the skin into radiating folds during their contraction. The landmarks of the region are for the most part well-defined. The symphysis in front is obscured by the root of the penis, which may be traced backw^ards as a soft median prominence as far as a point an inch anterior to the anus. On each side the pubic and ischial rami may be felt running outwards and backwards to expand into the ischial tuberosity, which is uncovered by the gluteus maximus when the thigh is flexed. Extending backwards and inwards from the tuberosity may be detected, in thin subjects, the resistance of the great sacro-sciatic ligament; and still more posteriorly the coccyx is felt in the middle line immediately beneath the skin. The anal aperture, surrounded by radiating furrows, lies a short distance in front of the coccyx, and on each side of it is a depression called the ischio-rectal fossa, the superficial aspect of which depends upon the amount of fat ^ which occupies it. The perinaeum is divided arbitrarily into two parts by a line drawn transversely between the two ischial tuberosities an inch in front of the anus. The anterior portion is called the perinaeum proper, the posterior the ischio-rectal region. This line, however, does not coincide exactly with the true anatomical boundary as i revealed by dissection.THE MALE PERINEUM 1097 The iscMo-rectal region comprises the parts surrounding the anus and the ichio-rectal fossae. The removal of the integument exposes the sphincter muscle of the anus in the liddle line, and on each side, between this and the lateral boundary of the perinaeum, lie external aperture of the ischio-rectal fossa. The sphincter ani externus is a voluntary muscle surrounding the anus, and ttached, in front to the tendinous centre of the perinseum (where it meets the bulbo- ivernosi, the superficial transversi perinsei, and some fasciculi of the levatores ani); ehind to the tip of the coccyx. Its fibres are closely connected with the skin, and jciperficial bundles pass forwards by the sides of the anus, a few decussating with I Fig. 647.—The Male Perineum.

It is supplied by the inferior htemorrhoidal branches the internal pudic artery; its veins, of large size and very liable to varicoseTHE UBINABY OBGANS 1098 dilatation, terminate in the pudic vein ; its lymphatics open into the inguinal glands; and its nerves are derived from the perinaeal, the pudic, and the fourth sacral. Action.—The external sphincter, by virtue of its elasticity, gives some passive aid to the internal sphincter in maintaining the closure of the anus and the retention of the contents of the rectal cul-de-sac under ordinary conditions ; but its active and more important function is to close the anal aperture firmly during the contraction of the levatores ani and other constrictor muscles of the abdomino- pelvic cavity in powerful muscular efforts not connected with defaecation (as in! vomiting,urination, parturition, expiration, etc.). This it effects partly through the' approximation of the opposite sides of the anus by its longitudinal fibres, and partly by the ring-like contraction of its circular fibres. It also aids in flexing the coccyx, and in fixing the tendinous centre of the perinaeum during the contraction; of the bulbo-cavernosi. : 1 THE PELVIC FASCIA. AND MUSCLES : In order to understand the constitution of the ischio-rectal fossae and their' relation to adjacent parts, it is necessary to review the muscular elements of the pelvic wall, and the arrangement of the pelvic fasciae. Fig. 648.—Diagram of the Pelvic Fascia. The osseo-ligamentous framework of the walls of the true pelvis is constituted by the two ossa innominata below the ilio-pubic line and posterior border of th( pubic crest, by the sacrum and coccyx, and by the sacro-sciatic, sacro-iliac, and interpubic ligaments, and the obturator membrane. Supplementing these structure on each side of the median line, are four muscles : the obturator internus, the pyri formis, the coccygeus, and the levator ani, together with their fascial investments The obturator internus and pyriformis have already been described (pages 375 \ ^11). The fascia covering the inner aspect of the former muscle bears a ver; important relation to the intrapelvic structures. The obturator fascia (figs. 648, 650) is attached above to the iho-pubic line 'PELVIC FASCIM AND MUSCLES 1099 las far back as the sacro-iliac joint and to the posterior Hp of the crest; beloiu, to the back of the symphysis, the inner lip of the lower border of the ischio- pubic ramus, and the inner border of the ischial tuberosity; and behind it skirts I the osseous border of the great sciatic notch as far as the ischial spine, but at the lesser sciatic notch passes out of the pelvis with the muscle, and appears in the post-femoral region of the thigh. At its borders it is closely related to the fascia iliaca above, the fascia of the pyriformis behind, and the deep triangular ligament below. Its outer surface is in contact with the muscular fibres of the obturator internus ; its mner surface is divided into two portions by a curved band of fibres called the ' white line ' or arcus tendineus, extending from the inner surface of the ischial spine to the back of the os pubis, a little external to the symphysis. The upper or pelvic segment above the white line is separated from the pelvic viscera by subperitoneal tissue; the lower or ischio-rectal segment, below the line, enters into the formation of the outer wall of the ischio-rectal fossa. This portion forms a sheath (canal of Alcock) for the pudic vessels and nerves about an inch above the inner margin of the tuber ischii. The fascia gives off from its inner surface at Fig. 649.—Muscles of the Floor of the Pelvis. the white line two thin laminae : one, the recto-vesical, to the visceral surface of the ! levator ani; the other, the ischio-rectal, to the parietal aspect of the same muscle. The levator ani muscle (figs. 648, 650), with its fellow of the opposite side, i constitutes the greater part of the muscular floor of the pelvis, and acts as a septum between the pelvic cavity and the ischio-rectal fossa. It arises anteriorly from the back of the os pubis, just external to the attachment of the pubo-vesical muscle, j posteriorly from the inner side of the ischial spine below the origin of the coecygeus, and between these two points from the whole length of the ' white line.' Its fibres form a flat plane of considerable strength, and pass downwards, backwards, and inwards to their insertion, the most posterior to the tip of the coccyx; those next (in order to join the opposite muscle in a median raphe extending from the coccyx I to the tendinous centre of the perinaeum, and the rest to the side of the rectum, I interlacing with the longitudinal layer of the muscular wall of the gut. Its two surfaces may be termed visceral and parietal; the former, looking forwards as well I as upwards, is invested by a layer of fascia, the recto-vesical, and is further separated ' from the lower part of the bladder by subperitoneal tissue; the parietal surface,1100 THE UBINABY OBGANS covered by a fascia, the ischio-rectal or anal, forms the greater part of the outer wall of the ischio-rectal fossa. The anterior and posterior borders of the muscle are free (and here the two investing fasciae become continuous with each other). The anterior border crosses the side of the prostate, and is connected with the corre- sponding part of the opposite muscle by fibrous and smooth muscular tissue, which passes between the prostate and rectum. The posterior border is separated from the anterior margin of the coccygeus by an indistinct cellular interspace. | In the female the anterior fibres of insertion are connected with the side of the | vagina, interlacing with the longitudinal fibres of its muscular tissue without ' becoming actually inserted into the passage. ' The levator ani is supplied by twigs of the inferior haemorrhoidal vessels and \ nerves, and receives also branches from the fourth and fifth sacral nerves. j Action.-—The special action from which the muscle derives its name has been ' questioned by Elidinger, who believes that its essential function is to compress the | I Fig. 650.—Diagkam showing Lines of Attachment of the Fascia AND Muscles of the Pelvis. rectum. A study of the direction of the fibres, however, leaves little doubt that the result of the contraction of the muscle as a whole, and in association with its fellow, is to draw forwards the coccyx and elevate the pelvic floor and viscera, and thus lessen the long diameter of the abdomino-pelvic cavity and aid in the compression of the abdominal and pelvic viscera. Its action as a compressor of the rectum is probably unimportant, but it is possible that it exercises some influence upon the circulation in the prostatic plexus and in the large pelvic veins which occupy the recess between the muscle and the viscera, and may also assist in the expulsion of the prostatic secretion by direct lateral compression of the organ. In the female it may constrict the lower end of the vagina, where the passage lies between the free borders of the two muscles. The coccygeus is a thin and rather unimportant plane of muscular fibres, supported by and blending intimately with the lesser sacro-sciatic ligament. It i1101 PELVIC FASCIA AND MUSCLES arises from the inner surface of the ischial spine above the levator ani, and )asses backwards and inwards, expanding to become inserted into the sides of the !0ccyx, the lateral sacro-coccygeal ligament, and the last two pieces of the sacrum. ;ts visceral surface looks almost directly forwards, and is covered by a continuation »f the recto-vesical fascia. Its parietal surface is in contact with the lesser sacro- iciatic ligament. Its superior border is separated from the inferior border of the pyriformis by the vessels and nerves which escape from the pelvis below the latter nuscle. Its inferior border is related to the posterior border of the levator ani. Che muscle is often pierced by filaments of the fourth and fifth sacral and coccygeal Fig. 651.—Muscles of the Floor of the Pelvis. (A portion of the ischial and pubic bones sawn away.)

It aids the levator ani in drawing forwards the coccyx. The recto-vesical fascia may be regarded as a lamina detached from the pbturator fascia at the level of the upper border of the ' white line.' From this point it extends upon the pelvic surface of the levator ani and coccygeus to become reflected upon the viscera immediately related to the muscular floor of the pelvis, namely, the prostate and bladder (forming the capsule of the former and the ' true ligaments ' of the latter), the vasa deferentia and vesicul^ seminales, the lower part |0f the rectum, and, in the female, the vagina and uterus. Its visceral portion is1102 THE UBINABY OBGANS easy to trace in the immediate neighbourhood of its reflexion, but it becomes less distinct as it recedes from this point, and at length is undemonstrable. The ischio-rectal or anal fascia, originating at the white line below the fascial attachment of the levator ani, closely invests the parietal or ischio-rectal surface \ of this muscle, and that of its neighbour, the coecygeus, to blend in the region of the anus with the deep fascial covering of the external sphincter. In front it passes above the perinseal structures, becoming continuous with the superior triangular ligament (a prolongation of the obturator fascia), and meeting with the recto-vesical I fascia, at the anterior border of the levator ani; while behind it extends backwards i for a variable distance to join again with the obturator fascia. In this way the two ' fasciae, obturator and ischio-rectal, close in the ischio-rectal fossa above, in front,! and behind, but leave it widely open below. The ischio-rectal fossse (figs. 647, 648, 652, 653) are two deep interspaces, one on each side, left by the divergence of the obliquely directed muscles of the pelvic floor (levator ani and coecygeus) from the vertical pelvic wall. Each fossa is bounded Fig. 652.—Sagittal Section through the Perineal Ledge and Ischio-rectal Fossa to the Left of the Middle Line. (Diagrammatic.)

Superiorly, the vertical outer wall is joined by the sloping inner Avail where the ischio-rectal fascia joins the obturator fascia, so that the space is angular A in outhne in frontal section. So far all anatomists are agreed, but the remaining boundaries require further investigation. If the finger be introduced into the fossa, it will meet in front the line of junction of the triangular ligaments with the fascia of Colles. Deep or superior to this will be found an anterior recess of considerable size extending forward nearly as fai as the symphysis, between the superior triangular ligament and the under surface oi the levator ani, and limited internally by the prostate and pubo-prostatic Ugaments. and externally by the pubic and ischial rami. Behind will be felt the border of the j great sacro-sciatic ligament, and above this a posterior recess running backwards for a variable distance towards the sacrum. Both of these deep extensions are linedJ by the ischio-rectal and obturator fascia, and filled with fat and connective tissue.PELVIC FASCIA AND MUSCLES 1103 ^he ischio-rectal fossa must then be described as an anvil- or T-shaped cavity with nterior and posterior recesses running the one above the perin^eal ledge, the other bove the sacro-sciatic ligaments. Contents.—The ischio-rectal fossa is filled with loose adipose tissue continuous ath the subcutaneous fat of the buttock, and traversed from without inwards by tie inferior haemorrhoidal branches of the pudic artery, and by the associated veins nd some twigs of the internal pudic nerve passing to the sphincter ani and adjacent kin and mucous membrane. ' The veins are usually somewhat dilated near the anal margin, and when lorbidly enlarged constitute the condition known as haemorrhoids or piles, fear the posterior border of the triangular ligaments the pudic vessels and Esrves give off their superficial perinseal branches, which almost immediately ter the superficial perinfeal interspace.

It is pierced by the urethra (and also by the vagina in the female), and comprises three strong fasciae which enclose within two interfascial spaces the root )f the penis with the muscles appended to it, the compressor urethra muscle, 3owper's glands, and a number of vessels and nerves. Above it lie the prostate and evatores ani with their fasciae, and the anterior recess of each ischio-rectal fossa. The perinaeal integument has already been described. On removal of the skin ^ith its dartos and the superficial layers of superficial fascia, a deeper plane of fascia ivill be exposed, connected firmly with the ischio-pubic rami. This is the fascia of polles (the deep layer of the superficial perinaeal fascia), the most superficial of the phree true perinseal fasciae. I The fascia of Colles is a fibrous lamina of considerable strength. It is attached1104 THE UBINABY OBGANS on each side to the lower margin of the ischio-pubic ramus and to the ischial tuberosity ; behind, it turns around the posterior border of the superficial transversus perinaei muscle to fuse with the posterior borders of the superficial and deep triangular ligaments and form the free border of the ' perinaeal ledge ' ; ante- riorly, it becomes continuous with the external fascial investment of the scrotum and the fascial covering of the penis. It is between this layer and the inferior triangular ligament that extravasation of urine is especially prone to occur in rupture of the urethra. From its connections it will be seen that the extension of the fluid would be arrested posteriorly and laterally by the connection of the fascia of Colles with the triangular ligaments and' with the ischio-pubic rami; but it spreads freely beneath the integuments of the scrotum and of the penis as far as the neck of the glans, and eventually ma\ reach the surface of the abdomen, but is prevented from descending below the groin by the connection of the abdominal fascia with Poupart's ligament. | Superficial perinaeal interspace (figs. 647, 652, 654).—Detaching the fascia oi Colles from its connections, the dissector opens the superficial interfascial space and Fig. 654.—Diagram of the Superficial and Deep Triangular Ligaments.

The roof of the space (the so-called floor : is formed by the inferior triangular ligament. The transversi perinaei, the crura penis with the ischio-cavernosi, and the bull- with the bulbo-cavernosi, have been already described (page 1072). Each of thei muscles named has a fascial sheath of its own, distinct from the fascia of Colles. ^ The artery of the corpus cavernosum enters the crus immediately after piercing ■ the inferior triangular hgament; the dorsal artery of the penis, reaching the inter , fascial space more anteriorly with the dorsal nerve, runs forwards to the dorsum oi i the united corpora cavernosa to take its place between the vein and nerve :i the superficial perinaeal vessels and nerve given off from the internal pudic trunks' in the ischio-rectal fossa enter the interfascial space near the free border of thej perineal ledge.

Inferior triang^ular ligament (' the anterior layer of the triangular ligament') jfig. 652).—On removing the contents of the superficial interspace the dissector ixposes the under surface of the inferior or superficial triangular ligament. This tructure forms almost a horizontal plane in the erect posture of the body, nd consists of strong bands of fibrous tissue, running for the most part in a cansverse direction across the subpubic arch to be attached firmly to the ischio- ubic rami above the line of attachment of the fascia of Colles and of the penile luscles. Anteriorly, it is separated from the subpubic ligament by an interval i^hich transmits the dorsal vein of the penis ; posteriorly, it blends with the fascia of Fig. 655.

It is pierced by :—(1) The urethra, about an inch and a quarter below the l^mphysis ; (2) the ducts of Cowper's glands, one on each side of the posterior I art of the urethral openings ; (3) the arteries of the bulb, somewhat external to le last; (4) the arteries to the corpora cavernosa, more anteriorly and close to lie lateral attachment of the ligament; (5) the dorsal arteries and nerves of the ienis, at the margins of the ligament near its apex. The dorsal vein with some ccompanying lymphatics runs through the interspace between the triangular nd subpubic ligaments (fig. 654). Deep perinseal interspace (figs. 620, 652, 654).—If the superficial triangular gament be now detached, the deep perinaeal interspace will be laid open. This pace is somewhat wedge-shaped in sagittal section, in consequence of the manner 1 which the two triangular ligaments approach each other before their union t the posterior border of the perineal ledge. It is occupied by the following fcructures:—■ 4 B1106 THE URINARY ORGANS (1) The membranous urethra, suiToimded by its annular sphincter of smooth muscular fibres. (2) Cowper's glands, seen as two white pea-like bodies, one on each side of the posterior segment of the urethra. Their ducts pierce the superficial ligament. (3) The internal pudic arteries, lying close to the ischio-pubic rami imbedded in the fibres of origin of the compressor urethrse muscle, giving off each an arterv to the bulb as well as some twigs to Cowper's gland and to the muscular tissue surrounding the urethra, and terminating by division into the artery to the corpus cavernosum, and the dorsal artery of the penis. These branches with the associated veins have been seen to pass through the superficial triangular ligament into the superficial perinpeal interspace. (4) The pudic veins, accompanying the arteries. Their tributaries form a plexus around the urethra, and in the substance of the fibres of the deep transversa^ perinsei. This plexus, which is often largely developed in old persons, receives the veins of the corpus spongiosum and corpora cavernosa, and communicates freelv with the dorsal vein of the penis, and through this with the prostatic plexus. (5) The pudic lymphatics, accompanying the veins and terminating in th( pelvic glands. (6) The dorsal nerves of the penis, the terminal branches of the internal pudic nerves, accompany the arteries; each nerve gives off filaments to the deep trans versus perinaei, and then pierces the fore part of the superficial triangular ligamen; with the dorsal artery. (7) The deep transversus perinsei or compressor urethrse.—The musculai tissue of the deep perinseal space has been a source of great confusion owing to the multiplicity of the names which have been assigned to various portions of it; but th( description given by Henle may be accepted as at once the simplest and the mos accurate. The transversus perinsei profundus of Henle is closely connected witl the superior and inferior triangular ligaments. It arises from the inner surface o the ischio-pubic ramus, by tendinous bundles which separate to form a kind o channel for the pudic vessels and dorsal nerve of the penis, close to the bone. Fron this origin the greater part of the fibres run across the subpubic angle in i- transverse direction in front of and behind the membranous urethra, enclosiii; Cowper's glands and the deep veins of the penis, and join a more or less indistinc median raphe ; while others pass more or less obliquely forwards in front of th' urethra and behind the dorsal vein to become attached to the pubic ramus on th side opposite to the bony attachment. A small accessory bundle (the ' sagitta layer' of Henle) may sometimes be found running directly forwards to becom inserted into the upper surface of the bulb and into the connective tissue between the corpora cavernosa. The arrangement of the fibres differs considerably ii' different subjects, and much complexity has been introduced into the study oi the muscle by the artificial segregation of certain of its parts under special names, such as levator urethrse, constrictor urethrae, etc. ■ Its action is partly to compress the membranous urethra and thus assist th expulsion of urine and semen, and partly to intercept the flow of blood through the veins of the penis, and so aid in erection. It also exercises compressio ' upon Cowper's glands, and effects the discharge of their secretion during semina' emission. It is supplied by a branch from the dorsal nerve of the penis. ' The superior or deep triangular ligament (figs. 650, 652, 654) is in some soi a prolongation of the obturator fascia across the pubic arch ; the continuity of th! two fasciae, however, being interrupted by the attachment of their deep fibres t the inner edges of the ischio-pubic rami. Inferiorly it is in intimate relation wit 1 the deep transversus perinsei; while superiorly it forms on each side the floor of th! anterior extension of the ischio-rectal fossa ; and in the middle line it is separate • from the apex of the prostate by a prolongation of recto-vesical fascia, and by '1107 THE FEMALE PEBINJEUM lyer of smooth muscular fibre, the prserectalis of Henle, in which end the greater art of the anterior longitudinal fibres of the rectum. It is pierced by the pudic artery and vein and the dorsal nerve of the penis, 'he dorsal vein of the penis passes between it and the subpubic hgament. THE FEMALE PERINEUM The female periuseuni (fig. 656) differs from that of the male, partly in the erforation of the whole of its fascial and muscular structures in the middle line by 16 vulvo-vaginal passage, and partly in the adaptation of the perinaeal muscles to iie modified conditions of the external genital apparatus. The corpora cavernosa Fig. 656.—Diagrammatic Kepresbntation of the Perin^eal Structures IN THE Female. tnis are represented by the relatively diminutive corpora clitoridis; the ischio- vernosi are proportionately reduced in size, but differ in no other material spect; the corpus spongiosum is divided into two lateral segments, which are presented by the bulbi vestibuli and partes intermediales; and the two bulbo- jvernosi are separate, and appear in an attenuated form, spread over the erectile 3sue as an attenuated plane of fibres, the compressor vaginse, which is often fficult to recognise on dissection ; while the median raphe uniting the two uscles in the male gives place to the genital fissure. The superficial transversi Jrinaei differ only in size from those of the male ; but the deep transversus Jiinsei is of course cleft by the vagina, and its fibres are relatively thin and weak id in great part unstriped. The glands of Bartholin, although morphologically entical with Cowper's glands, are less deeply placed. The greater development of the connective tissue structures between the genital -nal and the third stage of the rectum, leading to the formation of the perinaeal )dy, is also a peculiarity of the female (fig. 619). The perinaeal body is triangular [ sagittal section, and bounded in front by the vulvo-vaginal wall, behind by the iterior wall of the rectum, and below by the integument between the posterior 4 B 21108 THE MAMMABY GLANDS vulvar commissure and the anal aperture. It consists of a strong meshwork o connective tissue freely intermingled with fibres of elastic tissue and unstripec muscle, and is traversed by the various muscles Avhich meet at the tendinou' centre of the perin^eum. It becomes stretched to a remarkable degree during th passage of the child's head in labour, but is saved from rupture by its strengtl and elasticity. THE mammje: The mammary glands are two pectoral organs which secrete the milk in th female, but remain permanently rudimentary and functionless in the male. The female mamma (in which term is included the gland with its investin integumentary structures) is seen in its typical adult form as a more or less hem spherical eminence upon the front wall of the chest over the third, fourth, fiftli and sixth ribs, and extending transversely from the border of the sternum to th anterior margin of the axilla. It is surmounted near its middle by a small war like process, the mammilla or nipple, which lies in the centre of a circular area ( altered skin called the areola. Fig. 657.—The Female Mamma dueing Lactation. (After Lusclika.) Acini of gland Gland lo cuius The secreting organ consists of an aggregation of ten to sixteen compoui racemose glands, the ends of which open separately upon the summit of the nipp] These component elements are quite distinct in the dissected breast as so mai lobes of somewhat pyramidal form, with their bases at the periphery and the apic converging towards the mammilla. They are held together and supported by fibrous capsule, which sends inwards deep interlobular processes to form a loculatt framework for the glandular elements, and superficial processes running to tl skin and enclosing fat-containing spaces or adipose fossae. The deep aspect of tl capsule also encloses other fat-spaces, and is attached to the deep fascia by loo connective tissue, the bands of which maybe separated by large lymph-space the so-called ' submammary bursse.' It is the fat lying in the subcutaneous adipo;1109 THE MAMM^ )SS8e and between the gland lobules that gives smoothness and uniformity of surface ) the breast, and when it becomes absorbed during lactation or in conditions of aiaciation, the lobular structure of the gland is distinctly manifest. Structurally each of the component lobes may be regarded as a modified sebaceous land, and hence an appendage of the skin. Each is provided with a single secretory tube (lactiferous or galactophorous duct), which on approaching the ipple is dilated into a sinus or ampulla, and finally ends by a constricted orifice t the apex of the nipple. The acini and smaller tubes are lined with cubical bithelium, which becomes replaced by columnar cells in the excretory ducts. Accessory glands of small size—half a line to tv/o lines in diameter, and to the jamber of five to fifteen—are normally found under the skin of the areola, and pen on to the summit of the nipple. The gland as a whole is not circular in outline, but usually presents three lisps—one towards the sternum, sometimes overlapping the bone ; the others )wards the axilla, one above and the other below ; smaller extensions, moreover, ixss from the base of the gland to the deep fascia, and may pierce it and lie upon or \ the fibres of the pectoral muscle (Heidenhain). These processes are commonly ft behind in amputation of the breast, and may form nuclei for recurrent growth L malignant disease. The mammilla and areola are specially modified portions of the mammary iitegument. The mammilla is placed a little internal and inferior to the centre of le gland, and points forwards and outwards. It is of somewhat conical form, v^eraging about half an inch in length, and terminating by a rounded extremity iiich is pierced by the orifices of the lactiferous ducts. It is of pinkish colour, id is capable of a kind of erection under the influence of cold, mechanical iiimulus, or mental emotion. In some persons it is normally retracted into a ppression of the integument, and only projects in response to stimulation, i The areola is about an inch in diameter, and is characterised by its pigmentation, lie delicacy of its texture, the absence of subcutaneous fat, the large development : its sebaceous and accessory milk glands, and its contractility under the influ- ices which produce erection of the nipple. It is pink in the virgin, but during •regnancy and lactation assumes a brownish shade. The accessory glands, jightly marked in the virgin, form chstinct prominences after impregnation tubercles of Montgomery). The contractility of the nipple and areola is due to the presence of circular id radiating fibres of unstriped muscle in the subcutaneous tissue, the former issing into the substance of the nipple, and forming a network around the lacti- Tous ducts. The circular fibres by their contraction cause the nipple to project; 16 radiating fibres retract it. Variations according" to age and functional activity.—At birth the gland is lily about one-fifth to one-third of an inch in diameter. The nipple with its Sirtos is well formed, and the secreting structure is represented by slightly ramified lets which contain a milky fluid. Growth is slow up to the time of puberty ; I'ter this, development progresses rapidly, but no distinct indication of subdivision ito lobes is present until impregnation takes place. Some slight engorgement of le breast may, however, occur at the menstrual period, when a yellowish glutinous ^cretion may sometimes be expelled from the ducts. In pregnancy and during i-ctation the evolution of the gland-structure is remarkably active. The whole jreast enlarges, the superficial fat undergoes absorption, the vessels become dilated |nd their walls thickened; the areola and nipple increase in size, and the former iecomes more or less deeply pigmented. After the end of lactation the breast [econies smaller, but seldom resumes its original condition of smoothness, firmness, ad elasticity, and some traces of the pigmentation of the areola remain permanent. Ill old age the glandular structures atrophy. t1110 THE MAMMABY GLANDS The male breast differs from that of the female in the early arrest of its evolution. It ranges in diameter from a third of an inch to an inch, and possesses an areola and nipple, the former often beset with hairs. It is usually placed over the fourth intercostal space a little internal to the border of the pectoralis major, but its position is very variable, and the two glands are often unsymmetrical. A temporary engorgement occasionally appears in early adult life, and may lead to inflammatory complications. Vessels and nerves.—The arteries are derived from the internal mammary through the second, third, and fourth intercostal spaces, and from the thoracic branches of the axillary. The chief supply is given to the perforating branches oj the internal mammary, but the external mammary branch of the axillary arter} may be of large size in the female. j The veins terminate in the corresponding trunks. The superficial veins become: visibly enlarged during pregnancy and lactation. | The lymphatics accompany the veins ; some terminate in the costal group o: axillary glands, and others in the retrosternal chain ; and in cancer of the breasi the deep cervical glands about the subclavian vessels may become imphcated as th( disease advances. The nerves are derived from the supraclavicular branches of the cervical plexus and from the intercostals. The glandular twigs are traced by Eckhard to th( fourth, fifth, and sixth intercostals. Fig. 658.—Development of the Mamma of the Female Embryo. (7 inches in length x 70.) (After La,nger.) Development.—The breast appears about the seventh week of foetal life as a circuLi epidermic ridge, enclosing a central depression, the cells of which grow inwards and fori' branching tubular ducts that radiate beneath the nipple (fig. 658). Abnormalities. — Small supplementary lacteal glands, in addition to the norm; accessory structures beneath the areola, are frequently present aroimd the margin (\ the principal gland, and may be found in front of the sternum, in the axilla, and belo the clavicle, and there is reason to believe that many of the adenomata and cancers tal^ origin in these redundant structures (Pioger Williams). Besides these, large supernumerai, mamnise, having all the characters of the typical organs, have also been met with i i various situations—in the axilla, over the back, the abdomen, and even on the thigl These are in all probability atavistic. Absence of the mamma is extremely rare. The nipples may be double, or even triple on each breast, or may be wantin altof?ether. ' In a few instances an abnormal development of the gland tissue has been known i occur in the male, and milk has been secreted in sufficient quantity to nourish an infan; A slight and temporary enlargement of the gland about the period of puberty is ik , infrequent. \ I iSECTION X ON SURGICAL AND OPOGRAPHICAL ANATOMY By W. H. a. JACOBSON, M.A., M.B., M.Ch.Oxon, F.R.C.S. ASSISTANT SURGEON, GUY'S HOSPITAL; LECTURER ON ANATOMY IN THE MEDICAL SCHOOL. SUPERFICIAL ANATOMY OF THE HEAD AND NECK THE HEAD AND FACE Bony landmarks.—These should be studied with the aid of a skull, as well as on he living subject. In the middle line behind is the external occipital protuberance, )r inion, the thickest part of the vault, and corresponding internally with the jneeting-point of six sinuses. From this point the nuchal lines pass out towards ihe mastoid processes, and indicate the course of the lateral sinuses, which, after "unning horizontally outwards, turn downwards in the mastoid bone. About two nches and three-quarters above the external occipital protuberance is the lambda, pr meeting of the coronal and lambdoidal sutures (posterior fontanelle), small ind triradiate in shape (fig. 660). The point of junction of the lambdoidal and quamous sutures, the asterion, is placed about three-quarters of an inch behind ind half an inch above the upper part of the posterior border of the mastoid ifig. 661). The bregma, or junction of the coronal, sagittal, and, in early life, the rental suture (anterior fontanelle, large and lozenge-shaped), lies just in front of ihe centre of a line drawn transversely over the cranial vault from one external jiuditory meatus to the other (fig. 661). The pterion, or junction of the frontal, iiarietal, temporal, and sphenoid bones, lies in the zygomatic fossa, one and a half 0 two inches behind the external angular process of the frontal, and about the ame distance above the zygoma (fig. 661). This spot also gives the position of he trunk and the anterior and larger division of the middle meningeal artery. The zygoma can be traced backwards to its roots in front of the ear, while from Lts anterior extremity the finger, carried upwards along the outline of the malar, itraces the temporal ridge along the side of the skull which marks the upper limit of the temporal fossa, and the attachments of the temporal muscle and fascia. In the temporal fossa lie the muscle, and the deep temporal vessels and perves. Above the zygoma can be felt the contraction of the temporal; and below, jfchat of the masseter muscle; the former less distinctly owing to its covering of fascia, attached below by two layers to the upper border of the zygoma. In the zygomatic fossa, lying inside the zygoma, are the lower part of the temporal, and1112 SUBGICAL AND TOPOGBAPHICAL ANATOMY the two pterygoid muscles, together with the internal maxillary vessels, and the mandibular division of the nerve, and their branches. Fig. 659.—The Skull in Sagittal Section. BR EG MA Fig. 660.—The Cranium at Birth. The anterior inferior angle of the parietal bone, and its great importance as a landmark, has already been given. The posterior inferior angle of this bone (grooved by the lateral sinus) lies a little above and behind the base of theTHE SKULL 1113 aastoid, on a level with the roots of the zygoma (fig. 661). The lateral sinus nil be indicated by a line passing from the external occipital protuberance to a )oint one inch behind the external auditory meatus. The average thickness of the adult skull-cap is about one-fifth of an inch Holden). The thickest part is at the external occipital protuberance, where the jione is often three-quarters of an inch in thickness. The thinnest part of the skull jault is over the temporal part of the squamous. The extreme fragility of the skull jiere is partly compensated for by the thickness of the soft parts; of these, the lericranium is alone thinner than elsewhere, while its intimate connection with Ihe bones makes cephalh^ematoma less frequent here. (Tillaux.) Fig. 661.—The Skull. (Norma lateralis.) 1 In front, the circumference of the bony orbit can be traced in its whole extent. I'he supraorbital notch lies at the junction of the inner and middle thirds of the ipraorbital arch. When this notch is a complete foramen, its detection is much jss easy. Above the supraorbital arch is the supraciliary ridge, and higher still le frontal eminence. From the supraorbital notch a line drawn downwards and ightly outwards, so as to run between the two bicuspid teeth in each jaw, passes Iver the infraorbital and mental foramina. (Holden.) THE BONY SINUSES—The frontal.—The development of these by the twentieth twenty-fifth year may render a fracture here much less grave in the adult lan"^would otherwise be the case, the inner table, if now separated from the iter, protecting the brain. Mr. Hilton showed that the absence of any external1114 SUBGICAL AND TOPOGBAPHICAL ANATOMY j prominence here does not necessarily imply the absence of a sinus, as this may hi formed by retrocession of the internal table. In old people these sinuses ma^ enlarge by the inner table following the shrinking brain. Again, a very prominen bump here does not necessarily point to the existence of a sinus at all, being diK merely to a heaping up of bone. The communication of these sinuses with the nose accounts for the frontaj headache in ozasna, and the fact that a patient with a compound fracture openimi up the sinuses can blow out a flame held close by. j The mastoid sinuses are arranged in two groups, of the utmost importance iii Fig. 662.—Drawing of a Cast of the Head of an Adult Male. (Prepared by Professor Cnnningham to illustrate cranio-cerebral topography.) that frequent and fatal disease, inflammation of the middle ear :—(1) The ' antrun j present both in early and late life, horizontal in direction, closely adjacent to ai j communicating with the tympanum. Through this bone, very thin in early lii j the tre]Dhine should be directed in opening up the mastoid cells. (2) The verticf j This group is not developed in early life. Inflammation here brings mischij nearer the lateral sinus and cerebellum. j The veins passing from the mastoid cells and tymixtnum fall into three chi | groups—(a) those opening into the lateral sinus; (h) those passing through t| mastoid foramen into the occipital and scalp veins ; (c) those running through t. j petro-squamosal suture to the dura mater. As all these veins carry connecti\ j tissue sheaths, inflammation may reach—{a) the lateral sinus, causing sep j phlebitis; {h) the soft parts outside, causing cellulitis, periostitis, etc.; (c)thedu| mater and brain, leading to meningitis and abscess.1115 THE SCALP The sphenoidal sinuses are less important surgically, but these points should be remembered:—(1) Fracture through them may lead to bleeding from the nose, which is thus brought into communication with the middle fossa ; (2) the com- jmnnication of their mucous membrane with that of the nose may explain the inveteracy of certain cases of oz^na ; (3) here and in the frontal sinuses very ;lense exostoses are sometimes formed. THE SCALP.—The importance of the scalp is best seen from an examination of its layers (fig. 663). These are—(1) skin; (2) subcutaneous fat and fibrous tissue ; (3) the occipito-frontalis and aponeurosis; (4) the subaponeurotic layer of con- Inective tissue ; (5) the pericranium and subpericranial connective tissue. ' The first three layers are connected and move together. (1) The union of the skin, and its density, are to enable it to meet pressure, and also to prevent it rucking jinto folds. Furthermore, they account for the extreme pain of inflammation here, and jthe difficulty of raising a blister on the scalp. The presence of hairs and sebaceous glands is of much more importance than appears at first. Thus the rooting of the former is so firm that in the case of young women the whole scalp may be Fig. 663.—Section through the Scalp, Skull, and Dura Mater. (Tillaux.) Skin and super- ficial fascia with. HAIR BULBS AND SEBACEOUS GLANDS Fat pellets Occipito-frontalis aponeurosis —-Sub-aponeurotie connective tissue Pericranium Subp ericranial connective tissue SKULL : DIPLOIC TISSUE Dura mater Skull cavity torn oft' by machinery. The sebaceous glands have also grave importance. If in removing them the aponeurosis beneath is pricked or the wound becomes foul, fatal uppuration in the ' dangerous area ' beneath may follow. (2) The subcutaneous fat is arranged much as in the palm, viz. tough fatty pellets are enclosed in fibrous ^ partitions, dipping from the skin to the third layer, and thus tying the three layers together. (3) The occipito-frontalis and its aponeurosis have been fully described jjjlj slsewhere (page 454). (4) The subaponeurotic layer of connective tissue. The j^ji characters of this layer are quite opposed to those of the layer of connective tissue above the aponeurosis. It is loose, delicate, and fatless. From these result the free mobility of the scalp, the fact that it can be torn away, and (most important of all) the facility with which inflammatory products can spread in this layer. The perils of pus pent up here are extreme, viz. sloughing of the scalp, or necrosis of the bones, blood-poisoning, and meningitis, from mischief travelling along the emissary and diploic veins (fig. 663). The continuity of the difterent scalp layers by bands of connective tissue passing from the skin to the occipito-frontalis, and thence along vessels, emissary and others, into the venous sinuses, or by the diploic veins within the skull, will account for scalp inflammation reaching the meninges.1116 SUBGICAL AND TOPOGBAPHIGAL ANATOMY • j Of the vessels of the scalp, the arteries are peculiar in their position. Thus they he superficial to the deep fascia, which is here represented by the aponeurosis (fig. 663). From this position arises the fact that a large flap of scalp may be separated without perishing, as it carries its own blood-vessels. From the density of the layer in which the vessels run they cannot retract and are difficult to seize, haemorrhage thus being free. Finally, from their position over closely adjacent ] bone, ill-applied pressure may easily lead to sloughing. ! The emissary veins.—These are communications between the sinuses within, i and the veins outside, the cranium. Most of them are temporary, corresponding to I the chief period of growth of the brain. Thus in early life, when the develop- I ment of brain has to be very rapid, owing to the approaching closure of its case, i a free escape of blood is most essential, especially in children, with their sudden i explosions of laughter and passionate crying. ' 1. Vein through the foramen caecum, between the anterior extremity of the | superior longitudinal sinus and the nasal mucous membrane. The value of this | temporary outlet is well seen in the timely profuse epistaxis of children. Other more permanent communications between the skull cavity and nasal mucous' membrane pass through the ethmoid and internal orbital foramina. The fact' that the nasal mucous membrane is loose and ill-supported on the turbinated bones allows its vessels to give way readily, and thus forms a salutary safeguard ' to the brain, warding off many an attack of apoplexy. 2. Vein through the mastoid foramen, between the lateral sinus and the posterior auricular and occipital veins. This is the largest, the most constant, ■ and the most superficial of the emissary veins. Hence the old rule of applying blisters or leeches over it in cerebral congestion. 3. Vein through the posterior superior angle of the parietal between the superior I longitudinal sinus and the veins of the scalp. 4. Vein through the posterior condyloid foramen between the lateral sinus and i the deep veins of the neck. 5. Vein through the anterior condyloid foramen between the occipital sinus and i the deep veins of the neck. | 6. Ophthalmic vein between the cavernous sinus and the angular vein. This j vein may be the source of fatal blood-poisoning, by conveying out of reach septic j material, in acute periostitis of the orbit, or in ostitis of dental origin of the jaws. 7. Minute veins through the foramen ovale between the cavernous sinus and : the pharyngeal and pterygoid veins. 8. Communications between the frontal diploic and supraorbital veins, between the anterior temporal diploic and deep temporal veins, and between the posterior; temporal and occipital diploic veins and the lateral sinus. The gravity of these emissary veins and their free communications with others is shown by the readiness with which they become the seat of septic thrombosis, and thus of blood-poisoning, in cranial injuries, erysipelas, suppuration of the scalp, i and necrosis of the skull. I Structure of cranium.—Two layers and intervening cancellous tissue. Each ! layer has special properties. The outer gives thickness, smoothness, and uniformity, I and, above all, elasticity. The inner is whiter, thinner, less regular—e.g. thej depressions for vessels. Pacchionian bodies, dura mater, and brain. Its chief) characteristics are its fragility (vitreous) and absolute inelasticity. The diploe,; formed by absorption after the skull has attained a certain thickness, reduces the [ weight of the skull without proportionately reducing its strength, and provides a j material which will prevent the transmission of vibrations. | Results of the above varying^ elasticity.—A blow on the head may fracture the ^ internal table only, the external one and diploe escaping. This is difficult to j diagnose, and thus it is impossible to judge of the severity of a fracture from1117 THE SKULL ;he state of the external table. This may be whole, or merely cracked, while the nternal shows many fragments, which may set up meningitis, or other mischief. Anatomical conditions tending to minimise the effects of violence inflicted upon :he skull.—(1) The density and mobility of the scalp. (2) The dome-like shape of :he skull. This, like an egg-shell, is calculated to bear hard blows and also to allow jihem to glide off, (3) The number of bones tends to break up the force of a blow, I'l) The sutures interrupt the transmission of violence, (5) The internal membrane I remains of foetal periosteum) acts in early life as a linear buffer, (6) The elasticity of :he outer table, (7) The overlapping- of some bones, e.g, the parietal by the Fig. 664,—The Course of the Occipital Artery.

The little frontal artery is of importance, £ it nourishes the flap when a new nose is taken from the forehead.1119 THE EYELIDS A line drawn from the tip of the lobule of the ear to a point midway between the nose and upper lip gives the level of the parotid duct, which opens into the mouth opposite the second upper molar. The sheath of the parotid, continuous with those of the masseter and sterno-mastoid, is strong enough to cause most exquisitely painful tension when inflammation of the gland is present. The upper border of the gland is marked out by a line drawn along the posterior part of the zygoma, the lower by one drawn from the angle of the jaw to the mastoid process ^fig. 668, page 1121). The posterior border is bounded by the mastoid process, external auditory meatus, and the sterno-mastoid ; the anterior border and the socia parotidis Iproject to a variable degree over the masseter. The proximity of the parotid to the 'styloid process, to which the pharynx is attached, accounts for deep parotid abscess Dpening into the pharynx. Below the root of the zygoma, when this process is [traced backwards, will be felt the temporo-mandibular joint; and when the mouth Is opened, the condyle will be felt to glide forwards upon the eminentia articularis.

Owing to its looseness and delicacy, it is very liable to infiltration, as in ascites and erysipelas. (3) Orbicularis.

The frequency with which the lid-border is the seat oj; that most troublesome chronic inflammation, blepharitis, and its result ' blear eye, j is explained by these anatomical points. Its circulation is terminal and slow; haLi skin and half mucous membrane, it is moister and more liable to local irritatiori than the skin ; while its numerous glands readily participate in any inflammation | Fig. 667.—The Lachrymal Apparatus and Nasal Duct. (Bellamy.) (Bristles are introduced into the puncta lachrymalia.) LOWER TURBINATED BONE Orifice of nasal duct (8) The conjunctiva.—The differing structure of the palpebral and ocular portio has important bearings. Thus the palpebral is thick, highly vascular, and ver sensitive. To the vascularity we owe the chemosis, or hot, red, tense swelling c purulent ophthalmia. The exquisite suffering of the same disease, or that cause by a foreign body, is explained by the numerous nerve-papillaB. To the thicknes and abundance of the connective tissue are due the contraction and permane' thickening which may occur in granular lids. The so-called granulations, met wit in this disease on the palpebral conjunctiva, are really little nodules of hypertrophie lymphoid follicles, or mucous glands, which abound here. The position of the lachrymal puncta should be noted: owing to their back ward direction the lids must be previously everted. The puncta are kept open by minute fibrous ring. The lachrymal sac is the most important of the lachrym? apparatus, from its disfiguring diseases ; it lies in a bony groove, between th nasal process of the maxilla and the lachrymal bone. The tendo oculi crosse it a little above its centre. Thus two-thirds of the sac are below the tendon, an in suppuration the opening is made below it also. The angular artery ascend iTHE EYE 1121 n the nasal side of the sac. The manipulation of a probe along the lachrymal lassages should thus be practised :—The lower lid being drawn outwards and ownwards by the thumb, the probe is passed vertically into the punctum, then urned horizontally and passed on till it reaches the inner wall of the sac. It is lien raised vertically, and pushed steadily along the duct downwards, and a little utwards and backwards, till the floor of the nose is reached. THE MOUTH On the floor, on either side of the fraenal fold of mucous membrane, are the ifices of Wharton's ducts, marked by minute papillae. In dividing the fraenum r tongue-tie, the scissors should be kept close to the bone, so as to avoid the ranine ssels. Of these, the ranine vein can be seen beneath the mucous membrane ; the tery lies close to it, but deeper. Two diverging folds indicate the position of these Fig. 668.—Side of the Face and Mouth Cavity, showing the Three Salivary Glands. the totisiii 0} SOCIA PAROTIDIS DUCT OF SOCIA PAROTIDIS DUCT OF PAROTID ristle inserted into duet raenum linguae DUCT OF RIVINI JBLINGUAL GLAND PAROTID GLAND Sterno-mastoid muscle Posterior belly of digastric muscle SUBMAXILLARY GLAND, DRAWN BACKWARDS Loop of fascia CT OF SUBMAXILLARY GLAND Mylo-hyoid muscle Anterior belly of digastric muscle DEEP PORTION OF SUBMAXILLARY GLAND^ ssels farther back, and contain the sublingual glands Dilatation of the latter Dm obliteration of a Rivinian duct, more frequently dilatation of a muciparous imd—and much more rarely dilatation of Wharton's duct—constitutes a ' ranula.' le submaxillary gland can be felt nearer the angle of the jaw lying between its 3sa and the mucous membrane, especially if pressure is made from outside. 16 attachment of the genio-hyo-glossi can be felt behind the symphysis: the I i^ision of it allows the tongue to come well out of the mouth; but when both ve to be divided, the tongue loses much of its steadiness, and may easily fall [ck over the larynx during the administration of the anaesthetic or, later on, in !ep. It should therefore be secured forwards for a while with silk. When the 4C1122 SUBGICAL AND TOPOGBAPHICAL ANATOMY mouth is widely open, the pterygo-mandibnlar ligament can be seen and felt beneat the mucous membrane, behind the last molar tooth. Just below and in front c the lower attachment of this ligament, the lingual nerve can be felt lying clos to the bone below the last molar. It can be divided here to give relief from pai in incurable cancer of the tongue, at a point where it crosses a line drawn fror the last molar tooth to the angle of the jaw, by entering a knife nearly three-quarteij of an inch behind and below the tooth, and cutting towards it on the bone (Moore j Another method is to draw the tongue out of the mouth and expose the ner^i where it lies superficially under the mucous membrane thus made prominen (Koser.)

When a patient breathes deeply through the mouth, the soft palate raised, the pillars are separated, and the tonsils and the back of the phary; are exposed. TONSILS.—The relations of the tonsils should be carefully examined. Thus tb ■ are separated externally by the superior constrictor and pharyngeal aponeuro from the ascending pharyngeal and internal carotid arteries. The extent to whi the tonsil is covered by the anterior pillar, how far it projects upwards beneath t soft palate or downwards into the pharynx, have all important bearings on t question of removal. Its position corresponds to the angle of the jaw. Wh j serious haemorrhage follows operations on the tonsils, it usually comes from one I1123 THE NOSE Fig. 670.—Section of the Nose, showing the Turbinal Bones and Meatuses, WITH THE Openings in Dotted Outline.

The finger introduced downwards at tlie back of the mouth, especially if j parts are rendered insensitive by cocaine, feels the circumvallate papillae, ^ lingual and laryngeal surfaces of the epiglottis, the aryteno-epiglottidean folds, w i the cartilages of Wrisberg and Santorini. If the finger be moved upwards beh.jl the soft palate and turned upwards to the base of the skull, and then forwards |t will impinge on the posterior nares, separated by the vomer, and, within eu nostril, the hinder end of the inferior spongy bones ; above and behind is felt t basilar process of the skull. The size of the nares, one inch by half an inch, and the presence of any adeno:, are especially to be noted. The richness of the naso-pharynx in glandular structui, its proneness to inflammation, and of this inflammation to spread to other part; - e.g. the tympanum—are well known. The finger should be familiar with the fee f adenoids, or of hypertrophied post-nasal lymphatic nodules—soft bodies of irregi t shape blocking up the naso-pharynx. To make out how far this is the case, i g well to take the nasal septum as the starting-point. THE PALATE Between the diverging pillars of the soft palate is the isthmus fauciii, bounded above by the free margin of the palate, and below by the dorsum of b tongue. Of its lateral boundaries, the posterior pillars come nearer each other tl a the anterior. In paring the edges of a cleft soft palate, the following structu s would be, successively, cut through: (1) Oral mucous membrane ; (2) submuc's tissue, with vessels, nerves, and glands ; (3) palato-glossus muscle ; (4) aponeurosi'f tensor palati; ( 5) anterior fasciculus of palato-pharyngeus ; (0) levator palati i i azygos uvulae muscles ; (7) posterior fasciculus of palato-pharyngeus ; (8) submuc tissue, vessels, nerves, and glands; (9) posterior mucous membrane. The : t palate is thicker than it seems, the average in an adult being a quarter of ji inch. The muscles widening a cleft are the tensor and levator, while the supe: p constrictor closes it in swallowing. Of the arteries to the palate, the larges p the descending palatine branch of the internal maxillary. This emerges frp the posterior palatine canal close to the inner side of the last molar tooth, i i runs forward to supply the hard palate. THE NECK Landmarks in the middle line.—Passing from the symphysis to the sujl- clavicular notch is—(1) The body of the hyoid, which is nearly on a level i the angles of the jaw. On either side of the body are the great cornua. \ b upper borders of these are the guide to the lingual artery. Below the hyoid is e thyro-hyoid space, which corresponds with the epiglottis and the upper apertunf the larynx. Thus, if the throat be cut above the hyoid, the mouth will be ope il and the tongue cut into ; if the thyro-hyoid space be cut, the pharynx would fe opened and the epiglottis wounded near its base. Behind the centre of e anterior margin of the thyroid is the rima glottidis. The projection of the thyi 1 notch is much more distinct in men than in women or children. It does 't appear before puberty, and thus flatness of the thyroid must be expected when e landmarks for tracheotomy are sought for in children with short fat necks. ^. e cricoid, on the other hand, is always to be made out. It corresponds in horizoi |1 plane to the following:—(1) The fifth cervical vertebra. (2) The junction f1125 THE NECK larynx and oesophagus : from the narrowing of the tube here, foreign bodies may dge at this point and cause dyspnoea by pressing on the air-tube in front. The icoid is taken as the centre of the incision in oesophagotomy, and also for Hgature the common carotid. (3) The junction of larynx and trachea. (4) The crossing the omo-hyoid over the common carotid. (5) The middle cervical ganglion.

When the neck is stretched, about three-quarters of an inch more is gained, hus, as a rule, there are not more than seven or eight tracheal rings above the iernum. Of these, the second, third, and fourth are covered by the thyroid isthmus. I'he parts met with in the middle line—(ft) above, and {h) beloAV the isthmus—should ■ borne in mind -.—(a) Thin superficial fascia, branches of transverse cervical and framandibular nerves, lymphatics, cutaneous arteries, anterior jugular veins—with eir transverse branches smaller above,—deep fascia, sterno-hyoids, cellular tissue, iiperior thyroid vessels, and tracheal layer of deep fascia. The importance of this1126 SURGICAL AND TOPOGBAPHICAL ANATOMY \ last is twofold, as, first, the tube in tracheotomy may be passed between it and tti trachea, and after a wound in this region this layer, continuous with the pericardii^ I may conduct discharges into the mediastina. (b) The surface structures are muci the same, but the anterior jugular veins and their transverse branches are mucf larger. The inferior thyroid veins are also larger. A thyroidea ima may ij present, and the innominate artery, which often crosses the trachea above tlj sterno-clavicular joint, may do so as high as the seventh tracheal ring. Tli trachea is also smaller, deeper, and less steadied by muscles. The thymus, to| in young children may prove a difficulty. Thus, in children, the high operatic i incising the cricoid and crico-tracheal membrane, if needful, is to be preferred. I I Fig. 673.—Anterior and Lateral Cervical Muscles. i The sterno-mastoid is the landmark for several important operations. Its ini border, the better marked of the two, overlaps the carotids; the common caro corresponding, as far as the upper border of the thyroid, with a line drawn from i sterno-clfivicular joint to midway between the mastoid process and the anglei the jaw. The artery can be best compressed above the level of the cricoid, here it is less deeply covered. The transverse process of the sixth cervical vertei ; is called the carotid tubercle, after Chassaignac, who advised compression of 1 carotid at this point. This process lies two to three inches above the clavi(| Compression below it will command the vertebral as well. The student sho«; recall the deep relations of the sterno-mastoid, which he may classify as vesf:i nerves, muscles, glands, bones; or, according to their position, (1) those above i level of the angle of the jaw; (2) those between the angle of the jaw and i1127 THE NECK imo-hyoid ; (3) those below the omo-hyoid. The position of the anterior jugular, iurving outwards to pass beneath both origins of the muscle a little above the ilavicle, and the external jugular, crossing at a varying level the outer border of he clavicular origin, must be remembered in such operations as tenotomy here. Chese veins are joined by numerous transverse branches, getting larger below. Behind the sterno-clavicular joint lie the commencement of the innominate eins, the bifurcation of the innominate artery on the right, and the common arotid artery on the left ; deeper still lie the pleura and lung.

That to the artery is derived from No. iii. at the scalenus antieus.1134 SURGICAL AND TOPOGBAPHICAL ANATOMY i The following uses and important points with regard to the anatom}^ of the deep cervical fascia should be noted. (A) It forms certain definitely enclosed spaces in which pus or growths may form, and by the walls of which these morbid structures may be tied down and thus rendered difficult of diagnosis, while their increasing pressure may embarrass the air-passages, etc. Thus : (1) In the first space, which lies between No. 1 and the skin, the structures met with, platysma I and superficial branches of the eervical plexus, are unimportant. Any abscess here is prone to extend, but superficially. (2) In the second space, between the superficial and sterno-clavicular layers, lies a narrow space containing loose cellular j tissue and lymphatic glands. Suppuration here is very common, but usually comes forwards. (3) This is the largest and most important of all. It is bounded in front by the sterno-clavicular, and behind by the prevertebral layer. Its contents are—larynx, trachea, oesophagus, thyroid, carotid sheath, glands; and below^, brachial plexus, subclavian artery, and abundant loose cellular tissue for the movements of the neck. Suppuration is somewhat rarer here; but either pus or growths, if ' confined in this space, may have baleful effects, from pressure, or from their tendency to travel behind the sternum. (4) This space, between the prevertebral , layer in front and muscles behind, is very limited. Retropharyngeal abscess forms here, and the dyspnoea it causes is thus explained. (B) The deep cervical fascia gives sheaths or canals to certain veins which perforate it, e.g. the external jugular. These are thus kept patent, and a ready passage of blood ensured from the head and neck. The carotid sheath is another and different instance. (C) It helps to resist atmo- spheric pressure. (D) Mr. Hilton's suggestion as to its action on the pericardium has already been mentioned. SUPERFICIAL ANATOMY OF THE THORAX Bony points.—The top of the sternum corresponds (in inspiration) to the fibro- cartilage between the second and third thoracic vertebrae, and is distant about two and a half inches from the spine. If traced downwards, the subcutaneous sternum presents a ridge opposite to the junction of the manubrium and body, and with the second costal cartilages on either side. At its lower extremity the xiphoid cartilage usually retires from the surface, presenting the depression of the scrobiculus cordis, or ' pit of the stomach.' This is opposite to the seventh costal cartilages and the expanded upper end of the recti, and corresponds to the ninth thoracic vertebra behind. Sterno-clavicular joint.^—The expanded end of the clavicle and the lack of proportion between this and the sternal facet, on which largely depends the mobility of this the only joint that ties the upper extremity closely to the trunk, can be easily made out through the skin. Behind the joint lie, on the right side, the innominate artery, right innominate vein, and pleura; on the left, the left innominate vein, the left carotid, and the pleura. Acromio-clavicular joint.—On tracing the clavicle outwards it is found to rise somewhat to its articulation with the acromion. This joint has very little mobility, \ and owes its protection to the strong conoid and trapezoid ligaments hard by. \ Owing to the way in which the joint-surfaces are bevelled, that of the clavicle looks obliquely downward, and it is an upward displacement of the clavicle which usually takes place on to the acromion. i Ribs.—In counting these, the position of the second is denoted by the transverse I ITHE THOBAX 1135 be at the junction of tlie manubrium and body of the sternum. The nipple, in [he male, lies between the fourth and fifth, nearly an inch outside their cartilages, he lower border of the great pectoral corresponds to the fifth rib. The seventh, le longest of the ribs, is the last to articulate with the sternum. When the arm 5 raised, the first three digitations seen of the serratus magnus correspond to the ixth, seventh, and eighth ribs. The ninth is the most oblique.

Owing to the obliquity of the ■ibs, their sternal ends are on a much lower level than their vertebral extremities. Thus the first rib in front corresponds to the fourth rib behind, the second to the iiixth, the third to the seventh, the fourth to the eighth, the fifth to the ninth, the sixth to the tenth, and the seventh to the eleventh. If a horizontal line be drawn 'ound the body from before backwards, at the level of the inferior angle of the1130 SUBGICAL AND TOPOGRAPHICAL ANATOMY scapula, along the inner side of the arm (along the intercosto-humeral nerve, i scapula, while the arms are at the sides, the line would cut the sternum in froni between the fourth and fifth ribs, the fifth rib at the nipple line, and the ninth rit at the vertebral column ' (Treves). Those most frequently broken are the sixth seventh, and eighth. The way in which the ribs are embedded in the soft parts' and the fact that the fragments are often held in place by the periosteum, account;; for the difficulty which is often met with in detecting crepitus. The intercosta^ spaces are wider in front than behind. The three upper are the widest of all. Structures passing through the upper aperture of the thorax.—If a horizonta section is made passing through the manubrium sterni, upper border of the first rib and upper part of the first thoracic vertebra, the following structures are met with ' (1) In the middle line. Sterno-hyoid and sterno-thyroid muscles, with their sheathi of deep cervical fascia, cellular tissue in which are the remains of the thyroid gland the inferior thyroid veins, the trachea and tracheal fascia, the oesophagus and longu colli muscles. Between the trachea and oesophagus are the recurrent laryngea nerves. (2) On each side. The apex of the lung, covered by pleura, rises abou an inch and a half above the first rib. Between it and the trachea and oesophagu, lie the following: the internal mammary artery, the phrenic nerve; on the righ side, the innominate vein and artery, with the vagus between the two, the cardiai| nerves, and the right lymphatic duct. On the left side are the common carotid anc Fig. 683.—Section of the Sixth Left Intercostal Space, at the Junction of THE Anterior and Posterior Thirds. (Tillanx.) INTERC Intercostal vein.

The mamma.—This lies over the sheath of the pectoralis major, between thi third and fifth, sixth, or seventh ribs in the female. In the male the nipple i placed in the fourth space, nearly an inch outside the cartilages of the fourth am fifth ribs. On the nipple itself open the fifteen or twenty ducts which dilate beneatl it, and then diverge and break up for the supply of the lobules. The skin over th areola is very adherent, pigmented, and fatless. Here also are groups of littl swellings corresponding to some twenty large sebaceous follicles. The skin ove the breast is freely movable, and united to the fascia which encases the orgaiii and thus to the interlobular connective tissue, by bands of the same structure- the ligamenta suspensoria. Under the breast, and giving it its mobility, is i cellulo-fatty layer, the seat of submammary abscess. The nerves Avhich suppb the breast are the anterior cutaneous branches of the second, third, fourth and fifth intercostal nerves, and the lateral branches of the last three. Th connection of these trunks serves to explain the diffusion of the pain oftei observed in painful affections of the breast. Thus pain may be referred t the side of the chest and back (along the above intercostal trunks), over th1137 THE MAMMJE ranch of the second intercostal), or up into the neck, probably along the supra- lavicular branch from the cervical plexus, which communicates with the second itercostal (Treves).

Parts behind manubrium.—There is little or no lung behind the first bone of the ernum, the space being occupied by the trachea and large vessels as follows:— 4 D1138 SURGICAL AND TOPOGBAPHICAL ANATOMY The left innominate vein crosses behind the sternum just below its upper bordei Next come the great primary branches of the aortic arch. Deeper still is th trachea, dividing into its two bronchi opposite to the junction of the first an second bones of the sternum. Deepest of all is the oesophagus. About one inc from the upper border of the sternum is the highest part of the aortic arch, lyin on the bifurcation of the trachea. (Holden.) Outline of the lungs. Their relation to the chest-wall.—The apex of the lun rises about an inch and a half (from half an inch to an inch and three-quarters above the first rib into the base of the posterior triangle lying behind the inner en of the clavicle, the sterno-mastoid, and the anterior scalene, covered by the pleui and deep cervical fascia, and having the subclavian artery arching over it. Froi the apices the thin anterior borders converge inwards behind the sterno-claviculg: joints and the first piece of the sternum to the junction of this with the secon( Fig. 685.—Outline of the Heart, its Valves, and the Lungs (shaded). (Holden. almost meeting at this point. Thence the two borders descend parallel and close each other (the right sometimes passing just beyond the middle line), and th covering over the heart and large vessels, to a point midway between the four pair of costal cartilages, where they diverge, but not to an equal degree. The rig descends in an almost straight line as far as the sixth chondro-sternal joint. T. left is deeply notched (incisura cardiaca). The lower borders of the lung pass dow' wards and outwards across the sides of the chest from the sixth chondro-sterH joint to the tenth thoracic spine. In the nipple-line the lung reaches the sixth ri i in the posterior fold of the axilla, the eighth, and opposite the angle of the scapn (the arms being close to the sides) the tenth rib. Thus, to map out the lung, a li: should be drawn from the apex, a point about an inch and a half above the fii | rib, a little outside the sterno-mastoid muscle, obliquely inwards, behind the stern | clavicular joint, to near the centre of the junction of the first and second bones ; the sternum. Thence, on each side, a line should be drawn slightly convex as fi iBELATIONS OF THE LUNGS TO THE CHEST-WALLS 1139 l^s a similar point on the sternum lying opposite the articulation of the fourth jihondro-sternal joint. On the right side the line may be dropped as low as the fixth chondro-sternal joint; on the left (to show the jncisura cardiaca) a line should )e drawn sloping outwards from the fourth chondro-sternal articulation along he lower border of the fourth rib, across the fourth interspace, to a point about an nch and a half below the left nipple (male) and an inch to its inner side. This )oint, lying in the fifth space, marks the apex of the heart. The lower border of he lung will be marked on the right side by a line drawn from the sixth hondro-sternal articulation across the side of th6 chest down to the tenth thoracic ipine. The lower border of the left lung will follow a similar line, starting on a evelwith a similar joint (sixth chondro-sternal joint), but much farther out than on Ihe right side, i.e. in the fifth space, about three inches to the left of the middle ine.^ This margin of the lung descends about an inch and a half in deep nspiration, according to Godlee. The "position of the great fissure in each lun^ nay be ascertained approximately by drawing a Hne from the second thoracic spine 0 the sixth rib in the nipple line ; and the smaller fissure of the right lung extends Fig. G86.—Diagram of the Kelations of the Thoracic Viscera to the Walls of the Chest.

It will be seen from the above that there is little lung behind the jianubrium. The connective tissue here between the lung margins contains up to aiberty the thymus, and, later, its remains. The pleura reaches much lower down Ipan the lung. Thus its lower margin reaches along the seventh rib cartilage near lie sternum ; in the axillary line it has reached the lower margin of the ninth rib ; irther back it reaches as low as the twelfth rib, or the eleventh thoracic spine. Thus may be opened in operations in the loin, e.g. on the kidney, or in removing the kelfth rib. Mr. Holden thus draws attention to this lower level of the pleura : Since the pleura lines the inside of the last rib, a musket-ball or other foreign body, )ose in the pleural sac and rolling on the diaphragm, might fall to the lowest art of the sac, which would be between the eleventh and twelfth ry^s. The ball light be extracted here. The chest might also be tapped here, but not with a •ocar, since a trocar would penetrate both layers of pleura, and go through the iaphragm into the abdomen. The operation should be done cautiously by an icision beginning about two inches from the spine, on the outer border of the rector spinas, on a level between the spines of the eleventh and twelfth thoracic 4 D 21140 SUBGICAL AND TOPOGBAPHICAL ANATOMY vertebrfe. The intercostal artery will not be injured if the opening be made below the middle of the space, which is very wide.' Outline of the heart. Its relation to the chest-wall.—The differences which exist in various accounts of the limits of the heart may be accounted for by th( fact that its position is not exactly the same in different people, and that the hearts position may be more or less misplaced by diseases at some distance from it. Th( upper limit of the heart (base) will be defined by a line crossing the sternum j little above the upper border of the third costal cartilage, reaching about half ai inch to the right and about one inch to the left. Its apex corresponds to a poin in the fifth space, about two inches below the male left nipple, and an inch to tb( inner side. This point will be about three inches from the left border of thi sternum. The right border (right auricle) ^vill be given by a line, slightly conve: outwards, drawn from the right extremity of the upper border to the right seventl chondro-sternal joint. If another line, similarly slightly convex, be drawn onward from this point across the last piece of the sternum, just above the xiphoid cartilage Fig. 687.—Anterior View of Fcbtal Heart, Vessels, and Lungs. ao7-ta '■ to the apex, it will give the lower border (right ventricle), which rests on the centij tendon of the diaphragm. The left border (left ventricle) will be given by a lir I convex to the left, passing from the left extremity of the upper border to the ap(; well inside the nipple line. This line should be three inches from the middle the sternum at the level of the fourth costal cartilage. j If a circle two inches in diameter be described around a point midway betwe ■ the left nipple and the lower end of the gladiolus, it will define with sufficie accuracy for practical purposes that part of the heart which lies immediate! behind the chest wall, and which is uncovered by lung or pleura. (Latham.) The valves.—The pulmonary valves (the most superficial) lie, in front of t j aortic, behind the left chondro-sternal joint, and opposite to the upper border j the third costal cartilage. The aortic valves lie behind and a little below the j opposite to the inner end of the third intercostal space, and on a level with t ^ lower border of the third costal cartilage. The auriculo-ventricular openin j lie at a somewhat lower level than that of the aortic and pulmonary. Thus t j, BELATION OF LABGE VESSELS TO THE CHEST-WALLS 1141 tricuspid valves lie behind the sternum at the level of the fourth intercostal space ; and the mitral valves, the most deeply placed of all, lie a little to the left of these, behind the left edge of the sternum and the fourth left costal cartilage. ' Thus these valves are so situated that the mouth of an ordinary-sized stetho- scope will cover a portion of them all, if placed over the juncture of the third inter- costal space, on the left side, with the sternum. All are covered by a thin layer of 'lung; therefore we hear their action better when the breathing is for a moment suspended.' (Holden.) The reader will remember that abnormal murmurs resulting from a diseased 3ondition of these valves do not correspond with their exact anatomical position. Thus aortic murmurs are best heard at the second right costal or ' aortic ' cartilage ; mitral murmurs at the apex beat; tricuspid ones near the ensiform cartilage. Relation of vessels to the wall of the thorax.—Aortic arch.—The ascending [part reaches from a spot behind the sternum, a little to the left of the centre, on a level with the third left costal cartilage, to the upper border of the second right bartilage ; thus it passes upwards, backwards, and to the right, and is about two inches |long. The transverse part then crosses to the left behind the sternum (the highest part of the arch being about an inch below the notch), reaching from the second right costal cartilage to the lower border of the fourth thoracic vertebra on the left side. This part recedes from the surface, and, with the next, cannot be marked out pn the surface. The third, or descending part, the shortest of the three, reaches i'om the lower border of the fourth to that of the fifth thoracic vertebra. Innominate artery.—A line drawn from the top of the arch, about an inch jelow the sternal notch, and a little to the right of the centre, to the right sterno- plavicular joint, will give the line of this vessel. ; Left common carotid.—This vessel will be denoted by a line somewhat similar |]o the above, passing from the level of the arch a little to the left of the last starting point to the left sterno-clavicular joint. Left subclavian artery.—A line from the end of the transverse arch, behind :he left of the sternum, straight upwards to the clavicle, delineates the vertical thoracic course of the long left subclavian artery. (Sheild.) Innominate veins.—The left, three inches long, extends very obliquely from ■jhe left sterno-clavicular joint, to a point half an inch to the right of the sternum. In the first intercostal space. The right, about an inch long, descends almost i/ertically to the above point from the right sterno-clavicular joint. Venae cavse.—The superior descends from the point above given for the meeting )f the innominate veins in the first intercostal space, close to the sternum, and Derforates the right auricle on a level with the third costal cartilage. The inferior 7ena cava.—The opening of this vein into the right auricle lies under the middle )f the fifth right interspace and the adjacent part of the sternum. Internal mammary artery.—This descends behind the clavicle, the costal cartilages, and the first six spaces, about half an inch from the edge of the sternum. |[n the sixth intercostal space it divides into musculo-phrenic and superior epigastric irteries. THE ABDOMEN ' Skin markings ; bones and muscular landmarks.—The linea alba, or meeting pf the aponeuroses of the great abdominal muscles over, under, and between the ^'Bcti, reaches from the apex of the xiphoid cartilage to the symphysis. It is best narked above the umbilicus. Its little vascularity and comparative thinness fit ibis line for the point of election for operations on the abdominal cavity. In the1142 SURGICAL AND TOPOGBAPHICAL ANATOMY linea alba, a little below its centre, is the umbilicus. This corresponds to the level of the fibro-cartilage between the third and fourth lumbar vertebra, the tip of the third lumbar spine (Windle), the highest point of the iliac crests, and a point three-quarters of an inch to one inch above the bifurcation of the aorta. On each side of the linea alba, and about two and a half to three inches from it (according to the muscular development), a line, curved with a slight convexity outwards, the linea semilunaris, denotes the point of division of the abdominal aponeuroses, reaching from the ninth costal cartilage to the pubic spine. Between the linea alba and the linea semilunaris run the three lineae transversas, of which one is placed at the umbilicus, another at the xiphoid cartilage, and a third between the two, on a level with the tenth costal cartilage. There is, rarely, a fourth below the umbilicus. In very corpulent subjects two deep transverse furrows run across the abdomen. One runs across the navel and completely conceals it. The other is lower down, just Fig. G88.—Obliquus externus and Fascia lata. Aponeurosis of obliquus externus SPERMATIC CORD Origin of eremaster Loops of eremaster 11' above the fat of the pubes. In tapping the bladder above the pubes in such a case the trocar should be introduced where this line intersects the linea alba. (Holden. A transverse line drawn from one anterior superior spine to the other is abou the level of the promontory of the sacrum. Such a line will always show whethe the pelvis is horizontal or not. (Holden.) Poupart's ligament corresponds to a line drawn with a slight curve downward between the anterior superior spine and the pubic spine. The first of these bon; prominences corresponds to the starting point of the above ligament, the attachmen: of the fascia lata to the ilium, the meeting of the fleshy and aponeurotic parts o j the external oblique (denoted by a line drawn upwards from this spine to the nintl, costal cartilage, or often a little anteriorly to these points), the point of emergence o the external cutaneous nerve, and part of the origins of the internal oblique, transver | salis, and tensor vaginae femoris. The pubic spine marks the outer pillar of th I external abdominal ring, the mouth of which corresponds to the crest, or that parTHE ABDOMINAL BINGS 1143 of the pubes lying between the spme and the symphysis. The ring, and especially its outer pillar, can easily be felt by invaginating the scrotal skin with a finger, and Fig. 689.—The Pectoralis Minor, Obliquus Internus, Pyramidalis, and Kectus Abdominis. ijor1144 SUBGICAL AND TOPOGRAPHICAL ANATOMY ! pushing upwards and outwards. In a female patient, if the thigh be abducted, the tense tendon of the adductor magnus will lead up to the site of the ring. The internal ring is situated about half an inch above the centre of Poupart's ligament; oval in shape, and nearly vertical in direction, it has the arching fibres of the transver- salis above it, and to its inner side the deep epigastric artery. The canal runs obliquely downwards and forwards between the two rings. In the adult it is about an inch and a half long, but in early life, and in adults with a large hernia dragging upon the parts, the two rings are much nearer, and may be one behind the other. If the external ring be exposed, and the finger thrust carefully up the canal, the following structures will be noted :—After the finger has carefully dilated the canal, its tip will be prevented from entering the abdomen by the infundibuliform fascia. If it be pressed downwards it will feel Poupart's ligament, which, with the meeting of the fascia transversalis, forms the floor ; above, it will be arrested by the arching fibres of the internal oblique and transversalis, coming down to the pectineal line to form the conjoined tendon. Towards the abdominal wall the finger will feel the aponeurosis of the external oblique stretching over the whole anterior aspect of the canal; if turned towards the belly cavity, the finger would feel less resistant layers, viz. extra-peritoneal fat and peritoneum, and, behind the external ring, the conjoined tendon. The finger would of course also take notice of the spermatic cord in the male and the round ligament in the female, and investigate any thickening of the former, and isolate the vas deferens. Vessels in the abdominal wall.—The three superficial branches of the common femoral, the external pudic (superior and inferior), epigastric and circumflex iliac, supply the lower part of the abdominal wall and the adjacent groin and genitals. The only others that have to be remembered are the deep epigastrics and epigastric branch of the internal mammary, the deep circumflex iliacs, the last two inter- costals, and the abdominal branches of the lumbar arteries. Of these, the deep epigastric is the most important ; its course will be marked out by a line drawn from a point just internal to the centre of Poupart's ligament, upwards and inwards to the inner side of the internal ring, and thence to a point about midwaj between the pubes and umbilicus. Here the vessel, which at first lies between the I peritoneum and fascia transversalis, perforates the latter and, passing over the fold i of Douglas, enters the sheath of the rectus.

The sixth and seventh intercostals supply the skin over | ' the pit of the stomach'; the eighth the area of the middle linea transversa ; the tenth { that of the umbilicus ; the last thoracic, ilio-inguinal and ilio-hypogastric, the region, above Poupart's ligament, and that of the pubes. The ilio-hypogastric supplies i the skin over the external ring; the ilio-inguinal that over the cord and scrotum.} The last thoracic and ilio-hypogastric cross the iliac crest to supply the skin of the! buttock. j Viscera and visceral regions.—The general form of the abdominal space, and; the relations of the several organs before they are disturbed from their normal, positions, are given on pages 994 and 995. The arbitrary regions into which the | abdomen is usually divided are described at the end of this article. i The diaphragm.—The upper limit of the abdomen rises to the following levels : \ Its central tendon to about the lower end of the sternum, or the seventh chondro- sternal joint; the right half to about the level of the fifth rib, or about one inch below the nipple ; the left half not rising quite so high.BELATION OF VISCEBA TO THE ABDOMINAL WALLS 1145 I Viscera behind the liiiea alba.—From above downwards there are the following |(fig. 690):—(1) Above the umbilicus—the left lobe of the liver, the stomach, Ithe transverse colon, part of the great omentum, the pancreas and solar plexus. (2) Below the umbilicus—the rest of the great omentum, covering in the small lintestines and their mesentery. In the child, the bladder occupies a partly labdominal position; and in the adult, the same viscus, if distended, may rise out jof the pelvis and displace the above structures, raising the peritoneum until, if distended half way to the umbilicus, there is an area of nearly two inches safe [for operations above the symphysis flinea alba. The gravid uterus also rises along the Fig. 690.—The Viscera as seen on fully opening the Abdomen without Disarrangement of the Internal Parts. (After Sarazin.) Faleiform- ligament of liver TRANSVERSE- COLON -DIAPHRAGM -GREAT OMENTUM -SMALL INTESTINE SIGMOID FLEXURE The liver.—In the erect position, the anterior thin edge of the liver projects about lalf an inch below the costal cartilages, but can only be made out with difficulty Q this position. It may be also displaced downwards by pleuritic effusion or tight The liver is also, proportionately, much larger in little children. Of the three parts of the liver (according to the regions which it occupies), that n the right hypochondrium corresponds to the lower margin of the thorax ; but in he epigastric region the anterior margin, running obliquely across from the ninth ight to the eighth left costal cartilage, crosses the middle line about a hand's readth below the sterno-xiphoid articulation (.Godlee). The size of the left lobe aries. In infants it will occupy the left hypochondrium ; in adults its extent to the 3ft will vary from a point an inch and a half or two inches beyond the sternum to the acmg1146 SURGICAL AND TOPOGRAPHICAL ANATOMY left nipple line. The level of the upper border varies also with position, respiratioi etc. It may be represented, on the right, by a line drawn about one inch below tfc nipple, along- the seventh rib, towards the middle line, the fifth chondro-sterna joint, and the sterno-xiphoid articulation (or central tendon of the diaphragm) on the left side it does not reach quite so high : thus its level would be marke by the sixth chondro-sternal joint. Behind, the liver would be below the ba^ of the right lung, on a level with the tenth thoracic spine (figs. 718, 719, ar 720). Gall-bladder.—The fundus of this, situated in a fossa on the under surface ( the right lobe of the liver, and having the quadrate lobe to its left, lies opposi to the right ninth costal cartilage, close to the outer edge of the rectus. It is contact with the hepatic flexure of the colon and the first piece of the duodenum. Stomach.—This organ varies in position more than any other, owing to i mobility, save at the cardiac orifice, and to its varying distension.

When much distended, its pyloric end moves to the rig and the organ comes forwards, pushing against the liver and abdominal wall; a upwards, against the diaphragm, and thus against the heart and left lung, moderately distended, the cardia will be found under the seventh left chond sternal joint, about one inch beyond the sternum. The pylorus is very mobile, 1 a spot near the end of the cartilage of the eighth rib will denote it with sufficif accuracy. It is on a deeper plane than the cardia. By joining these two poi with lines representing the lesser and greater curvatures, the stomach can marked out (figs. 718, 719). The usual inaccuracies committed in delineat. the stomach are as follows : The viscus is marked too horizontally—stude: forget its oblique position. The greater curvature and fundus are not marked h: enough on the left side. They are placed high up under the left arch of diaphragm, well to the left of the middle line, as high as the sixth chondro-ster joint. The lesser curvature is usually made too curved and too horizontal. (Shei.BELATION OF VISCEBA TO THE ABDOMINAL WALLS 1147 The pancreas.—This lies a little obliquely behind the stomach, crossing the ^orta, inferior cava, and spine about the junction of the first and second lumbar ertebrffi, or three inches above the umbilicus (fig. 587, page 1024, and fig. 720, )age 1178). A little lower is the third piece of the duodenum, reaching to within \Ai inch of the umbilicus. (Godlee.) Intestines—(A) Small.—The only part of these that can be localised at all ![efinitely is the duodenum and its junction with the jejunum and the ending of he ileum in the caecum. The first piece of the duodenum lies in the right hypo- |hondrium, usually near the gall-bladder {vide siqjra), reaching from the pylorus lipwards, backwards, and to the right. This is the most mobile of the three parts, 'he second, or descending, is in relation with the head of the pancreas, and eaches the right lumbar region, descending as low as the second or third lumbar ertebra. The third, or oblique, portion passes from the third lumbar vertebra )bliquely from right to left across the second, and, ascending, ends in the jejunum )ii the left side of the spine.

(B) Large intestine.—The caecum with its appendix, the ileo-caecal valve and termination of the ileum, occupy the right iliac fossa. The valve is in a line drawn lorizontally inwards from the anterior superior line for about three inches from hat point (Sheild). The ascending colon, covered by small intestine, hes deeply as it 3asses up over the kidney through the right lumbar region. The hepatic and splenic lexures lie deeply also in the hypochondriac regions, the splenic being much ligher than the hepatic, and behind the stomach, while the former is in contact with lie under surface of the liver. Between the two courses the transverse colon, in ilose contact with the great curvature of the stomach, and varying in position from 3ne, two, or three inches above the umbilicus, to one nearer or even below this point. The descending colon follows a similar course to the ascending; and the sigmoid1148 SUBGIGAL AND TOPOGBAPHICAL ANATOMY flexure occupies the left iliac fossa, and from this point passes over the brim of the | pelvis. Except at its hepatic and splenic flexures, the colon can be examined through I the parietes, aided by an anesthetic. The caecum is the most superficial of all. ! Landmarks for lumbar colotomy.—(1) The lower border and tip of the last rib,| which varies in length ; (2) a point half an inch behind the centre of the ihac' crest, this point being found by accurate measurement along the crest between the! anterior and posterior spines (Allingham); (3) a line drawn vertically upwards I from the last-mentioned point to the last rib.

They lie much highei \ than is usually supposed, the upper part being well covered by the ribs. The right ] is slightly lower than the left. They lie deep in the loins, along the sides of the lasij thoracic and first three lumbar vertebrae.

This point is about one inch below and to the left of the umbilicus, and on a level with a line drawn across the highest part of the iliac crest.

It also corresponds to the lentre of the lower margin or base of the triangular ligament. Its development aries much in different bodies. A httle in front of this point is the bulb, with the Fig. 696.—Male Perineum. (Roser.)

This would also be the level of the rtery of the bulb, so that in lithotomy the incision should always begin below ais point. A knife introduced at the central point, and carried backwards and jery slightly upwards, should enter the membranous urethra just in front of the jrostate. If pushed more deeply it would enter the neck of the bladder. In lateral thotomy the knife is entered an inch and a half in front of the anus and carried ownwards and outwards for two and a half or three inches into the ischio- pctal fossa, ending a little below and external to the mid-point between the anus jnd tuber ischii. This incision begins deeply and ends more superficially. In jie deeper part of the incision the knife is carried along the staff through the lembranous urethra into the bladder.

These can 'ely be felt unless diseased and enlarged. It is within this triangular space that istended bladder can be punctured, the trocar being driven in the direction of the ig axis of the distended viscus, i.e. towards the umbilicus. As a rule, the recto- ical pouch is reflected at a distance of three and a half or even four inches from 4 E 21156 SUBGICAL AND TOPOGBAPHICAL ANATOMY i the anus. In the female the distance is only three inches, or even less. (7) Somi times the lowest of the folds of Houston, on about the same level as the prostat semilunar in form and about half an inch in width, can be made out. The pelvic fascia and its chief layers are shown in fig. 702. The foUowii main points will readily be seen. That the fascia has one important aspe towards the pelvic, and another towards the ischio-rectal fossa and perin^eui and thus may be interfered with during operations, or affected by infiammatic arising in either region. That its numerous processes and sheaths, while th( serve to isolate different structures, are continuous, and that thus septic mischi may, as in the neck, spread most widely. With this fact go two other points : or that with the planes of this fascia run layers of connective tissue ; the other, th in the spaces tightly girt by this fascia lie large venous plexuses, e.g. vesic; hsemorrhoidal, prostatic, and, if septic mischief reach these plexuses, it is out reach of surgical treatment. The closeness of the fascia to the hip joint will all be seen.

These parts have been described elsewhere, and only those points which are of iiportance in a clinical examination will be alluded to here. The labia majora are two thick folds of skin, covered with hair on their outer irface, especially above where they unite (anterior commissure) in the mons eneris. They contain fat, vessels, and dartos, but become rapidly thinner below, here they are continuous with the fourchette in front of the perinasum (their isterior commissure). When the above folds are drawn aside, the labia minora, or nymphse, appear, )t projecting in a healthy adult beyond the labia majora. They are small folds skin, which meet above in the prepuce of the clitoris, and below blend with LB labia majora about their centre. I The gians clitoridis, covered by its prepuce, occupies the middle line above. Fig. 704.—Diagrammatic Eepresentation of the Perineal Structures IN THE Female. I i Below it comes the vestibule, a triangular smooth surface of mucous membrane, iimded above by the clitoris, below by the upper margin of the vaginal orifice, and terally by the labia minora. In the middle line of the vestibule and towards s inner part, about half an inch below the gians clitoridis, and an inch above the Lirchette, is the meatus or opening of the urethra (figs. 703, 704). The vaginal orifice lies in the middle line between the base of the vestibule 'ove, and the fossa navicularis below. Its orifice is partially closed in the virgin ' a fold of mucous membrane, the hymen (fig. 703). This is usually crescentic in ape, attached below to the posterior margin of the vaginal orifice, and with a free ge towards the base of the vestibule. In some cases it is diaphragmatic, i.e. tached all round, but perforated in the centre (fig. 703). The shrivelled remains of the hymen probably constitute the carunculse lyrtiformes. On either side of the vaginal orifice, at its lower part, lie the cemose, muciparous glands of Bartholin, situated beneath the superficial perinealSUBGICAL AND TOPOGBAPHICAL ANATOMY 1158 I fascia and sphincter vaginae.

The parts immediately concerned are the two abdominal ings, external and internal, and the canal. Now it must be remembered at the utset that the rings and canal are only potential—they do not exist as rings r canal save when opened up by a hernia, or when so made by the scalpel. The anal is merely an oblique slit or flat-sided passage. The external and internal ings are so intimately blended with the structures that pass through them, and 0 filled by them, that they are potential rings only. EXTERNAL RING.—This is usually described as a ring: it is really only a separa- ion or gap in the aponeurosis of the external oblique, by which in the male the esticle and cord, and in the female the round ligament by which the uterus is ept tilted a little forwards, pass out from the abdomen. The size of this opening, he development and strength of its sides or pillars, the fascia closing the ring—all ary extremely. Formation: by divergence of two fasciculi of the external oblique poneurosis. Boundaries : two pillars—(1) Internal, the smaller, attached to the 7mphysis and blending with the suspensory ligament of the penis; (2) external, tronger, attached to the pubic spine and blending with Poupart's ligament, and so ith the fascia lata. On this outer, stronger pillar rests the cord (and so the weight f the testicle), or round ligament. Shape : triangular or elliptical, with the base ownwards and inwards towards the pubic spine. Intercolumnar fascia. External spermatic fascia.—This, derived from the ower part of the aponeurosis of the external oblique, ties the two pillars together, nd, being continued over the cord, prevents there being any ring here, unless ade with a scalpel. This is the rule in the body: when any structure passes hrough an opening in a fibrous or muscular layer, it carries with it a coating "f tissue from that layer; e.g. the inferior cava passing through the foramen -.uadratum in the diaphragm, and the membranous urethra through the triangular igament. Effect of position of the thigh on the ring.—As the lower pillar is blended with oupart's ligament, and as the fascia lata is connected with this, movements of he thigh will aflect the ring much, making it tighter or looser. Thus extension nd abduction of the thigh stretch the pillars and close the ring. In flexion and dduction of the thigh the pillars are relaxed; and this is the position in which "eduction of a hernia is attempted. In flexion and abduction of the thigh, the ring1160 SUBGICAL AND TOPOGBAPHICAL ANATOMY is open ; and this is the position in which a patient should sit, to try on a truss, anq cough. If the hernia is now kept up, the truss is satisfactory. j Helping to protect this most important spot, and preventing its being more than a potential ring, are not only the two pillars, and the intercolumnar fascia, but also r structure which has been called a third or posterior pillar, namely, the triangulai' fascia. This has its base above at the lower part of the linea alba, where it joins it; | fellow and the aponeurosis of the external oblique, and its apex downwards and out \ wards, where, having passed behind the internal pillar, it blends with Gimbernat'ii ligament.

INGUINAL CANAL.—This is not a canal in the usual sense, but a chink or fla | sided passage in the thickness of the abdominal wall. The descriptions of th i canal usually given apply rather to the diseased than to the healthy state. It W£ j a canal once, and for a time only, i.e. in the later months of foetal life. It remairsij weak for a long time after, but only a vestige of it remains in the well-made adul j On the inner surface of the abdomen we have a few inconspicuous inguiuM fossettes; on the outer surface a separation between the fasciculi of the externj j oblique, carefully closed and protected ; in the interval between the two surfac( \ lies the cord or round ligament, in the thickness of the abdominal wall. ! Length.—In very early life there is no canal; one ring lies directly behind tb1161 INGUINAL HEBNIA ions le.I| other, so as to facilitate the easy passage of the testis. In the adult it measures about an inch and a half in length, this lengthening being brought about by the growth and separation of the alse of the pelvis. This increased obliquity gives additional safety. Directioi^.—From internal to external ring, downwards, forwards, and in- wards. Boundaries.—For convenience sake, certain limits (largely artificial) have been amed— (1) Floor,—This is best marked near the outlet, where the cord rests on the feooved upper margin of Poupart's ligament. The meeting of the transversalis 3cia with this ligament forms the floor. (2) Boof.—The apposition of the muscles and the arched border of the internal oblique and transversalis. (3) Anterior loall.—Skin, superficial fascia, external oblique for all the way. [nternal oblique, i.e. that part arising from Poupart's ligament, for the outer third or so. (4) Posterior ivall.—For the whole extent, transversalis fascia, extra-peritoneal issue, and peritoneum. For the inner two-thirds, conjoined tendon of internal )blique and transversalis, and the outer edge of the triangular fascia, when leveloped. Of the structures forming the posterior wall the transversalis fascia is he strongest. It is thicker and better marked at its attachments below; these ire—(a) externally, to inner lip of iliac crest; (b) to Poupart's ligament between he anterior superior spine and the femoral vessels : here it joins the fascia iliaca ; c) opposite the femoral vessels it also joins the fascia iliaca, and forms with it a ubular sheath; (d) internal to the femoral vessels the fascia transversalis is attached 0 the ilio-pectineal line, behind the conjoined tendon, with which it blends. INTERNAL EING.—It has already been said that the term ' ring' is here mis- pplied except in an artificial sense, as when an opening is made by a scalpel; or n a pathological one, as when a hernia is making its way by opening up the parts. Che terms ' internal' and ' external' are also misapplied as far as their usual pplication to the middle line of the body is concerned. The terms apply to depth )nly. The ' internal ring ' is not a ring in the least, but merely a funnel-shaped xpansion of the transversalis fascia, which the cord carries on with it as it escapes rom the abdomen. This expansion may be Aveakened, but it is never an opening ave when made so artificially. Site.—Midway between the anterior superior spine and spine of pubes. Shape : val, with the long diameter upwards. Dimensions: one inch by half an inch. 5oth these are artificial. Boundaries : centre of Poupart's ligament, about half an ach below. Internally the deep epigastric artery, and thus the inner side seems be better defined. But the outer side is really the better defined, as here he transversalis fascia is descending to Poupart's ligament, to form the deep crural' arch, and to help to close in the great gap or notch between Poupart's gament and the innominate bone. Owing to the artery lying to the inner side, he incision, in cutting to relieve the deep constriction of an inguinal hernia, hould always be made directly upwards, so as to avoid the above vessel. Coverings.—There are two chief forms of inguinal hernia :— A. The common form: external, or oblique.—External, because it appears it the internal ring) external to the deep epigastric artery. Oblique, because it raverses the whole of the inguinal canal, entering it at its inlet and leaving it at s outlet. B. Rarer form: internal, or direct.—Internal, because it appears internal to 16 deep epigastric artery. Direct, because, instead of making its way down the hole oblique canal, it comes by a short cut, as it were, only into the lower part : the canal, and then emerges by the same opening as the other.1162 SUBGICAL AND TOPOGBAPHICAL ANATOMY A. Oblique, external inguinal hernia.—This obtains its coverings asj follows :— ; (1) At the internal ring, or inlet, it obtains three:—(a) Peritoneum ;| (b) extra-peritoneal fat; (c) infundibuliform fascia, or the layer of transversalisi fascia prolonged at this spot along the cord. (2) In the canal it obtains one. As it emerges beneath the lower border of the internal oblique, it gets some fibres from the cremaster. (3) At the external ring, or outlet, the hernia obtains three, viz.: {a) Inter-, columnar fascia ; (b) superficial fascia ; and (c) skin. B. Direct or internal inguinal hernia.—This does not come through the internal ring, but, making its way through the posterior wall of the lower third of the canal—i.e. the conjoined tendon, either pushing this forward or splitting it—; gets its coverings only from structures in relation to this part of the canal. They are—(1) Peritoneum; (2) extra-peritoneal fat; (3) transversalis fascia (not thej Fig. 707.—Dissection of the Lower Part of the Abdominal Wall from within, ■ THE Peritoneum having been removed. (Wood.) | External iliac artery specialised part at the internal ring or infundibuliform fascia); (4) conjoin tendon of internal oblique and transversalis. At the outlet of the external ring th coverings obtained are the same as in the oblique hernia, viz. (5) intercolumn" fascia ; (6) superficial fascia ; (7) skin. Hitherto the two forms of inguinal hernia have been considered from the supe ficial aspect, that in which they are met with in practice. The inguinal regio should also be studied as to the posterior aspect of its so-called rings and cana as these have to bear the early stress of a commencing hernia. It is against thi aspect that a piece of omentum or intestine is constantly and insidiously pressin and endeavouring to make its way out. Furthermore, when either of the abo constituents of hernia have made their way a little farther, and got out into th-. internal ring or into the canal, the patient is no longer sound.INGUINAL HEBNIA 1163 On the posterior wall are certain cords and depressions, marking off regions which correspond to those on the surface. Thus, there are three prominent cords, and three fossae. Three cords—(1) Median, or urachiis ; (2) lateral, or the obliterated hypogastric arteries. (1) Median, or urachus. This interesting foetal relic, the intra-abdominal part of the allantois, passes up between the apex of the bladder and the umbilicus, and by so doing—(a) keeps the bladder up, especially in early life, when the pelvic cavity is but little developed; {h) it keeps the bladder well up so that it shall be above the level of the urethra, and so more easily emptied; (c) it provides, by thus keeping up the bladder, that it shall enlarge in a direction which will admit of the greatest amount of distension, i.e. one between the lower or yielding part of the abdominal wall and the hollow of the rectum, which is compressible. (2) The obliterated hypogastric arteries. These, the remains of vessels which during foetal life carry the impure blood of the foetus out to the mother through » Fig. 708.—Vertical Section of Pelvis passing through the Heads of the Thigh Bones.

In relation to these cords are the following foss8B: [a) An internal one, between the urachus and the obliterated hypogastric artery. This corresponds, on the anterior surface, to the external abdominal ring. Through this fossa comes direct inguinal hernia. [h) Between the obliterated hypogastric artery and the deep epigastric artery, running upwards and inwards to form the outer boundary of Hesselbach's triangle, is a middle fossa. This is the smallest of all. (c) The external fossa is outside the deep epigastric artery. It is the most distinct of the three from the way in which the cord or round ligament passes down within a glove-like process of the transversalis fascia. This fossa corresponds to the internal ring. Causes of hernia.—It will be well, while the anatomy of hernia is being con- sidered, to refer briefly to the causes, as many of these are intimately bound up with the anatomy of the parts. Amongst the chief are the following :— (1) Hereditary, viz. weakness of abdominal wall; openness of rings. (2) "Weak spots.—[a] The presence of the cord; {h) deficiency of some of the1164 SUBGICAL AND TOPOGBAPHIGAL ANATOMY layers below; (c) persistence of the original process of peritoneum; {d) a long mesentery or suspensory ligament of the intestines. Mr. Lockwood has shown that the mesentery is relatively larger in infancy, and that there is a rapid decrease after the second year. In adults its length is about eight inches, and any lengthening of the mesentery beyond this point is likely to be combined with a protuberant belly. He shows further, with regard to the range of descent or the excursus of the intestines, that it is extremely rare to find a mesentery so short, or attached so high, as to prevent the intestines escaping or being drawn from the abdomen. The long mesentery of infancy and childhood is usually associated with con- FiG. 709.—Transversalis Abdominis and Sheath of Eectus. • Serratus magnus Lumbar fascia siderable downward descent of the intestine ; and in the adult it is quite common to find that the small intestines will pass an inch and a half beyond the right crural arch, one inch beyond the pubes, and up to the left crural arch. (3) Stretching of the abdominal walls by pregnancies, etc. (4) Increase of the volume and weight of the parts within : e.g. omentum by deposit of fat in it. (5) Sex. Thus, men have larger inguinal rings. Women have a larger femoral arch, and one less well filled in by muscles, and with less strong fasciae meeting, e.g. iliac and transversalis. (6) Cough, asthma, bronchitis, habitual fretfulhess or crying.1165 FEMORAL HERNIA (7) (8) (9) (10) (11) Straining to expel urine, as with phimosis, stricture, stone in bladder, etc. Straining in defsecation.

FEMORAL HERNIA As many of the parts concerned here are also met with in inguinal hernia, one description, given now, will suffice. With regard to descriptions of the inguinal and femoral regions, it is always well to bear in mind the following :—(1) That the so-called rings and canals are merely weak spots in the inguinal and femoral regions, and that they do not exist Fig. 710.—Superficial Dissection of the Inguinal and Femoral Regions. (Wood.) Superficial epiga<iiric artery Inguinal lymphatic glands Intereolumnar fascia - External abdominal ring Saphenous opening Superior external pudic ai^terif ILIO-INGUINAL NERVE Internal saphena vein Femoral lymphatic glands Pouparfs ligament Intereolumnar fibres of external oblique Superficial ciixumjlex iliac artery Deeper layer of fascia (reflected), the superflcial vessels being left attached to the external oblique Superficial layer of fascia (reflected) distinctly, and do not get beyond the potential stage, unless made by a scalpel or a hernia ; (2) that at the fold of the groin most of the layers blend together, and that descriptions of them as separate layers, for convenience sake in learning them, is more or less artificial; (3) that the description of these layers has been most needlessly complicated by the number of terms used, many of which are simply substitutes for others; (4) many of these terms are not only useless but incorrect, e.g. saphenous, crural, etc. Parts concerned in femoral hernia. (1) Skin and superficial fascia of groin.—The latter consists of two layers: (a) Superficial layer of superficial fascia.—Fatty, met with over the whole groin, and continuous with the superficial fascia of the rest of the body, {h) Deep layer of superficial fascia.—Thin and membranous, only met with over the lower third of the abdominal wall and to1166 SUBGICAL AND TOPOGBAPHICAL ANATOMY | the inner side of the groin. It is continuous through the scrotum with the deep | layer of the superficial fascia of the perineum. Just below Poupart's ligament it is ! joined to the fascia lata. From these last two facts it results that in rupture or j giving way of the urethra the extravasated urine may come forwards by way of [ the genitals, and from the continuity of the fascia make its way on to the abdomen, ! but not down on to the thigh. ! Between the two layers of superficial fascia lie the superficial glands of the groin, the superficial branches of the common femoral artery, one or two cutaneous nerves i and some veins descending to the saphenous opening to join the long saphena vein. | (2) Poupart's lig^ament.—This is also known as the crural arch, a misnomer, ! as ' crus' means leg. A description of its shape and attachments is given on | page 1144. Owing to the connection of the fascia lata to its lower border, the i ' saphenous opening,' which is situated in the fascia lata, and has its upper cornu ! blending with Poupart's ligament, will be affected by movements of the thigh, [ much as is the external abdominal ring, being tightened and stretched when the ! limb is extended and abducted, relaxed when it is adducted and flexed. The parts beneath it which block up the gap between it and the innominate ' bone are of the utmost importance in preventing the escape of a femoral hernia. (3) Gimbernat's ligament.—This is merely the triangular internal attachment of Poupart's ligament. Its apex is attached to the pubic spine ; of its three borders the base is free towards the vein and the femoral canal. Its upper border is continuous with Poupart's ligament, its lower is attached to the ilio-pectineal line. (4) Fascia lata.—Two portions are described over the upper part of the thigh :— {a) An iliac, external and stronger, attached to Poupart's ligament in its whole extent and lying over the sartorius, ilio-psoas, and rectus, (b) A pubic, internal, weaker, and much less well defined, is attached above to the ilio-pectineal line and the spine of the pubes. The upper cornu of the ' saphenous opening' is at Gim- bernat's ligament, and at the lower cornu the two portions of the fascia blend. Their relation to the femoral vessels.—The iliac portion, being attached along ! Poupart's ligament, passes over these. The pubic portion, fastened down over the : i pectineus, which slopes down on to a deeper plane than the adjacent muscles, passes behind the femoral vessels to end on the capsule of the hip joint. | (5) Saphenous opening.—This is doubly a misnomer. It is not an opening, but !' an oval depression, situated at the spot where the two parts of the fascia lata diverge j on different levels. As without dissection it is not an opening but an oval depression, ! fossa ovalis would have been a better term were it not otherwise employed. Though \ the fascia lata is wanting here, there is no real opening, as the deficiency is made !. up by the deep layer of superficial fascia, or cribriform fascia, which fills up the j opening. The term ' saphenous ' is also misapplied : etymologically it means ' very j evident.' Now it is notorious that in very many subjects this opening only becomes; plain when rendered an artificial one by dissection ; and that thus, with the limited \ opportunities of one or two subjects, it is by no means easy to verify the details i about it which have been described as constant. j Uses of the ' saphenous opening j'—Though a weak spot, it is so on purpose to |' transmit the saphena to the femoral vein, and the superficial to the deep lymphatics, i The depression is present in order to allow the saphena vein to be protected ] from pressure in flexion of the thigh. | Site.—At the inner and upper part of the thigh, with its centre an inch andf a half below and outside the spine of the pubes. \ Diameters.—One inch vertically, by a half or three-quarters of an inch. Shape : \ oval, with its long axis downwards and outwards. Tiuo extremities or coriiua : upper \ blending with Gimbernat's ligament; lower, where the two parts of the fascia lata ■ meet. Ttoo borders: outer also known as the ligament of Hey, or femoral ligament, j or falciform process of Burns. Semilunar in shape, arching downwards and outwards'1167 FEMOBAL HEBNIA from Gimbernat's ligament to the inferior cornu. This Kes over the femoral vessels, md is adherent to them ; to it is fixed superficially the cribriform fascia {vide infra). The inner border is much less prominent, owing to the weakness of the pubic part jof the fascia lata which forms it. (6) Femoral sheath.—This is a funnel-shaped sheath, carried out by the femoral s^essels under Poupart's ligament, and continuous above (in front) with the trans- ^ersahs fascia as it descends to the ligament, lining the inner surface of the Mominal wall, and (behind) with the ihac fascia, and below continuous with the >roper sheath of the femoral vessels. It is not only funnel-shaped, but large and loose, for two reasons : (a) That there plenty of room for the femoral vein, and the slowly moving venous current in it ;o ascend without compression; (h) to allow of all the movements of the thigh ;aking place—flexion and extension—without undue stretching of the vessels. By ,wo connective tissue septa the sheath is divided into three compartments—the )uter for the artery, the middle for the vein, and the internal one for the femoral Wal {vide infra). Thus one septum lies between the artery and vein, and .nother between the vein and the femoral canal (fig. 711). Fig. 711.—Section through the Crural Arch and Sheath of the Femoral Vessels.

Hence a space xists here, perhaps to prevent the thin-walled vein, with its sluggish current, being ressed upon. Thus a slight gap exists here—not a canal, unless so made by a ife or by the dilating influence of a hernia. Length: about three-quarters f an inch.

Lymphatics passing from superficial (groin) :lands to those deep in the iliac fossa. (8) Femoral ring.—This is mainly an artificial product. It is the upper or bdominal opening of the femoral canal. Shape: oval, with its long axis trans- erse. It is larger in women. Boundaries : internally, Gimbernat's ligament; xternally, the femoral vein; in front, Poupart's ligament and the thickening of lie transversalis fascia attached to it, and called ' the deep crural arch ;' behind.1168 SUBGICAL AND TOPOGBAPHIGAL ANATOMY the pectineus and the ilio-pectineal line. It is closed by the septum criirale, which | is a barrier of fatty connective tissue, continuous with the extra-peritoneal fatty | layer, perforated by lymphatics passing from the superficial to the deep group. ! Position of vessels around the ring.—Outside, the femoral vein; above, the! epigastric vessels; towards inner side there may be an unimportant branch j between the epigastric artery above and the obturator below. j If, instead of the above unimportant branch, the obturator artery comes ofii abnormally from the deep epigastric, it will descend, and usually does so, close to the '• junction of the external iliac and common femoral vein, and thus to the outer, and' i !

In a very few cases it curves more inwardi' close to Gimbernat's ligament, and thus to the inner side of the ring, and is the in great danger (fig. 712, B). Sir William Lawrence calculated that this took plac once in a hundred cases. Course of femoral hernia.—At first this is downwards in the femoral cana ■ A pouch of peritoneum having been gradually, after repeated straining, coughing j etc., pushed through the weak spot, the femoral ring, further weakened perhap \ together with all the parts in the femoral arch, by child-bearing, some extra effoi j will force intestine or omentum into this pouch and thus form a hernia. Thu |FEMOBAL HEBNIA 1169 formed, femoral hernia passes at first downwards in the femoral canal as far as the saphenous opening, but, as a rule, does not go farther downwards on the thigh, but iiounts forwards and upwards, and somewhat outwards, even reaching the level 3f Poupart's ligament. The reasons for this change of position are—(1) The larrowing of the femoral sheath, funnel-like, i.e. wide above but narrowed below ; 2) the unyielding nature of the lower margin of the saphenous opening ; (3) the "act that this margin and the outer border are united to the femoral sheath ; 4) the constant flexion of the thigh ; (5) the fact that vessels (chiefly veins) and ymphatics descend to the saphenous opening, the veins to join the saphena vein, md the lymphatics to join the deeper group : these descending vessels serve to cop upwards or suspend a femoral hernia, and thus prevent its further course lown wards. Coverings of a femoral hernia.—(A) At the upper or femoral ring it obtains )eritoneum, extra-peritoneal fat, and septum crurale. (B) In the canal, a coating of the femoral sheath. (C) At the external or superficial opening, further coverings of cribriform fascia, kin, and superficial fascia are added. Some of these may be deficient by the hernia bursting through them, or they may •e matted together. Sir A. Cooper thought this especially likely to occur with the ja,yer of femoral sheath and septum crurale to which he gave the name of fascia Impria, 1 PAETS CONCERNED IN UMBILICAL HERNIA A hernial protrusion at the umbilicus, or exomphalos, may occur at three istinct periods of life, according to the anatomy of the part. Any account of mbilical hernia would be incomplete vdthout an attempt to explain how this region, riginally a most distinct opening, is gradually closed and changed into a knotty aass of scar, the strongest point in the abdominal wall. During the first weeks of foetal life, in addition to the urachus, umbilical arteries, nd vein, some of the membranes and a portion of the intestine pass through the Ipening to join that part of the digestive tract which is developed outside the bdomen up to a certain time, and then re-enters that cavity. Occasionally this ondition persists, owing to failure of development, and the child is born with a urge hernial swelling outside the abdomen, imperfectly covered with skin and eritoneum. To this condition the term congenital umbilical hernia should be pplied. Later on in foetal life it is the umbilical vessels alone which pass through this ening. At birth there is a distinct ring which can be felt for some time after in the accid walls of an infant's belly. If this condition persist, a piece of intestine may nd its way through, forming the condition which should be known as infantile tnbilical hernia. This condition is not uncommon. "Why it is not more frequently met with is s:plained by the way in which this ring of infancy is closed and gradually con- srted into the dense mass of scar tissue so familiar in adult life. This is brought out (1) by changes in the ring itself; (2) by changes in the vessels which pass irough it. (1) Changes in the ring itself.—The umbilical ring is surrounded by a sphincter- ke arrangement of elastic fibres, best seen during the first few days of foetal life, fi the posterior wall of the belly. In older infants these fibres lose their elasticity, 3Come more tendinous, and then shrink more and more. As they contract they Lvide, as by a ligature, the vessels passing through the ring, thus accounting for the ict that the cord, wherever divided, drops off at the same spot and without bleeding. (2) Changes in the vessels themselves.—When blood ceases to traverse these, 4 F1170 SUBGICAL AND TOPOGBAPHICAL ANATOMY their lumen contains clots, their muscular tissue wastes, while the connective tissue j of their outer coat hypertrophies and thickens. Thus the umbilical vessels and the' umbilical ring are, alike, converted into scar-tissue, which blends together. Thisi remains weak for some time, and may be distended by a hernia (infantile). i Finally, we have to consider the state of the umbilicus in adult life. The verj| dense, unyielding, fibrous knot shows two sets of fibres :—(1) Those decussating! in the middle line; and (2) two sets of circular fibrous bundles which interlace al! the lateral boundaries of the ring. The lower part of the ring is stronger than the upper. In other words, umbilical hernia of adult life, when it comes through th( ring itself and not at the side, always comes through the upper part. In the lowei three-fourths of the umbilicus, the umbilical arteries and urachus are firmly closed matting in a firm knot of scar-tissue ; in the upper there is only the umbilical veil j and weaker scar. To the lower part run up the umbilical arteries and the urachus Owing to the rapid growth of the abdominal wall and pelvis before puberty, an< the fact that the urachus and the umbilical arteries, being of scar-tissue, elongat with difficulty, the latter parts depress the umbilicus by reason of their intimat connection with its lower half. ' Coverings of an umbilical hernia.—These, more or less matted together, are :- i (1) Skin ; (2) superficial fascia, which loses its fat over the hernia ; (3) prolonga tion of scar-tissue of the umbilicus gradually stretched out; (4) transversali fascia; (5) extra-peritoneal fatty tissue ; (6) peritoneum. If the hernia com through above the umbilicus, or just to one side, the coverings will be much th same ; but, instead of the layer from the umbilical scar, there will be one fror. the linea alba.

A line from the sixth thoracic spine, almost transversely at first, with increasingly slight obliquity over the inferior angle of the scapula to the axilla and bicipital groove, will mark the upper border of the muscle. Another very oblique line from the point on the iliac crest upwards and outwards to the axilla will give the lower border and the tapering triangular apex of the insertion. The muscle may be attached to the angle of the scapula, or separated from it by a bursa. Triangle of Petit.—This small space lies above the crest of the ilium, at about its centre, bounded by the anterior edge of the latissimus and the posterior border of the external oblique (fig. 713). Origin of spinal nerves.—It is very important to remember the relation of these to the vertebral spines, in determining the results of disease or injury of the cord and the parts thereby affected. The above relation may be given briefly as follows:— The origins of the eight cervical nerves correspond to the cord between the occiput Fig. 717.- -Arrangement of Lumbar Aponeurosis at Level of Third Lumbar Vertebra. Sacro-lumbalis -•Transversalis •Internal oblique """External oblique Latissimus dorsi Quadratus lumborum Longissimus dorsi Psoas magnus and the sixth cervical spine. The upper six thoracic come off between the above spine and that of the fourth thoracic vertebra. The origins of the lower six thoracic nerves correspond to the interval between the fourth and the tenth thoracic spines. The five lumbar arise opposite the eleventh and twelfth thoracic spines ; and the origins of the five sacral correspond to the first lumbar spines. The diagram and table (page 1173), arranged by Dr. Gowers from anatomical and pathological data, show the relation of the origin of the nerves to their exit from the vertebral canal, and the regions supplied by each. Scapula, its muscles and arterial anastomoses.—Amongst the landmarks in the back, the student should be careful to trace the angles and borders of the scapula, as far as these are accessible. The upper border is the one most thickly covered. The upper angle corresponds to the upper border of the second rib ; the lower angle to the seventh intercostal space ; and the root of the spine of the Iscapula to the interval between the third and fourth thoracic spines. Fig. 716 shows !the chief arteries around the scapula. The anastomoses on the acromial process between the suprascapular, acromio-thoracic, and circumflex arteries are not shown.1176 SUBGICAL AND TOPOGBAPHICAL ANATOMY Lumbar fascia.—In the loins, the muscles which fill in the space between the last rib and the crest of the ilium should be carefully noted, owing to the frequency of operations here. When the latissimus dorsi, the oblique, the transversahs, the erector spinae, and quadratus have been described, the lumbar fascia (the posterior aponeurosis of the transversalis), and the three layers into which it divides posteriorly (fig. 717) should be remembered.

SUPERFICIAL ANATOMY OF THE UPPER LIMB THE SHOULDEK The following surface-marks, of the greatest importance in determining t nature of shoulder injuries, can be made out here:—The clavicle in its who: extent, the acromion process, the great tuberosity, and upper part of the shaft the humerus. Much less distinctly, the position of the coracoid process and th head of the humerus can be made out. The anterior margin of the clavic convex internally and concave externally, can be made out in its whole exte" the bone, if traced outwards, being found not to be horizontal, but rising somewh to its junction with the acromion. The tip of this process, when the arm hangs I118] THE SHOULDER he side, is in the same line as the external condyle and the styloid process of the adius. On the inner side, the head and internal condyle of the humerus and the tyloid process of the ulna are in the same line.

The muscle will be marked out by a base-line reaching along the above bony points, and two sides converging from its extremities to the apex, a point on the outer surface of the humerus, about its centre. To map out the pectoralis major, a hne should be drawn down the lateral aspect of the sternum as far as the sixth costal cartilage, and then two others marking the borders of the muscle the upper corresponding to the deltoid, the lower starting from the sixth cartilage, and the two converging to the folded tendon, which is inserted as a double layer into the outer bicipital ridge. The pectoralis minor will be marked out by two lines, from the upper border of the third and the lower border of the fifth rib, just external to' Fig. 727.—Section through the Middle of the Eight Upper Arm i (Heath.)

The depression of the axilla is best marked when the arm is raised from th^ side to an angle of about 45°, and when the muscles bounding it in front an(| behind are contracted. In proportion as the arm is raised, the hollow become less, the head of the humerus now projecting into it. When the folds are relaxe by bringing the arm to the side, the fingers can be pushed into the space so as examine it.

Below the insertion of the deltoid, the outer borde of the bone can be traced downwards into the external supracondyloid ridge. Th inner border and ridge are less prominent. Attached to these ridges and border are the intermuscular septa, each lying between the triceps and brachialis anticuj and the outer one giving origin to the brachio-radialis (supinator longus) an^ Fig. 729.—Back View of the Scapular Muscles and Triceps. extensor carpi radialis longior as well. The outer septum is perforated by tl superior profunda vessels and the musculo-spiral nerve, the inner by the infer: j profunda and anastomotica magna arteries and the ulnar nerve. On either si ] of the well-known prominence of the biceps is a furrow. Along the ou | ascends the cephalic vein. The inner corresponds to the line of the basij vein which lies superficial to the deep fascia below the middle of the arm, a | superficial and internal to the brachial vessels and median nerve. \4 g2 THE ABM 1187 A line drawn along the inner edge of the biceps from the insertion of the teres major to the middle of the bend of the elbow corresponds to the brachial artery. In the upper two-thirds this artery can be compressed against the bone by pressure outwards; in its lower third the humerus is behind it and pressure T [should be made backwards. The superior profunda comes off from the highest part of the artery and courses with the musculo-spiral nerve (page 1188)"; the Fig. 730.—Deep View of the Front of the Upper Arm. y >elow the middle, and courses Avith the ulnar nerve through the intermuscular It eptum to the back of the internal condyle. The anastomotica is given off from ! 'ne to two inches above the bend of the elbow. The centre of the arm is a landmark for many anatomical structures. On the ( [uter side is the insertion of the deltoid; on the inner that of the coraco-brachialis. , The basilic vein and the nerve of Wrisberg here perforate the deep fascia, going in everse directions. The inferior profunda is here given off from the brachial; theSUBGICAL AND TOPOGBAPHICAL ANATOMY 1188 median nerve also crosses the artery, and the uhiar nerve leaves the inner side, of the vessel to pass to the inner aspect of the limb. The brachialis anticus can be mapped out by two pointed processes whict surromid the insertion of the deltoid, and which pass downwards into line.« corresponding to the two intermuscular septa, and then converge over the front o: the elbow to their insertion into the coronoid process. The median nerve can be traced by a line drawn from the outer side of th( third part of the axillary and first part of the brachial artery, across this lattei vessel about its centre, and then along its inner border to the forearm, where i passes between the two heads of the pronator radii teres. The ulnar nerve lies to the inner side of the above arteries as far as the middle of the arm, where it leaves the brachial to course more inwards and perforate th( internal intermuscular septum and get to the back of the internal condyle. The musculo-spiral nerve can be traced by a line beginning behind the thirc part of the axillary artery, then carried vertically down behind the uppermost par of the brachial, and then, just below the posterior border of the axilla, curving backwards behind the humerus and slightly doAvnwards, just below the insertion o the deltoid. Thus, passing from within outwards and from before backwards in it groove with the superior profunda vessels, it again comes to the front by perforating the external intermuscular septum at a point about opposite to the junction of th^ middle and lower thirds of the arm, and passes down in front of the external supra condyloid ridge, lying here between the brachio-radialis and brachialis anticus, ti the level of the external condyle, where it divides into radial and posterior inter osseous. The former of these accompanies the radial artery to the front of th' arm, the latter travels backwards to the back of the forearm. On the back of the arm is the triceps muscle, with its three heads and tendon c insertion, all brought into relief in a muscular subject when the forearm is strongl extended. Of the three' heads the inner is the least distinct, arising below th musculo-spiral groove, reaching to each intermuscular septum, and tapering awa above as high as the teres major. The outer head, arising above the groove as hig as the great tuberosity, appears in strong relief just below the deltoid ; while th middle or long head, arising from the scapula just below the glenoid cavity, appeaij between the teres muscles. The tendon of insertion, passing into the upper and bacj part of the olecranon over a deep bursa, is shown by a somewhat depressed area. Fig. 731.—Vertical Section of the Elbow. (One-half.) (Braune.)

The M-like arrangement of the superficial veins as usually described is by no means constant (figs. 733, 734). The median basilic is the vein usually chosen for venesection, owing to its larger size and its being firmly supported by the subjacent bicipital fascia which separates it from the brachial artery; but the median cephalic is the safer. The median basilic [is crossed by branches of the internal cutaneous nerve, while those of the musculo- cutaneous lie under the median cephalic.

The tendon of the biceps can be easily made out in the centre of the fossa, giving off above the bicipital fascia from its inner side to fasten down the flexors of the forearm. Under the tendon on its inner side lie the brachial artery and the median nerve for a short distance.

The tip of the styloid process corresponds to the inner end of the line of the wrist joint.

The radial styloid process is covered by the extensor ossis metacarpi and primi internodii pollicis, while immediately farther out lies that of the extensor secundi. The bones are nearest to each other in complete pronation, and farthest apart in jcomplete supination. On section, the bones are found at every point nearer to the back than to the front of the limb, but increasingly so above. ' The lower the section proceeds down the limb, the less will the bones be covered at the sides, and the more equally will the soft parts be distributed about the anterior and posterior aspects of the limb. It will be noticed that where one bone is the most substantial the other is the more slender, as near the elbow and wrist; and that it is about the centre of the limb that the two are most nearly of equal strength ' (Treves). When the limb is pronated, the interosseous space is narrowed ; in supination and the mid- position it is widened out. In pronation, both styloid processes can be distinctly Fig. 739.—Section through the Middle of the Eight Forearm. (Heath.) Brachio-radialis Supinator brevis.

Th lower border of the posterior corresponds to the upper margin of the anteric annular ligament. Fig. 751.—Diagram of the Great Palmar Bursa. The palmar fascia, by its strength, toughness, numerous attachments, ar. intimate connection with the superficial fascia and skin, is well adapted to prote the parts beneath from pressure. The thenar and hypothenar muscles are enclos<i in two processes, which are thinner so as not to interfere with the contraction of tl- subjacent muscles. The central part, pointed above at its attachment to tli; annular ligaments, spreads out fan-like below, and gives off four slips whi( bifurcate into two processes, which are attached to the sides of the first phalar; of each finger and into the transverse ligament which ties the heads of tlj metacarpal bones together.

Beneath the central part of the palmar fascia are the superficial arch and its digital branches, the ulnar and median nerves with their branches, the flexors, superficial and deep, with their synovial sheath, and the lumbricales ; then a layer of connective tissue (the only structure which prevents matter pent in by the palmar fascia from making its way back out of the dorsum), the deep arch, the interossei, and the metacarpal bones. In the hypothenar eminence under the fascia are part of the ulnar artery and nerve, the abductor and flexor brevis minimi digiti, the opponens, the deep branch of the ulnar artery and nerve, and the fifth metacarpal bone. The back of the wrist and hand.—The posterior annular ligament has already been described Avith the anterior. On the outer side is the so-called ' snuft'-box space ' (tahaticre anatomique of Cloquet), a triangular hollow, bounded towards the radius by the two first extensors of the thumb, and towards the ulna by the extensor secundi internodii. The scaphoid and trapezium, with their dorsal liga- ments, form the floor. In the roof lie the radial vein and branches of the radial nerve. More deeply is the artery following a line from the apex of the styloid pro- cess to the back of the interosseous space. The different tendons have already been given. Between the first two metacarpal bones is the first dorsal interosseous muscle, which forms .a fleshy projection against the radial side of the index meta- carpal, Avhen the thumb and index are pressed together. On its palmar aspect is the adductor pollicis. Wasting of the former muscle is a ready indication of injury or disease of the ulnar nerve. THE LOWER EXTREMITY THE THIGH , Bony landmarks.—Many of these, such as the anterior superior spine, the spine' of the pubes, have already been mentioned. Trochanter major.—This most valuable landmark is most prominent when thei limb is rotated inwards or adducted ; it lies at the bottom of a depression whenth€ femur is everted. The only structures of importance between it and the skin ar€| the expanded insertion of the gluteus maximus and the bursa beneath the muscleij This is often multilocular. The top of the great trochanter is about three-quarterH of an inch below the level of the femoral head. Nelaton's line.—This most useful guide is a line drawn from the anterioi superior spine to the most prominent part of the tuberosity of the ischium. Ir normal limbs, the top of the great trochanter just touches this line. In dislocation ,: fractures of the neck, and in wasting of the neck as in osteo-arthritis, the relatior of the trochanter to Nelaton's line becomes altered. '. The top of the great trochanter is a guide in Mr. Adams's operation for divisioi' of the neck of the femur, the puncture being made and the saw entered one inci above and about one inch in front of this point. 1 Bryant's triangle.—Mr. Bryant makes use of the following in deciding th<j position of the great trochanter. The patient being flat on his back, (1) a lint j is dropped vertically on to the couch from the anterior superior spine; (2) fron \ the top of the great trochanter a straight line in the long axis of the thigh is drawn t( j meet the first; (3) to complete the triangle, a line is draAvn from the anterio1211 THE THIGH superior spine to the top of the trochanter. This hne is practically Nclaton's. The second line will be found diminished on the damaged or diseased side. Muscular prominences.—The tensor vaginae femoris (ilio-aponem^otic muscle) forms a prominence beginning just outside the sartorius and reaching downwards and somewhat backwards to the strong fascia lata, three to four inches below the great trochanter. Below this point, as far as the outer tuberosity of the tibia, the strong ilio-tibial band can be felt. The sartorius, the chief landmark of the thigh, forming a boundary of Scarpa's triangle, Hunter's canal, and the popliteal space, can be readily brought into view by the patient's raising his limb. In the middle line, the rectus muscle stands out in bold relief, with its tendon of insertion and the patella, when the leg is extended. On either side of this muscle is a furrow.

Between the vastus internus and adductor muscles is a depression indicating Hunter's j canal. At the upper and inner third of the thigh, if the limb be abducted, ' the upper part of the adductor longus comes into strong relief. On the inner side below, above the knee joint, the vertical fibres of the adductor magnus end m a powerful tendon coming down to the adductor tubercle (fig. 768). This replaces here the internal intermuscular septum, and the insertion of the tendon marks the level of the lower epiphysial line of the femur. At the outer and back part ot the ! thigh the vastus externus is separated from the biceps by a groove which indicates the external intermuscular septum. • u i f n I Poupart's ligament.—The abdomen is separated from the thigh by a told,SUBGICAL AND TOPOGRAPHICAL ANATOMY 1212 best marked in flexion—the inguinal furrow. In this, pressure detects the meeting of the aponeurosis of the external oblique and the fascia lata, i.e. Poupart's ligament, extending between the anterior superior spine and the spine of the pubes.

It forms the base of Scarpa's triangle; its inner j attachment blends with the triangular Gimbernat's ligament. Besides the inguinalTHE THIGH 1213 furrow, Mr. Holden describes a second, seen when the thigh is slightly bent, and crossing outwards from the angle between the scrotum and the thigh across the front of the latter, to be gradually lost between the top of tho great trochanter and the anterior superior spine. When present (for it is not constantly well marked) it is a valuable landmark, as it runs right across the capsule of the hip joint, and is thus useful in suspected hip joint disease, as pressure made in this line will tell if the joint be tender. In amputation through the hip joint by anterior and posterior jflaps, if the knife be introduced deeply along this line, the capsule will be exposed or even opened at the first thrust. Scarpa's triangle (fig. 758).—Immediately below Poupart's ligament, a hollow is seen corresponding to this region, the outer and inner boundaries of which are brought into view when the limb is raised, the adductor longus especially when the limb is abducted, and the sartorius where the thigh is flexed and Fig. 758.—Section of the Eight Thigh at the Apex of Scarpa's Triangle.

Lying superficially in the base of the triangle, the lymphatic glands can be detected in a thin person (fig. 790). They he in two groups—(«) One horizontal in a line w^ith Poupart's Hgament, and receiving lymph from the genitals, the lower part of the abdominal wall, and the inner aspect of the buttock; (b) a vertical set lying along the great vessels receiving lymph from the limb. According to Mr. Treves, a few of the superficial genital lymphatics, and all those from the perinaeum, go into the vertical group. Saphenous opening.—The depression corresponding to this is placed just below Gimbernat's hgament, with which its upper extremity blends. Its centre is about an inch and a half below and also external to a line dropped vertically from the pubic spine. This and the other structures concerned in femoral hernia are fully described under this section (vide sujira, page 1166). Line of femoral artery.—A hne drawn from the mid-point between the anterior superior spine and the symphysis pubis to the adductor tubercle will correspondSURGICAL AND TOPOGBAPHICAL ANATOMY 1214 with the course of this vessel. The sartorius usually crosses it, three to four inches below Poupart's hgament. The profunda artery arises an inch and a half to two inches below Poupart's hgament. Therefore the incision for tying the femoral in Scarpa's triangle should be about three inches long, in the line of the artery, and begin about three inches below Poupart's ligament, and run over the apex of the triangle. The vein lies below Poupart's ligament, immediately to the inner side of the artery. From this point the vein gets on to a somewhat deeper Fig. 759.—Superficial Dissection of the Front of the Thigh.

Along this groove lies the sartorius, and beneath it Hunter's canal. The vein has here got somewhat to the outer side. :'| The long saphenous nerve lies also in the canal, but not in the sheath. The above- j mentioned space terminates at about the junction of the middle and lower thirds of j .the thigh, in the opening in the adductor magnus by which the artery enters theTHE THIGH 1215 upper and inner part of the popliteal space. The long saphenous, the largest branch of the anterior crural nerve, having- crossed the femoral vessels from without inwards, accompanies them as far as the opening in the adductor magnus. Here it perforates the aponeurosis, and is prolonged under the sartorius, accompanied by the superficial part of the anastomotic artery, to become cutaneous and run with the long saphena vein at the upper and inner part of the leg.

It is really due to creasing of the skin in flexion and extension. But in early hip disease, in which flexion of the joint is almost unvaryingly present, both the fold and the gluteus maximus disappear with characteristic rapidity. The prominence of the buttock is mainly due to the gluteus maximus, especially behind and below, and in less degree to the other two glutei in front. Under the lower edge of the gluteus maximus the edge of the great sacro-sciatic ligament can be felt on deep pressure.

It has the foUoTvin^ relation to the femur in different positions :—(Ij In extension, the pateUa rises u} over the condyles, and in full extension only the lower third of its articular siu'faC' rests upon that of the condyles ; its upper two-thirds lies upon the bed of fat whicl eoTers the lower and front part of the femur. (2) In extreme flexion, as th( prominent anterior surface of the condyles affords leverage to the quadriceps, th* pateUa needs to project very httle ; thus, only its upper third is in contact witl the femur, its lower two-thirds now resting on the pad of fat between it and th* tibia. (3) In semiflexion the middle third of the patella rests upon the most prominen part of the condyles (Humphry). While the bone now affords the greatest amouE of leverage to the quadriceps, it is also submitted to the greatest amount of straii from this muscle, which is acting almost at a right angle to the long axis of tb pateUa. This position may therefore be called ' the area of danger,' as in a suddei and violent contraction the pateUa may be snapped across by muscular actior aided by the resistance given by the condyles, in the same way as a stick is snappe^ across the knee. Dislocation of the pateUa.—The foUowing anatomical facts account for thi taking place much more frequently outwards :—(1) The inner edge of the patell is more prominent, and thus more exposed to injury ; it is also less weU supporter" as is seen when, the parts being relaxed, the fingers are insinuated beneath eac border. (2) The puU of the extensor upon the pateUa, Ugamenturn pateUse, an tibia is somewhat outwards, as the tibia is directed a Uttle outwards to the femu: to meet the inward direction of this bone ; the femurs being directed inward hen to bring the knee joints nearer the centre of gravity, and, so, counterbalance the: wide separation above at the pelvis. The outward puU of the quadriceps upon xh pateUa is, in aU normal action of the muscle, counteracted by the space taken in th trochlear surface by the external condyle, this being vridei and creeping up highe and having a more prominent and thus protective lip. In \-iolent contractioi however, these counteracting points may be overcome. The condyles and tuberosities.—It should be noted that on the inner side th prominence of the iuternal condyle is weU marked, and that of the tibial tuberosit is less so, whUe on the outer side this condition is reversed. Descending to tl outer tuberosity, the Uio-tibial band of the fascia lata can be traced. The mo] distinct outer tuberosity is a good landmark for opening the joint in amputatic and iacision. It also indicates the lower level of the syno^-ial membrane of tl knee joint. The gap on the inner side between condyle and tuberosity is the pla( for feeUng for a displaced internal fibro-cartUage in ' internal derangement ' of tl knee. On each condyle, posteriorly, in a thin subject can be felt their tubercle which give attachment to the lateral Ugaments. Ov^ing to their being place behind the centre of the bone these Ugaments become tight in extension. On tl upper part of the iuternal condyle the adductor tubercle and the vertical tendon < the adductor magnus can be felt during flexion. This bony point is a guide to tl lower epiphysis of the femur, one of the latest to join, uniting with the shaft aboi the twenty-first year. It is a common site for exostoses in adolescents. The inn' aspect of this condyle faces practicaUy in the same direction as the head of tl femur. Ligamentnm pateUse and tubercle of tibia.—These, in a weU-formed le should, with the centre of the ankle joiot, be aU in the same straight line, a usefi point in the adjustment of fractures (Holden). Behiud the upper half of tl' Ugament is the s}^lo^ial membrane of the knee joint; below, the lower is separat( from the tibia by a deep bursa. In connection "^4th all the posterior surface is fa which sers'es as a useful packing in the different movements of flexion ai' extension. The tubercle of the tibia is on the same level with the head of tl fibula.1223 THE KNEE Prepatellar bursa.—This usually protects the patella and upper part of the ligamentum patellae. It is liable to be enlarged in those who habitually kneel much. Its close connection with the patella and, at the sides, with the joint itself is to be remembered in inflammations of the bursa.

Synovial membrane (fig. 769).—This, the largest in the body, is best seen m cases of effusion. It extends upwards as a large cul-de-sac beneath the patella and quadriceps expansion to a point above the patella, varying from two to two and a half inches, or three fingers' breadth. On the inner side, the upper limit is aboMt1224 SUBGICAL AND TOPOGBAPHICAL ANATOMY three inches above the level of the jomt, but not so high under the vastus externus, Braune has described a deep bursa above the upper limit of the synovial membrane between the quadriceps and the femur.

(2) As the same nerves supply the synovial membrane ] and the muscles which act upon the joint, the flexors being more powerful than the | extensors will help to explain the flexed position.

The sartorius can only be thrown into reli ■ on the inner side of the joint by telling the patient to put it into action. j Bursse.—Five or six may exist at the back of the joint. Thus, on the inner sii: there are three, viz.: (1) Largest and most often enlarged, usually called the poplite , bursa, is the one between the tendon of the semi-membranosus and inner head ; the gastrocnemius—this communicates with the joint as often as once in every fi ;POPLITEAL SPACE 1227 cases (Holden); (2) one between the gastrocnemius and inner condyle ; (3) one between the semi-membranosus and back of the tibia. On the outer side there may be (4) one between the outer head of the gastrocnemius and the condyle; (5) one between the tendons of the popliteus and the outer tuberosity of the joint; (6) one between the above tendons and the external lateral ligament; (7) one between the biceps tendon and the same ligament. While some of the above communicate with the joint much more frequently than the others—e.g. (1) and (4)—such communica- tion is always uncertain, and is the more likely the older the patient. Popliteal vessels.—The artery traverses this space from above downwards, appearing beneath the semi-membranosus, a little to the inner side of the middle line, and then passing down in the centre of the space to the interval between the gastrocnemii.

It is the second of these which usually prevents popliteal aneurism and abscess from making their way into the joint. The popliteal vein, intimately adherent to the artery, hes to the outer side above, but crosses to its inner side below. The walls of this vein are thicker and denser than those of any other vein (Tillaux). The internal popliteal nerve crosses the artery in the same direction as the vein by which it is [separated from the artery. This nerve is the direct continuation of the great sciatic nerve (fig. 775). . . I The superior articular arteries course outwards and inwards immediately iabove the condyles; the inferior ones lie just above the head of the fibula and1228 SUBGICAL AND TOPOGBAPHICAL ANATOMY below the internal tuberosity of the tibia (fig. 775).

The shaft of the fibula is placed on a plane posterior to hat of the tibia, and curves backward in a direction reverse to that of the tibia. Muscular prominences.—The space between the tibia and fibula is mainly ccupied by the fleshy belly of the tibialis anticus ; outside this, and much less )rominent, is the narrower extensor longus digitorum ; outside this, again, are the )eronei longus and brevis. Lower down, in an interval between the tibialis and the xtensor of the toes, the extensor hallucis, here almost entirely tendinous, comes the surface. Behind, the prominence of the calf is mainly formed by the gastro- nemius. On the patient's rising on tiptoe, the tendo Achillis starts into relief from bout the middle of the leg. Of the two heads of the gastrocnemius, the inner is een to be the larger. On either side of the tendon, but more distinctly in the >uter side where it is less overlapped by the gastrocnemius, the soleus comes into lew. Fig. 776.—Section of the Eight Leg in the Upper Third.

The internal, having passed from he arch on the dorsum over the internal malleolus, runs up the inner side of the eg along the inner border of the tibia, to the back of the internal condyle, and then ipwards along the thigh, over the roof of Hunter's canal, to the saphenous opening page 1166 and figs. 710, 790), where it joins the femoral. The internal saphenous lerve joins it below the knee, having been under the sartorius above this point (page 215 and fig. 771). The external saphenous vein passes behind the external malleolus, uns upwards over the middle of the calf, and joins the pophteal by perforating the leep fascia in the lower part of the popliteal space. This vein is also accompanied by L nerve of the same name throughout its course. The popliteal artery bifurcates at the lower border of the pophteus, an inch )elow the tubercle of the tibia.

It gives off the anterior Iperoneal to the front of the limb about an inch above the level of the ankle ioint The nutrient artery of the tibia arises from the posterior tibial near its commencement. It is the largest of all the nutrient arteries. I As a general rule, in amputation one inch below the head of the fibula only bne mam artery—the popliteal—is divided. In amputations two inches below bhe head of the fibula, two main arteries—the anterior and posterior tibials—are iivided. In amputations three inches below the head, three main arteries—the two iibials and the peroneal—are divided. (Holden.) In an amputation through the middle of the leg, the anterior tibial artery would be found cut on the interosseous membrane between the tibialis anticus and the extensor longus hallucis, its nerve lying to its inner side. The posterior tibial yould be between the superficial and deep muscles at the back of the leg lying on !he tibialis posticus, its nerve being to the outer side. The peroneal would be close 0 the fibula in the flexor longus hallucis. THE ANKLE Bony landmarks.—Malleoli.—The following are the differences between them, 'he internal is the more prominent, shorter, and is placed more anteriorly than the iuter, being a little in front of the centre of the joint. The external descends lower y a half to three-quarters of an inch, and thus securely locks in the joint on this :de; it is opposite to the centre of the ankle joint, being placed about half an inch ehind its fellow. The anterior margin of the lower end of the tibia can be traced bove the ankle joint, crossed by the tendons given below. Owing to the external lalleolus descending lower than the inner, in Symes and Pirogoff's amputation le incision should run between the tip of the external malleolus and a point half ji inch below that of the internal one. When a fracture is set, or a dislocation iljusted, the inner edge of the patella, the internal malleolus, and the inner side the great toe are useful landmarks and should be in the same vertical plane, fgard being paid at the same time to the corresponding points in the opposite limb, i llolden.) Tendons.—(A) In front of ankle.—From without inwards are—(1) The tibialis iticus, the largest and most internal. This tendon appears in the lower third of j.e leg, lying just under the deep fascia, close to the tibia ; then, crossing over the 'wer end of this and the ankle joint, passes over the inner side of the tarsus, be attached to the inner and lower part of the internal cuneiform and the jjacent part of the first metatarsal. (2) The extensor proprius hallucis. This Indon, concealed above, appears low down in a line just external to the last, and en, crossing over the termination of the anterior tibial vessels and nerves (to lich its muscular part lies external), it descends along the inner part of the rsum to be attached to the base of the last i^halanx of the great toe.

Very broad at its commencement, it gradually narrows and becomes very thick, j About an inch and a half from the heel, or about the level of the internal malleolus, is its narrowest point. After this it again expands slightly, to be attached to the middle of the back part of the calcaneum.

(C) On the inner side.-The tendon of the tibialis posticus, which has previously brossed from the interspace between the bones of the leg to the mner side, lies behind the inner edge of the tibia above the internal malleolus, being here under 'he flexor longus digitorum, the two tendons here becoming superficial on the inner1236 SURGICAL AND TOPOGRAPHICAL ANATOMY side of the tendo Achillis.

The tendon of the fle:^1287 THE ANKLE longns hallucis cannot be felt. Having parted internally from the fibula, it crosses 1 the lower end of the tibia in a separate furrow, then grooves the back of the astragalus, and passes under the sustentaculum tali on its way to its insertion. The arrangement of the structures at the inner ankle from above downwards, and from within onwards, is as follows (fig. 780):—tibialis posticus, flexor longus digitorum, companion vein, posterior tibial artery, companion vein, posterior tibial nerve, flexor longus hallucis. (D) Tendons at outer ankle.—The tendons of the two peronei, which arise from (the fibula between the extensor longus digitorum and flexor longus hallucis, pass I behind the external malleolus, the brevis being nearer to the bone (fig. 781). They then pass forwards over the outer surface of the calcaneum, separated by the peroneal tubercle when present, and diverge. The brevis, the upper one, passes to the pro- jection at the base of the fifth metatarsal; the longus, lying below the brevis on the calcaneum, winds round the outer border of the foot, grooving the outer border and under surface of the cuboid. Finally, crossing the sole obliquely forwards and inwards, it is attached to the adjacent parts of the internal cuneiform and the back part and under surface of the first metatarsal. While in connection with the cuboid, this tendon is covered in by a sheath from the long plantar ligament, and often contains a sesamoid bone. Annular ligaments and synovial membranes of tendons.—These strap-like ibands of deep fascia, which serve to keep the above tendons in position, are three in number, viz. :— (A) External.—This extends from the tip of the external malleolus to the outer surface of the calcaneum. It keeps the two peronei in place, and surrounds them 3ehind the fibula in one sheath with a single synovial sac, which extends upwards Into the leg for an inch and a half, and sends two processes into the two sheaths j.n which the tendons lie on the calcaneum. Farther on, while in relation with the puboid, the peroneus longus has a second synovial sheath. (B) Internal.—This crosses from the internal malleolus to the inner surface of the calcaneum. Beneath it are the following canals : (1) For the tibialis posticus. This tendon-sheath is lined by a synovial membrane extending from a point an inch and 1 half above the malleolus to the scaphoid. (2) For the flexor longus digitorum. rhe synovial sheath of this tendon is separate from that of the closely contiguous libialis posticus. It extends upwards into the leg about as high as the sheath just |)iven. It reaches down into the sole of the foot; but where the tendon subdivides to Imter the thecse, each of these is lined by a separate synovial sheath. Next comes 13) a wide space for the posterior tibial vessels and nerve ; and lastly, (4) a canal, like the other two, with a separate synovial sheath, for the tendon of the flexor longus hallucis. (C) Anterior annular ligament.—This is a double structure. (1) Upper, above .he level of the ankle joint, and tying the tendons down to the lower third of the eg, it passes transversely between the anterior crest of the tibia and fibula. Here s one sheath only, with a synovial membrane for the tibiahs posticus. (2) Lower, iver the ankle joint. This band is arranged Hke the letter -<, placed thus. It s attached by its root to the calcaneum, and by its bifurcations to the internal nalleolus and the fascia of the sole. This arrangement of the branches of this igament is not constant. In this, the lower annular Hgament, there are usually hree sheaths with separate synovial membranes—the innermost (the strongest in ach) for the tibialis anticus, the next for the extensor proprius hallucis, and the jhird common to the extensor communis and peroneus tertius. Points in tenotomy and guides to the tendons.—The tendo Achillis should be liivided about an inch and a half above its insertion, its narrowest point, which is f.bout on a level with the internal malleolus. The knife should be introduced on the inner side and close to the tendon, so as to avoid the posterior tibial artery (fig. 775.)SURGICAL AND TOPOGBAPHICAL ANATOMY 1238 The tibialis anticus is often cut about an inch above its insertion into the internal cuneiform, a point which is below the level of its synovial sheath. Th( tendon has here the dorsalis pedis on its outer side, but separated by the tendon o: the extensor proprius hallucis. The knife is introduced on this side. The tibialis posticus.—The usual rule for dividing this tendon is to take a spoi two inches above the internal malleolus, and as accurately as possible midway between the anterior and internal borders of the leg. This point will give th( inner margin of the tibia, in close apposition to which the tendon is lying, and is j point at which the tendon is rather farther from the artery than it is below, and ii also above the commencement of its synovial sheath. A sharp-pointed knife ii used first to open the sheath freely, and then a blunt-pointed one to divide tht tendon. The flexor longus digitorum is usually cut at the same time. Owing to the great difficulty in making sure of dividing the tibialis posticu tendon at this spot, and the risk of cutting the posterior tibial artery (fig. 775), i has been advised of late years (Parker) to divide this tendon together with tha of the anticus simultaneously by an incision a little below and anterior to the tr of the internal malleolus. Other guides are the position of the astragalo-scaphoi joint, and, where the deformity is of some standing, the crease which denotes th inversion of the foot. The position of the two tibial arteries should be noted, an; also the lines along which the tendons are converging—the one across the lower en'j of the tibia, the other from behind the tibia and below the sustentaculum tali t; the line of the scaphoid and internal cuneiform. Mr. E. W. Parker has name this operation syndesmotomy, as he rightly considers that the astragalo-scaphoi' ligaments require division at the same time. j Peronei.—The peronei longus and brevis may be divided two inches above th external malleolus, so as to be above the level of their synovial sheath. The knii . should be inserted very close to the bone, so as to pass between the fibula and tt i tendons. Division below the external malleolus is somewhat easier, but as th | opens their synovial sheath or sheaths (vide supra, page 1237), it requires scrupuloi I care as to cleanliness. i THE FOOT Bony landmarks.—The following are of the greatest practical importance owii to the operations on which they bear. (A) Along the inner aspect of the foot are the following:— (1) Internal tuberosity of the calcaneum ; (2) internal malleolus; (3) one fu | inch below the malleolus, the sustentaculum tali; (4) about an inch in front of tl internal malleolus, and a little lower, is the tubercle of the scaphoid, the gt between it and the sustentaculum being filled by the calcaneo-scaphoid ligame] | and the tendon of the tibialis posticus, in which there is often a sesamoid bon( I (5) the internal cuneiform ; (6) the base of the first metatarsal; and (7) the he;; of the same bone, with its sesamoid bones below. (Holden.) j (B) Along the outer aspect are—(1) The outer tuberosity of the calcaneun | (2) the external malleolus ; (3) the peroneal tubercle of the calcaneum (wh( ■ present), one inch below the malleolus, with the long peroneal tendon below | and the short one above ; (4) the projection of the anterior end of the calcaneum, ai \ the calcaneo-cuboid joint, midway between the tip of the external malleolus ai i the base of the fifth metatarsal bone ; (5) the base of the fifth metatarsal bon; (6) the head of this bone. j Levels of joints and lines of operations.—In Syme's amputation through tl j ankle joint, the incision starts (say in the case of the left foot) from the tip of t] j external malleolus, and is then carried, pointing a little backwards towards the hei across the sole to a point half an inch below the internal malleolus. I iTHE FOOT 1239 In PirogofF's amputation the incision begins and ends at the same points, but is carried straight across the sole. In each amputation the bones of the above incision Fig. 782.—Articulations of the Foot, Dorsal Aspect. (Bellamy.) TUBERCLE OF SCAPHOID LINE OF HEY /LINE OF CHOPART -TUBERCLE OF FIFTH METATARSAL are joined by one going straight across the ankle joint, which lies about half an inch above the tip of the internal malleolus. In Chopart's medio-tarsal amputation (fig. 782), which passes between the astragalus and the scaphoid on the inner side, and the calcaneum and the cuboid on the outer, the line of the joints to be opened would be one drawn across Fig. 783.—Vertical Section through the Cuneiform and Cuboid Bones.

The first of these can always be detected, even in a stout or swollen foot, on the inner side ; the joint between the ! internal cuneiform and the first metatarsal bone lies an inch and a half in front j of the scaphoid tubercle. In opening the joint between the second metatarsal and \ the middle cuneiform, its position (the base of the former bone projecting upwards on | Fig. 784.—Superficial Nerves in the Sole of the Foot. (Ellis.) to a level one-third or one-fourth of an inch above the others), and the way in which it is locked in between its fellows and the cuneiform bones, must be remembered. In marking out the flaps for the amputation of the great toes, the large size of the head of the first metatarsal, and the importance of leaving this so as not to diminish its supporting power and the treading width of the foot, and thus of marking out flaps sufiiciently long and large, must be borne in mind. In amputation of the other toes, the line of their metatarso-phalangeal joints lies a full inch above the web.THE FOOT 1241 Bursse and synovial membranes.—The synovial sheath of the extensor proprius hallucis extends from the front of the ankle, over the instep, as far as the metatarsal bone of the great toe. There is generally a bm^sa over the instep, above, or it may be below, the tendon. There is often an irregular bursa between the tendons of the extensor longus digitorum and the projecting end of the astragalus over which the tendons play. There is much friction here. It is well to be aware that this bursa sometimes communicates with the joint of the head of the astragalus (Holden). There is a deep synovial bursa between the tendo Achillis and the calcaneum. Numerous other bursse may appear over any of the bony points in the foot, especially when they are rendered over-prominent by morbid conditions. Fig. 785.—Plantar Arteries (Deep).

Dorsal artery.—The line of this is from the centre of the ankle joint to the upper part of the first interosseous space. On its inner side is the tendon of the extensor proprius hallucis ; on its outer, the innermost tendon of the extensor longus digitorum. It is crossed by the innermost tendon of the extensor brevis. The origin of this muscle should be marked on the outer and fore part of the calcaneum. Cutaneous nerves (figs. 777, 791).—The sites of these, numerous on the dorsum of the foot, are as follows :—The musculo-cutaneous nerve, having perforated the fascia in the lower third of the leg, divides into two chief branches, inner and outer, which supply all the toes save the outer part of the little, and the adjacent side& of the first and second. The anterior tibial becomes cutaneous in the first space, and is distributed to the contiguous sides of the above-mentioned toes. The external saphenous nerve runs with its vein below the malleolus, and supplies all the outer border of the foot and the outer side of the little toe. The interna] saphenous nerve, coursing with its vein in front of the internal malleolus, supplier the inner border of the foot as far as the middle of the instep. Plantar arteries.—The line of the internal would be one drawn from thf bifurcation of the posterior tibial, or about midway between the tip of the internal malleolus and the inner border of the heel, to the middle of the plantar surface o; the great toe. The course of the external plantar runs in a line drawn from th( bifurcation, first obliquely across the foot to a point a little internal to the innei side of the base of the fifth metatarsal, and thence obliquely across the foot till i' reaches the first space and joins with a communicating branch from the dorsa artery. It thus crosses the foot twice. In the first part it is more superficial, ii the second very deep ; it here forms the plantar arch, and is only separated fron the bases of the metatarsals by the interossei.

Two pillars.—Professor Humphry lays stress on the important differences between these two : (1) Posterior pillar : This consists of the calcaneum and hinder part of the1244 SURGICAL AND TOPOGBAPHICAL ANATOMY astragalus, viz. only two bones in order to secure solidity, and to enable the calf- muscles to act directly upon the heel, without any of that loss of power which would be brought about by many moving joint-surfaces. (2) Anterior pillar : Here there are many bones and joints to provide {a) elastic springiness, and (b) width. This anterior pillar may again be divided into two : (a) An inner pillar, very elastic, consisting of the astragalus, scaphoid, three cuneiforms, and three inner metatarsals, (b) An outer, formed by the cuboids and two outer metatarsals. This is stronger and less elastic, and tends to buttress up the inner pillar. Key- stone : This is represented by the summit of the trochlear surface of the astragalus. Fig. 789.—Fourth Layer of the Muscles of the Sole. Peroneus longus- Plantar interossei It differs from the keystones in ordinary arches in the following important j particulars (Humphry): (a) in not being wedge-shaped; (b) in not being so | placed as to support and receive support from the two halves of the arch : in front | the astragalus does fulfil this condition by fitting into the scaphoid ; behind, it j overlaps the calcaneum without at all supporting it; (c) this arch and the support | of its keystone largely depend on ligaments and tendons; (d) it is a mobile keystone: to give it chances of shifting its pressure, and so obtaining rest, its equilibrium is j not always maintained in one position. | (B) Transverse arch (fig. 783).—This is best marked about the centre of the foot, | j j \ABCHES OF THE FOOT 1245 Fig. 790.—The Superficial Veins and Lymphatics of the Lower Limb. \|\\\\ • Superficial epigastric vein Lymphatics from penis and scrotum Common femoral vein Superficial femoral lymphatic glands Superficial external pudic vein Internalfemoral cutaneous vein Long saphenous vein SujH'rficial lym^Jhatics from lateral wall of ahdomen Superficial lymphatics from lower and anterior walls of ahdomen Superficial inguinal lymphatic glands Superficial circumflex iliac vein External femoral cutaneous veinSURGICAL AND TOPOGRAPHICAL ANATOMY 1246 at the instep, along the tarso-metatarsal joints. This, as well as the longitudinal arch, yields in walking, and so gives elasticity and spring. Uses of the arches.—(1) They give combined elasticity and strength to the tread. Thus they give firmness, free quickness, and dignity, both in standing and walking, instead of what we see in their absence, viz. the lameness of an artificial limb, and the shuffling or hobbling which goes with tight boots, deformed toes, flat-foot, bunions, corns, etc. ; (2) they protect the plantar vessels, nerves, and muscles ; (3) they add to man's height; (4) they make his gait a perfect combina- tion of plantigrade and digitigrade, as is seen in man's walking, when he uses first the heel, then all the foot, and then the toes.

(1) Plantar fascia.—This is {a) a binding tie between the pillars of the longitudinal arch ; {h) it protects the structures beneath ; (c) it is a self-regulating ligament and protection. Thus, having a quantity of muscular tissue attached to its upper and back part, it constantly responds by the contraction of this, to the amount of any pressure made upon the foot. (2) Calcaneo- scaphoid ligament.—This is a thick plate of fibrous tissue, partly elastic, attached to the under surface of the calcaneum, sustentaculum tali, and scaphoid. It is thickest at its inner side, where it blends with the anterior part of the deltoid ligament, and where the tibialis posticus passes into the sole, giving much support to the head of the astragalus, and assisting the power and spring of this ligament {vide infra).ABCHES OF THE FOOT 1247 (3) Calcaneo-cuboid ligaments, {a) Long; (b) short.—These ligaments are the main support of the outer, firm, and less elastic part of the longitudinal arch. (4) Tibialis posticus.—The reason of this muscle having so many insertions below is to brace together the tarsal bones, and to prevent their separation when, in treading, the elastic anterior pillar tends to widen out. Of these numerous offsets, that to the scaphoid is the most important. Thus it strengthens the calcaneo- scaphoid ligament by blending with it, and thus supports the arch at a trying time. By coming into action when the heel is raised (fig. 788), this tendon helps the calcaneo-scaphoid ligament to support the head of the astragalus, and to maintain the arch of the foot when the weight of the body is thrown forward on to the instep. In other words, the tibialis posticus comes into play just when the heaviest of its duties is devolving upon this ligament, viz. when the heel is being raised, I and the body-weight is being thrown over the instep on to the opposite foot. (5) Peroneus longus.—This raises the outer pillar, and steadies the outer side of the arch. Further, by its strong process attached to the first metatarsal bone (fig. 789), it keeps the great toe strapped down firmly against the ground; thus, keeping down the anterior pillar of the longitudinal arch, it aids the firmness of the tread (Humphry). (6) Tibialis anticus.—This braces up the keystone of the arch. Thus, by keeping up the internal cuneiform, it maintains the scaphoid, and so indirectly the astragalus, in situ. Fig. 790 is introduced here to remind the student of the arrangement of the j superficial lymphatics of the lower extremity. I Fig. 791 shows the distribution of the superficial nerves on both aspects of the limb. THE REGIONS OF THE ABDOMEN By WILLIAM ANDEESON, F.R.C.S. As the plan of segmenting the ventral surface of the abdomen by means of two i horizontal, and two vertical or nearly vertical lines, has survived the test of time, it might be assumed that it is a resource of some practical value to the physician and surgeon. It is, however, a curious fact that, although the nine historical regions of the abdomen have been universally accepted in British and continental schools for at least forty years, and may be traced back to a very much more remote period, no attempt has ever been made to secure uniformity m the plan of their dehmitation, but almost every anatomical writer has elected to follow a i system of his own, and, consequently, there are at the present moment at least fourteen different schemes in our recognised text-books. There is httle doubt that it were better to abandon altogether the pretence of a regional subdivision than to employ terms which have no scientific meaning, but it may be hoped that some accord will soon be arrived at. ^ xl, ? • / ? 1 On analysing the various systems it will be seen that the ^^^^^.^r hoMcd liMe may be drawn either (1) between the ninth costal cartilages of the two sides-the precise part of the cartilage, which forms about two mches of the border of the thorax, being usually left undefined (Gray, Todd, Turner Holden, Heath, Shield, Tillaux); (2) between the tenth costal cartilages (Macahster, Aitken, Joessel); between the lowest points of the thoramc border, usually the eleventh costal cartilage (Quain, Cunningham, Henle); or (3 on a level with the tips of the twelfth ribs (Hyrtl, Rudinger). The loicer honzontal hue may be drawn1218 SURGICAL AND TOPOGBAPHIGAL ANATOMY (1) either at the level of the highest point of the iliac crest (Quain, Gray, Turner, | Cunningham, Henle, Bellamy, and others); or (2) between the anterior superior iliac spines (Todd, Holden, Heath, Macalister, Shield, Tillaux, Hyrtl, Eiidinger, and 1 Joessel). The longihcdinal Ime on each side may run upwards (1) from the middle j of Poupart's ligament (Quain, Gray, Turner, Heath, Tillaux) ; (2) from the inner part of the ligament (Todd, Eiidinger) ; (3) from the pubic spine (Aitken, Mac- I alister); or (4) from the anterior superior iliac spine (Hyrtl) ; (5) from the ilio- ' pectineal eminence (Joessel). It may be directed perpendicularly upwards without reference to any terminal point (Quain, Cunningham, Tillaux); or it may be drawn | to a fixed, but often rather indefinite, locality above, as the seventh costal cartilage i (Heath, Bellamy) ; the bony extremity of the sixth or seventh rib (Eiidinger); ' ' the extremity of the seventh or eighth rib ' (Todd); ' the eighth costal cartilage,' i without reference to the particular part of the structure (Gray, Holden, Macalister, i Shield); to ' the ninth or tenth rib ' (Henle); to the sterno-clavicular joint (Hyrtl); ' to the acromio-clavicular joint (Aitken, etc.); or may stop short at the superior ' horizontal line, the upper region being subdivided by the costal border (Joessel). i Setting aside the impracticability of some of these indications^ it is obvious that the variations between the different systems are really important. For example,: in the scheme most in vogue, that adopted in ' Quain's Anatomy,' the umbilicus i lies at the lowest limit of the umbilical region, or even outside it altogether—never in the middle as the diagrams depict—and the height of the area seldom exceeds ; two inches, and is often less ; in * Gray's Anatomy' the elevation of the upper horizontal line to the ninth costal cartilage adds an inch or two above ; and in i Macalister and Tillaux the depression of the lower horizontal line to the iliaci^ spines lends an increase of about three inches in the other direction, and the umbilicus now falls in the centre of the area from which it takes its name. Again, in most of the systems the outline of the region is rectangular, or nearly so; but in Aitken it widens above towards the points of the shoulders, and in j Hyrtl it widens below towards the anterior inferior iliac spines. Equally serious ' discrepancies exist in all of the other regions. j Whatever system be adopted, it is necessary that the boundary ' lines ' should 1 be converted into planes carried through the whole depth of the abdomen, and I defined on the dorsal as well as on the ventral surface of the trunk, and that the structures cut through by these planes should be noted, as well as those comprised \ within the regions which they separate. It should, of course, be recognised that i the relations so defined can only be approximate, on account of the wide range of - physiological variation in the position of the abdominal contents ; but this being * understood, a regional type would be of material service in medical education. Could we cast off tradition without loss, it would, perhaps, be more simple, and more useful, to divide the cavity into superior and inferior segments by a | single horizontal plane at the level of the umbilicus (or of the highest point of \ the iliac crest), and then to subdivide each segment into three by two vertical lines ; drawn as described, from the middle of Poupart's ligament. The regions might ; then be called right, left, and middle superior, and right, left, and middle inferior; i but such a change would have the great disadvantage of making the older references unintelligible. If we retain the subdivision into nine segments, it remains only to consider the method of delimitation. Firstly, for the higher plane, the most suitable level , appears to be that adopted in ' Quain's Anatomy,' the lowest point of the cartila- I ginous border of the thorax (usually the eleventh costal cartilage). This plane passes through the second lumbar vertebra posteriorly, and lies about two inches above the umbilicus in front. It cuts through the stomach, the transverse colon, the ascending and descending colon, the duodenum (lower curvature) and small intestine, and the kidneys. For the lower horizontal _2:)Za72e we have the choice ofTHE BEGIONS OF THE ABDOMEN 1219 two levels—that of the highest point of the iliac crest, corresponding to the lower part of the third lumbar vertebra, and that of the anterior superior iliac spine, which lies about an inch below the level of the sacral promontory.

Fundus uteri and append- The objection to the plane of the highest point of the iliac crest is that it frequently excludes the mnbihcus from the umbihcal region, and reduces the middle zone (lumbar and umbilical regions) to a very narrow segment of the abdomen. On the other hand, the lower plane, that of the anterior ihac spmes, passes into the true pelvis and leaves a large portion of the iliac fossae in the lumbar regions, and it confines the lower lateral regions within a very restricted area. On the whole, however, it seems the more convenient, as it leaves the umbilicus nearly m the 4 Jj1250 SURGICAL AND TOPOGRAPHICAL ANATOMY middle of tlie umbilical region, and if the longitudinal plane corresponding to the outer border of the rectus be adopted, the inguinal canal will be left intact in the 'inguinal' region. This lower plane, if carried horizontally backwards from the symphysis into the pelvis, cuts the small intestine, the caecum or lower part of the ascending colon, the sigmoid flexure, the upper end of the rectum, the fundus uteri, the ovaries and Fallopian tubes, and the distended bladder. For the longitudinal plane on each side, that corresponding to the vertical line of Quain, running upwards parallel to the mesial line from the middle of Poupart's ligament, is already familiar to the greater number of observers; but it has the disadvantage of making the mesial regions very large in proportion to the lateral regions, the upper lateral regions being still further reduced in women owing to the narrowness of the chest when compared with the width of the pelvis. As an alternative, the outer border of the rectus would be preferable, as it is easily localised by the lateral infracostal furrow above, and by the pubic spine below ; and while reducing the width of the middle zone without interfering materially with existing indications of contents, it leaves an inguinal region that includes the whole of the inguinal canal. Each plane cuts the kidney, transverse colon, and small intestine; the right plane cuts also the gall bladder, and sometimes the caBCum ; the left cuts the sigmoid flexure, the stomach (great cul-de-sac), the pan- creas, and the spleen. The table on the preceding page will show the contents of the regions adjusted according to this scheme. Note. Ligamentum nuchce :—This structure has been referred to on page 206. As seen in the horse, elephant, ox, and other quadrupeds, it is a great and important elastic ligament. In man it is but a slender band of elastic and white fibres extending from the spine of the seventh cervical vertebra, where it is continuous with the supraspinous ligament, to the external occipital protuberance and occipital crest. The Trapezii muscles take origin from it. A thin tendinous layer connects its deep surface with the tips of the spinous processes, of the cervical vertebrae, thus forming a septum between the muscles of the neck.INDEX [The princijpal authority for the derivations of the anatomical terms given in this Index is HyrtVs ' Onomatologia Anatomica,' Vienna, 1880.] ABD Abdomen [from abdo = I hide; or, more prob- ably from adeps = fat: as if for adijoo- men = isit belly of swine], the, 994 contents seen on opening the, 995 lymphatics of, parietal, 700 visceral, 702 lymph glands of, parietal, 700 visceral, 702 regions of, 1247 sm-gical anatomy of, 1141 veins of, 669 Abdominal aorta, 584; branches, parietal 586, visceral 588; variations, 585 muscles, 425-436 nerves of vagus, 819 parietes, structure of, 425 ; topography of vessels and nerves in, 1144 portion of ureter, 1052 ring, external, 430, 1142, 1159 effect of position on, 1159 internal, 436, 1144, 1161 viscera, 989 ; regionally arranged, 1249 lymphatics of, 702 Abducent [a6 = from ; dnco^I lead], or sixth cranial, nerve, 805 Abduction, 189 Abductor hallucis [halhix = gxedi,t toe] muscle, 401; variations, 401 minimi digiti muscle of hand, 363 of foot, 402 ; variations, 403 ossis metatarsi qiiinti muscle, 487 pollicis [iMlex = i\\\xmb'\ muscle, 358; variations, 360 Abnormal muscles, 487-490 Accelerator urin£e [from its action in hastening the expulsion of the urine] or bulbo- cavernosus muscle, 1072 Accessorius \accedere = io be added to] ad ilio- costalem (vel sacro-lumbalem), 441 Accessory artery, pudic, 605 band of atlanto-axoidean capsules, 196 cartilages of nose (quadrate), 928 lachrymal glands, 903 nerve, obturator, 850 spinal, 819 nucleus of auditory nerve, 812 of trigeminal nerve, 794 sensory, of trigeminal nerve, 794 palatine canals, 65 portion of spinal accessory nerve, 820 process of lumbar vertebra, 14 ALV Accessory suprarenal bodies, 1050 vein, hemiazygos, 644 Acervulus [dim. of acervits ^ a heap] cerebri, or brain sand, 747 Acetabulum [ = a vessel for holding vinegar], the, 148, 153 Acromial artery of acromio-thoracic, 555 of posterior circumflex, 558 of suprascapular, 546 end of clavicle, 119 Acromio-clavicular articulation, 230 Acromio-thoracic artery, 555 vein, 682 Acromion l&Kpou = a summit ; &iuos = shoulder] process, 122 ; ossification of, 124 Adduction [ad = to ; duco = l lead], 189 Adductor brevis muscle, 381 ; variations, 382 hallucis {hallux = gYQoX toe] muscle, 406; variations, 407 longus muscle, 379 ; variations, 379 magnus muscle, 382 ; variations, 383 pollicis [pollex = thumb] muscle, 362 ; variations, 362 obliquus muscle, 361 tubercle of femur, 157 Adipose foss® of breast, 1108 Age, variations of breast according to, 1109 variations in form of uterus according to, 1084 Ala [ = a wing] cinerea [ = ash-coloured], 758 Alae of cerebellum, 754 of nose, 926 of sacrum, 17 of sphenoid, greater and lesser, 33 of thyroid cartilage, 939 vespertilionis, 1085 of vomer, 58 Alar [aZa. = awing] ligaments of knee, 273 spine, 35, 83 Alar [alaris is a contraction of axillaris'] thoracic artery, 555 vein, 682 Alcock's canal, 858, 1099 Alimentary tube, the simple, 1029 Ali-sphenoid bones, 33 ; at birth, 101 Allantois [aWas, gen. aWauros^^a, sausage], the, 1093 Alveolar artery, 526 nerves, 804 point of skull, 88 ridge of maxilla, 62 The names of Abnormal Muscles are printed in italics. 4 L 2INDEX 1252 ALV Alveolus [ = a small hollow vessel] of mandible ( = inferior maxilla), 69 of maxilla ( = superior maxilla), 62 Amphiarthrosis [a/x4)t = both ; apdpoy = Q: joint], 187 Ampulla [ = a wine-jug] of Fallopian tube, 1089 of galactophorous duct, 1109 of semicircular canals, 44, 917 of Vater, 1021 Amputation of great toe, incisions for, 1240 Hey's, incisions for, 1240 of leg, arteries divided in, 1233 Lisfranc's, incisions for, 1240 Syme's, incisions for, 1238 Amygdala [a^auySaA??

THE ORGANS OF CIRCULATION 964 It may be mapped out on the chest wall in the following manner : a line drai across the sternmn about the level of the third costal cartilages, half an inch the right and one inch to the left, will indicate the position of its base, from whi the great vessels arise. The apex, as before observed, strikes the chest wall between the fifth and sij rib cartilages on the left side, at a spot about a couple of inches below the nipp and one inch to its sternal side. The lower border is formed by the right ventricle and rests on the cent tendon of the diaphragm. It is defined by a line curving downwards, commencij; Fig. 546.

The lateral borders may be completed by drawing curved lines upwards frc j the points last named to the ends of the basal line. The right border consiKj entirely of the right auricle, and the left of the left ventricle. ' Size and weight.â€”In the adult the heart measures about five inches from ba to apex, three and a half inches across where it is broadest, and two and a half its thickest portion. In the male its weight averages about eleven ounces, and the female about nine ounces. It increases both in size and weight up to advanc life, the increase being most marked up to the age of twenty-nine years.

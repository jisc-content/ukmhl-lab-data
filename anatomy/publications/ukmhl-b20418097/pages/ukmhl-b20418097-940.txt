OBGANS OF SPECIAL SENSE 902 The Eyelids The cutaneous and conjunctival surfaces of the hds have akeady been examined, and the position of the tarsus has been indicated. We have now to ascertain the nature and relations of the tarsus, and describe the other tissues entering into the formation of the eyelids. The skin here is thin, bearing fine hairs, and having small sebaceous and numerous small sweat glands. Immediately beneath it is a loose subcutaneous tissue, destitute of fat, separating the skin from the palpebral part of the orbicularis Fig. 491.â€”Vertical Transverse Section through the Upper Eyelid. (After Waldeyer and Fiichs.) Cutaneous surface just above superior palpe- bral fold Orbicularis fibres, cut across SWEAT GLAND FINE HAIR WITH SEBACEOUS GLAND AT ITS BASE Orbicularis fibres, cut across MODIFIED SWEAT GLAND OF MOLL CONJUNCTIVA NEAR FORNIX i Anterior layer of inser- tion of levator pal- pebrae superioris Superior palpebral muscle of Miiller i Pibres from levator passing through orbicularis to skin Superior vascular arch, cut across i WALDEYER'S GLANDS Conjunctival papillae over attached border of tarsus Musculus eiliaris Biolani Posterior edge of lid- margin OPENING OF DUCT OF MEIBOMIAN GLAND muscle. The Hd-fibres of this muscle arise from the inner palpebral ligament, and course over the whole upper and lower eyelids in a succession of arches, so as to meet again beyond the outer canthus ; there they in part join one another, in part are inserted into the outer palpebral ligament. The muscular fibres are arranged in loose bundles, with spaces between them occupied by connective tissue ; in the upper hd these connective tissue fibres may be traced upwards and backwards into the fibrous expansion of the tendon of the levator palpebrse superioris. One strong bundle of orbicularis fibres, called the musculus eiliaris Riolani, is found near the edge of the lid, in front of, and behind, the efferent ducts of the Meibomian glands.

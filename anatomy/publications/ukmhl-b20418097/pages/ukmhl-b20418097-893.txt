BBANCHES OF THE SACBAL PLEXUS 855 having supplied both these muscles, ends in a branch which pierces the outer I fibres of the gluteus minimus, and supplies the tensor fasciae femoris. 2. The inferior gluteal nerve arises from the posterior aspect of the plexus, and ! contains fibres derived from the second and third sacral nerves. It escapes through the great sacro-sciatic foramen, below the pyriformis, and in this situation is often 'adherent to the small sciatic nerve. It divides into several stout twigs, which enter the deep surface of the gluteus maximus. Fig. 465.—Diagram of the Lumbar and Sacral Plexuses. (Modified from Paterson.)

The nerve to the pyriformis is given off either from the second or from the third sacral nerve before they join the plexus. 4. The visceral branches arise from the third and fourth sacral nerves. They will be described in connection with the sympathetic. 5. The nerve to the quadratus femoris is a branch of the third sacral nerve. It passes through the great sacro-sciatic foramen below the pyriformis, and is usually

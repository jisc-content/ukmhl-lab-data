mi SPINAL 3. THE SPINAL VEINS The spinal veins, which form plexuses around and within the spinal canal from the cranium to the sacrum, may be divided into the extra- and intraspinal veins. The extraspinal form a plexus both in front of the bodies of the vertebrae (the anterior spinal plexus), and in the spinal groove between the transverse and spinous processes—the dorsal plexus, or dorsal spinal plexus as it is often called. The intraspinal veins, or those within the spinal canal, may be divided into the meningeal and the medullary. The meningeal form an anterior and posterior spinal plexus between the dura mater and the walls of the spinal canal, and are generally known as the meningo-rachidean veins. They receive the veins from the bodies of Fig. 390.—The Spinal Veins. Anterior sjnnal plexus the vertebrae. The medullary set are situated within the dura mater ; they return the blood from the spinal cord, and are known as the medulli-spinal veins. I 1. The extraspinal veins.—{a) The veins of the anterior spinal plexus ramify I in front of the bodies of the vertebrae. They are of small size and most distinct I in the cervical region (fig. 390). They open into the neighbouring veins. (5) The veins of the posterior spinal or dorsal spinal plexus are situated around j the spinous processes, the laminae, and the articular and transverse processes of the I vertebrae, the larger veins of the plexus running horizontally forwards along the interspinous ligaments. The plexus is formed chiefly by the union of tributaries proceeding from the integuments of the back and the spinal muscles. Communi- cations take place between the veins of each vertebral segment by vertical branches running upwards and downwards to the plexus above and below respectively near

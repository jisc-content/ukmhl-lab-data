THE SKELETON 174 The inferior surface is narrow and rough ; it ends posteriorly in two tubercles : the inner is the larger and broader, the outer is narrower but prominent. The inner tubercle affords origin to the abductor haUiccis, the flexor brevis digitorum, and the abductor minimi digiti; the last muscle also arises from the inner tubercle, and the ridge of bone connecting the tubercles. The outer tubercle affords Fig. 172.—The Left Calcaneum. (Dorsal view.) INNER TUBERCLE INTEROSSEOUS GROOVE FACET FOR ASTRAGALUS ON THE- SUSTENTACULUM TALI FOR ASTRAGALUS ■PERONEAL TUBERCLE attachment to the abductor ossis metatarsi quinti. The rough surface in front of the tubercles gives attachment to the long plantar ligament (calcaneo-cuboid) and the outer head of the flexor accessorius. Near its anterior end this surface forms a rounded eminence, the anterior tubercle, from Avhich (and the shallow groove in front) the short plantar (calcaneo-cuboid) ligament arises. The external surface is rough and slightly convex. Near the middle of this. Fig. 173.—The Calcaneum at the Fifteenth Yeae, showing the Epiphysis. APPEARS AT THE TENTH, AND UNITES AT THE SIXTEENTH YEAR surface there is a small tubercle for the middle fasciculus of the external lateral ligament of the ankle joint. Anteriorly, we notice the two shallow peroneal grooves,, separated by a tubercle, which is sometimes very prominent. The upper groove is for the tendon of the i)eroneus brevis, and the lower lodges the tendon of tha Ijeroneus longus.

THE LYMPHATICS 690 discharge, partly into the submaxillary glands, and partly into the superficial cervical chain. (4) The buccal lymphatic glands are situated on the surface of the buccinator. Some of the facial lymphatics pass through these on their Avay to the submaxillary glands. (5) The submaxillary lymphatic glands are situated in the digastric triangle, beneath the body of the lower jaw. They vary from eight to twelve in number.

Their efferent vessels terminate partly in the deep, and partly in the superficial cervical lymphatic glands. Two or three glands situated in the middle line between the anterior bellies of the digastric muscles are sometimes distinguished as the suprahyoid lymphatic glands.

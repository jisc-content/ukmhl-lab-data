THE SKELETON 94 THE TEETH An adult individual with perfect dentition possesses thirty-two teeth, equally distributed to the maxiha and mandible. The four central teeth in each dental arch are termed incisors ; the tooth next these on each side is the canine ; behind these are two pre-molars or bicuspids ; and lastly, three molars. This relation of teeth is expressed by means of a formula :— Each tooth has a portion coated with enamel exposed above the gum—named the crown; and a portion coated with cementum embedded in bone—this is the root. The hne of union of the crown and root is termed the neck. Fig. 97.—The Teeth of an Adult. INCISORS CANINE BICUSPIDS MOLARS WISDOM TOOTH The surface of the tooth directed towards the lips and cheek is called labial, and that towards the tongue lingual. It is also necessary to apply definite terms to the opposed surfaces of teeth, hence the surface directed towards the middle line of the mouth if the alveolar arch were straightened out is median, and the opposite side is distal. Each tooth has distinguishing features. The incisors.—The central upper incisors are very much larger than the lateral, the crown is somewhat oblong in outline, its length exceeding the breadth. The median is longer than the distal border. The labial surface is convex, the lingual concave, and terminates near the gum in a low eminence, the basal ridge or cingulum. In recently erupted teeth, the cutting edge is elevated into three small cusps ; these soon Avear down and leave a straight edge. The root is long, single, and flattened laterally. The upper lateral incisors are much smaller than the centrals, which they resemble in the general contour of the crown. The distal angle of the crown is more rounded than in the central incisors, and the cingulum is more pronounced. The root is single. The lower central incisors are much narrower than those of the upper set, and less than half their width in the cutting edges, and the crown becomes contracted

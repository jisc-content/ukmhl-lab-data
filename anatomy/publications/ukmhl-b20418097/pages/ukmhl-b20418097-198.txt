THE SKELETON 160 articulated, the inferior surfaces of the condyles are nearly on the same plane, and almost parallel to come into contact with the articular surfaces on the head of the tibia. Posteriorly the condyles are separated by a deep pit or notch ; anteriorly they are united by an articular surface, over which the patella glides. The inner surface of the internal condyle has, near its posterior border, a rough surface for the internal lateral ligament of the knee joint ; above this is the adductor tubercle. The surface of this condyle, which bounds the inter condyloid notch, affords attachment^ Fig. 162.â€”The Femur at Birth. APPEARS EARLY IN THE NINTH MONTH OF INTRA-UTERINE LIFE near the anterior border, to the posterior crucial ligament. The surface of the external condyle which bounds the notch gives attachment, at its posterior part, to the anterior crucial hgament. The outer surface of the external condyle presents near the lower and posterior margin a deep groove, which receives the tendon of the popliteus muscle when the leg is flexed. The groove is sur- mounted by a tubercle for the external lateral ligament of the knee. The patellar facet is trochlear in shape; its outer portion is more extensive than the inner, corresponding to the disposition of the articular facets on the posterior surface of the patella.

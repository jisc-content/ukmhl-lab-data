246 THE ARTICULATIONS The capsule of the wrist joint has been usually described as four separate ligj ments, and it will be convenient for the sake of a complete description to folio- this method ; but it must be understood that these four portions are continuoi around the joint, extending from styloid process to styloid process on both r aspects. The four portions are :â€” Anterior radio-carpal. Internal lateral. Posterior radio-carpal. External lateral. The anterior radio-carpal (fig. 231) is a thick strong ligament, attache superiorly to the radius immediately above the margin of the terminal articule facet, to the curved ridge at the root of the styloid process of the radius, and to th anterior margin of the triangular cartilage, blending with some fibres of the capsu; of the inferior radio-ulnar joint. It passes downwards and inwards to be attache to both rows of carpal bones, especially the second, and to the anterior intercarps ligament. The strongest and most obhque fibres arise from the root of the styloi process of the radius, and pass obliquely over the scaphoid, with which only a fe^ fibres are connected, to be inserted into the semilunar, magnum, and cuneiform bone^ Another set, less oblique, pass from the margin of the facet for the semilunar to b attached to the adjacent parts of the magnum, unciform, and the cuneiform bone^ Between the two sets of fibres, small vessels pass into the joint. The posterior radio-carpal ligament (fig. 232) is attached superiorly to th dorsal edge of the lower end of the radius, the back of the styloid process, and th! posterior margin of the fibro-cartilage. It passes downwards and inwards to b connected with the first row of the carpal bones, chiefly with the semilunar an* cuneiform, and the posterior intercarpal ligament. This ligament is thin an(j membranous, and is strengthened by (i) strong fibres passing from the back of thi fibro-cartilage, where they are blended with the posterior inferior radio-ulna

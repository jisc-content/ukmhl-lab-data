61 THE MAXILLA rounded, forming jjart of the circumference of the orbital orifice of the lachrymal duct. The orbital surface is traversed by the infraorbital groove, which, commen- cing at the posterior border, deepens as it passes forwards and enters the infra- orbital canal. This groove receives the second division of the fifth nerve and the infraorbital artery. The infraorbital canal runs under the margin of the orbit Fig. 71.—The Left Maxilla. (Outer view.)

It transmits the infraorbital artery and nerve. At the termination of the groove a smaller canal tunnels the anterior wall of the antrum, and conveys the anterior dental nerves and vessels to the upper incisor, canine, and bicuspid teeth. External to the commencement of the lachrymal duct there is a shallow depression from which the inferior oblique takes origin. The internal or nasal surface forms the outer w^all of the nasal fossa, and is Fig. 72.—The Left Maxilla. (Inner view.)

The posterior half of this surface is deficient, and leads by a large irregular aperture into the antrum ; below and behind this opening the bone is rough for articulation with the vertical ]Dlate of the palate bone. The extreme posterior border receives the tuberosity of the palate bone; the groove in front of it forms part of the posterior palatine canal. Anterior to this surface the bone becomes suddenly smooth ; between the smooth

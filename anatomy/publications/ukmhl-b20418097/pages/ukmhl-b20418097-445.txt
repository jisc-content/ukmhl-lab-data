409 INTEROSSEI hi fOBI mm im'i lever. Action.—The common action of all the interossei is (1) to flex the first lohalanges of the four outer toes ; (2) to extend the second and third phalanges. In these two movements they are assisted by the lumbricales. In walking, this movement is of great importance as it keeps the toes straight when the weight of the body rests upon the front part of the foot. When these movements are paralysed, the action of the long and short flexor of the toes is to curl them up, and the ends of the toes will be subjected to considerable pressure, which may set up inflammation to the beds of the nails. Fig. 296.—Fourth Layer of the Muscles of the Sole. Peroneus longus mi i!iti,iii iilie ; Si ■ .'^00- Plantar interossei Dorsal interossei The special action of the plantar interossei is to adduct the first phalanges of phe three outer toes ; and of the dorsal interossei to abduct the second, third, and fourth toes from the middle line of the second toe. As the second toe can be ibducted from its own middle line in two directions, it of course requires two ibductors. Relations.—On the plantar surface both sets of interossei are in contact with the muscles of the third layer, and with the external plantar vessels and nerve ; on the iorsal surface the dorsal interossei are covered by the tendons of the extensor ^ongus and brevis digitorum. The dorsalis pedis and other perforating arteries pass through the back of the interosseous spaces between the double origins of the iorsal interossei.

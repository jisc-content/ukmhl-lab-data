The 3ad is thus tilted to one side, and it is even possible that the weight of the skull ay be borne almost entirely on one joint, the articular surfaces of the other being irown out of contact. Or the movement may be obliquely lateral, when the lower side of the head ill be a trifle in advance of the elevated side.

There is no true rotation round a vertical ixis possible between the occiput and atlas. These lateral movements are checked by the lateral odontoid ligaments and ihe outer part of the capsules ; extension is checked by the anterior oceipito-atlantal md anterior oblique ligaments, and flexion by the posterior part of the capsule md cervico-basilar hgaments. o 2

298 THE MUSCLES from both sides of several fibrous septa, as well as from the intermediate sm^faces of the bone to which the septa are attached. The insertion may also be of the same character. A good example of this, which is called the multipemiiform arrange- ment, is the deltoid, a very powerful muscle with a short range of movement. In some few cases the tendon is intercalated between two fleshy masses. Such muscles are called biventral. The central tendon may represent a bony structure found in lower Vertebrata, and the two bellies might sometimes fairly be regardjed as distinct muscles, e.g. those of the digastric muscle. In some cases the central tendon may be of some service in preventing the pressure upon subjacent tissues Fig. 259.—Diageam showing Penniform Muscle, the Peroneus Longus ; and bipenniform, the tibialis posticus. which would occur if the muscle were at this point fleshy and free to thicken as i1 contracted. For example, it has been suggested that the central tendon of the omo-hyoid prevents that muscle from compressing the great vessels of the neck &i it crosses them beneath the sterno-mastoid. In one muscle, the rectus abdominis several of these tendinous intersections are found. 5. Nerve-supply.^—This is of much importance, not only from a medical anc surgical point of view, when the paralysis or spasmodic contraction of individua muscles has to be accounted for, but also because of the light which it throwi upon the action of muscles, and the assistance which it sometimes gives us ii grouping them.

THE THOBAX 1135 be at the junction of tlie manubrium and body of the sternum. The nipple, in [he male, lies between the fourth and fifth, nearly an inch outside their cartilages, he lower border of the great pectoral corresponds to the fifth rib. The seventh, le longest of the ribs, is the last to articulate with the sternum. When the arm 5 raised, the first three digitations seen of the serratus magnus correspond to the ixth, seventh, and eighth ribs. The ninth is the most oblique.

Owing to the obliquity of the ■ibs, their sternal ends are on a much lower level than their vertebral extremities. Thus the first rib in front corresponds to the fourth rib behind, the second to the iiixth, the third to the seventh, the fourth to the eighth, the fifth to the ninth, the sixth to the tenth, and the seventh to the eleventh.

INFBA COSTALES—DIAPHBA GM 423 I Nerve-supply.—The intercostal nerves, which enter their outer surface. Action.—To depress the ribs, and assist in expiration. Relations.—Externally, the external and internal intercostal muscles ; internally, 16 parietal layer of the pleura, which is separated from them by a thin aponeurosis bmetimes called the endothoracic fascia. I 6. THE DIAPHRAGM The diaphragm—named from its function as the hd(f)payfjia, or partition wall ptween the thorax and abdomen—is a dome-shaped musculo-membranous sheet of ! kidney-shaped outhne when seen from above, and consists of a pair of muscles ith a lateral origin and a central aponeurotic insertion, resembling the two •ansversales abdominis, which unite in the linea alba so as also to form a single jome-shaped biventral muscle. Fict. 802.—Diaphragm. Origin.—By three portions :— 1. Anterior or sternal portion.—The lower border and back of the ensiform jartilage, and the adjacent part of the back of the anterior aponeurosis of the [ransversalis abdominis. ! 2. Lateral or costal portion.—^The lower border and inner surface of the iartilages of the six lower ribs, and sometimes also from the adjacent part of jhe ribs. [ 3. Posterior or vertebral portion.—(1) The ligamentum arcuatum externum, a jibrous thickening of the anterior layer of the lumbar fascia, which stretches from ihe tip of the transverse process of the second lumbar vertebra to the tip of the last rib; (2) the ligamentum arcuatum internum—a fibrous thickening of the |hac fascia, w^hich arches over the upper part of the psoas from the side of the body ')f the second lumbar vertebra to the tip of its transverse process; (3) the crus of he diaphragm—a strong vertical band, fleshy externally, tendinous internally—

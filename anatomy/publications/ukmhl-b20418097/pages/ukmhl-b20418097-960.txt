OBGANS OF SPECIAL SENSE 922 Each papilla presents a narrow attached base and a broad free end, and is seated in a circular cup which is surrounded by a rim or vallum. Upon the bases of most of these papillae a central depression marks the orifice of one or more glands. Secondary papillae lie hidden under the thick epithelial covering both of the chief papilla and the circular rim which surrounds it. The fungiform papillae are more thinly covered w^ith epithelium, and they are redder in colour than the smaller papillaB amongst which they are scattered. They occur irregularly over the dorsum, sides, and tip of the tongue, being attached by a Fig. 507.â€”Dorsum of the Tongue.

The filiform or conical papillse, named from their general shape, thi-ckly beset the whole of the dorsum, sides, and tip of the tongue in front of the circum vallate group. They faintly ridge the organ wdth delicate lines, which posteriorly lie parallel with the circumvallate papilla, but become more and more transverse in direction as they approach the tip and sides of the tongue. They present secondary papillae upon their surfaces thickly overlaid with epithelium.

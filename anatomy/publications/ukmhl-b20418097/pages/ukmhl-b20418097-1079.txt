THE DUODENAL FOLD 1041 of the intestine takes place and the colon rises up and crosses in front of the duo- denum, the peritoneum between the meso-duodenum and meso-colon must be folded upon itself. The folding is V-shaped, the apex of the V being placed below, and the plication being in or about the median line. The two membranes on a transverse section would have the relation to one another shown in fig. 598, C. The third part of the duodenum is brought closer to the posterior parietes; the Fig. 605.—Intestine of Macropus penicillatus. COLON peritoneum in connection with it is curtailed; and the relations of the structures around are readjusted As a result of these changes, which can be followed in many ! of the lower mammals, a distinct fold is produced which is connected with the third and terminal parts of the duodenum, and is often of considerable size. This fold can be well studied in Macropus. It appears to come off from that margin of the bowel which is immediately opposite to the attachment of the meso-duodenum Fig. 606.—Duodenal Fold of Macropus penicillatus. j(figs. 605, 606). It ends below in a free edge, and posteriorly it either joins the peritoneum on the posterior parietes close to the origin of the descending meso- colon, or it joins the meso-colon at some little distance from the spine. I The traction about this somewhat firmly held segment of bowel has been such that it has been drawn between the layers of its own meso-duodenum. It is by this [ fold that is formed the wall of the fossa duodeno-jejunalis (page 1002, fig. 572). 3 X

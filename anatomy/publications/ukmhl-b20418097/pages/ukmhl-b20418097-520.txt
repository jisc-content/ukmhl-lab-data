THE MUSCLES 482 Action.—(1) To draw downwards the sides of the tongue, increasing its trans- verse convexity ; (2) to draw backwards the protruded tongue. Relations.—Externally, the mylo-hyoid, digastric, stylo-hyoid, and stylo- glossus muscles, the lingual vein, lingual gustatory and hypoglossal nerves, the submaxillary gland and Wharton's duct; deeply, the inferior lingualis, genio- hyo-glossus, middle constrictor, and part of the origin of the superior constrictoi', the lingual artery, and giosso-pharyngeal nerve. Fig. 315.—Side View of the Muscles of the Tongue. of 3. STYLO-GLOSSUS The stylo-glossus—named from its attachments to the styloid process anc tongue (yAtoa-ora)—is a long, triangular sheet. Origin.—(1) The front of the lower part and tip of the styloid process of th( temporal bone ; (2) the upper part of the stylo-maxillary ligament. j Insertion.—The submucous tissue and subjacent muscular strata of the side o:i the tongue and the adjacent parts of its under surface. Structure.—Arising by short tendinous fibres, the muscle soon develops into i long, fan-shaped, laterally-compressed sheet, which passes in a long curve, with ar upward concavity, forwards and slightly downwards and inwards, to the side of th( tongue, where it partly overlaps and partly interlaces with the hyo-giossus muscle forming with this muscle and some of the fibres of the palato-glossus a thir superficial stratum which is continued forwards to the tip of the tongue. Nerve-supply.—From the hypoglossal nerve, by filaments which enter it external surface. Action.—(1) To draw back the tongue—for this purpose it arises from th^ styloid process as low as possible below the level at which the two other styloi( j muscles arise; (2) to draw upwards the sides of the tongue, so as to help th i genio-hyo-glossi and some of the intrinsic muscles in making its upper surfac j concave from side to side.

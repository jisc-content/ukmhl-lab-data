THE NEBVOUS SYSTEM 856 adherent for some distance to the dee^^ surface of the great sciatic in the part of its course where it hes between the latter nerve and the bone. It then passes, under cover of the tendon of the obturator internus and the gemelH, and, having suppHed the gemeUus inferior, ends in the deep or anterior surface of the quadratus femoris, and in the posterior part of the capsule of the hip joint. 6. The small sciatic nerve springs from the posterior aspect of the second and third sacral nerves, and, passing downwards, escapes through the great sacro- FiG. 466.â€”A Dissection of the Lumbar and Sacral Plexuses, from behind.

It then runs downwards on the posterior surface of the great sciatic nerve, under cover of the gluteus maximus muscle, to which it furnishes a branch. This branch is probably a portion of the inferior gluteal nerve, which has adhered in a part of its course to the small sciatic. It then runs vertically down the middle of the posterior aspect of the thigh, beneath the fascia lata, crosses the popliteal space, and pierces the deep fascia a little below the knee, to end in the integument of the upper part of the calf, where it may

THE EAB 919 The Saccule, which is sHghtly flattened, occupies the front and lower part of the cavity at the opening of the scala vestibuh of the cochlea. From the hollow of the fovea hemispherica it receives numerous nerve filaments, and presents a thickened area with attached otoliths. The membranous canal of the cochlea is connected with the saccule by a short canal, the canalis reuniens. Fig, 504.—Membranous Labyeinth (magnified), with Nerves.

CANALIS " AMPULLA I REUNIENS j The two sacs are indirectly connected by means of a small tube which leaves the saccule to join the commencement of a minute canal, as it passes from the (utricle to enter the aqueductus vestibuli. Within each semicircular canal the membranous labyrinth occupies less than a third of the area of the tube, but follows its curves and repeats its ampuUary lenlargement; and here the wall is thicker and more opaque, and more completely fills the cavity. The membranous ampullae are flattened on their external walls.

THE NOSE By ARTHUR HENSMAN, F.R.C.S. LECTUREK OX ANATOMY AT THE MIDDLESEX HOSPITAL MEDICAL COLLEGE ; AND SURGEOX TO THE THROAT AND EAR DEPARTMENT OP THE MIDDLESEX HOSPITAL. The nose includes a visible external portion, the nose proper ; and an internal cavity, the nasal fossa. The Nose Proper is triangular in shape ; its root above is at the forehead, from which the bridge or dorsum slopes downwards and forwards to end in a rounded tip or lobe. The base below overhangs the upper lip ; it here presents two orifices, the nostrils, which are divided by the columna.

Its sides slope from the dorsum outwards and backwards, and terminate below in the alse or wings, which bound the nostrils externally. It presents a dense unyielding bony framework, formed by the two nasal bones, with the nasal processes of the maxillas above, and by the projecting anterior nasal spine below. To this is added a yielding cartilaginous portion, which completes the organ, forming its chief part.

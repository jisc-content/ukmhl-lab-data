The superior mediastinum has the following boundaries : -the manubrium with the origins of the sterno-hyoid and sterno-thyroid muscles in front; the bodies of the four highest thoracic vertebra behind, with the lower portions of the longus colli muscles ; and on each side the pleural sacs. Above, the boundary corresponds with the superior aperture of the thorax, and below with a nearly horizontal plane passing backwards from the articulation between the manubrium and gladiolus of the sternum, to the lower part of the body of the fourth thoracic vertebra.

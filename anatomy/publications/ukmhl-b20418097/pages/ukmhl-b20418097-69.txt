31 THE OCCIPITAL and squamo-occipital fuse together about the fifth year, and unite with the basi- occipital before the seventh year. The posterior two-thirds of each occipital condyle belongs to the ex-occipitals, and the anterior third to.the basi-occipital (fig. 33). Fig. 84.â€”The Occipital at Birth. (Anterior view.)

By the twenty-fifth year the basi-occipital is firmly ankylosed to the sphenoid.

MOBPHOLOGY OF THE SKULL 99 i| without any diploe, and their cranial surfaces present no digital impressions. Six mem- lii branous spaces exist, named fontanelles : two are median, named anterior and posterior; ii' and two exist on each side, termed anterior and posterior lateral fontanelles. Each angle of the parietal bones is in relation with a fontanelle. The anterior fontanelle is lozenge- t,.i, shaped, the posterior triangular. The lateral fontanelles are irregular in outline.

Turning to the base of the skull, the most striking points are the absence of the mastoid processes and the large angle which the pterygoid plates form with the skull base, whereas m the adult the angle is almost a right one. The base of the skull is relatively short, and the lower border of the mental symphysis is on a level with the occipital condyles. H 2

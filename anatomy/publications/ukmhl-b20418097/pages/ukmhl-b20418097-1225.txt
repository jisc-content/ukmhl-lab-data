4 g2 THE ABM 1187 A line drawn along the inner edge of the biceps from the insertion of the teres major to the middle of the bend of the elbow corresponds to the brachial artery. In the upper two-thirds this artery can be compressed against the bone by pressure outwards; in its lower third the humerus is behind it and pressure T [should be made backwards. The superior profunda comes off from the highest part of the artery and courses with the musculo-spiral nerve (page 1188)"; the Fig. 730.â€”Deep View of the Front of the Upper Arm. y >elow the middle, and courses Avith the ulnar nerve through the intermuscular It eptum to the back of the internal condyle. The anastomotica is given off from ! 'ne to two inches above the bend of the elbow. The centre of the arm is a landmark for many anatomical structures. On the ( [uter side is the insertion of the deltoid; on the inner that of the coraco-brachialis. , The basilic vein and the nerve of Wrisberg here perforate the deep fascia, going in everse directions. The inferior profunda is here given off from the brachial; the

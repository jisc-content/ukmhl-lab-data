THE NECK 1133 (ii) Sterno-clavicnlar. This is best marked below. In the middle line it meets its fellow, and blends with No. i. here also. Passing outwards, it encases the depressors of the hyoidbone, finally blending with No. i. at the posterior border of the sterno- mastoid. (iii) Tracheal. This lies under the depressors of the hyoid, over the trachea, also encasing the thyroid gland. Farther out, it forms the carotid sheath, and, blending with No. iv. over the anterior scalene, is thus brought into continuity with Nos. i. and ii. also, (iv) Prevertebral. This layer passes over the longus colli and rectus capitis antieus major. The above layers should also be traced vertically, with especial reference to their relations at the level of the top of the sternum and the clavicle, (a) At the level of the top of the sternum, (i) Superficial, passes over the sternum, (ii) Sterno- clavicular : this, descending in front of the depressor muscles, divides just below Fig. 681.- Section of Neck through the Sixth Cervical Vertebra.

Between these lie some fat and a small gland, (iii) Tracheal: this 3ses down over the trachea into the thorax (middle mediastinum). As it descends, it encases the left innominate vein, and ends by blending with the fibrous layer of the pericardium. Mr. Hilton suggested that the attachment of this fascia above, and that of the central tendon of the diaphragm below, to the pericardium served to keep this sac duly stretched, and so prevented any pressure of the lungs lupon the heart, (iv) Prevertebral: this, descending behind the oesophagus, dips into the posterior mediastinum. (/3) At level of the clavicle. Only two of the above layers are met with so far outwards as thisâ€”(i) Subcutaneous, which passes over the clavicle ; (ii) sterno-clavicular, which, having encased the omo-hyoid, passes behind the clavicle, blends with the sheath of the subclavius, and gives a sheath to the subclavian vein. That to the artery is derived from No. iii. at the scalenus antieus.

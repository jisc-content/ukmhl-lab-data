284 THE ARTICULATIONS t j In walking, the heel is first placed on the ground ; the foot is slightly adducted ; \ but as the body swings forwards, first the outer then the inner toes touch the ground, I the astragalus presses against the scaphoid and sinks upon the spring ligament; ! the foot then becomes slightly abducted. When the foot is firmly placed on the j ground, the weight is transmitted to it obliquely downwards and inwards, so that ! if the ligaments between the calcaneum and astragalus did not check abduction, j inward displacement of the astragalus from the tibio-fibular arch would only be I prevented by the tendons passing round the inner ankle (especially the tibialis i posticus). If the ligaments be too weak to limit abduction, the weight of the body i increases it, and forces the inner malleolus and astragalus downwards and inwards, ' giving rise to flat foot. !

217 THE SYMPHYSIS PUBIS The anterior ligament (figs. 210 and 211) is thick and strong, and is closely connected with the fascial covering of the muscles arising from the body of the ipubes. It consists of several strata of thick decussating fibres of different degrees of obliquity, the superficial being the most oblique, and extending lowest over the joint. The most superficial descending fibres extend from the upper border of the pubis, cross others from the opposite side about the middle of the symphysis, and 1 Fig. 211.—Anterior View of the Symphysis Pubis (Female showing greater Width between the Bones). Superior pubie ligament are attached to the ramus of the opposite bone. The most superficial ascending fibres come from the infrapubic ligament, arch upwards, and decussate with other fibres across the middle line, and are lost on the opposite side beneath the descending set. There is another deeper set of descending fibres which arise below the angle, but do not descend so far as the superficial; and a deeper set of ascend- ing, which decussate, and reach higher than the superficial set, and are connected Fig. 212.—Posterior View of the Symphysis Pubis, showing the Backward Projection or the Symphysial Substance and the Decussation of the Fibres from the Inferior Pubic Ligament. with the infrapubic ligament. Some few transverse fibres pass from side to side, especially above and below the points of decussation. ! The inferior or infrapubic ligament (figs. 210, 211 and 212) is a thick, arch-like ' band of closely packed fibres which fills up the angle between the pubic rami, and forms a smooth, rounded summit to the pubic arch. On section, it is yellowish in colour and three-eighths of an inch (1 cm.) thick in the middle line ; it is i i

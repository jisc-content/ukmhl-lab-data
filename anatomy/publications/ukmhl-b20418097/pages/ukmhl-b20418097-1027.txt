THE PERITONEUM Its general character.—The peritoneum is a thin and delicate serous membrane which hnes the cavity of the abdomen from the diaphragm to the pelvic floor, and linvests or covers to a varying extent the viscera which that cavity contains. 'Viewed in its very simplest condition, it may be regarded as a closed sac, the inner sm^face of which is smooth and perfectly polished, while the outer surface is rough and is attached to the tissues w^hich surround it. Could it be possible for the peritoneum to be removed entire from the body by some process of superhuman dissection, it would appear simply as a huge thin-walled bag. In the male subject the peritoneum forms actually a closed sac; but in the Fig. 561.—Transverse Section of the Peritoneal Sac at about the Level OF the Umbilicus. female its w^all exhibits tw^o minute punctures, which correspond to the openings of the Fallopian tubes. That part which lines the walls of the abdomen is termed the parietal peritoneum ; that w^hich is reflected on to the viscera is the visceral peritoneum. The disposition of the peritoneum may first be studied by noting its arrangement as made evident in transverse sections of the abdomen at certain levels. The first section to be described shows the peritoneum in its simplest condition. This is a transverse section through the body, at about the level of the upper surface of the fourth lumbar vertebra, and therefore about the site of the umbilicus (fig. 561). Starting on the inner surface of the anterior abdominal parietes, the

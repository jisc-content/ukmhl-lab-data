THE CARPUS 139 The Semilunar 1^1 The semilunar has a convex superior surface for articulation with the lower XtiH end of the radius and the fibro-cartilage of the wrist. Its inferior surface is deeply concave for the head of the magnum. The ulnar ridge of the inferior articular surface, is faceted for the unciform. The outer (radial) surface has a narrow semilunar facet for the scaphoid, whilst the inner (ulnar) aspect of the bone Fig. 138.—The Left Hand. (Palmar sm-face.)

The palmar and dorsal surfaces are rough and non-articular. Of these, the palmar is usually the more extensive ; in the remaining carpal bones the dorsal surface is the broader. Articulations.—With the radius, scaphoid, cuneiform, magnum, and unciform.

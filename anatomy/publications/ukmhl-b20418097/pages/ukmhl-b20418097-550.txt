Others occasionally reach the same fossa through the anterior condyloi foramen ; while others pass through the cartilage of the middle lacerated forame and supply the middle fossa of the skull. i 2. THE SUPEEIOR THYROID ARTERY The superior thyroid artery arises from the front of the external carotid little above the origin of that vessel, and, coursing forwards, inwards, and th( downwards, in a tortuous manner, supplies the depressor muscles of the hyoid bon the larynx, the thyroid body, and the lower part of the pharynx. The artery first runs forwards and a little upwards, just beneath the greater cornu of t] Fig. 332.—Scheme of Superior Thyroid Artery Facial arter'i ■—— P\ ^ External carotid artery Ascending pharyngeal arteri Lingual arterv Supra-hyoid branch Infra-hyoid branch Superior laryngeal branch '\^^^') ^ / 1 ^ Internal carotid artery ' 1/ -FTC - -Tm Crico-thyroid branch Steriio-mastoid branch Superior thyroid artery Common carotid artery Inferior thyroid artery hyoid bone. In this part of its course it lies in the superior carotid triangle, ar quite superficial, being covered only with the integument, fascia, and platys It next turns downwards, and passes beneath the omo-hyoid, sterno-hyoid, sterno-thyroid muscles, and ends at the upper part of the thyroid body by brea. up into branches, some of which pass downwards in front, and others behind lateral lobe of that structure to anastomose with ascending branches from inferior thyroid ; whilst others, again, but much smaller in size, pass in the subst of the isthmus across the front of the trachea to anastomose with the sup' thyroid artery of the opposite side. These vessels, however, are so small, thati: isthmus is divided accurately in the middle line, there is practically no art| haemorrhage. From the branch to the thyroid body twigs are given off tc: inferior constrictor and the upper part of the oesophagus. These anastomose |

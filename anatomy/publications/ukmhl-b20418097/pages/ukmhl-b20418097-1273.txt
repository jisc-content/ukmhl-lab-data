THE ANKLE 1235 (B) Behind.—The tendo Aehillis, the thickest of all tendons, begins near the middle of the leg, in the junction of the tendons of the gastrocnemii and soleus. Very broad at its commencement, it gradually narrows and becomes very thick, j About an inch and a half from the heel, or about the level of the internal malleolus, is its narrowest point. After this it again expands slightly, to be attached to the middle of the back part of the calcaneum.

Along the nner, the tendon of the tibialis posticus and the posterior tibial vessels and nerve Fig. 780.—Kelations of Parts behind the Inner Malleolus. (Heath.)

Along the outer, the external saphenous vein (more raperfioially) ascends from behind the external malleolus. (C) On the inner side.-The tendon of the tibialis posticus, which has previously brossed from the interspace between the bones of the leg to the mner side, lies behind the inner edge of the tibia above the internal malleolus, being here under 'he flexor longus digitorum, the two tendons here becoming superficial on the inner

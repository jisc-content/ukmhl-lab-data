THE SKELETON c A vertebra presents the following parts : The body or centrum is a solid disc of bone slightly concave on its superior and inferior aspects, and wider transversely than antero-posteriorly. The upper and loAver surfaces are rough for intervertebral discs, and the margins are slightly lipped. The circumference of the body is, in front, concave vertically, but convex from side to side ; posteriorly it is excavated, and presents foramina for the escape of veins from the cancellous tissue. On the Fig. 5.—A Thoracic Vertebra. (Side view.) DEMI-FACET FOR HEAD OF RIB SUPERIOR ARTICULAR PROCESS' FACET FOR TUBERCLE OF R TRANSVERSE PROCESS sides of the body, at the upper and lovvW angles, there are four demi-facets ; when two vertebra are superimposed, the adjacent demi-facets form a complete articular facet for the head of a rib. The pedicles are two constricted short piers of bone projecting horizontally backw^ards from the upper angles of the posterior surface. The lower border of Fig. 6.—A Thoracic Vertebra. FACET FOR TUBERCLE OF RIB DEMI-FACET FOR HEAD OF RIB each pedicle is deeply notched ; hence, when two vertebrae are in position the notches are converted into intervertebral foramina for the transmission of spinal nerves and vessels. The laminae are broad plates of bone continuous with the pedicles ; each

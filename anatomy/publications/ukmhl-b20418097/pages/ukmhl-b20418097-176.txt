THE SKELETON The Scaphoid This is the largest bone of the proximal row. Its superior surface is some- what triangular and convex for articulation with the lower end and styloid process of the radius. Its inferior surface has tw^o facets : a large one for the trapezium, and a small one for the trapezoid. The dorsal surface is occupied by a long, deep groove for ligaments. The palmar surface is rough and concave above; below, Fig. 137.—The Left Hand. (Dorsal surface.) SEMILUNAR it has a prominent tuberosity for the attachment of the anterior annular ligament and the ahchictor i)ollicis muscle. The outer (radial) surface is rough for liga- ments. The inner (ulnar) surface is occupied by two articular facets, of which the upper one is crescentic in shape for the semilunar bone, whilst the lower is deeply concave for the reception of the head of the magnum. Articulations.—With radius, trapezium, trapezoid, magnum, and semilunar.

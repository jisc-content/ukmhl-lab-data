THE TABSAL JOINTS 287 (i) The Astmgalo-scaphoid Articulation This is the only ball-and-socket joint in the tarsus. It communicates with the interior calcaneo-astragaloid articulation, and two of the ligaments which close it n do not touch the astragalus, but pass from the calcaneum to the scaphoid. The LUiiting ligaments are : — External calcaneo-scaphoid. Inferior calcaneo-scaphoid. I Astragalo-scaphoid. I The external calcaneo-scaphoid has been already described (page 283). The inferior calcaneo-scaphoid ligament (figs. 256, 257) is an exceedingly dense thick plate of fibrous tissue. It extends from the sustentaculum tah and the Fig. 256.—View of the Foot from above, with the Astragalus removed to show THE Inferior and External Calcaneo-scaphoid Ligaments. Dorsal eubo-seaphoid m ligament m Dorsal ealeaneo-cuboid ligament Internal ealeaneo-euboid ligament External ealeaneo-seaplioid ligament Cut edge of interosseous ligament Inferior ealcaneo-seaplioid ligament Tendon of tibialis posticus under surface of the calcaneum in front of a ridge curving outwards to the anterior tubercle of that bone, to the whole width of the under surface of the scaphoid, and also to the inner surface of the scaphoid behind the tubercle. Inter- nally it is blended with the anterior portion of the internal lateral ligament of the ankle, and externally with the lower border of the external calcaneo-scaphoid iitt,lHligament. It is thickest along the inner border. Here it loses the well-marked fibrous appearance which it has in the sole, and becomes smooth and faceted. Over this part of the ligament the tendon of the tibialis ijosticus passes, giving considerable support to the head of the astragalus by assisting the power and spring of the ligament. The fibres of the ligament run forwards and inwards. The astragalo-scaphoid ligament is a broad, thin, but well-marked layer of fibres which passes from the dorsal and external surfaces of the neck of the astragalus to 4

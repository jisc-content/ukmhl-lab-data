INTEBNAL MAMMABY 549 lyraphatics in the superior and anterior mediastina and the remains of the thymus gland. (3) The pericardiac branches are distributed to the anterior surface of the ipericardium. (4) The sternal branches enter the nutrient foramina in the sternum, and also supply the triangularis sterni. (5) The anterior intercostal arteries (fig. 344)—two in each of the five or six upper intercostal spaces—run outwards from the internal mammary artery, along the lower border of the rib above and the upper border of the rib below, and Fig. 344.—Scheme of the Internal Mammary Artery. . Common carotid artery PHRENIC NEliVJ. Subclavian vein Anterior intercostal hrayicl Anterior intercostal branch Mu&culo-plirenic artery Deep circumflex iliac artery Internal jugular vein Subclavian vein Sealenus'anticus muscle STERNUM Internal intercostal muscle -I Perforating branch Siqyerior epigastric artery Deep epigastric artery anastomose with the corresponding upper and lower, branches of the aortic inter- icostals. Each paij of branches sometimes arises by a common trunk from the internal mammary, which in this case soon divides into an upper and lower branch, as above described. They lie at first between the internal intercostal muscles and the pleura; afterwards between the external and internal intercostal muscles. They supply the contiguous muscles, the pectoralis major, and the ribs. ^ ^ (6) The perforating or anterior perforating branches—five or six in number, one corresponding to each of the five or six upper spaces—come off from the front of the internal mammary, between the superior and inferior anterior intercostals, and, perforating the internal intercostal muscles, pass forwards between the costal

THE ULNA 131 THE ULNA The ulna is the inner bone of the forearm : it hes parallel with, but is longer than, the radius. The upper extremity is the thickest and strongest part of the ulna, and is of irregular shape. The superior articular surface is called the :greater sig^moid cavity, and receives the trochlea of the humerus ; it is transversely iconstricted near its middle. The prominence above the constriction is termed the olecranon, the part below the coronoid process. The olecranon process is the highest part of the ulna ; to its upper surface the itriceps is inserted, and the anterior margin of this surface affords attachment to Fig. 131.â€”Upper End of Left Ulna. (Outer view.) OLECRANON GREATER SIGMOID FOSSA Orbiexilar ligament Oblique ligament Plexor profundus digitorum LESSER SIGMOID FOSSA Supinator brevis Interosseous membrane the posterior hgament of the elbow. The anterior surface of the olecranon is articular, and forms the upper and back part of the greater sigmoid cavity, and its margins give attachment to ligaments. The posterior surface of this process is triangular, and separated from the skin merely by a bursa. On the inner side there is a tubercle for the origin of the flexor carpi ulnaris ; and below this a fasciculus of the internal lateral ligament of the elbow is inserted. The coronoid process forms the lower lip of the greater sigmoid cavity: its upper surface is articular and forms nearly a right angle with the olecranon portion. The anterior edge of the coronoid process is sometimes called the apex. The inferior aspect is rough for the insertion of the brachialis anticus muscle, and the lower outer angle has a tubercle to which the oblique ligament is attached. The inner edge has a smooth tubercle from which the flexor suhlimis digitorum arises ; the ridge of bone immediately beloAV this tubercle gives origin to the lesser K 2

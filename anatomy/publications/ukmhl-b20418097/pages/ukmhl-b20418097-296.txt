260 THE ABTICULATIONS anterior edge of the greater trochanter and to the spiral Hne as far as the inner borde of the shaft. The highest or outermost fibres are coarse, ahnost straight, and shorte than the rest; the innermost fibres are also thick and strong, but oblique. Thi varying obliquity of the fibres, and their accumulation at the borders, explains wh this band has been described as the Y-shaped ligament. About the centre of its bas( near the femoral attachment, is an aperture transmitting an articular twig froi' the transverse branch of the external circumflex artery. The ischio-femoral band (fig. 238) is formed of very strong fibres attached a along the upper border of the groove for the external obturator, and to the isclii;, margin of the acetabulum above the groove. The highest of these incline a littll Fig. 237.â€”Anterior View of the Capsule of the Hip Joint. upwards as they pass outwards to be fixed to the greater trochanter in front of t> insertion of the pyriformis tendon, while the other fibres curve more and me upwards as they pass outwards to their insertion at the inner side of the digill fossa, blending with the insertion of the external rotator tendons. When the joi' is in flexion these fibres pass in nearly straight lines to their femoral attachme and spread out uniformly over the head of the femur ; but in extension they w over the back of the femur in a zonular manner, embracing the posterior aspect the neck of the femur. The pectineo-femoral band (fig. 237) is a distinct but narrow set of fibres whi are individually less marked than the fibres of the other two bands ; they are fi. above to the anterior border of the pectineal eminence, reaching as far down as pubic end of the cotyloid notch. Below, they reach the neck of the femur, and fixed above and behind the lowermost fibres of the iho-femoral band, with whi they blend.

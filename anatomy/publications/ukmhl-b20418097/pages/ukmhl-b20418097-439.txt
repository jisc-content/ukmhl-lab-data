403 ABDUCTOR MINIMI DIGITI fibres still from the continuation of the aponeurotic band just mentioned, until it is inserted into the base of the first phalanx. Nerve-supply—From the external plantar division of the posterior tibial nerve, by filaments which enter the back part of the deep surface of the muscle near its inner border. j Action.—(1) To abduct the first phalanx of the little toe from the middle line ; |[2) to flex the metatarso-phalangeal joint of the little toe. ; The usual action of the muscle will be a combination of these two movements. I Relations.—Superficially, the plantar fascia, the flexor brevis Idigitorum, and Fig. 294.—Second Layer of the Muscles of the'Sole.

Deeply, the aecessorius, flexor revis minimi digiti, long plantar ligament, and peroneus longus tendon. Variations.—The muscular slip attached to the base of the fifth metatarsal bone is often ) distinct as to form a separate muscle, the abductor ossis metatarsi quinti. Second Layer The second layer consists of the flexor aecessorius muscle, the four lumbricaleS; nd the tendons of the flexor longus hallueis and the flexor longus digitorum. D D 2

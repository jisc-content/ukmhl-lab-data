1228 SUBGICAL AND TOPOGBAPHICAL ANATOMY below the internal tuberosity of the tibia (fig. 775). The deep part of the anastomotic artery runs in front of the tendon of the adductor magnus; the superficial with the internal saphenous nerve. The external saphenous vein perforates the roof of the popliteal space in its lower part. The popliteal glands are not to be felt unless enlarged.

This soon becomes sharp, and continues so for its upper two-thirds ; in the lower third it disappears, to be overlaid by the extensor tendons. It is curved somewhat outwards above, and inwards below. The inner border can also

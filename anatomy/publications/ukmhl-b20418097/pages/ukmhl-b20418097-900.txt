THE NERVOUS SYSTEM 862 I The POSTERIOR TIBIAL NERVE is the terminal branch of the internal popliteal, or rather the direct continuation of that nerve. It runs downwards with an inclination inwards to reach the interval between the inner malleolus and the os calcis, and, having- passed under cover of the origin of the abductor hallucis muscle, terminates by dividing into the internal and external plantar nerves. In the upper part of its course it is covered by the gastrocnemius, plantaris, and soleus muscles, and by the intermuscular part of the deep fascia of the leg. Lower down, as it approaches the Fig. 469.—Superficial Nerves in the Sole of the Foot. (Ellis.) Abductor minimi digiti External plantar artery EXTERNAL PLANTAR NERVE DIGITAL COLLATERAL BRANCHES OF EXTERNAL PLANTAR DIGITAL COLLATERAL BRANCHES OF INTERNAL PLANTAR ankle, it is covered only by the skin and fasciae. Its anterior relations are the tibialis posticus in the upper, and the flexor longus digitorum in the lower part of its course. The posterior tibial vessels are placed externally to its upper part; about the middle of the leg they cross in front of the nerve, and run downwards parallel to its inner side. Branches.—The posterior tibial nerve supplies the three deep muscles of the calf, viz. the tibialis posticus, flexor longus digitorum, and flexor long as hallucis.

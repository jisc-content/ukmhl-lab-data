THE ARTICULATIONS 194 The anterior oblique or lateral oceipito-atlantal ligament (fig. 195) is aiij accessory band which strengthens the capsule on the outer side. It is an oblique, thick band of fibres, sometimes quite separate and distinct from the rest, passing upwards and inwards from the upper surface of the transverse process beyond thel costo-vertebral foramen to the jugular process of the occipital bone. I The synovial membrane of these joints occasionally communicates with the| synovial sac between the odontoid process and the transverse ligament. | The arterial supply is derived from twigs of the vertebral, and occasionallj/j from twigs from the meningeal branches of the ascending pharyngeal. ! The nerve-supply comes from the anterior division of the suboccipital nerve. I Fig. 195.—x^nterior View of the Upper End of the Spine.

Almost the only movement permitted at these joints is of a gingiymoid character, producing flexion and extension upon a transverse axis drawn across the condyles at their slightly constricted parts. In flexion, the forehead and chin drop, and what is called the nodding move- ment is made ; in extension, the chin is thrown up and the forehead recedes. There is also a slight amount of gliding movement, either directly lateral, the outer edge of one condyle sinking a little within the outer edge of the socket of the

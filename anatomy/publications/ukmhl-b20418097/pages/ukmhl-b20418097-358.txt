THE MUSCLES 322 processes : the external intermuscular septum, which arises from the external con- dylar ridge and the outer border of the humerus ; and the internal intermuscular septum, which arises from the internal condylar ridge and the inner border of the humerus. The tube formed by the deep fascia is thus divided by the bone and these two septa into two compartments. In the front compartment are placed the flexors of the elbow-joint, and in the back compartment the great extensor muscle. : Fig. 270.â€”Superficial View op the FroNT of the Upper Arm. Flexoes of Tiif: Forearm The flexor muscles are three in number. The most superficial is the bicepj which arises from the scapula; while more deeply lie the brachialis anticus aBj brachio-radialis (supinator longus), which arise from the humerus.

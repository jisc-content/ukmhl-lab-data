739 LATEBAL VENTRICLES—BASAL GANGLIA The fascia dentata, or dentate convolution, is the free edge of the grey matter of the hemisphere, and derives its name from its characteristically notched or indented appearance. It is placed at the inner side of the dentate fissure, and follows this fissure upwards towards the splenium of the corpus callosum, where it becomes continuous with the fasciola cinerea. The fasciola cinerea is a grey lamina resembling the fascia dentata but with a smooth margin. It ends just above the splenium of the corpus callosum. Dissection.—The student should slice away the left hemisphere and expose the lateral ventricle of that side, leaving the central portion of the corpus caUosum in situ for the Fig. 418.—A Dissection showing the Free or Intraventricular Portion of the Caudate Nucleus. The Mesial and Tentorial Surfaces of the Hemisphere ARE ALSO shown. (From a mounted specimen in the Anatomical Department of Trinity College, Dublin.)

If he has carried out the dissection as recommended on the right side, he will now be in a position to study the corpus striatum both in hori- zontal and vertical section, and at the same time to examine its intraventricular part more fuUy. The horizontal sections will pass through both nuclei of the corpus striatum with the inner and outer capsules, the claustrum, and a portion of the optic thalamus (fig. 419). Basal Ganglia of the HEMisrHERES A series of ganglionic masses is placed in the base of each cerebral hemisphere. They are subjacent (with the exception of the amygdaloid nucleus) to the island of Reil and form, with that lobe, the oldest part of the hemisphere; that is to say, they constitute the portion which is (as already mentioned) the first to appear both in the vertebrate series and also in the development of the individual. They are all semi-detached local thickenings of the grey cortex, and may be enumerated as follows:—the corpora striata, each composed of two nuclei, the nucleus caudatus 3 B 2

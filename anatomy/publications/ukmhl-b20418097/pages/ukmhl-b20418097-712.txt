THE VEINS 674 vein which lies between the trunk of the vena porta and the umbilical vein travels from left to right; but after birth, as the portal circulation becomes freely esta- blished and the umbilical vein and ductus venosus are obliterated, in the opposite direction, i.e. from right to left. Tributaries.—The pyloric, the gastric, the cystic (which latter usually enters the right branch), the superior mesenteric, and the splenic. The pyloric vein begins near the pylorus in the lesser curve of the stomach, and, running from left to right ^\iih. the superior pyloric artery, opens directly into the lower part of the portal vein. It receives branches from the pancreas and duodenum. Fig. 392.—The Veins of the Stomach and Portal Vein. (From a dissection by W. J. Walsham.) Cystic vein Right branch of portal vein Continvation of hepatic artery G astro-duodenal artery Pyloric vein Oiufntal vein L'\ft branch of portal vein The gastric or coronary vein runs with the gastric artery at first from right to left, along the lesser curve of the stomach, towards the cardiac end, and then, turning to the right, passes across the spine from left to right to end in the portal trunk a little higher than the pyloric vein (fig. B92). At the cardiac end of the stomach it receives small branches from the oesophagus. The cystic vein returns the blood from the gall-bladder. It usually opens into the right branch of the portal vein. Tho superior mesenteric vein begins in tributaries which correspond with the branches of the superior mesenteric artery. It courses upwards a little, in front and to the right of the artery, passing with that vessel from between the layers of the

SURGICAL AND TOPOGRAPHICAL ANATOMY 1246 at the instep, along the tarso-metatarsal joints. This, as well as the longitudinal arch, yields in walking, and so gives elasticity and spring. Uses of the arches.—(1) They give combined elasticity and strength to the tread. Thus they give firmness, free quickness, and dignity, both in standing and walking, instead of what we see in their absence, viz. the lameness of an artificial limb, and the shuffling or hobbling which goes with tight boots, deformed toes, flat-foot, bunions, corns, etc. ; (2) they protect the plantar vessels, nerves, and muscles ; (3) they add to man's height; (4) they make his gait a perfect combina- tion of plantigrade and digitigrade, as is seen in man's walking, when he uses first the heel, then all the foot, and then the toes.

(1) Plantar fascia.—This is {a) a binding tie between the pillars of the longitudinal arch ; {h) it protects the structures beneath ; (c) it is a self-regulating ligament and protection. Thus, having a quantity of muscular tissue attached to its upper and back part, it constantly responds by the contraction of this, to the amount of any pressure made upon the foot. (2) Calcaneo- scaphoid ligament.—This is a thick plate of fibrous tissue, partly elastic, attached to the under surface of the calcaneum, sustentaculum tali, and scaphoid. It is thickest at its inner side, where it blends with the anterior part of the deltoid ligament, and where the tibialis posticus passes into the sole, giving much support to the head of the astragalus, and assisting the power and spring of this ligament {vide infra).

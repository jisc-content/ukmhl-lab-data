120 THE SKELETON THE SCAPULA The scapula is a large flat bone, triangular in shape, situated on the posterior aspect of the thorax, and resting on the ribs from the second to the seventh. Of its two surfaces the anterior is deeply concave, forming the subscapular fossa, which • Fig. 123.—The Left Scapula. (Dorsal surface.) Coraeo-aeromial Peetoralis ligament minor Omo-hyoid and the transverse ligament is marked by several ridges commencing at the posterior border of the bone and passing transversely; these ridges divide this surface into several shallow grooves from which the subscapular muscle takes origin : the highest groove is the deepest. The outer third of this surface is smooth, and overlapped by the subscapiclar muscle : the superior and inferior angles are somewhat triangular, and connected by a narrow ridge of bone along the posterior border. This ridge and its terminal surfaces serve for the insertion of the serratus magnus. The posterior surface, or dorsum, is generally convex ; it is unequally divided

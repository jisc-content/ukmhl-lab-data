THYROID GLAND 953 The lateral lobes pass upwards on each side nearly as high as the oblique line which crosses the ala of the thyroid cartilage, and extend below as far as the fifth Dr sixth ring of the trachea. The isthmus, which varies in breadth a good deal in different subjects (from a quarter to three-quarters of an inch), usually covers the gecond and third rings, but sometimes descends over the fourth ring of the trachea. The gland is convex and rounded on its outer surface, but deeply it is moulded jO the parts which it overlies. It commonly weighs from one to two ounces, but is r in the female, and is often increased in size during menstruation. The lateral lobes are pyriform in shape, with their broad ends below, and Fig. 537.—View of Thyroid Body.

Relations.—The thyroid body is covered by the sterno-hyoid, sterno-thyroid, ^nd omo-hyoid muscles, and is slightly overlapped by the anterior border of the terno-mastoid muscle. The upper extremity of the lateral lobe lies between the terno-thyroid and inferior constrictor of the pharynx, which latter separates it from he hinder part of the ala of the thyroid cartilage and its inferior cornu. Its '•osterior rounded border reaches backwards as far as the pharynx, and comes into

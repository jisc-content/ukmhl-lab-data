THE KIDNEYS 1045 ertebrae, the right lymg in most cases from a third to half an inch lower than the left, but exceptions to this rule are not infrequent. i The posterior surface (figs. 610, 611), with the corresponding portion of the atty capsule, rests against the posterior abdominal wall in front of the eleventh and jwelfth ribs and the transverse processes of the first and second lumbar vertebrae ; he left kidney usually reaching as high as the upper border of the eleventh rib, he right only to its lower border. The only visceral relation posteriorly is on the eft side, where the spleen slightly overlaps the kidney opposite the upper half of its |)uter border. The parietal relations on both sides are as follow : (1) the diaphragm ; Fig. 611.—The Abdominal Viscera, seen from behind. (From the model of His.) The kidneys are somewhat lower than usual in their relations to the ribs. I) the anterior lamella of the posterior aponeurosis of the transversalis (separating lie organ from the quadratus lumborum); yd) the psoas ; (4) tne three fasciae— iaphragmatic, transversalis, and iliac —which line these muscles respectively ; and 5) the last thoracic, the ilio-hypogastric, and the ilio-inguinal nerves, and the anterior ivisions of the first and second lumbar vessels, all running obliquely downwards nd outwards in front of the quadratus lumborum to pierce the transversalis beyond le outer border of the quadratus. Owing to the higher level of the left kidney, i'S diaphragmatic area of contact is larger than that of the right organ. This rea moreover, may be increased on either side wheii the arcuate ligaments

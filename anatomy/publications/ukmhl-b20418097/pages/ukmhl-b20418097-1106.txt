1068 THE MALE BEPBODUCTIVE OBGANS spring from the upper part of the testicle, and, running in front of the deferential veins around the spermatic artery, are connected to each other by means of short transverse branches; finally, the right ends in the vena cava, the left in the left renal vein. The lymphatics of the vas and testicle accompany the veins. The former terminate in the pelvic iliac glands, the latter in the lumbar glands. The free anastomosis between the deferential, spermatic, and scrotal blood-! vessels explains why the ligature or excision of the spermatic veins and artery in \ varicocele leaves the nutrition of the testicle unimpaired; while the intercom-1 munication of the testicular and scrotal blood and lymph vessels behind the| epididymis accounts for the extension of inflammatory affections of the epididymis' to the scrotal integument. ' The Nerves of the testicle come from the aortic, renal, and hypogastric plexuses. | The vesicula seminalis is supplied by the deferential, inferior vesical, and; middle haemorrhoidal arteries: its lymphatics end in the pelvic glands, and the | nerves are derived from the hypogastric plexus. | SPERMATIC COED ' i The spermatic cord is the elongated pedicle of the testicle. It extends from the internal inguinal ring, where its component structures are collected together, through the inguinal canal, and into the scrotum as far as the summit ol ■ the testicle. Its constituent elements are as follow (fig. 626). ' Fig. 626.—Section of the Spermatic Cord. (After Henle.) ^ ----^^ —-Internal cremaster \ 1.

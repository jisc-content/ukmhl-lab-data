THE HIP JOINT 263 the head of the bone, which it tightly embraces a httle beyond its greatest I'cumference. It somewhat contracts the aperture of the acetabiilmn, and retams .6 head of the femur within its grasp after division of the muscles and capsular rament. It is covered on both aspects by synovial membrane. The synovial membrane lines the capsule and both surfaces of the cotyloid j-ament, and passes over the border of the acetabulum to reach and cover the Fig. 240. -Hip-joint after dividing the Capsular Ligament and DISARTICULATING THE FeMUR.

The part covering the fatty cusliion is unusually phick, and is attached round the edges of the rough bony surface on which the jiushion rests. The membrane is loosely reflected off this on to the ligamentum jteres, along which it is prolonged to the head of the femur ; thus the fibres of the round ligament are shut out from the jomt cavity. From the capsule the synovial membrane is also reflected below on to the neck of the femur, passing over the L'etinacula to the margin of the articular cartilage.

THE ABTEBIES 538 THE SECOND POKTION OF THE SUBCLAVIAN AETERY The second portion of the subclavian artery lies behind the scalenus anticus muscle. It measures about three-quarters of an inch in length (2 cm.), and here reaches highest in the neck. The subclavian vein is separated from the artery by the scalenus anticus, and lies on a lower and anterior jolane. Relations.—In front it is covered by the skin, superficial fascia, platysma, anterior layer of deep fascia, the clavicular origin of the sterno-mastoid, deep layer of deep fascia, and by the scalenus anticus. The phrenic nerve—which, in conse- quence of its oblique course downwards and inwards, crosses a portion of both the first and second part of the subclavian—is separated from the second portion by the scalenus anticus muscle. Behind the artery are the apex of the pleura and lung, and a portion of the scalenus medius. Above is the brachial plexus. Below are the pleura and lung. One branch only—the superior intercostal—is, as a rule, given off from this portion of the subclavian. Fig. 341.—The Subclavian Aetery.

It is more superficial than either the first or second portions ; it is in re tion with less important structures, and as a rule gives off no branch, and for.th' reasons is the part selected when practicable for the application of a ligature.

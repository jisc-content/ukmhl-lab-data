THE ABTICULATIONS 242 (a) The Superioe Eadio-ulnae Joint Class.—Diarthrosis. Subdivision.—Troclioidcs. The bones which enter into this joint are, the uhia by its lesser sigmoid ca-vit^ and the radius by the smooth vertical border or rim on its head. There is but on ligament special to the joint, viz.:— Orbicular. The orbicular ligament consists of bands of strong fibres, somewhat thicke than the capsule of the elbow-joint, which encircle the head of the radius retaining it against the side of the ulna. The bulk of these fibres forms aboii three-fourths of a circle, and they are attached to the anterior and posterio margins of the lesser sigmoid cavity; some few are continued round below tb lesser sigmoid cavity, and form a complete ligamentous circle. The ligament i inseparably connected along its upper edge and external (i.e. its non-articulai surface with the anterior, posterior, and external portions of the capsule of ih elbow, a few of the fibres of these portions, especially of the external, descendin< to be attached to the neck of the radius. The lower part of the articulatioi is covered in by a thin independent membranous layer, which passes from tbi lower edge of the orbicular ligament to the neck of the radius, strengthened oi the outer side by those fibres passing down from the capsule. They are loos- enough to allow the bone to rotate upon its own axis (fig. 230). The synovial membrane is the same as that of the elbow, and, after Hning th^ orbicular ligament, passes on to the neck of the radius, and thence up to th^ articular cartilage. The arterial and nerve-supply are the same as those to the outer part of thi elbow joint. [h) The Mid Radio-ulxar Union There are two interosseous ligaments which pass between the shafts of th bones and unite them firmly together, viz. : — Obhque ligament. Interosseous membrane.

100 THE SKELETON The facial skeleton is relatively small in consequence of the small size of the nasal fossae ; these are as wide as they are high, and are almost filled with the turbinals. The Peculiarities of Individual Bones at Birth. The occipital consists of four distinct parts : the basi-occipital, two ex-occipitals, and the squamo-occipital; these four parts are united by hyaline cartilage. Compared with the adult bone, the following are the most important points of distinction:—There is no Fig. 104.—The Occipital at Birth. TH pharnygeal tubercle or jugular process; the squamo-occipital presents two deep fissures separating the interparietal from the supraoccipital portion, and extending nearly as far inwards as the occipital protuberance. The grooves for the lateral sinus are absent. The sphenoid in a macerated foetal skull falls into three pieces. The main portion consists of the united pre- and post-sphenoid with the orhito-sphenoids and lingulae. The Fig. 105.—The Sphenoid at Birth. VIDIAN CANAL LINGULA pre-sphenoid is quite solid and connected with the ethmo-vomerine cartilage, and presents no traces of the air sinuses which occupy this part in the adult skull. The pre-sphenoid by its upper surface forms part of the anterior cranial fossa, from which it is subsequently excluded by the orbito-sphenoids. The optic foramina are large and triangular in shape.

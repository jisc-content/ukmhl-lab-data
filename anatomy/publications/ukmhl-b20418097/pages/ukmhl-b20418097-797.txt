759 PONS VABOLII a considerable prominence, which narrows on each side as it passes into the middle cerebral peduncles. At its lower border the pyramidal bodies are seen dis- appearing into its substance, while at its upper border the crura cerebri are seen emerging. It rests on the body of the sphenoid bone, reaching upwards as far as the margin of the dorsum sellae. It presents a ventral and a dorsal surface, and a superior and an inferior border. Lateral surfaces have also been described, but these are determined artificially by dividing the pons proper from the middle cerebellar peduncles.

(Henle.) The dorsal surface has been described in connection with the floor of the fourth ventricle. The ventral surface is broad and prominent, strongly convex from side to side, and slightly convex from before backwards. It presents a transverse striation, corresponding to the bundles of commissural fibres passing from hemisphere to hemisphere of the cerebellum. Mesially, it is marked by a sagittal groove or furrow, which usually lodges the basilar artery, but is in no way caused by the

EDITOR'S PEBFACE This Treatise on Human Anatomy is designed for the use of Students preparing for the Conjoint Board of the Royal Colleges of Physicians and Surgeons, for the Fellowship of the Eoyal College of Surgeons, and for the Examinations in Anatomy at the various Universities. It aims at being a complete and systematic description of every part and organ of the human body so far as it is studied in the dissecting room. Histology and development—except the mode and dates of development of the bones, and in a few other instances—are not included, as it is felt that these subjects are more appropriately dealt with in books on Physiology than they can conveniently be in works on Anatomy. The different sections have been written by separate Authors who are known to have devoted special attention to the subjects allotted to them. To these gentlemen my best thanks are due for their generous assistance and able co-operation. Whilst each Author is alone responsible for the subject-matter of the article which follows his name, the proof-sheets of other articles besides his own have in certain cases been submitted to him, so that several of the articles may be considered to have received the approval and endorsement of two, three, or more Authors. This has been particularly the case with the sections on Osteology, Arthrology, Myology, and Neurology. There is, therefore, reason to believe that such important points as the attachments of ligaments and of muscles, and the nerve-supply of muscles, etc., will be found to be in perfect accord in the various sections in which they are referred to or described. In the illustrations of the bones, the origins of muscles are indicated by red lines, the insertions by blue lines, and the attachments of ligaments by dotted black lines. A feature of the work which, it is confidently hoped, will facilitate the work of students, is the mode of describing the illustrations.

1071 THE PENIS inosa, and showing a distinct indication of division into two lateral lobes in the ilatter situation. The most prominent part of the base is called the corona glandis, and the furrow behind this is the neck of the penis. At its tip it presents a vertical fissure about one-third of an inch in length, the external urinary meatus or outlet of the urethra. The glans is composed of erectile tissue with coarse trabeculse, and is covered with a firmly adherent layer of skin continuous with the inner layer of the prepuce. Its capacity for vascular engorgement is much less than that of the corpus spongi- josum, and it never attains a like degree of hardness during erection. 1 The body of the corpus spongiosum is cylindrical, uniform in diameter, and Fig. 629.â€”The Male Perineum.

Structurally it is provided -'ith a thin albuginea, between which and the urethra lies a narrow layer of erectile issue. 1 The bulb is formed by an expansion of the erectile structure, and the portion of he urethra by which it is traversed undergoes a well-marked dilatation, and lies Barer its upper than its lower surface. It is about an inch and a half in length, nd its greatest width is about three-quarters of an inch. It is surrounded by the ulbo-cavernosi muscles, the greater part of the fibres of which pass between it

Tributaries.—In addition to the tributaries corresponding to the branches of the superior mesenteric artery—viz. the ileo-colic, right colic, middle colic, and small intestinal veins (fig. 393)—it receives the right gastro-epiploic and the pancreatico- duodenal veins just before its termination in the portal vein. The right gastro-epiploic vein accompanies the artery of that name. It runs from left to right along the greater curvature of the stomach, receiving branches from the anterior and posterior surfaces of that viscus, and from the great Fig. 393.—The Superior Mesenteric Vein. (The colon is turned up, and the small intestines are drawn over to the left side.) Left colic artery Superior mesen- teric artery and vein JEJUNUM Vasa intestini tenuis SMALL INTESTINES omentum, and, passing behind the first portion of the duodenum, ends in the superior mesenteric vein just before that vessel joins the portal trunk. The pancreatico-duodenal vein runs with the corresponding arteries between the head of the pancreas and the second portion of the duodenum, and ends in the superior mesenteric vein a little below the spot where that vessel is joined by the right gastro-epiploic vein. The splenic vein issues as several large branches from the hilum of the spleen. These soon unite to form a large trunk, which passes across the aorta and spine in company with the splenic artery, below which it lies, to join at nearly a right angle the superior mesenteric vein. In this course it lies behind the pancreas ; and at its X X 2

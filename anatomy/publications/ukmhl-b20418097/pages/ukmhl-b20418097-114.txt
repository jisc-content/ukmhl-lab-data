76 THE SEELETOX The occipital point (fig. 04) is the most posterior part of the skull, and is exactly opposite the ophryon. The inion corresponds to the external occipital protuberance. The lateral aspect of the skull is very uneven; it presents three recesses or fossfe. Its irregularity is increased by the zygoma. The temporal fossa, semilunar in shape, is limited above by the superior temporal ridge, and below by the zygoma. The temporal ridge begins at the external angular process of the frontal bone, and curves upwards and backwards to cross the frontal and parietal bones ; it then Fig. 83.â€”The Skull. (Norma lateralis.) descends along the mastoid portion of the temporal bone to become continuous with the upper border of the zygoma. In many skulls this ridge is double. The lower ridge gives origin to the temjwml muscle. The upper is the least constant; it diverges from the lower ridge as it approaches the coronal suture. At the middle of the parietal bone the two ridges are often ten milhmetres apart. This ridge gives attachment to tlie temporal fascia. The fossa is almost entirely occupied by the temjxjral muscle. The zygomatic fossa is limited anteriorly by the zygomatic surface of the maxilla ; internally by the external pter^'goid plate; externally by the zygomatic arch and the ramus of the mandible ; and posteriorly by a line drawn from the foramen spinosum to the zygomatic tubercle. The outer surface of the greater

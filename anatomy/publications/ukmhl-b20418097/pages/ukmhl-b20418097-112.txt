74 THE SKELETON The tensor tympani tendon is inserted into the manubrium near its junction with the neck on tlie inner side. The slender process (gracihs or Fohan) is a long, slender, delicate spiculum of bone (rarely seen of full length except in the foetus), projecting nearly at right angles to the anterior aspect of the neck, and extending obliquely downwards. It lies in the Glaserian fissure, and in the adult usually becomes converted into connective tissue, except a small basal stump. The short process is a conical projection from the outer aspect of the base of the manubrium. Its apex is connected to the upper part of the tympanic membrane, and its base Fig. 82.—The Ear Bones.

The malleus also gives attachment to the suspensory ligament, and to the long anterior ligament of the malleus which was formerly described as the laxator tijnipani muscle. The incus.—This bone is situated between the malleus externally, and the stapes internally. It presents for examination a body and two processes. The body is deeply excavated anteriorly for the reception of the head of the malleus.

If the hernia is now kept up, the truss is satisfactory. j Helping to protect this most important spot, and preventing its being more than a potential ring, are not only the two pillars, and the intercolumnar fascia, but also r structure which has been called a third or posterior pillar, namely, the triangulai' fascia. This has its base above at the lower part of the linea alba, where it joins it; | fellow and the aponeurosis of the external oblique, and its apex downwards and out \ wards, where, having passed behind the internal pillar, it blends with Gimbernat'ii ligament.

INGUINAL CANAL.—This is not a canal in the usual sense, but a chink or fla | sided passage in the thickness of the abdominal wall. The descriptions of th i canal usually given apply rather to the diseased than to the healthy state. It W£ j a canal once, and for a time only, i.e. in the later months of foetal life. It remairsij weak for a long time after, but only a vestige of it remains in the well-made adul j On the inner surface of the abdomen we have a few inconspicuous inguiuM fossettes; on the outer surface a separation between the fasciculi of the externj j oblique, carefully closed and protected ; in the interval between the two surfac( \ lies the cord or round ligament, in the thickness of the abdominal wall. !

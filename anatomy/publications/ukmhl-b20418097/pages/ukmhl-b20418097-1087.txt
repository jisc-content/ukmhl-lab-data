1049 THE KIDNEYS igiving off arterioles in both directions, the cortical branches supplying afferent twigs to the glomeruli within the capsules of Bowman; the medullary branches running inwards to form plexuses around the straight and looped tubules of the Malpighian pyramids. The efferent vessels of the Malpighian glomeruli form a capillary plexus around the uriniferous tubules and terminate in the renal veins. iThe surface of the kidney receives small collateral arteries which pass through the I Fig. 614.—Scheme of Tubules and Vessels of the Kidney.

The superficial 7eins appear in the form of little stellate groups (stars of Verheyen), which are kery distinct when the organ is congested. The renal lymphatics may be divided nto two sets, capsular and parenchymatous. They terminate in a series of glands ying with the renal vessels in the subperitoneal tissue, and their contents are liltimately conveyed into the receptaculum chyli.

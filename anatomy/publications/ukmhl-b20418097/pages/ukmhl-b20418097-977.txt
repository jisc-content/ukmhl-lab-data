THE LABYNX 989 The THYROID CARTILAGE forms the front and sides of the upper part of the larynx, being placed above the cricoid. It consists of two nearly square symmetrical plates, or alee, united in front, where they form the pomum Adami, but widely separated behind. They include between them an angle varying from 80° to 90°, and are somewhat obliquely inclined, their outer surfaces looking slightly downwards as well as outwards. Each plate has an outer and an inner surface and four borders. The upper and lower angles of each plate project upwards and downwards to form posteriorly its superior and inferior cornu. The outer surface is smooth, and is crossed by an oblique and often very faintly defined line, or by an occasional fibrous band. This is marked at each extremity by a small tubercle. These tubercles are more pronounced in old subjects. The Fig. 523.—Front View of the Cartilages of the Larynx. (Modified from Bonrgery and Jacob.) line and the adjacent cartilage give attachments to the thyro-hyoid and sterno- thyroid muscles, and the smaller portion (one fourth) of the ala which lies behind it is overlapped by the inferior constrictor, this muscle arising from its anterior part. The inner surface is also smooth ; it is concave, and in contact with the mucous membrane which lines the sinus pyriformis. The anterior or isthmic border, which is also the shortest, corresponds to the junction of the two alfe in the median line in front; very prominent above, where it forms the pomum Adami, it becomes depressed before again projecting less markedly [below. Posteriorly, at the angle of junction it gives attachment to the stalk of the epiglottis, the true and false vocal cords, the thyro-arytenoid and thyro-epiglottidei muscles. The superior border, which gives attachment to the thyro-hyoid membrane, is

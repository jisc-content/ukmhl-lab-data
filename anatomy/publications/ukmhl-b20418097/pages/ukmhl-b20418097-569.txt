531 BRANCHES OF OPHTHALMIC times of large size, and takes the chief share in the formation of the lachrymal artery, (ii) Muscular branches, distributed chiefly to the external rectus. (iii) Malar branches—small twigs, which pass through the malar canals, and anasto- mose with the orbital branch of the middle temporal, and with the transverse facial on the cheek, (iv) Palpebral branches, which are distributed to the upper and lower eyelids and to the conjunctiva, (v) Ciliary. See Ciliaey Arteries, page 532. (b) The Supraorbital Artery The supraorbital artery usually arises from the ophthalmic as the latter vessel is about to cross over the optic nerve. Passing upwards to the inner side of the jsuperior rectus and levator palpebras, it runs along the upper surface of the latter [muscle with the frontal nerve, but beneath the periosteum to the supraorbital 'notch. On emerging on the forehead beneath the orbicularis palpebrarum, it divides Fig. 339.—The Ophthalmic Artery and Vein.

The branches ' the supraorbital are :—(i) Periosteal, to the periosteum of the roof of the orbit; ") muscular, to the levator palpebr^ and superior rectus ; (iii) diploic, given as the artery is passing through the supraorbital notch to the diploe and ntal sinuses ; (iv) trochlear, to the pulley of the superior oblique ; (v) palpebral, the upper eyelid.

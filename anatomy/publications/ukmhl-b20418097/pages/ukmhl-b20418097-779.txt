BASAL GANGLIA OF HEMISPHEBES 741 The tsenia semicircularis, or stria terminalis, is a band of fibres which passes upwards and backwards from the anterior pillar of the fornix, and traverses the groove between the caudate nucleus and the optic thalamus. It is reinforced by some fibres from the anterior cornu of the lateral ventricle. It accompanies the caudate nucleus into the roof of the descending cornu, and ends in the amygdaloid nucleus. In its course along the groove above mentioned it is partly covered by Fig. 419. -Horizontal Section of the Cerebrum. (After Landois and Stirling.)

The inner capsule is a broad baud of white fibres which is placed on the inner side of the nucleus lenticularis. In horizontal section it presents an anterior limb between the two nuclei of the corpus striatum, and a posterior limb which separates the nucleus lenticularis from the optic thalamus. These two limbs meet at an angle salient inwards. This angle is called the genu, and is placed adjacent to the taenia semicircularis. In vertical section the inner capsule presents a beautiful arched arrangement of radiating white fibres (fig. 417).

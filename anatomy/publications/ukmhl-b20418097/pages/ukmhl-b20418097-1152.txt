1114 SUBGICAL AND TOPOGBAPHICAL ANATOMY j prominence here does not necessarily imply the absence of a sinus, as this may hi formed by retrocession of the internal table. In old people these sinuses ma^ enlarge by the inner table following the shrinking brain. Again, a very prominen bump here does not necessarily point to the existence of a sinus at all, being diK merely to a heaping up of bone. The communication of these sinuses with the nose accounts for the frontaj headache in ozasna, and the fact that a patient with a compound fracture openimi up the sinuses can blow out a flame held close by. j The mastoid sinuses are arranged in two groups, of the utmost importance iii Fig. 662.—Drawing of a Cast of the Head of an Adult Male.

Inflammation here brings mischij nearer the lateral sinus and cerebellum. j The veins passing from the mastoid cells and tymixtnum fall into three chi | groups—(a) those opening into the lateral sinus; (h) those passing through t| mastoid foramen into the occipital and scalp veins ; (c) those running through t. j petro-squamosal suture to the dura mater. As all these veins carry connecti\ j tissue sheaths, inflammation may reach—{a) the lateral sinus, causing sep j phlebitis; {h) the soft parts outside, causing cellulitis, periostitis, etc.; (c)thedu| mater and brain, leading to meningitis and abscess.

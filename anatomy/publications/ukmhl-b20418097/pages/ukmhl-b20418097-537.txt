499 THE ARCH OF THE AOBTA The Descending Portion op the Arch of the Aorta The descending portion of the arch of the aorta, morphologically a part of the primitive dorsal aorta, descends by the left side of the body of the fourth and fifth thoracic vertebrae, and ends at the lower border of the latter in the thoracic aorta. Just below the spot where the ductus arteriosus (the fifth left arch) joins the aorta, a constriction (the aortic isthmus) is at times met with, and below this again a dilatation of a fusiform shape (the aortic spindle).

Behind, it is in relation with the left side of the bodies of the fourth and fifth horacic vertebrae and the pleura. To the right side are the oesophagus and thoracic duct, and the fourth and fifth horacic vertebrae. To the left side are the left pleura and lung. K K 2

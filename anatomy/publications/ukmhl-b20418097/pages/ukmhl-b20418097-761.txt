FISSUBE OF ROLANDO 728 The superior genu is directed backwards. The inferior genu looks forwards ; it is more constant and much more strongly marked than the superior genu. In rare cases the fissure of Rolando may communicate with the prascentral or intraparietal sulci, but as a rule it pursues an isolated course across the convex surface. It has been very generally taught that the fissure of Rolando is caused by the pressure of a vein which passes diu-ing fcetal life (ft-om the foiu-th to the sixth month) from the middle cerebral vein to the superior longitudinal sinus. This view has been recently disproved, as it has been shown that the fissure develops in two segments, an upper and a lower, and the fissm-e is afterwards completed by the sinking down of the central portion. The remains of this central elevation can always be seen on opening the fissm-e of Rolando as a deeply placed annectant or bridging convolution at the level of the superior genu. (Cunningham.) The fissiu-e of Rolando is one of the earliest of the incomplete fissm^es to appear, and is usually developed diu-ing the last week or ten days of the fifth month of intra-uterine life. By its transverse direction it interrupts the longitudinal coiu-se of the majority of the Fig. 410.â€”Lateral View of the Fissures and Convolutions of the Cerebrum.

It is one of the most important landmarks on the cerebral sm'-face, as the principal motor centres of the cortex are situated around it. I The Lobes of the Cerebeal Hemispheres with the Fissures and Convolutions Each cerebral hemisphere is divided into five lobes, viz. the frontal, parietal, i occipital, temporo-sphenoidal, and the central lobe or island of Reil. Four of these j lobes are visible on the peripheral part of the hemispheres ; the fifth, or island of Reil, is deeply placed and is concealed by the operculum. Two other lobes, the falciform and the so-called olfactory lobe, are also described. The falciform lobe is limited to the mesial and tentorial surfaces of ; 3 A 2

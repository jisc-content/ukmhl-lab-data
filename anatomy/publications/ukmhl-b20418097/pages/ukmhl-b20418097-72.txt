34 THE SKELETON petrosal nerve. The external surface is divided by the prominent malar crest into an orbital and a temporo-zygomatic portion. The orbital surface forms the chief part of the outer wall of the orbit; its internal segment forms part of the spheno-maxillary fossa, and presents the anterior orifice of the foramen rotundmn. Near the middle of the upper border there is a small tubercle for the origin of the outer head of the external rectus muscle; and at the highest part of this surface Fig. 38.—The Sphenoid. (Anterior view.) one or more foramina are often present, for the transmission of twigs from the middle meningeal artery to the orbit and the lachrymal gland. The malar crest is serrated for articulation with the malar bone; its lower angle, in many bones, articulates with the maxilla. A foramen exists in the suture between the sphenoid and malar, for the temporal twig of the orbital nerve. The surface of bone outside this ridge is subdivided by a low crest, the pterygoid ridge. The surface above the ridge forms part of the temporal fossa, and affords attachment to the temporal Fig. o9.—Eight Half of Sphenoid. (Anterior view.) muscle; the part behind the crest belongs to the zygomatic fossa, it furnishes attachment to the external pterygoid muscle, and is continuous with the outer surface of the external pterygoid plate; it contains the inferior orifices of the foramina spinosum, ovale, and Vesalii. The circumference of the great wing, commencing at its anterior attachment to the body, is at first smooth, and forms the lower boundary of the sphenoidal

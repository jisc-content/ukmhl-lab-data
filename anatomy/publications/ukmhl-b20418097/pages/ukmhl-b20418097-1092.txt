THE UBINABY OBGANS 1054 mesial sagittal section it usually appears somewhat cup-shaped, its upper wall presenting a rounded or pyramidal hollow to the intestines, while its cavity is represented by a T or Y-shaped fissure (as in plate 1 of Symington's ' Anatomy of the Child '). It is possible that this ' diastolic ' form, as it has been termed, is the normal result of a relaxation preliminary to refilling; but it appears more probable that it is due to the loss of vital elasticity of the muscular wall, and that the healthy living bladder always maintains a rounded or ovoid form. Fig. 617.—Median Sagittal Section of the Male Pelvis. (From a preparation in the Museum of St. Thomas's Hospital.) The three terms, ' apex ' or ' superior fundus,' ' inferior fundus,' and ' neck,' are commonly applied to parts of the bladder : the first to the point of attachment of the superior ligament or urachus (a relic of the tube of communication between the bladder and allantois) which connects it with the umbilicus ; the second to the lower part of the organ, and the third to the point at which the vesical cavity becomes continuous with the urethra ; but the expressions are all more or less objectionable, and serve no useful purpose. Uuder ordinary distension the so-called ' apex ' is as much rounded as the rest of the viscus ; the anatomical limits of the ' inferior fundus ' are still undefined ; and the only ' neck ' that can be assigned to the bladder is represented by the prostate and prostatic urethra. Relations.—The bladder when moderately filled may be said to present for description five aspects or surfaces : antero-inferior or pubic, posterior or rectal, superior or intestinal, and two lateral or obturator surfaces.

THE EAE By ARTHUR HENSMAN, F.R.C.S. LECTURER OX ANATOMY AT THE MIDDLESEX HOSPITAL MEDICAL COLLEGE; AXD SURGEOX TO THE THROAT AND EAR DEPARTMENT OF THE MIDDLESEX HOSPITAL. The organ of hearing may be divided into three parts : —the EXTERNAL EAR, which includes the pinna and external auditory meatus; the MIDDLE EAR, or tympanum, with its ventilating shaft the Eustachian tube ; and the INTERNAL EAR, which includes the osseous labyrinth, within which is placed—the essential portion of the organ—the membranous labyrinth. THE EXTEKNAL EAR The Pinna, or Auricle, is attached to the side of the head, midway between the forehead and occiput. Its level is indicated by horizontal lines extending backwards from the eyebrows above, and from the tip of the nose below. Somewhat pyriform in shape, its irregular concave outer surface is turned more or less forwards, but the Fig. 493.—External View of the Left Auricle. Triangulj fossa angle of inclination varies considerably in different subjects. The incurved rim of the ear, which divides its surfaces, commences below in a deep concavity which surrounds, like the mouth of a trumpet, the external auditory meatus. This rim is called the helix, and, traced round the ear, ends below at the posterior margin of the lobule. On the upper part of the inverted edge of the helix a little irregular process often exists, which has been regarded as the shrivelled tip of the primitive

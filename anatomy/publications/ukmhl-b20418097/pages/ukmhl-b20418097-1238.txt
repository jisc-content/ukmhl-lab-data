1200 SUBGIGAL AND TOPOGBAPHICAL ANATOMY require especial notice. The first starts at the wrist, between the thenar and hypo- thenar eminences, and, marking off the former eminence from the palm, ends at the outer border of the hand at the base of the index finger. The second fold is slightly marked. It starts from the outer border of the hand, where the first fold ends. It runs obliquely inwards across the palm, with a marked inclination towards the wrist, and ends at the outer limit of the hypothenar eminence. The third, Fig. 744.â€”Anastomoses and Distribution of the Arteries of the Hand.

An unimportant crease, running obhquely from the third to the second fold, gives to these markings the outHne of the letter M. The first fold is produced by the adduction of the thumb ; the second, mainly by the bending simultaneously

THE ABTEBIES 586 (9) inferior mesenteric; (10) right and left third lumbar ; (11) right and left fourth lumbar ; (12) right and left common iliac ; (IB) middle sacral. The above branches may be divided into the parietal, the visceral, and the terminal. The parietal branches are distributed to the abdominal walls. They are the right and left phrenics, and the four right and left lumbars. The visceral branches supply the viscera. Three of these are given off singly from the front of the aorta, namely, the coeliac axis, the superior mesenteric and the inferior mesenteric ; and three are given off in pairs, namely, the two suprarenals, the two renals, and the two spermatics. The terminal branches are the middle sacral and the right and left common iliac arteries. Fig. 364.—Scheme of the Abdominal Aorta.

The Pakietal Branches of the Abdominal Aorta 1. THE PHKENIC AETEEIES The right and left phrenic arteries—sometimes called the inferior phrenic to distinguish them from the diaphragmatic branches of the internal mammary and thoracic aorta—usually arise from the aorta as it passes between the crura of the diaphragm either as a common trunk or as separate vessels. At times they come off as a common trunk from the coeliac axis ; or either the right or left vessel may come from this artery, or from other of the upper branches of the abdominal aorta. The right phrenic passes (fig. 363) over the rigbt crus of the diaphragm behind the vena cava, and then upwards and to the right between the central and right leaflets of the central tendon of the muscle, where it divides into an anterior and

THE AETEBIES 556 latissimns clorsi, and serratus magnus muscles, and gives branches to the glands in the axillary space. The course of this large vessel along the posterior border of the axilla should be remembered in opening abscesses in the axilla, and in removing enlarged glands from this space. It is accompanied by two veins, which usually unite and then receive the dorsal scapular vein, and open as a single vein of large size either into the axillary or at the confluence of the inner brachial vena comes with the basilic vein. About an inch to an inch and a half from its origin, the subscapular artery gives off the following large branch :— The dorsal scapular, arising from the subscapular, usually at the above-mentioned Fig. 347.—The Dorsal Scapular Artery. (From a dissection in the Museum of the Eoyal College of Surgeons.) Supra-spinatus Posterior scapular arlery Suprascapular artery Infra-spinatus Rliomboideiis minor Levator anguli seapulse I Triceps Deltoid, insertion Deltoid Deltoid muscle Trapezius Bhomboideus major Teres major muscle Triceps Teres major, insertion Posterior circumflex artery Dorsalis scapulce artery spot, passes backwards through the triangular space bounded by the subscapularif above, the teres major below, and the long head of the triceps externally, and thei between the teres minor and the axillary border of the scapula, which it commonlj grooves. It thus reaches the infraspinous fossa, where, under cover of the infra spinatus, it anastomoses with the suprascapular and posterior scapular arteries (fig. 347). As it passes through the triangular space, it gives off a ventral branch sometimes called the infrascapular, which ramifies between the subscapularis am the bone, supplying branches to the subscapularis, to the scapula, and to]the shoulde joint. A second branch is often given off near the triangular space and passes down wards between the teres major and teres minor, supplying both muscles (fig.'348^ j 'Sii

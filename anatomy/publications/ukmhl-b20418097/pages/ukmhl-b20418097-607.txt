SUPEBFICIAL PALMAB ARCH 569 Behind, it rests upon, from within outwards, the short muscles of the Httle finger, the digital branches of the ulnar nerve, the flexor tendons, and the digital branches of the median nerve. Variations in the Superficial Palmar Arch The superficial palmar arch is very subject to variations. (A) It may be formed by the superficial branch of the ulnar anastomosing with the radialis indicis, or with the radial Fig. 354.â€”Anastomoses and Distribution of the Arteries of the Hand.

(B) The superficial volar may be larger than usual, and take a greater share than the ulnar in the formation of the arch. (C) The arch may be reinforced bj- a large median artery, or by an enlarged interosseous artery. (D) The arch may be double, both the superficial branch of the uhiar and the superficial volar dividing into two branches which anastomose across the palm. (E) The arteries of the thumb and radial side of the index finger may be given off from the arch. (F) The arch may be incomplete, the outer digital branches coming

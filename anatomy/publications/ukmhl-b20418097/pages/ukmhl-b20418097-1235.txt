The radial lerve will be marked by the same line (it lies just external to the artery) for its ipper two-thirds ; it then leaves the artery about three inches above the wrist joint, md passes to the back of the forearm under the tendon of the brachio-radiahs. Che anterior interosseous artery runs down on the interosseous membrane and passes to the back of the forearm by perforating it below. The posterior interosseous ies between the superficial and deep extensors. These small arteries reinforce the Fig. 741.—Distribution of Cutaneous Neeves on the Anterior and Posterior Aspects of the Superior Extremity. OF palmar through the carpal arches, and thus bring down blood after ligature of the trunks above. The front of the forearm is supplied by the musculo-cutaneous on the outer, and the internal cutaneous on the inner side ; just above the wrist the palmar cutaneous branches of the median and ulnar perforate the deep fascia (figs. 740, 741). The [back of the forearm is supplied by the musculo-spiral and posterior branches of the jmusculo-cutaneous externally, and the posterior branches of the internal cutaneous jinternally (fig. 741). The arrangement of the superficial lymphatics is shown in 'fig. 742. •!

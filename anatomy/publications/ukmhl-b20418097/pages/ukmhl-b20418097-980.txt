THE ORGANS OF VOICE 942 variable appearance when examined in the hving subject with the laryngoscope. It is somewhat depressed and folded upon itself during deglutition. Its anterior or lingual aspect is free above and covered with mucous membrane, which lower down is reflected forward upon the base of the tongue in three folds— one median (which encloses elastic tissue) and two lateral—the glosso-epiglottidean folds. Beneath the mucous membrane the deeper attached portion of this surface is tied to the hyoid bone by a median elastic membrane, named hyo-epiglottidean ligament. A quantity of elastic and fatty tissue, closely blended with this ligament Fig. 525.—Front View of the Cricoid and Arytenoid Cartilages. (Modified from Boiirgery and Jacob.)

This is known as the periglottis (fig. 528). Still lower, the fibro-elastic tissue which forms the thyro-epiglottidean ligament attaches the stalk to the thyroid cartilage. The posterior or laryngeal surface, concavo-convex from above downwards, and concave from side to side, is free and covered with mucous membrane for its whole extent. About its centre it projects backwards to form the cushion of the epiglottis. The lateral margins, which are free above, give attachment belo w to the aryteno- FiG. 526.—Back View of the Cricoid and Arytenoid Cartilages. (Modified from Bourgery and Jacob.)

The CORNICULA LAEYNGIS, or cartilages of Santorini, are the two little cone- shaped yellow elastic cartilages which project backwards and inwards from the summits of the arytenoids, with which they are sometimes directly continuous. A joint, however, is usually present. <|

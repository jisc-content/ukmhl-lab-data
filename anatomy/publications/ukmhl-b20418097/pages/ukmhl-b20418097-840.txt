THE NERVOUS SYSTEM 802 accompanying the middle meningeal artery, and divides into an anterior and a posterior branch. The anterior branch communicates with the meningeal branch of the maxillary division of the fifth nerve, furnishes filaments to the dura mater, and ends in the osseous substance of the great wing of the sphenoid. The posterior branch traverses the petro-squamous suture and ends in the lining membrane of the mastoid cells. (2) The nerve to the internal pterygoid passes under cover of a dense layer of fascia derived from an expansion of the ligamentum pterygo-spinosum, and enters the deep surface of the muscle. Near its commencement this nerve furnishes a motor root to the otic ganglion. The ANTERIOR PORTION of the mandibular division of the fifth nerve supplies the temporal, masseter, and external pterygoid muscles, and gives off a sensory branch.

(1) The temporal nerves, usually two in number, pass between the bone and the upper border of the external pterygoid muscle, and turn upwards around the infra-temporal crest of the sphenoid bone to end in the deep surface of the temporal muscle. The posterior of these two nerves may arise in common with the masseteric nerve. (2) The masseteric nerve passes between the bone and the external pterygoid muscle external to the temporal nerves, and accompanies the masseteric artery through the sigmoid notch of the mandible to be distributed to the masseter.

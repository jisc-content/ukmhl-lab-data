FEMOBAL 615 vein and the profunda vein and artery. Lower down, it lies on the upper portion of the adductor longus muscle. To its outer side is the long saphenous nerve and the nerve to the vastus internus, the anterior crural nerve having in this situation more or less broken up into its components. To its inner side is the femoral vein, which, however, at the apex of Scarpa's triangle, is getting somewhat behind the artery. Fig. 372.â€”The Femoral Artery in Scarpa's Triangle.

AND NERVE TO VA& INTERNUS Vastus internus muscle The superficial femoral varies in length according to the distance that the pro- funda is given off from the common femoral below Poupart's ligament. As a rule, it measures three inches and a half (9 cm.), the common an inch and a half (4 cm.). But the profunda may come off two or more inches below Poupart's ligament, in which case the superficial femoral will be shorter to this extent; or it may come off less than an inch and a half below Poupart's ligament, or even from the external iliac above Poupart's ligament, when the superficial will be longer than normal.

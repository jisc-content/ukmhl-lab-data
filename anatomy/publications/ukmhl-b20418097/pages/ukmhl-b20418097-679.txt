INNOMINATE 641 The left superior intercostal vein—or, more correctly speaking, the lower left superior intercostal vein—-longer than the right, which is described as a tributary of the vena azygos major, receives the intercostal veins from the three or four upper left intercostal spaces except from the first space, and, ascending over the arch of the aorta, opens into the left innominate vein. It usually receives the left Fig. 381a.—The Vena Cava Superior and (From a dissection in St. Bartholomew's THE Innominate Veins. Hospital Museum.)

They do not, however, as a rule, join the internal mammary vein, but unite into a single trunk 1 (figs. 317, 382), which passes over the transverse part of the arch of the aorta, and opens into the lower and anterior part of the left innominate vein.

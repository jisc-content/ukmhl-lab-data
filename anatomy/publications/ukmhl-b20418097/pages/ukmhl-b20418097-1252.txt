SURGICAL AND TOPOGBAPHICAL ANATOMY 1214 with the course of this vessel. The sartorius usually crosses it, three to four inches below Poupart's hgament. The profunda artery arises an inch and a half to two inches below Poupart's hgament. Therefore the incision for tying the femoral in Scarpa's triangle should be about three inches long, in the line of the artery, and begin about three inches below Poupart's ligament, and run over the apex of the triangle. The vein lies below Poupart's ligament, immediately to the inner side of the artery. From this point the vein gets on to a somewhat deeper Fig. 759.—Superficial Dissection of the Front of the Thigh.

From the apex of Scarpa's triangle a depression runs down along the inner aspect of the thigh, corresponding to the groove already mentioned (page 1211) between the vastus internus and the adductors. Along this groove lies the sartorius, and beneath it Hunter's canal. The vein has here got somewhat to the outer side. :'| The long saphenous nerve lies also in the canal, but not in the sheath. The above- j mentioned space terminates at about the junction of the middle and lower thirds of j .the thigh, in the opening in the adductor magnus by which the artery enters the

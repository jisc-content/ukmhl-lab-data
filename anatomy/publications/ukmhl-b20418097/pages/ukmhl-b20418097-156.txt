THE SKELETON 118 TEE CLAVICLE The clavicle is a rod of bone passing from the top of the sternum to the acromion process of the scapula. It presents two curves: an inner, with the convexity directed forwards ; and an outer, the smaller, with the convexity directed backwards. The Fig. 121.—The Left Clavicle. (Superior surface, Anteeioe Peetoralis major Trapezius Posterior Sterno-mastoid clavicle consists, for descriptive purposes, of an outer flattened, and an inner prismatic portion. The outer third has two surfaces and two borders. The superior surface looks directly upwards, and a£fords attachment to the trcqjeziiis muscle posteriorly, and Fig. 122.—The Left Clavicle.

The inferior surface is rough, and at its most posterior part presents the tuberosity of the cla\icle; it overhangs the coracoid process and gives attachment to the conoid ligament. From the tuberosity a ridge, the oblique line, runs outwards and forwards ; to it the trapezoid ligament is attached. The anterior border is thin ; presents often a small prominence, the deltoid tubercle, and gives origin to the deltoid muscle. The posterior border is thick and rounded ; to it the trai^ezius is inserted. The inner two-thirds is prismatic in form; it has three surfaces and three borders. Of these, the anterior surface is convex and presents near the sternal end a rough surface for the sternal portion of the peetoralis major, and a rough surface above for the sterno-cleido-mastoid. Near the middle of the shaft it is smooth and covered by the thin platysma myoides; sometimes a small canal passes

Below, i ** it is attached to the posterior surface of the astragalus from the internal to the I 1* external ligaments. The passage of the flexor longus hallucis tendon over the back I of the joint serves the purpose of a much stronger posterior ligament. • { " The internal lateral or deltoid ligament (fig. 253) is attached superiorly to the' internal malleolus along its lower border, and to its anterior surface superficial! to the anterior ligament; some very strong fibres are fixed to the notch in the lower i ''^ border of the malleolus, and, getting attachment below to the rough depression on; Fig. 253.—Inner View of the Ankle and the Tarsus, showing the Groove .

The ligament j radiates ; the posterior fibres are short, and incline a little backwards to be fixed it to the rough inner surface of the astragalus, close to the superior articular facet, m and into the tubercle to the inner side of the flexor longus pollicis groove. The m fibres next in front are numerous and form a thick and strong mass, filling up the ■!( rough depression on the inner surface of the astragalus, whilst some pass over the! m calcaneo-astragaloid joint to the upper and inner border of the sustentaculum tali, m The fibres, which are connected above with the anterior surface of the malleolus, flu pass downwards and somewhat forwards to be attached to the scaphoid and to the 11 margin of the calcaneo-scaphoid ligament. |» The external lateral ligament (figs. 254, 255) consists of three distinct slips.jfll The anterior fasciculus is ribbon-like and passes from the anterior border of the m external malleolus near the tip to the rough surface of the astragalus in front of the! m

The mternal surface lies between the anterior and ulnar borders. The lower halves of the internal and external surfaces afford origin to the braehialis anticus muscle. The internal surface usually presents, about 5 cm {2") above the ulnar condyle, an elongated rough surface. This is the supracondyloid ridge;

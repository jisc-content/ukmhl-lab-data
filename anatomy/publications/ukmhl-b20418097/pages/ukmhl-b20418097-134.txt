96 THE SKELETON baclnvards, and present a vertical groove which is sometimes so deep as to divide each root, producing four roots. One root only may divide in this way. The second molar differs from the first in the frequent absence of the fifth cusp ; when present it is feebly developed. The roots have a tendency to become confluent. The third molars {wisdom teeth).—The upper third molar resembles in its grinding surface the adjacent molars. The two lingual tubercles are usually blended, and the roots coalesce and taper to a cone. The apex is often bent. The characters of this tooth are very variable. The third lower molar has a larger crown than the corresponding tooth in the upper set; it resembles the adjacent molars and has usually five cusps. It has two roots which may be confluent. The Belations of the Crowns of the Upper and Loioer Teeth to each other.— In a normal condition the upper teeth form a larger arch than the lower. The upper incisors and canines close in front of the loAver ; occasionally they fall upon, but rarely fall behind them. The labial tubercles of the bicuspids and molars Fig. 99 —The Temporary Teeth. INCISORS CANINE MILK MOLARS of the lovv^er jaw are received in the depressions between the labial and lingual tubercles of the upper set of teeth ; hence the labial tubercles of the upper overlap the corresponding tubercles in the lower teeth. In consequence of the difference in width of the crowns of the upper and lower incisors, it happens that in closure of the mouth each tooth impinges upon two teeth. The milk teeth.—These are smaller in number and size than the teeth of the permanent set. The formula is :— l|cl,.| = 20. The temporary teeth are smaller than their successors ; the enamel of the crown terminates in a thick edge ; and the tubercles on the crowns of the molars are less regular and pronounced. The incisors are similar to those of the permanent set, but the canines have shorter and broader crowns than their successors.

OBGANS OF SPECIAL SENSE 898 in its axis. They are accompanied throughout by a special process of the pial sheath, which forms a fibrous cord in the centre of the nerve. On reaching the eyeball, the dural sheath is joined by the arachnoid, and turns away from the nerve to be continued into the outer two-thirds of the sclerotic. Similarly the pial sheath also here leaves the nerve, its greater part running into the inner third of the sclerotic, while a few of its fibres join the choroid ; the inter- FiG. 487.—Transverse Section through Optic Nerve, showing the Relations of ITS Sheaths and Connective-Tissue Framework.

FRAMEWORK f vaginal space consequently ends abruptly in the sclerotic around the nerve-entrance. In this locality the connective-tissue framework of the nerve becomes thicker and closer in its meshwork, and has been already alluded to as the lamina cribrosa. It is formed by processes passing out from the central fibrous cord at its termination, and by processes passing inwards from the pial sheath, sclerotic, and choroid. It does not pass straight across the nerve, but follows the curve of the surrounding sclerotic, being therefore slightly convex backwards. The nerve-trunk here quickly becomes

THE MUSCLES 474 separated by a small interval from the sternal head, corresponding to a part of the sterno-clavicular joint, from which it sometimes receives a few fibres of origin ; when they have joined, it passes beneath the sternal head to its insertion, which is chiefly the lower part of the outer surface of the mastoid process. The whole insertion in front is composed of short tendinous fibres, and behind of a thin aponeurosis. As the whole muscle has a very wide range of action, nearly the whole length of its fibres is fleshy. The sternal head is a little longer than the other, but has little if any more range of movement. Hence it is tendinous. Nerve-supply—(1) The spinal accessory nerve, which, while traversing the deep surface of the muscle at the junction of its upper and middle thirds, sends Fig. 314.—Anterior and Lateral Cervical Muscles. filaments to it; (2) the cervical plexus through the anterior primary branches ( the second and third cervical nerves, which enter the upper part of its deep surfac Action.—(1) To flex laterally the head and neck, so as to draw the side of tl head towards the shoulder. (2) To rotate the face towards the opposite side. Of tl two parts of the muscle, the cleido-mastoid portion is more concerned in later;! flexion, the sterno-mastoid in rotation. The combination of all these movemen I may be very well seen in a case of wry-neck, which results from the permane: contraction of this muscle.

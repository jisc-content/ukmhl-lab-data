1164 SUBGICAL AND TOPOGBAPHIGAL ANATOMY layers below; (c) persistence of the original process of peritoneum; {d) a long mesentery or suspensory ligament of the intestines. Mr. Lockwood has shown that the mesentery is relatively larger in infancy, and that there is a rapid decrease after the second year. In adults its length is about eight inches, and any lengthening of the mesentery beyond this point is likely to be combined with a protuberant belly. He shows further, with regard to the range of descent or the excursus of the intestines, that it is extremely rare to find a mesentery so short, or attached so high, as to prevent the intestines escaping or being drawn from the abdomen. The long mesentery of infancy and childhood is usually associated with con- FiG. 709.—Transversalis Abdominis and Sheath of Eectus. • Serratus magnus Lumbar fascia siderable downward descent of the intestine ; and in the adult it is quite common to find that the small intestines will pass an inch and a half beyond the right crural arch, one inch beyond the pubes, and up to the left crural arch. (3) Stretching of the abdominal walls by pregnancies, etc. (4) Increase of the volume and weight of the parts within : e.g. omentum by deposit of fat in it. (5) Sex. Thus, men have larger inguinal rings. Women have a larger femoral arch, and one less well filled in by muscles, and with less strong fasciae meeting, e.g. iliac and transversalis. (6) Cough, asthma, bronchitis, habitual fretfulhess or crying.

1240 SUBGICAL AND TOPOGBAPHICAL AX ATOMY ' I In Lisfranc's, or Hey's, or the tarso-metatarsal amputation, the bases of the fifth and first metatarsals must be defined. The first of these can always be detected, even in a stout or swollen foot, on the inner side ; the joint between the ! internal cuneiform and the first metatarsal bone lies an inch and a half in front j of the scaphoid tubercle. In opening the joint between the second metatarsal and \ the middle cuneiform, its position (the base of the former bone projecting upwards on | Fig. 784.â€”Superficial Nerves in the Sole of the Foot. (Ellis.) to a level one-third or one-fourth of an inch above the others), and the way in which it is locked in between its fellows and the cuneiform bones, must be remembered. In marking out the flaps for the amputation of the great toes, the large size of the head of the first metatarsal, and the importance of leaving this so as not to diminish its supporting power and the treading width of the foot, and thus of marking out flaps sufiiciently long and large, must be borne in mind. In amputation of the other toes, the line of their metatarso-phalangeal joints lies a full inch above the web.

THE SCAPULA 121 by a prominent lip of bone, the spine. The part above the spine is the supra- spinous fossa, a,ncl lodges the swpra-sijinatus muscle. The hollow below the spine is the infraspinous fossa; it is larger than the supraspinous fossa, and is limited inferiorly by a ridge which runs from the glenoid fossa backwards to join the \ posterior border a short distance above the inferior angle. To this oblique ridge the stout aponeurosis is attached which separates the teres major and teres minor muscles from the infra-spmatus muscle. The infraspinatus arises from the inner two-thirds of the infraspinous fossa, and overlaps the outer third. The supra- and infra-spinous fossae communicate with each other round the outer end of the spine ; this part corresponds to the neck of the scapula, and the groove is the scapular notch; it transmits the suprascapular nerve and artery from one fossa to the other. The surface of bone below the oblique ridge presents two, and occasion- ally three, facets for muscles: the long narrow outer one is for the origin of the teres minor; this is crossed near its middle by a groove for the dorsal artery of the scapula. The second facet is broader, and gives attachment to the teres major muscle. In bones from a muscular subject the third facet, quite at the inferior angle, is for a few fibres of the latissimus dorsi.

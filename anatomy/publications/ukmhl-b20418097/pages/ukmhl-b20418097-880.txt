842 THE NEBVOUS SYSTEM and, approaching the radial artery at an acute angle, runs parallel to the outer side of that vessel in the middle third of the forearm. It then parts company with the artery by bending backwards on the deep surface of the tendon of the supinator longus. It then pierces the deep fascia and is directed towards the back of the wrist, where it divides into its terminal branches. One of these, the palmar cutaneous of the radial nerve, supplies the outer part of the thenar eminence; two others supply the dorsum of the thumb, a fourth branch runs along the radial side of the index finger, a fifth divides to supply the adjacent side of the index and middle fingers, and a sixth branch communicates with the dorsal branch of the ulnar nerve to supply the adjacent side of the middle and ring fingers. Nerve-supply of the dorsal integument to the hand.â€”It will be seen, by the foregoing description of the radial and ulnar nerves, that the thumb, index, and half the middle finger are supplied by the radial; the little and half the ring finger by the ulnar ; and the adjacent sides of the ring and middle fingers by both radial and ulnar nerves. The distance to which these nerves extend on the digits is somewhat variable, but the following is the

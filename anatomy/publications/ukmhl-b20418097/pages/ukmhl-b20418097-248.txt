210 ! THE ARTICULATIONS sacrum, so that in males in whom the average pelvic obliquity is a little greater, the average sacro-vertebral angle is considerably less than in females. The sacro-vertebral angle in the male shows that there is a greater and more sudden change in direction at the sacro-vertebral union than in the female. Apart of this change in direction is due to the greater thickness in the anterior part of the intervertebral substance between the last lumbar vertebra and the sacrum. Owing to the greater thickness of the intervertebral disc here than elsewhere, the movements permitted at this joint are very free, being freer than those between any two lumbar vertebrae. As the diameter of the two contiguous bones is less antero-posteriorly than laterally, the forward and backward motions are much freer than the lateral ones. The backward and forward motions take place Fig. 206.â€”Anterior View of the Pelvis. every time the sitting is exchanged for the standing position, and the standing for the sitting posture; in rising, the back is extended on the sacrum at the sacro- lumbar union ; in sitting down it is flexed. The articular processes provide for the gliding movement incidental to the extension, flexion, and lateral movements ; they also allow some horizontal move- ment, necessary for the rotation of the spine on the pelvis, or pelvis on the spine. The inferior articular processes of the fifth differ considerably from the inferioi processes in the rest of the lumbar vertebrae, and in direction they resemble some- what those of the cervical vertebra ; while the superior articular processes oi the sacrum differ in a similar degree from the superior processes of the lumbal vertebrae. This difference allows for the freer rotation which occurs at this joint.

THE VEINS 676 union with the superior mesenteric to form the vena porta, in front of the inferior vena cava. Tributaries.—It receives veins corresponding to the vasa brevia arteries from the cardiac end of the stomach, the left g^astro-epiploic vein, veins from the pancreas, and the inferior mesenteric vein. The left gastro-epiploic vein accompanies the left gastro-epiploic artery. It runs from right to left along the greater curvature of the stomach, receives branches from the stomach and omentum, and opens into the commencement of the splenic vein. The inferior mesenteric vein begins at the rectum in the superior and middle hsemorrhoidal veins. It passes out of the pelvis with the inferior mesenteric artery; Fig. 394.—The Inferior Mesenteric Vein. (The colon is turned up, and the small intestines are drawn to the right side.) Middle cohc arter Inferior 'pancrea- tico-duodenal artery Superior mesenteric artei i Right colic arterii Abdominal aorta Right common Middle sacral artery and vein Left colic artery Inferior mesenteric vein Inferior mesen- teric artery Left colic artery Infeiior mesen- teric artery Sigmoid artery Superior hoemorrho idol artery but, after receiving the veins corresponding with the sigmoid and left colic branches of that vessel, it leaves the artery and runs upwards on the psoas to the left of the aorta and behind the peritoneum. On approaching the pancreas it turns slightly inwards, and passes obliquely behind that gland to join the splenic vein just before the latter unites with the superior mesenteric to form the vena porta. THE VEINS OF THE PELVIS The veins of the pelvis, with the exception of the middle sacral vein which terminates in the left common iliac vein, open into the internal iliac vein. Under the head of pelvic veins are included all of those corresponding to the branches of

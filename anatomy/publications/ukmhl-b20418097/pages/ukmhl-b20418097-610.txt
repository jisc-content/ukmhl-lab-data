572 THE ABTEBIES lies upon the bone and can therefore be easily pressed against it, that the pulse is usually felt. On its outer side it has, throughout the whole of its course, the supinator longus or humero-radialis muscle, the guide to the artery in ligature, and the external vena comes ; in its middle third, the radial nerve as well. In its lower third the radial nerve is to its outer side, but separated from it by the supinator longus and fascia. Fig. 356.—Diagram of the Eelation of the Arteries of the Forearm TO THE Bones.

Variations in the Badial Artery in the Forearm (A) The radial artery may be given off from the brachial higher than usual, or from the axillary artery. (B) It may arise from the brachial lower than the bend of the elbow, but a low division of the brachial is rare. (C) It may run superficial to the fascia of the forearm. (D) It may cross over, instead of under, the extensors of the thumb. (E) It

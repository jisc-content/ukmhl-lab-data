THE SCAPULA 123 Muscles.—The following are attached to the scapula Supra-spinatus. Infra-spinatus. Subscapularis. Teres major. Teres minor. Omo-hyoid. Pectoralis minor. Serratus magnus. Deltoid. Ligaments :— Conoid. Trapezoid. Costo-coracoid membrane. Costo-coracoid ligament. Capsular (acromio-clavicular). Coraco-acromial. Suprascapular (transverse). Latissimus dorsi. Trapezius. Ehomboideus major. Ehomboideus minor. Levator anguli scapulas. Biceps. Coraco-brachialis. Triceps (long head). Capsular (shoulder-joint). Coraco-humeral. Gleno-humeral. Glenoid. Ehomboid loop. Spino-glenoid. Inferior transverse. Blood-supply.—The scapula is supplied by the following arteries :—Twigs from the subscapular artery and from the subscapular branch of the suprascapular enter the bone on the anterior surface. The dorsal artery of the scapula distributes branches in the infraspinous, whilst the suprascajpular artery supplies the supra- spinous fossa, the spine, the glenoid fossa, and sends branches into the infraspinous fossa. The acromion is supplied by branches of the acromio-thoracic artery. Fig. 125.—Ossification of the Scapula. The Scapula at the thu-d year, showing the coracoid element. (Anterior view.) The Scapula at birth. (Anterior view.) Ossification.—^The scapula is ossified from seven centres. Two may be con- sidered as primary, and the remainder as secondary nuclei. The centre for the body appears in a plate of cartilage near the neck of the scapula about the eighth week of intra-uterine life, and quickly forms a triangular plate of bone, from which the spine appears as a slight ridge about the middle of the third month. At birth the glenoid fossa and part of the scapular neck, the acromion, coracoid, and vertebral border are cartilaginous. During the first year a nucleus appears for the coracoid.

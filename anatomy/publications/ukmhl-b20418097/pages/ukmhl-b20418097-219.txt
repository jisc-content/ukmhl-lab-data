THE METATABSUS 181 The head of the bone has two deep grooves on the plantar surface for the samoids developed in the flexor hrevis hallucis muscle. Muscles.—Peroneus longus ; tibialis anticus ; first dorsal interosseous. Blood-supply.—The nutrient vessel enters the shaft on the fibular side, and is irected towards the head of the bone. Fig. 186.—The Third (Left) Metatarsal. METATARSAL Fig. 187.—The Fourth (Left) Metatarsal. FIBULAR OR OUTER SIDE FACET FOR FIFTH METATARSAL The SECOND METATARSAL is the longest of the series. Its base is prolonged backwards to occupy the space between the internal and external cuneiform bones ; this leads to the formation of a small facet at the superior angle on the tibial side where it articulates with the internal cuneiform. It occasionally presents a small

THE NOSE In the floor the openings leading into the anterior palatine canal are closed. The small cul-de-sac already described indicates their position. The superior meatus has but a single opening, which leads into the posterior ethmoidal cells. The spheno-palatine foramen is entirely covered by membrane. The middle meatus presents the orifice of the antrum. In front of this and hidden by the overhanging turbinal bone is the curved gutter-like cell leading [upwards from the fore part of the meatus to the frontal sinus, the infundibulum. It receives below the orifice of the middle, and above that of the anterior ethmoidal cells. In the inferior meatus is the orifice of the nasal duct. The opening is under cover of the fore part of the inferior turbinal bone. The mucous membrane - is arranged around the opening in a circular valve, which is sometimes double, 'known as the valve of Hasner (page 906). The nerves—The olfactory or special nerves of smell, the filaments of which pass through the foramina in the cribriform plate of the ethmoid bone, lie for some distance in the grooves of the bony walls before terminating in the Schneiderian membrane. Those which supply the septum ramify in its upper third, whilst those which reach the outer walls are distributed in two groups—a posterior, to supply the membrane covering the superior turbinal bone, and an anterior to ramify in the membrane over the middle turbinal bone and the smooth surface of the ethmoid in front of this. In addition to the special nerves of smell, the cavity is supplied with nerves of' common sensation derived from the fifth pair. The nasal branch of the ophthalmic supplies the front and upper part of the septum and also the outer wall of the nasal fossa.

THE HIP-BONE 151 xternus. To its inner surface the crus penis is attached ; it also gives origin to he transversus perinei, the erector p)enis, and the obturator internus. The pubes consists of a body and two rami. The body, quadrilateral in shape, s continuous with the ramus of the ischium by means of a flattened process term^ed he descending ramus. The outer surface of the body gives origin to the adductor ongus. The adductor brevis, the gracilis, and the obturator externus arise from the Fig. 155.â€”The Left Hip-bone. (Posterior view.)

A small portion of the adductor magnus also arises from the descending ramus. The posterior surface of the body and that of the descending ramus is continuous with the corresponding surface of the ramus of the ischium, and affords attachment to the levator ani and obturator internus. The posterior surface of the descending ramus gives origin to the com- pressor urethrcB and a part of the erector penis, the crus penis, and the obturator

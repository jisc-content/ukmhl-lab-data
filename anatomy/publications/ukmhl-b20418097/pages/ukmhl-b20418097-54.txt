THE SKELETON 16 in the anterior sacral foramina, four pairs in all, which are the intervertebral foramina of the sacral vertebras, and transmit the anterior divisions of the first four sacral nerves. The upper two are also traversed by the lateral sacral arteries. The bone immediately outside the foramina corresponds to the costal processes, and the portion formed by the second, third, and fourth sacral vertebrae gives origin to the injriformis muscle. The lateral part of the fifth sacral vertebra gives partial insertion to the coceygeus. The posterior surface is strongly convex and rough. The middle line is occupied by four tubercles representing the suppressed spinous processes. Of these the first is the largest, the second and third may be confluent, and the fourth is often absent. The bone on each side of the spines is formed by the ankylosed laminae. In the fourth sometimes, but always in the fifth, the lamina fail to meet in the middle line, and this leaves a gap, the hiatus sacralis. The median borders of this hiatus are prolonged downAvards as rounded processes, the sacral cornua, to which the posterior sacro-coccygeal ligaments are attached. External to the laminae is a second series of small prominences : these are the articular processes. The first pair are large for the last lumbar vertebra, the second and third are small, and the fourth and fifth are inconspicuous. Immediately external to the articular processes are the posterior sacral foramina, four on each side; they are smaller than the anterior, and give exit to the posterior divisions of the first four sacral nerves. External to the foramina there are five eminences on each side, representing the transverse processes. The first pair are large and conspicuous ; the second form part of the articular surface Fig. 17.â€”The Sacrum and Coccyx. (Anterior view.)

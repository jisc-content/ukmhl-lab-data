VESICAL— UTEBINE 605 means of descending arteries which pass through the prostatic plexus of veins, but outside the capsule of the prostate, and with the inferior haemorrhoidal branches of the internal pudic. At times one of these prostatic branches is of large size, and supplies certain of the parts normally supplied by the internal pudic. It is then known as the accessory pudic. {h) Branches to the vesiculse seminales ; and (c) branches (in the female) to the vagina. (See Vaginal Artery.) The artery of the vas deferens sometimes arises from the inferior vesical, instead of from the superior vesical. I 3. THE MIDDLE H^MOEEHOIDAL AKTERY The middle haemorrhoidal or the middle rectal artery, variable in its origin, perhaps most commonly arises from the anterior division of the internal iliac along with the inferior vesical. It runs inwards to the sides of the middle portion of jthe rectum, dividing into branches which anastomose above with the superior haemorrhoidal derived from the inferior mesenteric, and below with the inferior hfemorrhoidal derived from branches of the pudic. Its corresponding vein termi- nates in the inferior mesenteric vein. j 4. THE UTERINE ARTERY i The uterine artery arises from the anterior branch of the internal iliac close jto or in conjunction with the middle haemorrhoidal or inferior vesical. It runs down- wards and inwards in the pelvic connective tissue, crossing the ureter about half an Fig, 370.—Scheme of the Ovarian and Uterine and Vaginal Arteries.

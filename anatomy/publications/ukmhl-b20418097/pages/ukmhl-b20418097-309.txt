273 THE KNEE JOINT ,nd fully an inch (2*5 cm.) long ; the posterior or lower edge is half the length, ,nd is attached to the crucial ligaments above, but is free below. Passing backwards from the capsule on each side of the patella is a prominent rescentic fold formed by reduplications of the synovial membrane—these are the ,lar ligaments (fig. 248). Their free margins are concave and thin, and are lost telow in the ligamentum mucosum. There is a slight fossa above and another )elow each ligament. ^^iG. 249.—Vertical Section of the Knee Joint in the Antero-posterior Direction* Fatty tissue- Opening in synovial membrane behind crucial ligament leading into inner half of joint Synovial membrane, reflected oflF crueials Cut end of anterior crucial ligament Posterior crucial ligament Ligament of Winslow Muscular fibres of quadriceps extensor Extension of synovial sac of knee upon femur Tendon of quadriceps ex- tensor, forming fibrous capsule of joint Pre-patellar bursa. CONDYLE OF FEMUR (INNER) Ligamentum mucosum Fatty tissue between ligamentum patellae and synovial sac Bursa beneath'.ligamentum patellae The arterial supply is derived from the anastomotica femoris ; the superior and inferior internal and external articular; the azygos articular; the descending branch of the external circumflex ; the anterior recurrent branch from the anterior tibial; and the posterior tibial recurrent. j The nerve-supply comes from the great sciatic, anterior crural, and obturator sources. The great sciatic gives off the internal and external popliteal; the mternal popliteal sends two, sometimes three branches—one with the azygos artery ; one

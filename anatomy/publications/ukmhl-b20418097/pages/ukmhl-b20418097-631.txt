(1) The inferior pancreatico-duodenal, arising from the superior mesenteric as that vessel emerges from the contiguous margins of the pancreas and transverse duodenum, and, crossing behind the superior mesenteric vein, courses upwards and to the right between, the head of the pancreas and the duodenum, beneath the ascending layer of the transverse meso-colon, to anastomose with the superior pancreatico-duodenal, which is given off from the gastro-duodenal, and descends in a like situation beneath the ascending layer of the transverse meso-colon. Fig. 366.—The Superior Mesenteric Artery and Vein. fThe colon is turned up, and the small intestines are drawn over to the left side;) (2) The middle colic, arising from the concavity of the superior mesenteric a little below the pancreas, enters the transverse meso-colon, and divides into two branches—one of which passes to the left and anastomoses with the ascending branch of the left colic; the other, winding downwards and to the right, anastomoses with the ascending branch of the right colic. (3) The right colic—sometimes given off as a common trunk either with the former branch or with the ileo-colic—passes to the right behind the peritoneum to the back of the ascending colon, where it divides into an ascending branch, which anastomoses with the descending branch of the middle colic, and a descending branch which anastomoses with the ascending or colic branch of the ileo-colic.

1052 THE UBINAIiY ORGANS known as tho ureter proper. In sonio cases, however, it can scarcely be said to exist as a dihitation. Under ordinary circumstances it is flattened from licfore backwards, its anterior and posterior walls being in contact, and its channel represented by a fissure. It is in relation behind with the posterior lip of the hilum, from which it is separated by more or less adipose tissue continuous with the fatty capsule, and occasionally hy an irregular branch of the renal artery. The renal vein and artery imbedded in fat lie in front, and anterior to these structures are situated the descending portion of the duodenum on the right side, and the pancreas on the left. The ureter extends from the termination of the pelvis to the bladder, running in a kind of lymph-space between the laminfe of the subperitoneal tissue. It is a tube of about a sixth of an inch in diameter when distended, and is fairly uniform in si/e, except about two inches below the kidney where a slight constric- tion is usually found (Bruce Clark). Its length is variously stated, but the average in the male adult may be taken as about twelve inches. The excessive estimates sometimes given depend upon the untrustworthy indications afforded by admeasure- ment after the removal of the structure} from the })ody. Fio.

1244 SURGICAL AND TOPOGBAPHICAL ANATOMY astragalus, viz. only two bones in order to secure solidity, and to enable the calf- muscles to act directly upon the heel, without any of that loss of power which would be brought about by many moving joint-surfaces. (2) Anterior pillar : Here there are many bones and joints to provide {a) elastic springiness, and (b) width. This anterior pillar may again be divided into two : (a) An inner pillar, very elastic, consisting of the astragalus, scaphoid, three cuneiforms, and three inner metatarsals, (b) An outer, formed by the cuboids and two outer metatarsals. This is stronger and less elastic, and tends to buttress up the inner pillar. Key- stone : This is represented by the summit of the trochlear surface of the astragalus. Fig. 789.—Fourth Layer of the Muscles of the Sole. Peroneus longus- Plantar interossei It differs from the keystones in ordinary arches in the following important j particulars (Humphry): (a) in not being wedge-shaped; (b) in not being so | placed as to support and receive support from the two halves of the arch : in front | the astragalus does fulfil this condition by fitting into the scaphoid ; behind, it j overlaps the calcaneum without at all supporting it; (c) this arch and the support | of its keystone largely depend on ligaments and tendons; (d) it is a mobile keystone: to give it chances of shifting its pressure, and so obtaining rest, its equilibrium is j not always maintained in one position. | (B) Transverse arch (fig. 783).—This is best marked about the centre of the foot, | j j \

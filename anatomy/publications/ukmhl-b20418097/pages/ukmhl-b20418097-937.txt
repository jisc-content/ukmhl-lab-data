OPTIC NEBVE 899 reduced to one-half its former diameter, the fibres losing their medullary sheath, and being continued henceforward as mere axis cylinders. Apart from the conse- quent loss of bulk, this histological change may be readily recognised macroscopi- cally in a longitudinal section of the nerve, its aspect here changing from opaque white to semi-translucent grey. The part of the nerve within the lamina cribrosa has already been seen in our ophthalmoscopic examination of the living eye. The optic nerve is mainly nourished by fine vessels derived from those of the pial sheath, which run into the substance of the nerve in the processes above mentioned. In front of the entrance of the central retinal artery this vessel aids to some extent in the blood-supply of the axial part of the nerve.

I Arteries.—The main blood-supply is afforded by the ophthalmic artery, a branch of the internal carotid, which gains the orbit through the optic canal, where it lies beneath and to the temporal side of the nerve. On entering the orbit it ascends, and passes obliquely over the optic nerve to the inner wall of the orbit; in this early part of its course it gives off most of its branches, which vary much in their jmanner of origin and also in their course. The arteries of the orbit are remarkable I for their tortuous course, for their delicate walls, and for their loose attachment to the [surrounding tissues. The ophthalmic artery gives off special branches in the orbit |to the lachrymal gland, the muscles, the retina (through the optic nerve), and the eyeball, as well as to the meninges, the ethmoidal cells, and the nasal mucous membrane. Twigs from all the different branches go to supply the fat, fascia, and ordinary nerves of the orbit. Branches which leave the orbit anteriorly ramify on the forehead and nose, and also go to the supply of the eyelids and the tear-passages. 3 M 2

THE ORGANS OF DIGESTION 1030 The upper part becomes the stomach ; the bowel immediately beyond forms th duodenum ; then follow the small intestine ; and lastly the colon and rectum. The point of separation of the small bowel from the colon is indicated by th appearance of the caecum. Fig. 592.—Diagram of the Primitive Alimentary Canal. (A: a indicates the vitello-intestinal duct; b points to the future position of the caecum, It will be understood also that the upper part of the mesial peritoneal fold is call( the meso-gaster (m-g, fig. 593); the next part the meso-duodenum (m-d) ; and tl succeeding portions, in order, the mesentery, the meso-colon, and the meso-rectu (fig. 593, MES, M-c, m-r). The stomach becomes more distinctly marked ; the tul below lengthens and forms an intestinal loop, which in the embryo projects beyoi the site of the future umbilicus, taking the mesentery with it. Fig. 593.—Diagram of the Primitive Alimentary Canal. This elementary condition of the intestinal canal persists in certain fully dev-elo; animals. As an example may be taken the alimentary canal of the salamander, depicted in fig. 594. In this figure the viscera are shown undisturbed. In fig. 5i the peritoneum has been drawn forwards so as to show the parts in one medi: plane, and well represents the simple arrangement. In many mammals among tj

252 THE ARTICULATIONS hand enjoys a greater range of these movements than is permitted at the wrist joint alone. At the wrist, extension is more free than flexion; but this is balanced by the greater freedom of flexion than of extension at the medio-carpal joint, and by flexion at the carpo-metacarpal joint, so that on the whole the range of flexion of the hand is greater than that of extension.

A slight amount of lateral motion accompanied by a limited degree of rotation also takes place ; this rotation consists in the head of the magnum and the superior and outer angle of the unciform bone rotating in the socket formed by the three bones of the upper row, and in a gliding forwards and backwards of the trapezium and trapezoid upon the scaphoid. In addition to the ligaments, the undulating outline and the variety of shapes of the apposed facets render this joint very secure.

THE METATABSUS 183 arge facet for the fourth metatarsal. The plantar aspect of the base has a jhallow groove which lodges the abductor minimi digiti. I Muscles:— Third plantar interosseous. Peroneus tertius. Fourth dorsal interosseous. Abductor ossis metatarsi quinti. Peroneus brevis. Flexor brevis minimi digiti. Blood-supply.—The nutrient artery enters on the tibial side of the shaft and s towards the base. Ossification.—Each metatarsal ossifies from two centres. The primary nucleus or the diaphysis appears in the eighth week of embryonic life in the middle of the [cartilaginous metatarsal. At birth, each extremity is represented by cartilage, and that at the proximal end is ossified by extension from the primary nucleus, except in the case of the first metatarsal. For this, a nucleus appears in the third year. The distal ends of the four outer metatarsals are ossified by secondary nuclei I which make their appearance about the third year. Very frequently an epiphysis lis found at the distal end of the first metatarsal as well as at its base. The shafts J and epiphyses consolidate at the twentieth year. The sesamoids belonging to the \ flexor brevis hallucis begin to ossify about the fifth year. THE PHALANGES There are fourteen phalanges to each foot. The hallux has two, and the remaining toes three each. They are usually distinguished as first, second, and third. The last are sometimes called the ungual phalanges, because they support the nail. Fig. 189.—The Phalanges of the Middle Toe. THIRD, TERMINAL OR UNGUAL PHALANX SECOND PHALANX FIRST PHALANX The phalanges of the first row have narrow laterally compressed shafts, rounded on the dorsal and concave on the plantar aspects. The bases have deep glenoid fossae for the convex heads of the metatarsals with which they articulate ; whilst the heads have trochlear surfaces for the bases of the second phalanges. The phalanges of the second row are stunted, insignificant bones. Their

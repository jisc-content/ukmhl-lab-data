289 MOVEMENTS AT THE TARSAL JOINTS I the tarsal and metatarsal branches of the clorsalis pedis, and from the plantar arteries. [ The nerve-supply of the medio-tarsal joints is from the external division of I the anterior tibial, and occasionally from the musculo-cutaneous or external j plantar. I The movements which take place at the medio-tarsal joints are mainly flexion [and extension, with superadded lateral and rotatory movements. Flexion at these ijomts is simultaneous with extension of the ankle, and vice versa. Flexion and extension do not take place upon a transverse, but round an oblique axis which passes from within outwards, and somewhat backwards and downwards through the astragalus and calcaneum. Combined with flexion and extension is also some rotatory motion round an antero-posterior axis which turns the inner or outer border of the foot upwards. There is also a fair amount of lateral motion whereby the foot can be inclined inwards (i.e. adducted) or outwards (i.e. abducted). These movements of the medio-tarsal joint occur in conjunction with those of the ankle and calcaneo-astragaloid joints. Eotation at the calcaneo-astragaloid joint is, however, round a vertical axis in a horizontal plane, and so turns the toes inwards or outwards ; whereas at the medio-tarsal union the axis is antero- posterior and the inner or outer edge of the foot is turned upwards. Gliding at the calcaneo-astragaloid joint elevates or depresses the edge of the foot, while at the U

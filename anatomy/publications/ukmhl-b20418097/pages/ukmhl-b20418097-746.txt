SECTION V. THE NERVOUS SYSTEM By H. ST. JOHN BROOKS, M.D., B.Ch., D.Sc, B.A. UNIVERSITY ANATOMIST AND EXAMINEE IN ANATOMY IN 'J HE UNH^EHSITY OF DUBLIN ; SURGEON TO SIR PATRICK dun's HOSPITAL. NEUROLOGY NEUROLOGY is that branch of Anatomy which deals with the nervous system. It treats of the brain and spinal cord, constituting the cerebro-spinal axis or central nervous system; and the cranial and spinal nerves, or peripheral nervous system. The sympathetic system is" to be regarded as an appendage of the latter, although, as has been recently shown, there is reason to believe that it originates independently. The study of the nervous system (of the brain in particular) is greatly facilitated by a knowledge of its mode of development and by Fig. 401.â€”Diagrammatic Sagittal Section of a Vertebrate Brain.

It is not our purpose to enter into these subjects here ; but an examination of the two diagrams (figs. 401, 402), which are based upon Embryology and Comparative Anatomy, will familiarise the student with the plan upon which the brain is laid down, and form a key to the complicated structure of the adult human brain. At an early period of embryonic life the cerebro-spinal axis consists simply of a thin walled tube, the neural tube, which becomes enlarged at the cephahc end of the body. Constrictions appear on this enlarged cephalic end, dividing it into three vesicles, an anterior, a middle, and a posterior. The ventricles of the brain are

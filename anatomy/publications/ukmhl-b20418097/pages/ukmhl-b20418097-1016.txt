The hlood of the superior vena cava passes from the right auricle into the righi â– ventricle, and thence through the pulmonary artery (a small portion only reachinJ the lungs) and ductus arteriosus to the descending aorta. Through this trunk if is conducted to the lower half of the body as well as to the placenta through thJ umbilical arteries. From these parts it is returned to the right auricle by thd Fig. 558. -Anterior View of Heart and Great Vessels of Fcetus, the Anterior Chest Wall being removed and the Heart Sac opened.

The current which passes through the inferior cava only in a slight degre mingles with that of the superior cava, as it is guided directly through the forame: ovale by means of the Eustachian valve into the left auricle. This cavity alsi receives a small quantity of blood (Avhich has traversed the lungs) through ih pulmonary veins. From the left auricle the blood current passes into the lef ventricle, and thence through the aorta to the head and neck and the uppe extremities.

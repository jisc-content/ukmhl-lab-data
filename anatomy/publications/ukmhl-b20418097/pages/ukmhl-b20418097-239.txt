OF VERTEBRAL COLUMN 201 1. THE ARTICULATIONS OF THE VEETEBRAL COLUMN There are two distinct sets of articulations in the vertebral column :— {a) Those between the bodies and intervertebral discs which form amphi- arthrodial joints. [h] Those between the articular processes which form arthrodial joints. The ligaments which unite the various parts may also be divided into two jets, viz.—immediate, or those that bind together parts which are in contact; and ntermediate, or those that bind together parts which are not in contact. Immediate. (ft) Those between the bodies and discs. {h) Those between the articular processes. Intermediate. (c) Those between the laminae. [a] Those between the spinous processes. (e) Those between the transverse processes. {a) The Aeticulations of the Bodies of the Vertebrze Class.—A V ip h ia; •thro sis. The ligaments which unite the bodies of the vertebras are :— Intervertebral discs. Anterior common. Short lateral ligaments. Posterior common. Fig. 200.—Horizontal Section through an Intervertebral Disc AND THE corresponding EiBS, The intervertebral substances (figs. 196 and 200) are tough, but elastic and compressible discs of composite structure, which serve as the chief bond of union between the vertebrae. They are twenty-three in number, and are interposed between the bodies of all the vertebrge from the axis to the sacrum. Similar substances are found between the segments of the sacrum and coccyx, but they

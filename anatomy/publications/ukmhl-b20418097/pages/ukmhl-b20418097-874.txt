836 THE NERVOUS SYSTEM ulnar nerve. It passes downwards with a slight inclination backwards under cover of the deep fascia on the inner side of the arm. Near the bend of the elbow it turns somewhat sharply backwards to supply the integument which covers the olecranon process. As it traverses the axilla, the nerve of Wrisberg communicates wdth the intercosto-humeral nerve, forming one or sometimes two loops. In its course down the arm it gives a few fine twigs to the integument. (3) The internal cutaneous is a branch of the inner cord, its fibres being ulti- mately derived from the eighth cervical and first thoracic nerves. At its origin it lies on the inner side of the'axillary artery, but it soon passes on to the anterior surface of that vessel, and bears the same relation to the brachial artery in the upper two- FiG. 456.- -DlSTRIBUTION OF CUTANEOUS NeRVES ON THE ANTERIOR AND POSTERIOR Aspects of the Superior Extremity.

It then pierces the deep fascia in company with the basilic vein, and divides into an anterior and a posterior branch. Previous to its division it gives off a twig which pierces the deep fascia, and supplies the integument of the upper and inner part of the arm. (a) The anterior branch is larger than the posterior, and divides at acute angles into several twigs, some of which pass in front of and some behind the median basilic vein, and then run down the forearm to supply the integuments covering its anterior and internal aspect as far as the wrist, (b) The posterior branch passes downwards and backwards in front of the internal condyle of the humerus, and divides into branches which supply the skin on the postero- external aspect of the forearm. 1 il

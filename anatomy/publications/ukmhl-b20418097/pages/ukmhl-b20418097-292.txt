256 THE ABTICULATIONS 10. THE METACARPO-PHALANGEAL JOINTS (a) The Metacaepo-phalangeal Joints of the Four Inner Fingers Class.—Diarthrosis. Subdivision.—Ginglymus. In these joints the cup-shaped extremity of the base of the first phalanx fits on to the rounded head of the metacarpal bone, and is united by the following ligaments : — Lateral. Glenoid. The glenoid ligament (fig. 236) is a fibro-cartilaginous plate which seems more intended to increase the depth of the phalangeal articular facet in front, than to Fig. 236.—Anterior and Posterior View of Ligaments of the Fingers. unite the two bones. It is much more firmly attached to the margin of the phalanx than to the metacarpal bone, being only loosely connected with the palmar surface of the latter by some loose areolar tissue which covers in the synovial sac, here prolonged upon the surface of the bone some little distance. Laterally, it is connected with the lateral ligaments and the transverse metacarpal ligament. It corresponds to the sesamoid bones of the thumb ; a sesamoid bone sometimes exists at the inner border of the joint of the little finger. The lateral ligaments (figs. 235, 236) are strong and firmly connect the bones with one another ; each is attached above to the lateral tubercle, and to a depression in front of the tubercle, of the metacarpal bone. From this point the fibres spread widely as they descend on the side of the base of the phalanx ; the anterior fibres

THE NEBVOUS SYSTEM 750 section varies in different parts of its course. Thus, at its commencement, under the posterior commissure, it has the form of an isosceles triangle with the apex directed downwards. Below the anterior quadrigeminal bodies it is heart-shaped, then somewhat shield-shaped. Lower down, on the level of the posterior corpora quadrigemina, it has the form of an ovate leaf with the stalk directed downwards; and finally, at its junction with the fourth ventricle, it is T-shaped in section (fig. 443). The grey matter of the aqueduct is a thick stratum which surrounds that canal, and is continuous with the grey matter of the floor of the fourth ventricle. It is bounded below by the formatio reticularis, and by the posterior longitudinal bundle (fig. 443). It is continuous above with the grey matter of the lamina quadrigemina. Groups of ceUs are embedded in this grey substance; the most important of these is a long column of nerve- cells which is placed near the middle line beneath the aqueduct close to the formatio reticularis (fig. 424). This is the continuous nucleus of tlie third and fourth nerves. It commences near the junction of the third ventricle and the aqueduct, and extends for nearly the whole length of the latter. It is on a line with the nuclei of two nerves (sixth and twelfth) which arise from the floor of the fourth ventricle. The nucleus of the descending root of the fifth nerve is a group of cells in the region of the upper quadrigeminal

347 SUPINATOR BADII BREVIS The action of this muscle will, unlike that of the biceps, be unaffected by the isition of the elbow. %^ This completes the list of muscles by which the rotation of the radius upon the na is effected. The biceps and supinator brevis are the supinators; the pronator Fig. 278.â€”The Deep Layer of the Back of the Forearm.

It should be remembered, however, that\ :dinary pronation and supination are effected by a more complicated movement lan simple rotation of the radius, which would cause the hand to revolve around le axis of the little finger. The usual rotation, the axis of which passes through 16 line of the middle finger, involves a slight flexion and extension of the elbow ith some movement of the shoulder joint.

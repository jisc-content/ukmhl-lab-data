910 OBGANS OF SPECIAL SENSE Its cartilaginous portion, which is about half an inch (1-3 cm.) in length, is formed by the incomplete tube of cartilage already described, with fibrous membrane to complete its upper and back part. The osseous portion of the tube is about three-quarters of an inch (14-16 mm.) in length, and is slightly curved, with its convexity looking upwards and backwards (page 45). ^ The lining membrane is a reflexion from the skin externally. It is thick and strong in the cartilaginous, but becomes thinner in the osseous portion ; especially is this the case near the membrana tympani, over which it is reflected to form its cuticular layer. In the cartilaginous portion the dermis is supplied with numerous hairs, and sebaceous glands open into their follicles. Tubular ceruminous glands, the orifices of which stud the whole of the cartilaginous portion, appear as dark points to the naked eye. Fig. 496.—Section of the Middle and External Ear.

The arteries are derived from the posterior auricular, temporal, and internal maxillary ; and the nerves from the auriculo-temporal. THE MIDDLE EAR The Membrana Tympani is an irregularly rounded concave membrane stretched obliquely across the bottom of the osseous meatus in such wise as to form an obtuse angle with its upper wall (according to Von Troltsch, 140°) and an acute one with its lower.

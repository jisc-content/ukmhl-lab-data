1224 SUBGICAL AND TOPOGBAPHICAL ANATOMY three inches above the level of the jomt, but not so high under the vastus externus, Braune has described a deep bursa above the upper limit of the synovial membrane between the quadriceps and the femur. The external tibial tuberosity marks the lower limit of the synovial membrane, this level passing a little above the tubercle of the tibia and head of the fibula. Fig. 769.

(1) By experimental injections, Braune found that the capacity ij of the synovial sac reaches its maximum with a definite degree of flexion, i.e. at an i angle of twenty-five degrees. (2) As the same nerves supply the synovial membrane ] and the muscles which act upon the joint, the flexors being more powerful than the | extensors will help to explain the flexed position.

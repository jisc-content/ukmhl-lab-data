THE KNEE JOINT 269 memhranosus and internal lateral ligament. Superficially, an oblique fasciculus from the semimembranosus runs across the centre, passing upwards and outwards from near the back part of the inner tuberosity of the tibia to the external condyle of the femur where it joins the outer head of the gastrocnemius, a sesamoid plate being sometimes developed at the point of junction. This slip greatly strengthens the posterior ligament, of which, if not the chief constituent, it is at least a very important part. Its deep surface is closely connected with the semilunar cartilages (especially the inner), and coronary ligaments, and in the interval between the cartilages with Fig. 24G.â€”Anterior View of the Internal Ligaments of the Knee Joint. Posterior crucial ligament Internal semiliinar flbro-cartilage Transverse ligament Coronary ligament the posterior crucial ligament and fibro-fatty tissue within the joint. Superficially it forms part of the floor of the popliteal space. The capsular or anterior ligament (fig. 246) is thin but strong, covering the synovial membrane under the quadriceps extensor tendon, and looking like a loose sac. It is attached to the femur near the articular margin on the inner side, but further away on the outer ; it passes beneath the external lateral ligament to join the sheath of theiJojjliteus. Internally it joins the internal lateral ligament. Below, it is fixed to the upper and lateral borders of the patella and the anterior border of the head of the tibia. It is strengthened superficially between the femur and patella by an expansion from the suhcrureus, and is separated from the fibrous

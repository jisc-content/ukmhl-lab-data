THE SPHENOID 37 ali-sphenoids (greater wings) carrying the internal pterygoid plates. The greater wings are joined to the lingnlffi by cartilage. The dorsum ephippii is cartilaginous at birth. In the course of the first year the orbito-sphenoids fuse in the middle Fig. 42.—The Jugum Sphenoidale. line to form the jugum sphenoidale, which excludes the anterior part of the pre- sphenoid from the cranial cavity. The greater wings fuse with the lingul* in the course of the first year. THE TEMPORAL BONES The adult temporal bone consists of three parts, so firmly united as to afford little trace of its complex origin. At birth the three parts are easily separable as the squamosal, petrosal, and tympanic (fig. 103). The squamosal resembles a large scale; it is attached at right angles to the petrosal, and forms part of the side wall of the skull. It is thin, and in places translucent. The outer surface is smooth and forms part of the temporal fossa ; it presents one, and occasionally two nearly vertical grooves for the deep temporal Fig. 43.—The Left Temporal Bone. (Outer view.) TEMPORAL FOSSA POST-GLENOID TUBERCLE AUDITORY MEATUS AURICULAR FISSURE arteries. A ridge of bone, the supra-mastoid crest, runs immediately above the external auditory meatus, and is continued onwards to the zygoma. The zygoma is a narrow projecting bar of bone, jutting forwards and lying parallel with the squamosal. It has two surfaces and two borders. The outer surface is subcutaneous; the inner looks towards the temporal fossa. The inner surface and lower border give origin to the masseter muscle. The upper border receives the temporal fascia. The tip of the zygoma is serrated for articulation

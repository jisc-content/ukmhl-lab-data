1174 SUBGICAL AND TOPOGBAPHICAL ANATOMY these anatomical points explain the extreme painfulness and obstinacy of sprain^ here. Trapezius.—To map out this muscle, the arm should be raised to a right angld with the spine. The external occipital protuberance should be dotted in, and the superior nuchal line passing out from this ; below, the twelfth thoracic spine should be marked ; and externally, the outer third of the clavicle and the commencement oi the scapular spine. Then a line should be drawn from the protuberance vertically downwards to the twelfth thoracic spine ; a second from about the middle of thei Fig. 716.—Chief Arterial Anastomoses on the Scapula. (From a dissection in the Hunterian Museum.) Supra-spinatus Posterior scapular artery Rhomboideus minor Levator anguli scapulae Suprascapular artery Infra-spinatus Triceps Deltoid, insertion Deltoid Deltoid muscle Trapezius Rhomboideus major Triceps Teres major, insertion Dorsalis scapulae artery Posterior circumflex artery superior nuchal line to the posterior and outer third of the clavicle ; and a third fro the last thoracic spine upwards and outwards to the spine of the scapula (fig. 71 Latissimus dorsi.—The arm being raised above a right angle, the spines of i sixth thoracic and the third sacral vertebrae should be marked ; then the outer lip the crest of the ilium, the lower two or three ribs, the lower angle of the scap" and the posterior fold of the axilla, and finally the bicipital groove should all marked (fig. 713). A vertical line from the sixth thoracic to the third sacral spine will give t spinal origin of the muscle. Another from the third sacral spine to a point < the iliac crest, an inch or more outside the edge of the erector spinse, will give t.

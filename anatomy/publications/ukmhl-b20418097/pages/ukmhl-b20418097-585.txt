TBANSVEBSE CEBYIGAL 547 he root of the neck, but on a slightly higher plane, and a little above the clavicle, it its origin from the thyroid axis it lies under the sterno-mastoid ; on leaving the over of this muscle, it crosses the upper part of the subclavian triangle, lying here nly beneath the platysma and cervical fascia ; further outwards, it passes beneath he anterior margin of the trapezius and omo-hyoid muscle, and at the outer largin of the levator anguli scapulae divides into the posterior scapular and super- ,"cial cervical arteries. In this course it crosses the phrenic nerve, the scalenus nticus, the brachial plexus, and the scalenus medius. At times it passes between he cords of the brachial plexus. The terminal branches of the transverse cervical artery are :—(1) The posterior japular ; and (2) the superficial cervical. The posterior scapular occasionally arises ■cm the third portion of the subclavian artery. Fig. 343.—Diagram of Anastomoses of the Scapular Arteries.

It gives off the following branches :—{a) Supraspinous, which ramifies iitween the supraspinous muscle and the trapezius, and sends branches through IB muscle into the fossa, to anastomose with the suprascapular artery, (b) Infra- liinous branches, one or more of which enter the infraspinous fossa, and ana- mose with the dorsal scapular, (c) Subscapular branches, which enter the N N 2 fe

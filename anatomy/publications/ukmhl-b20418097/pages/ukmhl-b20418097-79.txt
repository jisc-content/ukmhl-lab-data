THE TEMPORAL BONES 41 fissure. The tympanic orifice of the meatus is smooth, and presents a well-marked groove for the tympanic membrane. This is veiy conspicuous in young bones. The direction of the meatus is somewhat oblique. In children, and occasionally in adults, a circular opening exists in ihe anterior wall of the meatus (fig. 53).

Intrinsic muscles To the petrosal . Articulations.—The temporal bone articulates with the occipital, parietal, sphenoid, malar, and by a movable joint with the mandible. Occasionally the squamosal presents a process which articulates with the frontal. A fronto- squamosal suture is common in the skulls of the lower races of men, and is normal in the skulls of the chimpanzee, gorilla, and gibbon.

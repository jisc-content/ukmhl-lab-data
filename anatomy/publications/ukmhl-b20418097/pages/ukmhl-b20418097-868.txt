THE NERVOUS SYSTEM 830 mastoid process, (c) The occipital branches ramify over the occipitaUs muscle, and are distributed to the skin of the scalp; they communicate with one another and with the great occipital nerve. 2. The great auricular nerve arises by two roots, one from the second, and the other from the third cervical nerve. It accompanies the lesser occipital nerve as far as the posterior border of the sterno-mastoid, and then winds round that muscle, and crosses it obliquely. In this course it runs upwards and forwards towards the tip of the mastoid process, and is covered by the skin, superficial fascia, and Fig. 454.—Superficial Branches of the Cervical Plexus.

At a point about the centre of its course across the sterno-mastoid muscle, it begins to divide into branches, which diverge from one another as they approach the level of the mastoid process, forming mastoid, auricular, and facial branches, (a) The mastoid branch, is small, and is distributed to the integument covering the mastoid process, (b) The auricular branches are three or four stout twigs which cross the superficial surface of the posterior auricular branch of the

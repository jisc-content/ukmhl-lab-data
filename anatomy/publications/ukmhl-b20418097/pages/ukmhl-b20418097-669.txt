EXTEBNAL AND INTEBNAL PLANTAB 631 arch. The digital arteries, immediately before they bifmxate, send upwards on to the dorsum of the foot a communicating branch (the anterior perforating artery) to the corresponding dorsal interosseous arteries. On the side of the toes the digital arteries—here sometimes called the collateral digital arteries—furnish numerous small branches to the integuments and the flexor tendons and their sheaths. They anastomose by many small twigs with the dorsal interosseous arteries, which also run along the sides of the toes, but more towards the dorsal aspect. Immediately above each phalangeal joint the collateral digital vessels communicate by cross branches, forming a rete for the supply of the articular end Fig. 379.—Plantar Arteries (Deep).

Internal calcanean bran ch of posterior tibial Posterior tibial artery Abductor hallucis, cut Internal plantar artery Inner head of flexor accessorius Plexor longus hallucis External plantar artery Adductor hallucis Plexor brevis hallucis Frinceps hallucis artery Plexor tendons, cut short Collateral digital branch, of princeps hallucis to inner side of great toe Cutaneous and anastomotic branches of external plantar Outer head of flexor accessorius Abnormal muscular slip Muscular branch Cutaneous branch Collateral digital artery' to outer side of little toe Second digital artery Third digital artery Fourth digital artery of the phalanges and the contiguous joints. At the distal end of the toes they also freely anastomose with each other, forming a rete beneath the pulp and around the matrix of the nail. The digital arteries are each accompanied by two small veins. THE INTEENAL PLANTAR ARTERY The internal plantar artery (figs. 878, 379)—the smaller of the two divisions into which the posterior tibial divides at the inner ankle—passes forwards along the inner side of the sole of the foot usually to the first interosseous space, where it ends by

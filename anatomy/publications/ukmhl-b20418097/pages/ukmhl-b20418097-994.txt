THE ORGANS OF VOICE 956 Its weight at birth is about half an ounce. Relations.—The thyroid body at the period of its fullest development lies partly in the thorax and partly in the neck. It extends upwards as far as the thyroid body covered by the sterno-hyoid and thyroid muscles, completely hiding the trachea. Below, it descends into the superior mediastinum between the pleural sacs and internal mammary vessels as far as the fourth rib cartilages, and lies behind the sternum and in front of the pericardium and larger vessels.

These bands are well marked at the period of birth, and seem to act as suspensory ligaments. If the capsule is removed, it is seen to send inwards numerous prolongations from its deep surface, which pass between the lobules to surround and connect them. The lobules are irregular and many-sided, and consist of numerous lymph follicles. They are grouped around a central tubular cord of connective tissue, and

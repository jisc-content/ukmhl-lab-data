314 THE MUSCLES behind to a line running backwards across the outer surface of the rib from its upper to its lower border. These attachments form a curved line with the convexity forwards, the attachment to the sixth rib being the most anterior and prominent. Insertion.—The first part is attached to an oval space upon the venter of the j scapula close to the posterior superior angle. The second part, to the whole of ; the vertebral border of the scapula upon its ventral aspect. The third part to i the large oval space on the venter of the scapula close to its inferior angle. | Structure.—The origin of the muscle is by fleshy or short aponeurotic fibres, ' Fig. 267.—Serratus Magnus. and in the first part these fibres converge very slightly towards their fleshy insertion. In the second part they diverge and form a thin sheet attached to the vertebral border of the scapula. In the third part of the muscle the fibres converge fanwise and form a very thick and strong fleshy mass which is inserted directly into the inferior angle of the scapula. At their origin the teeth of this part of the muscle interdigitate, that is, meet and fit in between, those of the origin of the obliquus abdominis externus. All the fibres are curved to fit on the convex wall of the chest. Nerve-supply.—From the brachial plexus by the posterior thoracic nerve, which is derived from the fifth, sixth, and seventh cervical nerves. After running down the side of the chest upon the outer surface of the muscle, the nerve is distributed by many branches to the various digitations. Action.—By its contraction this muscle draws forwards the vertebral border of the scapula and, as the third part of it is much the strongest, it will act especially upon the inferior angle, and will rotate the scapula so as to raise the point of the

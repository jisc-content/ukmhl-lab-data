BELATION OF VISCEBA TO THE ABDOMINAL WALLS 1145 I Viscera behind the liiiea alba.—From above downwards there are the following |(fig. 690):—(1) Above the umbilicus—the left lobe of the liver, the stomach, Ithe transverse colon, part of the great omentum, the pancreas and solar plexus. (2) Below the umbilicus—the rest of the great omentum, covering in the small lintestines and their mesentery. In the child, the bladder occupies a partly labdominal position; and in the adult, the same viscus, if distended, may rise out jof the pelvis and displace the above structures, raising the peritoneum until, if distended half way to the umbilicus, there is an area of nearly two inches safe [for operations above the symphysis flinea alba. The gravid uterus also rises along the Fig. 690.—The Viscera as seen on fully opening the Abdomen without Disarrangement of the Internal Parts. (After Sarazin.)

It may be also displaced downwards by pleuritic effusion or tight The liver is also, proportionately, much larger in little children. Of the three parts of the liver (according to the regions which it occupies), that n the right hypochondrium corresponds to the lower margin of the thorax ; but in he epigastric region the anterior margin, running obliquely across from the ninth ight to the eighth left costal cartilage, crosses the middle line about a hand's readth below the sterno-xiphoid articulation (.Godlee). The size of the left lobe aries. In infants it will occupy the left hypochondrium ; in adults its extent to the 3ft will vary from a point an inch and a half or two inches beyond the sternum to the acmg

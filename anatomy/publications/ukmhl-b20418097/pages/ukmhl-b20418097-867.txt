CEBVICAL NERVES 829 Each of the upper four cervical nerves is connected by one or two branches with the superior cervical ganglion of the sympathetic. The lower four cervical nerves increase rapidly in size from the fifth to tlie eighth, and unite with the greater part of the first thoracic nerve to form the brachial plexus. Each of these nerves is connected by one or two twigs to the cervical sympathetic. CERVICAL PLEXUS The anterior divisions of the upper four cervical nerves unite to form the cervical plexus in the following manner : the second and third nerves are connected by ascending and descending branches with one another, and with the first and fourth nerves. In this way a series of three loops is formed. The fourth nerve is also connected with the l)rachial plexus by a descending twig. The branches of the Fkt. 453.—Diagram of the Cervical Plexus.

The superficial series is subdivided into ascending, transverse, and descending branches ; the deep series into external and internal branches. SuPEKFiciAL Branches Ascending" branches.—1. The lesser occipital nerve is derived from the second cervical. It passes backwards and slightly upwards under cover of the sterno- mastoid muscle to reach the posterior border of that muscle. It then ascends, running parallel to the posterior border of the muscle, being occasionally overlapped by it, and passes on to the scalp, where it divides into auricular, mastoid, and occipital branches, {a) The auricular branch runs upwards and slightly forAvards to reach the integument on the posterior and upper part of the pinna, and is distributed there, {h) The mastoid branch is distributed to the skin covering the base of the

In the first stage all the component nerves are separate from each other. In the second stage the nerves unite with one another to form trunks. In the third stage the trunks divide into anterior and posterior divisions. In the fourth stage the six divisions become collected into three rounded bundles, which are termed cords. The fifth and sixth, and usually a communicating twig from the fourth, cervical nerves unite to form the upper trunk; the seventh remains independent and forms themiddle trunk; the eighth cervical and first thoracic, with occasionally a communi- cating twig from the second thoracic, unite to form the lower trunk. Each of these trunks divides into an anterior and a posterior division. The anterior and posterior divisions of the upper and middle trunks are about equal in size. The anterior division of the lower trunk is very much larger than the posterior division.

The anterior divisions of the upper and middle trunks join to form the outer cord. The anterior division of the lower trunk is continued into the inner cord. The first stage of the plexus is situated between the anterior and middle scaleni muscles, and at the outer border of the former muscle. The second stage is placed in the posterior inferior triangle of the neck, the lower trunk of the plexus being behind the third stage of the subclavian artery and the upper and middle trunks above and on a plane posterior to that vessel. When a posterior scapular artery arises from the third stage of the subclavian, it passes backwards between the trunks of the plexus. In its third stage the plexus lies under cover of the clavicle and subclavius muscle, and is placed above, external, and on a plane posterior to the axillary artery. In its fourth stage the plexus is situated under cover of the pectoral muscles, and the cords surround the second stage of the axillary artery, occupying 3 H

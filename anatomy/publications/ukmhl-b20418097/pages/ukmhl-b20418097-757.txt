THE BRAIN 719 Base of the Beain Dissection.—The student is recommended to commence the dissection of the brain by a general examination of the structures forming the base of that organ. He should carefully remove the remains of the membranes from the base, and after studying that region should proceed in a similar manner to remove the membranes from the superior and lateral surfaces of the cerebral hemispheres. The base of the brain presents for examination the inferior surfaces of the frontal and temporo-sphenoidal lobes of the cerebrum ; the structures contained within and adjacent to the interpediincular space ; the inferior sm-faces of the pons Varolii, meduUa oblongata, and lateral hemispheres of the cerebellum; and the superficial origins of the cranial nerves. In front, the orbital surfaces of the frontal lobes are seen separated from one another by the great longitudinal fissure, and indented by the triradiate and olfactory sulci, the^ latter Fig. 408.—View of the Base of the Brain.

Behind and somewhat laterally the frontal lobes are marked off from the temporal lobes by the fissure of Sylvius, near the commencement of which is the anterior perforated space. This space is of a grey colour, and is formed by a part of the lenticular nucleus of the corpus striatum, which comes to the surface at the base of the brain. The perforations are caused by small arteries which proceed from the middle cerebral artery to the corpus striatum. Each space is bomided internally by one of the peduncles of the corpus callosmn. The latter are white bands which pass from the corpus callosmn to the commencement of the fissm'e of Sylvius. Between the temporo- sphenoidal lobes is a large recess, which is bounded in front by the frontal lobes, and behind by the pons Varolii; within this is the remarkable arterial anastomosis known as the circle of Willis, the crura cerebri, the interpeduncular space, portions of the optic tracts with the optic commissure, the lamina cinerea, and portions of the third and fourth pairs of nerves.

MENINGES OF THE SPINAL COBD of the neural canal, but is separated from the supporting layer by fatty tissue, and by some venous plexuses. Hence this periosteum is only brought into relation with the dura mater proper by the fact, already noticed (page 712), that the dura mater of the cranium is directly continuous by the'^medium of the posterior occipito- axial ligament with the periosteum of the neural canal. The AEACHNOID is separated from the dura mater by a narrow subdural space, and is connected to the dura mater only opposite the attachments of the ligamentum 1 Fig. 487.â€”Posterior View of the Medulla Oblongata and of the Spinal Cord, WITH its Coverings and the Koots of the Nerves. (Hirschfeld and Leveille.) A B denticulatum, to be presently described. It is a thin membrane resembling the cerebral arachnoid, with which it is continuous. It sends tubular investments along the nerve-roots. These investments eventually become continuous with the perineural sheaths of the nerves. It extends downwards within the theca as far as the second or third sacral vertebra, forming a common investment to the bundle of nerve-roots constituting the cauda equina.

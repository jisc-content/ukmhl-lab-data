1091 THE OVABIES If interlacing bundles of white fibrous tissue, which pass insensibly into the faintly brillated tunica albuginea, and enclose multitudes of small vesicles called ovisacs, c Graafian follicles, in which the ova are developed. The majority of the ovisacs are microscopic, but as they ripen and approach the irface they increase in dimensions, and may even attain the size of a large white arrant. Their rupture leads to the scarring already mentioned, and the empty cap- ile slowly disappears when impregnation has not occurred; but, under the influence [ the vascularisation of the organs during pregnancy, it may undergo a remarkable levelopment and form a yellow plicated body known as the corpus luteum.

These anastomose with their llows across the middle line, one larger branch opposite the junction of the body Qd cervix, forming with the corresponding vessel of the other side the ' arterial rcle of Huguier.' Finally they communicate at the upper angle with the terminal vigs of the ovarian and funicular arteries. The uterine veins are of very large ze, and on leaving the uterus form a plexus in the muscular tissue of the road ligaments, at length joining a trunk which runs side by side with the artery ) end the internal iliac vein.

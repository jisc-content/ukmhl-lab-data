999 THE STOMACH lass to the left of the oesophagus towards the great curvature. They unite finally 7ith the circular fibres (fig. 569). [ The submucous coat is made up of areolar tissue, in which the blood-vessels )reak up. The mucous or mternal coat is pink in colour and soft to the touch, and when he stomach is not distended has a rugose appearance. It is covered with columnar ipithelium, and with a lens shows the openings of numerous glands. A thin layer of muscular tissue—the muscttlaris 77mcos63—supports the mucous membrane ixternally. i Nerves.—The nerves of the stomach are the right and left pneumogastric, the right nerve passing over the posterior surface, and the left over the anterior, the organ is also connected with the sympathetic system by means of the solar plexus. Fig. 569.—Muscular Coat of the Stomach. (Luschka.) OBLIQUE LAYER CIRCULAR LAYER Blood-supply.—The stomach receives its blood-supply from many branches. From the coeliac axis there is the gastric artery, which runs along the lesser curve from left to right, anastomosing with the pyloric branch of the hepatic. Along the greater curve run the right and left gastro-epiploic arteries anastomosing at the middle of the border, the left being a branch of the splenic, the right a branch of the hepatic through the gastro-duodenal artery. The stomach also receives branches from the splenic (vasa brevia) at the fundus. The blood of the stomach is returned into the portal vein. The coronary vein and pyloric vein open separately into the portal vein ; the right gastro-epiploic vein opens into the superior mesenteric, the left into the splenic. Lymphatics.—There is a set of glands lying along the greater and the lesser curvatures, and others at the pyloric and cardiac ends. These are entered by lymphatic vessels beginning in the mucous membrane.

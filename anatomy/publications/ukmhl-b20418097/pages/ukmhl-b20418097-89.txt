51 THE FBONTAL bones, and are separated by a serrated interval, the nasai notch, which receives the upper borders of the nasal bones, and outside these the nasal processes of the maxillse. The notch has in the middle a long pointed process, the nasal spine, which lies between the upper part of the nasal bones and the mesetlinioid. On each side of the spine an opening leads into the large frontal sinuses. Fig. 59.—The Frontal. (Anterior view.) The under surfaces of the orbital plates are smooth and concave ; they form the roofs of the orbits. Each is sharply limited anteriorly by the supraorbital ridge, and presents at the outer angle the lachrymal fossa for the reception of the Fig. 60.—The Frontal Bone. (Inferior view.) NASAL SPINE OF SPHENOID lachrymal gland. Near the internal angle there is the small shallow supra- trochlear fossa for the pulley of the superior oblique muscle. A sharp ridge runs backwards from the internal angular process, and articulates successively with the lachrymal and the os planum of the ethmoid. It has two notches, which are converted into the anterior and posterior ethmoidal canals by articulation with the E 2

THE HEABT 973 In this course the right coronary artery supplies branches to the right auricle (auricular) and roots of the pulmonary artery and aorta, as well as one that descends near the right border of the heart (right marginal), and a second (preventricular) to the anterior wall of the right ventricle. It supplies both ventricles and the septum. The left coronary artery passes for a short distance forwards, between the pulmonary artery and the left auricular appendix, and then divides into two prin- cipal branches, one of which descends in the interventricular groove to the apex of the heart (interventricular), around which it sends branches to anastomose with Fig. 554.â€”Showing the Position of the Heart and its Valves to the Chest Wall. (Reduced from Hensman and Fisher's ' Anatomical Outlines.') (The right auricle and ventricle, with the pulmonary semilunar and tricuspid valves, are outlined in blue tints ; whilst the left auricle and ventricle, with their corresponding valves, are indicated in red.) the right coronary ; whilst the other winds to the back of the heart in the auriculo- [ ventricular groove, to anastomose after division with the corresponding twigs of I the^'right artery. In this course it gives off a branch which descends near the left border of the heart (left marginal), as well as smaller branches to the left auricle, both ventricles, and the commencement of the aorta and pulmonary vessels. The cardiac or coronary veins accompany the coronary arteries and return the blood from the walls of the heart. The (so-called) great cardiac vein ascends in the anterior interventricular sulcus,

THE GREAT OMENTUM 1037 gastro-hepatic or lesser omentum. The right or free margin of this omentum was originally anterior, and the whole fold is directly derived, with but little disturbance of the membrane, from the upper part of the primitive meso-gaster (figs. 593, 595). The great omentum.—The formation and disposition of the great omentum are a little difficult to follow in the adult human species, and the student's conception of the right character of this fold may be a little distorted by a study of certain Fig. 599.—Diageam to show the Lines along which the Peritoneum leaves THE Wall of the Abdomen to invest the Viscera.

In mammals and in the human foetus the disposition of the great omentum is readily appreciated. This fold appears as a bulging of the meso-gaster forwards and to the left. When the stomach has assumed its final position, this bulging of the membrane is of course entirely in the direction forwards. At first the great omentum forms a shallow and wide-mouthed bag. Its

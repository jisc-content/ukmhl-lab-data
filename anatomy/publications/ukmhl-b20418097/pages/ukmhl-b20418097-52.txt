THE SKELETON 14 inwards, and their posterior borders are surmounted by rounded mammillary processes or tubercles. The inferior articular processes have facets which look forwards and outwards. The transverse processes are long, slender, and each presents near the base, on the posterior aspect, a small accessory tubercle. The spinous processes are thick, broad, and project horizontally backward. Fig. 14.—A Lumbar Vertebra. (Showinf? the compound nature of the transverse process. Upper view.) Fig. 15.—Variation in the Fifth Lumbar Vertebra. (After Turner.) The transverse processes of the lumbar vertebrae are more complex than they at first appear. Each is compounded of a f TcinsveTse and a costalptocess. The accessoTy pTocess represents the tip of the partially suppressed transverse process, and the part in front is an undifferentiated rib. Between the transverse and costal elements some large vascular foramina are usually present, representing the costo-transverse foramina of other vertebrae. Occasionally the costal element differentiates and becomes a well-developed lumbar rib.

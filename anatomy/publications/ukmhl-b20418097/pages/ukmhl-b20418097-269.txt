233 THE SCAPULO-CLAVICULAB I '8 mm.) above the capsule of tlie shoulder, and in the undissected state there is tcarcely a quarter of an inch (G mm.) interval. The outer edge projects over the centre of the head of the humerus, and is continued into a tough fascia under the ieltoid ; the inner edge is continuous with the fascia over the supra-spinatus nuscle. It binds the two processes firmly together, and so strengthens each; t holds the deltoid off the capsule of the shoulder, and protects the joint from flight injuries directed downwards and backwards against it. The transverse, coracoid, or suprascapular ligament (figs. 222, 223, 224) is a Ismail triangular band of fibrous tissue, the surfaces of which look forwards and backwards ; and its edges, which are thin and sharp, are turned upwards and down- wards. It continues the superior border of the scapula, bridging over the supra- ' scapular notch. It is broader internally, where it springs from the upper border of the scapula on its dorsal surface ; and narrow externally, where it is attached to the base of the coracoid process ; some of its fibres are inserted under the edge of the trapezoid ligament, and others pass upwards with the conoid to reach the clavicle. The sujn^asccqmlar artery passes over it, and the suprascapular 7ierve beneath it. Internally, some fibres of the omo-hyoid muscle arise from it. } The inferior transverse or spino-glenoid ligament (fig. 223) reaches from the [external border of the spine to the margin of the glenoid cavity, and so forms a ! foramen under which the suprascapular vessels and nerve gain the infraspinous fossa. It is usually a weak membranous structure with but few ligamentous f fibres.

268 THE ARTICULATIONS The external lateral ligament (fig. 245) consists of t^YO portions : the anterior, which is best marked and longer, is a strong, rounded cord, about two inches (5 cm.) long, attached above to the tubercle on the outer side of the external condyle of the femur, just below and in front of the origin of the outer head of the gastrocnemms, the tendon of the ijoijliteus arising from the groove beloAv and in front of it. Below, it is fixed to the middle of the outer surface of the head of the fibula, half an inch (1*25 cm.) or more anterior to the styloid process. Super- ficially is the tendon of the biceps, which sphts to embrace its lower extremity; while deeper than it passes the popliteus tendon in its sheath, and the inferior external articular vessels and nerve. Some fibres of the peroneus longus occa- sionally arise from the lower end of the hgament. The posterior portion is a third Fig. 245.â€”Posterior View of the Kxee Joint. its the of an inch (8 mm.) behind the anterior. It is broader and less defined; fixed below to the|styloid process, it inclines upwards and somewhat backwards, and ties down the popliteus against the outer tuberosity, blending beneath the outer head of the gastrocnemins with the posterior ligament of which it is really a portion. The posterior ligament or ligamentum Winslowii (fig. 245) is a broad dense structure of interlacing fibres, Avith large orifices for vessels and nerves. It is ^ attached above to the femur close to the articular margins of the condyles, stretch- j ing across the upper margin of the intercondyloid notch, to which it is connected j by fibro-fatty tissue ; it thus reaches across from the internal to the external j lateral ligaments. Below, it is fixed to the border of the outer tuberosity of the j tibia, to the bone just below the po^^liteal notch, and to the shaft of the tibia | below the inner tuberosity, blending with the descending slip of the semi- j

THE TYMPANUM 45 which gives attachment to the structures which form collectively the membranous cochlea. The lamina makes two and a half turns in all. The first turn is the largest, and forms a bulging, the promontory, on the inner wall of the tympanum. The lamina terminates at the apex of the cochlea in a hooldike process—the hamulus. The modiolus is traversed by a central canal, and presents many canaliculi for the transmission of the twigs of the cochlear division of the auditory nerve. There Fig. 50.—The Cochlea in Saggital Section. (After Henle.) INTERNAL AUDITORY MEATUS -THE SPIRAL CANAL is also a canal which winds round the modiolus at the base of the spiral lamina, known as the spiral canal of the modiolus. The portion of the cochlea above the lamina is the scala vestibuli; the part below, that is, on the basal aspect of the lamina, is the scala tympani ; it opens into the tympanum by way of the fenestra rotunda. Near the commencement of the scala tympani, and close to the fenestra rotunda, is the cochlear orifice of the aqueductus cochleae (ductus perilymphaticus). In the adult this opens on the inferior surface of the petrosal near the apex, and transmits a small vein from the cochlea to the jugular fossa.

The Ossification of the Temjporal Bone At birth the temporal bone consists of three parts easily separable in the macerated j skull: they are the petrosal, squaQuosal, and the tympanic. (The styloid process is car- j tilaginous with the exception of its basal element, the tympano-hyal, which, with the I ear-bones, will be described with the appendicular elements of the cranium. I The squamosal and tympanic bones develop in membrane. The squamosal is formed from one centre, which appears as early as the eighth week. Ossification extends into the zygoma, which grows concurrently with the sfjuamosal. At first the tympanic border is

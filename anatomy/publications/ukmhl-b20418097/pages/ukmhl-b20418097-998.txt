960 THE ORGANS OF BESPIBATION whilst the apex passes above the first rib to He beneath the subclavian artery. The lungs are divided into two lobes by a deep fissure which passes obliquely upwards and inwards almost to the root of the organ. This fissure commences at the posterior border, about 7*5 cm. below the apex, and, sweeping round the convex surface of the lung, ends near the anterior border below. In the right lung a second fissure passes from the anterior edge to reach the main fissure near its centre, marking off a third or middle lobe. The right lung is somewhat larger than the left; it is also shorter, and, as just mentioned, possesses three lobes. Fig. 544.—Posterior View of the Thorax with Chest Wall removed, showing THE Lungs. (Modified from Bourgery.) Above the middle of the inner surface, but nearer to the posterior border, each lung is connected to the pulmonary vessels and bronchi by means of its root. The root of the lung is composed of the pulmonary artery and the pulmonary vein with the corresponding bronchial tube ; and, in addition, the bronchial vessels, the anterior and posterior pulmonary plexuses with some bronchial lymphatic glands and areolar tissue—the whole of which are encased in a pleural covering. The right root lies behind the superior cava and upper portion of the right auricle of the heart; above, the vena azygos major arches to join the superior cava. In front is the anterior pulmonary plexus, and more anteriorly the phrenic nerve. Behind is the posterior pulmonary plexus and the pneumogastric nerve, whilst below is the ligamentum latum pulmonis.

1150 SUBGICAL AND TOPOGRAPHICAL ANATOMY The site of some of the branches of the aorta may be thus approximately remembered. The coeliac axis is given off immediately after the aorta has perforated the diaphragm ; directly below this is the superior mesenteric artery. About one inch lower down, or three inches above the mnbilicns, the renal arteries are given off. About one inch above the umbilicus would be the level of the inferior mesenteric artery. THE PEPJN^^UM AND GENITALS Bony boundaries.—These are the same in either sex. Above and in front i; the symphysis pubis, rounded off by the subpubic ligament; diverging downward; and outwards from this point on either side are the rami of the pubes and ischium ending at the tuberosities of the latter. In the middle line behind is the apex o: Fig. G47.—The Male Perineum. (Modified from Hirsclifeld and Leveille.) BULBO-CAVERNOSUS Superficial toangular ligament ISGHIO-CAVERNOSUS Muscles of thigh the coccyx ; and reaching from this to the tuberosities are the great sacro-sciati ligaments, to be felt by deep pressure, with the lower border of the gluteu maximus overlapping them. In the middle line, extending longitudinally through the perinteum, is the raphf

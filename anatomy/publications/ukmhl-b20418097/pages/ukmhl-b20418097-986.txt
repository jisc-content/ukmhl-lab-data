THE OBGANS OF VOICE 948 The canity is naturally divided into two portions—supra- and infra-rimal—; divided by the glottis or interval between the two true vocal cords. The suprarimal portion corresponds to the space between the wings of the th}Toid cartilage. It is broad and triangular above, but narrower below, and its walls are much deeper in front than behind. Immediately above each vocal cordj is an oblong depression—the ventricle—boimded above by the crescent-shaped; Fig. 533.—View of Interior of Larynx as seen during Inspiration. ^ BASE OF TONGUE Vallecula CusMon of epiglottis Tme vocal cord Bima glottidis Sinus pyriformis Arytenoid commissure edge of the false vocal cord, below by the straight margin of the true vocal cord, and externally by the thyro-arytenoid muscle. The ventricle extends nearly the whole length of the vocal cords, and is lined by a thin and tightly adherent mucous membrane. It allows the free vibration of the true vocal cords in the production of sound. From the anterior part of the ventricle there extends upwards, for about Fig. 534.—View of Interior of Larynx as seen during Vocalisation.

This reaches as hig as the upper border of the thyroid cartilage ; its mouth below is narrow and guarded by two little folds of mucous membrane. A delicate fibrous investment is continued from the true vocal cord around the sac. Some fatty tissue is enclosed within this,! and its mucous lining contains numerous glands. On its outer side are somei fibres of the thyro-arytenoid muscle; whilst on its inner side is a thin layer of| Median glosso-

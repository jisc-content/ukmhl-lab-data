1216 SUBGICAL AND TOPOGBAPHICAL ANATOMY anterior crural nerve, which enters the thigh about half an inch outside the artery, and at once breaks up into its branches, superficial and deep. Fig. 7G1.—Side Yiew of Pelvis and Upper Third of Thigh, with the External Iliac, Internal Iliac, and Femoral Arteries and their Branches. (From a dissection by W. J. Walsham in the ]\Iuseum of St. Bartholomew's Hospital.) The bladder is hooked over to expose the back of the pelvis.

Behind, it terminates in the posterior superior spine, which corresponds ii level to the second sacral spine and the centre of the sacro-iliac joint. (Holden.) The third sacral spine marks the lowest limit of the spinal membranes and th cerebro-spinal fluid ; it also corresponds to the upper border of the great sacro sciatic notch. The first piece of the coccyx corresponds to the spine of the ischium (Windle^ Its apex is in the furrow just behind the last piece of the rectum.

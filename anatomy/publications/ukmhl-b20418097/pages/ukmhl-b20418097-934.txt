OBGANS OF SPECIAL SENSE 896 The lower membrane (suspensory ligament of the eyeball), joined by the sheath of the inferior rectus, reaches forward to the attached (hinder) border of the tarsus of the lower lid, where it is mainly attached, while a part of it extends to the lower palpebral fascia. To understand the special hands mentioned above, we must follow the sheath of each rectus muscle forwards, when we find that, while it is rather loosely applied to the muscular belly in its posterior two-thirds, it then suddenly becomes thicker, and is firmly attached to the muscle for some distance before finally leaving it, and is thereafter often accompanied by some muscle-fibres. The best developed of these bands, the external check ligament, passes forwards and outwards to the outer angle of the orbit, helping to support the lachrymal gland on its way, and is Fig. 486.â€”Horizontal Section through Left Orbit, viewed from above. (After Von Gerlach. To show check ligaments, etc.) inserted near the orbital edge immediately behind the external palpebral ligament. The inner band, or internal check ligament, is larger than the outer, but not so thick; it passes forwards and inwards to be inserted into the upper part of the lachrymal crest and just behind it. These two bands, external and internal, come from the sheaths of the corresponding recti muscles. From the sheath of the superior rectus come two thin bands, one from each border. The inner joins the sheath of the tendon of the superior oblique; the outer goes to the external angle of the orbit, assisting in the support of part of the lachrymal gland. The sheath of the inferior rectus is thickened in front, and, on leaving the muscle, goes to the middle of the inferior oblique, splitting to enclose it ; it then passes to be inserted into the lower inner angle of the orbit close behind its margin, about midway between the internal check ligament and the orbital attachment of the inferior oblique.

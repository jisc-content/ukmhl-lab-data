The head of the comma looks forwards and constitutes the anterior horn of grey matter; the tail forms the posterior horn, and the convexity looks inwards and is united to the grey crescent of the o^^posite side by the grey commissure. The two crescents, "with the commissure, form a figure resembling a capital H.

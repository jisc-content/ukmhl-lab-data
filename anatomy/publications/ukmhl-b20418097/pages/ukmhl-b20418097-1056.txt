THE OBGANS OF DIGESTION 1018 I The fundus of the gall bladder is opposite to the ninth costal cartilage, close to the outer margin of the right rectus muscle. Relation to the peritoneum.—The liver is received between the layers of the i gastro-hepatic omentum. The an terior layer on leaving the transverse fissure passes | along to the anterior border of the liver, where it meets the round ligament, encloses i it, and is then continued on to the superior surface in two portions, owing to the ' intervention of the round ligament, the two layers reflected on to this structure being known as the suspensory ligament. At the posterior border of the superior surface it leaves the liver and forms the upper layer of the coronary ligament. \ i Fig. 583.—Eelation of the Abdominal Viscera to the Parietes. (Treves.) , The xiosterior layer of the gastro-hepatic omentum passes backwards, covers a portion of the posterior surface of the liver, and leaves uncovered that part of the ; right lobe (except the extreme right) which takes part in this surface. It is finally ] reflected to form the inferior layer of the coronary ligament. The parts of the liver uncovered by peritoneum are : the transverse fissure, the ' fossa of the gall bladder, and that portion of the posterior surface made up by the j right lobe, and to which allusion has already been made. | Underneath the peritoneal investment of the liver is a thin fibro-elastic membrane [ i

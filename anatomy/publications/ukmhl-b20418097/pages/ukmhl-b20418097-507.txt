471 PTEBYGOIDEUS EXTEBNUS Insertion.—Tipper head : (1) The front of the interarticular fibro-cartilage of he temporo-maxillary joint; (2) the adjacent portion of the capsular ligament; 3) the upper part of the front of the neck of the condyle of the mandible. Lower jiead: The pit in the front of the neck of the condyle. i Structure.—Arising by fleshy fibres, which are closely connected at the ptery- oid ridge with part of the temporal muscle, the upper head forms a fan-shaped heet which passes backwards and slightly outwards to its insertion, which is by hort tendinous fibres blending below with those of the lower head. The lower nd much stronger head is at first separated from the upper by a small chink, l^hich may give passage to the internal maxillary vessels. It arises fleshy, converges iackwards, outwards, and somewhat upwards, and is inserted by short tendinous ibres. Nerve-supply.—The external pterygoid branch of the motor division of the iferior maxillary nerve, which divides into filaments entering its deep surface. ; Action.—(1) To draw forwards the ramus of the mandible, and the inter- rticular fibro-cartilage; (2) to draw them inwards. The combination of these wo movements produces the oblique movement of the lower molar teeth of one ide, forwards and inwards with respect to the upper molars which are their pponents. It should be observed also that this inward movement of one side is he agent by which the ramus of the opposite side is moved outwards. (3) To issist in opening the mouth by depression of the lower jaw. As the transverse xis of this movement passes through the mandible at two points situated below he necks of the rami, it folloAvs that a forward movement of the condyles and ecks will assist in the backward movement of the angles and body which accom- ■anies the depression of the mandible.

5 THE SPINE long bones in adults are due to the ossification of muscle-attachments. The more developed the muscles, the larger the ridges become. The surfaces of bones are variously modified by environing conditions. Pressure at the extremities causes enlargement, and movement renders them smooth. The two causes combined produce an articular surface.

(After Wagstaffe.) upon a constricted portion of bone, an articular surface is termed a head, sometimes a condyle; when depressed, a glenoid fossa. Blunt, non-articular processes are called tuberosities ; smaller ones, tubercles ; sharp projections, spines. Slightly elevated ridges of bones are crests; when narrow and pronounced, lines and borders. A shallow depression is a fossa; when narrow and deep, a g^roove ; a perforation is usually called a foramen. The majority of terms—such as canal, spine, notch, sulcus, and the like—are so obvious as to render explanation needless. THE SPINE The spine (vertebral column) consists of thirty-three superimposed bones termed vertebrae. Of these the upper twenty-four remain separate throughout life and form three groups. The first seven are called cervical, the succeeding twelve thoracic (dorsal), and the last five lumbar. In adult life the last nine vertebras ankylose to form two composite bones named the sacrum and the coccyx. The sacrum is formed by the fusion of five vertebraB from the twenty-fifth to the twenty-ninth inclusive ; the four terminal are vestigial, and form the coccyx. In order to gain a general notion of the characters of a vertebra, it is desirable to select a bone from the middle of the thoracic series.

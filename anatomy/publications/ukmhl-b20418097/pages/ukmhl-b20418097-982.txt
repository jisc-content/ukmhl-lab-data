944 THE ORGANS OF VOICE This median portion of the membrane stretches between the borders of the two| cartilages. The lateral and thinner portions pass upwards from the inner border j of the upper margin of the cricoid cartilage in contact with the laryngeal mucous' membrane, and within the embrace of the thyroid cartilage, to form the true vocalt cords or inferior thyro-arytenoid ligaments. These elastic bands extend from the: vocal processes of the arytenoid cartilages to the retiring angle of the thyroid nearj its centre. The lateral portions of this membrane are covered superficially by the thyro-i arytenoid and lateral crico-arytenoid muscles. i The superior thyro-arytenoid ligaments are contained within the arched folds' of mucous membrane which form the false vocal cords. They consist of a few! bundles of fibrous tissue. i ! i Fig. 528.—Side View of the Muscles and Ligaments of the Larynx. | The crico-arytenoid or transverse ligament has been already sufficient! noticed. The Joints of the Larynx.—The crico-thyroid joints are lined by a syno"' membrane, embraced by a thin capsule of radiating fibres, and often strengthen posteriorly by a well-marked fibrous band. They permit of movement between th two cartilages upon an axis passing transversely through both joints, and a limitc gliding of the cricoid upwards and backwards. As can be shown on the livin body, the cricoid is the cartilage which swings between the inferior thyroid corn"" The crico-arytenoid joints possess a synovial membrane enveloped in a thin an moderately loose capsule, strengthened posteriorly by a band passing between tb. cricoid and the inner and back part of the arytenoid—the posterior crico-arytenoif ligament; and internally by the interarytenoid band, which is occasionally ligaj mentous—the crico-arytenoid ligament.

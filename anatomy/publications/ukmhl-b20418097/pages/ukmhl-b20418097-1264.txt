SURGICAL AND TOPOGRAPHICAL ANATOMY 1226 band, and descending to the head of the fibula, is the tendon of the biceps. Parallel and close to its inner border, the external popliteal nerve descends as a ronndet cord. In tenotomy of the biceps, the knife should be introduced between it anc the tendon, and made to cut from within outwards, and thus away from the nerve On the inner side the tendons are thus arranged: Nearest to the middle of th( popliteal space is the long and more slender tendon of the semi-tendinosus ; next, th( thicker tendon of the semi-membranosus ; this and the gracilis, which comes next Fig. 771.—Side View of the Popliteal Aktery.

The sartorius can only be thrown into reli ■ on the inner side of the joint by telling the patient to put it into action. j Bursse.—Five or six may exist at the back of the joint. Thus, on the inner sii: there are three, viz.: (1) Largest and most often enlarged, usually called the poplite , bursa, is the one between the tendon of the semi-membranosus and inner head ; the gastrocnemius—this communicates with the joint as often as once in every fi ;

DEEP PALMAB ABGH 577 coming off from the radial artery in the pahn; the last three from the deep palmar arch. (1) The princeps poUicis arises from the radial artery as it enters the palm, between the two heads of the abductor indicis. It passes downwards between the adductor pollicis and abductor indicis, parallel to the metacarpal bone, and between the two portions of the flexor brevis pollicis under cover of the flexor longus pollicis.

These vessels anastomose with each other at the end of the thumb, like the other collateral digital arteries. : (2) The radialis indicis comes off from the radial artery a little lower than the former vessel, or as a common trunk with it, and passes forwards between the abductor indicis and adductor pollicis, parallel to the radial side of the second PP

946 THE ORGANS OF VOICE cartilage between the origin of the crico-thyroid and the crico-arytenoid articulation. It narrows to be inserted into the fore part of the muscular process of the arytenoid cartilage. It draws the cartilage forwards, relaxing and slightly approximating the cords. It is overlapped by the thyroid cartilage, and anteriorly by the crico-thyroid muscle ; internally it is covered by mucous membrane. The upper portion is con- FiG. 530.—Posterior View of Thyroid Cartilage with Epiglottis.

It is supplied , by the recurrent laryngeal nerve. The thyro-arytenoid muscle, which is placed above the foregoing, arises broadly from the lower two-thirds of the inner surface of the thyroid cartilage close to its retiring angle, and slightly from the posterior surface of the crico-thyroid membrane. Narrowing as it passes outwards and backwards, it is inserted into the anterior Fig. 531.—Scheme showing Action of Thyro-arytenoid drawing the Vocal Cords AND Vocal Processes from II to I. (Modified from Stirling.) surface of the arytenoid cartilage, and also into its base close to the attachment of the lateral crico-arytenoid muscle. Some few of its fibres pass onwards and become continuous with the oblique fibres of the arytenoid muscle. The lower portion of the muscle lies parallel to and blends with the outer surface of the vocal cord. The upper and thinner portion is placed immediately beneath the mucous membrane, and overlies the ventricle and laryngeal pouch.

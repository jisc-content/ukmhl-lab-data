3 OSSIFICATION—BULES OF EPIPHYSES secondary centres, the primary nucleus, as a rule, appears early. Examples: the femur, humerus, phalanges, and the calcaneum. Secondary centres which remain for a time distinct from the main portion of a bone are termed epiphyses. An epiphysis may arise from a single nucleus, as is the case with the lower end of the femur; or from several, as at the upper end of the humerus. Prominences about the ends of long bones may be capped by separate epiphyses, as is the case at the upper end of the femur. Epiphyses, though of no morphological value, seem to follow certain rules, thus :— Fig. 1.—The Tibia and Fibula in section to show the Epiphyses. 1. Those epiphyses which appear last are the first to unite with the shaft. Exception.—The distal epiphysis of the fibula is visible three years before the proximal, but fuses with the shaft much earlier than it. It should be remembered that the proximal end of the fibula in man and many mammals is vestigial. 2. The epiphysis towards which the nutrient artery is directed unites first with the shaft. b2 1

850 THE NERVOUS SYSTEM the deep surface of the muscle, (iii) Several large twigs enter the adductor magnus. (iv) The geniculate branch pierces the lower part of the adductor magnus and appears on the posterior surface of that muscle close to the opening for the popliteal vessels, and descends on the inner side of (sometimes behind) the popliteal artery. Having given off a filament which accompanies the superior internal articular artery, it breaks up into terminal twigs which separately pierce the posterior ligament of the knee joint.

It arises from the obturator nerve near its commencement, or by separate roots from the third and fourth lumbar nerves. It runs along the inner border of the psoas, and crosses in front of the brim of the pubis to gain the deep surface of the pectineus. In this situation it breaks up into branches. The largest of these branches joins the obturator nerve, others enter the capsule of the hip joint, and a branch is furnished to the pectineus.

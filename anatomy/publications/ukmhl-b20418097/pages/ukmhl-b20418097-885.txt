LUMBAB PLEXUS 847 lastly, the anterior crural nerve, the largest branch of the plexus, runs downwards in the interval between the psoas and iliacus. Within the psoas small twigs are given off by the lumbar nerves, which end in the muscular substance of the psoas and quadratus lumborum. Branches.—The nerves to the i^soas and quadratus lumhoruiii arise in an irregular manner from the lumbar nerves within the substance of the psoas. The ilio-hypogastric and ilio-inguinal nerves are in some cases represented by Fig. 461.—Diagram of the Lumbar and Sacral Plexuses. (Modified from Paterson.)

More commonly they exist as two separate nerves, the upper and larger nerve being ilio-hypogastric ; the lower and smaller, ilio-inguinal. Taken together they correspond in many respects to a lower intercostal nerve. They run for a considerable part of their course between the transversalis and internal oblique, giving twigs to both these muscles. The ilio-hypogastric gives off a lateral cutaneous, which is called the iliac branch, and terminates in an anterior cutaneous which is termed the hypogastric branch.

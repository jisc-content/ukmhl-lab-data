OCCIPITAL 519 iverse process of the atlas. It is here covered by the sterno-mastoid, splenius capitis, and trachelo-mastoid muscles and by the origin of the digastricus; and lies, first on the rectus capitis lateralis, which separates it from the vertebral artery, then in the occipital groove on the mastoid portion of the temporal bone, and then on the jinsertion of the superior oblique muscle. In the third part of its course it enters the triangular interval formed by the diverging borders of the splenii capitis and the superior curved line of the occipital bone. Here it lies beneath the integuments and the aponeurosis uniting the occipital Fig. 335.—Scheme of Occipital and Posterior Auricular Arteries.

In company with the great occipital nerve, it perforates either this aponeurosis, or less often the posterior belly of the occipito-frontalis, and follows roughly, but in a tortuous course, the line of the lambdoid suture lying between the integument and the cranial aponeurosis. In the scalp it divides into several large branches, which ramify over the back of the skull and reach as far forwards as the vertex. ^ They anastomose with the corresponding branches of the opposite side, and with the posterior auricular, and the superficial temporal arteries.

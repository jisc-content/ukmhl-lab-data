140 THE SKELETON The Cuneifoem The cuneiform (or pyramidal bone) rests by its base on the ulnar side of the semilunar ; its apex is directed downwards and to the ulnar side, and serves for : the attachment of the internal lateral ligament of the wrist. The base presents ja ; Fig. 139.—The Left Scaphoid. facet for the semilunar. The inferior surface has a sinuous articular surface for the unciform bone. The superior surface has a convex smooth portion, where it plays upon the interarticular cartilage which intervenes between it and the lower Fig. 141.—The Left Cuneiform. Fig. 142.—The Left Pisiform. FOR CUNEIFORM end of the ulna; the remainder of this surface is rough for ligaments. The palmar surface has a conspicuous facet for the pisiform bone, and the dorsal surface is rough for ligaments. Articulations.—Pisiform, semilunar, and unciform. The Pisipoem : The pisiform resembles closely a split pea. Its dorsal aspect, corresponding to I the cut surface of the pea, articulates with the facet on the palmar surface of the i cuneiform. The rest of this bone is rough for the anterior annular ligament and the tendon of the flexor car pi ulnaris.

THE SKELETON 22 (neural arch) appearing in the sixth week of embryonic life. The third appears a few months after birth for the anterior arch. The lateral portions coalesce posteriorly about the third year; the union with the anterior nucleus is delayed until the sixth year. An additional centre occasionally appears for the posterior segment. Fig. 24.—Immature Atlas. (Third year.) The axis.—This is the most exceptional of all the vertebrae. It has the usual three primary nuclei—one for the body, and one on each side for the neural arch. The centre for the body appears in the embryo about the fifth month, and a few weeks later two laterally disposed nuclei are seen for the base of the odontoid Fig. 25.—Development of the Atlas. process ; these fuse together in the middle line, and by the third year ankylose peripherally to the centrum of the axis. The line of union between the body of the axis and the odontoid process is indicated even in advanced life by a persistent Fig. 26.—The Axis (from an Adult) in Section. ODOI CARTILAGE F THE INTERVEI BETWEEN Th PROCESS AN OF THE AXIS lenticular-shaped cartilage. During the second year a nucleus appears at the tip of the odontoid process. An epiphysial meniscus for the inferior and superior surfaces of the centrum of the axis appears about the seventeenth year. As a rule, the superior meniscus is represented by a few earthy granules.

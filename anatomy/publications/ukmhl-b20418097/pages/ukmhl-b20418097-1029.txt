THE PEBITONEUM 991 level named, viz. through the first lumbar vertebra, it will be found that the section lhas probably passed through the foramen of Winslow (fig. 562). Starting at the |front of the abdomen and going to the right, the peritoneum is seen to line [the anterior abdominal walls, to pass over the side of the abdomen, and to cover jfche front of the right kidney ; it then extends on to the vena cava, when it fbecomes a part of the lesser sac ; then along the back of the lesser sac, over the I aorta and pancreas, which separate it from the vertebral column ; next it reaches the anterior of the two internal surfaces of the spleen in front of the hilum. Here it meets with another layer of peritoneum, and helps to form the gastro-splenic Fig. 563.â€”Diagram to show the Peritoneum as seen in a Vertical Section. (Allen Thomson.) WINSLOW IE MESO-COLON omentum. Leaving the spleen, it changes its direction, and runs to the right to the stomach, forming the posterior layer of the gastro-splenic omentum ; it covers the posterior surface of the stomach, and leaves its upper border to form the posterior I layer of the gastro-hepatic omentum, and then passes upwards and to the right to the I liver. In this transverse section it is only seen passing on the right to the hepatic ! vessels, where it forms the posterior boundary of the foramen of Winslow. Here it bends sharply round and forms the anterior layer of the gastro-hepatic omentum ; and passing to the left reaches the stomach, which it covers in front. It then forms the anterior la3^er of the gastro-splenic omentum, and once more reaches the spleen, j It passes right round the spleen to the back of the hilum, w^here it is reflected on

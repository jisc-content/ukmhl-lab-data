THE SKELETON 150 biceps and semitendinosns. Above the surface for the semimembranosus, the tuberosity gives origin to the gemellus inferior. Its inner edge, or lip, is pro- minent, and gives attaclmient to the falciform edge of the greater sacro-sciati( ligament. The surface of the tuberosity above this lip is in relation with the internal pudic vessels and nerves. The outer lip is occupied by the quadratui Fig. 154.â€”The Left Hip-bone. (Internal surface.)

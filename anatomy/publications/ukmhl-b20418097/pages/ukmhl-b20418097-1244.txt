1206 SUBGICAL AND TOPOGBAPHICAL ANATOMY The posterior annular ligament is attached to the back of the outer margin o the radius above the styloid process, and internally to the back of the cuneiforn and pisiform. It contains six tendon-compartments, of which four are on th radius. The outermost contains the two first extensors of the thumb ; the secon( the two radial extensors of the carpus ; the third, the extensor secundi internodii the fourth transmits the extensor communis and extensor indicis ; the fifth, lyin between the radius and ulna, the extensor minimi digiti; and the sixth, lyinr just outside the styloid process of the ulna, the extensor carpi ulnaris. The sheath for the last two extensors are the only ones which follow the tendons to thei insertion, the others ending at a varying distance below the annular ligament. Th lower border of the posterior corresponds to the upper margin of the anteric annular ligament. Fig. 751.â€”Diagram of the Great Palmar Bursa. The palmar fascia, by its strength, toughness, numerous attachments, ar. intimate connection with the superficial fascia and skin, is well adapted to prote the parts beneath from pressure. The thenar and hypothenar muscles are enclos<i in two processes, which are thinner so as not to interfere with the contraction of tl- subjacent muscles. The central part, pointed above at its attachment to tli; annular ligaments, spreads out fan-like below, and gives off four slips whi( bifurcate into two processes, which are attached to the sides of the first phalar; of each finger and into the transverse ligament which ties the heads of tlj metacarpal bones together. Transverse fibres pass between the processes in j which each of the four slips bifurcate, and thus form the beginning of the thec j which is continued down to the finger to the base of the last phalanx. It is tl

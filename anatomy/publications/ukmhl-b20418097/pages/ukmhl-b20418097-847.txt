FACIAL NEBVE 809 {h) The nerve to the posterior belly of the digastric arises from the facial nerve close to the stjlo-mastoid foramen, and enters the digastric near the centre of that muscle, or sometimes near its origin. (c) The nerve to the stylo-hyoid arises at the same level as the preceding nerve, the two nerves sometimes forming a common trunk. It ends in the upper part of the muscle for which it is destined. The lingual branch is remarkable for its long course. It arises close to the two small muscular nerves above described. It passes on the outer side of the stylo-pharyngeus Fig. 449.â€”Superficial Distribution of the Facial and other Nerves of THE Head. (After Hirschfeld and Leveille.)

In this situation it is joined by filaments from the glosso-pharyngeal. It then passes between the palato-glossus muscle and the tonsil, and reaches the base of the tongue, where it ends in filaments to the mucous membrane and in twigs to the palato-glossus and stylo-glossus mnscles. (Testut.) (3) Six branches are given off from the two terminal divisions of the facial nerve. These branches traverse the substance of^the parotid gland, and emerge at its margin. At their emergence they range from a point on the zygoma, a little in front of the spot where the temporal artery crosses the bone, to the angle of the

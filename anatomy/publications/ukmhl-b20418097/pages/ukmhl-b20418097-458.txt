422 THE MUSCLES horizontal, and in serial continuation with the upper digitations of the transversu abdominis, while its higher fibres run obliquely upwards and outwards. Nerve-supply.—The upper intercostals, which send filaments to its anterio aspect. Action.—To depress the anterior extremities of the ribs to which it is attached and so to help in expiration. Relations.—In front, the internal intercostals, cartilages of the ribs, and interna mammary vessels ; behind, the pleura and pericardium. Fig. 301.—The Muscles attached to the Back of the Sternum. Sterno-tliyroid Sterno-h.yoid. Triangularis stemi Transversalis abdominis 5. INFRACOSTALES The infracostales or subcostales—named from their position beneath the ribs-: form a thin musculo-membranous sheet lining the back of the thorax external t( the tubercles of the ribs ; broader and better developed below, becoming narrowe and thinner above. Frequently it consists of only a few bundles of fibres whicl can be distinguished from the internal intercostals by the fact that they are no confined to one intercostal space. Origin.—The lower part of the inner surface of the ribs near their angles. Insertion.—The upper part of the inner surface of the ribs, each bundle o fibres usually passing over one rib to be inserted upon the next higher. Structure.—^The fibres arise tendinous, run upwards and outwards, and havd tendinous insertions. The higher fibres run more vertically. The lower approacl nearer to the vertebral column, arising from the ribs just external to their tubercles!

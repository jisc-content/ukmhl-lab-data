65 THE PALATE BONE palatine canals; near its junction with the horizontal plate is the orifice of the posterior palatine canal; and outside this occasionally may be found the minute external palatine canals (fig. 85). The sphenoidal process, which is a process of variable shape, surmounts the posterior border; it has three surfaces and two borders. The superior surface comes into apposition with the sphenoidal turbinal bone, and forms part of the Fig. 74.—Palate (Left) Bone. (Inner view.) CREST pterygo-palatine canal. The internal surface forms part of the outer wall of the nasal fossa, and is prolonged on to the roof, and comes in contact with the ala of the vomer. The outer surface is subdivided by a thin lip into an anterior smooth portion for the spheno-maxillary fossa, and a posterior rough part for the base of the internal pterygoid plate. Of the borders, the posterior is thin and articulates with the internal pterygoid plate ; the anterior border forms the posterior boundary of the spheno-palatine foramen. Fig. 75.—Palate Bone. (Posterior view.) The anterior border of the vertical plate is thin, sharp, and presents near the middle the maxillary process, which is received into the maxillary fissure of the maxilla near the lower border of the opening of the antrum. Superiorly this border is terminated by the orbital process. This process presents five surfaces ; of these, three are articular. The posterior surface joins the walls of the sphenoidal turbinal bone, its air-cells extending occasionally into this part of the F

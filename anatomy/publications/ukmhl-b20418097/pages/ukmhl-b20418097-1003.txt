I THE HEART 965 The anterior surface of the heart is convex, and looks upwards and forwards. . its lower and posterior surface, which rests partly on the diaphragm, is flattened. rhe borders which divide the two surfaces of the heart meet near the apex; the 1^. ight border is thin and rather longer than the left, whilst the latter border is thick , Ind rounded. The auricles are divided from the ventricles by a transverse groove, the ^uriculo-ventricular, which is interrupted in front by the origin of the pulmonary Fig. 547.â€”Showing the Position of the Heart and its Valves in Eelation TO the Chest Walls.

The ventricles are similarly divided from each other by the inter- ventricular groove, which runs obliquely on the anterior and posterior surfaces of "he heart, meeting below just to the right of the apex where they are continuous. The grooves are ^Dlaced near the borders of the heart, so that the right ventricle 3 mainly anterior, and the left posterior. Of the four cavities into w^hich the heart is divided, the right auricle and |entricle constitute its v enous side, whilst the left auricle and ventricle belong to Is arterial side.

THE SKULL 1113 aastoid, on a level with the roots of the zygoma (fig. 661). The lateral sinus nil be indicated by a line passing from the external occipital protuberance to a )oint one inch behind the external auditory meatus. The average thickness of the adult skull-cap is about one-fifth of an inch Holden). The thickest part is at the external occipital protuberance, where the jione is often three-quarters of an inch in thickness. The thinnest part of the skull jault is over the temporal part of the squamous. The extreme fragility of the skull jiere is partly compensated for by the thickness of the soft parts; of these, the lericranium is alone thinner than elsewhere, while its intimate connection with Ihe bones makes cephalh^ematoma less frequent here. (Tillaux.) Fig. 661.—The Skull. (Norma lateralis.) 1 In front, the circumference of the bony orbit can be traced in its whole extent. I'he supraorbital notch lies at the junction of the inner and middle thirds of the ipraorbital arch. When this notch is a complete foramen, its detection is much jss easy. Above the supraorbital arch is the supraciliary ridge, and higher still le frontal eminence. From the supraorbital notch a line drawn downwards and ightly outwards, so as to run between the two bicuspid teeth in each jaw, passes Iver the infraorbital and mental foramina. (Holden.) THE BONY SINUSES—The frontal.—The development of these by the twentieth twenty-fifth year may render a fracture here much less grave in the adult lan"^would otherwise be the case, the inner table, if now separated from the iter, protecting the brain.

THE SKELETON 141 The Second Metacarpal is the longest, and is easily recognised by its large irregular base. The dorsal surface affords attachment to the tendon of the extensor carpi raclialis longior and a part of the extensor carpi radialis brevior; to the palmar Fig. 148.—^The Second (Left) METAeARPAL. RADIAL SIDE FOR TRAPEZIUM ULNAR SIDE FOR THIRD METACARPAL — FOR MAGNUM surface the tendon of the flexor carpi radialis is inserted. The remaining surfaces present four articular facets. The end of the bone is occupied by a deep groove for the trapezoid ; the ulnar ridge of this concavity is smooth for the magnum, and is directly continuous with a long narrow facet for the third metacarpal. The radial surface of the base has a small, somewhat quadrangular facet for the trapezium.

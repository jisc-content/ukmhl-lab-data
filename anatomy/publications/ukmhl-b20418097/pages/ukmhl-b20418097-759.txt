721 FISSUBES OF CEBEBBUM sharper curve in the transverse than in the antero-posterior direction. It is marked off from the internal surface at the great longitudinal fissure by a well-defined edge. It is divided for about its middle third into a superior and an inferior segment by the horizontal limb of the fissure of Sylvius which marks off the temporo-sphenoidal lobe. The internal surface is flattened, and is separated from the opposite hemi- sphere by the falx cerebri and the subarachnoid space. The inferior surface presents, in its middle third, a well-marked projection (the temporal pole of Broca) caused by the temporal lobe, in front of which is the commencement of the fissure of Sylvius, which separates the temporal lobe from the orbital surface of the frontal lobe.

Only two fissures are included in the former category, viz. the great longitudinal and the great transverse fissures of the cerebrum, {a) The great longitudinal fissure extends from the frontal to the occipital pole of the cerebrum and separates the hemispheres from one another, except where they are joined by the corpus callosum. It contains the falx cerebri and the anterior cerebral arteries. The great trans- verse fissure will be described with the anatomy of the lateral and third ventricles. {h) The remaining fissures present a very distinct division into complete and incomplete. The complete fissures are formed by an infolding of the entire 3 A

184 THE SKELETON shafts are flatter than those of the first row, besides being much shorter. The bases have two depressions, separated by a vertical ridge. The heads present trochlear surfaces for the ungual phalanges. The third, terminal, or ung-ual phalanges are easily recognised. The bases articulate with the second phalanges ; the shafts are expanded to support the nails, and their palmar surfaces are rough where they come into relation with the pulp of the digit.

The first phalanx of second toe : The first and second dorsal interosseous. The first phalanx of third toe : Third dorsal interosseous ; first plantar inter- osseous. The first phalanx of fourth toe: Second plantar interosseous; fourth dorsal] interosseous. The first phalanx of fifth toe : Third plantar interosseous ; flexor brevis minimij digiti; and adductor minimi digiti. The second phalanx of hallux : Flexor longus hallucis ; extensor longus hallucis. The second phalanges of the remaining toes: Extensor longus digitorum flexor brevis digitorum. The third phalanges : Flexor longus digitorum ; extensor longus digitorum. Ossification.—Like the phalanges of the Angers, those of the toes ossify from a primary and a secondary nucleus. The centres for the shaft appear during the

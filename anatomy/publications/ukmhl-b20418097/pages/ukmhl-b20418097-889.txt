ANTERIOR CRURAL NERVE 851 (5) The external cutaneous nerve arises, by two roots, from the second and third lumbar nerves. It emerges at the outer border of the psoas, and crosses obliquely in front of the iliacus to reach the interval between the anterior superior and anterior inferior spines of the ilium. In this course it runs under cover of the fascia iliaca. It then passes behind Poupart's ligament, crosses in front of the origin of the sartorius, and divides into an anterior and a posterior branch. The posterior branch passes backwards and downwards under cover of the fascia lata, and divides into twigs, which supply the integument covering the insertion of the gluteus maximus and the upper and outer part of the thigh. The anterior branch Fig. 464.- -DlSTRIBUTION OF CuTANEOUS NeRVES ON THE POSTERIOR AND ANTERIOR Aspects of the Inferior Extremity.

It runs downwards for several inches in a i canal formed by the fascia lata, and enters the superficial fascia at the junction of the upper with the middle third of the thigh. It divides into branches which supply the skin of the outer part of the thigh, a few of the terminal twigs reaching as far ' as the knee and entering into the composition of the plexus patellae. (6) The anterior crural nerve is the largest branch of the lumbar plexus. It I arises by three roots, which spring from the second, third, and fourth Imiibar nerves ; ! these roots traverse the substance of the psoas and unite into a single trunk in the deep groove between the psoas and iliacus muscles. The nerve then passes under cover of the fascia iliaca behind Poupart's ligament, and is placed behind the 3 I 2

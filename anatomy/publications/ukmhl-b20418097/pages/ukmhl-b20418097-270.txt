234 THE ARTICULATIONS 3. THE SHOULDER JOINT Class.—Diarthrosis. Subdivision.—Enarthrodia. The shoulder is one of the most perfect, and most movable of joints, the large upper end of the humerus playing upon the shallow glenoid cavity. Like the hip, it is a ball-and-socket joint. It is retained in position much less by ligaments than by muscles and the effects of atmospheric pressure ; and, owing to the looseness of its capsule, as well as to all the other conditions of its construction and position, it is exceedingly liable to be displaced ; on the other hand, it is sheltered from violence by the two projecting processes—the acromion and coracoid. The ligaments of the shoulder joint are :— Capsular. Coraco-humeral. Gleno-humeral. Glenoid. The capsular ligament (figs. 222, 223 and 224) is a loose sac, insufficient in itself to maintain the bones in contact. It consists of fairly distinct but not coarse fibres, closely woven together, and directed, some straight, others obliquely, between the two bones, a few circular ones being interwoven amongst them. At the scapula, it is fixed on the dorsal aspect to the prominent rough surface of the glenoid process, reaching as far as the neck of the bone. Above, it is attached to the root of the coracoid process : in front, to the ventral surface of the glenoid process, at a variable distance from the articular margin, often reaching half an inch (12 mm.) upon the neck of the bone, and thus allowing the formation of a pouch ; it may not, however, extend for more than a quarter of an inch (6 mm.) beyond the articular margin : below, it blends with the origin of the long head of the triceps. At the humerus, the upper half is fixed to the anatomical neck, sending a prolongation downwards between the two tuberosities which attenuates

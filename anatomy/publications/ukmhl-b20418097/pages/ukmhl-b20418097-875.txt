BBANCHES OF BBACHIAL BLEXUS 837 (4) The musculo-cutaneous nerve is a branch of the posterior cord of the brachial plexus. It is composed of fibres which are derived from the fifth, sixth, and seventh cervical nerves. It is placed at first close to the outer side of the brachial artery, but soon leaves that vessel and pierces the coraco-brachialis muscle in a direction obliquely downwards and outwards. Continuing this oblique direction, it passes between the biceps and brachialis anticus muscles, and becomes superficial at the outer border of the former muscle, a little above the bend of the elbow. It then passes on the deep surface of the median cephalic vein, and divides into an anterior and a posterior branch. Previous to its division, the musculo-cutaneous nerve Fig. 457.â€”A Dissection showing the Arrangement of the Nerves in front OF the Elbow. (From a mounted specimen in the Anatomical Department of Trinity College, Dublin.) supplies three muscles, viz. the coraco-braclLialis, the biceps, and the bracJiialis .anticus. The nerves to the coraco-brachialis are two or three twigs which are ,given off from the nerve close to its origin, and before it has traversed the muscle. |The nerves to the biceps and brachialis anticus muscles arise from the musculo- cutaneous nerve as it is passing between these muscles. There is a separate t|branch for each head of the biceps. The posterior terminal branch is small, and I is directed downwards and backwards in front of the external condyle of the [humerus to be distributed to the skin on the outer and posterior aspect of the [forearm as low as the wrist. The anterior branch runs downwards on the outer and anterior part of the forearm, supplying the integument of that region, and,

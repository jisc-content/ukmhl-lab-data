THE FEMALE BEPBODUCTIVE OBGANS 1078 orifice is a neutral territory in which the vulvar and vaginal absorbents inter! communicate. I The erectile structures of the vulva correspond morphologically to those of tht male organ ; the corpora cavernosa are represented by the clitoris, and the corpu spongiosum, cleft in the female by the vulvar orifice, appears beneath the mucou membrane of the vestibule in the form of two vascular plexuses, one on each side called the bulbi vestibuli (fig. 632).

It is composed of two corpora cavernosa which differ from tbi corresponding masculine structures only in their size and in their union distall; into a rounded imperforate extremity, the glans clitoridis. The crura are supportec dorsally by a suspensory ligament, and are attached to the ischial rami in the sani' manner as in the male. The clitoris is relatively smaller in the adult than in the child, and is almos always concealed within the rima pudendi. It is a highly sensitive organ, and i capable of erection. ^ The bulbi vestibuli are two erectile bodies of somewhat pyriform shape, lyin^, one on either side of the vestibule beneath the mucous membrane.

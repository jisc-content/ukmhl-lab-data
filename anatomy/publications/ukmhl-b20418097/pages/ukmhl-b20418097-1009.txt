The left ventricle forms the chief part of the heart behind, with its apex and left border. It is somewhat longer and narrower than the right, and in cross-section its cavity appears oval.

The musculi papillares are usually represented by two large, sometimes com- pound, muscular pillars, which arise from the anterior and the posterior wall respectively ; and from these the chordae tendinese pass to the edges and surfaces of the two segments of the bicuspid valve. The orifice of the aorta looks somewhat forwards, and is guarded by three 1

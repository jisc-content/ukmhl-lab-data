THE MUSCLES 420 column. It will be also noticed that the front part of the external, and the back part of the internal intercostal sheets are thin and weak, so as to diminish this tendency towards an expiratory movement. It has been urged that both sets of intercostals cannot approximate the ribs, as in inspiration some of the intercostal spaces are seen to open out and become wider. To this it may be replied that, whatever happens in some of the spaces, it is certain that the general tendency is that of approximation of the ribs and diminution of the intervals between them, as after a full inspiration the last rib is nearer to the first rib. Moreover, it does not always follow that because: a muscle is lengthening it may not be acting (cf. such cases as that of the long head of the triceps when it is used in extending the elbow during the elevation of j Fig. 300.â€”The Intercostal Muscles. External intercostals Interna] intercostals External intercostals Internal intercostals Infra-eostales the arm). If when most of the ribs are being approximated it should happen tb some of the spaces are found to be widened, the action of the muscle in the.' widened spaces will probably be to prevent a greater separation, and by steadying tl lower ribs to enable the nmscles which descend from them to act. When tl| lowest rib is fixed by the quadratus lumborum and other muscles, it is probable th;| the intercostals, at any rate those of the lower spaces, by approximating the low-, ribs to the last rib, may act as muscles of expiration. The following are"' sonj of the arguments which may be adduced in support of the view that both sets j intercostals act together, and also that their action is usually inspiratory. \ 1. The advantage already mentioned, from their oblique decussation enabliij them to approximate the ribs more completely and at the same time to elevate the i

THE MALE PERINEUM 1097 The iscMo-rectal region comprises the parts surrounding the anus and the ichio-rectal fossae. The removal of the integument exposes the sphincter muscle of the anus in the liddle line, and on each side, between this and the lateral boundary of the perinaeum, lie external aperture of the ischio-rectal fossa. The sphincter ani externus is a voluntary muscle surrounding the anus, and ttached, in front to the tendinous centre of the perinseum (where it meets the bulbo- ivernosi, the superficial transversi perinsei, and some fasciculi of the levatores ani); ehind to the tip of the coccyx. Its fibres are closely connected with the skin, and jciperficial bundles pass forwards by the sides of the anus, a few decussating with I Fig. 647.â€”The Male Perineum.

THE THIGH 1215 upper and inner part of the popliteal space. The long saphenous, the largest branch of the anterior crural nerve, having- crossed the femoral vessels from without inwards, accompanies them as far as the opening in the adductor magnus. Here it perforates the aponeurosis, and is prolonged under the sartorius, accompanied by the superficial part of the anastomotic artery, to become cutaneous and run with the long saphena vein at the upper and inner part of the leg. Pressure may be applied to the femoral artery—(1) Immediately below Poupart's Fig. 760.—Anterior Crural and Obturator Nerves. (EUis.) Femoral vein Peetineus OBTURATOR {ANTERIOR DIV.)

Care must be taken, especially above, to avoid the vein, which lies very close to the artery, and also the

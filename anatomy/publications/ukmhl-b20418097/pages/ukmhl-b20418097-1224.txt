1186 SUBGICAL AND TOPOGBAPHICAL ANATOMY THE ARM The shaft of the humerus is well covered by muscles in the greater part o its extent, especially above. Below the insertion of the deltoid, the outer borde of the bone can be traced downwards into the external supracondyloid ridge. Th inner border and ridge are less prominent. Attached to these ridges and border are the intermuscular septa, each lying between the triceps and brachialis anticuj and the outer one giving origin to the brachio-radialis (supinator longus) an^ Fig. 729.â€”Back View of the Scapular Muscles and Triceps. extensor carpi radialis longior as well. The outer septum is perforated by tl superior profunda vessels and the musculo-spiral nerve, the inner by the infer: j profunda and anastomotica magna arteries and the ulnar nerve. On either si ] of the well-known prominence of the biceps is a furrow. Along the ou | ascends the cephalic vein. The inner corresponds to the line of the basij vein which lies superficial to the deep fascia below the middle of the arm, a | superficial and internal to the brachial vessels and median nerve. \

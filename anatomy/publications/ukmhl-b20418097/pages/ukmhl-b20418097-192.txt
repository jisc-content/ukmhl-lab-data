THE SKELETON 154 Blood-supply.—The ilium receives on its anterior surface twigs from the iho- lumbar, deep circumflex iliac, and obturator arteries. On the dorsum, arteries enter it from the gluteal and sciatic trunks. The ischium is supplied by the obturator, internal, and external circumflex. The pubes receives twigs from the obturator, internal and external circumflex, deep epigastric, and the pubic branches of the common femoral artery. Development.—The cartilaginous representative of the hip-bone consists at first of an ilio-ischiatic and a pubic segment. These quickly fuse and form a continuous plate (Rosenberg). Early in the third month a nucleus appears above the acetabulum for the ilium, and one appears a little later below the ca^dty for the ischium. In the fourth month a nucleus is seen in the pubic portion of the cartilage. At birth these three nuclei are of considerable size, but surrounded by relatively wide tracts of Fig. 158.—Hip-bone, showing Secondary Centres. cartilage. In the sixth year the Y-shaped piece of cartilage in the acetabulum ossifies, and, uniting with the three surrounding elements, causes their consolidation, usually about the sixteenth year. When this nucleus is large, it may remain separate until after the twentieth year. This is the acetabular nucleus, and is regarded by some morphologists as the representative of the cotyloid or acetabitlar bone constantly present in a few mammals, and is of sufficient size to excludes the pubes from the cotyloid cavity. During the eighth year the rami of the ischium and pubes coalesce. About the fifteenth year two secondary nuclei appear in the iliac cartilage to form the crest and the anterior inferior spine. An accessory nucleus appears for the ischial tuberosity, and subsequently one for the pubic crest. These fuse with the main bone about the twentieth year. The fibrous tissue connected with the pubic spine represents the epipubic bone of marsupial mammals.

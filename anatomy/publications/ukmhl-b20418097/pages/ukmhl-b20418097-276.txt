THE ARTICULATIONS 240 neck of the radius. The anterior fibres reach further forwards than the posterior do behind. Tt is strong and well-marked, but less so than the internal portion. The synovial membrane lines the whole of the capsule, and extends into the superior radio-ulnar joint, lining the orbicular ligament. Outside the synovial membrane, but inside the capsule, are often seen some pads of fatty tissue; one is Fig. 228.—Internal View of the Elbow Joint. Internal lateral ligament Oblique ligament Upoer edge of inter- osseous membrane Fig.' 229.—External View of the Elbow Joint. Orbicular ligament External lateral ligament Posterior ligament situated on the inner side at the base of the olecranon, another is seen on th outside projecting into the cavity between the radius and ulna ; this latter, with a fold of synovial membrane opposite the front of the outer lip of the trochlea, suggests the division of the joint into two parts—one internally for the ulna, and another externally for the radius. There are also pads of fatty tissue at the botto of the olecranon and coronoid fossae, and at the tip of the olecranon process.

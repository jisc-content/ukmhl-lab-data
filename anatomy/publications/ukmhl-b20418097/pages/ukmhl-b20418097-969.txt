THE NOSE 931 he septum, but thin at the bottom of the meatuses and within the sinuses. hme of the openings which are apparent in the dried skull are quite hidden in he recent state ; those, however, which lead into the air-spaces together with the achrymal duct remain patent, though the bony orifices are much reduced in size. Chere is a small conical closed sac, close to the septum at its fore part, which adicates the position of the now obliterated canal of Stenson. The termination is barked in the mouth by the incisive papilla. The membrane is continuous in rent through the anterior nares with the skin ; behind, it extends through the (osterior nares to line the naso-pharynx and tympanum with the mastoid cells by 7ay of the Eustachian orifice and tube. It is intimately adherent to the periosteum |,nd perichondrium. The acinous glands which are imbedded in its structure ecrete for the most part a thin watery fluid. They are especially large over the Fig. 517.â€”Oblique Section passing through the Nasal Foss^, just in front OF THE Posterior Nares. (Seen fi'om behind.) IIAN iferior turbinal bone, and very numerous at the middle and back of the fossae near 16 orifices of the posterior nares. The vestibule is lined with a scaly epithelium, behind which the cavity is jivided into an upper olfactory and a lower or respiratory region. The liactory region is lined with a columnar unciliated epithelium. The mucous [lembrane is here of a yellowish colour, thicker than elsewhere, and contains the ifactory cells of Max Schultze. The lower or respiratory is a much wider portion, in which the epithelium is plumnar and ciliated, and includes the inferior turbinal bone with the lower art of the fossa. The roof presents but one opening posteriorly which leads into the sphenoidal s-nus. The orifices in the cribriform j)late are entirely closed over. 3 o 2

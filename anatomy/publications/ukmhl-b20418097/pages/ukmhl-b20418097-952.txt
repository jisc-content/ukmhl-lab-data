914 OBGANS OF SPECIAL SENSE \ I bones, but allows a somewhat freer lateral movement. This articulation has beenj regarded by some writers as a synchondrosis, but it is now usually described as a| true joint. i The stapes with the margin of the fenestra ovalis.—The so-called annular! ligament is not equally broad throughout, and consists of elastic fibres which! radiate as they pass outwards from the edge of the footpiece of the stapes to the| margin of the fenestra. According to Toynbee, these edges are covered by a thin; layer of cartilage. i The Ligaments of the Ossicles.—In addition to the capsular ligaments alreadyl described, certain well-marked bands limit the movements of the ossicles. | The superior ligament of the malleus descends as a firm rounded band from! the upper and outer wall of the tympanic cavity to the head of the malleus. It limits the outward movement of the handle of the malleus. Fig. 499.—Section of the Tympanum, etc. (Enlarged.) The anterior ligament of the malleus is broad and strong. According t Helmholtz it encircles the long process of the malleus, and is inserted into the fore part of its neck and head. Some of the fibres of this ligament have been described as muscular under th( name of the laxator tympani muscle. But although occasionally muscular fibre can be detected, in the majority of cases they appear to be absent. The external ligament of the malleus prevents the handle of the malleus bein turned too much outwards. It passes from the margins of the notch of Eivini t( the short process of the malleus. The ligament of the incus.—The short crus of the incus is covered with a laye of fibro-cartilage and rests on a depression of the posterior tympanic wall, clos to the orifice leading into the mastoid cells. The posterior ligament binds th process to this wall. The Muscles of the Tympanum.—Two muscles—the tensor tympani and th

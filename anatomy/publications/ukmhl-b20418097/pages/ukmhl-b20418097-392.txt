THE MUSCLES 356 Variations.—The fourth lumbricaHs is sometimes absent. They may vary in their origins, sometimes arismg from one, and sometimes from two adjacent tendons. Occa- sionally one may arise from the flexor longus poUicis tendon. They may be inserted into the ulnar side of a finger, or into the adjacent sides of two fingers. 2. THE INTEROSSEI The interossei—named from their position between the metacarpal bones—are seven in number, three being palmar and four dorsal. They are small muscles, of. penniform or bipenniform structure. Both sets are easily exposed to view by ai deep dissection in the palm, but the dorsal set is alone visible in the back of the^ hand. i Fig. 281.—The Palmar Interossei. The three palmar interossei are fusiform in shape. Origin.—They arise from the sides of the metacarpal bones : the first occup; ing the whole of the ulnar side of the second metacarpal bone ; the second, tl radial side of the fourth metacarpal bone ; the third, the radial side of the fifi metacarpal bone. j Insertion.—By small tendons (1) into the aponeuroses of the extensor tendo: upon the back of the first phalanges of the index, ring, and little fingers ; and ( the adjacent portion of the side of each first phalanx near to its base; the fii being attached to the ulnar border, and the second and third to the radial horde of their fingers. I Structure.—Fleshy fibres arising along the whole length of the metacari: bone are inserted in penniform fashion upon the tendon, which, beginning on t , unattached border of the muscle near the mWdle of the interosseous space, becoirl free just above the metacarpo-phalangeal joint, and passes beneath the del transverse ligament which separates it from the tendon of the lumbricalis muscl

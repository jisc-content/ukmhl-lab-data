THE THORAX 111 THE THORAX j The thorax is a bony basket of conical shape, formed by the thoracic vertebrae, the ribs with their costal cartilages, and the sternum. The thorax is compressed antero-posteriorly so that it measures less in the sagittal than in the transverse axis : it is also deeper posteriorly than anteriorly. Its posterior boundaries are formed by the thoracic vertebrae and the ribs as far outward as their angles ; the backward Fig. 120.â€”The Thorax. (Front view.) curve of the ribs produces on each side of the vertebrae a deep furrow, the costo- vertebral groove, in which the erector sijince muscle and its subdivisions are lodged. The anterior boundary is formed by the sternum and costal cartilages. This surface is slightly convex, and has a slight inclination forwards in its lower part. The lateral boundaries are formed by the ribs from their angles to the costal cartilages. The top of the thorax presents an elliptical aperture, the thoracic inlet, which measures, on an average, 12-5 cm. (5'') transversely, and 6-2 cm. (2J") in its sagittal axis. The lower opening of the thorax is very irregular, and forms two curved lines ascending upwards from the last rib to the lower border of the gladiolus (mesosternum). These two borders form the sub-costal angle, and the xiphoid (metasternum) projects into the middle of it. The intervals between the ribs are the intercostal spaces, and are eleven in number on each side.

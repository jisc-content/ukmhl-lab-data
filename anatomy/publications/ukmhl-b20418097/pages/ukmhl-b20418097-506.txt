470 THE MUSCLES the middle fibres running downwards, the anterior downwards and backwards, the posterior almost transversely forwards, to be inserted below upon both faces of a flat tendon which, becoming free of flesh on the outer surface first, embraces the point and borders of the coronoid process. Nerve-supply.—The two or three deep temporal branches of the motor portion of the inferior maxillary nerve, which enter the lower part of its deep surface. Action.—To close the jaw ; its posterior fibres will also draw it backwards after the other muscles have protruded it. This muscle, like the masseter, has to contend with very little mechanical disadvantage, power being of more importance in mastication than speed. Relations.—Superficially, the temporal fascia which separates it from some of the auricular muscles, the sides of the epicranial aponeurosis, the auriculo-temporal nerve, and the upper branches of the facial nerve ; the zygoma and a small part of the masseter. Deeply, the temporal fossa, and the external pterygoid muscle. At its posterior border it is crossed by the masseteric nerve and vessels. 3. PTERYGOIDEUS EXTERNUS The pterygoideus externus—named from its attachment to the pterygoid process of the sphenoid bone, and its relation to the companion muscle—consists f of two thick triangular sheets, the one lying in a horizontal, and the other in a ' vertical plane. Origin.— Upper head : the under surface of the great wing of the sphenoid bone, internal to the pterygoid ridge, and external to the foramen ovale and , foramen spinosum. Lower head : All the outer surface of the external pterygoid | plate, except a small strip at its lower and front part, . '

1101 PELVIC FASCIA AND MUSCLES arises from the inner surface of the ischial spine above the levator ani, and )asses backwards and inwards, expanding to become inserted into the sides of the !0ccyx, the lateral sacro-coccygeal ligament, and the last two pieces of the sacrum. ;ts visceral surface looks almost directly forwards, and is covered by a continuation »f the recto-vesical fascia. Its parietal surface is in contact with the lesser sacro- iciatic ligament. Its superior border is separated from the inferior border of the pyriformis by the vessels and nerves which escape from the pelvis below the latter nuscle. Its inferior border is related to the posterior border of the levator ani. Che muscle is often pierced by filaments of the fourth and fifth sacral and coccygeal Fig. 651.—Muscles of the Floor of the Pelvis. (A portion of the ischial and pubic bones sawn away.)

It aids the levator ani in drawing forwards the coccyx. The recto-vesical fascia may be regarded as a lamina detached from the pbturator fascia at the level of the upper border of the ' white line.' From this point it extends upon the pelvic surface of the levator ani and coccygeus to become reflected upon the viscera immediately related to the muscular floor of the pelvis, namely, the prostate and bladder (forming the capsule of the former and the ' true ligaments ' of the latter), the vasa deferentia and vesicul^ seminales, the lower part |0f the rectum, and, in the female, the vagina and uterus. Its visceral portion is

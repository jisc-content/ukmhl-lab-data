THE ULNA 133 I Of the three borders, the cuter (or interosseous) is the most marked : it com- : lences at the apex of the triangle from which the supinator brevis arises, becomes ery prominent in the middle of the bone, but is indefinite near its termination ; he interosseous membrane is attached to it. The anterior border is directly ontinuous with the inner edge of the rough surface for the brachialis anticus, and Fig. 133.—The Left Ulna and Eadius. (Postero-external view.)

The posterior border extends from the tubercle, near the tip of the olecranon, to the back part of the styloid process. The upper three-fourths gives attachment to

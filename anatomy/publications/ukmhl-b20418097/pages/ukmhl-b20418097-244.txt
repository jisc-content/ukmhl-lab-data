This concavity is more marked in the thoracic, and still more in the lumbar region than in the cervical, as the ligamenta subflava in the former region extend a short distance between the roots of the spinous process, blending with the interspinous ligament, and making Fig. 204.—Ligamenta Subflava in the Lumbar Eegion. a median sulcus when seen from the front; there is, however, no separation between the two parts. In the cervical region, where the spines are bifid, there is a median fissure which is filled up by fibro-areolar tissue. The ligaments are thickest and strongest in the lumbar region ; narrow but strong in the thoracic; thinner, broader, and more membranous in the cervical region.

The supraspinous ligament (fig. 205) extends all along the tips of the spines as a well-marked band of longitudinal fibres, from the spine of the seventh cervical vertebra to the coccyx, where it blends with the fibrous tissue on the back of that bone, covering in the lower end of the spinal canal, and adding to the security of the sacro-coccygeal joint. It is continuous at the sides with the aponeurotic structures of the back, and above with the ligamentum nuchse, beneath which a thin tendinous continuation of the supraspinous ligament is attached along the spines of the cervical vertebrae. It is thicker in the lumbar region than in the thoracic. Its deeper fibres pass over adjacent spines only, while the superficial overlie several.

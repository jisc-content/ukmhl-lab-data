THE ORGANS OF CIRCULATION 974 passing round the left side of tlie heart to its posterior surface in the auriculo- ventricular groove to terminate in the commencement of the coronary sinus. Its mouth is usually guarded by two valves, and it receives in its course the left marginal vein, with other smaller veins from the left auricle (the left auricular) and ventricle, all of which are guarded by valves. The posterior cardiac vein (posterior interventricular), sometimes the larger of the two chief veins, communicates with the foregoing at its commencement on the anterior surface above the heart's apex. It ascends in the posterior interventricular groove, receiving blood from the ventricular walls, and joins the coronary sinus through an orifice guarded by a single valve close to its termination. Fig. 555.â€”Anterior View of the Heart, showing its Arteries and Veins. The anterior cardiac veins (preventricular) consist of several small branches from the front of the right ventricle, which open separately into the right auricle, or into the right auricular vein ; and a right marginal vein (vein of Galen), which joins the coronary sinus near its termination, or opens separately into the lower part of the right auricle (figs. 549, 555). The coronary sinus may be regarded as a much dilated terminal portion of the great cardiac vein. It is about an inch in length, covered by muscular fibres from the auricle, and lies in the auriculo-ventricular groove on the posterior surface of the heart. Its cardiac orifice with the coronary (Thebesian) valve has already been described. Besides the tributary veins already named, a small oblique vein of Marshall may sometimes be traced from the vestigial fold to the sinus. This little vein, which is not always pervious or easy of demonstration, never possesses a valve at its orifice, and like the coronary sinus formed a part of the left superior vena cava of early foetal life. The sinus also receives the posterior interventricular vein,

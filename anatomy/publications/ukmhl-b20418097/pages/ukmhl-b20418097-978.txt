940 THE OBGANS OF VOICE sinuous. Slightly depressed posteriorly, it rises in front, and then becomes abruptly scooped out and everted to form the side of the great median notch. The inferior border is somewhat sinuous. It gives attachment in front to the middle portion of the crico-thyroid membrane, and behind to the crico-thyroid muscle, and presents the small tubercle already noticed at the termination of the oblique line. The posterior border, thick and rounded, projects above and below into the superior and inferior cornua, and gives partial insertion to the stylo- and palato- pharyngei muscles. The superior coinua project imvards as well as upwards and backwards. To their tips are attached the thyro-hyoid ligaments, and near each root appears the tubercle at the upper end of the oblique line. Fig. 524.â€” Side View of the Cartilages of the Larynx. (Modified from Bourgery and Jacob.) The inferior cornna are short, blunt processes. They project inwards as well i as downwards and forwards. By means of a small oval concave facet (directed downwards as well as inwards) placed on their inner faces, the inferior cornua : articulate with the facets on the sides of the cricoid cartilage. They give partial attachment to the inferior constrictors of the pharynx and crico-thyroid muscles in j addition to the ligaments of the joint. - The CEICOID CARTILAGE is thick and strong, and forms a complete ring around the lower part of the larynx. Behind, it presents a quadrate surface, but narrows rapidly ; in its anterior half to only one-fourth or one-fifth of its posterior depth. Hence its : comparison to a signet ring. It thus possesses an anterior and a posterior portion, and a superior and inferior border, and presents four articular surfaces. The posterior quadrate portion is divided by a median vertical ridge which

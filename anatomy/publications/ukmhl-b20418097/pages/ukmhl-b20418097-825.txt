The ' filaments of the olfactory nerve/ which pierce the cribriform plate of the ethmoid bone, correspond collectively to a cranial nerve. In the case of the optic nerve, the retina, as a study of its development shows, is a portion of the brain extruded beyond the cranial wall, and the ganglionic layer of the retina m all probability corresponds to the ' nucleus of origin ' of an ordinary cranial nerve. The nervous elements which intervene betAveen the ganglionic layer of the retina and the rods and cones therefore represent the true optic nerves. 8 E 2

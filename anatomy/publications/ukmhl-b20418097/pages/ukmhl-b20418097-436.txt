400 THE MUSCLES connects the heads of the metatarsal bones and to the lateral ligaments of the metatarso-phalangeal joints. The under sm'face of the fascia is attached to the deep sm-face of the skin by small fibrous bands which form the walls of compartments containing pellets of fat. These fibrous connections give firmness to the skin of the sole and prevent it from being moved about upon the subjacent fascia. The borders of the central portion of the plantar fascia are continued upwards into the sole by the internal and external intermuscular septa, w^hich are attached above to the fibrous structures on the under surface of the tarsal bones. The inner portion, which is the thinnest division of the plantar fascia, is attached behind to the inner border of the Fig. 293.â€”First Layer of the Muscles of the Sole. Abductor minimi digiti" Plexor brevis minimi digiti- Tendon of flexor ]ongus- digit ortim great tubercle of the calcaneum and to the lower border of the internal annula ligament. It is inserted in front upon the inner side of the base of the first phalan:| of the great toe, and above it becomes continuous with the deep fascia covering th'] instep. The external portion is very thick, and arises from the outer border of th lesser tubercle of the calcaneum and the lower border of the external annula ligament. It terminates in front in the base of the first phalanx of the little toe and at its inner border it blends with the central portion of the plantar fascia where it is joined by the external intermuscular septum, and upon its outer horde it is closely connected with the base of the fifth metatarsal bone, and it i continuous with the deep fascia covering the instep.

THE NERVOUS SYSTEM 768 Relation of the margin of the hemisphere to the cranial wall.—The mesial border of the hemisphere may be mapped out by taking on the sm^faee of the scalp a point about half an inch above the superior nuchal line of the occipital bone, three-quarters of an inch on the right side (a quarter of an inch on the left) from the centre of the external occipital protuberance, and drawing a straight line forwards from this point to the naso-frontal groove. This line gradually approaches the middle line as it is traced forwards in consequence of the narrowing of the superior longitudinal sinus. The orbital margin of the hemisphere commences opposite the floor of the naso- frontal groove, and passes upwards and outwards above the orbital arch, gradually Fig. 433.—Drawing of a Cast of the Head of an Adult Male. (Prepared by Professor Cunningham to illustrate cranio-cerebral topography.) rising until it reaches a point situated from eight to fifteen millimetres above the external angular process ; from this point it passes almost horizontally backwards to the point (Sylvian point) where the fissure of Sylvius reaches the convex surface of the hemisphere. The Sylvian point is placed from twenty-nine to thirty-two millimetres behind the external angular process. From this point the upper margin of the anterior part of the temporal lobe runs downwards and forwards towards the apex of the temporal lobe as far as a point which is situated on an average about fifteen millimetres behind the external angular process, and two millimetres above the zygoma. ■ From this point the infero-external border commences, and passes backwards, with a slight inclination downwards, as far as the temporo-mandibular articulation, and is here on a level with the upper border

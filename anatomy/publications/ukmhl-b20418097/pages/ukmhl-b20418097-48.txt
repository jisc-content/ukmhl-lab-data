THE SKELETON 10 of their spinous processes. As a rule among Europeans, the second, third, fourth, and fifth vertebrae possess bifid spines. The sixth and seventh exhibit a tendency to bifurcate, their tips presenting two small lateral tubercles ; sometimes the sixth has a bifid spine, and more rarely the seventh presents the same condition. Occasionally all the cervical spines, with the exception of the second, are non-bifid, and even in the axis the bifurcation is not extensive. In the lower races of men the cervical spines are relatively shorter and more stunted than in Europeans generally, and, as a rule, are simple.

The laminc^ of the lower cervical vertebrae frequently present over the inferior articular processes distinct tubercles from which fascicuH of the multifidus spince muscle arise. They are usually confined to the sixth and seventh vertebrae, but are fandy frequent on the fifth, and are occasionally seen on the fourth. A large number of muscles are attached to the cervical vertebrae.

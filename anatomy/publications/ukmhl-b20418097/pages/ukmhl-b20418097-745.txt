LYMPHATICS OF LOWER EXTBEMITY 107 II. THE DEEP LYMPHATIC VESSELS AND GLANDS OF THE LOWER EXTREMITY The deep lymphatic vessels of the lower limb follow the course of the deep arteries and veins. Thus they accompany the internal and external plantar arteries in the sole, and the dorsalis pedis artery on the dorsum of the foot. In the leg they are found following the posterior tibial, anterior tibial, and peroneal arteries, and, after passing through the lymphatic glands in the popliteal space, accompany, first, the popliteal, and then the femoral artery up the thigh to the deep inguinal or deep femoral glands. Deep lymphatics also run with the profunda artery. These also join the deep femoral lymphatic glands. Others accompany the gluteal and ischiatic artery, and end in the lymphatic glands of the same name at the great sciatic foramen. The deep lymphatic glands of the lower extremity are met with chiefly in the popliteal space and in the inguinal region. One, or sometimes two, small glands, however, may be found in the upper part of the front of the leg, lying on the inter- osseous membrane along the course of the anterior tibial artery. The popliteal glands are placed deep in the popliteal space around the popliteal artery and vein. They receive the deep lymphatics from the leg, and those of the superficial which perforate the deep fascia along with the external saphenous vein. Their efferent vessels accompany the popliteal and the femoral vessels to the deep inguinal or femoral glands. The deep inguinal or deep femoral glands surround the upper part of the femoral vessels. One or more are constantly found in the femoral canal. They receive the deep lymphatics accompanying the femoral artery, and a few of the efferent vessels from the superficial inguinal glands. Their efferent vessels pass, in part along the course of the femoral vessels, and in part through the femoral ring to join the glands along the course of the external iliac artery. z z 2

THE MUSCLES 406 hallueis, and the inner tendons of the flexor longus digitorum with the lumbricales; deeply, the interossei and the termination of the external plantar vessels and nerve. Variations.—A small slip is occasionally given to the first phalanx of the second toe. 2. ADDUCTOR HALLUCIS The adductor hallueis—named from its action upon the great toe—is a triangular sheet, the apex of which is directed forwards and inwards. Fig. 295.—Third Layer of the Muscles of the Sole. Part of abductor minimi digiti Plexor brevis minimi digiti Transversus pedis Flexor longus liallueis Flexor longus digitorum Tibialis posticus Flexor brevis hallueis Adductor liallueis Orig^in.—(1)' The continuation forwards of the long plantar ligament whichj forms the sheath of the peroneus longus tendon ; (2) the under surface of the| bases of the second, third, and fourth metatarsal bones. ^ Insertion.—The outer part of the under surface of the base of the first/phalanx [ of the great toe. ! Strueture.—Arising by short tendinous fibres, the muscle converges in bipenni-j form fashion upon a short tendon, which blends with that of the flexor brevis[: hallueis and the outer sesamoid bone internally, and the transversus pedis i| externally.

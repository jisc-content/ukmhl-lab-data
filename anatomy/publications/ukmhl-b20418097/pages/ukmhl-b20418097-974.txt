THE THOBAX 936 The lower opening, or base, is limited in front by the ensiform cartilage, behind by the twelfth thoracic vertebra, and laterally by the twelfth ribs. The diaphragm arches upwards to form a vaulted floor to the intervening space. It is about one inch higher on the right side than on the left, and its flattened central portion is lower than either of the lateral arches. The thoracic cavity is much deeper behind than in front. The following structures pass through the loiuer opening of the thorax :—(1) The aorta, vena azygos major, thoracic duct, and, occasionally, the left sympathetic nerve pass through the aortic opening. (2) The oesophagus, pneumogastric nerves, and some small oesophageal arterial branches emerge through the oesophageal opening.

(3) The vena cava inferior ascends through the caval opening, and the branches of the phrenic nerves pierce the diaphragm to reach its lower surface. (4) The splanchnic nerves, the vena azygos minor, and the sympathetic trunk of each side pass through the crura. The viscera contained within the thoracic cavity are : the heart, which is enclosed in the pericardium ; and the lungs, with their pleural investments. The heart lies between the lungs in the so-called mediastinal space. This is bounded on each side by the reflexions of the pleura?, which pass from the front to the back of the thoracic cavity; and the common space is further subdivided into a superior mediastinum above the heart sac, an anterior and a posterior respec-

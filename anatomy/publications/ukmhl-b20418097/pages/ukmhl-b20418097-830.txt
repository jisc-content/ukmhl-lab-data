It then enters the outer wall of the cavernous sinus and runs forwards to the sphenoidal fissure, occupying a position superior and internal to the fourth Fig. 443.â€”Deep Origin of the Third Nerve. (After Krause.) nerve. At the sphenoidal fissure it divides into a superior and an inferior division. These divisions, as they enter the orbit through the sphenoidal fissure, pass between the two heads of the external rectus muscle, and are separated from one another by the nasal branch of the ophthalmic division of the fifth nerve. The superior division supplies the superior rectus. It enters that muscle on its ocular surface and sends a branch through it to supply the levator palpebrse superioris. The inferior division, considerably larger than the superior, divides into three branches ; two of these, the nerves to the internal and inferior rectus muscles,

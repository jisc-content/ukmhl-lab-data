1220 SUBGICAL AND TOPOGBAPHICAL ANATOMY from the posterior superior spine to the outer part of the tuber ischii. The point; of exit of the above arteries will correspond to the junction of the middle and lower! thirds of this line. (MacCormac.) Fig. 765.—The Gluteal Eegion, with the Gluteal, Sciatic, and Pudic Arteries. (From a dissection by W. J. Walsham in St. Bartholomew's Hospital Museum.) The inferior gluteal branch of the sciatic artery has been drawn inwards over the tuber ischii with the reflected origin of the gluteus maximus muscle.

In these ar i embedded tendinous bundles of the rectus, so as to give firmer leverage. The fac that these fibres, thus tied down, are liable to fold in between the ends of the bon after fracture, is a ready explanation of the difficulty of ensuring bony union her j (MacEwen). The patella articulates with the femur, and is separated from th

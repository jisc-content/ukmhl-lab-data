THE LABYXX 949 Luusciilar fibres, clerivecl from the arvteno-epigiotTiden?. and sometimes knoTrn as Hilton's muscle, or the compressor sacciili laryngis. The superior or false vocal cords stand farther apart than the true, and cannot be made absolutely tense. They have already been sufficiently described. A jghallow fossa—the fossa innominata—is observable, especially during- phonation. !betweenthe false cord and the aryteno-epigiottidean fold : it is placed a little behind the ei^igiottis. The inferior or true vocal cords are the structm-es concerned in the production 3f the voice. They stretch from the vocal process of the arytenoid cartilage to the [hyroid cartilage, their tension and position varying under muscular action. The jords are pearly white in appearance, and present ilattened surfaces where they face Fig. 535.—Xeeves of the Laevnx. (Posterior view.)

It is this edge which isthroAvn nto vibrations during phonation. They are about seven lines [ll mm.) in length n the adult male. The rima glottidis is the chink bounded on each side by the vocal cords and the inner stirfaces of the arytenoid cartilages with their vocal x^rocesses. It is limited behind by the interarytenoid fold, and presents the appearance of m elongated triangle, measuring, in the adult male, nearly an inch in length, and hree or four lines across at its widest part. When observed during life, the rima glottidis is seen to vary very considerably. 3n inspiration the vocal cords, whilst almost touching in front, are separated behind from a quarter to half an inch (^G to 12 mm,), forming an angle directed

1010 THE OBGANS OF DIGESTION related with the coils of small gut that occupy the pelvis, and by these coils th loop is usually hidden. The sigmoid or omega loop is attached to the abdominal and pelvic wall by meso-colon, so that it is quite surrounded by peritoneum. The line of attachmer of this meso-colon is as follows. It crosses the p;5oas at a right angle, and the takes a slight curve upwards so as to pass over the iliac vessels at or about thei Fig. 577.—View of the Deeper ABuoriiNAL Viscera. (Eiidinger.) Superior vena cava- THORACIC DUCT- hiferior vena cava- PANCREAS- KIDNEY- ASCENDING COLON bifurcation. The curve ends at a point either just to the inner side of the psoa muscle, or between the psoas and the middle line, or, as is most frequently the castj just over the bifurcation of the vessels. From this point the line of attachmeDj proceeds vertically down, taking at first a slight curve to the right. Its course i to the left of the middle line, while its ending will be upon that line, about th third piece of the sacrum. The sigmoid meso-colon measures from one and ; quarter to three and a half inches in width—i.e. from the parietes to the bowel.

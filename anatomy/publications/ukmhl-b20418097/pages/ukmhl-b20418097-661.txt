623 POPLITEAL ; gastrocnemius. The popliteal vein is behind it in the whole of its course. The I internal popliteal nerves cross behind it obliquely from without inwards, about the i centre of the space. As the artery divides into the anterior and posterior tibial, it is crossed by the aponeurotic arch of the soleus which stretches between the tibial and fibular origins of that muscle. j To the inner side are the semi-membranosus above, and the inner head of the I gastrocnemius and the internal popliteal nerve below. To the outer side are the biceps and the internal popliteal nerve above, and the outer head of the gastrocnemius and the plantaris below. Fig. 375.—Side View of the Popliteal Artery. Principal variations in the popliteal.—(A) It may divide higher, or more rarely lower than usual. (B) It may divide into the anterior tibial and peroneal. (C) The vein may [be deeper than the artery, or separated from it by a slip of the gastrocnemius. j Branches of the Popliteal Aeteey The branches of the popliteal may be divided into—(1) The cutaneous ; (2) the muscular or sural; (3) the articular ; and (4) the terminal.

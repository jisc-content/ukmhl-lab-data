265 THE HIP JOINT adduction on account of the contact with the opposite hmb ; the inward rotation, because all the muscles of internal rotation (save the tensor vagina femoris) are also extensors, whereas most of the other extensors are also outward rotators, so that each set requires to be relaxed by flexion before inward rotation can be perfected. Fig. 242.—Ligamentum Teres, lax in Flexion. Fig. 243.—Ligamentum Teres, very lax in complete Extension. I In the slightly flexed position adduction is more free, and is then limited by the outer fibres of the ilio-femoral band and the superior portion of the capsule. In flexion the range is still greater, and limited by the ischio-femoral ligament, the liga- mentum teres being also rendered nearly tight. In the nearly extended position,

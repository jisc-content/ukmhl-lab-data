1126 SURGICAL AND TOPOGBAPHICAL ANATOMY \ last is twofold, as, first, the tube in tracheotomy may be passed between it and tti trachea, and after a wound in this region this layer, continuous with the pericardii^ I may conduct discharges into the mediastina. (b) The surface structures are muci the same, but the anterior jugular veins and their transverse branches are mucf larger. The inferior thyroid veins are also larger. A thyroidea ima may ij present, and the innominate artery, which often crosses the trachea above tlj sterno-clavicular joint, may do so as high as the seventh tracheal ring. Tli trachea is also smaller, deeper, and less steadied by muscles. The thymus, to| in young children may prove a difficulty. Thus, in children, the high operatic i incising the cricoid and crico-tracheal membrane, if needful, is to be preferred. I I Fig. 673.—Anterior and Lateral Cervical Muscles. i The sterno-mastoid is the landmark for several important operations. Its ini border, the better marked of the two, overlaps the carotids; the common caro corresponding, as far as the upper border of the thyroid, with a line drawn from i sterno-clfivicular joint to midway between the mastoid process and the anglei the jaw. The artery can be best compressed above the level of the cricoid, here it is less deeply covered. The transverse process of the sixth cervical vertei ; is called the carotid tubercle, after Chassaignac, who advised compression of 1 carotid at this point. This process lies two to three inches above the clavi(| Compression below it will command the vertebral as well. The student sho«; recall the deep relations of the sterno-mastoid, which he may classify as vesf:i nerves, muscles, glands, bones; or, according to their position, (1) those above i level of the angle of the jaw; (2) those between the angle of the jaw and i

THE SKELETON 128 it is occasionally replaced by a prominent spine of bone, the supracondyloid! process (fig. 128), from which a band of fibrous tissue extends to the iilnai condyle, forming a ring, transmitting the median nerve and the brachial artery The nerve is not always accompanied by the artery; in some instances of highi division of the brachial the foramen transmits the interosseous artery. The process Fig. 129.â€”Ossification of the Humerus. UNITES WITH THE SHAi^T AT THE TWENTIETH YEAR THE UPPER EPIPHYSIS IS FORMED BY THE UNION OF THE NUCLEUS FOR THE HEAD, GREATER TUBEROSITY, AND THAT FOR THE LESSER TUBEROSITY, THESE FORM A COM- MON EPIPHYSIS BEFORE UNITING WITH THE SHAFT iEGINS TO OSSIFY IN THE EIGHTH WEEK OF INTRA-UTERINE LIFE NUCLEUS FOR THE INTERNAL CONDYLE APPEARS- AT FIFTH; FUSES AT THE EIGHTEENTH YEAR NUCLEUS FOR TROCHLEA APPEARS AT THE - TENTH YEAR NUCLEUS FOR EXTERNAL CONDYLE APPEARS AT FOURTEENTH YEAR NUCLEUS FOR CAPITELLUM APPEARS IN LTHE. THIRD YEAR THE CENTRES FOR THE RADIAL CONDYLE, TROCHLEA, AND CAPITELLUM UNITE TOGETHER AND FORM AN EPIPHYSIS WHICH FUSES WITH THE SHAFT AT THE SEVENTEENTH YEAR gives origin to the pronator radii teres, and sometimes afibrds insertion to a part of the coraco-brachialis. The posterior surface lies between the ulnar and radial borders. It is obliquely divided by the musculo-spiral groove. The surface above the groove serves for the origin of the external head the part below for the internal head of the triceps.

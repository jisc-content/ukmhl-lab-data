The synovial membrane lining the joint is occasionally either partially or jntirely divided into two by an interarticular fibro-cartilage. {h) The Coraco-claviculae Union The coraco-clavieular ligament (figs. 222, 223, 226) consists of two parts, the conoid and trapezoid ligaments. The conoid ligament is the internal and posterior portion, and passes upwards and outwards from the coracoid process to the clavicle. It is a very strong and coarsely fasciculated band of triangular shape, the apex being fixed to the inner Fig. 222.â€”Anterior View of Shoulder, showing also Coraco-clavicular and coraco-acromial ligaments. Conoid ligament and posterior edge of the root of the coracoid process just in front of the supra- scapular notch, some fibres joining the transverse ligament. Its base is at the clavicle, where it widens out, to be attached to the posterior edge of the under surface, as well as to the conoid tubercle. It is easily separated from the trapezoid without being absolutely distinct. A small bursa often exists between it and the coracoid process; internally, some of the fibres of the suhclavius muscle are often attached to it. The trapezoid ligament is the anterior and outer portion. It is a strong, flat, quadrilateral plane of closely-woven fibres, the surfaces of which look upwards and inwards towards the clavicle, and downwards and outwards over the upper surface of the coracoid process. At the coracoid it is attached for about an inch (2*5 cm.) to a rough ridge which runs forwards from the angle, along the anterior border of the process. At the clavicle, it is attached to the oblique ridge which runs

THE SKELETON 13G to the outer side of the bone, and descends to the anterior border of the styloid process. The upper third of this border is called the oblique line, and limits the insertion of the siqnnator brcvis and the origin of the flexor longus 2)ollicis, and affords attachment to the flexor suhlimis digitorum. The posterior border, com- mencing at the back of the neck of the radius, is very indistinct at first, but becomes more marked near the middle of the bone ; it terminates at the back part of the styloid process. The anterior surface is bounded by the anterior and interosseous borders. The upper two-thirds is occupied by the flexor longus i^ollicis, and a little less than the lower third by the i:)ronator quadrahis. The external surface lies between the anterior and posterior borders. The upper third affords insertion to the suijinator hrevis ; at its centre there is a rough, low, vertical ridge for the pronator radii teres ; below this, the bone is smooth and overlapped by the tendons of the extensores carpi radialis longior and brevior, and crossed by the extensor ossis metacarpi p)ollicis and extensor yrimi internodii pollicis. The posterior surface lies between the interosseous and posterior borders. The upper third is covered by the supinator hrevis ; the middle third gives origin to the extensor ossis metacarpi and extensor primi internodii pollicis ; and the lower third is covered by tendons. The lower extremity of the radius is quadrilateral; its carpal surface is articular and divided by a ridge into an inner quadrilateral portion, concave for articulation with the semilunar bone ; and an outer triangular portion, extending on to the Fig. 136.â€”Ossification of the Eadius and Ulna. -APPEARS AT THE TENTH YEAR; FUSES AT THE SIXTEENTH YEAR APPEARS AT THE FIFTH YEAR; FUSES AT THE SEVENTEENTH YEAR APPEARS AT THE FOURTH YEAR; FUSES AT THE EIGHTEENTH YEAR APPEARS AT THE SECOND YEAR ; FUSES AT THE' TWENTIETH YEAR

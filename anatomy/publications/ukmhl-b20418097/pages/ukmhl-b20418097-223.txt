THE PHALANGES 185 sighth and tenth weeks of embryonic life ; the secondary centres appear as thin scale-Hke epiphyses at the proximal ends between the fom^th and eighth years. They consolidate earlier than the corresponding epiphyses in the fingers. The ungual phalanges, like those of the fingers, ossify from the distal extremity. Fig. 191.—The Secondary Ossific Centres of the Foot. THE CENTRE FOR THE EPIPHYSIS FOR THE CALCANEUM APPEARS AT THE TENTH YEAR; CONSOLIDATES AT THE SIXTEENTH YEAR THE CENTRE FOR THE EPIPHYSIS FOR — THE METATARSAL OF THE HALLUX APPEARS AT THE THIRD YEAR; CON- SOLIDATES AT THE TWENTIETH YEAR THE CENTRES FOR THE BASE OF THE TERMINAL PHALANGES APPEAR AT SIXTH YEAR; AND CONSOLIDATE AT THE EIGHTEENTH YEAR THE CENTRES FOR THE HEADS OF THE METATARSALS APPEAR AT THE THIRD YEAR; AND CONSOLIDATE AT THE TWENTIETH YEAR The average dates of ossification of the bones of the foot :- Calcaneum Epiphysis .

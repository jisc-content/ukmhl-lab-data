THE PBOSTATE 1059 I xtremity or base lies uppermost and blends with the vesical sphincter, while its pex rests against the superior triangular ligament. Its long axis is vertical (in erect posture), or inclmes slightly forwards below (fig. 617), and is about an ch and a quarter in length. Its transverse diameter, greatest near the base, easures about an inch and a half, and its antero-posterior diameter about an ch. Its average weight is about six drachms, nearly the same as that of the sticle, and it may be noted that the active evolution of the two organs begins at game period, that of puberty, and that the structural and functional develop- lient of the one is intimately associated with that of the other during the period f sexual vigour. It oflers for description a base, an apex, and anterior, lateral, nd posterior walls. The base is connected with the musculature of the bladder, Ind usually lies a little above the level of the middle of the symphysis. The pex, resting against the superior or deep triangular ligament, is about half an ich behind and a little below the subpubic angle, and on rectal exploration will Fig. 620.— Semi-diagrammatic Section of the Male Pelvis.

The anterior all is rounded, and is covered by the prostatic plexus of veins and the vesico- bic muscle and pubo-prostatic Hgaments (page 1056). The lateral walls are in ntact with the inner borders of the two levatores ani muscles and the marginal P^' Ibrtion of the venous plexus, and project above in the form of ill-defined lobes, iiDCii persistent indication of its development in two halves. The posterior wall is '^i^"* ittened and is opposed to the rectum, from which it is separated by some con- 1™''"^ active tissue and unstriped muscular fibres. Near its upper border is a transverse edian cleft, the prostatic fissure (fig. 624), which extends deeply inwards and rwards towards the middle of the prostatic urethra, transmitting the common jaculatory ducts and the sinus pocularis, and in section (fig. 620) appearing to cut fa portion of the substance of the organ, the so-called ' middle lobe,' from the rest. An irregular artery, usually derived from the internal iliac trunk, is sometimes lund running by the side of the prostate to reach the dorsum of the penis, and may i the source of dangerous haemorrhage in lithotomy. It replaces one or more : the terminal branches of the internal pudic. 3 Y 2

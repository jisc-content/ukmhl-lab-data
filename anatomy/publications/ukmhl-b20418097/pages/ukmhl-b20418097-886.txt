THE NEBVOUS SYSTEM 848 (1) The ilio-hypogastric nerve is a branch of the first himbar. It appears at the i outer border of the psoas and crosses the quadratiis hmiborum obHquely to reach j the crest of the ilium. In this part of its course it is surrounded by the extra- | peritoneal fat. It then pierces the transversalis and runs along the crest of the i ilium between that muscle and the internal oblique, and, about two and a half | inches behind the anterior superior spine of the ilium, divides into an iliac and an \ hypogastric branch, {a) The iliac branch, pierces the internal and external oblique ; muscles and crosses the crest of the ilium, lying close to the bone. It is directed | downwards towards the great trochanter of the femur ; some of its twigs reach as i Fig. 462.—Branches of the Lumbar and Sacral Plexus viewed from before.

(6) The hypogastric branch continues the direction of the main trunk, and perforates the internal oblique near the anterior superior spine of the ilium. In this part of its course it communicates in a plexiform manner with the ilio-inguinal nerve. It is then directed forwards and inwards under cover of the aponeurosis of the external oblique. Finally it pierces the aponeurosis at a point about an inch above the external abdominal ring, and supplies the skin in that situation, forming a continuation of the series of anterior cutaneous nerves of the abdomen. i

1057 THE BLADDER it the trigone are reinforced by the expansion of the longitudmal ureteric fibres aamed on page 1053. The rather coarse meshwork formed by the decussating muscular fibres is apt io present weali: points through which the mucous membrane may protrude as iiverticular sacculations, sometimes of considerable size and capable of lodging calculous concretions. On the other hand, when the muscular tissue becomes lypertrophied from excessive use, it often forms strong ridge-like projections which nay give rise to deceptive impressions during exploration of the cavity with the ;ound.

The mucous membrane is smooth, soft, and rose-coloured during life. In the ipty bladder it is thrown into irregular folds, which become effaced by distension, is modified posteriorly over a triangular area called the trigone (fig. 618), the |ree angles of which lie at the internal meatus and the two ureteric orifices, and are a distance from each other of three-quarters of an inch to an inch. This region, lich lies opposite to the second stage of the rectum, is free from the plication ||at appears in the rest of the mucous membrane during contraction of the cavity, [d presents a transverse elevation between the ureters, called the plica ureterica, 3 Y

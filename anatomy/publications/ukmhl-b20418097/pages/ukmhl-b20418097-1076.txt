The pendulous bag-Hke projection could be seen from the left side of the meso-gaster and the wide opening into the bag from the right (fig. 600). Here the bag is represented as cut away.

The dotted Une represents the position of the bag ; a and p represent sections of its anterior and posterior walls. j The bag becomes larger and larger, and more and more pendulous, until it at last hangs down over the transverse colon and the small intestines as a kind of Fig. 601.— Great Omentum in Macropus P£yicJLLATU,'<. apron. Its orifice becomes narrowed in time by the growth of structures around ; it, and is known as the foramen of Winslow. j If the finger be introduced into this foramen, it will touch the posterior wall of the stomach, and consequently the right (or posterior) layer of the original meso- gaster. As both layers of the meso-gaster enter into the formation of this pouch j or apron, it must of necessity be formed of four layers of peritoneum. :

114 " Q. In fact, you would suggest that if tlie Com- " mission did recommend any further proceedings, " that they should take care not to exceed the limits " of public opinion — not to go beyond what public *' might be expected to support ? " A. Yes. It has struck me that it would be well " —with a view to what may be the result of this " investigation—if the attention of the Governors of " Medical Schools were called more forcibly to the " subject than at the present time. That there might " be certain Grovernors in each School, who should " take an interest in the matter, and see that there " was no unnecessary cruelty in a part of the Institu- " tion, where it is admitted generally that there must " be a certain amount of cruelty for special purposes." " Q. Has it ever occurred to you whether, as " regards these large Institutions, it might not be well " to put them under an obligation to make a public " report of the experiments they were performing ? " A. That has occurred to me. It might be a very " good rule to make." In relation to legitimate modes of research, Su' "William is asked— " Q. I suppose we may say this: That medicine is " based upon physiological, but also on clinical obser- " vation and pathology ? " A. Yes. " Q. And, in "your opinion, is clinical observation and pathological observation of more service in ^' practical surgery than experimental physiology? " A. Yes ; there is precision in the one, whilst the other is largely theoretical."

86 cloud over tlie only secure patli o£ physiological en- quiry—miglit, indeed, conceivably represent a state of things in which the barbarities of Vivisection might constitute a mode of research, of all others, the only characteristic proceeding. Another statement of Dr. Humphry's seems to imply that he has not been very observant of some things which are almost popularly familiar. He appears to think that animals have nothing like antici- pation or retrospect in relation to pain. It is not my object to insert anything sensational which I can readily avoid, and, therefore, I will not adduce the many indications of both retrospect and anticipation, which are seen almost daily by persons who are obser- vant of animals; and I will even omit a very remark- able example, which came to my knowledge through a medical man, in relation to some animals on whom experiments were in daily progress, near one of our hospitals. I also regret that it is not within my pre- sent plan tD do more than remind Dr. Humphry (in relation to another assertion of his) of some very interesting phenomena. In stating his general view of Vivisection, Dr. Humphry observes : " That forasmuch *' as a large part of the animal kingdom hves and " maintains its perfection by the death of other animals, " which is necessarily attended by more or less pain, it *' is quite a justifiable thing for man to inflict death *' and a certain amount of pain on other animals, when " there is a reasonable prospect of his condition being " benefited by it." This is a kind of jumble, if I may be . allowed the expression, which would be, perhaps, most readily exposed by being put in the form of a syllogism.

11 and tlieir effects wliicli liis apparatus were the means of liis being able to exemplify or demonstrate. Sir 0. Bell denied that he deduced his discovery from Vivisection; he asserts that he resorted to it only to convince others after he had failed to do so by other means; he says he deduced his discovery from anatomy, and adds that experiments (on animals) have never been the source of discovery. Most people will admit that an investigator is the best judge of the means whence he has made a discovery; but the advocates of that mode of research still persist in saying that it resulted fi'om Vivisection. Before we conclude this commentary, other examples will occur where the statement af the witnesses are equally irreconcilable with the facts of the subject to which they refer. Vivisectors certainly exemphfy the common tendency of us mortals in the humaiium est errare, for now we have to guard, as I think, from having Sir Charles's discovery wrested to pm^poses beyond those which it can, in a practical sense, justify. I have already referred to the tendency to sensuous evidence.. Lord Bacon warned us against it; sensus fallunt," he says; and Abernethy used to ridicule the idea of inferring the structure of a part from what you could see as contrasted with the evidence afforded by physiological and pathological phenomena. I have not much to remark on the evidence of Sir Gleorge Burrows, but he "follows suit" in reference to the discovery of Sir C. Bell. It had been known for very many centuries that sometimes parts of the body lost sensation while power of motion remained; and, vice
